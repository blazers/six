<span class="headword">Hogarth <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Courtney]</span>,  Janet Elizabeth</span>  (1865&#150;1954), <span class="occ">writer and encyclopaedia editor</span>, was born on 27 November 1865 at Barton upon Humber, Lincolnshire, the second daughter and fifth child of the Revd George Hogarth (1827&#150;1902), rector of Barton, and his wife, Jane Elizabeth (1834&#150;1921), daughter of John Uppleby of Scarborough. One of fourteen children, of whom nine survived into adulthood, she was largely educated at home with her sisters by a series of governesses before attending Grantham Ladies' College. Despite both parents' fears that a university education would foster religious doubt as well as rendering her unfit for &#145;home life&#146;, she was permitted to attend the recently founded Lady Margaret Hall at Oxford from 1885 to 1888. She gained first-class honours in philosophy (but could not graduate because Oxford degrees were not yet open to women). Although the Oxford of the 1880s was unreceptive to women, Janet Hogarth evidently regarded her time as a student as one of personal and intellectual expansion. She formed several lasting friendships, notably with Gertrude Bell, and proved herself an outstanding student. In <span class="italic">An Oxford Portrait Gallery</span> (1931) she affectionately recalls this period of her life, as well as the Oxford experiences of her older brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33924/', "David Hogarth")</script>, and of the editor of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, Hugh Chisholm.<br>
<br>Few employment possibilities were open for women with her educational qualifications, and after coming down from Oxford, Hogarth was able to obtain only a part-time teaching position at Cheltenham Ladies' College. She moved to London in 1891 and the following year found a clerical post with the royal commission on labour. In 1894 she became the first superintendent of women clerks at the Bank of England, a position she held until 1905. Throughout this period she wrote numerous articles and reviews for literary periodicals and acted as reader and sub-editor for <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32590/', "William Leonard Courtney")</script>, formerly her Oxford tutor, at the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>. She described this period of her life as one of living &#145;in a backwater&#146;  (Courtney, 167), and wrote that, for women, clerical work, &#145;was a soul-destroying avocation, from which any woman, let alone a woman of higher education, might well pray to be delivered&#146;  (ibid., 139). In 1906 she took a position as chief librarian at the Times Book Club, which soon became a vortex of disputes about book pricing and controversies about censorship. There she encountered the American businessman Horace Hooper, who had recently acquired the rights to the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. At the end of 1909 she agreed to join the editorial staff of the landmark eleventh edition of the <span class="italic">Britannica</span>. Hogarth's task was to organize the work's immense index, and to supervise a large group of women indexers and sub-editors; she was also responsible for updating or rewriting some 700 of the shorter biographies, while acting as chief confidante to the editor-in-chief, Chisholm.<br>
<br>In July 1911 she married W. L. Courtney and continued to work at the <span class="italic">Britannica</span> until the First World War, when she was employed at the Ministry of Munitions as an adviser on staff welfare, for which she was appointed an Officer of the British Empire (OBE) in the first honours list for the new order, announced in August 1917. After the passing of the <span class="roman">Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act</span> of 1919, she was among the first women to be made a justice of the peace, and was sworn in for the county of London in September 1920. She returned to work on the twelfth edition of the <span class="italic">Britannica</span> from 1920 to 1922 and made a promotional tour of the United States with Chisholm. In her sixties, and in the years after her husband's death in 1928, she wrote several volumes of memoirs which give considerable insight into the experiences of educated women of the period. She died in a nursing home in London on 24 September 1954, and was cremated.<br>
<br>As a young woman under the influence of Mrs Humphry Ward and her fellow student, Gertrude Bell, and wishing to dissociate herself from militant suffragists, Hogarth took an anti-suffrage position and even served on the executive of the Women's National Anti-Suffrage League. Like many others, she later reversed her position, claiming that she was particularly affronted, after her marriage, by the social and legal assumption that one who had been &#145;for years a self-respecting and tax-paying citizen, at once becomes incapable of paying her own taxes&#146;. It was this, she asserted, that served to &#145;finally topple me off the fence into the suffragist camp&#146;  (Courtney, 250).<br>
