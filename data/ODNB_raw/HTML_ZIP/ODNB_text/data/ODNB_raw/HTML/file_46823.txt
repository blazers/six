<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Nasmyth family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1788&#150;1884), were active as <span class="occ">painters and art teachers</span>. The painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19797/', "Alexander Nasmyth (1758&#150;1840)")</script> and his wife, Barbara Foulis (<i>d</i>. 1847), had eleven children of whom at least eight were gifted artists. The eldest, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19802/', "Patrick Nasmyth (1787&#150;1831)")</script>, is noticed separately, as is their second son, the mechanical engineer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19801/', "James Hall Nasmyth (1808&#150;1890)")</script>.<br>
<br>Alexander Nasmyth's six daughters&#151;Jane, Barbara, Margaret, Elizabeth, Anne, and Charlotte&#151;were all painters who assisted their father with his art classes. He was insistent that all his children should be able to be independent, and accordingly taught them to draw and paint. Because they were unable to travel to the continent during the Napoleonic wars many middle-class Scottish families spent more time in Edinburgh than had been customary. Nasmyth therefore had a constant supply of young ladies to teach, as well as would-be professional artists requiring instruction. His classes were conducted in the large studio at the top of his house in York Place, and until he died in 1840 these were managed by his eldest daughter, Jane, with the help of her sisters. Their brother James recorded that<blockquote>My sisters all possessed, in a greater or lesser degree, an innate love of art, and by their diligent application they acquired the practice of painting landscapes in oils. My father's admirable system and method of teaching rendered them expert in making accurate sketches from nature &hellip; which they turned to good account &hellip; My father sedulously kept up the attention of his daughters to fine art. By this means he enabled them to assist in the maintenance of the family while at home, and afterwards to maintain themselves &hellip; To accomplish this object &hellip; he set on foot drawing classes which were managed by his six daughters, superintended by himself. (<span class="italic">James Nasmyth</span>, 54&#150;5)</blockquote>In addition to formal tuition in the studio the girls took sketching parties to the picturesque spots in and around Edinburgh such as Arthur's Seat, Rosslyn Chapel, Hawthornden, and Calton Hill. The girls probably also assisted with the large amount of scene painting taken on by their father for most of the Scottish theatres. From 1815 onwards there is evidence that all the girls went with their father on some of his annual visits to the Royal Academy exhibitions in London. Apart from Elizabeth and Anne, who left home when they married, little is known of their daily lives. The four other girls had some independence and occasionally took lodgings in London. In 1815, the year in which Elizabeth's marriage took place in London, they lived with their mother at 4 Leicester Square, then the centre of London's art world. Between 1836 and 1840 Jane, Anne, and Charlotte occupied from time to time an apartment at 326 Regent Street, London. All the girls exhibited widely; from 1826 to 1866 they sent works variously to the Water Colour Exhibition in Spring Gardens, London, the Carlisle Exhibition, the Birmingham Society of Artists, the Royal Manchester Institution, the Liverpool Academy, the British Institution, the Society of Artists in Suffolk Street, London, and the Royal Academy (for details see Johnson and Money, 55&#150;7). They all kept a number of finished works to send to exhibitions, working in oil and occasionally watercolour. The most prolific were Jane, Charlotte, and Margaret&#151;with 43, 44, 41 works respectively&#151;followed by Barbara (33) and Elizabeth (23), and then Anne (16). Except for occasional sketches of each other they engaged in landscape painting. Almost all their works were landscapes of a small size (up to 18 inches by 24 inches), and remain in private collections. Their signed and dated works come on to the market infrequently and have not yet been catalogued. More recently examples of their finely detailed landscapes were exhibited at the Saltire Society, Edinburgh (1948); &#145;The Nasmyth Family&#146; (Oscar and Peter Johnson, London, 1964); &#145;Alexander Nasmyth and his Family&#146; (Monks Hall Museum, Eccles, Manchester, 1973); and &#145;Alexander Nasmyth&#146; (St Andrews, 1979).<br>
<br>Following Alexander Nasmyth's death in May 1840 his studio sale in Edinburgh of 155 Nasmyth canvases included work by every artist member of the family (except James, who, though an engineer, also painted). Mrs Nasmyth, Jane, Barbara, and Charlotte went to live with James (who had married Anne Hartop in June 1840), George, and Margaret at Green Lane House in Patricroft, Manchester. When George left in 1843 Mrs Nasmyth, Jane, Barbara, Margaret, and Charlotte moved to Richmond Terrace, Pendleton, to be near Anne and her husband, William Bennett, in Leaf Square, Salford. Mrs Nasmyth suffered a stroke and died in 1847, and by 1852 the four Nasmyth girls had followed the Bennetts to Putney. They lived around the corner from Charlwood Road at 17 Stratford Grove, remaining there until 1860, when they moved next door to the Bennetts at 1 Stanhope Villas. At one point Elizabeth and Charles Richardson lived at no. 2.<br>
<br>Andrew Geddes, whose Scottish home was a few doors away from the Nasmyths in York Place, painted a half-length portrait of Charlotte (NG Scot.) which shows a pretty, dark-haired girl in a frilly organdie dress, holding a flower. William Nicholson painted watercolours of Jane, Anne, Barbara, and Margaret showing them with light brown hair and the pronounced Nasmyth nose (Scot. NPG). Geddes also painted a domestic scene entitled <span class="italic">Dull Readings</span> featuring Daniel and Elizabeth Terry at home by the fire (all portraits repro. in Cooksey, 155&#150;6, 158).<br>
<br>In their brother James's opinion his sisters' styles of painting were distinct from one another. However, with several members of the family painting together and occasionally adding touches to each other's work, unless the work is signed, attribution is problematic. In addition, many other artists learned to paint in the Nasmyth style&#151;as a <span class="italic">View of St Bernard's Well</span> (Royal Scottish Academy), by Mrs Ann Cummyng, demonstrates&#151;and this makes for more complex questions of attribution. In a letter of 1826 to his framer, William Cribb, Alexander Nasmyth describes a box of pictures for exhibition in London in which he refers to his &#145;View of Greenoch with some catle Painted by Miss Jane&#146;, and a woody scene in Dumfriesshire: &#145;this Picture is likewise by Miss Jane with some of my own painting on it as is the case with all of them&#146;  (Cooksey, 126).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_75551"></a><span class="headword">Jane Nasmyth</span>  (1788&#150;1867)<span class="occ"></span> was born in the parish of St Andrew Kirk, Edinburgh, on 29 March 1788. The parish register records her first name as Jean but she signed her work Jane, the name by which she was known. Nicknamed &#145;Old Solid&#146; by the family, she assisted with the raising of her younger brothers and sisters before helping with the running of the school. Her brother James recorded that &#145;My father consulted her in every course of importance in reference to business and financial affairs&#146;  (<span class="italic">James Nasmyth</span>, 54). She sometimes accompanied her father on working trips and became his trusted confidante. The titles of her exhibited works suggest that she travelled a good deal, painting views of Windermere, Cumberland, Derbyshire, Richmond, Windsor, and Putney, as well as many others in various parts of Scotland. She also painted one scene of Geneva (exh. Royal Manchester Institution, 1851) and another of Lake Lausanne (priv. coll.). There is no evidence, however, that she went abroad, and for these two landscapes probably made use of her father's drawings. She favoured lake and mountain scenes, old trees, and sometimes her landscapes included towns such as <span class="italic">A View of Perth</span> (exh. Royal Manchester Institution, 1845), or <span class="italic">The Village of Swanston</span> (1826). Her work closely resembles that of her father, particularly in the painting of trees, rocks, and paths, and foreground details. Her figures are not so lifelike, however, and are often colourfully attired. Sometimes her foreground areas resemble water in their flat treatment, for example, <span class="italic">Loch Katrine</span> (repr. in Johnson and Money). Some of her later works are closer to those of her sister Charlotte, the tree trunks and dead branches in the trees particularly. She often bathed her distances in a pinkish evening light, so common in Scottish skies and beloved by her father. She signed her work &#145;Jane Nasmyth&#146; with the date, sometimes only on the exhibition label attached to the frame or stretcher, and favoured a Glasgow framer, Brand &amp; Co. She died on 11 May 1867 and was buried in Putney Lower Common cemetery, in a grave to the right of the chapel. In due course her sisters Margaret, Barbara, and Charlotte were buried in the same plot.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_75552"></a><span class="headword">Barbara Nasmyth</span>  (1790&#150;1870)<span class="occ"></span> was born in St James's Square, St Cuthbert's parish, Edinburgh, on 15 April 1790. She accompanied her sisters Charlotte and Margaret on a visit to London in 1816, but the titles of her works suggest that, in general, though she went to Patricroft in 1840 and later settled in London, she painted mostly Scottish subjects in the vicinity of Edinburgh and in the lowlands. These included loch scenes, castles, river views, and townscapes in Edinburgh, Kenmore, and Comrie. Evidence of expeditions south of the border includes views of Westmorland, Derbyshire, and Essex. She was the last of the sisters to exhibit her work, beginning in 1845. She excelled in woodland scenery, cottages, and loch scenes, for example <span class="italic">Highland Landscape with Loch</span> (priv. coll.), in which the trees are closer to Charlotte's than her father's in their roughness of bark and lighter colouring. Her figures are finely detailed, and she loved painting sailing boats as in <span class="italic">Scottish Landscape</span> (repro. in Johnson and Money). She signed her work &#145;Barbara Nasmyth&#146; neatly with a fine brush, sometimes adding the date. She died on 2 February 1870 at her home, Stanhope Villas, Charlwood Road, Putney.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_75553"></a><span class="headword">Margaret Nasmyth</span>  (1791&#150;1869)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 11 April 1791 in Hill Street, St Andrew's parish, Edinburgh. She followed her father in style, but like Barbara she preferred the more detailed and minute brushwork of her brother Patrick. Margaret left home in 1836 to live with her brothers James and George, at Green Lane House, Patricroft, Manchester. She did not exhibit until 1841 at the age of fifty, by which time the whole family had come to live with James, when presumably she had more time to herself. She travelled much, drawing subjects from all over Scotland as well as Cumberland, Lancashire, north Wales, Shropshire, Westmorland, and Cheshire, and further afield, in Blackford Heath and Chigwell, Essex. Her technique is fine and detailed, and she lavished much care on all parts of her paintings. Good examples are <span class="italic">Lake Scene</span> and <span class="italic">View of Kinfauns Castle Perthshire</span> (both repro. in Johnson and Money). She signed her work &#145;Margaret Nasmyth&#146; in the bottom left-hand corner in a large, clear hand, though sometimes &#145;MN&#146; with the date, in the bottom right-hand corner. She died at Stanhope Villas on 3 November 1869.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_75554"></a><span class="headword">Elizabeth Wemyss Nasmyth</span>  (1793&#150;1862)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 26 August 1793 in Hill Street, St Andrew's parish, Edinburgh. On 25 June 1815 she married the actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27147/', "Daniel Terry (1789&#150;1829)")</script>. The marriage possibly took place rather suddenly, for in Nasmyth's letter to his children in Edinburgh of a few weeks earlier he makes no mention of it. Elizabeth was a talented designer and through Daniel Terry's association with Sir Walter Scott over the building of Abbotsford prepared designs for Scott's armoury. On 15 July 1815 Terry wrote to Scott:<blockquote>Mrs Terry is at length returned to her easel our visitors are departed &amp; quite singular labour is again embarked upon we have upon the frames three transparencies the designs of two are already outlined &amp; are armour clad men in appropriate landscapes (Wainwright, 174)</blockquote>Wainwright notes that &#145;these transparencies could refer to cartoons for stained glass, but they more probably refer to transparent painted roller blinds of a type popular at the time&#146;  (ibid., 174&#150;5). On 11 May 1816 Terry wrote again to Scott: &#145;&hellip; nor the window blinds for Abbotsford are forgotten with the restored health of the artist [Mrs Terry] they will be proceded with&#146;  (ibid.). In September 1818 Terry advised Scott: &#145;I think you will like your windows with your arms, old abbots, knights and the Stirling heads with their coloured borders and ornaments&#146;  (ibid.). The following month Scott wrote to a friend that &#145;Naesmythe and his daughter Mrs Terry have arrived here unexpectedly&#146;, presumably to see how work was progressing on the house  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Elizabeth continued with her painting, sending works to the British Institution from 1816 to 1829. Her style is perhaps the coldest and least painterly of the sisters, a rare signed example being <span class="italic">Driving Cattle by a Loch</span> (priv. coll.). Though identifiable as of the &#145;Nasmyth school&#146;, and competently finished, her work is stylistically less romantic. This is partly due to her use of bright colours, which distinguishes her work from that of her sisters. Her works tend to be inscribed on the stretcher &#145;Elizabeth Nasmyth&#146;.<br>
<br>The Terrys lived in London at 9 Devonshire Street, Portland Place. A letter of 1832 from Alexander Nasmyth to T. W. Winstanley indicates that Elizabeth stored unsold paintings and helped her father to organize his London life. She also ran art classes with her sister Anne from this address. Correspondence between Daniel Terry and Scott records Elizabeth's difficulty in having children. The couple had three children, Walter Scott Terry (<i>b</i>. 1816), Jane Terry (<i>b</i>. 1821), and Elizabeth Terry (<i>b</i>. 1822). Daniel Terry died after a long struggle with illness and financial difficulty on 12 June 1829. Elizabeth then married the lexicographer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23546/', "Charles Richardson (1775&#150;1865)")</script> on 23 May 1835. They had no children. She died at 9 Charlwood Road, Putney, Surrey, on 10 July 1862 and was buried with her husband in Putney Lower Common cemetery. A lengthy epitaph on her tombstone erected by her broken-hearted husband testifies to a long and happy marriage.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_75555"></a><span class="headword">Anne Gibson Nasmyth</span>  (1798&#150;1874)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 13 November 1798 in Princes Street, St Andrew's parish, Edinburgh. She assisted her sister Elizabeth with classes in her London home and between 1829 and 1838 exhibited sixteen works in the London galleries, including one at the Royal Academy. Her work demonstrates her fondness for highland and sometimes stormy scenery. Her paintings vary from close emulation of her father's style to others reminiscent of Charlotte's (for example, <span class="italic">Windsor</span>, repro. in Johnson and Money). She also produced some precise pictures of small gardens, their conservatories, and plantings, such as <span class="italic">Garden Scene</span> (repro. in Johnson and Money). She signed her work Anne Nasmyth or &#145;A Nasmyth&#146;. When they first set up as engineers in 1831 Anne spent time with her brothers James and George in Manchester. There she met an engineer, William Bennett, whom she married in London at the parish church of St Pancras on 13 August 1838. She was the only one of Alexander Nasmyth's children to follow him to Italy, and spent her honeymoon in Rome. The Bennetts lived first in Leaf Square, Salford, Lancashire, and afterwards moved, in 1851, to Charlwood Road, Putney, where their home became a pivotal point for the Nasmyth daughters and granddaughters. She died on 28 January 1874, having been widowed in 1866, and was buried with her husband beside her four sisters.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_46823"></a><span class="headword">Charlotte Nasmyth</span>  (1804&#150;1884)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 17 February 1804 in York Place, St Andrew's parish, Edinburgh. Apart from her portrait by Andrew Geddes and the titles of her works, there is little trace of her life. A letter home from her brother Patrick records that she first went to London in 1816 with Margaret and Barbara to visit the exhibitions and the theatre and to see the shops and Napoleon's carriage. Of all the sisters her style is the most recognizable: wilder, more rugged and flamboyant, and less picturesque. Sometimes her work is close to that of her father, for example in <span class="italic">Highland Pass</span> (repro. in Johnson and Money), but she developed her own unique style, and worked with a greater freedom and panache than her sisters. Her colouring is natural. She loved painting whitish gnarled tree trunks with an array of broken branches and large-leaved foreground plants, and she depicted wide open spaces without framing trees to either side. She was skilled at figures, animals, and boats, and she painted glorious windy skies. Her own personality comes through in <span class="italic">Hampstead Heath</span> and <span class="italic">Musselburgh</span> (both repro. in Johnson and Money). Her exhibited work shows that she also travelled afield, painting views in Cumberland, the Lake District, Yorkshire, north Wales, Essex, and Surrey, and she painted one foreign view, <span class="italic">The Bay of Naples</span> (exh. Royal Manchester Institution, 1848). She painted a wide variety of subjects including cottages and castles, mountain views and landscapes that appealed to her. She signed her work &#145;Charlotte Nasmyth&#146; or &#145;C Nasmyth&#146; with the date in a tidy copperplate hand. She died on 26 July 1884 at Wood Hall, Putney, Surrey, and was buried in the family plot in Putney Lower Common cemetery.<br>
<br>Their wills indicate that the Nasmyth girls lived comfortably. A few exhibition catalogues from the 1850s which include prices record that most of the sisters received 8 or 10 guineas for their pictures. This would have given them ample income. They were also provided for by their father in his will, dated 1839. James Nasmyth amassed a large fortune and by 1856 had made his unmarried sisters completely independent. As part of a closely knit artistic family, the Nasmyth daughters were a gifted group of women artists. Though they lived, worked, exhibited, and prospered in England, they continued to draw inspiration from their Scottish origins and the landscape of Scotland.<br>
