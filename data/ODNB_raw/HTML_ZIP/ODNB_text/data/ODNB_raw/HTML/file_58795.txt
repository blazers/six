<span class="headword">Gordon,  (Joan) Noel <span class="st"> [No&euml;le]</span></span>  (1919&#150;1985), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 25 December 1919 at 139 Clements Road, East Ham, Essex, the daughter of James Gordon, a marine engineer, and his wife, Joan Yell. Lessons at &#145;Madame Maud&#146; Wells's dancing academy at the age of two led to her first public appearance, at the East Ham Palace. At the same age, she demonstrated another side to her talents by singing &#145;Dear little jammy face&#146; during a masonic ladies' night at the Holborn Restaurant, London.<br>
<br>The dancing lessons stopped when the family moved to Westcliff-on-Sea in Essex. However, when the family later moved to Ilford, nearer London, No&euml;le Gordon attended a convent school that frequently performed plays. Intent on acting, she trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, then joined the Brandon Thomas Players in Edinburgh, and later performed in repertory at the Theatre Royal, Birmingham. In 1938, two years after the BBC launched its regular television service, she made her small-screen d&eacute;but as Norah, the Irish maid, in Eugene O'Neill's <span class="italic">Ah Wilderness!</span>
<br>
<br>The television pioneer John Logie Baird then chose No&euml;le Gordon to take part in his first colour experiment, transmitted from Crystal Palace shortly before the Second World War. After a huge union flag was displayed, she was seen sitting on a chair and trying on an array of different-coloured hats. &#145;Taking part in this experiment was one of the outstanding moments of my life&#146;, she later said  (<span class="italic">TV Times</span>, 14&#150;20 Nov 1981).<br>
<br>Back on stage, No&euml;le Gordon toured in <span class="italic">Black Velvet</span> (by G. Black, M. Dann, and D. Furber) during 1940&#151;replete with a Norman Hartnell dark red satin dress&#151;and made her London West End d&eacute;but in <span class="italic">Let's Face It</span> (by D. and H. Fields, music and lyrics by Cole Porter) at the Hippodrome a year later, after another actress had to withdraw through illness. She played Panache in the musical <span class="italic">The Lisbon Story</span> (by Harold Purcell, music by Harry Parr Davies) at the same theatre and in a 1946 film version, having already made her big-screen d&eacute;but a year earlier as Mrs Wilson in the comedy <span class="italic">29 Acacia Avenue</span> alongside Gordon Harker, Jimmy Hanley, Henry Kendall, and Dinah Sheridan. No&euml;le Gordon also starred on stage with Mae West in her comedy melodrama <span class="italic">Diamond Lil</span>.<br>
<br>In 1949, while beginning an acclaimed two-year, 1000-performance stage run as the village whore, Meg Brockie, in Alan Jay Lerner's <span class="italic">Brigadoon</span>, No&euml;le Gordon was invited to appear in the royal variety performance, singing a medley of Harry Lauder songs, which she dedicated to him at the time when he was dying. She also toured in a 1950s stage production of <span class="italic">Call me Madam</span> (a musical by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, with music and lyrics by Irving Berlin).<br>
<br>Realizing the increasing popularity of television, No&euml;le Gordon studied the medium at a university in New York while also working as a chat show presenter for a small Seattle television station. On returning to Britain, she became adviser on women's programmes to ATV, the newly formed independent television company for the midlands, which began broadcasting in 1956.<br>
<br>No&euml;le Gordon was soon appearing on screen as a presenter, first in the television advertising magazine <span class="italic">Fancy that</span>. Her other programmes included <span class="italic">Week-End</span>, <span class="italic">Tea with No&euml;le Gordon</span>, <span class="italic">Midland Profile</span>, <span class="italic">Midland Sports</span>, <span class="italic">No&euml;le Gordon Takes the Air</span>, <span class="italic">Hi-T!</span>, and, most notably, the midday chat show <span class="italic">Lunch Box</span>, which began in 1957. When Harold Macmillan agreed to appear on <span class="italic">Lunch Box</span>, she became the first woman to interview a prime minister on television. It was at the time of a general election, but they discussed haggis and black pudding.<br>
<br>When Lew Grade, head of ATV, wanted to broadcast a daily serial like those in America, he asked the <span class="italic">Lunch Box</span> producer Reg Watson to come up with an idea. The result was <span class="italic">Crossroads</span>, which started in November 1964 and featured the chat show's presenter in the leading role of Meg Richardson. As a widowed mother running a motel, she became a national institution and was known as the Queen of the Soaps. She stayed with <span class="italic">Crossroads</span> for seventeen years and 3521 performances&#151;winning the <span class="italic">TV Times</span> readers' award for favourite female personality on television eight times&#151;until being sacked in June 1981 in a blaze of publicity when Central Television, which took over the independent television midlands franchise from ATV, tried to revamp the soap opera, which had been under fire from the critics ever since it began, despite winning up to 16 million viewers.<br>
<br>In the storyline, the motel was razed in a fire, but Meg escaped and was seen leaving on the <i>QE II</i> from Southampton to make a new life for herself in America. The actress reappeared in the role briefly in 1983, when her newly married screen daughter Jill and her husband Adam Chance met Meg in Venice during their honeymoon there.<br>
<br>In the mean time, No&euml;le Gordon had carved out a new stage career for herself, starring as Rose in <span class="italic">Gypsy</span> at the Haymarket Theatre, Leicester, in 1981 and appearing in a Middle and Far East tour of <span class="italic">The Boy Friend</span> (by Sandy Wilson), a 1983 London West End production of <span class="italic">Call me Madam</span> at the Victoria Palace, and a British tour of the 1920s musical <span class="italic">No No Nanette</span> (by F. Mandel, O. Harbach, and I. Caesar).<br>
<br>No&euml;le Gordon died from cancer at the Edgbaston Nuffield Hospital, 22 Somerset Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, on 14 April 1985, shortly before she was due to make another brief return to <span class="italic">Crossroads</span>. She was buried beside her mother in Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire. No&euml;le Gordon never married, although she had a twenty-year relationship with the show business impresario <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56615/', "Val Parnell (1892&#150;1972)")</script>. Her autobiography, <span class="italic">My Life at Crossroads</span>, was published in 1975.<br>
