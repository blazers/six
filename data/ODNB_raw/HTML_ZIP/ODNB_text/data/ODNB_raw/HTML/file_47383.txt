<span class="headword">Filder,  William</span>  (1789&#150;1861), <span class="occ">commissary officer</span>, seems to have spent his whole professional career in the civilian commissariat department, an entrant to which officially began as a clerk before advancing through the rank structure. Filder's origins are obscure. Some secondary sources call him James, and it is highly likely that he was the James Filder born at 10 White Street, Bethnal Green, London, to Emily (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Whiter) and an unnamed &#145;leather cutter&#146;. When the birth was registered on 20 November, Emily lived at 43 Kelsey Street, Bethnal Green. William Filder first appears in surviving records as an assistant commissary-general (captain equivalent) on 10 August 1811, and he served in that rank throughout the Peninsular War to gain the war medal and nine clasps for Talavera, Albuera, Salamanca, Vitoria, Pyrenees, Nivelle, Nive, Orthez, and Toulouse. However, the battle of Talavera was in July 1809, which suggests that he held an unrecorded lower rank before 1811. Promoted on 22 October 1816, Filder served as deputy commissary-general (major equivalent for three years, then lieutenant-colonel) until going on half pay in 1832. He returned to full pay a year later, and advanced to commissary-general (brigadier-general) on 1 July 1840 when appointed to the West Indies. He moved to Canada in 1843, where he seems to have stayed for seven years, before going on half pay again with his appointment as CB (17 August 1850).<br>
<br>In 1854 with war imminent, Sir Charles Trevelyan, Treasury assistant secretary and head of the commissariat, reappointed Filder to full pay as commissary-general in command of the commissariat &#145;attached&#146; to Lord Raglan's &#145;eastern army&#146;, the Crimean expeditionary force, not therefore under Raglan's command. According to departmental practice, Filder placed contracts for supplies and transport in or near the theatre of war, not a reliable practice. Once the British had moved from near Constantinople to Bulgaria he asked Raglan for military escorts to prevent desertion of native drivers. It became clear, too, that the commissariat had insufficient personnel and many of them lacked field experience. When the troops landed in the Crimea in September 1854 the commissariat issued them no sugar, but supplied green coffee which they could neither roast nor grind. Filder's problems multiplied, especially when Sevastopol did not fall swiftly and siege operations were begun from upland to the south. A rough track, running almost 7 miles from the tiny port of Balaklava and climbing 700 feet onto the heights, provided Filder's only means of getting supplies to the camps and trenches. The commissariat could not cope, and broke down under the strain. It failed to deliver vital supplies to the troops in the field, causing suffering and death. Without resources in the Crimea, Filder requisitioned supplies from Turkey, the Mediterranean shores, and Britain. William Howard Russell, war correspondent of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, noted that in October Filder's efforts to establish reserves of &#145;food, corn and forage&#146; with each division failed because transport was diverted to carry shot and shell. On 8 November Raglan informed Filder the army would be staying in the Crimea during the winter, and that he should make provision accordingly. Five days later Filder warned that Balaklava would be inadequate as a permanent supply base and the track to the upland would be impassable in bad weather. Next day, 14 November, a hurricane devastated the area.<br>
<br>Filder faced sharp criticism. Raglan and other army officers repeatedly complained of him and his department. Major-General J. B. B. Estcourt referred to &#145;the rotten mess of Trevelyan's pet Commissariat&#146;  (Sweetman, <span class="italic">Raglan</span>, 268); Colonel McMurdo of the Land Transport Corps stated of Filder, &#145;I never &hellip; met so disagreeable a coxcomb and so utterly impracticable an official as this little viper&#146;  (Sweetman, <span class="italic">War and Administration</span>, 55&#150;6). Senior government ministers including the duke of Newcastle, Sidney Herbert, and lords Panmure and Palmerston called repeatedly for Filder's removal. In June 1855 Sir John McNeill and Colonel A. Tulloch, sent to the Crimea to investigate the commissariat, strongly condemned him. Yet the commissary-general did not entirely lack support. Towards the end of 1854 Russell believed Filder deserved &#145;the greatest praise for his exertions&#146; and did not warrant the &#145;base calumnies&#146; directed at him  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 8 Nov 1854). In the new year Raglan defended Filder against ministerial onslaughts, noting that by the end of January 1855, a month in which the first roasted (as distinct from green) coffee arrived, only a single hay shipment had come from England instead of the promised fortnightly vessel. A floating bakery, also expected, had not even set out by March.<br>
<br>Filder left the Crimea at the close of July 1855 and subsequently answered McNeill and Tulloch's charges in detail: failure to send hay and chopped straw had been crucial, urgent requests for supplies had been ignored in England, and Turkish contractors had persistently failed him. In 1856 a board of general officers declared that he &#145;was not, and is not, justly liable to the unfavourable animadversion, either expressed or implied&#146; of &#145;the management of his department&#146;  (Sweetman, <span class="italic">War and Administration</span>, 57). He had, thus, apparently been vindicated for his efforts under difficult circumstances in the Crimea, from which he emerged with a campaign medal and four clasps (Alma, Balaklava, Inkerman, Sevastopol), plus the order of the Mejidiye, 3rd class. Early in 1857 he went on half pay for the last time. Filder had a residence at 57 Eaton Square, London, but on 9 December 1861 he died at St John's (parish of Wittycombe Raleigh), Exmouth. According to the death certificate, he had been suffering from consumption (tuberculosis) for &#145;some months&#146; and asthma &#145;some years&#146;. He was survived by his wife, Anne, and daughter, Charlotte Barbara.<br>
