<span class="headword">Veitch <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Fairlie]</span>,  Marion</span>  (1639&#150;1722), <span class="occ">diarist</span>, was born in Edinburgh and baptized in the abbey kirk of Holyroodhouse in the Canongate in Edinburgh on 20 December 1639, the daughter of James Fairlie (<i>b</i>. 1606), an Edinburgh shoemaker, and his wife, Euphan Kincaid. When she was six she went to live with relatives in the parish of Lanark, where she grew up and was probably educated privately. She married the Presbyterian minister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28174/', "William Veitch (1640&#150;1722)")</script>, in the High Kirk of Lanark on 23 November 1664, after which the couple moved to the nearby village of Dunsyre. The marriage produced five daughters and five sons, among them the future governor of Nova Scotia <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28261/', "Samuel Vetch")</script>.<br>
<br>William Veitch was constantly harassed by the authorities, often away from his family for long periods, living under a false name and sometimes even in exile abroad. As a result Marion's life was one of frequent moves, and she was out of Scotland for many years. While in England she lived at Hanham Hall, Northumberland (1672&#150;7), Stanton Hall in the same county (1677&#150;85), and Newcastle (1685&#150;8), sometimes with and sometimes without her husband. With the restoration of presbyterianism in Scotland by the revolution of 1688, the Veitches' lives became easier, and William was called as minister to Peebles and later Dumfries, where the couple lived until their deaths.<br>
<br>Marion Veitch kept a journal, which covered her life from her marriage to her later years in Dumfries, and which was printed for the Free Church of Scotland in Edinburgh in 1846. It describes the affairs of herself and her family, and provides an interesting insight into the thought of a dedicated covenanting presbyterian at a time when the kirk was suffering its greatest persecution. Marion died at Dumfries on 9 May 1722, one day after her husband, and was buried with him in the same grave in St Michael's Church in Dumfries.<br>
