<span class="headword">Thorpe,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1381&#150;1407), <span class="occ">Lollard preacher</span>, seems to have been a Yorkshireman. Documentary evidence concerning his life is scant, but in a letter of the north-country heretic Richard Wyche, written <i>c</i>.1402 but surviving only in a Bohemian copy, there is mentioned a sister &#145;domini Wilhelmi Corpp&#146; resident at that time in Topcliffe in the North Riding of Yorkshire; &#145;Corpp&#146; may reasonably be identified with Thorpe, whose origins were probably in the same area. In March 1395 a William Thorpe was instituted to the vicarage of Marske in Cleveland, a living in the gift of the Augustinian canons of Guisborough, by Thomas Arundel (<i>d</i>. 1414), then archbishop of York. The identification is not entirely certain, but a more secure link is provided by the six charges of erroneous preaching in London brought against a William Thorpe by three priests before Bishop Robert Braybrooke some time between January 1382 and June 1386. The outcome is unclear, though Thorpe's reply to the charges survives; a later note states that he was excommunicated because of his failure to recant. Later evidence for Thorpe is provided by a recently discovered writ, dated 16 June 1407, requiring the bailiffs of Shrewsbury to produce him before the chancellor, Archbishop Thomas Arundel, at Westminster; Thorpe, together with an associate, John Pollyrbache, had been imprisoned following his preaching of three conclusions (listed on the schedule attached to the document, and covering images, pilgrimages, and the withholding of tithes) at St Chad's Church in Shrewsbury on 17 April.<br>
<br>Beyond these documentary details, the chief source for Thorpe's life (though its bias is clear, and its reliability can only be ascertained in part) is the account, claimed to be autobiographical, of an informal examination of Thorpe by Arundel on 7 August 1407. No record of this, or of any case against Thorpe, appears in Arundel's register, though the date is compatible with the evidence for Thorpe's arrest. According to Thorpe, after forceful persuasion by family and friends to continue his education for the priesthood, he went, apparently before mid-1381, to Oxford to join John Wyclif (<i>d</i>. 1384) and his adherents; there he enthusiastically embraced their radical views. When he left Oxford is not made clear. Allusion is made to a period of preaching in the north; this could indicate that the incumbent of Marske was indeed the same man. Arundel, in Thorpe's story, reminds him that he had been arrested by Bishop Braybrooke, and that he had been set free on Arundel's own exile in 1397; Thorpe maintains that he had been released because no valid charge against him had been found. The date of Braybrooke's arrest of Thorpe is unspecified; difficulties arise over the chronological relation of this episode to the Marske institution.<br>
<br>Thorpe's conversation with the archbishop, in his account, dealt with five errors alleged against him by the Shrewsbury officials: the three mentioned in the legal document, together with the error of maintaining that bread exists after the consecration in the eucharist and that oaths are unlawful. The encounter, according to Thorpe, ended with his own implacable resolution to stand by his views, without judgment from Arundel, though with Thorpe's relegation to the archbishop's prison. How Thorpe's account was put into circulation is entirely obscure: one early fifteenth-century English copy survives, together with two Bohemian copies of a Latin version. The English text was known to Lollard suspects from the 1490s to the 1520s, before it was put into print <i>c</i>.1530 (probably from the Antwerp press of Hans Luft, <span class="italic">STC 1475&#150;1640</span>, no. 24045). At the end of this appears &#145;The testamente of William Thorpe&#146;, dated 20 September 1460; there are obvious chronological difficulties in accepting this, and the otherwise impersonal document may originally have had no connection with Thorpe. The other works later ascribed to him by John Bale reflect Bale's deductions from references within Thorpe's autobiography, and not direct evidence.<br>
<br>The views that Thorpe was accused of holding in the 1380s, and that he defended then and in 1407, are typical of early Lollardy and for the most part derive directly from Wyclif's own teaching. They cover the eucharist, images, pilgrimages, oaths, tithes, scripture, preaching, oral confession and sacerdotal absolution, and the right of the laity to correct erring clerics. In the autobiography Thorpe's admiration for Wyclif's learning and for his upright life is undiminished, and is accompanied by strong deprecation for the turncoat activities of Philip Repyndon and Nicholas Hereford. The picture given of Archbishop Arundel&#151;often angry, frequently obtuse himself, and outwitted by the ever reasonable and ingenious Thorpe&#151;makes the account of their conversation an unusually lively and attractive piece of Lollard propaganda.<br>
