<span class="headword">Okham,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1327/8), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, is of unknown origins. He is first recorded in 1296, as a clerk in the king's wardrobe, where much of his career was to be spent, and of which by June 1308 he had been promoted to be cofferer. He held that office until July 1309, and again from February 1311 to September 1314. Okham appears to have aroused considerable distrust, for the second set of ordinances of 1311 demanded that he be dismissed. However, the demand was ignored by Edward II; Okham attended the king when he withdrew to Yorkshire at the end of that year, and apparently accompanied him to France in 1313. Only in 1314, after Edward's position had been weakened by defeat at Bannockburn, was Okham obliged to leave the royal household. But once the king began to recover lost ground Okham returned to office; on 18 June 1317 he was appointed a baron of the exchequer, and was subsequently exempted by name from attempts to reduce the number of barons. He was paid as a baron until Easter 1320. He was not disgraced, for having been summoned to parliaments as a royal councillor in 1318 and 1320 he was summoned again in the same capacity in 1321 and 1322.<br>
<br>In January 1324 Okham was called upon to account for wardrobe receipts from the beginning of the reign, a move in the current programme of exchequer reform, and not a sign of animosity towards him&#151;in 1325 he was given custody of the deanship of St Martin's-le-Grand, London, where he was already a canon. There is no evidence that he became a priest, however, although he had been ordained acolyte in 1309. By then he had been presented by the king to West Horsley church, Hampshire, to which he added Broad Chalk, Wiltshire, in 1312 and Nether Wallop, Hampshire, in 1314. His wealth, whether derived from office or from his livings, enabled him to make some substantial loans, suggesting that the mistrust felt for him by the ordainers may have been due to suspicions of corruption, as well as of undue influence with the king.<br>
<br>Following the deposition of Edward II the new regime made further efforts to scrutinize earlier wardrobe receipts, which in 1327 led to Okham's being ordered to attend in the exchequer and answer for money that had passed through his hands. He was to die in debt to the king, but no evidence appears to have been found that he had been guilty of embezzlement. Okham was probably still alive on 20 July 1327, but had died by 27 October 1328, leaving goods and chattels valued at &pound;114 18<i>s</i>. They may have included the book (a work on the art of <i>dictamen</i>, or epistolary composition) that in 1311 he lent to a colleague in the wardrobe, specifying that it was to be returned within a week and paid for with a goose; if held for longer, interest was to be payable not in money but in geese, at the rate of one per week.<br>
