<span class="headword">Peacham,  Edmund</span>  (1553/4&#150;1616), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and traitor</span>, was born in Barton, Northamptonshire. Nothing is known about his parents or early life. He matriculated at the age of twenty-one as a sizar at Christ's College, Cambridge, in June 1575. He was ordained deacon in London in 1580 and priest the following year. In 1581 he was appointed vicar of Ridge, Hertfordshire. On 15 July 1587 Peacham was presented by the noted puritan Sir Amias Paulet to the rectory of Hinton St George in Somerset; there he remained until his death in 1616.<br>
<br>Peacham married Katherine Ballie (<i>bap</i>. 1576), from Devon, at Hinton St George on 26 August 1607. He was her senior by twenty-two years and the couple remained childless. He shared the puritan convictions of his patron, and conducted his ministerial duties in Somerset without any known scandal or controversy. Somewhat surprisingly this provincial cleric became embroiled in direct opposition to the policies of the government of James VI and I. Indeed, his actions and the views he expressed from the pulpit transcended the spiritual sphere of his ministerial calling. Peacham's activities brought him into conflict with the civil authorities. His intentions may have been treasonable, as he began to express more extreme ideas, or imprudent, perhaps both. As early as 1603 he was accused of preaching against the new king, the privy council, episcopate, and judiciary. On this occasion no action was taken against him, but his hostility towards the king's religious policies, including James's support for the bishops, coolness towards puritans and presbyterians, and demand for greater uniformity of worship, meant that he began to speak out against the ecclesiastical polity again in 1608. This reaction was triggered by the appointment of James Montagu as bishop of Bath and Wells. Peacham openly attacked Montagu from the pulpit, resulting in a reprimand in the consistory court. This failed to dissuade him from attacking the bishop and he continued to do so intermittently over the next six years.<br>
<br>In 1614 Peacham further estranged himself from the ecclesiastical authorities by refusing to subscribe to the required benevolence, claiming insufficient means but promising to pray for the king. Meanwhile, resenting the reprimand suffered at the hands of Montagu, he circulated in private a manuscript seriously questioning the bishop's character. In December 1614 Peacham was arrested by the court of high commission on a complaint brought against him by Montagu; he was convicted of libel and deprived of his clerical orders. A search for further evidence of his writings against Montagu revealed a sermon in Peacham's hand, in which he denounced the king, and foretold his death as divine judgment for the actions of the privy council and episcopate. He also wrote that rebellion would probably ensue. James was understandably alarmed when news reached him of the sermon, which though it was never preached seemed to trigger fears of a treasonous plot. The turn of events for Peacham was certainly unforeseen, but worse awaited him, when the king attempted to secure evidence of his treason. On 19 January 1615 Sir Francis Bacon, attorney-general, Henry Montagu (brother of James Montagu), king's serjeant, and the officers of the Tower of London had Peacham tortured. During this interrogation Peacham remained silent. The recourse to torture in such a case of suspected treason was defended by Bacon, setting the legal maxim that torture could be used &#145;for discovery and not for evidence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Francis Bacon</span>, 3.114). The opposition of the Somerset gentry towards the benevolence in 1614 fuelled fears of a wider plot and the apparently ruthless interrogation of the suspect was intended to detect the extent of the threat to James.<br>
<br>The critical legal issue was whether Peacham should be tried for high treason. In an attempt to clarify this matter Bacon separately consulted the judges before the indictment was made against Peacham. His words were deemed to convey treasonable intent. Sir Edward Coke, chief justice of the king's bench, dissented from this position by asserting that a written attack on the king must &#145;disable his title&#146; in order to be treasonable. Coke also protested against the canvassing of the judges in the matter. The deciding factor was the king's personal desire to pursue the case, based on his continued animosity towards Peacham.<br>
<br>Peacham desperately sought to stall the case against him. First he implicated Paulet, and then his patron's brother-in-law, Sir John Sydenham, who were both cleared of complicity after being summoned to appear before the privy council. Finally he suggested that the controversial sermon notes had been the work of his namesake, a contemporary writer, Henry Peacham. In July Edmund Peacham stood trial in Taunton, Somerset, charged with high treason. He was arraigned before Sir Christopher Tanfield and Henry Montagu. James sent Sir Henry Yelverton, solicitor-general, and Sir Randolph Crewe, lord chief justice of the king's bench, to conduct the case for the crown. Peacham was duly found guilty and condemned to death. On 31 August he apparently admitted writing the sermon. No evidence was ever found to substantiate a wider conspiracy against the king. The sentence against him was never carried out because it was not considered politically expedient.<br>
<br>Peacham died of natural causes in gaol in Taunton on 27 March 1616. The writer John Chamberlain alleged that he left behind an even worse sermon than he had previously written; the story may be apocryphal, but it conveys a sense of the contempt shown towards him. He was certainly guilty of treason. In his disagreement with the ecclesiastical policies of James he became dangerously politicized, hardened as he was by many years of personal opposition to James Montagu. No contemporary puritan tried to defend Peacham's actions, nor did any later question the legitimacy of the proceedings against him. None of his writings have been preserved. His infamy is based on other accounts of his political views as expressed in sermons. These views crossed the boundary between church and state, and the finest legal minds of the day were called upon to protect the person of the king. Their zeal in doing so, involving the use of torture and ignoring the objections of Coke, reveal something about the climate of political fear in Jacobean England as well as highlighting the wasted and blighted clerical career of Peacham.<br>
