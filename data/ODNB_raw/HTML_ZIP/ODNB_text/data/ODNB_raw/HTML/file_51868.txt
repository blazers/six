<span class="headword">Elworthy,  (Samuel) Charles</span>, Baron Elworthy  (1911&#150;1993), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born on 23 March 1911 at Gordon's valley, Timaru, New Zealand, the second of five children and the elder son of Percy Ashton Elworthy, a sheep farmer, and his wife, Bertha Victoria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Julius. The family later moved to England. Elworthy attended Marlborough College and subsequently read law at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was captain of the boat club and twice a trial cap. He graduated in 1933, was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1935, and on 5 June 1936 married Audrey (1910&#150;1986), the daughter of Arthur Joseph Hutchinson, a company director; they had three sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>An enthusiastic pilot in the Auxiliary Air Force, Elworthy (known as Sam by friends and family, but as Charles more generally) changed career in 1936 and took a permanent commission in the RAF. A year flying Hawker Harts and Hinds with 15 squadron at Abingdon was followed in November 1937 by appointment as aide-de-camp to Sir Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt, commander-in-chief of Bomber Command&#151;a remarkable acknowledgement in one so young of the talents that would eventually take him to the top. He was thus able to observe the strengths and weaknesses of one of the RAF's most senior commanders, to appreciate the huge problems facing the bomber force as war approached, and to gain an inside view of the events of the time, notably the Munich crisis.<br>
<br>In January 1939 Elworthy returned to flying, building up a new operational training unit for the Blenheim bomber (for which he received the Air Force Cross) and then commanding 82 (Blenheim) squadron operating over north-west Europe during late 1940 and early 1941; this earned him the DFC and DSO, whose citation stated that, &#145;by his magnificent leadership and complete disregard of danger, he brought his squadron to the highest peak of war efficiency&#146;. Now it was back to the headquarters of Bomber Command, where in 1942, as group captain operations, he won the trust of the new commander-in-chief, Sir Arthur Harris. There followed a year in charge of one of the command's most important stations, Waddington, after which Harris chose Elworthy as his representative with the headquarters of General Eisenhower for operation Overlord. Elworthy finished his war as senior air staff officer (SASO) at 5 group.<br>
<br>Elworthy remained in the bomber world for two more years, now at the central bombing establishment at Marham, leading the development of bombing tactics, before going to India as SASO of 2 (Indian) group. After independence he was seconded to the new Pakistan Air Force. In 1949 he attended the Staff College at Camberley and went on to serve on the personnel staff in the Air Ministry. In 1951 he entered the fighter world, first commanding the Meteor station at Tangmere, next Odiham, at the time of the queen's coronation review, and finally the metropolitan sector of Fighter Command at North Weald. In 1957 he became commandant of the Bracknell Staff College, which provided a good opportunity for bringing himself up to date on the major issues of RAF policy arising from the Sandys defence review and led to his appointment to the Air Council as deputy chief of air staff in November 1959.<br>
<br>Elworthy did not stay long. In July 1960&#151;at the specific instance of Lord Mountbatten, chief of defence staff&#151;he became commander-in-chief of the first post-war integrated command, British forces Arabian peninsula, soon to be retitled Middle East command. In due course, despite considerable single-service resistance, a remarkable degree of co-operation was achieved between the three services and the civilian administration. The contingency planning which Elworthy had also set in train paid off in July 1961 after Iraq had renewed its long-standing claim to Kuwait and massed a large armoured force on the frontier. In operation Vantage, Elworthy quickly moved major reinforcements in from Aden and elsewhere, and the Iraqi army stayed put. It was an object lesson in deterrence. By the time Elworthy departed in 1963 the unified command had been severely tested, both operationally and administratively, and its efficiency gave proof of his talents for achieving harmony between the three services and handling the political intricacies.<br>
<br>It was another story in Whitehall, where Elworthy returned in September 1963 as chief of air staff. Here he encountered entrenched attitudes and constant controversy, though he and Denis Healey, the Labour government's defence secretary for most of his time there, had great respect for each other and generally got on well together. Much time was devoted to future aircraft purchases, and a major issue that came to a head in 1964, soon after the Labour Party's election victory, was the future of the tactical strike and reconnaissance aircraft (TSR2) by which the RAF had hitherto set great store. Elworthy was becoming increasingly worried that its costs seemed to be running out of control and at risk of draining dry the RAF budget, and he agreed to its cancellation on the firm understanding that the American F111 strike aircraft would be ordered instead. The HS 681 transport aircraft he also saw as ambitious and over-extravagant, and this was dropped in favour of the American C130, the future Hercules. Thus ended the peacetime policy of always buying British military aircraft; here was the realist at work. One major British project that did survive was the Harrier, destined to fill a long-term place in Britain's armoury.<br>
<br>Another of Elworthy's preoccupations was Britain's worldwide role, especially east of Suez. The confrontation with Indonesia demanded much attention; it provided a stern reminder of how far all three services were now stretched and caused much debate on how far such distant commitments should be retained and by what means. Among such issues was the aircraft-carrier controversy, which led to the resignation in 1966 of Sir David Luce, the first sea lord; Elworthy, though not opposed to large carriers <i>per se</i>, thought it no longer practicable to provide sufficient of these and was convinced that the job must be done in other ways. Other major matters were the evacuation from Aden and the possibility of military intervention in Rhodesia, which he strongly opposed. More domestic concerns included the withdrawal of Britain's first V-bomber, the Valiant, the planned reorganization of the RAF's home command structure, and the decision to end the cadet entry at the RAF College, Cranwell, in favour of graduate entrants, a switch he thought essential in the light of changing patterns of national education.<br>
<br>In April 1967 Elworthy became chief of defence staff, where over the next few years he exercised much influence on defence policy under both Denis Healey and Lord Carrington. This was in his view a period of great and alarming Soviet expansion, marked particularly by the Czechoslovak crisis of 1968, and he accompanied Healey to many of the NATO meetings where the new policy of flexible response was being worked out. Several times he visited Northern Ireland, where the emergency was beginning to cause severe problems, particularly for the army and its garrison in Germany. In 1968 the order for the F111 was cancelled against the advice of the air staff; this flew in the face of the assurances Elworthy had previously received when the TSR2 was abandoned, and both he and Healey seriously considered resignation. On more positive notes, however, the nuclear deterrent was successfully transferred from the V-bomber force to the Polaris submarines, planning was started for the multi-role combat aircraft, the future Tornado, the military salary was introduced, and the position of the chief of defence staff was gradually strengthened.<br>
<br>Elworthy departed the national scene in 1971, after eight years at the heart of military affairs. He had been much criticized for not having made a firmer stand over some of the cutbacks being demanded by the politicians, but in retrospect hard choices were unavoidable. The political and economic circumstances of the 1960s had compelled strong measures to contain Britain's defence spending and commitments, and Elworthy had never hesitated to take on the politicians and civil servants in the attempt to secure the best deal he could. For him &#145;the art of the possible&#146; was always the final guideline.<br>
<br>Ennobled in 1972 as Baron Elworthy of Timaru, the first RAF officer to be thus honoured since the high wartime commanders, Elworthy spent the next seven years as constable and governor of Windsor Castle. He became knight of the Garter in 1977, and he also served as lord lieutenant of Greater London and held several academic and business appointments. In 1978 he returned to Gordon's valley, in his native New Zealand, where he spent the rest of his life, visiting Britain annually to attend the Garter ceremony and perform duties as a steward at Henley Royal Regatta. Elworthy died at Christchurch, New Zealand, on 4 April 1993. He was cremated and his ashes were returned to Gordon's valley. He was one of the most distinguished of the RAF's chiefs, a man who, as both chief of air staff and chief of defence staff, was held in the highest regard and respect by service colleagues and politicians alike during the years when the United Kingdom came to accept that she was no longer a world power.<br>
