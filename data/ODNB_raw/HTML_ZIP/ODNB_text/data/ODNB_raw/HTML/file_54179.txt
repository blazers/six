<span class="headword">Eglinton, Sir  Hugh</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1376), <span class="occ">courtier and poet</span>, came from Ayrshire. Little is known of his early life and career, but he was probably one of five men knighted by David II in 1342, before an ill-fated raid into England, where all five were captured. He was certainly back in Scotland by 1348, when he received the relief of Meldrum, Aberdeenshire, from Robert Stewart (<i>d</i>. 1390). Despite the political rivalry which existed between King David and his heir presumptive, Eglinton appears to have prospered under both men. He was justiciar of Lothian in 1361 and six years later was named in an indenture as one of the commissioners appointed to keep order in the marches. Between 1358 and 1369 he received seven safe conducts to travel to England; he accompanied Sir Archibald Douglas (<i>d</i>. 1400) to Canterbury in 1359, presumably on a pilgrimage there. Eglinton was made bailie of Cunningham, Ayrshire, by Robert Stewart in 1367 and, following Stewart's succession as Robert II in 1371, he became a close counsellor of the king; from 1372 to 1375 he also served as an auditor of the accounts, a position which brought him into contact with John Barbour (<i>d</i>. 1395), author of <span class="italic">The Bruce</span>. He remained in regular receipt of fees and payments, some of them very substantial, until his death in 1376.<br>
<br>Eglinton was probably married twice, first to Agnes More, sister of William More of Abercorn, Linlithgowshire, and the likely mother of his daughter, Elizabeth, who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19062/', "John Montgomery of Eaglesham")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54294/', "Montgomery family")</script>]. His second marriage, to Egidia Stewart, half-sister of Robert II, occurred about 1365, when he was recorded as receiving one-third of his wife's annuity in respect of her former husband, James (or David) Lindsay.<br>
<br>Eglinton's literary reputation stems from the reference to &#145;The Gude Syr Hew of Eglintoun&#146; found in William Dunbar's &#145;Lament for the Makaris&#146; (1505&times;8). The fact that Eglinton is the first in Dunbar's basically chronological list of Scottish vernacular poets, before the unknown &#145;Heryot&#146; and Andrew Wyntoun (<i>c</i>.1350&#150;<i>c</i>.1422), lends credence to the suggestion that the two are identical. Much less convincing are the attempts to link Eglinton with the mysterious <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14021/', "Hucheon of the Awyle Ryale")</script> mentioned in Wyntoun's <span class="italic">Original Chronicle</span>, for the works which the chronicler attributes to Hucheon (two Arthurian gestes and a tale from the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span>) have been most plausibly identified as being of English provenance. Moreover it is unlikely that Wyntoun would have mentioned Eglinton elsewhere (as he does) without making the connection explicit. If, however, Dunbar's estimation of Eglinton's literary worth can be accepted, it offers important evidence for the cultural life of fourteenth-century Scotland. Chronicle tradition credits David II with a passion for chivalry, and it is tempting to speculate that Eglinton's compositions contributed to the chivalric ethos of his court. Whatever his subject matter, Eglinton was probably the first significant lay poet of the Scottish language.<br>
