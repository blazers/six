<span class="headword">Malham,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1747, <em>d.</em> 1821), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and writer</span>, was baptized on 14 June 1747 at Burnsall, near Skipton in Craven, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the son of Robert Malham. He had at least one brother, Robert, who was baptized on 7 August 1749, and he was educated at Skipton grammar school. In 1768 he ran a school and corresponded on mathematical subjects in the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span>. He then took holy orders and served a curacy in Northamptonshire. In 1781 he returned to teaching, and in the following year published the first of many educational works: <span class="italic">The Schoolmaster's Complete Companion and Scholar's Universal Guide to Arithmetic</span>. By September 1790 he was living in The Square, Plymouth Dock, as a &#145;teacher of navigation and the classics&#146;, as he described himself in his <span class="italic">Navigation Made Easy and Familiar</span> (1790). In 1792 he vainly petitioned John Pitt, second earl of Chatham, then first lord of the Admiralty, for a naval chaplaincy. His publications at this period included revisions of textbooks by Daniel Fenning, a collection of sermons addressed to seamen, and a naval gazetteer.<br>
<br>About 1798 Malham settled in Salisbury, where he served as chaplain to the county gaol and curate of St Edmund's, and worked as a corrector of the press. He joined in the local controversy about itinerant preaching&#151;between the dissenters and the bishop of Salisbury, John Douglas&#151;that had been sparked off by Douglas's charge to his clergy in summer 1798. After loyally defending his bishop in <span class="italic">A Broom for the Conventicle, or, The Arguments for Village Preaching Examined</span> (1798) Malham was presented to the vicarage of Hilton, Dorset, on 30 April 1801. Almost immediately he published a pamphlet on clerical non-residence to demonstrate that country clergymen could not afford to reside on their livings, as their current stipends were too low. In an earlier pamphlet he had bemoaned the poverty of curates. His conscience clear, he moved to London, where he found work in the book trade. He continued to write, principally on religious and educational subjects, and grew more ambitious in his projects. He published a life of Christ and a revised edition of Foxe's <span class="italic">Book of Martyrs</span>, both of which were illustrated, and spent three years on his final work, an impressive folio published in 1816 as <span class="italic">The grand national history of England, civil and ecclesiastical, from the earliest period of genuine record to the year 1816</span>. He died near London on 19 September 1821.<br>
