<span class="headword">Young, Sir  William</span>  (1751&#150;1821), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 16 August 1751, the eldest of five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30265/', "James Young (1717&#150;1789)")</script>, naval officer, and his first wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bolton (<i>d</i>. before 1762). He also had a half-brother and a half-sister. He was descended from a long-established Devon family, the Yonges of Puslinch. A quarrel between brothers in the late seventeenth century (about Charles I's execution) changed the spelling of the name of the branch of the family from which William Young was descended. He entered the navy in April 1761 as captain's servant to Mark Milbanke in the <i>Guernsey</i> (50 guns). In December 1762 he was moved to the <i>Wasp</i> (8 guns), a two-masted sloop, but in October 1764 he returned to the <i>Guernsey</i>, now under Commodore Hugh Palliser. Young passed his examination on 10 January 1769 and was promoted lieutenant, at Plymouth, into the <i>Nautilus</i> (16 guns) on 12 November 1770. On 21 May 1771 he was made fourth lieutenant in the <i>Trident</i> (64 guns), Sir Peter Denis's flagship in the Mediterranean. Nearly four years later, on 23 January 1775, he became third lieutenant in the <i>Portland</i> (50 guns), flagship of Vice-Admiral James Young at the Leeward Islands. The American War of Independence now speeded promotion and on 10 May 1777 Young was given command of the sloop <i>Snake</i>. This was confirmed on 23 September 1778 and the same day he was promoted captain of the <i>Hind</i> (24 guns). He served in her until 15 April 1782, when he moved to the <i>Ambuscade</i> (32 guns) until the peace in 1783. Peacetime employment was always uncertain but Young possessed sufficient influence and merit to command the <i>Perseverance</i> (36 guns) from October 1787, and the <i>Crescent</i> (36 guns) from 10 May until November 1790.<br>
<br>On 31 January 1793 Young was appointed to the <i>Fortitude</i> (74 guns) before going to the Mediterranean in Lord Hood's fleet, and taking part in the occupation of Toulon. After its evacuation, in December 1793 Hood determined to gain a base in Corsica. Based at Porto Ferrajo, in Elba, he detached a small squadron, under Commodore Linzee, of three ships of the line and two frigates, escorting troops under Major-General Dundas, to Mortella Bay in Corsica. The squadron arrived on 7 February 1794, and next day two of the ships, the <i>Fortitude</i> and <i>Juno</i> (32 guns), were part of a combined attempt to take a small tower on a promontory in Mortella Bay, immediately south of Pointe de la Mortella, on the north-west Corsican coast. This was necessary if the bay was to be safe as an anchorage. But the well-placed tower, though possessed of only one 24-pounder gun, was too strong for the ships to destroy. Instead they suffered heavy losses. After a bombardment of over two hours the <i>Fortitude</i> had been set on fire by red-hot shot and forced to retreat with six men killed and fifty-six wounded. The tower was taken only by guns from a commanding position above, on shore. This incident prompted an exaggerated belief in the strength of such towers and numbers were built on the south coast of England as an anti-invasion device, under the name &#145;martello towers&#146;.<br>
<br>Young was in the inconclusive actions between the British and French fleets of 14 March 1794 and 13 July 1795 off Hy&egrave;res and returned to England with a convoy in the autumn. He had been awarded the honorary rank of colonel of marines on 4 July 1794 and was promoted rear-admiral of the white on 1 June 1795. From 20 November of that year until 19 February 1801 he was a member of the Board of Admiralty. As such he was one of the committee of conciliation which visited Portsmouth in April 1797 during the Spithead mutiny. Although Young took an orthodox view of these events his letters to Captain Charles Morice Pole reveal some sympathy with the seamen's grievances and an attempt to try to influence seamen's views by allowing the calculated conversations of officers, contrasting the situation of British with the wretched state of French seamen, to be deliberately overheard. But Young was shocked by the &#145;total want of confidence the seamen have shewn in their officers, a circumstance so new that I never remember to have heard of anything like it&#146;  (Young to Pole, 8 May 1797). He thought many officers showed &#145;a sad want of energy and of particular attention to duty which the government of large bodies of men requires especially in these times and an absent or indifferent man can produce incalculable mischief&#146;  (Young to Pole, 22 June 1797) and while at the Admiralty he strove to improve conditions and tighten discipline. He was made vice-admiral of the blue on 14 February 1799 and vice-admiral of the white on 1 January 1801. Admiral Sir William Hotham, who had earlier served with him, thought Young, while at the Admiralty, &#145;diligent in application, clear in method and generally informed&#146;  (Stirling, 1.59<i>n</i>) and Young's letters bear this out.<br>
<br>On 23 April 1804 Young was promoted vice-admiral of the red and a few weeks later, on 18 May, he was appointed commander-in-chief at Plymouth, a position he held until 1807. Here he was accused by Lord Cochrane of excessive greed for prize money, but as commander-in-chief Young's claims to issue orders to warships sailing from Plymouth accorded with naval practice and the issue of prize money caused frequent bitter disputes between naval officers. Young was promoted admiral of the blue on 9 November 1805 but the ill health and tiredness he mentions in his letters in the autumn of 1806 probably explain his unemployment in the following years. In July 1809 he was the senior admiral at the board of the court martial on James, Lord Gambier. Lord Cochrane accused Young of undue bias in Gambier's favour but Cochrane himself was hardly impartial. He had already clashed with Young over prize money and when elected MP for Westminster in 1807 had accused Young of inefficiency in fitting out ships at Plymouth. During the court martial Young objected to Cochrane's discursive answers and attempted detailed explanations of his actions, but he seems to have been no more hostile than other members of the board.<br>
<br>Young was promoted admiral of the white on 31 July 1810 and in the spring of 1811 he was appointed to command of the North Sea Fleet, arriving at the Downs on 26 April and immediately hoisting his flag in the <i>Christian VII</i> (83 guns). So unexpected was the appointment that he told Sir Thomas Foley that he had &#145;everything to get as if I had never been afloat&#146;  (Young to Foley, 6 April 1811). The squadron he took over was in a high state of order though short of men. Charles Philip Yorke, first lord of the Admiralty, expressed the administration's complete confidence in Young's ability and zeal to blockade the Scheldt and the whole of the Dutch and north German coast, enforcing the orders in council against Napoleon's empire and preventing all neutral trade with the enemy. It was an arduous and unpleasant task. Young faced the problems of all commanders of blockading forces, constantly cruising, always needing more ships as bad weather took its toll, concerned about regular supplies of food and water. Moreover the Admiralty's ready granting of trading licences made for difficulties with neutrals and, though Young hoped the French could be lured out of Flushing and engaged in a battle which would destroy them, he was disappointed.<br>
<br>Lord Keith's appointment to command the Channel Fleet in February 1812 offended Young. He considered his position as senior admiral undermined and the hoped for command of the &#145;Great Fleet of England, the Fleet on which the safety, perhaps the existence of the Country might depend&#146;, an object &#145;worthy of any man's ambition&#146;  (Young to C. P. Yorke, 25 Feb 1812), had been lost to him. He resigned, but on Yorke's persuasion resumed his command until the end of the war. On 28 July 1814 he was invested KB, and following the reconstruction of the Order of the Bath he became GCB on 2 January 1815. In 1819 he was appointed vice-admiral of the United Kingdom. His heath in these last years was not good; in November 1818 he was at Bath. He died, unmarried, at his house in Queen Anne Street, London, on 25 October 1821 after a short illness.<br>
<br>Young never took part in a major fleet action, though the difficult and important blockade in the North Sea, in the last years of the French wars, was well performed and praiseworthy. Most of his professional life was passed in administration, at the Admiralty or at Plymouth. He was a conventional upholder and representative of the existing naval social order, though aware of the need for some reform and having some sympathy with seamen's grievances. He was unsympathetic to Cochrane's radicalism and insubordinate attitude to superior officers, and admirers of Cochrane, like Captain Marryat who portrayed him as Sir Hurricane Humbug, have treated him harshly. Yet Sir William Hotham thought his manners &#145;tho' rather formal and cold, were those of a perfect gentleman, while he had the most punctilious sense of integrity&#146;  (Stirling, 1.58&#150;9), and Young's personal letters reveal a more agreeable nature than his critics have allowed.<br>
