<span class="headword">Sharp,  Patrick</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1615), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, was apparently related to the Sharps of Houstoun. He is first recorded in 1574, when he was made master of Glasgow grammar school. His previous education is unknown, but he may have been qualified in theology already. While in this position he was brought into frequent contact with Andrew Melville, to whom he subsequently acknowledged himself greatly indebted. Soon after 1575 he was appointed one of a commission of classical scholars to draw up a new Latin grammar for use in the Scottish schools. He demitted the schoolmastership in November 1582 and became a university regent, being recorded as minister of Paisley in 1584. In 1585 James VI appointed him principal of the University of Glasgow, and many French protestant refugees studied divinity under him, as well as the future principal John Cameron.<br>
<br>From this time Sharp took an important part in the affairs of the Scottish church. He seems to have wished to preserve a position of neutrality between the two parties dividing the kirk, but gradually inclined to the king's side. In 1586 he was placed on a commission charged by the general assembly to control the proceedings of the bishops and in 1596 the general assembly appointed him and fifteen others to organize the church in opposition to the government. As a result the privy council ordered him to return to Glasgow. But in the following year he took part in the general assembly at Perth at which the king recovered the initiative, and subsequently joined the commission to whom were delegated the powers of the general assembly when that body was not in session, and whose appointment paved the way for the re-establishment of bishops. About 1602 he supervised some university reforms and assured its autonomy relative to the town. In 1606 Sharp was summoned to Hampton Court, with seven other divines, to support the king's side in a debate with Andrew Melville and seven ultra-presbyterians on the general questions at issue between king and kirk. That year he was also appointed constant moderator to the Glasgow presbytery in the absence of the bishop, and met so much opposition that the privy council had to order the presbytery to receive him or face the penalties of rebellion. Yet in the following year he was rebuked for endeavouring to extend the jurisdiction of the presbytery to cover criminal cases. In June 1608 Sharp took part in the Falkland Conference, which was intended to make matters easy for the bishops at the next general assembly. He was appointed to the newly instituted Scottish high commission on 15 May 1610 and continued to serve until 11 August 1614. In December 1613 a royal visitation of the university was set up in response to &#145;enormiteis&#146;. Sharp's theology may have seemed old-fashioned, and an up-to-date replacement was available in Robert Boyd. Sharp anticipated deposition by resigning his principalship. Among his achievements had been the recovery of the university's medieval silver mace, removed at the Reformation by the principal of the time.<br>
<br>Sharp died in May 1615 in Glasgow, leaving an estate valued at &pound;1362 Scots. He was three times married. He and his first wife, Agnes Cairns (<i>d</i>. in or before 1593), had two sons, David and James. On 1 September 1593 he married Mary Fowlis, widow of John Haldane of Balwill, with whom he had one son, Christian, and two daughters. His third wife, whom he married some time after 1600, was Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Jack of Eastwood and widow of Walter Maxwell of Pollok. Sharp was a distinguished scholar, but only one of his works survives, <span class="italic">Doctrinae Christianae brevis explicatio</span>, printed by Robert Waldegrave at Edinburgh in 1599. A work of exegesis, it is simplified on Ramist lines (it speaks of the &#145;use of doctrine&#146;), quotes &#145;aphorisms&#146; as memory aids, transliterates its Greek and Hebrew citations, and cites some of the fathers.<br>
