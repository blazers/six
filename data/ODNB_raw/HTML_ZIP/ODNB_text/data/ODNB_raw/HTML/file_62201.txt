<span class="headword">Yagan</span>  (<em>c.</em>1800&#150;1833), <span class="occ">Aboriginal warrior</span>, was born in south-western Australia, the eldest of four sons of Midgegooroo (or Midjegooroong). The name of his mother is not known. Yagan's tribal land was Beeliar, one of five clan territories that later formed most of the greater metropolitan area of Perth, the capital of Western Australia. In June 1829 Captain James Stirling, designated the first lieutenant-governor of Western Australia, arrived off the mouth of the Swan River with the first British settlers and within a year these territories were alienated by grants to settlers. One settler, Robert Menli Lyon, wrote:<blockquote>Yagan is not a chief but being a son of Midjegooroong, he must be ranked among the princes of the country. He has greatly distinguished himself as a patriot and a warrior. He is in fact the Wallace of the age. (<span class="italic">Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal</span>, 20 April 1833)</blockquote>Lieutenant Robert Dale of the 63rd regiment described Yagan as, &#145;strong and active, perfectly fearless, and the best spearman of his tribe&#151;but passionate, implacable and sullen; in short, a most complete and untameable savage&#146;  (Dale, 15).<br>
<br>In the summer of 1831 two men, later identified as Yagan and Midgegooroo, fatally speared Enion Entwhistle, a servant on a property within Beeliar, and in May the following year Yagan mortally wounded William Gaze and was proclaimed an outlaw. When Yagan and two male companions, Dommera and Ningana, were arrested in September 1832, Lyon successfully argued that Yagan was a warrior acting in defence of his country and should be treated as a prisoner of war. With the approval of the executive council he accompanied the three men, under military escort, into exile on the small offshore island of Carnac, where he believed he could record their language and convert them to Christian ways. During the six weeks on Carnac, Lyon, from information supplied by Yagan and his compatriots, mapped the territories and recorded the leadership of the Aboriginal bands associated with the Swan River and its tributaries, Canning and Helena. These territories included Midgegooroo's Beeliar, Monday's Beeloo, lying between the Canning and Helena rivers, Weeip's clan to the north of the Helena, and Yellagonga's Mooro, with its heartland on the Swan River and the area later occupied by the city of Perth. In addition to the mapping Lyon compiled a glossary of common Nyungar terms, which included the major geographic features of the Swan River. His report was published in the <span class="italic">Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal</span> in March and April 1833 as &#145;A glance at the manners and language of the Aboriginal inhabitants of Western Australia: with a short vocabulary&#146;.<br>
<br>After six weeks of exile Yagan and his companions escaped the island in an unattended dinghy. As no warrant was issued for his arrest, he soon became a familiar and popular figure in Perth, hosting tribal ceremonies known as corroborees, such as one held on 3 March 1833, which was attended by the acting lieutenant-governor, F. C. Irwin, and many leading citizens. The <span class="italic">Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal</span> of 16 March 1833 noted on that occasion that &#145;Yagan was master of the ceremonies, and acquitted himself with infinite dignity and grace.&#146;<br>
<br>On 29 April 1833 Domjum was shot while robbing a store. The following day his kinsman Yagan, with Midgegooroo and others, fatally speared two settlers, John and Thomas Velvick. The principals were then proclaimed outlaws wanted dead or alive, with rewards on the heads of Midgegooroo, Monday, and Yagan. Midgegooroo was captured, given a summary trial on 21 May, and executed by a firing squad of the 63rd regiment. Monday was pardoned. Yagan remained at large until 11 July when two shepherd boys, William and James Keats, invited him to share their campfire, somewhere between the Swan River and Ellen Brook in Upper Swan district, and then shot him dead for the &pound;30 reward. William was fatally speared but James escaped. According to George Fletcher Moore, William Dodd, a farm labourer, severed Yagan's head and preserved it by smoking it over a fire of eucalyptus wood.<br>
<br>Yagan's head was taken to England by Robert Dale, who loaned it to Thomas Pettigrew, a noted surgeon and antiquary, who in turn had it examined by a phrenologist, who reported on the severe damage to the skull caused by a musket-shot. Dale is believed to have deposited the skull with the Liverpool Royal Institution, whence it passed to the Liverpool City Museum. In 1964, by now badly deteriorated, it was interred with stillborn babies in a public grave at a Liverpool cemetery. In 1997, following years of endeavour by Ken Colbung, a Nyungar elder and Korean War veteran, Yagan's skull was returned to be laid to rest with his body. Disputes between rival Nyungar factions and the failure to locate Yagan's grave thwarted this intention and the skull remained in a government vault until 2010, when it was finally reburied in the newly created Yagan Memorial Park near Perth.<br>
<br>Nyungar people continued to regard Yagan as a patriot and a hero but his true legacy is perhaps in the glossary of Nyungar names that he supplied, which are preserved on modern maps, and also his descriptions of clan leadership and territorial boundaries close to the moment of British settlement, which makes Perth unique in the history of Australian capital cities.<br>
