<span class="headword">Creighton,  James</span>  (1739&#150;1819), <span class="occ">Wesleyan Methodist minister</span>, was born on 5 February 1739 at Moyne Hall, co. Cavan, Ireland, of Scottish-Irish descent. His parents, though dissenters, attended the Church of Ireland, and his mother gave him a pious upbringing. Educated at Cavan grammar school, Creighton was admitted sizar at Trinity College, Dublin, on 2 July 1760, graduating BA in 1764. Though doubting his call to the ministry, he was ordained deacon on 28 October 1764 and priest on 28 October 1765 by the bishop of Kilmore. After a curacy with the bishop and teaching at his old school in 1764&#150;6, in 1769 he became curate of Swanlinbar, co. Cavan.<br>
<br>Worried about his sins, Creighton knew little about Methodism despite correspondence with John Wesley in 1773 and reading Methodist pamphlets. However, old Anglican writings in 1775 convinced him that justification and sanctification were not new doctrines. He felt the need to be saved by faith alone and in 1776, influenced by dreams and a feeling like &#145;the shock of electric fire&#146;  (<span class="italic">Arminian Magazine</span>, 301), he was converted. For seven years he preached his new faith in his own parish and far beyond, aided the Methodists, and alienated clerical friends. In 1781&#150;2 he preached in seven counties and walked 4000 miles. Though Wesley failed to persuade him to become John Fletcher's curate in Madeley in 1779, in October 1783 Creighton became Wesley's assistant at City Road Chapel, London.<br>
<br>In the deed of declaration of 28 February 1784, which legally defined the Methodist conference, Creighton was named immediately after the Wesleys and Thomas Coke among the 100 legal members of conference and assisted Wesley in the first ordinations for America on 1&#150;2 September 1784. Creighton claimed that Wesley later regretted ordaining, at least for Scotland, though the ordinations continued, and in 1792 he asserted that Methodist sacraments contradicted Wesley's original plan and his claim not to separate from the Church of England. In 1787 Creighton asked Charles Wesley to approach Lord Mansfield with a plan (probably by Coke) to ask the Anglican hierarchy to keep Methodism within the Church of England by giving Wesley and his successors power to ordain preachers to supervise Methodism under its own rules.<br>
<br>From 1788 to 1792 Creighton edited the <span class="italic">Arminian Magazine</span> and continued to minister at Wesley's chapel until shortly before his death. Here he upheld dignified worship, the use of music, and choral processions for funerals, deploring noisy Methodist behaviour in worship. He was a diligent pastor, especially among the poor. Creighton's publications included poems, sermons, writings on liturgical worship and domestic duties, and <span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Origins of True Religion</span> (2nd edn, 1817), ascribing the origins of religion and culture to the Jews. He declared himself free of bigotry, though he opposed Catholic emancipation. Disgusted with the behaviour of warring factions in Methodism in the 1790s, he took a moderating line on the power struggles between preachers and people. Though upholding conference control against anarchy, he thought local societies should have some control over preachers. Creighton was married, though details of his wife, who died in 1816, are unknown; the couple had at least two sons. He died on 26 December 1819 at his home at Hoxton Square, London, and was buried in his family grave in Henley.<br>
