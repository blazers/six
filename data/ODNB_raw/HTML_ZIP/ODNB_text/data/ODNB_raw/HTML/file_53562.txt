<span class="headword">Earp,  Thomas</span>  (1830&#150;1910), <span class="occ">maltster and politician</span>, was born on 7 May 1830 at Muskham Grange, Muskham, near Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, the only son of William Earp, gardener at Muskham Grange, and his wife, Sarah, daughter of James Taylor. Shortly after Thomas's birth, the family moved to Osmaston Hall, near Derby. Thomas Earp was educated at the village school, where his many talents were soon evident. By the age of ten, he led the choir at Osmaston church and was a proficient violinist. Through the patronage of the vicar, he progressed to the Traffic Street School, Derby, and thence to Derby Diocesan (later Grammar) School. However, the opportunity to train for clerical orders was refused.<br>
<br>At the age of sixteen Earp began his career as junior clerk with the Newark wine and spirits merchant and maltster, George Harvey. Within two years, he had replaced the firm's Manchester malt agent and was soon managing the rapidly expanding malting business. In conjunction with Joseph Richardson and W. Slater, he also leased the town's Trent Brewery and in 1862&#150;80 was a partner in the brewing enterprise, Richardson, Earp, and Slater. In 1872 he became a partner in Harvey and Earp. When George Harvey died eight years later, the firm was amalgamated with the neighbouring business of William Gilstrap to form the most prestigious malting enterprise in Britain. Earp relinquished his brewing interests, and remained as managing partner of Gilstrap, Earp &amp; Co. until his retirement in 1905.<br>
<br>Earp was a man of tremendous energy, whose ambitions were equally realized in politics and civic life. Indeed, there are few more representative examples of a self-made Victorian businessman and politician. A staunch Liberal, he was a town councillor from 1864 until his death forty-six years later, alderman from 1889 until 1910, and mayor in 1869 and 1891&#150;2. He was also a member of Nottinghamshire's county council on its formation in 1889. First returned as MP for Newark in 1874, he represented the town for eleven years. In the Commons he worked and voted with the extreme radicals, counting Joseph Chamberlain, Sir Charles Dilke, and the famous temperance reformer, Sir Wilfred Lawson, among his closest political allies. When in 1885 Newark lost its separate representation, despite requests to stand for Peckham, Canterbury and Grantham, Earp opted to fight the Newark division, but was soundly beaten.<br>
<br>According to his obituarist, no man influenced the course of events in Newark during this period more than Earp. An &#145;advocate and initiator of new forces&#146;  (<span class="italic">Newark Advertiser</span>, 23 Feb 1910), he was a relentless, if controversial, reformer. He resigned from the county council after failing to establish the county asylum at Newark and, a proponent of a national system of free education and opposed to sectarianism, he took his reforming zeal to the newly created school board. He was also instrumental in the town's purchase and modernization of the local waterworks, erection of the new workhouse, and acquisition of the market tolls from the duke of Newcastle. His interests were widespread: a JP, commissioner of the River Trent Navigation, and secretary of the Newark Agricultural Society, he served on the museum, library, and infirmary and workhouse committees. He was vice-president of the Newark School of Science and Art and, as chairman of the governors, donated &pound;10,000 towards modernizing the historic Magnus School.<br>
<br>Earp married Martha (<i>d</i>. 1888), daughter of Thomas Weightman of Langford, in 1855. There were no children. He was survived by his second wife, Mary Rowland Wade, the daughter of Charles Wade of Skegsby, Nottinghamshire, and their son, Thomas. Following a severe attack of bronchitis, Earp died on 17 February 1910, at his home, White House, Millgate, Newark-on-Trent, and was buried at Newark cemetery on 22 February.<br>
