<div class="para">
<span class="headword">McLaren,  Priscilla  Bright</span>  (1815&#150;1906), <span class="occ">campaigner for women's rights</span>, was born on 8 September 1815 at Greenbank, Rochdale, Lancashire, the fifth of the eleven children of Jacob Bright (1775&#150;1851), bookkeeper and owner of a cotton spinning business, and his second wife, Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wood (1788/9&#150;1830). The politicians <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3421/', "John Bright")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3418/', "Jacob Bright")</script> were her brothers. She was educated at Hannah Wilson's school, South Parade, York, and at Hannah Johnson's school in Liverpool. As a girl she visited Newgate prison with her fellow Quaker Elizabeth Fry, &#145;and her upbringing gave her a keen and active interest in politics which she never lost until the end of her life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Englishwoman's Review</span>, 59).<br>
<br>After John Bright's first wife, Elizabeth, died in September 1841, leaving an eleven-year-old daughter, Priscilla Bright moved into her brother's Rochdale home, One Ash, until he remarried in June 1847. As well as assisting Bright with fund-raising and canvassing, she ran his household and brought up his daughter, to whom she remained very close and with whom&#151;as Helen P. Bright Clark&#151;she worked closely in campaigning activities. In 1842 Priscilla met the recently widowed Scottish Presbyterian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17640/', "Duncan McLaren (1800&#150;1886)")</script> while he was on a visit to her brother at One Ash. Freed from her domestic responsibilities on Bright's remarriage, she and McLaren were themselves married on 6 July 1848; they had one daughter and two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34776/', "Charles Benjamin Bright McLaren, first Baron Aberconway")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61721/', "Walter Stowe Bright McLaren")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56261/', "McLaren, Eva Maria")</script>]. She also took on responsibility for five stepchildren, the eldest of whom was seventeen. They shared the same broad political interests: for both of them, their Liberal convictions veered strongly towards radicalism. Alike in party politics and single-issue agitation, Priscilla McLaren and her husband were equal partners, though they disagreed from time to time on matters of tactics and policy.<br>
<br>McLaren inherited from her father a disciplined exactness in the use of words, and from her mother an abiding love of poetry. She had perhaps a lighter touch than her husband and a broader range of cultural interests: a stepson described her as &#145;a powerful influence &hellip; in strengthening and refining the character of my father&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Monitor</span>, 115).<br>
<br>When in 1870 Josephine Butler began her social purity and women's equality campaign against the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span> of 1864 and 1866, the McLarens were her vigorous supporters. On 30 March 1871 Duncan McLaren presented to parliament a petition from 250,000 women calling for repeal of the acts. John Bright was cautious in the matter but his extended family included active repealers, including (in parliament) his brother Jacob, as well as Duncan McLaren and later his sons, while the Ladies' National Association had the support of Bright's sister Margaret Bright Lucas and his first wife's sisters Margaret Tanner, Anna Maria Priestman, and Mary Priestman, who were among Josephine Butler's close friends. Helen Bright Clark and her husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46819/', "William Stephens Clark")</script>, were similarly active in this, as in other campaigns for women's rights in the political sphere and over access to higher education. Between 1869 and 1872 the McLarens were both active in the campaign to admit women medical students to the University of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Priscilla McLaren became disillusioned at what she regarded as the complacency of many men in her political circle over the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span>, and became an advocate of women-only meetings within the association: &#145;women meeting women&#151;I mean <i>ladies</i>&#151;at which we can speak freely of the false idea of morality in which our <i>gentlemen</i> are educated and in which they live&#146;. She wanted meetings for working-class women also, but believed that it was incumbent upon the middle classes to take the lead: &#145;we require [that] the ladies of the country [be] plainly told how their male friends live and what they believe&#146;  (Holton, 33).<br>
<br>McLaren found her instinctive pragmatism sorely tested on other issues of women's rights. She told a conference of the Married Women's Property Committee in 1880 that their struggle was &#145;a question of power. They could not bear that the wife should have power&#146;  (Holton, 54). On women's suffrage too she was radicalized by running into a brick wall of male indifference. Both she and her husband supported John Stuart Mill's amendment to the 1867 <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> in favour of female suffrage, and she became the first president of the Edinburgh Society for Women's Suffrage in 1870, her stepdaughter Agnes being joint secretary with Eliza Wigham. She gave full support to her brother Jacob Bright, who took on the leadership of the suffragists in parliament following Mill's failure to gain re-election in 1868. But John Bright was out of sympathy with his sister's suffrage activities (&#145;She, dear creature, is almost too passionate and enthusiastic to reason on such a question&#146;). Her view, given in a letter written to Helen Bright Clark after his death, was that &#145;he could never <i>bear</i> women to assert themselves&#146;  (Robbins, 219, 233). Nor was her brother the only object of McLaren's ire on this score; later, when the Liberal Party leadership came out against women's suffrage early in 1881, she complained bitterly of &#145;how badly the men are behaving&#146;, and after &#145;a most insulting&#146; speech on the subject by Gladstone, she wrote that her husband &#145;looks very sorrowful for us. But every man's mouth is shut&#146;  (Holton, 66). Later she broke with Gladstone over home rule and became a Liberal Unionist. Like her husband she advocated an imperial parliament with representation for the colonies. Not long before she died, she signalled her acceptance of a place for suffragette militancy by signing a letter of sympathy for the activists imprisoned in October 1906.<br>
<br>Activity in the anti-slavery movement brought Priscilla McLaren into touch with the Garrisonian Elizabeth Pease Nichol, who had moved to Glasgow on her marriage in 1853. Later she often reminded her great-niece Alice Clark that she had been born on the anniversary of the emancipation of slaves. Both Priscilla and Duncan McLaren were also active in temperance work, and in both campaigns she worked alongside Eliza Wigham.<br>
<br>At the time of her marriage to Duncan McLaren, Quaker marriage was restricted to members and she had scruples about &#145;hireling priests&#146;; they were perforce married before the superintendent registrar. For this she was disowned by Marsden monthly meeting, a step she regarded as so unjust that she never reapplied for membership. She consented, however, to her membership being restored to her in 1887 at the monthly meeting's initiative. Ten years later she was rejoicing that Friends were getting to grips with biblical criticism and the social implications of the gospel.<br>
<br>Priscilla McLaren was an indefatigable and (certainly within the family where, to Helen Clark and her children, she was their beloved Aunt Tilla) an entertaining letter-writer. Unlike some campaigners she had a great feeling for individuals and was a good listener. Her judgements were sometimes impatient, but she &#145;could look with a smile upon her own strong convictions and impulses&#146;  (<span class="italic">British Friend</span>, 310). She died from pneumonia at home at Newington House, Blacket Avenue, Edinburgh, on 5 November 1906, and was buried beside her husband (who had died on 26 April 1886) in St Cuthbert's churchyard, Edinburgh on 9 November.<br>
