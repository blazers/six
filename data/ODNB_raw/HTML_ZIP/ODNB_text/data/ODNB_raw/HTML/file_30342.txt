</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Addison,  Christopher</span>, first Viscount Addison  (1869&#150;1951), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at the Willows Farm, Hogsthorpe, Lincolnshire, on 19 June 1869. His father, Robert Addison (1838&#150;1899), who came from a long line of yeoman farmers, grazed cattle in Lindsey, east Lincolnshire. Later he moved to a much larger farm of 200 acres at Stallingborough, near Grimsby. In 1861 Robert Addison married Susan (<i>d</i>. 1913), daughter of Charles Fanthorpe, a customs official in Lincolnshire. Seven of their twelve children survived. Christopher was the youngest of three boys. He retained the outlook and style of a countryman all his life; he was instinctively an agrarian radical, rooted in the peasantry of the Danelaw.<h2>
<a name="Medicinemarriageandradicalpolitics"></a>Medicine, marriage, and radical politics</h2>Addison was sent off to Trinity College, Harrogate, at the age of thirteen. Thereafter he went to Sheffield medical school and, despite much financial stringency, on to St Bartholomew's Hospital, where he graduated with honours. He proved to be an exceptionally able medical student, especially in the field of human anatomy. In 1893 he was appointed demonstrator, later lecturer, in the Sheffield medical school, and in 1897, at the age of twenty-eight, became the first holder of the Arthur Jackson chair of anatomy. In 1893 he had gained his doctorate from the University of London. In 1901 he delivered the prestigious Hunterian lectures at the Royal College of Surgeons and then moved to Charing Cross Hospital, where he later became dean. His research as a physiologist and anatomist, especially in relation to the abdominal organs, was most distinguished. His name was given to Addison's plane, a method of identifying the shape and position of the pancreas. In 1904&#150;6 he served as secretary of the Anatomical Society of Great Britain.<br>
<br>From his childhood, however, Addison had a compelling interest in politics. His early radicalism startled his Conservative father. While at Charing Cross, he developed a lifelong concern with health and social deprivation in London's East End. He also backed land nationalization. He thus campaigned actively for the Liberals in the 1906 general election. Another radical impulse came from his marriage, on 25 March 1902, to Isobel Mackinnon Gray (1875/6&#150;1934), the daughter of Archibald Gray, a wealthy shipping man active in Indian trade. She was a passionate Christian socialist. In an exceptionally happy marriage, they were to have three sons (one of whom died in early childhood) and two daughters. In addition, his wife's wealth enabled him to think of a political career, and in 1907 he was adopted as Liberal candidate for the Hoxton division of Shoreditch, an East End constituency that had somewhat surprisingly remained Unionist in 1906.<h2>
<a name="LloydGeorgeslieutenantnationalhealthinsuranceandmunitions"></a>Lloyd George's lieutenant: national health insurance and munitions</h2>In the general election of January 1910, Addison captured Hoxton with a 338 majority; at the age of forty, therefore, he left medicine for the uncertain fortunes of politics. In the following general election that December he increased his majority to 694. In both contests he campaigned strongly as a vehement supporter of Lloyd George's People's Budget and social reform programme, and of the government's <span class="roman">Parliament Bill</span> to curb the power of the Lords. It proved to be Lloyd George who was largely responsible for his political breakthrough. The chancellor's massive <span class="roman">National Insurance Bill</span> of 1911 ran into opposition both from the industrial assurance companies and from the doctors. Addison emerged as a member of the British Medical Association advisory committee on the bill, but one who strongly backed Lloyd George's measure. He persuaded Lloyd George to frame concessions to the medical profession on the make-up of the new health committees, the terms of service under the new act, and the levels of remuneration. His campaigning did much to persuade the doctors to come to terms with Lloyd George's measure. From that time onwards, Lloyd George regarded the unassuming Dr Addison with high respect for his administrative skills and also his moral courage. They worked closely together in 1912&#150;14 on behalf of a range of radical causes, health and housing, a new Medical Research Council, women's suffrage, Ireland, and the land taxes included in Lloyd George's budget of April 1914. Together, Addison recorded, they &#145;dreamed dreams but based them on existing realities&#146;. On 8 August 1914 Asquith made him parliamentary secretary to the Board of Education.<br>
<br>But by now Addison, like all other politicians, saw his world engulfed by world war. He had been a member of the radical foreign affairs group, critics of Grey's foreign policy. But he was no Little Englander and no pacifist. Like Lloyd George, he accepted the necessity to declare war on Germany after the invasion of Belgium. His fortunes became ever more closely entwined with those of Lloyd George now. When the political crisis of May 1915 saw Asquith's Liberal government transformed into a coalition including the Unionists and Labour, Addison found himself moved as under-secretary to Lloyd George's new office as minister of munitions. His political role now moved on to a higher plane. He was an essential lieutenant as Lloyd George used munitions' production to transform the war economy. He was most active in costing contracts and in negotiations with arms manufacturers and the unions. Here he had to handle delicate issues over dilution of skilled labour and the use of women workers. There was a prolonged crisis on the Clyde where the Clyde Workers' Committee called for strikes; Addison was centrally involved in trying to provide a solution through the use of trade cards and &#145;de-badging&#146; procedures, and with some success. He became, therefore, a major practitioner of &#145;war socialism&#146;. Also he became much involved in the political manoeuvres that led to the triumph of Lloyd George. He was among those Liberals who strongly backed Lloyd George in the cabinet wrangles on military conscription. The latter's success in April 1916 severely damaged the authority of Asquith and encouraged many Liberals to think of him as a replacement at 10 Downing Street. To this end, Addison showed Lloyd George a list he had drawn up with David Davies and F. G. Kellaway of Liberals who would back Lloyd George as premier. It retained its relevance that summer and autumn as the war went increasingly badly with heavy defeat on the Somme, failure in Gallipoli, the Grand Fleet mauled at Jutland, the surrender of Romania, and Asquith's ineffective handling of Ireland after the Easter rising.<br>
<br>In the crucial events of 1&#150;9 December 1916, days central to the collapse of British Liberalism, it was the relatively little-known Dr Addison who was among the kingmakers. When Asquith rejected the idea of a war committee that Lloyd George, Bonar Law, and Carson had put to him, Addison and Kellaway &#145;on our own account&#146; drew up a list of Liberal MPs prepared to support a Lloyd George government. It emerged that forty-nine would do so without equivocation and that another 126&#151;making well over half the Liberals in the house&#151;would do so if one were formed. Lloyd George's position as the possible head of an all-party coalition was much strengthened. Addison also made contact with key Labour leaders. Lloyd George duly became prime minister on 7 December. Two days later, Addison (who had turned down the position of chief whip) became minister of munitions. He had been central to a palace revolution that transformed both his own career and the long-term future of British party politics.<br>
<br>Addison remained at munitions until July 1917. He developed the established strategies for enhanced arms production, including the shipping and tank-building programmes, and the new aeroplanes. He was also again embroiled in difficulties with labour. The continuing problems with dilution led to a three-week strike of over 200,000 engineering workers in May 1917 and meant a temporary falling out with Lloyd George over the press coverage that resulted. However, Addison's reputation for executive competence survived, while he also remained a crucial Liberal ally for the beleaguered prime minister. When in July 1917 Lloyd George sought to remodel his government, notably by bringing in Churchill to munitions, Addison moved to the new Ministry of Reconstruction, concerned with post-war social and economic planning. Here he took on a wide remit including health, housing, the poor law, agriculture, and resettlement. His role here led to some criticism that the reconstruction programme was confused and ill-focused. Addison, however, had at least one considerable achievement to his credit, victory over the Local Government Board in proposing a new Ministry of Health. His work gave the coalition much of its domestic manifesto henceforth. He was also pivotal to Lloyd George's dominance within the coalition. Addison's was a crucial voice in creating the Coalition Liberals, to give Lloyd George a power base in negotiating a post-war alliance with the Unionists. In the &#145;coupon&#146; general election in December 1918, Addison was a key Liberal figure in the coalition. Its massive election victory, with 526 government supporters returned, as against 57 Labour and about 24 Asquithians, appeared to be a triumph for the British right. Addison, however, saw the coalition as radical, designed to promote social reform and a land fit for heroes. Post-war tensions resulted from this conflict.<h2>
<a name="Postwarreconstructionhealthandhousing"></a>Post-war reconstruction: health and housing</h2>In January 1919 Addison became president of the Local Government Board, charged with giving substance to the government's pledges of post-war reform. His immediate task was setting up a new Ministry of Health, and indeed he took over this new office that June. Even more momentous a reform was his <span class="roman">Housing and Town Planning Act</span> (the <span class="roman">Addison Act</span>) which launched a massive new programme of house building by the local authorities, with the quite new principle of a Treasury subsidy to cover the difference between the capital costs and the income earned through rents from working-class tenants, over and above a penny rate levied by the local authorities. This was amended at the end of 1919 to include a &pound;150 subsidy to private builders. Controversy dogged the housing programme from the start. Progress in house building was slow, the private enterprise building industry was fragmented, the building unions were reluctant to admit unskilled workers, the local authorities could hardly cope with their massive new responsibilities, and Treasury policy overall was unhelpful. In addition, the costs of the Treasury subsidy began to soar, with uncontrolled prices of raw materials leading to apparently open-ended subventions from the state. Addison thus became a prime target for the right-wing &#145;anti-waste&#146; campaign. For the left, the &#145;homes for heroes&#146; were simply not being built. However, Addison could ultimately claim that, in spite of all difficulties, 210,000 high-quality houses were built for working people, and that an important new social principle of housing as a social service had been enacted.<br>
<br>The real problem with Addison, though, was that in a coalition government lurching to the right he was a constant radical gadfly, on foreign affairs, India, and Ireland as well as domestic reform, in meeting the challenge from Labour. Lloyd George, long impatient with the soaring costs of state housing, thus transferred Addison from health in March 1921 to the anomalous post of minister without portfolio. His standing in the government rapidly collapsed. There was public humiliation in the enforced cutting of his ministerial salary. As the economy deteriorated and &#145;anti-waste&#146; pressure mounted, Addison was a target for all those who felt the government was being both incompetent and socialistic. The reversal of coalition social reform policies led to the halting of the housing programme, the effective end of the Treasury subsidy, and the phasing down of slum clearance. The Geddes &#145;axe&#146; soon followed, and on 14 July Addison resigned. In an angry, incoherent speech in the Commons, he denounced the government for its broken promises on social reform. Later, he wrote a fierce pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Betrayal of the Slums</span> (1922). There was a violent and highly public falling out with his old ally Lloyd George. Addison now seemed a marginalized figure in the wilderness, destroyed by the all-powerful prime minister. In reality, it was Lloyd George who was now almost finished, Addison whose career had thirty years still to run.<h2>
<a name="LabourPartyandagriculture"></a>Labour Party and agriculture</h2>When the Lloyd George coalition unexpectedly fell in October 1922, Addison ran at the subsequent general election a month later as an independent Liberal at Shoreditch. In fact, he enjoyed the support of neither Asquithian nor Lloyd Georgian Liberals in the constituency, and found himself having to finance both rival Liberal associations there simultaneously. His agent mismanaged his funds, and the debts he faced left him close to bankruptcy. Almost inevitably, he was defeated at Shoreditch in 1922, finishing a poor third in the poll to Labour. However his determination to remain in politics on the left remained intense. He now spoke for Labour candidates and became close to Ramsay MacDonald and other Labour leaders. At the end of 1923 he joined the Labour Party. Where Churchill, Mond, Guest, Greenwood, and Grigg among the Coalition Liberals were to move to the right, Addison was unique in joining Labour. In the 1924 general election, called after the resignation of the first Labour government, he stood as a Labour candidate at Hammersmith South, but was unsuccessful. He now spent much time in writing, notably in producing two-volume reminiscences, <span class="italic">Politics from Within</span> (1924), and <span class="italic">Practical Socialism</span> (1926). But his main priority lay in working on agriculture, a quite new priority for Labour with its traditional roots in urban, industrial areas. He emphasized the need for guaranteed prices for wheat farmers and minimum wages for farm labourers. His chosen mechanism was that of marketing boards for key foodstuffs, an idea which was very much his own and which proved prophetic. He was particularly anxious to improve Labour prospects in rural areas in view of Lloyd George's new campaigns through the &#145;green book&#146;. Addison also advocated the nationalization of land. In the 1929 general election he returned to the house as Labour MP for Swindon, and became parliamentary secretary for agriculture under MacDonald.<br>
<br>As a senior politician, Addison was from the first a major figure in the second Labour administration, even in a minor post. He rapidly began to dominate Noel Buxton, his minister, and to take the initiative in putting forward proposals for the marketing of home food produce and advocating the idea of an empire marketing board. He also showed a zeal to support home agriculture, including through quotas for production, that led some ministers to fear protectionist tendencies. In June 1930 he succeeded Noel Buxton as minister for agriculture within the cabinet, and was able to press his various policies with the more force. He was also an important figure politically since he formed a link of a kind between the minority MacDonald government and his old leader, Lloyd George, with whom relations had been somewhat repaired. Ideas on agriculture became the basis for suggestions of a wider Lib&#150;Lab collaboration, including on policies to combat unemployment. There seemed a prospect of the pre-war progressive alliance being re-established, this time with Labour as the dominant partner.<br>
<br>Addison launched in cabinet a series of plans to remedy the long depression in agriculture and food production generally. He pressed for import boards for cereal growers, quotas for production, and new powers for local authorities to take over land for cultivation. The most important of his proposals, however, was his <span class="roman">Agricultural Marketing Bill</span> of 1931. This measure, by raising the price for the producer, lowering it for the consumer, and fostering an overall expansion of agriculture through guaranteed prices and regular price reviews, was to inaugurate a long-term revolution in policy. It was to be extended under the National Government and the wartime coalition into the marketing of milk, potatoes, cheese, cereals, livestock, and fruit, and to form much of the basis of the post-war Labour government's programme. It was a remarkable instance of Addison's executive skill and flair in obtaining all-party co-operation. However, everything changed in the financial crisis of August 1931. When, following the May report, MacDonald called for massive cuts in public spending including in unemployment benefit, Addison led the opposition. He denounced a policy introduced to placate foreign bankers that would seriously erode standards of public health and education, and was the first to urge that Britain leave the gold standard. He was the one middle-class member of the nine members of MacDonald's government who opposed cuts in social spending. The government fell and a new National Government under MacDonald now emerged. Addison was bitterly opposed to it. He was among the plethora of former Labour ministers who lost their seats in the October 1931 general election, being defeated at Swindon by a Conservative.<h2>
<a name="Labourpeer"></a>Labour peer</h2>Although now in his early sixties, Addison retained all his zest for politics. He was an active figure in Labour policy making in the thirties, especially in the New Fabian Research Bureau (of which he was chairman 1933&#150;7) and the &#145;XYZ group&#146; to discuss economic policy. He remained active in crusading on Labour's behalf in rural areas and wrote an influential work, <span class="italic">A Policy for British Agriculture</span>, in 1939. He also continued to collaborate with politicians in other parties, retaining his links with Lloyd George (and even, surprisingly, being invited to become a trustee of the &#145;Lloyd George Fund&#146;&#151;which he declined after some thought). He also maintained close relations with the agriculture minister, the Conservative Walter Elliot, who pressed on with the policy of marketing boards. In 1934 he got back into the house in a by-election in his old seat at Swindon, but in the 1935 election he was unexpectedly defeated again, by the Conservative candidate, the rugby player Wavell Wakefield. Addison's career took a new turn, however, on 22 May 1937 when he went to the Lords as Baron Addison&#151;as it happened, the only Labour peer to be created by Neville Chamberlain, an old adversary. Addison also took a major part in the discussion of foreign affairs, especially in attacking the appeasement policies towards the European dictators. He was a fierce critic during the Italo-Abyssinian War and condemned the policy of non-intervention during the Spanish Civil War. As a distinguished medical man, he was chairman of the Spanish Medical Aid Committee: he was also prominent in the Socialist Medical Association. He also kept in touch with his old ministerial colleague Winston Churchill in providing information on the failures of defence policy, especially in the air.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Addison took no significant role, other than serving as chairman of the Buckinghamshire War Agricultural Executive Committee. His personal life had now changed considerably. His first wife, Isobel, had died in 1934, and on 4 November 1937 Addison had married a second time. His new wife was (Beatrice) Dorothy Low (1895/6&#150;1982), the daughter of a solicitor, (Frederick) Percy Low, who was also a Conservative agent. The new Lady Addison manifestly did not share Addison's radicalism. However, as a poised and supportive wife she sustained his morale and enduring ambition. They lived in the village of Radnage, in Buckinghamshire, quite near Chequers. Addison remained prominent in public debate during the war, speaking out on land issues and on post-war reconstruction. Of particular importance was the close relationship he struck up with his Buckinghamshire neighbour, the Labour leader, Clement Attlee. The latter enormously valued Addison's judgement and long experience in a variety of public offices, and their relationship became particularly close. When Labour won a landslide election victory in 1945, Attlee became prime minister. One of his first decisions was to make Addison (from 2 July 1945 Viscount Addison of Stallingborough) secretary to the dominions and leader of the House of Lords.<h2>
<a name="Attleescabinet"></a>Attlee's cabinet</h2>Addison began his important role at the age of seventy-six. He remained, however, an active and highly influential politician and was in the cabinet right down to the fall of the government in October 1951, by which time he was eighty-two. He was an important figure in cabinet, where members deferred to his experience (Harold Wilson called Addison &#145;a wise old man&#146;) and Attlee gave him particular latitude in debate. He took a particular interest, as befitted his record, in social welfare, and gave Aneurin Bevan crucial backing in the debate on the nationalization of hospitals. Housing and agriculture were other pet subjects that claimed his attention. As dominions secretary he was a leading figure in meetings of Commonwealth heads of government, and struck up an unexpectedly close friendship with the Canadian prime minister, Mackenzie King. He and his wife went on a cross-continental tour of Canada in the autumn of 1946. He was also closely involved with Field Marshal Smuts, who had served with him in government under Lloyd George in 1917. In October 1947, in a cabinet reshuffle, he left Commonwealth relations to become lord privy seal, while continuing to lead the Lords. One ominous concern of his proved to be British policy towards nuclear weapons. He was a member of the six-man top secret committee known as GEN 163, which took in January 1947 the momentous decision that Britain should continue secretly to develop the atomic bomb. He had few doubts that Britain should retain her own nuclear deterrent.<br>
<br>Addison played a major unseen role as chairman of key cabinet committees and member of the future legislation committee. But his most important role in the Attlee years was leading the House of Lords. That body had a huge majority of hereditary tory peers at a time of a massive Labour majority in the Commons, and it required all Addison's statesmanship and emollient qualities to ensure that a constitutional crisis was averted. He made the small band of (mainly elderly) Labour peers a surprisingly effective fighting force. But in addition, through his personal ascendancy over the Lords and his good relationship with Lord Cranborne (later Lord Salisbury), the tory leader, he managed to get a vast body of legislation through a hostile chamber largely unscathed. Measures of nationalization, planning, and state intervention on an unprecedented scale were put on the statute book with little difficulty. When a real crisis emerged in the summer of 1947 over iron and steel nationalization (a measure over which he himself was not enthusiastic), Addison had to call on all his powers of diplomacy. In the end, steel nationalization passed through the Lords at the end of 1949, but there was also the passage of a parliamentary act to reduce the delaying powers of the upper house to one year only. All in all, his leadership of the Lords was one of the most distinguished phases of his long career.<br>
<br>Even after the general election of February 1950, when Attlee clung onto office by only six votes, Addison remained a member of his cabinet. He remained active in Commonwealth affairs, including the crisis surrounding Seretse Khama in Bechuanaland. He was among those who tried to persuade Bevan not to resign from the government over health service charges in the spring of 1951. He was one of eight cabinet ministers present on 19 September 1951 when Attlee unexpectedly told them that he was going to call another general election. Labour now lost office, and the Conservatives returned under Winston Churchill, another important figure in Addison's long career. By now, however, he was a dying man, stricken by cancer. He died at his home, Neighbours, at Radnage, on 11 December 1951, and is buried in the churchyard of St Mary's Church there. A memorial service was held in Westminster Abbey on 30 January 1952, attended by Attlee and many others. He left two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Christopher Addison, a quiet, uncharismatic man and a dull speaker, had an astonishing career. A distinguished professor of medicine, he turned politician in middle age and remained a major figure in public life for a further forty years. He illustrates the continuities of the progressive tradition in British politics. He was a leading &#145;new Liberal&#146; before 1914 and a natural convert to Labour after 1918. However, whereas many Liberals who joined Labour did so in reaction against the war, Addison embraced the wartime experience and saw it as a major argument for constructive democratic socialism. He was the one significant Coalition Liberal who moved left after the fall of Lloyd George. He was also a generally effective minister, the only one to serve in both post-war governments. His record at munitions was rather mixed, and his achievement at reconstruction hard to assess. However, he was a pioneer minister of health whose controversial housing policy was a major new departure. At agriculture under Labour in 1930&#150;31 he was remarkably innovative in promoting marketing boards. As leader of the Lords under Attlee he was a major success, showing himself again an idealistic radical who could use power. Finally, he was a crucial figure at pivotal moments in party politics, helping to build up Lloyd George prior to 1916, breaking with him in 1921, leading the revolt against MacDonald in 1931, and emerging as remarkably influential under Attlee in his final years. The most notable doctor ever to be involved in British politics, he played a much underestimated part, in two periods of war and reconstruction, in making Britain a welfare democracy and a more humane society.<br>
