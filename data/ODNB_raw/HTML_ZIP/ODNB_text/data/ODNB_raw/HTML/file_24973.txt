<span class="headword">Scudamore, Sir  Charles</span>  (1779&#150;1849), <span class="occ">physician</span>, third son of William Scudamore, a surgeon, and his wife, Elizabeth Rolfe, was born at Wye, Kent, where his father was in practice. His grandfather and great-grandfather were surgeons at Canterbury, and were descendants of a family from Ballingham, Herefordshire. Frank Ives Scudmore (1823&#150;1884) was his nephew. He was educated at Wye grammar school and began his medical education as apprentice to his father. He continued his studies at Guy's and St Thomas's hospitals in London, for three years, after which he settled in practice as a surgeon at Highgate, where he remained for ten years. He married, on 24 June 1811, Georgiana Johnson; they had no children.<br>
<br>Scudamore next undertook further medical study at Edinburgh, from 1813, and graduated MD at Glasgow on 6 May 1814; his thesis was entitled <span class="italic">De arthritide</span>. He was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, in London, on 30 September 1814, and began practice as a physician in Holles Street, London. He had some knowledge of chemistry, and in 1816 published <span class="italic">An Analysis of the Mineral Water of Tunbridge Wells</span>, the first of his several works on mineral waters. In the same year he published the book which established his reputation as an expert on gout, <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Nature and Cure of Gout</span>; this was based on his observation of about a hundred cases of gout, and contains one of the first contributions to the study of the distribution of gouty changes throughout the body. Among other observations, he mentions that there were in 1814 only five hackney carriages and less than twenty private carriages in Glasgow, and he attributes the rarity of gout there to the constant walking even of the rich citizens. Scudamore was the first English author to mention the frequent presence of a circular chest, instead of an elliptical one, in persons subject to gout. He showed little capacity for observing disease at the bedside, but had some knowledge of morbid anatomy.<br>
<br>In 1820 Scudamore was appointed physician to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. During the following decade he wrote prolifically on a variety of medical subjects, and in 1827 published <span class="italic">A Treatise on Rheumatism</span>, which paints an interesting picture of the period when rheumatic fever was beginning to be separated in medical writings from chronic rheumatism. Scudamore treated rheumatic fever by bleeding, purgatives, colchicum, tartar emetic, opium, and quinine. He went to Ireland, in March 1829, as physician to the duke of Northumberland, then appointed lord lieutenant, who knighted him at Dublin on 30 September 1829. He was also admitted an honorary member of Trinity College, Dublin, during his stay in Ireland.<br>
<br>Scudamore also spent part of every year at Buxton, and was physician to the Bath Charity there. He published <span class="italic">An Analysis of the Tepid Springs of Buxton</span> in 1820. In April and May 1843 he visited Gr&auml;fenberg, and on his return he published a small book on the water-cure treatment being used there. Scudamore died in his London house, 6 Wimpole Street, of heart disease, on 4 August 1849, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
