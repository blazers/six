<span class="headword">Tosny,  Ralph  de</span> <span class="st"> [Ralph  de Conches]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1102?), <span class="occ">baron</span>, was the son of Roger de Tosny and Godehildis, and thus from one of the most powerful families on the southern frontier of Normandy. The viking ancestor claimed for them, an otherwise unknown uncle of Rollo, first duke of Normandy, called Malahulc, was added to the family tree only in the twelfth century; during Ralph's lifetime his ancestry was traced to a Frankish great-grandfather. Tosny, in the Seine valley, was in the family's hands by the 980s and gave them a hereditary territorial surname by the 1010s, probably the first in the duchy. Roger founded one of the earliest baronial abbeys at Conches, which provided an alternative surname over several generations. An outsider as far as Duke William's relatives were concerned, Roger and two sons older than Ralph were killed in a bloody feud with the Beaumonts <i>c</i>.1040. Afterwards his widow was married into the ducal kin in the person of Richard, count of &Eacute;vreux, in whose household Ralph was presumably raised.<br>
<br>Ralph de Tosny's own career began in the 1040s, witnessing charters, first alongside his mother and then from 1050 alone, at a time when his family was being drawn closer to the ducal kin through his sister Adelize's marriage to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9620/', "William fitz Osbern")</script>. When the French attacked Normandy in 1054 he was Duke William's standard-bearer and trusted envoy, but as he grew older he became like his father, proud and reckless, a typical Norman (except that his ancestry was Frankish). Physically brave into his old age, he was simply incapable of subordinating his will to anyone else, even his lord, for any length of time.<br>
<br>Ralph's power was based on large estates around Conches, Tosny, and Acquigny, with other fiefs scattered north of the Seine and even in the Cotentin. By the early 1060s he had married, and significantly it was outside the duchy. His bride, Isabel 
    (or Elizabeth; <i>d</i>. in or after 1102)
  , was the daughter of Simon de Montfort l'Amaury and at least Ralph's match in character: adored by her knights, she rode to war with them, armed as they were.<br>
<br>Ralph de Tosny's belligerence had a frequent outlet in violent quarrels with neighbouring barons. One, about 1060, involved the Montgomerys; Duke William took their side, confiscated Ralph's lands, and exiled him. In retaliation, Ralph and other dispossessed lords razed the town of St Evroult, but in 1062 or 1063, at the prompting of Simon de Montfort and because the duke needed all the friends he could get in the southern marches, William reinstated him. For the rest of the 1060s Ralph was at the centre of things in Normandy, present both at the ducal court and in the army which invaded England. Tradition later had it that he declined to carry the Norman banner at Hastings so that he could join the thick of the fight.<br>
<br>The rewards which Ralph de Tosny found in England were modest for a lord of his standing. Other and lesser members of his family, Robert of Stafford and Robert de Tosny of Belvoir, were treated at least as well. Perhaps he preferred Normandy, or it may be that more expansive gifts were ruled out by his earlier rebellion and then by his support for Robert Curthose in 1078&#150;9, when again his lands were briefly confiscated. At first he probably received only the big scattered soke of Necton in Norfolk and a handful of manors in Essex and Hertfordshire, including Flamstead, later capital of the Tosny barony. More came his way after the fall in 1075 of his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9661/', "Roger de Breteuil, earl of Hereford")</script>, in Berkshire, Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, and Herefordshire, with Clifford Castle. Ralph is only once known to have visited England after 1066 (though the documentation may be misleading) and took little interest in his English gains, subinfeudating half, including Clifford. Few of the principal families of the Norman honour became his tenants in England. On the other hand he gave generously there, to his own abbey of Conches, to St Taurin at &Eacute;vreux, and to St Evroult, the last as belated amends for his earlier crimes and after he returned from Spain <i>c</i>.1075 (whether from pilgrimage or a military campaign is unclear). In Normandy he husbanded his resources more carefully, but made many small gifts to those and other houses.<br>
<br>On the death of William I in 1087, Ralph de Tosny was among the Norman lords who threw off Duke Robert Curthose's authority by expelling his garrisons from their castles, but then fought alongside him in the successful 1088 campaign in Maine. In the early 1090s Ralph witnessed several of the duke's charters, but he was alert to his own interests, and when Curthose failed to defend him in another of those nasty private wars along the march, this time against his wife's nephew Guillaume, count of &Eacute;vreux, he switched to William Rufus, who willingly sent help. When peace came in 1091 or 1092, Curthose formally transferred the Tosny fiefs to Rufus's lordship. Ralph was then a Rufus loyalist, more or less, probably joining his 1098 campaign against the French, but taking the opportunity of his death in 1100 to settle a grudge against his Beaumont neighbours. He died an old man, pugnacious almost to the last, on 24 March, probably in 1102, and was buried at Conches Abbey. All the Tosny lands passed to his oldest surviving son, another Ralph.<br>
