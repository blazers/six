<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Justice,  James Norval Harald  Robertson</span>  (1907&#150;1975), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born at 39 Baring Road, Lee, Lewisham, on 15 June 1907, the son of James Norval Justice, mining engineer, and his wife, Edith Burgess. He was educated at Marlborough College and went on to the University of Bonn, where he was awarded a PhD. Intended (by his parents at least) for a career in the diplomatic service, Robertson Justice joined Reuters as a young journalist and was sent out to Canada in 1927. Over the next ten years he found work around the globe variously as a reporter, a schoolmaster, an insurance salesman, a lorry driver, a sailor, and the manager of an ice rink. He had a great facility with languages: said to speak ten, he himself admitted to French, German, Italian, Dutch, and Gaelic.<br>
<br>Robertson Justice was called up into the Royal Navy at the outbreak of the Second World War. After the war he drifted into acting, and was appearing as the chairman in music-hall at the Players Theatre Club when Harry Watt, the film director, spotted his talent and gave him a role in his film <span class="italic">Fiddlers Three</span> (1944), followed by other films produced at Ealing Studios. He made notable screen appearances in Peter Ustinov's <span class="italic">Vice Versa</span> (1947), as Commander Evans in <span class="italic">Scott of the Antarctic</span> (1948), and in <span class="italic">Whisky Galore</span> (1948).<br>
<br>In 1951 James Robertson Justice went to Hollywood, where he appeared in <span class="italic">David and Bathsheba</span> (1951), and also in <span class="italic">Land of the Pharaohs</span> (1955) and <span class="italic">Moby Dick</span> (1956). A Second World War drama for British Lion was <span class="italic">Orders to Kill</span> (1958). However, his career changed decisively when he played the irascible surgeon Sir Lancelot Spratt in the sequence of film comedies which started in 1954 with <span class="italic">Doctor in the House</span>.<br>
<br>An actor of more than 20 stone in weight, with a grizzled, once red beard, and the voice of an educated foghorn, Robertson Justice was typecast as &#145;the heavy&#146; in countless films, as &#145;a peppery doctor, professional lawyer, sailor, senior spy&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>).<br>
<br>Seldom tempted towards the stage or radio or television, James Robertson Justice spent thirty years or so in regular film work, which he seemed to find of diminishing interest. His real concerns were ornithology, ecology, and conservation, and his passion was falconry; he published learned papers on all these subjects, and noted proudly that he had invented a rocket-propelled net method of catching wildfowl for marking purposes.<br>
<br>Robertson Justice lived for many years in his beloved highlands, contesting North Angus and Mearns unsuccessfully as a Labour candidate in 1950. He had rather better luck at Edinburgh University, where students elected him their rector in both 1957 and 1963; he served a total of six years and was rewarded with an honorary doctorate.<br>
<br>In later life Robertson Justice took to comp&egrave;ring opera and ballet programmes for BBC television, but unnerved colleagues by occasionally appearing on the set with a remarkably tame eagle tethered to his wrist. A difficult man, loyal to the Scottish nationalist cause long before Sean Connery made that position fashionable, he was a rich and rare addition to the gallery of great British character-acting eccentrics.<br>
<br>Robertson Justice lived in his later years with the former actress Baroness Irina Margarethe Pauline Isabelle Caecilie von Meyendorff. Their long-standing relationship was responsible in 1968 for his divorce from his first wife, Dillys. Robertson Justice and Irina married on 29 June 1975, only a few days before his death. He died on 2 July 1975 at his home, Top House, Ashley, Stockbridge, Hampshire, from heart failure. He was cremated.<br>
