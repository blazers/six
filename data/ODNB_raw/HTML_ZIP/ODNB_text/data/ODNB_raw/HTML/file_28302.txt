<span class="headword">Villiers,  Thomas</span>, first earl of Clarendon  (1709&#150;1786), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28304/', "William Villiers, second earl of Jersey (c.1682&#150;1721)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28289/', "Villiers, Edward, first earl of Jersey")</script>], and his wife, Judith (<i>d</i>. 1735), daughter and heir of Frederick Herne, a wealthy London merchant. He was educated at Eton College (1725), and matriculated from Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1728, but left the university without a degree. After making a grand tour to France and Italy in 1733&#150;4, he entered the diplomatic service.<br>
<br>Early in 1738 Villiers was sent as envoy-extraordinary to the court of Augustus III, elector of Saxony and king of Poland, residing in both Dresden and Warsaw from 23 May 1738 to December 1742. From 1742 to 1743 he served as minister-plenipotentiary to Augustus in his capacity as elector of Saxony. From mid-January to mid-March 1743 he was envoy at Vienna, from where he was sent to a number of imperial cities. In July 1743 he was reporting from Hanau on the progress of the War of the Austrian Succession. In September of the following year he returned to Poland, where Augustus had taken refuge on being driven out of Saxony by Frederick the Great. In November 1745 Frederick instructed his minister to make proposals for peace with Saxony through the medium of Villiers. Carlyle judged that Villiers showed himself &#145;really diligent, reasonable, loyal; doing his very best now and afterwards; but has no success at all&#146;  (Carlyle, 6.109). He followed Augustus in his flight to Prague, and continued his efforts there without success until Frederick's victory at Kesselsdorf on 12 December 1745 rendered Augustus more amenable. Villiers made several journeys between Prague and Berlin during the negotiations, and peace was eventually signed on Christmas day 1745. These efforts gained for Villiers Frederick's good opinion, and on 3 January 1746 he was appointed resident minister at Berlin, where he resided from 22 February to 5 September 1746. Horace Walpole, however, attributed Frederick's liking for Villiers to his dislike of men of ability: &#145;[Villiers] has, you know, been very much <i>gazetted</i>, and had his letters to the king of Prussia printed, but he is a very silly fellow&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 20.17).<br>
<br>In February 1748 Villiers retired from the diplomatic service and devoted himself to home politics. He had been returned to parliament for Tamworth on 3 July 1747, in spite of his confession to Walpole that he did not understand elections, and on 24 December 1748 he was made a lord of the Admiralty in Henry Pelham's administration. He was re-elected for Tamworth on 18 April 1754, but vacated the seat on his creation, on 3 June 1756, as Baron Hyde of Hindon. He had married, on 30 March 1752, Lady Charlotte (1721&#150;1790), third but eldest surviving daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4588/', "William Capel, third earl of Essex (1697&#150;1743)")</script>, and coheir of his first wife, Lady Jane Hyde (<i>d</i>. 1724), daughter of Henry Hyde, fourth and last earl of Clarendon of the first creation. They had three sons and one daughter. The second son was the politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28301/', "John Charles Villiers, third earl of Clarendon")</script>.<br>
<br>On 2 September 1763 Hyde was sworn of the privy council, and on the 10th he was appointed joint postmaster-general in Grenville's administration. He was chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster from 14 June 1771 to 1782, during Lord North's administration. On 14 June 1776 he was created earl of Clarendon of the second creation, and on 16 July 1782 obtained license to add to his arms the royal eagle of Prussia, for Frederick III had created him a count of that kingdom. In 1783 he joined the opposition to Pitt's administration.<br>
<br>Clarendon died at Watford on 11 December 1786, and was buried there on the 20th. He was succeeded in the title by his eldest son, Thomas (1753&#150;1824).<br>
