<span class="headword">Thorius,  Raphael</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1625), <span class="occ">physician and poet</span>, was born at Belle, Flanders, the son of Francis Thorius, a well-known French physician and poet, who befriended the protestant poet Daniel Rogers during the latter's visit to Paris in 1565. In May 1570 Rogers wrote a poem for and about Francis, <span class="italic">Ad Franciscum Thorium medicum et poetam</span>, which indicates that by then Francis had fled France as a protestant, to settle in Belle. Raphael Thorius studied medicine at Oxford, but graduated MD from Leiden, where he matriculated in medicine on 31 December 1590 and received his MD only twelve days later, with a thesis on dropsy. He then began to practise in London, but without a licence from the College of Physicians. In 1593 he was threatened with imprisonment after one of his English patients died, and three years later found himself in trouble again with the College of Physicians for practising without a licence. This time, however, on 23 December 1596, he was admitted to the college as a licentiate. On his return from Leiden, Thorius first resided in the parish of St Gabriel Fenchurch in London, where he developed a successful practice. Later he moved to the parish of St Benet Finck.<br>
<br>Like his father, Thorius was a learned humanist and a distinguished Latin poet. He published only a couple of works during his lifetime. His <span class="italic">In orbitum Jo. Barclaii elegia</span> (1621) includes a poem entitled &#145;Venator&#146;, which defends the then embattled Archbishop George Abbot. The following year one of his poems was included in the commemorative volume <span class="italic">Epicedia in orbitum</span>, for Simon Ruytinck, the minister to the Dutch Reformed community in London. Among those who contributed to this volume were some of his colleagues and fellow Reformed refugees from the College of Physicians, Johannes Brovaert and Baldwin Hamey, not to mention two of his friends, the Anglo-Dutch merchant Jacob Cool and the Dutch diplomat and humanist Sir Constantijn Huygens. Thorius was closely associated with the foreign Reformed communities in London. In 1604 he and Jacob Cool were chosen to write the poetry needed in connection with the triumphal arch erected by the Dutch community in London to celebrate James I's coronation entry into the city.<br>
<br>Thorius's most famous work, <span class="italic">Hymnus tabaci</span>, written in 1610, but later revised and augmented in 1625, was published posthumously in London in 1626. It proved popular and went through several editions. The poem, which is divided into two books, is an elegant composition in hexameters and deserves a place among the metrical works of physicians beside the <span class="italic">Syphilis</span> of Hieronymus Fracastorius, which may well have inspired it. Thorius also completed, in 1625, another long poem, <span class="italic">Hyems</span>, which he dedicated to Constantijn Huygens, whom he had befriended during the latter's visit to England in 1618&#150;19. A manuscript volume of his and his father's poems is preserved in the British Library (Sloane MS 1768). It contains mainly Latin poems, some of which, like those praising the Huguenot prince Henri of Navarre, later King Henri IV of France, show their protestantism. The volume also incorporates a number of smaller poems by Raphael Thorius to friends, such as Theodore de Mayerne, William Camden, Meric Casaubon, and Matthias Lobel, plus the poems written for King James's coronation entry, and what is probably the original copy of book 1 of his poem on tobacco.<br>
<br>Thorius had a wife, Mary, and seven children: Jean, Elizabeth, John, Paul, Francis, Matthew, and James. John became a physician and received his MD from Leiden in 1626. Thorius died of the plague in his house in St Benet Finck in July or August 1625.<br>
