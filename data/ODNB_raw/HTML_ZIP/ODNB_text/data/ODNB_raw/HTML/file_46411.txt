<span class="headword">Lewknor, Sir  Lewes</span>  (<em>c.</em>1560&#150;1627), <span class="occ">courtier and translator</span>, was the first surviving son of Thomas Lewknor (<i>c</i>.1538&#150;1596), a politician, of Tangmere and Selsey, Sussex, and his first wife, Bridget, the daughter of John Lewes of Selsey. From Lyon's Inn, Lewknor entered the Middle Temple on 12 October 1579, bound with his uncle, Richard Lewknor (1542&#150;1616), a distinguished lawyer. However, his Catholicism led him into voluntary exile in the Low Countries the following year. A captaincy in the Spanish service and marriage to Beatrice de Rota, the daughter of a Brabant merchant, soon followed, but a severe arm wound ended his military career. The loss of his pension, combined with litigation over his wife's dowry, brought severe financial difficulties, and in June 1590 Lewknor sought a safe conduct home through his relative Sir Robert Sidney. He reported in detail to Burghley on Englishmen in the Spanish service and was probably the anonymous author of <span class="italic">A Discourse of the Usage of the English Fugitives, by the Spaniard</span>, first published early in 1595; such co-operation gained protection from creditors. In 1591 Lewknor was in the suite of the embassy to France of his cousin Sir Henry Unton. His first acknowledged work, <span class="italic">The Resolved Gentleman</span>, an indirect translation (from Acu&ntilde;a's Spanish) of <span class="italic">Le chevalier d&eacute;lib&eacute;r&eacute;</span> by Olivier de la Marche, appeared in 1594. It was dedicated to Anne, countess of Warwick, who was related to Lewknor through the Sidneys.<br>
<br>Following his father's death in 1596, Lewknor took possession of Selsey Park and the adjacent grange. (These were leased from the crown and surrendered in 1612.) Lewknor was returned to parliament in October 1597 for Midhurst, his father's old seat, probably through the interest of his uncle Richard.<br>
<br>In August 1598 Lewknor completed for Lady Warwick <span class="italic">The Commonwealth and Government of Venice</span>, largely a translation of Gasparo Contarini's <span class="italic">De magistratibus et republica Venetorum</span>. Commendatory poems in this and <span class="italic">The Resolved Gentleman</span> show him to have been an admired member of a literary circle that included John Harrington and, possibly, Edmund Spenser; and it has been argued that Lewknor provided source material for Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Merchant of Venice</span> and Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Volpone</span>.<br>
<br>Lewknor claimed <span class="italic">The Commonwealth</span> was &#145;written at idle times when I had nothing els to doe, being at much more leysure then willingly I woulde bee&#146;  (sig. A3<i>v</i>), but its publication occurred as his various duties mounted. In 1599 he became a gentleman pensioner. The next year he was called on to supervise arrangements for hosting diplomats and other foreign dignitaries, his first recorded attendance on an ambassador being in February 1600. He also acted as an interpreter of Spanish. When still perfecting that language he had translated Antonio de Torquemada's <span class="italic">Jard&iacute;n de flores curiosas</span>, and this was now brought into print by Ferdinando Walker as <span class="italic">The Spanish Mandevile of Miracles, or, The Garden of Curious Flowers</span>.<br>
<br>James I's succession in 1603 brought great benefits for Lewknor. On 22 April he was knighted; then on 21 May he was appointed master of the ceremonies, a newly created office that Sir Edmund Tilney had hoped for. This position formalized Lewknor's duties in respect of looking after diplomats and other important foreigners. Assisted by up to three deputies, he initiated the management of precedence and protocol that was so important in the seventeenth century and is still embodied in the office of marshal of the diplomatic corps. The following year he was again returned to parliament, this time for Bridgnorth (his uncle Richard being then justice of Chester).<br>
<br>Beatrice Lewknor died on 11 March 1605 after a long illness. Lewknor then married a young widow called Argall, but she died that October of smallpox. Such personal sorrow contrasted with public achievement. On 7 November 1605 Lewknor was granted for life his office of master of the ceremonies. His assistant master of ceremonies from 1612 was John Finet. The two were often on bad terms, Finet being very solicitous in his duties and Lewknor apparently feeling that his junior was encroaching on his prerogatives. Many of Lewknor's activities after October 1612 were recorded in Finet's notes, published posthumously in 1656 as <span class="italic">Finetti philoxenis: Som Choice Observations of Sir John Finet</span>. By 1613 Lewknor was a justice of the peace for Middlesex, and on 25 September 1614 he was appointed a commissioner for the musters in the same county.<br>
<br>If Lewknor ever shed his Spanish sympathies, they soon returned. In Spanish pay since at least July 1603, he was seen as among those &#145;that have Englishe tongues and Spanishe harts&#146;  (William Trumbull to Ralph Winwood, 14/24 Feb 1617, <span class="italic">Downshire MSS</span>, 6.112, no. 258). In 1615 Lewknor sent his younger son William over to Antwerp to supervise the litigation surrounding the estate of his first wife, Beatrice. By the following year William was serving in the Spanish garrison there. On 17 April 1618 Lewknor himself wrote to Diego de la Fuente, confessor to the Spanish ambassador Gondomar: &#145;Todo el consuelo que tengo en este mundo esta puesto en el fauor del Se&ntilde;or Conde y vuestra Paternidad&#146; (&#145;All the consolation that I have in this world rests in the favour of his lordship the count [Gondomar] and your [Fuente's] paternity&#146;; Loomie, <span class="italic">Spain and the Jacobean Catholics</span>, 2.104). In 1623 Finet suggested that Lewknor &#145;leaned overmuch&#146; to achieve the &#145;particular satisfaction&#146; of the Spanish ambassador, and the following year he recorded Conway's comment that Lewknor &#145;would rather attend the Spanish ambassadors than the Dutch&#146;  (<span class="italic">Finetti philoxenis</span>, 118, 138). Such partiality had angered the less pecunious Venetian diplomats since 1606, and matters came to a head in 1625 when the Venetian ambassador Pesaro complained that Lewknor, whom he described as &#145;an utter Spaniard, and a pensioner&#146;  (Pesaro to doge and senate, 25 May 1625, <span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1625&#150;6</i>, 55), had slighted him by favouring his Spanish counterpart. The privy council accepted Lewknor's plea that sickness, rather than disrespect, was the cause, but found it politic to suspend him from office and put him under house arrest from October until December.<br>
<br>Lewknor died on 11 March 1627, survived by his third wife, Mary, the daughter of Richard Blount of Dedisham, Sussex, whom he had married some time after 1605, and by at least his first son, Thomas (1588&#150;1645), a Jesuit who ministered in England from 1625 until his death. Lewknor was a man of varied talents and even Finet, his successor as master of the ceremonies, with whom he often quarrelled, could admit that, &#145;to say the truth, the gentleman him self for his many good partes deserve[s] respect, and should have more of me were he more patient and less jelous&#146;  (Finet to Trumbull, 12 Nov 1616, <span class="italic">Downshire MSS</span>, 6.43, no. 109). Lewknor's constituents in Bridgnorth bore witness to his &#145;honest and just dealing&#146; with them  (certain inhabitants of Bridgnorth to Salisbury, no date, <span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 24.197). Most tellingly, perhaps, the eulogies contained in his published works evince the esteem in which he was held by the literary coterie to which he belonged.<br>
