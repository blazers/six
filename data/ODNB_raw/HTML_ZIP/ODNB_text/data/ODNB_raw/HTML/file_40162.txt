<span class="headword">Jacobson,  Sydney</span>, Baron Jacobson  (1908&#150;1988), <span class="occ">newspaper editor and political commentator</span>, was born on 26 October 1908 in Zeerost, Transvaal, the only son and elder child of Samuel and Anna Jacobson, a Jewish couple who had emigrated from Germany and were running an unsuccessful ostrich farm. In the summer of 1914 the family returned to Frankfurt am Main to visit friends and were unfortunate enough to stay on until August, when they were all interned. Jacobson thus obtained his primary education in a German camp, a more humane version of the camps which were to fire his hatred of Germans in the 1930s and 1940s. His father was drowned when the ship in which he was attempting to return to South Africa sank off the south-west coast of England. His mother then took her children to live in Britain with relatives, the family of Lewis Silkin, later a government minister.<br>
<br>Jacobson attended Strand School and then King's College, London, where he obtained a diploma in journalism. He began his journalistic career on weekly papers in Sussex. He soon left for India, however, where he became assistant editor of <span class="italic">The Statesman</span> (1934&#150;6), a reservist with the Delhi light horse, and a daring steeplechase jockey. On his return to England he worked for the pocket-sized magazine <span class="italic">Lilliput</span> (1936&#150;9). In 1938 he married Phyllis June (<i>d</i>. 1988), daughter of Frank Steele Buck, stockbroker; they had two sons and one daughter. He enlisted as a private immediately war was declared, was commissioned in the Middlesex regiment, was awarded the MC in 1944 for his resolute defence of a bridge during the 1944 fighting in the Low Countries, and was promoted lieutenant-colonel and given command of his battalion. On demobilization he wrote for <span class="italic">Picture Post</span> (1945&#150;8) and obtained his first editorship at the <span class="italic">Leader Magazine</span> (1948&#150;50), a paper which was a journalistic success but a financial failure. Soon after it ceased publication he began his association with the Mirror group, writing first for the <span class="italic">Sunday Pictorial</span> (1951) under Hugh Cudlipp and then for the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> as its political editor (1952&#150;62).<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> was a noisy, disputatious paper but Jacobson, a quiet man who was erudite, sceptical, and mordant, nevertheless fitted in perfectly. With Cudlipp he produced coruscating attacks on the governments of Churchill, Eden, and Macmillan. Although he was on the far left when young he moved sufficiently to give notable support to Hugh Gaitskell, whose speeches he occasionally helped to write. During the Suez crisis of 1956 Jacobson was instrumental in shifting the <span class="italic">Mirror</span> from early acquiescence to outright opposition, a policy which reduced its circulation by 70,000. In fact it was prepared to lose many more readers.<br>
<br>When the Mirror group bought Odhams Press in 1961 Jacobson was made editor of the loss-making <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span> (1962&#150;4), the organ of the Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party. He remained editor (1964&#150;5) after it was transmuted into <span class="italic">The Sun</span>, a middlebrow paper created to fill what was thought to be a gap in the market but which was proved not to exist. As its losses mounted the paper was sold (almost given away) to Rupert Murdoch in 1969 and Jacobson returned to the <span class="italic">Mirror</span>, where he became editorial director (1968&#150;74) and later deputy chairman (1973&#150;4) of the group.<br>
<br>In the two general elections of 1974, in February and October, Jacobson was at his peak. Determined that the Labour Party should win, he produced a series of famous poster-type front pages, inspired every leading article, and oversaw all the political stories. With election results as close as they were in both elections, his contributions must have been significant. He had refused a knighthood when he was editing the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span>, but after his retirement he accepted the offer of a life peerage in 1975.<br>
<br>Jacobson had hoped to play an active part in the House of Lords, but his later years were affected by ill health. They were also marred by the misfortunes of the Labour Party and by what was happening at the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>. After Robert Maxwell became its publisher in 1983 Jacobson stopped buying the paper he had served for so long.<br>
<br>Jacobson was a tall, distinguished-looking man with a large nose and sardonic smile. He died on 13 August 1988 in St Albans, Hertfordshire, where his home was at 6 Avenue Road.<br>
