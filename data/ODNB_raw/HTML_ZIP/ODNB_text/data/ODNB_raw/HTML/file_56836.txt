<span class="headword">Colyer, Sir  (James) Frank</span>  (1866&#150;1954), <span class="occ">dental surgeon and museum curator</span>, was born on 25 September 1866 at 2 Loughborough Villas, Loughborough Road, Lambeth, London, one of the sons of James Colyer, dentist, and his wife, Rebecca Hastings, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Farrow. There is no information about Colyer's early years, but by the time he became a student at the Royal Dental Hospital, London, it was clear that he had exceptional talents and a natural aptitude for dental surgery. He quickly gained a reputation for his skill and intellect, quick mind, and responsive hands, and at the age of just twenty, in November 1887, he qualified LDS. Following the advice of the then dean of the school, Morton A. Smale, that a dentist should also be a qualified surgeon, Colyer studied at Charing Cross Hospital, London, and became MRCS LRCP in 1889.<br>
<br>As well as developing his private practice Colyer held a number of hospital and other appointments: he became consultant dental surgeon at Charing Cross Hospital and at the Royal Dental Hospital, and he was honorary consultant dental surgeon to the Croydon War Hospital, the Ministry of Pensions, and the Queen's Hospital, Sidcup, Kent. Dental students who were fortunate enough to come under his wing found Colyer an inspired teacher, who was unceasingly fair and generous in his outlook. His dynamic personality and natural gift for public speaking were enhanced by his brilliant memory, so that he rarely relied upon notes. In his spare time Colyer enjoyed ball games and took pleasure in a round of golf, but his particular passion was cricket, and he seldom missed a match at Lord's.<br>
<br>Colyer's marriage on 11 March 1896 to Lucy Olivia Margaret Anna Simpson (1871/2&#150;1950), daughter of George Simpson, a wholesale bookbinder, was an enduring and supportive relationship, but was marred by the untimely death of their youngest daughter, Eileen, a talented lawn-tennis player. The couple had one other daughter and a son.<br>
<br>Colyer was the recipient of many prizes and honours, both in England and North America. Included among these was his admission to the fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1916, and the honour of being created a knight of the British empire in 1920, for services rendered during the war. The Royal Society of Medicine also paid him a great tribute when in 1926 they named a prize after him, a rare accolade to be made during a person's lifetime.<br>
<br>As well as the practice and teaching of dentistry, Colyer was a prolific journalist and author. He contributed many articles to professional journals and wrote numerous books on dental subjects. His earliest such work, <span class="italic">Diseases and Injuries of the Teeth</span> (first published in 1892, co-written with Morton A. Smale, and later revised with the help of Evelyn Sprawson and reissued as <span class="italic">Dental Surgery and Pathology</span>), was a textbook which filled a gap in the sphere of teaching. It ran to many editions and became widely accepted as the bible of dental students and practitioners alike. Other important works reflected Colyer's lifelong interest in the history of dentistry. He received wide acclaim for his book <span class="italic">John Hunter and Odontology</span> (1913), but was perhaps best-known for his work <span class="italic">Old Instruments used for Extracting Teeth</span> (1952), which came about largely as a result of his long-term involvement with the Odontological Society.<br>
<br>Colyer was already secretary and editor of <span class="italic">Transactions of the Odontological Society</span> when, in 1900, he accepted the post of honorary (unpaid) curator of the society's museum, then housed at the Royal Dental Hospital, and subsequently resited at the Royal College of Surgeons. The museum's collection, which was later described by Sir Arthur Keith as the most complete representation of the history and diseases of teeth in the world  (Keith, 304&#150;5), was Colyer's personal passion, and he became the presiding genius over it. For fifty years he devoted hours of his time and energy, and much of his own money, to arranging and cataloguing the specimens, and he was distraught when a massive bomb fell on the museum in May 1941, destroying thousands of irreplaceable specimens.<br>
<br>Colyer remained in London but his latter years, especially after his wife's death in 1950, were fraught with problems: his personal position as curator of the museum became somewhat difficult and he found it hard to accept the changing policy of the council of the Royal College of Surgeons, which seemed to him to value the social aspects and teaching policy of the college over that of the Hunterian Museum, of which he was trustee. Added to this, the collection of the Odontological Museum was dismantled, and only a few cases of specimens were transferred to the general museum. Ever mindful of the needs of students, and displaying extreme spirit, he continued cataloguing new specimens, even though this meant working in very difficult conditions in dingy premises in Lincoln's Inn Fields.<br>
<br>Colyer died at his home, Queenswood, 39 Palace Road, Streatham, London, on 30 March 1954. A memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 12 April 1954.<br>
