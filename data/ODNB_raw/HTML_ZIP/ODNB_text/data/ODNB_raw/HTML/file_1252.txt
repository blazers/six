<span class="headword">Baltroddi,  Walter  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1270), <span class="occ">bishop of Caithness</span>, succeeded to that see in 1261. His name probably derives from Baltroddi in Gowrie, Perthshire, now represented by Pitroddie, but his family affiliations are unknown. He was styled master by 1259, but it is not known which university he attended. He held an Aberdeen canonry and a Caithness canonry at the time of his election by the Caithness chapter. The papal mandate for his installation expressed some doubts about his legitimacy, but ordered three bishops to examine him, and promote and consecrate him if suitable. Nothing is known of his time as bishop, although his see would have been disturbed during the 1263&#150;4 expedition to the north and west of Scotland by the king of Norway, Haakon IV Haakonsson, which affected Caithness, as did the Scottish king's response during the following years. There is a tradition in clan Mackay history that Iye Mor Mackay married a daughter of Bishop Walter, and thus acquired the twelve davachs (units of land) which formed the episcopal estate in Durness (the most north-westerly headland of the Scottish mainland, comprising, unusually, fertile limestone pasture). Bishop Baltroddi died in 1270, according to Walter Bower, who describes him as &#145;discreet in counsel and commendable in the holiness of his life&#146;  (Bower, 5.379). He was mentioned in 1275 as having been involved in disputes, as had his predecessors Gilbert and William, with the earl of Sutherland over lands and rights in south-east Sutherland. These presumably stemmed from the endowments of the cathedral church at Dornoch, founded by Bishop Gilbert earlier in the thirteenth century.<br>
