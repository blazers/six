<span class="headword">Wakeford,  John</span>  (1859&#150;1930), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 26 October 1859 at 21 Claremont Terrace, Prince of Wales Road, Kentish Town, the second son (one of eight surviving children) of William Wakeford, then a Metropolitan Police sergeant and afterwards police superintendent of Devonport dockyards, and his wife, Catherine Crocker. His chief education was acquired on the streets of Devonport and by private study. Despite his social and educational disadvantages he was ordained, and in 1885 was appointed curate of West Alvington, Devon. His ardour and zeal found fulfilment as an itinerant rural missioner in the dioceses of Exeter and Chichester (1886&#150;93). Wakeford married, in 1893, Evelyn Mary, daughter of John Worthington, rector of Northlew and a member of the brewing family. They had a son and daughter.<br>
<br>At W. E. Gladstone's recommendation Wakeford was appointed in 1893 as vicar of the poor, sprawling parish of St Margaret's, Anfield, where the <span class="italic">Liverpool Review</span> reported &#145;his intense vitality, his volcanic energy, his fire, his earnestness, his enthusiasm&#146;  (Treherne, 53). Though he enjoyed the confidence of his congregation, outsiders demonstrated against his high-church practices, which included masses and confessionals. In 1899&#150;1904 he was calumnied by militant Protestant agitators led by George Wise (1856&#150;1917), pastor of the Protestant Reformers' Church in Liverpool, who claimed that ritualism corrupted women: &#145;weak feminine minds are readily led astray by theatricalism&#146;  (Treherne, 59). Wakeford was involved in two libel actions.<br>
<br>Wakeford became BD at Durham (1901), passed his intermediate law examinations at London University (1902), lectured in pastoral theology at King's College, London (1911&#150;12), and published numerous devotional and doctrinal writings. He was appointed canon and precentor of Lincoln (1912), archdeacon of Stow (1913), and vicar of Kirkstead (1914) by Bishop Edward Lee Hicks, who respected &#145;his powers of physical endurance, of memory and observation, of spiritual instruction and mystical exposition&#146;, but regretted his tactlessness and &#145;peremptory handling of what he thought laxity among the clergy&#146;  (Fowler, 246). There were many malicious intrigues in the cathedral chapter, and Wakeford had a powerful adversary in the dean, T. C. Fry.<br>
<br>In February 1921 Wakeford was found guilty by Lincoln consistory court on charges of adultery at the Bull Hotel, Peterborough, on 14&#150;16 March and 2 April 1920. The evidence against him had been collected by a detective hired by the Revd C. Thomas Moore, who detested Wakeford and had himself appeared before a consistory court in 1915 on a charge of immorality instigated by Wakeford. Moore acted in concert with his friend the Revd Herbert Worthington, Wakeford's brother-in-law and enemy. The Lincoln hearings were both ill-managed and unjust. Though the testimony against Wakeford seemed strong, he insisted that the most damaging witnesses had been suborned. Afterwards, much of the incriminating evidence proved nugatory: there was tampering with the hotel registration book, for example, and an apparently guilty remark attributed to Wakeford by the hotel staff was, in fact, uttered as a joke by another guest, Edmund Blunden, who became a strong and reasoned supporter of Wakeford. The case aroused intense public excitement. However, the judicial committee of the privy council to which Wakeford appealed in April 1921 was unable to accept his theory of an elaborate conspiracy (perhaps because this would have required police corruption). Wakeford was deprived of his preferments but not (according to precedent) of his holy orders. He conducted a platform campaign across the country, supported by Horatio Bottomley, who saw the case as an opportunity to revive the popularity of his <span class="italic">John Bull</span> newspaper. Wakeford was bankrupted in 1924 by continuing legal costs. He lived on the proceeds of his wife's poultry farming at Biggin Hill until he was committed in March 1928 to Barming Heath Asylum, Maidstone, Kent, where he died of heart failure on 13 February 1930. He was buried in Cudham churchyard.<br>
