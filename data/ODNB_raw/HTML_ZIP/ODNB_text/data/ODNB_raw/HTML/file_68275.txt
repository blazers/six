<span class="headword">Tomkys,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1592), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was a native of Bilston, near Wolverhampton, the son of Richard Tomkys, who seems to have been a person of some substance, since his &#145;ancestors&#146; were buried in Wolverhampton church. Although he was credited with an MA by his employers at Shrewsbury, no record of a university education has survived. However, a dedicatory epistle acknowledges that he was maintained in his studies by a Staffordshire neighbour, Sir Richard Pipe, lord mayor of London, whose sons Humfrey and Samuel, Tomkys remembered in his will with gifts of religious books. This education may conceivably have taken Tomkys to Switzerland, whether or not as a Marian exile, since he published translations from French and Latin of works by the Z&uuml;rich reformer Heinrich Bullinger and dedicated the first of these to his diocesan, Thomas Bentham, who had ministered in the English congregation at Geneva. In a dedication to Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, Tomkys recalls serving &#145;at his spiritual table&#146; &#145;in the county of Stafford where I was born&#146;  (Tomkys, <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached the 26 Day of May 1584</span>, 1586).<br>
<br>Nothing more is known of Tomkys's career until in 1582 he left Bilston for Shrewsbury, where he succeeded Edward Bulkeley as &#145;public preacher&#146;. His appointment was backed by Sir George Bromley, elder brother of Sir Thomas Bromley, lord chancellor, who was Shrewsbury's recorder. Bulkeley had been paid the large salary of &pound;72, raised partly from voluntary contributions, partly from the revenues of Shrewsbury School, to which the tithes of the two principal parish churches were appropriated. With the arrival of Tomkys, the town assembly attempted to place this burden on the entire rateable community. Tomkys was also incumbent of the royal peculiar of St Mary's, Shrewsbury, and as such styled himself &#145;Her Majesties Stipendiary Minister&#146;. In reality he was employed by the town. The peculiar conveyed the right to hold a consistory court, an asset which was leased from Shrewsbury School. Here Tomkys announced seventy-nine visitation articles, which may be called, <i>&agrave; la</i> Geneva, the ecclesiastical ordinances of Shrewsbury, enforcing stringent requirements in respect of church attendance and sabbath observance, and forbidding various &#145;notorious sins&#146;. Evidently the arrival on the scene of Tomkys represented a tightening of the ratchet of reformation in what was already a protestant town with some aspirations towards godliness. Tomkys published his own catechism dedicated to &#145;Christian parents and godly householders&#146;, and attempted to purge St Mary's Church of its stone altar and other superstitious images. That these, and especially the altar, had survived until this late date is remarkable, raising questions about the thoroughness of Reformation processes in pre-Tomkys Shrewsbury. A fortnight after these acts of iconoclasm, the earl of Leicester paid a notable civic visit and Tomkys published the sermon he preached on the occasion, the only sermon preached before the earl to have been printed.<br>
<br>The tight discipline enforced by Tomkys, with the backing of a magistracy dominated by the company of the drapers (and Tomkys lived in the guildhall of the drapers), met with spirited resistance. This clustered around the symbol of the shearmen's tree, a kind of maypole erected in celebration of their annual midsummer feast by the members of a trade and company, many of whose members were effectively dependent on the drapers for employment. Tomkys in his sermons began the campaign against the tree, and in 1591, when the younger drapers defied an order forbidding the setting up of the tree &#145;in superstitious order&#146;  (Somerset, 252) and were involved in a legal <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>, he was subjected to the shaming ritual of a charivari. Three years later, further trouble over the tree led to a murder and the execution of two young apprentices, in circumstances which included Anglo-Welsh tension and something of a craft, if not class, war, as well as the religious and moral issues at stake.<br>
<br>But Tomkys had died before this, on 23 June 1592, in Shrewsbury, where a day later he was buried, his death, according to a local chronicler, much lamented &#145;of the perfect protestants&#146; of the town  (Leighton, 324). He had buried his wife (her name is unknown) in 1584 and now asked to be buried beside her, but not for any &#145;superstitious&#146; reason, and he forbade ringing, alms giving, and &#145;entertaining of friends&#146; at his funeral  (Mander, 69&#150;83). His son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27519/', "Thomas Tomkis")</script>, who was a scholar at Trinity College, Cambridge, wrote the comedy <span class="italic">Albumazar</span>, which was performed before James I and appeared in nine editions between 1615 and 1634. It is unlikely that so perfect a protestant, not to say puritan, as his father would have approved of such a thing. Tomkys himself published his catechism, <span class="italic">A Briefe Exposition of the Lordes Prayer</span> (1585), his sermon preached on 26 May 1584 (1586), and, translated from Bullinger, <span class="italic">A most Excellent Sermon of the Lordes Supper</span> (<i>c</i>.1577) and <span class="italic">A most Godly and Learned Discourse of the Woorthynesse &hellip; of the Holy Scripture</span> (1579).<br>
