</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">O'Casey,  Sean</span>  (1880&#150;1964), <span class="occ">playwright and writer</span>, born on 30 March 1880 at 85 Upper Dorset Street, Dublin, was baptized John Casey on 28 July, the youngest of the five children surviving into adulthood of Michael Casey (<i>c</i>.1836&#150;1886), a clerk for the Irish Church Mission, and his wife, Susan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Archer (1836/7&#150;1918). The facts surrounding John Casey's childhood are vague, a situation not helped by the playwright's tendency to memorial mythologizing in his later years. Clearly the family lived in relative poverty after the father's death, the quality of their actual homes deteriorating with each of several shifts of residence; but they appear not to have known the abject indigence prevalent in many a Dublin tenement. Susan Casey, daughter of an auctioneer, strove to preserve a semblance of protestant gentility; her writer son, as his socialist sympathies grew, tended to stress a solidarity with the working-class values and lifestyle of their Catholic neighbours.<br>
<br>The onset of trachoma in his childhood greatly affected Casey's sight for the rest of his life; initially, it seriously affected his ability to undergo a sustained education, though his sister Isabella, a trained schoolmistress, did secure him a modicum of traditional schooling. Though he was largely self-taught, his reading was avid, open-minded, and wide-ranging. Equally varied with adulthood were his growing allegiances to cultural and political organizations. When he joined the Drumcondra branch of the Gaelic League in 1906, with the intention of learning the Irish language, he Gaelicized his name to Sean O'Cathasaigh; for their <span class="italic">Journal</span> he wrote his first stories. From 1907 he was a member of the St Laurence O'Toole Club and he was founder member and secretary of the St Laurence O'Toole Pipers Band. He joined Jim Larkin's Irish Transport and General Workers' Union in 1911, and was secretary first of the Women and Children's Relief Fund during the Dublin lock-out strike of 1913 and later of the union's most militant wing, the Irish Citizen Army (ICA). Although he resigned this position in 1914, when the ICA backed Patrick Pearse's revolutionary stance and severely criticized the Easter rising of 1916, he was to publish <span class="italic">The Story of the Irish Citizen Army</span> in 1919. After his sacking from the Great Northern Railway in 1911, what earned income he had over this period came from casual labour. He appears not to have begun playwriting until <i>c</i>.1916 when the Abbey Theatre rejected <span class="italic">Profit and Loss</span>, but by then certain abiding values had become fixed: a fervent championing of social equality and as fervent a hatred of all processes or institutions that he saw as entrapping the human spirit, inciting enmity or aggression, or provoking death. These values were to inform all his future writing, together with an exuberant joy in language and a highly attuned ear for the niceties of Dublin speech and its idiosyncratic rhythms and phrasing.<br>
<br>By 1920, when he began regularly submitting plays to the Abbey Theatre, O'Cathasaigh had re-Anglicized his name to Sean O'Casey. The Abbey directors rejected his next four submissions (<span class="italic">The Harvest Festival</span>, <span class="italic">The Frost in the Flower</span>, <span class="italic">The Seamless Coat of Kathleen</span>, and <span class="italic">The Crimson in the Tri-Colour</span>) but the fifth, <span class="italic">The Shadow of a Gunman</span>, was accepted for staging in April 1923. It established the form that his next two major plays would follow, investigating the impact of events sparked by national political unrest (the black and tan raids in this instance) on the lives of impoverished tenement families. O'Casey's was what Brecht would term an epic drama by virtue of its exploration of the relationship between the processes of political history and the apparent vagaries of everyday contingencies in working-class life. The action of <span class="italic">Juno and the Paycock</span> (staged March 1924) is situated during the civil war, while <span class="italic">The Plough and the Stars</span> (staged February 1926) is set at the time of the Easter rising. In all three plays the violence of the public world sets at hazard the attempts by the characters within their domestic sphere to sustain an indomitable spirit; and this juxtaposition creates the unique tone of O'Casey's drama which is skilfully pitched between the comic and the tragic, the one never quite asserting pre-eminence over the other as the action unfolds. What impresses is the rapidity with which O'Casey mastered stagecraft, learning to deploy stage space, properties, and settings to enhance and develop his themes in ways which owe little to the Irish dramatic tradition which preceded him. He evolved too a wholly new depiction of working-class heroism, focused especially on his female characters who resiliently refuse to succumb to circumstance, whatever social adversities confront them.<br>
<br>It was wholly fitting that W. B. Yeats should describe O'Casey as a genius when defending <span class="italic">The Plough and the Stars</span> against nationalist rioters at its fourth performance: O'Casey's innovations in dramaturgy in the six years since he had first offered a play to the Abbey were remarkable, as was reflected in the award of the Hawthornden Prize for <span class="italic">Juno</span> in 1926. But that questing innovatory impulse was steadily to take O'Casey further away from the Abbey in ensuing years. The visit to London to receive the Hawthornden introduced him to George Bernard Shaw and Augustus John, who painted his portrait in May 1926, and to West End managements who could offer greater financial recompense for his work than the Abbey could hope to equal. There too he met his future wife, Eileen Carey.<br>
<br>Eileen Carey was the stage name of the singer&#150;actress Eileen Kathleen Reynolds [<a name="cosubject_56440"></a><span class="headword">Eileen Kathleen O'Casey</span>  (1900&#150;1995)], daughter of Edward Reynolds, of Athlone, Westmeath, and Kathleen Carey (<i>d</i>. 1962), from Belmullet, co. Mayo. She was born in Dublin on 27 December 1900, when the family returned from Johannesburg with the outbreak of the South African War. She was chiefly educated as an orphan at an Ursuline convent school in Brentwood, Essex, after her father was institutionalized on account of his increasing mental instability, forcing her mother, a fiercely indomitable woman, to work for their security. After various forms of employment, Eileen Reynolds began her theatrical career in London in the chorus of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company (1923) and then worked increasingly in musical comedy (<span class="italic">The First Kiss</span> in 1924, <span class="italic">Love's Prisoner</span> and <span class="italic">Rose Marie</span> in 1925) before attempting to find employment in America. She and O'Casey met on her return, after a performance of the London production of <span class="italic">Juno and the Paycock</span>. In 1926, though contracted as understudy, she took over the role of Nora Clitheroe for the initial performances of the first English staging of <span class="italic">The Plough and the Stars</span> (a part she believed O'Casey was instrumental in her getting). Later she was directed by Barry Jackson as Minnie Powell in <span class="italic">The Shadow of a Gunman</span> at the Royal Court. The couple were married at the church of All Souls and the Redeemer, Chelsea, on 23 September 1927.<br>
<br>Despite a protracted holiday in Ireland by way of honeymoon, the couple appear never to have considered settling in Dublin; by January 1928 they had found a home at 19 Woronzow Road, St John's Wood, where their son Breon was born the following April. However, what confirmed O'Casey's decision to begin a lifelong exile in England was the Abbey's rejection that same April of <span class="italic">The Silver Tassie</span>. The Abbey arguably did not possess the resources to stage the play in the monumental manner which it clearly demanded, but Yeats couched his refusal in aesthetic terms (chiefly that the First World War was not a subject for drama) which O'Casey found insulting and absurd. O'Casey took issue and, not for the last time in his career, went public with the debate, clearly relishing a new-found gift for vituperation. (James Agate, No&euml;l Coward, Kingsley Martin, Malcolm Muggeridge, George Orwell, and the archbishop of Dublin were all to suffer O'Casey's attack.) The play was eventually staged by C. B. Cochran at the Apollo Theatre, London, in October 1929 with a setting for the scene in the trenches by Augustus John. It was that second act (not the three remaining acts set in Dublin) with its daring mixture of ritualism, doggerel, the choric and scenographic techniques of German expressionism, and quotation from the Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> which indicated the path that O'Casey's imagination was now to follow.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Within the Gates</span> (staged February 1934) and <span class="italic">The Star Turns Red</span> (staged by the Unity Theatre in March, 1940) are modern morality plays, their didacticism offset as in many expressionist dramas by a brilliant deployment of stylized scenic effects and passages of powerful choral chanting. They are very much of their time, especially <span class="italic">The Star Turns Red</span> with its confrontation of fascist and communist forces; but both contain passages of sexual lyricism and of wry knockabout comedy, which are not to be found in the German prototype of this genre of play. These passages together with the scenic experimentalism foreshadow the wholly unique style of theatre that O'Casey was to invent for his last plays. The thirties were a difficult period. Eileen's theatrical engagements were sporadic (notable appearances were in the chorus for No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">Bitter Sweet</span>, Rutland Boughton's <span class="italic">The Immortal Hour</span> in a revival by Barry Jackson, Reinhardt's staging of <span class="italic">The Miracle</span>, and A. P. Herbert's <span class="italic">Mother of Pearl</span>). The family moved to Chalfont St Giles and then back to Battersea, before settling by 1938 at Tingrith, a house in Totnes, Devon, to enable the children to attend Dartington School. (A second son, Niall, was born on 15 January 1935 and a daughter, Shivaun, on 28 September 1939.) The family moved again in 1954 to Villa Rosa Flats, 40 Trumlands Road, St Marychurch, Torquay. Eileen O'Casey gave up her stage career to devote herself to creating the right working environment for her husband. The banning in Ireland of <span class="italic">Windfalls</span> (a collection of stories, poems, and short plays published in 1934) initiated a series of such acts of censorship there; but compensation for this and the loss of London theatre contacts came with O'Casey's visit to New York in September that year for the American staging of <span class="italic">Within the Gates</span>, when he established friendships with critics George Jean Nathan and Brooks Atkinson and the playwright Eugene O'Neill.<br>
<br>Later there came creative compensation of a different kind. If shaping plays was a slower process for O'Casey at this time, the chance writing in 1931 of a personal sketch, &#145;A child is born&#146;, initiated a project which steadily grew into six volumes of autobiography by 1954: <span class="italic">I Knock at the Door</span> (published 1939), <span class="italic">Pictures in the Hallway</span> (1942), <span class="italic">Drums under the Windows</span> (1945), <span class="italic">Inishfallen, Fare thee Well</span> (1949), <span class="italic">Rose and Crown</span> (1952), and <span class="italic">Sunset and Evening Star</span> (1954). It was a prodigious achievement, casting a cold satirical eye on Irish and English cultural and political life, as O'Casey recorded the development of his sensibility through private triumphs and adversities in a richly rhetorical prose.<br>
<br>The fifteen years following from the staging at Dublin's Olympia Theatre in March 1943 of <span class="italic">Red Roses for Me</span> were prolific: <span class="italic">Purple Dust</span> opened at the Liverpool Playhouse in October 1945; <span class="italic">Oak Leaves and Lavender</span> in Hammersmith in May 1947; <span class="italic">Cock-a-Doodle Dandy</span> in Newcastle in 1949; <span class="italic">The Bishop's Bonfire</span> in Dublin in 1955; and <span class="italic">The Drums of Father Ned</span> was commissioned by the Dublin International Theatre Festival for 1958 but was withdrawn after clerical opposition (the premi&egrave;re was in Lafayette, Indiana, the following year). In all these plays the didactic impulse is still strong in the recurrent contrasting of fiercely anti-clerical satire with images of wild Dionysian liberation; intimations of pantomime and melodrama are present, but transformed by a personal vision that blends song, dance, vaudeville routines, magic, ecstatic drumming, knockabout farce, and stylized violence into a theatricality that is rich and enriching because fuelled continually by an urgent sense of the need to be wholly open to life's possibilities. An awareness of the dangers of repression within society brings to these plays a dark, threatening tone: the moments of transcendence are hard won and so without sentiment or whimsy. Earlier generations of English reviewers found the lack of stylistic unity irritating, because devoid of art; continental and American directors thought otherwise. It became a critical commonplace to infer that with exile from Ireland, O'Casey lost his prime inspiration; but a compassionate awareness of contemporary Ireland is deeply woven into the fabric of these plays (with the one exception of <span class="italic">Oak Leaves and Lavender</span>), showing the depth of O'Casey's detestation of de Valera's insular policies, of familism, and the bigotry they both encouraged. These late plays make profound demands in terms of ensemble playing and require highly versatile performers: being about the imagination, they ask for a vibrant and daring imagination in the staging. So too does the group of one-act plays O'Casey published in 1961 (<span class="italic">Behind the Green Curtains</span>, <span class="italic">Figuro in the Night</span>, and <span class="italic">The Moon Shines on Kylenamoe</span>), the year in which, politely but on strong socialist grounds, he refused a doctorate from Trinity College, Dublin. His prodigal genius also saw into print volumes of theatre criticism and stories: <span class="italic">The Flying Wasp</span> (1937) which was expanded into <span class="italic">The Green Crow</span> (1956) and <span class="italic">Under a Coloured Cap</span> (1963); <span class="italic">Blasts</span> appeared posthumously in 1967.<br>
<br>There seemed scant sign of failing creative powers, though O'Casey's health had been deteriorating since 1956 when he underwent two operations and suffered the death of his younger son from leukaemia. He died in Torbay Clinic, St Luke's Road, Torquay, on 18 September 1964 after sustaining a heart attack. His body was cremated four days later in Torquay, but his ashes were scattered in the gardens at Golders Green crematorium, Middlesex, on 3 October.<br>
<br>In later years the O'Caseys had enjoyed the friendship of Sean's publisher Harold Macmillan, often staying at his home. After the death of their respective spouses, Macmillan and Eileen (now living in Holland Park) sustained their friendship. How platonic their relationship remained has been a subject of some debate. At the invitation of Macmillans, Eileen O'Casey wrote a biographical memoir of her husband, published as <span class="italic">Sean</span> in 1971, and an autobiography, <span class="italic">Eileen</span>, in 1976. She died of natural causes on 9 April 1995 and was cremated at Golders Green.<br>
