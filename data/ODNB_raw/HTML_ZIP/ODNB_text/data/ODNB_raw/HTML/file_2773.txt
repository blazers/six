<span class="headword">Bohun,  Henry  de</span>, first earl of Hereford  (<em>c.</em>1175&#150;1220), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2774/', "Humphrey (III) de Bohun (b. before 1144, d. 1181)")</script> and Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1201), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12956/', "Henry of Scotland, earl of Northumberland")</script>, and widow of Conan (IV), duke of Brittany. He was identified in 1185 as a minor, aged ten, in the custody of his grandmother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/102428/', "Margaret de Bohun (c.1121&#150;1196/7)")</script>, daughter of Miles of Gloucester, earl of Hereford. She was administering his estates in 1187, but he had been given control of his own lands by 1190. He attested a number of her charters and accounted for relief for her lands in 1197. The elder Margaret brought to the Bohuns her family's claims to a royal constableship and to the earldom of Hereford. The office of constable had been granted to her son, Humphrey (III) de Bohun by 1174 and was inherited by Henry de Bohun, who styled himself &#145;Henry the constable&#146; in a number of his early charters. Despite his youth he occasionally attested charters of Richard I and was one of the king's sureties in negotiations with the count of Flanders in 1197. He married Maud or Matilda (<i>d</i>. 1236), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9626/', "Geoffrey fitz Peter, earl of Essex")</script>, and sister and heir of William de Mandeville, earl of Essex. Charters issued to Llanthony Priory by Henry, as earl of Hereford, indicate that their son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2775/', "Humphrey (IV) de Bohun")</script>, was born after 28 April 1199.<br>
<br>King John created Bohun earl of Hereford by charter on 28 April 1200, explicitly prohibiting him, with Bohun's acquiescence, from making any claims by virtue of a charter issued by Henry II to his ancestor Roger, earl of Hereford. His grandmother's determination was a factor in this process of restitution, but his political significance also owed much to the fact that his mother was a granddaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7208/', "David I, king of Scots")</script>, and that, in 1199, the king of Scots was his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29452/', "William the Lion")</script>. Between 1204 and 1211 he was engaged in a long dispute to establish his claim to part of his mother's dowry lands, the estates and twenty fees of the lordship of Ryhall, Rutland. Relations between King John and Earl Henry deteriorated in 1212 when William (I) Longesp&eacute;e, earl of Salisbury, laid claim to Bohun's honour of Trowbridge. The king assumed control of the honour, but allowed Earl William's agents to levy scutage from its tenants. In protest Bohun joined the rebels against the king, and was one of the twenty-five barons appointed to ensure that <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> was observed [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93691', "Enforcers of Magna Carta")</script>]. His lands were seized by the crown in June 1215, and he secured the restoration of his honour, although not of Trowbridge Castle, later in the year.<br>
<br>On John's death Earl Henry remained loyal to Louis of France, and was taken prisoner at the battle of Lincoln on 20 May 1217. He made peace with the new government, attending the court of the young Henry III, receiving the third penny of Herefordshire, and accounting for scutage. He died on pilgrimage to the Holy Land on 1 June 1220; the transfer to his son, Humphrey, of his responsibilities and eventually his lands was in hand before Michaelmas 1221. His widow married Roger of Dauntsey, of Dauntsey, Wiltshire, between 1221 and 1226, and in 1227 succeeded to the earldom of Essex, which was eventually also inherited by her son Humphrey.<br>
