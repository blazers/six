<span class="headword">Offord,  Andrew</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1305, <em>d.</em> in or before 1358), <span class="occ">diplomat</span>, was the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20571/', "John Offord (c.1290&#150;1349)")</script>. The family may have come from Offord in Huntingdonshire. He was educated at Oxford, being styled <i>magister</i> by 1325, and DCL in 1340. His legal acumen was recognized by Bishop Hempnall, who appointed him joint vicar-general, and later chancellor, in the diocese of Worcester. A career clerk, Offord was supported by income from benefices which included, successively, canonries of Salisbury, St Paul's in London, and York. The king granted him the subdeanery of York in 1348, but this was revoked a year later, when he received dispensation to hold the provostship of Wells, together with the archdeaconry of Middlesex, a canonry of Beverley, and the benefice of Over in the Ely diocese.<br>
<br>With his brother's promotion to be chancellor of England in 1345, Offord became a chancery clerk. In the following year he was appointed a member of the king's council. He had already embarked on a diplomatic career with a commission on 20 May 1343 to treat with the French ambassadors before Pope Clement VI. Abroad for most of June, he returned with a virulent letter from the pope denouncing royal councillors for infringement of ecclesiastical liberties, an allusion to Edward III's attempts to inhibit papal provisions, particularly of aliens, to English benefices. Returning to the curia, with his brother John, he reported in November to the council on the unsuccessful negotiations with France, before being reappointed as an envoy in April 1344. On 1 July 1345 Offord was made a member of the regency council of Lionel of Antwerp, the king's second son, while Edward III was in the Low Countries (3&#150;26 July). During that year he was also engaged on a further mission to the curia in Avignon, and on another to the north, then plagued by Scottish raids. Later that year, and in the spring of 1346, he was in Spain as proctor of Joan of the Tower, for her marriage contract with Pedro, the infante of Castile. He was subsequently in Flanders for consultation with two cardinals sent by the pope to negotiate between the English and French kings, and attended Edward III during his visit to France in 1346&#150;7.<br>
<br>In March 1348 Offord was one of those appointed to accompany Joan of the Tower on her journey to Castile, while between 23 March and 17 April 1349 he was negotiating with the French at Calais. He was there again in May, but returned to England in time to be present at the death of his brother, the chancellor, at Tottenham Court, on 20 May 1349. The next day he delivered the great seal to the king at Woodstock. Between August 1349 and the early months of 1353 Offord was mainly abroad treating with French and Spanish envoys, with the count of Flanders, and with the duke of Bavaria. On 4 August 1353 he was appointed one of three keepers of the great seal and in the parliaments of 1354&#150;5 was a trier of petitions. Further embassies to France followed, and by 18 November 1358 he had died at Avignon.<br>
