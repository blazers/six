<span class="headword">Kahane,  Jack</span>  (1887&#150;1939), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born on 20 July 1887 at 59 Bury New Road, Broughton, in Salford, near Manchester, the seventh of the eight children of Selig Kahane (<i>d</i>. 1893), a shipper, and his wife, Suzy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sufrin (<i>d</i>. 1896). Although registered as Jonas, he was always known as Jack. His parents were of Jewish origin and his forebears had prospered in the cotton trade. Both Kahane's father and mother died when he was young and he was brought up by an elder sister. He was educated at Manchester grammar school from 1900 to 1903, and then went to work in a cotton trader's office before setting up his own successful business. A tall, good-looking man, Kahane indulged a natural taste for the good life with fashionable clothes and frequent visits to London. The archetypal Edwardian dandy, he carried a cane and wore a monocle.<br>
<br>Kahane joined the army on the outbreak of the First World War and was gassed and wounded at the battle of Ypres. During his convalescence he met his future wife, Marcelle Eug&eacute;nie Girodias, whose father was a French civil engineer and whose mother was Spanish, and they were married in 1917. In 1919 their first son, Maurice, was born and over the next seven years three more children followed: Nicole, Sylvie, and Eric.<br>
<br>During a bout of tuberculosis Kahane wrote a light and slightly <i>risqu&eacute;</i> novel called <span class="italic">Laugh and Grow Rich</span> which was published in England, where it was banned by lending libraries. He sent a spirited letter defending the novel to a British newspaper, good and bad reviews followed, and the book sold well. Noting that spicy stories invoked censorship, which triggered protest, which produced sales, Kahane turned his attention to publishing.<br>
<br>In 1928 Kahane joined a French publisher as a junior partner and persuaded Sylvia Beach, owner of the bookshop Shakespeare and Company, who had recently published James Joyce's <span class="italic">Ulysses</span>, to allow his firm to publish a 5000 word fragment of Joyce's work in progress, <span class="italic">Haveth Childers everywhere</span>. In 1931 Kahane decided to set up his own publishing house, rented offices in the elegant place Vend&ocirc;me, and named his publishing house the Obelisk Press after the Egyptian obelisk in the centre of the nearby place de la Concorde.<br>
<br>Aware of both the pitfalls and the opportunities created by censorship in Britain, Ireland, and the United States, Kahane devised a double-sided publishing strategy. He would publish popular and sexually titillating novels to pay the bills but also actively search for serious authors who could not have their works published in their own countries. It was this simple formula that underpinned the Obelisk Press during its short life in the 1930s, as well as that of its successor, the Olympia Press, founded and run by Kahane's son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65590/', "Maurice Girodias")</script>, after the Second World War. Between them they published some of the landmark avant-garde novels of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>In 1933 Kahane launched the new venture with <span class="italic">The Young and the Evil</span> by Parker Tyler and Charles Henri Ford, an interracial homosexual novel set in New York; Radclyffe Hall's crusading lesbian novel, <span class="italic">The Well of Loneliness</span>; and Frank Harris's four-volume <span class="italic">My Life and Loves</span>, an exaggerated and bombastic account of his literary, political, and sexual adventures. Kahane's great coup, however, was to publish Henry Miller's <span class="italic">Tropic of Cancer</span> in 1934, followed by <span class="italic">Black Spring</span> (1936), <span class="italic">Max and the White Phagocytes</span> (1938), and <span class="italic">Tropic of Capricorn</span> (1939). Through Miller, Kahane met Lawrence Durrell and Ana&iuml;s Nin. He published Durrell's first serious novel, <span class="italic">The Black Book</span>, in 1938 and Nin's <span class="italic">Winter of Artifice</span> in 1939. He also put out Cyril Connolly's novel <span class="italic">The Rock Pool</span>, and wrote engagingly about his own life in <span class="italic">The Memoirs of a Booklegger</span>. Jack Kahane died in Paris of a heart attack on 2 September 1939. A fitting epitaph came from Henry Miller, recalling the birth pangs of <span class="italic">Tropic of Cancer</span>. &#145;It was something of a miracle&#146;, he said, &#145;that I found in Paris the one publisher &hellip; courageous enough to sponsor such a book: Jack Kahane and the Obelisk Press&#146;  (E. de Grazia, <span class="italic">Girls Lean Back Everywhere: the Law of Obscenity and the Assault on Genius</span>, 1992, 367).<br>
