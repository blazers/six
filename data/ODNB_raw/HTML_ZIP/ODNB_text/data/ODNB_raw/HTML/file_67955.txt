<span class="headword">Bressan,  Peter</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Pierre Jaillard]</span>  (1663&#150;1731), <span class="occ">musical instrument maker</span>, was born Pierre Jaillard in Bourg-en-Bresse, France, on 27 May 1663, the son of Claude Jaillard (<i>d</i>. 1667), carrier, and his wife, Philibert (<i>d</i>. 1694), daughter of Louis Mercier, joiner. Bressan probably received his early education at the Jesuit-run college in Bourg. On 13 May 1678 he was apprenticed to Jean Boysser, master turner of Bourg, for two years. He then probably undertook some (further) training in woodwind instrument making as well as performing in Paris from one of the Hotteterres. Jaillard settled in England about 1688. His name doubtless proving awkward for English tongues, he began calling himself Peter Bressan, signifying &#145;from Bresse&#146;. He was one of five oboists who went to Holland with William III in April 1691, but did not join the royal musical establishment.<br>
<br>About 1702 Bressan lodged with Claude Mignon, a French apothecary, in Duchy House, Duchy Lane, Somerset House Yard, London, part of the estate of the duchy of Lancaster, whose red rose (in stylized form) became part of Bressan's maker's mark. The house was situated by Somerset watergate stairs, a main thoroughfare from the Thames. Upon Mignon's death (1714) Bressan took over his lease. About 1703 Bressan married Mignon's daughter Mary Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1738), a sponsor of exhibitions, and he lived happily with her until his change of fortune, when he experienced domestic strife. According to several witnesses in the suit he filed against her in 1721&#150;4, she had a tempestuous disposition, threatening his life, concealing money, and incurring large debts. She confessed to marrying him &#145;only because he was in a way of getting a great deal of money&#146;  (Byrne, &#145;More on Bressan&#146;, 105). Witnesses described Bressan as industrious, sober, and good-tempered. He became a denizen on 12 September 1723. Yet in 1730 he left his wife and fled to Tournai in Flanders, where he died on 21 April 1731, probably at the house of the celebrated woodwind player Fran&ccedil;ois la Riche. Bressan's death abroad, his debts, and his marital difficulties complicated the settlement of his will.<br>
<br>James Talbot chose to give measurements for five instruments by Bressan&#151;flute, treble, and tenor oboe, and tenor and bass recorder&#151;showing that Bressan's reputation for woodwind instrument making had already been established. In 1721 he testified that he had acquired fame and fortune &#145;in making of musicall instruments and particularly of flutes [recorders]&#146;  (Byrne, &#145;More on Bressan&#146;, 102), but since 1715 his trade had fallen off sharply. His great success with the gentleman amateur market for almost thirty years presumably accounts for the survival of no fewer than forty-eight of his recorders&#151;far more than from any other early maker. They are prized among modern players for their mellow, vibrant, and slightly &#145;edgy&#146; timbre and flexible playing technique; some fifty modern makers have produced copies of one or more sizes. Three of Bressan's flutes have also survived, unfortunately not in their original condition, but no oboes or bassoons.<br>
