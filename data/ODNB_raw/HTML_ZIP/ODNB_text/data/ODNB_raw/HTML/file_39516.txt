<span class="headword">Stewart,  William Clouston</span>  (1832&#150;1872), <span class="occ">tea merchant and writer on fishing</span>, was born on 3 June 1832 at Smith's Place, Leith, Edinburgh, the third of four children of William Stewart (1798&#150;1873), a tea merchant originally from Orkney, and his first wife, Jean (1795&#150;1841), daughter of the Revd William Clouston of Sandwick, Orkney, and his wife, Isabella. When he was a youth the family moved to Dundee, and, following the death of his mother of &#145;debility&#146; in October 1841, his father remarried in 1843 and returned to Edinburgh in 1848. The anomaly of the nine-year-old William C. Stewart not being resident at Seafield Lane, Dundee, for the 1841 census is notable since it is from that age he dates his angling career. The knowledge and experience distilled within the pages of <span class="italic">The Practical Angler</span> strongly suggest he spent his youth and adolescence in Edinburgh and its southern hinterland.<br>
<br>By the time Stewart was sixteen his father had left the Dundee wine and spirit trade to become a wholesale tea merchant in Edinburgh, which was to be the lifelong profession of his angling son. The debilitating fever William suffered at the age of twenty certainly affected his constitution, and it may have harmed his career in the tea merchanting business, but it patently did not dampen his enthusiasm for angling, because his authoritative and seminal text&#151;<span class="italic">The Practical Angler, or, The Art of Trout Fishing, More Particularly Applied to Clear Water</span>&#151;appeared in March 1857 when he was a mere twenty-four years old. Republished on at least twenty-one occasions (the most recent being 1994) the unexpected success of the book wrought no great changes to its author's lifestyle. He did become secretary of the Edinburgh Angling Club in 1863, he contributed a chapter to H. Cholmondeley-Pennell's anthology <span class="italic">Fishing Gossip</span> (1866), and he left an almost completed companion volume on salmon angling. But Stewart throughout lived and worked in Edinburgh (notwithstanding an 1861 holiday in England).<br>
<br>A distinctively tall and thin man, affectionately known as &#145;the Long 'Un&#146; (and the king of anglers), Stewart's character is variously attested to by those that knew him or met him, such as Francis Francis, as being rather unlike the serious figure portrayed in the three known photographs. He was said to have a joyous, cordial manner, and to be a practised conversationalist who had a keen relish for a joke, with a natural aptitude for indoor games of skill or calculation. The modesty with which he apparently bore his angling and literary talent could not, however, prevent him from conducting a vituperative public correspondence with his erstwhile editor, Cholmondeley-Pennell, on the faults of the latter's <span class="italic">The Modern Practical Angler</span>, as detailed in Stewart's last publication <span class="italic">A Caution to Anglers</span> (1871). Recommended reading by no less an angling literature authority than Arthur Ransome, this booklet demonstrates in full measure the acerbity and wit that characterized Stewart's writings.<br>
<br>Yet less than a year after this vigorous defence of his angling tenets Stewart succumbed to a week-long attack of confluent smallpox and died unmarried at his home, 5 Alva Street, Edinburgh, on 17 January 1872, aged only thirty-nine. In Dean cemetery, where he was laid to rest two days later by his father, the fine red granite monument simply bears his name, his epitaph being proclaimed by the lasting worth and relevance to trout anglers everywhere of his book <span class="italic">The Practical Angler</span>.<br>
