<span class="headword">Mackie,  James</span>  (1864&#150;1943), <span class="occ">manufacturer of textile machinery</span>, was born on 6 October 1864 at Belfast, the eldest of the four children of James Mackie (<i>d</i>. 1887), a manufacturer of linen machinery, and his wife, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Millar). His father was Scottish, his mother Irish. James senior had come to Ireland from Forfar in 1845 to install a steam engine in a linen mill in Drogheda. His work impressed the foreman, James Scrimgeour, and when the latter established a foundry and engineering works in Belfast, Mackie became manager. Later Scrimgeour offered him a partnership, which he declined, deciding simply to invest money in the business; so when the firm went bankrupt in 1858 Mackie was not liable for its debts. Although he lost money, he managed to purchase the company's Albert Street premises and some of its equipment and began repairing machinery. With the cotton famine of the 1860s there was an increase in linen production and a consequent rise in demand for new machines and for the servicing of existing stock. Thus when the younger James was born his father's business was expanding. However, when the boom ended in the 1870s, the firm survived only by rigid economies.<br>
<br>James Mackie received only an elementary education, at Belfast model school on the Falls Road. He entered the business in 1874, and continued his education at Queen Street Mechanics' Institute (later to become Belfast College of Technology). The firm remained small, specializing in mill machinery renovations and accepting contracts for dismantling and re-erecting textile plants. In 1884 James became a junior partner in the business and, when his father died in 1887, he succeeded in partnership with his younger brother Thomas (1870&#150;1956). Shortly afterwards James married Elizabeth Pringle (<i>d</i>. 1940); they had five sons and a daughter. In the business, Thomas supervised the production side, while James was responsible for sales. He travelled widely in central and eastern Europe gaining orders and in 1895 established contacts in Russia. Increasingly the Mackies moved from repair work towards the manufacture of a wide range of linen machinery. In 1893 the company acquired a site on Belfast's Springfield Road, which, although greatly enlarged after 1919, remained its location until 1992. The business expanded steadily, producing wet-spinning frames and flax-preparing machinery. In 1897 Mackies became a limited company and in 1902 it took over Clonard foundry, bringing in John Horner, the previous owner, to the board. Together Mackies and Horner developed a revolutionary hackling machine, embodying a differential drive and grouping of metal pins to comb the flax.<br>
<br>In the pre-war boom the company expanded rapidly. In 1907 it was one of the first firms in the city to electrify and in 1911, together with Sir Otto Jaffe, linen merchant and former lord mayor of Belfast, diversified by acquiring McTears' spinning works in east Belfast. Later, as the Strand Spinning Company, this became wholly owned by Mackies. At this time the firm employed around 350 men. After 1914 the company went over to making munitions; its labour force rose to 650 and its premises were extended. From 1920 the linen industry declined and the business looked to other markets. It experimented in producing jute machinery, building a mill on its Springfield site to test the products; this also provided additional income as the resulting yarn was exported. By 1929 jute equipment was Mackies' most important product.<br>
<br>The business was highly export-orientated; by the end of the 1930s its overseas staff totalled 110 in a workforce of 2000, and covered 52 countries. This complex operation was headed by James Mackie. The firm became one of the world's leading suppliers of sisal and hard-fibre spinning machinery, and were pioneers in developing a complete range of products for processing jute. It was among the first to adopt package arrangements for establishing factories overseas, taking responsibility for planning, supplying, and installing equipment, and starting up production.<br>
<br>After 1939 the firm moved again into munitions, such as armour-piercing shells, hand grenades, and aircraft parts. In certain specialized projectiles, nine per cent of national requirements came from Mackies. The firm expanded dramatically. By 1944 the labour force, hitherto almost exclusively male, had increased to 12,000, 7200 of them women; another 8000 worked in associated Mackie organizations. That year the company's nominal capital was still &pound;156,000, a figure bearing no relation to the firm's true value.<br>
<br>Throughout its development Mackies remained a private family controlled company. James continued as managing director until his death, although by 1939 Thomas Mackie (appointed CBE in 1942) was primarily responsible for the day-to-day running of the firm. Mackies' success was based on both technical awareness, prudent finance, and the reinvestment of profits. The brothers lived frugally (their sons, for example, received further education at Belfast Technical College rather than at university). The company's finances also benefited greatly from the two wars. After 1945 the business continued to prosper, with markets in both eastern and western Europe moving from jute towards machinery for wool and man-made fibres.<br>
<br>James Mackie had many outside business interests, particularly through directorships in the linen industry, in firms such as the Ulster Spinning Company and the Rosebank Weaving Company. His public offices were few: deputy lieutenant for Belfast, JP for co. Antrim, and for six years a member of Belfast Harbour Board. He died at a nursing home, The Retreat, Armagh, on 12 April 1943, and was buried at Belfast city cemetery on the 14th. He was succeeded as managing director by his brother Thomas, and by his sons James and John.<br>
