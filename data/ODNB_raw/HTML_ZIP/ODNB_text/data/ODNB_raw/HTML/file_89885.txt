<span class="headword">Getty, Sir  (John) Paul</span>  (1932&#150;2003), <span class="occ">philanthropist and book collector</span>, was born on 7 September 1932, aboard ship off Genoa, the third son of John Paul Getty (1892&#150;1976), oil tycoon, and his fourth wife, Ann, daughter of Sam Rork, the Hollywood producer of such stars as Clara Bow. He was baptized Eugene Paul but much later dropped the Eugene; he was always known as Paul. The Getty family, of Irish origin, came to riches through George Franklin Getty, a Minneapolis oil prospector and a fervent Methodist. He had little time for his son, John Paul (Paul's father), who had to make his own ruthless way to the top of the oil business, buying up piecemeal in the 1920s and 1930s Tidewater Oil, the foundation of his own company, Getty Oil. In the 1950s little known outside business circles except as a collector of works of art, he was revealed in glaring publicity as the richest man in the world&#151;a short-lived moment of glory that did not make life easy for the children who scarcely knew him. Young Paul, after his parents' brief marriage had failed, was brought up by his mother and his Getty grandmother in California and sent to school with the Jesuits at St Francis Xavier High School, a lucky circumstance that gave him the anchor of faith that held firm through the dark depressions that he suffered. He went on to San Francisco State University to study English and between wild adventures, for he was drawn to excess, built on the grounding in literature that the Jesuits had given him. Soon after he was drafted to Korea for a spell of military service, and an introduction to the pleasures of the orient.<br>
<br>Getty had seen little of his father up to this time, but was now initiated into the family business, first as pump attendant on the forecourt, and within two years as the head of Getty Oil Italia with offices in Rome and a brief to exercise his natural talents for diplomacy in the Middle East. The company he directed was a loss-making arm of the parent company, but the wonders of Rome delighted him&#151;both the Rome of antiquity and the dolce vita circles in which he was immediately at home. In 1956 he married Gail Harris, daughter of Judge George Harris of San Francisco. They had two sons and two daughters, but the raptures of Roman life were too distracting for the marriage to survive and he found the oil business uncongenial and unfulfilling.<br>
<br>A troubled romantic, Getty sought relief in drink and drugs, and solace in books and music and the films of the golden age of Hollywood. In London he met Talitha Pol, daughter of Willem Pol, a Dutchman who had survived incarceration with his wife (who had not) and his daughter in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp and later married Poppet, daughter of Augustus John. Getty and Talitha Pol were married in 1966 and had one son. They bought Rossetti's house in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, and a palace in Marrakesh where they gathered a diverse group of friends from Mick Jagger to Gore Vidal, picnicking by mountain streams, supping with Moorish grandees, but equally amused by snake charmers and scallywags from the Djem al-Fna. Heroin took over and Talitha died of an overdose in Rome in 1971. A sorrowing Paul withdrew to Chelsea.<br>
<br>Always bookish, Getty now began to accumulate a library, sharpening his tastes and knowledge through dialogue with dealers, chiefly Bryan Maggs of the eponymous firm. It was especially the book as object that sparked him, with the arts of the binder an enduring passion. He bought bravely and boldly, the death of his father in 1976 and the freeing of family trusts making him the rich man outsiders had wrongly imagined him to be. Nicolas Barker, in a tribute in <span class="italic">The Bookman</span> in 2003, wrote that &#145;the collection is to be measured by comparison with the great collections of the past&#151;as great as any made in the last century&#146;. It was rich in the finest copies of the most beautifully produced texts, the work of the greatest printers and binders, as well as a noble group of illuminated manuscripts, and books that spoke of history, like William Morris's copy of <span class="italic">Das Kapital</span>, bound by Cobden Sanderson, or the astonishing albums of drawings of the church treasures of Italy by John Talman, bound for Josiah Wedgwood. When he really wanted something he was fearless, paying &pound;4 million for the Caxton Chaucer and &pound;3&frac12; million for the Shakespeare first folio from Oriel College, Oxford.<br>
<br>It was as much to house his books as himself that in 1984 Getty bought the estate of Wormsley, hidden in the Chilterns, where he built a library of knapped flint, its hammer-beamed roof decorated with the conjunction of the planets at the hour of his birth. There too he created a cricket pitch and hosted wonderful gatherings to watch teams he selected play against club, county, and international adversaries. Cricket, to which he became addicted during lonely days of television at Cheyne Walk, was a passion that brought him new friendships and great happiness. He was president of Surrey County Cricket Club in 1996 and in 1993 became the proprietor of Wisden.<br>
<br>It is, however, as a philanthropist that Getty was most remarkable. His generosity both public and private was prodigious. He followed his own enthusiasms with gifts to the National Gallery (&pound;50 million), the British Film Institute (&pound;20 million), the Imperial War Museum (&pound;1 million), to build the Mound stand at Lord's Cricket Ground (&pound;2 million), to the SAS (&pound;1 million), to the cathedrals of Hereford (&pound;1 million), Ely (&pound;1 million), and St Paul's (&pound;5 million), the abbeys of Downside and Dorchester (&pound;500,000), to St James's, Spanish Place (&pound;500,000), the Bar Convent in York&#151;and to the Conservative Party (&pound;5 million). Other beneficiaries of his generosity included the National Gallery of Scotland and the Victoria and Albert Museum, for Canova's <span class="italic">Three Graces</span> (&pound;1 million), the Historic Royal Palaces (&pound;4.5 million), the National Trust, for Tyntesfield (&pound;1 million), Denville Hall, for retired actors (&pound;1 million), and the SS <i>Great Britain</i> (&pound;2 million). He supported his local churches, both Catholic and Anglican, and, through the J. Paul Getty Jnr General Charitable Trust, which he endowed with &pound;25 million, many projects in Britain covered by its rubric of &#145;unpopular causes&#146;, helping the indigent, the addicted, the afflicted&#151;both small, self-help endeavours and courageous efforts on a larger scale to elevate the human spirit. Many individuals too had their troubles and anxieties eased by his discreet and timely intervention. His gifts to the country were marked by his appointment as an honorary KBE in 1986, and in 1998 he became a British citizen. In 1994 he married as his third wife his long-time companion Victoria Holdsworth, daughter of Commander Gerard Holdsworth, a hero of the Special Operations Executive. By his own remarkable efforts and with her strong support, he returned to a far fuller life: at Wormsley, in his rooms looking over St James's Park, in his box at Lord's, and on his yacht, <i>Talitha G</i>, this modest, witty, devout man entertained his friends and neighbours, and gathered his far-flung family about him. After years of declining health, he died in the London Clinic, 20 Devonshire Place, Westminster, of renal failure on 17 April 2003; he was buried in a wooded glade above the house at Wormsley. He was survived by his wife, Victoria, and the five children of his earlier marriages. He left an estate valued for probate purposes at just over &pound;200 million.<br>
