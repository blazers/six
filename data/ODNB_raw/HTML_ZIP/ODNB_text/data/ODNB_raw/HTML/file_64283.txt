<span class="headword">Adams,  Roger</span>  (1681?&#150;1741), <span class="occ">printer and publisher</span>, is thought to have been born at Chester, and may have served an apprenticeship to a member of the Chester Company of Painters, Glaziers, Embroiderers and Stationers, although there is no entry of his name in the minute books of that company. He did, however, become a freeman of the city of Chester, by purchase, on 20 February 1714. It is possible that he may have worked for Edward Ince, who was the first commercial printer in Chester from 1710 until 1718, but this has not been verified. Adams married Elizabeth Buckley (<i>d</i>. 1771/2), daughter of John Buckley, apothecary of Chester, at St Oswald's Church, Chester, on 28 May 1713. They had at least eight children of whom four are known to have reached adulthood: John (<i>bap</i>. 1714, <i>d</i>. 1757), William (<i>bap</i>. 1719, <i>d</i>. after 1741), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70359/', "Orion Adams (1717?&#150;1797)")</script>, and Dorothy (1717?&#150;1757?), his twin sister.<br>
<br>Adams had his first printing office in Manchester, &#145;At the lower end of Smithy Door&#146; (near the collegiate church). Two books are known to have come from his Manchester press in 1716 and 1719. It was from this address that he also printed and published the <span class="italic">Manchester News-Letter</span>, later renamed the <span class="italic">Manchester Weekly Journal</span>, from December 1718 or January 1719.<br>
<br>The paper sold at 1<i>d</i>.; only thirty-five copies are known to survive, and these cover only twenty-nine issues. The largest number of these, twenty-three copies, are in the library of All Souls College, Oxford, and are for the five-month period from 6 August 1724 to 31 December 1724. The date of its demise was probably 1728, the year in which Roger Adams may have set up presses in Shrewsbury and Eastgate Street, Chester. One work (undated but assigned to 1728), <span class="italic">Tair o Gerddi Newyddion</span> (&#145;Three new ballads&#146;), has the imprint &#145;Argraphwyd gan Roger Adams &hellip; Mwythig&#146; (&#145;Printed by Roger Adams, Shrewsbury&#146;), while Thomas Badeslade's <span class="italic">Some Short and Plain Considerations</span> (also <i>c</i>.1728) bears the imprint &#145;Chester: Printed by Roger Adams in Eastgate Street&#146;.<br>
<br>Adams also published a newspaper, the <span class="italic">Weekly Courant</span>, in Chester, although this was not the town's first paper. William Cooke, Chester's second commercial printer, had issued his <span class="italic">Chester Weekly Journal</span> from 1721 until 1733. This was briefly replaced by the <span class="italic">Industrious Bee</span> in 1733 and then by the <span class="italic">Chester Weekly Tatler</span> in the following year. If Roger Adams did move from Manchester to Chester in 1728, then he did so in competition with the established printer, William Cooke. However, Cooke may have been in financial difficulties about this time, as he was made to pay &pound;25 by the Stationers' Company in 1727 (for his admittance) and in 1734 he was fined &pound;10 for having sold an unstamped newspaper. From the numbering on surviving copies of Adams's <span class="italic">Courant</span>, it would appear to have been started in November 1732, although it has been claimed to date from 1730. The earliest known copy, number 51, is for Wednesday 7 to Wednesday 14 November 1733, and bears the imprint: &#145;<span class="smallcap">CHERTER</span> [<i>sic</i>]: Printed by Roger Adams, Where Advertisements are taken In. Where any Person may have any small Parcels carried by the News-Men, thro' the Nine Counties they Travel, with great Care and Diligence&#146;. Adams's first dated book was Peter Nourse's <span class="italic">Athrawiaeth yr eglwys</span> (&#145;Doctrine of the church&#146;) (Chester, 1731), although several undated, but datable, books survive from about 1724. One of these, <span class="italic">A Sermon Preach'd at St. Hilary's Chapel Denbigh, in 1728</span> (1730), carries the address in the imprint as &#145;Roger Adams in Fleshmonger Lane&#146;. Another work, <span class="italic">A Catalogue of the Lords, Knights and Gentlemen who Compounded for their Estates</span> (1733), uses the same typefaces as were employed by William Cooke, thus suggesting that, about 1732&#150;3, Adams had taken over the printing office which had been used for the <span class="italic">Chester Weekly Journal</span>.<br>
<br>The last known book to come from Roger Adams's press was <span class="italic">The Raree Show, or, The Foxtrapt</span> (1740). The precise date of his death is unknown; according to the parish register of St John's, Chester, he was buried on 14 November 1741. Following his death the <span class="italic">Courant</span> and the general printing business were taken over by his widow, Elizabeth, and his son John. Roger's will was proved at Chester in 1748. His son Orion had his own printing business and in July 1750 returned to Manchester where, in 1752, he resumed publication of <span class="italic">Adams' Weekly Journal</span> from the same address as that at which his father had printed the original <span class="italic">Weekly Journal</span>. Orion's twin sister, Dorothy, married William Monk, who had been her father's apprentice, and their son, John Monk, took over the running of the printing and publishing business in January 1772 following the death of Elizabeth Adams. The newspaper, under the title of <span class="italic">Chester Courant</span>, continued to be published weekly until its final issue dated 7 September 1982.<br>
