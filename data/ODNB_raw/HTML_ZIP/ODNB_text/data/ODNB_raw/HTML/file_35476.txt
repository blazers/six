<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Perkin,  Arthur George</span>  (1861&#150;1937), <span class="occ">organic chemist</span>, was born on 13 December 1861 at Sudbury, Middlesex, the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35477/', "Sir William Henry Perkin (1838&#150;1907)")</script>, manufacturing chemist, and his first wife, Jemima Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1862), youngest daughter of John Lissett. His elder brother, also <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35478/', "William Henry Perkin (1860&#150;1929)")</script>, became the leading British organic chemist of his generation, ending his career as Waynflete professor of chemistry, University of Oxford. Arthur's delicate health did not prevent his being sent in the late 1860s to a boarding-school at Margate. In 1872 he joined his brother at the City of London School, chosen by their father, himself an old boy, for its good science teaching. During the holidays the boys, who were dedicated to chemical research, experimented in a hut fitted as a laboratory in the garden of their home. They were also excellent musicians: Arthur played the flute in the nine-strong family orchestra.<br>
<br>In 1878 Perkin entered the Royal College of Chemistry, London, where he studied under Edward Frankland and Frederick Guthrie. Having spent the year 1880&#150;81 working under E. J. Mills at Anderson's College, Glasgow, he won a Clothworkers' Company scholarship tenable in the newly opened colour chemistry and dyeing department of the Yorkshire College of Science, Leeds (later Leeds University), where he researched with J. J. Hummell from whom he derived a lifelong interest in natural dyes.<br>
<br>In 1882 Perkin became chemist and in 1888 manager at the alizarin works of Hardman and Holden in Manchester. In 1887 he married Annie Florence, daughter of James E. Bedford of Leeds; he had met her through an acquaintance with her brother, Charles Bedford, a fellow researcher at Leeds. Indeed, the centrality of Leeds in Perkin's life was confirmed in 1892 when he returned there as a lecturer and research assistant (retitled to research chemist in 1907) in the colour chemistry and dyeing department of Yorkshire College. Aided by a light teaching load and the Clothworkers' Research Laboratory, opened in 1900, he enjoyed twenty-two years of intense research and incessant publication on the structure and properties of natural dyes. Though he mainly left it to others to confirm by synthesis his postulated structures, he was so skilful in exploiting degradative methods that he was elected a fellow of the royal societies of Edinburgh (1893) and London (1903) and attracted research students from abroad, especially from India and Japan.<br>
<br>In 1916 Perkin succeeded A. G. Green as professor of colour chemistry and dyeing at Leeds. He contributed to the chemists' war by researching for the Ministry of Munitions and leading the Leeds colony of British Dyes' research chemists. With A. E. Everest he published in 1918 a classic text, <span class="italic">The Natural Organic Colouring Matters</span>; he received the accolade of the Royal Society's Davy medal in 1924, and retired officially in 1926 but continued to research in his department until February 1937 when he was taken ill. He died at home, Grosvenor Lodge, Grosvenor Road, Headingley, Leeds, on 30 May 1937 and was buried at Adel, Leeds, on 2 June 1937. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Both Perkin and his brother had childless marriages; both earned the nickname &#145;Pa Perkin&#146; from their students, and, again like his brother, Perkin was a dab hand at the research bench where he thrived on noxious vapours. He maintained his interest in music, as first bassoon in amateur orchestras in Yorkshire. Unlike his brother, he was neither a discipline builder nor an activist in national scientific affairs. Gentle and unambitious, he was happy to spend thirty-four years at Leeds (which conferred an honorary DSc on him in 1927), enjoying research in his laboratory, where he chain-smoked, summer holidays always taken in the Isle of Man, and his domestic pets.<br>
