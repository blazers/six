<span class="headword">Dreyer,  Rosalie</span>  (1895&#150;1987), <span class="occ">nurse</span>, was born on 3 September 1895 in Bern, Switzerland, the eldest child in the family of four daughters and one son of Johann Dreyer, manager of a dairy co-operative, and his wife, Elisabeth Neuenschwander. Her father's work necessitated travel in the Lausanne area, and the two eldest daughters of this Lutheran family received their education from Roman Catholic nuns. The young Rosa was encouraged to travel by a cosmopolitan aunt. She went to England in 1914 as an au pair girl to the Saltzburgers, a Swiss family settled there; for many years afterwards she kept links with her young charges.<br>
<br>In May 1918 Rosalie Dreyer began to train as a nurse at Guy's Hospital, London. Despite a bout of glandular fever, she gained her state registration certificate in March 1922, excelling in practical nursing and sick-room cookery. After a year's private nursing she went back to Switzerland to work in the Rollier Clinic, a tuberculosis sanatorium in Leysin, canton Vaud.<br>
<br>In 1924 Rosalie Dreyer returned to the staff of Guy's. She gained her midwifery qualification in 1926 and rose through the nursing hierarchy to become assistant matron in 1931. In 1934 she secured the post of matron at the Bethnal Green Hospital, which since the 1929 <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span> was under the control of the London county council (LCC). The next fifteen years of her career were spent in the service of the LCC, as principal matron (1935&#150;40), principal matron in charge (1940&#150;48), and chief nursing officer (1948&#150;50). The move to the LCC was to a world vastly different from Guy's and the voluntary sector. The LCC nursing service had been built up from over 120 different institutions, employing approximately 8000 female nursing staff. It offered a comprehensive training, uniformity of conditions of employment, and probably the most integrated service in existence prior to the inception of the National Health Service. In the course of her work Rosalie Dreyer frequently met Herbert Morrison, leader of the LCC from 1934 to 1940. She was well aware of her uniquely powerful position, seeing herself as a policy maker and using her opportunities to promote nursing and to professionalize the former workhouse infirmary staff. Younger women at London matrons' meetings and her own ward sisters were in awe of her. Her charm and sense of humour were also much appreciated.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Rosalie Dreyer's organizational abilities were fully utilized. She had to deal with the immense challenges presented by the urgent need to evacuate and disperse hospitals into the surrounding countryside. Personnel and equipment had to be relocated and both had eventually to return together. Her memos give eloquent testimony to her managerial skills as patients (many of them chronically sick), staff, student nurses, their teachers, equipment, anatomical charts, and life-sized manikins were moved about London and the home counties in what was logistically the most difficult task to face a nurse manager so far in the twentieth century. With a car and a driver at her disposal, she visited bombed and evacuated hospitals to assess the extent of the damage and the morale of her staff. Her opinion was esteemed by her LCC colleagues, for she had an acute grasp of the realities of the situation. In negotiations with the Ministry of Health on the production of a nursing recruitment film to be shown in cinemas, she stressed the need for the filming to be undertaken in a hospital where the uniform was up to date and visually appealing to potential new nurses.<br>
<br>Rosalie Dreyer had become a British citizen in 1934, shortly before her appointment to Bethnal Green Hospital. Her wartime experience was marred by the xenophobic agitation of Ethel Bedford Fenwick, who described her appointment as matron-in-chief as unpatriotic. Rosalie Dreyer received messages of support from the Royal College of Nursing and was publicly defended by the LCC leader, Charles Latham. After the war she supervised the assimilation of the LCC nursing service into separate new National Health Service units which had their own hospital management committees. She became chief nursing officer, in charge of domiciliary nursing services, but she disliked this work, which was in no way comparable with her previous post, and in 1950 she moved to the World Health Organization (WHO) as nursing adviser, touring the war-torn countries of Europe and advising on nursing reconstruction, until her retirement in 1953. Despite her significant contribution to the health provision for Londoners, she received no civic or public honours.<br>
<br>Rosalie Dreyer was a life member of the Royal College of Nursing, president of one of its London branches (South East Metropolitan), and a member of the Royal College of Nursing committee on the assistant nurse, chaired by the first Baron Horder. She believed in the formal recognition of the second-level nurse, and was chosen as first president of the National Association of State Enrolled Nurses. Within the National Health Service she served on three hospital management committees (South West Middlesex from 1950 to 1958, Stepney from 1952 to 1964, and Lewisham from 1955 to 1964) and was a governor and honorary secretary to the friends of the Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital on the Whitley Council.<br>
<br>Rosalie Dreyer was birdlike, tall, and slim (until she worked for the WHO), with dark hair which she complained was squashed by nurses' caps. While at Guy's she was an avid theatregoer, with a wide circle of friends. She regarded her nurses as her family. Her retirement was an active one, sustained by her love of sewing, cooking, and travelling. She travelled to Australia in her sixties, partly by mail boat. She kept up her lifelong links with nursing friends such as Dame Elizabeth Cockayne. During her last illness she was nursed by one of her sisters and district nurses, some of whom knew her background. She died, unmarried, at her flat, 5 Kingsthorpe Court, Raymond Road, Wimbledon, London, on 21 May 1987 from the effects of a cerebral tumour.<br>
