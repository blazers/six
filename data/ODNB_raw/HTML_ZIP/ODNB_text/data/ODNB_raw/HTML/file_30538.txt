<span class="headword">Baines,  Frederick Ebenezer</span>  (1832&#150;1911), <span class="occ">promoter of telegraphy</span>, was born on 10 November 1832 and baptized at Chipping Barnet, Hertfordshire, on 19 January 1834. He was the younger son of Edward May Baines, surgeon, of Hendon and Chipping Barnet and his wife, Fanny.<br>
<br>Educated at private schools, Baines early showed interest in practical applications of electricity, and, helped by his uncle Edward Cowper, and an elder brother, G. L. Baines, mastered, when fourteen, the principles of telegraphy, constructing and manipulating telegraphic apparatus. Two years later, through the influence of Frederick Hill, an uncle by marriage, and Rowland Hill, he was put in charge of a small public telegraph office belonging to the Electric Telegraph Company, and situated within the post office at St Martin's-le-Grand, London, where he remained for three years.<br>
<br>In April 1855 Rowland Hill recommended Baines for the post of clerk in the correspondence branch of the General Post Office. After a few months Baines's knowledge of railways earned him a transfer to the home mails branch. His leisure was devoted to schemes for extending the telegraph network through submarine cables. He planned to avoid the necessity for lines to cross hostile lands. He devised one cable route to the Canary Islands and the West Indies, another crossing the south Atlantic and rounding the Cape of Good Hope to Australia. In a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> (14 September 1858) he further advocated the connection of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts by a line across Canada. His most important scheme, which he drew up in 1856, was for the government acquisition of existing telegraph systems. This was not the first such proposal, but it was the first to detail practical methods of organizing the transfer, and to list the expected benefits, supported by reliable figures. The government's permission to proceed came only in November 1867, and control of existing telegraph systems was transferred to the Post Office on 5 February 1870. Baines's knowledge of telegraphy was helpful in bringing the new public service into operation, including all the main features of his original scheme&#151;free delivery within a mile, the creation of a legal monopoly, and a uniform sixpenny rate, irrespective of distance.<br>
<br>In 1875 Baines was made surveyor-general for telegraph business, and in 1878, with a view to decreasing the danger of invasion and increasing the efficiency of the coastguard service, he proposed the establishment of telegraphic communication around the coast of the British Isles, to be worked by the coastguard under the control and supervision of the Post Office. The proposal, renewed in 1881, and again in 1888, was adopted by the government in 1892.<br>
<br>In 1882 Baines was made inspector-general of mails, and assistant secretary in the Post Office under Sir Arthur Blackwood. He organized the parcel post service, introduced by Fawcett in 1883, and before leaving the Post Office had extended the service to the British colonies and most European countries. Different views and systems of postal administration on the continent made his task difficult. He became CB in 1885, and married, in 1887, Laura, eldest daughter of Walter Baily, barrister, of Hampstead. He retired through ill health on 1 August 1893.<br>
<br>Baines lived for the greater part of his life at 1 Wentworth Mansions, South End Road, Hampstead, where he took an active interest in parochial work. He assisted in the acquisition of Parliament Hill Fields for the public use, was a member of the Hampstead select vestry, and in 1890 edited <span class="italic">Records of Hampstead</span>. He was also an enthusiastic volunteer, serving as both a non-commissioned and a commissioned officer. His latter years he devoted to literature. His main work, <span class="italic">Forty Years at the Post-Office</span> (2 vols., 1895), reminiscences written in an agreeable style, contains valuable details of reforms at the Post Office both before and during Baines's connection with it. He also published <span class="italic">On the Track of the Mail Coach</span> (1896), and contributed an article on the Post Office to J. Samuelson's <span class="italic">The Civilisation of our Day</span> (1896).<br>
<br>Baines died on 4 July 1911 at his home in Hampstead, and was cremated at Golders Green. He was survived by his wife.<br>
