<span class="headword">Cok <span class="st"> [Coke]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1393&#150;<em>c.</em>1468), <span class="occ">Augustinian canon and compiler of the cartulary of St Bartholomew's Hospital, London</span>, came of unknown parentage. Autobiographical interjections in his writings provide most information on his life and work, the main source being the cartulary, in which he states that it was &#145;Compiled and written by brother John Cok &hellip; at Easter 1456 or 36 Henry VI [1457&#150;8] &hellip; in the 37th year of the profession of John Cok aged 64&#146;  (cartulary, fol. 7<i>r</i>). Cok's reckonings are inconsistent but suggest he was born about 1393. The register of Richard Clifford, bishop of London (<i>d</i>. 1421), records that John Cok became a subdeacon at St Bartholomew's Hospital on 8 March, and a deacon on 22 March 1421. His earliest reminiscence is inserted in an entry in the cartulary concerning property in Wood Street, London: &#145;&hellip; inhabited by Thomas Lamporte, goldsmith, in whose tenement and in whose time I John Cok &hellip; was apprenticed there&#146;  (ibid., fol. 25<i>r</i>). He refers to his presence at the coronation of Henry V in 1413 on &#145;a very rainy day&#146;  (ibid., fol. 647<i>v</i>); and another marginal note adds &#145;Written by John Cok in the two years before his profession who was serving with Master Robert Newton [master of the hospital 1413&#150;15] <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 1418&#146;  (ibid., fol. 382<i>r</i>). Cok's life in the hospital was contemporaneous with John Wakeryng, who was master from 1423 to 1466 and under whom Cok was for some time the renter.<br>
<br>Entries in the cartulary draw attention to their effective estate management. Cok's association with other transcribers of books in the secular world is indicated by the request in the will of Sir John Shirley (<i>d</i>. 1456), translator and transcriber of Chaucer: &#145;To my which wife Margrete Shirley &hellip; I beseche &hellip; Sir John Wakering &hellip; Sir John Cok, prest and his brother professed, &hellip; will vouchsafe to assist, comfort and counsell all ways and times &hellip;&#146;  (London, Guildhall Library, MS 9171/5, fol. 213). There is no evidence in the London bishops' registers to confirm the description of Cok as a priest. Other compositions by Cok included an account of the works of John Wakeryng, two volumes of copies of theological tracts, and &#145;the fairest bible that I have seen, written in large vellam by a brother named John Coke at the age of sixty-eight&#146;  (Stow, 1.232). The whereabouts of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and Wakeryng's biography are unknown but the treatises survive. In one volume  (BL, Add. MS 10392) Cok used several styles of script, coloured initials and rubrics, and drew eight hands annotated with the names of virtues and vices. The second volume  (Cambridge, Gonville and Caius College, MS 669*/646) is annotated on four pages with &#145;q.J Cok&#146; or &#145;qd John Cok&#146; as well as the cipher &#145;Qd ix and iii&#146; on page 209. Ciphers interested Cok; Trinity College, Cambridge, holds an early fifteenth-century Flemish-made book of hours  (MS B.11.14) containing on its flyleaf a Pentecostal hymn written in cipher, signed &#145;quod Johnes Cok&#146;, and a table of numbers in his handwriting. It has been suggested that the illuminated initial on folio 94<i>r</i> of the cartulary of St Bartholomew's Hospital was drawn by Cok himself, but it is now considered probable that it was the work of the limner William Abel (<i>d</i>. 1474). A further suggestion that the unidentified arms beneath the cross in this illustration belonged to Cok does not seem capable of proof. Several times Cok makes reference in the cartulary to his encroaching old age and unsteady hand. The note to which he attached the latest personal date reads &#145;Written by brother John Cok in the evening of his life <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 1468&#146;  (Cartulary, fol. 73<i>v</i>), and from this it is assumed that he died shortly afterwards. He would have been about seventy-five.<br>
