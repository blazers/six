<span class="headword">Carrie,  Isabella Scrimgeour</span>  (1878&#150;1981), <span class="occ">suffragette and schoolteacher</span>, was born on 3 May 1878 at 26 Wardmill Road in the parish of St Vigeans, Arbroath, the daughter of Richard Carrie (<i>c</i>.1836&#150;1912), bleachfield worker, and his wife, Ann Robertson Harris (<i>c</i>.1842&#150;1903). Isabella was one of only three children who survived beyond infancy and the only one to survive into adulthood.<br>
<br>Carrie spent her early years in Arbroath, where she attended Inverbrothock public school and then Arbroath high school. She left school at fourteen to become a pupil teacher at the Abbey School. The pupil-teacher system was common in Scotland at this time, especially for women, providing a four-year apprenticeship of teaching by day and studying at night. She then sat an examination for a queen's scholarship which enabled her to study further at the Church of Scotland Training College in Edinburgh, one of three such denominational teacher training colleges. She recalled being unimpressed by the college because the lecturers were &#145;old and dull and I got nothing new or interesting&#146;  (&#145;Memories&#146;, fol. 9). She also noted that the men and women students were allowed to meet only once a year.<br>
<br>Once qualified Carrie worked in the mining village of Kelty, Fife, and then was an infant teacher at Parkhouse, Arbroath, from 1904 until 1908. Unfortunately she began to suffer ill health caused by the ventilation system in Parkhouse; this prompted a brief move to another school and then on to Wallacetown School, Dundee, in September 1908. She later became infant mistress at Tay Street School in the early 1930s. Throughout her teaching career she witnessed the impact of poor social conditions on her pupils and her main priority was to ease their poverty, which she did through many quiet voluntary and philanthropic actions.<br>
<br>Within the story of the &#145;votes for women&#146; campaign, Isabella Carrie can be said to represent the countless unknown women campaigners who never received recognition, and she is probably typical of many who were recruited to the cause because of their sense of outrage and indignation at the treatment of women. She always had an interest in politics. Her father had been an ardent tory, and she sometimes attended local political meetings. One of her earliest recollections was of seeing William Ewart Gladstone when he visited Forfar. Carrie's interest in women's issues may well have been sparked off by teasing from her brother. He used to tell her that &#145;lassies dinna hae brains&#146; but, she recalled, she had &#145;a feeling that my brain was as good as his&#146;  (interview, 14 Nov 1976). This conviction had a major impact on her outlook and subsequent involvement in the women's movement in Dundee.<br>
<br>Carrie's arrival in Dundee in 1908 coincided with the rise of the suffrage movement in the city, which was a particular target of both suffragists and militant suffragettes: earlier in the year Winston Churchill had won the Dundee by-election and he did not support women's suffrage. Carrie liked to hear good women speakers and often attended public meetings. The significant moment for her was when she was given a ticket to hear Churchill speak at a ladies' meeting in the Gilfillan Hall, Dundee, about 1913. She was incensed at the rough tactics of the stewards towards some women and even more so at Churchill's attitude to women, so much so that she stood up and protested. She too was evicted rather roughly from the hall. Her actions caught the attention of the leaders of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), who thought it had been a planned interruption. Carrie was asked to join the WSPU but was not prepared to be militant, and she kept in the background, introducing speakers and helping in the library and office.<br>
<br>Although Isabella Carrie was never a leading figure, her role in the local WSPU was none the less significant. Despite her aversion to militancy she took on a task which was fraught with danger and surrounded by secrecy. By this time, living on her own after the death of her father in 1912, she began to give hospitality to visiting activists in the WSPU. Her quiet, respectable neighbourhood and her regular stream of visitors were a good cover for her secret visitors. She never knew the identity of those who stayed, rarely spoke to them, and never questioned them or gave information away. The need for secrecy remained with her until her nineties, when she still would not reveal the names of the WSPU leaders in Dundee.<br>
<br>On one notable occasion in 1914 Carrie was asked if she would shelter Mrs Pankhurst, a request which she viewed as both an honour and a risk. She agreed and decided she would stay up late to speak to her, but unfortunately Mrs Pankhurst was arrested in Glasgow. Like many women campaigners Carrie continued her interest in women's issues after the First World War; she was a founding member of the Women Citizens' Association in Dundee and of the Scrimgeour Clan Society founded in the early 1970s.<br>
<br>Carrie's retirement in 1938 was prompted by the fear that she would not live long because of ill health. She decided to spend her annuity on a year-long trip around the world. However, she was in New York in 1939 when war broke out, and returned home. She thought about going back into teaching but decided to continue her voluntary work, including giving hospitality to evacuees. In old age she remained a great letter-writer, and she maintained a lively interest in others and also wrote down her memories. She had a much longer life than she had anticipated, and died, unmarried, aged 103 on 29 November 1981 at the Duneaves Eventide Nursing Home, Broughty Ferry, Scotland. The policeman who caught her as she was thrown out of the Churchill meeting claimed she was the gentlest suffragette he had ever seen&#151;a suitable epitaph.<br>
