<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wright,  (James) Whitaker</span>  (1846&#150;1904), <span class="occ">speculator</span>, was born in Foregate Street, Stafford, on 9 February 1846, the eldest son in the family of at least four sons and one daughter of James Wright (1815/16&#150;1870), a Methodist New Connexion minister, and his wife, Matilda, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whitaker (<i>b</i>. 1815/16). A short period of his childhood was spent in Alnwick, Northumberland, and he was said to have spoken with a Northumbrian burr. Aged fifteen he was a printer in Ripon, Yorkshire, where his father was minister. At the age of twenty-one he went to the United States as an assayer, and in the late 1870s participated in the mining boom at Leadville in Colorado before acquiring a mine in New Mexico. Several speculative fortunes were made and lost by him at this time. He next moved east, becoming chairman of the Philadelphia mining exchange and a member of the New York stock exchange. On 10 May 1878 he married, in Philadelphia, Anna Edith Weightman (<i>b</i>. 1861/2), with whom he had a son and two daughters. The failure of the Gunnison Iron and Coal Company exposed him to heavy losses, and he returned to England in 1889.<br>
<br>In the 1890s Wright's fortunes recovered when he established himself as a company promoter specializing in overseas mining ventures. The times were propitious for a man of his experience. He could talk plausibly of mining camps, and understood the vulnerabilities of the speculative investor. He weighed 16 stone, with a massive head and neck, and his solidity inspired confidence. During 1896 he floated Lake View Consols with capital of &pound;250,000, and formed other companies to exploit mines in Western Australia. In 1897 he consolidated his interests in a new combination called the London and Globe Finance Corporation with himself as managing director and the marquess of Dufferin and Ava as chairman. This corporation's promotion work was very profitable: typically, it acquired the Ivanhoe mine at Kalgoorlie from a small colonial company capitalized at &pound;50,000 and refloated it in London with capital of &pound;1 million. In 1897 Wright launched the British America Corporation with capital of &pound;1.5 million to acquire mining interests in British Columbia and the Yukon. This company and London and Globe became jointly interested in floating mining companies, rigging the markets in their shares, and juggling their finances.<br>
<br>Wright bought for &pound;250,000 the estate of Lea Park near Godalming in Surrey. He installed an observatory, a theatre, a velodrome, a private hospital, and stabling for fifty horses. With a touch of megalomania he constantly devised new effects in architecture and landscaping: hills which obstructed views were levelled, and armies of labourers employed in lake-building. He was fond of billiards, which he played in a saloon constructed of glass beneath the wide sheets of water in his grounds. The drawing-room of his sumptuous London house in Park Lane was a replica of the Cabinet des Rois of Louis XV. He kept a yawl at Cowes with the suggestive name of <i>Sybarita</i>. &#145;Everything was swagger,&#146; according to <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>, &#145;the whole thing was a gorgeous vulgarity&#151;a magnificent burlesque of business.&#146;<br>
<br>There were many danger signals: the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway, which was one of London and Globe's promotions, consumed &pound;600,000; but speculators in their cupidity were convinced that they could get clear before the inevitable collapse. During 1899 London and Globe made large profits as Lake View shares rose from &pound;9 to &pound;28 following the discovery of a rich patch of ore. When a reaction set in, based on the knowledge that this rich find was exhausted, Wright determined to support the share price. The results were disastrous, and on 28 December 1900 London and Globe announced its insolvency. This disaster bankrupted members of the stock exchange, liquidated many of London and Globe's allied companies, and ruined countless numbers of Wright's infatuated dupes. The subsequent investigations of the official receiver disclosed that Wright's empire had rested on fraudulent accounts and balance sheets concealing deficits. Dividends paid by London and Globe had not been earned, but were provided by money pillaged from Wright's other companies.<br>
<br>Although there was strong political pressure for Wright's prosecution, it was at the instigation of a creditor that in March 1903 a warrant was issued for his arrest. He had sailed four days earlier for New York, where he was arrested. After resisting extradition for some months by every legal artifice, he returned to England in August. At his trial, beginning on 11 January 1904, prosecuting counsel showed that capital of &pound;5 million had been lost in two years, not a penny of which had reached his shareholders, while additional debts of about &pound;3 million had been accumulated. On 26 January 1904 he was convicted on all counts, and sentenced to the maximum of seven years' penal servitude. Immediately after sentence at the central law courts in London, he went to a consulting room with his solicitor, Sir George Lewis, to whom he handed his watch saying, &#145;I will not need this where I am going&#146;  (<span class="italic">DLB</span>). He then swallowed cyanide and died within a few minutes. He was buried with pomp in Witley churchyard, near Godalming, on 30 January 1904.<br>
<br>Wright was survived by his wife and their three children. He was the basis of Mr Ponderevo in the novel <span class="italic">Tono-Bungay</span> by H. G. Wells (1909).<br>
