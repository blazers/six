<span class="headword">Fitton, Sir  Edward</span>  (1548/9&#150;1606), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9521/', "Sir Edward Fitton (1527&#150;1579)")</script> of Gawsworth, Cheshire, and his wife Anne Warburton (1527&#150;1574) of Arley, Cheshire. Born into one of the most prominent gentry families in Cheshire, he was the eldest surviving son in a family of nine sons and six daughters. He was educated at Brasenose College, Oxford, graduating BA on 6 April 1566, and he subsequently studied at Gray's Inn. He married Alice (<i>d</i>. 1626), daughter and sole heir of Sir John Holcroft of Holcroft, Lancashire; they had two sons, Edward and Richard, and two daughters, Anne [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52768/', "Newdigate, Anne")</script>] and Mary. Their eldest son and heir, Edward, was born on 3 December 1572. Their younger daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9523/', "Mary Fitton")</script>, baptized in 1578, became a maid of honour to Queen Elizabeth in 1595.<br>
<br>During the 1570s Fitton was an active participant in his father's administrative career as vice-treasurer and treasurer-at-wars in Ireland and was occasionally employed to transport money into Ireland. From his Gawsworth home he kept in contact with Lord Burghley concerning Irish affairs. On his father's death in July 1579 it was reported that Fitton, then aged thirty, expected to inherit the office and he was adamant &#145;that none shall mixe with my father's reckoning but my self&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/67, no. 55). He was appointed receiver-general for Ireland in that year in succession to Edward Waterhouse. On 11 October 1579 he was knighted at Dublin Castle by the newly appointed lord justice, Sir William Pelham, and on the following day was issued with a passport to return to England with his company and his goods. His father's accounts were still a subject of debate in the Dublin administration well into the 1580s.<br>
<br>Under the terms of his father's will Sir Edward inherited his father's entire estate on condition that he pay any outstanding debts, support his sisters until they married, and provide dowries for them when their marriages were arranged, and provide for the education of two of his younger brothers, William and Francis. Besides the principal family estate at Gawsworth he also inherited his father's interest in the manors of Aldford, Echeles, and Alderley in Cheshire; he entered on his Gawsworth lands on 25 April 1583. He served as a JP in Cheshire until his death, as his father and grandfather had done, and through the influence of powerful friends he served as MP for Wigan in 1572, and for Boroughbridge in 1589.<br>
<br>In the mid-1580s Fitton became involved in Ireland again, this time as a key promoter of the plantation scheme for the forfeited lands of the earl of Desmond in Munster. He actively recruited gentlemen from Cheshire to become involved as principal settlers in Munster, and on 3 September 1587 he and Thomas Fleetwood became the first undertakers to receive patents in the Munster plantation. He received lands totalling 11,515 acres, principally in the seigneury of Knockainy in co. Limerick, and also at Aherlow in co. Tipperary and Kilmanahan in co. Waterford. The acquisition of the Kilmanahan lands, at the expense of Richard Power, demonstrated the importance of Sir Edward's well-established contacts with influential office-holders. He was also actively involved with Sir Valentine Browne in discovering &#145;concealed&#146; Munster lands, and campaigned to ensure that such lands were included in the patents issued to undertakers.<br>
<br>The Cheshire settlers recruited for the Munster plantation scheme by Fitton acted as a group in the early years. Two of his own brothers, Richard and Alexander, were also undertakers in the scheme. Sir Edward continued to travel frequently between Ireland and England, cultivating his contacts at court while simultaneously working to secure title to his lands in Ireland. He repaired and inhabited the former Desmond castle of Knockainy, which had been destroyed during the Desmond rebellion. He invested in agricultural improvement, advocating a transition to tillage farming, and importing English bulls onto his Limerick lands. He raised a company of twenty-five horsemen in England and brought them to Munster. However, by the end of 1588 Sir Edward had become disillusioned with the Munster project and claimed to have lost &pound;1500 on his investment. Like other undertakers, he had failed to meet the conditions of his patent; like other English Elizabethan gentlemen in Ireland he had hoped to serve his own interests as well as those of the monarch, but found service in Ireland financially unrewarding, despite enjoying the support of Lord Burghley. He returned to live more or less permanently at Gawsworth and petitioned Lord Burghley for remission of rent on his land in Ireland. His brother Alexander, however, was still in residence in Munster in 1598 and acted as his agent. The Munster rising of 1598 resulted in most of the settlers being dispossessed, and in December 1598 Edmund Fitzgibbon (the white knight) attacked Sir Edward's household in Kilmanahan. Earlier that year Sir Edward had been nominated by Burghley for the post of treasurer of Ireland, following the death of Sir Henry Wallop, but was not appointed.<br>
<br>Fitton died on 4 March 1606 and was buried on 3 April in Gawsworth church, where his widow erected a monument to his memory depicting parents and four children kneeling. In accordance with the terms of his will, his son and heir, Edward, sold the Fittons' Irish lands to pay off family debts. The Limerick lands were bought by Donough O'Brien, fourth earl of Thomond, and some local Old English landowners. Sir Edward's will also made provision for his two daughters but none for his younger son, Richard. His widow died on 5 February 1626.<br>
