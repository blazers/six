<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pole,  Michael  de la</span>, second earl of Suffolk  (1367/8&#150;1415), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22452/', "Michael de la Pole, first earl of Suffolk (d. 1389)")</script>, and his wife, Katherine, daughter of Sir John Wingfield.<h2>
<a name="Forfeiturerestorationandroyalservice"></a>Forfeiture, restoration, and royal service</h2>De la Pole's father, chancellor of England from March 1383 to October 1386 and one of Richard II's closest advisers, was impeached by the Lords and Commons in October 1386 as a result of his perceived responsibility for the failures of royal policy at home and abroad. He fled into exile following the appeal of treason against him in the Merciless Parliament and the title of earl of Suffolk, together with the de la Pole family estates, were consequently forfeited to the crown, though the younger Michael and his wife were granted three east midlands manors, extended at &pound;100 p.a., for their maintenance. De la Pole's principal occupation over the next decade lay in seeking to reverse, through repeated petitions to the king and council, the effects of this judgment. Following his father's death abroad he successfully obtained piecemeal possession of the entailed family estates between 1389 and 1392 but his closeness to the former appellants, in particular Thomas Beauchamp, earl of Warwick, his wife's uncle, and Thomas of Woodstock, duke of Gloucester, with whom he undertook to crusade in Lithuania in 1391, did not recommend his cause to the king. It was not until January 1398, five years after the earldom of Oxford had been restored to the de Veres, that de la Pole regained his own family's comital title and, even then, some of the former de la Pole possessions, such as the reversion of Costessey, Suffolk, continued to elude him.<br>
<br>The new earl's conduct during the political crisis of 1399 was as equivocal as that of most of the rest of the English aristocracy. Suffolk obeyed the summons of Edmund, duke of York, to defend the kingdom in July 1399, bringing with him a force of 29 men-at-arms and 109 archers, but raised no objection to the subsequent disbanding of York's army and consented to the deposition and perpetual imprisonment of King Richard. Suffolk's reward was not long in coming. Although Henry IV's first parliament annulled all the acts of the Shrewsbury parliament and confirmed all those of the Merciless Parliament, with the result that the de la Pole estates and titles were once again technically forfeit to the crown, they were at once restored to de la Pole &#145;in consideration of his services after the King's advent&#146;  (<span class="italic">RotP</span>, 3.668). His tenacious quest for full restoration of his father's estates nevertheless continued to occupy him until his death.<br>
<br>The restored earl of Suffolk did not play a prominent part in the government of the early Lancastrian kings. Though a relatively assiduous attender at great councils and parliaments&#151;where he acted as a trier of Gascon petitions in 1404, 1411, 1413, and 1414&#151;de la Pole was never nominated as a royal councillor, never witnessed a royal charter, nor held an office of state. His record of military and diplomatic service was a little more substantial, though his son's later claim that Suffolk had served Henry IV &#145;in all the viages in his daies both by See and Lande, that were made out of this lande&#146;  (<span class="italic">RotP</span>, 5.176) appears a little exaggerated. He campaigned with the king in Scotland in 1400, jointly supplying (with the earl of Westmorland) a large force of 200 men-at-arms and 1000 archers, and undertook in the same year to supply a ship with 20 men-at-arms and 40 archers for the defence of the channel. Later he participated in naval operations himself, most probably those against Sluys and Cadsand commanded by Thomas of Lancaster, in May 1405, and went abroad on the king's service between December 1408 and August 1409, acting as the senior English representative at the Council of Pisa, though he appears to have played no substantive part in proceedings. He acted as one of the principal captains to Thomas, duke of Clarence, on his campaign through France to Gascony in 1412&#150;13.<h2>
<a name="Reestablishmentofregionalpower"></a>Re-establishment of regional power</h2>It was at the regional, rather than the national, level that Suffolk was most active and successful. Although he did not neglect the family's Yorkshire lands, completing the endowment of the Carthusian house in Hull and the Maisondieu at Myton-on-Humber founded by his father, his principal achievement lay in the revival and consolidation of de la Pole influence in East Anglia. A justice of the peace in both Norfolk and Suffolk from 1399 until his death, and a frequent commissioner of array in Suffolk, the earl used the resources of his estates in the region and his mother's Wingfield connections to good advantage, building up a following among the local gentry, such as Sir Roger Drury, Sir William Bardwell, and the youthful John Fastolf, and marrying several children into neighbouring noble families. At Wingfield, Suffolk, the centre of de la Pole influence in the region, he completed his father's ambitious building plans, augmenting the endowment of the family chantry college and considerably enlarging the church of Wingfield itself. By such means he reinvigorated the tradition of unemphatic but effective local lordship associated with the last Ufford earl of Suffolk and earned his own reputation as &#145;a knight of excellent and most gracious name&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gesta Henrici quinti</span>, 50). By his studied respectability he successfully removed from his family's reputation the taint of scandal that had hitherto hung about it.<h2>
<a name="SacrificesinFranceandsuccessiontotheearldom"></a>Sacrifices in France and succession to the earldom</h2>Suffolk served in Henry V's expedition to France in 1415, bringing with him a force of 40 men-at-arms and 120 mounted archers, and died of dysentery on 17 September during the siege of Harfleur. His body was shipped home to England and buried, as he had requested in his will, at Wingfield, Suffolk. De la Pole had married Katherine, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26206/', "Hugh Stafford, second earl of Stafford")</script>, in April 1383. The couple had possibly twelve children, of whom five sons and five daughters survived infancy. Two of his daughters were married into the East Anglian nobility: Isabel, who took with her a dowry of 800 marks, to Thomas, Lord Morley, and Elizabeth to Edward, son and heir of Hugh, Lord Burnell; a third daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54452/', "Katherine de la Pole")</script>, became abbess of Barking. Of his sons, <a href="#cosubject_22454">Michael [<i>see below</i>]</a> was third earl and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22461/', "William de la Pole (1396&#150;1450)")</script>, who had been placed in the household of his uncle, Edmund Stafford, bishop of Exeter, succeeded him to become fourth earl and first duke of Suffolk. De la Pole's third son, Alexander, was killed at the battle of Jargeau in June 1429, and his fourth, John, died in French captivity soon after the same battle; his youngest son, Thomas, a clerk, died in 1433 while a hostage with the French for his elder brother, completing a toll of war-related fatalities almost unrivalled among the English aristocracy. <a name="cosubject_22454"></a><span class="headword">Michael  de la Pole</span>, third earl of Suffolk  (<em>c.</em>1395&#150;1415), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, served with his father in France in 1415 with a company of 20 men-at-arms and 60 archers. He was one of the few notable English fatalities at the battle of Agincourt and was mourned by the English chroniclers: &#145;as strong, as active and as daring as any member of the court&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gesta Henrici quinti</span>, 51). He had married, before 24 November 1403, Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas (I) Mowbray, duke of Norfolk, with whom he had three daughters, Katherine (<i>b</i>. 1410), Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1411), and Isabel (<i>b</i>. 1415).<br>
