<span class="headword">Denison, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1699&#150;1765), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was one of at least two sons of Joseph Denison, a merchant of Leeds. His elder brother William resided at Ossington Hall, Nottinghamshire, and was the grandfather of John Evelyn Denison (1800&#150;1873), speaker of the House of Commons. However, the records of the Inner Temple state that Thomas was admitted in February 1719 as the son and heir apparent of Joseph Denison, gentleman. He had been educated at Leeds grammar school. From the Inner Temple, Denison migrated in 1721 to Gray's Inn, and thence in 1727 to Lincoln's Inn where he was called to the bar in 1733. These facts suggest a difficulty in gaining a foothold in the law, and it may be that he practised for some years below the bar. Nevertheless, by 1740 he was the leader of the king's bench bar, in terms of the number of causes which he handled there, and, in 1742, within ten years of call, he was appointed one of the justices of that court. According to his epitaph, allegedly written by Lord Mansfield, he had been &#145;pressed, and at last prevailed upon&#146;, to accept this office, and &#145;discharged the important trust of that high office with unsuspected integrity, and uncommon ability&#146;, steadily adhering to &#145;a religious application of the inflexible rule of law to all questions concerning the power of the crown, and privileges of the subject&#146;  (Foss, <span class="italic">Judges</span>). He married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1785), daughter of Robert Smithson.<br>
<br>Denison was knighted in 1745, on the occasion of the presentation by the judges of their loyal address after the Jacobite rising, and remained in office until 14 February 1765, when he resigned on grounds of ill health. He died on 8 September 1765, and was buried in Harewood church, Yorkshire, near the tomb of Chief Justice Gascoigne. His monument is surmounted by a bust in judicial robes, and there is a painting in robes by Thomas Hudson which has been engraved in mezzotint. Denison left a useful series of judicial notebooks, which are now in the Harvard law school. Denison's wife, Anne, survived him by twenty years. As they had no children the estates passed to Anne's grandniece, who married Edmund, the fifth son of Sir John Beckett, baronet.<br>
