<span class="headword">Dennis,  John Henry Cawsey</span>  (1871&#150;1939), <span class="occ">engineer and motor vehicle manufacturer</span>, was born on 20 February 1871 at Huntshaw, near Torrington, Devon, the third son of William Henry Dennis, farmer, and his wife, Susanna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cawsey. After education at Taunton College, he followed his early interest in machinery and became apprenticed to a repairing ironmonger in Bideford, against his parents' wishes. He then secretly took up a post as an ironmonger's assistant in Guildford in 1894, and as a sideline he began to build and sell bicycles. For a short time he gained further experience with Brown Brothers, the well-known component factors, in London.<br>
<br>In early 1895 John Dennis returned to Guildford and opened his own shop, the Universal Athletic Stores, in the High Street. Here he sold cycles mainly of his own manufacture, with parts supplied by Brown Brothers. Like his contemporary William Morris (1877&#150;1963), Dennis subsequently transferred his engineering skills from cycles to motor vehicles. Morris, however, went on to create a mass car-manufacturing concern, whereas Dennis chose to specialize in commercial vehicles.<br>
<br>Later in 1895 Dennis was joined by his younger brother, <a name="cosubject_46871"></a><span class="headword">Sir (Herbert) Raymond Dennis</span>  (1878&#150;1939), <span class="occ">motor vehicle manufacturer</span>. The fourth son, Raymond was born on 25 June 1878 at Huntshaw. Educated at Wellington School, Somerset, his initial contribution to their joint venture included his success as a competitive cyclist. In 1898 production of the brothers' first motorized vehicle, a tricycle with a De Dion engine, was added to that of their Speed King and Speed Queen bicycles. Quadricycles followed, and in 1901 cycle production gave way to the manufacture of motor vehicles, initially cars. John Dennis married Dora Annie, daughter of Stephen Baker, in 1903. There was one son of the marriage. Following Dora's death in 1934, he subsequently married her sister, Julia Elizabeth. In 1922 Raymond married Sybil Margaret, daughter of Sir Leonard Llewelyn, a government minister in charge of non-ferrous metals in the First World War. They had four sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>The first commercial vehicle from the Dennis works, a van for Harrods (followed by repeat orders), was delivered in 1904. A range of commercial vehicles was then built up; fire engines were added in 1908 (and remained a Dennis speciality). Car manufacture ceased in 1913, though not before inroads had been made into the taxi market, with such users as the General Motor Cab Company.<br>
<br>1913 had a double significance for Dennis Brothers, for in this year the private company of 1901, which had replaced the original partnership, with the two brothers alternating as chairman, was itself relaunched as a public company with an authorized capital of &pound;300,000. Dennis Brothers was by then a leading lorry manufacturer. By producing vehicles under the government's subvention scheme (whereby the purchasers of lorries which were accepted as suitable for subsequent military use would receive an annual subvention in peacetime), the company further strengthened its position as a significant producer of commercial vehicles. Orders from such major Post Office contractors and carriers as McNamara and Carter Paterson had helped to establish this position in the decade between the introduction of commercial vehicles and the First World War. This expansion of production and a larger product necessitated a move to Woodbridge Hill, Guildford, where the firm had room to grow.<br>
<br>John Dennis was a paternalistic employer; he established a non-contributory benevolent fund and developed extensive company housing, including 102 houses (Dennisville) built to accommodate the workforce associated with the White and Poppe engine company of Coventry, acquired in 1919 and transferred to Guildford in 1932. Lawnmower manufacture was introduced in the early 1920s as part of a diversification programme which included the production of industrial pumps (in addition to those for firefighting) and municipal vehicles. The latter proved commercially beneficial, as public expectations of local authority services grew and the physical growth of suburbia and housing estates created extra demand. Bus, coach, and ambulance designs, and new commercial vehicles, were developed in the 1920s and 1930s. It was the success of the bus, coach, and municipal vehicle ranges which provided momentum for the firm in the middle years of this period.<br>
<br>The partnership of the two brothers, who were actively involved in the firm as joint managing directors, combined John's engineering aptitude with Raymond's marketing skills. (Raymond Dennis was knighted in 1920 in recognition of the firm's wartime production effort.) Less well-known than the collaboration of the Rootes brothers, the lifelong working partnership of John and Raymond Dennis, which ended only with their deaths in the same year, is an equally impressive example of sibling co-operation in the development of a business. Alfred White and Peter Poppe provided the board with further engineering expertise when the White and Poppe engine firm was absorbed in 1919. Sir Raymond Dennis died at Gratham Grange, Gratham, Surrey, on 20 May 1939. The death of John Dennis occurred on 27 August 1939, at Down Place, Compton, Guildford, Surrey, only three months later; he was survived by his second wife. Both brothers enjoyed outdoor recreational pursuits, such as fishing. John Dennis served as a JP.<br>
