<span class="headword">Poor <span class="st"> [Pauper]</span>,  Herbert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1217), <span class="occ">bishop of Salisbury</span>, was almost certainly the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23515/', "Richard of Ilchester")</script>, bishop of Winchester (<i>d</i>. 1188). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22525/', "Richard Poor (d. 1237)")</script>, who succeeded him as bishop of Salisbury, was his younger brother. It is unlikely that he was connected with Roger Poor, son of Roger of Salisbury (<i>d</i>. 1139).<br>
<br>Herbert Poor was probably employed under his father in the exchequer, but the first mention of him is in 1167 as a canon of Lincoln Cathedral. He is most probably also to be identified with the Herbert who occurs as archdeacon of Northampton in 1174&#150;5. He was one of the three archdeacons of Canterbury appointed by Archbishop Richard (<i>d</i>. 1184) within the space of three months in 1175, one of whom, Savaric, was probably appointed before Herbert and soon exchanged the archdeaconry for that of Northampton, in which he succeeded Poor. After 1175 Poor occurs as sole archdeacon of Canterbury until his election as bishop of Salisbury in 1194. On 11 December 1183 Poor, in his capacity as archdeacon of Canterbury, enthroned Walter de Coutances (<i>d</i>. 1207) as bishop of Lincoln. In July 1184 he was one of the commissioners sent by Henry II to the monks of Christ Church, Canterbury, to warn them to prepare for the election of an archbishop. From 1185 to 1188 he had custody of the see of Salisbury and he was a canon of Salisbury and of Wells, as well as of Lincoln. In May 1186 the chapter of Lincoln elected him as their bishop, but Henry II refused his consent. A little later the majority of the canons of Salisbury, in their turn, chose Herbert Poor as bishop, and on 14 September 1186 the king gave his assent; but the minority appealed to the pope, on the ground that Poor was the son of a concubine, and the election came to naught. On 29 September 1186 Poor enthroned his successful rival, Hugh (<i>d</i>. 1200), as bishop of Lincoln. According to Roger of Howden, in May 1193 he appealed to the pope against the election of Hubert Walter (<i>d</i>. 1205) as archbishop, on the ground that the king was in captivity and the English bishops were not present at the election.<br>
<br>In 1194 the canons of Salisbury, having no dean, unanimously elected Herbert Poor as their bishop. The election was confirmed by Archbishop Hubert on 29 April. Herbert was at this time only in deacon's orders, but on 4 June he was ordained priest, and on 5 June was consecrated by Hubert in St Katherine's Chapel at Westminster. He was enthroned at Salisbury on 12 June. Between 1190 and 1197 Poor was occasionally one of the justices of the bench at Westminster. On 16 June 1196 he was at Rouen with Walter de Coutances. At the council of Oxford in December 1197, when Hubert Walter demanded in the king's name a force of 300 knights to serve for a year overseas, or the monetary equivalent, Herbert supported Hugh of Lincoln in his successful resistance to the demand. For his share on this occasion Poor was, by Richard's orders, deprived of his possessions and obliged in February 1198 to cross over to Normandy, where, on payment of a heavy fine, he was reconciled to the king. He returned to England on 8 June. A letter from Peter of Blois to Herbert consoling him on his afflictions apparently belongs to this period. Poor was present at the coronation of John on 27 May 1199, and was with the king in Normandy in September and October. He was there again with John in May and early June 1200, and attended Hubert Walter's provincial council at Westminster, which opened on 19 September. Possibly at about this time he was one of the papal delegates who sat at Westminster to effect a reconciliation between Archbishop Geoffrey and the chapter of York, and on 22 November was at Lincoln when the king of Scots did homage to John. On 14 December 1201 he was summoned to join the king in Normandy, but had returned to England by June 1202 when he ordained a vicarage for the church of Waltham (St Lawrence), Berkshire, by a charter whose witnesses appear to have been essentially the bishop's <i>familia</i>&#151;as well as four <i>magistri</i> and four chaplains, they included two stewards, a butler, a clerk, a cook, and a marshal.<br>
<br>Herbert Poor seems to have been on quite good terms with the king in 1204&#150;5, witnessing royal charters in England fairly frequently and receiving a gift of ten tuns of wine in January 1205. In 1208, although his lands were seized by the crown immediately after the interdict was proclaimed, the king ordered their restoration on 10 April, probably for a proffer of 500 marks. Poor appears to have remained in England until November 1209, when John's excommunication forced him into exile. Unlike most bishops, Herbert and Gilbert Glanville of Rochester (<i>d</i>. 1214) sought refuge in Scotland and, according to the Dunstable annals, stayed there with John's permission. It has accordingly been thought that both bishops may have accompanied John in his successful campaign against King William of Scotland in July 1209, and remained in the north until entering Scotland in November. In January 1209 the two bishops had been commissioned by the pope to supervise his order to John to restore Queen Berengaria's dower lands, and in May 1210, in the face of the king's delays, they were instructed to publish an interdict on these lands. In 1212 the papal legate Pandulf appointed them to release the Scots from their fealty and homage to John. There is no evidence that these instructions were carried out, and the fact that Herbert's temporalities, seized by the crown in 1210, were restored to his steward on 13 December 1212, seven months before the formal restitution to the bishop on 18 July 1213, suggests that Poor did not actively oppose John during the interdict. While in Scotland Poor lived at Kelso until his return to England in 1213.<br>
<br>After this there is no reference of importance to Poor. He died in 1217, probably on 7 January, the date when his obit was observed at Salisbury. He was buried at Wilton. Herbert is noteworthy in the history of the see of Salisbury for having formulated the plan of removing it from Old Sarum to a more suitable site two miles to the south. However, although he obtained the sanction of Richard I, he lacked the energy and confidence to implement his design, which was further delayed by the troubles of the next reign. It was eventually carried out by his brother and successor, Richard Poor.<br>
