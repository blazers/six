<span class="headword">Plaw,  John</span>  (1744/5&#150;1820), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was apprenticed at the age of thirteen to a member of the Tylers' and Bricklayers' Company in London. In 1763, when he was awarded a prize by the Society of Artists for a drawing of the Banqueting House in Whitehall, he was described as an &#145;architect and master builder in Westminster&#146;  (Society of Arts, <span class="italic">Register of Premiums</span>, 1763, 39). He joined the Incorporated Society of Artists a year after its foundation in 1766 and was president at the time of its dissolution in 1791. In 1774&#150;5 he designed his most important surviving house, Belle Isle, Westmorland, for Thomas English who, according to William Wordsworth, was the first man to settle in the Lake District &#145;for the sake of the beauty of the country&#146;  (W. J. B. Owen and J. B. Smyser, <span class="italic">Prose Works of William Wordsworth</span>, 3, 1974, 342). Picturesquely situated on the largest island in Lake Windermere, Belle Isle is a domed, circular villa with an Ionic portico and plain interiors, anticipating both in its form and in its neo-classical character the later and better-known Ickworth in Suffolk. A drawing of the house was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1775, when Plaw was living in Lambeth, near Westminster Bridge; by 1778 he had moved to King's Road, Parsons Green, Fulham, and he subsequently occupied premises in Charles Street, Westminster, and at Lothbury in the City of London before settling in Tottenham Court Road, where he was living about 1785&#150;8. By 1788 he had moved again, this time to Paddington.<br>
<br>Plaw's practice during the 1780s and 1790s was largely taken up with the design of villas and cottages, most of them near London or in the home counties; he also designed a house in South Third Street, Philadelphia, in 1786, and he prepared designs for several houses in Scotland, only one of which (Seacliff, East Lothian, <i>c</i>.1795) is known to have been built. Many of his executed and unexecuted designs were illustrated in the three publications on which his fame largely rests: <span class="italic">Rural Architecture</span> (1785), <span class="italic">Ferme orn&eacute;e, or, Rural Improvements</span> (1795), and <span class="italic">Sketches for Country Houses, Villas and Rural Dwellings</span> (1800); he also contributed an article on architecture to the first volume of <span class="italic">The New Encyclopedia</span> (1788). Aimed largely, as the title page of the <span class="italic">Sketches</span> puts it, at &#145;persons of moderate income&#146;, his books, with their attractive aquatint illustrations&#151;an innovation in English architectural publishing&#151;were among the first to exploit the growing taste for the picturesque, demonstrated in his frequent use of Gothic detailing. He also favoured the use of vernacular building materials such as thatch, tree trunks, and <i>pis&eacute;</i> or rammed earth; the latter was publicized for the first time in England in <span class="italic">Ferme orn&eacute;e</span>. The influence of his publications can be seen not only in the minuscule number of surviving houses that can be securely attributed to him, such as the veranda-ed New York Cottage near Faversham, Kent&#151;perhaps the first building in England to be directly inspired by a North American model&#151;but also in numerous farm buildings and in villas and <i>cottages orn&eacute;s</i> such as Houghton Lodge, Hampshire, which was in existence by 1799, and the Round House at Havering atte Bower, Essex (1793&#150;4). Plaw, unlike some of his more adventurous contemporaries, eschewed irregular planning in favour of what he called &#145;symmetry and correspondence of parts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sketches</span>, 3), and his talent for neo-classical design is well demonstrated in his most prominent surviving building, the church of St Mary, Paddington, built under an act of parliament in 1788&#150;91 to serve the inhabitants of what was then one of London's most rapidly growing suburbs, and planned in the form of a Greek cross.<br>
<br>Plaw moved from London to Southampton about 1795, taking up residence in a house called Spring Place in the hamlet of Hill, to the north-west of the town. He prepared designs for fashionable residential developments, including Albion Place, a group of houses to the north of the town wall which was never completed; he also designed a cavalry barracks (later incorporated into the headquarters of the Ordnance Survey) in 1806. In or about 1809, &#145;discouraged and disappointed in his art &hellip; which he loved and laboured to promote&#146;  (<span class="italic">Repository of Arts</span>, new ser., 14, 1822, 250&#150;51), he emigrated to Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, allegedly taking the charter of the Society of Artists with him. Here he built up a new practice, and it was here that he died, at the age of seventy-five, on 24 May 1820; his burial-place in Charlottetown was marked by a tombstone illustrated in the <span class="italic">Architectural Review</span> of 1919. Of his known children one son, John, served as his apprentice and was admitted to the Tylers' and Bricklayers' Company in 1787, and a daughter exhibited architectural drawings at the Society of Artists in 1791. His pupils included George Byfield and John Buonarotti Papworth.<br>
