<span class="headword">Katilungu,  Lawrence Chola</span>  (1914&#150;1961), <span class="occ">trade unionist and politician in Northern Rhodesia</span>, was born in the northern province of Northern Rhodesia in January 1914. A member of the royal clan of the Bemba people, he was the grandson of Chief Chipalo and was a kinsman of the Chitimukulu, the paramount chief of the Bemba. He was educated at Catholic mission schools, and was employed as a teacher before going to work in 1936 as an underground miner and &#145;boss boy&#146; (foreman) at the Nkana mine in the recently opened copperbelt. He took part in the African mineworkers' strike there in 1940 (which resulted in a heavy death toll) and worked for a while as a clerk in a fish business in the Belgian Congo before returning to Nkana in 1944 to work as a senior interpreter. He did not work particularly closely with William Comrie, the British trade unionist who was sent out to Northern Rhodesia by the Labour government to promote the establishment of African trade unions in 1947, but he was elected chairman of the Nkana mine union on its establishment the following year. Although he was clearly a talented individual, his election was attributed to his rarity value as a well-educated clerk from the Bemba-speaking northern province, the home of many mineworkers but of very few clerks. He played a major role in the setting-up of the African Mineworkers' Union (AMU), becoming its first general president in 1949. In 1950 he was elected first president of the Northern Rhodesia Trades Union Congress. Although he was an active member of the Northern Rhodesian African National Congress (ANC) from its foundation, he believed that it was desirable to keep unions and political parties separate, and undesirable to use strikes for political purposes.<br>
<br>There was no doubt about Katilungu's own opposition to the establishment of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland&#151;he travelled to London in 1952 and played a part, together with Harry Nkumbula, president of the ANC, Hastings Banda of Nyasaland, and others, in the unsuccessful campaign to stop it. But in the same year he lobbied against a strike in protest against the deportation of Simon Zukas, a radical white opponent of the federation and member of the supreme action council of the ANC. In the following year he ensured that the AMU did not support the call of Nkumbula and ANC for a two-day general strike against the federation. His failure to support the butchery boycotts launched by the ANC in 1954 was also the cause of lasting tension between the union and congress.<br>
<br>The first great achievement of the AMU was the successful organization of a month-long strike in October&#150;November 1952. This came as a surprise to the big mining companies, the Anglo-American Corporation and the Rhodesian Selection Trust, which had been making huge profits in the wake of the boom in copper prices consequent on the Korean War. The mining companies had offered only a derisory sixpence a shift in response to the union's demand for an increase of 2<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. a shift. When the matter went to arbitration the award was less than had been demanded but much more than the companies had offered. This was a great boost to the prestige of Katilungu and the union, and in the following year they also succeeded in securing the abolition of the unpopular system of worker representation by so-called &#145;tribal elders&#146;. A two-month strike for higher wages in 1955 achieved less significant gains, but was an impressive demonstration of the union's organization and the discipline of its 25,000 members. The government saw the &#145;rolling strikes&#146; of July&#150;August 1956 as political: the union's objectives included the removal of racially discriminatory working practices. The government declared a state of emergency and detained many of the union's leaders. Katilungu had not played much part in the organization of these strikes and was out of the country when the state of emergency was declared. He was not detained, but the union's organization was crippled by the removal of many of its most experienced officials, and it was further weakened by the collapse of copper prices, retrenchments, and the subsequent loss of members.<br>
<br>The government now saw Katilungu as a moderate leader with whom it could do business. More radical members of the union, and members of the ANC who broke away from Nkumbula to form the Zambia African National Congress (ZANC) late in 1958, under the leadership of Kenneth Kaunda, saw him as a conservative. Katilungu, who was influenced by Moral Re-Armament and had dabbled in liberal politics, supported Nkumbula and the ANC in their opposition to the Zambia African National Congress, which was banned in March 1959 but re-emerged as the United National Independence Party in 1960. Indeed, Katilungu welcomed the governor's banning of the Zambia African National Congress and the detention of its leaders in March 1959. His status as a moderate was confirmed by his acceptance in August 1959 of an invitation from the British government to become a member of the Monckton commission, which was set up to consider the future of the federation. Radical nationalists boycotted its hearings, as its terms of reference did not include consideration of the break-up of the federation. The perception of many trade unionists that he had become a part of the colonial establishment led to Katilungu's loss of the presidency of the AMU in December 1960 and of the Trades Union Congress soon afterwards. He was, however, now free to devote his energies to nationalist politics and was elected deputy president of the ANC.<br>
<br>When Nkumbula was temporarily removed from the leadership of the ANC in 1961, as a result of his imprisonment following conviction for causing death by dangerous driving, Katilungu acted for him, and was also elected to occupy his seat in the legislative council. During his period in office Katilungu raised substantial funding from Moise Tshombe, leader of the secessionist government of Katanga, and laid the basis for a secret alliance between the ANC, Tshombe, and Roy Welensky, the federal prime minister, which was to play a significant part in the elections of 1962.<br>
<br>Many people thought that Katilungu was more effective as a leader of the ANC than Nkumbula. He was still acting as leader of the ANC when, on 9 November 1961, he was killed in a car accident on the Congo Pedicle road five miles from Makambo, on his way to Luapula province. He was buried three days later, survived by his wife, with whom he had six children. Katilungu's friends and family were reluctant to believe that his death was an accident. With his Bemba royal associations and his ability to mobilize support among Bemba-speakers in the copperbelt and in the northern and Luapula provinces, he was a significant political asset for the ANC, and a threat to the United National Independence Party. Many white political and business leaders also viewed him favourably. It remains an open question whether, if he had lived, the ANC would have performed better than it did in the elections of 1962 and had more influence in the final stages of the decolonization process. The union that he had done more than anyone else to create remained a powerful force, and an independent voice, in Zambian politics for several decades after his death.<br>
