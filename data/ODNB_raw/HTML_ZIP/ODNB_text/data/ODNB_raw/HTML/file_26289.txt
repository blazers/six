<span class="headword">Stanwix <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Roos]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1693, <em>d.</em> 1766), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was baptized on 19 March 1693, the son of the Revd John Roos (<i>d</i>. 1704), rector of Widmerpool, Nottinghamshire, and Matilda, the daughter of Thomas Stanwix of Carlisle. In 1706 he was commissioned as ensign and lieutenant, no doubt in part through the influence of his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57603/', "Thomas Stanwix")</script>, his father having died in 1704. He became captain in the 28th foot in 1722 and subsequently gained a high reputation as adjutant. Three years later Thomas Stanwix died; John Roos, as his heir, adopted the name Stanwix. He married Ada (<i>d</i>. 1754), daughter of Henry Holmes; they had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>The years of peace until 1739 produced no record of Stanwix's actions. In 1741 he was a major in the 10th regiment of marines, and in that year he stood for election at Carlisle, where he owned property, in the interest of Sir James Lowther. The mayor, too enthusiastic a supporter, closed the poll before his opponents had a chance to vote; Stanwix was unseated on petition. He was however returned at a by-election in 1746 and at the general elections of 1747 and 1754. He was lieutenant-colonel, with effective command, in the duke of Rutland's regiment raised to combat the Jacobite rising in 1745. Politically he was identified by 1747 with the opposition and became an equerry to Frederick, prince of Wales, in 1749, in which year the regiment was disbanded and he went onto half pay. After the prince's death he edged towards the government again and was made governor of Carlisle Castle in 1753; two years later he was made deputy quartermaster-general of the forces. In 1756, on the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, he volunteered for service in America and was appointed colonel-commandant of the 60th foot, the Royal Americans.<br>
<br>With the local rank of brigadier-general he commanded the relief of Fort Pitt in 1757 and the advance on Oswego in 1759 (one of the forts established to control the route was named Fort Stanwix). He was back in England next year, with the rank of lieutenant-general in the army and colonel of the 49th foot. In the general election that year he pulled out of the Carlisle contest on the second day; Lowther found him a seat at Appleby. He became mayor of Carlisle in 1763, however, when he was also appointed governor of the Isle of Wight. He was now a thorough government man, supporting the peace preliminaries in 1762 and George Grenville's administration in 1764. On 21 April 1763, at St James's, Piccadilly, he married his second wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1766), daughter of Marmaduke Sowle of Dublin. They had no children.<br>
<br>In 1766 Stanwix spent the summer inspecting the forces in Ireland. With his wife and daughter he was drowned when their ship sank in the Irish Sea, probably on 29 October 1766. The death of all three (his son had been killed in America in 1756) occasioned a complex chancery lawsuit, although administration was granted to his &#145;only next of kin&#146;, his nephew, Thomas Connor, on 2 December 1767  (TNA: PRO, PROB 6/143, fol. 68<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Stanwix was always a follower in his politics, never a force. In his military career, by contrast, he was competent and well respected, learning his craft in peace and successfully applying his skills in war, particularly as an administrator.<br>
