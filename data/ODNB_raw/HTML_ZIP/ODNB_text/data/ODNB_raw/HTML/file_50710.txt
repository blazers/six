<span class="headword">Janes,  Emily</span>  (1846&#150;1928), <span class="occ">women's welfare activist</span>, was born on 14 February 1846 at Tring, Hertfordshire, the eldest daughter of George Janes and Martha Stevens, the daughter of William Stevens of Cheddington, Buckinghamshire. She was educated at a private school at Chesham, Buckinghamshire, and began philanthropic work in Apsley, Bedfordshire, by undertaking voluntary parish duties including the management of clubs. From 1877 to 1878 she was diocesan secretary of the St Albans branch of the Girls Friendly Society, and for a year from 1880 she was matron at the Magdalen Hospital in Streatham. Up to this point she worked on a voluntary basis.<br>
<br>In 1882 Emily Janes was introduced by Louisa Hubbard (1836&#150;1906) to (Jane) Ellice Hopkins (1836&#150;1904), and for the next four years she worked as Ellice Hopkins's private secretary, campaigning for the amendment of laws relating to the protection of girls. This work led to the formation of Ladies' Associations for the Care of Friendless Girls: groups of women united by an awareness of a need to help and support young women and girls. From 1886 to 1895 Emily Janes worked as the honorary organizing secretary for the association. She was also a member of the National Vigilance Association, formed in 1885 &#145;to repress criminal vice and public immorality&#146;.<br>
<br>From 1886 onwards Emily Janes was funded by a group of friends who were keen to help her continue what they saw as her valuable and strenuous work. Her workload for 1891 was described in her obituary:<blockquote>In a year of 365 days, to speak at 170 meetings at most of which she was forced to undertake the whole burden and responsibility (no other speaker being provided), to attend committees, to spend on an average not less than three hours daily in correspondence, to travel hundreds of miles to and fro over a network of railways and upon every kind of road, in almost every sort of conveyance, and to be constantly called upon for advice in almost every kind of difficulty and distress, means a strain on heart, voice and brain which only exceptional devotion could carry on. (<span class="italic">National Council of Women News</span>)</blockquote>Aware that the great deal of philanthropic work being undertaken by women was unco-ordinated, Louisa Hubbard in 1890 wrote and circulated a suggestion for the formation of a Central Conference Council (CCC) to establish co-ordinating conferences of women workers. It was set up in 1891 with Emily Janes as its honorary organizing secretary, lecturer, and editor of its quarterly journal, the <span class="italic">Threefold Chord</span>. At a conference held in Nottingham in 1895, the CCC reformed as the National Union of Women Workers (NUWW), again with Emily Janes as its organizing secretary and editor of its journal, initially titled <span class="italic">An Occasional Paper</span>. From that time until 1917 Emily Janes worked tirelessly for the NUWW.<br>
<br>Emily Janes was clearly effective in her role of organizing secretary: in 1895 there were 10 branches of the NUWW, by 1918 there were 130. Throughout her working life she played a pivotal role in the organization of women undertaking philanthropic work, inspiring those who worked with her by her abilities and energy. Her success was felt to be due &#145;to her thorough grasp of the social questions of the day, and the practical common sense with which she discussed them&#146;. She had:<blockquote>a tact and a quiet force of character that drew people towards her and was to be of the highest value in bringing about the formation of those local associations which were for years the chief object of her travels through the country. (Pratt, 106)</blockquote>Emily Janes described the world in which she worked in her paper &#145;On the associated work of women in religion and philanthropy&#146;, which appeared in 1893 in Angela Burdett-Coutts's publication <span class="italic">Woman's Mission</span>. In 1898 she took over from Louisa Hubbard as editor of the <span class="italic">Englishwoman's Yearbook and Directory</span>.<br>
<br>In 1917 age and ill health compelled Emily Janes to resign as organizing secretary of the NUWW, but she continued to attend meetings and remained on the executive committee as a vice-president. Emily Janes never married. In 1910 she described her interests as reading, music, and conversation. She was living at 31 Tanza Road, Hampstead, London, in 1910, moving later to 90 Hampstead Way, Hendon, Hertfordshire, and then, towards the end of her life, to Hastings in Sussex.<br>
<br>Some time before her death Emily Janes had become completely paralysed. She died on 26 October 1928 at her home, Dunclutha, Hastings; a memorial service was held at Christ Church, Westminster, on 16 November 1928.<br>
