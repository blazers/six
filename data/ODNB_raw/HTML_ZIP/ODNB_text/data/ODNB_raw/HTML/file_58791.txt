<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Frankau,  Pamela Sydney</span>  (1908&#150;1967), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 3 January 1908 at 14A Great Cumberland Place, London, the younger of the two daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33243/', "Gilbert Frankau (1884&#150;1952)")</script>, novelist, and his first wife, Dorothea Frances Markham Drummond-Black (1874&#150;1945). Gilbert's mother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55572/', "Julia Frankau")</script> (whose pseudonym was Frank Danby) also wrote novels, giving Pamela a strong Jewish literary inheritance. Gilbert had small time for the home and less for the nursery; his departure from the family in 1919 when he left to marry an actress had no immediate effect on Pamela. In later years, however, being the stronger of the two sisters, she found herself having to give support, both financial and emotional, to her mother. Pamela's inability to remain solvent derived partly from her addiction to the gambling table, but mostly from her need to pay her mother's debts as well as her own, and her extreme generosity. After private lessons in the Old Rectory, Honiton, Devon, she and her sister, Ursula, were sent as boarders to Burgess Hill School for Girls, Sussex, from 1919 to 1924. Memories of this time are chronicled with her accustomed wit in the first part of the autobiographical <span class="italic">I Find Four People</span> (1935).<br>
<br>Slight and dark, with the look of Walt Disney's Bambi, and blessed with powerful attraction, a ready wit, and a passionate concern for others as well as herself, Pamela stood out in school as she did all her life. Her early hope was to go on the stage, but writing took over, and her first novel, <span class="italic">Marriage of Harlequin</span>, published in 1927 when she was nineteen, brought her much press notice, on the lines of &#145;talented daughter of a famous father&#146;. She wrote tirelessly&#151;before she was thirty-two she had published twenty novels, only three of which she cared to remember: <span class="italic">She and I</span> (1930), <span class="italic">I was the Man</span> (1932), and <span class="italic">Tassell-Gentle</span> (1934). All the early books, however, show traces of her idiosyncratic turn of phrase and her perception, foreshadowing what was to come. Her great-aunt, Eliza Aria, a well-known journalist and society hostess, introduced her to many of the famous of her time: John van Druten, G. B. Stern, and Rebecca West, with whom she was to have a close but stormy relationship; a rift of nine years was finally mended.<br>
<br>Pamela's affair with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36988/', "Humbert Wolfe")</script>, poet and civil servant, whom she met in 1931, so absorbed her that his sudden death from heart failure in 1940 after a birthday dinner (he was born on 5 January 1885) cut her life in two. Married with a daughter, Wolfe was known for his many attachments, but his love for Pamela was real, if not consistently faithful. Three weeks after his death she left for the United States; after some months there in emotional disarray she returned to England via Lisbon in November 1940, at the height of the blitz. A spell in the Ministry of Food, editing <span class="italic">Food Facts</span> (as she claimed, her largest seller), ended when she joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service in February 1942.<br>
<br>Pamela was troubled always by an ambiguous sexuality, and her next love was a fellow woman officer, who became her sponsor when in 1942 she was received into the Roman Catholic church. However, on 30 October 1945 she married Marshall Dill (1916&#150;2000), an American who was then in navy intelligence. In 1946 she gave birth to a son who lived only a few days. The marriage foundered, ending in divorce in 1951. But after a silence of nine years she had begun to write again, and returned to England with the manuscript of <span class="italic">The Willow Cabin</span> (1949) which, drawing as it did on the experience of her love for Humbert Wolfe, was to become a Book Society choice and her most successful novel. Her books now, combining her early wit and agility of mind with a depth of experience, commanded a wide readership, both in Britain and in the United States. They speak with her own voice, her particular use of language, her lightness of touch. This is both their strength and their weakness; a surface dazzle can sometimes obscure her profound understanding of the human condition. In her obituary Rebecca West wrote that &#145;none of her novels, though they are better than most, was as good as she was&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 9 June 1967). Pamela's own favourite was <span class="italic">The Bridge</span> (1957), concerned as it was with the imperatives of the Roman Catholic faith. <span class="italic">Ask me No More</span> (1958) showed the unacceptable face of Humbert Wolfe in the guise of Geoffrey Bliss, a playwright whose love life has a cat's-cradle complexity.<br>
<br>Though Pamela was not one to have at any time a tranquil life, the last ten years had a semblance of calm, producing steady and successful work, and a last attachment, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40484/', "Margaret (Peggy) Webster (1905&#150;1972)")</script>, daughter of Dame May Whitty, and a theatrical director of standing. They lived together at 55 Christchurch Hill, Hampstead, London; a telegram addressed to &#145;55 Christ Churchill&#146; brought from Pamela the comment &#145;with those two characters on our side, how can we lose?&#146;<br>
<br>In 1964 Pamela was operated on for breast cancer; the disease returned in the form of cancer of the bone. She endured much pain, and faced the future with courage and humour. She died on 8 June 1967, at her home in Christchurch Hill, her sister Ursula and Peggy with her. She was buried in Hampstead cemetery, where Ursula now lies with her. Her last work, <span class="italic">Colonel Blessington</span>, a thriller, concerning a confusion of sexual identity, unfinished at her death, was completed by the undersigned, and published in 1968.<br>
