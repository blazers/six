<span class="headword">Landon <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Maclean]</span>,  Letitia Elizabeth</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>L. E. L.]</span>  (1802&#150;1838), <span class="occ">poet and writer</span>, was born on 14 August 1802 at 25 Hans Place, Chelsea, the eldest child of John Landon (1756&#150;1824) and Catherine Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bishop (<i>d</i>. 1854). John Landon, the son of a country rector, had begun his career as a midshipman in the navy before joining&#151;and later becoming a partner in&#151;the army agency of Adair &amp; Co. in Pall Mall. Little is known about Catherine Bishop, Landon's mother, save that she was of Welsh extraction, the daughter of Mrs Bishop (<i>d</i>. 1826), a woman of independent means and a friend of Sarah Siddons, to whom Landon was to dedicate her first published collection of poetry. The Landons had two other children: Whittington Henry (1804&#150;1883), who went into the church, and Elizabeth (1812&#150;1825), who died aged thirteen.<h2>
<a name="Childhoodandfirstwritings"></a>Childhood and first writings</h2>At the age of five Landon began attending Miss Rowden's school at 22 Hans Place, where Mary Mitford and Lady Caroline Lamb were also educated. In 1809 the family moved to a large, if somewhat run down, country house called Trevor Park in East Barnet and John Landon carried out experiments in model farming at the nearby Coventry Farm. From this point on Landon was educated by her cousin Elizabeth and she soon showed a great interest in books and an exceptional talent for writing. With the end of the Napoleonic wars came a drop in the demand for military supplies and an agricultural depression. John Landon was seriously affected by both, and, in straitened circumstances, the family returned to London in 1815, moving first to Fulham and then, in 1816, to Old Brompton. One of their neighbours here was William Jerdan, editor of the <span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span>. Jerdan responded with enthusiasm when he saw Landon's poems, and her first published work, &#145;Rome&#146;, appeared in the <span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span> on 11 March 1820, signed simply with the initial &#145;L&#146;. Other poems followed, and in August 1821, with the financial aid of her grandmother, Landon published <span class="italic">The Fate of Adelaide: a Swiss Tale of Romance; and other Poems</span> under the full name of Letitia Elizabeth Landon. Although noted by a number of the major reviews, this collection did not generate a great deal of public interest, partly, perhaps, because the publisher went out of business one month later. That same month, however, two more of Landon's poems appeared in the <span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span>, this time signed &#145;L. E. L.&#146; Her &#145;Poetic Sketches&#146; accompanied by these initials then began to appear regularly, and the identity of the unknown romantic poetess aroused much speculation; the tantalizing initials, as Laman Blanchard notes in his <span class="italic">Life and Literary Remains of L. E. L.</span>, &#145;speedily became a signature of magical interest and curiosity&#146;  (1.30). In addition to producing poetry for the <span class="italic">Gazette</span> Landon also became Jerdan's chief reviewer. As the <span class="italic">Gazette</span> was one of the most influential journals of the time and had a notable influence on the sales of the books reviewed in its pages, Landon wielded a significant amount of power in this role, contributing to the decline of a number of literary reputations. Unfortunately these reviews were published anonymously and most have not been identified. Landon's next collection, <span class="italic">The Improvisatrice, and other Poems</span>, was published by Hurst and Robinson in 1824. The main reviews were split in their assessments of this collection, but the mysterious L. E. L. had captured the imagination of the general public and the book went through six editions in the first year.<h2>
<a name="Maturepoetry"></a>Mature poetry</h2>In 1824 Landon's father died, leaving his family relatively impoverished. An unexplained rift with her mother led Landon to move in with her maternal grandmother in Sloane Street, but she continued to support her mother financially and contributed to putting her brother Whittington through Oxford. Although Landon earned a substantial amount through her writing (according to William Jerdan more than &pound;2585 over the course of her career), most of this went towards the support of her family. Landon's next collection of poems, <span class="italic">The Troubadour: Poetical Sketches of Modern Pictures, and Historical Sketches</span>, appeared in 1825; Landon reached the height of her popularity and soon discovered the price of such fame for an independent woman of her time. Exaggerated stories about her began to be circulated. Since she wrote primarily about love, it was perhaps inevitable that many of these stories concerned her supposed conquests. As she reported with amusement:<blockquote>One young lady heard at Scarborough last summer, that I had had two hundred offers; and a gentleman at Leeds brought an account of three hundred and fifty straight from London. It is really very unfortunate that my conquests should so much resemble the passage to the North Pole and Wordsworth's Cuckoo, &#145;talked of but never seen&#146;. (Blanchard, 1.50&#150;51)</blockquote>Not all the gossip was quite as harmless as this. In 1826 Landon began to be slandered in the gutter press, primarily by <span class="italic">The Wasp</span>, a short-lived satirical magazine devoted to scandalous expos&eacute;s of popular personalities. One extended absence from London while visiting an uncle led to malicious reports that she had become pregnant by Jerdan and that, as the anonymous writer in <span class="italic">The Wasp</span> sniggered, &#145;she was ordered into the country to gather <i>fruit</i>, and to <i>deliver</i> an account thereof on her return&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Wasp</span>, 1826, 36). Landon was understandably distressed by such attacks, and accurately assessed her position in a letter to her friend Katherine Thomson:<blockquote>I think of the treatment I have received until my very soul writhes under the powerlessness of its anger. It is only because I am poor, unprotected, and dependent on popularity, that I am a mark for all the gratuitous insolence and malice of idleness and ill-nature. (Blanchard, 1.54)</blockquote>Following the death of her grandmother in 1826, Landon moved into an attic room in her old school at Hans Place, now run by the Misses Lance. More independent than ever, Landon also became even more productive. Over the next few years she produced two more collections of poetry, <span class="italic">The Golden Violet</span> (1827) and <span class="italic">The Venetian Bracelet</span> (1829); she contributed to many of the periodicals of the time, and to the annuals, the expensive illustrated gift books that were published at the end of each year. Landon edited many of these annuals and frequently, in the case of such works as <span class="italic">Fisher's Drawing Book Scrap Book</span>, also composed the entire contents, writing poems to illustrate the engravings with which she was provided. As Landon grew ever more successful, so she also was increasingly imitated, and much of the popular verse of the time reveals the marks of her style. Testimony to the extent of her influence is given, if somewhat grudgingly, by <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>'s comment that &#145;as she has undoubtedly founded a poetic school, we have unfeignedly wished that she would whip some dozen of her scholars&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 10 Dec 1831, 793).<br>
<br>Landon's poetry is marked by a sense of spontaneity, no doubt the combined result of her desire to suggest she was an <i>improvisatrice</i>, and the need, given both her financial requirements and her great popularity, to produce a prolific amount of verse in a short period of time. Considering the demands placed on her by her work, it is hardly surprising that, for much of her life, Landon was plagued by illness; her letters repeatedly refer to being confined to the house by a cold, and her friends and acquaintances often comment on her tendency to suffer from headaches and nervous disorders.<h2>
<a name="RomanceandReality"></a>Romance and Reality</h2>Landon's first novel, <span class="italic">Romance and Reality</span> (1831), revealed a completely different writing style from that which she affected in her role as the sentimental poetess L. E. L. The reviewers praised the witty commentary on modern life and remarked with approval on the new Landon that was revealed: where, asked the reviewer of <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, &#145;till now, dwelt the brave good sense&#151;the sarcasm bitter with medicine, not poison?&#146; But for <span class="italic">Romance and Reality</span>, he added, &#145;half our island might never have awoke from the dream that L. E. L. was an avatar of blue eyes, flaxen ringlets, and a susceptible heart&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 10 Dec 1831, 793). In fact, Landon had dark eyes and dark hair. The reviewer's assessment that this witty satire revealed the &#145;true&#146; Landon was echoed by Henry Chorley when he later observed that all three of her novels reflected:<blockquote>the conversation of their authoress&#151;which sparkled always brightly with quick fancy, and a <i>badinage</i> astonishing to those matter of fact persons who expected to find, in the manners and discourse of the poetess, traces of the weary heart, the broken lute, and the disconsolate willow tree. (H. Chorley, &#145;Mrs Maclean&#146;, <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 5 Jan 1839, 14)</blockquote>Now an integral part of the London literary scene, Landon became a key figure at many literary gatherings. She managed to charm most, but not all. Disraeli, describing one such gathering at the Bulwer-Lyttons' in 1832, reveals a certain class-laden disdain when he writes, &#145;I avoided L. E. L., who looked the very personification of Brompton&#151;pink satin dress and white satin shoes, red cheeks, snub nose, and her hair <i>&agrave; la Sappho</i>&#146;  (R. Disraeli, ed., <span class="italic">Lord Beaconsfield's Letters</span>, 1887, 71). The suggestion that Landon had a taste for vulgar finery is not borne out by the numerous portraits made of her, although she did appear to be interested in fashion, and was particularly fond of the more exotic styles of the time&#151;she was often depicted wearing voluminous leg-of-mutton sleeves and enormous hats. While Landon's family background was certainly respectable, as a woman living alone and making a living as a professional writer she herself was often seen as less than respectable. In response, she tended to swing between a desire to maintain an appearance of respectability and a healthy contempt for all the artificial distinctions that class would impose. Blanchard notes the difficulty of inducing her &#145;to condescend to be on her guard, to put the slightest restraint upon her speech, correspondence, or actions, simply because self-interest demanded it to save her conduct from misrepresentation&#146;  (Blanchard, 1.52).<br>
<br>In June 1834 Landon visited France; although she had the opportunity to meet such figures as Heine and Chateaubriand, she was less than pleased by her travels, complaining bitterly about sightseeing, &#145;the most tiresome thing in the world&#146;  (Jerdan, 202), and about the deficiencies of Parisian society&#151;it was not the season and there were few social events of any importance to attend: &#145;God never sent me into the world to use my hands, or my feet, or my eyes,&#146; she declared; &#145;he put all my activity into my tongue and ears&#146;  (ibid.). If Paris bored her, French literature both shocked and enchanted her; here she found &#145;extraordinary talent&#151;every page full of new ideas and thoughts&#151;they want nothing but a little religion and a little decency&#146;, and these, she added, were &#145;two trifling wants, to be sure&#146;  (Blanchard, 1.110).<h2>
<a name="Slanderanddeath"></a>Slander and death</h2>Before this trip to France, Landon had begun seeing John Forster (1812&#150;1876), then editor of <span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, and they eventually became engaged. The old scandals unfortunately soon erupted: Landon was again accused of improper behaviour, now not only with Jerdan, but also with William Maginn, Daniel Maclise, and Edward Bulwer-Lytton. This time, Landon does not seem to have been aware of the rumours. Forster, however, was; he went to Landon suggesting the stories should be refuted; she sent him to speak with her friends; he did and pronounced himself satisfied of her innocence, asking her to accept his protection by marrying him immediately. Landon responded by breaking the engagement. The ostensible reason she gave was that she could not allow Forster to marry someone who had been accused of improper behaviour, and Blanchard, in his <span class="italic">Life</span>, consequently speaks of &#145;the self-sacrifice she deemed herself called upon by duty to make&#146;  (Blanchard, 1.129). To her good friend Bulwer-Lytton, however, she told a different story, suggesting she was unable to marry someone who had behaved with such a lack of sensitivity:<blockquote>If his future protection is to harass and humiliate me as much as his present&#151;God keep me from it &hellip; I cannot get over the entire want of delicacy to me which could repeat such slander to myself. The whole of his late conduct to me personally has left behind almost dislike&#151;certainly fear of his imperious and overbearing temper. (M. Sadleir, <span class="italic">Bulwer: a Panorama</span>, 1931, 426)</blockquote>In October 1836, Landon was invited to a dinner party at the home of Matthew Forster, who was involved in the administration of the Gold Coast; here she met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37719/', "George Maclean (1801&#150;1847)")</script>, governor of the British post at Cape Coast, west Africa. Maclean and Landon soon appear to have reached an understanding, although they do not seem to have been, officially, engaged. At the beginning of 1837, however, Maclean had second thoughts about the relationship; he went to Scotland, remaining there for more than six months. Landon was distraught, and her friends rallied round, putting pressure on Maclean to marry her. Reluctantly, he returned to London, and on 7 June 1838 they were married in a private ceremony at St Mary's, Bryanston Square, London. The marriage was not made public and Landon stayed with friends until 5 July, when the Macleans sailed from Portsmouth for Cape Coast, arriving on 16 August. Just two months later, on 15 October 1838, Landon, at the age of thirty-six, was found dead in her room, apparently slumped against the door with an empty bottle of prussic acid in her hand. Such a mysterious and melodramatic death ensured that Landon was not soon forgotten, and even if the taste for her particular kind of poetry did not last long into the Victorian age, she had a notable influence on the Victorian women poets who followed her. Elizabeth Barrett Browning, for example, comments on the sadness of Landon's life and her isolation in &#145;L. E. L.'s Last Question&#146; (1839), a reference to the words Landon supposedly spoke when she left England: &#145;Do you think of me as I think of you?&#146; Christina Rossetti then takes up a line from &#145;L. E. L.'s Last Question&#146;&#151;&#145;Whose heart was breaking for a little love&#146;&#151;as the epigraph to her &#145;L. E. L.&#146;. Perhaps more importantly, the women poets who followed Landon reacted against the limitations that had been imposed on her, against the emphasis on women writing only from the heart. This is particularly notable in <span class="italic">Aurora Leigh</span>, where Barrett Browning not only draws on the details of Landon's life, but also shows Aurora rejecting the notion of woman as <i>improvisatrice</i>, and gradually moving from poetess to woman poet.<br>
<br>Numerous memoirs written by friends and acquaintances emerged soon after the announcement of her death, all attempting to interpret the woman known as L. E. L. and offer their particular explanations of her death; the interest in Landon continued well into the twentieth century, with such fictional reconstructions as D. E. Enfield's <span class="italic">L. E. L.: a Mystery of the Thirties</span> (1928) and Clyde Chantler's <span class="italic">Eight Weeks: a Novel</span> (1965). In spite of all the attempts to solve the mystery, the circumstances of Landon's death have never been satisfactorily explained and it is unlikely any new information will come to light. An inquest was held on the afternoon of her death, and the doctor in attendance was so convinced that death was caused by the prussic acid he did not think an autopsy necessary. The depositions given by the witnesses at the inquest, including Maclean and Mrs Bailey, the woman who found Landon, are full of contradictions, discrepancies, and omissions. The conclusion of the inquest was death by accidental overdose of prussic acid, and Landon was buried early that same evening in the rectangular drill ground of the castle.<br>
