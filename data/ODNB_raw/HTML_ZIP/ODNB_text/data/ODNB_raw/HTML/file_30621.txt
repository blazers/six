<span class="headword">Barry,  Alfred</span>  (1826&#150;1910), <span class="occ">Anglican bishop of Sydney and educationist</span>, was born at Ely Place, Holborn, London, on 15 January 1826, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1550/', "Sir Charles Barry (1795&#150;1860)")</script>, architect, whose <span class="italic">Life and Works</span> he published in 1867, and elder brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1556/', "Edward Middleton Barry")</script>, whose Royal Academy lectures on architecture he edited with a memoir in 1881; his mother was Sarah (1798&#150;1882), daughter of Samuel Rowsell. Educated at King's College, London, from 1841 to 1844, Barry proceeded in 1844 to Trinity College, Cambridge; in 1848 he was placed fourth among the wranglers and seventh in the first class of the classical tripos. He also won a Smith's prize. He was elected a fellow of Trinity in the same year. He graduated BA in 1848, and proceeded MA in 1851, BD in 1860, and DD in 1866. He was made a DCL of Oxford in 1870 and of Durham in 1888.<br>
<br>Ordained deacon in 1850 and priest in 1853, Barry became sub-warden of Trinity College, Glenalmond, the combined theological college and public school of the Scottish Episcopal church in 1849. On 13 August 1851 he married Louisa Victoria, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14092/', "Thomas Smart Hughes")</script>, canon of Peterborough. In 1854 he became headmaster of Leeds grammar school, and from 1862 to 1868 he was principal of Cheltenham College. During his tenure of the latter office he extended the buildings of the school and raised its academic prestige.<br>
<br>In 1868 Barry was appointed principal of King's College, London (of which he had been a fellow since 1849), in succession to Richard William Jelf. Barry was an innovative and energetic, even pushy, principal. He reorganized the administration of the college and relaxed the rules that demanded strict religious conformity. He brought its teaching up to date, especially in the fields of engineering and medicine, and extended the evening-class department to meet the needs of young working men keen to further their education. He arranged that students for the theological associateship could attend classes for two years without sacrificing their daytime employment, and devote their whole time to their college course only in their third year. A strong supporter of higher education for women, in 1871 he instituted &#145;lectures for ladies&#146; at Richmond and Twickenham, and in 1881 he established at Kensington a women's department. From 1871 to 1877 he served on the London school board.<br>
<br>Of a fine presence and with a sonorous voice, Barry was an effective speaker and preacher. Gladstone made him a residentiary canon of Worcester in 1871, and in 1881 he transferred him to a similar office in Westminster Abbey. Appointed honorary chaplain to Queen Victoria in 1875, and chaplain-in-ordinary in 1879, Barry also held the Boyle lectureship from 1876 to 1878. He published the first series of lectures as <span class="italic">What is Natural Theology?</span> (1877) and the second as <span class="italic">The Manifold Witness for Christ</span> (1880).<br>
<br>Barry always had his aim set on high office in the church. However, his &#145;intense and notorious desire to secure a see&#146;  (Hearnshaw, 334) counted against him, and he was not appointed to an English bishopric. After refusing the see of Calcutta in 1876, in 1883 he accepted appointment to the diocese of Sydney, Australia. The bishop of Sydney was also primate of the Church of England in Australia and Tasmania, and was metropolitan of New South Wales. Barry was consecrated in Westminster Abbey on 1 January 1884. Misfortune attended his departure: he sent on to Australia his entire library, lectures, and manuscripts in a vessel which was lost in a shipwreck. Queen Victoria and others showed their sympathy by endeavouring to replace the books.<br>
<br>Barry was enthroned on 24 April 1884 in St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney. Later that year he published a collection of sermons, <span class="italic">First Words in Australia</span>. Evangelicals, who were powerful in the diocese of Sydney, had not wanted Barry as bishop. He himself was a low-churchman of liberal sympathies, opposed to church parties and keen to promote Anglican comprehensiveness. In Sydney, where anti-Christian secularists were on the attack, he sought through lectures and writings to reinterpret Christian doctrines in the light of modern science and scholarship. For the sake of &#145;the higher life of the colony&#146;, he offered to co-operate with Christians of other denominations  (Phillips, 14). Many protestants welcomed his leadership, but evangelicals were alarmed by his liberalism and his unwillingness to discourage the spread of moderate high-church practices in some Sydney churches. Barry emphasized the importance of the cathedral as the centre of diocesan life and introduced daily choral services, and he also overhauled the diocesan administration.<br>
<br>In the field of education Barry was likewise very active: he strengthened the existing church secondary schools, founded two more, and encouraged Anglicans to utilize the provisions for religious instruction in state schools. Elected in 1886 to the senate of the University of Sydney, he wanted to see closer links between theological and university education. To this end he arranged to move the diocesan theological college, Moore College, from the edge of Sydney to a new site adjacent to the university.<br>
<br>In 1886 he was the first bishop in Australia to &#145;set apart&#146; a deaconess. As primate he successfully urged the Australian church to accept responsibility for missionary work in New Guinea. However, despite his vigorous leadership Barry was never at home in New South Wales. In colonial eyes his manner appeared distant and condescending. His two visits to England, involving long absences from Australia, seemed to indicate where his heart was. It was no surprise when in 1889 he resigned the see and returned permanently to England.<br>
<br>In England Barry once more failed in his quest for a see, and from 1889 to 1891 he was assistant to A. W. Thorold, bishop of Rochester. In 1891 he took charge of the diocese of Exeter during the absence in Japan of Bishop Edward Henry Bickersteth. Finally, from 1891 until his death, he was canon of St George's Chapel, Windsor, where he continued his literary activities. In 1892 he was Bampton lecturer at Oxford, taking as his subject &#145;Some lights of science on the faith&#146;; in 1894&#150;5 he gave the Hulsean lectures at Cambridge, entitled &#145;The ecclesiastical expansion of England in the growth of the Anglican communion&#146;. From 1895 to 1900 he was rector of St James's, Piccadilly, rendering episcopal assistance in central London to the bishop, Frederick Temple. After 1900 he confined himself to his canonry at Windsor, representing the chapter in the lower house of convocation from 1893 until 1908. He died in his sleep at his residence in the cloisters, Windsor Castle, on 1 April 1910, and was buried on 6 April in the cloisters at Worcester Cathedral, beside his only daughter, Mary Louisa, who had died in 1880. His wife and two sons survived him.<br>
