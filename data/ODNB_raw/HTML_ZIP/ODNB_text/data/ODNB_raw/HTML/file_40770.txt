<span class="headword">Anes,  Dunstan</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Gonsalvo Anes; <em>alias </em>Gonzalo Jorge]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1520&#150;1594), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born in Portugal as Gonsalvo, the second son of a merchant, Jorge Anes (<i>d</i>. in or before 1540), and his wife, Elizabeth Rodrigues (<i>b</i>. 1481, <i>d</i>. after 1568). He had an elder brother, Francisco, and two sisters. His father was born a Jew in Valladolid and brought to Portugal as a child, where the family was baptized by force in 1497. Jorge Anes died in Portugal. When the Portuguese inquisition started to persecute the New Christians, his widow and four children left Portugal late in 1540 and took refuge in London. She settled in the parish of St Nicholas Acon, south of Lombard Street.<br>
<br>In England Gonsalvo Anes changed his name to Dunstan Anes, almost certainly by confirmation of Edmund Bonner, bishop of London. On 2 December 1548 he married Constance (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1530, <i>d</i>. in or after 1594), daughter of Simon Ruiz, surgeon at St Nicholas Acon. He acquired a house in Crutched Friars and they had fourteen children. They conformed to the established church, while practising Judaism in the privacy of their home, because Judaizing was then a capital crime in England. On 22 June 1557 Dunstan was admitted to the freedom of the city of London on the recommendation of Philip and Mary I, and also to the Grocers' Company. On 6 June 1568 Dunstan registered his coat of arms and genealogy at the College of Arms. He described himself as &#145;Purvyor and Marchant for the Queen's Ma<sup>tis</sup> Grosery for the Howseholde&#146;  (<span class="italic">Visitation of London</span>, 74&#150;5). On 22 November 1573 a passport was issued to Dunstan Anes and Robert Chatterton &#145;to pass into France for provision of wines for her Majesty, with their four geldings and one hundred marks in money&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC, <i>1571&#150;5</i></span>, 142&#150;3).<br>
<br>In 1581, when Don Antonio, the claimant to the Portuguese crown, went to England, Dunstan Anes was active in his support and in procuring munitions for his expedition to the Azores. His eldest daughter, Sarah, had married Roderigo Lopez, the queen's physician. Dunstan and his sons are mentioned several times in the dispatches of the Spanish ambassador, Bernardino de Mendoza. He reported that one Gonzalo Jorge was acting for Don Antonio, and that his second son, Jacob Anes, was living in Lisbon and spying for him. In October 1581 he reported that William Anes (1562&#150;1630), Dunstan's seventh son, had gone to Lisbon by way of France in the queen's ships with a cargo of wheat and letters from Don Antonio. He described William as a young man of twenty, &#145;well built with a fair and handsome face and a small fair beard&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, 1580&#150;86, 179). Philip ordered the arrest of Jacob Anes, but in March 1582 Mendoza reported that he had gone to London from Terceira and had spoken to the queen. In 1583 Dunstan's eldest son, Benjamin, sent a report from Terceira to Sir Francis Walsingham. Jacob Anes migrated to Constantinople with his sisters Elizabeth and Rachel in the service of Alvaro Mendes, duke of Mytilene. There he converted to open Judaism, and in 1613, &#145;for the love that he bore to our English nation&#146;, he received the traveller Thomas Coryate &#145;with very courteous entertainment&#146;  (Purchas, x). Three of Dunstan Anes's sons became free of the Grocers' Company by patrimony: Benjamin, in 1571; James, or Diego, the third son, in 1583; and William, in 1594. In 1588 Pedro de Santa Cruz denounced Dunstan Anes and his son William to the alcalde of Madrid:<blockquote>He knows, as it is public and notorious in London, that by race they are all Jews, and it is notorious that in their own homes they live as such observing their Jewish rites, but publicly they attend the Lutheran Churches. (Wolf, &#145;Jews in Elizabethan England&#146;)</blockquote>Dunstan Anes died intestate at Crutched Friars in 1594 and was buried under his pew at St Olave's Church, Hart Street. Administration of his estate was granted to his widow.<br>
<br>William Anes joined his uncle Francis, who was a merchant and burgomaster of Youghal in Ireland. In October 1583 he went to London from Cork with letters from Thomas Butler, tenth earl of Ormond, to the privy council; William had &#145;behaved himself like a tall and valiant man against the traitors at the last attempt against that town&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire., 1574&#150;85</span>, 474). William carried on the family business as a London merchant. In 1601 he entered into a bond for &pound;3000 at the high court of admiralty to enable a group of Amsterdam Portuguese Jewish merchants to recover their goods from six ships of Emden taken prize by Sir Robert Mansell in the queen's ships. In 1626 William Anes and Philip Burlamachi were the king's factors for tobacco and licensed to import 50,000 pounds of tobacco free of duty for the king.<br>
<br>The Anes family was unusual in that its members lived, traded, and prospered in Tudor and Jacobean London for ninety years, publicly conforming to the established church and practising Judaism in their homes.<br>
