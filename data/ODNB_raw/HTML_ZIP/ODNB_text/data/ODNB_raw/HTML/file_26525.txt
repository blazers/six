<span class="headword">Stillingfleet,  Benjamin</span>  (1702&#150;1771), <span class="occ">botanist and writer</span>, was born in the rectory at Wood Norton, Norfolk, the eldest child and only son of the four children born to <a name="cosubject_26527"></a><span class="headword">Edward Stillingfleet</span>  (1661&#150;1708), <span class="occ">physician and Church of England clergyman</span>, and his wife, Mary Ann (<i>fl</i>. 1670&#150;1710).<h2>
<a name="EdwardStillingfleet"></a>Edward Stillingfleet</h2>Edward Stillingfleet was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26526/', "Edward Stillingfleet (1635&#150;1699)")</script>, bishop of Worcester, and his first wife, Andrea Dobyns. He was born in February 1661 at his father's rectory in Sutton, Bedfordshire. Misfortune clouded his early years for his two younger sisters died in infancy, soon to be followed by their mother, and Edward himself suffered a permanent deformity caused by a hunting accident. In 1665 his father was appointed rector of St Andrew's, Holborn, London, and by 1667 he had embarked on a second marriage which brought him a further seven children. A few years later Edward entered St Paul's School, which had reopened in 1671 after its destruction in the great fire of 1666. There pupils could study Arabic and Hebrew as well as the customary Latin and Greek. Like his father, Edward completed his education at St John's College, Cambridge, and was elected a Lady Margaret scholar, graduating BA in 1682 and MA in 1685, with a college fellowship in 1683. After election as FRS in 1688 he was appointed Gresham professor of physic from 1689 until 1692, when he was awarded a doctorate in medicine.<br>
<br>Influential family connections and academic success should have led to a prosperous career, but Edward Stillingfleet's Jacobite sympathies, fecklessness in money matters, and a disastrous marriage in 1692 enraged the bishop and caused a lasting rift between father and son. His marriage also lost him his lucrative academic appointments and he spent the next few years as a struggling physician in Lynn, Norfolk. He was ordained priest in 1698 and obtained the living of Wood Norton and Swanton, Norfolk, where he remained until his death at home in June 1708. Edward Stillingfleet, having inherited nothing from his father, left his widow, Mary Ann, his son, Benjamin, and his three daughters in considerably reduced circumstances.<h2>
<a name="BenjaminStillingfleetastutor"></a>Benjamin Stillingfleet as tutor</h2>Benjamin Stillingfleet was educated at Norwich School where he excelled in classical language and literature. In 1720 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, as a sizar at the request of the master, Dr Richard Bentley, former domestic chaplain to Bishop Stillingfleet and private tutor to James, the son of his second marriage. Distinction in both classics and mathematics led to a scholarship in 1723 and the degree of BA the following year. The next fourteen years were spent at Felbrigg Hall, Norfolk, as tutor to William, aged seven when Stillingfleet arrived, the only son of Elizabeth Windham or Wyndham, a niece of Bishop Stillingfleet. She and her husband treated their young cousin with friendship and respect, while Stillingfleet devoted himself wholeheartedly to the education of his pupil. However, he did not entirely relish his subordinate status and dependence on the generosity of others and in 1726 he applied for a fellowship at his old college. His rejection was ascribed to the formidable Dr Bentley, whose supposed excuse was that Stillingfleet was too fine a gentleman to be buried in a college. Whatever the reason, Stillingfleet seldom afterwards missed an opportunity of expressing his resentment towards Bentley.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, at Felbrigg, Stillingfleet enjoyed the esteem and affection of his pupil, making study enjoyable by mingling instruction and amusement. When William's father, Ashe Windham, a typical country gentleman devoted to the pleasures of the field, expressed concern at the amount of time devoted to Latin and Greek in the course of a liberal education, Stillingfleet wisely refrained from dispute with his benefactor and quietly continued to instil in his pupil the advantages of classical learning, particularly that of the Greeks. When William came of age his mentor wrote him a long letter of advice quoted in full by his friend William Coxe in his <span class="italic">Literary Life and Select Works of Benjamin Stillingfleet</span> (1811, vol. 1, chap. 3). This document gives a fascinating insight into the author's own philosophy of life; he condemns freethinkers, recommending the protestant view of Christianity and the study of scripture from the original sources. Wealth should be used charitably to bring joy to others. He regards incontinence before marriage as the source of much unhappiness after it, although women are partly to blame for thinking that a reformed rake makes the best husband. Less conventional and more revealing of his own predilections is his choice of a little farming as the most suitable diversion for a man of fortune. His didactic prose becomes more animated as he lists the dire results of the current neglect of agriculture:<blockquote>the want of this taste has filled the nation with gamesters, dancing masters, fiddlers, French tailors and Italian singers; it has crowded the town with gaudy beggars and distressed the country with racking landlords, who think they have nothing to do upon their estate but go once a year to gather their rent, and pass a few months in a pitiful obscurity, the better to make a figure in town.</blockquote>Next he recommends the lifelong pursuit of all branches of learning, above all natural and experimental philosophy to which mathematics is an important adjunct. He concludes with another appeal for generosity to the less fortunate, a virtue from which he benefited all his life and which he practised in his turn.<h2>
<a name="Thegrandtour"></a>The grand tour</h2>Stillingfleet's own strength of character had already been put to the test when, in his early twenties, he fell in love with Anne Barnes, a frequent visitor to Felbrigg. He hoped that an improvement in his circumstances might make marriage possible, but after ten years' courtship the lady's prudence outweighed her affection and she accepted a more advantageous offer. This disappointment induced a profound melancholia in the young man which never entirely left him. To raise his spirits and remove him from the object of his hopeless passion, Ashe Windham sent Stillingfleet on a tour to the continent with William. They set off in 1737 for Italy and Switzerland where they met other wealthy young men making the grand tour, notably Robert Price and Richard Aldworth Neville, both to become lifelong friends of Stillingfleet. In 1740 the friends settled in Geneva, a city much favoured by the English, where French could be studied in a safely protestant environment. They formed a community known as the &#145;Common Room&#146;, which was dedicated to the pursuit of literary discussion and play-reading. Ambitious theatrical productions were performed, which fellow expatriates attended with flattering enthusiasm for their novelty and naturalistic style of acting later adopted by Garrick. Stillingfleet was in charge of stage machinery and assisted Price with the orchestra and with writing music for the pantomimes. More strenuous outdoor pursuits were not neglected, however, and Stillingfleet and his pupil, attracted by the spectacular scenery, made frequent excursions into the valleys of the Alps. In 1741 they joined Dr Richard Pococke in an exploration of the Mer de Glace in the valley of Chamonix. Windham and Price, with the assistance of Stillingfleet, published in 1744 <span class="italic">&#145;An Account of the Glacieres or Ice Alps in Savoy&#146;</span> which helped to popularize those stupendous works of nature, at that time largely unknown in England and Europe.<h2>
<a name="Londonlife"></a>London life</h2>By 1743 this life of carefree indulgence was at an end. Stillingfleet returned to England with his pupil, but not to Felbrigg, where he was no longer needed as a tutor and where he risked a painful encounter with his lost love. Thus homeless and with no apparent ambition to enter a profession, he found himself dependent on the bounty of Ashe Windham, who gave him an annuity of &pound;100 a year. When his patron died in 1749 Stillingfleet continued to receive an allowance from William Windham, his former pupil. Stillingfleet then settled in a house in Panton Square, London, rented by William Windham and Price. He made frequent visits to the country estates of friends such as Neville and Robert Marsham, occupying himself mainly with literary pursuits and the study of classic authors, particularly Homer, Plato, and above all Aristotle. His own critical and philosophical writings at this time were never published. A more serious project, a commentary on Milton's <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>, intended to correct the errors of Stillingfleet's old enemy Richard Bentley, also remained unpublished, but his notes were used in Henry Todd's edition of 1801. Stillingfleet expressed his admiration for Milton in sonnets dedicated to his friends. These and a poem entitled &#145;Essay on conversation&#146;, addressed to William Windham, were published in volume two of Coxe's biography, but Stillingfleet is not remembered as a poet; his verse, though enlivened by the occasional satirical jibe against the hated Bentley, was competent but mostly uninspired.<h2>
<a name="BotanizinginHereford"></a>Botanizing in Hereford</h2>When in 1746 Price married and went to live on the family estate of Foxley, Herefordshire, Stillingfleet began to spend much of his time in a cottage near his friend's mansion, happily engaged in studious and rural pursuits. He declined several offers to travel as tutor to sons of distinguished families, offering as excuse to his anxious friends his delicate health and lack of worldly ambition. Poor eyesight made study difficult, so strenuous outdoor pursuits, in particular gardening, became the remedy for his ills. It was natural that Stillingfleet, with his wide-ranging intellectual curiosity, should next develop an enthusiasm for botany. After an initial study of the early Greek writers Dioscorides and Theophrastus and of more recent botanists such as Gerard and Ray, Stillingfleet later (1750&#150;55) came to recognize the superiority of the system of classification promulgated by Linnaeus. The works of the great Swedish botanist were little known in England at that time and it was the publication in 1759 of Stillingfleet's <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Tracts</span> that gave the Linnaean system wider recognition.<br>
<br>This work, Stillingfleet's most significant achievement, consists of translations of selected essays from the <span class="italic">Amoenitates academicae</span> (<span class="italic">Philosophical Diversions</span>) of Linnaeus and his pupils. Stillingfleet added his own comments and concluded the work with an original treatise, <span class="italic">Observations on Grasses</span>, which included suggestions for the best species for the improvement of turf and the nourishment of cattle. A second edition was published in 1762 with several additions including a &#145;Calendar of flora&#146; and eleven plates, drawn by Robert Price, illustrating the different species of grasses recommended by the author. In his portrait by Zoffany (<i>c</i>.1762) Stillingfleet is shown holding a magnifying glass and a volume with grasses on the table, an allusion to his treatise.<br>
<br>In the remarkable preface to the <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Tracts</span>, Stillingfleet not only gave a lucid account of the Linnaean system but also made a vigorous plea for the study of natural science, arguing that mere curiosity in one age may lead to practical benefits in another. The publication of this work was considered to be the beginning of the establishment of Linnaean botany in England, a view certainly endorsed by Sir James Edward Smith in his article on Richard Pulteney in Rees's <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia</span> (1819, vol. 23). In the preface Stillingfleet expressly thanked Dr William Watson for his assistance in his work. Watson, Solander, and William Hudson were botanist friends whose company he enjoyed when in London. It was Stillingfleet who introduced the writings of Linnaeus to his neighbour William Hudson, and encouraged him to write the <span class="italic">Flora Anglica</span> published in 1762.<h2>
<a name="Londonmusicandliterarycircles"></a>London music and literary circles</h2>In 1760 Stillingfleet was offered by Lord Barrington, Price's brother-in-law, the unlikely post of barrack master at Kensington, a mainly honorary position bringing in about &pound;100 a year. Unfortunately this increase in income was accompanied by new responsibilities, for the deaths of two sisters and their husbands left Stillingfleet with the care of two nephews and a niece. The deaths of his friends Windham and Price in 1761 caused him further anguish. Now permanently based in London, Stillingfleet found the practice of botany less convenient and he began to cultivate his interest in music. He published anonymously in 1771 his last work, <span class="italic">Principles and Power of Harmony</span>, a translation from the Italian of Tartini's <span class="italic">Trattato di musica</span>, which clarified and corrected the original. It won the approval of Dr Charles Burney and a remarkably large proportion of the article on Stillingfleet in the <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia</span> (1819, vol. 34) is devoted to an analysis of this work, in which it is called &#145;the most clear, agreeable and interesting tract on a dark, obscure and speculative subject&#146;.<br>
<br>In a letter from London, dated 7 June 1760, the poet Thomas Gray wrote of his acquaintance with Stillingfleet, &#145;who lives in a garret here in the winter, that he may support some near relations who depend upon him. He is always employed and always cheerful, and seems to me a very worthy honest man.&#146; Stillingfleet's versatility and amiable but modest character made him welcome in literary circles in spite of a few (endearing) eccentricities. His habit of wearing blue instead of formal black stockings at ladies' evening assemblies is supposed to have given rise to the title &#145;Blue-stocking Clubs&#146; from which the word bluestocking is derived. James Boswell repeated this story in his <span class="italic">Life of Johnson</span> (part 8, 1779&#150;81), adding that the excellence of Stillingfleet's conversation was so greatly missed when he was absent that it used to be said, &#145;We can do nothing without the blue stockings&#146;.<br>
<br>Benjamin Stillingfleet died at his lodgings in Piccadilly on 15 December 1771, leaving most of his modest estate to his remaining sister. He ordered his manuscripts to be burned but left a few to his friend Thomas Pennant. He was buried on 19 December in nearby St James's Church, where some years later Edward Hawke Locker, grandson of Stillingfleet's favourite sister, Elizabeth, erected a memorial tablet.<br>
