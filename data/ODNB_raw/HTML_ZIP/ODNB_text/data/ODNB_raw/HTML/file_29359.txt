<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Widdrington,  William</span>, first Baron Widdrington  (1610&#150;1651), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was born on 11 July 1610, the only son of Sir Henry Widdrington (<i>d</i>. 1623), of Great Swinburne and Widdrington, Northumberland, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Sir Nicholas Curwen, of Workington, Cumberland. His father died on 4 September 1623, when William was thirteen; in February 1627 the king granted his wardship to his kinsman William Cavendish, Lord Mansfield (later earl of Newcastle), with the expectation that he was to marry the daughter of John Steward of Coldingham. In the event the match seems not to have taken place, and on 10 January 1630 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1676), daughter and heir of Sir Anthony Thorold, of Blankney, Lincolnshire. They had eight sons and two daughters. Widdrington was knighted by the king at Newmarket on 18 March 1632.<br>
<br>From 1635 to 1640 Widdrington took an active part in the administration of Northumberland, and served as high sheriff in 1636&#150;7; in 1640 he was a deputy lieutenant for the county. He also evidently had a place at court. When the king set up a separate household for the prince of Wales in 1638, with Newcastle as its governor, Widdrington was, according to Clarendon's account, chosen one of the prince's gentlemen of the privy chamber. He was elected MP for Northumberland in both the Short and the Long parliaments. His hostility to the Scots, whose army was quartered in his county, and his loyalty to Charles I was clear at the outset of the Long Parliament, for he had to apologize to the house on 10 November 1640 for calling the covenanting army &#145;invading rebels&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 25). On 15 March 1641 he presented to the commissioners for the Scottish treaty a petition concerning the depredations in the northern counties caused by the Scots while they awaited pay due from England. He was one of the fifty-six members whose names were posted as &#145;betrayers of their country&#146; for voting against the attainder of Strafford in May 1641. He has been taken as one of those MPs who, emerging early as an opponent of the Scots, was to become one of &#145;the inner ring of the Royalist party in the Commons&#146;  (C. Russell, <span class="italic">The Causes of the English Civil War</span>, 1990, 15).<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the civil war Widdrington took up arms for the king, who created him a baronet on 9 July 1642. Five days later he was in Newcastle, apparently raising forces; his steward brought in a company of tenants in arms for the king. In an army list of 1642 he appears as major of Sir Lewis Dyve's regiment. In consequence of his royalism parliament expelled him on 26 August 1642.<br>
<br>During the war Widdrington joined the earl of Newcastle's northern army, serving with him in Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and Lincolnshire, and with particular distinction at Bradford. Following the death of Charles Cavendish in July 1643 he was given command of the south-eastern section of Newcastle's command, particularly Lincolnshire and Rutland, and he may have had some role in Nottinghamshire. Margaret Cavendish, duchess of Newcastle, says that he was &#145;president of the council of war, and commander-in-chief of the three counties of Lincoln, Rutland, and Nottingham&#146;  (Cavendish, 166). In August 1643 he was put in command of the garrison at Lincoln, and he and John Henderson were defeated at Horncastle, in Lincolnshire, by the army of the eastern association on 11 October. On 2 November he was created Baron Widdrington of Blankney, Lincolnshire.<br>
<br>In early 1644 Widdrington was a member of the House of Lords at Oxford when it wrote to the Scottish privy council condemning the solemn league and covenant. He assisted in the defence of York in June 1644. After the battle of Marston Moor he accompanied Newcastle to Hamburg, and eventually to Paris. He stayed in France until the summer of 1648, before returning to the Low Countries, where he joined Prince Charles. His extensive coalmines and mills were sequestered from 1646, and the mines sold by the treason trustees. He himself was proscribed by parliament on 14 March 1649 and his estates confiscated; on 17 July his wife was granted a pass to go beyond the sea.<br>
<br>Widdrington crossed over to Scotland with Charles in June 1650 but did not hold command until after the defeat at Dunbar, on 3 September 1650. The committee of estates regarded him as &#145;wrong principled&#146; and ordered him repeatedly to quit the kingdom, but eventually, on 28 December, gave him leave to stay. He followed Charles into England in 1651, and joined the earl of Derby's forces in Lancashire. Derby's force was routed at Wigan Lane by Robert Lilburne on 25 August, and Widdrington mortally wounded. According to Clarendon he was slain on the field, having been wounded many times and refused the quarter offered him; other accounts suggest that he died a day or two later. He was succeeded by his eldest son, William; a daughter, Jane, married Sir Charles Stanley, Derby's nephew.<br>
<br>Clarendon described Widdrington as &#145;one of the most goodly persons of that age, being near the head higher than most tall men&#146;. He remembered a man who was quick-tempered but ready to apologize when his anger and indignation had overstepped the mark:<blockquote>He was a man of great courage and choler, by the last of which he incurred the ill will of many, who imputed to it an insolence of nature, which no man was farther from, nor of a nature more civil and candid towards all in business or conversation. (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 5.185)</blockquote>
