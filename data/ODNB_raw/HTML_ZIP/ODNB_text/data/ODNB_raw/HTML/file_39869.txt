<span class="headword">Plant,  Cyril Thomas Howe</span>, Baron Plant  (1910&#150;1986), <span class="occ">trade union official</span>, was born on 27 August 1910 in Leek, Staffordshire, the only son and elder child of Sidney Plant, manager of a Co-operative Society shop, and his wife, Rosina Edna Thomas, who previously ran a grocer's shop. He was educated at Leek high school, where he was head boy and captain of the cricket team. In 1927 he began work as a sorting clerk in the post office in Leek, where his interest in trade unions began. In these early years he was a keen local amateur association football player, and later became a referee, developing an interest in football that he retained throughout his life.<br>
<br>In 1934 Plant was successful in the limited competition for entry to the civil service clerical class. He joined the Inland Revenue in the collection service as an assistant collector. He quickly became a delegate to the conference of the newly formed Inland Revenue Staff Federation. He was elected to the executive committee of the federation, and in 1937 became honorary secretary of the collection section. At this time the federation was still an unsettled alliance of former collection, inspectorate, and valuation divisions. Plant developed, and later finely tuned, his skills as a mediator and conciliator, helping to bind the union together. Later his skills as a &#145;fixer&#146; were to be of great service to the international trade union movement. He was appointed in 1944 to a full-time federation post as assistant secretary and then deputy general secretary. In 1960 he succeeded Douglas Houghton as its general secretary. There were by then relatively few opportunities for the federation, through Plant, to obtain improvements significantly in advance of the rest of the civil service and he directed much of his energies and abilities into broader areas of trade union and related activities.<br>
<br>Plant was a member of the Trades Union Congress general council from 1964 to 1976 and served on its economic and international committees. His expertise on fiscal and economic subjects gave him far greater authority and respect than usual for someone from such a small union, and this was buttressed by his willingness to offer his colleagues good advice on income tax matters and frequent tips, some good and some less good, on horse-racing, which was a passionate interest of his. He was chairman of the TUC in 1975&#150;6. He also fulfilled many TUC duties, including membership of public bodies such as the Community Relations Commission (1974&#150;7), the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (1975&#150;8), and the departmental committee of inquiry into police pay chaired by Lord Edmund-Davies (1977&#150;8). After retirement in 1977 he became parliamentary adviser to the Police Federation and assiduously defended its interests in the House of Lords. A police band played at his funeral.<br>
<br>Plant was active at International Labour Office (ILO) conferences from 1965 onwards, and the ILO gave him a major platform to press for the development of trade union rights and improvements in working conditions, particularly of public service employees, throughout the world. He was a member of the governing body of the ILO from 1969 to 1977. He played a powerful role in the programme, financial, and administrative committee, a body which exerted great authority over finance and allocation of resources during the difficult period when the USA withdrew membership and subscriptions. In the international context Plant displayed the many virtues of British trade union leaders in international settings. He grasped the importance of obtaining agreement and consensus from delegates, and his mastery of the complexities of procedural provisions allowed him to produce solutions that were acceptable to all. He spoke with eloquence, wit, and authority, earning respect from employers and government delegates alike.<br>
<br>Plant had a deep commitment to further education and was treasurer of the Workers' Educational Association from 1969 to 1981. He was a member of the governing body of Ruskin College, Oxford, and chairman of the governors from 1967 to 1979, helping to raise funds for one of the new buildings, which was named after him.<br>
<br>Plant's interest in the Post Office and Civil Service Sanatorium Society began with his first job, and he was chairman of the committee of management from 1950 to 1975. It was his initiative which led to the queen mother becoming patron of the society, and under his guidance it developed into a large vocational health service, with a hospital not only to provide treatment for its members but also to encourage research. When Plant was made a life peer in 1978 he gave Benenden, the location of the hospital, as that of his title. This was the greatest of Plant's non-professional interests. He was appointed OBE in 1965 in recognition of his work for the society and CBE in 1975.<br>
<br>Plant was a firm believer in the virtues of the British civil service, with its concepts of duty and responsibilities, combined with a total commitment to the benefits of strong independent trade unions to protect the rights of public service employees. At the ILO he spoke in defence of the interests of the ILO employees and in particular sought to protect their pension rights.<br>
<br>Plant was a large, well-built man, 6 feet 1 inch tall, and broad shouldered. In 1931 he married Gladys Sampson, daughter of Sampson Mayers, textile manufacturer. They had two sons and one daughter. Plant died from a burst aorta in hospital in Tours, France, on 9 August 1986, while on holiday with his wife.<br>
