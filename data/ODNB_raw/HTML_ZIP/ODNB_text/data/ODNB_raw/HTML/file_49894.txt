</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Maxwell,  (Ian) Robert</span>  (1923&#150;1991), <span class="occ">publisher and swindler</span>, was born on 10 June 1923 in Synagogue Street, Slatinske Doly (Szlatina), a village in Czechoslovakia on a disputed frontier with Romania. He was one of seven children of Mehel Hoch (1887&#150;1942?), agricultural labourer, and Chanca (<i>d</i>. 1942?), daughter of Yankel Shlomowitz and also an agricultural labourer. His mother, father, grandfather, and three youngest siblings died at Auschwitz. Originally he was named Abraham Lajbi (in Yiddish Leiby) Hoch and later Jan Ludvik Hoch. After attending a Jewish village school he had a strict religious education in the <i>yeshiva</i> (Jewish school) at Sighet and at the Pressburger Yeshiva, Bratislava. His mother wanted him to become a rabbi, but he had his sidelocks shorn, and set out to assert himself.<br>
<br>Hoch joined the Czech army in France in 1940 before escaping to England, where in 1941 he volunteered for the Pioneer Corps. After two years he became a private in the North Staffordshire regiment, where his linguistic fluency resulted in his recruitment to the intelligence section. Using the name Leslie Ivan du Maurier (the surname derived from his favourite brand of cigarette), he participated in the Normandy landings of 1944 as a sniper sergeant and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. During 1945 he received the Military Cross and was promoted to captain. After the collapse of the Third Reich he was a member of the branch of the Allied Control Commission in Berlin responsible for licensing films, plays, books, and newspapers (1945&#150;7). Under military instructions he changed his surname from du Maurier to Jones in 1944, and then (apparently for military reasons) Leslie Jones in 1945 was renamed Ian Robert Maxwell. This was the name under which he was naturalized as a British subject in June 1946. Some of his enemies suspected that he began a working relationship with the KGB shortly afterwards.<br>
<br>On 14 March 1945 in Paris Maxwell married Elisabeth (1921&#150;2013), daughter of Paul Louis Meynard, a silk mill owner who had lost his fortune. This tempestuous marriage produced four sons, five daughters, and two miscarriages. The eldest son was injured in a motoring accident at the age of fifteen in 1961 and remained in a coma in an Oxford hospital for seven years. After Maxwell agreed with a neurologist that there should be no active attempts to prolong the boy's life, Michael Maxwell died in 1968. This tragedy aside, Maxwell was a domineering, intensively possessive, and demanding parent who humiliated his children and made their home life almost unbearable. Requiring unconditional surrender from all his dependants, he relished shows of magnanimity after blistering rows. During a marital crisis of 1980&#150;81 his wife described him as &#145;harsh, cruel, uncompromising, dictatorial, exceedingly selfish and inconsiderate, totally unaware of the feelings of others, least of all those who are loyal and devoted to you, those you take a sadistic pleasure in crushing and humiliating&#146;  (Maxwell, 450). Intermittently, for over thirty years, he had affairs, and he and his wife separated in 1990.<h2>
<a name="Earlybusinesslife"></a>Early business life</h2>Maxwell in 1947 formed the grandiosely titled European Periodicals, Publicity and Advertising Corporation. Initially this imported German newspapers for sale to prisoners of war in Britain, but he foresaw the international demand for German scientific, medical, and technical works and obtained world distribution rights from Germany's leading scientific publisher, Ferdinand Springer. He wrote in 1949 that he had entered the &#145;business world without money, friends or knowledge. In this jungle the law since eternity has been &#147;catch as catch can&#148;, no holds are barred and only the fittest can survive&#146;  (Maxwell, 201). His sharp practice resulted in a crisis with Springer in 1951. Shortly afterwards he founded Pergamon Press, to which however he gave little attention for four years because in 1951, with characteristic financial legerdemain, he acquired control of the leading British book wholesale warehouse, Simpkin Marshall. He threw his energies and overbearing character into the business. From the outset his accounting procedures were irregular, and the company made large interest-free loans to other Maxwell companies. It entered liquidation in 1955 owing &pound;656,000.<br>
<br>It has been alleged that in 1948 MI6 agreed to finance Maxwell's business as a cover for spying on Soviet bloc countries; certainly he travelled extensively in eastern Europe and later in the Far East, and mastered nine languages. His incessant travels during the 1950s often had serendipitous consequences. Indeed throughout his life he had chance meetings with interesting people, who introduced him to other valuable contacts:<blockquote>Bob built up an amazing circle of acquaintances, purely on this kind of chain reaction &hellip; he had a prodigious memory, which served him well until the latter years of his life. He would remember names, faces, the most minute details of a conversation, and he possessed [an] amazing store of data gleaned from his constant reading or talks with people. (Maxwell, 245)</blockquote>After the Simpkin Marshall d&eacute;b&acirc;cle Maxwell concentrated on Pergamon. His survival of an operation for lung cancer in 1955 increased his craving for conquest. Pergamon launched a succession of high-priced specialist scientific periodicals, to which academics were eager to contribute without remuneration, and published expensive scientific books whose authors were underpaid. He cultivated scientific contacts in the Soviet Union and in Warsaw pact countries, where his status was enhanced by Pergamon's willingness to publish sycophantic biographies of the more obnoxious dictators. Maxwell's initiatives proved a catalyst for international scientific communication and earned the grateful admiration of Sir Robert Robinson, Patrick Blackett, and other scientists. He read or scanned all Pergamon journals and books and always tried to learn from his scientific editors. The intricacies of much scientific research were beyond him, but he strove to understand the purposes and potential benefits of the work described in his publications. Although Maxwell latterly was an overbearing conversationalist, in the twenty years after 1945 his intense curiosity could seem charming. &#145;Bob still had everything to learn&#151;and he knew it&#146;, according to his wife. &#145;If he met someone working in a field he was unfamiliar with, he would not make ordinary conversation, but would literally interrogate that person, who was generally flattered.&#146; She considered that the 1950s were formative:<blockquote>his thirst for knowledge and his ability to use and apply it were exciting to watch. In those days, he could be enormous fun to be with; his enthusiasm for life seemed to know no bounds. You never knew what to expect next from his inventive mind. (Maxwell, 246&#150;7)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Parliamentarycareer"></a>Parliamentary career</h2>Maxwell was Labour's unsuccessful parliamentary candidate for Buckingham in 1959. He chaired the Labour Party's national fund-raising foundation (1960&#150;69) and its working party on science, government, and industry. Richard Crossman described him in 1963: &#145;a very strange fellow&#151;a Czech Jew with a perfect knowledge of Russian, who has an infamous reputation in the publishing world as the creator of the Pergamon Press&#146;. His scientific advice and liaison with important scientists had unexpectedly proved &#145;helpful, constructive and sensible&#146;  (<span class="italic">Backbench Diaries</span>, 1017). In 1964 Maxwell was elected for Buckingham. He made his maiden speech in the Commons within a few hours of taking his seat and thereafter was a frequent and strenuous speaker, especially on scientific topics. Other parliamentarians felt that he tried too hard to impress; his booming voice could seem painfully brash. &#145;A thrusting man who regards the House of Commons as a place where he can push himself&#146;, Tony Benn noted in 1965. &#145;The big struggle with Maxwell is whether you allow him to use you&#146;  (Benn, 294, 332).<br>
<br>Crossman in 1967 induced Maxwell to chair the Commons kitchen committee on the basis that if he succeeded, Wilson would be convinced that he could run a government department. Despite a scandal over the sale of wine, Maxwell was reckoned a success and sought his reward of ministerial office, but no cabinet minister wanted him as a junior minister. His ambition spurred him towards becoming a newspaper proprietor. He was foiled in his attempt in 1964 to buy two Labour-supporting newspapers, the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span> and <span class="italic">Sunday Citizen</span>, and in 1968 his offer to buy 25 per cent of the shares in the <span class="italic">News of the World</span> was rebuffed. Both in 1968 and when he tried to buy <span class="italic">The Sun</span> in 1969 he was outmanoeuvred by Rupert Murdoch. When in 1968 five secretaries from Surbiton vowed to work unpaid for an extra half-hour daily to help Britain, Maxwell bustled into fronting a patriotic, populist &#145;I'm backing Britain&#146; campaign. &#145;What a miraculous man&#146;, Crossman reflected at this time. &#145;However much people hate him, laugh at him, boo him and call him a vulgarian, he gets things done&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries of a Cabinet Minister</span>, 2.661).<h2>
<a name="Businesscontroversyandrecovery"></a>Business controversy and recovery</h2>By 1964, when Pergamon was floated on the stock exchange for over &pound;4 million, it was publishing 600 books annually and 70 journals. During the 1950s Maxwell began forming tax-free trusts, <i>Stiftungen</i>, and anonymous foundations, <i>Anstalten</i>, in the principality of Liechtenstein. These had such names as Allandra, Baccano, Corry, Hesto, Jungo, and Kiaro; he used them to buy Pergamon's books and periodicals, to increase its apparent profits. In 1969 he agreed to a &pound;25 million take-over of Pergamon by an American company, Leasco, which withdrew its bid on discovering that he had inflated Pergamon's profit figures by transactions with his private companies and by exaggerating its encyclopaedia sales. Maxwell had also secretly supported Pergamon's share price. In the ensuing uproar he was ousted from Pergamon's board by institutional investors and Leasco.<br>
<br>Two inspectors from the Department of Trade and Industry who investigated Maxwell's business affairs concluded in a report published in 1971 that he was &#145;not &hellip; a person who can be relied on to exercise proper stewardship of a publicly-quoted company&#146;  (Bower, <span class="italic">Maxwell the Outsider</span>, 222). This famous phrase was coined by the accountant Sir Ronald Leach, who privately called Maxwell &#145;a wall of fat always suing us&#146;  (Bower, <span class="italic">Tiny Rowland</span>, 203). Leach understood Maxwell perfectly: &#145;It was his capacity to regard the world as his own, which we thought extremely dangerous&#146;  (Greenslade, 325). Two further damning reports on the encyclopaedia business and Maxwell's private companies appeared in 1972&#150;3. The trade and industry inspectors hesitated to accuse Maxwell of criminality, and the police failed to prosecute him for fraud. He was, however, defeated in the three general elections of 1970 and 1974, and abandoned his parliamentary ambitions.<br>
<br>In 1974 Maxwell bought back Pergamon for about &pound;1.5 million and kept it as a private company. It prospered, but he hankered for a return to national prominence. In 1975 he enjoyed assuming the role of saviour of the <span class="italic">Scottish Daily News</span>, a Glasgow newspaper being run by an employees' co-operative; but the experiment ended bitterly with insolvency after six months. A dawn raid in July 1980 gave Maxwell a 29 per cent stake in the British Printing Corporation at a cost of &pound;2.9 million, and he forced his way to the post of chief executive in February 1981. Soon he was chairman too, armed with exceptional powers. Maxwell's ostracism by City institutions diminished after his brutal but successful reorganization of the company, including new union agreements and investment in new machinery. The British Printing Corporation was renamed the Maxwell Communications Corporation (MCC) in 1987.<br>
<br>Pergamon in 1984 bought Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) for &pound;90 million, and Maxwell installed himself as chairman. He thus controlled Britain's only remaining Labour-supporting newspapers, the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, <span class="italic">Sunday Mirror</span>, and <span class="italic">The People</span>. He cut the printing staff by one-third and began breaking the unions' grip on newspaper publishing. However, Maxwell swiftly compromised the editorial integrity of the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, which was the second highest selling newspaper in Britain. One million readers were lost, partly because the newspaper was used for his self-publicity. His name, photograph, and pontificating were too prominent in its pages, and he meddled constantly in its production and contents. His newspapers had diminishing political influence, partly because his political outlook was so egocentric, haphazard, and crude.<br>
<br>This longing for celebrity was also evident in Maxwell's sporting ventures. In 1981 he invested &pound;128,000 in Oxford United Football Club and became chairman. His plan to merge Oxford with Reading Football Club, and thus form a new club&#151;Thames Valley Royals&#151;was defeated. Having failed to buy a controlling interest in Manchester United Football Club in 1984, he paid &pound;300,000 for the debt-ridden Derby County Football Club, of which he became chairman in 1987. He had several clashes with the Football League, and he sold his interest in Derby in 1991. During 1986 Maxwell intervened to save the finances of the Commonwealth athletic games being staged in Edinburgh. His meddling brought publicity for MGN and for its publisher, but the millions he promised were never paid. Similarly his donations for AIDS research, the alleviation of Ethiopian starvation, the Gorbachov&#150;Maxwell Institute in Minneapolis, and Balkan industrial renewal were announced with portentous publicity but were never delivered.<h2>
<a name="Deterioratingbehaviour"></a>Deteriorating behaviour</h2>Maxwell was increasingly aggressive and uncontrollable from 1986. During that year he launched a glossy illustrated magazine, <span class="italic">Sportsweek</span> (which closed after five months with losses of &pound;2 million), and bought the Philip Hill Investment Trust, from which he reaped &pound;76 million by selling its components. In 1987 he launched the <span class="italic">London Daily News</span>, which was planned as the city's second evening newspaper but was abruptly relaunched by Maxwell (without consulting its editor) as Britain's first twenty-four-hour newspaper. His interventions in the printing, distribution, and strategy of the newspaper resulted in losses of about &pound;50 million in its brief career (February&#150;July 1987). He also tried to buy the newspaper <span class="italic">Today</span> from Tiny Rowland in 1987, but as a result of his indiscretions Rupert Murdoch again outmanoeuvred him. Maxwell's obsession with excelling Murdoch as a media tycoon became more obtrusive than ever. Also in 1987 he bought a French news agency, Agence Centrale de Presse, borrowed 750 million francs to buy a 12.5 per cent share in France's leading television channel, and was defeated in a hostile bid worth almost $2 billion for the American educational publisher and theme-park proprietor Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. During 1988, on a handshake deal with an Italian whom he met at a funeral, he paid &pound;60 million to buy 84 per cent of the football-stickers and football-album group Panini, which further depleted his finances. He bought a 30 per cent stake in Scitex, an Israeli electronic scanning equipment manufacturer, and invested in another Israeli company, Teva Pharmaceuticals.<br>
<br>Maxwell wasted millions on failed projects, litigation, and sumptuous living expenses, but his downfall began with MCC's purchase of the American publishing house Macmillan (which controlled 56 per cent of the shares in the Berlitz language schools) for the exorbitant price of $2.6 billion in 1988. MCC also paid $750 million in 1988 for Official Airline Guides. Maxwell negotiated huge loans from forty-four banks eager for his business, but was soon hit by high interest rates. From 1986, when his private companies pledged 115 million MCC shares as collateral for loans, he was servicing or paying off his debts by mortgaging MCC shares (a financial device called &#145;pig on pork&#146;). The banks required that if the MCC share price fell below a stipulated level, more shares had to be transferred as additional guarantees safeguarding the value of the loan. Maxwell's Liechtenstein <i>Stiftungen</i> owned the majority of MCC shares. Some 400 of his private companies of varying sizes traded with one another and with MCC in publishing, communications, printing, technology, property, currencies, gilts, and shares. He used these companies to move assets, shares, cash, and debts regardless of regulations or laws so that MCC could claim huge profits in its sumptuous brochures. To maintain the MCC share price, and thus avoid transferring more MCC shares under &#145;pig on pork&#146; arrangements, he paid excessive dividends to shareholders. The profits from trading were &pound;97.3 million in 1989, but the dividend cost &pound;112.3 million. The cost of maintaining this charade included &pound;17.6 million in advance corporation tax. On adjusted trading profits of &pound;71.1 million in 1990 the extraneous tax cost was &pound;98.8 million.<br>
<br>Additionally, from 1988 Maxwell set up twelve companies with London and Bishopsgate in their titles, operating from the same premises but with different activities, and thus well calculated to confuse outsiders. In 1989 London and Bishopsgate Investments began elaborate, systematic misuse of funds and fraudulent share transactions, particularly involving First Tokyo Trust. Maxwell's private company Bishopsgate Investment Trust managed nine pension funds for his 23,400 employees. These funds were siphoned to support the Maxwell businesses. He took &pound;1.5 million from MCC's pension fund in 1986 and &pound;9 million in 1987.<br>
<br>Woodrow Wyatt recorded the mistrust felt by other newspaper proprietors of Maxwell. Murdoch in 1987 predicted, &#145;one day Maxwell will go bust in a spectacular manner&#146;  (Wyatt, 1.375). Conrad Black told Wyatt that Maxwell was an impossible business partner because &#145;he was so dishonest and devious and wriggled out of things and gave you false information&#146;  (ibid., 2.475&#150;6). Despite such perceptions, bankers continued to lend Maxwell large amounts of money. By the summer of 1990 the scale of his debts and the impossibility of servicing them made ruin inevitable. He engaged during the last fifteen months of his life in dedicated criminality. He fraudulently supported MCC's share price through the Liechtenstein <i>Stiftungen</i> and with money stolen from his employees' pension funds. In November 1990 he transferred Berlitz shares worth over $200 million from the legal ownership to his Bishopsgate Investment Trust. He began drinking heavily; his infallible memory for financial detail began to falter. Constant jet travel, meetings, and deceit were physically breaking him. Pergamon's sale for &pound;440 million in 1991 did not solve the debt-crisis. Then, after some adroit financial manipulation, the flotation of MGN was prepared in six hectic weeks, and in May 1991 he sold 49 per cent of MGN. However, with only a 51 per cent stake, his earnings from MGN were reduced, and he could no longer use its assets as collateral. During 1991 he forged documents to inflate the profits of MCC by &pound;37 million while his private companies' debts to MCC and MGN rose to over &pound;600 million. As the impending doom of his empire became evident, he became more destructive.<br>
<br>Having purloined from <span class="italic">Die Zeit</span> of Hamburg the project of a pan-European newspaper, Maxwell had in 1990 launched <span class="italic">The European</span> with himself as editor-in-chief. His arrangements for its printing and distribution were unnecessarily expensive and inefficient. Its launch cost perhaps &pound;50 million, and it lost &pound;1 million a week in its first year. Despite the strains on him, in March 1991 Maxwell, in return for payment of $65 million from its owners, took over the <span class="italic">New York Daily News</span>, which was suffering from a five-month strike, corrupt employment practices, rampant expenditure, and antiquated plant. American public adulation and proximity to President George Bush at a White House dinner aggravated his delusion that (in his own words) he was &#145;not just a hero, [but] a cult figure&#146;  (Greenslade, 224).<br>
<br>Meanwhile Swiss Bank had compiled a dossier on an unpaid debt of &pound;55.7 million that it warned would be given to the fraud squad on 5 November. The <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> simultaneously prepared a story estimating the Maxwell family's debts at &pound;2.2 billion. Maxwell died on 5 November 1991, disappearing from his yacht, <i>Lady Ghislaine</i>, while it was cruising off Gran Canaria. It is uncertain whether he accidentally fell overboard, deliberately killed himself (knowing that his crimes would imminently be discovered), or was murdered at the instigation of an associate hoping to stop the wrecking of his assets. The hypothesis that he was murdered by secret agents seems less tenable. Roy Greenslade, who had worked for him as editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, judged that &#145;Mr Maxwell took his own life while the balance of his mind was briefly undisturbed&#146;  (Greenslade, 351). Maxwell's corpse was retrieved from the Atlantic and was buried on 10 November on the Mount of Olives, Jerusalem.<h2>
<a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>The sycophantic tributes paid at Maxwell's death and the eulogies pronounced at the grave were soon discredited. His empire swiftly collapsed owing about &pound;2.7 billion; &pound;429 million had been stolen from employee pension funds. Banks that had taken security for loans in the form of shares lost over &pound;655 million. Maxwell's sons Ian and Kevin were subsequently arrested on criminal charges but acquitted after a gruelling trial.<br>
<br>Maxwell's resilience, which earned him the half-affectionate nickname the Bouncing Czech, was admirable. Yet despite his energy and bouts of ebullient charm, he aroused rancour for much of his career. This hostility partly derived from his litigious nature. Millions of pounds were spent on legal fees over the years. He threatened to issue writs and launched innumerable court actions; although these were often abandoned, they succeeded in their aim of intimidating his critics. He used the law to bludgeon his enemies into silence or stun creditors into pained compliance. During 1987&#150;8, when he sought to suppress Tom Bower's unauthorized biography, he commissioned a hagiography from Joe Haines trumpeting his benefactions to humankind and ordered its serialization in the <span class="italic">Sunday Mirror</span> and <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>.<br>
<br>Maxwell was as ruthless and keen as any self-made businessman of his stature; but there was a flamboyant excess which was already disruptive by the 1960s, and he reacted to the stresses that accumulated from the 1980s with dictatorial behaviour that accelerated his destructive effects. In this latter period his lavatory hygiene, foul language, and table manners became increasingly primitive. Throughout, his egotism was unashamed: the bowl-sized cup from which he drank at his office was marked &#145;I'M A VERY IMPORTANT PERSON&#146;. As an employer, particularly in the final decade of his life, he allowed his verbal brutality and physical presence to terrorize many of his staff. He required servility from them, and became obsessed with loyalty, secrecy, and security. He reverted to sentimental and self-serving declarations of Judaism after visiting Israel in 1985. He increasingly enjoyed his trips to Israel, where everyone who mattered to him treated him uncritically and even unctuously.<br>
<br>When young, Maxwell was dashingly handsome, but his features coarsened in middle age, and he became obese (ultimately weighing 22 stone). From the 1960s he was instantly recognizable, with dyed black hair, bushy eyebrows, paunch, and aggressively negligent clothes. His stentorian voice and almost pugilistic joviality attracted some and alienated others. His domestic arrangements were ostentatious and histrionic. He travelled between his homes, like a war-lord, by helicopter and assumed a monarchical pose during his incessant international journeys by private jet: his last Gulfstream cost $24 million and was codenamed VR-Bob (&#145;Very Rich Bob&#146;).<br>
