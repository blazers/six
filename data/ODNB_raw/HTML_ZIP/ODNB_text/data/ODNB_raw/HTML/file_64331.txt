<span class="headword">Dimond,  William Wyatt</span>  (<em>c.</em>1750&#150;1812), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was, according to James Winston, apprenticed as a chaser (an engraver of precious metals)  (Winston, section 1). Since Dimond was still alive when Winston's book was published, and likely to be interested in the author's record of his tour of provincial theatres, and did not contradict the claim, it can be accepted. Dimond's gentlemanliness and easy civility were widely acknowledged, fulsomely by Tate Wilkinson  (Wilkinson, 3.111, 197), and this is consistent with apprenticeship in so specialized a craft. Hogarth had served a similar apprenticeship some fifty years earlier, but Dimond, unlike Hogarth, was not content to observe actors. He was ambitious to be one. He made his first known appearance, anonymously as a &#145;Young Gentleman&#146;, at Drury Lane on 1 October 1772, in the part of Romeo. The prompter William Hopkins noted in his diary, &#145;He is very younge a Smart Figure good Voice and made a very tolerable first appearance he met with great applause&#146;  (Stone, 1660). In attendance at Drury Lane throughout that season, though, he acted on only five further nights. In Canterbury for the summer season, he took a share in managerial responsibilities, but he returned to a subsidiary role in Garrick's Drury Lane company for the 1773&#150;4 season. His best opportunities came as Rovewell in Shadwell's <span class="italic">The Fair Quaker</span> and the Dauphin in <span class="italic">King John</span>. For his benefit on 7 May 1774 he shrewdly chose to play Florizel in Garrick's reduction of <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span> to <span class="italic">Florizel and Perdita</span>.<br>
<br>It may have been at Garrick's prompting that Dimond included the Theatre Royal, Bath, in his theatrical perambulations during the summer of 1774. He made his first appearance in the city with which he would be associated for over thirty years on 20 October 1774, inconspicuous in a minor role against John Henderson's towering Richard III. Bath's fashionable reputation was at its height, and the Orchard Street theatre was too small to profit from the crowds of visitors. By the time Dimond returned for the 1775&#150;6 season the managers had contrived to double its capacity. In Bath, moreover, he was able to play the leading roles he hankered for, particularly after Henderson's departure for London in 1777. For three important seasons, from 1779 to 1782, he played opposite Sarah Siddons: Jaffier to her Belvidera in Otway's <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>, Posthumus to her Imogen in <span class="italic">Cymbeline</span>, Bassanio to her Portia in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, and Lord Townly to her Lady Townly in Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Provoked Husband</span>. Dimond excelled in society comedies such as <span class="italic">The Provoked Husband</span>. They allowed him to indulge his extravagant taste in costume and to parade his graceful body before his indulgent patrons. Sheridan thought his Joseph Surface &#145;more consonant to his own ideas when he wrote the part, than anybody else&#146;  (Genest, 8.527). But Dimond was unwilling to abandon his tragic roles. He was still playing Romeo in 1790, when Wilkinson featured him during the week of the York races on 23 August, and his Hamlet was admired in both Bath and Bristol. In a measured review of his career, at a time when his retirement from acting was imminent, the <span class="italic">Bristol Journal</span> commended his good ear, sound judgement, and unmatched skill in genteel comedy, but feared that his performances in tragedy were too smooth, orderly, and correct: &#145;nothing is irregular, nothing is left to chance. &hellip; Hence it is, that if you have little to excite astonishment, you have a great deal to admire&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bristol Journal</span>, 28 June 1800).<br>
<br>By that time Dimond had long been settled in Bath, initially in Devonshire Buildings and later in Norfolk Crescent. He married Matilda Martha Baker (<i>d</i>. 1823), a Norfolk woman of independent wealth, on 2 December 1779, and their three known children were brought up and educated in Bath. The elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38624/', "William Dimond")</script>, became a prolific playwright of little quality and a theatrical manager of little more. Dimond's own opportunity to manage the Bath theatre arrived in 1786. John Palmer's interest in the postal service had caused him to relinquish the management to William Keasberry in 1785, and Dimond was sufficiently prosperous, perhaps with his wife's help, to purchase a share when, in the following year, he was invited to do so by Keasberry. Since 1779 the theatres royal in Bristol and Bath had been run jointly as a compact and self-sufficient &#145;circuit&#146;, already established as the most prolific producer of future London stars. As a manager Dimond proved uncommonly popular, not only with the directors, but also with the public and the company of players. Keasberry retired in 1795, and Charles Charlton was appointed assistant manager, with specific responsibilities to Bristol.<br>
<br>It was in Bristol that Dimond made his farewell performance, on 1 July 1801, as Edgar in Nahum Tate's version of <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, but continued in management until his death, having been granted a seventeen-year lease in 1799. His most visible achievement was the building of Bath's new Theatre Royal in Beaufort Square, the exterior of which remained largely unaltered two centuries later. It opened on 12 October 1805 with an undistinguished production of <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, but Dimond found no difficulty in attracting the stars of the London stage to appear in the magnificent playhouse. Mrs Siddons performed there on her final tour in 1811, following such luminaries as Mrs Jordan, G. F. Cooke, R. W. Elliston, Joseph Munden, Charles Kemble, and John Bannister. In the full promise of prosperity, Dimond suffered a stroke on 24 December 1811, and died at his home in Norfolk Crescent on 2 January 1812. He was buried in Bath Abbey on 10 January. His will bequeathed his property and theatrical interests to his widow, and it was through her that their son inherited the management of the Bath Theatre Royal. According to Belville Penley, the younger Dimond relinquished the management on his mother's death in June 1823  (Penley, 122).<br>
