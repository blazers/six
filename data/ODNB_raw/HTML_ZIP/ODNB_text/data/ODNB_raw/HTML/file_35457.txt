<span class="headword">Peile, Sir  James Braithwaite</span>  (1833&#150;1906), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, born at Liverpool on 27 April 1833, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21781/', "Thomas Williamson Peile (1806&#150;1882)")</script> and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1890), daughter of James Braithwaite. He was educated at Repton School, where his father was headmaster, winning a scholarship to Oriel College, Oxford, in 1852. In 1855 he received a first class in classics, and in the same year joined the Indian Civil Service.<br>
<br>Peile went out to India in 1856, beginning work in Bombay presidency as an assistant collector in the districts of Thana, Surat, and Ahmadabad. While in the latter two districts he mastered the Gujarati language, making good use of this skill in his subsequent career. He was in Ahmadabad during the revolt of 1857, and he described the events of the time in a graphic manner in private letters to friends, which were published in <span class="italic">The Times</span> on 3 December 1857. On 7 December 1859 he married, in Bombay, Louisa Elizabeth Bruce, daughter of General Sackville Hamilton Berkeley.<br>
<br>While in Ahmadabad district Peile became sympathetic to the problems of the <i>garasias</i> and <i>talukdars</i>, petty chiefs who had been granted landlord rights by the British. By the late 1850s they had fallen deep into debt to usurers, and the colonial civil courts were selling off their estates, often at very low prices, to repay these debts. Peile argued that if the British allowed this formerly warlike class to be ruined, they could cause difficulties in future. Largely as a result of his efforts, the <span class="roman">Ahmedabad Talukdars Relief Act</span> was passed in 1862, which enabled the state to take over and run badly indebted estates until the debts were paid off. Peile took an active role in implementing the legislation, in the process saving many of these landlords from destitution. As a class, however, they continued to be indebted, never becoming efficient estate managers. In April 1866 Peile was selected as commissioner for revising subordinate civil establishments throughout Bombay presidency, and then, during a wave of financial speculation, took an active part in compelling companies to furnish accounts. From 1869 to 1873 he served as director of public instruction in Bombay, being involved in extending primary education in the presidency. In 1872 he was appointed municipal commissioner of Bombay to sort out the financial problems of the city.<br>
<br>In 1873, and then from November 1874 to May 1878, Peile served as political agent in the peninsula of Kathiawar. This important agency covered 23,500 square miles, with a population of about 2&frac12; million. The territorial sovereignty was divided between the Maharaja Gaikwar of Baroda and about 200 chiefs, some of whom, notably Bhaunagar, Jamnagar, and Junagarh, had extensive territories, while others ruled little more than a single village. There was little co-ordinated policing of the region, and Peile persuaded the chiefs to co-operate more in maintaining order, putting forward a scheme for reforming the system of village police which had considerable success. He helped improve the railways and roads of the region and gave his full support to educational reforms. He took an active role in organizing relief during the famine of 1877. With his knowledge of Gujarati and feel for local conditions, Peile won the respect of the chiefs of Kathiawar. In later years he asserted the rights of these chiefs to retain their salt and opium revenues and he encouraged them to send representatives to Bombay to discuss their problems with him and others.<br>
<br>Peile served a few months in Sind in 1878, but declined the offer of the commissionership there. He was a member of the famine commission in 1878&#150;80, accompanying it on its tour of inquiry, and in the course of it was made CSI. In October 1879 he went to London to help in the writing of the famine report. From 1879 to 1882 he was secretary and acting chief secretary to the Bombay government. In December 1882 he became a member of council at Bombay and played a leading role in implementing Lord Ripon's policy of extending self-government at the provincial and local levels. Peile sought to dilute these reforms so as to prevent the emerging Indian middle class from gaining significant new powers. As a result of his insistence, considerable power in these bodies was retained in official hands. Peile was also active in educational affairs, being appointed vice-chancellor of Bombay University in 1864. In 1886 he was appointed to the supreme council by the new viceroy, Lord Dufferin.<br>
<br>In 1887 Peile left India on being nominated to the Council of India in London, and was made KCSI in 1888. He served for fifteen years, playing a very active role in the government of India. He became an advocate of greater devolution of power at provincial level, and sought to prevent Indian revenue being used too freely for overall imperial needs. He also objected to tariffs which discriminated against Indian cotton in favour of British cotton goods. Although he favoured a greater degree of Indianization of the civil service, he opposed the resolution of the House of Commons of 1893 for simultaneous examinations in Britain and India. He declined the offer of chairmanship of the second famine commission, but he served on the royal commission on the administration of the expenditure of India in 1895, and recorded the reservations with which he assented to their report of 1900. He retired from the Council of India in 1902 and died suddenly on 25 April 1906 at his home, 28 Campden House Court, Kensington, London. He was buried at the Kensington Hanwell cemetery, Ealing. He was survived by his wife, a daughter, and two sons, one of whom, James Hamilton Francis, was archdeacon of Warwick.<br>
