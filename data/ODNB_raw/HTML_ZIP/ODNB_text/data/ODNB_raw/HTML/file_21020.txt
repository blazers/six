<span class="headword">Owen,  Lewis</span> <span class="st"> [Lewis ab Owen]</span>  (1522?&#150;1555), <span class="occ">member of parliament and administrator</span>, of Plas-yn-dre, Dolgellau, Merioneth, was the son of Owen ap Hywel ap Llywelyn, of Llwyn, and claimed descent from Gwrgan ab Ithel, prince of Powys.<br>
<br>Owen was a representative of the new class of officials drawn from the ranks of the local gentry who after the <span class="roman">Acts of Union</span> of 1536&#150;43 replaced absentee sinecurists in positions of authority in the shires of the northern principality. In the reign of Henry VIII he was deputy chamberlain of north Wales and baron (justice) of the exchequer at Caernarfon. His rapid advancement was eased by his marriage to Margaret, daughter of John Puleston, constable of Caernarfon Castle and the first burgess of parliament to be returned for the town after the enfranchisement of Wales in 1536. He first served as deputy to Puleston as sheriff of Merioneth between 1534 and 1540, and in 1545&#150;6 and 1550 he was sheriff in his own right. He was an usher of the chamber by 1550, a post he may have owed to the patronage of either Edward Seymour, who as Baron Beauchamp held the chamberlainship of north Wales, or John Dudley as president of the council in the marches and chamberlain of the household. He was returned as knight of the shire for Merioneth to four of the five parliaments between 1547 and 1554.<br>
<br>Early in Edward VI's reign Owen acquired leases to extensive crown lands and former monastic property in Merioneth. Lands leased jointly with the Nannau family at Dolgellau, Trawsfynydd, and Nannau were later to be a bone of contention between the two families. He was twice married and his progeny was prolific: several of the later gentry families of the county, including those of Peniarth, Hengwrt, and even Nannau, were to trace their descent from &#145;Baron&#146; Owen and his first wife.<br>
<br>In 1536 Rowland Lee had cited the instability of Merioneth and Cardiganshire (&#145;for though they are shire ground they are as ill as the worst part of Wales&#146;) as an argument against the extension of the shire system into the marches and the appointment of Welshmen as justices of the peace. Sir John Wynn of Gwydir in his <span class="italic">History of the Gwydir Family</span> lists Mawddwy among the most notorious of the marcher lordships which acted as sanctuaries for criminals who until the <span class="roman">Acts of Union</span> were retained by the lords as &#145;very precious jewels&#146;  (Wynn, <span class="italic">The History of the Gwydir Family</span>, ed. J. G. Jones, 1990, 39&#150;40). Owen's zeal in implementing the new legislation incurred the wrath of the inhabitants, including the settled lesser landowners who resisted the changes. On 12 October 1555 he was ambushed and assassinated by a band of &#145;brigands&#146; in a mountain pass, Dugoed Mawddwy. The lordship of Mawddwy had been attached to Merioneth in the act of 1536 and had remained a haunt of thieves after the Union settlement. Owen's death was an act of revenge for the relentless campaign which he and his ally John Wyn ap Meredydd of Gwydir, the <i>custos</i> for Merioneth, had waged against the outlaws, eighty of whom had been hanged. Owen was on his way home to Dolgellau from Welshpool after attending the Michaelmas great sessions for Montgomeryshire, where he had arranged a marriage between his son and the daughter of Richard Mytton, lord of Mawddwy.<br>
<br>Of the records of the subsequent trials of the perpetrators, only the indictments of the accessories to the crime, who were tried at the great sessions held at Bala as late as September 1558, have been preserved. The accused are described as yeomen, not outlaws: the first named in the indictment, Gruffydd Wyn ap Dafydd, was a substantial landowner who held former monastic lands in Brithdir, and was therefore one of Lewis's neighbours. The episode testifies to the tensions among the landowners of the shire, not all of whom had benefited from the uniform introduction of English common law or the new opportunities for holding offices under the crown. They were competitors in the market for land released by the formal abolition of Welsh tenures and the dissolution of the monasteries.<br>
<br>The herald bard Gruffudd Hiraethog, the most distinguished of five poets who composed elegies to &#145;Baron&#146; Owen, depicted him as a martyr to the cause of the rule of law imposed as a consequence of the <span class="roman">Acts of Union</span>  (<span class="italic">Gwaith Gruffudd Hiraethog</span>, ed. D. J. Bowen, 1990, 226&#150;8). It is difficult to disentangle the actual events from the accretions of folklore, and the later accounts of the activities of the &#145;Gwylliaid Cochion&#146; (the red-haired brigands) written by the antiquary Robert Vaughan (<i>d</i>. 1667), who was descended from Owen, and by Thomas Pennant in <span class="italic">A Tour in Wales</span> (1778&#150;81) are not entirely free from these embellishments.<br>
<br>The theory that the yeomanry of Mawddwy were direct descendants of landowners who had resisted incursions on their terrain by the representatives of English law and order since the rebellion of Owain Glynd&#373;r remains highly speculative.<br>
