<span class="headword">Acton,  William John</span>  (1812/13&#150;1875), <span class="occ">surgeon specializing in genito-urinary disorders</span>, was baptized at Shillingstone, Dorset, on 12 May 1814, the second son of Edward Acton (1785/6&#150;1875), curate of the parish, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1788&#150;1817). He had two brothers, John (who also went into the church) and Henry, and at least one sister. Acton's early education is not known, but in 1830 he was under the care of Dr Mant, and in 1831 he became an articled pupil of Charles Wheeler, apothecary to St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. In 1836 Acton went to Paris, the European centre for this subject, to study venereology as an <i>externe</i> at the female venereal hospital under the famous American-born venereologist, Philippe Ricord, whom Acton was always to revere. In 1839 Acton became secretary of the Parisian medical society, but in 1840 he returned to London. He obtained membership of the College of Surgeons in the same year and set up as a consulting surgeon at 5 George Street, Hanover Square, London, publishing the first edition of <span class="italic">A Practical Treatise on Diseases of the Urinary and Generative Organs</span> in 1841. In 1842 he was elected to fellowship of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He moved to 46 Queen Anne Street, London, in 1843. At about that time he was appointed surgeon to the Islington Dispensary. Throughout the 1840s he contributed to the medical press and introduced a number of innovations in the treatment of venereal diseases.<br>
<br>By 1851 Acton was a successful consulting surgeon, residing at 46 Queen Anne Street with Robert Tubbs, a 47-year-old widower, magistrate for the cities of London and Westminster. On 6 March 1852 he married Sarah Jane Tabberer (<i>b</i>. 1821/2, <i>d</i>. 21 March 1875), daughter of Alexander Tabberer, a merchant, and moved to 17 Queen Anne Street. They had at least four children: William John (1853), Emma (1854), Gertrude Jane (1857), and Arthur Henry (1861). Acton's practice was apparently exclusively confined to the disorders of the urinary and generative organs. Although this area was often associated with unscrupulous and commercially minded quacks, Acton's reputation among his fellows was high. Sir James Paget, in a generous obituary tribute to the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society, claimed that Acton was &#145;careful and safe in practice, and had much technical skill&#146;  (Paget, 76). Paget attributed Acton's failure to inquire into outstanding questions of the pathology of syphilis to his devotion to the teachings of Ricord. Above all, Paget concluded,<blockquote>let it be remembered to his honour, that he practised honourably in the most dangerous of specialities; that he wrote decently on subjects not usually decent; and that he never used the opportunities which his practice offered for quackery or extortion &hellip; [He] was always clearly on the side of morality. (ibid.)</blockquote>Acton was not concerned only with technical aspects of the treatment of venereal diseases but with the wider social issues with which these diseases were intricately connected. During the 1850s he became increasingly involved in writing about and taking action on these wider questions. Besides publishing articles and letters to the press on venereal diseases in the army and navy, prostitution, and illegitimacy, he was active in the Society for the Suppression of Vice, and in prosecuting quacks under the <span class="roman">Medical Act</span> 1858. During the 1860s he was a great supporter of the regulation of prostitution through the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span> and an advocate for their extension from garrison and port towns to the general populace.<br>
<br>In 1857 Acton published the two works for which he is best remembered: <span class="italic">The functions and disorders of the reproductive orders in youth, in adult age, and in advanced life: considered in their physiological, social, and psychological relations</span> and <span class="italic">Prostitution, considered in its moral, social, and sanitary aspects, in London and other large cities: with proposals for the mitigation and prevention of its attendant evils</span>, both of which went into several editions. The latter book expanded his 1851 pamphlet on <span class="italic">Prostitution in Relation to Public Health</span>, previously a chapter in his <span class="italic">Practical Treatise</span> (1841). In <span class="italic">Prostitution</span> he addressed social problems and made recommendations for dealing with them, while <span class="italic">Functions and Disorders</span> addressed problems of the individual. There is a certain disjunction between the message of <span class="italic">Prostitution</span>&#151;that prostitution was ineradicable and regulatory measures were required to obviate its worst social effects&#151;and that of <span class="italic">Functions and Disorders</span>, which advocated, presumably with some expectation of the prescription being followed, a stringent degree of male continence both before and within marriage. Although this work contains Acton's most quoted statement, that &#145;the majority of women &hellip; are not very much troubled with sexual feeling of any kind&#146; and submitted to their husbands principally from the desire for maternity  (4th edn, 1865, 112&#150;13), it is addressed to, and almost exclusively about, the male. His views on prostitution are, several writers have commented, unusually realistic and humane for the period.<br>
<br>About 1862 Acton purchased Fern Acres, a country property in the parish of Fulmer, Buckinghamshire, where he subsequently spent much of his time in the enjoyment of farming and other country pursuits, while retaining his flourishing London practice. In 1875 he was subjected to the double blow of his father's death and his wife's dying from breast cancer. Acton was discovered dead in his bathroom at 17 Harley Street on 7 December, the cause being fatty degeneration of the heart. The officiousness of the coroner for central Middlesex in ordering an inquest was rebuked by the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span>, which pointed out that Acton had recently been examined by eminent physicians and that his death was quite consistent with their diagnoses.<br>
