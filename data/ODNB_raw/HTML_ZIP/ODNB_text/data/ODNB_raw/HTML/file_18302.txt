<span class="headword">Massie,  James William</span>  (1799&#150;1869), <span class="occ">missionary and abolitionist</span>, born in Ireland, was taught by Dr David Bogue, presumably at the missionary college at Gosport, Hampshire, and began his independent ministry as a missionary to India, where he lived and worked from 1822 until 1839. His <span class="italic">Continental India</span> was published in two volumes in 1840. At some point, Massie married; he and his wife had three children: a son, Milton, and two daughters, Elizabeth and Isabella. Massie then worked as a pastor in Perth, Dublin, and Salford, and travelled through Belgium, Switzerland, and Germany, before moving to London where he was secretary to the Home Missionary Society from 1848 to 1859.<br>
<br>Massie was an advocate of free trade and for the anti-slavery movement, and he was an ardent member of the union and emancipation societies that were formed during the American Civil War. He published <span class="italic">The American Crisis, in Relation to the Anti-Slavery Cause</span> (1862) and <span class="italic">America: the Origin of her Present Conflict: her Prospect for the Slave, and her Claim for Anti-Slavery Sympathy</span> (1864). Massie was a frequent visitor to America; his last trip was as a member of a deputation appointed to deliver the address adopted at the ministerial anti-slavery conference held in the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, on 3 June 1863. He was also often in Ireland for &#145;revival work&#146;, and he published <span class="italic">The Evangelical Alliance: its Origin and Development</span> (1847).<br>
<br>Before his death, Massie was granted the degrees of DD and LLD and was elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy. He died at 28 Adelaide Street, Kingstown, near Dublin, on 8 May 1869.<br>
