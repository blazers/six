<span class="headword">Butler <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Grey]</span>,  Josephine Elizabeth</span>  (1828&#150;1906), <span class="occ">social reformer and women's activist</span>, born on 13 April 1828 at Milfield Hill, Glendale, Northumberland, was the fourth daughter and seventh child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11550/', "John Grey (1785&#150;1868)")</script> and Hannah Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Annett (<i>d</i>. 1860). She was unusual among nineteenth-century feminists in having family ties to the whig aristocracy: Lord Grey, the whig prime minister during the passage of the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> of 1832, was her father's cousin. Except for two years at a school in Newcastle, Josephine was educated at home. As a young girl, she participated in county society events: she and her sister Harriet were belles at the hunt and county balls of Northumberland. Despite her gentry connections, Butler always distanced herself from fashionable society, preferring to identify herself as a member of the provincial middle classes. &#145;Democratic in all her instincts&#146;, she preferred the company of honest working men to members of the &#145;refined &#147;better&#148; classes&#146;: &#145;my sympathies are wholly with the non-privileged, even when they drop every &#147;h&#148;&#146;  (Bell, 105).<br>
<br>Beautiful and histrionic, meticulously dressed and coiffed, Butler was adored by men and women alike. A charismatic leader and gifted speaker, she could inspire intense personal loyalty among her co-workers. When Mary Priestman and her friend Mary Estlin went to hear Butler in Bristol in 1870, they waited &#145;amidst silence for the speaker&#146;. A few minutes later, the door opened and Butler entered, &#145;slight and graceful&#151;almost young &amp; very beautiful&#146;.<blockquote>As she moved to the table she raised her eyes with such a look of inexpressible sadness, as if the weight of the world's sin &amp; sorrows rested on her innocent head. A woman Christ to save us from our despair was the involuntary thought that came into my head &amp; has never left it. (Butler collection, n.d.)</blockquote>Men also responded to Butler's magnetic appeal. &#145;She bore the marks of a sad and terrible consecration&#146;, wrote Canon Henry Scott Holland. &#145;She had a magnetic influence over the spirit, and she laid on us the compulsion of a call to the service of the broken and wounded&#146;  (Fawcett, 442). Even men who disagreed with her responded to her personal charisma. After her testimony before the royal commission of 1871, one member of the committee, Peter Rylands, was moved to remark, &#145;I am not accustomed to religious phraseology, but I cannot give you an idea of the effect produced except by saying that the spirit of God was there&#146;  (Walkowitz, <span class="italic">Prostitution</span>, 114).<h2>
<a name="Familybackground"></a>Family background</h2>Butler credited her family with endowing her with a lifelong commitment to humanitarian reform, republican values, and vital Christianity. Religion was central to the Grey family life. From her mother, a descendant of Huguenot silk weavers, Josephine was imbued with a devout religiosity, free of any allegiance to a particular sect or creed. From her father, an agricultural reformer and anti-slavery advocate, she gained a love of justice and social compassion as well as a horror of slavery and arbitrary power. Along with republicanism, humanitarianism, and an abiding concern for individual liberty, Josephine also inherited her father's sense of national destiny, his evangelical belief that the English &#145;seem to be a people distinguished in the plan of Providence &hellip; to accomplish God's great designs upon the Earth&#146;  (J. Butler, <span class="italic">John Grey</span>, 27&#150;8).<br>
<br>By the time she was eighteen, Josephine Grey had suffered an intense religious crisis, precisely because she could not yet envisage those &#145;great designs&#146;. &#145;Haunted&#146; by stories of suffering and poverty, she sought answers to her &#145;soul's trouble&#146; and a solution to its &#145;dark questioning&#146;  (Caine, 162, 163). Josephine Grey resolved this religious doubt through a conversion that left her with a mystical sense of calling, and a fervent belief in the efficacy of prayer and in her power to communicate directly with God. Her sense of divine mission, formed in her youth and ultimately finding its political cause two decades later, made her, in the words of one commentator, &#145;constitutionally unable to separate theory from practice&#146;  (Uglow, 149). For her, Christian understanding implied action, whether it be at the level of personal philanthropy or national political agitation. Like a number of other Christian feminists, Butler endeavoured to implement a feminist political theology that would erode divisions between a secular public and a privatized spirituality. In her later political campaigns, she presented herself as a spiritual campaigner empowered by God to fight injustice: she &#145;had often thought of this saying that God and one woman make a majority&#146;  (ibid., 151).<br>
<br>Besides her mother, two other female relatives were important influences in Josephine's life. Her aunt, Margaretta Grey, was a strong-minded feminist in the Enlightenment tradition. She also formed strong attachments with all her sisters, but particularly with her sister Harriet, who later married a Swiss banker and settled in Naples. Through her father, sister, and future husband, she subsequently gained an entr&eacute;e into republican circles throughout western Europe.<h2>
<a name="MarriageandOxford"></a>Marriage and Oxford</h2>In 1852 Josephine Grey married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4184/', "George Butler (1819&#150;1890)")</script>, a university teacher and Anglican clergyman. They both shared a broad Christianity, a cultural attachment to Italy, as well as a strong commitment to liberal reforms. George Butler encouraged his wife in her public work, and he would suffer set-backs in his own career on account of his wife's notoriety. Although she became the leader of a campaign widely characterized as the &#145;revolt of the women&#146;, Butler gave special credit to the support of her husband and sons: &#145;It seems strange that I should have been engaged in taking up the cudgel against men when my father, brothers, and sons have all been so good&#146;  (Walkowitz, <span class="italic">Prostitution</span>, 121).<br>
<br>The Butlers first lived in Oxford, where George Butler was appointed examiner to the university and where their three sons were born. Josephine Butler remembered the Oxford of the 1850s as a narrow and misogynist community of celibate men, &#145;with little or no leaven of family life&#146;, women's colleges, and domestic sociability  (Caine, 165). As a young wife, Josephine Butler was deeply offended by the open acceptance of the double standard by the gentlemen of the university. She listened in silent anger to the denunciation of Mrs Gaskell's <span class="italic">Ruth</span> (a novel in which the heroine is seduced and abandoned) by the masculine company who assembled at her home in the evenings.<blockquote>A moral sin in a woman was spoken of as immensely worse than in a man; there was no comparison to be found between them. A pure woman, it was reiterated, should be absolutely ignorant of a certain class of ills in the world, albeit those evils bore with murderous cruelty on other women.</blockquote>Inwardly furious at the audacity and arrogance of one young man who &#145;seriously declared that he would not allow his own mother to read such a book&#146;, she &#145;resolved to hold [her] peace&#146;, and to speak &#145;little with men, but much with God&#146;  (Walkowitz, <span class="italic">Prostitution</span>, 87, 88). With the support of her husband, she began to seek out &#145;ruined&#146; women and welcome them into her home. Her rescue work extended to one young mother, seduced and abandoned by an Oxford don, who was in Newgate for the murder of her baby.<h2>
<a name="CheltenhamandLiverpool"></a>Cheltenham and Liverpool</h2>The Butlers' stay in Oxford was cut short by Josephine Butler's respiratory illness; a lesion on her lung had been diagnosed when she was eighteen, and the Butlers were now warned that the climate of Oxford might be fatal to her health. Josephine would suffer physical and nervous breakdowns of this sort throughout her long life. To escape the Oxford damp, George Butler accepted the post of vice-principal at Cheltenham College in 1857. Their daughter Eva was born in Cheltenham. In these new surroundings, they continued to take a lively interest in international liberal causes. Although their support for Garibaldi was well received, their support for the cause of American abolition was not. When the American Civil War broke out in 1861 the Butlers, who supported the Union cause, found themselves socially ostracized. This was Mrs Butler's first experience of political support for an unpopular cause: &#145;The feeling of isolation &hellip; was often painful &hellip; but the discipline was useful&#146;  (Petrie, 44).<br>
<br>The accidental death of her daughter Eva in 1864 was a &#145;turning point&#146; in Josephine Butler's life. When the Butlers moved to Liverpool in 1864, she &#145;became possessed with an irresistible urge to go forth and find some pain keener than my own, to meet with people more unhappy than myself&#146;  (Walkowitz, <span class="italic">Prostitution</span>, 116). &#145;It was not difficult to find misery in Liverpool&#146;, she wrote of her early social work there  (ibid.). In 1866 she began to work among the women of the Liverpool workhouse in the &#145;oakum shed&#146;, a women's vagrant ward and bridewell. Here she practised her transformative skills on the &#145;wretched, draggled, ignorant outcasts of the casual ward, persuading them to fall down on their knees and pray to Jesus&#146;  (Walkowitz, <span class="italic">City</span>, 88).<br>
<br>From the workhouse, gaols, and streets of Liverpool, Mrs Butler brought poor &#145;ruined&#146; young women, friendless, all physically worn out from their hard lives, to be nursed by her in her home. Her widowed sister helped her in this &#145;work without a name that came upon us&#146;  (Walkowitz, <span class="italic">Prostitution</span>, 116). She had the help of Mrs Cropper, a Quaker and a pioneer &#145;in the advocacy and practice of the modern methods of kindness in rescue work&#146;, who had recently established a family &#145;home&#146; in Liverpool  (ibid.). A few months later, with financial support from a number of Liverpool merchants, she established a small envelope factory as an industrial home for friendless girls.<h2>
<a name="Feminism"></a>Feminism</h2>During the late 1860s Butler became increasingly involved in the campaign for women's rights. She was one of the signatories of the petition for women's suffrage presented to parliament by John Stuart Mill in 1866. From 1867 to 1873 she served as president of the North of England Council for Promoting the Higher Education of Women. In 1868 she petitioned Cambridge to provide special examinations for women. She also joined the Married Women's Property Committee in 1868, remaining on the committee until the passage of the <span class="roman">Married Women's Property Act</span> of 1882. In 1868 she published her first pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Education and Employment of Women</span>, the first of ninety books and pamphlets she would publish over the next forty years, in which she pleaded for the higher education of women and the removal of legal and customary restrictions on their employment. &#145;Economics&#146;, she wrote, &#145;lie at the very root of practical morality&#146;  (Caine, 179).<br>
<br>In 1869 Josephine Butler edited a collection of essays entitled <span class="italic">Woman's Work and Woman's Culture</span>. Her introduction to the volume constituted her most comprehensive, theoretical statement about the woman question. In this essay, she endeavoured to reconcile a series of beliefs and commitments, most notably liberalism and Christianity; sex equality and sexual difference; and an evolutionary theory of historical development and Christian eschatology. Butler's introduction also constituted her first public effort to integrate the discussion of prostitution and the double standard into a general discussion of the condition of women.<br>
<br>Butler's introduction to <span class="italic">Woman's Work and Woman's Culture</span> (1869) upholds a liberal ideal of companionate marriage and sex equality. It also details the detrimental effects of women's economic dependence on men and their need for public and meaningful work. Beginning on a conciliatory note, Butler explains that the essays in the volume would not exclusively treat &#145;women's questions&#146;, nor was the cause they advocated &#145;solely of women&#146;&#151;but also &#145;the cause of men&#146;  (<span class="italic">Woman's Work</span>, viii). She did not intend to &#145;reiterate any accusation&#146; against men of the present or past generations, or charge &#145;any living being with a conscious and wilful participation in any existing social wrong&#146;  (ibid., ix). Rather the &#145;evils in society&#146; that oppressed women were &#145;to a great measure&#146; the result of accident, and of the &#145;halting and unequal progress of society&#146;  (ibid.). Women were victims of a &#145;transitional&#146; period of industrialization, &#145;stranded&#146; by the elimination of many of their traditional employments while being prohibited from pursuing new opportunities  (ibid., xv).<br>
<br>A critique of male domination none the less seeps through. While writing her pamphlet on women's employment, Butler received a letter from the positivist Frederic Harrison defending restrictions on women's labour on the grounds that women's place was in the home. Butler's introduction to <span class="italic">Woman's Work and Woman's Culture</span> sets out to detail how wrong-headed, how &#145;Satanic&#146;, that radical position appeared to her. Quoting from the census, Butler documented the increasing number of women, outside of marriage, who had to work for &#145;starvation wages&#146;  (<span class="italic">Woman's Work</span>, xv). The closing off of occupations to women precipitated poor women &#145;downwards&#146; into prostitution and resulted in the &#145;destruction of bodies, of consciences, of souls&#146;&#151;a fate that had no analogue for men. Economic dependence on men also corrupted women of the better classes, forcing them into mercenary marriages and destroying their dignity &#145;in the scramble for husbands&#146;  (ibid., xxiii). This dignity could be restored by education and employment in useful public work.<br>
<br>Without challenging the importance of women's spiritual influence in the home, Butler called for the diffusion of the &#145;home influence&#146; in the general society. Like other feminists of her time, Butler only partially challenged orthodox Victorian assumptions about women's separate sphere. She defended the right of women to maintain legal, political, and economic identities outside the family, but she also sought to exploit the notion of women's moral pre-eminence. She celebrated the feminine form of philanthropy, &#145;the independent, individual ministering, the home influence&#146;, against the masculine form, &#145;the large comprehensive measure, the organization, the system planned by men and sanctioned by Parliament&#146;  (<span class="italic">Woman's Work</span>, xxix&#150;xxx). Butler thus tried to mark out a specific area of public activity for women of the better classes. This feminine form of philanthropy was, in her mind, the best method of stemming the decline in moral values among &#145;our vast population&#146; of the poor  (ibid., xxxvi).<br>
<br>Although she joined forces with secular liberals such as John Stuart Mill to defend women's rights, Butler tried to infuse her liberalism with the spiritual authority of &#145;essential Christianity&#146;. Like other Christian feminists, she looked to Christ's teachings as a model of sex equality, while also claiming a special spiritual relationship between women and their saviour. Not only were women among Christ's earliest followers, but their love for him &#145;exceeds the love which it is possible for any man to feel for Him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Woman's Work</span>, lx). Butler's effort to meld liberal feminism and Christianity generated significant tensions in her writings. However much the ethics of Christ seemed to validate liberal feminism, Christian eschatology, as Butler presented it, did not fit comfortably with liberal visions of progress. Butler ended her essay on a dark prophetic note that called into question the social efficacy of her applied Christianity. Struggling in the cause of &#145;suffering humanity&#146; might not succeed in rectifying social evils, but it might hasten the Second Coming&#151;&#145;the advent of the Day which we long for&#146;  (ibid., lxiv).<h2>
<a name="TheContagiousDiseasesActs"></a>The Contagious Diseases Acts</h2>In 1869 Butler was approached by Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy to serve as honorary secretary of the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts. The <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span> of 1864, 1866, and 1869 provided for the medical and police inspection of prostitutes in garrison towns and ports. Although the acts had been in force for a number of years, it was not until the late 1860s that public agitation against them mounted, in response to efforts to extend the acts to the north. One organization, the National Association, had already formed to demand the repeal of the acts, but the fledgeling repeal movement did not gain attention and notoriety until a &#145;Ladies' protest&#146; was published in the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, with 124 signatures of leading female members of the Society of Friends and of prominent feminists, including Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy, Florence Nightingale, Harriet Martineau, and Ursula Bright. This was soon followed by the formation of the Ladies National Association. Female participation in the repeal campaign astonished and perplexed the press and the British public, unused as they were to women speaking before mixed audiences on such matters as prostitution, venereal disease, and internal gynaecological examination.<br>
<br>Over the next sixteen years repeal groups proliferated, reflective of the regional, political sectarian, class, and gender distinctions in the movement. Overall, repeal drew its power from its alliance of middle-class nonconformists, radical working men, and middle-class feminists, who had previously engaged in a range of liberal mid-Victorian reforms, such as anti-slavery, temperance, medical reform, and women's suffrage. Butler operated as the charismatic leader of the campaign, leaving everyday details and political lobbying to others, notably to the male leaders of the campaign, such as James Stansfeld, Henry J. Wilson, and James Stuart. Using the Ladies National Association as her platform, Butler pushed liberal feminism in new directions, developing theories and methods of political agitation that would directly affect future campaigns for the emancipation of women. She sponsored new forms of feminist activism, expanding beyond drawing-room meetings to promote a range of out-of-door political activities. She also elaborated the concerns of women's rights to include a defence of female bodily integrity.<br>
<br>Butler repeatedly declared in public that she could never view the question of state regulation as &#145;fundamentally more a woman's question than it is a man's&#146;  (J. Butler, <span class="italic">The Constitution Violated</span>, 1871, 153). Yet, her &#145;revolt of the women&#146; was infused with a sense of sexual grievance. In her public writings, she tended to mute expressions of sex antagonism or to displace them onto working-class women. In one of her &#145;public letters&#146; on the &#145;Garrison Towns of Kent&#146;, for instance, she allowed a Chatham prostitute to deliver a powerful denunciation of men and male power, a denunciation that conveniently incorporated the entirety of Butler's brief against the acts:<blockquote>It is <i>men, only men</i>, from the first to the last that we have to do with! To please a man I did wrong at first, then I was flung about from man to man. Men police lay hands on us. By men we are examined, handled, doctored. In the hospital it is a man again who makes prayer and reads the <span class="roman">Bible</span> for us. We are had up before magistrates who are men, and we never get out of the hands of men till we die! (Walkowitz, <span class="italic">City</span>, 92)</blockquote>In private correspondence, Butler complained of the tendency of male leaders to dominate the movement and to shut out female initiatives, particularly when it came to policy matters and public appearances. Political differences led Butler to cultivate an inter-class alliance with working men and to identify a special mission for women in the repeal camp.<br>
<br>During the repeal campaign, Butler resorted to daring acts of personal heroism that showed her solidarity with her fallen sisters. Many of these performances occurred during parliamentary by-elections in the early 1870s, when repealers challenged Liberal Party candidates who supported the acts. In 1870 repealers successfully opposed the candidacy of Henry Storks in Colchester and were elated by his defeat. Butler's activities during the Colchester by-election substantially contributed to this victory. In her <span class="italic">Personal Reminiscences of a Great Crusade</span> (1896) she recalled how she was chased by a crowd of brothel-keepers and their flunkies in Colchester, forcing a Mrs Hampson and herself to seek refuge in the cellar of a &#145;Methodist&#146; grocer, who installed them &#145;amongst his bacon, soap, and candles&#146;  (J. Butler, <span class="italic">Personal Reminiscences</span>, 33). She later encountered the same kind of opposition in Pontefract, when repealers opposed the candidacy of a member of the government, H. C. E. Childers, who had offered himself for re-election. A women's meeting was held in a hayloft; hired bullies &#145;led by two persons whose <i>dress</i> was that of gentlemen&#146; set bundles of straw afire while the Metropolitan Police casually looked on. Fortunately, &#145;two or three working women placed themselves in front&#146; of Butler and Mrs Charlotte Wilson, so that they could make their escape by jumping down the hatch of a trapdoor.<blockquote>It was not so much personal violence that we feared as what would have been to any of us <i>worse than death</i>; for the indecencies of the men, their gestures and threats, were what I would not like to describe. (Walkowitz, <span class="italic">City</span>, 91)</blockquote>&#145;The people&#146;, Butler insisted, were &#145;more just, more manly, than those who rule them&#146;, a position she reiterated in <span class="italic">The Constitution Violated</span>, a pamphlet published in 1871 and &#145;Dedicated to the Working Men and Women of Great Britain&#146; (Walkowitz, <span class="italic">Prostitution</span>, 142; <span class="italic">Constitution Violated</span>). Butler condemned police power under the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span> as a violation of the rule of law and of the English constitution. She characterized supporters of the acts as latter-day embodiments of &#145;Old Corruption&#146;, as adherents of a &#145;deadly materialism&#146; that merely transferred &#145;the power of the deprivation of human rights from the hands of a monarch or hereditary aristocracy&#146; into those of &#145;official experts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Constitution Violated</span>, 206). At the same time, she situated the repeal campaign in a tradition of radical political protest, summoning up a range of earlier &#145;champions of liberty&#146; from Wat Tyler to John Wilkes, who had served as icons of the Chartist struggle  (ibid., 3, 4). Butler also condemned the unequal treatment of men and women under the acts, arguing that it was inhumane to regard fallen women as &#145;foul sewers&#146; rather than as &#145;moral agents&#146;. In framing the repeal campaign as a defence of the &#145;Ancient Constitution&#146; Butler incorporated women, even prostitutes, into the body politic, and she made the health and bodily integrity of women essential to the welfare of the nation at large.<h2>
<a name="CatherineofSiena"></a>Catherine of Siena</h2>Butler offers a different kind of historical justification for her own political activism in <span class="italic">Catherine of Siena</span>, published in 1878. In her biography of the fourteenth-century saint, Butler celebrated St Catherine as a pioneering example of a female activist and Christian mystic. Butler explained that she wished to link Catherine's &#145;spiritual life&#146; to her &#145;public action in connection with contemporary events&#146;  (<span class="italic">Catherine of Siena</span>, 2nd edn, 1879, vii). Not only did she personally identify with Catherine's struggle to carve out a public role for herself, she also represented the &#145;contemporary events&#146; of Catherine's day as harbingers of the political and social problems that beset Victorian Britain. Medieval Siena, despite its beauty and sunny clime, suffered from many of the maladies that plagued the Victorian body politic. These included epidemic disease, political factions, a falling away of old-fashioned virtues, a tyrannical democracy, and a corrupt church and government.<br>
<br>Having set the historical scene, Butler presents Catherine as a plebeian and medieval variant of herself. She introduces Catherine as a &#145;daughter of the people&#146;, descended from a &#145;race&#146; of stern, republican artisans, an untutored woman who ultimately became the trusted adviser to political and religious leaders. Called out of her solitude by God to devote herself to &#145;active ministrations&#146;, Catherine encountered many of the same forms of prejudice and slanders about her &#145;virtue&#146; that, many centuries later, were levelled at Butler  (<span class="italic">Catherine of Siena</span>, 1879, xii). Like Butler, Catherine overcame social resistance to her public activities, and she too went on to assume an ever widening circle of influence. Over time, Catherine extended her &#145;active ministrations&#146; from personal philanthropy among the poor to mediating between political factions in Siena and advising the pope. Catherine's physical martyrdom&#151;her &#145;spareness in diet&#146;&#151;served as another point of identification for Butler, as did Catherine's &#145;constant converse with God&#146;  (ibid., 32, 33, 38). According to Butler, Catherine cultivated a &#145;science of prayer&#146;, a practice that was &#145;experimental&#146; and &#145;methodical&#146;. There was nothing hysterical about Catherine's ecstasies and communions with God; they required &#145;sustained self-denial&#146; and &#145;untiring diligence&#146;  (ibid., 38, 39).<h2>
<a name="Europesocialpurityandempire"></a>Europe, social purity, and empire</h2>Besides celebrating a female tradition of Christian activism and prophecy, <span class="italic">Catherine of Siena</span> also signalled Butler's romance with contemporary Italy and her engagement with European affairs. In 1874, when the repeal campaign was politically stalled in Britain owing to the fall of Gladstone's Liberal government, Butler undertook a mission to the continent to spark abolitionist efforts there. &#145;God&#146;, Butler wrote in 1875, &#145;has been training us, not for our battles in England alone, but for this battle of principles all over Europe&#146;  (Butler, <span class="italic">Autobiographical Memoir</span>, 109). Butler's example inspired men and women in almost every European country, as well as the United States, to take up the question of state-regulated prostitution. Butler was the moving force behind the formation of the British, Continental and General Federation for the Abolition of Government Regulation of Prostitution, founded in 1875. Not all of her followers shared her libertarian views. Whereas Butler advocated self-restraint and rescue work among prostitutes as an alternative to state regulation or repression, members of the German Moral Associations condemned prostitution as a crime and demanded the prosecution of women involved in the trade.<br>
<br>More repressive modes of reform were also superseding repeal efforts at home. After the regulation system was suspended in England in 1883, Butler and her female allies shifted their attention to the foreign traffic in women and the entrapment of children into prostitution in London. They persuaded the journalist W. T. Stead to publish a sensational expos&eacute; of child prostitution, the &#145;Maiden tribute of modern Babylon&#146;, in the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> in 1885. &#145;Maiden tribute&#146; had an electrifying effect on public opinion and forced parliament to pass the <span class="roman">Criminal Law Amendment Act</span> of 1885, raising the age of consent for girls to sixteen and giving the police greater summary power to repress brothel-keepers and streetwalkers. An additional clause of the bill made indecent acts between consenting male adults illegal. Throughout Britain, grass-roots social purity groups were formed to oversee the local enforcement of this act. Purity groups soon turned their attention to the suppression of obscene books, birth control literature and advertisements for abortifacients, music-hall entertainment, and nude statuary.<br>
<br>Repeal leaders of all persuasions initially filled many of the committee positions of the National Vigilance Association, which oversaw many of these legal prosecutions. However, this collaboration was short-lived for Butler and for some of her libertarian friends. In 1897 she explicitly warned her workers to beware &#145;of &#147;Purity Societies&#148; which seek affiliation with our Society&#146; on the grounds that they persecuted individuals and that they were<blockquote>ready to accept and endorse any amount of coercive and degrading treatment of their fellow creatures, in the fatuous belief that you can oblige human beings to be moral by force, and in so doing that you may in some way promote social purity. (Walkowitz, <span class="italic">Prostitution</span>, 252)</blockquote>Her warnings were not heeded by many feminist leaders, including Millicent Fawcett, who remained actively engaged in the purity campaign throughout the first two decades of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>During the late 1880s and 1890s Butler's attention shifted to India. After the repeal of the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span> in Great Britain in 1886, Butler led the campaign to end the regulation of prostitution in India through the cantonment regulations. When her husband died at Winchester in 1890, she temporarily ceased public activities. She soon resumed her agitation on behalf of her &#145;suffering sisters in India&#146; by writing pamphlets about regulation in India, by contributing articles in repeal journals, and by corresponding with missionaries. Although she condemned the &#145;imperially imposed degradation&#146; of Indian women under cantonment regulations, she did not condemn British imperial rule <i>per se</i>  (J. Butler, <span class="italic">The New Godiva: a Dialogue</span>, 1888, 13). On the contrary, she stoutly defended British manifest destiny and enunciated for feminists a special imperial mission of representing female colonial subjects, akin to their special role in representing the interests and sufferings of poor women within the nation.<br>
<br>Although the &#145;new abolitionists&#146; applauded and supported Butler's efforts on behalf of her &#145;Indian sisters&#146;, they were deeply critical of her support for the British cause during the South African War. In <span class="italic">Native Races and the War</span> (1900) Butler defended the British empire against the criticism of our &#145;Continental friends&#146; who regard &#145;British Colonization&#146; as a &#145;series of acts of aggression, solely inspired by the love of conquest and desire for increased territory&#146;  (<span class="italic">Native Races</span>, 138, 139). Butler acknowledged the greedy ambition of Rhodes and Jameson, as well as the harsh treatment of &#145;natives&#146; by individual settlers, but she reiterated her conviction, that &#145;with all her faults, looked at from God's point of view, England is the best, and the <i>least</i> guilty of nations&#146;  (Burton, <span class="italic">Burdens</span>, 12). As an old abolitionist and daughter of an abolitionist, she proudly pointed to the fact that British law made slavery illegal, whereas the Boers accepted no such law. Great Britain, she predicted, &#145;will in future be judged condemned, or justified, according to her treatment of those innumerable, colored races, heathen or partly christianized, over whom her rule extends&#146;  (<span class="italic">Native Races</span>, 152).<br>
<br>After her husband's death Josephine Butler moved into a number of lodgings around the country. In 1903 she took up residence near her eldest son, George Grey Butler, at Wooler, Northumberland, where she died at her home, 2 Victoria Villas on 30 December 1906. She was buried at Kirknewton, Northumberland. Her three sons survived her.<h2>
<a name="HistoricalscholarshiponButler"></a>Historical scholarship on Butler</h2>A few full-length biographies of Josephine Butler have been written, but most historical studies have tended to concentrate on Butler's role in the repeal campaign. Historians have long acknowledged the campaign against the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span> as a critical event in the history of feminism, and they have credited Butler with playing an instrumental role in articulating a feminist position on prostitution and in gaining public support for the repeal cause. Since the 1970s, the work of social historians has offered a deeper and more contextualized account of Butler and the political mobilizations she spearheaded. McHugh and the present author have highlighted the campaign against the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span> as part of a network of influential middle-class nonconformist pressure groups in the mid-Victorian era, while the studies of Banks and Levine have successfully located Butler as a member of a generation of feminist friends and political collaborators. Historians influenced by Michel Foucault, such as Mort, Kent, and the present author, have stressed the importance of the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span> and their opposition as a massive mobilization over sexuality issues that not only reshaped gender, class, and sexual subjectivities in late Victorian Britain but also informed national political history and state-building.<br>
<br>Whereas the social histories of the 1970s and 1980s concentrated on Butler's participation in the repeal movement, later cultural histories have paid closer attention to her rhetoric and political thought in the overall body of her writings. Hadley and the present author have inquired into Butler's use of melodramatic narrative and performance, while Uglow, Caine, and Yeo have examined Butler's uneasy synthesis of liberalism and Christian feminism. In another direction, Burton has highlighted a set of allegiances left unexplored by earlier historians of repeal, notably Butler's investment in nationalism and British imperialism. This recent historical work not only highlights Butler as a distinguished exemplar of feminist humanitarianism, it also reveals the complex cross-currents of libertarianism and Christianity, ethnocentrism and internationalism, performance and politics at work in that humanitarian tradition.<br>
