</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Martineau,  Harriet</span>  (1802&#150;1876), <span class="occ">writer and journalist</span>, was born in Norwich on 12 June 1802, the sixth of eight children of Thomas Martineau (1764&#150;1826), a cloth manufacturer descended from an old Huguenot family, and his wife, Elizabeth (1770/71&#150;1848), the eldest daughter of Robert Rankin, a sugar refiner in Newcastle upon Tyne.<h2>
<a name="Themakingofawriter"></a>The making of a writer</h2>Thomas Martineau was a gentle, unassertive man; Elizabeth Martineau was a highly intelligent, largely self-educated woman of considerable force of character. Harriet Martineau's childhood was, according to her own account, a difficult one, marked by digestive and other physical disorders and by more than usual fears and isolation. She admits in her autobiography to having been a difficult child: the degree of blame she places on her mother for her unhappiness may have been unfair, but her younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18229/', "James Martineau (1805&#150;1900)")</script>, also noted (in his autobiographical memoranda) Elizabeth Martineau's reserved and formidable aspect.<br>
<br>Harriet Martineau had deficient senses of taste and smell, and her progressive deafness had become virtually total by the age of twenty, adding to her sense of isolation. From about 1830 she regularly used an ear trumpet, which was an enduring, and sometimes daunting, feature in contemporaries' recollections of her. Many disliked it, among them Sydney Smith (1771&#150;1845), though with his booming voice he scarcely needed it, while Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804&#150;1864) recalled it &#145;as an organ of intelligence and sympathy &hellip; a sensitive part of her, like the feelers of some insects&#146;.<br>
<br>Harriet Martineau was taught largely at home, but for two years from 1813 to 1815 she attended an excellent school headed by the Revd Isaac Perry (1777&#150;1837), who had left the Congregationalists for the Unitarians in 1812; he was, she recalled, &#145;made to be a girls' schoolmaster&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>). For fifteen months in 1818&#150;19 she was a boarder in a small school in Bristol run by an aunt. While living in Bristol she also received religious instruction from the Revd Lant Carpenter (1780&#150;1840), minister at Lewin's Mead Chapel, who made a powerful impression on her, though she was very dismissive of him in her autobiography.<br>
<br>Surviving correspondence from the early 1820s reveals a high-spirited and happy family. The Martineaus attended the Octagon Chapel in Norwich, one of the leading Unitarian congregations in the country. Company in the town was plentiful and lively: having long since abandoned the old Calvinist traditions of the dissenters, the Martineaus played cards and danced, and there were long visits to relatives elsewhere. But the letters also record the high seriousness of discussions of political and religious questions. As a child, Harriet Martineau had found consolation in religious reading and fancies, and serious study of her Unitarian inheritance underlay the main preoccupations of her early writing. In 1822 her first published essay, comparing Anna Laetitia Barbauld and Hannah More as devotional writers, appeared in the Unitarian <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span> (17, 1822, 593&#150;6, 746&#150;50). <span class="italic">Devotional Exercises</span> followed two years later, reflecting her enchantment with romantic poetry and importantly qualifying the usual perception of Unitarians as chilly rationalists. In 1831 she gained denomination-wide fame by winning all three prizes in a contest for the best essays aimed at converting Roman Catholics, Jews, and Muslims to Unitarianism.<br>
<br>By inheritance a political radical and dedicated dissenter, Harriet Martineau consistently criticized the Church of England, particularly for what she considered the craven submission of its clergy to creeds and hierarchical authority. No one was more insistent on the obligation to speak out, or even to suffer martyrdom, on matters of principle. Especially significant was her early and lasting commitment to necessarianism, the philosophical determinism then dominant among Unitarian ministers and many educated laymen. Derived from David Hartley (1705&#150;1757) through Joseph Priestley (1733&#150;1805), the most important figure in the emergence of Unitarianism from presbyterianism, necessarianism denied free will, arguing that every seemingly voluntary act was inexorably determined by prior motives formed by association from external impressions. But external impressions could be controlled and so motives could be changed, opening broad opportunities for education, reform of social arrangements, and the discipline of experience to bring behaviour into conformity with divine law. Moreover, to Unitarians, Jesus was not a god but a perfect man, whose death on the cross was an example of self-sacrifice, not a substitutionary atonement. Thus, under providence and God's foreknowledge, every human being could win salvation, alone or with the help of the truly enlightened. Harriet Martineau elaborated this world-view in a series of articles in the <span class="italic">Repository</span> at the end of the 1820s, when that journal was edited by W. J. Fox. Although she eventually withdrew from Unitarianism, she never forsook necessarianism.<h2>
<a name="PoliticaleconomyandliteraryLondonAnationalinstructor"></a>Political economy and literary London: A national instructor</h2>The growing sense of mission conveyed in the above description of Martineau (it is Fox's) and her early development as philosopher and writer were set in a time of much personal and family trouble, from which her literary work offered a welcome deliverance. Her beloved elder brother Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1795) died of tuberculosis in 1824; her father's business suffered badly in the economic collapse of 1825, and he died the next year. In May 1827 came the death of her fianc&eacute;, John Hugh Worthington (<i>b</i>. 1804), a young minister at Cross Street Chapel, Manchester, who had been a college friend of James Martineau. The brief attachment had been doubtful from the first, as Worthington's ardent hopes came up against her reluctance, compounded of uncertainty about his health, worries about the prospect of marriage, and family pressures. A manifest sense of relief is conveyed in her oddly detached letters at the time of his death and in the celebration of single life recorded in her autobiography, although she delighted in children and was always happy in a domestic circle.<br>
<br>The failure of the family firm in 1829 threw Harriet Martineau on her own resources. Rejecting the alternative of governessing, she determined to live by her pen rather than her needle, although needlework remained an enjoyable recreation throughout her life. Up to that point her work for Fox had been unremunerated, but he now began to pay her &pound;15 a year. She wrote for other publishers as well. <span class="italic">Traditions of Palestine, or, Times of the Saviour</span> (1829) attracted notice on both sides of the Atlantic and foreshadowed her later interest in the Near East. Of her apprentice tales, <span class="italic">The Rioters</span> (1827), which dealt with machine breaking, and <span class="italic">The Turn Out</span> (1829), on wages and strikes, were more immediately prophetic.<br>
<br>At about the time of these modest successes, Martineau had encountered <span class="italic">Conversations on Political Economy</span> (1816) by Jane Marcet (1769&#150;1858), an event that soon led to a bold new project. In 1831, with Fox's strong encouragement and with his brother Charles as the not particularly generous publisher, she began work on <span class="italic">Illustrations of Political Economy</span>, a series of twenty-three tales in twenty-five parts published monthly from February 1832. Based on rapid study of economic principles, particularly in the works of James Mill and T. R. Malthus, and with a generally effective if sometimes forced and wooden narrative style, the tales made her famous almost overnight. A failure in so far as they were intended to make the working classes think rightly about economic laws, the stories reinforced middle-class convictions and were welcomed accordingly, while reviews ranged from enthusiastic to extremely hostile, according to the reviewers' political prejudices. She was quickly invited to write four additional volumes, <span class="italic">Poor Laws and Paupers Illustrated</span> (1833), and a further five tales, <span class="italic">Illustrations of Taxation</span> (1834), to improve prospects for reform in those areas under the whig government.<br>
<br>John Stuart Mill commented acutely that Martineau reduced political economy to an absurdity by simply carrying it out logically to all its consequences  (<span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, 2nd ser., 8, 1834, 321), and she has remained famous as an advocate of the most doctrinaire version of the science. It is true that she remained loyal to the central tenets of free trade and non-intervention, and, ever the manufacturer's daughter, she continued to think that social problems were more likely to arise from the rapid growth of towns than from factory evils. But, though she never favoured trade unions, her later visit to America persuaded her of the virtues of the Rappite and Shaker communities, and she came to look benevolently on association, particularly consumers' co-operatives, as one solution to economic ills. In 1855 she wrote an article that argued so severely against government-required fencing of dangerous machinery that the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span> rejected it, and it was published as a pamphlet by the National Association of Factory Occupiers. But a few years later she supported the new round of factory legislation, and thought that if the market did not solve pressing social problems then the state must intervene.<br>
<br>In late 1832 Martineau moved to London to enjoy the celebrity she had earned, living first in lodgings in Conduit Street and then in a small house taken by her mother in Fludyer Street, near Downing Street, Westminster, but now vanished from the map. In an article in the <span class="italic">London and Westminster Review</span> (32, 1839, 261&#150;81) in April 1839 she wrote critically about the phenomenon of literary lionizing, and further recollections appear, delightfully, in her autobiography. She was well connected by family ties to radical London, but W. J. Fox was her main point of entry to intellectual circles. She came to know most of the prominent political figures in the reform era, among whom Lord Durham was a hero to her, while Lord Brougham she found by turns fascinating and untrustworthy.<br>
<br>Of average height, with a plain face, grey-green eyes, and brown hair, Harriet Martineau had a pleasant voice and manner and could converse confidently, even boldly, on almost any subject: Sydney Smith once deplored a sleep-destroying dream in which he was chained to a rock, and was being talked to death by Harriet Martineau and Macaulay. Some years later, Hawthorne described her as &#145;a large, robust (one might almost say bouncing) elderly woman&#146;, with a face &#145;so kind, cheerful and intelligent &hellip; that she is pleasanter to look at than most beauties&#146;. Her talking still struck him as remarkable, &#145;like the babbling of a brook&#146;  (<span class="italic">English Notebooks</span>, ed. R. Stewart, 1941, 77). She approved of none of the portraits of her until that by George Richmond in 1849; the drawing was so good, she reported, that people agreed there was nothing to say about it: &#145;It is just me&#146;  (H. Martineau to L. Hunt, 24 Jan 1851, BL, Add. MS 38 111, fols. 1&#150;6).<h2>
<a name="Americantour18341836"></a>American tour, 1834&#150;1836</h2>Harriet Martineau had been frequently prostrated by her active London life and by constant writing to deadline, so when the series were drawing to completion, the need for a change determined a new and fateful step: she would observe the creation of a new society in the United States. Accompanied by Louisa Jeffrey, a young Unitarian woman she had met in London, she sailed for America on 9 August 1834. From New York she travelled through western Massachusetts to Albany and on to Niagara, then to a personal shrine in Northumberland, Pennsylvania, where Priestley had lived his last years and was buried. After extended stays in Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, and Charleston, she travelled across the south to the Mississippi, sailed to Kentucky, where she saw Mammoth cave, and stayed for three weeks in Lexington before ten days in Cincinnati and a return up the Ohio and through Virginia to New York. Without her companion, she toured New England in the autumn of 1835, spent the winter in Boston, and headed west, again to Niagara and on to Detroit and Chicago, returning on the Great Lakes to Cleveland and thence to New York, where she sailed for England on 1 August 1836.<br>
<br>The rigours of the journey were compensated for by the intense but critical interest Harriet Martineau took in what she saw. Her way was smoothed in most cities by Unitarian connections and made rougher by the reputation that preceded her. She made no secret of her sympathy with the whig party against the Jacksonian Democrats, and her already vocal opposition to slavery was strengthened by seeing the institution in practice. In Boston she aligned herself with the most radical wing of the abolitionists, led by William Lloyd Garrison, and in those circles made one of the closest friendships in her life, with Maria Weston Chapman, her literary executor and first biographer. No cause, in a life devoted to causes, so preoccupied her as opposition to slavery, not only in America but in the world at large.<br>
<br>Back in London, Martineau published <span class="italic">Society in America</span> (1837), a two-volume analysis that, other than Alexis, comte de Tocqueville's, contemporaneous <span class="italic">Democracy in America</span> (1835; trans. 1835&#150;40), may be regarded as the best book among the vast outpouring of travel writing on the great transatlantic experiment. She had originally intended the title to promise an explicit discussion of theory and practice, and, partisan and personal though the book is, the acute observation and the high level of generalization transcend a mere travel account to make it a historical document in its own right and a pioneering work of sociological analysis. The next year <span class="italic">Retrospect of Western Travel</span> offered a more conventional, though delightful and revealing, record of the journey. She received &pound;900 for the first book, &pound;600 for the second. Also in 1838 her contribution to a series of guides on various subjects by different hands returned to the analytical level to discuss principles of social observation: this remarkable little book was called <span class="italic">How to Observe: Morals and Manners</span>.<br>
<br>Like most writers Martineau was expected to turn her hand to a novel. <span class="italic">Deerbrook</span> (1839) was her sole large-scale effort in the form, although the sympathetic portrayal of Toussaint l'Ouverture and the Haitian revolution in <span class="italic">The Hour and the Man</span> (1840) evoked much admiration, and the four long tales making up <span class="italic">The Playfellow</span> (1842) remained in print for over a century to enforce their stern lesson of willingness to suffer for the right. <span class="italic">Deerbrook</span> had a similar moral aim. Although the novel offers in Mrs Rowland a splendid, eventually humbled, villain, the plot turns on an unfortunate marital choice, forcing the leading male character, an apothecary, to choose between duty and emotion. At times it justifies Thomas Carlyle's description of it as &#145;very ligneous, very trivial-didactic&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Letters of Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle</span>, ed. C. R. Sanders and K. J. Fielding, 15 vols., 1970&#150;87, 11.87); undoubtedly over-long and occasionally extravagant in its rhetoric, it fairly soon fell into neglect. It has recently evoked new interest, partly for the psychological insights it offers into its author, and partly as a sympathetic portrayal of a hero from the middle ranks of society, a point very important to her, at the very height of the craze for &#145;silver fork&#146; novels.<br>
<br>These major books of Martineau's second London period were surrounded by an array of journalism in the leading reviews and by efforts to advance a number of causes in addition to anti-slavery, notably the legal and economic advancement of women. Here, again, was a campaign that drew new force from her stay in Boston, and the famous Seneca Falls meeting in 1840, usually seen as the fountainhead of modern feminism, found her among its most enthusiastic endorsers. She was never in entire sympathy with the campaign for the political rights of women&#151;for example, she is very severe in her autobiography about Mary Wollstonecraft&#151;giving priority to women's claims in the labour market and to female education in schools and in the home. She approached the latter subject with genuine originality in a series of essays collected in 1849 as <span class="italic">Household Education</span>.<h2>
<a name="Newturningsmesmerismandpositivephilosophy"></a>New turnings: mesmerism and positive philosophy</h2>In 1838 Harriet Martineau began to suffer acute physical symptoms and the next year collapsed during a visit to Venice. The problem was a prolapsed uterus almost certainly caused by an ovarian cyst. She moved to Newcastle to be near her doctor, her brother-in-law T. M. Greenhow (1791&#150;1881), and eventually took up residence in rented rooms in Tynemouth, where after 1842 she was largely confined to her couch. Despite the debility and frequent suffering, she led an active philanthropic and literary life and entertained a stream of visitors. The experience was turned to account in <span class="italic">Life in the Sickroom</span> (1844), an inspirational and instructive volume for other sufferers that evoked much admiration and almost equal hostility.<br>
<br>Writing to Jeanie Walsh in January 1843, Jane Carlyle, a difficult friend, deplored what she saw as &#145;a dreadful state of &#147;self-consciousness&#148; of late&#146; in Martineau  (<span class="italic">Collected Letters of Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle</span>, ed. C. R. Sanders and K. J. Fielding, 16.34&#150;5). This was soon to be evident from her book, and could be seen already in two ostensibly principled actions that annoyed or alienated many old friends. One was a much publicized refusal to accept a civil-list pension offered to help in circumstances inevitably reduced by illness (her income for 1842 was &pound;120). She had once before refused such assistance, at the time of the political economy tales, and was to do so again when W. E. Gladstone made an offer in 1873, although she accepted the proceeds from a private campaign organized by her close friend the younger Erasmus Darwin (1804&#150;1881). The other was to demand the return of her letters, on pain of being denied all future correspondence. Some friends reluctantly complied (her brother James first made shorthand abstracts, now transcribed in the library at Harris Manchester College, Oxford), but others refused and were (mostly) cut off. She forbade publication of her letters, arguing that, as &#145;written speech&#146;, they were entitled to the same protection.<br>
<br>None of these passages, however, matched the stir created by the cure which Martineau insisted was a result of mesmerism. For some years she had been interested in phrenological and mesmeric phenomena, which seemed to suggest the imminent discovery of new laws of thought, and as the craze mounted to its height in the early 1840s the urging of friends found her a willing subject. Even Dr Greenhow persuaded himself that, given her susceptibilities, it might have some good effect. At the hands of several practitioners, including her own personal maid, the symptoms of her illness disappeared. She published an account of the cure in six letters to <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> in November and December 1844 and so became one of the most celebrated medical cases of the century. She regarded Greenhow's defensive pamphlet, <span class="italic">Medical Report of the Case of Miss H&#151; M&#151;</span> (1845), which described his treatment of her condition and her symptoms in detail&#151;&#145;not even written in Latin&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>)&#151;as an act of treachery that warranted her refusal to see him again.<br>
<br>Whatever the medical and psychological explanation, Martineau was able to resume an astonishingly strenuous life. Its high point was her extensive tour of Egypt and the Near East in 1846&#150;7. Like <span class="italic">Society in America</span> the resulting book, <span class="italic">Eastern Life: Present and Past</span> (1848), combined a travel account with acute observation and important reflections. While sharing the emotion evoked in so many of her travelling contemporaries by the sights and historical resonance of the Holy Land, she was confirmed in her growing sense of the historicity of the Christian dispensation and of its present irrelevance. In 1851 she published an exchange of letters with a mesmeric adviser who had become a close friend, Henry George Atkinson, under the title <span class="italic">Letters on the Laws of Man's Nature and Development</span>. The bulk of the book is Atkinson's, with promptings from Harriet Martineau, but she associated herself fully with the result, not only underlining her faith in mesmerism but proclaiming a rejection of all religion. Again a publication brought notoriety and broken friendships.<br>
<br>The most traumatic of these breaks was no doubt inevitable, but its timing and its occasion could scarcely have been worse. Many years before, in 1824, Martineau had gone on a walking tour of the Scottish highlands with her brother James, then a ministerial student. The main subject of their long conversations was, in her recollection (which he substantially confirms), the doctrine of necessity, which he had recently suggested might offer an answer to some of her metaphysical concerns. From the early 1830s, however, he began to move away from their shared philosophy. Rediscovering free will and convinced that religion was an essential human need that carried conviction not because of external evidences but because the soul commanded it, he rose to prominence as the leader of the &#145;new school&#146; of Unitarianism, as against the &#145;old school&#146; descended from Priestley. Harriet had observed this growing estrangement with genuine puzzlement, tinged with the old affection. In May 1851 James Martineau published a very hostile review of the Atkinson letters in the <span class="italic">Prospective Review</span> (7, 1851, 224&#150;62), which he edited with three friends; he later insisted disingenuously that the book had fallen to him in the ordinary editorial rota. It was a terrible blow to Harriet. Characteristically, James could not quite understand his sister's feelings and tried on a few occasions to effect a reconciliation, but to no avail. In the mid-1860s, when he was a leading candidate for the chair of philosophy at University College, London, she was a willing conspirator in the campaign led by the psychologist Alexander Bain to deny him the professorship, on the grounds that appointing a minister to so crucial a post in an avowedly secular foundation was wrong.<br>
<br>Whatever the personal cost of her new direction, Martineau never looked back. In her autobiography, written in 1855, she is forthright about her unbelief and the emancipatory process by which she arrived at it; less appealingly, she voices contempt for nearly all the Unitarians who had nurtured her early intellectual development and mediated the mental structures which she never abandoned. In 1859 she welcomed Charles Darwin's <span class="italic">On the Origin of Species</span> with almost unmeasured warmth, regretting only that he occasionally mentioned a creator or a first cause, a prudential reticence that she feared would allow believers to cling to outworn prejudices.<br>
<br>In 1851 Martineau had acquainted herself with the <span class="italic">Cours de philosophie positive</span> by the French philosopher Auguste Comte, whose system charted the evolution of the sciences from the superstitious through the metaphysical to the positive stage, in which law, rather than supernatural influences or abstract systems, became the basis for understanding. The roots of this positive philosophy lay in the teachings of the comte de Saint-Simon. In the W. J. Fox circle in 1831 Harriet Martineau had been impressed by the Saint-Simonian missionaries then visiting London, whose diverging course from the master competed with Comte's system, which was in some ways more extravagant. At times in her writings of the 1830s she seemed almost to anticipate the law of three stages. Martineau's translation and abridgement of the <span class="italic">Cours</span> appeared in 1853 as <span class="italic">The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte</span>, by which vehicle the English-speaking world was first introduced to Comte's text. Martineau never accepted many aspects of Comte's philosophy: she rejected the theocratic structure of the later positive polity and powerfully dissented from his subordination of women. But to the end of her life, she continued to uphold him as a guide to the right mode of thought for the nineteenth century. Although this can be seen as a natural evolution from her Priestleyanism and her early essays on the art of thinking, she regarded it as a fundamental departure.<h2>
<a name="Aconsummatejournalist"></a>A consummate journalist</h2>In 1845 Harriet Martineau settled in the Lake District and in 1846 moved into a charming house, The Knoll, which was built for her in Ambleside. There she maintained a happy and industrious household, with the usual succession of well-known callers and extended, welcome visits from young nieces and nephews. She supervised a 2 acre farm&#151;writing a book on the subject, of course&#151;and continued to engage in extensive charitable effort. Mrs Chapman gives her income for one unspecified year in the 1850s as around &pound;800, of which about half was from current and past work, and most of the rest from investments; in 1871, after retirement, her income was &pound;470, mostly from investments (M. W. Chapman, &#145;Memorials&#146;, in <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, and Weston MSS, Boston Public Library). In both years she appears to have laid out about a third of her income in good works.<br>
<br>Martineau knew the famous local residents, including William Wordsworth; she was an intimate in the household headed by Mary Arnold, the widow of Thomas and mother of Matthew, and corresponded with many literary and political figures elsewhere. In addition to the major books, she continued to turn out periodical writing of a quality that led George Eliot to say, in admiring an article on the great German historian B. G. Niebuhr (1776&#150;1831), that she was &#145;the only English woman that possesses thoroughly the art of writing&#146;  (G. Eliot to Mr and Mrs C. Bray and S. S. Hennell, 2 June 1852, <span class="italic">George Eliot Letters</span>, ed. G. S. Haight, 2, 1954, 32).<br>
<br>In 1852 Martineau began writing leading articles for the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> in London, a connection established when the editor, Frederick Knight Hunt, published her letters from Ireland, and thereupon suggested that she contribute two or three leaders a week, a schedule made possible by improved rail and postal services, which ensured that an article posted in the evening in Ambleside would be on the editor's desk in London the following morning. By the time she retired in 1866, she had written more than 1600, along with occasional letters and non-editorial pieces, among them a brilliant set of portraits of leading Victorians later collected as <span class="italic">Biographical Sketches</span> (1869).<br>
<br>It was a natural m&eacute;tier. The Martineau household in Norwich had been highly engaged politically, and she had herself been deeply impressed in the 1820s by George Canning's prediction that the world would soon see a great war of opinion that would set right against might&#151;a conflict she was led to see in every war that broke out for the remainder of her life. A principled reformer and an astute observer of national and international affairs, she was also a brilliant contemporary historian. In 1848 she accepted an invitation from the publisher Charles Knight to write a history of her times, a project Knight himself had begun but had had to abandon. The <span class="italic">History of the Thirty Years' Peace</span>, covering the years 1815&#150;45, appeared in 1849&#150;50; later editions carried it back to 1800 and down to 1850. Annalistic in construction and opinionated in tone, the book has an acuteness and immediacy that support its claim to being, perhaps, her masterpiece. The tone of her editorial writing is confident, the style impeccable, the range astonishing. Old enthusiasms are there&#151;anti-slavery, education, the condition of women, political economy (somewhat modified) and free trade, ecclesiastical and clerical malignity. New interests to which she returned repeatedly included Ireland and India, the reforms proposed by Florence Nightingale, and the deterioration of politics: she profoundly distrusted Palmerston, Gladstone, and Disraeli, and placed her confidence in men of secondary rank such as Sidney Herbert and George William Frederick Howard, Lord Morpeth, later seventh earl of Carlisle. Above all, she was the paper's expert on America, a subject which the outbreak of the civil war in 1861 gave her ample opportunity to exploit.<br>
<br>Nor did the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> exhaust Martineau's capacities. In the early 1850s she wrote for <span class="italic">Household Words</span> and the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>; in 1858 she transferred her allegiance to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, of which her cousin Henry Reeve (1813&#150;1895) had become editor three years earlier. In 1861 she became European correspondent of a New York abolitionist paper, the <span class="italic">Anti-Slavery Standard</span>, a post she used to scold as much as to encourage the Americans into courses of which she approved. After her retirement in 1866 she could still re-enter the lists: in 1868 she used a review of a book on the Salem witchcraft episode in colonial New England to denounce the spiritualist circles much talked of in that decade, which she regarded as utterly unscientific  (<span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, 128, 1868, 1&#150;47). The next year, in a succession of addresses and open letters (printed in Chapman's &#145;Memorials&#146;, appended to Martineau's <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>), she gave her firm support to the campaign of Josephine Butler to repeal the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span>.<h2>
<a name="Lastillnessandautobiography"></a>Last illness and autobiography</h2>In 1855 Harriet Martineau had been once more stricken with illness, caused, she believed, by heart disease&#151;a not inaccurate, but insufficient, diagnosis. She died on 27 June 1876 at The Knoll, Ambleside. The attending physician gave as the cause of death fatty degeneration of the heart and an ovarian tumour; the tumour, which the autopsy showed to be of enormous size, had grown, severely compressing and distending the internal organs and producing the symptoms that reduced her to invalidism in the last twenty years of her life. She remained mentally alert and an excellent correspondent almost to the moment of death. Her investments brought some ease to her old age, as did the generosity of the many admiring friends who came to share the hospitality at The Knoll. She was buried on 1 July in the family plot in the general cemetery, Key Hill, Birmingham. Her personal estate was valued for probate at under &pound;10,000.<br>
<br>When, in 1855, she expected death to strike at any moment, Martineau wrote her autobiography in the space of three months, having it stereotyped so that it would be published unchanged when her death occurred; she also wrote and filed with the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> the character sketch the paper ran as an obituary on 29 June 1876. If these moves suggest (correctly) that she was concerned about how the world saw her, she was not concerned that the image be uniformly favourable. Indeed, when the autobiography was published in 1877, the frequent tone of asperity, added to candid judgements as severe on herself as on others, seriously undercut her reputation. She has never lacked admirers, but a major upsurge in interest happened in the 1960s, in part because she was rediscovered by feminist scholars. Extensive and newly available manuscript collections, no longer subject to her prohibition against publication, have revealed her as a magnificent correspondent. The autobiography, too, is now generally recognized as one of the best self-studies of the century.<br>
<br>One must regret that two of Martineau's greatest contemporaries, George Eliot and Matthew Arnold, who knew her well, never wrote the appreciations each had once expressed the wish to do. Both would have found much in her life and work to object to: most contemporaries did. Certainly, no one who ever met her forgot her. She could be charming, affectionate, and immensely generous, but she was also judgemental and could be difficult in personal relationships, as a trail of broken friendships shows, not in that perhaps very different from many contemporaries in an age that prized individuality and even eccentricity.<br>
<br>In the end it is Harriet Martineau's work that counts, in itself and as a striking example of what a single woman could accomplish in unpropitious times. She herself said, in the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> obituary, that she worked well only within a limited range and had no originality of mind. But the limits were pretty widely extended, and the combination of talents and interests argue an originality in the whole that the parts might lack. Above all, she was a person of singular faithfulness, whatever small digressions may have appeared along the way, to a philosophical position and a political commitment that projected the assumptions of the 1820s and 1830s, with no small effect, into the more complex world of the late Victorians.<br>
