<span class="headword">Warren, Sir  John Borlase</span>, baronet  (1753&#150;1822), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, first son of John Borlase Warren (1699&#150;1763) of Stapleford, Nottinghamshire, and his wife, Bridget, daughter of Gervase Rosell or Russell of Radcliffe-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, was born on 2 September 1753 at Stapleford, Nottinghamshire, and baptized there on 5 October. Having been taught by the Revd John Prinsep at Bicester, he entered Winchester College in 1768 and matriculated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1769.<br>
<br>Entered on the books of the <i>Marlborough</i> guardship as an able seaman in 1771, Warren was discharged in 1772 to the sloop <i>Alderney</i>, which was then employed on the east coast. His naval service alternated with residence at Cambridge where he graduated BA in 1773 and proceeded MA in 1776. After discharge from the <i>Alderney</i> in 1774 he was elected on his own interest MP for Great Marlow in Buckinghamshire where his family had long owned property. He was created a baronet on 1 June 1775. Warren, known in his early years as a &#145;dandy&#146; and &#145;young buck&#146;, was a heavy gambler and amused himself by the purchase of a yacht and Lundy island as a base for sailing in the Bristol Channel.<br>
<br>During the American War of Independence Warren resumed his naval career and went to America in the frigate <i>Venus</i> as a midshipman. After transferral to the frigate <i>Apollo</i> he was promoted fourth lieutenant of the <i>Nonsuch</i> (64 guns) in July 1778. He returned to England, was appointed first lieutenant of the <i>Victory</i> in March 1779, and in August was commanding the sloop <i>Helena</i>. In September 1781 he was posted to the frigate <i>Ariadne</i>, moved to the frigate <i>Winchester</i> in March 1782, and went on half pay at the peace in 1783. On 12 December 1780 he married Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1839), daughter of Sir John Clavering; they had three daughters, one of whom, Frances Maria, later married George Charles, fourth Lord Vernon, and two sons, one of whom entered the Coldstream Guards and was killed at Abu Qir in 1801.<br>
<br>Warren was forced to sell his property at Great Marlow in 1781 following a very expensive re-election contest in 1780, and he did not stand for parliament in 1784. At the beginning of his parliamentary service he voted with Lord North's administration, but his support became uncertain when he did not receive the naval preferment he sought. Although considered a supporter of William Pitt in 1783, he attended the St Alban's tavern meeting of coalitionists in 1784. While out of public life, he maintained his professional interest in naval affairs as vice-president of the Society for the Improvement of Naval Architecture. He was also the author in 1791 of <span class="italic">A View of the Naval Force of Great Britain</span>, which was dedicated to the duke of Clarence in whose household Warren had been a groom of the bedchamber since 1787. In this tract he attacked the excesses of press gangs and advocated the keeping of a register of seamen available for service in wartime which in peace would constitute a reserve force on half pay.<br>
<br>In the French Revolutionary War Warren was appointed to the frigate <i>Flora</i>, flagship of Rear-Admiral John MacBride, in a squadron off Brest and the Channel Islands. Early in 1794 Warren himself commanded a squadron ordered to capture several French frigates off the coast of France that had damaged British trade. On 23 April his squadron captured three of the French frigates, and for this feat Warren was made a knight of the Bath on 30 May. In August his squadron drove on shore south of Brest a French frigate and two corvettes. In addition to these warships Warren's squadron destroyed a large number of vessels engaged in the French coasting trade. In the spring of 1795 he was moved to the <i>Pomone</i> (44 guns), one of the frigates he had captured in April 1794, and was ordered to convoy an expedition of French royalist troops to Quiberon Bay. Although Warren landed the royalists safely and took three of the offshore islands as places of refuge after the royalists were decisively defeated by the republicans, the expedition was abandoned, and Warren returned the survivors to England. Warren's squadron, ordered in 1796 to attack the French coasting trade, destroyed or captured more than 220 vessels, thirty-six of which, including the frigate <i>Andromache</i> (36 guns), were armed. The patriotic fund for this service presented Warren with a sword worth 100 guineas. In 1797 he was appointed to the ship of the line <i>Canada</i> (74 guns) in the Channel Fleet. When a French squadron under Commodore Bompart with 5000 troops bound for Killala Bay in north-west Ireland escaped from Brest in September 1798, Warren was sent in pursuit with three ships of the line, five frigates, and several smaller vessels. Warren's squadron encountered the French squadron off Lough Swilly and engaged in a hard-fought action on 12 October; the flagship <i>Hoche</i> (74 guns) and three of the frigates were captured, five others being subsequently taken. Warren's conduct of this operation, for which he obtained a gold medal, was highly praised, and he received the thanks of both the English and Irish parliaments. After receiving promotion to rear-admiral on 14 February 1799 he hoisted his flag on the <i>Temeraire</i> (98 guns) in the Channel Fleet off Brest from where he was sent on detached service in the Bay of Biscay and off Ferrol. In 1800, while serving under Lord St Vincent off Brest and then under Lord Keith off Cadiz, he received more than &pound;12,000 in prize money. When Keith in 1801 was co-operating with the army in Egypt, Warren was in charge of operations in the western Mediterranean.<br>
<br>Although Warren was actively engaged in naval service, he had been returned in 1797 as MP for Nottingham, a borough that had often been represented by a member of his family. Frequently absent from the Commons because of his duties at sea, he applied for leave in 1800 to look after affairs in his constituency. Lord St Vincent, his commander-in-chief, uncharitably held that Warren was unable to endure long periods at sea, which, &#145;looking back to the course of his services and manner of life when ashore, is easily accounted for&#146;. St Vincent nevertheless testified that Warren was a &#145;good fellow in the presence of an enemy, but runs a little wild when detached&#146;  (Corbett and Richmond, 4.14). When re-elected to parliament in 1802, Warren declared when his return was challenged that &#145;having already supported the public cause to the utmost of my power&#146;, he would not spend another &pound;1000 to represent &#145;that terrible place [Nottingham]&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1790&#150;1820</span>, 5.492&#150;3). Following the peace of Amiens in March 1802 Warren was appointed ambassador to Russia after the tsar had requested that a naval officer be named. He was sworn of the privy council on 8 September 1802, and his credentials as ambassador, dated 5 September, were presented in St Petersburg on 10 October. When war with France was renewed in 1803, Warren, hard pressed for money, sought to resume his naval career, but he remained in Russia until 1804. Recognizing the value of an Anglo-Russian alliance for protecting British interests in the Mediterranean, he promoted that goal, though he was careful to let the Russians know that Britain would never sacrifice Malta. Disappointed in his request for an increase in salary as well as in his quest for a peerage, he willingly left St Petersburg in November 1804 when recalled by Pitt. Although there was doubt about whether Warren was loyal to Pitt or Lord Addington, Lord Barham, first lord of the Admiralty, in 1805 offered him a seat on the Admiralty board; but the offer was withdrawn when Warren indicated that he did not want &#145;a place of confinement&#146;. He did, however, support the Pitt government in the Commons where he presented the petition of the naval orphans' asylum for a parliamentary grant and spoke for the prize agency bill.<br>
<br>Warren was promoted vice-admiral on 5 November, and returned to naval duty in December 1805 when he was named commander-in-chief of one of the two squadrons sent to hunt down the squadrons of Leiss&egrave;gues and Willaumez that had escaped from Brest. He hoisted his flag on the <i>Foudroyant</i> (80 guns), and sailed from Spithead with six other ships of the line in January 1806. Sailing southwards towards Madeira, he missed the French squadrons from Brest, but south-west of Madeira captured the <i>Marengo</i> (80 guns), flagship of Rear-Admiral Linois, and the <i>Belle Poule</i> (40 guns), returning to France from the East Indies. On his return to Spithead, Warren was ordered in June to scour the western Atlantic for Willaumez's squadron, Leiss&egrave;gue's squadron having been destroyed by Sir John Duckworth off Santo Domingo in February. Warren touched at Barbados in July and reached the Chesapeake in September without encountering Willaumez's squadron, and returned to England in November. But before his return Lord St Vincent of the Channel Fleet once again castigated Warren's conduct, calling him &#145;a mere partisan, preferring prize money to the public good at all times&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selections from the Correspondence of &hellip; Markham</span>, 60). Thomas Grenville, first lord of the Admiralty, complained that Warren had &#145;played the devil&#146; by leaving some of Willaumez's squadron unwatched in the Chesapeake. Holding that the admiral's conduct was &#145;indefensible&#146; and that he was &#145;good for nothing but fine weather and easy sailing&#146;, Grenville declared that he was not entitled to any &#145;mark of approbation&#146;  (Grenville, 4.91&#150;4, 103&#150;4). But despite Grenville's poor opinion of him, Warren, who had not stood at Nottingham for re-election to parliament in 1806, was elected to fill a vacancy in March 1807 for Buckingham, which was controlled by Grenville's brother, the marquess of Buckingham. Warren's parliamentary career finally ended with the general election of May 1807 when the marquess chose his nephew to stand instead of Warren.<br>
<br>In October 1807 Warren succeeded Vice-Admiral George C. Berkeley as commander-in-chief of the North American squadron based at Halifax. He sailed in December 1807 from Cawsand Bay in the flagship <i>Swiftsure</i> (74 guns), and reached Bermuda in January 1808 where he took command of the squadron from Berkeley in February. His chief task was to curb the aggressiveness unleashed by his predecessor that had led to a crisis with the United States when HMS <i>Leopard</i> attacked the USS <i>Chesapeake</i> off the Virginia Capes on 22 June 1807. Under Warren the squadron was largely concerned with routine matters, such as the protection of British trade and watching for stray French cruisers, three of which were captured in 1809. He was concerned with the establishment of more clearly defined limits for the North American station, the building of a permanent dockyard at Bermuda, and the protection of British and Spanish interests in East Florida from American filibusterers. As his three-year tour of duty neared an end in 1810 he requested to be relieved for reasons of health. Acceding to his request, the Admiralty promoted him in July 1810 to the rank of full admiral.<br>
<br>Warren relinquished the North American command in January 1811, returned to England, and was unemployed until the outbreak of the Anglo-American War in 1812. Sent out to America again in August 1812, he was made commander-in-chief of the consolidated North American, Jamaica, and Leeward Islands squadrons. Although Warren had had a good fighting record when younger, he was now less aggressive, and was sent to the American theatre because of his tact and diplomatic experience, which, it was thought, might be useful in negotiating terms of peace. Warren was soon criticized for his slowness in establishing a blockade of the American coast and not giving attention to the Great Lakes. He was not, however, lacking in strategic ideas, for he soon recognized that an offensive against New Orleans and the Gulf coast would relieve American pressure on Canada, and in 1813 he promoted a naval offensive in the Chesapeake region. He also advocated the breakup of the consolidated command, which he regarded as too unwieldy, and this was done in 1813 when he was ordered to return home and relinquish the command to Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochran on the ground that the diminished command did not require the services of a full admiral.<br>
<br>With his recall, Warren's naval career came to an end, but he received ample recognition of his services. His final promotion to admiral of the white came in June 1814, and in the same month he was made a DCL of the University of Oxford. He became a knight grand cross of the Bath in 1815 and a knight grand cross of Hanover in 1819. Although he received the diplomatic pension he had long sought he never obtained the peerage that he wanted. He died suddenly on 27 February 1822 while visiting Greenwich Hospital, and was buried in the family vault at Stratton Audley in Oxfordshire on 5 March. A tablet to his memory is in Attenborough church in Nottinghamshire. He was survived by his wife, who died on 28 December 1839.<br>
<br>Fired with a zeal for naval service while still a schoolboy, Warren for nearly three decades was an active and faithful serving officer, though not of the first rank. Although noted as an aggressive and intrepid fighter he appears to have been lacking in practical seamanship; and although strongly motivated by true patriotism he was always eager for prize money to support his extravagant lifestyle. Yet even the demanding St Vincent recognized his abilities and courage as a fighter, and Barham once considered him for a seat on the Admiralty board. Until near the end of his career Warren had little opportunity to demonstrate any ability as an administrator or strategist. But as commander-in-chief of the North American station during the difficult period from 1807 to 1810, he was a capable and tactful administrator and an effective defender of British interests. As a wartime commander-in-chief in America from 1812 to 1814 his strategic insights were sound. Of the British admirals of his period, Warren, with his aristocratic and university background, was one of the most conspicuous, as a man of fashion and elegant manners.<br>
