<span class="headword">Macaulay, Sir  James Buchanan</span>  (1793&#150;1859), <span class="occ">lawyer in Canada</span>, was born on 3 December 1793 at Newark (Niagara-on-the-Lake), Upper Canada, the second son of James Macaulay, an army surgeon, and his wife, Elizabeth Tuck Hayter. The family was moderately wealthy and well connected, and in 1805 James joined the sons of the Upper Canadian &eacute;lite in the Revd John Strachan's school in Cornwall. In 1809 he was commissioned ensign with the 98th regiment of foot and in 1812 joined the Glengarry light infantry fencibles. He saw action against American forces at Sackets Harbor, Ogdensburg, Lundy's Lane, and Fort Erie. After the end of the war he began to study law (1816); in 1822 he was called to the bar and in 1825 he became a bencher of the Law Society.<br>
<br>He was industrious and successful at the bar, and his high social standing was consolidated when, on 1 December 1821, he married Rachel Crookshank (1799/1800&#150;1883), the daughter of John Gamble, an army surgeon and colleague of Macaulay's father. They had four daughters and one son and lived quietly in Toronto. Macaulay was a devout Anglican, active in church affairs, and a member of a small coterie of conservatives described derisively as the &#145;Family Compact&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1825 Macaulay was appointed by Sir Peregrine Maitland to the executive council, but he withdrew in 1829 after becoming a judge in the court of king's bench. He was concerned principally with matters of civil litigation and was in general fair, if conservative, in his judgments. He tended towards clemency and was concerned about prison conditions. He was a colonel in the militia and during the rebellion of 1837 in Upper Canada he helped organize the defence of the colony. In 1839 he was asked to report on the Indian department, but he showed little understanding of native concerns, suggesting that the plight of the &#145;degenerate races&#146;, as he called them, be relieved by Christian charity. He was asked, between 1839 and 1849, to undertake a fuller investigation of the Indian department and of the executive council, earning the approval of the governor-general, Lord Sydenham. In 1840 he began the first revision of Upper Canadian statute law, and he served on the commission of 1842 and 1843 inquiring into the court of chancery. In 1843 he was appointed to the court of appeal and in 1849 he became chief justice in the court of common pleas, which post he held until age and increasing deafness forced him to retire in 1856. In that year he was appointed QC and began the revision of the statute law of Upper and Lower Canada, a responsibility which he carried out meticulously. Despite poor health he was appointed to the bench of the court of error and appeal in 1857. In 1858 he was made CB and in 1859 he was knighted. He died on 26 November 1859 after suffering a heart attack at Osgoode Hall, Toronto, leaving his widow the family home at Wykeham Lodge in the city and an estate worth (Canadian) $40,000. A moderate conservative of good judgement, Macaulay helped shape policy on a wide range of questions.<br>
