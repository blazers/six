<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Compton,  Denis Charles Scott</span>  (1918&#150;1997), <span class="occ">cricketer and footballer</span>, was born on 23 May 1918 at 20 Alexandra Road, Hendon, Middlesex, the youngest of three children of Henry (Harry) Ernest Compton, a manufacturing chemist's counterman, and his wife, Jessie Anne Duthie. Both parents resided at Woodford in Essex before moving to Hendon, where Harry Compton established himself as a painter and decorator. Denis's brother, Leslie Harry, followed Denis as a Middlesex cricketer and preceded him as an Arsenal and England footballer. His sister, Hilda, was a natural athlete.<br>
<br>The sporting proclivities of the children derived from their father. Harry Compton was captain of the old boys' cricket team of Bell Lane elementary school, Hendon, and from Denis's earliest years took him to the games to score and, when the chance came, to play. Denis also attended the Bell Lane school; at ten he was in his school team, and at twelve he was scoring runs against an adult team which had to be encouraged by his father to bowl as well and fast as they could. Captain of his school team at both cricket and football, he next captained North London Schools at Lord's against the South, making 88. Aged fourteen he led the London Elementary Schools against a team of public schoolboys, also at Lord's, made 114, and helped to bowl out the opponents for an easy victory. Happily Sir Pelham Warner saw the game and in the spring of 1933 a contract was offered by MCC at the standard ground boy rate of 25<i>s</i>. Denis's mother was sceptical until the Arsenal Football Club manager, the famous Herbert Chapman, signed the boy on, so providing employment all the year.<br>
<br>As with most batsmen destined to reach the top branches of the tree, success arrived at precocious speed. Compton's first appearance for Middlesex came in the Whitsuntide match of 1936 against Sussex at Lord's. Success in that before a full house was followed after a few weeks by his first hundred, and G. O. Allen was soon wondering whether to take the eighteen-year-old prodigy to Australia with MCC that winter. As it was, the first of Compton's seventy-eight test appearances came in the last test of the following summer (1937) against New Zealand. Against Australia in the first test of 1938 at Trent Bridge he made the fourth hundred of a then record total of 658 for eight declared.<br>
<br>It was, however, at Lord's in the second innings of the second test of the series that Compton played what in the minds of the best judges was the defining innings of his life. On a pitch made treacherous by rain and sun England, having lost five wickets for 76, faced probable defeat if he failed. In this situation Compton confronted the fire of McCormick and the spin and lift of O'Reilly with a mastery of technique and coolness of judgement which would have been remarkable in the most mature of batsmen, let alone a young man of twenty. His 76 not out enabled Hammond to declare and put Australia under pressure to draw the match. Compton made seventeen hundreds in tests, yet he always regarded this as his best innings. Henceforward, it seemed, that strong hint of genius would be frustrated only by misfortunes outside his control.<br>
<br>Compton was lucky in those pre-war years in being a member of a strong side, second only to Yorkshire, led by a dashing captain of his own adventurous spirit in R. W. V. Robins: lucky also from 1937 onwards, when Bill Edrich of Norfolk arrived at Lord's to form with him what became one of the most famous partnerships of cricket history. He was fortunate also in the influence of successive head coaches of MCC. The first of them, George Fenner, saw that his cricket was essentially instinctive. &#145;I shouldn't say I coached him&#146;, he would demur. &#145;Let's just say I didn't spoil him&#146;  (West, 24). Pat Hendren, the Middlesex senior professional, and Archie Fowler, who took over from Fenner, reacted similarly.<br>
<br>Crowds took to Compton warmly from the start because he communicated an obvious enjoyment of the game. With his dark good looks went an appealing, carefree spirit. Driving over Vauxhall Bridge he was once told by a fellow motorist who was listening to the radio that the day's cricket in the test at the Oval, in which he was playing, had already started. People forgave an uncertain regard for time and place&#151;which unfortunately grew no better with the years, as wives, tour managers, friends, and all concerned would unanimously agree.<br>
<br>In 1939 Compton improved on the previous years' records with 2468 runs at an average of 56: there were eight hundreds, including his first in a Lord's test, 120 against West Indies made in only 2 hours 20 minutes in a scintillating partnership of 248 with Len Hutton. The latter, batting slowly until Compton joined him, suddenly began to match him stroke for stroke, the roundhead donning for once the plumes of the cavalier. It was to be seven years before these brightest of English stars batted again together. Hutton on the resumption had to improvise with a left arm shortened by a physical training accident. Much luckier, Compton had seen the last two years of his service with the Royal Artillery in India, where he took good advantage of some first-class cricket, playing for Holkar in the Ranji trophy tournament.<br>
<br>Twelve seasons remained to Compton after the war. He reached the peak of his fame in the first four, after which his cricket was impeded by permanent trouble with his right knee. There was one operation which kept him off the field for half the 1950 summer. A more serious one entailed removal of the kneecap in 1955 following regular manipulations to increase the flexion. At the end of the 1957 summer, aged thirty-nine, the pain and frustration demanded his retirement. His record, when the restrictions of the last eight years are considered, is extraordinary: in 515 matches 38,942 runs, average 51.85, with 123 hundreds: in 78 tests 5807 runs, average 50.06, with 17 hundreds. There were 416 catches, 49 in tests. His slow left-arm bowling, little used before the war, was at times, when he developed wrist spin and a well-disguised googly, an important factor. He took 622 wickets, all told, at 32 runs apiece. He was too expensive to be a success in tests, though he might have won one.<br>
<br>As an outside-left Compton was a member of the famous Arsenal teams of the 1930s. He played eleven times for England in wartime internationals. Afterwards, though the MCC tours of 1946&#150;7 and 1948&#150;9 restricted his football, he remained an Arsenal player. He had a powerful left foot and the same flair for the occasion which characterized his cricket. Thus, despite the suspect right knee (from which a ligament had been removed following a pre-war collision with a goalkeeper), he was picked for the cup final of 1950 against Liverpool. In this, the last game he ever played, Peter West tells in <span class="italic">Denis Compton: a Cricketing Genius</span> how his subject considered he had played poorly in the first half. Tom Whittaker, the Arsenal manager, gave him a transforming slug of brandy at the interval, and Denis and Leslie were able to add cup winners' medals to the league winners' medals they had won in 1947&#150;8.<br>
<br>The impact of Compton's cricket now touched new heights of hero-worship. Society found an antidote in sport to war-weariness and austerity, and here was a young man who not only played supremely well but so manifestly relished what he was doing and the pleasure he was giving. &#145;Let's enjoy this!&#146; he was saying as one county attack after another suffered at his hands. Gerald Brodribb in <span class="italic">Champions of Cricket</span> has estimated that in his innings exceeding 50 (of which there were 300) his average rate of progress was about 47 runs an hour. B. J. Wakley estimated Don Bradman's rate as 42. Brodribb names only five truly great batsmen who scored faster: Woolley, Trumper, Macartney, Ranjitsinhji, and Duleepsinhji.<br>
<br>Almost inevitably there were brief periods when the machinery failed to synchronize. At the height of the summer of 1946 Compton made four 0s in a row, all at Lord's, yet he still averaged 61 for the season, with ten hundreds. The other blackspot, much more calamitous, encompassed the 1950&#150;51 series in Australia, when he averaged 7.57 in the tests and in the remaining matches 92.11. In between these extremes&#151;and, of course, afterwards less copiously&#151;the runs flowed in abundance both at home and overseas. Against Australia at Adelaide he made a hundred in each innings. In England neither his aggregate of 3816 runs (average 90.85), made in the hot dry summer of 1947, nor his eighteen hundreds for the season, made the same year, has ever been approached. No Englishman has ever scored as many runs in a home series as his 753 in the tests against South Africa. In fact Bill Edrich, his comrade-in-arms, lagged only a little behind him in that memorable summer. He too exceeded with 3519 runs (average 80) Tom Hayward's previous record total. The runner-up, however, suffered the normal eclipse of the second best: 1947 went down in history as Compton's year.<br>
<br>It was as a result of his prodigious fan mail and of certain commercial offers that Compton accepted the suggestion of a businessman, Bagenal Harvey, to help manage his affairs. Harvey became the first prominent sporting entrepreneur. Theirs was a long association, one of the early fruits being the famous Brylcreem advertisement. This became something of a standing joke, for the smiling figure on the hoardings usually batted without a cap and his hair was often conspicuously untidy.<br>
<br>Of all Compton's test hundreds the writer would give pride of place to his 184 in the test against Australia at Trent Bridge in 1948. It was stretched over six and a half hours and ten separate periods of play, most of them in an eerie, yellow light. In a gallant though vain effort to save the game there was scarcely a false stroke, certainly not a chance. Later in that series at Headingley his wrist spin would probably have reversed the result had not one stumping chance and two slip catches off him been missed at the outset of the winning partnership between Morris and Bradman.<br>
<br>Unfit for the first four tests against Australia in 1956, Compton was picked for the last and bowed out with an innings of 94 which Sir Donald Bradman, now a <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> reporter, rated as the best of the series. A second visit to South Africa the following winter proved a tour too far. Back home, however, he ended his professional career with a sparkling 143 against Worcestershire at Lord's.<br>
<br>In the 1958 new year honours Compton was appointed CBE. He wrote on cricket for the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span> with regular help from R. J. Hayter for forty years, and in the 1950s commented on tests for BBC television. In contrast with his philosophy as a cricketer he was apt to sound a forthright, sometimes almost a fierce note as a critic: he was very much <i>laudator temporis acti</i>. He served for many years as a director of Royds public relations company.<br>
<br>Compton was married three times. His first marriage, on 1 March 1941, to Doris Yvonne Rich (<i>b</i>. 1920/21), a dancer, daughter of Bernard Stewart Rich, a schoolmaster, was dissolved. They had one son. In 1951 he married Valerie Platt, of Isipingo, Natal, whom he first met in Durban during the 1948&#150;9 tour of South Africa. There were two sons of the marriage, which was dissolved in 1960. On 23 September 1975 he married Christine Franklin Tobias (<i>b</i>. 1943/4), daughter of Benjamin Franklin Tobias, company director, with whom he had two daughters. Compton became president of Middlesex in 1990&#150;91 and remained so almost to his death. His name was fittingly perpetuated at Lord's when in 1991 the new open stands at the nursery end were named after Compton and Edrich, one either side of the sightscreen. Edrich had died, but Compton was present on the spot where as a boy he had first watched sixty years previously. The president of MCC, Lord Griffiths, escorted him back to the pavilion to his last standing ovation. He died in hospital at Windsor, Berkshire, on 23 April 1997, survived by his third wife. A memorial service was held in Westminster Abbey on 2 July.<br>
