<span class="headword">Kennelly,  Arthur Edwin</span>  (1861&#150;1939), <span class="occ">electrical engineer</span>, was born on 17 December 1861 at Colaba, near Bombay, India, the only son of David Joseph Kennelly and Kathrine (or Cathrine) Heycock. His father, a native of Cork, Ireland, was then harbour master at Bombay; he later became a barrister in England and king's counsel in the province of Nova Scotia, Canada. Kennelly's mother died a few years after her son's birth. Kennelly was educated at University College School, London (1873&#150;6), and at other private schools in England, Scotland, France, and Belgium. He entered the London office of the Society of Telegraph Engineers (later the Institution of Electrical Engineers) as an office boy and, having studied electrophysics in his spare time, was in 1876 appointed a telegraph operator in the Eastern Telegraph Cable Company based in London. For the next ten years he was engaged in submarine cable work, latterly as a chief electrician, for that company.<br>
<br>In 1887 Kennelly went to the United States to join Thomas A. Edison as principal assistant in his electrical laboratory at West Orange, New Jersey, where he remained until 1894 when he joined a firm of consulting electrical engineers. From 1902, when he was appointed to the chair of electrical engineering at Harvard University, until his retirement in 1930, he devoted all his time to teaching and scientific writing. From 1913 to 1924 he was also professor of electrical communications at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where for many years he directed electrical engineering research. On 22 July 1903 he married Julia Grice, a medical practitioner of Philadelphia; they had two children, a daughter who died in infancy and a son, Reginald Grice.<br>
<br>Kennelly's most important contributions lay in the interpretation and explanation of electrical phenomena. His introduction of complex numbers and complex hyperbolic functions in the analysis of alternating currents was an advance on earlier methods, and his postulate of an ionized layer in the upper atmosphere that enabled radio transmissions to be received by reflection over thousands of miles was subsequently verified by Sir Edward Appleton. The same explanation was put forward shortly afterwards independently by Oliver Heaviside and it was named, after both men, the Kennelly&#151;Heaviside layer, now known as the E-layer in the ionosphere.<br>
<br>Widely honoured at home and abroad, Kennelly was president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (1898&#150;1900), the British Institution of Electrical Engineers (1916), and several other professional institutions; he served as a member of many national and international organizations, and received honorary degrees from four universities. His publications include twenty-eight books (as author or co-author) and more than 350 technical papers. Kennelly died on 18 June 1939, in Boston, of uraemic poisoning, and his ashes were scattered in Mount Auburn cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<br>
