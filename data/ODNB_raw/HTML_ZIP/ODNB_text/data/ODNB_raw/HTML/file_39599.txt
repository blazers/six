<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lee,  Arthur Stanley Gould</span>  (1894&#150;1975), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born on 31 August 1894 in the King's Head inn, Emery Lane, Boston, Lincolnshire, the only son of Arthur Lee, a licensed victualler who later became a building contractor, and his wife, Clara Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gould. Nothing is known of his childhood or schooling. As with many young men of his generation, Lee's imagination was caught by the idea of flight, but there was no money to spare for flying lessons.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of war in 1914 Lee saw his chance to learn to fly and attempted to enlist in the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), but only qualified pilots (those who held a privately obtained Royal Aero Club brevet) were being considered. Lacking the technical qualifications necessary for training by the RFC as a mechanic, he joined the infantry, the 13th Sherwood Foresters, and was commissioned in February 1915. After two unsuccessful attempts to gain a transfer to the RFC, an opportunity arose when, in May 1916, as a result of the RFC's heavy losses, commanding officers were instructed not to obstruct volunteers. A further application led to secondment on temporary attachment to the RFC. Shortly afterwards Lee married, on 28 July 1916, Gwynneth, the daughter of Robert Lewis, a stationer; they had one daughter.<br>
<br>After flying training, Lee was posted to France to serve with 46 squadron, arriving at the squadron on 22 May 1917. Based at La Gorgue, on the Ypres front, the squadron was equipped with the Sopwith Pup, a small, highly manoeuvrable single-seater fighter, but with the disadvantages of being slower than its German counterparts and having only one machine-gun&#151;a Vickers, firing through the propeller arc&#151;against the twin Spandaus carried by the German fighters. He flew with 46 squadron until 6 January 1918, when he was posted to home establishment. He had been promoted captain and flight commander on 21 November 1917, and had been shot down by ground fire three times during the battle of Cambrai. He had flown 118 patrols, been in combat fifty-six times, was credited with seven victories, and had flown 250 hours on active service. He was awarded a Military Cross for his work in France, and was gazetted on 4 February 1918. After the war he was posted to south-eastern area flying instructors' school. Passing out as a first-class instructor, he was then posted to 54 training squadron at Fairlop, Essex.<br>
<br>In October 1919 Lee was granted a short service commission in the Royal Air Force, and in March 1924, after several varied postings, was granted a permanent commission as a flight lieutenant in the general duties branch, RAF. His lectures to RAF recruits were published in 1923 as <span class="italic">The Spirit of Air Force Discipline</span>. On 4 November 1925 he was posted to Iraq to serve with no. 5 armoured car company, &#145;driving clapped out Rolls-Royce armoured cars&#146;  (Lee, <span class="italic">Fly Past</span>, 53). With eight RAF squadrons, these had been used to police the Turkish and Kurd insurgents, but the Turkish threat had been quashed before Lee's arrival, and only minor revolts were still breaking out in south-eastern Kurdistan. He was next posted to the staff of general headquarters in Baghdad. Promoted squadron leader in July 1927, he was posted back to England in August and entered the RAF Staff College at Andover, after which he was posted to 10 squadron, a night-bomber squadron flying Handley Page Hyderabads.<br>
<br>Lee's tour of duty with 10 squadron ended in February 1931, and he was posted to the Air Ministry. The growing threat of war in the mid-1930s led to the expansion of the RAF. Now a wing commander (July 1934), Lee was involved in the planning, working with civil servants until 1935, when he attended a course at the Imperial Defence College. In December 1935 he was posted to the command of the RAF station, Hornchurch, Essex, a key station in the air defence of London, but which was in some disarray, with low morale. By 1937, under Lee's leadership, the station was regarded as one of top status in every aspect&#151;from defence operations and exercises to flying exhibitions and sport. An unwelcome posting back to Iraq followed, from which Lee was released by secondment to the Turkish air force as an instructor in October 1937. On 1 November 1938 he was promoted group captain. When war was declared in September 1939 he was still in Turkey, and only after delicate negotiations with the Turkish authorities was he able finally to leave the country, on 11 March 1941, posted as senior administration officer to headquarters, RAF Middle East, in Athens.<br>
<br>During the chaotic and mismanaged evacuation from Greece of the 58,000 men of the British army and RAF which began on 23 April 1941, Lee eventually took command of all the remaining RAF personnel in the Peloponnese once the other senior officers had left Greece by air. Over the next few days he succeeded in evacuating by sea and air more than a thousand men, in large and small groups, to the island of Kythera and hence to Crete, where Lee and his rearguard finally arrived on 30 April. Lee's party was the last official RAF contingent to leave Greece and Lee the last RAF officer; he departed from Crete for Cairo in a Sunderland flying boat. For his services he was awarded the royal order of George I of Greece (with swords).<br>
<br>From Cairo, Lee was posted to Middle East headquarters, RAF, where he served during the Iraq revolt of April 1941 and was responsible for sending reinforcements to the RAF cantonment at Dhuban. Posted back to England as senior air staff officer at 12 group, Fighter Command, in September 1941, he was mentioned in dispatches on 1 December 1942 for his service with 12 group. In 1944 he was posted to the Balkans as second in command of the armistice control commission in Romania and became friendly with King Michael and his family. As Romania became progressively under the rule of the Communist Party, Lee decided that little more could be done and asked to be transferred. In February 1945 he was given command of the British mission in Yugoslavia. Lee commanded the RAF mission and no. 37 military mission, with advanced headquarters in Belgrade, and was the link between Field Marshal Alexander and Marshal Tito, whom he saw at least once a week. On his official visits to the former partisan leader, Lee, who had been promoted air vice-marshal on 13 June 1945, found him initially friendly, but considered that he returned from a visit to Moscow, a &#145;different man&#146;  (Lee, <span class="italic">Fly Past</span>, 195), very pro-Soviet and critical of Britain and the USA. The position of the British and American missions became untenable; with Tito's agreement they decided to withdraw. Tito was nevertheless grateful for the help he had received from the British mission and the RAF during the war and sought to award decorations to some fifty people, of all ranks, in recognition of this, but the British government delayed granting permission for twenty-five years, until the breach with Yugoslavia was healed and Tito was finally allowed to confer his wartime awards. Lee was awarded Yugoslavia's highest war decoration, the partisan star with golden wreath.<br>
<br>Lee retired from the RAF in 1946 and took up a new career as a writer. He published four autobiographical works, all of high quality: <span class="italic">Special Duties</span> (1946), an account of his service in the Balkans, Turkey, and the Middle East; <span class="italic">No Parachute</span> (1968), his letters written in 1917; <span class="italic">Open Cockpit</span> (1969), on his First World War service in the RFC; and <span class="italic">Fly Past</span> (1974), reminiscences of his flying career. He also wrote an account of the royal house of Greece (1948), biographies of King Michael of Romania (1950), Helen, queen mother of Romania (1956), Robert Dudley, earl of Essex (1964), and Samuel Franklin Cody (1965), and, under the name Arthur Lee Gould, a novel, <span class="italic">An Airplane in the Arabian Nights</span> (1947).<br>
<br>Lee's first wife, Gwynneth, died in 1951, and on 15 January 1953 he married Winifrid Hilda (Fay) Atkinson, the widow of Squadron Leader M. R. Atkinson, who had been killed in air operations in 1942, and the daughter of Frederic William Molteni, an accountant. In 1972 Lee accepted the presidency of Cross and Cockade International, the society of First World War aero historians. He was a stockily built man of medium height, invariably cheerful and affable, and always ready to discuss aspects of the First World War in the air and his own experiences as a young fighter pilot in that war. He died on 21 May 1975 in King Edward VII's Hospital for Officers, Marylebone, London.<br>
