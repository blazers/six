<span class="headword">Barnsley family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1885&#150;1987), <span class="occ">architects, designers, and craftspeople</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_38544"></a><span class="headword">(Arthur) Ernest Barnsley</span>  (1863&#150;1926), <span class="occ">architect and designer</span>, and <a name="cosubject_38545"></a><span class="headword">Sidney Howard Barnsley</span>  (1865&#150;1926), <span class="occ">architect and furniture maker</span>. Ernest Barnsley was born on 17 February 1863, the sixth child of Edward Barnsley (<i>d</i>. 1881), builder and manufacturer, of Birmingham and his wife, Amelia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Heeley (?); Sidney Barnsley was the seventh and last child, born on 25 February 1865. Edward Barnsley was one of the partners in John Barnsley &amp; Sons, one of the city's most successful building firms. Wesleyans in belief, prosperous, in touch with the city's intellectual &eacute;lite, the Barnsley family shared in the progressive, civic culture of late Victorian Birmingham. It is not known exactly where Ernest and Sidney went to school, but in 1879 Ernest was articled to J. L. Ball, a young Birmingham architect, and Sidney may have joined him there later. They both attended classes at the city's School of Art.<br>
<br>In 1885 they both went to London, where Ernest Barnsley worked, first for W. H. Seth-Smith, and then for J. D. Sedding, while Sidney Barnsley joined the office of Richard Norman Shaw. Both Seddings and Shaws were leading architectural offices of the day, alive with the new ideas of the arts and crafts movement. Here the Barnsley brothers formed lasting allegiances: in Shaw's office with W. R. Lethaby and Robert Weir Schultz, and in Sedding's with Ernest Gimson who came, like them, from a background of industrial wealth and progressive thought in the midlands. Gimson would soon be inseparable from their lives. Ernest Barnsley left Sedding's office in 1887 and set up in practice on his own in Birmingham, marrying Alice Mary Townsley (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1863) on 28 February 1888. Sidney Barnsley left Shaw early in 1888, and spent much of the next two and a half years in Greece with Schultz, studying Byzantine architecture at Lethaby's suggestion. (The fruits of his study can be seen in the beautiful little church of the Wisdom of God at Lower Kingswood in Surrey, which he designed on his return. His drawings for the church, together with relevant photographs, are in the possession of the Fine Art Society, London.) Gimson left Sedding's office at about the same time and spent two wandering years, sketching, looking for a cottage in the country, worrying about the prospect of working in an architectural office, and learning to make chairs and plasterwork with his own hands.<br>
<br>Late in 1890, or early in 1891, Gimson, Lethaby, the newly returned Sidney Barnsley, two slightly older architects, Mervyn Macartney and Reginald Blomfield, and Stephen Webb, a designer, set up a cabinet-making workshop in London, to make furniture to their designs, under the name Kenton &amp; Co. It produced some fine furniture, but closed down some time in 1892, leaving Sidney Barnsley so shocked by the taste of the cabinet-makers when left to themselves that he decided never to employ craftsmen, and almost always made up his own designs. Later that year he and Gimson decided to leave London and settle in the country. There is little documentary evidence of the spirit in which this decision was taken, but it turned out to be the most important decision of their lives, a journey to be followed by no more journeys. Their purposes have usually, and perhaps not wrongly, been inferred from what followed.<h2>
<a name="ErnestandSidneyBarnsleyintheCotswolds"></a>Ernest and Sidney Barnsley in the Cotswolds</h2>Ernest Barnsley was persuaded to join them, against his wife's inclination, and in April 1893 they settled temporarily in the hamlet of Ewen, near Cirencester, in the Cotswolds. In 1894 they leased Pinbury Park, a sixteenth-century house standing by itself above the valley of the River Frome, 5 miles north-west of Cirencester. The property was repaired and altered for their occupation, an outbuilding was turned into a workshop, and they began to work, thinking of the countryside as the home of the crafts, hoping to gather others round them. The Barnsleys made heavy case-furniture (for example, cabinets and chests) in oak, with features borrowed from wagons and farm implements, while Gimson made light ladderback chairs and decorative plasterwork. Sidney Barnsley was the most focused of them. Lucy Morley (<i>d</i>. 1944), a relation of Gimson's who kept house for them and married Sidney Barnsley in 1895, would take over their elevenses and find Sidney working away and the other two standing by, whistling tunes from Gilbert and Sullivan. The Barnsley brothers were very different. Sidney was slight and shy; designing furniture and making it from start to finish seemed to be all in all to him. (Gimson came to have something of the same intensity.) Ernest was a big, jolly, expansive man, practical, easy-going and something of a bon vivant. All three must have seemed socially incongruous in the country, half-gentry half-workmen, but Ernest was the one on whom &#145;the county&#146; left their cards.<br>
<br>By about 1900 Pinbury Park was getting too small for them. Ernest Barnsley now had four children and Sidney two. In 1900 Gimson married Emily Thompson. In the same year, Gimson and Ernest Barnsley went into partnership to produce furniture, but when they hired cabinet-makers from London and elsewhere they had to put them in a workshop in Cirencester. (Sidney Barnsley remained outside this project, working on his own.) In 1902, by agreement with their landlord, Lord Bathurst, they set up workshops in the outbuildings of the medieval and seventeenth-century Daneway House in the nearby village of Sapperton, using the house itself for showrooms, and built themselves houses in the village, paid for by Lord Bathurst in exchange for their unexpired lease. At Pinbury, Gimson had been unsure of his direction, cushioned (as they all were) by inherited wealth, and also occupied with his architectural work. Now he began to design furniture with energy and concentration. But within a few years a disagreement arose between him and Ernest Barnsley which destroyed their partnership and soured the country idyll. It is not clear whether it was a business or a domestic matter. But it drove a wedge between the three families, and from this time on Gimson and Sidney Barnsley, who were dear friends, were unable to meet in each other's homes.<br>
<br>After the disagreement Ernest Barnsley designed no more furniture. His later work is all architectural: mostly, small domestic buildings in the locality, designed in a reticent version of seventeenth-century Cotswold stone building, and one very large one. In 1909 the Hon. Claud Biddulph, a banker, commissioned Barnsley to build a house on his estate at Rodmarton, south of Cirencester. For Biddulph and his wife Margaret the house was not just a dwelling but an opportunity to provide employment on their estate, and Barnsley's design was built, so far as possible, from local materials by the estate workmen. The interior was furnished to designs by Ernest and Sidney Barnsley and others, and again, much of the work was carried out by local labour. The house took&#151;as it was meant to take&#151;a long time to build, and Rodmarton Manor was not finished until 1929, after Ernest Barnsley's death.<br>
<br>In Sapperton, Sidney Barnsley built a house for his family with big oak floorboards and whitewashed walls. In the garden he built a workshop with a wonderful view across the valley, where he worked each day by himself, producing tables and case-furniture. Some were simple oak pieces, others more sophisticated in making and materials, and none of them easily distinguishable from Gimson's work, except that Barnsley liked to set himself the challenge of difficult construction. As his work became known, there was no shortage of orders and in that sense the workshop paid for itself; but, like Gimson, he could afford not to charge realistically for his own time and overheads. His two children, <a name="cosubject_66038"></a><span class="headword">(Emily) Grace Barnsley</span>  (1896&#150;1975), <span class="occ">pottery decorator</span>, and <a name="cosubject_65171"></a><span class="headword">(William) Edward Barnsley</span>  (1900&#150;1987), <span class="occ">designer and craftsman</span>, were born at Pinbury Park on 3 October 1896 and 17 February 1900 respectively. Family life was simple but sociable, despite the fact that their mother had been deaf since the age of nineteen. Looking back, Edward felt that he would have liked to have seen more of &#145;Big Uncle&#146; as they called Gimson, but the feud made that difficult. As a girl Grace was taught to paint pottery by Alfred and Louise Powell who lived in Oakridge nearby, Alfred an architect in the Gimson&#150;Barnsley mould, Louise a skilful embroiderer and calligrapher. Together, the Powells developed a graceful leafy style of painting on pottery and worked for many years in collaboration with Wedgwoods at Stoke-on-Trent. The young Edward, as one might expect, learned woodworking from his father.<h2>
<a name="GraceandEdwardBarnsley"></a>Grace and Edward Barnsley</h2>In 1910 the children were sent to school at Bedales in Hampshire, whose progressive ethos matched that of the arts and crafts movement; Gimson and Alfred Powell both had connections with the school. In 1914 Grace attended Birmingham Municipal School of Art, and by 1916 she was decorating Wedgwood pottery with delicate patterns of flowers and foliage in the manner of the Powells. She worked in this way during the 1920s and 1930s, though she was never directly employed by the firm. Her brother was not so sure what he should do after school, partly because his father told him he could never earn a living as a furniture maker. In 1919 he was apprenticed to Geoffrey Lupton, an idealistic Old Bedalian who worked as a builder round Petersfield; with Lupton, Edward Barnsley spent about a year helping to build the new library at Bedales, which had been designed by Gimson. He learned more from this than he did from the year he then spent at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. In 1923 Lupton asked Edward to take over his joinery workshop at Froxfield, which he did; and in 1925 Lupton offered it for sale. Sidney Barnsley bought the property for his son and thus settled that Edward should, after all, do what his father had done. On 12 December the same year Edward married Tatiana Hedvig (Tania) Kellgren, and they left the church under an archway of handsaws.<br>
<br>The Barnsley brothers were still working at Sapperton, though by 1924 the effort of woodworking had become too much for Sidney. Gimson had died in 1919, and his work was handsomely celebrated in a memorial volume, which made only passing mention of the Barnsleys. Sidney Barnsley was philosophical about the book, but in truth the record had been distorted. The whole Cotswold project had depended on the skills of sociable, business-like Ernest Barnsley, while in their ideals for architecture and the crafts, Gimson and Sidney Barnsley were twin spirits. Part of Gimson's achievement was the creation of a tradition of neo-rural designing and making, and that was also the Barnsleys' achievement. Ernest Barnsley died in Sapperton on 6 January 1926 and Sidney some months later, on 25 September. They were buried with Gimson in the churchyard at Sapperton. About 300 of Sidney Barnsley's drawings for architecture and furniture, together with a drawing by Edward Barnsley and photographs by Herbert Barnsley of the Barnsleys' homes and work, are at Cheltenham Art Gallery and Museum, Gloucestershire.<br>
<br>On 3 March 1926, between her uncle's and her father's death, Grace Barnsley married Oscar Caradock Davies (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1894), son of the rector of Sapperton, who was an officer in the merchant navy. They were not ready to set up a home of their own, and Grace lived with her mother for some years at various addresses while working at her pottery. In the workshop at Froxfield, Edward Barnsley was doing joinery work for Geoffrey Lupton, and beginning to produce handmade furniture in the Gimson&#150;Barnsley style. Like Gimson, he worked mainly as a designer, employing seven craftsmen; though he was a good craftsman himself, he was always anxious to acknowledge their skill. His life was not an idyll of rural craftsmanship, as his father's and Gimson's were supposed to be, for he had almost no money. It was a long struggle to earn his living as a furniture maker. Warm-hearted and a little na&iuml;ve, Edward Barnsley was also insecure and prone to long bouts of depression. He believed in craftsmanship as a way of life, but was uneasy with his men in the workshop. He was happiest of all when walking alone in the Lake District. At home he preferred the solitary dialogue of writing letters, or working in the garden of the cottage where he and Tania lived, next to the workshop. They had two children, Karin (<i>b</i>. 1927) and Jon (<i>b</i>. 1930), who became an architect.<br>
<br>In 1934 Grace and Oscar Davies were finally able to settle at Rainham in Kent. They opened a caf&eacute; where they sold the products of the local Upchurch Pottery, and Wedgwood wares which Grace continued to decorate. In 1938 they took over Upchurch, renaming it the Roeginga Pottery, and here they produced sturdy earthenwares, some of which Grace decorated with floral patterns. These ventures were, however, cut short in 1939; the war brought Grace's career as a pottery decorator to an end.<br>
<br>In 1938 Edward Barnsley was appointed design adviser at the East Midlands Training College in Loughborough. Growing up in a little workshop world, he had not thought to look much beyond it; but now he went to Loughborough regularly to talk to the students about making and designing. This brought in a steady if small income. He felt at ease with the trainee teachers and over the next twenty-five years built up a tradition of craft skills at the college. Then, during the Second World War, he was drawn into craft politics and all the difficulties of creating a public face for the crafts. He was involved in the campaign which led, in 1950, to the establishment of the Crafts Centre of Great Britain with its London showroom in Hay Hill, Mayfair, and in attempts in the 1960s to create a craft quango, like the Arts Council and the Council of Industrial Design. It is hard to say whether all his letter-writing, the long committee meetings in London, and the late trains home advanced the cause, but he was driven to them by his belief in craftsmanship. And they were a stretching of his abilities, an exercise of the middle years.<br>
<br>There were changes in the Edward Barnsley workshop after the war. Bert Upton, who had worked in aircraft production, was appointed foreman and was eager to use more woodworking machinery. Barnsley was unhappy with this development, but the savings made by machinery, especially in the preparation of wood, were too great to be resisted, especially after mains electricity reached Froxfield in the mid-1950s. And Barnsley himself introduced changes. In 1944 he had been struck by the wood-engraver John Farleigh saying that craftspeople had grown too severe and sad, that they should try to catch the temper of the times. His work never ceased to be, like his father's, a celebration of wood and workmanship, but his designs of the 1950s were lighter, looking more to eighteenth-century models.<br>
<br>Through all this Edward Barnsley held to the values of William Morris and the arts and crafts movement. He was delighted in the 1960s and 1970s with the growing historical interest in Gimson and the Barnsleys: more long letters, more working over the difficult and fruitful past. But, on the other hand, he was dismayed when craft began to be whimsical and think of itself as fine art. This trend became obvious at the &#145;Craftsman's Art&#146; exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1973; at the opening, Edward Barnsley could be found elsewhere in the museum, consoling himself with the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>Grace Davies (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Barnsley) died in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, on 6 March 1975, and was buried in Petersfield, Hampshire. By that time it was becoming increasingly difficult for Edward Barnsley to run his workshop. His clients and admirers were concerned that the workshop might close down, and in 1980 the Edward Barnsley Educational Trust was established to run an apprenticeship scheme within the workshop; it now owns and runs the workshop as well. As he became more vague and forgetful, it distressed him to be where he had worked for so many years. He spent the last months of his life in a hospital in Portsmouth, the dogged, self-critical, generous, and always striving spirit cancelled out for much of the time by Alzheimer's disease. Edward Barnsley died on 2 December 1987 and his ashes were buried in his parents' grave in the churchyard at Sapperton.<br>
