<span class="headword">Latham, Sir  John Greig</span>  (1877&#150;1964), <span class="occ">politician and judge in Australia</span>, was born on 26 August 1877 in Ascot Vale, then an outlying suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, the eldest of five children (four sons and a daughter) of Thomas Latham, a native-born tinsmith, and his Scottish-born wife, Janet Scott. He was brought up in the Melbourne suburb of Ivanhoe.<br>
<br>Thomas Latham served as a JP and local councillor, as well as secretary of the Victorian Society for the Protection of Animals, which he founded. He was a devout Methodist who instilled into his children an ethos of hard work and moral rectitude, discernible in John Latham throughout his life. From Gore Street primary school in Fitzroy, inner Melbourne, the serious, studious boy won a scholarship to Scotch College, one of the trio of prestigious private schools set up in Melbourne along denominational&#151;in its case Presbyterian&#151;lines. From there a scholarship took him to the University of Melbourne; he graduated BA in 1896 with high distinction in philosophy and logic. Following a period teaching at Hamilton Academy, a private school in rural Victoria, he returned to the university, where he graduated LLB in 1902. He was admitted to the Victorian bar in 1904 and commenced practice in the following year. On 19 December 1907 Latham married, in a Methodist ceremony, Eleanor Mary 
    (Ella; <i>d</i>. 1964)
  , daughter of Richard Tobin of Northcote, Victoria. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Briefs came slowly, and between 1904 and 1920 Latham combined his legal work with teaching at the university: first as resident tutor in logic and philosophy at one of its constituent colleges, then as lecturer in inductive and deductive logic, and finally as lecturer in the law of contract and personal property. He also supplemented his income by writing for the <span class="italic">Argus</span>, the more conservative of Melbourne's two morning dailies, and in 1908 became Australian correspondent of the staunchly imperialistic London <span class="italic">Standard</span>. He served as secretary of the Imperial Federation League's Victorian branch and joined the Victorian group of the Round Table, the think-tank set up by Viscount Milner to explore the link between motherland and dominions. Having rejected his father's Methodism, Latham assisted in 1907 in setting up an Education Act Defence League to oppose teaching scripture in Victoria's state schools. Two years later he helped to found the Rationalist Society of Victoria and subsequently served as its president; until his death he was connected with its successor body, the Rationalist Association of Australia.<br>
<br>When the First World War broke out Latham volunteered for service and simultaneously held commissions in both the army and navy. In 1915 he became secretary of the Victorian branch of the Universal Service League, crusading vigorously for conscription. Two years later, in the wake of allegations of sabotage in Australia's naval dockyards, he was appointed head of naval intelligence with the honorary rank of lieutenant-commander. As staff officer and adviser to the Australian minister for defence, Sir Joseph Cooke, Latham attended the Imperial Conference in London in 1918. In 1919 he went to the Paris peace conference as assistant secretary of the British empire delegation and as British secretary of the inter-allied commission on Czecho-Slovak affairs. He took part in framing the various classes of mandate, including that under which Australia became responsible for New Guinea. He was also attached to a subcommittee of a commission dealing with the League of Nations, and as such became convinced of the need for Australians to be better informed regarding international affairs. In 1920 he was appointed CMG for his services overseas.<br>
<br>Having returned to the bar in 1919, Latham saw his practice expand. He specialized in taxation and commercial and arbitration issues, yet important constitutional cases came his way. In 1922 he took silk. In the previous year, owing to his growing involvement in public affairs, he declined appointment as a judge of Victoria's supreme court. Before the war he had been an activist in Alfred Deakin's Liberal Party and in 1918 considered entering federal politics as a National Party member. At Versailles he had conceived an enduring personal and political detestation for prime minister William Morris Hughes, and in 1922&#151;campaigning as an independent Liberal Union candidate with the slogan &#145;Hughes must go&#146;&#151;he won the federal seat of Kooyong and entered the house of representatives. There the rural-based Country Party held the balance of power; Latham was invited to its deliberations to plot the downfall of Hughes, who resigned early in 1923. Latham's entry into parliament entailed substantial financial sacrifice, and he seemed ill-suited by temperament and attitude for the political maelstrom. He was scholarly, with an austere, aloof manner; he unswervingly refused to compromise his principles for the sake of pragmatism or popularity; he had no empathy with machine politics. That he did not return to the bar once his aim of removing Hughes was accomplished is attributable to his abiding sense of public duty. In debate he commanded from the outset respect for his cogency. But the legacy of voice and elocution lessons taken to overcome a childhood stammer was a stilted, high-pitched way of speaking better suited to a law court than to a parliamentary chamber: it was much ridiculed. Eventually he managed to vary his tone and peppered his speeches with dry witticisms.<br>
<br>In 1925 Latham joined the Nationalist Party, whose leader, prime minister Stanley Melbourne Bruce, appointed him attorney-general. As such, Latham demonstrated strict impartiality, and he accompanied Bruce in 1926 to the Imperial Conference in London, where he almost collapsed through overwork. He also led the Australian delegation to the League of Nations general assembly in Geneva. As seen in his book <span class="italic">Australia and the British Commonwealth</span> (1929), comprising lectures delivered during 1928 at the University of Queensland, he took a cautious approach to the Imperial Conference's attempt to redefine formally the relations between Britain and the dominions. In the federal election of 1929, against a background of worsening economic recession and industrial strife, the Australian Labor Party led by James Scullin was swept to power. Bruce was unseated, and the Nationalist presence in the house of representatives depleted. Latham's sense of public duty induced him reluctantly to accept leadership of the opposition. Harrying the government relentlessly, especially on its inability to fulfil its promises to the electorate, he proved remarkably effective.<br>
<br>Beset by the great depression and dissension in its ranks, the government suffered a setback with the defection of a prominent figure, Joseph Aloysius Lyons, and four Labor colleagues; they left the party in 1931, having supported a narrowly defeated motion of no confidence in the Scullin administration introduced by Latham. Lyons subsequently became associated with the extra-parliamentary and avowedly non-partisan All for Australia League, the most important among several organizations of concerned citizens formed to counter left-wing extremism with its perceived threats to Australia's security, institutions, and links with Britain. The Nationalists, realizing that they were in danger of being eclipsed by the league as a political force, decided that they should co-operate with Lyons, and authorized Latham to ask Lyons and Country Party leader Earle Page if they would agree to form a single opposition party, with one leader and a common programme. Page demurred, but Lyons agreed, accepting Latham's offer of its leadership on condition that the Nationalists unanimously concurred. This they did, and Lyons's praise for Latham's readiness to place the nation's welfare above his personal aggrandizement was widely echoed in non-Labor circles.<br>
<br>The resultant United Australia Party was formed in May 1931 and, having won the December federal election, took office in January 1932 with Lyons as prime minister. Latham&#151;deputy prime minister, attorney-general, minister for external affairs, and minister for industry&#151;played a major part in formulating policy. Among his contributions were the <span class="roman">Financial Agreement Enforcement Act</span>, the <span class="roman">Crimes Act</span>, and the <span class="roman">Transport Workers Act</span>. He ensured that certain sections of the statute of Westminster should not apply to Australia until specifically endorsed by the federal parliament (which occurred under John Curtin's Labor government in 1942). In 1932 he represented Australia at the League of Nations and attended the Geneva disarmament conference as well as the Lausanne conference on reparations. He was appointed privy councillor in 1933. A steadfast champion of the white Australia policy, he was nevertheless keen to develop his nation's links with south-east Asia and in 1934 led a goodwill mission to countries of that region, the first such tour undertaken by an Australian minister for external affairs. Latham retired from politics later that year and was appointed GCMG. He became chief justice of the high court of Australia in October 1935 and served until April 1952. From 1940 to 1941 he concurrently held the post of Australian minister to Japan, but since he arrived in Tokyo after that nation's pact with the axis powers had been concluded his effectiveness was blunted. As chief justice he took a strictly legalistic view of constitutional problems and was deeply interested in constitutional reform, especially in the industrial sphere. He was much concerned with issues relating to the defence power of the federal government in war and in peace. Sometimes, as in his final important case, the <span class="italic">Communist Party Case</span> of 1951, his judgment differed from that of his colleagues. Following his retirement he testified before the joint committee on the constitution (appointed 1956, reported 1958).<br>
<br>Latham died in the Melbourne inner suburb of Richmond on 25 July 1964. Despite his rationalist views, the cremation was preceded by a funeral service at Wesley Church. His wife had predeceased him by four months. Of his children, Richard Thomas Edwin (1909&#150;1943), a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, and author of <span class="italic">The Law and the Commonwealth</span> (1937), was killed while serving in the Royal Air Force; Winifred Mary (Freda) died in 1953; and Peter Greig, a lieutenant-colonel, survived him.<br>
