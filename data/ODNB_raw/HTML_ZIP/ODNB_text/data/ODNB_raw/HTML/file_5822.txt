<span class="headword">Cokayne, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1519&#150;1592), <span class="occ">soldier and huntsman</span>, was the son of Francis Cokayne of the family of Cockaine, which for generations had owned estates at Ashbourne, Derbyshire, and his wife, Dorothy Marrow. Brought up in the household of Francis Talbot, fifth earl of Shrewsbury, Thomas came into his inheritance at the death of his father on 5 August 1538. The following year he was admitted to Gray's Inn. About 1540 he married Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1595), daughter of Sir Humphrey Ferrers of Tamworth, who was his stepfather. Sir Humphrey's eldest son, John Ferrers, married Barbara Cokayne, Thomas's sister. Thomas and Dorothy Cokayne are known to have had seven daughters and three sons.<br>
<br>In 1544 Cokayne accompanied Edward Seymour, earl of Hertford, in the expedition to Scotland and was knighted at Leith on 11 May after the taking of Edinburgh. On 26 May 1547 his name appears for the first time on the commission of the peace for Derbyshire. He was with the forces sent to the relief of Haddington under George Talbot, sixth earl of Shrewsbury, named on a muster of 13 August 1548 as one of the captains selected &#145;For the Battaile&#146;. The following year he was pricked for sheriff of Derbyshire, a position he filled also in 1559, 1569, 1579, and 1585. In 1587 he was one of the attendants on Mary, queen of Scots, on her journey &#145;with but a small trayne&#146; as far as Derby, as she travelled towards her final imprisonment at Fotheringhay.<br>
<br>From 1583 Cokayne helped found the grammar school at Ashbourne, donating &pound;18 and granting to it a yearly charge of &pound;4 out of his estate, though it is clear that one Thomas Carter of the Middle Temple was the main mover and financier of the foundation. Raphael Holinshed, author of the famous chronicles, was a steward on an estate neighbouring Cokayne's manor of Pooley in Polesworth, Warwickshire, and is reported to have been a frequent visitor at Pooley. Though &#145;a professed hunter, and not a scholler&#146;, as he himself remarked, Cokayne was enough of the latter to write a manual on his passion: <span class="italic">A Short Treatise of Hunting</span> (1591), dedicated to Gilbert Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury. The book contains illustrations of the fox, the hare, and the stag and deals with the practical arrangements for hunting. Its preface to &#145;gentlemen-readers&#146;, dated from Ashbourne, 31 December 1590, argues that &#145;hunters by their continual travail, painful labour, often watching, and enduring of hunger, of heat, and of cold, are much enabled above others to the service of their prince and country to the wars&#146;. It draws attention to the role of hunting in protecting the countryside &#145;from the hurt of foxes and other ravenous vermine&#146; despite &#145;the carping speeches of the enemies thereof&#146;.<br>
<br>Cokayne was buried on the night of 15 November 1592; his widow died at Derby on 21 December 1595. Both were interred at Ashbourne church in a tomb once described as &#145;a stately mural monument of marble, in the Renaissance style&#146;  (Cox, 2.386). Pevsner is more prosaic: &#145;Thomas Cokayne buried 1592, standing wall monument; rusticated pillars below, the figures lifesize and kneeling, facing each other across a prayer-desk; pilasters left and right with much strapwork; arch above the figures; the children in the predella below&#146;  (Pevsner, 44).<br>
