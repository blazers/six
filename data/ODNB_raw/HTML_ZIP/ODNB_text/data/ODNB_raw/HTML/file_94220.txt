<span class="headword">Squire,  Raglan Hugh Anstruther</span>  (1912&#150;2004), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 30 January 1912 at 10 Warltersville Road, Islington, London, the eldest of the three sons and one daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36227/', "Sir John Collings Squire (1884&#150;1958)")</script>, poet and literary editor, and his wife, Eileen Harriet Anstruther, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilkinson (1884&#150;1970), elder daughter of Anthony Anstruther Wilkinson, rector of Hintlesham, Suffolk. He was educated at Blundell's School in Devon and St John's College, Cambridge, where he studied architecture. After gaining practical experience by working in a builder's yard, then in various architects' practices, he qualified as an architect in 1937, at the Regent Street Polytechnic. On 17 December 1938 he married Rachel Margaret Atkey (1914&#150;1968), the daughter of James Frederick Haynes Atkey, solicitor, of Oxshott, Surrey; they had two sons. In 1938&#150;9 he served as secretary of the Architecture Club (founded by his father) and in 1940 he became secretary of the Royal Institute of British Architects' reconstruction committee. During the Second World War, from 1942 to 1945, he served with the Royal Engineers.<br>
<br>Together with Rodney Thomas and Edric Neel, Squire designed the prefabricated Arcon house, of which 39,000 were built in the immediate post-war period, as part of the temporary housing programme. Intended to have only a ten- to fifteen-year lifespan, the last of these dwellings was eventually pulled down in 2000. Between 1945 and 1956 he worked on the Eaton Square conversion scheme for the Grosvenor estate, converting all the houses around the square into flats. He was amused that the most expensive resulting properties, the glass-fronted penthouses on the top floors, had once been the servants' quarters. In 1948, with Brenda Rawnsley (the widow of Derek Rawnsley), he chartered an aeroplane and flew to France to persuade leading artists, including Picasso, L&eacute;ger, Braque, Dufy, and Matisse, to design posters for the <span class="roman">School Prints</span> series (which Derek Rawnsley had initiated, and of which Squire was now chairman). In the same year he founded Raglan Squire &amp; Partners, architects.<br>
<br>Over the next thirty-three years Squire worked prolifically on a diverse range of architectural commissions, in all parts of the world. His original designs were strikingly modernist in appearance, but he was equally adept at conversions or (when required) more classically influenced designs. In 1951 he was associate architect for the acclaimed Transport Pavilion at the Festival of Britain exhibition. In 1953&#150;6 he designed the new Rangoon University engineering college, in independent Burma (which included an unusual umbrella-shaped roof laminated with local teak, to keep out the sun and the rain but ensure adequate ventilation). In 1955 he produced a town planning scheme for Mosul in Iraq, and also a report on the development of Baghdad airport. The practice designed factories in Weybridge and Huddersfield, and office buildings in London, Croydon, Eastbourne, Bournemouth, Bahrain, and Singapore (where he founded an offshoot of the practice, later hived off and renamed RSP). Squire also designed hotels in Tehran, Bahrain, Abu Dhabi, Jakarta, Tunis, and Nicosia (all for the Hilton chain), and in Malta, Singapore, Gibraltar, and Jamaica. A rare unbuilt design was his winning submission (with Robert Matthew) to the international competition in 1957 for a mausoleum in Karachi for Mohamed Ali Jinnah. The design, which consisted of six hyperbolic paraboloids in concrete, forming a vast star-shaped pavilion over the tomb, was highly regarded by his fellow architects, but eventually rejected by Jinnah's sister, who hoped &#145;for something a bit more like the Taj Mahal&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 9 June 2004).<br>
<br>Following the death of his first wife Squire married, on 27 December 1968, Delia Bridget Lawless (<i>d</i>. 1997), a 54-year-old secretary, and daughter of John Lawless, police officer; and, on 23 October 1997, Mabel Elizabeth Stones, a 74-year-old retired hotelier, and daughter of Adam Smyth, police officer. He retired in 1981, but remained a consultant to Raglan Squire &amp; Partners, which continued to produce a wide range of architectural and town planning designs. In 1985 he published his autobiography, <span class="italic">Portrait of an Architect</span>; he also continued to write articles for the technical press on architecture, architectural education, and town planning. His recreations included gardening, chess, ocean racing, and designing small yachts (he was a member of the Royal Thames Yacht, Royal Ocean Racing, and Royal Southern Yacht clubs, and his firm designed the acclaimed Hamble Marina in Hampshire). He died on 18 May 2004 at Partridge House nursing home, Heath Hill Avenue, Brighton, Sussex, of a chest infection and myocardial degeneration; he was survived by his third wife, Mabel, and the two sons of his first marriage.<br>
