<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Oswald</span> <span class="st"> [St Oswald]</span>  (603/4&#150;642), <span class="occ">king of Northumbria</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8908/', "&#198;thelfrith (d. c.616), king of Bernicia")</script> and later of the Northumbrians, and his wife, Acha, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/199/', "&#198;lla, king of Deira")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Irishexileconversionandseizureofpower"></a>Irish exile, conversion, and seizure of power</h2>Following &AElig;thelfrith's death in battle against Acha's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8567/', "Eadwine")</script>, who thus became king of both regions of Northumbria, Oswald was exiled at the age of about thirteen with his six brothers, including Eanfrith and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20930/', "Oswiu")</script> (also Oslac, Oswudu, Oslaf, and Offa), and took refuge from his uncle in Scotland and Ireland.<br>
<br>During his exile Oswald learned to speak Irish fluently and is recorded as fighting on behalf of his hosts in Ireland, together with other Bernician nobles. While, with the exception of Eadwine, all the rulers of Bernicia and Deira up to that point had been pagan, Oswald was converted to Christianity at this time, and was probably baptized at the Columban monastery of Iona on the west coast of Scotland, in the Irish colony of D&aacute;l Riata. Both Bede and Adomn&aacute;n, in his life of St Columba, show that Oswald maintained strong ties with Iona after he became king.<br>
<br>Oswald and his brothers were refugees for seventeen years, until King Eadwine, who had been converted to Christianity by a mission from Canterbury led by Paulinus, was overthrown in 633 by an alliance between the British king Cadwallon of Gwynedd and Penda of Mercia. Oswald's brother Eanfrith then became king in Bernicia for a year until he also was killed by Cadwallon; Osric of Deira, a cousin of Eadwine, was killed within the same year. One of Eadwine's sons had been slain along with his father, and another, Eadfrith, was taken hostage by Penda. Eadwine's widow, &AElig;thelburh, and his remaining descendants fled with Bishop Paulinus to her brother's court in Kent.<br>
<br>In 634 Oswald returned from exile and avenged his father and brother in battle with Cadwallon near Hadrian's Wall, at a place known to Bede as Heavenfield and in British sources as Cantscaul. Cadwallon was killed near a stream called the Denisesburn (probably the Rowley Water, near Hexham), and Oswald became ruler of Bernicia at the age of thirty. He later reported to S&eacute;g&eacute;ne, abbot of Iona, that this victory had been achieved through divine help, and that he had been granted a vision of St Columba before the battle, although there were only twelve baptized Christians in his army. By the time that Bede wrote, almost a century later, Oswald was said to have set up a cross before the battle, which he held firm until his soldiers fixed it in position, and then prayed with them for God's aid. A wooden cross at Heavenfield later became a focus for pilgrimage and miracle stories, but this image of devotion to the cross may suggest that Bede wished to portray Oswald as another Constantine.<br>
<br>Since most of the Deiran royal family had been killed or exiled, Oswald was able to take control of both kingdoms for eight years. Eadwine's son Eadfrith, who had been taken hostage by Penda, was murdered. This may have been at Oswald's instigation, since it brought Penda no political advantage. Eadwine's widow, &AElig;thelburh, also felt her children and grandchildren threatened by Oswald and by her brother the king of Kent, again presumably at Oswald's instigation, and sent them abroad for protection. Oswald's influence can be shown to have later extended into several kingdoms south of the Humber, and he is the sixth king named in Bede's list of rulers who held sway (<i>imperium</i>) in this area. He was hated as an alien conqueror in Lindsey, and he also ruled over Sussex. He stood godfather to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6988/', "Cynegils of Wessex")</script> at his baptism <i>c</i>.635, and married his daughter. He and Cynegils are named as joint donors of Dorchester-on-Thames to Bishop Birinus as an episcopal seat. His overlordship is also said by Bede to have included the Picts and the Scots to the north, and an entry in the Irish annals suggests that Edinburgh, the centre of the kingdom of the Gododdin, fell to the Angles during his reign, in 638.<h2>
<a name="Christianking"></a>Christian king</h2>Apart from Adomn&aacute;n's version of what Oswald is supposed to have told the abbot of Iona about the battle of Heavenfield, and brief entries reporting his battles in the Irish and Welsh annals and in the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span>, where he is nicknamed Lamnguin (Brightblade), all that is known of Oswald's life is derived from Bede, who was writing eighty-eight years after the king's death, when legends had already begun to accumulate. Oswald is one of the great heroes of Bede's <span class="italic">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</span>, but very little is reported there about his secular career. His wife, the daughter of Cynegils of Wessex, is not named, and it only emerges in later chapters that he had a son, Oethelwald, who became king of Deira in 651 and allied with his father's killer, Penda, against his uncle Oswiu.<br>
<br>Bede's principal interest in Oswald is his role in the conversion of Northumbria, and the miracles associated with him after his death. Since Paulinus's mission had collapsed with the death of Eadwine and his subsequent retreat to Kent, Oswald sent to Iona for a bishop to convert his people. Following the failure of the first candidate, a second bishop, &Aacute;ed&aacute;n, was consecrated. Oswald donated to him the tidal island of Lindisfarne, which lay a short distance up the coast from the royal palace at Bamburgh, for his monastery and episcopal seat. Apart from Oswald's own background of exile among the Irish, it is probable that he did not wish to revive the Canterbury mission associated with the Deiran royal family, which was now in exile, though it is reported that he completed the church that Eadwine had started to build at York.<br>
<br>Bede ascribes to Oswald the Christian virtues of faith, humility, charity, and concern to establish the church. He was willing to act as interpreter for &Aacute;ed&aacute;n, and stood godfather to his father-in-law, Cynegils. He is said to have prayed at length in a distinctive way, with his palms upward, and when he was killed in battle, he was remembered as having said a prayer for the souls of his army, though not his opponents. Alcuin later claimed that he built and richly endowed many churches. Bede's most famous story emphasizes his generosity to the poor. While Oswald was holding a feast on Easter day, at which Bishop &Aacute;ed&aacute;n was present, a servant, with the official duty of providing for the needy, told the king that there was a press of people outside demanding alms. Oswald immediately ordered that the food should be taken out to them, and that the silver dish being used at the meal should be broken up and distributed. Bishop &Aacute;ed&aacute;n thereupon blessed his right hand, saying &#145;may this hand never perish&#146;  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 3.6).<h2>
<a name="Deathandcult"></a>Death and cult</h2>Oswald was killed at the age of thirty-eight in battle against Penda of Mercia and his British allies on 5 August 642, at a place named by Bede as &#145;Maserfelth&#146;. In British sources the site is variously given as &#145;Cocboi&#146;, &#145;Cocboy&#146;, or &#145;Cogwy&#146;. This has been taken to be Oswestry in Shropshire, on the border between Mercia and Powys, since Reginald of Durham described the site in the twelfth century, although this identification has been disputed and other names, which place the battle in Lancashire or Lindsey, put forward. Oswald's body was ritually dismembered by the pagan Penda, and his head, arms, and hands displayed on stakes. A year later his brother and successor, Oswiu, came with an army and took these trophies back to Bernicia. Oswald's head was buried within the church at Lindisfarne, and his arms taken to St Peter's Church in the royal palace at Bamburgh. His right hand was found to be undecayed, in fulfilment of Bishop &Aacute;ed&aacute;n's prophecy, and was placed in a silver casket. Writing almost a hundred and fifty years later, Alcuin recorded that the hand was still supple, with nails that continued to grow. A chronicle entry in the <span class="italic">Historia regum</span> under the year 774 later noted that the hand was still in the church at Bamburgh, wrapped in a pall and placed in a costly shrine.<br>
<br>Although Bede does not claim that Oswald died a martyr's death, in the eighty-eight years between the battle and the time that Bede was writing, <i>c</i>.730, various popular legends had grown up around the site of his death. Bede records three miracle stories associated with this place, showing how the cult of Oswald's sanctity developed: in the first of these a horse is cured of convulsions by rolling on the ground; the owner of the horse then recognizes that a holy person has died at this place; and a girl is therefore cured of paralysis by being brought to the spot in a cart. The place is distinguished by the greenness of the grass there and becomes famous as a source of cures, which are transmitted through dust taken from the spot, to the extent that a hole is dug to the height of a man. It is not implied that Oswald was buried here, only that his blood had soaked the ground.<br>
<br>Parallel with this popular cult are three other miracle stories, which are associated with Hexham. Bede records that the monks undertook a pilgrimage each year, on the day before the anniversary of the king's death, to the wooden cross which Oswald had set up before the battle of Heavenfield in 634. (This cannot have taken place before the foundation of the monastery at Hexham by Wilfrid thirty years after Oswald's death, and may be an ecclesiastical takeover of a popular cult.) Splinters from the cross placed in water were said to have effected cures of both men and cattle, although Bede also gives the example of a Hexham monk cured of a fractured arm by moss taken from the wood of the cross. Bishop Acca of Hexham reported two more miracle stories to Bede, of a man in Ireland cured of the plague through drinking water flavoured with a splinter taken from the stake on which Oswald's head was displayed, and of the monastic community at Selsey in Sussex, again founded by Wilfrid, all but one of whom were spared from the plague by Oswald's intercession on the anniversary of his death, some forty years before, which the monks thereafter observed as a feast day.<br>
<br>The remains of Oswald's body were retrieved about half a century after his death by his niece <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20909/', "Osthryth")</script>, King Oswiu's daughter, after she married King &AElig;thelred of Mercia and became queen, probably at some time between 675 and 679. It is not known what had happened to the body before this, after the head and arms had been cut off in 642. The bones were taken on a cart to the monastery of Bardney in Lindsey, but owing to the hostility of the monks, who remembered Oswald as an alien oppressor, these remained outside overnight under a tent. Bede records that a pillar of light above the tent was seen by both the local inhabitants and the monks, who therefore recognized Oswald's sanctity and allowed the body inside. The bones were then washed and enshrined within the church, beneath the king's gold and purple banner. Bede records two other miracles associated with Oswald's shrine here, in both of which a sick person was healed: one of a boy with an ague who spent a night by the shrine, the other of a monk from a neighbouring monastery who was cured by some dust which had absorbed the water used to wash Oswald's bones.<br>
<br>Despite Queen Osthryth's murder by the Mercians in 697, Oswald's body remained at Bardney, and the shrine was later adorned by the Mercian king Offa (<i>r</i>. 757&#150;96) with &#145;silver, gold, gems and much finery&#146;, as Alcuin records  (Alcuin, 35). This surprising Mercian royal interest in Oswald's sanctity was subsequently continued in the tenth century by &AElig;thelfl&aelig;d, lady of the Mercians, and her husband, &AElig;thelred, who retrieved Oswald's bones from Bardney, which was by that stage within the Danelaw, and removed them to the church of St Peter at Gloucester in 909. They were translated again after the Norman conquest to a new shrine in Gloucester by Thomas (II), archbishop of York. But in the twelfth-century life of Oswald by Reginald of Durham, it is claimed that the bones of the body at Bardney had been reduced to three, as a result of the eagerness of relic hunters, and the only items taken to Gloucester were the left arm and some hair.<br>
<br>Reginald also records that the hand at Bamburgh had become neglected by the eleventh century, though this may be propaganda to justify the actions of a monk named Winegot, who stole the arm and took it to his own monastery at Peterborough in the time of Abbot Elsin (<i>d</i>. 1055). It is said to have been saved from the Danes in 1070 by Prior &AElig;thelwold, who hid the arm in his bed. It was subsequently recorded at Peterborough in 1140 by the chronicler Hugh Candidus, where it was inspected by the bishop of Lincoln and others, and said to be still intact, with both flesh and skin.<br>
<br>Oswald's head appears to have remained in the church or cemetery at Lindisfarne for over two centuries, without being credited with any miracles, until the community of St Cuthbert was forced to leave the island in the face of Danish attacks, <i>c</i>.875. Reginald of Durham gives an alternative story, which has the head removed to Bamburgh by Oswald's relatives after being revealed by a miraculous light, although it was later retrieved from there by guile. Symeon of Durham says that Oswald's head was taken from the island inside the reliquary coffin of St Cuthbert, and Reginald similarly says that it was placed there after its retrieval. A skull with a sword cut was identified as that of Oswald when the tomb of St Cuthbert at Durham Cathedral was opened in 1104 for the translation of his relics. Oswald's head was said to be the only other skull placed in the new shrine. When the tomb of Cuthbert was reopened by James Raine in 1827, a piece of skull in poor condition was identified as Oswald's. The tomb was opened again in 1899 by William Greenwell, and at that stage a detailed debate occurred about the medical condition of the skull. The evidence, subsequently reviewed by Richard Bailey, shows that a skull with a sword cut was identified and returned to the shrine, and this is almost certainly that of Oswald. As a result of this association, in post-conquest iconography St Cuthbert is usually shown carrying St Oswald's head.<br>
<br>The growth of Oswald's cult in England can be followed in the increasing number of references in calendars and martyrologies, in various recastings of Bede's chapters on his life and miracles (in particular the extensive treatments in Alcuin's York poem in the late eighth century and &AElig;lfric's homily in the late tenth century), as well as in numerous post-conquest writings. In addition, a major cult developed on the continent, particularly in Germany, the Low Countries, Switzerland, Italy, and Scandinavia. The beginnings of this can be seen in Bede, where the Anglo-Saxon missionary Willibrord is said to have told Acca and Wilfrid that many miracles linked to Oswald's relics had occurred among the Frisians. Oswald's feast day was noted in the eighth-century calendar associated with Willibrord and several sites in Europe later claimed to hold relics of Oswald, including at least four possible heads and several arms. The development of the cult on the continent moves far away from the historical figure of Oswald, and cannot be reviewed here, but it has been the subject of much modern research. The standard image in later continental iconography shifts from St Oswald carrying a covered cup, based on Bede's story of his charity, to an image of the saint with a raven, which sometimes carries a ring, derived not from Bede but from a Middle High German romantic epic, the <span class="italic">M&uuml;nchener Oswald</span>.<br>
