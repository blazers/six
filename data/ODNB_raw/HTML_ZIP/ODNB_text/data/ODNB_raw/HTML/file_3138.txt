<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boyle,  Roger</span>, first earl of Orrery  (1621&#150;1679), <span class="occ">politician and writer</span>, was the twelfth child and third son to survive of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3133/', "Richard Boyle, first earl of Cork (1566&#150;1643)")</script>, and his second wife, Catherine Fenton (<i>c</i>.1588&#150;1630). He was born at the family's principal seat of Lismore Castle, co. Waterford, on 25 April 1621. Thanks to his father's standing as the largest proprietor in the southern part of the province of Munster, the boy was ennobled as Baron Broghill on 28 February 1628. The title derived from the estate in the north of co. Cork with which his father endowed the youth. In 1630 Broghill entered Trinity College, Dublin, but by 1632 had removed to England. There, on 17 March 1636, he was admitted into Gray's Inn, at the same time as an elder brother, Lewis, Viscount Kinalmeaky. Soon afterwards he departed on a continental tour under a French protestant, Isaac Marcombes. As well as travelling through France and Italy, he lodged for a time in Geneva with the Calvinist theologian Diodati. These experiences deepened Broghill's attachment to the protestantism already strong in his family. They also introduced him to contemporary continental culture, which later influenced his writings, his architectural projects, and his interests in military theory and practice. On his return to England he gravitated towards a smart court set. His entry into it was eased by his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3135/', "Richard Boyle, later first earl of Burlington")</script>, already familiar with this world, and by Broghill's own suavity. His father sent him to attend the king at Berwick as he prepared to fight the Scots in 1639. The standing within England of Broghill and his family was further acknowledged&#151;and enhanced&#151;when, on 27 January 1641, he married Lady Margaret Howard (1623&#150;1689), a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13938/', "Theophilus Howard, second earl of Suffolk")</script>. She came with a portion of &pound;5000. This helped towards the purchase of an estate at Marston Bigod in Somerset, which would prove convenient as he shuttled regularly between England and Ireland.<h2>
<a name="WarinIreland"></a>War in Ireland</h2>Either shortly before or after the outbreak of the rising in October 1641 Broghill returned to Ireland. Much of the defence of his own and his relations' property fell to him. He soon showed his mettle as soldier and politician. In part through a ruse he repulsed the force which was besieging his father's castle at Lismore in February 1642. In November 1642 he sailed to England with his elder brother Dungarvan to solicit supplies and reinforcements. In July 1643 he returned to organize defences. Nominally subordinate to the provincial commander, Inchiquin, he continued to be employed on missions to the English parliament. In July 1644 he and Inchiquin explained publicly that they could no longer be bound by the truce which the lord lieutenant, Ormond, on behalf of Charles I, had signed the previous September with the insurgents. The Munster leaders turned to the English parliament to relieve them in their extremity. Broghill was now appointed governor of the port of Youghal, much of which was owned by the Boyles. In 1645 he was commissioned as a general of horse in the province, and in December that year deputized for Inchiquin. Increasingly, the latent rivalry between the two generals expressed itself in open disagreements over tactics. Broghill regarded Westminster, where he had long-standing and close links, as the best hope of relief for protestant Ireland. He backed the appointment by parliament of Philip Sidney, Viscount Lisle, as viceroy and commander in Ireland in 1646. Lisle belonged to the political grouping at Westminster in which Broghill had friends and relations. Under Lisle he could reasonably expect his own standing to rise and the plight of Munster to be alleviated. Lisle's commission affronted the king's own lieutenant, Ormond, and alarmed Inchiquin. In 1647 the latter defected to the beaten Charles I. As a consequence, divisions among Munster protestants widened ominously. Personally Broghill gained from his parliamentarian affiliation. In February 1648 he was granted &pound;2000 towards his arrears of pay, and the following month was appointed master of the ordnance. But Lisle's expedition failed in its larger aims, leaving the protestants of south Munster still vulnerable to the Catholic forces.<br>
<br>By 1649, with the king executed and Cromwell with an army campaigning in Ireland, Broghill was expected to dissociate himself from the new order and follow his brothers Richard (now second earl of Cork) and Francis (later Viscount Shannon) into foreign exile. Instead, in circumstances which have always been surrounded with mystery and even fantasy, he was persuaded, seemingly by Cromwell himself, to serve the revolutionary regime. Irish protestants like Broghill, whose holdings had been overrun by the insurgent Catholics throughout the 1640s (and earlier), reckoned that only England could secure their return and guarantee their secure enjoyment for the future. Any incumbent English regime, even when it had originated in regicide, if able to aid protestant Ireland, could be accepted and supported. Now that a Commonwealth had been established, Broghill did not scruple to enlist its backing for a campaign to restore himself and his protestant neighbours to what they had lately lost. The personal intervention of Cromwell with Broghill, a story which originated with the latter's chaplain, was hardly needed to persuade him where his interests now lay. On behalf of the new English republic, he threw himself into soldiering across a terrain that he knew intimately. He helped the English commanders to victory in their southern Irish campaigns. In April 1650 he had the satisfaction of assisting in the defeat of his former ally and commander Inchiquin. At Macroom in co. Cork he captured the Catholic bishop of Ross, Boetius MacEgan, a notable warrior. He also joined in the protracted siege of Limerick, alongside Ireton. He was again rewarded: in February 1651 he was made lieutenant-general of the ordnance and was granted sizeable tracts of confiscated lands with a yearly yield of &pound;1000. These grants promised to ease, but did not end, the chronic indebtedness which beset him. Like so many of his protestant neighbours in Munster, deprived of the bulk of his rents throughout the war, he had resorted to desperate expedients, including the mortgaging of his Somerset property. The cumulative effects of these financial devices dogged him for much of the 1650s, and encouraged compromises with a regime which might assist.<h2>
<a name="Awiderstagethe1650s"></a>A wider stage: the 1650s</h2>Radicals within the English army and Irish administration doubted the firmness of Broghill's attachment to their cause, and lost no chance to asperse him. They worried lest he&#151;and through him his extensive kindred and clientele among the settlers established before 1641&#151;secure disproportionate influence. They feared, too, that he might blunt the edge of the reforming government in Dublin. Others, notably the new ruler of Ireland from 1655, Henry Cromwell, were more favourably impressed. So, seemingly, was Oliver Cromwell. In March 1655 Broghill was appointed for a year to head the civil government of Scotland as lord president of the council in Edinburgh. Without any discernible Scottish links, he tackled this brief energetically. Foremost among his tasks was the need to win over the Presbyterian clergy, the more intransigent of whom still prayed publicly for Charles Stuart. Using diplomacy, blandishments, and bullying, he quietened the implacable. But, at best, the calm was temporary. Broghill, nevertheless, acquired clerical contacts which he valued. In 1660, when measures in Ireland, England, and Scotland had to be synchronized, he exploited his Scottish informants. Moreover, his knowledge of their principles made him sympathize with their predicament after 1660. In Edinburgh as lord president he attempted to build a coalition among locals friendly towards the Cromwellian protectorate. This quest paralleled what Henry Cromwell, who regularly sought his advice, was attempting in Dublin, and may have prefigured the calculations of the group that offered Oliver Cromwell the crown in 1657.<br>
<br>In 1654 and 1656 Broghill was elected to the Westminster parliament for co. Cork. In 1656 he had also been returned for Edinburgh, for which he preferred to sit. In preparation for his own and his allies' returns he had demonstrated his forte for electioneering. Within the parliaments his skills as manager and as deviser of constitutions were displayed. Irish protestants, a minority, needed pliancy both to protect their vulnerable privileges and to exert an influence greater than their small numbers would merit. This flexibility marked his political approach to settling the three nations in the aftermath of war, reconquest, and regicide. Unusually among his contemporaries he knew each of the three at first hand. The wars had given him the chance to operate in this larger arena. But he did so sequentially rather than simultaneously. Even at a time when Britain and Ireland were united, throughout much of the 1650s, the practical impossibility of maintaining a presence in each country defeated even the most energetic like Broghill. His stay in Scotland was brief and his impact there limited, but he retained a better sense of problems in civil society and the church common to all the Cromwellian and Stuart territories.<br>
<br>Stability and prosperity were his lodestones. In the parliament of 1654&#150;5, which included representatives of Scotland and Ireland, he was one of those who sought&#151;unavailingly&#151;to avert a collision between the republicans and the supporters of the Cromwellian protectorate. Outspoken as a critic of rule by the military, adopted during the experiment of the major-generals between 1655 and 1656, he advocated kingship. This device was intended to win over to Cromwell more of the political &eacute;lites on which government had relied before 1642. He had already moved the regime in Scotland in this direction, through conciliation of local civilians. Henry Cromwell, in Dublin since the summer of 1655, under Broghill's prompting also explored this approach. The hope was that, once Oliver Cromwell had become king, he too would be backed by the propertied in England and Wales, and could reduce his political dependence on the soldiery. Cast down when, in May 1657, Cromwell refused the kingly title, but not the rest of the settlement in &#145;The humble petition and advice&#146;, he retired to his Irish estates. These had recently been augmented by the belated passage of an ordinance which conferred on him confiscated properties in co. Cork, including Blarney Castle and Ballymaloe. This bounty, worth well in excess of &pound;1000 annually, had first been proposed in 1651 but was authorized only on 26 June 1657.<br>
<br>Broghill was soon cajoled back into public life by, among others, Henry Cromwell. In January 1658 he took his place in the Cromwellian second chamber, the other house. It was rumoured that he might be added to the council of state, but was not. After Richard Cromwell succeeded his father as protector in September 1658, Broghill's power grew. English radicals within the army disliked&#151;and perhaps exaggerated&#151;his role. By July 1659 these adversaries again controlled the government, in Ireland as well as in England. Now back in south Munster, he lost his military commands. He bided his time, too wily to reveal his thoughts and contacts. He imposed a similar discipline on his followers in Ireland, lest they jeopardize all by any premature display of preferences.<h2>
<a name="Restorationpoliticianandprotestantleader16601679"></a>Restoration politician and protestant leader, 1660&#150;1679</h2>Others acted in Dublin to oust the English republicans and to summon a representative assembly in February 1660. Broghill's importance within his native country was recognized, not just by his return for both co. Waterford and Dublin University to this assembly. In January 1660 he had been named by the restored Rump in London as one of its three commissioners to rule Ireland. In the Dublin Convention he diverged from other protestant leaders, notably his fellow commissioner Sir Charles Coote, in his Fabian tactics. Not until Charles II's return had become a certainty did he unequivocally endorse it. He was reluctant to have the king restored unconditionally. Nor was he enthusiastic about allowing the episcopalian Church of Ireland its pre-war pre-eminence. In danger of falling behind the unsullied royalists, in May 1660 he hurried to London. There his voice, stridently hostile to Catholics and the Irish, added to the clamour to retain the essentials of the Cromwellian land settlement. Broghill, and those whom he represented in southern Ireland, had gained much from the recent redistributions, and were reluctant to surrender their booty. He ingratiated himself with the king, who, on 5 September 1660, advanced him to the Irish earldom of Orrery. Thanks to his wife's family, the Howards, he was elected for Arundel to the Westminster Convention of 1660 and the 1661 parliament. On 10 October 1660 he was entrusted, as lord president, with the government of his home province of Munster. On 26 October he was once more a member of the trio to which, as lords justices, the care of Ireland was deputed. In this capacity he implemented much but determined little, since the vital decisions were taken in London. He concealed his own misgivings as he enforced legal conformity to the re-established state church and harassed dissenters, particularly the Scottish Presbyterians of Ulster. He was obliged to order the return of their old properties to a few favoured Catholics. He was mortified when, with the arrival in July 1662 of the lord lieutenant, Ormond, he was relegated to his regional presidency. Ormond, the king's man in Ireland throughout the 1640s, personified an unswerving loyalism; Orrery apparently the opposite. To these differences was added a personal antipathy, masked behind civilities. He scarcely concealed his contempt for his apparently indolent and insouciant superior, whose talents, he believed, were surpassed by his own.<br>
<br>In addition to the lord presidency, on 22 June 1662 Orrery was commissioned as sergeant-major-general. He was further entrusted with the government of the strategically sensitive city of Limerick and co. Clare. Interpreting his remit broadly, he felt empowered to interfere in any matter which might touch the safety of protestant Ireland. He repeatedly contrasted his own vigilance with Ormond's culpable neglects. He made play with the dense web of kinship which tied Ormond to many Catholic notables. Eager to demonstrate his importance, he refashioned his seat on his north co. Cork estate and renamed it Charleville. Later he was reckoned to have spent &pound;20,000 on these works. Not only did he hold his presidential court there, he aspired to transform the newly incorporated borough into a model of what other settlers might achieve. He founded a school to which the sons of the provincial squirearchy were enticed. Foreign artisans, mostly protestant refugees from the Low Countries and France, were installed in the hope of reviving the depressed textile industries. These prestigious operations resembled those undertaken by his rival Ormond. But for Orrery, as a younger son, such lavish expenditure overtaxed his resources. His income, from lands and offices, seldom exceeded &pound;4000 p.a. Clandestine opportunities for enrichment certainly abounded in the 1650s and 1660s, and it was widely assumed that he availed himself of them. In 1668 it was alleged that he had received over &pound;44,000 from two separate sources. Yet, by the lax standards which prevailed in seventeenth-century Ireland, such profiteering was regarded as a matter of pride not shame. In the main he spent what he received on sustaining the magnificent equipage as a regional potentate rather than enlarging permanently the fortune of his family.<br>
<br>Orrery used his office in Munster to demonstrate how the affairs of protestant Ireland should be conducted. The province, with its long and remote coasts, might be surprised by the Dutch, French, or privateers. Accordingly, he enjoined watchfulness on underlings. He attended closely to the internal affairs of the boroughs under his charge, many of which contained settlers who had arrived only in the 1650s and who might incline to republicanism or religious dissent. He was equally wary of the Catholics, still by far the largest component in the local population. He strenuously opposed moves to readmit them to a share of their former properties and power. His care, justified by the vulnerable situation of Munster, was also intended to point up the casualness with which Ormond treated international and domestic threats. By 1666, with a risk of invasion by the French, he was urging military preparedness. He put faith in locally recruited militias, to be composed exclusively of protestants. These would perpetuate the military arrangements that had underpinned the original plantations in Munster in the time of his father, and revived an idea that he had put to Henry Cromwell.<br>
<br>A shrewd self-publicist, Orrery intended that his own assiduity should be contrasted with Ormond's supposed neglects. These comparisons were intended to strengthen his claims on the Irish viceroyalty. Driven by envy of Ormond, he abetted those, in England and Ireland, scheming to topple the lord lieutenant. In particular, he struck up a tactical alliance with the restlessly ambitious second duke of Buckingham. In 1669 they triumphed. Yet the dismissal of Ormond did not bring Orrery to power, as he had hoped. Rumours had circulated that he might even be appointed to a great office of state (such as the lord chancellorship) in England. Instead, he too was attacked. In November 1669 moves to impeach him were begun at Westminster. Alleged misconduct in the government of Munster was the main charge. He trounced his accusers. But the episode revealed how isolated and insecure he had become. Another sign of declining repute came with the suppression on 30 July 1672 of the Munster presidency. He was consoled with a generous pension and other marks of status, and retained a military command. Reassured that no personal slight had been meant, nevertheless it was clear that he was out of step with a movement more friendly towards the Catholics. Henceforward he lacked a formal position, other than as peer, privy councillor, and army officer, from which to shape policy. However, this did not silence him. He monotonously accused those responsible for Ireland of misunderstanding its needs. Moreover, he carried his message into England, where between 1674 and 1676 he attended the Commons.<h2>
<a name="Ideaswritingsandcharacter"></a>Ideas, writings, and character</h2>Soon after Charles's restoration Orrery had countered the lobbying of the Irish Catholics hopeful of regaining their lost property and influence. In 1662 he published two tracts, <span class="italic">The Irish Colours Displayed</span> and <span class="italic">An Answer of a Person of Quality to a Scandalous Letter</span>, in which he rebutted the contention of a Catholic apologist, Peter Walsh, that many of his co-religionists had loyally supported the Stuarts. This issue of loyalty to the dynasty was one well calculated to embarrass the pliant Orrery. He reverted to it in his plays, several of which were performed in the 1660s. His ability to express&#151;and sometimes to create&#151;the anxieties of the beleaguered Irish protestant minority gave him a larger role. The protestant interest, both as idea and actuality, owed much to his unscrupulous industry. In his formulation the earlier construct of &#145;the English of Ireland&#146; to denote those loyal to English authority evolved into one in which confession&#151;protestantism&#151;not ethnicity was the defining quality. In time, and assisted by Orrery's descendants, such as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3127/', "Henry Boyle, first earl of Shannon")</script>, the idea of the protestant interest underwent a further transmutation: into the Irish protestant ascendancy of the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>The vigour and fluency with which Orrery advanced the opinion that the Irish protestants were the only secure foundation for English rule in the island established him as the foremost spokesman for that interest. Furthermore, he had acted on his beliefs. He steered his neighbours through the hazards of the confederate wars and the Cromwellian occupation. He busied himself in the 1650s and 1660s to secure material advantages not just for his immediate family, but for the larger protestant community. He first realized the electoral potential of the Boyles' huge possessions in co. Cork and co. Waterford. In the successive elections of 1654, 1656, 1659, 1660, and 1661 his activities can be detected. His circumspect elder brother Cork willingly deputed this task to his more adept junior. His political aptitudes, glimpsed occasionally in his dealings with the Long Parliament, were perfected in the interregnum. Diplomacy was needed to achieve even a limited understanding with the warring Presbyterian ministers in the Scotland of the mid-1650s. Managerial and rhetorical dexterity was evident as he organized the enthusiasts for kingship at Westminster in 1657. The same can be sensed in his handling of the Dublin Convention in the spring of 1660. In the Irish parliament of 1661&#150;6 he boasted how he led a cohort of &#145;Orreronians&#146;: at least twenty-five members for Munster constituencies. They formed the nucleus of a larger following through which he could guide hesitant MPs into enacting the controversial Restoration settlement. The lord lieutenant, Ormond, was happy to let him act as his undertaker in the parliament. These tastes of power left him embittered when, after 1672, he was denied his formal primacy as lord president of Munster or any adequate outlet for what he regarded as his transcendent abilities.<br>
<br>From the 1640s Orrery, like other protestant lobbyists from Ireland, encouraged the English and Irish authorities to act on the axiom that confession was now the surest index of political reliability. He identified religious differences as the dynamic in the troubled recent history of Ireland. This opinion was encouraged by his reading, experiences, and reflection. He subscribed to the widespread view that Catholicism, both as political doctrine and as theological system, undermined society. He was suspected of exaggerating Irish Catholics' untrustworthiness and inflating the fears of Irish protestants to further his own career, yet, in his analyses of past and present troubles in Ireland, he treated of more than confessional differences. Conquest, and the resultant expropriation of the older vintages of landowners (almost invariably Catholics), embittered the defeated. These grievances, he predicted, would never vanish. The Catholic majority would watch for a chance to reverse the decision of recent wars, so that the utmost vigilance would henceforward be required. Orrery, in his military, administrative, and private capacities, exercised it. When necessary, he used spies, double agents, and deceit. It was alleged, indeed, that he kept a spy in the king's bedchamber, Ned Progers, who purloined and passed to his paymaster confidential letters from the likes of Ormond. He also insisted that the settlers in Munster stay on alert and that he, even after he had been deposed as lord president, should keep armaments at his houses.<br>
<br>For the same reasons, Orrery tried to prevent the readmission of Catholic traders into the walled towns in 1672&#150;3. But such exclusions no longer suited either the English government or the Irish economy. His strident denunciations of the official indulgence of the dangerous reached a crescendo during the Popish Plot, when his old rival, Ormond, again ruled the kingdom. Even those who shared his apprehensions were wearied by the monotony and shrillness with which he voiced them. One by one he estranged leading politicians of his time, not only Clarendon and Ormond, but those closer to him in outlook, such as Essex and Shaftesbury. His unremitting anti-Catholicism grated on the king. Appointed to the English privy council in 1665, he was removed in April 1679.<br>
<br>Orrery owed much of his contemporary and later celebrity to his voluminous writings. He published poems, a lengthy romance, <span class="italic">Parthenissa</span>, in the French mode, as well as his plays. <span class="italic">Parthenissa</span>, never completed, occupied its author intermittently from the 1640s onwards. The dramas attracted the notice of contemporaries, being performed to acclaim in London and Dublin. From the 1630s he had mingled easily with writers: first Suckling and Davenant, later&#151;in the 1650s&#151;Cowley, and then (during the 1660s) Katherine Phillips. Dryden admired his rhymed dramatic couplets. His easy command of literary genres fitted well with his self-projection as courtier and wit. For a time he stood high at the courts of Charles I, his son, and Henry Cromwell. But his vanities and jealousies tarnished his reputation. In the plays themes of honour, loyalty, and betrayal suggested that, despite their sometimes exotic settings&#151;Sicily for <span class="italic">The General</span>, Hungary for <span class="italic">Mustapha</span>, and in <span class="italic">Tryphon</span> the history of the Maccabees&#151;they expressed the dilemmas that had beset him during his tortuous career. Although imitative of the modes of the age, and ironically derivative from French models at a time when he scorned France, their fluency excited admiration. The same virtuosity, schooled in the adolescent travels and later campaigning, led him to write a pioneering <span class="italic">Treatise on the Art of War</span>, published in 1677. Typically he bragged that it was the first comprehensive manual in English. A second volume was intended, but, if finished, was never printed. He may also have contemplated a fuller history of his times. Stimulated in the mid-1670s by the renewed interest in the controversial passages of the 1640s, he had the leisure to compose such an account. Arthur Annesley, earl of Anglesey, an erstwhile collaborator, engaged on a similar design, enquired after his death about his manuscripts. Nothing is known to have survived.<br>
<br>Towards the close of his life, incapacitated and in pain after a botched operation to ease his gout, Orrery composed devotional poems on the chief festivals of the churches of England and Ireland, which would be published posthumously. As he prepared for death, he subscribed to a conventional protestant orthodoxy. Nevertheless, he was still worried enough about the mounting Catholic menace to advocate protestant union. He entrusted his school at Charleville to a nonconformist minister ejected from his English parish. In addition he kept in touch with the veteran dissenter Richard Baxter and his schemes to comprehend orthodox presbyterians. In Ireland especially, the protestant presence was too puny readily to tolerate internal divisions, which could only hearten the Catholics. Ever the polymath, he also designed buildings. The grandiose seat at Charleville may have resulted from his fertile brain. The Charles Fort, commanding the entrance to Kinsale harbour, also owed much to his architectural skills. It further embodied his obsession with the physical defence of Ireland; here against possible Dutch or French invaders. Yet, Ormond received more praise than Orrery for erecting the bastion. He died at his second home in co. Cork, Castlemartyr, on 16 October 1679 and was interred two days later in the family vault at Youghal.<br>
<br>Constantly overshadowed or thwarted by others whom he regarded as less capable, Orrery's tactlessness alienated the important and probably cost him the highest offices. A contemporary recorded why he was regarded so ambivalently. His vanity &#145;would not let him be content with what he had of the king's favour unless he held it with ostentation&#146;. Thus, when ill in London, he had persuaded the king publicly to visit him in his lodgings, and so attracted admiring attention which flattered his self-esteem. His &#145;devising head&#146; and &#145;towering wit&#146; were turned to destructive ends and left him with a sorry reputation for duplicity. &#145;He certainly had many qualities of a great man, affable, eloquent, liberal and stout, but he wanted sincerity and as he was still aspiring to be uppermost gave himself no rest but was intriguing to the world's end&#146;  (&#145;Account of Restoration politics&#146;, Dublin Public Libraries, Gilbert MSS 207, pp. 12&#150;17; 227, p. 246).<br>
