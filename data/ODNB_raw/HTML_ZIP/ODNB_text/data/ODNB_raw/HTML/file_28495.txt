<span class="headword">Walker,  John</span>  (1692/3&#150;1741), <span class="occ">classical and biblical scholar</span>, was, according to the admission registers of Trinity College, Cambridge, the son of Thomas Walker of Huddersfield. The entry for his admission to Trinity College as a pensioner on 24 May 1710 also records that he had been educated at Wakefield School under Mr Clark (Edward Clarke) and that he was aged seventeen. A search in the parish registers in the West Riding of Yorkshire provides only one baptismal entry that could be his. A John, son of a Thomas Walker, was baptized in Hartshead parish church on 14 October 1694. If this is the same person who was admitted to Trinity aged seventeen, he was born in 1692 or 1693. In 1731 Slaithwaite Free School received an endowment by the terms of the will of a Thomas Walker of Huddersfield, salter, dated 9 May 1719. The surname is a common one in the area, and that this is the subject's father can hardly be expressed as more than a possibility.<br>
<br>Walker's Cambridge career was a successful one. He graduated BA in 1713, and was elected a minor fellow of his college in 1716. He took his MA in 1717. He should not be confused with his two contemporaries at Trinity, Richard Walker, the vice-master, and Samuel Walker. Walker's preference was for collaborative research, to which he brought considerable learning as well as a pleasant personality. The only evidence of an independent publication is his projected edition of the Christian apologist Arnobius. Both the first and the last of his works to be published were contributions to the work of others. The first was a set of emendations to Cicero's <span class="italic">De natura deorum</span>, printed at the end of the edition by Dr John Davies of 1718. The last consisted of some notes which he had prepared on Cicero's <span class="italic">De officiis</span> which were incorporated by Zachary Pearce into his edition of 1745. The emendations, which show a wide range of reading, are mostly bold or ingenious conjectures after the manner of Richard Bentley. Bentley also had been a pupil at Wakefield, and their education and scholarly interests were to continue to coincide. Walker was to provide Bentley with variant readings in manuscripts both of Suetonius and of Cicero's <span class="italic">Tusculan Disputations</span>. But the greatest part of his assistance to Bentley was in <span class="roman">New Testament</span> work. In fact, assistance is rather too weak a word, as the end of Bentley's <span class="italic">Proposals for Printing</span> (a new edition of the Greek and <span class="roman">Vulgate</span> <span class="roman">New</span> testaments published in 1720), makes clear:<blockquote>The Overseer and Corrector of the Press will be the Learned Mr. John Walker of Trinity-College in <i>Cambridge</i>; who with great accurateness has collated many MSS. at <i>Paris</i> for the present Edition. And the Issue of it, whether Gain or Loss, is equally to fall on Him and the Author.</blockquote>In the summer or autumn of 1719 Walker went to Paris on Bentley's behalf, in order to collate Latin and Greek manuscripts of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. Walker was received kindly at Paris, especially by the Benedictines. He seems to have remained in Paris for almost a year. Collations of fourteen Latin manuscripts at Paris are extant, the whole <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in five, and part of it in nine others. He also noted the readings of four Tours manuscripts collated by L&eacute;on Chevallier, which were given him by Sabatier. These collections are contained in Trinity College, Cambridge Library, B.17.5.<br>
<br>The following year (1721) Walker returned to Paris, to concentrate on Greek manuscripts. The readings of manuscripts from various collections now to be found in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale that are contained in the Trinity College volume B.17.42, 43 probably belong to this period. Plague in Paris in the winter of 1721&#150;2 drove Walker to Brussels. A letter describing this removal suggests that he may have been travelling with Lord Preston, either as his chaplain or in his entourage. During this stay he collated further manuscripts, including a Greek <span class="roman">New Testament</span> then in the library of a convent at Corsendonck near Turnhout, now at Vienna (&Ouml;sterreichische Nationalbibliothek, MS suppl. Gr. 52; Gregory-Aland 3), and succeeded in identifying many of the manuscripts used by Lucas Brugensis. When the epidemic had abated, Walker returned to Paris, and seems to have remained there until 1723.<br>
<br>Walker's work on Arnobius must have taken shape in these years. Of this, as he wrote in the letter already quoted, there is &#145;only one MS. in the world, which is lodged in the library of the King of France [now Bibl. Nat. Lat. 1661], and which I have often seen and examin'd there&#146;. During his visit to Brussels, he discovered and collated a second manuscript (now Brussels, Bibl. Royale 10846&#150;7), which is now generally regarded as a copy of the Paris manuscript. Two quarto volumes containing these collations, as well as notes and conjectures, along with other notes, were left in his will to Dr Richard Meade. One of these volumes subsequently came into the hands of J. E. B. Mayor.<br>
<br>At about this time Walker became friends with William Wake, archbishop of Canterbury, and after his return to England, he received a series of ecclesiastical preferments. He became dean and rector of Bocking, Essex, in the archbishop's patronage, on 15 November 1725. At Lady day 1726 he received his last dividend as fellow of Trinity. He became chancellor of St David's on 17 July 1727. He was made DD under royal commission (together with Richard Walker the vice-master) on 25 April 1728. A year later Wake appointed him archdeacon of Hereford (on 3 February 1729). In 1730 he was instituted rector of the adjacent parishes in the city of London of St Mary Aldermary and St Thomas the Apostle, both in the archbishop's patronage. He was also chaplain to George II.<br>
<br>Walker married Charlotte Sheffield (<i>d</i>. in or after 1762) on 26 January 1728, and they had six sons and four daughters. Charlotte was a natural daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25297/', "John Sheffield, duke of Normanby and Buckinghamshire (1647&#150;1721)")</script>, and Frances Stewart (<i>d</i>. 1751), who afterwards married the Hon. Oliver Lambart. Her father's will provided Mrs Walker with a fortune of &pound;6000. One of their sons went into the East India trade, another (Henry) became a fellow of King's College, Cambridge, whence he graduated BA (1757), and a third an officer in Germany, who married and had children. A fourth studied in the Temple, and then took orders.<br>
<br>Walker continued to collate manuscripts, including those acquired by Wake, now in the library of Christ Church, Oxford. Some of these collations are in Trinity College, Cambridge (B.17.42, 43 and others in B.17.34) and those of eight of the manuscripts are in a Greek <span class="roman">Testament</span> in Christ Church Library (MS Wake Gr. 35). A note by Walker at the end of the volume states that this work was carried out in 1732. He certainly went on collating Greek manuscripts until after 1735, as he entered some collations in a Greek <span class="roman">Testament</span> printed in that year (Trinity College, B.17.44, 45). Altogether, ninety-six of Walker's collations of Greek manuscripts are known, containing the whole or parts of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. It was John Wordsworth's informed opinion that his &#145;collations of Latin manuscripts are decidedly better than Bentley's, although they are not as perfect as his reputation for scholarship and his neat writing would lead one to hope&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). In the volume Wake Gr. 35, Walker wrote accurate descriptions and datings of the manuscripts, which were used by Kitchin in his catalogue of Christ Church manuscripts.<br>
<br>Walker's health was increasingly delicate, and he signed his will on 29 May 1741. He died on 9 November 1741. Mrs Walker caused to be erected a monument to him in the chancel of Bocking church where he was buried. Its laudatory character is confirmed by all the evidence. It asserts that his &#145;uncommon learning and sweetness of temper, joined to all other Christian perfections, and accompanied with a pleasing form of body, justly rendered him the delight and ornament of mankind&#146;. Mrs Walker afterwards married a Welshman named Griffiths, from whom she soon separated, resuming the name of Walker, and lived first in Bedford and then in Yarmouth. She was still living in 1762.<br>
<br>Wordsworth believed that the collapse of the projected Greek <span class="roman">Testament</span> was due to Walker's death much more than to Bentley's, since Walker continued collating at least until 1737, while Bentley seems to have turned his attention to other tasks long before. If this was indeed the case, then his early death may have deprived Walker of a place beside Mill, Tregelles, and Hort, as well as of the opportunity of anticipating Lachmann with the first acceptable replacement to the received text. As it is, Walker's place in history is as the successor of Mill in the collation of manuscripts, and as a pioneer among British scholars in studying manuscripts abroad. The degree to which he contributed to the text selected in Bentley's notes and drafts is a matter for speculation.<br>
