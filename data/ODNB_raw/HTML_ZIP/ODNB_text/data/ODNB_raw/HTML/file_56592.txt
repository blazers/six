<span class="headword">Gordon,  Lucy Christiana <span class="st"> [Lucile]</span>  Duff</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lucy Christiana Sutherland]</span>, Lady Duff Gordon  (1862&#150;1935), <span class="occ">fashion designer</span>, was born in St John's Wood, London, in July 1862, the elder of two daughters of Douglas Sutherland (1838&#150;1865), a Scottish civil engineer, and Elinor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Saunders (1842&#150;1937), who came from a prosperous Canadian family of Franco&#150;Irish descent. On Douglas Sutherland's sudden death in 1865 the family returned to the maternal home in Summerhill, near Guelph, Ontario. The household was strict, imbued with French formality, and Lucy reacted, becoming a rebellious tomboy. She expressed a nascent creativity in making clothes for her dolls and for herself, often adaptations of the quality French clothes sent by relatives. On her mother's marriage in 1871 to David Kennedy (1807&#150;1890) the family moved to England, settling in Jersey. Unable to conform to the household requirements of her stepfather, an elderly penurious invalid, Lucy left at sixteen to stay with relatives.<br>
<br>Attractive, with reddish brown hair, piquant features, and a neat figure, vivacious and strong-willed, Lucy Sutherland had many suitors but settled, rather precipitately, in 1884 on Douglas Wallace (<i>b</i>. 1844/5), a much older, socially well-connected, wine merchant. She divorced him in 1889 and moved with her only child, Esme (later Lady Halsbury), to stay with her recently widowed mother in London, supplementing their income by dressmaking from home.<br>
<br>Social contacts through her sister, the novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33428/', "Elinor Glyn (1864&#150;1943)")</script>, and Lillie Langtry, allied to genuine creative ability, turned the dressmaking into a successful business. Lucy's designs proved congenial to socially more relaxed Edwardian society and included individually styled personality dresses and luxuriously informal tea gowns. The business enjoyed continual expansion: by 1895 Lucy had moved to 24 Burlington Street, working as Mrs Lucy Wallace; from there she went on by 1898 to 17 Hanover Square, assuming the trade name of Maison Lucile in 1902, and finally to 23 Hanover Square in 1904.<br>
<br>It was at Hanover Square that Lucy realized her ideal, a prestige couture house, the prototype for her subsequent establishments. The costs involved were high&#151;the premises were redecorated in Louis XVI mode, in a scheme inspired by a close friend, American designer Elsie de Wolfe&#151;but the venture proved a success. Boasting such innovations as the Rose Room specializing in lingerie, personality mannequins, and a salon for theatrical-type fashion displays, it attracted stage and society clients. Fashionable weddings and popular theatrical productions such as <span class="italic">The Merry Widow</span> in 1907 further boosted its appeal. By 1904 a limited company had been formed. Lucy retained the design responsibility and controlling interest, but her relationship with her partners, all of whom had invested in the company, was never easy. As well as members of her own family these included Sir Cosmo Edmund Duff Gordon (1862&#150;1931), whom she married on 24 May 1900, and an accountant by the name of Miles.<br>
<br>In 1909 a branch of the firm opened in New York amid such extensive publicity that Lucy was briefly dubbed Lady Muff Boredom. It proved a great success, however. Money dresses, so called because of their cost and the style consultations with the wealthy but sartorially insecure they entailed, were very popular. Lady Duff Gordon's relationship with the popular press came under pressure, however, when she, Sir Cosmo, and her secretary, were numbered among the few survivors of the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i> in 1912. In the ensuing commission of inquiry, they were accused of bribing their way to a lifeboat and preventing its return to rescue further passengers. Although they were completely exonerated, the experience had a profound effect, particularly on Sir Cosmo.<br>
<br>The opening of the Paris branch in 1912, at 49 rue de Penthi&egrave;vre, provided distraction. An immediate success, it was popular with visiting Americans, theatrical clients, and the <i>demi-monde</i>. For Lucy it was a return to what she considered her spiritual home. Whether she received due recognition from the French couture establishment is less clear.<br>
<br>In 1914 Lady Duff Gordon returned to America for the duration of the First World War from which, unlike her immediate family, she remained detached. Until the American entry into the war in 1917, demand grew and she expanded, moving to larger premises with a separate design studio. She employed good young designers, including Edward Molyneux and Howard Greer, and her popularity was boosted by work for the Ziegfield Follies and a touring semi-patriotic fashion show. Friction with her family and business partners, however, increased: to support a very extravagant lifestyle, she began to offer clients her personal fashion services, thereby diverting considerable earnings from the company. Her association with &#145;the Boys&#146;, a bevy of young male personal assistants, in particular Genia d'Agarioff, prompted Sir Cosmo's return to Britain later in 1914. The couple never again lived together, although they continued to be business associates.<br>
<br>The opening of the Chicago branch (1915&#150;17) was in particular bitterly resisted by the other directors whose overriding ambition had become entry not into the couture but into the mass market. A foray into this area with the US mail-order firm Sears Roebuck in 1914&#150;15 proved unsuccessful, and in 1919 the partnership was bought out by John Lane Shuloff, a New York dress manufacturer, who leased back the name Lucile to the London branch. Although Lucy Duff Gordon retained a limited role as a designer, by 1924 her business was forced to cease trading.<br>
<br>As a designer, Lucy Duff Gordon had always shown creative integrity and been technically adept, working both from sketches and draping on the stand. A ruthless perfectionist, she had fine judgement of colour blending and materials. None of this or her preference for romantic or exotic styling translated easily into ready-to-wear for an austere and depressed post-war world. Except for a brief period in 1923&#150;4, when she wrote a lively column of dress advice as &#145;Dorothy&#146; of the <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span>, she retired from fashion. Her autobiography, <span class="italic">Discretions and Indiscretions</span>, was published in 1932.<br>
<br>Lady Duff Gordon lived in London from 1923 to 1935. After the death of Sir Cosmo in 1931, she benefited from the income of a trust fund set up under the terms of his will. Despite disagreements, she retained close family links. She died at a nursing home at 100 West Hill in Putney on 20 April 1935. There are fine examples of her work in the main costume collections in the UK and USA. Her significant but often unwitting contributions to the fashion industry included the anticipation of a link between the American and the European markets, as well as a systematic exploitation of publicity and an appreciation of the importance of ready-made fashion.<br>
