<span class="headword">Gray,  Sylvia Mary</span>  (1909&#150;1991), <span class="occ">businesswoman and women's institute leader</span>, was born on 3 July 1909 at 44 Clifton Road, Rugby, Warwickshire, the daughter of Henry Bunting Gray, a racquet maker, members of whose family had been rackets coaches at Rugby School since 1867, and his wife, Elizabeth Mary Frost. She was educated at Wroxall Abbey.<br>
<br>Sylvia Gray joined her local women's institute (WI) in 1929 and served as chairman of the Oxfordshire Federation of Women's Institutes from 1951 to 1954. A rural organization, based in the villages, the WI had a democratic structure, with committees elected at each of the three levels&#151;village, county, and national&#151;and Sylvia Gray was one of many members who went on to other things after gaining confidence on a WI committee. In 1935 she bought the Bay Tree Hotel, an old coaching inn in Burford, Oxfordshire, and after the war she bought a second hotel, in Moreton-on-Marsh, another Cotswold town, and formed Bay Tree Hotels Ltd. She remained chairman of the company until 1983. At the Bay Tree Hotel she employed only female staff and trained women for careers in hotel management. At the same time she began to participate in local affairs, and was a member of Witney rural district council from 1943 to 1954, the last four of these years as vice-chairman. She also chaired the board of governors of Burford grammar school. She was appointed MBE in 1952 for her services to local government.<br>
<br>After serving on the executive committee of the National Federation of Women's Institutes (NFWI), to which all the county organizations were affiliated, Sylvia Gray was elected chairman of the NFWI in 1969, the first chairman who was also a professional woman. She presided over a fundamental change in the constitution of the WI, a change she believed was the most important thing that happened during her chairmanship. Enshrined in the constitution was the rule that &#145;the character of the movement is non-sectarian and non-party political&#146;, but a resolution passed at the 1971 annual conference redefined the rule to make it clear that this should not be interpreted as preventing the village women's institutes from concerning themselves with political or religious issues, &#145;provided the movement is never used for party-political or sectarian propaganda&#146;. While some feared that the WI was becoming apathetic, there were others who knew that, with the government intruding more and more in people's lives, many WIs were already discussing what the government was doing. The conference was reminded that in times of stress Lady Denman, first chairman of the NFWI, had always said &#145;trust the institutes&#146;. Sylvia Gray anticipated that the debate on the resolution would be heated, but she knew that the WI must move with the times, sensing that &#145;the time seemed just right to rely on the common sense of the members not to allow themselves to be used for party political purposes&#146;  (Goodenough, 53). This change paved the way for the WI to comment more publicly on government legislation affecting women, especially those in the countryside, although the WI officially remained non-political.<br>
<br>At the beginning of her chairmanship, a national appeal, launched in 1965, had just reached its target of &pound;500,000, and Sylvia Gray made sure that the NFWI became aware of the need for sound financial management. In 1970 the appeal fund helped to finance the building of new accommodation and teaching blocks at Denman College, the WI adult education college, opened in 1948. She was also responsible for bringing in management consultants to advise on improvements to the administrative structure of the organization, and she created a public relations position. After the success of <span class="italic">The Brilliant and the Dark</span>, composed for the WI by Malcolm Williamson, and performed in the Royal Albert Hall in 1969 by a choir of a thousand people selected from the village WI choirs, plans were laid for a permanent WI national choir, and, with the encouragement of the conductor Anthony Hopkins, Sylvia Gray started the WI Music Society. She also inaugurated the NFWI/Green Shield Stamps tennis championship. When she retired as chairman in 1974 the membership of the WI had grown to nearly half a million.<br>
<br>Sylvia Gray was also on the executive committee of the Keep Britain Tidy Group from 1969 to 1978, chairman of the south midlands regional committee of the National Trust from 1975 to 1981, and a member of the National Consumer Council from 1975 to 1977 and of the Redundant Churches Committee from 1976 to 1984. She was appointed CBE in 1975. She died, unmarried, on 27 April 1991 at her home, St Winnow, High Street, Burford. A memorial service was held at the church of St John the Baptist, Burford, on 21 May.<br>
