<span class="headword">Shaw,  Frederick John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Brougham Villiers]</span>  (1863&#150;1939), <span class="occ">socialist and author</span>, was born on 15 November 1863 at 1 Hawthorn Terrace, Newcastle upon Tyne, the eldest child of Frederick Shaw, merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth Foster. He had four sisters, and two of his cousins also lived with the family. His grandfather Thomas Shaw and his father had done well as seed cutters with the colour manufacturers Hoyle and Robson, and the family was comfortably off (it employed several servants throughout Shaw's childhood). Until 1908 he was engaged in business, except for an interval as joint editor of the <span class="italic">Newcastle Evening News</span> and <span class="italic">Morning Mail</span>. He moved around the north-east, and lived in South Shields, Gateshead, and then Heaton. During this time he wrote a volume of poems, <span class="italic">Past and Future</span>, published locally in 1898.<br>
<br>Shaw joined the Fabian Society in 1890 and the Independent Labour Party in 1894, and he played an active role with his wife, Margaret Dorothy Shaw, in promoting the socialist and labour movements in the north-east. He wrote penny tracts on <span class="italic">Canny Newcastle and her Corporations</span> and <span class="italic">Socialism for the North</span> for local branches of the Independent Labour Party. At the turn of the century he joined the Newcastle and district Labour Representation Committee, for whom he again wrote a tract, this time on <span class="italic">Facts for Newcastle</span>. In 1907 he accepted a post with the Free Trade Union which took him first to Bradford and then to Glasgow. In 1912 he moved to London on being appointed secretary of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/45600', "Cobden Club")</script>, and soon afterwards also became secretary of the international committee to promote universal free trade. It was in the former capacity that he collaborated with Cobden's daughter to produce <span class="italic">The Land Hunger</span> as a tribute to her father.<br>
<br>Shaw wrote a number of studies of the Liberal, socialist, and suffrage movements in Britain, almost always using the pseudonym Brougham Villiers. His main ideas remained fairly constant, though the First World War, not surprisingly, altered his view of the immediate tasks before society. Before the war his main works were <span class="italic">The Opportunity of Liberalism</span> (1904), <span class="italic">The Socialist Movement in England</span> (1908), and <span class="italic">Modern Democracy</span> (1912). He adopted a sociological approach rather than a more ethical or polemical one, arguing that the viability of a policy depends less on ideas than social and economic forces, but he readily drew political conclusions from his sociology. He thought the mutual dependence of humans implies that society necessarily evolves towards ever greater solidarity, with a reasoned organization replacing an instinctive individualism. The new Liberalism and socialism were manifestations of this evolutionary process; they represented the moment of democracy conceived as the will of the average person. The way to discover the implications of this democratic moment is not to listen to politicians but to investigate the concerns of the average. Because the average constantly face the threat of poverty, the social question will dominate; because they meet this threat with trade unions and the co-operative movement, the state will respond by promoting co-operation to provide a minimum standard of life; and because they deal with poverty as a practical problem, the state will introduce this minimum standard by rule of thumb methods.<br>
<br>Shaw supported the suffragettes out of principle&#151;he edited <span class="italic">The Case for Women's Suffrage</span> (1907)&#151;but also because of the effect votes for women would have on national politics. Women would not stand for tariffs on foodstuffs, while their caring role made their political participation especially necessary at a time when the state was taking on welfare functions. After 1914 Shaw's main works were <span class="italic">Britain after the Peace</span> (1918) and <span class="italic">England and the New Era</span> (1920), the latter being his last important work. He argued the war had entailed a high level of expenditure, much geographical displacement of people, and other social changes, all of which inaugurated a revolutionary era. Whereas collectivists of the 1890s had championed an evolutionary approach to change, they now had to concentrate on the peaceful, orderly management of a revolution. In particular, he advocated a capital levy so as to restore the finances of the state, and a League of Nations overseeing demilitarization and free trade so as to ensure peace. Shaw died at his home, 18 Sudbury Court Drive, Wembley, Middlesex, on 26 June 1939; his wife survived him.<br>
