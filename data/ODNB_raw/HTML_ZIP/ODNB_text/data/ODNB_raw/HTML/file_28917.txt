<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Webb,  Benjamin</span>  (1819&#150;1885), <span class="occ">ecclesiologist and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 28 November 1819, at Addle Hill, Doctors' Commons, London, the eldest son of Benjamin Webb (<i>d</i>. 1870), of the firm of Webb &amp; Sons, wheelwrights, of London. On 2 October 1828 he was admitted to St Paul's School under Dr John Sleath, and he went on as an exhibitioner to Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1838. He graduated BA in 1842 and proceeded MA in 1845. While still a freshman, in May 1839, he was instrumental with J. M. Neale in founding the Cambridge Camden Society. Beresford Hope joined their committee the following year. In 1845 the society moved to London and became the Ecclesiological Society. As secretary, and editor of <span class="italic">The Ecclesiologist</span> from 1839 to 1868, Webb played a pivotal role in what came to be known as the Cambridge Movement, an aesthetic equivalent to the theology of the Oxford Movement. The Oxford Tractarians had aimed to revive the theological basis of the authority of the Church of England; the Cambridge ecclesiologists set out to recreate its architectural and liturgical expression. By 1854 a quarter of all Anglican parish churches in England had been &#145;restored&#146; according to Camdenian rules, by 1873 a third; and the influence of Cambridge ecclesiology was eventually felt in Anglican churches throughout the English-speaking world.<br>
<br>Webb was ordained deacon in 1842 and priest in 1843, and served as curate first at Kemerton in Gloucestershire (1843&#150;4) under his college tutor, Archdeacon Thorp (first president of the Cambridge Camden Society), and afterwards at Brasted in Kent (1849&#150;51) under William Hodge Mill, who, as regius professor of Hebrew, had encouraged his ecclesiological work at Cambridge, and whose daughter, Maria Elphinstone Mill (<i>d</i>. 1904), he married in 1847. Immediately after his marriage, Webb also became (1847&#150;9) curate to William Dodsworth at Christ Church, Albany Street, London. He did not, however, follow Dodsworth to Rome. In 1851 he was presented by Hope to the perpetual curacy of Sheen in Staffordshire, and in 1862 by Lord Palmerston&#151;again at Hope's instigation&#151;to the crown living of St Andrew's, Wells Street, London, which he retained to his death. Under his care St Andrew's became celebrated for the musical excellence of its services; it was also distinguished by the efficiency of its parochial schools, confraternities, catechetical classes, and day nursery, the last of these being perhaps the first of its kind in London.<br>
<br>Webb was appointed by Bishop Jackson of London in 1882 to a prebend in St Paul's Cathedral. From that date until his death he was also editor of the <span class="italic">Church Quarterly Review</span>. He had been elected FSA on 26 May 1870. He died at his house, 3 Chandos Street, Cavendish Square, London, on 27 November 1885, and was buried in the churchyard at Aldenham, Hertfordshire. There is a monument by Armstead in the crypt of St Paul's. Webb left &pound;21,529. His youngest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36796/', "Clement Webb (1865&#150;1954)")</script>, became professor of the philosophy of the Christian religion at Oxford University.<br>
<br>As a tory high-churchman, Webb was known for his moderation. Although an enthusiastic ritualist, often accused of Romanism, he never strayed far from Anglican conventions. &#145;Rubrics were made for the Church&#146;, he used to say, &#145;not the Church for the Rubrics&#146;  (<span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, 53, 1877, 66&#150;7). In this he differed from J. M. Neale. In Hope's words, Webb &#145;never wasted himself by the superfluous indulgence of creating otiose change &hellip; Neale, with all his genius, was not judicious&#146;  (<span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, 40, 1885, 772).<br>
<br>In 1841, while still at Cambridge, and working closely with J. M. Neale, Webb was involved in the production of two highly influential pamphlets: <span class="italic">A Few Words to Church Wardens, Suited to Town and Manufacturing Parishes</span> and <span class="italic">A Few Words to Church Builders</span>. Together Webb and Neale also published a translation of Durandus entitled <span class="italic">The Symbolism of Churches and Church Ornaments</span> (1843). Webb's first solo publication, <span class="italic">Sketches of Continental Ecclesiology, or, Church Notes in Belgium, Germany and Italy</span> (1848), struck out in a new direction: henceforward models for Camdenian churches, at least in towns, were more likely to be continental than East Anglian. And it was perhaps in this area&#151;in the prolonged debates about an architectural style suitable for the Victorian age&#151;that Webb did his most original work. From the 1840s to the 1870s, notably in <span class="italic">The Ecclesiologist</span> and the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, he argued forcibly for modern Gothic: brick-built, polychrome, eclectic; the style in fact of his favourite architect, William Butterfield. He was elected ARIBA in 1878.<br>
<br>As a Cambridge undergraduate, Webb seems to have been more than a little precious. &#145;His dress was very peculiar&#146;, wrote one contemporary, &#145;and intended to designate ultra-highchurchmanship&#146;; so much so that he was known as the &#145;Blessed Benjamin&#146;  (<span class="italic">Romilly's Cambridge Diary, 1842&#150;47</span>, ed. M. E. Bury and J. D. Pickles, Cambridgeshire RS, 10, 1994, 208&#150;9). Nevertheless, despite a retiring manner and frequent ill health, he proved himself an able propagandist as well as a learned liturgiologist.<br>
