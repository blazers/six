<span class="headword">O'Brien,  Barnabas</span>, sixth earl of Thomond  (1590/91&#150;1657), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20453/', "Donough O'Brien, fourth earl of Thomond (d. 1624)")</script>, and his second wife, Lady Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1618), fourth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9557/', "Gerald Fitzgerald, eleventh earl of Kildare")</script>. His elder brother, Henry, fifth earl of Thomond, who succeeded to the earldom on his father's death in 1624, was a strenuous adherent of the government in Ireland and was warmly commended by Strafford for his loyalty. He died without male issue in 1639. Barnabas O'Brien matriculated from Brasenose College, Oxford, on 20 February 1605, aged fourteen, and entered Lincoln's Inn in 1613. On 17 July 1615, at Easton Neston, Northamptonshire, he married Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1592, <i>d</i>. 1675), youngest daughter of Sir George Fermor and widow of James, Lord Crichton of Sanquhar. At some point he purchased the manor of Great Billing, Northamptonshire, and was resident in the county for a time, being appointed a JP. He entered the Irish parliament in 1613 as a member for Coleraine. In 1634 he was returned as an MP for County Clare but, being compelled to go to England for a time, a writ was issued for a fresh election and he was, it seems, succeeded by his uncle Daniel O'Brien, later Viscount Clare. He was also returned for Carlow borough and for Ennis.<br>
<br>In 1639 O'Brien succeeded his brother as sixth earl, and was made governor of co. Clare on 21 November the same year, the governorship to merge with that of Munster after his death. A protestant, he was appointed to the Irish privy council. Following the outbreak of the 1641 rising, he presided over a county meeting which resulted in plans to raise troops and obtain arms against the insurgents. His lenient stance as governor &#145;perhaps as much the result of want of authority as of personal inclination&#146;, however, saw the rising spread to Clare and by January 1642 the county had declared for the insurgents  (Clarke, 194&#150;5). Residing quietly in his principal stronghold, Bunratty Castle, he sheltered local protestants and English. In spite of the support given to the confederacy by his kinsmen he did not sign the oath of association and remained in frequent communication with Ormond, the lord lieutenant. The confederate leadership planned, unsuccessfully, to gain control of his person and castle through his kinsmen, principally his uncle Sir Daniel O'Brien. In 1644 their supreme council forbade his tenants to pay their rents to him, or his agents to collect them, and announced their intention to set his lands. On 3 May 1645 Charles I created him marquess of Billing under the privy seal, but the patent never passed the great seal.<br>
<br>In March 1646 Thomond admitted to Bunratty troops sent by the English parliamentarians (though he later claimed he was not aware in advance of their coming), in spite of the earl of Glamorgan's remonstrances and appeals to his loyalty. He went to live in England and, petitioning parliament, claimed always to have opposed the rebellion and to have sustained considerable losses through seizure of his lands, and through expenditure on troops early in the war and after the arrival of the parliamentarian garrison. His petition for recompense was at least partially granted, and he apparently gave no cause for suspicion to the Commonwealth or protectorate regimes. He died in November 1657 and was buried on 15 November, in Great Billing. In his will, dated 1 July 1657, he complained of his impoverishment, and left some bequests to Great Billing, &#145;which would have been greater had my losses and sufferings in Ireland been less&#146;  (Royal Irish Academy, MS 3.A.40, fol. 161). The will was proved in England on 6 February, and in Ireland on 28 April 1658. He left one son, Henry (1621&#150;1691), his successor, and one daughter, Penelope, who married Henry Mordaunt, second earl of Peterborough. The seventh earl matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford, on 19 August 1636, aged fifteen. He was governor of co. Clare in 1661&#150;70 and again from 1679, and died at Billing on 2 May 1691.<br>
