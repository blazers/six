<span class="headword">Lewis,  Richard</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Thomas Thomas]</span>  (1914&#150;1990), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born on 10 May 1914 at 69 Baden Street, Ardwick, Manchester, only son and the younger of the two children of Thomas Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1949) and his wife, Mary Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lewis (<i>d</i>. 1963), who had moved to Manchester from Wales when Thomas was offered the job of coachman to the manager of the London, Midland, and Scottish Railway. They were Methodists, and he was brought up on Methodist hymns played on the harmonium by his mother. A boy soprano, he won gold medals at festivals all over the north of England until his voice broke when he was sixteen. He left Didsbury Central secondary school in 1930 to work as a clerk at the Calico Printers' Association, but he studied harmony and counterpoint in his spare time and continued to sing; after winning the gold medal of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music in 1938, he won a scholarship to the Royal Manchester College of Music in 1939, to study with the bass Norman Allin.<br>
<br>In 1940 Thomas joined the Entertainments National Service Association, and in 1941 he made his d&eacute;but with the Carl Rosa Opera Company as Pinkerton in Puccini's <span class="italic">Madama Butterfly</span> and Almaviva in Rossini's <span class="italic">The Barber of Seville</span>. He was called up into the Royal Corps of Signals in 1941, but remained in England until 1944. In 1943 he married Mary, daughter of Joseph Lingard, first flute in the Hall&eacute; Orchestra and professor of flute at the Royal Manchester College of Music; they had one son. Thomas was posted to Normandy in 1944, and then to Brussels, where he was able to study at the Brussels conservatory and sang in Brussels, Antwerp, and Li&egrave;ge, including several performances of Benjamin Britten's <span class="italic">Les Illuminations</span>, the beginning of a close association with Britten's music. It was at this point that he took the name Richard Lewis. He sang Britten's <span class="italic">Serenade for Tenor, Horn, and Strings</span> in Copenhagen in 1945, and while stationed in Germany in 1946 took lessons from Pacho Kochen in Hamburg. After demobilization he enrolled in January 1947 at the Royal Academy of Music, where Norman Allin was now teaching, but his career was already taking off: he replaced Peter Pears in Britten's <span class="italic">Serenade</span> with the Southern Philharmonic Orchestra in Brighton in January, and after touring with the English Opera Group in Britten's <span class="italic">Albert Herring</span> in the summer of 1947 he made his d&eacute;but at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, on 10 November 1947, as the Male Chorus in Britten's <span class="italic">The Rape of Lucretia</span> and took over the title role in <span class="italic">Peter Grimes</span> on 28 November 1947.<br>
<br>Richard Lewis sang in his first Glyndebourne season in 1950 as Ferrando in <span class="italic">Cos&igrave; fan tutte</span>, after singing Don Ottavio in <span class="italic">Don Giovanni</span> with the Glyndebourne Opera Company at the Edinburgh festival in 1948, and he sang there every year until 1967, except for 1957 and 1965, and returned in 1972 to sing Eumeaus with Janet Baker in Peter Hall's production of Monteverdi's <span class="italic">Il ritorno d'Ulisse</span>. During this period he sang in twelve different roles, most notably that of Tom Rakewell in Igor Stravinsky's <span class="italic">The Rake's Progress</span> (in which he sang in the British premi&egrave;re at the Edinburgh festival in 1953), which became one of the most popular operas at Glyndebourne in the 1950s. He was the leading Mozart tenor at Glyndebourne for many years, singing in every <span class="italic">Idomeneo</span> from 1951 to 1974. He made his final appearance at Glyndebourne in 1979, in <span class="italic">Il ritorno d'Ulisse</span>. Lewis also sang regularly at Covent Garden, where he was particularly in demand as an interpreter of contemporary opera, including the role of Captain Vere in Britten's <span class="italic">Billy Budd</span>, which he first sang in 1949 and sang for the next thirty years, taking over at short notice in 1979, his final appearance at Covent Garden. He created Troilus in William Walton's <span class="italic">Troilus and Cressida</span> in 1954, and also the role of Mark in Michael Tippett's <span class="italic">The Midsummer Marriage</span> in 1955, when he sang opposite Joan Sutherland, and in 1962 he created Achilles in Tippett's <span class="italic">King Priam</span>. One of his most memorable performances was as Aaron in Schoenberg's <span class="italic">Moses and Aaron</span> in 1965.<br>
<br>The first British singer to be engaged by a major American opera company since before the war, Lewis made his American d&eacute;but in 1955 as Don Jos&eacute; in <span class="italic">Carmen</span> in San Francisco, and he returned every autumn until 1968 to sing with the San Francisco Opera. He also sang regularly with the Metropolitan Opera in New York. In the United States he formed the Bach Aria Group, a group of singers and instrumentalists which performed in New York and toured the universities. He appeared in the major European opera houses, and created Amphitryon in Giselher Klebe's <span class="italic">Alkmene</span> in Berlin in 1961. In 1956 he sang the tenor solo in the first performance of Stravinsky's <span class="italic">Sacrum canticum</span> in St Mark's, Venice. As a singer of oratorio he was most renowned for his Gerontius in Sir Edward Elgar's <span class="italic">The Dream of Gerontius</span>, which he first performed with Sir Malcolm Sargent in 1949, and he was noted for his interpretations of Mahler's <span class="italic">Das Lied von der Erde</span>. He also sang regularly with the Handel Opera Society.<br>
<br>In 1963 Lewis was appointed CBE. In that year he was divorced from his first wife, and married Elizabeth, a singer, daughter of the television reporter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49502/', "(James) Fyfe Robertson")</script>; they had one son. His widowed elder sister married Fyfe Robertson, by then a widower, in 1978. In 1967 Lewis accepted an appointment as professor of singing at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, and he taught there from 1968 to 1971, performing regularly with the Philadelphia Orchestra under its musical director, Eugene Ormandy; during this period he also had a home in Bermuda. He returned to England in 1972 and continued to perform until 1982, when he made his last appearance, in Britten's <span class="italic">Spring Symphony</span>, with the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam. His most memorable recordings include Tippett's <span class="italic">A Child of our Time</span>, Mendelssohn's <span class="italic">Elijah</span> (recorded in 1969 with Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra), and a series of Gilbert and Sullivan operas, including <span class="italic">The Gondoliers</span> and <span class="italic">The Mikado</span>, conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent. He recorded <span class="italic">The Dream of Gerontius</span> twice, with Marjorie Thomas as the Angel in 1955, conducted by Sargent, and with Janet Baker and Sir John Barbirolli in 1965. Lewis was awarded the honorary degree of DMus by the universities of St Andrews in 1984 and Manchester in 1986. He died on 13 November 1990 at his home, Coombe House, 22 Church Street, Old Willingdon, Eastbourne, Sussex, and was cremated on 19 November.<br>
