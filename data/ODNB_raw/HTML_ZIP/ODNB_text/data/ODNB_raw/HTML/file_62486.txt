<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tullis <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Palau]</span>,  Julia Elissa May <span class="st"> [Julie]</span></span>  (1939&#150;1986), <span class="occ">mountaineer and climbing instructor</span>, was born at 3 Kingsdown Avenue, Croydon, on 15 March 1939, the daughter of Francisco Juan Palau (<i>b</i>. 1896), who came from Spain, and his wife, Erica Julia Augusta, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Saucerotte, who was born in Germany. The couple had met and married while working in a hotel near Croydon, and went on to run a Basque restaurant in Knightsbridge, London. Julie (as she was always known) was their second daughter. Like other British children during the war, Julie and her sister, Zita, were evacuated out of the capital to escape the bombing. They stayed on a farm in Norfolk and adored the country life. Once the war was over, their mother took the girls abroad during most summers to see relatives scattered throughout Europe. Julie always said that driving in old cars (bought each year for the purpose) and camping along the way were what encouraged her lifelong wanderlust.<br>
<br>Tullis, who attended Godolphin and Latymer School, Hammersmith, until she was seventeen, discovered rock-climbing as a teenager and spent most of her weekends either in the mountains of north Wales or on the sandstone outcrops of the Kent and Sussex border, a popular training ground for London climbers. In 1956, at High Rocks near Tunbridge Wells, she met Terence Michael (Terry) Tullis (<i>b</i>. 1935), the son of Frank Charles Tullis, originally from Fife. They married at Streatham on 7 November 1959 and had a son, born in 1962, and a daughter two years later; by then the Tullises were living in Groombridge, Sussex, where they ran the village shop and climbing caf&eacute;.<br>
<br>Both Julie and Terry Tullis also worked as climbing instructors, mostly with school groups. Their students included young people with physical and mental disabilities, work for which Julie's patience and natural warmth made her particularly suited. She encouraged many able-bodied and disabled youngsters to widen their horizons, while at the same time her own confidence and horizons were widening with the discovery of budo. This combination of various martial art disciplines, including karate and aikido, transformed her attitude to life. The flexibility and mental strength she derived from it infused her climbing. It was not simply that practising slow, controlled movements improved balance and co-ordination, she wrote in her autobiography, <span class="italic">Clouds from Both Sides</span>; with budo came an understanding that tiredness and pain do not mean that one has to give up. The body can go on. This truth subsequently saved her life on several occasions.<br>
<br>In 1978, with their children in their mid-teens, the Tullises went on their first major climbing expedition, to Peru. Terry by this time was limited in what he could achieve, having suffered a horrific leg injury some years before, but Julie climbed two Andean peaks, Pisco (18,898 feet) and Huascaran Norte (21,800 feet), and her passion for high places was ignited. Forming a climbing partnership with the well-respected Austrian mountaineer Kurt Diemberger, a family friend, she turned her sights to the Himalayas. Diemberger, in a climbing career spanning thirty years, had already trodden the summits of five &#145;eight-thousanders&#146; (the fourteen highest mountains in the world), two of them as first ascents. He was also a film-maker, and in need of an assistant. Julie set herself to become a sound recordist to be able to complement his camera work. It delighted them both how well they worked and climbed together, and in time, as they went from one Himalayan giant to the next, they came to be known as &#145;the highest film team in the world&#146;.<br>
<br>Their first joint assignment, to Nanga Parbat with a French expedition, was in many ways disappointing, as the leader&#151;having convinced himself Tullis must have lied about her altitude experience&#151;would not countenance her climbing above camp 1. Nevertheless, she found the mountain enchanting, and hoped to return. Their film picked up many awards. In 1983 they went to the Chinese (northern) side of K2 (28,250 feet) with an Italian party, and this time climbed together to 26,248 feet, the magic 8000 metre line. In addition they tramped many extra glacier miles exploring the empty valleys of this rarely visited side of the Karakoram and Aghil ranges. Within a year they were back on K2 with an international team, attempting the more frequented Abruzzi Ridge in Pakistan. This time their high point was 24,115 feet. Nearby Broad Peak beckoned. This was one of the eight-thousanders already climbed by Diemberger twenty-seven years before. He could not resist trying it again. When they came down from K2, he and Tullis decided to make a lightweight raid on its summit. They were, as Diemberger later wrote in his book <span class="italic">The Endless Knot: Triumph and Tragedy on K2</span> (1991), &#145;probably the oldest couple climbing in the Himalayas&#146;, but after two months in the Karakoram they were at a peak of condition and acclimatization. They made it to the summit, only to be faced with a nightmare descent through unstable, new snow. They survived one avalanche and dodged others before getting down safely.<br>
<br>The busiest year for Tullis and Diemberger was 1985, with attempts on Everest and Nanga Parbat. They made films of both trips, and also shot a delightful documentary of a remote Himalayan village tucked under the great peaks of Makalu and Everest. <span class="italic">Tashigang: Tibetan Village between the Worlds of Gods and Men</span> went on to take a first prize at the annual Trento mountain film festival. When the opportunity came to return to K2 the following year, they jumped at it. Of all the high peaks they had come to know, the second highest mountain in the world was their &#145;mountain of mountains&#146;, and they welcomed another chance to climb it.<br>
<br>The summer of 1986 proved a disastrous one for the eleven expeditions booked to attempt K2. Though some climbers reached the top, by the end of July six had died on the mountain. Two more perished in the first week of August. Meanwhile, those who still entertained summit hopes&#151;representatives from four separate expeditions&#151;were attempting the mountain simultaneously, Diemberger and Tullis among them. On 4 August they stood on top of K2, as did several of the others, including another Briton, Alan Rouse. Tullis's was the second British ascent of K2; no British woman had ever climbed so high.<br>
<br>But it was late in the day, and disastrously late in the season. Five climbers made it back that night to camp 4 (still above 8000 metres), only to be trapped there by fierce storms. Diemberger and Tullis did not join them there until the following day, having survived a fall and been forced to bivouac on their way down. The storms raged on for days. Julie Tullis succumbed to high altitude during the night of 6&#150;7 August 1986. She was buried in a crevasse at camp 4, with a memorial on the Gilkey Cairn below. Of the seven people marooned in that camp only two got down alive, Kurt Diemberger and Willi Bauer, on 11 August.<br>
<br>Although Julie Tullis was undoubtedly Britain's most experienced female high-altitude mountaineer up to the time of her death, her achievements received little recognition in a climbing establishment that was all too ready to mark her down as a star-struck appendage of Kurt Diemberger. Yet her resilience and calm brought much to that partnership. For the style of mountaineering they preferred, they complemented each other perfectly, with Tullis providing a steadying foil for Diemberger's volatility. It is hard to believe that six major expeditions to the world's highest mountains and a lifetime's dedication to climbing would have been so lightly dismissed had she been a male mountaineer. Tullis's career as a high alpinist is the more remarkable for not having begun until her fortieth year. She was once asked if she felt it had all happened too late. &#145;Not at all&#146;, she responded. &#145;I think I am enjoying it more now than ever I would have done earlier&#146;  (personal knowledge). Most of her climbing partners were older than she was: Diemberger was seven years older. He was so full of vitality, she observed, that he would go on enjoying mountains and exploration for a long time. &#145;Age doesn't frighten me&#146;, she said, &#145;I just take each year as it comes&#146;  (ibid.). A commemorative campsite in memory of Julie Tullis was opened at Harrisons Rocks, Groombridge, near the home she shared with Terry, who survived her.<br>
