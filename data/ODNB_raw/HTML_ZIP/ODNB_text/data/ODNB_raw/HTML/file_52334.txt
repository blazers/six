<span class="headword">McCall,  Annie</span>  (1859&#150;1949), <span class="occ">physician and promoter of antenatal and maternity care</span>, was born on 23 September 1859 at Dudley Bank Cottage, Whalley Range, Moss Side, Manchester, the third child of five born to William McCall (1810/11&#150;1863), an insurance agent, and his wife, Mary (1831&#150;1921), daughter of Andrew Meiklejohn, an indigo planter. Her father died of tuberculosis when she was four and in 1871 her mother took the children to Germany to extend their education and so that they could learn a second language. Mrs McCall was widely read, &#145;a walking gazetteer&#146;  (Barrass, 24), and a strong influence, encouraging her daughter's wish to qualify as a doctor, which was difficult for women at that time. On the advice of Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, a friend of her mother's, McCall studied at the London School of Medicine for Women from 1880 to 1884, specializing in midwifery, and afterwards at Bern, where she gained her degree as doctor of medicine in 1885, one of the first fifty women to do so. She studied obstetrics in Vienna before returning to England and taking an appointment in 1885 as medical officer at the Conference Hall, 143 Clapham Road, London, a mission hall and surgery run by Mrs Susannah Meredith. She was there for fifteen months and then continued the work of the outpatients' clinic for poor women and children from January 1887 at her own home, 131 Clapham Road.<br>
<br>McCall had always intended to open a maternity hospital, and to prepare for this had established a committee of supportive women and opened an antenatal clinic in 1886, which, McCall said:<blockquote>set out to deal with the absolute needs of expectant mothers. It is my belief that it was also the first thing of its kind in the country. Here we dealt with such things as the occupation of the mother, food preparation, the question of rest, leisure and exercise. Eventually it embodied a kind of post-natal work too, which we called the <i>Mother's Welcome</i>. (Barrass, 43)</blockquote>Other outpatient establishments for women and children were at 2 Stockwell Road, 377 Wandsworth Road, and 2 Fentiman Road.<br>
<br>The Clapham Maternity Hospital (renamed the Annie McCall Maternity Hospital in 1936) was opened in 1889 at 74 Jeffreys Road, Stockwell, moving to 41&#150;3 Jeffreys Road in 1892 and rebuilt on that site in 1913. In 1931 there were fifty beds and fees were 3 guineas a week. It closed in 1970 and the adjacent road has been named Annie McCall Close. It was financed originally by private subscriptions and legacies; in 1898 income included McCall's temperance lecture fees, donations from Elizabeth Blackwell and Louisa Garrett Anderson, and the sale of caps made by Mrs McCall. Small mortgages were taken out and grants received from the King Edward's Hospital Fund for London. Priority was given to admitting single women, unusual at this time, when being an unmarried mother was considered a disgrace and could result in the mother being cast out of the family home and the baby being born in the workhouse. McCall believed in the importance of antenatal care, natural childbirth, and conservative midwifery. &#145;Masterful inactivity&#146; was her watchword and she also emphasized diet, recommending that no meat or eggs be eaten in the last months of pregnancy. Internal examinations were avoided if possible and forceps were used in only 3 per cent of births. Great emphasis was given to training and high standards; the resulting maternal mortality rates were low&#151;1.6 per 1000&#151;from 1889 to 1942. The skills of midwifery and obstetrics were being developed in Clapham at a time when their importance was not recognized elsewhere, before midwives had to be registered. McCall had been shocked at the low standard of care she had experienced during her early training in London hospitals. She and Marion Ritchie did &#145;much for obstetrics especially during a period when this branch of practice was looked upon as beneath the notice of the physician and surgeon&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Lancet</span>).<br>
<br>McCall had also established the Clapham School of Midwifery, which opened in 1887, with three students based at her home. It was run in conjunction with the hospital and set its own examinations, marked by external women doctors. The school trained midwives, monthly nurses, and doctors in midwifery. There was also a class in operative midwifery for medical students and missionaries going abroad. The examination was in three parts; written, <i>viva voce</i>, and practical on the wards. Only women, staff, and students, were admitted to both the school and hospital. Many women came from Christian missions abroad. The first Nigerian arrived in 1912; &#145;It is character, not colour, that counts&#146;, said McCall  (Barrass, 75). She was a member of the Central Midwives' Board from its establishment in 1902 until 1931 and an examiner, as well as being vice chairman of the London county council committee for the <span class="roman">Midwives' Act</span>. She was also interested in tuberculosis, running a clinic at the hospital and a sanatorium at her other home in Rudgwick, Sussex.<br>
<br>McCall was confirmed into the Lutheran church while in Germany and believed in the power of prayer. She was fierce in her opposition to alcohol, and a vocal member of the temperance movement, bequeathing her house at 165 Clapham Road to the United Temperance Council. She was an autocrat, who expected her orders to be carried out in every detail, but was &#145;tender to the unmarried mother, even&hellip; a second time&#146;  (Barrass, 6). She worked until 1941 and one mother remembered her in the 1930s peering down to stitch up, as her eyesight deteriorated. She was described as an ardent suffragette and refused to write her degree dissertation about vivisection, requesting another subject instead. McCall was severe in appearance. One student wrote describing her clothes: black costumes, white blouses, black tie, woollen stockings, and boots. &#145;She seemed to us to have shed frills forever. I will say no more in that line&#146;  (Barrass, 117). For relaxation she enjoyed travel and her garden at her later home, 165 Clapham Road, with its mulberry tree. Members of her family lived near by at 56 Jeffreys Road; close friends included her cousin Marion Ritchie, who was an able hospital administrator and who until her death in 1931 softened McCall's forceful character, and Constance Watney, matron for a time, whom McCall described as &#145;my friend and close companion and business advisor&#146;  (Barrass, 107).<br>
<br>McCall died on 9 September 1949 at her last home, Kings, in Rudgwick and was buried in the Holy Trinity churchyard at Rudgwick on 13 September. She left an estate valued at over &pound;92,000, most of which was willed to the London School of Medicine for Women to set up an Annie McCall scholarship in midwifery; she cared passionately that all women should have the best possible maternity care.<br>
