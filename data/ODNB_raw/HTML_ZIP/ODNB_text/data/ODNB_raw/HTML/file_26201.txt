<span class="headword">Stafford,  Edmund</span>  (1344&#150;1419), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Exeter</span>, was the second son of Sir Richard Stafford of Clifton, banneret (<i>d</i>. 1380), and Isabel, his first wife (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1350), daughter of Sir Richard Vernon of Haddon. Ralph, first earl of Stafford (<i>d</i>. 1372), was his uncle, while his father was a prominent associate of Edward, the Black Prince. His elder brother, Richard, died in their father's lifetime, and Edmund inherited his father's lands in 1380. He attended Oxford University, graduating BA by 1363 and BCL in 1369: he was appointed a canon of Lichfield in 1363 and received other benefices in the part of Staffordshire where his family lands lay. His promotion in the 1380s was rapid, more perhaps by virtue of his administrative abilities than his political connections. He became dean of York in 1385 and also in that year took the degree of DCL. He was a king's clerk by 1388, and was appointed keeper of the privy seal on 4 May 1389, following Richard II's dismissal of the officers appointed by the appellants in 1388. During his period of office the practice seems to have begun of sending poor men's causes to the keeper of the privy seal and a group of councillors for adjudication. On 15 January 1395 he was provided to the see of Exeter, &#145;at the king's instance&#146;, according to Walsingham, and he was consecrated by Archbishop William Courtenay (<i>d</i>. 1396) on 20 June. He remained in office as keeper of the privy seal until February 1396, and on 15 November of that year he was appointed chancellor.<br>
<br>Stafford preached the opening sermon in the parliament of September 1397 on the theme &#145;Rex unus erit omnibus&#146; (<span class="roman">One king shall be king to them all</span>). He stressed the subject's duty of obedience to the king and submission to the law. Yet although his sermon emphasized the supremacy of royal power, it is not clear that he fully sympathized with Richard's extreme measures in the following two years: his role may rather have been that of an able, if compliant, administrator. His academic standing was recognized in 1399 when he was summoned, together with other Oxford masters, to offer an opinion on the proposal to withdraw obedience from the Roman pope, Boniface IX (<i>r</i>. 1389&#150;1404). He lost the chancellorship at the accession of Henry IV, but he remained a member of the council, and was one of the bishops who assented to the imprisonment of Richard II. In March 1401, as part of a general reaction against Henry's dependence on his Lancastrian associates, Stafford was appointed chancellor once again and held office until February 1403, when he was succeeded by Henry Beaufort (<i>d</i>. 1447). For several years after his loss of office Stafford continued to play some part in government. He served as a trier of petitions in the parliaments of 1404 and 1406, and was named as one of the king's councillors in the parliament of 1406.<br>
<br>While he held high office in government, Stafford seldom visited his diocese, but in 1400, in the interval between his first and second tenures of the chancellorship, he carried out a lengthy visitation of nearly every part of his diocese. After 1403 he became mainly occupied with diocesan affairs, and conducted three further visitations, in 1404, 1411, and 1414. After 1414 his health probably began to fail (in his will, dated 24 July 1418, he described himself as sound in mind but weak in body), but he continued to play some part in the administration of his diocese. He died on 3 September 1419, having just been excused attendance at the forthcoming parliament. He was buried in Exeter Cathedral on the north side of the lady chapel in a tomb chest which still survives. He was a generous benefactor to Exeter College, Oxford, giving to the college books for divine service and for the library, and providing more than 200 marks (&pound;133 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.) to pay for various building works there. He also owned some books that he had bought at the sale of the goods of Thomas of Woodstock, duke of Gloucester, after the latter's condemnation for treason in 1397. He may have had some sense of guilt about the purchase, for in his will he ordered his executors to sell the books and devote the proceeds to prayers for the souls of himself, Woodstock, and all the faithful departed. The family lands, which included Clifton Campville in Staffordshire, of which he had been rector since 1384, passed at his death to his nephew Thomas, son of his younger brother, also called Thomas, who had died some time between 1385 and 1419. He also bequeathed to his nephew some of his personal possessions from his manor of Clyst Honiton, including a tapestry embroidered with the arms of the bishop's father.<br>
