<span class="headword">Fitzjames,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1522), <span class="occ">bishop of London</span>, was the son of John Fitzjames of Redlynch, near Bruton, Somerset; the judge <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9611/', "Sir John Fitzjames")</script> was his nephew. He was educated at Oxford, where he was elected bachelor of Merton College in 1465, and a fellow <i>c</i>.1468; he served as bursar 1474&#150;5, and was warden of Merton from 1483 to 1507. Having proceeded MA, he was DTh by 1481 (incorporated at Cambridge in 1495/6). He was successively ordained acolyte in 1473 and deacon in 1475, and held a variety of ecclesiastical preferments thereafter, typical for one of his academic and administrative ability: rector of Spettisbury, Dorset, 1472&#150;6; canon of Wells, with the prebend of Taunton, from 1475 until at least 1483; and, by papal licence to hold an incompatible benefice, became rector of Trent, Somerset, in 1476. He was treasurer of St Paul's, London, 1483&#150;97, with the prebend of Portpoole, and during these years was also vicar of Minehead and rector of Aller in Somerset, and master of St Leonard's Hospital, Bedford.<br>
<br>Although it is not easy to determine Fitzjames's whereabouts for much of his early career, it is very unlikely that he resided in any of his benefices for long, if at all, despite their proximity to his birthplace. Thomas Kemp, bishop of London, left him a covered cup in his will in 1489, perhaps indicating that as treasurer Fitzjames was active in diocesan administration as well as in preaching. He was certainly active in the University of Oxford, and from 1489 was chaplain to Henry VII, in which capacity he is known to have preached on ten occasions from 1491 to 1503 and at Paul's Cross six times between 1494 and 1498, as well as at state occasions such as Cardinal Morton's funeral in September 1500, at the wedding of Princess Margaret and King James IV of Scotland in 1502, and at Queen Elizabeth's funeral in 1503. He was one of the bishops present at the reception of Katherine of Aragon in England in 1501 and then at her wedding to Prince Arthur. Fitzjames's evident talent and learning led to his being promoted rapidly under Henry VII. That he did not play as great a role in secular affairs as many others who became bishops may reflect his theological as opposed to legal training, although in 1499 he, William Warham, and Sir Richard Hatton negotiated a commercial treaty with Archduke Philip and the Low Countries. It is perhaps not surprising that he was appointed an executor to Henry VII.<br>
<br>Fitzjames first became a bishop when on 1 February 1497 he was provided to the see of Rochester; he was consecrated by Warham on 21 May, and enthroned on 30 November. Little can be said of his tenure of the diocese which was poor and typically held by those of theological training. He certainly resided, as his register shows, most often at his manor of Lambeth Marsh, but also at Bromley, Hallyng, and at Rochester itself. He carried out five ordination ceremonies in person, four at Bromley, one at Chislehurst, heard the abjuration of the heretic Christopher Northrop in January 1500, and in 1502 conducted a visitation of his cathedral priory and diocese in person, although he had delegated his primary visitation to his commissaries in 1498. The sparse surviving evidence suggests that Fitzjames attached importance to carrying out episcopal duties in person where possible. In 1502, rather unusually for the time, he and a suffragan bishop (presumably present to enhance the importance of the occasion) blessed the newly appointed abbot of Lesnes in the parish church of Greenwich. By this time Fitzjames seems to have built up the team of officials which he would later use in London&#151;the same suffragan bishop (&#145;Maiorensis&#146;) and his commissary Dr William Horsey.<br>
<br>On 29 November 1503 Fitzjames was translated to Chichester, the temporalities being restored on 29 January following. Almost nothing can be said of his tenure of his second diocese, from which he was translated by papal provision to London on 5 June 1506, receiving his temporalities on 1 August. The routine records of institutions and collations which make up most of his London register convey an impression of administrative efficiency, with only the occasional glimpse of anything beyond the routine: in 1509 the bishop examined the heretic Elizabeth Sampson; in 1511 Joanna Baker and William Potter abjured before William Horsey, these last two cases presumably not judged serious enough to merit the bishop's presence. On a number of occasions the bishop confirmed the rules of London fraternities, for example that in honour of the visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in 1509, that of St Barbara in 1511. The detail of these ceremonies and of those accompanying the professions of abbots, or concerning the seventy-one barber&#150;surgeons licensed in March 1514 (Fitzjames owned a book by Galen, suggesting a more than passing interest in medicine), points to a bishop actively involved in diocesan life. Of the eighty-three ordination ceremonies held in London during his episcopate Fitzjames held only thirty in person, the last in September 1515, but he may well have routinely examined candidates for ordination, as he certainly did on three separate occasions in 1507 and 1508. This is the only record of a diocesan bishop acting thus between 1500 and 1559, and is a measure of how seriously he took his duties.<br>
<br>Fitzjames's tenure of London has been retrospectively dominated by the case of the alleged heretic Richard Hunne. In fact proceedings against this London merchant were first initiated by parish clergy, then by Archbishop Warham's court of audience in 1512, and it was Warham who began heresy proceedings in 1514 via convocation. Fitzjames's first known direct involvement was on 2 December 1514 when he and three other bishops examined Hunne at Fulham Palace. Subsequently Hunne was found dead in his cell, and Horsey, Fitzjames's loyal and probably innocent chancellor, was accused of murder. The issue of who killed Hunne was never resolved, but the case later became particularly prominent as an example to some protestants of an irascible and reactionary bishop meanly persecuting a &#145;heretic&#146; and being over-assertive in defence of church rights. But Fitzjames was not alone in this defence; Wolsey, the normally cautious Warham, Fox, Nix, and Abbot Kidderminster of Winchcombe were all outspoken in defence of clerical rights in 1514, though it is again Fitzjames's letter to Wolsey which is perhaps best remembered, for its complaint that the Londoners were so anti-clerical that any jury would &#145;cast and condemn my clerk though he was as innocent as Abel&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anglica historia</span>, 229).<br>
<br>It might well be that the Hunne affair, defused by Wolsey in 1515, had little subsequent significance outside London, but that Fitzjames was active against heresy is clear. There were over sixty heresy hearings in the diocese from 1511 onwards, though it would be unfair to single out Fitzjames as &#145;an old bigot&#146;  (Elton, 57) or even as a persecutor&#151;many of his fellow bishops (notably first Smith, then Longland, of Lincoln, Blyth of Coventry and Lichfield, Nix of Norwich, and Archbishop Warham himself) were just as active in defence of orthodoxy at this time. Fitzjames's was a high-profile diocese, and one in which heresy cases were more frequent than most. In any case, recantations, not burnings, were his priority. But it is probably true to say that Fitzjames, who may not always have been in very good health, could appear clumsy and aggressive in his dealings: in 1513 he effectively gagged his own dean, the reformist John Colet, by threatening heresy charges, though this may have been less a reactionary stand against reform than the action of a diocesan bishop reluctant to see clerical shortcoming so eloquently denounced so close to home&#151;such initiatives were best launched by the episcopate.<br>
<br>Fitzjames was not a humanist reformer in the fashion of Colet, Erasmus, or even Fisher. The books he left to Merton College are theologically conservative: five by Jerome, three by Ambrose, one each by Augustine, Isidore, and Bonaventure. Erasmus was quite scathing about Fitzjames but this should not detract from his diligence and plain desire to uphold clerical and educational standards. The school he endowed at Bruton in 1519 was not to be for &#145;song nor other petite lernynge, as the Cross Rowe, redyng of the matyns or of the psalter&#146; but &#145;lernynge of gramer&#146;  (<span class="italic">VCH Somerset</span>, 2/2.444). It is hard to imagine him objecting to Wolsey's suppression of six poorhouses in his diocese to help fund Cardinal College; indeed, the scheme to expand Fitzjames's own alma mater was bound to meet with approval. The bishop might well have lived up to his own prescription of 1495:<blockquote>that one vertuous prelate dooth moche good in crystis chyrche as well for his owne vertue and zelace obedyence unto the laws of god as in ledynge other men to do the same by his holy doctrine and vertuous example. (Fitzjames, fol. 6)</blockquote>Fitzjames saw himself as &#145;nouryssher&#146; to his flock. A decade after his death, Polydore Vergil praised his theological eminence and his austerity, and described him as &#145;a father of old family, great learning, and the utmost goodness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anglica historia</span>, 130), while in 1601 Francis Godwin, in his not always complimentary survey of past bishops, wrote of him as being &#145;learned and very vertuous&#146;  (Godwin, 154).<br>
<br>Fitzjames died in London on 15 January 1522 and was buried in the tomb he had had prepared in the nave of St Paul's. His will, entirely conventional for its time, is dated 11 April 1518&#151;he may have been ill for some time before his death, as his activity diminishes noticeably from this time. Some money was left for the poor, unspecified goods to his executors, and the pair of &#145;portatyves&#146; at London and organs at Fulham, jewels, books, and vestments of his chapel to his successor. All the cooking utensils and tables were also to remain for his successor &#145;that he shall not fynde the houses bayre of suche things when he shall come unto them&#146;&#151;as he had done  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/3 Ayloffe, fols. 22&#150;22<i>v</i>). This was a conventional insurance to avoid dilapidation suits, and in fact Fitzjames had repaired and even extended episcopal manors&#151;at Fulham he built the western quadrangle and a wing that has since been demolished. He also endowed a school in his native Bruton in 1519, and so it is perhaps not entirely surprising that, careful though he was in administering the finances and leases of his see, he appears to have had virtually no residual income when he died. One further bequest was of his missal of the Sarum which Fitzjames left for his successor as bishop of London, Cuthbert Tunstall. In 1949 the missal was purchased for St Michael's Church, Minehead, where it remains on permanent display.<br>
