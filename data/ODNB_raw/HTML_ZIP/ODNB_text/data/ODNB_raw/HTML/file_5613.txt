<span class="headword">Clerk, Sir  George, of Penicuick</span>, sixth baronet  (1787&#150;1867), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the elder son of James Clerk of the East India Company and his wife, Janet, daughter of George Irving of Newton, Lanarkshire, and grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5623/', "Sir George Clerk Maxwell")</script>; he was born on 19 November 1787, and educated at the high school, Edinburgh, and at Trinity College, Oxford, where he was admitted on 21 January 1806. His father died in 1793, and in 1798 he succeeded his uncle, Sir John Clerk, as the sixth baronet. He was admitted an advocate in 1809, and created a DCL of Oxford on 5 July 1810. At a by-election in July 1811, supported by the Melville family interest, he was elected MP for Midlothian (Edinburghshire), for which he sat until 1832. From a family strongly tory, Clerk was on 5 March 1819 appointed one of the lords of the Admiralty in the Liverpool administration. He held this post until May 1827, when he became clerk of the ordnance. He was gazetted one of the council of the duke of Clarence, the lord high admiral, on 4 February 1828, but upon the duke's resignation was reappointed a lord of the Admiralty. On 5 August 1830 he became under-secretary for the Home department for the few remaining months of the Wellington administration.<br>
<br>At the first general election after the passing of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, which took place in December 1832, Clerk lost his seat for Midlothian, being defeated by Sir John Dalrymple, the whig candidate, by 601 to 536. He was re-elected, however, in January 1835 for his old constituency, but at the next general election, in August 1837, was defeated by William Gibson Craig. In April of the following year he was elected unopposed for the borough of Stamford, which he also represented in the succeeding parliament. In July 1847 Clerk was returned for Dover&#151;despite opposition from an extreme protestant&#151;but, after unsuccessfully contesting that constituency in July 1852 and March 1857, made no further attempt to re-enter parliament. He held the post of secretary to the Treasury in Sir Robert Peel's administration from December 1834 to April 1835, and from September 1841 to February 1845. On 5 February 1845 he was appointed vice-president of the Board of Trade, and was at the same time sworn of the privy council. In the same month he was made master of the Royal Mint on the retirement of W. E. Gladstone. Clerk held both these offices until July 1846, when Sir Robert Peel's second administration came to an end. For many years he was an able and zealous supporter of the tory party, and particularly of Peel, a friend from his Oxford days. He was an earlier convert to free trade than the majority of his party  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 83.1420&#150;39), and continued to belong to the Peelite section until it was finally broken up.<br>
<br>On 13 August 1810 Clerk married Maria (<i>d</i>. 7 Sept 1866), second daughter of Ewan Law of Horsted Place, Sussex, with whom he had eight sons and four daughters. He was president of the Zoological Society 1862&#150;7, FRS, chairman of the Royal Academy of Music, an elder of the Church of Scotland, and a deputy lieutenant of Midlothian. He died on 23 December 1867, at Penicuik House, near Edinburgh, in his eighty-first year. He was succeeded in the title by his eldest son, James; James Clerk Maxwell was his great-nephew.<br>
