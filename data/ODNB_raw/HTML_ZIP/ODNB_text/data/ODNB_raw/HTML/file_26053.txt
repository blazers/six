</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Southerne,  Thomas</span>  (1660&#150;1746), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born at Oxmantown, near Dublin, the third son of Francis Southerne (<i>d</i>. 1678), a brewer. His mother's name is not known. He attended the grammar school of Edward Wetenhall in Dublin, then Trinity College, Dublin, though there is no record of his having been awarded a BA degree. He was, however, awarded an MA degree in 1696.<br>
<br>Southerne left Dublin for London in 1680 and on 15 July of that year was admitted to the Middle Temple. Right from the start his chief interest was not the law but the theatre, and in 1682 he prevailed on the management of Drury Lane to stage his first play, <span class="italic">The Loyal Brother</span>, with tory-leaning prologue and epilogue supplied by Dryden. The play, like many others of that time, pillories Shaftesbury and exalts the reputation of James, duke of York, as &#145;the loyal brother&#146;&#151;all this in the most transparent and facile political allegory, written partly in prose and partly in blank verse. It was well received in its day and was followed two years later by <span class="italic">The Disappointment, or, The Mother in Fashion</span> (1684), also acted at Drury Lane, with a special command performance for Charles II and his queen given only two weeks before the king's death. This play, a typical enough imitation of the Restoration intrigue play, shows also some signs of the new tendency towards sentimentalism which was to reach its full flowering in the work of Cibber, Steele, and the eighteenth-century writers generally.<br>
<br>Southerne's next play suffered a violent and lengthy interruption, as he himself explains in its preface: &#145;This tragedy was begun a year before the Revolution [that is, in 1687] and near four acts written &hellip; Many things interfering with those times, I laid by what I had written for seventeen years.&#146; The play was called <span class="italic">The Spartan Dame</span> and it did not reach the stage until 1719. Southerne had joined the army in June 1685 and, making profitable use of his good standing with the duke of York, later James II (accruing from the flattery lavished on the duke in <span class="italic">The Loyal Brother</span>), had climbed from ensign to lieutenant between 1685 and 1688. After 1688 Thomas Southerne was not moved, either by his enthusiasm for his former patron or by his general sympathy with the tory faction, to continue actively in the Jacobite cause and by December 1690 he was back in the theatre with his first comedy, <span class="italic">Sir Anthony Love, or, The Rambling Lady</span>. Gerard Langbaine, in <span class="italic">An Account of the English Dramatic Poets</span>, said of it: &#145;This play was acted with extraordinary applause, the part of Sir Anthony being most masterly play'd by Mrs. Montfort: and certainly, whoever reads it, will find it fraught with true wit and humour&#146;  (Langbaine, 184). The &#145;extraordinary applause&#146; apparently encouraged Southerne. During the next five years he produced four plays, all presented at Drury Lane: <span class="italic">The Wives' Excuse, or, Cuckolds Make Themselves</span> (1692), <span class="italic">The Maid's Last Prayer, or, Any Rather than Fail</span> (1692), <span class="italic">The Fatal Marriage, or, The Innocent Adultery</span> (1694), and <span class="italic">Oroonoko, or, The Royal Slave</span> (1696). The first was not a success at the time and failed to secure its place in repertory, despite having a potent advocate in Dryden, who wrote a ludicrously complimentary verse epistle to accompany its publication in 1692. Its reputation revived somewhat in the twentieth century, however, and it was staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1994&#150;5. The last two, both tragedies and both adapted (rather freely) from novels by Aphra Behn, were particularly successful with audiences and both remained in the standard repertory well into the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>After the sudden spate of plays from 1690 to 1695 there was a gap of five years in Southerne's writing before <span class="italic">The Fate of Capua</span> appeared in 1700: a run-of-the-mill &#145;heroic tragedy&#146; of a mediocre kind, there has never been, either in its own time or since, any critical debate about its undoubted mediocrity. Nineteen years elapsed before another new Southerne play appeared, and even then it was not really a new play but the resuscitated <span class="italic">The Spartan Dame</span>, long suppressed for political reasons but finally revised, sanitized, completed, and produced in 1719. And for the whole of that long interval there is very little solid information about Southerne's life and activities. There are occasional passing mentions of him&#151;always kindly, always admiring: he seems to have been, uniquely among the public figures of the age, quite free from either malice or envy. Especially was he known for being ready to help other playwrights, particularly the young and as yet untried, with their plans and ambitions. It was he, for example, who recommended Colley Cibber's first play&#151;<span class="italic">Love's Last Shift</span>&#151;in 1696 to Christopher Rich, the manager of Drury Lane.<br>
<br>From an anonymous satire written in 1703 it appears that about that time Southerne married:<blockquote>
<div>For since the Marriage-Yoke he has put on,<br>
</div>
<div>He drinks <i>Champaign</i> and quits the Helycon.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Religio poetae, or, A Satyr on the Poets</span>, 1703, 9)</blockquote>Whether married or not, Southerne certainly had a daughter because his will, dated 6 November 1731, makes &#145;my dear daughter Agnes&#146; sole executrix, responsible for paying &#145;all my Just and lawfull debts&#146;  (Dodds, &#145;Appendix&#146;, 218).<br>
<br>Increasingly Southerne became a welcome guest and a trusted friend of the rich and famous. Dryden had long been his close acquaintance: as early as 1691 the elder poet, who fell ill while struggling to complete his play <span class="italic">Cleomenes</span>, had asked his young colleague to complete the last act for him, and this Southerne has successfully achieved. Through his middle years Southerne is frequently mentioned&#151;and never other than kindly&#151;in the <i>vers de soci&eacute;t&eacute;</i> with which poets and poetasters alike littered literary London in the early eighteenth century. And in his old age he remained, still, quite literally the toast of the town. For the greater part of that time he lived with Mr Whyte, an oilman, in Tothill Street, against Dartmouth Street, until he moved to his final home in Smith Street, also in Westminster. On his eighty-first birthday he was invited to dine with Lord Orrery where he received a graceful verse panegyric from Pope.<br>
<br>Southerne, almost alone among Restoration dramatists, made playwriting pay. <span class="italic">Oroonoko</span> and <span class="italic">The Fatal Marriage</span>, in particular, made him quite wealthy. But whatever the magic touch was, it deserted him finally: his last play, <span class="italic">Money the Mistress</span>, a comedy written when he was sixty-six, was hissed off the stage, but by then (1725) he was secure enough financially to absorb the loss without its threatening his lifestyle. In 1733 Swift wrote from Dublin to Pope in London:<blockquote>Our old friend Southern [<i>sic</i>], who has just left us, was invited to dinner once or twice by a judge, a bishop, or a commissioner of revenue, but most frequented a few particular friends, and chiefly the Doctor, who is so easy in his fortune, and very hospitable.(<span class="italic">Correspondence of Jonathan Swift</span>, ed. H. Williams, 1965, 4.170; the &#145;Doctor&#146; referred to is Dr Delaney)</blockquote>John Boyle, earl of Orrery was one of Southerne's especial friends. In the summer of 1733, for example, he wrote to Southerne from Ireland with genuine warmth and affection. Addressing him as &#145;dear Brother poet&#146; he begged Southerne not to risk another journey to Ireland but instead to &#145;go and regale thyself amongst my Ancestours at Marston. Pillard shall open my Cellars, and Marston shall be your own house as long as you will think it worth making it so&#146;  (Dodds, 17).<br>
<br>Another of Southerne's distinguished friends in later life was the poet Thomas Gray, who in 1737 wrote to Horace Walpole:<blockquote>We have old Mr. Southern [<i>sic</i>] at a gentleman's house a little way off, who often comes to see us; he is now seventy-seven years old and has almost wholly lost his memory; but is as agreeable as an old man can be, at least I persuade myself so when I look at him and think of Isabella [in <span class="italic">The Fatal Marriage</span>] and Oronooko.</blockquote>Gray was by no means the only one to remember Southerne's career chiefly for these two plays, both of which remained in the English theatre repertory throughout the eighteenth century and one of which continued to hold the stage much longer than that: Garrick played Oronooko in 1759, Kean played it in 1817 (Hazlitt thought it &#145;one of his best parts&#146;  (see <span class="italic">Works</span>, ed. A. R. Waller and A. Glover, 12 vols., 1902&#150;4, 11.301)), Junius Brutus Booth played the first American performance of it in New York in 1832&#151;and Ralph Richardson played it at the Malvern festival in 1932.<br>
<br>Thomas Southerne died in London, aged eighty-six, on 26 May 1746. He was buried on 29 May at St Margaret's, Westminster.<br>
