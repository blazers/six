<span class="headword">Atwood,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1793), <span class="occ">judge in Dominica and the Bahamas and writer on economics and history</span>, wrote that he spent several years of his life in Dominica, but his origins, as most of his other biographical details, are unknown. He was chief judge of Dominica, and afterwards of the Bahamas. He wrote <span class="italic">The History of the Island of Dominica</span>, published in 1791, and a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Observations on the true method of treatment and usage of the Negro slaves in the British West India Islands</span>. Dominica had been conquered by the British from the French in 1759 and formally ceded to Britain in the treaty of Paris in 1763. Atwood, in what was the first historical and general account of Dominica, wanted to demonstrate that the island was &#145;capable of being rendered one of the chief, if not the best, the English have in the West Indies&#146;  (Atwood, iii). It had more fertile and uncultivated land than the older colonies in the eastern Caribbean. He argued that the lack of cattle and of slaves were the main obstacles to the development of sugar plantations. It was briefly &#145;in a very flourishing situation&#146;  (ibid., 104) in the five years prior to the American War of Independence thanks to the free port at Roseau. It declined, with some three-fifths of the original sugar plantations abandoned, owing to rash speculation in the early years, mismanagement, and &#145;the great disadvantages this island laboured under, while it was in possession of the French&#146;  (ibid., 72) who captured the island between 1778 and 1783. The American War of Independence led to a &#145;total ruin of trade fatal to the welfare of this island in particular, as being then only in a state of infancy with respect of its settlement&#146;  (ibid., 106). Many English settlers emigrated, leaving &#145;half the number that there were&#146;  (ibid., 281). In his discussion of slavery Atwood defended the planters against their abolitionist critics, claiming that the slaves were better treated than labourers in England. Atwood died, presumably in debt, in the king's bench prison, London, at an advanced age, &#145;broken down with misfortunes&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 63/1, 1793, 576) on 27 May 1793. His history became a standard source of reference for early Dominica that was used by later historians of the British West Indies such as Bryan Edwards and Captain Thomas Southey.<br>
