<span class="headword">Clifford,  Henry</span>, first earl of Cumberland  (<em>c.</em>1493&#150;1542), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5646/', "Henry Clifford, tenth Baron Clifford (1454&#150;1523)")</script>, magnate, and his first wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1508), daughter of Sir John St John of Bletsoe, Bedfordshire, and his wife, Alice. He had a brother, Sir Thomas Clifford (<i>d</i>. 1543), a notable soldier, who acted on his behalf as constable of Carlisle between 1525 and 1529 and captain of Berwick, Northumberland, until 1538, four sisters, and a surviving half-sister. According to his great-granddaughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5641/', "Anne Clifford, countess of Pembroke, Dorset, and Montgomery (1590&#150;1676)")</script>, he was &#145;bred up for the first part, in his childhood and youth, with the said king [Henry VIII] &hellip; Which engrafted such a love in the said Prince towards him that it continued even to the very end&#146;  (Dickens, 140). There is indeed evidence that he was educated at court.<br>
<br>Clifford was made KB at the coronation of Henry VIII on 23 June 1509. He was not, however, one of the king's circle of chivalric companions or &#145;minions&#146;, nor does he ever seem to have sought a military reputation. As a young man he was criticized by his father for his ostentation, dressing &#145;more like a duke than a poor baron's son as he is&#146;, for assaults on Lord Clifford's servants, and for extorting leases of tithes from unwilling monastic houses  (T. D. Whitaker, <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of the Deanery of Craven</span>, 3rd edn, 1878, 327). He married Margaret (<i>d</i>. in or before 1516), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26927/', "George Talbot, fourth earl of Shrewsbury")</script>, and his first wife, Anne. She died only a year or two after the marriage and there were no children. Clifford married for a second time about 1516. His wife was Margaret (<i>c</i>.1492&#150;1540), first daughter of Henry Percy, fifth earl of Northumberland, and his wife, Catherine. They had two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5648/', "Henry Clifford, second earl of Cumberland (1517&#150;1570)")</script>, and Sir Ingram Clifford (1518?&#150;1578/9), and four daughters. In 1517 Clifford was imprisoned for a time in the Fleet prison for unknown offences. He succeeded his father on 20 April 1523, when he was said to have been about thirty, and was created earl of Cumberland on 18 June 1525 as part of a reorganization of the government of the north. At the same time the king's bastard son, Henry Fitzroy, was created duke of Richmond and earl of Nottingham, and Thomas Manners, twelfth Baron Ros, earl of Rutland. Cumberland was then in October appointed deputy warden of the west marches against Scotland under Richmond over the claims of William Dacre, third Lord Dacre of Gilsland. This experiment was not seen to be a success. Despite the title adopted for their earldom, the Clifford heartlands were in the West Riding of Yorkshire, around Skipton, and in the Eden valley, Westmorland, where they had castles at Brougham and Appleby. Cumberland had little standing in Cumberland or on the west marches, and found himself compelled to compete for offices and authority against Dacre. In late 1527 he was allowed to surrender the wardenship and Dacre was appointed in his place before 26 June 1528. Cumberland however remained in charge of Carlisle until August 1529, impairing Dacre's effectiveness as warden and provoking Dacre-inspired riots in the city.<br>
<br>Cumberland supported Henry's divorce from Katherine of Aragon and, with other nobles, signed a letter to Clement VII, asking him to grant it, on 13 July 1530. In 1534, in ways that are not clear, he was complicit in the fall of Dacre and in the charges of treasonable communication with the Scots brought against him by Sir William Musgrave. Dacre was acquitted at a trial by his peers in July but subsequently fined &pound;10,000 and deprived of his offices by the king. Cumberland was appointed warden of the west marches for a second time in September and again his record was mixed. He could not secure the co-operation of the Dacres and once more was forced to compete for the monastic and crown stewardships that were held by them as adjuncts of the warden's office. Dacre also maintained that Cumberland had purloined his goods after his arrest: this grievance was still a sore point between the families as late as 1554. The tensions between the Clifford and Dacre factions were made plain when Richard Dacre attempted to stab Musgrave in the presence of Cumberland's son, Henry, Lord Clifford, in Carlisle on 9 December 1536. As a result Cumberland, Musgrave, and Dacre and their various supporters were severely admonished by Henry VIII in a letter of 24 January 1537. Cumberland's friends on the privy council urged him on 31 January to take the opportunity to surrender the wardenship, reminding him of his reluctance to accept the office in the first place. He wrote to the king offering to resign, but seems to have remained titular warden until the end of his life. The day-to-day responsibilities passed to Thomas Wharton. There is little evidence to suggest that Cumberland sought what was almost certainly an unattractive office on the borders. Rather he was used as an alternative at moments when the Dacres were politically out of favour. His own interests seem to have lain entirely in expanding his family's influence in the West Riding. It is striking that neither he nor his heir took the opportunity to acquire monastic lands in Westmorland, many of which (including Shap, where the tenth Lord Clifford may have been buried) were purchased by Wharton.<br>
<br>Cumberland's loyalty to the king is seen most clearly during the Pilgrimage of Grace in 1536&#150;7. He was initially instructed to lead a force to Hexham, Northumberland, where the monks had barricaded themselves in the monastery in defiance of the commissioners sent to suppress it. He appears to have attempted to reach Hexham about 16&#150;17 October 1536, but to have been beaten back to Skipton. He took refuge in his castle and faced a short siege from a party of the Richmondshire commons who deviated to Skipton on their way to Pontefract, West Riding, apparently with the aim of recruiting Cumberland to their cause. The force he had gathered (probably to lead to Hexham) melted away and he was left to defend Skipton with household servants alone. A party of Clifford women including Eleanor Clifford, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brandon (1519&#150;1547), Cumberland's daughter-in-law, were stranded at Bolton Priory and were led back through the rebels' lines by the earl's steward and cousin, Christopher Aske, brother of Robert Aske, the grand captain of the pilgrims. Cumberland was impotent to influence the course of the pilgrimage. While he made much of his defiance, the truth is that he was in fact trapped in his castle by an insurrection of his own tenants, who attacked his houses and killed his deer. A delegation was sent to him to try and persuade him to attend the York conference on 22 November but his refusal to lend any weight to the Pilgrimage of Grace was total. Henry, Lord Clifford managed the defence of Carlisle against the Cumberland commons. In the new year Cumberland appears to have tried to implement the king's instruction to seize the captains of the rebellious commons. His attempt to seize their leaders around Kirkby Stephen, Westmorland, prompted a renewal of the conflict in Westmorland and Cumberland. A second attempt to besiege Carlisle failed after the castle garrison under Cumberland's bastard, Thomas Clifford (<i>d</i>. in or after 1555), issued from the town and, with the aid of a force led by Sir Christopher Dacre, routed the commons on 16 February 1537. Henry's gratitude made it impossible for Cumberland to be dismissed from the wardenship, hence the arrangement where Wharton took over the duties but was denied the title. Cumberland was elected to the Order of the Garter on 23 April 1537 to reward his loyal service.<br>
<br>When Cumberland had livery of his lands on 18 July 1523, they had a gross annual rental of &pound;1332. He had already acquired the manor of Carleton in Craven in 1514 but made no further acquisitions until he secured the Craven manors of Marton Priory by purchase from Charles Brandon, first duke of Suffolk, in 1541. In April 1542 he was granted by letters patent the Craven estates of Bolton Priory&#151;a house with which the Cliffords were traditionally associated as founders&#151;worth nearly &pound;400 per annum, in reward for royal service. The augmented estates were valued at &pound;1720 per annum in the earl's inquisition post mortem. As a landlord, Cumberland needs to be defended against the assertions that he was raising the cornage rents of his tenants in Westmorland and that he was rapacious in his treatment of tenants in Craven. He was, however, a notable encloser. Some of his Craven enclosures were destroyed in riots in May 1535, and his new fences in the Eden valley were thrown down in the unsettled conditions of the winter of 1536. Thomas Howard, third duke of Norfolk, was particularly critical of Cumberland's estate policies: &#145;he must be brought to change his conditions, that is to say, not to be so greedy of getting money of his tenants and others under him&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 12/1, no. 919). His predatory manner may also be seen in his dealings with Furness Abbey over their manor of Winterburn in Craven. Cumberland clearly coveted this manor. He later claimed to have a lease from 1531, but it was known from 1536 onwards that this was a forgery, made after some of the monks, during the vacancy of 1531, broke into a chest and applied the convent seal to some blank parchments. While the facts were well established, Cumberland insisted on the validity of this lease and persistently ejected the manor's tenants.<br>
<br>Cumberland died on 22 April 1542 and was buried on 2 May at Skipton, where his tomb may still be seen in the parish church. His will, dated 2 April 1542 and proved on 4 June 1543, suggests orthodox religious tastes: he left money to pay for the singing of a requiem and dirge by every curate in Westmorland and Craven willing to do so, and for an obit to be established in Skipton parish church. His wife predeceased him, dying on 25 November 1540 at Skipton.<br>
