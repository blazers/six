<span class="headword">Kinnemond,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1657), <span class="occ">army officer in the Swedish service</span>, was born in Scotland at a place noted in the Swedish peerage lists as Calensk or Calensh. Although it is uncertain who his parents were, it is known that he and his brother Patrick emigrated to Sweden in the 1620s, before entire Scottish regiments began to take service in Sweden, and so the brothers served with Swedish troops. Little information survives on Patrick, who joined the Swedish army in 1624, and rose to the rank of colonel before he died in 1645.<br>
<br>Thomas Kinnemond served first as an ensign in Johan Baner's &Ouml;sterg&ouml;tland infantry regiment in 1628, where he subsequently became a lieutenant under Erik Hand's command in 1629. He became major of the city militia in Augsburg in 1633. Not much is known of Kinnemond's movements after this until 1637 when he was appointed master of court at the castle in Koporie in Ingermanland; and in 1640 he was a lieutenant-colonel of a squadron of Viborg men. He became a full colonel in 1649 and was the colonel-in-chief of the Viborg regiment by 1651. During this time he also served as the commandant at Nyenm&uuml;nde Fort.<br>
<br>In 1650 Kinnemond was naturalized and ennobled, as was his brother, posthumously, in a wave of ennoblements authorized by Queen Kristina of Sweden. His social standing was further enhanced by the land in Livonia which he inherited through his uncle John, who had also entered the Swedish service. In 1651 Kinnemond became a colonel and commandant at D&uuml;nam&uuml;nde Fort, which he himself had constructed. It is not known when he married Christina Scott, the daughter of Colonel James Scott and his wife, Margaret Gibson, although his choice of a Scottish wife implies that his ties to Scotland were still strong. They had seven children, of whom only two survived. He died in 1657. His son Patrick also entered Swedish service.<br>
