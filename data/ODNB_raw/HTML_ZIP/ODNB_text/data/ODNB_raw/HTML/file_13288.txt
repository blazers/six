<span class="headword">Hill,  Pascoe Grenfell</span>  (1804&#150;1882), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, son of Major Thomas Hill, was born at Marazion, Cornwall, on 15 May 1804. He was educated at Mill Hill School, London, and at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA in 1836. In the same year he was ordained priest, and became a chaplain in the Royal Navy. During his service at sea he saw much of the slave trade on the African coast and published two accounts of his experiences. The first, <span class="italic">Fifty Days on Board a Slave-Vessel in the Mozambique Channel</span> (1844), went to several editions in Britain and the United States and was reissued as late as 1993, being of value for its firsthand account of the shipping of slaves. In 1845 he was placed on the retired list.<br>
<br>On 26 January 1846 Hill married Ellen Annetta (surname unknown). They had at least two sons before her death on 18 April 1878. From 1852 to 1857 he was chaplain of the Westminster Hospital, and for some time morning reader at Westminster Abbey. On 26 January 1863 he was appointed rector of St Edmund the King with St Nicholas Acons, Lombard Street, City of London, where he continued until his death. A high-churchman, he provided a succession of preachers for his church, improved its choir, and held short services in the middle of the day. He was the first to introduce a surpliced choir into a City church.<br>
<br>As well as his works on slavery Hill wrote: <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> (1845), a volume, mainly of love poems, whose publication he later regretted; <span class="italic">A Journey through Palestine</span> (1852) and <span class="italic">A Visit to Cairo</span> (1853); and also historical works and a <span class="italic">Life of Napoleon</span> (3 vols., 1869). He died at home at the rectory house, 32 Finsbury Square, London, on 28 August 1882, and was buried in the City of London cemetery at Ilford.<br>
