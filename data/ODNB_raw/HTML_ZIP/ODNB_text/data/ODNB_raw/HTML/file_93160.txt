<span class="headword">Shipman,  Harold Frederick</span>  (1946&#150;2004), <span class="occ">mass murderer</span>, was born on 14 January 1946 at 163 Longmead Drive, Edwards Lane, Nottingham, the eldest son (and second of three children) of Harold Frederick Shipman (1914&#150;1985), lorry driver, and his wife, Vera, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Britton (1919&#150;1963), daughter of a bricklayer's labourer. His family was the epitome of working-class decency: his father was quiet, neat, and conscientious; his mother was respectful, house-proud, and wanted her children to better themselves. She encouraged her son&#151;who was always known to his family and contemporaries as Frederick or Fred Shipman&#151;to hold aloof from other boys on the Edwards Lane estate and to consider himself destined for superior things. He was an inconspicuous pupil at Whitemoor junior school (1954&#150;7) and High Pavement Grammar School, Nottingham (1957&#150;64). His mother's slow death from lung cancer when he was seventeen made a deep impression on him. His glimpse of the authority that physicians commanded in provincial communities probably influenced his decision at this time to read medicine at university. The power of morphine to ease his mother's pain may have started his lifelong fascination with the drug.<br>
<br>Shipman trained at Leeds University medical school (1965&#150;70). On his way there in the mornings, travelling on a double-decker red bus, he met a young window-dresser who became his first and only girlfriend: Primrose May (<i>b</i>. 1949), daughter of George Oxtoby, a Yorkshire farmworker and highways labourer. She was six months pregnant when they married on 5 November 1966. Their daughter was born in 1967, and three sons followed in 1971, 1979, and 1982.<br>
<br>For three and a half years Shipman worked as a junior houseman at Pontefract General Infirmary (1970&#150;74). He was confident, pleasant, and conscientious with patients, but aloof and unapproachable with colleagues, and had marked contempt for anyone whom he considered stupid. He is suspected of hastening the deaths of terminally ill patients at Pontefract as early as 1971; his first identifiable victim died on 12 April 1972. He seems to have felt intrigued by the power of opiates and to have enjoyed his own secret power in administering lethal doses.<br>
<br>While working in the hospital's gynaecology ward and obstetrics unit Shipman began secretly injecting himself with pethidine, a synthetic opiate used as an analgesic in childbirth. He left Pontefract in 1974 to work as a general practitioner at the Abraham Ormerod Medical Centre in Todmorden, and in January 1975 he may have resumed administration of fatal opiate overdoses to terminally ill patients whose deaths were imminent. Later that year he was forced to resign from the Todmorden practice and undergo voluntary treatment for pethidine addiction at a psychiatric unit at York. In February 1976, at Halifax magistrates' court, he was convicted of obtaining a controlled drug by deception, unlawful possession of a controlled drug, and forging declarations of exemption from prescription charges. He was fined &pound;600, but soon afterwards found work as South-West Durham Health Authority's clinical medical officer responsible for child healthcare.<br>
<br>On 1 October 1977 Shipman began work as one of seven physicians in the Donneybrook medical practice at Hyde in Cheshire. With patients he was tolerant and attentive, but he was arrogant and overbearing with medical colleagues, and Donneybrook's non-medical employees were subjected to his caustic, irritable, and aggressive behaviour. Shipman had, it may be said, a superiority complex: he wanted to feel omnipotent, realized that the ultimate power is that of deciding life and death, and made himself Britain's most prolific serial killer out of vanity. In his fourteen years at Donneybrook he is known to have killed seventy-one patients, probably using morphine, and thirty further suspicious deaths were identified. By no means all his victims were terminally ill: many of them were reasonably hale, and some were not ill at all.<br>
<br>In 1992 Shipman resigned from the Donneybrook practice in a devious, ruthless manner that caused his former partners heavy financial losses. He then opened his own one-man practice in Market Street, Hyde, called The Surgery. Working alone he proved even deadlier and between 1992 and 1998 he murdered at least 143 patients. Other physicians in Hyde and Greater Manchester found Shipman supercilious and too confident in the rightness of his opinions, but his patients were delighted with his attentiveness. He liked to feel patients were besotted with or awed by him. There was a two-year waiting list to become a Shipman patient.<br>
<br>Shipman enjoyed browbeating grief-stricken families, and made callous remarks in the presence of the dead. He relished the arbitrary use of his medical authority, and was a cruel, remorseless, and self-infatuated criminal. He murdered, among others, the mother, mother-in-law, and two aunts of his own receptionist. Eventually the high level of mortality among Shipman's patients was noticed by Hyde undertakers, a warden of sheltered accommodation, and another local physician. This led to a slipshod police investigation that exonerated him in April 1998.<br>
<br>Shipman murdered another patient in May, and two in June of that year. In the case of the last of these, Kathleen Grundy, he had typed a clumsily forged will, bequeathing all her property to him, shortly before he killed her. This attempted fraud was singularly inapposite, given that Mrs Grundy's daughter was a solicitor, who kept her mother's real will in her office safe. Shocked by the suddenness of her mother's death and reluctant to believe that her mother would have made so inept and untidy a will, cutting out her own family, the daughter reported the suspected forgery to the police. Mrs Grundy's body was exhumed and found to contain diamorphine, and Shipman was arrested on 7 September 1998. After further investigations and exhumations, Shipman's trial for the murder of fifteen women and for the forgery of Mrs Grundy's will opened on 5 October 1999 at Preston crown court and lasted for fifty-seven days. He testified in his own defence, denying all the accusations and offering no mitigating circumstances; but the evidence was overwhelming, and he was convicted on 31 January 2000, and sentenced to fifteen life sentences and four years for forgery. In order to protect his wife's pension rights and financial entitlements Shipman hanged himself on 13 January 2004 in Wakefield prison. An official public inquiry chaired by Dame Janet Smith (2001&#150;5) attributed 218 murders to him (171 women and 47 men between the ages of 47 and 93), and listed 63 suspicious deaths.<br>
