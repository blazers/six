<span class="headword">Taylor,  Samuel</span>  (1748/9&#150;1811), <span class="occ">stenographer and angler</span>, was born probably at or near Shrewsbury, Shropshire. In his treatise <span class="italic">Angling in All its Branches, Reduced to a Complete Science</span> (1800), Taylor stated that the Severn, particularly the Terne brook, was the scene of his earliest fishing exploits. When a boy he was permitted by the owner of those waters<blockquote>to angle in any part of it, where I have often taken so many of these noble <i>Perch</i>, that I have gone a mile or two round rather than pass by that gentleman's hall, as if conscious that I had made too shameful a slaughter. (<span class="italic">Angling</span>, 35)</blockquote>Taylor was apparently married and had two children. Nothing else is known of his life until late 1781 when, as the originator and teacher of a shorthand system more simplified and practical than those of his predecessors, he launched an extensive teaching tour of England, Scotland, and Ireland, which ended in the summer of 1784. Taylor taught his then unpublished system at Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and at least seven other cities and towns in Scotland. Among the testimonials to the excellence of his method and his teaching was that of the poet James Beattie, then professor of moral philosophy and logic at Marischal College, Aberdeen, to whose son Taylor gave six lessons for the fee of 1 guinea and 1 shilling. Taylor spent about a year in Ireland, and recorded on 29 October 1783 a speech in the Irish parliament by John Foster.<br>
<br>Taylor's system, as modified and refined during the course of his tour, was published on 1 January 1786 as <span class="italic">An Essay Intended to Establish a Standard for an Universal System of Stenography, or Short Hand Writing</span>, its author being described as &#145;many years professor, &amp; teacher of the science at Oxford, &amp; the universities of Scotland &amp; Ireland&#146;. Dedicated to Frederick, Lord North, chancellor of the University of Oxford, the work had 312 subscribers, including Sir Thomas Dundas, to whom <span class="italic">Angling</span> was later dedicated.<br>
<br>Taylor's system, which was indebted to William Williamson's <span class="italic">Stenography</span> (1775), was arguably the best shorthand system before that of Sir Isaac Pitman, whose early work was based on Taylor's. Taylor's system presented a simplified alphabet that admitted of less ambiguity when characters were joined, indication of vowels only when sounded in initial or final position, use of only three terminations, no arbitraries, and a high degree of legibility.<br>
<br>Taylor did more than any of his predecessors to establish the art and use of shorthand in Great Britain, and his influence extended quickly throughout Europe. A petition promoting the adoption of Taylor's system was introduced in the Assembl&eacute;e Nationale Legislative on 25 June 1792. His system was adapted and translated into French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Swedish, and Hungarian. Adapted and improved in English by some forty authors, most notably William Harding, George Odell, and John Henry Cooke, it remained in use throughout the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>In 1800 <i>Taylor notarius</i> yielded the field to <i>Taylor piscator</i>  (Wright, 1.34) with the publication of <span class="italic">Angling in All its Branches</span>. Although some confusion arose in the nineteenth century concerning the authorship of this work, and it was often assigned to another writer of the same name (including in the British Library catalogue), evidence such as the wording of the dedication and other stylistic similarities indicates that Taylor wrote both on stenography and on angling  (see A. T. Wright). <span class="italic">Angling in All its Branches</span> represented the culmination of Taylor's more than forty years' experience as an angler: the work lists alphabetically the counties of Great Britain and describes the fishing waters of each, an arrangement borrowed by the Revd William Barker Daniel in his popular <span class="italic">Rural Sports</span> (2 vols., 1801&#150;2). It also describes various fish, and discusses the merits of different types of bait and artificial flies, with instructions for their creation and use.<br>
<br>Allowing even for the rhetorical conventions of the time, Taylor's works suggest a man deferential to patrons and sometimes patronizing to others. Taylor died on or about 4 August 1811 at his home in Palace Street, Pimlico, London, and was buried on 10 August 1811 in St Margaret's Chapel yard, Westminster. His obituary  (<span class="italic">Sun</span>, 2 Sept 1811) claims he was an eccentric, secretive man of &#145;strange and rough&#146; manners, who none the less held a high reputation as a teacher.<br>
