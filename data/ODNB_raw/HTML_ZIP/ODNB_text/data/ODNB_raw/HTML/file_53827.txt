<span class="headword">Fanque,  Pablo</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>William Darby]</span>  (1796&#150;1871), <span class="occ">equestrian performer and circus proprietor</span>, was born in Norwich on 28 February 1796, the third son of John Darby, a butler of African descent, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stamps. He was baptized on the same day because he was not expected to live. Orphaned at an early age, he was apprenticed to William Batty, the owner of a travelling circus, and grew proficient in tumbling, posturing, leaping, rope-dancing, and riding. He became a member of Andrew Ducrow's troupe at Astley's Amphitheatre in London, but later rejoined Batty and in 1828 was billed as &#145;Young Darby&#146;. It is not known when and why he adopted the name Pablo Fanque, but he was noted using it with Batty's company in Liverpool during the 1835&#150;6 season, when he performed on the &#145;corde volante&#146;, and in 1836, when he was described as the loftiest jumper in England, leaping the length of a post-chaise, with a pair of horses in the shafts, and through a military drum. In 1841 Fanque left Batty to set up on his own account with two horses; he was initially partnered by W. F. Wallett. Over the next six years he built up one of the finest studs of horses and ponies in the country, and his circus, which used wooden buildings rather than tents, travelled throughout the country, especially in Lancashire and the north. He employed many of the most famous artistes of his day. His fortunes fluctuated, and from about 1865 his circus was in decline.<br>
<br>Fanque married Susannah Marlaw (<i>c</i>.1801&#150;1848), the daughter of a Birmingham button maker; their son Lionel (1835&#150;1919) was a celebrated equestrian clown. Fanque's wife was killed on 18 March 1848 in Leeds, when the balcony at her husband's circus collapsed. Three months later (11 June 1848) he married Elizabeth Corker (<i>c</i>.1829&#150;1896) of Sheffield, an equestrian performer thirty years his junior. With her he had two more sons, George (1854&#150;1881) and Ted (1855&#150;1937), who also went into the circus as equestrian clowns; all three of Fanque's sons took the surname Pablo.<br>
<br>Fanque continued to travel with his circus until his death at The Britannia inn, Stockport, on 4 May 1871. He was buried in the Woodhouse cemetery, Leeds, and his circus was taken over by Toby Knight, a roundabout proprietor. The Beatles' song &#145;Being for the Benefit of Mr Kite&#146; (1967) was prompted by a poster advertising an act at Fanque's Circus Royal, Rochdale, in 1843; John Lennon's lyrics referred to Fanque by name.<br>
