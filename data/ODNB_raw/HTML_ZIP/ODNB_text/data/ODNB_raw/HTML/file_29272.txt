<span class="headword">White, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1495?&#150;1567), <span class="occ">founder of St John's College, Oxford</span>, was in all likelihood born in 1495 to William White (<i>d</i>. 1523), a clothier of Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, and his wife, Mary, daughter of John Kebblewhite of South Fawley, Buckinghamshire. His birthplace has been disputed, but was probably Reading (rather than Rickmansworth), where it is possible that he attended the grammar school in his early years. In 1504 he was apprenticed to Hugh Acton, a prominent member of the Merchant Taylors' Company in London. Acton provided the capital upon which White's own trading ventures were initially founded, and his own later efforts to help worthy young men establish themselves with loans (not dissimilar to a fund for apprentices set up by Acton) were possibly an acknowledgement of his own debt to Acton's charity. With a bequest of &pound;100 from his late master, combined with a portion from his father, he was able to set up his own business in the cloth trade in 1523, after which his fortunes and status grew rapidly. In 1530 he became the first renter warden of the Merchant Taylors'; in 1533 he was senior warden; and he was probably master of the company in 1535, when he was assessed for the subsidy at &pound;1000. As a resident of the parish of St Michael Cornhill, he was elected alderman in 1544, a burdensome office which he initially refused, and it was only after a period of imprisonment in Newgate (during which the mayor ordered his shop to be shut up) that he relented. Shortly afterwards he was one of the aldermen who raised a loan for the war with Scotland, to which he contributed &pound;300.<br>
<br>White's large-scale charitable provision began in July 1542 with a gift of &pound;1400 to the corporation of Coventry which enabled the purchase of old priory lands. In 1551 the income from this land was secured in the form of interest-free loans for honest and thrifty apprentices from Coventry for forty years after White's death, after which the funds were to be made available in similar loans on a rotating basis to young men from Northampton, Leicester, Nottingham, and Warwick as well as Coventry. In 1545 he similarly bestowed Bristol with a gift of &pound;2000 for the purchase of land, the income from which was likewise directed by a trust established in 1566 which stipulated that sums of &pound;25 should be lent without interest for ten years to young men (preferably clothiers) of twenty-four different cities. It is likely that the cities selected were those involved in the cloth trade, with Bristol being favoured perhaps because of its guild of tailors in honour of St John the Baptist, the patron saint of the Merchant Taylors' Company, and to whom White dedicated the college he later founded. In the meantime he had expanded the scope of his business interests considerably as one of the London merchants responsible for opening up trade with Russia in 1553, and consequently as one of the promoters of the Muscovy Company of merchant adventurers which was granted a royal charter in 1555.<br>
<br>Having served as sheriff in London in 1547, White was elected lord mayor in August 1553, assumed office amid lavish pageantry in October, and was subsequently knighted. He proved a loyal supporter to Queen Mary, both as a financier and in his capacity as lord mayor. In July 1553 he had been one of those who had met the queen at Newhall, presenting her with a gift of 500 half sovereigns to indicate the good will of the corporation of London. During his mayoralty he sat on the commission for the trial of state prisoners&#151;notably including Lady Jane Grey and Thomas Cranmer; he received the Spanish envoys concerned with Mary's marriage treaty; he was instrumental in the suppression of Wyatt's rebellion, both through defending the city from the rebels at Southwark Bridge and subsequently through overseeing the commission for their trial as traitors; and he was in office for the eventual reception of Philip II of Spain. After Wyatt's execution he became caught up in Gardiner's measures to dispel rumours that the council had attempted to implicate Princess Elizabeth in the rebellion, and was summoned before Star Chamber for allowing rumour-mongers in the city to remain unpunished. Further mishap was narrowly averted when a bullet landed next to him while he was listening to a sermon at St Paul's, although this was probably a careless gunman's misadventure rather than an assassination attempt as has been alleged. Finally, his mayoralty was characterized by his efforts to reform the excesses of his fellow citizens with sumptuary legislation and proclamations against bowling alleys, morris dancing, games, and interludes.<br>
<br>On 26 February 1558 White's first wife, Avicia, was buried in the parish of St Mary Aldermary. Very little is known about her: she was a widow with three children when she married White towards the end of Henry VIII's reign, and it is possible that she was related to the Roper family. On 25 November 1558 he married Joan, widow of Sir Ralph Warren, whose two children White remembered in his will.<br>
<br>Perhaps it was because White never had any children of his own that his benefactions to others were so extensive. The most ambitious of these entailed his foundation of St John's College in Oxford. According to legend his idea to found a college came to him in a dream, which vision directed him to select the former Cistercian college, St Bernard's, as a site. A further source of inspiration may well have been the foundation of Trinity College, Oxford, by his good friend Sir Thomas Pope in March 1554. In May 1555 he obtained a royal licence to found a college comprising a president and thirty scholars. In March 1557 he obtained a new charter, and gave further endowments in this year and again in November 1560. In 1559 he had purchased Gloucester Hall which was intended to house 100 scholars, and in February 1567 he sought to ensure that forty-three scholars would be admitted from London, with preference given to pupils chosen by the master and wardens of the Merchant Taylors'. Despite his bequest of real estate valued at &pound;3634, with his overall outlay estimated at &pound;13,285, the college experienced severe privation in its early years. Suffering diminishing returns from the declining cloth trade, White had been unable to endow the college sufficiently to support his desired quota of scholars, and the college was initially dependent on admitting fee-paying commoners instead of the &#145;poore Scholars&#146; he had wanted to favour. The stability of the college was further threatened by Elizabeth I's religious policy which resulted in the removal of its first two presidents by 1567 for maintaining papal authority, and the deprivation of twelve fellows between 1567 and 1574. It is likely that White shared their Catholic sympathies up until his death, although this had not precluded his involvement in the establishment of the Merchant Taylors' School (in association with the puritan Richard Hills) in 1561, which had a decidedly reforming emphasis. Troubled by the differences emerging within the fellowship, one of the last letters he wrote to his college exhorted its members to &#145;love one another as brethren&#146; and to cease strife  (Stevenson and Salter, 427).<br>
<br>Thomas White died on 12 February 1567 at his house in Size Lane, London. As requested in his will, he was buried on 24 or 25 February in St John's College chapel, with a funeral oration by Edmund Campion. His intended gifts to St John's and his wife's jointure remained partly unpaid as a result of his dwindling income, leaving the college dependent on the judicious intervention of his executor, Sir William Cordell, and his widow dependent on the good will of the Merchant Taylors' Company for survival. She died on 8 February 1573.<br>
<br>Despite the ultimate disparity between his means and his intentions, White's name has been associated with charity for centuries after his death. He was celebrated as one of London's &#145;nine worthies&#146; by Richard Johnson in 1592, and characterized as the epitome of benevolence in John Webster's <span class="italic">Monuments of Honour</span> of 1624. Portraits of him survive in at least seventeen of the cities which benefited from his gifts, although only one (at the Merchant Taylors' in London) was painted in his lifetime. The inscription on a Jacobean portrait at Leicester commemorated him for his &#145;White name, White gifts, White soul&#146;, commending him as a &#145;White saint in heaven&#146;.<br>
