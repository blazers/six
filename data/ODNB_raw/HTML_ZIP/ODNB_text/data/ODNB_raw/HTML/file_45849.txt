<span class="headword">Green,  Sarah</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1790&#150;1825), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was, according to <span class="italic">A Biographical Dictionary of the Living Authors of Great Britain and Ireland</span>, &#145;a native of Ireland&#146;. Latterly her address was 18 Dartmouth Street, Westminster, near St James's Park. <span class="italic">Charles Henly, or, The Fugitive Restored</span>, published by the Minerva Press in 1790, is sometimes ascribed to her on the evidence of a <span class="roman">Minerva Library</span> catalogue of 1814 assigning the novel to &#145;Mrs Green&#146;. Several of her works were printed by the Minerva Press, including the treatise <span class="italic">Mental Improvement for a Young Lady</span> (1793), &#145;addressed to a favourite niece&#146;; its praise of Fanny Burney perhaps suggests novelistic ambition. In 1795 she defended the sanity of the visionary Richard Brothers (1757&#150;1824) in <span class="italic">A Letter to the Publisher of Brothers's Prophecies</span>; the glimpses of somewhat fervent spiritual life afforded there seem at odds with the conservatism of her other work.<br>
<br>In 1799 Green embarked on a productive career as a novelist, with the first work of fiction that can be attributed to her with any certainty, <span class="italic">Court Intrigue, or, The Victim of Constancy</span>. Over the next twenty-six years she produced a further sixteen substantial novels, usually under pseudonyms (a Cockney) or partially concealed authorship (S. G****). Much of her work was professedly satirical in character; in <span class="italic">Romance Readers and Romance Writers</span> (1810) and <span class="italic">Scotch Novel Reading, or, Modern Quackery</span> (1824) particularly, she addressed the issues of her profession in a highly self-conscious way. She also wrote historical romances, and in <span class="italic">The Carthusian Friar</span> (1814) produced a successful imitation of Radcliffean Gothic. There were also a number of tales of marriage in contemporary settings. Her novels were fairly expensive&#151;<span class="italic">The Royal Exile</span> (1811) was priced at &pound;1&#151;and most of them were reviewed in the standard journals. Comment was initially rather supercilious. <span class="italic">The Private History of the Court of England</span> (1808), a characteristic mix of history and invention, was loftily dismissed by the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> as a &#145;clumsy fiction&#146; of scurrilous intent because of its recasting of the prince of Wales's amours into a fifteenth-century setting  (58, January&#150;April 1809, 101). <span class="italic">The Reformist!!!</span> (1810), a satire on Methodism, was thought to be &#145;good-humouredly written&#146; but improper in its venturing onto religious controversy  (<span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>, 30, supplement, 31 January 1811, 676), while the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> found it too slavish in its adherence to government policy  (64, February 1811, 216&#150;17). The latter article also questioned the gender of the writer:<blockquote>we cannot be such dupes of the preface as to believe that the experience of a lady could have furnished all the scenes which are here delineated; and much less would we attribute to a female pen the great illiberality which occasionally displays itself.</blockquote>The view was reiterated in the same journal's review of <span class="italic">Good Men of Modern Date</span> (1811), though it was also noted that the work contained &#145;some grammatical errors that savour not of a classical education&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, 68, May&#150;August 1812, 109). None the less, guarded praise of the characterization and humour in the novels began to emerge, and the <span class="italic">British Critic</span> four times declared Green &#145;well qualified for much better undertakings&#146; (35, January&#150;June 1810, 299; 36, July&#150;December 1810, 407; 37, January&#150;June 1811, 414; and 39, March 1812, 311). The last dated work ascribed to her is <span class="italic">Parents and Wives, or, Inconsistency and Mistakes</span> (1825).<br>
