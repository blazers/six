</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mattocks <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hallam]</span>,  Isabella</span>  (1746&#150;1826), <span class="occ">actress and singer</span>, was born at 3 Lambeth Street, Whitechapel, London, in 1746, and baptized at St Mary, Whitechapel, on 25 May, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64342/', "Lewis Hallam (1714?&#150;1756?)")</script> and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64345/', "Sarah Hallam (d. 1774)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64342/', "Hallam, Lewis")</script>]. Both her parents were actors, as were her father's sister Ann and his brothers, Adam, George, and William. Her paternal grandfather, the actor Thomas Hallam, had been accidentally killed by Charles Macklin during a green-room quarrel in 1735, and she was also related to the family of John Rich, the Covent Garden patentee. Her father was in financial difficulties by the early 1750s and in 1752 went to North America as manager of a group of English actors, taking his wife and three older children but leaving Isabella in the care of his sister Ann and her second husband, the actor John Barrington.<br>
<br>Isabella believed that she took her first acting role at the age of four and a half, when she appeared as the Parish Girl in John Gay's <span class="italic">The What D'Ye Call It</span> for her uncle's benefit at Covent Garden. This must have been on 1 April 1752, when she was nearly six and was so small that a gentleman commented &#145;he could hear her very well, but he could not see her without a glass&#146;  (&#145;Biographical sketch of Mrs Mattocks&#146;, 323). The Barringtons were members of the Covent Garden company, and during the next six years the young Isabella made a few appearances there each season, acting the Parish Girl, the Duke of York in <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, and various pages, including Robin in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>. She later wrote that her aunt and uncle became parents to her in the tenderest sense of the word, and gave her &#145;an expensive and a finished education&#146;  (ibid.). It seems likely that she was at school from 1758 to 1762, when she made very few stage appearances. During the summer season at Jacob's Wells Theatre, Bristol, in 1760 she sang and played the guitar at her aunt's benefit. In April 1761, at Ann Barrington's Covent Garden benefit, she played her first adult role, Juliet, with her aunt as Lady Capulet, and for the Barringtons' joint benefit the following year she again acted Juliet and also sang Laura in William Boyce's musical afterpiece <span class="italic">The Chaplet</span>.<br>
<br>In autumn 1762 the sixteen-year-old Isabella joined the Covent Garden company, where she remained, apart from the two seasons 1784&#150;5 and 1785&#150;6, for the next forty-six years. She took eighteen roles during her first season alone, in both comedies and tragedies, including Dorinda in George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Stratagem</span>, Miss Hoyden in John Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Relapse</span>, and Serina in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">The Orphan</span>. &#145;Having an exceeding good natural voice, improved by a knowledge of music&#146;  (<span class="italic">Theatrical Biography</span>, 2.13), she created many roles in English operas and musical afterpieces, beginning with Lucinda, the lively second heroine of Isaac Bickerstaff's <span class="italic">Love in a Village</span> (8 December 1762). During the next two seasons Miss Hallam sang Nysa in Kane O'Hara's burletta <span class="italic">Midas</span>, Sylvia in the nineteen-year-old Charles Dibdin's <span class="italic">The Shepherd's Artifice</span>, and Theodosia in Bickerstaff's <span class="italic">The Maid of the Mill</span>. The handsome tenor <a href="#cosubject_76191">George Mattocks [<i>see below</i>]</a> was the young male lead in these pieces, and he and Isabella were married in the first few days of April 1765, during the Easter break. They reputedly eloped to France because the Barringtons opposed the match, possibly for economic reasons or because of George Mattocks's earlier love affairs. However, friendly relations with her aunt and uncle were soon re-established. Mr and Mrs Mattocks sang together in Bickerstaff's <span class="italic">Lionel and Clarissa</span> (25 February 1768), O'Hara's <span class="italic">The Golden Pippin</span> (6 February 1773), Sheridan's <span class="italic">The Duenna</span> (21 November 1775), and other less long-lasting works. Isabella Mattocks also sang in Gloucester at the 1769 Three Choirs meeting and in some of the Covent Garden oratorio seasons. Although successful as Ophelia, she was considered too short and not beautiful enough for leading parts in tragedy. Younger sopranos took over her musical roles in the early 1780s, but by then she was firmly established as a favourite comic actress, specializing in pert servant girls, vulgar citizens' wives, old maids, and gossips.<br>
<br>Both George and Isabella Mattocks were rumoured to have indulged in short-lived infidelities, she with the actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2135/', "Robert Bensley (1741/2?&#150;1817)")</script> and he with Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1780), the wife of the theatre musician John Abraham Fisher, but their marriage endured. She accompanied her husband to the various summer theatres of which he was the manager and, after the death of John Barrington in January 1773, her aunt acted with them in the Liverpool summer seasons for the next few years. Isabella Mattocks left Covent Garden in June 1784 to work full-time with her husband in his Liverpool and Manchester theatres, but after two years of an over-ambitious programme he was ruined financially. In autumn 1786 she returned to Covent Garden, where, until her retirement twenty-two years later, she played numerous parts every season in revivals and new plays. John O'Keeffe, who called her &#145;sweet Mrs Mattocks&#146;  (O'Keeffe, 2.411), wrote Betty Blackberry for her in <span class="italic">The Farmer</span> (1787) and Mrs Cockletop in <span class="italic">Modern Antiques</span> (1791). She created Widow Warren in Thomas Holcroft's <span class="italic">The Road to Ruin</span> (1792), Mrs Placid in Elizabeth Inchbald's <span class="italic">Every One has his Fault</span> (1793), Lady Sarah Savage in Frederick Reynolds's <span class="italic">The Rage!</span> (1794), and Miss Lucretia Mac Tab in George Colman the younger's <span class="italic">The Poor Gentleman</span> (1801), where she was said to have worn the dress that was made for her when she first played Lucinda in <span class="italic">Love in a Village</span>. She was much admired as a speaker of epilogues, particularly those written for her by Miles Peter Andrews. Some critics found her manner and facial expressions too vulgar, and James Boaden commented:<blockquote>in her private manners she was rather refined, and had some of the graceful ease of the old school. On the stage she had a taste for the greatest <i>breadth</i> of effect, and excited probably as much laughter as [William] Lewis himself. (Boaden, <span class="italic">Kemble</span>, 1.84)</blockquote>In the summer she generally joined her husband in Liverpool, where he was treasurer of the theatre, and she acted in his last benefit there in 1802, two years before his death. Mrs Mattocks gave her final performance at Covent Garden on 7 June 1808, playing Flora in Susannah Centlivre's <span class="italic">The Wonder</span>, &#145;with all the freshness and spirit of a woman in her prime&#146; and speaking a simple, affecting farewell, &#145;having changed her stage dress for the lady-like attire of black silk&#146;  (&#145;Mrs Mattocks&#146;, 430).<br>
<br>George and Isabella Mattocks had one daughter, Isabella Anne (<i>b</i>. 31 October 1773), &#145;a very accomplished young lady&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 74, 1804, 884), who married a barrister, Nathaniel Huson, in 1801. Huson died ten years later, leaving his wife and young daughter unprovided for. John Genest records that Mrs Mattocks, who had given her son-in-law power of attorney, discovered after his death that he had sold her &pound;6000 of stocks and spent the money. On 24 May 1813 a benefit performance was organized for her at the King's Theatre, which raised the impressive sum of &pound;1092. Isabella Mattocks died at her home in High Street, Kensington, on 25 June 1826 and was buried on 1 July at St Mary Abbots, Kensington.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_76191"></a><span class="headword">George Mattocks</span>  (1734/5&#150;1804), <span class="occ">singer and theatre manager</span>, sang as a boy at Southwark fair in September 1746, and in August 1748 was advertised as singing and dancing at Bartholomew fair. A Miss Mattocks, perhaps his elder sister, acted minor roles at Southwark fair and at the Goodman's Fields Theatre in autumn 1746 and appeared at Covent Garden in early 1748. The young George Mattocks sang at Drury Lane in February and March 1749 in <span class="italic">The Triumph of Peace</span>, Thomas Arne's masque celebrating the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. He remained at Drury Lane until summer 1752, singing between the acts and in musical pieces and acting Donalbain in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>. After appearing in the provinces during the next few years, he returned to London to play Macheath in <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> at Covent Garden on 1 November 1757, advertised as having &#145;never appeared on that stage or any other these 6 years&#146;  (Stone, 623). In fact, he had sung the role for his benefit at Norwich earlier in 1757. Mattocks has been claimed as the father of two of the children of the actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22329/', "Harriet Pitt (1748?&#150;1814)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22326/', "Pitt, Ann")</script>], Harriet Pitt and George Cecil Pitt (<i>d</i>. 1820), but it is now known that George (<i>bap</i>. 1767, <i>d</i>. 1820) was the son of George Anderson, and that Harriet (<i>b</i>. 1770) was the daughter of the actor and composer Charles Dibdin.<br>
<br>Mattocks remained at Covent Garden for another twenty-seven years, performing incidental music, taking a few speaking parts, and creating the tenor young-lead roles in many English operas and afterpieces. He was the first Young Meadows in <span class="italic">Love in a Village</span> (1762), Apollo in <span class="italic">Midas</span> (1764), Lord Aimworth in <span class="italic">The Maid of the Mill</span> (1765), Lionel in <span class="italic">Lionel and Clarissa</span> (1768), Tom in Joseph Reed's <span class="italic">Tom Jones</span> (1769), Ferdinand in <span class="italic">The Duenna</span> (1775), and Don Fernando in O'Keeffe's <span class="italic">The Castle of Andalusia</span> (1782). <span class="italic">The Smithfield Rosciad</span> found &#145;Miss Molly Mattocks&#146;  (p. 18) soft and affected and <span class="italic">Theatrical Biography</span> complained of his stiffness and want of feeling, but <span class="italic">Thespis</span> praised his &#145;tender strain, so delicately clear&#146;  (Kelly, 2.24) and John Bernard found him, &#145;with the exception of [Joseph] Vernon, the best acting vocalist I ever saw&#146;  (Bernard, 1.3).<br>
<br>Bernard, a stage-struck boy in Portsmouth in the late 1760s, admired Mattocks walking to morning rehearsal in a gold-laced suit of green and white: &#145;such a swan-like dignity about him, such a fascinating glitter, and &#147;stand-out-of-the-way&#148; consequence; his feather floating, his skirts flying, his sword dangling, and his stick thumping, as he proceeded&#146;  (Bernard, 1.3). Mattocks acted in the provinces every summer, and in 1771 he became a lessee of the Portsmouth theatre. The following year, in partnership with the Covent Garden prompter Joseph Younger, he leased the newly built Theatre Royal at Liverpool. Then, in 1775, he and Younger also took a twenty-one-year lease on the Manchester theatre, and in 1779 Mattocks was involved with a theatre in Birmingham. Isabella Mattocks made summer appearances at these theatres, returning to Liverpool many times, while George Mattocks concentrated on management. In London he gradually lost his roles to younger singers, and he left Covent Garden at the end of the 1783&#150;4 season, moving with his wife to the north of England. Younger died in September 1784, leaving Mattocks in sole charge of the Liverpool and Manchester theatres. He established a strong company, with an impressive array of visiting stars in the summer, but after two years had sustained heavy losses, so that his wife was forced to return to Covent Garden. The bankruptcy of George Mattocks of Liverpool was announced in May 1788. After his financial ruin he apparently worked for Major John Halliday, a gentleman &#145;well known through the kingdom for theatrical talent, which he frequently displayed for charitable purposes&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 64, 1794, 672). Following Halliday's death in 1794, Mattocks was employed by the theatre manager Francis Aickin in a position variously described as treasurer and stage manager, working at Liverpool, at both Edinburgh and Liverpool in 1801&#150;2, and, after Aickin lost the Liverpool lease in early 1803, solely in Edinburgh. George Mattocks died at his lodgings in 5 Shakespeare Square, Edinburgh, on 14 August 1804. His funeral at the Calton burying-ground on 18 August was attended by &#145;a number of respectable friends and all the theatrical persons in Edinburgh&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 74, 1804, 884).<br>
