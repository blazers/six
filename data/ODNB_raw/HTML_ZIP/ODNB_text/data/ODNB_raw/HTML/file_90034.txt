<span class="headword">Cattaneo,  Ambrogio Antonio <span class="st"> [Tony]</span></span>  (1927&#150;2003), <span class="occ">animator</span>, was born on 15 February 1927 at 53 Hamilton Road, West Norwood, London, the son of Dante Cattaneo, a chef at the Savoy Hotel, originally from Gravedona, near Como, Italy, then living at 41 Burton Street, Euston Road, London, and his wife, Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Salusolia. In 1935 Cattaneo was taken to Italy by his father, and spent the next three years with an aunt in Caccivio, near Lake Como. Back in England in 1938, he and his family lived in Soho before moving out to Surbiton in Surrey. By the time he left school he had become interested in painting and worked painting backdrops for the window displays at Bentalls department store in Kingston, Surrey, while studying fine art in the evenings and weekends at Kingston College of Art. He began his career as a commercial artist by taking on commissions for advertising designs. On 15 January 1950 he married Lesley Margaret (Rita) Barnes (1924&#150;1995), a fashion buyer at Bentalls, and daughter of Charles Bertram Barnes, musician. They had one son and two daughters, one of whom died in infancy and the other at the age of twenty-one.<br>
<br>In 1957 Cattaneo was recruited as a trainee film animator by the screen advertising contractor Pearl and Dean, where he started out designing backgrounds for the films before becoming interested in animation. His future partner, Ron Wyatt, was also working for Pearl and Dean, and they met again in 1962 when Cattaneo joined the Richard Williams animation studio, where he was art director for several cinema commercials commissioned by Pearl and Dean, including one for Nescaf&eacute; instant coffee. Cattaneo and Wyatt left Richard Williams in 1965 to work freelance together, forming Wyatt Cattaneo Productions in 1965 after the success of their first commercial for Geers Gross. The latter had been commissioned by Spillers to produce an animated advertisement to promote its new lump-free flour: Cattaneo and Wyatt took the bowler-hatted flour graders and created a series of scenes in which Fred and his fellow flour graders jumped into bags of flour and sifted the lumps to a voiceover spoken by John Le Mesurier. Within four months Spillers Homepride flour had overtaken McDougalls to become the brand leader. Commercial television had been introduced into Britain in 1955, but for the first decade the press remained the most important advertising medium, and television commercials were little more than moving newspaper advertisements. But the success of the Homepride campaign alerted the advertising agencies to the potential of animation in advertising. Over the next twenty-five years Cattaneo animated such memorable characters as the Dunlop groundhog, the Typhoo gnu (winner of a golden lion at the 1976 Festival International du Film Publicitaire), the Country Life buttermen, the Tetley tea folk, and the KP Crisps monks. Advertising became part of television entertainment, and because the thirty-second animated commercials could stand repeated showings and were watched by millions of viewers the characters became household names, along with the products they advertised. Wyatt Cattaneo made fifty-four Homepride and fifty Tetleys films in all. Based for most of its existence above a gentlemen's outfitters at 22 Charing Cross Road, the studio limited itself to about thirty commercials a year. Although his main talent lay in animating the characters, Cattaneo was involved at every stage of each project, often helping the advertising agency to create the script. Wyatt Cattaneo became the leading producer of animated television commercials in Britain, but over half of its work was for agencies abroad.<br>
<br>Cattaneo directed two &#145;art films&#146; for the cinema, <span class="italic">Fairy Story</span> (1968) and <span class="italic">I Love You</span> (1969). He was also a book illustrator, illustrating Lewis Carroll's <span class="italic">The Walrus and the Carpenter</span> in 1974 and <span class="italic">The Lobster Quadrille</span> in 1977, in Warne's <span class="roman">Stuff and Nonsense Books</span> series. After retiring in 1990 he ran painting classes in his house, 7 Richmond Bridge Mansions, Willoughby Road, Twickenham. Although he suffered from periodic bouts of depression throughout his life, he created a friendly and happy atmosphere around himself, and had many friends. He died of cerebrovascular disease on 3 May 2003 at West Middlesex Hospital, Isleworth, London, and was buried at Richmond cemetery, Surrey. He was survived by his son, Peter Cattaneo, a film director, best known for <span class="italic">The Full Monty</span> (1997).<br>
