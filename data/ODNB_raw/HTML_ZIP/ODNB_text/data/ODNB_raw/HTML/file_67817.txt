<span class="headword">Murray,  Alma</span>  (1854&#150;1945), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 21 November 1854 in London, the daughter of Leigh Murray (1825&#150;1895), actor, and his wife, Sarah Mannering (1830&#150;1872). She was educated privately. On 8 January 1870 she made her first appearance on the stage at the Olympic Theatre, London, in <span class="italic">The Princess</span> by W. S. Gilbert. For the next nine years she was fairly regularly employed, sometimes in London, sometimes touring in the provinces. On 30 September 1876 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33203/', "Alfred William Forman (1840&#150;1925)")</script>, the first translator into English of Wagner's <span class="italic">Der Ring des Nibelungen</span>. They had one child, Elsa (1878&#150;1966). In 1879 she joined Henry Irving's company at the Lyceum, playing in <span class="italic">The Iron Chest</span> (by George Colman the younger), <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> (in which she played Jessica), <span class="italic">The Corsican Brothers</span> (by Dion Boucicault), and a one-act curtain-raiser, called <span class="italic">Bygones</span>, by A. W. Pinero, who was, at the age of twenty-four, a minor actor in the Irving company. Clement Scott, the senior theatre critic of the day, in his review of <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, referred to &#145;the silvery voice and intelligent utterance of Miss Alma Murray&#146;  (Scott, 169).<br>
<br>During the 1880s Alma Murray began to establish a widespread reputation as a particularly fine speaker of verse plays, sometimes in London theatre productions but often in single performances in assembly halls in and around London. Thus in 1884 she appeared at Prince's Hall in Robert Browning's play <span class="italic">The Balcony</span> and in 1885 at St George's Hall in Browning's <span class="italic">Colombe's Birthday</span> (playing the title role). And in 1886 she &#145;secured a triumph&#146;&#151;to quote the entry which she herself wrote for <span class="italic">Who's Who in the Theatre</span>&#151;as Beatrice in a single performance of Shelley's <span class="italic">The Cenci</span>, a performance so much admired by George Bernard Shaw that he tried very hard, in collaboration with the Shelley Society, to create a suitable circumstance for a repetition of it, an effort in which he was finally foiled by the ridiculous censorship regulations under which the British theatre suffered at that time. (Shelley's play is about an incestuous rape and Lord Lathom, the reader of plays in the lord chamberlain's office, refused to grant it a performance licence.) In 1888 she played one more Browning play: <span class="italic">A Blot in the `Scutcheon</span>, at the Olympic Theatre. Somewhat later, in July 1911 she once again deserted the &#145;popular&#146; theatre to appear in a &#145;poetic&#146; play: she was the Queen Genevi&egrave;ve in M. Maeterlinck's <span class="italic">Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</span> (played in English) at the Lyceum. (The play had been written in 1892, translated into English by Lawrence Alma-Tadema in 1895, and made into an opera by Debussy in 1902.)<br>
<br>On the strength of her enhanced reputation after playing Beatrice in <span class="italic">The Cenci</span>, Shaw invited Alma Murray in 1894 to play Raina in the first production of <span class="italic">Arms and the Man</span> which ran for fifty performances at the Avenue Theatre in London. The original plan had been for this part to be played by Florence Farr, the producer and the lessee of the theatre. Shaw had the tricky task of talking her out of the leading role and persuading her to play Louka, the self-willed servant girl. His guile succeeded and Alma Murray played Raina for the whole run. &#145;Miss Alma Murray lent her seriousness and charm (invaluable qualities both, as it happened) to the part of Raina; Miss Florence Farr made a memorable figure of the enigmatic Louka&#146;, said William Archer in <span class="italic">The World</span> on 25 April 1894.<br>
<br>Long before <span class="italic">Arms and the Man</span>&#151;indeed, before Shaw had written any plays at all&#151;he had said in a letter to Alma Murray (24 February 1888), in which he praised her acting though he disliked the play she was in: &#145;I wish I could write you a real play myself, but unfortunately I have not the faculty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Letters</span>, 188). But he never did, even when he had discovered that he <i>had</i> &#145;the faculty&#146;. Though she lobbied him energetically for parts from time to time she played only once more in a Shaw play: she was the Mrs Eynesford-Hill in the first production of <span class="italic">Pygmalion</span> in 1914. However, she became one of that seemingly endless procession of pretty women to whom Shaw paid court, at least in writing. He wrote to her on 1 June 1894:<blockquote>whenever any woman gives me the pleasure your playing [in <span class="italic">Arms and the Man</span>] tonight did, I cannot help falling violently in love with her; and I can no longer support the spectacle of Forman's [her husband] domestic happiness. He is a most intolerable usurper and monopolist; and the advantage he has taken of the mere accident of his knowing you before I did appears to me altogether unjustifiable. (ibid., 437&#150;8)</blockquote>And as late as December 1904, when she was fifty, Shaw&#151;writing to tell her why he felt it would be inadvisable to try to revive <span class="italic">Arms and the Man</span> and why he had not cast her as Nora in <span class="italic">John Bull's other Island</span> at the Court Theatre, and why he was not going to cast her as Mrs Clandon in <span class="italic">You Never can Tell</span>&#151;said, &#145;I can never think of you as middle-aged&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Plays</span>, 473).<br>
<br>Much earlier, in 1891, Alma Murray had made an attempt to challenge the supremacy (and near-monopoly) of Janet Achurch and Elizabeth Robins in the playing of those strange and powerful young women in the early productions in England of Ibsen's plays. She tentatively mooted a plan to present the first English production of <span class="italic">Rosmersholm</span> with herself as Rebecca; but it was, again, Shaw, who stepped in to tell her, in a letter dated 25 November 1890, that he had already persuaded Florence Farr to undertake such a production. (It played briefly at the Vaudeville Theatre in February 1891.)<br>
<br>Alma Murray appeared less and less frequently from 1915 onwards, and she retired completely from the stage shortly after the end of the First World War. She outlived her husband by twenty years and died in London on 3 July 1945 at the age of ninety.<br>
