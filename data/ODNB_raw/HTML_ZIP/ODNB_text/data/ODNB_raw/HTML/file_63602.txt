<span class="headword">Richter,  John</span>  (1769?&#150;1830), <span class="occ">radical and businessman</span>, was probably the John Richter born on 22 July 1769 (perhaps at 40 Great Newport Street, Soho) and baptized on 27 August at St Anne's, Soho, the eldest son of John Augustus Richter, artist and engraver, originally from Dresden, Saxony, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Haig. If so, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23599/', "Henry James Richter (1772&#150;1857)")</script> was a younger brother, as was Thomas Richter (<i>b</i>. 1777), later a director of the Phoenix Life Insurance Company; the identification is complicated by the existence of another brother, also named John (<i>b</i>. 1775).<br>
<br>The radical John Richter's first indisputable appearance in documentary records is as a 21-year-old clerk in a London banking house in 1790. His is one of several tantalizingly shadowy careers in the radical politics of London in the decades between the French Revolution and the <span class="roman">Great Reform Act</span> of 1832. Like many of his associates, Richter lacked the means to give his political activities the time he might have wished, or to achieve the public prominence won by those more aristocratic scions who dabbled in metropolitan reform politics. He joined the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42297/', "London Corresponding Society (LCS)")</script> in 1792 and became an associate member of the Society for Constitutional Information. Both organizations were dedicated to the principles of an extended suffrage and an incorruptible constitution. In May 1794 he was arrested for high treason along with other leading members of the LCS, but was released without trial after Thomas Hardy and John Horne Tooke were acquitted.<br>
<br>At a public meeting of the LCS on 7 December 1795 Richter proposed a petition to the king for the defence of popular liberties. During the period of repression that followed, when most radicals retreated from open political activity, he presumably continued to make his living as an accountant or bank clerk, re-emerging onto the political scene as a member of the Westminster election committee in 1807. He and Francis Place together wrote an account of the 1807 election in which Sir Francis Burdett was returned as radical MP for Westminster. In 1808 he was a speaker at the Crown and Anchor tavern where the radicals celebrated the anniversary of their victory, and later in the same year he drafted public resolutions in support of Spanish independence: &#145;a people who will fight for their liberties are alone worthy of the friendship of a free nation&#146;  (Hone, 167).<br>
<br>Consistently involved in the organizing committee of Westminster radicals chaired by the glass manufacturer Samuel Brooks, Richter took a stern line with Burdett's fellow MP Lord Cochrane, exacting pledges on his radical principles in return for the committee's support at the election of 1812. In addition to fighting for constitutional freedoms at home and abroad, Richter's own practical version of radicalism led him to support two models of self-help and <i>laissez-faire</i> in which the Westminster election committee worked with others to achieve advancement for working people. One of these was the West London Lancasterian Association, which promoted schooling for artisans' children on the principles of Joseph Lancaster, and with which Jeremy Bentham was briefly associated. The association foundered on the issue, among other things, of whether or not to charge fees; the radicals' line being (as recounted by Francis Place) that any form of charity was demeaning, and therefore parents, however poor, ought to pay moderate fees. Richter also acted as secretary to the Association of Master Manufacturers, chaired by a fellow member of the Westminster committee who had also belonged to the LCS, Alexander Galloway. In 1814 they won abolition of the Elizabethan <span class="roman">Statute of Artificers</span>, which had perpetuated protection for skilled artisans in a period when industrial change was making such restrictions onerous to manufacturers. There is no evidence to show that Richter later became involved in the campaign of the mid-1820s to repeal the <span class="roman">Combination Acts</span>, which bore much more oppressively on workers' freedoms, but the principles he espoused in the earlier campaign were consistent with an overall guiding rule among his closest associates: to seek legislative freedoms in the workplace as much as in the political and constitutional arena.<br>
<br>By 1816 Richter appears to have been working as company secretary to a sugar refining company: a calling which left him little time for politics, but apparently was not remunerative. At his death in 1830 he left his widow, details of whom are unknown, in distressed circumstances, and Place and Galloway opened a subscription on her behalf.<br>
