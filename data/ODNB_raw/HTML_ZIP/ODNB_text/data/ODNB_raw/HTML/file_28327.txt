<span class="headword">Vint,  William</span>  (1768&#150;1834), <span class="occ">Congregational minister</span>, was born at High Thrunton, near Whittingham, Northumberland, on 1 November 1768, the son of John Vint. He was educated at Alnmouth and at the grammar school of Warrenford. At about the age of fifteen he began to study theology at Northowram Academy with Samuel Walker, minister at Northowram. He soon gained fame as a preacher, and on 25 December 1790 was appointed minister at Idle in Yorkshire.<br>
<br>In 1795 the academy at Northowram was dissolved, and several of the students were temporarily placed with Vint for theological instruction. It was felt, however, that more permanent arrangements should be made, and, chiefly through the exertions of Edward Hanson of London, a regular academy was founded at Idle in 1800. Initially Vint worked as sole tutor, and had only four students, but his energy and reputation led the establishment to grow and prosper. On 21 June 1826 it received the name of Airedale Independent College. Vint continued to direct it until his last illness. On 5 March 1834 the college moved to Undercliffe, near Bradford.<br>
<br>Besides acting as tutor to Airedale College, Vint continued minister of Idle until his death. He married, on 17 June 1795, Sarah Sharp (<i>d</i>. 1855) of Idle, with whom he had six sons and two daughters. A printing press was established at Idle in 1824 under the management of his brother, John Vint, at which some seventeen of William's publications were printed. Besides sermons, he was the author of two works on the millennium, and the editor of a five-volume <span class="italic">Life and Works of Oliver Heywood</span> (1825&#150;7), a hymn book (1834), and three selections of discourses, <span class="italic">The Suffering Christian's Companion</span> (1830), <span class="italic">The Active Christian's Companion</span> (1830), and <span class="italic">The Privileged Christian's Companion</span> (1830). William Vint died in Idle on 13 March 1834, and was buried in the graveyard of his chapel.<br>
