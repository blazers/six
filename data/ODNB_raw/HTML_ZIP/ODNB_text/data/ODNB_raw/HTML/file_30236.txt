<span class="headword">Yorke <span class="st"> [York]</span>,  Rowland</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1588), <span class="occ">soldier and traitor</span>, was the ninth of eleven sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30233/', "Sir John York (d. 1569)")</script>, administrator, of York and St Stephen Walbrook, London, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1575), daughter of Robert Smyth of London. His brothers included Peter York (<i>c</i>.1542&#150;1589), of Gouthwaite, Yorkshire, a landowner and MP, and he had four sisters. He was said to be &#145;well borne and of gentle blood&#146; and benefited from his father's close association with John Dudley, duke of Northumberland, until the succession crisis of 1553  (Blandy, 27). The family was restored to favour at the accession of Elizabeth I. Nothing is known of Yorke's early life and education.<br>
<br>Yorke volunteered in 1572 for Sir Humphrey Gilbert's expedition to the island of South Beveland, important for access to Ter Goes, a major supply town used by the Spanish. Roger Williams's account describes vividly an ambush by the enemy outside Ter Goes, where most who entered with Yorke and himself were slain, leaving those who did survive to crawl through muddy ditches to escape. Yorke probably returned to England in the summer. He embarked from Gravesend, Kent, on 19 March 1573 with George Gascoigne, on a journey in which twenty men drowned; the vessel only managed to stay on course after it ran aground because Yorke and two others took control of the pumps. Having survived the seas, he joined Captain Thomas Morgan's English and Welsh force, sent unofficially to Flushing to aid the Dutch rebels against Philip II. He was initially Morgan's lieutenant but was promoted to lieutenant-colonel when his force was expanded in size.<br>
<br>In August 1578 Yorke was singled out by the English ambassador to the Netherlands, William Davison, in a letter to William Cecil, Lord Burghley, for his &#145;great value and reputacion&#146; during the battle of Rijmenam under the command of John Norris  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1578&#150;9</i>, 115). Yorke lost a horse or two under him, while the Spanish retreated with heavy casualties. He, deservedly confident of his own martial abilities, was not sympathetic to captains whose methods of leadership differed from his own, writing to Davison in October 1578 that he thought some were &#145;indiscreet and insufficient&#146;  (ibid., 223). However, this somewhat arrogant attitude left him open to personal attack. In October 1580 he was indicted for felony, &#145;unjustly committed&#146;, according to William Herle, on false charges  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1547&#150;80</i>, 684). Yorke's patron, Sir Francis Walsingham, principal secretary, received further reports during February 1581 that many captains had private quarrels with Yorke and &#145;begin to bandie against him&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>January 1581 &#150; April 1582</i>, 44). In contrast, William Blandy tried to help Yorke's reputation by emphasizing his potential as a general and a governor, describing him as &#145;bolde of courage, provident in direction, industrious in labour, and quick in execution&#146;  (Blandy, 26&#150;7).<br>
<br>Yorke was certainly industrious on behalf of his own men, and although professing he was &#145;not a good sekeritary&#146;, wrote dispatches to Walsingham about the frequent want of provisions, stressing in November 1581 from Oudenarde that he had only been paid four months out of thirteen  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>January 1581 &#150; April 1582</i>, 384&#150;5). In June 1582 Walsingham's contacts reported the mutiny of a camp near Bruges after the captains suspected that their commander, Norris, had detained payment. Yorke was named as the &#145;instrument&#146; through which the French had helped to &#145;blow the coals&#146; of animosity  (ibid., <i>May&#150;December 1582</i>, 164). This recalcitrant behaviour made Yorke a potential liability, but was perhaps overlooked by his superiors because of his evident military prowess.<br>
<br>In March 1584 Yorke was again in difficulties, this time imprisoned in Brussels, accused of conspiring with local Catholics to betray Ghent and Dendermonde to the Spanish. He was only freed in December thanks to the efforts of his brother, Edmund York, in securing letters from Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, and Sir Philip Sidney. However, Leicester and Sidney may only have taken action after Walsingham asked them to. The Dutch, who had dealt with their countrymen involved in the incident more ruthlessly, resented this special treatment. They remained deeply suspicious of Yorke's Catholicism. He was witnessed soon after &#145;frequenting the mass with his beads&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>June 1586 &#150; March 1587</i>, 87).<br>
<br>Yorke did not long remain out of trouble. Now owing a debt to Leicester, who was desperate for experienced officers, Yorke was appointed to the command of the Zutphen sconce, an important gain from the previous year. Leicester had fallen out with Norris and relied instead on Yorke and Sir William Stanley, who was in charge of Deventer. He granted them commissions that allowed them to serve independently of Norris. Norris wrote to Burghley in December 1586, begging that the additional powers be removed because they &#145;nourished factions&#146;; the garrison of Yorke's sconce was even refusing to muster  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>June 1586 &#150; March 1587</i>, 266&#150;7). Yorke complained increasingly to the states general during December about their broken promises to supply victuals, while &#145;the poor miserable subjects of her majesty &hellip; now are dying of cold, yea more than two hundred since my comying&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>June 1586 &#150; March 1587</i>, 246&#150;7). By early January 1587 it seems that he allowed his troops to extract provisions using force. Norris's grave concerns were proved correct when on 18&#150;19 January Yorke allowed the Spanish into Zutphen, after meeting with Stanley, who had already successfully betrayed his own garrison, using a banquet to lure the council of Deventer away while his troops took the gates.<br>
<br>The motivation behind Yorke's actions remains the subject of debate. Contemporary opinion, such as that in the work of protestant propaganda &#145;The estate of English fugitives&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers and Letters of Sir Ralph Sadler</span>, 2.232&#150;8), believed Yorke and Stanley were Catholic traitors. Yorke was regarded as the more dominant of the two; it was thought that he pressured Stanley to betray his garrison after secret meetings with Francisco Verdugo, the Spanish governor of the province. William Camden also believed Yorke was the one who &#145;drew Stanley&#146;, a soldier who had served with &#145;singular fidelity and valour&#146; up until that point  (Camden, 302). More recent opinion shifts the lead role to Stanley, who led Yorke astray. Charles Wilson refers to Stanley and Yorke as &#145;the perfect Walrus and Carpenter&#146;  (Wilson, 90). Simon Adams believes Yorke to be more personally motivated, out of fear that Norris would return him to the Dutch who were still eager to have him executed for his behaviour in 1584. As Yorke throughout his career comes across as a hothead and troublemaker, it may perhaps be that he was pushed too far by the harsh conditions within the army. Whereas another man might have been more patient, seeing the lack of provisions as unfortunate and widespread, Yorke was increasingly frustrated by the behaviour of fellow officers and his lack of reward for his years fighting for a protestant cause in which he did not really believe.<br>
<br>Walsingham was informed in March 1587 that Yorke had been seen in Antwerp but was determined only &#145;to go into Spain or Naples, there to live upon his stipend, out of the stir of these wars&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>June 1586 &#150; March 1587</i>, 392). Yorke was unable to retire quietly because the Spanish distrusted him too. It seems likely that he was poisoned at a dinner in the Netherlands in February 1588, the symptoms of which may have been mistaken for the effects of smallpox. Two fellow diners survived to relate how after Yorke's death the Spanish broke into his coffers, taking &#145;jewels, plate and monie&#146;, and also removed &#145;furniture, armes and horses&#146; willed by him to his nephew, Edmund Yorke (<i>d</i>. 1595), who was executed at Tyburn for attempting to assassinate Elizabeth  (<span class="italic">State Papers and Letters of Sir Ralph Sadler</span>, 2.238). Rowland Yorke was buried using traditional Catholic rites but the states general exhumed and hanged his remains three years later.<br>
