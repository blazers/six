<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hooker,  Thomas</span>  (1586?&#150;1647), <span class="occ">minister in America</span>, was probably born in 1586, possibly on 7 July, the son of Thomas Hooker (<i>d</i>. 1635), of Marfield (now Markfield), Leicestershire, a yeoman farmer and overseer of the Digby family's properties. His mother's name is unknown. Pre-seventeenth-century church records from Marfield are lost, but it is known that he had a brother, John, and two sisters, one perhaps called Anne, and Dorothy.<h2>
<a name="Education"></a>Education</h2>At some point Hooker was sent to the grammar school endowed by Sir Wolfstan Dixie at Market Bosworth, some 10 miles from Marfield, where he prepared for Cambridge. He matriculated there at Queens' College in 1604, but soon migrated to the decidedly puritan Emmanuel College, where he graduated BA early in 1608 and proceeded MA in 1611. In 1609 he was elected to a Dixie fellowship, one of two at the college endowed by Dixie and reserved to his relatives or to former pupils of Market Bosworth School. Hooker's contemporaries included such other future puritan lights as John Cotton, Anthony Tuckney, Zechariah Symmes, Simeon Ashe, and Nathaniel Rogers. During his years at Emmanuel, Hooker experienced an extended period of spiritual struggle that eventually resulted in his assurance of God's grace. This &#145;most experimental acquaintance with the truths of the gospel&#146;, as Cotton Mather described it  (Mather, 1.304), was later the basis for his vivid representation of the conversion process in his central series of sermons.<br>
<br>The college's account books indicate that Hooker left Emmanuel College's employ in the early autumn of 1618. Fourteen years in a university setting had provided him with a thorough grounding in the literature of church history and theology. He was deeply read in the <span class="roman">Bible</span> itself as well as in the writings of the church fathers, medieval Catholic churchmen, logicians such as Aristotle, Aquinas, and Ramus, Reformation leaders, and recent protestant commentators and disputants. His personal library at the time of his death was valued at &pound;300, indicating a large collection that comprised more than one-quarter of the value of his estate. Yet, despite his love for scholarship, he believed that no amount of learning could bring an individual soul closer to God. As he colourfully insisted, &#145;A dram of spirituall wisdome &hellip; is worth a thousand cart-loads of that dung-hill, carnall wisdome&#146;  (Hooker, <span class="italic">The Soules Exaltation</span>, 1638, 86). His long experience in academic circles led him to warn that &#145;Men of the greatest ability for depth of brain and strength of understanding are most hardly brought to brokennes of heart&#146;  (Hooker, <span class="italic">The Application of Redemption, the Ninth and Tenth Books</span>, 1656, 98).<h2>
<a name="Englishministry"></a>English ministry</h2>After leaving Cambridge, Hooker gave occasional sermons in his home county of Leicestershire, but his first settled post-academic position was as rector of St George's in Esher, Surrey. The patrons of that church were Sir Francis Drake and Joan, Lady Drake. Hooker became an important counsellor to Lady Drake, who was spiritually distraught, believing she had committed the unpardonable sin. Despite her previous care by several puritan ministers, including the venerable John Dod, it was Hooker, apparently drawing on the experience of his own recent spiritual struggles, who succeeded in bringing her relief. The case was witnessed by one Jasper Heartwell, a London barrister, whose pseudonymous <span class="italic">Trodden Down Strength</span> (1647) records the story, up to the moment of Lady Drake's death on 18 April 1625 in a state of assurance of her salvation.<br>
<br>On 3 April 1621 Hooker had married her woman-in-waiting, Susannah Garbrand, in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, Joan Drake's birthplace. Two daughters were born to the Hookers in the early 1620s: Joanna (<i>d</i>. 1647), named for Hooker's patron and later the second wife of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25325/', "Revd Thomas Shepard (1605&#150;1649)")</script> of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Mary, who later married the Revd Roger Newton, pastor at Milford, Connecticut. At some point in Hooker's Esher ministry, the bishop of Winchester, Lancelot Andrewes, silenced him &#145;on the complaint of King James&#146; himself  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/151/12), perhaps for his criticism of Prince Charles's proposed match with the Spanish infanta, Maria.<br>
<br>Some time after Joan Drake's death in 1625, Hooker accepted a post as lecturer and curate to John Michaelson, the rector of St Mary's, Chelmsford, Essex. In this location, Hooker's outspoken puritan principles soon earned him a reputation as one of England's most powerful and prominent voices of Independency. He strengthened devotion to the nonconformist cause by organizing a monthly conference of similarly inclined Essex ministers. Although as a lecturer, paid by privately donated moneys, he escaped the usual requirement of subscribing to the church's <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>, he was nevertheless under the close surveillance of the church authorities. Despite great popularity and the support of many colleagues, he eventually felt the force of the established church's intolerance of puritanism.<br>
<br>The earliest preserved sermon from Hooker's Chelmsford years was for the funeral of the Revd Robert Wilmott of Clare, Suffolk, a King's College graduate whom Hooker had known at Cambridge. Hooker took the occasion to lament the current crackdown by church authorities on nonconformists. It was also a period when the armies of Spain were crushing protestants in the Low Countries and an invasion of England itself was widely feared. Other sermons by Hooker from this period reflect a combination of sharp criticism of lax believers and pointed allusion to oppressions of ministers by church and state officials. This combination of spiritual and political concerns is expressed in such sermons as <span class="italic">The Faithful Covenanter</span> (1644), <span class="italic">The Stay of the Faithful</span> (1638), and <span class="italic">The Danger of Desertion</span> (1641).<br>
<br>Like many other puritans, Hooker was increasingly opposed to the English church's ecclesiastical hierarchy and to the use of &#145;human inventions&#146;&#151;scripturally unauthorized ceremonies&#151;in the church's forms of worship. Still, his overarching message was one of spiritual encouragement. In the market town of Chelmsford, his audience included the full range of society. Hooker intentionally &#145;chose to be where great numbers of <i>the Poor</i> might receive the <i>Gospel</i> from him.&#146; &#145;His lecture was exceedingly frequented&#146; as &#145;his ministry shone through the whole county of <i>Essex</i>&#146;  (Mather, 1.304). His audience included &#145;some of great quality among the rest&#146;, the most prominent being &#145;the truly noble Earl of <i>Warwick</i>&#146;  (ibid., 1.304&#150;5), a friend and protector of puritans, including, eventually, Hooker and his family. As Mather further notes, Hooker developed a reputation for special power in the &#145;Use&#146; or &#145;Application&#146; section of his sermons, the final, and often very long, section where the biblical exegesis and rational explanations of the text were &#145;brought home&#146; through practical admonitions to the congregation.<br>
<br>Hooker's great popularity among his listeners was based on this ability to speak the language of the people while conveying the high truths of scripture. Since his ministry in England and later in New England was always focused on encouraging his listeners to think positively and actively about realizing God's &#145;promise&#146; of salvation in their own lives, he stayed close to the experiences of their lives in the figures of speech that characterized his preaching. He preached in a plain style, eschewing the use of classical languages, in which he was fluent, enlivening his sermons instead with such dramatic tools as imagined dialogue, &#145;character&#146; sketches, and invitations to his listeners to imagine themselves in real-life situations to which he gave deep spiritual meaning. During his Chelmsford ministry (1625&#150;30) he preached the sermons called <span class="italic">The Poor Doubting Christian Drawn unto Christ</span>, published anonymously in 1629. The title indicates his desire to give encouragement to those inclined to see themselves as hopeless cases. His message was directed at the &#145;poor soul&#146; who &#145;mourns and cries to heaven for mercy, and prays against a stubborn hard heart; and he is weary of his life because his wild heart remains&#146;  (Williams and others, 185). Such listeners, in spite of human helplessness, were told they should &#145;expect power from Christ to pluck thee out of thyself&#146;  (ibid., 159). <span class="italic">The Poor Doubting Christian</span> was his most popular book, going through at least seventeen editions by 1700, including a Dutch translation.<h2>
<a name="Silencing"></a>Silencing</h2>At some point during his Chelmsford period, Hooker opened a school in his home, a farmhouse called Cuckoos, in Little Baddow. His assistant was John Eliot, later known as &#145;the Apostle to the Indians&#146;. Eliot reported that it was in this place that he experienced God's saving grace and that &#145;when I came to this blessed family, I then saw, and never before, the power of godliness, in its lively vigour, and efficacy&#146;  (Mather, 1.305). During these years of Hooker's Essex ministry, four more children were born, two of whom, Anne and Sarah, died in infancy while a second Sarah and John both survived to adulthood.<br>
<br>By 1629 Hooker's notoriety had attracted the full attention of the anti-puritan forces in Essex, including William Laud, bishop of London from 1628. Conformist ministers in the region wrote letters to the bishop warning that Hooker was acquiring great influence with the people, and in particular with the younger ministers, for whom he was &#145;an oracle, and their principal library&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1628&#150;9</i>, 554). A letter from Samuel Collins, vicar of Braintree, warned Laud that &#145;all men's eares are now filled with the obstreprous clamours of his [Hooker's] followers against my Lord [Laud] &hellip; as a man endeavouring to suppress good preaching and advance Popery&#146;  (Davids, 150). Hooker had become a flashpoint in the increasingly vehement puritan struggle against the strict enforcers of conformity in the forms of worship. So prominent was Hooker's voice, and so intently were East Anglians attuned to ecclesiastical matters, that Collins claimed the question of Hooker's continuance in the active ministry &#145;drowns the noise of the greate question of Tonnage and Poundage &hellip; I dare be bold to say that if he be once quietly gone, my Lord hath overcame the greatest difficulty in governing this parte of his diocese&#146;  (ibid., 152). In a June 1629 meeting with Laud, Hooker expressed a willingness to depart from the diocese so long as he was not called before the court of high commission. Late in 1629 petitions to Laud both for and against Hooker's ministry followed, with over forty clerical signatures on each. When in 1630 he was finally summoned to appear before the court, he elected to forfeit bond and go into hiding.<br>
<br>Despite his preference for a tone of hopeful encouragement in his preaching, one of Hooker's most powerful sermons was a rousing jeremiad. It was his farewell sermon in England, <span class="italic">The Danger of Desertion</span>, in which he warned his hearers that &#145;England hath seen her best days&#146;  (Williams and others, 245) and that &#145;As sure as God is God, God is going from England&#146;  (ibid., 244). His warning that &#145;God is packing up of his gospel, because none will buy his wares&#146;  (ibid., 246) carried visual immediacy in the market town of Chelmsford. His own imminent departure was implied as he further warned that:<blockquote>God begins to ship away his Noahs, which prophesied and foretold that destruction was near; and God makes account that New England shall be a refuge for his Noahs and his Lots, a rock and a shelter for his righteous ones to run unto. (ibid., 246)</blockquote>His accusations of guilt for this situation include both the simple half-hearted believers in his audience who have taken God's blessings too much for granted and the king himself, about whom:<blockquote>Some may say: &#145;Surely kings and monarchs are exempted, they need not fear that such torments will come upon them.&#146; But God will say, be he a king that rules or reigns, yet as he hath rejected God, so God will reject him. He is a King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. (ibid., 243)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="TheNetherlands"></a>The Netherlands</h2>Pursuivants actively sought Hooker until he escaped on a vessel to the Netherlands in June 1631. He expected a call to the English church in Amsterdam's Begijnhof, whose congregation had encouraged him to come. But the incumbent minister there, John Paget, put twenty questions to Hooker to test his opinions on church government, baptism, and separatism. Paget found him too strongly congregational in his opinions on church government, so Hooker moved on to Delft and became the assistant to the Scottish minister, John Forbes, in the Prinsenhof church, where he served until 1633. Early in that year he was briefly with William Ames, the puritan exiled from Cambridge in 1609 and subsequently professor and rector at Franeker, whose earlier work had helped form Hooker's theology and ecclesiology. Hooker wrote a lengthy &#145;Preface&#146; to Ames's <span class="italic">Fresh Suit Against Human Ceremonies</span> (1633) before covertly returning to England. In a 1633 letter to John Cotton dissuading him from coming to Holland, Hooker reported a low level of &#145;heart religion&#146; and &#145;the power of godliness&#146; there, adding that his own affliction with ague had helped to discourage him from remaining  (Williams and others, 297). On returning to England, he was reunited with his family, who had remained there on the earl of Warwick's estate during Hooker's exile. Together with Cotton, Samuel Stone, and their families, about 10 July 1633 the Hookers boarded the <i>Griffin</i> off the Downs, arriving in Boston in the Massachusetts Bay colony eight weeks later, on 4 September 1633.<h2>
<a name="MassachusettsBay"></a>Massachusetts Bay</h2>Hooker soon settled as pastor of a new church at Newtown (later called Cambridge) while Cotton became the teacher of the already established church at Boston and Stone became the teacher at Newtown. Some of Hooker's followers from Essex, led by his friend William Goodwin, had preceded him to Newtown in 1632 and were known there as &#145;Mr. Hooker's company&#146; before he arrived. Many of these same faithful again followed him just three years later when he moved to Connecticut.<br>
<br>About a year after arriving in New England, Hooker was reluctantly drawn into a controversy in Salem over the impetuous John Endecott's cutting a part of St George's cross from a military banner, on the grounds that it was an idolatrous icon. When his opinion was sought by the general court of the colony, Hooker expressed reluctance to disagree with his brethren, but nevertheless rendered a lengthy opinion, thirteen pages in manuscript, &#145;Touchinge the crosse in the banners&#146;, in which he argued that the cross in the flag was a civil use of the symbol, not a religious one, and therefore was not idolatrous. This view, despite dissent from some colonial leaders, ultimately carried the day. At about the time this issue was resolved, Hooker's friend John Haynes, a member of his congregation, was elected governor of the Massachusetts Bay colony, placing Hooker in a position to have considerable influence in colonial affairs if he chose. But in the next year, members of the Newtown church and community, dissatisfied with what they considered inadequate land for farming, sent an advance party 100 miles to the south-west to investigate the possibility of a move to the banks of the Connecticut River. In May 1636, just as Haynes was being replaced in the governorship by the newly arrived Henry Vane, the Newtown church, led by Hooker and Stone, decided to move to the site known by the native population as Suckiaug, but renamed Hartford by the English settlers in honour of Samuel Stone's English birthplace. The reasons for this removal have been much debated. The seventeenth-century historian William Hubbard believed that Hooker and Cotton needed more geographical distance between them because &#145;Nature doth not allow two suns in one firmament&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collections</span>, 6.306). Yet, although there were differences between them, including some of their views on the process of grace in the believer's soul and on admission to church membership, the reason Hooker gave for the move was economic&#151;too little good meadow and grazing land for cattle and too great constriction of Newtown residents between Watertown and Charlestown, both of which had been established and laid out before Newtown. This restriction in farmland and the consequent limitation on productivity, as the Newtowners said, made it difficult to pay their ministers adequately.<h2>
<a name="HartfordConnecticut"></a>Hartford, Connecticut</h2>The five-day journey to Hartford began on 31 May 1636. Hooker made occasional return visits to the Bay colony thereafter, but Hartford was his home for the rest of his life. His family at this time included five children, Samuel having been born in Newtown about 1633. The Hookers' eighth and last child, a son, had been born and died in Newtown in late 1634. Their mother, Susannah, was infirm at the time of the move and was transported to Connecticut on a litter, though she ultimately outlived her husband, dying on 17 May 1676. Hooker's ministry and his influence on civil affairs thrived at Hartford. He returned in August of 1637 to be co-moderator with Peter Bulkeley at the synod that took up the antinomian controversy then reaching full development. His reputation as both a disputant and a negotiator was well established by this time. He is known to have maintained a correspondence with both John Winthrop, governor of the Massachusetts Bay colony, and Roger Williams, the exiled radical living in Providence plantation, though fewer than a dozen of Hooker's letters have survived.<br>
<br>When representatives from the new Connecticut towns met to organize a colonial confederation in 1638, Hooker preached to them on the subject of government. Although some enthusiastic historians called him the first American democrat, this is far from accurate. As Perry Miller has shown, his understanding of the relationship between people and authority is based on the model of the church covenant that every New England church adopted. But Hooker reminded his audience that civil magistrates are selected by the people they govern and that these people can limit the power of their rulers. Connecticut's fundamental orders were more liberal than the Massachusetts laws, however, in not restricting the ability to hold public office to church members, though this requirement still held for the governor. The new laws confirmed the <i>status quo</i> of a colony already in existence for three years.<br>
<br>Their reputations in England led to the invitation from members of parliament to Hooker, Cotton, and John Davenport to represent New England's churches at the newly convened Westminster assembly in 1642. Hooker firmly declined, however, realizing that they would be among a small minority of Independent churchmen, vastly outnumbered by the predominantly presbyterian views of many of the reform-minded English and Scottish churchmen. He did, however, send for publication in England four works through which he probably intended to influence the assembly's work on a confession of faith and a catechism: <span class="italic">A Briefe Exposition of the Lords Prayer</span>, <span class="italic">An Exposition of the Principles of Religion</span> (published together), <span class="italic">The Immortality of Mans Soule</span>, and <span class="italic">The Saints Guide in Three Treatises</span>, all published in London in 1645. His strength in argument also made him a logical choice by his New England brethren to write a defence of the New England way of church organization in response to challenges from home in the mid-1640s. Specifically in answer to the Scottish presbyterian Samuel Rutherford's <span class="italic">Peaceable and Temperate Plea for Pauls Presbyterie</span> (1642) and <span class="italic">The Due Right of Presbyteries</span> (1644), he wrote <span class="italic">A Survey of the Summe of Church Discipline</span> and sent it over in an ill-fated vessel that sank without survivors. He rewrote the book, which was eventually published posthumously in 1648.<h2>
<a name="Preaching"></a>Preaching</h2>But the central work of Hooker's career, a series of sermons preached in Cambridge, Chelmsford, and Hartford, was his epic account of the psychological process of the sinner's inner journey to salvation. Anticipating John Bunyan's allegorical <span class="italic">The Pilgrim's Progress</span>, Hooker's masterful analysis of the motions of faith describes a journey from the first awareness of one's own captivity by sin beginning with the preparatory stages of contrition and humiliation, and extending through vocation, adoption, faith, justification, sanctification, and glorification. The sermons were first published from auditors' notes as <span class="italic">The Soules Preparation</span> (1632), <span class="italic">The Soules Humiliation</span> (1637), <span class="italic">The Soules Effectuall Calling</span> (1637), <span class="italic">The Soules Implantation</span> (1637), <span class="italic">The Soules Exaltation</span> (1638), and <span class="italic">The Soules Possession of Christ</span> (1638). Although not published from his own texts, these books often capture the dynamic force of his actual delivery. In New England, Hooker revised these sermons for publication as <span class="italic">The Application of Redemption, the First Eight Books</span> and <span class="italic">The Application of Redemption, Books Nine and Ten</span>, both of which were published posthumously in 1656, as was his treatise on glorification, the final stage in the soul's ascent to heaven, <span class="italic">A Comment upon Christs Last Prayer</span>. This is the fullest account of the sequence of spiritual stages in the life of the soul produced in Hooker's generation. In it, Hooker's capacity for capturing a strong sense of spiritual adventure, of the need for constant &#145;application&#146; to the challenge of subduing sin and &#145;labouring&#146; in the hope of receiving God's essential help in the task, is brilliantly evident.<br>
<br>Hooker's importance rests on these dramatic examples of his pulpit mastery. His fellow Connecticut minister, Henry Whitfield, captured an essential characteristic in Hooker's ministry in saying:<blockquote>
<i>That he had the best command of his own spirit, which he ever saw in any man whatever</i>. For though he were a Man of a Cholerick Disposition, and had a mighty vigour and fervour of spirit, which as occasion served, was wondrous useful unto him, yet he had ordinarily as much government of his choler, as a man has of a mastiff dog in a chain; he <i>could let out his dog, and pull in his dog, as he pleased</i>. (Mather, 1.313)</blockquote>Another contemporary simply said, &#145;He was a person who while doing his master's work, would put a king in his pocket&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Although no authentic likeness of Thomas Hooker exists, he is represented in a bronze statue created by Frances L. Wadsworth in downtown Hartford, the city where he died of an epidemic sickness on 7 July 1647 and was buried in the Central Church burying-ground.<br>
