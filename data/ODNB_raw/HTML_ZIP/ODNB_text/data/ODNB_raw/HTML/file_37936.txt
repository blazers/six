<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Saunders,  Edith Rebecca</span>  (1865&#150;1945), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born in Brighton on 14 October 1865, one of at least two children of John Saunders, hotel keeper, and his wife, Jane Rebecca Whitwell of Islington. Orphaned at an early age, she and her brother were brought up by an aunt, who gave them a secure and comfortable home. She was educated at Handsworth Ladies' College and at Newnham College, Cambridge, where she took both parts of the natural sciences tripos (1887, 1888), obtaining first-class honours. She held a Bathurst studentship from 1888 to 1889. She was an alpine climber as a young woman, and throughout her life an excellent skater. In 1889 she was appointed demonstrator in botany at Newnham College, and along with her colleague Marion Greenwood she organized the Balfour Laboratory, of which she became director in 1899. For more than twenty years she taught most of the practicals in the natural sciences for the women students of Newnham and Girton colleges. She was recognized as a stimulating teacher who demanded high-quality work.<br>
<br>Saunders's research was in two areas, plant genetics and floral morphology. Early in her career she undertook collaborative research with William Bateson on plant breeding experiments on <i>Biscutella laevigata</i>. The work involved a study of what came to be known as dominant and recessive characters; the results were published in 1898 and 1902. The rediscovery in 1900 of Gregor Mendel's work gave a special impetus to these investigations; by 1902 Saunders and Bateson had established the existence of Mendelian inheritance in <i>Lychnis</i>, <i>Atropa</i>, and <i>Datura</i>, and it is likely that they had rediscovered some of Mendel's laws before his work was known to them.<br>
<br>From about 1902 Edith Saunders and Bateson were the leading members of the team which started the modern study of plant genetics in Britain; indeed, she has been called the mother of British plant genetics. Her later research in this area involved a study of the complex genetic interactions in <i>Matthiola incana</i>, on which she published twenty-two papers. Her selection as president of section K (botany) of the British Association in 1920 reflected her prominent position in the field.<br>
<br>By the 1920s, stimulated largely by observations on plant structure made during her genetics work, Edith Saunders was turning increasingly to problems in floral morphology: in a long series of papers in the <span class="italic">Annals of Botany</span> and the <span class="italic">New Phytologist</span> she recorded her observations on vascular and carpellary structure in a wide range of flowers. Her results and theories were summarized in her two-volume work <span class="italic">Floral Morphology</span> (1937&#150;9). The overall impact of her morphological work was to some extent diminished by the fact that she held to her theory of carpel polymorphism, despite the overwhelming criticism levelled against it. Nevertheless, her contribution to floral anatomy is regarded as important and her papers were frequently cited many years after her death.<br>
<br>Edith Saunders enjoyed travelling, and went with the British Association to Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, China, Japan, and North America. She was one of the first women to be elected to the fellowship of the Linnean Society (1905). She later served on its council (1910&#150;15), and was vice-president from 1912 to 1913. She was president of the Genetical Society in 1936. The Royal Horticultural Society awarded her the Banksian medal in 1906.<br>
<br>Edith Saunders was a well-known and highly respected figure in Cambridge for many decades. With the outbreak of the Second World War she gave up her research and worked in the Cambridge offices of the YMCA and WVS, and also in Addenbrooke's Hospital Library (1940&#150;43). In addition she was honorary treasurer of the WVS Services Club from 1941 to 1945. She was in the process of resuming her scientific work when she died, unmarried, on 6 June 1945 in Cambridge, following a bicycle accident. Her passing, at the time of the end of the war in Europe, received comparatively little notice for a person of her scientific stature.<br>
