<span class="headword">Arnott,  George Arnott Walker</span>  (1799&#150;1868), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born at Edinburgh on 6 February 1799, the son of David Walker Arnott. He spent his early years at Edenshead and Arlary, on the borders of Fife and Kinross. In 1807 he went to Edinburgh high school, then entered the university in 1813. He took his AM degree in 1818, and while still a teenager published learned articles on mathematics. He studied for the law and was admitted to the faculty of advocates in 1821, but found the profession uninteresting and soon abandoned it. He turned his attention to botany, and in 1821 went to France, where he worked in the Paris herbaria, and published two influential papers on mosses. Before the age of thirty, he was famous for his work on cryptogams, for which he was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1825. In 1828 the genus <i>Arnottia</i> was named after him by Achille Richard. He visited Spain and Russia in 1828&#150;9, and, on his return to Scotland, married in 1831 Miss Mary Hay Barclay, of Paris, Perthshire.<br>
<br>From 1830 to 1840 Arnott worked with Sir William Jackson Hooker on a study of the plants collected in Captain Beechey's voyage to the Pacific and the Bering Strait, published in 1841. During these ten years his reputation was established as a meticulous taxonomist, and he began the vast international correspondence which at his death would fill over twenty volumes and boxes. His descriptions of new plants from South America, India, and Senegambia were published in various periodicals, and he co-operated with Robert Wight in his <span class="italic">Illustrations of Indian Botany</span>, and especially in the notable <span class="italic">Prodromus florae peninsulae Indiae orientalis</span> (1834). In 1837 the University of Aberdeen awarded him its LLD. In 1839 he temporarily took Hooker's place as botanical lecturer at Glasgow, and in 1845 was elected regius professor of botany in that university.<br>
<br>Arnott left Arlary in 1846, and took up his residence in Glasgow. In 1850 he collaborated with Hooker on the sixth edition of <span class="italic">British Flora</span>. About this time he took up the study of diatoms, of which he formed a large and valuable collection which was later housed in the Natuurwettenschaplijk Museum, Antwerp. He was an enthusiast of curling and an adherent of freemasonry, rising to the rank of deputy grand master of the Scottish order. In 1868 his health gave way and his university work had to be abandoned. Jaundice set in, and he died on 17 June 1868, and was buried three days later in the Sighthill cemetery, Glasgow. He left three sons and five daughters.<br>
