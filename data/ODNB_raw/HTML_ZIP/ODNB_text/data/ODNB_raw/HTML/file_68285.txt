<span class="headword">Johnson,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1574), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, is not always easy to distinguish from Robert Johnson (1540/41&#150;1625), founder of Oakham and Uppingham schools, who in spite of an impressive portfolio of livings held in plurality shared the puritan credentials of this Robert Johnson. The latter is not known to have had any university career, and at his trial in February 1574 he was described as &#145;unlearned&#146;. All the little that is known of Johnson relates to the last two years of his life. In 1572 he was one of those who visited in prison the authors of the <span class="italic">Admonition to the Parliament</span>, John Field and Thomas Wilcox, when he was identified as &#145;Mr Johnson dwelling in Middlesex near to Mr Gresham&#146;  (Petyt MS 538/47, fol. 481). He seems to have been a preacher at St Clement Danes when in 1573 he was put on trial at Middlesex assizes for baptizing without using the sign of the cross and marrying without the ring. On 21 December 1573 Wilcox reported to Anthony Gilby that Johnson was &#145;laid in the Gatehouse at Westminster&#146; and &#145;others with him&#146;  (CUL, MS Mm.1.43, p. 441).<br>
<br>Several documents relating to what followed were printed in 1593 in <span class="italic">A Parte of a Register</span>. These may (or may not) compound the problem of identity, since they are given the running headline: &#145;The articles, letters, and examina. of Mai. Ro. Jonson, of late Preacher at Northampton&#146;. Moreover, the first of these documents consists of Johnson's answer to articles objected against him by the bishop of Lincoln, containing references to &#145;us in Saint Martines&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Parte of a Register</span>, 95) and to an alleged threat of the bishop to come to Leicester to preach against him. This may concern the other Robert Johnson, although Northampton is not in the diocese of Lincoln, and neither Johnson is known to have been beneficed at St Martin's Leicester.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">A Parte of a Register</span> prints Johnson's own account of his trial in Westminster Hall, which he says took place seven weeks after his imprisonment, on 20 February 1574. Here may be more confusion, since the trial is said to have been conducted before the ecclesiastical commissioners, yet a jury is also mentioned as being empanelled and charged. Johnson was again indicted for neglect of the sign of the cross in baptism and the ring in marriage, but most time was spent on a third, almost technical, offence: failure to repeat the words of consecration when fresh supplies of wine were called for at communion. Johnson was a dextrous barrack-room lawyer, and both Bishop Edwin Sandys of London&#151;whom Johnson accused of being &#145;the chief of my trouble&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Parte of a Register</span>, 118)&#151;and the lord chief justice remarked on his stubborn and arrogant nature. Johnson was sentenced to a year's imprisonment, but died in the Westminster Gatehouse no later than April 1574.<br>
<br>Johnson wrote prison letters to Sandys&#151;&#145;superintendent of popish corruptions in the diocese of London&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Parte of a Register</span>, 101)&#151;and Gabriel Goodman, dean of Westminster, in which he exercised a sharply satirical tongue. Commenting on Goodman's Lenten and Easter sermons as essentially popish, he asked &#145;as for Schism, who is a greater schismatic than you? &hellip; And as for Puritanism, who is a greater Puritan than you?&#146;  (ibid., 115). Johnson's pointed wit may support the unprovable theory that he was the father of &#145;Ben Jonson of Westminster&#146; [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15116/', "Jonson, Benjamin (1572&#150;1637)")</script>], who is known to have been the son of a minister, born posthumously and quite possibly in 1574.<br>
