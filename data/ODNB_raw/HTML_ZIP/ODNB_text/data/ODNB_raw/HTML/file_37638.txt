<span class="headword">Kitson,  James</span>  (1807&#150;1885), <span class="occ">ironmaster and locomotive builder</span>, was born in Leeds on 27 October 1807, the eldest of six children of a licensed victualler and his wife. He may be the James Kitson who was baptized in Leeds on 3 January 1808, the son of William Kitson. He was educated at local schools and at the Leeds Mechanics' Institution and Literary Society, where he was a diligent student in drawing and mathematics. On 20 September 1828 he married Ann, daughter of John Newton, owner of a painting and decorating firm. They had four sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Encouraged by his studies of <span class="italic">A Practical Treatise on Rail-Roads</span>, by Nicholas Wood, Kitson quickly realized the great potential future of steam locomotive traction and in 1837 he joined Charles Todd, who had been apprenticed to James Fenton of the locomotive builders Fenton, Murray, and Jackson, and David Laird, a farmer and financier, in establishing Todd, Kitson, and Laird at the Railway foundry in Leeds, manufacturers of machinery and locomotives.<br>
<br>In 1838 six locomotives were built for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. In 1839 Kitson and Laird withdrew from this partnership and established the Airedale foundry, also in Leeds, whose first locomotives were built for the North Midland Railway in 1840. David Laird withdrew in 1842 and the firm was reconstituted as Kitson, Thompson, and Hewitson. Large numbers of locomotives were built for home and overseas railways. Among these was the 0&#150;6&#150;0 type (1849) with inside cylinders and frames, for the Leeds and Thirsk Railway, a design which established the standard for freight locomotives in Britain over many decades. The first export locomotives (for the Orl&eacute;ans&#150;Bordeaux railway) were built in 1846, followed by those for the Kiel&#150;Altona line in 1848, and many more for India, Australia, South Africa, South America, and elsewhere.<br>
<br>Kitson's great organizing ability, technical ingenuity, and grasp of industrial developments formed the mainspring of these activities. In 1854 he felt it desirable to acquire a source of good Yorkshire iron for the Airedale foundry and established the Monk Bridge ironworks nearby, which was managed by his sons Frederick William and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34343/', "James Kitson (later first Baron Airedale)")</script>, the former having previously been principal locomotive designer at Airedale. After the retirement of Isaac Thompson in 1858 and the death of William Hewitson in 1863 the Kitson family took complete control of the firm, and later James Kitson, junior, and the third son, John Hawthorn, who managed the Airedale foundry from 1863, became partners with their father.<br>
<br>Kitson's first wife died and on 24 January 1868 he married Elizabeth, daughter of the Revd John E. Scroope Hutchinson, vicar of East Stoke, Nottinghamshire. They had two sons and two daughters. Kitson retired from the business in 1876, but was a man of wide interests and many activities outside his industrial work. Very musical and with a fine voice, in his youth he had built an organ in an outhouse of his father's premises. Later he became chairman of the orchestral committee for the Leeds music festival. He was also chairman of the Leeds Northern Railway and later a director of the North Eastern Railway. He was vice-chairman and later chairman of the Yorkshire Banking Company. An alderman of Leeds in 1858&#150;68, he was mayor in 1860&#150;61, as well as being a magistrate for Leeds borough and for the West Riding of Yorkshire. Kitson died at Elmet Hall, Roundhay, Leeds, on 30 June 1885.<br>
