<span class="headword">Ralegh,  Walter</span>  (1586&#150;1646), <span class="occ">dean of Wells</span>, was the second son of Sir Walter Ralegh's elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23037/', "Sir Carew Ralegh (c.1550&#150;1625/6)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23039/', "Ralegh, Sir Walter (1554&#150;1618)")</script>] of Downton, Wiltshire, and his wife, Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1616), widow of Sir John Thynne of Longleat, Wiltshire, and daughter of Sir William Wroughton of Broad Hinton, Wiltshire. He was born at Downton and educated at Winchester College and at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he matriculated as commoner on 5 November 1602. He graduated BA in 1605 and MA in 1608. &#145;He was admired for his disputations in the schools, even when he was an undergraduate&#146;  (Patrick).<br>
<br>Ralegh took holy orders, and in 1618 became chaplain to William Herbert, third earl of Pembroke. In 1621 he was presented by his patron to the rectory of Chedzoy, near Bridgwater, Somerset, and in the following year received the rectory of Wilton St Mary, Wiltshire. Between 1620 and 1623 he married Maria, daughter of Sir Ralph Gibbs of Honington, Warwickshire. About 1630 he was chosen a chaplain-in-ordinary to Charles I, who admired his preaching. In 1632 he was made rector of Elingdon, otherwise Wroughton, Wiltshire, and in 1635 of Street-cum-Walton, Somerset. In 1634 he was minor prebendary of Combe in Wells Cathedral, and in 1636 he was created DD. The next year he became rector of St Buryan, Cornwall, and in 1641 succeeded George Warburton as dean of Wells.<br>
<br>Before the civil war Ralegh was one of the circle associated with Lucius Cary, second Viscount Falkland, at Great Tew; among his friends were Henry Hammond, William Chillingworth, and Edward Hyde, earl of Clarendon. While he was attending the king during the civil war his rectory at Chedzoy was plundered by the parliamentarians, his property stolen, and his cattle driven away. His wife and children took refuge at Downton, where Ralegh joined them. After the royalist victories in 1643 Ralegh was able to return to Chedzoy and to live there in safety until the defeat of George Goring, Lord Goring, at Langport in 1645. Ralegh was reported to have been captured at Bridgwater on the fall of that town (21 July 1645), though another report says that he was taken when Raglan Castle surrendered in August 1646. He was placed under house arrest at Chedzoy and subsequently removed, first to the county gaol at Ilchester, then to the county committee's prison at Banwell, and eventually to his own deanery at Wells. His gaoler was David Barrett, a Baptist shoemaker who was marshal to the Somerset county committee. In the late summer of 1646 Ralegh was mortally wounded in a scuffle with Barrett and died, at his deanery, six weeks later. According to Simon Patrick the incident occurred when Ralegh tried to stop Barrett when he attempted to inspect a letter that Ralegh had written to his wife (cf. Walker, <span class="italic">Sufferings of the Clergy</span>, which, however, contains several inaccuracies, and Ryves, <span class="italic">Mercurius Rusticus</span>, 1647). Ralegh died on 10 October 1646, and was buried in the choir of Wells Cathedral, before the dean's stall.<br>
<br>Ralegh's papers were preserved in the family, and thirteen of his sermons were given by his widow to Simon Patrick (1626&#150;1707), then dean of Peterborough, who published them in 1679, with a biographical notice and a Latin poem written in praise of Ralegh by a Cambridge admirer, probably Patrick himself. The volume is entitled <span class="italic">Reliquiae Raleighanae, being discourses and sermons on several subjects, by the Reverend Dr. Walter Raleigh</span>. The sermons, all apparently dating from before the outbreak of the civil war, show that Ralegh was moderate in his churchmanship, able to criticize both Calvinist and Arminian extremes, though usually in restrained language: &#145;the truth&#146;, he declared, &#145;lies between both&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Raleighanae</span>, 156). A sermon, &#145;The original of wars&#146;, evidently preached at the time of the bishops' wars, is more emphatic in its denunciations of puritans as a &#145;viperous brood of error and contention&#146;  (ibid., 142) motivated by greed for the church's wealth, although in it Ralegh also attacks swaggering cavaliers as &#145;Ruffians and Rodotomantos, Brethren of the Sword that read Tavern Lectures&#146;  (ibid., 133). In 1719 Laurence Howell published <span class="italic">Certain Queries Proposed by Roman Catholicks, and Answered by Dr. Walter Raleigh</span>, with an account of Ralegh copied from Patrick. Of a tract on the millennium which Ralegh is said to have written, no trace remains.<br>
