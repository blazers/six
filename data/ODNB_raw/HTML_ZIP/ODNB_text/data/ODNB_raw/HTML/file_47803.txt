<span class="headword">Aves,  Ernest Harry</span>  (1857&#150;1917), <span class="occ">social investigator and civil servant</span>, was born on 30 August 1857 at Cleveland Villa, Station Road, Cambridge, the son of William Owen Aves, tailor and woollen draper, and his wife, Mary Ann Coales. He was educated in Cambridge at Llandaff House by a Mr Johnson and matriculated sizar at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1880. He graduated BA in 1884, having been placed in the first class of the moral sciences tripos, and proceeded MA in 1887. On 18 June 1887 he was admitted to the Inner Temple but, as an early resident of Toynbee Hall (1887&#150;97), his attentions were diverted to the university settlement movement. From 1889 to 1907 he was secretary of the Universities' Settlements' Association and he served as sub-warden of Toynbee from 1890 to 1897. He was affectionately known as Father Aves or Pater by the members. Henrietta Barnett described him as &#145;tall, loosely put together, somewhat slouching in his gait, preternaturally grave, fond of propounding fundamental enquiries and anxious for exact truth from the inwardest parts&#146;  (Barnett, 63). He was immediately set to work by Canon Barnett collecting information about the people of St Jude's parish. It was a type of work which Aves expanded for Charles Booth between 1888 and 1903. He developed the great skill as an interviewer and observer which is only partially revealed in his contributions to Booth's <span class="italic">Life and Labour of the People in London</span> (1891&#150;1903) but to which justice is done in his unpublished reports in the Booth archive. His contribution to the final volume of the <span class="italic">Industry</span> series (5 vols.) and to the &#145;Star&#146; volume was especially notable, and sales of the final volume outstripped those for the rest of the series. He developed a close friendship and working partnership with Charles and Mary Booth which outlived the survey. He supported the extension of democratic association among producers and consumers, welcoming the new unionism, siding with the dockers in the strike of 1889, and becoming the first president of the Trafalgar branch of the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union.<br>
<br>On 28 July 1897 Aves married Eva Mary Maitland and moved out of Toynbee Hall. The couple had two daughters: Geraldine Maitland [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39870/', "Aves, Dame Geraldine Maitland")</script>] was born on 22 August 1898 and Florence was born in July 1903. The family lived in a farmhouse in Witley and in Hampstead, where the girls attended Frognal School. While preserving his interest in Toynbee, and continuing to work for Booth on the <span class="roman">Religious Influences</span> series, Aves built up a career in public service. He was appointed special commissioner on wage boards and compulsory arbitration in Australia and New Zealand in 1907&#150;8. He joined the labour department of the Board of Trade as a statistical investigator in 1907, as an expert on the casual labour market and its conditions, and his report on the sweated trades was considered influential in achieving regulatory legislation for these industries. As chief administrator of the <span class="roman">Trade Boards Act</span> (while chairman of the British and Irish trade boards, from 1912 to 1917) he extended the legislation to include fresh trades so that by 1917 there were eight English trade boards and five Irish. The &#145;Labour notes&#146; which he regularly contributed to the <span class="italic">Economic Journal</span>, articles on wages and hours of labour in the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, and his book <span class="italic">Co-Operative Industry</span> (1907) provide statements of his progressive ideas.<br>
<br>In his private life Aves was reported to have a fine sense of humour. In his bachelor days he was an enthusiastic mountaineer: he was elected to the Toynbee Alpine Club in December 1893 and engaged in several bold ascents. With his marriage in 1897 he became very much the family man, and a Toynbee friend recalled him teaching his young daughter rock-climbing near Tenby. He was indeed, by all accounts, a devoted husband and father, who painstakingly invented &#145;marvellous puzzle-letter cards, exactly suited to the capacity of each child&#146; from divers parts of the globe. He was an avid photographer. He planned to return to rock-climbing among the glaciers in August 1914 but the war intervened. He received the news of Booth's death with sadness. Aves died, after a short illness, at Stoatby Rough, Thursley, Haslemere, Surrey, on 19 April 1917, leaving his widow and two daughters. His elder daughter, Dame Geraldine Aves, after graduating from Newnham College, Cambridge, followed her father into the civil service and became prominent in work with the social services, particularly regarding education and the care of the young and aged. Scholars have speculated about Ernest Aves's religious position; his daughter was a lifelong devout Anglican and was a member of the London diocesan synod and bishop's council from 1971 to 1979.<br>
