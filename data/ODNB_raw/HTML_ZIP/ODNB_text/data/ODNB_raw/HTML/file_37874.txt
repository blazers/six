<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Quelch,  Henry <span class="st"> [Harry]</span></span>  (1858&#150;1913), <span class="occ">socialist and journalist</span>, was born at Park Street, Hungerford, Berkshire, on 30 January 1858, son of James Quelch, a village blacksmith, who was an invalid for the last twenty years of his life, and his wife, Mary Ann Wooldridge, the daughter of an agricultural labourer. He had at least one brother, Lorenzo. The family was poor and the young Quelch began full-time work at the age of ten, migrating to London when he was fourteen. On 19 May 1878 he married Sarah (<i>b</i>. 1856/7), daughter of Thomas Fisher, a labourer. In 1881 they were living in Bermondsey with their two daughters. He had a variety of unskilled jobs, and at the beginning of the 1880s, when he first became involved in radical politics, he was working in a wallpaper warehouse.<br>
<br>Always known as Harry, Quelch first joined the Bermondsey Radical Club and soon became known in London left-wing politics. He became a member of the Democratic Federation, later the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), and was one of its few proletarian activists in the early days of the newly emerging socialist movement. Quelch was entirely self-educated: one of the great autodidacts of the modern labour period. He taught himself French in order to read Karl Marx's <span class="italic">Capital</span>, and later learned German. He began writing for <span class="italic">Justice</span>, the weekly paper of the SDF which first appeared in January 1884, and two years later he took over the editor's position from H. M. Hyndman. Quelch resigned from the editorship in 1889 in order to work full-time for the new unionism, but he returned to the editor's chair in 1891 and remained editor until his death. In 1891 he also became manager of the newly established Twentieth Century Press. He was a competent and careful administrator, and retired in 1909, with unfortunate results for the publishing company for the next few years.<br>
<br>Quelch produced in <span class="italic">Justice</span> a lively and well-informed paper which remains invaluable for the history, especially the grass roots history, of the modern labour movement. In politics he was usually to the left of H. M. Hyndman, whom he much admired, but he accepted the latter's scepticism towards trade unionism and its place in the socialist movement. Quelch was inevitably involved in most of the many disputes and debates of the decades before 1914, and not only in Britain, for he was a constant attender at international conferences of the European left. He was a vigorous opponent of the &#145;impossibilities&#146; in Scotland and London, anti-syndicalist in general, hostile to the Pankhursts, and only lukewarm on women's suffrage. He was a wholehearted supporter of Indian independence, and gave unstinted assistance to the Russian revolutionaries. When <span class="italic">Iskra</span> had to be printed in London, Quelch put all the resources of the Twentieth Century Press at the disposal of the Russians, who for a time included Lenin. On the issue of Germany in the years before 1914 Quelch was not as xenophobic as Hyndman, but he supported the idea of a &#145;citizen&#146; army and an &#145;adequate&#146; navy to counter German expansionist aims. It was an issue that sharply divided the Marxist left.<br>
<br>Quelch married twice. There was one son, Tom, but it is unknown whether Quelch's first or second wife was his mother. Henry Quelch died on 17 September 1913 at his home, 35 Limesford Road, Peckham, London, having been in increasing ill health for a number of years. He was survived by his second wife, M. C. E. Quelch.<br>
