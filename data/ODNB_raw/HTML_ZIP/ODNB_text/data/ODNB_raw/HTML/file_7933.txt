<span class="headword">Douglas,  William</span>, seventh earl of Morton  (1582&#150;1648), <span class="occ">politician and nobleman</span>, was the son of Robert Douglas of Lochleven (<i>d</i>. 1585) and Jean Lyon (<i>d</i>. 1608&times;10), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17278/', "John Lyon, eighth Lord Glamis (c.1544&#150;1578)")</script>. Following his father's death in March 1585 his mother married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7868/', "Archibald Douglas, eighth earl of Angus (c.1555&#150;1588)")</script>, and then, before 31 May 1590, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16679/', "Alexander Lindsay, first Lord Spynie (c.1563&#150;1607)")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16681/', "Alexander Lindsay, second Lord Spynie (c.1597&#150;1646)")</script>, was thus his half-brother. Little is known of Douglas's early life, although he seems to have had a good education. On 5 March 1604 he was contracted to marry Lady Anne Keith (<i>d</i>. 1649), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15263/', "George Keith, fourth Earl Marischal (1549/50&#150;1623)")</script>, and in June 1605 was served heir to his father.<br>
<br>Douglas and his grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7930/', "William Douglas, sixth earl of Morton (c.1540&#150;1606)")</script>, waged a jurisdictional feud against the Maxwells, who had held the earldom of Morton after 1581. Both sides were discharged from holding justiciary courts in Eskdale on the western border, and on 3 September 1606 were forbidden any armed convocations in the middle shires, Edinburgh, or Fife. On 4 November, still in his early twenties, Douglas succeeded his grandfather, becoming seventh (sometimes rendered eighth) earl, and began his political career by attempting to mitigate this longstanding civil conflict. On 14 July 1607 the privy council accused John Maxwell, ninth Lord Maxwell, of holding courts in Eskdale, a charge that he ably deflected on a legal technicality; at this stage his feud with Morton had reached such a pitch that both parties were forbidden from sitting in parliament that month, sent home, and made to find caution of &pound;10,000 each. Ignoring this order, on 3 August Maxwell dispatched a cartel with messages to intimidate Morton, whose own political loyalty was assured through the oath of allegiance, and his subsequent sitting at the convention of estates on 20 May 1608. In November 1610 Morton was appointed to the new Scottish peace commission for Peeblesshire, Edinburgh, Fife, and Kinross, an indication of his status and general reliability, which resulted in further appointments as a JP between 1613 and 1615. A landowner with extensive property Morton also partook of taxations worth over &pound;800 derived from Melrose Abbey and, having resigned the barony of Dunfedling to the king in March 1613, he received a charter of Segy barony on 9 October 1616.<br>
<br>On 16 January 1617 Morton received a special licence to travel in France, Germany, or Italy for up to three years &#145;without skaith to his person, lands, and goods, provided he behave as a loyal subject&#146; (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 1st ser., 9.10; NL Scot., MS 73, no. 83). He did not leave immediately, probably because he had to attend King James VI; he appeared at the convention of estates in March 1617 and from 11 to 14 June entertained the king at Dalkeith Palace. His continental tour began shortly afterwards, and in July he joined his cousin, William Douglas, eleventh earl of Angus, and Henry Erskine at Bourges. By spring 1618 they were in Paris, where Morton feared that he had contracted a fatal disease. He had returned to Scotland by 1621, if not before: on 13 September 1620 he was appointed a JP for Edinburgh. Morton attended parliament at Edinburgh on 25 July 1621, and by November had been officially admitted as a Scottish privy councillor and a member of a select conciliar cabinet to undertake the king's &#145;most weyghtie affairis&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 1st ser., 12.604). The following year he cemented an alliance with the new lord chancellor, Sir George Hay, by marrying his eldest daughter, Ann, on 7 September to Hay's heir, George Hay (<i>d</i>. 1644), later second earl of Kinnoull. In 1623 he attended an exhausting number of conciliar committees, discussing the exclusive export of undraped wool into England, serving on the commission of grievances, and presiding over the commission of manufactures. His political focus changed dramatically in January 1624, when he was appointed to the prince's council&#151;the first step in his career as a court-based statesman. Thereafter he spent much of his time at Whitehall and was present during the changeover of administration following the death of James, whose funeral Morton attended as standard-bearer with the second earl of Mar.<br>
<br>By November 1625 Morton had returned to Scotland to attend the convention of estates, and on 6 December he received a charter of the baronies of Aberdalgy, Dupplin, and Gask. After being reappointed to the Scottish privy council in March 1626 he was soon assigned to the commission of the exchequer and later, in February 1627, to the controversial commission of surrenders and teinds. It was during this period that Morton made two more strategic marriages, between his teenage daughter Margaret and Archibald Campbell, Lord Lorne, in August 1626, and between his eldest son, Robert, and Buckingham's niece Anne Villiers in April 1627. The latter secured Morton's place in the British court and formed the backdrop to his command of between 2000 and 3000 Scottish troops in the expedition to La Rochelle that August. By 12 April 1630 he had replaced the ageing Mar as lord high treasurer of Scotland, inheriting &#145;an empty cupboard&#146; and facing the prospect of a new taxation  (Lee, 31, 87). His record as treasurer was unexceptional but did coincide with the king's first return visit to Scotland in June 1633, for which Morton had been appointed to a seven member preparatory committee in the previous January. By June 1634 the earl's accounts as treasurer were audited by John Maitland, first earl of Lauderdale, and David Carnegie, first earl of Southesk, the first indication that Morton was about to be shuffled out of office. However, this shift permitted him to concentrate on his active court life: on 21 April he was promoted to the Order of the Garter and in 1635 he was appointed captain of the yeomen of the guard. He willingly stepped down as treasurer on 24 June 1636, but only on the king's personal assurance of protection against his creditors and the repayment of his substantial debts; Charles had earlier written to the Edinburgh financier William Dick, asking him to forgive Morton's loan of &pound;5000.<br>
<br>Morton was at court during the signing of the national covenant in 1638, and he was awarded a charter incorporating all of his lands into the earldom of Morton and Aberdour. He was sent home to make preparations for James Hamilton, marquess of Hamilton, who had insisted that a royal faction be established at Edinburgh before he himself set out as lord high commissioner. Morton witnessed the king's proclamation at the Scottish camp in Duns Law on 22 June 1639, but as the conflict between the king and the covenanting movement intensified Morton found himself losing control of the properties he had used as pledges during the 1620s and 1630s. In September 1640 he attended the assembly of peers with the earls of Traquair and Lanark, later helping to draw up the treaty of Ripon in the following month. Morton personally accompanied the king to Edinburgh in 1641, and on 18 August was himself obliged to sign the covenant before sitting in parliament. In September he tactfully declined the king's offer of the chancellorship in light of the loud protestations as to his unsuitability by his son-in-law Argyll.<br>
<br>In March 1642 Morton attended the king at York as a member of the council of peers, returning temporarily to his palace of Dalkeith, which he was obliged to sell on 14 July to mitigate his debts. He accepted a charter of the regalities of Orkney and Shetland from the king, who had the option of redeeming them for &pound;30,000, but immediately afterwards the Scottish commissioners passed an act to apprehend Morton and other &#145;incendiaries between the two kingdoms&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>). He eluded capture and apart from his sporadic participation in the civil wars (including attendance on Charles at Newcastle in 1646), Morton used Kirkwall as his base and served as commissioner of justiciary for Shetland and Orkney. His last major act was to sign an obligation to pay Michael Shaw of Kirkwall &pound;2000 Scots on 1 May 1648. As the political conflict in England reopened that year Morton sheltered his son-in-law Kinnoull, who had recently evaded the parliamentarian sea blockade in a vain attempt to spur support for a royalist land campaign. The earl himself died on 7 August 1648 at Kirkwall Castle, where he was also buried; his remarkable wife, Anne, who had long attempted to manage his estates during his prolonged absences, died a few months later on 30 May 1649. Their eldest son, Robert, succeeded to the earldom of Morton, but himself died at Kirkwall on 12 November 1649, leaving as his heir his son William (<i>d</i>. 1681).<br>
