<span class="headword">Denton,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1605, <em>d.</em> 1691), <span class="occ">physician</span>, born at Stowe, Buckinghamshire, and baptized at Hillesden on 14 April 1605, was the youngest son of Sir Thomas Denton (<i>d</i>. 1633), a lawyer and landowner, and his wife, Susan Temple (<i>d</i>. 1641). He matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, in 1621, graduating BA (1624) and MA (1627). The Denton men had traditionally been lawyers, but William took up medicine, studying with Henry Ashworth in Oxford and taking his DM on 10 October 1634. In April 1636 he was appointed court physician to Charles I, and in 1639 was with the king and the army during the Scots war. The Dentons' large families over several generations brought William a wide range of kinship connections in the south midlands and in London. He fostered these from his house in Covent Garden, where he lived and entertained for much of his life. His reputation for wit and polite conversation at court, particularly among the ladies, brought him the nickname of &#145;speaker of the Parliament of Women&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Genealogist</span>, 47). This and his position at court made him privy to a wide range of information, some of it sensitive. He married three times, but little is known of his first two wives, except that the second may have been Lady Muschamp of Yorkshire. His third wife, whom he married during the 1630s, was Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1675), daughter of Bostock Fuller of Tandridge Court, Surrey; they had one daughter, Anne (<i>b</i>. 1640). She married George Nicholas, son of the king's secretary, Sir Edward Nicholas, in 1664.<br>
<br>Denton attended the king throughout the civil war, but was quickly able to make his peace with parliament, compounding in December 1646 for &pound;55. During the interregnum he practised in London and the surgeon Richard Wiseman often and respectfully mentioned his professional skills. At the Restoration, Sir Edward Nicholas and the earl of Ormond worked to restore him to the position of royal physician, which he duly achieved on 24 January 1661. He was elected an honorary fellow of the College of Physicians in 1664, and was at one point mentioned as a physician to the duke of York.<br>
<br>Although William Denton was a respected physician with a large and diverse practice, his busy life covered a much wider range of activities. The trials and tribulations of his extended family meant that he spent much time sorting out their business affairs. He was close to his nephew Sir Ralph Verney (less than eight years younger than himself) and was devoted to Verney's wife, Mary. He corresponded with Verney more than once a week except when they were together in London or Buckinghamshire; the letters span more than fifty years, and are a great record of seventeenth-century male friendship. Denton played a vital part in securing the Verney estates while Sir Ralph was in self-imposed exile from 1643 to 1653, acted as foster parent to the Verney children when they were alone in England, and managed much of Verney's business. Like Verney he found himself assisting his own wider family affairs after his eldest brother, Sir Alexander Denton, died in prison in 1644 and his sister-in-law died the year after. Denton's role as trustee for the estates involved him in finding husbands for his nieces, and places for his nephews, all of which took up much of his time. With the early death of the young head of the next generation in 1658, many of the same problems ensued.<br>
<br>These activities nevertheless left the energetic Denton time for wide reading especially in history, philosophy, and current affairs. The lists of books he sent the exiled Sir Ralph Verney in France give some indication of the range. After the Restoration, Denton wrote five treatises between 1664 and 1690. These reflected the Erastian and anti-papist protestant views he held as a member of the Church of England, and drew on a wide range of primarily historical material. He also published a translation of an Italian work of Pietro Sarpi, <span class="italic">A Treatise of Matters Beneficiary</span> (1680), which he dedicated to Charles II. His final works, published in 1689 and 1690, wholeheartedly supported the revolution of 1688 and religious toleration. He passed his love of languages and learning on to his daughter Anne, whom Denton considered very like him, and whose godfather, Sir Ralph Verney, teased her as a bluestocking.<br>
<br>Denton's wide range of interests was often practical as well as intellectual. He learned much of estate management, passing shrewd judgements on the land market and enclosure, and showing an up-to-date knowledge of trends in agricultural thinking when, for instance, advocating turning estates over to dairy farming. His lively commentaries on current events, court machinations, and social scandals are a vital strand of the seventeenth-century Verney correspondence. Denton died at his house in Covent Garden, London on 9 May 1691. His lifelong friend Sir Ralph Verney had hurried from the country to his bedside. Denton was buried at Hillesden, Buckinghamshire. His epitaph in Hillesden church captures his personality: &#145;He was blessed with that happy composition of Body and Mind that preserved him chearfull, easy and agreeable to the last, and endeared him to all that knew him&#146;.<br>
