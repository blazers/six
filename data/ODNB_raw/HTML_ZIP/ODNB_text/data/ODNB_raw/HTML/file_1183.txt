<span class="headword">Balfour,  Clara  Lucas</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Clara Lucas]</span>  (1808&#150;1878), <span class="occ">advocate of women's advancement and temperance activist</span>, was born in the New Forest, Hampshire, on 21 December 1808. She was the only child of John Lydell Lucas (<i>c</i>.1767&#150;1818), a butcher and cattle dealer from Gosport, and Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1834, maiden name unknown), both of whom were relatively well educated. By the age of four Clara could already read exceptionally well. At a very young age she was removed from her mother's care and went to live with her father and his family on the Isle of Wight. Family oral history has it that &#145;a great wrong&#146; had been done to Sarah, having been &#145;deceived by a form of marriage she later discovered to be bigamous&#146;  (Cunliffe-Jones, 10). This may help explain why Clara was baptized only at the age of nine after her father's death in 1818, and why there is no evidence of Clara's parents living together during her childhood. In 1818 Clara and her mother moved to London, where for several years they lived close to poverty, supporting themselves by needlework. However, between 1819 and 1822 enough money was scraped together to send Clara to a boarding-school in Woodford.<br>
<br>On 29 September 1824 Clara married James Balfour (1796&#150;1884), who was nearly twenty-eight. Clara was not yet sixteen. For the first two decades of their married life the Balfours lived &#145;at the bottom of the wheel of Fortune&#146;  (Dunlop, 153) with no reliable income. Between 1825 and 1843 they had seven children, four of whom, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46588/', "Jabez Spencer Balfour")</script>, survived into adulthood. During the first thirteen years of their marriage Clara Lucas Balfour's already harsh life was further burdened by her husband's excessive drinking. Her firsthand experience of the physical and psychological consequences of alcoholism is vividly and accurately portrayed in her later temperance writing. However, in spite of the hardship of their early married life, she still somehow found time to continue her self-education, and at some point in the mid-1830s she began to write.<br>
<br>A key event in the lives of the Balfours occurred in 1837 when they became aware of the still young temperance movement. After hearing a temperance address on 9 October 1837 James signed &#145;the pledge&#146;. Clara then signed on 16 October 1837. From this point onwards, both the Balfours remained dedicated to the cause of temperance.<br>
<br>At this period, some time between 1837 and 1840, Clara Lucas Balfour wrote <span class="italic">Common Sense versus Socialism</span>, an attack on a local Owenite group, which brought her to the attention of the Carlyles, Jane (1801&#150;1866) and Thomas (1795&#150;1881), who quickly became key patrons and friends of the Balfours. In 1838 she began writing for the temperance cause, publishing <span class="italic">The Triumph of Teetotalism over Quackery</span> and <span class="italic">King Alcohol's Walk</span>. Although she herself had been christened, and had christened her own children, in the Church of England, in 1840 Clara Lucas Balfour wrote to Jabez Burns (1805&#150;1876), temperance campaigner, writer, and minister of the Baptist chapel, Church Street, Edgeware, asking to be rebaptized. Having converted, she then remained an active and central figure in the Baptist community throughout her life.<br>
<br>Also in 1840 the Balfours met John Dunlop (1789&#150;1868), pioneering temperance campaigner and author of <span class="italic">Artificial and Compulsory Drinking Usages in Great Britain and Ireland</span> (1839). Dunlop encouraged Clara Lucas Balfour to expand her temperance work, arranging for her to have a salary of &pound;25 for co-editing the <span class="italic">Temperance Journal</span> in May of 1841, and then encouraging her to lecture. She began by speaking on temperance at ladies' &#145;drawing room&#146; meetings, but in October 1841 gave her first public lecture. Almost immediately she branched out from the subject of temperance and began lecturing on a wide variety of topics, including literature, biography, and history, but most notably on such subjects as &#145;Capacities of women&#146; and &#145;The idea of education as applied to woman&#146;. Clara Lucas Balfour's unusual and pioneering career as a professional woman lecturer was in full swing by the end of 1842, with her lectures no longer limited to speaking to groups of ladies in the London area. For the next thirty years she maintained a gruelling schedule, speaking to large audiences of working men at mechanics' institutes and to other single- and mixed-sex public forums as far afield as Sheffield and Plymouth.<br>
<br>At the same time as her lecturing career began, Clara Lucas Balfour's first collection of temperance poems and tales, <span class="italic">A Garland of Waterflowers</span>, was published in 1841. From this point on she wrote as prolifically as she lectured. She contributed almost weekly to a number of temperance journals, such as <span class="italic">British Workman</span>, <span class="italic">Band of Hope Review</span>, and the <span class="italic">Temperance Journal</span>. She wrote over thirty temperance works, including <span class="italic">Morning Dewdrops</span> (1853), prefaced by Harriet Beecher Stowe (1811&#150;1896) and still being reprinted in the 1890s, <span class="italic">The Victim</span> (1860), <span class="italic">Confessions of a Decanter</span> (1862), and <span class="italic">Our &#145;Old October&#146;</span> (1868). In 1850 she edited and republished Margaret G. Derenzy's <span class="italic">A Whisper to a Newly Married Pair from a Widowed Wife</span> (1824, hitherto mistakenly attributed to her); and then, building on her love of reading and literature, <span class="italic">Sketches of English Literature from the Fourteenth to the Present Century</span> was written for Longman in 1852.<br>
<br>Clara Lucas Balfour's other non-temperance writing focused on issues of social and moral reform, and on women's role in society and history. In works such as <span class="italic">The Women of Scripture</span> (1847), <span class="italic">Working Women of the Last Half Century: the Lessons of their Lives</span> (1854), <span class="italic">The Bible Patterns of a Good Woman</span> (1867), and <span class="italic">Women Worth Emulating</span> (1877), she manipulated Victorian &#145;domestic ideology&#146;, which situated women exclusively in the private sphere. Arguing for a drastic improvement in women's education in order that they would then be better prepared to carry out their duty as society's moral and spiritual guardians, she has been interpreted as merely reinforcing patriarchal notions of the ideal Victorian woman. However, Clara Lucas Balfour also consistently argued that the women who strove to live up to this notion of &#145;ideal womanhood&#146; were not in any way feeble-minded or inadequate in relation to men. For her, woman was &#145;emphatically called the &#147;help-meet&#148; of man, not help-less, not inadequate, and therefore not inferior&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Women of Scripture</span>, 12). Whereas she has previously been regarded almost exclusively in the light of her temperance work, a century later feminist historians can view her &#145;separate spheres feminism&#146; as a necessary precursor to the late nineteenth-century women's movement. Through the example of her own life, and through her use of biography and history in her writing and lectures, Clara Lucas Balfour provided her contemporaries with much needed examples of women &#145;doing, as well as suffering; thinking as well as feeling; directing, as well as obeying&#146;  (<span class="italic">Working Women of the Last Half Century</span>, 3).<br>
<br>In 1876, after almost forty years of temperance campaigning and lecturing on &#145;the woman question&#146;, Clara Lucas Balfour was a key motivator in the creation of the British Women's Temperance Association, which over the next two decades would be closely involved in the social purity movement and in the fight for women's suffrage. She was elected its president in May 1877. Clara Lucas Balfour died of cancer of the uterus at 88 London Road, Croydon, on 3 July 1878, and was buried in Paddington cemetery.<br>
