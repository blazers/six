<span class="headword">Paterson, Sir  Alexander Henry</span>  (1884&#150;1947), <span class="occ">penal reformer and prison commissioner</span>, was born on 20 November 1884 at Bowdon, Cheshire, the youngest child of Alexander Edgar Paterson, a solicitor, and his wife, Katherine Esther Dixon, a voluntary worker. The family background was Unitarian, although Paterson later became a member of the Church of England. He was educated at Bowdon College and at University College, Oxford, where he was secretary of the union. He graduated in 1906 with a third-class degree in <i>literae humaniores</i>. Much later, in 1944, he was elected an honorary fellow. He married Frances Margaret Baker in 1927 and the couple had one daughter.<h2>
<a name="Socialwork"></a>Social work</h2>At Oxford, Paterson developed an enduring concern about poverty in London and became increasingly involved in voluntary social work with the Oxford Medical Mission in Bermondsey, later known as the Oxford and Bermondsey Club. He took a leading role in the development of the social club and following graduation went to live in Bermondsey, where he also worked as an unpaid elementary school teacher. Paterson devoted his attention to the plight of young people living in poverty, and in particular he involved himself in social work activities with boys. In 1911 he wrote <span class="italic">Across the Bridges</span>, in which he vividly described the extent of deprivation and material disadvantage in this part of London at that time. He urged the need for &#145;knowledge and understanding&#146; of social problems and his ideals for change were based upon a faith which emphasized religion as an instrument of reform.<br>
<br>Paterson's social work activities in Bermondsey almost inevitably led to concerns about crime and about the treatment of offenders. In 1908 he became assistant director of the Borstal Association, which was responsible for the supervision and aftercare of borstal boys, and in 1909 he was asked to organize the first experiment in aftercare for adult prisoners. In 1911, when the Central Association for the Aid of Discharged Prisoners was formed under the instruction of the home secretary, Winston Churchill, Paterson became assistant director and made regular visits to convict prisons to discuss the needs of prisoners due for release.<br>
<br>In the First World War Paterson served in France with the Bermondsey battalion as a private and later as captain. His fellow soldiers, many of whom were young men from his social club, are said to have appreciated his courage and daring but also his good nature and sense of humour in what must have been grim circumstances. He was badly wounded in action and later received the Military Cross. Back home he became a founding member of Toc H, the society of (originally ex-service) men and women for Christian fellowship and social service, and was made the first chairman of its central executive when it received its charter in 1922.<h2>
<a name="Penalreformer"></a>Penal reformer</h2>Paterson was a major driving force behind penal reform as well as many of the more general reforms of the inter-war years. Following a period of attachment to the Ministry of Labour, in 1922 he became a member of the Prison Commission (later dissolved when the prison department of the Home Office was established in 1963). Unlike other prison commissioners Paterson had no official connection with the prison service or Home Office before his appointment and, while never chairman of the Prison Commission, he was its most dominant figure and spent nearly a quarter of a century working for reform of the prison system. This was a period of significant optimism in penal reform. A mood of scepticism about the efficacy of prison, which originated before the First World War and which was carried over into the inter-war period, was replaced by a new mood in which prisons were increasingly seen as positive institutions that could act as agencies for human change.<br>
<br>Paterson's vision for penal reform was very much influenced by his earlier work, which had shown him many of the social harms of imprisonment. He was well aware of the &#145;pains of imprisonment&#146; and of the dehumanizing effects of confinement on the individual offender as well as the impact on their families. He highlighted the ways in which prisoners deteriorate, mentally and morally, throughout the duration of a prison sentence and argued that prisons should primarily be concerned with treatment and reform. Thus, in his evidence to the 1931 persistent offenders' committee he argued that imprisonment was a &#145;clumsy piece of social surgery&#146; and advocated the abolition of all prisons, and their replacement with institutions dedicated to reform and training.<br>
<br>Paterson's evidence to the committee also shows the growing influence of the medical model of crime control, and how changing notions about penal purpose legitimated a treatment approach and the increased intervention of the medical profession. The role of the courts, he argued, was not &#145;to weigh out a dose of punishment&#146;, but rather &#145;to diagnose &hellip; and to prescribe the right form of training or treatment for the condition&#146;  (<span class="italic">Departmental Committee on Persistent Offenders</span>, 3.669).<br>
<br>While Paterson's ambition of abolitionism was not achieved, the impact of the rehabilitative approach was swiftly felt. Among the many significant changes in penal measures was the removal of the more dehumanizing practices that destroyed self-identity and self-respect. Thus, the &#145;convict crop&#146; and the broad arrows marking prisoners' clothing were abolished, facilities were made available for men to shave for the first time, and the rule of silence was greatly relaxed, allowing prisoners to associate for meals and recreation. Educational and training facilities were extended, and provision was made for prisoners to receive visits from voluntary prison visitors. Efforts were made to improve the work available to prisoners. Unproductive labour and the treadmill were abolished and a seven-hour working day was introduced. During this period also experiments with open prisons for adults were started at Wakefield prison, where certain prisoners were allowed to sleep in non-secure accommodation.<h2>
<a name="Borstals"></a>Borstals</h2>Of all his inspiring ideals for penal reform Paterson is perhaps chiefly remembered for his impact on the borstal system. Indeed, he has been described as &#145;the man whose conviction and initiative were to change the very spirit of borstal training in its golden age&#146;  (Hood, 104). He was largely responsible for refashioning the regime during this period. He intended borstals to be run according to English public school principles with the aim of reforming and training younger offenders. In contrast to previous regimes characterized by enforced discipline, Paterson introduced a system designed around notions of personal responsibility, self-discipline, and decision making. Thus, in his 1932 book, <span class="italic">The Principles of the Borstal System</span>, Paterson stated that his aim was &#145;Not to break or knead [the offender] into shape&#146;, but instead to &#145;stimulate some power within to regulate conduct aright&#146;  (Ruck, 97). It was only through making their own decisions, Paterson believed, that people could change.<br>
<br>Paterson organized the borstals around the public school model of the house system, where institutional loyalty was fostered through inter-house sports and recreational activities. He appointed housemasters who were expected to take a close interest in their charges and introduced the post of matron to oversee housekeeping and to provide a maternal influence. In keeping with the emphasis on personal relationships, in 1924 uniform for borstal officers was abolished and all staff were encouraged to involve themselves with the boys in a wide variety of activities.<br>
<br>The growing influence of rehabilitationist arguments and the innovative optimism inherent in the borstal formula led to further experiments in the care of younger offenders. In 1924 cross-country marches and camping were introduced with apparent success (as measured by a lack of absconding). This success was self-propelling. In 1929 the prison commissioners' annual report foreshadowed the building of a new borstal at Lowdham Grange in Nottinghamshire to cope with the demand for places. This new establishment was inaugurated by a long march in 1930 by a group of staff and boys from Feltham borstal to Lowdham Grange. Led by the Feltham governor, W. W. Llewellin, this famous march is considered to be one of the high points of borstal history. In 1935 Llewellin led a second march from Stafford to Freiston, Lincolnshire, where another borstal, North Sea Camp, was established.<br>
<br>With a certain showmanship, and what has been described as &#145;that special blend of compassion and arrogance so long the hallmark of English public service&#146;  (King and Elliott, 5), Paterson promoted the borstal as a form of social service. In so doing he won support from the public and politicians alike. There were approving visits from senior politicians, and it is perhaps to Paterson's credit that developments in the borstal system received no serious criticism from the communities in which the institutions were located.<br>
<br>The goal of rehabilitation became foremost in the penal approach more generally and the borstal formula&#151;emphasizing personal relationships, responsibility, and trust&#151;gradually had an impact on the prison system as a whole. The need for a variety of security settings was increasingly recognized and an emphasis on casework, through care, and preparation for release and resettlement was paramount. Paterson became influential across the whole range of penal measures and his values were evident in penal documents and legislation on punishment throughout the 1920s and 1930s. Moreover, as a rehabilitationist who believed that crime, like other social problems, could be studied scientifically to establish its causes, Paterson, along with some senior government officials, strongly advocated the need to establish criminology as an academic discipline.<h2>
<a name="Internationalinfluence"></a>International influence</h2>An ardent traveller throughout the inter-war period, Paterson also drew upon the ideas and experiences of other countries. Like John Howard before him, he travelled abroad examining the various forms of confinement and reporting in graphic detail on prison conditions. On one such visit to Europe, he reviewed the conditions in a women's prison. He noted that while the prison was &#145;staffed by a splendid body of nuns&#146;, adherence to the silent system had a dehumanizing effect on the women prisoners. In an article in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, on 5 August 1925, he advocated that women prisoners should live and work together in small units in non-secure establishments, preferably in rural settings. In the early 1930s Paterson spent time visiting penal and reformatory establishments in the United States, and his findings were published in two articles, as &#145;U.S. way with crime&#146;, in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, on 10 and 11 July 1931.<br>
<br>As the English borstal system gained success and public esteem Paterson was invited to advise other countries on penal measures and his influence spread at an international level. In 1925, for example, he visited Burma where he demonstrated that younger offenders could be kept in non-secure settings, irrespective of the nature of their crime. His expertise on penal administration also formed the basis of advice to the Colonial Office, and throughout the 1930s he visited a number of British colonies. As a result of one visit to a penal settlement in Cayenne, Paterson was influential in the later decision to discontinue transportation to British Guiana.<br>
<br>Paterson became an active member of the international penal and penitentiary commission and was elected vice-president in 1938 and later acting president in 1943. At a congress meeting held in Berlin in 1935 Paterson fiercely opposed the reactionary penal doctrines advocated by members of the National Socialist Party in Germany. In keeping with his earlier work he argued that the purpose of imprisonment should be the &#145;protection of society by the social readaptation of the prisoners&#146; and his proposals found support among delegates from a number of nations, including the United States, Belgium, Holland, and the Scandinavian countries.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Paterson acted as director of the Czechoslovakia Refugee Trust, devoting his attention in particular to the social welfare of children and young people, many of whom were orphaned or otherwise separated from their parents. In other ways he was also involved in the war effort and in 1940 he was asked by senior politicians to visit internment camps in Canada to explore the extent of national sympathy.<br>
<br>The spirit of the Paterson era of penal reform faltered after 1945 as rehabilitative approaches fell out of favour. There was an unprecedented increase in recorded crime which, together with the growing post-war affluence, challenged reformers' claims that crime would be reduced through the growth of social welfare. The medical model, advocated by Paterson, began to come under considerable criticism, not least because it was becoming apparent that it could be used to legitimate a whole range of interventions in the lives of captive audiences that seemed far from humane. In addition, rehabilitative policies resulted in an increase in the length of prison sentences. Paterson himself, while advocating the abolition of prisons, had earlier acknowledged that if offenders were to go to prison, then the sentence needed to be sufficiently long for treatment and training to take effect. Thus in a 1927 <span class="italic">Report of the Commissioners of Prisons</span>, Paterson commented, &#145;if we are concerned to train [the offender], a few weeks in prison will be an idle pretence&#146;  (xiii). The longer sentences that resulted from rehabilitative policies, together with the individualization of sentences, made such approaches seem harsh and raised fundamental questions about justice and about the rights of offenders to receive proportionate sentences.<h2>
<a name="Significance"></a>Significance</h2>In the early post-war years, the lack of any well defined objectives or indicators for judging the success or otherwise of the penal system became clearly evident. It has been argued that despite the &#145;well-meaning and paternalistic&#146; efforts on the part of the prison commissioners to a process of penal reform, a lack of clarity of purpose dominated a system &#145;peopled at the top by gentlemen and amateurs&#146;  (King and Elliott, 5).<br>
<br>Paterson died in London on 7 November 1947, the same year in which he received a knighthood. He was survived by his wife. While many ardent supporters remained, the reformist tradition that was associated with Paterson did not last long. Within a few years of the end of the war penal priorities became increasingly driven by the sharp increases in crime and prison numbers and by the justice model of crime control.<br>
<br>Alexander Paterson has been described as a man with charismatic determination. In his advocacy of penal reform he proved to be one of a select group who might be considered as genuine innovators. He influenced a real change of penal perspective generally while also showing that imprisonment in England, and elsewhere, was deeply flawed. In addition to his public labour his social work values were evident in his personal work with individuals. He regularly corresponded and socialized with ex-prisoners and maintained his early commitment to principles of social welfare. He was physically depicted as a powerful man with broad shoulders, deep chest, and a &#145;contemplative face&#146;; his contemporaries appreciated his capacity for enjoyment as well as his turn of phrase. Indeed, in addition to the real changes to the penal system he expressed many fine and subsequently oft quoted dictums. One such aphorism revealed his fundamental belief that &#145;men are sent to prison as a punishment, not for punishment&#146;. In addition, his famous paradox of training people for freedom in an &#145;atmosphere of captivity and repression&#146; has continued to haunt the prison system ever since it was first uttered.<br>
