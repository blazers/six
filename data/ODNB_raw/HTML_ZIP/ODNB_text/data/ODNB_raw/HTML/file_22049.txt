<span class="headword">Petre,  William</span>, fourth Baron Petre  (1625/6&#150;1684), <span class="occ">nobleman and victim of the Popish Plot</span>, was the eldest son of Robert Petre, third Baron Petre (1599&#150;1638), and Mary (1603&#150;1685), daughter of Anthony Browne, second Viscount Montagu. Although his twin brother, John, quickly sickened and died William appears to have been a fairly robust infant, upon whom the hopes of his house were settled. A full-length portrait of him, aged six, was commissioned from J. Parker in 1632, and shows him as an anxious, self-possessed child, who still had the need for a coral suckling stick or dummy. He came into his title and estates after the premature death of his father, in October 1638, and&#151;at the outbreak of the civil war&#151;was made a ward of the king. It is possible that he watched the battle of Edgehill, on 23 October 1642, from the comparative safety of the royalist baggage train, before returning to Charles I's wartime capital at Oxford. Upon his arrival he was placed under the care and supervision of the earl of Northampton, who chose to put him to his studies under the careful eye of a protestant tutor. Petre could not, however, be shaken from his attachment to the Roman Catholic faith in which he had been raised. Though he and his devoted servants continued to mask his beliefs&#151;until the Restoration&#151;in an attempt to prevent the total sequestration of his estates, there is every reason to believe that the heady atmosphere of ultra-royalism that he imbibed while at Oxford was of far more significance to his subsequent intellectual development than the admonitions of his rather ineffectual and pedestrian tutor.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1655 Petre was arrested at Westminster and imprisoned on suspicion that he was planning to take part in a projected royalist rebellion. Held until August he anxiously petitioned Secretary Thurloe for his release, declaring that it was impossible to find another man &#145;that hath lesse crime upon him&#146;  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 3.699). Despite his subsequent release Petre found that life under the republican government was becoming increasingly uncongenial. Consequently, he sought&#151;and obtained&#151;passes to go to France in March and November 1658, and &#145;beyond the seas&#146; in June that year  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1658&#150;9</i>, 583). However, it is not certain if he made use of them, for in the summer of 1659 he was arrested and taken into custody in Sussex in order to prevent his possible involvement in a fresh cycle of royalist insurrection. It was only after the collapse of Booth's rising that the council of state finally ordered his release, on 13 August 1659.<br>
<br>Denied a significant role at the heart of national government on account of his religion Petre seems, at the Restoration, to have been content to live in quiet seclusion, overseeing the administration of his large Essex estates from his seat at Ingatestone Hall. However, the state of his troubled marriage to Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1665), eldest daughter of John Savage, second Earl Rivers, whom he married in or before 1655, returned him to the public eye. Though handsome and high spirited in her youth Elizabeth's infidelities and heavy drinking had caused the couple to separate at some point before the spring of 1664. Faced by a warrant for her arrest for debt she claimed that she was exempt from the charges on account of her privilege as a peeress of the realm. William Joyce, the unfortunate chaloner who had attempted to recoup his losses through the prosecution, was subsequently reported by her to the House of Lords' committee of privileges, and was imprisoned for contempt in April 1664 in a remarkable reversal of fortune. Joyce was released upon bail and was compelled to apologize to both the house and to Lady Petre upon bended knee. This, however, did not satisfy Elizabeth, who declared &#145;that Revenge was sweeter to her than milk&#146; and provoked a public row with her husband, who thought that the conduct of his estranged wife was bringing him nothing but disgrace  (Pepys, 5.128). Despite her vow to continue pursuing Joyce &#145;if she lived [to] the age of Methusalem&#146; Elizabeth died, still unsatisfied, on 19 July 1665, and was denied burial in the traditional Petre burial vault, her body being relegated to the New Chapel at Ingatestone  (Pepys, 5.126).<br>
<br>Having married, by 15 April 1675, Bridget (1652/3&#150;1695), daughter and coheir of his neighbours, John and Anne Pincheon of Writtle, Petre was unprepared for the storm that broke over him, in late 1678, as the result of Titus Oates's fevered allegations of a popish plot which aimed to overthrow the state and murder the king. Petre was named in Oates's initial deposition, sworn before Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey on 6 September 1678, and the justice's mysterious death, shortly afterwards, served to lend credence to the story, which might otherwise have been entirely lacking. Despite his having had no formal military training it was claimed that Petre was one of a number of leading Catholic magnates who aimed forcibly to reimpose their faith upon the peoples of the British Isles, and that he had received a commission as the lieutenant-general of an invading army, stamped and sealed by Johannes Paulus d'Olivia, the head of the Jesuit order. Further corroboration appeared to be provided by the testimony of Miles Prance, who swore that he had heard that Petre was intent upon levying war, that he had already appointed officers for the task, and that &#145;there would very shortly be Fifty thousand men in Arms&#146; awaiting his command  (<span class="italic">A True Narrative and Discovery</span>, 4&#150;5). Following Oates's repetition of his allegations before the Commons in October, Petre was arrested along with four other Roman Catholic lords, Belasyse, Powis, Arundel, and Stafford, and charged with high treason. Committed to the Tower of London on 28 October, he was finally permitted to seek legal counsel in early December, and on 8 April 1679 he was summoned to appear before the bar of the Lords in order to hear the indictment read against him. However, despite the repeated pleas of his friends and the incessant clamouring of Oates and his following, further charges and a firm date for the trial were not forthcoming. Fortunately his plea of not guilty had been entered and accepted by the Lords as a legal answer to the charges brought, and he was allowed permission to visit his wife, who was still recovering after the difficult delivery of their only child, Mary (1679&#150;1704), who had been born a month before.<br>
<br>In November 1679 royal assent was given to the bill stripping Petre of his membership of the Lords, while the hapless Viscount Stafford was found guilty and sent to the block in December 1680. However, the lack of a second prosecution witness, in addition to Prance, and the resurgence of the tories' political strength in 1681&#150;2, increasingly rendered the chances of Petre's successful conviction an unlikely event. As the scaffolding erected in Westminster Hall to accommodate spectators for his projected trial began to decay, the threat under which Petre had laboured began to evaporate and his spirits began to rise. His confinement in the Tower had never been particularly harsh and, having taken lodgings in the home of one of the warders, he was often permitted to dine with noble visitors. On 19 August 1683 it was reported that during a game of &#145;nine pins in the bowling green&#146; he had been &#145;very merry&#146; and had declared that he expected to be &#145;cleared about next spring &hellip; by parliament&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1683</i>, 308). Sadly, at precisely the moment when deliverance appeared to be close at hand, his health finally broke down. He had suffered occasional bouts of illness throughout his imprisonment, but in October 1683 he suddenly sickened and was in &#145;danger of speedy death&#146;. In December his wife desperately petitioned the king that he needed a &#145;change of air, which his physicians are ready to attest&#146; and that he was prepared to offer a bond for his good conduct  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1683&#150;4</i>, 145). However, Charles II chose to ignore her pleas and Petre's condition continued to worsen. Knowing that his end was upon him Petre composed a final declaration in which he vigorously defended the Roman Catholic church from charges that it promoted regicide, and proclaimed his own continuing innocence as: &#145;a Dying but Dutiful Subject &hellip; [who had] lain so long under a false and injurious Calumny of a horrid Plot&#146;  (<span class="italic">Declaration</span>, 1). On 4 January 1684 the lord lieutenant of the Tower wrote that reports of the prisoner's death were still premature, &#145;though we expect it every hour&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1683&#150;4</i>, 199). In the event, he had not long to wait, for Petre died in the Tower the very next day. Having been permitted to claim the body of her husband Lady Petre had his remains taken back to Essex and buried them in the family vault at Ingatestone church, on 10 January 1684. She died on 5 January 1695, aged forty-two, and was buried with him.<br>
<br>Yet even in death controversy continued to attach itself to Petre's name, and the publication of his <span class="italic">Declaration</span> sparked the exchange of rival, and bitterly polemical, pamphlets. While the anonymous author of <span class="italic">Observations on a Paper Intituled, &#145;The Declaration of the Lord Petre&#146;</span> (1684) chose to cast doubt upon the authorship of his last statement, arguing that it smelt &#145;rank of a Popish Priests Contrivance&#146;  (p. 2), the writer of <span class="italic">A Pair of Spectacles for Mr. Observer</span> (1684) attested to its provenance and capably refuted the idea of a highly organized and covert Catholic plot, stating that &#145;his <i>Lordship</i> [had] to hundreds &hellip; of very <i>Worthy Protestants</i> (who during his Confinement came often to him) <i>most solemnly declar'd his Innocence</i>&#146;  (p. 1). It is clear that Petre's sufferings aroused considerable public sympathy, and the duke of York was quick to take advantage of the sudden sea change, successfully pressing for the release of the surviving Catholic lords at the next session of the king's bench, on 18 February 1684. Petre was succeeded in his peerage by his brothers John (<i>bap</i>. 1629, <i>d</i>. 1685) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74978/', "Thomas Petre (bap. 1633, d. 1707)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64188/', "Petre family")</script>].<br>
