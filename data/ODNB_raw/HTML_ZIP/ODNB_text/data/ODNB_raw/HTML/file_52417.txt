<span class="headword">Niven, Sir  (Cecil) Rex</span>  (1898&#150;1993), <span class="occ">colonial official and author</span>, was born on 20 November 1898 in Torquay, the only son of the Revd Dr George Cecil Niven, missionary, and his wife, Jeanne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rawlings. Educated at Blundell's School, Tiverton, Devon, he went up to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1916. Three defining memories of his youth never faded: his childhood travels with his mother from Japan and a lengthy visit to Egypt; the wartime interruption to his undergraduate studies at his beloved Balliol College, leading to service as a lieutenant with the Royal Field Artillery in France in 1917, where he won the MC in the last battle of the war before returning to graduate in 1920 in modern history on the unclassified shortened honours course; and his commitment to the Church of England, in which he had been reared. Like so many of his ex-officer generation, Niven saw in his wartime leadership and responsibilities the making of a likely career in the colonial service, then actively recruiting to make up its manpower losses. After three months' training, he was posted to Nigeria in 1921, at &pound;500 p.a.<br>
<br>During his forty years' service, all of it spent in Nigeria, Niven moved steadily, even rapidly, up the slow post-war promotional ladder, his reputation for being something of an intellectual as well as an extremely keen administrator growing all the time. In Maiduguri, bordering on the Sahara, he planted a million seedlings of the handy Indian shade tree the neem, for which amenity he was long gratefully remembered. His deep experience of field administration and the native authority system (that bedrock of the Lugardian policy of indirect rule), which earned him the residentship of the major emirate provinces of Kano and then Bornu, was matched by Whitehall-style experience of secretariat work not only in the regional headquarters of Kaduna but also in the central government in Lagos. Here, during the sensitive war years, the governor, Sir Bernard Bourdillon, assigned Niven the job of establishing a public relations office, the first of its kind in Nigeria. This Niven accomplished with characteristic flair, earning the bonus (which was to stand him in such good stead in the coming years) of getting to know personally many of the nascent nationalist leaders. He was appointed senior resident in 1947. Yet, to his chagrin rather than to the surprise of some of his colleagues, when the ultimate chance of gubernatorial office came within his reach in 1952, the hoped-for prize eluded him. Despite having twice acted as lieutenant-governor, Niven was not appointed to Kaduna.<br>
<br>Though Niven retired from the colonial service in 1954, he continued his Nigerian career for another decade. For a while he represented one of the country's large commercial firms, persuading local authorities and the government to buy Land Rovers and Bailey bridges. Already appointed president of the Northern house of assembly (of which he had been a member since 1947) in 1952, he held the post until 1958, when he became its first speaker. Here was an office whose dignity Niven at once enjoyed and enhanced: &#145;he loved ceremony and was not against pageant&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 27 Feb 1993). He personally chose the robes with Messrs Ede and Ravenscroft and was influential in the selection of the &#145;Northern knot&#146; as the legislature's device. Succeeded by a Northern Nigerian at self-government, he accepted the invitation of the independent government to serve as commissioner on special duties, from 1959 to 1962.<br>
<br>Niven finally retired in 1962. He spent the next six years serving Mervyn Stockwood as deputy secretary of the Southwark diocesan board of finance. In 1968 he was back in Nigeria, at the invitation of the federal government of General Yakubu Gowon, to advise them on how to present their case against the secession of Biafra, a public relations campaign which they seemed to be losing in the outside world. Back in Britain he settled in Kent, first at Deal and then at Walmer. From 1976 to 1980 he was a member of the general synod for the Canterbury diocese. He also served on a number of councils, including the Royal Society of Arts, and was a life member of the British Red Cross Society as well as a member of the Britain&#150;Nigeria Association. His wife, Dorothy Marshall, the daughter of David Marshall Mason, MP and banker, whom he had married on 9 June 1925 and who had shared all his Nigerian years, died in 1977, a few years after the death of their younger daughter in a sailing accident off Ramsgate. In 1980 Niven married Pamela, widow of Dr O. H. B. Beerbohm and daughter of G. C. Leach of the Indian Civil Service. A staunch Oxonian, at the age of ninety he &#145;mischievously&#146;, as he related the episode, put his name forward for the vacant mastership of Balliol.<br>
<br>Everything Niven did was &#145;full of that zest, which was the touchstone of his personality&#146;  (<span class="italic">Balliol College Annual Record</span>, 97). He had a lively sense of humour, sometimes bordering on the malicious and shading into the sarcastic when he told tales of his seniors in the service. &#145;No-one&#146;, he wrote of one governor under whom he served, &#145;could describe him as cosy or approachable&#146;  (Niven, 193). A prolific writer with a dozen books to his name, at one time his <span class="italic">A Short History of Nigeria</span> (1937) and <span class="italic">How Nigeria is Governed</span> (1950) were widely read in Nigerian schools. His long-concealed ghosting of the autobiography of Sir Ahmadu Bello, the sardauna of Sokoto and first premier of Northern Nigeria, <span class="italic">My Life</span> (1960), resulted in an important and finely crafted book. While Niven's <span class="italic">The War of Nigerian Unity</span> (1970) was too <i>parti pris</i> to constitute a lasting contribution to the literature on the Biafran war, his memoir (in no sense an autobiography, for it opens with his departure for Lagos in 1921) <span class="italic">Nigerian Kaleidoscope</span> (1982) remains in the front rank of colonial service reminiscences.<br>
<br>Niven was appointed CMG in 1952 and knighted in 1960. He died at Buckland Hospital, Dover, on 22 February 1993. He was survived by his second wife and the elder of his two daughters by his first marriage.<br>
