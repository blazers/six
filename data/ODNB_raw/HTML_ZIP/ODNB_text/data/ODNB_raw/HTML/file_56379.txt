<span class="headword">Peek,  James</span>  (1800&#150;1879), <span class="occ">biscuit manufacturer</span>, was born on 8 June 1800, the sixth and youngest son of John Peek (1735&#150;1847), farmer and landowner of Loddiswell, Devon, and his wife, Susanna. He was educated locally and then joined his brothers Richard and William in a tea, coffee, and spice dealers' business in Coleman Street, London. The firm became Peek Bros. and Winch in 1895.<br>
<br>The brothers worked extremely hard. James Peek as a partner is said not to have taken even one day's holiday for many years, maintaining the books in the counting-house and keeping a weather eye on all sides of the firm. However, he found time to marry Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1867), only daughter of James Masters, a Londoner, in 1824; she was the last in line of the Lemaitre family, Huguenots who had emigrated from Dieppe after the edict of Nantes was revoked in 1685. They had three daughters and three sons; the eldest, Henry William (1825&#150;1898), headed the tea firm, served as an MP, and was created a baronet in 1874.<br>
<br>By 1857 Peek had enough capital to consider setting up his younger sons in a separate business. That year he therefore established a biscuit manufactory, Peek Frean &amp; Co., at Bermondsey in London, jointly with his nephew by marriage, George Hender Frean, a flour miller and engineer. Although both sons left the business, Peek stayed to become the driving force and main investor, exerting influence mainly from his nearby residence in Blackheath. His detailed instructions for managers show the bent of his mind. He insisted on the most thorough checks to avoid employee fraud. &#145;Suspicion is necessary in large establishments; <i>thousands are ruined for want of it</i>&#146;  (Davis, 1.23).<br>
<br>Peek's substantial investment of &pound;30,000, plus the factory buildings he bought and leased to the firm, allowed it to start on a far more extensive scale than was usual; in 1858 it produced thirty-five different types of fancy biscuit. However, it incurred losses until mid-1861, partly through a decision to make under licence the aerated bread invented by Dr John Dauglish. This did not catch on; once it was discontinued, the firm moved into profit. John Carr, brother of Jonathan Dodgson Carr, was invited in 1860 to work for Peek Frean; in 1872 his son Arthur Carr joined the firm.<br>
<br>Peek Frean gained much publicity from its contract with the French government to supply ship's biscuits during the Italian campaign of 1866, and again during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870&#150;71; the latter contract also helped to relieve hunger during the siege of Paris. In mid-1871 the firm ceased producing ship's biscuits and concentrated on the fancy varieties; the Garibaldi, Pearl, and Marie biscuits were particularly popular. The original factory was destroyed by fire in 1873, and its successor's clock tower near London Bridge Station remained a landmark for many decades.<br>
<br>Frean ceased to be an active partner in 1875, and Peek brought in as partner his son-in-law Thomas Stone. The latter's two sons subsequently became partners, but the Stone trio were not very progressive. While turnover in 1879 totalled &pound;475,000, net profit was only &pound;20,000.<br>
<br>Peek was described as a little, dried-up man, clean-shaven and detesting beards; only the full beard sported by Frean was tolerated. Peek was invariably dressed in black, with an old-fashioned stock instead of a collar. Baptized in an independent chapel, throughout his life he held strong evangelical views, conducting business strictly but fairly, though somewhat over-anxious to chase the last halfpenny. In the year following his first wife's death in 1867, he married Jane, daughter of Sampson Trehane of Exeter, on 13 October 1868; they had no children. He died on 23 January 1879 at Watcombe Lodge, near Torquay, survived by his second wife, and bequeathing &pound;50,000 to help poor people in Devon.<br>
