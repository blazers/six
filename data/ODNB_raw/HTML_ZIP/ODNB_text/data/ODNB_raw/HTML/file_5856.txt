<span class="headword">Cole,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1520&#150;1571), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, is said to have hailed from Lincolnshire. He may have been brother of both Robert and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5858/', "William Cole")</script>, whose early careers were inextricably confounded by earlier authorities. From the welter of conflicting data it is at least clear that Thomas studied at Oxford, where he commenced MA about 1550.<br>
<br>Headmaster of Maidstone School from 1546, Cole took to preaching against the doctrine of original sin and in January 1551 was one of a group of Kent and Essex &#145;freewillers&#146; arrested by the privy council. Interrogated on 3 February and apparently detained or imprisoned, he thereafter renounced his errors. On 19 February 1553 he preached before Thomas Cranmer a &#145;ringing defence of predestination&#146;  (MacCulloch, 531). The archbishop arranged for its publication as <span class="italic">A godly and frutefull sermon, made at Maydestone the fyrste sonday in Lent, against opinions of the anabaptistes and others</span>. Two extended modern analyses have been published (Martin, 58&#150;60; Penny, 69&#150;73).<br>
<br>One of those specifically exempted from the general pardon issued at Mary's coronation, Cole departed for Frankfurt. A supporter of John Knox and William Whittingham, he sat on the committee that drew up Frankfurt's &#145;new discipline&#146;, later used as the basis of the order of Geneva.<br>
<br>Cole's career is partially explained by a hyperactive streak in his make-up, and his movements abroad, evidently multifarious, cannot be plotted with certainty. It remains unclear whether, like many who supported Knox, he finally abandoned Frankfurt for Geneva, although he certainly berated Robert Wisdom for dealing &#145;uncharitably&#146; with those who chose to do so  (Arber, 95). He was known to Heinrich Bullinger of Z&uuml;rich and was befriended by Wolfgang Weidner of Worms. It is, however, generally accepted that it was William Cole and not Thomas who helped to prepare the Geneva <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and it has been persuasively argued  (Collinson, 191&#150;211) that he can have had no part in writing <span class="italic">A Brieff Discourse off the Troubles Begonne at Franckford</span>.<br>
<br>On Thomas Cole's return to England after Mary's death he was at once absorbed into the hierarchy of London diocese. Instituted rector of High Ongar, Essex, on 9 November 1559 at the presentation of Richard, first Lord Rich, he was collated by Edmund Grindal, bishop of London, both to the archdeaconry of Essex in early 1560 and to the prebend of Rugmere in St Paul's on the following 7 December. Meanwhile, between 20 February and 7 May he acted temporarily as Grindal's commissary in Essex and Hertfordshire. Whilst no commission survives in Matthew Parker's register he was also at this time appointed dean of Bocking, Canterbury's peculiar jurisdiction within Essex and Suffolk. Here was hyperactivity indeed.<br>
<br>Cole's surviving act books indicate that his self-imposed task as archdeacon was to keep a sharp eye out for surviving Catholic sentiments and habits of worship in the parishes under his control. It was probably his vigilance in this respect which prompted the privy council in May 1564 to order an examination of a case of &#145;misdemeanour and contempt&#146; against his authority  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1558&#150;70</i>, 145).<br>
<br>Although Parker clearly contemplated some modest reform of the 1559 settlement as he prepared for the convocation of 1562&#150;3, nothing was in the event achieved, perhaps because the lower house proved more radical than anticipated. Cole was one of thirty-four members, most of them former exiles, who proposed seven articles which, if passed and implemented, would have obviated the vestiarian controversy which divided the church during the following five years. Six more moderate articles were debated instead, failing by a single vote. From this debate Cole and others who had supported the seven articles abstained, possibly on the principle that if they subscribed to half-measures all hope of reopening the debate in the future would be lost.<br>
<br>Cole's radical views did not count against him in high places, probably because he had obtained the patronage of Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester. If the diarist Henry Machyn is to be believed Cole was in 1563 considered for the deanery of Norwich and in 1564 he proceeded DTh at Cambridge as an Oxford MA of fourteen years' standing. At about the same time he preached at Windsor. <span class="italic">A Godly and Learned Sermon, Made this Laste Lent before the Queenes Majestie</span> (1564) was an astonishingly bold performance in which he told the supreme governor to her face that princes should maintain true religion &#145;without any mingle mangle of their own inventions&#146;.<br>
<br>Within weeks he had incurred Parker's wrath. It came to the archbishop's attention that as dean of Bocking Cole was flouting his orders with regard to clerical vestments. Parker evidently withdrew his commission for the deanery and on 10 November transferred it to John Puysant, rector of Latchingdon. Yet meanwhile, on 13 July, Cole had been instituted to the valuable rectory of Stanford Rivers, Essex, on the crown's presentation.<br>
<br>When after January 1565 Parker, ostensibly at Elizabeth's behest, intensified his drive against nonconformity, Cole was among those who orchestrated the opposition. On 20 March twenty leading nonconformists, headed by Miles Coverdale, Whittingham, Thomas Sampson, Laurence Humphrey, and Cole himself, requested the ecclesiastical commissioners to excuse them from the necessity of wearing the canonical habits. According to the endorsement they received a favourable response from Grindal, Robert Horne, bishop of Winchester, and (more surprisingly) Richard Cox, bishop of Ely, only Parker and Edmund Guest, bishop of Rochester, not being listed as &#145;assenting&#146;.<br>
<br>Parker noted on 7 April that, among other signs of resistance, &#145;Mr Cole is now at the Court in his hat and short cloak, which will overthrow all this attempt&#146;  (Bruce and Perowne, 237). Although this was to omit reference to his Cambridge doctorate &#145;Mr Cole&#146; is more likely to have been Thomas than Robert or William. Always accounted an eloquent preacher, Cole appeared at Paul's Cross on 11 November 1565, delivering a diatribe against popish attire, and in March 1566 was chosen by the lord mayor and aldermen, along with Thomas Penny, to preach the city's Spital sermons. Parker was quick to veto the proposal, commenting predictably that he &#145;dare not adventure to commend them for comformable&#146;  (ibid., 264). A fortnight later he summarily suspended thirty-seven city ministers who refused the prescribed vestments.<br>
<br>It is presumably a measure of the influence that Cole was able to wield that Parker had nevertheless restored him as dean of Bocking. At the end of March the archbishop officially instructed Cole to enforce conformity in the Essex and Suffolk peculiars. He cannot have done so in any spirit of facile optimism. Indeed, Cole merely carried the war into the countryside. On May day he preached at Chelmsford as archdeacon and shortly afterwards at Hadleigh, Suffolk, as dean of Bocking. Both sermons were inflammatory and Leicester, probably judging that he was providing Parker with too much ammunition, brought Cole to heel. Cole defended his Chelmsford sermon on the grounds that it was intended to rebut the &#145;impudent conceit&#146; of Catholics  (<span class="italic">Pepys MSS</span>, 90).<br>
<br>The vestiarian controversy in London ceased with more or less abruptness after the autumn of 1566. Cole remained dean of Bocking and archdeacon of Essex and in 1570 he was nominated dean of Salisbury. In the very act of packing up his household and travelling to Salisbury he fell ill and, as Richard Hilles later told Bullinger, died of quinsy after two days' illness. John Parkhurst, bishop of Norwich, also reporting his death, reminded Bullinger that Wolfgang Weidner had been &#145;fond&#146; of Cole  (Robinson, 1.256). Cole's widow, Susan (her maiden name is unknown), was granted letters of administration for his estate on 20 July 1571. Cole was probably buried in High Ongar or Stanford Rivers, Essex.<br>
