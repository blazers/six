</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pelham,  Henry</span>  (1694&#150;1754), <span class="occ">prime minister</span>, was born on 26 September 1694 in London, the eighth of the nine children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21797/', "Thomas Pelham, first Baron Pelham of Laughton (c.1653&#150;1712)")</script>, and his second wife, Lady Grace Holles (1668/9&#150;1700), daughter of Gilbert Holles, third earl of Clare, and his wife, Grace Pierrepont. Throughout his life Pelham was deeply attached to his only surviving brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21801/', "Thomas Pelham Holles")</script>, who was fourteen months his elder and who was created duke of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1715, after inheriting the great estate of their uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13556/', "John Holles, duke of Newcastle upon Tyne")</script>. Pelham attended Westminster School, London, and was enrolled at Hart Hall, Oxford, on 6 September 1710. Upon his father's death in 1712 he inherited some annuities and &pound;5000, at least part of which went to youthful extravagance. At this time his brother gave him an annuity of &pound;1000, and when he came of age in 1715 he inherited land in their home county of Sussex worth &pound;1500 a year. During the Jacobite rising of 1715 Pelham commanded a troop of dragoons and took part in the battle of Preston (12&#150;14 November). He then travelled on the continent, apparently to complete his education, and returned after his brother arranged his election on 28 February 1717 as member of parliament for Seaford, Sussex. The Pelham brothers were whigs, as their father had been since before the revolution of 1688. Their Pelham ancestors had held seats in the Commons since the reign of Elizabeth I.<br>
<br>On 5 April 1722 Pelham was elected to represent the county of Sussex, a seat he held until his death. While his brother Newcastle on 25 May 1720 secured him the court office of treasurer of the chamber, Pelham also became close to Sir Robert Walpole; in his first speech, on 6 May, he moved an address of thanks to the king which was seconded by Walpole. Pelham would never be known as an orator, for his speeches usually were plain and to the point, filled with facts and figures relevant to the subject under debate. On 3 April 1721 he was appointed a member of Walpole's Treasury board, a rapid rise for a young politician. The Pelhams' support of Walpole in his power struggle with John, Lord Carteret, was rewarded in 1724, when Pelham was appointed secretary at war (on 3 April) and Newcastle secretary of state for the southern department (on 14 April). Pelham acted as Walpole's lieutenant in the Commons and smoothed relations between his touchy brother and the chief minister. The fact that Newcastle quickly became the third most powerful man in the administration no doubt helped Pelham's career, for he was sworn of the privy council on 1 June 1725. Pelham supported Walpole's unpopular plan to reform the excise system in 1733 but voted in 1737, in opposition to his mentor, for a scheme to reduce the rate of interest on the national debt, a goal Pelham would later achieve himself.<h2>
<a name="Marriageandfamily"></a>Marriage and family</h2>On 29 October 1726 Pelham married Lady Katharine Manners (1700/01&#150;1780) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68373/', "Pelham, Lady Katharine")</script>], daughter of John Manners, second duke of Rutland, and his wife, Catherine Russell. Newcastle marked the event with a gift of land in Sussex worth &pound;800 a year and sold him some property worth &pound;500 a year, giving him an annual income of &pound;2800 plus his salary from office. The marriage portion was &pound;10,000. The couple had two sons, who, to their parents' great grief, died on 27 and 28 November 1739 of a throat infection, and six daughters, two of whom also died in childhood. Illness in a friend's family was a painful reminder to Pelham of the loss of his boys and of his daughter Lucy little more than two months later: &#145;These incidents renew too much in me, what I ought and endeavor to forgett but I find I never shall&#146;  (Pelham to Newcastle, 1 July 1740, BL, Add. MS 33441, fol. 4). The eldest daughter, Catherine, her childless uncle's favourite, in 1744 married her first cousin Henry Clinton, ninth earl of Lincoln, who was made Newcastle's heir. Pelham was devoted to his wife and family and favoured spending his free time in privacy with them. In 1729 he purchased Esher Place, Surrey, close by his brother's estate at Claremont, and employed William Kent to renovate the house and gardens as a country retreat for his family. When Pelham was appointed paymaster-general on 8 May 1730, he found his official residence in Whitehall deficient and had it rebuilt, his first promotion of public architecture. In 1740 he bought a house in Arlington Street, London, which he had razed, and engaged Kent to design a fine Palladian structure, now no. 22. The family moved in on 25 May 1743. On Lady Katharine's appointment as ranger of Greenwich Park in 1745, Pelham arranged an expensive major restoration of the official residence, the Queen's House designed by Inigo Jones.<h2>
<a name="Accessiontopower"></a>Accession to power</h2>Throughout the 1730s, both as Newcastle's brother and as Walpole's confidant, Pelham was privy to policy discussions of the inner cabinet, yet he was not in the public eye. This dual privity became a vice as Newcastle's ambition and differences with Walpole over policy towards Spain grew. Pelham, assisted by their close friend the lord chancellor, Philip Yorke, earl of Hardwicke, had to conciliate between the two and even softened the language of Newcastle's official letters to Spain to conform with Walpole's view. The grateful Newcastle said: &#145;My Brother has all the prudence, knowledge, experience, and good intention, that I can wish or hope in a man&#146;  (Coxe, 1.40). In the face of a public inflamed by accounts of Spanish depredations on British trade and sailors, Pelham helped Walpole to win passage of the convention of the Pardo on 8 March 1739. Spain's failure to meet the agreed terms forced the reluctant Walpole to accept the need for war. Pelham continued his role of peacemaker as the ministers quarrelled over the conduct of the war, which Walpole called Newcastle's. When the expected quick victory failed to occur, the opposition, who had demanded war, began to mount damaging attacks on the chief minister in the Commons. On 13 February 1741 Pelham strongly opposed a motion for Walpole's removal, and, after Sir Robert was forced to resign, defended him in debate on 9 March 1742 over a motion for a committee of inquiry. Although he distrusted Newcastle, Walpole wanted Pelham to succeed him as chief minister. Even while he was Walpole's deputy, Pelham's affability and good character had gained him friends, and yet, despite Walpole's encouragement, he chose not to become chancellor of the exchequer in the new administration. However, in July 1742 he did become leader of the House of Commons. Pelham was a conciliator able to persuade discordant politicians to work together, his subtlety disguising his strength. When a death created vacancies in 1743, Pelham on 25 August became first lord of the Treasury and on 12 December chancellor. Walpole, now earl of Orford, congratulated him, saying:<blockquote>I do not load you with personal assurances; but I never knew a time when I thought it more incumbent upon me to exert myself in support of the government; and I rejoice, for your sake and my own, that affairs are put into your hands, where my private friendship, and my political opinion unite, in engaging me to do all I can, and call upon me to act in character. (Coxe, 1.92)</blockquote>With power came great responsibility, for, in addition to the war with Spain, Britain was funding Austria's defence against Prussia and France, on which Britain declared war on 29 March 1744. Holding all the offices formerly Walpole's, and supported by Newcastle and Hardwicke, Pelham was chief minister in theory but not in fact: he lacked the approval of George II, who still favoured the German-speaking northern secretary, Carteret. The public and many members of the Commons, however, perceived a bias in Carteret towards Hanover over England, and disliked him accordingly, giving the Pelhams a lever to force his dismissal on 24 November 1744. The king was angry and unreconciled, rejecting men suggested for appointment and complaining &#145;he had been forced to part with those he liked&#146;  (Owen, 244). To counter the continuing influence at court of Carteret (now Earl Granville), Pelham had to strengthen his position in the Commons, where he did not yet have mastery over the newer members of his coalition. When the tory opposition in February 1745 demanded an inquiry into a failed naval operation, they were joined by some of the new allies Pelham had managed to place on the Admiralty board, who wanted to expose their predecessors as incompetent. Despite Pelham's efforts to keep the inquiry non-partisan, members chose for political reasons to support one or the other of the two admirals involved, Thomas Mathews and Richard Lestock. In order not to offend the king further, Pelham was forced to speak in support of Mathews, who was being attacked by his young allies.<h2>
<a name="TheJacobiterisingof1745"></a>The Jacobite rising of 1745</h2>Pelham had little time to conciliate the king before the outbreak, on 25 July 1745, of the Jacobite rising. Although the secretaries of state had direction of policy in Scotland, the first lord of the Treasury controlled the subordinate revenue boards there and thus had considerable influence through patronage. Walpole had worked through the Scottish magnate Archibald Campbell, Lord Ilay, who became third duke of Argyll in 1743. Argyll's rival John Hay, fourth marquess of Tweeddale, a supporter of Granville, was appointed secretary of state for Scotland following Walpole's fall in 1742. After the cabinet had taken protective measures when rumours of invasion first circulated in 1743, Pelham in 1744 suggested arming Scottish loyalists and raising additional Highland regiments, but nothing was done by Tweeddale. Little more was heard until the regency board received warning of a possible French invasion in July 1745. Even after the landing of the Pretender became known, the public and Tweeddale dismissed the danger. Pelham said:<blockquote>I am not so apprehensive of the strength or zeal of the enemy, as I am fearful of the inability or languidness, of our friends &hellip; you would scarce, in common conversation, meet with one man who thinks there is any danger from, scarce truth in an invasion, at this time. (Coxe, 1.258)</blockquote>With most of the British forces engaged on the continent, Pelham in alarm asked George II to return from Hanover but, because of on-going cool relations between king and first minister, gained no support. &#145;The conduct of a certain person is worse than ever. To speak of personal treatment is idle at this time, but we are not permitted either to give our advice or to act in consequence of any advice that is given&#146;, Pelham told a friend in September  (Owen, 280). Granville and his allies told George II that the rebels could be crushed easily by the forces to hand and that Britain should maintain her European commitment. Despite the opposition of Tweeddale, the Pelhams finally convinced the king to recall his son, the duke of Cumberland, and ten battalions from the continent. The rebel success at Prestonpans on 21 September proved Tweeddale's incompetence, and he resigned in January 1746. Even before, Newcastle had begun organizing internal defences and naval operations to contain the rising. Pelham's correspondence makes clear how closely he studied the progress of the invasion and highland uprising. By the end of the year Cumberland's forces had regained the initiative and they finally destroyed the rebel army at the battle of Culloden on 16 April 1746. Scotland had specific rights under the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> and could not be crushed, as Cumberland advocated. Pelham wanted to pacify Scotland and ensure its loyalty to the crown, but by moderate measures that would preserve the stability of his administration. Lord Hardwicke drafted bills that reflected public opinion and worked out final forms with Pelham and Newcastle. The act of attainder signed in June 1746 listed men declared guilty of treason, whose property could be confiscated, but only three peers were executed. The <span class="roman">Disarming Act</span> signed in August, which imposed fines for carrying or concealing arms, was difficult to enforce, and a ban on traditional highland dress was evaded or ignored. To ensure passage of such bills, Pelham had to negotiate Argyll's assistance while reaching out to his rival Scottish lords. To Pelham, the most important measure was the <span class="roman">Heritable Jurisdictions Act</span> of 1747, which extended uniform royal jurisdiction throughout Scotland and so strengthened control by central government. Scottish lords who by tradition had inherited regalities were bought out, and their jurisdictions were returned to the crown. Pelham in consequence could influence the appointment of the most important officials in Scottish local government, the sheriff-deputes. By accepting recommendations for these posts from a number of Scottish lords, Pelham gained greater support for his pacification bills while preserving good relations with Argyll.<h2>
<a name="Chiefminister"></a>Chief minister</h2>Hard pressed to finance and conduct war on so many fronts, Pelham learned early in 1746 that George II wanted a new ministry headed by Granville, who still influenced the king's thinking on foreign policy. In consequence, Pelham, together with most of his administration, resigned on 11 February. Faced with a minority in parliament and the withdrawal of promised financial support for the government, George II was forced to recall Pelham and his colleagues within three days. Pelham could now turn to placating the king and strengthening his political position. Determined not to repeat Walpole's error of creating opposition by exclusion, Pelham had, after Granville's resignation, brought into his administration dissident whigs who had criticized the conduct of the war, such as the Bedford and Cobham factions, and thus gained some good speakers to support his proposals in the Commons. As a result some excellent political writers attached to these factions, Henry Fielding in particular, began to support the administration. When Pelham returned to office after his own resignation he brought in more new men&#151;even the king's <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i>, William Pitt&#151;to create a truly broad-bottom administration.<br>
<br>The only remaining serious opposition was the Leicester House faction headed by Frederick, prince of Wales. As early as 1737 Frederick had begun to gather a party loyal to him which was based on appointments to his household. These men, some of them peers, had votes in parliament and formed a shadow administration waiting to take office at what many thought to be the king's imminent death. Frederick allied himself with the Cobham and Bedford factions opposing Walpole but gave general support to the new administration after 1742. Late in 1746 he went back into opposition and began to create more salaried positions at his court in order to expand his party. The prince's substantial personal income made him the Pelhams' most dangerous opponent. Moreover, Frederick reached out to the tory country gentlemen in the Commons, men who had been marginalized by George II's distrust of them. Frederick and his friends challenged Pelham's control over elections by supporting their own candidates. To catch them off guard, Pelham called a snap general election on 20 June 1747 which brought him an increased majority. The resulting political calm and smooth passage of legislation contributed heavily to the recovery of royal favour. Pelham left little to chance in the Commons, working out in advance the order in which legislation would be introduced in each session and selecting the speakers to support particular measures, always working to eliminate opportunities for opposition.<h2>
<a name="Conductofforeignaffairs"></a>Conduct of foreign affairs</h2>Under the departmental form of government then used, formulation of foreign policy was the province of the secretaries of state. The monarch was arbiter of policy, and George II kept a close control over the army and relations with European states. When the king insisted on going to Hanover in 1743, a regency board made up of his ministers ran the government in London. Pelham became a member when he was appointed head of the Treasury and in consequence read most documents concerning foreign affairs. When Granville presented the treaty of Worms to the regency board, Pelham objected to the subsidies included and, with his allies, was able to reject it. While Granville had the king's ear over what part Britain should play in the War of the Austrian Succession, Pelham's influence was limited to supporting Newcastle's views and to the passage in the Commons of bills to pay troops and provide subsidies for allies. Defending measures over which he had no control was, as he told Newcastle, especially difficult in regard to the large subsidies: &#145;The Allys will take it [every sum of money we advance], and then act, as suits their own convenience and security best&#146;  (Owen, 227). Once Granville was finally ousted and Pelham had begun to win the king's confidence, he was able to exert more influence on foreign policy, but still primarily through his control of the Commons and government finance. His office determined his viewpoint. Each year he had to find the resources to pay for war, noting that &#145;when I came into the Treasury I found a vast arrear and the expenses have increased, and the revenue diminished ever since&#146;  (Wilkes, 105). Pelham corresponded with British diplomats and was well informed on the status of relations with other governments. When George II visited Hanover in 1748, 1750, and 1752, Pelham led the regency board and sent advice to Newcastle, who accompanied the king. When Pelham was out of London, Newcastle often sent him copies of diplomatic papers, although Pelham admitted difficulty with documents in French, &#145;which language I understand very imperfectly&#146;  (Coxe, 2.491). Since he also said &#145;I don't speak French&#146;, his ability to converse with foreign ambassadors must have been limited, although he did report meeting with several while Newcastle was at Hanover in 1750  (ibid., 1.168). As leader of the Commons, Pelham knew by 1746 that the public wanted an end to an expensive and unprofitable war. As head of the Treasury he was equally keen to end the financial drain on the country. As chief minister he wanted &#145;a good Peace&#146;, honourable and on terms acceptable to parliament: &#145;For God sake don't let us neglect the first opportunity that offers itself for that purpose&#146;  (Pelham to Hardwicke, 22 April 1748, BL, Add. MS 35423, fol. 28). Newcastle's rapid conversion to the king's strategy of deferring peace until more bargaining chips could be won put him at odds with Pelham, who believed further warfare would yield no better peace terms. When France's desire for secret negotiations was rumoured in 1746, Pelham urged Newcastle to make contact, although it proved futile. From that time Pelham also supported measures to induce Frederick II to press France to negotiate, even though he knew George II distrusted his Prussian nephew. Pelham was outspoken, telling the Commons on 9 February 1748: &#145;it is my opinion that we ought to make peace but I have reason to believe that certain influences will prevail against my opinion&#146;  (copy of speech in Le Man to Huescar, 13 Feb 1748, BL, Add. MS 32811, fol. 155). Newcastle was certain a final blow could be launched against France with Dutch aid. Pelham believed the British envoy Lord Sandwich had misled Newcastle into thinking<blockquote>that Holland would bring such an Army into the field as would turn the ballance in our favor when he must know, if he knew anything at all, that they were no government, that they were a bankrupt people and could not pay the very small sums they owe to us for our advanced payments to them. (Pelham to Hardwicke, 25 Sept 1748, BL, Add. MS 35423, fol. 64)</blockquote>Dutch promises went unfulfilled, and Newcastle agreed to peace negotiations that led to the signing of a preliminary treaty in April 1748. Pelham told him:<blockquote>Peace is what I want, both for the sake of my king, my country, and myself. Peace will be had. I heartily wish it may be no worse, than what is represented in your paper. If so, I am sure it is to be defended; but if not so, it must be defended, and shall be, by me at least, if I have the honour to serve the king, at the time of trial. (Coxe, 1.415)</blockquote>The final terms, as Pelham predicted, proved no better than what might have been obtained in 1746. <h2>
<a name="RelationswithNewcastle"></a>Relations with Newcastle</h2>Britain was finally freed from the burden of war by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, signed on 18 October 1748, but relations between the Pelham brothers had soured while Newcastle, now northern secretary, spent the summer with the king in Hanover. Newcastle had from the beginning been uncomfortable about his brother's power and, as early as 1743, had told Hardwicke:<blockquote>I do apprehend that my brother does think that his superior interest in the Closet, and situation in the House of Commons, gives him great advantage over everybody else. They are indeed great advantages, but may be counter-balanced, especially if it is considered over <i>whom</i> those advantages are given. (Owen, 319)</blockquote>After more disagreements in January 1745, Newcastle suggested a method of power-sharing:<blockquote>that every thing, as far as possible, should be first talked over by you and me, before it is either flung out in the closet, or communicated to <i>any</i> of our brethren; I always except the chancellor, who, I know, is a third brother; that we shall have no reserve, either <i>public</i> or <i>private</i> with each other; and, that in our transactions with the other ministers, and other persons, who may be negotiated with, we should always let it be understood, that we speak in the name of both, or in the name of neither. This conduct, once established, will grow easy and natural, and effectually prevent any jealousies, on one side, or disagreeable warmth, occasioned by them, on the other. In order to make this practicable, I will call every morning, as regularly at your house, as I once did at Sir Robert's. There the scheme of the day shall be settled, to be handed out to others afterwards, as shall be necessary; and a frequent intercourse with ease, at each other's houses, and at all hours and times, will also make this very easy to us. (Coxe, 1.206)</blockquote>Pelham willingly agreed. Yet, far away from London in 1748, the duke fell prey to his streak of jealousy and paranoia, in his letters accusing Pelham of imagined slights, a problem that would recur during later trips to Hanover. Ill and irritated by his brother's petulance, Pelham told Hardwicke:<blockquote>I must declare to your Lordship with all the coolness imaginable, it is not in my will, it is not in my power to undertake another sessions of Parliament upon the foot of expence we are now going into, and that only to preserve a bigotted notion of Old Systems and the House of Austria. (21 Aug 1748, BL, Add. MS 35423, fol. 54)</blockquote>Newcastle was shaken and subdued upon learning that Pelham, whom he sincerely loved, had suffered a painful and debilitating attack of shingles in late August. The brothers' other occasional quarrels were over money, one cause being Newcastle's dismal personal finances. A settlement, made in 1741 after some acrimony, protected the rights of Pelham and his family as Newcastle's heirs. When the marriage in 1744 of Pelham's daughter Katherine to the earl of Lincoln necessitated new arrangements, Newcastle became enraged at the restrictions his brother demanded. Aside from his concerns for his daughters' rights, Pelham worried about how Newcastle's great debts might damage his public reputation and political credit. He warned his brother what a blow his loss of office would be because Newcastle's salary was an important part of his income. Because of their differences, the brothers did, on a few occasions, stop speaking to each other until Hardwicke interceded to heal the rift. Pelham usually made the first overture, perhaps because he was emotionally the stronger, and told his brother:<blockquote>We cannot change our natures nor add to our understanding; we must therefore be satisfied with each other and convinc'd that if we do differ, it is what we can't avoid, and endeavour that those differences shall have as little effect upon the Publick and be as little known as possible. (Pelham to Newcastle, 7 Sept 1750, BL, Add. MS 35411, fol. 122)</blockquote>In national finance, Pelham intended to reduce government spending after the war, which would please the tax-paying landowners who made up his majority in the Commons and induce them to support his plan to reduce the interest on the national debt. Consequently, Pelham objected to Newcastle's promotion of subsidies in peacetime to cement foreign alliances for Britain, but could be persuaded to agree when he saw definite benefits would result. Hardwicke had his own view:<blockquote>When a Subsidiary Measure has been proposed which he has not been inclin'd to, &amp; resolv'd not to yield to at first, or without difficulty, I have more than once known him to take up another Subsidiary Measure of much greater Extent &amp; Expence, which has been talk'd of before, in order to shew the small importence &amp; value of the one, &amp; the preferableness of the other, tho' <i>that other</i> may not have been practicable. (Hardwicke to Newcastle, 28 July 1751, BL, Add. MS 32724, fol. 490)</blockquote>Pelham reluctantly agreed to support Newcastle's plan to elect an heir to the throne of the Holy Roman empire, which involved paying large subsidies to German electors. Pelham presented the Bavarian subsidy to the committee of supply on 22 February 1751, saying that the election scheme was essential to hold France in check and to preserve the balance of power in Europe. At the time Pelham promised that no more subsidies were needed, and he quarrelled with his brother when Newcastle soon afterwards requested one for the elector of Saxony. Pelham was so angry that colleagues had to persuade him that a public rupture with his brother would destroy their party. Pelham finally agreed and presented the subsidy on 22 January 1752. Opposition was strong, but Pelham answered these objections &#145;finely, seriously, and pathetically; a manner in which he particularly shone&#146;  (Walpole, 1.167).<br>
<br>Pelham was also troubled by Newcastle's desire to monopolize the handling of foreign relations. In a letter to Pelham the duke claimed that the southern secretary, John Russell, fourth duke of Bedford, &#145;has just parts &amp; understanding enough to confound you &amp; business, and not to comprehend enough to forward either, tho he was never so well disposed to it&#146;  (Newcastle to Pelham, 2/13 Sept 1750, BL, Add. MS 35411, fol. 105). Pelham reminded him that:<blockquote>I have promised the king, and I will keep my word, that I would never enter into any cabal again, to prevent his Majesty from either removing, or bringing into his service, any person he had either a prejudice to, or a predilection for (Coxe, 2.389)</blockquote>Even though Pelham was convinced Bedford neglected his duties, he did not want him replaced by someone completely subservient to Newcastle or by a member of parliament who might challenge Pelham's authority there. Moreover, Pelham did not want to lose the support of Bedford's friends in the Commons. Nevertheless, in June 1751 Pelham did finally assist Newcastle in gaining the king's consent to their manoeuvring Bedford into resignation. George II himself concluded that Bedford's slack work habits were not giving him value for his money and decided that he could also do without the services of his first lord of the Admiralty, Bedford's friend John Montagu, fourth earl of Sandwich, whom the king had always disliked. George II expected hard work and a suitable degree of deference from his ministers and never forgot which men, Bedford and Sandwich included, had denigrated the Hanoverian connection. Sandwich's dismissal forced Bedford to resign to protest. At the king's suggestion Robert Darcy, fourth earl of Holdernesse, an unambitious diplomat, replaced Bedford. Hardwicke's son-in-law George, Baron Anson, an admiral and member of the Admiralty board, was promoted to first lord. To please the king further, Granville was appointed president of the privy council, even though Pelham still distrusted the earl and doubted Newcastle's assurances that Granville was a changed man.<h2>
<a name="Achievementsinoffice"></a>Achievements in office</h2>With the war ended, Pelham could implement some long-considered financial plans. In 1749 he approved designs for the rebuilding of the Horse Guards, Whitehall, which would also provide accommodation for the secretary at war and other officials. On 20 December 1749 parliament enacted his plan to consolidate the national debt and reduce the rate of interest from 4 to 3 per cent by 1755. Pelham needed all his skills of persuasion to overcome the opposition of the great financial corporations to this plan. New Bank of England annuities at 3 per cent interest were offered for sale, while the rate on old debts was gradually reduced from 4 to 3 per cent and debts held by the East India and South Sea companies were transferred to the bank. The goal of the scheme was to convert all of the public debt into the new or consolidated bank annuities. The most threatening focus of political opposition to the administration was removed by the death of the king's unloved son Frederick, prince of Wales, on 20 March 1751. Just the year before, when the king fell seriously ill, Pelham had worried about the strength of this Leicester House organization and told Newcastle that the Commons &#145;is a great unwieldy body, and requires great Art and some Cordials to keep it loyal &hellip; [the Prince] has as much to give in present as we have and more in Reversion. This makes my task an hard one&#146;  (Newman, 75). The death of Frederick dispersed his party and eased Pelham's task immeasurably. Soon after, Pelham had<blockquote>an opportunity of talking thoroughly to the King, which I have done without reserve; he now knows upon what terms I can be his servant, and of <i>use</i> to him. Time must shew whether that is practicable or not &hellip; I am glad to be certain of the ground I stand upon. (Pelham to Henry Fox, 3 April 1751, BL, Add. MS 51379, fol. 93)</blockquote>Pelham enhanced his position by reducing the king's spending on patronage and accomplishing another goal which: &#145;I have for some time despaired of, bringing his civil list finances into any order&#146;  (Pelham to Newcastle, 22 June 1750, BL, Add. MS 32721, fol. 144).<br>
<br>Soon after Frederick's death a message from the king to both houses of parliament proposed that his widow, Princess Augusta, be made regent if the king died before her eldest son came of age. This proposal, drawn up by the Pelhams and Hardwicke, angered the duke of Cumberland and his supporters because they felt he should be regent. When the Commons went into committee on the bill on 16 May, Pelham took the chair, a role he rarely filled because it barred him from taking part in the debate. He may have hoped thus to avoid further offending Cumberland or the new Leicester House faction, or he simply did not expect the heated opposition the bill provoked. Pelham's able lieutenants William Murray and Henry Fox spoke for the administration in the unexpectedly long and contentious debate, although Fox put some of his effort into defending Cumberland. Speaking for approval of the final bill, Pelham said that &#145;he was persuaded nobody would suspect him of any prospect of power for himself from this bill, as he should be too great a wretch to build views of grandeur on what he must regard as the greatest misfortune&#146;  (Walpole, 1.102).<br>
<br>Political stability was Pelham's goal in all his policies, yet one of his highland pacification bills came under fierce attack in March 1752 by the two disgruntled dukes&#151;Bedford, who hated the Pelhams, and Cumberland, who hated the Scots. A bill to annex to the crown some of the highland estates forfeited for treason had been produced after years of negotiation between Pelham, Hardwicke, Argyll, and other Scottish lords. Cumberland and Bedford claimed the bill rewarded the Scots for rebellion but could not stop its passage. Cumberland then accused Argyll of protecting Jacobites holding government office in Scotland, a charge Bedford repeated in the Lords while calling for an inquiry. The king was persuaded by his son to demand that Pelham investigate. Within a few months Pelham was able to gather sufficient evidence to exonerate Argyll and, by association, himself. In his report to the king Pelham said:<blockquote>Who can be responsible that no Jacobite shall ever, by any means, creep into the numberous employments of the revenue? As there are many rival connections in Scotland, all equally contending for power, interest and solicitations, may upon particular occasions, draw in a loyal subject to recommend a person whose character is not well known or misrepresented to him. (Jewell, 21)</blockquote>At this same time, by chance, a genuine Jacobite plan, the Elibank plot, was being formed to seize George II and smuggle him out of the country. The Pelhams kept watch on the conspirators but also kept the plot a secret, probably because of the Argyll inquiry and possibly to prevent panic in the stock market, which would damage Pelham's reorganization of public finance.<br>
<br>Despite the competition for power at the highest level of politics, the peace and prosperity of the period allowed the Commons led by Pelham to give more time and thought to bills promoting public welfare, such as reform of poor laws, suppression of crime, construction of roads, and regulation of trade, all of which would contribute to social and hence political stability. Here Pelham's ability to gain co-operation from diverse groups was an important factor. While he and his lieutenants provided leadership and speeches to get bills through the Commons, much of the committee work on proposed legislation, the gathering of data, and the drafting of bills was done by back-bench members who held no office, and who included tories and independents as well as whigs. These men were more attuned to their constituents than to the court and could bring to Pelham's attention the needs and desires of the public. The felonies committee in 1751 investigated complaints that excessive consumption of gin was making workers idle and encouraging crime and as a remedy quickly produced the <span class="roman">Gin Act</span> regulating sale. When an epidemic of cattle distemper affected the whole country in the 1740s, the Commons supported privy council measures to contain the disease, even though they infringed property rights. After examining procedures for quarantining ships the Commons asked the king's ministers to find better means of keeping infectious disease out of the country and received a bill, enacted in 1753, that incorporated the members' suggestions. An adequate and wholesome supply of bread being essential to public order, the Commons in June 1749 passed a bill revising standards for the size and quality of bakers' loaves. A far more contentious aspect of the grain trade aroused debate and petitions to parliament after a nephew of Pelham, Charles Townshend, third Viscount Townshend, in 1751 published a pamphlet in which he urged abolition of the government bounty paid on grain exports. While popular with producers, the bounty was indeed a drain on the Treasury because exports had been exceptionally large since 1748. The issue caused so much worry and unrest among growers that Pelham, his health already failing, was forced to promise his Sussex constituents that the bounty would be retained. At a meeting held on 29 August 1753 to endorse his candidacy, Pelham said:<blockquote>as trade and particularly the corn trade is the chiefe concern of the County of Sussex, it shall be my constant care to encourage and support the same by encouraging our farmers in their agriculture and extending our commerce abroad[;] we have no reason to fear being what we ever have been, a rich and powerful people. (Connors, 275)</blockquote>George II valued tranquillity in his subjects and any minister who could maintain it. &#145;Quiet&#146;, wrote Pelham, &#145;is what he loves better than all of us put together&#146;  (Coxe, 2.366). Three acts of parliament supported by Pelham did disturb both the public and the politicians, even though they effected necessary reforms. The <span class="roman">Calendar Reform Act</span> of 1752, which switched Britain to the Gregorian calendar used on the continent, caused some confusion and consternation. Hardwicke's <span class="roman">Marriage Act</span> of 1753, which prohibited clandestine and runaway marriages, divided the ministry and produced a vigorous pamphlet war between supporters and critics, who feared the elevation of the civil legislature over canon law and the granting of parental powers of veto for unattractive marriage proposals. The <span class="roman">Jewish Naturalization Act</span> of 1753 allowed Jews to take the oaths of supremacy and allegiance without using the word Christian. Pelham secured passage of the act because he thought it just and fair, but it may also have been in response to the Jewish community's help with the restructuring of the national debt. Replying on 7 May 1753 to expressions of the antisemitism common at that time, Pelham said, &#145;Surely, Sir, I am not to look upon every man as my enemy who differs from me in opinion upon any point of religion. This would be a most unchristian way of thinking&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 14.1414). Soon fierce public opposition was whipped up by propaganda misrepresenting the terms of the act, and by autumn Pelham began to fear that the controversy would affect the general election scheduled for April 1754. He therefore arranged repeal of the bill in December.<br>
<br>Hampered by his failing health and distracted by the uproar over the <span class="roman">Naturalization Act</span>, Pelham had to make time to deal with a gesture towards independence by the nominally subservient Irish parliament. The balance of domestic Irish politics had been disrupted by the intervention of the Anglican archbishop George Stone, whose faction was opposed by that of the speaker of the Irish Commons, Henry Boyle. The ensuing disruptions in the parliament caused Newcastle, who was responsible for the political administration of Ireland, to doubt the ability of the lord lieutenant, Lionel Sackville, first duke of Dorset, to govern. After more than a year of conflict over how surplus money should be used, the Irish parliament in June 1753 petitioned the king to restore its right to dispose of that money as it wished. This was rejected as a threat to English supremacy, a move that provoked more turmoil in Dublin. When the Irish Commons in late December 1753 again presented its case, Pelham set the cabinet policy of completely rejecting Irish demands. He spent the next few months, the last of his life, preparing for the election.<h2>
<a name="Death"></a>Death</h2>Pelham died at his London house at about 6 a.m. on 6 March 1754. The previous July he had drunk the waters at Scarborough to treat a skin disorder. He fell ill about 15 December with fever, nausea, and skin eruptions that spread down his torso. His doctor drained a swelling then and another that developed in February. The few surviving descriptions of his symptoms are inadequate to suggest a diagnosis. Pelham returned to work on 7 January, telling Newcastle &#145;I am now, thank God, as well as ever I was in my life&#146;  (Coxe, 2.495), but he collapsed again with fever and skin eruptions on 3 March. He was buried in the family vault at Laughton, Sussex. After his death his brother was so overcome by grief that he secluded himself for several days. A contemporary said of Pelham:<blockquote>His abilities, integrity and candour gave him such confidence and trust as to enable him, by a proper and dexterous management of these qualities, to keep persons together and to give more Public quiet than I fear we shall see again for some time (J. Fowle to Henry Etough, 16 March 1754, BL, Add. MS 9201, fol. 103)</blockquote>The tory Tobias Smollett wrote that Pelham's death was regretted by the nation &#145;to whose affection he had powerfully recommended himself by the candour and humanity of his conduct and character&#146;  (Wilkes, 214).<br>
<br>Pelham never used his offices for personal enrichment and never spared time to improve his estates, which brought in about &pound;3000 a year at the time of his death. He owned his town house and country estate unencumbered. His total annual salary from both his offices was &pound;11,600. He did try to put his affairs in order by drawing up a new will that took account of the marriage of his daughter Grace in 1752. On 25 November 1753 he wrote William Murray, Lord Mansfield, a letter containing the provisions, but he died before the final copy was ready, leaving a will dated 1748 with a codicil dated 1751. His executors found just under &pound;10,500 in his account at Hoare's Bank, which was used to pay off a mortgage. The &pound;10,000 marriage portion Pelham had agreed to in 1752 remained unpaid at his death. His personal estate was estimated at slightly over &pound;15,000 and his debts and legacies at about &pound;22,745, which forced his executors to sell land. Pelham profited from his long service to the crown little more than did his brother.<br>
<br>Portraits of Pelham in his chancellor's gown painted by William Hoare and John Shackleton about 1750 reveal his double chin and ample waistline but little of his character in the rather bland face shown. A more close-up portrait in plain dress, possibly by John Giles Eccardt, suggests strength and shrewdness, with a knowing look to the grey-blue eyes. When foreign relations were the predominant study of historians, Pelham seemed overshadowed by his brother Newcastle. His reputation as a statesman has risen, however, as economic historians have made clear that Britain's international power was built on the national system of finance. His restructuring of the national debt was Pelham's legacy to Britain and crucial to victory in the Seven Years' War. The stable government he provided during the brief mid-century peace inspired the renewed confidence the country needed after the uncertainties of the 1740s.<br>
