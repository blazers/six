<span class="headword">Young, Sir  William</span>, second baronet  (1749&#150;1815), <span class="occ">colonial governor and politician</span>, born at Charlton in Kent in December 1749, was the eldest son of Sir William Young, first baronet (1724/5&#150;1788), governor of Dominica, and his second wife, Elizabeth (1729&#150;1801), the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27019/', "Brook Taylor")</script>. In 1767 he was entered at Clare College, Cambridge, but, some difference arising, he was removed and matriculated from University College, Oxford, on 26 November 1768. He later travelled in France, Italy, and Sicily and published an account of part of his travels. He gained some fame for a work he published in 1777 entitled <span class="italic">The spirit of Athens, being a political and philosophical investigation of the history of that republic</span>. On 12 August that year, at St George the Martyr, Queen's Square, London, he married Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1791), the daughter and coheir of Charles Lawrence and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mihil. They had four sons and two daughters. Young married, secondly, on 22 April 1793 at St George, Hanover Square, London, Barbara (<i>d</i>. 1830), the daughter of Colonel Richard Talbot and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> O'Reilly, later <i>suo jure</i> Baroness Talbot of Malahide.<br>
<br>In 1782 Young was deputed by the proprietors of the colony of Tobago to negotiate their interests in the French court after the preliminaries of peace with France and the United States had been agreed. Two years later he was returned to parliament for St Mawes, Cornwall. He retained this seat until 1806, when he was returned for the town of Buckingham. He was a follower of William Pitt until 1801, when he joined the ranks of his patron, Lord Grenville. Young was a frequent speaker in the House of Commons on a variety of topics, including poor-law reform, income tax, military affairs, the slave trade, union with Ireland, foreign and colonial policy, and parliamentary reform. In 1786 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and in 1791 a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He was secretary to the Association for Promoting the Discovery of the Interior Parts of Africa. In 1807 he was appointed governor of Tobago, a post which he retained until his death in January 1815.<br>
<br>At the death of his father in 1788 Young inherited four sugar plantations&#151;one in Antigua, two in St Vincent, and one in Tobago&#151;and a total of 896 African slaves. He also inherited his father's debts, amounting to approximately &pound;110,000. On 30 October 1791 he embarked on a voyage to the West Indies which he later wrote about under the title <span class="italic">A tour through the several islands of Barbadoes, St Vincent, Tobago, and Grenada, in the years 1791 and 1792</span>. It was first published in 1801 as an appendix to the second edition of <span class="italic">An Historical Survey of the Island of Saint Domingo</span> by Bryan Edwards, the whole work being edited by Young. He undertook this tour to save his plantations from bankruptcy, which he eventually failed to do, and to gain information about slavery and the sugar industry of the West Indies which would support his agenda in parliament to gain votes for an alternative to the campaign led by William Wilberforce and his allies, who worked persistently and with widespread public support for abolition of the slave trade. On his tour of the islands Young said he was greeted wholeheartedly by his slaves, and he reciprocated by granting them extra holidays and gifts of herrings and rum, holding balls in the great house, and at Christmas feasting, drinking, dancing, and exchanging gifts. He was pleased that he discovered little evidence of harsh treatment of his and other planters' slaves. In all of the islands he visited he was observant of the methods of feeding, housing, clothing, disciplining, providing medical care, and religious instruction of the slaves.<br>
<br>After returning to his seat in parliament Young drew upon his recent experience in the West Indies to argue that, by ameliorating the condition of the slaves, their numbers would increase by natural propagation and, in time, the trade from Africa to the islands would die a natural death without intervention by act of parliament. However, Young's reform plans were na&iuml;ve and utopian, and Wilberforce and his allies finally succeeded in getting the necessary votes to abolish the British transatlantic slave trade.<br>
<br>Young was the author of works on a variety of subjects, including <span class="italic">The rights of Englishmen, or, The British constitution of government compared with that of a democratic republic</span> (1793); <span class="italic">The West Indian Commonplace Book</span> (1807); <span class="italic">Considerations on Poorhouses and Workhouses: their Pernicious Tendency</span> (1796); and <span class="italic">Instructions for the Armed Yeomanry</span> (1797). He died on 10 January 1815 at Government House, Tobago.<br>
