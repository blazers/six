<span class="headword">Pigot,  Elizabeth Bridget</span>  (1783&#150;1866), <span class="occ">friend and correspondent of Lord Byron</span>, was born on 20 September 1783 and baptized on 10 October 1783 in the parish of St Werburgh's, Derby, the daughter of John Hollis Pigot (<i>d</i>. 1794), physician, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1833), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Becher. She had two brothers, Captain R. H. H. Pigot, who fought at the battle of the Nile, and Dr John Pigot, a friend and correspondent of Byron whose manuscript account of his recollections of Byron, used by Thomas Moore in preparing his life of the poet, is now at Newstead Abbey. Miss Pigot lived at Southwell, Nottinghamshire, with which place her mother's family was connected, for nearly all her life. She was educated at home and possibly at a school for girls in Southwell.<br>
<br>In 1804 the sixteen-year-old Byron arrived in Southwell with his mother and lived at Burgage Manor, opposite Mrs Pigot's house on Burgage Green. Following his death in 1824 Elizabeth Pigot recalled her friendship with Byron for Thomas Moore, then gathering materials for his life of the poet. She described Byron as &#145;a fat, bashful boy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Lord Byron</span>, ed. Moore, 1.99) whom, in their first meetings, she would accompany on the piano while he sang. &#145;I sing much better to your playing than to anyone else's&#146;, he confided to her. &#145;That is&#146;, she answered, &#145;because I play to your singing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Lord Byron</span>, ed. Coleridge and Prothero, 5.295&#150;6). Her accommodating (yet witty) reply conveys the essence of their friendship. The following year Byron left for Trinity College, Cambridge, but returned to Southwell from time to time until 1807, and regularly corresponded with Elizabeth Pigot until 1811. Jerome McGann, editor of <span class="italic">The Complete Works of Byron</span>, notes that &#145;Elizabeth Pigot made fair copies of all the poems Byron printed when he was at Southwell&#146;, and he drew on these and on her notes in his edition  (<span class="italic">Complete Poetical Works</span>, ed. McGann, 1.368). These fair copies were sent to the Newark bookseller John Ridge and were first published in Byron's <span class="italic">Fugitive Pieces</span> (1806), <span class="italic">Hours of Idleness</span> (1807), <span class="italic">Poems on Various Occasions</span> (1807), and <span class="italic">Poems Original and Translated</span> (1808). Manuscript copies of these poems, annotated by Elizabeth Pigot, are now in Newstead Abbey collections.<br>
<br>Five years older than him, outwardly Miss Pigot avoided the pitfalls of romantic entanglement with Byron, a danger to which several of the &#145;Southwell belles&#146; fell victim. He addressed her affectionately in his letters as &#145;My dear Bridget&#146; and later as &#145;Dear Queen Bess&#146;, and she addressed him by several nicknames including Tristram Fickle (the lead character in J. T. Allingham's farce <span class="italic">The Weathercock</span> which formed one of the private theatricals in which Byron participated in Southwell). To her, Byron addressed his poem beginning &#145;Eliza, what fools are the Mussulman sect!&#146;&#151;about 1807 she had been engaged to a Captain Basil Hall (1788&#150;1844), then in India, but the engagement was broken off. Of other poems he wrote to Eliza, &#145;A Woman's Hair&#146; which he inscribed in her copy of Burns's works in 1806, &#145;As relics left of saints above&#146;, &#145;Your Motto is l'Amitie&#146;, and those addressed to &#145;M. S. G.&#146; (my sweet girl), celebrate their mutual interest in symbolic tokens of friendship (Byron entrusted to Elizabeth's care the cornelian heart he had been given by the Cambridge chorister John Edleston, the &#145;Thyrza&#146; of some early poems).<br>
<br>Elizabeth Pigot was a competent watercolour artist and herself a writer of amusing verse: in a small hand-sewn booklet she provided ten delightful illustrations to accompany her manuscript poem, dated &#145;26th March 1807&#146;, &#145;The Wonderful History of Lord Byron &amp; his Dog&#146;  (Ransom HRC). A pastiche of <span class="italic">The Wonderful Adventure of Old Mother Hubbard and her Dog</span> (of which an illustrated second edition was published in 1805), this playful poem is also similar to Byron's &#145;Parody upon &#147;The Little Grey Man&#148; in Lewis's <i>Tales of Wonder</i>&#146;. The worldly humour of both poems is one that Byron was later to develop in <span class="italic">Beppo</span> and further in <span class="italic">Don Juan</span> as well as in his celebrated letters, and is founded on a world-view that generated in both an impetus to write. The illustrations to her verse include several portraits of Byron, and show him playing at cricket, being preached to by his dog, Boatswain, and going &#145;into the bath to boil off his fat&#146;  (Ransom HRC). Elizabeth Pigot designed a bookplate for Byron, and her design of a &#145;B&#146; surmounted by a coronet embellishes each volume of Leslie Marchand's magisterial edition of <span class="italic">Byron's Letters and Journals</span> and his <span class="italic">Life of Byron</span> (3 vols., 1957), both published by John Murray. Her delicate execution of a miniature in watercolour of Byron's right eye (1807; priv. coll., Southwell), a form of painting that comprises an unusual subgenre of portraits in miniature that were, at that time, exchanged as intimate love tokens, suggests that Elizabeth's feelings for Byron were possibly more than those of a dispassionate friend. She kept locks of his hair (one, kept with her eye portrait, was formerly enclosed in a tiny circle of seed pearls, and another, carefully wrapped in a slip of paper inscribed by Elizabeth with the date it was cut from his head, and subsequently kept in a pearwood watch-case, is now at Newstead Abbey). After her death at her home, Greyfriars, Easthorpe, Southwell, on 11 December 1866, a packet of Byron's letters is said to have been buried with her, on 15 December, under the north-west tower of Southwell Minster. These memorials bear out the inscription which she added in 1854 inside the back cover of her manuscript booklet &#145;The Wonderful History of Lord Byron &amp; his Dog&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>Out upon Time!-<br>
</div>
<div>It forever will leave,<br>
</div>
<div>but enough of the past,<br>
</div>
<div>for the future to grieve.<br>
</div>
