<span class="headword">Payne,  Ralph</span>, Baron Lavington  (1739&#150;1807), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in the parish of St George, Basseterre, St Kitts, on 19 March 1739, the second and only surviving son of Ralph Payne (<i>d</i>. 1763), chief justice of that island, and his first wife, Alice, the daughter and heir of Francis Carlisle of Antigua. His father was descended from a wealthy St Kitts family which had originally come from Lavington in Wiltshire. After being educated in England at Christ's Hospital, Payne returned to his native island, where he was at once elected a member of the house of assembly and unanimously voted speaker.<br>
<br>In 1762 Payne was again in England, and he then made the grand tour of Europe. Like William Beckford he became a successful representative of the political and social prominence of the wealthy absentee West Indian planters in Britain. On 1 September 1767 he married, at St George's, Hanover Square, Frances Lambertine Christiana Charlotte Harriet Theresa (<i>d</i>. 1830), the daughter of Henry (sometimes called Frederick Maximillian), Baron Kolbel, of Saxony, a general in the service of the Holy Roman empire. She had arrived in England with the Princess Joseph Poniatowski, sister to the king of Poland, and was a friend of Queen Charlotte. Payne made useful contacts through his wife, but it was an unhappy marriage, for which he was blamed, not least in a satirical verse by Sheridan. Finding her mourning the death of a pet, he quipped:<blockquote>
<div>Alas! poor Ned<br>
</div>
<div>My monkey's dead!<br>
</div>
<div>I had rather, by half,<br>
</div>
<div>It had been Sir Ralph.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Wraxall</span>, 3.411)</blockquote>After his marriage Payne entered politics, and was returned to parliament for the borough of Shaftesbury, a seat he held from 1768 until 1771. He was a political weathercock, always voting with the government and switching his party allegiances accordingly. He was a close friend of Lord Mansfield, whom he defended in his maiden speech as a seconder of Blackstone's motion against Wilkes (2 February 1769). His speeches and correspondence were absurdly verbose. His cultivation of refinement and his obsession with etiquette similarly verged on the ridiculous, even by the standards of the age. Horace Walpole speculated that this exaggerated style was developed during youthful appearances at amateur dramatics. It may also have reflected the ambition of a colonial outsider for acceptance in metropolitan society. Nevertheless, Payne possessed considerable charm and was one of the most celebrated hosts in London.<br>
<br>On 18 February 1771 Payne was created a knight of the Bath at St James's Palace and in the same year was appointed captain-general and governor-in-chief of the Leeward Islands, where he had inherited a considerable estate from his parents. The colony was not a particularly desirable post because its division among several islands made it expensive and difficult to administer. After a devastating hurricane in 1772 Payne became the first governor in over half a century to tour all the islands in the colony. He was a patron of the artist Thomas Hearne, who painted some of the few contemporary landscapes of the Caribbean. One of these (in the Victoria and Albert Museum) features the arrival of Payne at the capital town of St John's in a coach-and-six with a military honour guard against the background of the court house and guard house.<br>
<br>Payne was a successful governor, despite the fragility of colonial politics in the Caribbean on the eve of the American War of Independence. Although the <span class="italic">Virginia Gazette</span> claimed that his inaugural speech to the island legislatures was written by Lord North, the colonists petitioned for his continuance in office on his departure in 1775. He received a sword set in diamonds by the unanimous vote of the assembly of Antigua. His popularity was helped by his native origins and because he allowed himself to be co-opted by the planter &eacute;lite, with whom he avoided any confrontation.<br>
<br>Payne returned to England, where he re-entered political life. He sat for Camelford in Cornwall from November 1776 to 1780, and for Plympton, Devon, from 1780 to 1784. His attendance in parliament became irregular, perhaps because of the disastrous economic consequences of the American revolutionary wars for the British Caribbean. From June 1777 until the suppression of the office in 1782 he was a clerk of the board of green cloth.<br>
<br>After the American war Payne became a supporter of Fox. His house in Grafton Street became known, through his love of hospitality and the personal attractions of his wife, as the favourite resort of the whig leaders. He joined Brooks's Club, sponsored by Fox, on 2 August 1784 and the Whig Club on 16 January 1787. His expectations of office were frustrated by the rise of Pitt, however, and he left England for an extended tour of the continent in 1788. With the support of the prince of Wales he contested the borough of Fowey in 1790, but there was a double return in which the decision went against him. After this disappointment he wavered in his attachment to the whigs and seceded from the Whig Club. On 15 August 1793 he gave a &#145;considerable dinner&#146; at his house, at which Pitt was a guest. It was at one of his dinner parties that Henry Dundas and Lord Loughborough plotted the alliance of the duke of Portland and Pitt. His change of allegiance was induced by declining profits from his sugar estates in the Leeward Islands. He was well rewarded by his new political patrons: he was created Baron Lavington in the peerage of Ireland on 1 October 1795. The same month he was returned to parliament for New Woodstock, which he continued to represent until 1799. He made no speeches and did not vote on the abolition of the slave trade.<br>
<br>In February 1799 Lavington was reappointed governor of the Leeward Islands, and later the same year was sworn of the privy council. He arrived at Antigua on 12 August 1801 and remained there until his death, at Government House, on 3 August 1807. He was buried the following day on his plantation, Carlisles, and an elaborate marble monument was erected to his memory by the island legislature in the church of the parish of St John's in Antigua. He died childless and almost destitute, and the legislature voted &pound;300 per annum to his widow, who died at Hampton Court Palace on 2 May 1830. His career mirrored the meteoric rise and downfall of absentee sugar planters in Britain.<br>
