<span class="headword">Green,  Guy Mervin Charles</span>  (1913&#150;2005), <span class="occ">cinematographer and film director</span>, was born on 5 November 1913 at 4 Portway, Frome, Somerset, the son of Charles Frederick Green, chauffeur, and his wife, Violet Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith. An enthusiastic filmgoer as a child, he gained his first technical experience operating his school's new film projector, and later used a contact at the film distributor to gain a job as assistant projectionist on cruise ships. Back in London he briefly ran a portrait studio with a friend before entering film production as a clapper boy at Sound City studios, Shepperton, on the film <span class="italic">Song of the Plough</span> (1934), directed by John Baxter.<br>
<br>Green methodically worked his way up through the camera departments of various production companies, working with experienced cinematographers like Claude Friese-Green and Otto Kanturek, and being particularly influenced by the German cameraman G&uuml;nther Krampf. At British International Pictures, Elstree, from the mid-1930s, he graduated to camera operator. He moved over to Denham studios during the Second World War and became operator for the accomplished British cameraman Ronald Neame, shooting exteriors on <span class="italic">A Yank in the RAF</span> (1941) and operating on Michael Powell's <span class="italic">One of our Aircraft is Missing</span> (1942). Of particular importance was his participation on David Lean's <span class="italic">In Which We Serve</span> (1942) and <span class="italic">This Happy Breed</span> (1944), for the director recommended Green to Carol Reed as director of photography on <span class="italic">The Way Ahead</span> (1944), a commission he successfully completed. On 17 July 1943 he had married Ellen Mary Coleman, the 39-year-old daughter of Frank Edgar Coleman, salesman. She later died in childbirth.<br>
<br>When the difficult and perfectionist Lean clashed with Robert Krasker, his cinematographer on <span class="italic">Great Expectations</span> (1946), he chose Green to replace him and the result was a triumph for all concerned. Widely regarded as the most distinguished of all film adaptations of Dickens and reckoned by some to be the greatest ever achievement in black and white cinematography, it won Green an Oscar, the first British film to win the award in this category. Green was the natural choice to photograph Lean's <span class="italic">Oliver Twist</span> (1948), also for the Cineguild company, and once again he turned in a masterful treatment of light and shade and a wonderful evocation of mid-nineteenth-century London. Both of these films are celebrated for the visual force of their striking opening sequences: the terror of Pip in the eerie graveyard as he confronts Magwitch, and the pain and desperation of the heavily pregnant woman struggling through the stormy night to reach the workhouse. The two films were largely shot in the studio, which suited Green as it gave him maximum control: &#145;Outside you're at the mercy of the weather and the time of day, and other terrible problems. I love to be in the studio, there's a set with people on it, and it's pitch black. Then I turn it into a picture by turning light on where I think it should be. That's marvellous fun&#146;  (<span class="italic">Exposure</span>, 32). While working on <span class="italic">Oliver Twist</span> Green met (Celia) Josephine Smith, an actress with the stage name Josephine Stuart, and daughter of Nathaniel Smith, businessman. They married on 24 April 1948, when she was aged twenty-one, and had two children, Michael and Marilyn. After his marriage Green worked with Lean on two further films: <span class="italic">The Passionate Friends</span> (1949) and <span class="italic">Madeleine</span> (1950), pleasing his director with his sensitive lighting of the star Ann Todd.<br>
<br>In 1947 Green had photographed the costume melodrama <span class="italic">Blanche Fury</span> for Cineguild, his first film in Technicolor. Against the prevailing orthodoxy he approached the subject dramatically, explaining:<blockquote>Photography for dramatic subjects &hellip; must reflect the emotional content of the scene &hellip; It must not be a glorious spectacle all on its own. Therefore in some way it must be suppressed and made to lend itself to the subject dramatically &hellip; Monochrome or colour, it is light that sets the scene. (Petrie, 99&#150;100)</blockquote> Nevertheless, despite this understanding of the cinematographer's art, the films with Lean and Cineguild marked the high point of Green's career as a cinematographer. His other work in the early 1950s was more routine: a couple of Disney adventure stories in <span class="italic">The Story of Robin Hood and his Merrie Men</span> (1952) and <span class="italic">Rob Roy the Highland Rogue</span> (1953), and such undistinguished British films as <span class="italic">For Better, for Worse</span> (1954) and <span class="italic">The Dark Avenger</span> (1955). The challenge was not up to that posed by Lean, and Green moved over to directing, the last film he photographed being <span class="italic">I Am a Camera</span> (1955), an uncertain treatment of the Christopher Isherwood stories.<br>
<br>Green commenced directing on the feature <span class="italic">River Beat</span> (1954) and followed it with other routine thrillers and genre pictures, the most successful being <span class="italic">Sea of Sand</span> (1958), a war film shot largely on location in Libya. This collaboration with the actors Richard Attenborough and Michael Craig led to <span class="italic">The Angry Silence</span> (1960), a controversial story of industrial relations and Green's best-regarded film, which won the international film critics' prize at the Berlin film festival. The film was produced by Allied Film Makers, a consortium of film personnel that included Green and gave an unusual measure of control. Another controversial subject&#151;child molestation&#151;was tackled in <span class="italic">The Mark</span> (1961). Green then went to Hollywood to direct some big-budget social problem films, including <span class="italic">Light in the Piazza</span> (1962), <span class="italic">Diamond Head</span> (1963), and <span class="italic">A Patch of Blue</span> (1965), for which he also wrote the script. He lost his way in the later 1960s with an ill-considered adaptation of John Fowles's <span class="italic">The Magus</span> (1968) and a series of forgettable films including the ludicrous <span class="italic">Jacqueline Susann's Once Is not Enough</span> (1975). He then worked out his career in the production mill of American made-for-TV movies, an unsatisfying experience for him as director. His final production was an adaptation of Arthur Hailey's novel <span class="italic">Strong Medicine</span> (1986). In later years he stayed in touch with the industry in his role as a committee member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, helping to nominate the candidates for best foreign language film. He was appointed OBE in 2004. He died at his Beverly Hills home on 15 September 2005, of kidney and heart failure, and was survived by his wife, Josephine, and their two children.<br>
