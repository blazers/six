<span class="headword">Kerr <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bersey; <em>other married name </em>Clark]</span>,  Anne Patricia</span>  (1925&#150;1973), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 24 March 1925 at 20 Hazlewell Road, Putney, south-west London, the daughter of Arnold Leslie Bersey, a chartered accountant, and his wife, Kathleen Isabel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mitchell. Her family was Methodist. From the mid-1930s she attended St Paul's Girls' School in Hammersmith before being evacuated to Budleigh Salterton in Devon at the start of the Second World War. She attended Exmouth grammar school and Southlands College before volunteering for the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS) in 1942. In the WRNS she was stationed at Plymouth, Portsmouth, and Dartmouth. On 6 May 1944 she married James Ewen Doran Clark (<i>b</i>. 1923/4), a lieutenant in the Royal Marines, the son of James Thomson Doran Clark, a major in the Royal Army Medical Corps. She left the WRNS before the birth of their son, Patrick, in July 1945.<br>
<br>Anne Clark returned to London at the end of the war and joined the Ealing branch of the Labour Party in the late 1940s. She trained as an actress and joined the actors' union, Equity, in 1951. She was a broadcaster on <span class="italic">Perspective</span> for BBC television and <span class="italic">Woman's Hour</span> for BBC radio. Her forays into film work were not very successful. She moved to Roehampton and joined the Putney branch of the Labour Party in 1953, becoming its membership secretary and increasing membership from 2000 to 4000 in three years. Her marriage was dissolved in 1953 and she threw her energy into Labour politics. She stood unsuccessfully for Wandsworth borough council in 1956 but was elected as Labour candidate to the London county council (LCC) in 1958.<br>
<br>From early in her political career Anne Clark combined constituency work with political activism. She was deeply involved in the campaign for the abolition of the death penalty and befriended the family of Derek Bentley, an intellectually disabled epileptic hanged in January 1953 for the murder of a policeman. At the LCC she worked on housing and welfare committees, and when she stood (unsuccessfully) for the seat of Twickenham in the general election of 1959 she campaigned on the housing conditions of the poor. During this campaign she met Russell Whiston Kerr (1921&#150;1983), an Australian air charter executive who stood as Labour candidate for Merton and Morden. They shared political views, and married on 29 April 1960.<br>
<br>In 1962 Anne Kerr became Labour candidate for Rochester and Chatham in Kent and in the general election of 1964 she unseated the Conservative MP. Her energetic local campaigning made her popular with constituents and she was re-elected in 1966. Kerr was a member of the Tribune Group of Labour MPs, which was chaired by her husband, and was a signatory to the charter advocating public ownership and the redistribution of wealth. Her Christian background made her socially conservative as well as deeply committed to a string of national and international causes. She opposed legislation for abortion and easier divorce, and was involved in women's groups as a Christian humanitarian and not a feminist. She chaired the Christian action group for the abolition of capital punishment and successfully lobbied the home secretary over the Christian reburial of Derek Bentley.<br>
<br>In her first speech to the House of Commons Kerr argued that there should be a minister for peace, and her lasting contribution to 1960s British politics was as a peace activist and sponsor of the British peace committee. She was a founding member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and addressed public demonstrations against the war in Vietnam. She worked with the British council for peace in Vietnam and personally donated large sums to medical aid for Vietnam. She organized petitions for the release of female prisoners in Saigon and chaired a group of women who sent letters of protest about the bombing of Vietnam to the prime ministers of Britain, Australia, and New Zealand, and the president of the United States. In 1965 she and her husband visited Hanoi and she attended conferences on Vietnam held by international peace organizations in Stockholm. In 1968 they visited Chicago to support Eugene McCarthy during his campaign for the presidential nomination on an anti-war ticket; Anne Kerr's arrest during a demonstration, and subsequent detention, received publicity in Britain.<br>
<br>During the 1960s Kerr was a ceaseless international traveller in the dual causes of world peace and equality. She visited Cuba in 1964 and India in 1966. After a trip to Biafra and Nigeria in 1969 she spoke stridently in the House of Commons against the sale of arms during the war in Nigeria. She supported anti-apartheid campaigns and the Movement for Colonial Freedom (later Liberation), and during the Middle East crisis of 1967 refused to support the government's pro-Israeli stand and lobbied on behalf of Palestinian refugees. However, her overseas trips and political campaigns alienated her from those in her constituency who did not share her humanitarian concerns, and she received bigoted hate mail before suffering a heavy defeat in the general election of 1970.<br>
<br>Kerr was devastated by the loss of her parliamentary seat and turned down several alternative offers of Labour candidacy. She threw herself instead into the Amnesty International campaign for the release of women taken prisoner during the military coup in Greece. In November 1970 she formed Women Against the Common Market, a group aiming to muster popular support against the Common Market and lobby parliament. She was motivated by concern about the exclusion of developing countries and chaired this group until her death. She died tragically at her home, 37 Popes Avenue, Twickenham, London, from acute or chronic alcohol poisoning on 29 July 1973.<br>
