<span class="headword">Stewart,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>John Roy Stewart; Ian Ruadh Stiubhart]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1700&#150;1747), <span class="occ">Jacobite soldier and poet</span>, was born at Knock, Kincardine, Inverness-shire, the son of Donald Stewart and his second wife, Barbara Shaw, who was reputedly fifty-two at the time of his birth. He belonged to the Stewarts of Kincardine, Inverness-shire, who had sold their property to the duke of Gordon in 1683. He was probably the John Stewart commissioned as a lieutenant of an additional company to be added to the Inniskilling dragoons on 25 December 1726, serving as adjutant in 1727. He was certainly recruiting in Inverness in 1727, but was probably placed on half pay in 1729. In the absence of employment he then probably left Britain to serve in the French army and he was present at the siege of Philipsburg from where on 12 June 1734 he reported the death of James Fitzjames, duke of Berwick.<br>
<br>By 1736 Stewart was engaged in Jacobite intrigues, being arrested and incarcerated in Inverness prison, but he escaped with the connivance of Simon Fraser, twelfth Lord Lovat, who sent him with a message to the court of James Stuart, the Pretender, in Rome. From 1739 he seems to have spent most of his time at Boulogne in France. With the outbreak of war he was again employed in the French army and fought at Fontenoy on 30 April 1745. In August he received leave from the French army and having travelled through Ghent he arrived in the highlands, joining the Jacobite army at Blair Atholl on 30&#150;31 August 1745. His first task was to raise a regiment in the north, but after the battle of Prestonpans on 21 September 1745 he was ordered to raise a regiment in Edinburgh. Initially he seems to have attracted some of General Cope's defeated army, but soon they all left him. Stewart was opposed to the decision to invade England, later referring to it as &#145;the first great error committed&#146;  (Tayler, 253); he preferred to take Edinburgh and Stirling, &#145;proclaim the King, call a parliament and take full possession of Scotland&#146;  (ibid.). Nevertheless, he led the regiment in its march into England and it covered the retreat from Derby and Manchester. While the regiment guarded the baggage at Stirling, Stewart fought at the battle of Falkirk on 17 January 1746. The regiment commanded by Stewart probably fought in the front line at Culloden and after the defeat it managed to rendezvous with the remnants of the Jacobite army at Ruthven.<br>
<br>Stewart may have been wounded at Culloden, but he attended a meeting at Muir Laggon on Loch Arkaig, Inverness-shire, to consider how to proceed. He may have been sent by Prince Charles to France with news of the defeat, but if so he returned to Scotland and was eventually one of those who sailed from Loch nan Uamh on Skye with the prince back to France. He described his adventures following Culloden in a poem, <span class="italic">John Roy's Psalm</span>, one of many Gaelic songs and laments.<br>
<br>In 1747 Stewart was at both Nieuport and Boulogne; he died that year, probably at the end of June. He left a widow, Sarah Hall, and a daughter in dire poverty; the Old Pretender wrote on 7 November 1747 of his concern for them. He may also have left a son, Charles, who served in the French army. His wife and daughter subsequently received a pension which was continued for thirty years. Such was Stewart's reputation that the British authorities were receiving reports of his supposed activities in Scotland well into December 1747. He should not be confused with Prince Charles Edward's valet, who remained with the prince in exile and who received a Jacobite baronetcy in 1784.<br>
