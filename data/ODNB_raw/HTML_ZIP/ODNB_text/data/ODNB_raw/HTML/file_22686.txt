<span class="headword">Poynings,  Thomas</span>, first Baron Poynings  (1512?&#150;1545), <span class="occ">soldier and courtier</span>, was one of the three illegitimate sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22683/', "Sir Edward Poynings (1459&#150;1521)")</script> of Westenhanger, Kent. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65669/', "Sir Adrian Poynings")</script> was his brother. His mother could have been Rose Whetehill of Calais, who was left an annuity of 40 marks in Sir Edward's will of 1521. The two may have met during Sir Edward's time in Calais in the late 1480s and early 1490s. Thomas was probably born in 1512, as Sir Edward provided in his will that the revenues of the manor of Westenhanger should be enjoyed by his servant Edward Thwaytes for twelve years until Thomas came of age. This also corresponds to Thomas's first appearance at court.<br>
<br>Poynings served at the coronation of Anne Boleyn in June 1533 and was made a knight of the Bath during the coronation celebrations. His listing as a sewer-extraordinary in a document dated by the editors of <span class="italic">Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, of the Reign of &hellip; Henry VIII</span> to 1516 is a mistake: the document has subsequently been redated to 1535. Poynings continued his father's close links with Kent and its gentry families. He was on the sheriff roll for the county in 1533 and chosen in the following year. During the northern rising of 1536 he contributed 150 men for the royal army, serving alongside other leading Kentish members of the royal affinity. His links with Sir Thomas Wyatt were especially close; while Wyatt was abroad as ambassador at the imperial court during 1537&#150;9, Poynings acted as his agent, petitioning Cromwell for the payment of Wyatt's annuity. Indeed, there is evidence that he may have served with Wyatt abroad, receiving a diet as an ambassador between 19 March 1537 and 2 June 1539. He continued to have close contacts with the court throughout the late 1530s, being present at both the christening of the future Edward VI and the funeral of Jane Seymour in 1537, and jousting in a tournament in May 1540. Some time before 1539 he married Katherine, daughter and coheir of John, second Lord Marney, and widow of George Ratcliffe.<br>
<br>In 1540 it appears that the king decided to establish Poynings as a power in the west country, possibly based around the Marney lands in Dorset and Somerset which had descended to his wife. In August of that year he exchanged Westenhanger for a grant of monastic land in Dorset. He also acquired lands in Wiltshire, Cornwall, and Somerset. Within weeks, however, it was decided that he could best serve the king abroad: in October he was dispatched to Calais as marshall. Presumably, he had demonstrated both the military prowess, probably during the suppression of the Pilgrimage of Grace, and diplomatic skills, perhaps while serving with Wyatt, that the position at Calais demanded. In December 1540 he took temporary charge of the important castle at Gu&icirc;nes on the death of William, Lord Sandys. He remained at Gu&icirc;nes until 1544, frequently taking part in border skirmishes with the French. During the invasion of France in 1544 he led a contingent from Dorset. It was during this campaign that his martial reputation was firmly established: he was involved in heavy fighting around Montreuil in July, and was responsible for the tactics of the assault on Boulogne which captured that town on 13 September.<br>
<br>On 30 January 1545 Poynings was raised to the peerage as Baron Poynings, in preparation for his appointment as lieutenant of Boulogne &#145;as the most experienced in wars with the Frenchmen upon the frontiers and as speaking their language&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 20/1, no. 121). He continued to serve in the front line while lieutenant: in July his horse was shot from under him during one attack. That year he was nominated for the Garter by the dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk and the earls of Arundel, Hertford, Essex, and Surrey. But he was not elected, and his career was cut short when he contracted dysentery and died, still at Boulogne, on 17 August 1545. His only child, a son christened in March 1539, probably died in infancy.<br>
