<span class="headword">Raines, Sir  Julius Augustus Robert</span>  (1827&#150;1909), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Rome on 9 March 1827, the only son of Colonel Joseph Robert Raines of Cork, of the 77th, 82nd, 95th, and 48th regiments, who had served in the Peninsular War, and his wife, Julia, daughter of Edward Jardine of Sevenoaks, Kent, banker. As a boy he lived with his mother's family at Sevenoaks, and attended the school there. He received his military education at the &Eacute;cole Militaire, Brunswick (where an uncle by marriage, Baron von Girsewald, was master of horse to the duke), and at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He entered the army, as ensign in the 3rd foot (the Buffs), on 28 January 1842, and in the same year exchanged into the 95th regiment. He was promoted lieutenant on 5 April 1844, and captain on 13 April 1852.<br>
<br>Raines served throughout the Crimean War (1854&#150;5). For his services with the Turkish army in Silistria, before the invasion of the Crimea, he long after received the first-class gold medal of the Liakat. After the action at Bulganek he carried the queen's colour at the Alma. He was at Inkerman and Chernaya, and through the siege and fall of Sevastopol he served as an assistant engineer, being severely wounded in the trenches during the bombardment of 17 October 1854, and being present in the trenches at the attack on the Redan on 18 June 1855. He was mentioned in dispatches, and was awarded the Mejidiye (fifth class) and a brevet majority (24 April 1855). He became major on 1 May 1857.<br>
<br>Raines commanded the 95th throughout the Indian mutiny campaign in 1857&#150;9. He was present at the assault and capture of Rewah on 6 January 1858, when he received the commendation of the governor of Bombay and the commander-in-chief for &#145;gallantry displayed and ably conducting these operations&#146;. He led the left wing of the 95th at the siege and capture of Awa on 24 January, and at the siege and capture of Kotah on 30 March was in command of the third assaulting column. After the battle of Kotah-ki-sarai he was mentioned in dispatches. He was especially active during the capture of Gwalior on 19 June, when he was wounded by a musket ball in the left arm, after taking by assault two 18-pounders and helping to turn the captured guns on the enemy. For bravery in minor engagements he was four times mentioned in dispatches. The 95th, while under his command in central India, marched 3000 miles. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 17 November 1857, and brevet colonel on 20 July 1858, and was made CB on 21 March 1859. He married on 15 November 1859 his cousin, Catherine Elizabeth, eldest daughter and coheir of John Nicholas Wrixon of Killetra, Mallow, co. Cork. They had no children, and she survived him.<br>
<br>Raines next saw active service at Aden, where he commanded an expedition into the interior in 1865&#150;6. The British troops captured and destroyed many villages and ports, including Assala, the Fadhlis' capital, and seven cannon. He was promoted major-general on 6 March 1868, lieutenant-general on 1 October 1877, and general (retired) on 1 July 1881, and was appointed colonel-in-chief of the Buffs (the East Kent regiment), in 1882. He was advanced to KCB on 3 June 1893 and GCB in 1906, and in the same year he received the grand cross of the Danish order of the Dannebrog. He published in 1900 <span class="italic">The 95th (the Derbyshire) Regiment in Central India</span>. He died on 11 April 1909 at his residence, 46 Sussex Gardens, Hyde Park, London, and was buried in the parish church, Sevenoaks.<br>
