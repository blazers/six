<span class="headword">Tutin, Dame  Dorothy</span>  (1930&#150;2001), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 8 April 1930 at 63 Warrington Crescent, London, the only child of John Tutin, naval architect, and his wife, Ada Evelyn (Adie), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fryers. She had a half-brother, Eric, five years older, from her mother's first marriage, who died aged ten. She was educated at St Catherine's School in Bramley, Surrey, but she left at fifteen to train as a musician. She spent a year studying the piano, flute, and singing, but decided that she was not talented enough. Her parents persuaded her to go instead to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, although much later she said, &#145;I never, ever wanted to act&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 Aug 2001), and she was afflicted throughout her career by nervousness and a lack of self-confidence.<br>
<br>Tutin's first stage appearance was at the club theatre, The Boltons, where in September 1949 she played Princess Margaret in William Douglas Home's <span class="italic">The Thistle and the Rose</span>. She joined the Bristol Old Vic Company in January 1950, where among other parts she played Phoebe in Shakespeare's <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>. She returned to London for the Old Vic's 1950&#150;51 season. She was meant to be understudying Anouk Aim&eacute;e as Princess Katherine of France in <span class="italic">Henry V</span>, but Aim&eacute;e was unavailable and Tutin got the role, for which she won excellent reviews. That season she also played Ann Page in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span> and Win-The-Fight-Littlewit in Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Bartholomew Fair</span>. At the Lyric, Hammersmith, in September 1951 she played Martina in Christopher Fry's <span class="italic">Thor, With Angels</span>. She then played Hero in John Gielgud's production of <span class="italic">Much Ado About Nothing</span> at the Phoenix in January 1952; dissatisfied with her acting, she was about to give up the stage when she was cast as Rose Pemberton in Graham Greene's <span class="italic">The Living Room</span> (1953), playing a Catholic girl driven to suicide through her guilt at having an affair with a married man. Kenneth Tynan described her in this role as &#145;ablaze like a diamond in a mine&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 Aug 2001). <span class="italic">The Living Room</span> made her name on stage and brought her the Variety Club's actress of the year award, but it also destroyed her soprano singing voice. As she later recalled, the director complained, &#145;You're being too British! Where's your temperament?&#146;. So she went on stage and screamed and choked. &#145;That caused my trouble. I went to a voice specialist who said I had to be silent for nine days. We opened in Edinburgh in ten&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 7 Aug 2001). The nodules healed, but her singing voice never fully returned.<br>
<br>Tutin scored another triumph at the New Theatre in March 1954 playing Sally Bowles in <span class="italic">I am a Camera</span>, based on Christopher Isherwood's novel, <span class="italic">Goodbye to Berlin</span> (1939), later to become the musical <span class="italic">Cabaret</span>. Caryl Brahms applauded her for the skill with which she combined &#145;the satiric with the entirely credible&#146;, and memorably described her voice as &#145;the kind of curdled cooing that could only come from a turtle-dove with laryngitis&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 7 Aug 2001). Tutin's next play, a translation of Jean Anouilh's <span class="italic">The Lark</span> in which she opened at the Lyric, Hammersmith, playing Joan of Arc in March 1955, was less successful, and was compared unfavourably with Bernard Shaw's <span class="italic">Saint Joan</span> starring Siobhan McKenna, which was then playing in the West End. At the Saville in December she was Hedvig in Ibsen's <span class="italic">The Wild Duck</span>. Caryl Brahms, who did not care for the play, bemoaned the fact that she played the part at all, but noted that it was inevitable, since all serious young actresses wanted to play Hedvig. She won better reviews for her portrayal of Caroline Traherne in John Whiting's <span class="italic">The Gates of Summer</span> (on tour in 1956), and of Jean Rice, playing opposite Laurence Olivier, in John Osborne's <span class="italic">The Entertainer</span> (at the Royal Court in 1957).<br>
<br>In 1958 Tutin joined the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre Company at Stratford upon Avon where she played Juliet in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> and, directed by Peter Hall (who became a great admirer), Viola in <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span>. Peter Jackson wrote: &#145;Dorothy Tutin's golden Viola is wonderfully boyish, breathless, bewildered and always completely audible. She is alive and to be alive in a cast like this [it included Geraldine McEwan, Richard Johnson, and Patrick Wymark] means working double overtime.&#146; Further successes followed as Ophelia in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> (in which part she toured with the company to Leningrad and Moscow in December 1958), Portia in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> in 1960 (Peter Roberts comparing her conception of the role to that of Ellen Terry), and Cressida in <span class="italic">Troilus and Cressida</span> in the same year. She received the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> award for best actress for her portrayal of Viola in <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> at the Aldwych in December 1960. In February 1961 she played Sister Jeanne in John Whiting's <span class="italic">The Devils</span>, which Peter Hall had commissioned specially for his first London season at the Aldwych. Frank Granville-Barker called it a brilliant new play, comparing it to <span class="italic">Peer Gynt</span> and <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, and was particularly enthused by Tutin's performance. Back at Stratford in August 1961 (with what was now called the Royal Shakespeare Company) she once more played Juliet and was Desdemona to Gielgud's disatrous <span class="italic">Othello</span>, directed by Franco Zeffirelli. She was with Gielgud again in December 1961 when at the Aldwych they were in Chekhov's <span class="italic">The Cherry Orchard</span>. In January 1963 she made her New York d&eacute;but with the company in <span class="italic">The Hollow Crown</span>, devised by John Barton.<br>
<br>On 23 December 1963 Tutin married Derek Barton-Chapple, the actor <a href="#cosubject_98621">Derek Waring [<i>see below</i>]</a>. They had two children, Nicholas and Amanda, who as Nick Waring and Amanda Waring followed their parents into the acting profession. &#145;We never thought they would act&#146;, Tutin later said. &#145;They had seen so much of the pain and anguish of the profession&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 Aug 2001). Nevertheless she was delighted by her children's success.<br>
<br>Following her marriage, Tutin continued to receive plaudits for her work with the Royal Shakespeare Company and elsewhere. At the Bristol Old Vic in March 1965 she played Queen Victoria in an evening compiled from documentary material and letters, called <span class="italic">Portrait of a Queen</span>. Her portrayal of Rosalind in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> at Stratford in 1967 and in Los Angeles the following year won glowing reviews. She then took on the lead in the musical (based on H. G. Wells's novel) <span class="italic">Ann Veronica</span>, opening at the Belgrade Theatre, Coventry, in 1969. Nevertheless she was uncertain about her ability to succeed in such a role, and chose not to play the part in London. Notable further successes included her portrayals of Francine in <span class="italic">Play on Love</span> at St Martin's Theatre and Alice in <span class="italic">Arden of Faversham</span> at the Roundhouse, both in 1970, Kate in Harold Pinter's <span class="italic">Old Times</span> at the Aldwych in 1971, and Peter Pan at the Coliseum in 1971 and again in 1972.<br>
<br>At Chichester in 1974 Tutin played Natalya in Turgenev's <span class="italic">A Month in the Country</span>, and the critics agreed it was the best thing in the season. In November 1974 she played Maggie in J. M. Barrie's <span class="italic">What Every Woman Knows</span> at the Albery Theatre. Garry O' Connor acclaimed her &#145;completely endearing and moving performance, in which there is no nuance of understanding or sharpness of mind passed over. Miss Tutin has a perfect combination of toughness and pathos&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 7 Aug 2001). In the following November she played Natalya once more, at the Albery, and once more received the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> award for best actress. Further triumphs in the late 1970s included her portrayals of Madame Ranevsky in <span class="italic">The Cherry Orchard</span>, Lady Macbeth, Lady Plyant in Congreve's <span class="italic">The Double Dealer</span>, and Genia Hofreiter in Tom Stoppard's version of Schnitzler's <span class="italic">Undiscovered Country</span>, all at the National. In the 1980s and 1990s she was less often seen on stage, and complained of the lack of parts for women &#145;of a certain age&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 7 Aug 2001). Nevertheless she gave memorable performances as Hester in Terence Rattigan's <span class="italic">The Deep Blue Sea</span> (at Greenwich in 1981), Sarah Bernhardt in Ronald Harwood's <span class="italic">After the Lions</span> (at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, in 1982), Deborah, a woman recovering from sleeping sickness in Harold Pinter's <span class="italic">A Kind of Alaska</span> (at the Duchess in 1985), and the widowed sister in Neil Simon's <span class="italic">Brighton Beach Memoirs</span> (at the Aldwych in 1987). A late success was as one of the inmates of an old people's home in D. L. Coburn's <span class="italic">The Gin Game</span> (at the Savoy in 1999). She was also a regular, and much acclaimed, fixture at the Chichester festival.<br>
<br>Tutin scored notable early film successes as Cecily in <span class="italic">The Importance of Being Earnest</span> (1951), Polly Peachum in <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> (1954), and Lucie Manette in <span class="italic">A Tale of Two Cities</span> (1956). Later successes included Sophie Brzeska in Ken Russell's <span class="italic">Savage Messiah</span> (1972), for which she won the Variety Club's award for best film actress of the year, and Lady Minnie Nettleby, opposite James Mason as Sir Randolph Nettleby, in <span class="italic">The Shooting Party</span> (1984). Her last film was <span class="italic">Maybe Next Year</span> (1998). Later in life she said that &#145;I would have loved to be in more films, but I didn't exactly have &#147;the face of the moment&#148; when I was young&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 7 Aug 2001). Somewhat contradictorily, she also said,<blockquote>I think we get what we desire. I was once offered a Hollywood contract but I turned it down. I wouldn't have been right for it. I didn't want the trappings that went with it. So perhaps I got what I desired: a great deal of hard work and not much money. I wanted to be a good actress. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 Aug 2001)</blockquote>Tutin was even less proud of her work for television, and in her <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry recorded merely &#145;Has appeared on television&#146;. Nevertheless, her television appearances included a much-acclaimed portrayal of Anne Boleyn in <span class="italic">The Six Wives of Henry VIII</span> (1970), a notable success as Sarah Burton in the thirteen-episode serialization of Winifred Holtby's <span class="italic">South Riding</span> (1974), and a well-received performance as Florence in <span class="italic">The Great Kandinsky</span> (1995), as well as many lesser roles.<br>
<br>Small and elfin, Tutin was described by Caryl Brahms as<blockquote>a small-scale hurricane. And once she is unleashed upon a part, there is bound to be, one feels, a short, sharp tussle. But Miss Tutin comes out on top, and having subdued it to her temperamental and technical measure, parades in it, all smiles and sequinned tears. She can be gay, pathetic, lively, stunned&#151;part minx, part poet, part sex-kitten. A comedienne of skill and a pint-sized tragedienne. (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 7 Aug 2001)</blockquote>She was made a DBE in 2000, having been appointed CBE in 1967. In her last years she suffered from acute myeloid leukaemia, from which she died at the King Edward VII Hospital, Easebourne, Sussex, on 6 August 2001.<br>
<br>Tutin's husband, <a name="cosubject_98621"></a><span class="headword">Derek  Barton-Chapple</span> <span class="st"> [<em>performing name </em>Derek Waring]</span>  (1927&#150;2007), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 26 April 1927 at St Clair, 30 Goodwyn Avenue, Mill Hill, London, the son of Wing Commander Harry John Barton Chapple (1898&#150;1978), RAF officer and electrical engineer, who assisted John Logie Baird with his early television experiments, and his wife, Ada Marian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Chuter (1897&#150;1998). He was educated at Dulwich College. After national service with the army in India he declined a place at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, to read modern languages, and went instead to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, where he adopted the stage name Derek Waring, before spending five years in repertory theatre. He made his West End d&eacute;but in <span class="italic">The World of Suzie Wong</span> (Prince of Wales Theatre, 1958). From 1962 to 1964 he acted with the Royal Shakespeare Company, where he met Tutin. He played Albert to her Victoria in <span class="italic">Portrait of a Queen</span>, both in the West End (Vaudeville Theatre, 1965) and on Broadway (Henry Miller's Theatre, 1968). Other stage appearances included Michael Pertwee's <span class="italic">Sextet</span> (Criterion Theatre, 1977), the Agatha Christie thriller <span class="italic">Cards on the Table</span> (Vaudeville Theatre, 1981), George Bernard Shaw's <span class="italic">You Never Can Tell</span> (Haymarket Theatre, 1987), and the musicals <span class="italic">Cowardy Custard</span> (Mermaid Theatre, 1972) and Leslie Bricusse's <span class="italic">Sherlock Holmes</span> (Cambridge Theatre, 1989), in which he played Dr Watson. He was perhaps better known for his roles on film and especially television. He made his cinema d&eacute;but as a surgeon in the Ealing comedy <span class="italic">Barnacle Bill</span> (1957), starring Alec Guinness. There followed a large number of character parts in a wide variety of largely forgotten British films of the 1960s and 1970s. His television appearances included <span class="italic">The Adventures of Sir Lancelot</span> (1957) and <span class="italic">The Adventures of Robin Hood</span> (1957&#150;8), <span class="italic">Z Cars</span> (1969&#150;73, as Detective Inspector Neil Goss), <span class="italic">Moody and Pegg</span> (1974&#150;5, as the antique dealer Roland Moody awkwardly sharing a house with the civil servant Daphne Pegg, played by Judy Cornwell), <span class="italic">Partners</span> (1981, written by his brother Richard, who had adopted the pen name Richard Waring), the sketch show <span class="italic">The Funny Side</span> (1985), and <span class="italic">Keeping up Appearances</span> (1995). He was described by one television executive who worked with him as an excellent &#145;company chap&#146; but &#145;lightweight&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 22 Feb 2007). He was an enthusiastic and talented cook as well as gardener. He died on 19 February 2007 at Petworth Cottage Nursing and Convalescent Home, Petworth, Sussex, of cancer. He was survived by his two children.<br>
