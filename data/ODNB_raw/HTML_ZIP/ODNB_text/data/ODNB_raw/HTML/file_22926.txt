<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pym,  John</span>  (1584&#150;1643), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 20 May 1584, the son of Alexander Pym (<i>c</i>.1547&#150;1585) and his wife, Philippa Colles (<i>d</i>. 1620), and was baptized at St Giles Cripplegate, London, on 18 June.<h2>
<a name="ThePymfamilyanditsestates"></a>The Pym family and its estates</h2>Pym came from an old Somerset family on the fringe of the magisterial class. He was not a man born to a place in county or parliamentary politics. On the other hand, people from backgrounds much more obscure than his, such as his fellow Somerset man Sir Francis Cottington, could achieve political careers by clinging to a career ladder and cultivating possible patrons as they went up it. It was perhaps Pym's difficulty that he fell rather heavily between these two stools.<br>
<br>The Pym family appear to have been established in the manor of Brymore, Somerset, since the thirteenth century, but had not had a particularly distinguished sixteenth century. The family entered it under a cloud. In October 1498 Alexander Pym was made to take out a recognizance of &pound;10,000 for aiding Perkin Warbeck. The dissolution of the monasteries passed them by and, in a fluid land market, their holdings remained almost static. It did not help, either, that the family experienced three wardships during the century. The first of these, in 1507, produced the highest valuation of the three, at &pound;56 5<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>. per annum. In 1528 Pym's grandfather Erasmus in turn became a ward, and the wardship was sold to Sir Thomas Elyot, author of <span class="italic">The Boke Named the Governour</span>, who was a distant cousin. The estate was then valued at &pound;41 9<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. per annum. Erasmus Pym lived an unremarkable life on the fringe of the magisterial class.<br>
<br>In 1575 Erasmus Pym was succeeded by John's father, Alexander, under whom the family fortunes began to look up. He was a JP, a commissioner for musters, and a significant figure in the Middle Temple. In 1584 he was elected MP for Taunton, though there is no evidence that he had taken his seat before he died in January 1585. He seems to have brought enhanced economic status to the family. He was responsible for the family's one substantial purchase of the sixteenth century, Wollavington Throckmorton, sold by Francis Throckmorton of Feckenham, Worcestershire, for &pound;1700 in 1581. The money was to be paid &#145;in and upon the Fante Stone in the Temple Church in the suburbs of London, or in and upon the place where the Fante now standeth&#146;  (Pym MSS, Somerset Archive and Record Service, DD/BW, no. 113). The Middle Temple network was widespread and powerful, and it worked for Alexander. The manor adjoined, and consolidated, the existing manor of Wollavington Pym, and when Burghley gave the accolade of arrival to the Pyms by marking them on his political atlas he put them at Wollavington.<br>
<br>Alexander's first marriage, in 1576&#151;which cannot have lasted more than three or four years&#151;continued one habit which limited the Pyms' county strength, which was that of marrying outside the county. It was to Elizabeth, daughter of John Conyers of St Botolph Aldgate in London. It was a Middle Temple marriage: Alexander had shared a chamber with her brother. They had one daughter, Catherine, who subsequently married William Cholmeley, foreign apposer of the exchequer.<br>
<br>Alexander's second marriage was to John Pym's mother, Philippa Colles, daughter of Humphrey Colles of Pitminster, Somerset. She was the sister of John Colles, JP, deputy lieutenant and, crucially for the history of John Pym, county feodary. She had two children: Jane, who subsequently married Richard Rous of Wotton, Cornwall, with whom she had at least seventeen children, and John. On 5 January 1585, seven months after John's birth, Alexander Pym died, and plunged the family into its third wardship of the century.<br>
<br>The wardship appears not to have attracted the attention of any big speculators. There were two serious contenders for it: John's mother and his uncle William Pym. Since John Colles as feodary acted consistently in the interests of his sister, the wardship in effect became a duel between John's two uncles. That was no contest: John Colles was far the abler operator of the two. The friendship between the families lasted, and John Colles may have been a more important influence in the development of Pym's political sense than is normally recognized. The Colleses were not ideologues: they had made their fortune by favourable leases from Bishop Gilbert Bourne during the reign of Mary, but John Colles put his name to the bond of association in defence of Queen Elizabeth against her Catholic enemies in 1584. The religious clause of John Colles's will, which is unique among all Pym's contacts in its eschewal of hot protestantism, strikes the key note. He expresses belief in the resurrection of the flesh, the life everlasting, &#145;and all other articles of my faithe whiche a Christyane man oughte to beleeve&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/111, sig. 63). Unlike many other neutral wills, this one was so by studied choice.<br>
<br>The wardship was duly granted to Pym's mother, Philippa. It was valued at the inquisition post mortem at &pound;52 15<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>, and reduced in the feodary's survey to &pound;51 13<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>. This is a valuation below that arrived at by Henry VII in 1507. There is no reason to suppose that these figures had any resemblance to what the estate was worth. First, the valuation concealed the newly purchased manor of Wollavington Throckmorton, by lumping the two Wollavington manors, Wollavington Throckmorton and Wollavington Pym, together under the conflated name of Wollavington. If the price had been set at the rate of twenty years' purchase, the value of the suppressed manor would have been &pound;85. The other reason why a rental income was not a credible estimate of the value of the property was the habit of taking much of the income in entry fines in return for long leases. In 1614, in a document designed to be produced in the event of a wardship, Pym estimated his rental at &pound;100 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. per annum. His recorded income from entry fines, in a very incomplete collection of estate documents, comes to &pound;158 per annum for the reign of James and &pound;293 per annum for the reign of Charles up to 1640, when the series stops until well after both the war and John Pym's life were over. The late Miss Evelyn Gore, who had access to surveys which do not now survive, estimated Pym's median income from land at the beginning of James's reign at between &pound;400 and &pound;500 per annum, with the mean inflated above the median by occasional very large fines.<h2>
<a name="TheRouscircle"></a>The Rous circle</h2>It was a status on which magistracy was possible, but one at which being out of sight very quickly became out of mind. Pym never had the chance to get to know his Somerset contemporaries, since before he reached the age of four his mother married Anthony Rous of Halton St Dominic in Cornwall, and took the boy to live on the Cornish shore of Plymouth Sound. The Rouses were a very large and affectionate family, in which kin counted for even more than it did with the Pyms. John Pym adopted them as his own, and from then on, his career would be more easily understood if he were known as John Rous, younger son of Anthony Rous.<br>
<br>Anthony Rous, originally from the borders of Sussex and Hampshire, was a rare character who made a success of being an expatriate in another county. In Cornwall he became JP and vice-warden of the stannaries. He was sheriff in the two crucial years of 1588 and 1603 and was knight of the shire in 1604, sitting on the committee to draft an act of thanksgiving for deliverance from the Gunpowder Plot. His committee service was regular, at least for the first session of the parliament, but he was not a frequent speaker. He was executor to Sir Francis Drake, who seems to have been a close personal friend. He was knighted in 1604.<br>
<br>Both the children of Alexander Pym and Philippa married into the inner Rous circle. Jane married Anthony Rous's son from his first marriage, Robert. John, on 28 May 1604, married Anne Hooke (<i>bap</i>. 1586, <i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1620), of Bramshott in Hampshire, daughter of John Hooke and Anthony Rous's sister Barbara. This marriage both cemented Pym into the Rous circle and began his connection with Hampshire.<br>
<br>Among Rous's other children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24171/', "Francis Rous")</script> was to be John Pym's regular parliamentary colleague, and one of the very few people who ever made Pym's hatred of Arminianism look half-hearted. Philippa married Humphrey Nicoll of Penvose, Cornwall, and their son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20172/', "Anthony Nicoll")</script> was an active member of the Long Parliament. Dorothy Rous married John Upton of Brixham, who was repeatedly MP for Dartmouth. John Upton was an active JP in Devon, and an active member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95346', "Providence Island Company")</script>. He also created the connection between John Pym and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5709/', "John Clotworthy")</script>, since his brother married Clotworthy's sister. This connection was to be vital to relations between the Long Parliament and Ireland.<br>
<br>Two other people, Charles Fitz-Geffrey, later vicar of Halton St Dominic, and Diagory Wheare, later Pym's tutor at Oxford, are firmly embedded in this circle. On 6 July 1593 Francis, Richard, and Robert Rous, Charles Fitz-Geffrey, and Diagory Wheare all matriculated at Broadgates Hall, Oxford (now Pembroke College), on the same day. Wheare was later named by William Camden as reader of his history lecture in Oxford. He remained in close contact with Pym, and was probably his source for much of his information on Oxford matters.<br>
<br>According to Anthony Rous's funeral sermon, preached by Fitz-Geffrey in 1622, he showed evident signs of saving grace in his religious course. It was in the Rous circle that Pym imbibed a protestantism far hotter than the conventional Calvinism of his Somerset background. Anthony Rous sustained distressed ministers from Scotland, Ireland, and the Netherlands, and in 1584&#150;5 employed as his domestic chaplain John Cowper, a Scottish minister in exile from the <span class="roman">Black Acts</span>. Rous was thought to have died by catching a cold going up the Tamar by boat on a frosty morning to attend the weekly lecture at Saltash. On the sabbath, he made religious notes in a book. The praise in his funeral sermon for his generosity to the poor is on the whole sustained by his administration of John Pym's estates during the wardship.<br>
<br>Yet trying to make too clear a distinction about 1600 between puritans and Calvinist conformists carries the risk of creating an anachronism: this was a fault line the Laudians had not yet cracked open. Calvinist ideas of predestination and assurance, which Whitgift and Cartwright shared and which members of the Rous circle expressed at every possible opportunity, were, in Dr N. Tyacke's phrase, &#145;a common and ameliorating bond&#146; between conformist and nonconformist  (&#145;Puritanism, Arminianism and counter-revolution&#146;, <span class="italic">The Origins of the English Civil War</span>, ed. C. Russell, 1973, 121). The fact is nowhere clearer than in Pym's circle. The only exception seems to have been Pym's mother, who appears to have been one of those tragic Calvinists who believed they were predestined to damnation.<br>
<br>In 1599 Pym followed the rest of the Rous tribe to Broadgates Hall. His Oxford loyalty, together with his loyalty to Diagory Wheare his tutor, appears to have been strong. In 1623 he contributed 44<i>s</i>. to a Broadgates appeal for enlarging the hall, for meeting at disputations, and lodgings for students. He was more munificent in 1630 in reply to a personal appeal from Wheare for subscriptions to Gloucester Hall, of which Wheare had become principal. The total yield of the appeal was &pound;88, of which John Pym contributed &pound;20, and his eldest surviving son, Alexander, another &pound;20. Much the clearest statement of his Oxford loyalties is in his parliamentary diary for 1621. In reporting the debate on whether Oxford or Cambridge should be mentioned first in the subsidy bill, he said:<blockquote>All those which had been of either Universitie inclined to that place of which they were. But such as had been of neither remained indifferent and were only swayed by reason. Soe that uppon the question the precedence was appointed to Oxford. (Notestein, Relf, and Simpson, 4.144&#150;5)</blockquote>That is the true faith.Pym also followed the family path to the Middle Temple, where he was admitted on 5 February 1602, and bound with Francis Rous and William Whitaker of Westbury, later to be his regular lawyer, a parliamentary colleague, and a member of the Rous circle. However, the Middle Temple appears not to have taken as Oxford did, and the records show a succession of absences during readings, for which he was fined. The Middle Temple did, however, produce a friendship with Benjamin Rudyerd which lasted the rest of his life.<br>
<br>In his thirty-eight years from coming of age to death, Pym had at least five different addresses. Up to the death of his wife about 1620, he lived at his ancestral home at the manor of Brymore, in the parish of Cannington, outside Taunton in Somerset. During most of the 1620s he divided his time between Sir William Boswell's house in the parish of St Clement Danes in London, which he rented jointly with his brother-in-law William Cholmeley, and a house in the parish of Wherwell (or Horwell) in Hampshire, where he tried to turn himself into a Hampshire country gentleman. From 1630 onwards he was usually found in London, in the parish of St Andrew's, Holborn. From about 1636 onwards until parliament met, he was normally living in the house of Richard Knightley in Fawsley in Northamptonshire, in what Clarendon called &#145;a kind of classis&#146;  (Clarendon, 1.145).<h2>
<a name="Earlyadulthood"></a>Early adulthood</h2>After livery of his estate in 1605, Pym returned home to Somerset with his new bride. He apparently intended to get re-established there, since he had plans to install a new water supply at Brymore. Up to about 1620, when his wife, his mother, his stepfather, and his eldest son, John, all died within a short space of time, Pym seems to have been set on planting himself on the Somerset stage. He was resident reasonably regularly and paid serious attention to the management of his property. What he did not achieve was any entry into Somerset county society. In all this period, only two Somerset gentlemen so much as appear on documents with him. One is Sir John Mallett of Penvose, who was one of his sureties for the office of receiver of crown lands for Hampshire, Wiltshire, and Gloucestershire. The other sureties were Thomas Conyers of East Barnet, his father's old Middle Temple chamberfellow and brother of his father's first wife, and William Cholmeley, husband of his elder sister. It is a clear example of the tendency of the Pyms to rely on kin rather than on neighbourhood, and underlines the point that Sir John Mallett was the son of Philippa Pym's sister.<br>
<br>The other Somerset gentleman associated with Pym was William Frauncis of Combe Florey, an established but not particularly important JP. He appears in several minor documents, and in the complex uses of 1614, by which Pym attempted to protect his property against wardship in the event of his death. These documents attempted the complex, and legally dubious, arrangement of a use upon a use. The feoffees to the first were William Frauncis, Humphrey Nicoll of Penvose, Cornwall, Robert Rous of Wotton, Cornwall, another of Pym's stepbrothers, and Diagory Wheare. The feoffees for the second were William Cholmeley his brother-in-law, William Whitaker of the Middle Temple, his lawyer, and one new arrival, Sir Edward Wardour of the parish of St Giles-in-the-Fields, clerk of the pells in the exchequer. Wardour was also an active Middlesex and Westminster JP, and a friend of Francis Russell, fourth earl of Bedford. He may possibly have been the man who established contact between Pym and Bedford. Wardour was a parliamentary colleague during the 1620s, and involved in the draft plans for Pym and Bedford's revenue settlement in 1641. Along with Ralph Brownrigg, master of St Catharine's College, Cambridge, and bishop of Exeter from November 1641, who married William Cholmeley's daughter, he was one of only two people in Pym's circle who became royalists in the civil war.<br>
<br>The enfeoffments to use secured a descent to three of Pym's sons in order. John, eldest son and heir apparent, was born in 1609, matriculated at Gloucester Hall in 1623 aged fourteen, and appears to have died very shortly afterwards. The second son, Alexander, followed his father into the Middle Temple in 1629, spent time abroad in the service of the states general of the United Provinces in the early 1630s, became a recruiter member of the Long Parliament, and was associated with the radical faction in county politics during the civil war. He died childless and unmarried some time before the Restoration. The third son, Anthony, is known only from a letter he wrote on 29 July 1633, saying: &#145;Let my miserable example make thee avoid all wicked and prodigal courses. I am now going out of England and doubtful I am whether ever I shall see any of you again&#146;  (C. J. Sawyer &amp; Co., catalogue no. 155, no. 71). The striking point about this letter is its recipient. It is not John Pym, but his youngest son, Charles, not yet born in 1614, and therefore still under nineteen in 1633. As their father grew more deeply embedded in the affairs of Providence Island and of parliament, Charles Pym appears to have become the human cement which held the family together. He was the recipient of aching letters from his sister Dorothy, suffering for about two months from toothache, or begging letters from his sister Katherine, who died unmarried in 1649, about the chances of buying second-hand virginals cheap. It was to Charles Pym that she wrote: &#145;Speake to my father to send me some money &hellip; for I want it very much you know there is no living without it&#146;  (ibid., no. 69). Such letters may help to understand why Charles Pym was so much more successful in Somerset county society than his father or his elder brother.<br>
<br>Philippa Pym, the eldest daughter, in 1625 married Thomas Symons of Whittlesford in Cambridgeshire, a cheerful man who ordered his tobacco pipes by the gross. He had a small adventure in the Providence Island Company, and was a member of the Cambridgeshire county committee at the beginning of the civil war, presumably to provide a link with his father-in-law. Dorothy, the middle daughter, was not married until 1641, when she married back into the Rous circle; her husband was Sir Francis Drake of Werrington. Pym, trying to keep up a new-found status, committed himself to paying a dowry of &pound;2300, but in the encumbered state to which Providence reduced him he did not pay it. Alexander Pym later had to mortgage Wollavington for it.<h2>
<a name="Estatemanagerandreceiverofcrownlands"></a>Estate manager and receiver of crown lands</h2>As Pym's financial difficulties increased during the 1630s, a slow change occurred in the management of the estate. At the beginning of Pym's ownership his manors were still recognizable village communities. The lessees normally lived on their tenements, and appeared at the manorial court with at least reasonable regularity. They might pay high fines and low rents, but they took manageable plots of land for a single occupier, and the level of rents made them still recognizably tenants.<br>
<br>In the upland manors of Cutcombe Mohun and Cutcombe Raleigh, on the edge of Exmoor, this pattern on the whole persisted. In the lowland country around Wollavington, on the edge of the levels and in cattle country, there was a tendency for some leases to be of very large plots of land, with an enormous fine and derisory rent. These leases necessarily implied subtenants, and the leases confined themselves to insisting that subtenancies must be registered with the manorial court. In return for the high fines, there was bargaining over the identity of the lessees, and one lease bears a note, probably by Pym's steward, &#145;all three lessees are children&#146;  (Pym MSS, Somerset Archive and Record Service, DD/BW, no. 212). In these cases, leases stress with increasing stridency a need to attend the manorial court, and to accept its decisions and pay fines imposed by it. The requirement to notify deaths of lessees to the manorial court is stated in increasingly draconian terms. One of them even invents a manorial version of the doctrine of <i>praemunire</i>, in that taking any case to any other court which ought to go to the manorial court leads to forfeiture of the tenement.<br>
<br>In this high-fine economy, a very fine line separates the lease from the mortgage. A lease of much of Wollavington to James Hayward, yeoman, for a fine of &pound;460 and a rent of 29<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., with a special clause forbidding Hayward to carry away the manure, comes close to this line. Hayward, presumably a grazier, was an up-and-coming man, and in the civil war he was a captain in the parliamentarian army alongside Pym's sons Charles and Alexander. A lease of 1626 to John Grabham, grazier, illiterate but employing counsel, for a fine of &pound;240 and a rent of 15<i>s</i>. for three lives, all of them children, is another out of the same stable. By 1634, when John Grabham took a much bigger lease for a fine of &pound;300, he is styled gent., but still illiterate. Such leases are still a minority, but they are the ones which financed Pym's political career, and made the fortunes of his leading tenants. If there was a &#145;rise of the middle classes&#146; going on during Pym's lifetime, he was not its beneficiary: he was its victim.<h2>
<a name="OnePymaReceiver"></a>One Pym, a Receiver</h2>When Pym first came to the attention of the newsletter writer John Chamberlain, in the parliament of 1621, he was characterized as &#145;one Pym, a Receiver&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, ed. N. E. MacClure, 2 vols., Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society, vol. 12, pts 1&#150;2, 1939, 2.412). His office as receiver of crown lands for Hampshire, Wiltshire, and Gloucestershire was his only office in the gift of the crown. He was originally granted the reversion to the office on 17 June 1605. Henry Audley, his predecessor, died on 18 November 1606 owing &pound;2000 of arrears to the crown, and Pym took up the office shortly afterwards. He held it until 16 July 1638, when he surrendered it to Bedford's former servant Robert Scawen. Attorney-General Bankes wrote a note on the dorse of the docket: &#145;Mr Pym hath surrendered his office&#146;  (Birmingham Central Library, Birmingham City Archives, Coventry MS, grants of offices, no. 596. What is notable about the placing of Bankes's comment on the dorse, and revealing a note of triumph, is that it was left where a messenger could read it.). As receiver Pym received a fee of &pound;100 per annum, supplemented by portage and poundage at 1 per cent of the money he handled. His income from office was supplemented, from 1608, by appointment as the queen's receiver, at a fee of &pound;149 without portage or poundage, and later by a similar appointment for the prince of Wales, and subsequently for Queen Henrietta Maria. Since this merely required him to collect rents from some of the manors for which he was already responsible, and to pay them to the queen instead of the king, it was a useful device for increasing salaries. His income from office, including occasional windfall payments such as &pound;400 for attending twenty-two meetings of the commission for disafforesting Blackmore and Pewsham Forest, and for keeping all its accounts, may have come to over &pound;300 per annum.<br>
<br>Pym's main duty was to collect the king's rents. In this task he unusually employed a printed form with blanks, on which he filled in the times at which people were to appear before him  (NRA, catalogue of Kingsmill MSS). He was occasionally employed on embarrassing business, as in 1621, when Cranfield sent him to dun William Herbert, earl of Pembroke, to his face for unpaid rent. Pym was regularly employed in delivering timber for the repair of the coastal forts, and knew at first hand what a parlous state of repair they were in. He was frequently employed in special commissions out of the exchequer, and investigated, for example, a remarkable story of waste of wood from Chute Forest and the New Forest. Pym made &pound;133 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. out of delivering in to the crown the receipts from massive wood sales conducted by the notorious patentee Sir Giles Mompesson, and exchanged rival memos with Mompesson about exchequer practice. Mompesson wanted to abolish receivers and give the business back to the exchequer, a view with which Pym of course disagreed. Pym had already encountered Mompesson through his patent for the licensing of inns, under which he had given a licence to the Unicorn at Wollavington. After the parliament of 1621, Pym took home one of Mompesson's inn licences, and kept it among his papers as a souvenir.<br>
<br>By far the most significant business for Pym's own career was the clearance and disafforestation of Blackmore and Pewsham Forest, in Wiltshire. This probably accounted for his first two elections to parliament, at Calne in 1621 and at Chippenham in 1624. Both boroughs had closed corporation franchises. At Chippenham, there were twelve members of the corporation, of whom seven voted for Pym and five for Sir Francis Popham. Of the twelve, six and the father of a seventh had recently taken leases from Pym of disafforested grounds in Blackmore and Pewsham. Moreover, Pym was vehemently defending the tenants in a magnificent row with Lionel Cranfield about terms of their leases. In the absence of a list of members of the Calne corporation, it is impossible to prove that the same thing happened there, but the probability is considerable. At Chippenham, which gave rise to an election dispute, the commoners were unanimously for Sir Francis Popham. They had the usual grievance about loss of rights of common, they had been restrained from taking wood from the forest, and the conversion to arable had closed the old line of the road from Chippenham to Devizes. For the commoners, involvement in the forest clearance is unlikely to have been an electoral asset. The project won Pym his only substantial patron in the government service, Lionel Cranfield, who was responsible for getting him out of prison after the parliament of 1621. In spite of the quarrel over the lease the relationship seems to have lasted until Cranfield's fall.<br>
<br>The row with Cranfield resulted from the fact that the terms of the leases had been agreed before the agricultural depression of 1620&#150;21, but the leases themselves were not to be signed until after it. On 22 August 1622 the commissioners advised Cranfield that the level of rents in the area had fallen by a fifth, and the ground was less good for agriculture than had been hoped. Robert Treswell, the king's woodward, one of the most active commissioners, wrote a private letter to Cranfield in support of this argument. Cranfield and Weston replied in typical treasury tones that they had been &#145;over-easy &hellip; to his Majesty's great disadvantage&#146;  (Sackville MSS, CKS, U269). Pym and Treswell replied that the leases had not been concluded since the treasurer and chancellor of the exchequer had not approved them before the depression, and that the tenants were unwilling to take them on these terms and could not be forced to do so. Cranfield recognized the inevitable and, having evicted one tenant to save face, reached compromises with the others.<br>
<br>At this stage, immediately after this hectic emphasis on the king's service, the king chose to grant the whole forest, at a rent below its rental excluding fines, to Christopher Villiers, earl of Anglesey. The conversion of what had been supposed to be a major project for increasing crown revenue into a Villiers relief project in favour of the duke of Buckingham's brother enabled Pym to make a substantial personal input into the impeachment of Buckingham. To Pym the need to preserve the king's revenue came second only to the need to combat popery. Indeed, since he regularly thought of combating popery in terms of powder and shot, as befitted one brought up by one of Drake's executors, the two needs were very closely related in his mind. Presenting the eleventh and twelfth articles of the duke's impeachment to the Lords in 1626, dealing with his enrichment of his kindred at the public expense, he said:<blockquote>This makes the Duke's offence the greater that in this weaknes and consumcon of the comon wealth he hath not byn content alone to consume the publique comon wealth treasure, wch is the bloode and nourishmt. of the state, but hath brought in others to help him in this worke of distruccion. And that they might do it more eagerly, by enlarging therie [<i>sic</i>] honor, he hath likewise enlarged therie necessities and therie appetites. (Hants. RO, Winchester, Jervoise MS O 7)</blockquote>As a comment on the evidence known to have been in Pym's possession, this cannot be called inaccurate.<h2>
<a name="PymofHampshire"></a>Pym of Hampshire</h2>During the 1620s Pym appears to have been trying to establish himself in Hampshire. He was assessed for the second subsidy of 1621 at Whitchurch, in Kingsclere division, at &pound;15 in lands. From 1621 to 1626 he responded to Hampshire assessments for subsidy with a certificate saying he was assessed in the parish of St Clement Danes in London where he ordinarily dwelt. His assessment was &pound;10 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. For the forced loan in 1626 he was assessed for two payments of &pound;10 each in the hundred and village of Wherwell, which was the address he gave on the marriage licence for the marriage of Philippa to Thomas Symonds, in February 1626.<br>
<br>Pym was previously thought to have paid the forced loan. What happened is rather more interesting. On 11 December 1626, his brother-in-law Henry Hooke sent to Sir Thomas Jervoise the money required of &#145;my brother Pym&#146;, and asked Jervoise to send Pym a receipt for it  (Hants. RO, Winchester, Jervoise MS O 21). On 26 December Pym wrote to Jervoise from Wherwell: &#145;though I conceive my brother Hooke payed this mony out of his desire of my safety, yet I fynde my selfe very hartely greved that he should write that I had sent it&#146;. He said he had returned Hooke his receipt, and begged Jervoise, if it was not too late, to get the record of his payment off the file. This letter has the unmistakable note of a seasoned man of business trying to combine the maximum possible trouble-making with the minimum possible discourtesy  (Hants. RO, Winchester, Jervoise MS O 12). In 1628 he was reported as defaulting for one horse for the musters at Whitchurch, where he probably no longer lived, and this is the last mention of him in Hampshire save for his work as receiver.<br>
<br>The certificates showing Pym to be living in St Clement Danes were perfectly genuine. He and William Cholmeley paid the surveyor's rates for Boswell's house in the duchy liberty of the Savoy from 1619&#150;20 until the account of 12 April 1626. In 1627&#150;8 there is a blank against their names, and thereafter they do not appear in the accounts. This lease predates his election to parliament, and it is possible that, being left with young children on the death of his wife, Pym relied on his sister Catherine to help to care for them. From 1621 to 1623 Pym also contributed to the churchwardens' rate and pew rate, and this provides an interesting sidelight on the level of his ecclesiastical tolerance before the rise of Arminianism. He worshipped at a church which kept two surplices. Where churches kept accounts for washing the surplice, the date for which it was washed is something of a thermometer between high and low. St Clement Danes washed the surplice for 5 November, which was about the lowest possible choice of date for which to wash it. The annual bellringings were for 5 November and for the king's delivery from the Gowrie conspiracy, which should have caused no trouble for a protestant conscience. However, the parish beat the bounds and tolled the passing bell for deaths, a habit rejected at neighbouring St Margaret's, Westminster. All this may have been rather high for Pym's tastes, and it does not appear to be the way things were done at Cannington or at Wherwell, but it does suggest, like much other evidence, that the central thrusts of Pym's religious passion were directed at the twin issues of predestination and anti-popery. It tends to lend credence to the report in the Commons journals of a sentence in his maiden speech, saying &#145;the exception against ceremonies now almost worn out, and scarce appeareth&#146;. It is not something Pym would have said a few years later, and he left it out of the report of the speech in his own diary, but it may for all that be a genuine statement of his mood of the moment  (<span class="italic">JHC, 1547&#150;1628</span>, 524).<h2>
<a name="ParliamentsunderJamesI"></a>Parliaments under James I</h2>Pym was perhaps the first Englishman who acquired a national reputation based on what he did in parliament. Yet like some others of equal stature in parliamentary history (Gladstone and Churchill, for example) he was not a particularly good politician according to conventional criteria. He once dried in a crucial speech at the close of the trial of the earl of Strafford, to the amusement of Robert Baillie. For every major performance he relied heavily on a written script, carefully altered and interlineated to the point where it becomes astonishing that he could read it. He could not respond to a debate, and adjust his position to its ebb and flow: his arguments emerged, like a regiment of tanks, fully armoured from his own head. Where he did not have a script, he usually confined himself to very brief procedural interventions. He was destitute of humour, and lacked the politician's crucial ability to read the mood of the house. On one occasion, unable to accept his failure to do so, he walked out in a huff. On another occasion, speaking on the bill against adultery in 1628, he raised what may have been the biggest belly-laugh of the decade at his expense by concluding his speech with the motion &#145;that we commit it&#146;  (Johnson and others, 3.26, 30).<br>
<br>What made Pym a successful parliamentary politician was his total inner certainty, and the emotional force this gave to his performances. He benefited from a curious incongruity which combined the meticulous attention to unemotional detail of a skilled accountant with the driving passion of a religious enthusiast. With this, he combined an Aristotelian tendency to philosophize which often enabled him to see far more general implications in a misdemeanour than others could do. It is the classic political ability to see all hell in a grain of sand. He also enjoyed a considerable intelligence, and an exceptional personal force. All this was backed up by a prodigious capacity for hard work. By 1626 his colleagues had learned that he was the man who could be left to write the report, and when he did, it usually contained passages taken verbatim from his own speeches. He also had a serious interest in parliamentary procedure, and put a lot of effort into being on the right side of successive speakers.<br>
<br>At first Pym was unknown to many of his parliamentary colleagues, and Sir Thomas Barrington once referred to him under the inappropriate name &#145;Mr Pope&#146;  (Notestein, Relf, and Simpson, 3.190). The first sign that he was acquiring a patron came with his return for Tavistock in 1624, the constituency for which he sat for the rest of his career. Since there is no evidence that he ever set foot in the constituency, Bedford's patronage is the only sensible interpretation of that return. What is striking is the effort he put in 1624 in trying to secure the disputed seat at Chippenham, to which he had been elected by his own efforts.<br>
<br>In 1628 Pym became an executor for Bedford's draft will, and he retained that position so long as there was a risk of Bedford's leaving minor heirs. His patron was not Edward, third earl of Bedford, but Francis, second Lord Russell of Thornhaugh, who had bought his predecessor out of the estates in 1617 and succeeded to the Bedford title in 1627. Pym also attracted the patronage of Robert Rich, earl of Warwick, possibly through Sir Nathaniel Rich, who became a close parliamentary collaborator. In November 1626 he became a feoffee to uses to Warwick, taking on a share of responsibility for managing Warwick's estate during his voyage of 1627, and for payment of his debts, which Warwick calculated at &pound;13,000. To put these debts in proportion Warwick's calculation of his income for 1634 should be considered. His certain rents he put at &pound;6447 17<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., and casualties at &pound;318 7<i>s</i>., giving a total income from land of &pound;6766 5<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. This puts his income from land, which was almost certainly smaller than Bedford's, at thirteen times a high estimate of Pym's.<br>
<br>Early seventeenth-century patrons did not normally operate a political whip, except on personal matters such as private bills or on highly sensitive matters such as the impeachment of Buckingham, where the only possible safety was in numbers. For people such as Pym the usual service was work, and the management of Warwick's estate during his absence, using his special skill as a receiver, was typical of what was wanted. His later post as treasurer of the Providence Island Company grew out of this tradition. It was the connection with Warwick which led Pym into his colonial interests; the beginning of the connection cannot be dated, but was certainly after 18 April 1621, when he proposed a total ban on tobacco  (<span class="italic">JHC, 1547&#150;1628</span>, 543).<br>
<br>Bedford, if he had left a wardship, would have drawn on Pym's same skills of land management. Meanwhile, his chief use for Pym seems to have been to satisfy his voracious appetite for information. Pym's parliamentary diaries for 1621, 1624, and 1625 were all in his possession, and he annotated them. Some of his comments, especially on the treatment of nonconforming ministers and impropriations in 1625, indicate strong disagreement with the line Pym was taking, but there is no evidence that he tried to restrain him.<br>
<br>In his first parliament, in 1621, Pym was only an occasional speaker, and many of his early speeches were on matters in which he was personally interested. Sir John Bennet had admitted his uncle William Pym's will to probate, and he had crossed swords with Sir Giles Mompesson. In that case, he put his accountancy skills to such good use that he helped to manage the charge, though William Hakewill, whom he was assisting, complained that he was &#145;no lawyer&#146;. His interest in the parliamentary representation of Ilchester and Minehead must have been obvious, and the case of Morgan, Bowdler, and Meggs was one in which his feoffee Sir Edward Wardour, also a member, was personally concerned.<br>
<br>The fact that Pym was &#145;no lawyer&#146;, and not attuned to the constitutional concerns, or the sense of honour, of many of the house, accounts for many of the occasions when he hit the wrong note. On 18 April, on the case of Sir John Bennet, he suggested that they should investigate whether he had taken bribes to do justice or to do injustice; Sir Edward Coke bluntly reminded him that it was a bribe in any case. On 21 April he again clashed with Coke and Edward Alford, who were calling for an act of parliament for suppression of a monopoly. Pym said the proclamation against it was good, &#145;which was not denyed, all the House sayth&#146;  (Notestein, Relf, and Simpson, 3.44). He learned, but there is truth in the remark that Pym's attachment to the law always had a certain intermittency about it  (Hexter, 194&#150;5).<br>
<br>Pym also made some remarkably significant contributions. In a speech of 20 April against Sir John Bennet he set out in full what was to become the procedure of impeachment. He said, in a characteristic phrase, &#145;the high court of Parliament is the great eye of the kingdom, to find out offences and punish them&#146;  (Notestein, Relf, and Simpson, 2.303). In his vision, the Commons were to keep control of the prosecution, the Lords of judgment, and the king of execution. On 15 May, in a remarkable anticipation of Rousseau, he said: &#145;Men accused heear cannot be condemned but by him selfe, all voyces being included heeard&#146;  (ibid., 3.264). It took him twenty years to make this vision a reality, but he succeeded.<br>
<br>Pym gained most notice for his speeches of 27 and 28 November on the foreign policy issue. He favoured war, but thought that without raids on the king of Spain's treasure in the West Indies it could not be financed. Characteristically, he was more interested in the home front, and thought that &#145;we are not secure enough at home in respect of the enemy at home which groes by the suspence of the lawes at home&#146;. The king received &#145;no redress by the subordinate ministers that he trusts&#146;. He proposed that every man take an oath of association &#145;or not be admitted into the commonwealth&#146;. He said papists broke the &#145;independency upon others&#146; which loyal subjects owed, and that the king, by mistaken lenity towards them, was hazarding the state. He offered a proposal, which looked far into his political future, for the execution of the recusancy laws to be entrusted to a commission including members of both houses of parliament (Notestein, Relf, and Simpson, 3.461&#150;2; Nicholas, 2.238; Notestein, Relf, and Simpson, 4.448). The attitude to the king echoes the remark of Simon de Montfort during the battle of Saintes in 1242: &#145;The King must be locked up until the battle is over, or we will lose&#146;. Neither king took the attitude kindly. The attitude to Rome might have been more in place in the year of Pym's birth, when Roman Catholics could be legitimately suspected of wanting to put Mary, queen of Scots on the throne, than it was in the year when the speech was delivered. Pym seems not to have seen the peace of 1604 as anything but a temporary truce. It was in this context that he placed his hatred of attacks on &#145;Puritans&#146;, which he thought alienated the king from his only loyal subjects. It was this Manichaean view of the world, concealed under the practicality of a man of business, which made him such a potentially dangerous enemy. In his proposal for a commission to execute the recusancy laws, he showed what was to be his driving conviction twenty years later, that it was the executive power which was in the supreme position, and no amount of parliamentary power could change the situation without getting a handle on it. He was in immediate trouble for this speech, and no doubt made things worse the next day by bravely saying he would ignore &#145;the whisperings of his own fortune&#146;  (ibid., 6.206). The imprisonment which followed the dissolution made him more careful, but more determined.<br>
<br>In 1624, the year of his quietest parliament, Pym gave full support to the breach of the treaties with Spain, saying that &#145;we have made one step from the greatest danger that ever threatened us, God grant that we relapse not again&#146;. He supported, almost alone, the king's full request for six subsidies and twelve fifteenths  (diary of Sir William Spring, Harvard U., Houghton L., 19 March 1624). He continued his hunt for recusants, including &#145;those who by their practice show what they are, as well as those that are convicted&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 18597, fol. 109b). Legal rights were not for fifth columns. He also began, in attacks on Richard Mountague and Samuel Harsnett, the attack on Arminian clergy which was to become his major theme of the 1620s.<h2>
<a name="ParliamentsunderCharlesI"></a>Parliaments under Charles I</h2>In the parliament of 1625 Pym gave priority to this religious business. He kept his head down about most of the contentious secular business, and confined himself to supporting Fleetwood's final move for compromise, on 8 August. Much of his time went on the preparation of the petition on religion, managed jointly by him and Sir Edwin Sandys. One of his phrases about the papists, from his offending speech of 27 November 1621, has passed almost unaltered into the petition: &#145;if they gayne but a connivencye, they will presse for a toleration; then strive for an equallitie, and lastly aspire to such a superioritye as may worke the extermination both of us and of our religion&#146;  (Gardiner, 19). He was responsible for most of the work of the committee on Richard Mountague and, though Heneage Finch delivered its report, it is easy to hear Pym's voice in the drafting of it. Unusually, this committee delivered a further report, which was delivered by Pym, to the next parliament, on 17 April 1626. In that, he directly charged Mountague with discouraging the well affected in religion, &#145;and to incline them, and as much as he can, to reconcile them, to popery&#146;. The two key points in this charge were Mountague's maintaining that Rome was a true church, and that it was possible to fall from grace  (ibid., 180). It is likely that Pym meant the charge of popery against the Arminians entirely literally. They were the fifth column in the pulpit.<br>
<br>For Pym the chief attraction of the rule of law was always that it guaranteed England's true protestant status. The area in which he most wanted to control the executive was always that of religion, to prevent it from either corrupting the doctrine of the Church of England, or subverting it by too much leniency to the popish enemy. When parliament met again, in 1626, Buckingham had just given his support to the Arminians at the York House conference. Pym therefore knew that attempts to subvert the religion of England were continuing with the consent of the chief minister, and the connivance, possibly unwitting, of the king.<br>
<br>Together with both his patrons, Bedford and Warwick, Pym committed himself wholeheartedly to the impeachment of Buckingham. From the beginning he linked this issue with that of the royal revenue. He supported Sir Nathaniel Rich's motion of 24 February to consider the king's revenue. He asked to consider &#145;confusion&#146; (no doubt a euphemism) by the king's officers  (Bidwell and Jansson, 2.116). Typically, he took the first chance to link the issues of protecting the revenue and of fighting the popish danger. On 1 March he used his accountant's skill to cut through a fog in the debate on the duke's alleged embezzlement of the goods from the captured French ship the <i>St Peter</i>. The issue was in danger of being lost in a difficult dispute about whether the <i>St Peter</i> was a lawful prize. Pym saw that that issue was irrelevant, and asked for the commissioners to be sent for to ask by what warrant they delivered the money of the king or the Frenchmen to the duke. It was the parliamentary question at its best: a straightforward request for information and lethally unanswerable. On 4 March he co-operated with Bedford to avoid a row between the houses about an unwise order of the Commons to send for Buckingham, made without the consent of the Lords. The Commons pretended, with the clerk's consent, that the order had been mistakenly entered, and altered it before there could be an official complaint.<br>
<br>Pym continued to show awareness of the need to limit executive power. On 14 April he reminded the king of James's promise in 1624 that he would not end the war by making peace without the advice of parliament. On the same day he gave strong support to Digges's proposal for a West India Company. Like the proposal for a commission to execute the recusancy laws, which he had offered in 1621, this was designed to delegate executive power to safe hands. It was in effect a proposal which looked towards the privatization of war, by allowing it to be conducted by a private company for prizes, rather than by the state out of inadequate taxation. The immediate model was clearly the Dutch West India Company, but some of the activities of Wallenstein in Germany, and the move towards funding war by <i>asiento</i>, or contract, in Spain, looked in the same direction. War was not merely too important to be left to the generals: it was too expensive to be left to the king. This was becoming an increasingly common note in Pym's thinking.<br>
<br>Pym's main business continued to be the committee for religion, from which he made fourteen reports. Most of these were part of a drive, on which Sandys had started him in 1625, to hunt down and exclude from teaching all the popish schoolmasters he could find. He also carried on the task of listing office-holders who were recusant, were married to recusants, or had recusants in their households. On 3 May he showed how utterly unpolitical his hatred of popery was by trying unsuccessfully to insist on including Thomas Howard, earl of Arundel, in the list of popish office-holders because he had two recusant servants. Arundel was not merely too big for this sort of treatment; he was also, along with Pembroke, one of the two principal backers of the impeachment of the duke within the privy council. Any attack on Arundel would have unravelled the uneasy coalition which made the impeachment of Buckingham possible, between Arundel's supporters who wanted to impeach Buckingham for being at war with Spain, and Pembroke's who wanted to impeach him for not doing it properly. Pym was overruled.<br>
<br>Pym's anxieties ratcheted up when the king reacted to the beginning of impeachment proceedings by trying to have Buckingham elected as chancellor of Cambridge University. Pym was clearly well informed on this issue, and probably got his information from his niece's husband Ralph Brownrigg, who was one of the organizers of the Cambridge Calvinists. On 3 June he drew the house's attention to the fact that the duke's campaign was being organized by men such as John Cosin, &#145;who have bene agents to utter Montagues book&#146;, and suggested that &#145;it may be to perfect a conspiracy to bring in Arminianism&#146; (Eaton Hall, Cheshire, diary of Sir Richard Grosvenor, fol. 148; Bidwell and Jansson, 3.352, 356). From then on, Pym knew that a creed which he regarded as popish was being promoted from within the heart of government, with the full knowledge of the king.<br>
<br>Among the speeches given in 1628, and to a lesser extent in 1625 and 1626, there is a difficulty in distinguishing Pym's from those of John Pyne, MP for Poole, who too was from Somerset. Even if Pyne is given the benefit of every doubt, 1628 was still Pym's most active session to date, and he made more speeches then than in all of his first three parliaments put together. For the first time he was thoroughly converted to the Cokeian version of the rule of law. On 25 March, right at the beginning, he acknowledged Coke as his source, and added a commitment to the Cokeian doctrine of the ancient constitution. On 25 April he committed himself to the theory of liberty as a birthright. On 26 April he opposed the Lords' proposed amendments to the petition of right, saying that &#145;for reason of state I desire it may never come amongst laws&#146;, and that bare confirmation would not suffice, because &#145;we have our liberties, but they have been broken by martial law&#146;  (Johnson and others, 3.107, 102, 111, 118). He joined in the specific condemnations of arbitrary imprisonment, forced loans, martial law, billeting, and the use of soldiers in England.<br>
<br>At the same time Pym tried not to block off avenues to any satisfactory compromise. He refused to make an issue of the king's demand that the house sit on Good Friday. As in 1625 he seconded the final motion for a compromise, in this case Rudyerd's motion that the king be asked for a second answer, but this time he was successful. He was not, however, prepared to take an inadequate compromise for form's sake. On 6 May he replied to a request that they should rely on the king's word by saying he was entirely willing to rely on the king's word, but the king had not said the right word. &#145;If he understood the laws he would not err&#146;  (Johnson and others, 3.282, 271, 276, 281&#150;2).<br>
<br>In a large report of 11 June Pym continued his attack on Richard Mountague. He repeated his charge that Mountague was &#145;drawing the subjects to popery and reconciling them to the see of Rome&#146;. He accused him of dividing the church in foreign parts from the Church of England, and complained of the rapidly widening meaning he and his allies were giving to the word &#145;Puritan&#146;:<blockquote>he layes the name of Puritans upon the King's subjects that are dutifull and honest subjects in trueth at first this word was given to them that severed themselves from the church but he sayes there are Puritans in heart and Puritanes in doctrine and under this name he comprehends some of our bpps.</blockquote>The house resolved to send the case to the Lords, but adjournment prevented them  (Johnson and others, 4.262, 238&#150;240).<br>
<br>Pym's biggest new contribution was in the attack on Roger Manwaring, vicar of St Giles-in-the-Fields, who had preached in the most arbitrary terms in defence of the forced loan. Pym summarized the case to the house on 14 May, and officially presented it to the Lords on 4 June. He said he &#145;strikes at the root of all government&#146; by supporting &#145;an absolute power not bounded by law&#146;. He brought &#145;spiritual poison offered to the ear of the King, appropriating omnipotency to princes&#146;. This was, more or less fully fledged, the concept of alteration of government which was to be the staple of Pym's Long Parliament impeachments. He said:<blockquote>First, that no alteracon of the forme of government in a state can be made without danger of ruyne of the state. Secondly, that these lawes did not growe by graunt of princes, nor by pragmatique sanction, but are fundamentall from the very originall of this kingdome, and are part of the essentiall constitution thereof.</blockquote>He charged him with &#145;conspiring with the Jesuits and the Church of Rome, to disturbe the government&#146;. There is no extant proof that Manwaring was an Arminian, but it appears that Pym believed he was, and that he intended to sweep aside law and parliaments because they stood in the way of the introduction of Arminianism (Johnson and others, 3.407&#150;10; Parl. Arch., Braye MS I, fols. 63b, 60b).<br>
<br>For Pym 1629 was probably his least successful session in parliament. The house's proceedings were dominated by two issues. One was the issue of tonnage and poundage and the customs farmers. The customs farmers had arrested John Rolle, a member of parliament, for not paying tonnage and poundage, which parliament had not yet confirmed, in spite of Pym's attempt to get them to do so before they rose in 1628. The group led by Pym, Rich, and Rous accepted that the king could not be made to punish the customs farmers for obeying his commands, thought that sooner or later he would have to be legally allowed tonnage and poundage, and wanted to give priority to the attack on Arminianism and popery. Sir John Eliot and John Selden, who led the demand for a fight on the question of punishing the customs farmers, had the better of it, and the house slid inexorably towards dissolution.<br>
<br>At the end of 1629 Pym was definitely not a leader of parliament. He was, perhaps, one of the twenty or so most important members, but he had staked his authority on a course the house would not accept, and shown the same fatal capacity to misjudge the mood of the house as he had shown in his first session, in 1621. His speech of 19 February, saying that &#145;the liberties of this House are inferior to the liberties of the kingdome, to determine the previledge of this House is but a meane matter, and the mayne end is to establishe possession of the subjects&#146;, may have been intellectually perfectly sound, but the phrase &#145;a meane matter&#146; showed the inability of the bad politician to suffer fools gladly. Rich tried to rescue him, but he was roundly damned by Eliot and Sir Francis Seymour, and comprehensively defeated  (Notestein and Relf, 156&#150;7).<br>
<br>One would not expect, looking at these exchanges, that when the house met again eleven years later this man would be unambiguously recognized as its spokesman and leading figure. It was not a position Pym had come anywhere near during the 1620s. The conclusion seems to follow inexorably that his rise to supremacy inside the house was the result of events which took place outside it.<h2>
<a name="Pymwithoutaparliament"></a>Pym without a parliament</h2>Among these events, the founding and development of the Providence Island Company must be one. There has been a long-standing belief that Pym contemplated emigration during the 1630s. The solid evidence on which this rests is Oliver St John's obituary tribute to Pym in the House of Commons. St John referred to him:<blockquote>having about 10 or 12 years since gotten up his estate about the town, fearing lest popery would overgrow this kingdom, intending to make some plantation in foreign parts where the profession of the Gospel might have a free course; in wch designe, and in using his best endeavours for the service of the Parlt.; both before the Parlt and since, he hath wasted his estate and his person. (BL, Add. MS 31116, fol. 99b)</blockquote>Coming from one of Pym's executors, the statement is authoritative in what it says, but it is somewhat lacking in precision. It does not actually say that Pym himself intended to emigrate. He did not sell his estate, though he certainly borrowed heavily on it. Moreover, the statement is self-interested, since it ends with a motion for money for Pym's heir, for whose debts most of St John's friends were bound.<br>
<br>During most of the early 1630s Pym was living in High Holborn, in the parish of St Andrew, alongside Sir Nathaniel Rich, William Fiennes, Viscount Saye and Sele, Robert Greville, Lord Brooke, Sir John Clotworthy, William Jessop, and, later, Samuel Hartlib. Informal meetings for planning must have been very easy. The Providence Island Company, formed in 1630, involved most of the key figures of the parliamentary leadership of 1640: Saye, Brooke, Warwick, Edward Montagu, Lord Mandeville, Henry Rich, earl of Holland, Sir Thomas Barrington, Sir Gilbert Gerrard, Sir Benjamin Rudyerd, Oliver St John, and Henry Darley. William Jessop, Warwick's servant, was secretary and Pym was treasurer. The conspicuous absentee was Bedford, whether because he was never quite of that political group, or because he was too careful of his money.<br>
<br>In this group Pym was socially and financially outclassed. He had to make a big effort to distinguish his status from that of William Jessop, Warwick's servant and the other working officer, and underlined the point by writing to him as &#145;Good Will&#146;  (Lancs. RO, Preston, Hulton MS 46/21). In 1630 Sir Thomas Barrington turned down a proposal to allow Pym to stay in Barrington Hall for the summer. By 1633, when he was better established, the Barringtons were using Pym as a feoffee to uses. In 1635 he was bound, along with Sir Gilbert Gerrard, Sir Benjamin Rudyerd, and Henry Darley, for Lord Brooke's debt to Lord Saye and Sele.<br>
<br>Such bonds became steadily more frequent. Early reports from Providence were encouraging, talking optimistically of fruit and tobacco, and calling it an island &#145;like the Eden of God&#146;. By 20 March 1637 the company was being told that it had already spent &pound;10,000 on defence, and another &pound;20,000 was urgently needed. The company was under-capitalized for this sort of debt. Most of its members had borrowed the money for their initial adventures, at &pound;1025 each, and borrowed further for the additional costs. Since they were all sureties for each other's debts, when the bonds were forfeit their debts all redoubled on each other, turning them into a collection of merchants of Venice. In September 1641 the Spanish capture of Providence deprived them of any hope of recovering this money.<br>
<br>The cat's cradle of debts which resulted can probably never be fully reconstructed. William Jessop in summer 1642 tried to calculate debts owed to the company. He brought out Pym's at &pound;1739 19<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>., second only to the debt owed by Lord Brooke, who could better afford to pay it. This was very far from the total debt owed by Pym, for which the estimate of &pound;10,000 offered to the House of Commons may well have been accurate. Since he no longer enjoyed any earnings from office, this means that he owed something in the region of twenty years' income. By any standard that is an unsustainable debt, and many of those who pressed for the House of Commons to undertake these debts were themselves bound for them. As late as 1652 Katherine Brooke reported that her brother William Greville still feared arrest for Pym's debts.<br>
<br>Landowners who run up debts of this order tend to quarrel with their heirs, and John Pym was no exception. In November 1634 he discovered that his heir, Alexander, had been borrowing money from Henry Darley, Richard Knightley, and others without telling his father. He instructed Alexander, who was with the English regiments in the service of the states general, not to come home, and not to reveal that they were reconciled, &#145;for if they ever take notice you are reconciled to me, I shall bring them to no reason&#146;. Alexander had shown his father up before his rich friends, and the resulting fury was to be expected. Alexander, who never married, may have remained angry for longer  (BL, Add. MS 11692, fol. 1).<br>
<br>Other business continued as usual. In July 1632 Pym wrote to the provost of King's College, Cambridge, casually dropping the information that he had just returned from staying with the earl of Warwick at Leighs, Essex and asking for a fellowship for Francis Rous (which he did not get). In 1632 he and Sir Dudley Digges jointly bought the wardship of Dudley Palmer, heir of Sir Anthony Palmer, an old friend and distant relation, for &pound;750. In 1638 Pym's children took refuge from the plague with one of his new friends, Sir Arthur Hesilrige. In 1637 he again enfeoffed his estates to use: his feoffees were Rudyerd, Richard Knightley, John Upton (a member of the Providence Island Company as well as of the Rous circle), Oliver St John, and John Graunt, clerk of the cheque, who combined membership of the company with running the king's messenger service.<br>
<br>In 1635 Gerrard credited Pym and Sir Nathaniel Rich with influencing the younger Vane towards emigration to New England. This is credible, if uncertain, and if Pym himself contemplated emigration, Saybrooke, where he was a patentee, is as likely to have been a destination as Providence. He was left a ring by Richard Sibbes, and it may have been admiration for Sibbes's preaching which induced him to send his younger son Charles to Lincoln's Inn instead of to the Middle Temple. Pym defaulted on his ship money assessments in Middlesex in 1636&#150;7 and 1637&#150;8, and appears on a list of people selected for distraint, alongside Sir Nathaniel Rich, who was over a year dead, as well as Sir Gilbert Gerrard and Lord Brooke.<br>
<br>Pym's relationship with Bedford was evidently undisturbed by all these developments. In 1633 Robert Scawen, who had been acting as lawyer for Bedford, drew up a chancery bill describing a massive quarrel with Bedford about the pay the latter had not given him. In a long description of the quarrel he records &#145;one Mr John Pym&#146; as being repeatedly called in to signify the earl's pleasure to him and to act as go-between in the resulting disputes. Pym, in his attempts to smooth things over, seems to have been acting in something very close to a menial capacity  (Alnwick Castle, Northumberland, MS Y III 2(4), envelope 7). It is tempting, but no more, to connect Pym's resigning his receivership in favour of Scawen with a belated conclusion of these negotiations.<br>
<br>It is easy to underestimate how difficult the requirement to attend church could become during the 1630s for a godly worshipper who did not own his own advowson. Pym is not recorded as ever having been associated with nonconformity, but the conformity he practised seems to have been what one of John Winthrop's correspondents called &#145;the old conformity&#146;, not the newer and more rigorous version required by the Laudians. At Cannington in Somerset the Elizabethan Pyms had had leave to build a pew on the site of the old high altar. That pew seems not to have survived disturbances whose basis was social jealousy, but it was not replaced by an altar. At Wollavington, where Pym probably more often resided, he became involved in 1639 in a chancery lawsuit with his vicar, Richard Prigge, about a glebe terrier and a tithe commutation agreement from the reign of Henry VIII. There is no record of any dispute involving worship, but Prigge had been appointed in 1626 by Sir John Sydenham, a pugnacious ceremonialist highly unlikely to appoint anyone congenial to Pym. Perhaps most ominously for Pym, in the tithe lawsuit the churchwardens, both Pym's tenants, sided with the vicar. At Wherwell, Matthew Nicholas, Sir Edward Nicholas's brother, got the prebend in 1634, and moved in and took the service. He reported trouble about the surplice, which some refractory persons took as the mark of the beast, and about coming to the rails. The vicar, he said, covertly supported the nonconformists, but after 1634 Wherwell was unlikely to remain a safe place for Pym to worship. At St Andrew's, Holborn, there was a lecturership. The previous lecturer had been suspected of seditious preaching, but cleared by Bishop George Mountain. John Wood, the lecturer in 1637, was described by Laud as &#145;a wild turbulent preacher, and formerly censured in the High Commission Court&#146;  (P. Seaver, <span class="italic">The Puritan Lectureships</span>, 1970, 258). The lights were going out here too.<br>
<br>This may be why, from about 1636, Pym spent much of his time with Richard Knightley (1593&#150;1639) of Fawsley in Northamptonshire. Fawsley was an ecclesiastical peculiar, wholly owned by Knightley, and the vicar was largely funded by a donation from Knightley which was voluntary and therefore capable of diversion. From about 1626 the vicar was the great Elizabethan veteran John Dod, a survivor of the classical movement who had been deprived by Bancroft as long ago as 1606. In 1630 Knightley entrusted Dod's private endowment to feoffees, who were Saye and Sele, Nathaniel Rich, John Crew, John Pym &#145;of London&#146;, and Christopher Sherland, recorder of Northampton.<br>
<br>After 1636, when Pym reported that he had been in the country or was going there, Fawsley was, apparently, usually the place involved. In September 1639 he reported to Samuel Hartlib that he intended to stay at Fawsley all term. Much of what is known of him in this period comes from the Hartlib papers. They contain many impressions of sympathy from Pym and, while these are no doubt genuine, Pym's correspondence with Hartlib shows that there were two things he badly wanted from him. One was continental political intelligence: Hartlib wrote a regular newsletter, for which Pym on 30 September 1639 paid Ralph Brownrigg's subscription as well as his own. The other thing Pym wanted desperately was the service of Christopher de Bergh, a Moravian drainage engineer who was a friend of Hartlib: the coalmine, at Bedworth near Coventry, run by Knightley, Pym, and others, was costing &pound;1500 a year or more for drainage, with twelve horses working day and night. Once again Pym had shown skill in making influential friends, and a genius for losing money. That is the story of Pym in the 1630s.<h2>
<a name="Scotsandparliaments"></a>Scots and parliaments</h2>When parliament reassembled in April 1640 Edmund Rossingham the newsletter writer was asked for a copy of the grievances of the parliament, and replied by sending a text of Pym's opening speech. This is an immediate recognition of a status Pym had been nowhere near on 2 March 1629, when parliament had last sat. There were three important reasons for this change. The first was that there was a remarkably low survival rate among those who had been the most prominent members of the Commons in the 1620s. Sir Edward Coke, Sir Edwin Sandys, Sir Robert Phelips, Sir Dudley Digges, Sir John Eliot, William Noy, and Sir Nathaniel Rich were dead. Thomas Wentworth and Edward Littleton had been promoted in the king's service, the former now earl of Strafford, and William Hakewill had ceased to sit. Of the top twenty of 1629, only Pym and Sir Francis Seymour still sat.<br>
<br>In 1629 Seymour had probably been the more influential of the two. In the Short Parliament of 1640 this picture was reversed. This is partly because Pym spoke throughout for the group Sir Edward Nicholas described as &#145;Pym's junto&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/472/45), who were roughly those identified here, with the important addition of Robert Devereux, earl of Essex. The energy devoted to copying Pym's set speeches and distributing copies around the country has left traces in many archives. The third reason was a change in the mood of the house. Pym was always most influential in a house which was thoroughly alarmed, and he experienced this from 1640 in a way in which he had rarely experienced it in the 1620s.<br>
<br>The opening speech, of 17 April, was made in tandem with Francis Rous. Rous, who came first, made the key charge that &#145;the roote of all or grievances I thinke to be an intended union betwist us and Rome&#146;, and Pym undertook the charge of pulling all the miscellaneous grievances of the 1630s together under this heading  (Cope, 146). It was almost certainly the object of Pym's group, as Oliver St John later told the earl of Clarendon, to ensure that the parliament should fail. The king's object was to secure supply to fight the Scottish covenanters. For Pym the prospect of armed foreign help was the only thing which gave him any hope of success against a king he knew to be implacably opposed to everything he wanted. He thus had to prevent an agreement while appearing to be working for one. This meant always introducing a new demand when agreement seemed possible. On 2 May he added a new issue by demanding that any settlement must require an act of parliament giving legal authority to the militia and military charges. Since the Marian <span class="roman">Militia Act</span> had lapsed in 1604 the need was a real one, and Pym had addressed it constructively in 1628. However, since Charles was known to believe that the prerogative was a sufficient basis for the militia, the issue was an obstacle to agreement. To make certain, Pym may have been responsible for encouraging a story which spread at the very end of the parliament, that the Commons were about to investigate the grievances of the Scots, which was <i>ultra vires</i> as well as offensive to the king. This may explain the disorderly haste of the king's dissolution on 5 May.<br>
<br>During the summer of 1640, when there was no parliament in session, the junto seem to have kept communication with the Scots open. Their next public move was the drafting of the petition of the twelve peers, calling for the summons of a parliament and &#145;uniting of both your realms against the common enemies of the reformed religion&#146;. The petition was drawn up at Bedford House in the Strand, closely watched by the secretary of state, Sir Francis Windebank, who was a near neighbour and Bedford's tenant in Drury Lane. Windebank observed the presence of Pym and Hampden, and the petition is believed to have been written by Pym and Oliver St John. It immediately went to the Scots, who had crossed the Tyne and defeated the English army on the same day. With it went a good deal of political advice from &#145;N. F.&#146;, probably Saye's son Nathaniel Fiennes. The Scottish petition of 4 September, their response to this advice, which survives in a copy in Pym's papers, indicates a close working relationship. That relationship was founded on common interest, and lasted through the winter of 1640&#150;41. The Scottish covenanters had defeated the English twice, and occupied Northumberland and Durham. Yet they knew they could not count on winning a third time, and they needed the English parliament as guarantors of any Scottish peace settlement. Equally, the English knew that without a Scottish army in the field, there would not be a parliament at all. Mutual need could not be much greater.<br>
<br>This commitment to the Scottish alliance lasted for the rest of Pym's life. He had understood by November 1621 that success in any parliamentary enterprise lay not in the raising of a parliamentary majority, but in persuading the king. The more reluctant the king proved, the bigger the inverted commas needed round the word &#145;persuading&#146;. By 1640 it was clear that Charles was as reluctant to accept Pym's religion as Mary, queen of Scots, had been to accept the religion of John Knox. The help Scottish protestants had then had from the English, English protestants now needed from the Scots.<br>
<br>Before the Long Parliament met on 3 November 1640 Pym had also cemented an alliance with the French ambassador, who observed that this parliament would be different from all previous ones, because the king could not dissolve it without risking losing England. It was the Scots' success in depriving Charles of the trump card of the power of dissolution which was the centre of Pym's strategy up to the king's treaty with the Scots of 7 September 1641. On 7 November 1640 Pym again opened serious proceedings with a speech two hours long, claiming there was a design of papists to alter law and religion, which were so necessarily joined, &#145;that with the one, the other falls&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Clarendon 19, no. 1448).<br>
<br>Up to January 1641 the main objective was to bring the king, still punch-drunk after the English defeat at Newburn, to realize that he needed to undertake serious negotiations before he could get the Scottish army to leave England. Between the junto and the Scottish commissioners, who were in London to negotiate the treaty, there was regular social contact. The Scots, even more than the English, were determined to get rid of Strafford as part of a settlement. He was known to want Scotland to be annexed as a province of England, and he was the only councillor who had publicly argued for continuing the war after Newburn. His disappearance from office was necessary as a mark of the king's abandonment of the policies for which he had stood. When impeachment proceedings were begun against him, it was in response to demands from all three kingdoms, with Pym acting as co-ordinator between them. Because they wanted frequent English parliaments as a guarantee of Anglo-Scottish peace, the Scots also joined with Pym in wanting a triennial act for England.<br>
<br>In terms of serious politics it was necessary to mark time until the middle of January 1641, when the king realized that it was necessary to start serious negotiation if he was ever to change his situation. From the middle of January to the first week of March 1641 politics were dominated by the need to try to negotiate a settlement. For the king it was an obvious chance to try to divide the Anglo-Scottish alliance. For the Scots the two essentials were the abolition of bishops in England, so that pressure for harmonization should no longer lead Charles to press for a Laudian church in Scotland, and a long-term place in the sun for parliaments in England, which would enable them to be guarantors of Anglo-Scottish peace. For the king the essentials were an adequate revenue, the survival of bishops, who were his machinery for governing the church, and the life of Strafford. For Pym the essentials were the abolition of Arminianism and popery, an adequate revenue, and security against a comeback by an angry king some years later. His essentials probably did not include the abolition of bishops if it were possible to ensure that Charles did not appoint them.<br>
<br>Granted willingness to compromise, there was a serious possibility of a low-level settlement between Charles and the Scots, or of one between Charles and the junto. The chance of a settlement involving all three was always going to be slender because the issues of Strafford and bishops stood in the way. The terms on which Charles negotiated from the middle of January onwards might have been designed to divide the junto from the Scots.<br>
<br>On money, a good deal of progress was made on paper. The plan was for Bedford to be made lord treasurer, with Pym as chancellor of the exchequer. The plans worked out became the nucleus of the Restoration financial settlement, where they proved to be adequate for a generation. The big problem would have been getting the assent of the House of Commons, and the rest of the settlement never became far enough advanced for that task to be seriously attempted.<br>
<br>On religion, Charles began negotiations with James Ussher, archbishop of Armagh, who happened to be in London giving a series of lectures in Bedford's parish church at St Paul's, Covent Garden. With Ussher came Richard Holdsworth, vice-chancellor of Cambridge University, and Ralph Brownrigg, Pym's relative and ally. These people could have run a church in which Pym a few years earlier would have been perfectly happy. They were the core of the Calvinist episcopalian cause. They were, on the other hand, utterly unacceptable to the Scots. A deal of this sort could have been had only by giving up the Scottish security which would have made Pym feel safe to adopt it. It would also have alienated the network of London ministers who were the third leg of the junto's political organization.<br>
<br>During February 1641 many of the Londoners who were lending to finance the Scottish army's stay in England refused to lend further until they had justice on the earl of Strafford. Pym, in desperation, proposed on 20 February to compel them to lend. This was followed by the Scots' paper of 24 February which insisted on abolition of episcopacy in England and the death of Strafford. These were non-negotiable terms for Charles, and the Scottish commissioners in London grew less bold when advised that the Scottish army in Newcastle had not enough money to march south.<br>
<br>The settlement was probably dead from this moment. If there had been any doubt, it would have been removed by the issue of the queen's Catholic servants. Pym had already been in trouble for the proposal that Catholics should be forced to wear a distinctive mark of dress, which the French ambassador said was rejected by &#145;tout le monde&#146;  (Russell, <span class="italic">Fall</span>, 177). He and the Commons then proposed that the queen, marriage treaty notwithstanding, should be deprived of all her Catholic servants. Bedford, from the Lords, told them they could not do this. Pym refused to back down, saying &#145;that we ought to obey God rather than man, and that if we doe not prefer God before man, he will refuse us, with many other good notions&#146;  (ibid., 267). This was something with which neither Charles nor Henrietta Maria could live.<br>
<br>The issue of Strafford became as divisive. As Strafford himself appreciated, the debate became so heated because the king would not let him leave office, and therefore refused to signal his renunciation of the policies associated with him. For the Scots Strafford's survival was incompatible with a secure peace. Pym may have been encouraged to feel the same because he had come into possession of Strafford's letter to Olivares of 18 July 1640, asking for Spanish help to Charles in the second bishops' war. It is interesting that he never used this letter in public. He was also facing strong pressure from behind him in the House of Commons. The switch from impeachment to attainder was introduced against his opposition, and was designed to block the royal power of pardon by specifying the penalty of death in the bill, which the king could not amend. Even more tension was created when, in the last few days before Strafford's condemnation, it emerged that the king had entered into the army plot, designed to rescue Strafford by force and possibly to bring about a forcible dissolution of parliament. It is possible that it was this revelation of the king's readiness to fight rather than settle which finally made Pym irreconcilable. There is no evidence of serious negotiation between Pym and the king after this date.<br>
<br>The failure of the plans for settlement revealed the intellectual limitations of the junto. Their basic outlook was in line with previous baronial leaderships from Simon de Montfort onwards. They planned to have authority exercised in the king's name by a series of commissions given to people the parliament would have cause to confide in. They freely used precedents taken from royal minorities, but they could not envisage any authority which was not exercised in the king's name. They never contemplated government being carried on by a parliament as a force independent of the king. They were right, since no parliament could sit except by royal writ. They could not turn to the regular recourse of a pretender, since there was none available. Their only hope was, in Lord Brooke's words, &#145;to reduce the King to a necessity of granting&#146;  (Russell, <span class="italic">Fall</span>, 274&#150;5).<br>
<br>Without the Scots, whose departure was foreseeable from May 1641 onwards, this was going to be extremely difficult. Pym, as always, was prepared to use money to buy concessions in religion. The two bills he kept linked during the summer of 1641 were for tonnage and poundage and &#145;root and branch&#146;. The <span class="roman">Root and Branch Bill</span> would have abolished bishops, not in order to set up a Scottish church, but to set up one governed by lay commissioners very much along the lines of the triers and ejectors of the protectorate. It would have achieved the key objective of taking control of the church out of Charles's hands, but not the key Scottish objective of a church governed by an assembly of elected ministers. Tonnage and poundage was granted through the summer in temporary bills for a few weeks at a time. It was to be made permanent when they had perfected a new book of rates. The sum at stake was no less than &pound;482,000 per annum. The need for a book of rates was genuine, but it was understood that action would not be taken until the king accepted root and branch. It was a powerful strategy, but Pym did not understand that Charles's religion was no more for sale than his own. In the ten propositions of June 1641 Pym proposed to anticipate the militia ordinance by having lords lieutenant and deputy lieutenants nominated by the parliament, though his own allies refused to back him in this. He also wanted great officers chosen with the approval of the parliament, and the queen to be attended by nobles appointed by the parliament, with &#145;competent guards&#146;. Not since the insanity of Henry VI had an adult king been so restricted. Yet the dissolution of the parliament, which could not be put off indefinitely, could make all these measures vanish in a puff of smoke. On 10 August 1641 the king's departure for Edinburgh to conclude the treaty with the Scots behind the parliament's back made that event look uncomfortably near. It is true that since the army plot there was an act of parliament requiring parliament's consent to dissolve it. After so long a sitting that was not likely to be difficult to get, and if there had been any doubt, the appearance of plague in London would have removed it. Sir Edward Nicholas was realistic in his expectation that as soon as the Scots returned home, &#145;those that have depended upon them will &hellip; fall flat&#146;  (Russell, <span class="italic">Fall</span>, 304).<br>
<br>Meanwhile Pym tried to use the moment to change as much as possible. He was largely responsible for the Commons' order of 8 September ordering the destruction of altars, rails, crucifixes, and other monuments of superstition. This put the Commons on a collision course with the Lords, who issued a contrary order to observe the law as it stood. It also involved treating an order of the Commons as if it were an act passed by king, Lords, and Commons. This order did a great deal to export the crisis atmosphere of Westminster to the parishes.<br>
<br>From 8 September to 20 October the Commons adjourned for an overdue recess, while adopting an innovation Pym had proposed in 1621, that of leaving a standing committee in session during the recess. This was more important than many more headline measures, since it ended the situation whereby parliaments ceased to have any part in politics on the day they adjourned.<br>
<br>When the houses returned the king, to Nicholas's despair, was still away in Scotland, and no date was fixed for his return. He seems to have overreached himself in the &#145;incident&#146;, a plot to kidnap Archibald Campbell, earl of Argyll, and James Hamilton, marquess of Hamilton. Charles gave his English servants no account of the &#145;incident&#146;, perhaps because there was none he could honourably give. Pym had no such inhibitions. He persuaded the Lords that the &#145;incident&#146; was likely to be part of a design involving both kingdoms, and that this justified the parliament at Westminster in having a guard. It is easy to underrate how far Pym's policy after the army plot and the death of Strafford was driven by simple physical fear of royal retaliation. He also persuaded the Lords that the peace of the kingdoms was indivisible, and that they should offer their support to suppress any who tried to break the peace of Scotland or the recent treaty between the kingdoms. He was offering to the covenanters to return the favour of 1640, and already looking towards the solemn league and covenant of 1643.<br>
<br>On 1 November, well before the king returned, dissolution or adjournment ceased to be a practical possibility on the arrival of news of a major uprising in Ireland. This raised the stakes significantly by introducing the issue of raising armed force. This was dangerous not merely because no unquestionably legal method of raising armed force existed, but also because many members, and Pym most of all, were afraid to put armed force into the hands of a king they thought likely to use it to kill them. On 9 November he told the Lords at a conference that the Irish rising was the result of a popish conspiracy, that that conspiracy was favoured by some &#145;who have been admitted into very near places of counsel and authority&#146; about the king, and that he feared some such attempt by the papists in England. He added that &#145;diseases which proceed from the inward parts, as the liver, the heart or the brains, the more noble parts, it is a hard thing to apply cure to such diseases&#146;  (Russell, <span class="italic">Fall</span>, 419). The reference to diseases of the brain was not accidental: he repeated it on 25 January 1642. The casting of suspicion on the king was obvious, but impossible to reply to. From then on his objective was to ensure that any forces sent to Ireland should be under either Scottish or parliamentary control. This was pursued first through the additional instruction to the parliament's committee in Scotland, and then through the militia ordinance. Pym's key Irish objective, that popery should never be tolerated there, showed a lack of realism reminiscent of Charles's attempts to enforce the prayer book in Scotland.<br>
<br>With the drive for the militia ordinance came a drive to win a majority in the House of Lords by excluding the popish lords and the bishops. There was never, all the way through the civil war, any possibility of the Lords' excluding the popish lords: they might be popish, but they were peers. The bishops were a more doubtful case, and over Christmas 1641 the Lords were surrounded by crowds demonstrating against the bishops. When, in February 1642, the king finally agreed to their exclusion, the Commons asked the London ministers to restrain the crowds, and they disappeared immediately. The passing of the grand remonstrance, timed to come immediately before the king's belated return on 25 November, was designed very largely to help in raising the temperature on the London streets.<br>
<br>The king's response to these escalating threats was to publish articles accusing Pym, John Hampden, Sir Arthur Hesilrige, Denzil Holles, and William Strode, and with them Lord Mandeville, of high treason. Mandeville faced out the accusation in the Lords and offered to stand trial, but the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94998', "five members")</script> of the Commons went to ground. On 4 January 1642 they took their seats in the Commons, and the king, as he was perhaps meant to do, went to the house with an armed guard to arrest them. He had omitted to guard the river, by which the members made a last-minute escape. By a brilliant exercise in propaganda, the Commons turned this attempt on the five members into an armed assault on the whole of the Commons, and Charles's reputation never recovered. Almost at the same moment, the newly elected common council took office in the City, and delivered control of the City trained bands into hands favourable to Pym. Charles had lost military control of his capital, and did not return until he was brought back to stand trial for his life.<br>
<br>For Pym the victory was pyrrhic, and had led him only into a new stage of deadlock. If he showed any willingness to fight the king, all the support he was enjoying would evaporate, and if he did not, he could only enjoy stalemate until the wheel of fortune turned, as it was almost bound to do. Serious negotiation, which had been unlikely ever since the army plot, was unthinkable now. Pym was not the sort to trust his life to a man he believed intended to kill him if he could. Clarendon is clearly right that after the attempt on the five members he had no thought of moderation.<h2>
<a name="ThewartheScottishallianceanddeath"></a>The war, the Scottish alliance, and death</h2>What then were Pym's objectives after January 1642? He appears to have had two. One was to provoke Charles further into overreacting, giving Pym himself the excuse of claiming he was fighting in self-defence. This was the only reason for fighting the king a respectable protestant could afford to give in public. Pym almost certainly knew the alternative tradition of protestant resistance theory, but he was far too good a politician to reveal what he thought of it; like adultery, this was something to which no wise man admitted in public. Fortunately, the strategy of provoking Charles into overreacting was one in which Charles could be counted on to co-operate. In his attempt to seize the arsenal at Hull in April, and in raising his standard at Nottingham in August, Charles duly obliged.<br>
<br>There was still no chance of a pretender. Charles had taken the elector palatine Charles Lewis with him into the Commons to arrest the five members, and took him with him to the gates of Hull. These actions would have made him unacceptable as a pretender, even if he had been willing. There remained outside help. Pym could usually count on discreet sympathy from the French ambassador, who had warned the five members the king was coming to arrest them. Yet at the crisis of the Thirty Years' War, serious help from France or anywhere else on the continent was unthinkable: the crisis of manpower was too serious. There remained only Scotland.<br>
<br>When Charles had concluded the treaty with Scotland, he had exacted from John Campbell, earl of Loudoun, from Argyll, and probably from others also, promises not to meddle in the internal affairs of England. Almost immediately on his departure from London, Charles wrote to Loudoun, now lord chancellor of Scotland, to remind him of his promise. Loudoun, in reply, reminded Charles that he had already broken the Scottish peace treaty. When he charged the five members with treasonable correspondence with the Scots, Charles had forgotten that he was breaking the <span class="roman">Act of Oblivion</span>, which had been a key part of the treaty. Loudoun had not. It was impossible to open up that correspondence without threatening those at its Scottish end as much as at the English end. There were already Scottish commissioners in London, involved in the suppression of the Irish rising. Pym, Hampden, and Rous pursued friendship with these commissioners with a dedication they had not shown since the winter of 1640.<br>
<br>Through the spring and summer of 1642 Pym's efforts were devoted to the measures for further reformation of religion whose absence had dismayed the Scots in the spring of 1641. Francis Rous took up the Scottish proposal for an English general assembly, which was to produce a common confession of faith for the two kingdoms. It was to settle church government, get rid of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, ensure discipline, and do all those things which warmed the hearts of Scottish ministers and chilled those of English gentry. It was a risky strategy, for every increase in Pym's Scottish friends was also an increase in his English enemies. It was not until his two declarations of 10 September 1642, after Charles had raised his standard, that Pym burnt his boats for this strategy, assuring the Scottish privy council he agreed with them about prelacy, and the Scottish general assembly that some of their number would be appointed to the Westminster assembly. The Scots had already burnt their fingers trusting English promises, and it took a long time to secure their final agreement to the solemn league and covenant, which arguably turned the course of the English civil war.<br>
<br>In creating an administrative machine to run the parliamentarian war effort, Pym was at his best. He built up a system of standing committees at Westminster, and of county committees in the country, which worked. He and others succeeded, as he had not in 1641, in introducing the excise. In the politics of war he showed a firm allegiance to the earl of Essex as parliamentarian commander-in-chief. Essex was a man whose political advantages matched his military disadvantages, and the support for him was what might have been expected, not only of a servant of the junto, now much damaged by the strains of war, but of a political ally of the Scots.<br>
<br>Pym died, presumably in London, on 8 December 1643, before the times which sorted the Scottish sheep from the New England goats among the parliamentarian ranks, but the evidence, such as it is, suggests that his sympathies might have gone with Essex and Holles rather than with St John and Saye. This is thin ice, and no weight should be placed on it. His death, which was attributed to a &#145;large abcesse or impostume&#146;, may have been from cancer of the bowel  (<span class="italic">Narrative</span>, 3).<br>
<br>In being led into civil war, Pym had suffered a defeat. He had bargained for a coercive settlement with Charles I which was not available. There is no reason to think he was any better provided with a strategy for handling victory than his colleagues were. His vision of authority, like that of Saye or the earl of Manchester (the former Lord Mandeville), always depended on the existence of a lawful king as a name in which power could be put into commission. In his crucial failure to appreciate that the king's dedication to his religion was as strong as his own, Pym failed to achieve policies for the situation in which he actually found himself. Longer life could only have exposed this limitation more cruelly than during his life.<br>
<br>Pym's funeral sermon was preached by Stephen Marshall, who claimed that his mastery of his papers was achieved by regularly beginning work at three in the morning. Pym left a will, which does not appear to survive, but it is known from many other sources that his executors were: Oliver St John, Sir Benjamin Rudyerd, John Crew (who had been Richard Knightley's executor), Francis Rous, Anthony Nicoll, and his heir, Alexander Pym. Their struggle to collect some of the money the House of Commons voted to pay Pym's debts is a story too long to tell here. They saved the estate from major sales, but not from mortgages. By 1670 it was approaching recovery from its former owner's political exploits. Pym was given a ceremonial funeral and was buried in the Henry VII chapel in Westminster Abbey on 15 December 1643. After the Restoration, it was decided that the burial was unauthorized, and the body was dug up and flung into the ditch.<br>
