<span class="headword">William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1075), <span class="occ">bishop of London</span>, is likely, to judge by his name, to have originated in Flanders, northern France, or Lotharingia. By 1051 he was one of Edward the Confessor's chaplains, and may have entered Edward's service before 1050, since he occurs as king's priest in the witness lists of three diplomata which, though suspect, may well have made use of a genuine witness list of the year 1050. When Edward promoted Robert of Jumi&egrave;ges from the see of London to the archbishopric of Canterbury, he sought at first to replace Robert with Spearhafoc, abbot of Abingdon, but Robert refused to consecrate Spearhafoc, claiming papal support for his stance. Instead, in the autumn of 1051, Edward gave the see of London to his chaplain William, who was then consecrated by Robert. The extent to which the latter was involved in William's appointment is unknown, but William certainly found himself attached to Robert's faction in 1052 when Robert's opponent, the rebellious Earl Godwine, and his party returned from exile. Late in that year he joined the flight overseas of Robert and Bishop Ulf of Dorchester. William was clearly less distasteful to Godwine and his faction than the other two prelates and he was allowed to return&#151;by the early months of 1053, if Edward the Confessor's <span class="roman">Moulsham writ</span> for Westminster is genuine.<br>
<br>Between 1053 and 1055 William witnessed the transaction by which the church of Stow in Lincolnshire was re-endowed. He travelled to Flanders in 1060, when in mid-May he is to be found in the company of the count of Flanders and the bishop of Terwaan (Th&eacute;rouanne). He assisted at the consecration of Lanfranc on 29 August 1070 and attended the Whitsunday council at Windsor in 1072 and the Council of London in 1075. These two councils fixed the position of London within the hierarchy of dioceses in the province of Canterbury as second only to Canterbury. As bishop of London, William succeeded in augmenting the church's estates after 1066, when William I allowed him to win back Layer, Southminster, and Warley in Essex and to buy Thorley in Hertfordshire. It is likely also that William was the bishop of London who purchased the numerous small manors in Essex which are listed under a separate heading in the <span class="roman">Domesday</span> returns (the <i>feudum</i> of the bishop of London as opposed to the <i>terra</i> or long-established lands of the bishop). Already by 1066 there was a fairly clear division between the lands held by the chapter, some of which were subdivided into separate holdings for some of the canons, and the lands held by the bishop, and William, if not himself responsible for this system, must at least have encouraged its perpetuation. No charters issued by him survive. He died in 1075, but the precise date is not recorded, nor is his place of burial.<br>
