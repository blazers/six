<span class="headword">Lee,  Elizabeth</span>  (1857/8&#150;1920), <span class="occ">biographer and translator</span>, was born in Keppel Street, Russell Square, London, the daughter of Lazarus Lee (<i>b</i>. 1824/5), who dealt in ostrich feathers, and his wife, Jessie Davis (<i>b</i>. 1836/7). She was one of at least six children. Her family was Jewish, and had changed its name from Levi to Lee in mid-century. Her brother Solomon Lazarus also changed his forenames and as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34470/', "Sidney Lee")</script> became second editor of the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. Lazarus Lee was ambitious for his six children: Sidney was educated at the City of London School and Balliol College, Oxford, and Elizabeth at Queen's College, Harley Street, London, where she studied literature under its principal, the Revd Edward Hayes Plumptre. She travelled in France and Germany, studying languages and educational methods. She became a girls' secondary school English teacher, an editor, a translator of French and German literature and history, minor biographer, and compiler of school texts on literature, history, and art. She wrote articles for monthly magazines, notably <span class="italic">The Library</span>, and many articles for the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. She was secretary of the English Association (1907&#150;12), where she worked with Sir Arthur Acland, A. C. Bradley, and Frederic Boase. Her English Association leaflet <span class="italic">The Teaching of Literature in French and German Secondary Schools</span> (1907) was recognized by her appointment as officier d'Acad&eacute;mie by the French ministry of public affairs.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Lee's career as a minor woman of letters was not unconnected to the circles in which her brother Sidney moved. Three factors in his life are crucial to understanding her work because of the opportunities they created: his interest in Shakespeare, his friends and associates and their publishing connections, and his involvement with the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. At Oxford he had published two articles that attracted the attention of Frederick James Furnivall, the Shakespeare and early English texts scholar, who recommended him to Leslie Stephen when the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> project began. Another Shakespeare scholar and publisher, Arthur Henry Bullen, was at school and at Oxford with Lee. Elizabeth Lee's first published translation was <span class="italic">The English Novel in the Time of Shakespeare</span> (1890), from the work by Jean Jules Jusserand. Over the next thirty years she wrote, edited, translated, and contributed to another thirty books&#151;most notably a biography, <span class="italic">Ouida</span> (1914), schools editions of the poetry of Thomas Gray, Oliver Goldsmith, and William Cowper, and selections from Thomas Carlyle and George Eliot. She translated Lucien L&eacute;vy-Bruhl's <span class="italic">Ethics and Moral Science</span> (1905), Petri Rosegger's <span class="italic">A Prisoner's Story of the Cross</span> (1905), and Georg Enge's <span class="italic">The Philosopher and the Foundling</span> (1906).<br>
<br>After Sidney Lee became editor of the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> Elizabeth contributed 110 articles: 67 to the first series (1885&#150;1900), 14 in the supplements published in 1901, and 29 in the supplement for 1901&#150;11. All but nine of her articles are on women. Of the 81 articles she wrote between 1892 and 1901, 79 are on women. She was not listed as a contributor until October 1892 (Sidney Lee had become sole editor in June 1891), though it is possible that she had been writing articles under her brother's name for some years before. It is noteworthy that Sidney had written twenty-two articles on women subjects in the twenty-seven volumes that appeared up to 1891, but only six in the thirty-six volumes that followed. It is conceivable that, at a time when female contributors were rare, Lee's new editorial authority simply gave him the opportunity to introduce Elizabeth as a contributor in her own right.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Lee was officially employed on the editorial staff of the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> as summarizer of volumes 31&#150;5 in the <span class="italic">Index and Epitome</span> (1903). Her work is unremarkable, but it is noteworthy that she was given the job&#151;the only female editor among nine men, many of whom had worked on the dictionary's staff in the past and had extensive editorial experience. She also helped to correct the proofs and to compile the index of the 1915 revision of Sidney Lee's <span class="italic">Life of William Shakespeare</span>.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Lee died, unmarried, on 10 July 1920 at home at 25 Holland Street, Kensington, and was cremated at Golders Green. Her death was a &#145;great sorrow&#146; to Sidney Lee  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>); they had worked closely together for thirty years, shared intellectual interests, and were very attached to each other.<br>
