<span class="headword">Biondi, Sir  Giovanni Francesco</span>  (1572&#150;1644), <span class="occ">diplomat and romance writer</span>, was born at Lesina (now Hvar), Croatia. His family, whose surname was Biundovi&#263; until the 1600s, was noble but of modest means. Giovanni took a law degree at Padua and, after a period in Venice, departed for Paris as secretary to the Venetian ambassador, Pietro Piruli. Here (in 1606&#150;8) he adhered to the reformed doctrines and assembled a good number of protestant books, which the Italian historian Paolo Sarpi (with whom Biondi shared significant acquaintances such as Giacomo Castelvetro and Isaac Casaubon) was later to consult. Biondi returned to Venice and got in touch with Sir Henry Wotton, then ambassador to the Republic. Through Wotton, Biondi managed to be invited to England in 1609, where he illustrated to James I his plan &#145;to introduce Religion into Italy&#146; (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1629&#150;31</i>, 347; Benzoni, 22). Biondi was then sent back with money to purchase and spread &#145;heretic&#146; publications. His ties with England, however, were deepening: Biondi corresponded with Robert Cecil, earl of Salisbury (1609&#150;12), and when he was sent by the Venetians on a mission to the Dauphin&eacute; and Provence in 1610 he dispatched relations to England.<br>
<br>Biondi went to Savoy with Wotton in March 1612, but when Prince Henry's death &#145;ended all hope of a Savoyan match&#146; the Dalmatian found himself back in London without a precise occupation  (cf. TNA: PRO, SP 99/10/239). Biondi had been corresponding with Dudley Carleton, ambassador in Venice after Wotton, since September 1611, and in 1613 Carleton convinced Biondi to remain in England. Wotton provided employment, taking Biondi to The Hague in 1614 and later recommending him to Sir Ralph Winwood. Probably through the latter's influence  (cf. <span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1615&#150;17</i>, 380) Biondi was appointed the king's representative at the general Calvinist assembly at Grenoble in 1615, where he worked to secure the Huguenots to the side of the prince of Cond&eacute;. From about this date, Biondi seems to have been a double agent: before leaving London he had shown all &#145;his instructions in the original&#146; to the Venetian ambassador Antonio Foscarini  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1613&#150;15</i>, 542). As late as 1633 he was described by Vincenzo Gussoni, then ambassador of the Republic, as &#145;an individual who continues in the confidential relations at this Court which he has always had with all my predecessors&#146; (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1632&#150;6</i>, 148; also <span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1615&#150;17</i>, 359&#150;60).<br>
<br>Whatever his ties with the Venetians, Biondi (a lifelong member of the Venetian Accademia degli Incogniti) received an English pension of 400 crowns a year from 1615, and was an envoy to northern Italy, where James hoped to create an anti-Spanish league. Being sent again to Piedmont in December 1616, he later became the duke of Savoy's sole agent in England (1617&#150;20). Commenting on his situation, Biondi declared that he was serving &#145;two Masters, against the Gospel's precepts&#146;  (Benzoni, 27), although no particular recognition ever came from Savoy (as none came from Venice). He was, however, knighted by James I in 1622 and made a gentleman of the privy chamber shortly after. About 1622 he married Mary Mayerne, sister of Sir Theodore, the king's physician.<br>
<br>In 1624 Biondi published the first of his baroque novels, <span class="italic">L'Eromena</span>, to be followed by two others, <span class="italic">La Donzella Desterrada</span> (1627; the preface mentions an unsuccessful attempt to translate Sir Philip Sidney's <span class="italic">Arcadia</span>) and <span class="italic">Il Coralbo</span> (1632). These books, which inaugurated a new phase of chivalric romance, were translated into English (1632, 1635, and 1655), French, and German. In 1626 Biondi obtained a lifelong yearly concession of &pound;200 for himself and his wife. In 1628 he was granted exemption from all taxation. His situation in the 1630s, however, does not appear flourishing, his pension not being paid regularly. To Charles I he dedicated his historical compilation on the War of the Roses, <span class="italic">L'istoria delle guerre civili d'Inghilterra</span> (3 vols., 1637&#150;44), which was almost immediately translated into English by Henry Cary, earl of Monmouth (1641&#150;4). In 1640 Biondi left England for Aubonne, near Lausanne, Switzerland, where he died in 1644 and was buried in the local church.<br>
