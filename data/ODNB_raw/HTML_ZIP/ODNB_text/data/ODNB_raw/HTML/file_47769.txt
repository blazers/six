<span class="headword">O'Donoghue,  Daniel</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em> the O'Donoghue of the Glens]</span>  (1833&#150;1889), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the only son of Charles James O'Donoghue (1806&#150;1833) and his wife, Jane Frances O'Connell, who was widowed in the year of her son's birth and subsequently married John McCarthy O'Leary. The O'Donoghues belonged to a congeries of interconnected families of Gaelic lineage (including also O'Connells, McCarthys, and McGillacuddys), who retained possession of lands in co. Kerry and west Cork into the nineteenth century. Daniel's mother was the niece of Daniel O'Connell, the Liberator. The designation of the head of the family by definite article and surname was a translation of Gaelic usage. Young Daniel inherited the title and lands in the first year of his life, and was educated by the Jesuits at Stonyhurst College in Lancashire between 1844 and 1847. On reaching his majority the O'Donoghue (as he was called) was generous, if not downright profligate, in his dealings with tenants and others. On 10 February 1858 he married Marie Sophie (<i>d</i>. 1891), daughter and heir of John Ennis of Ballinahowen Court, co. Westmeath. Six sons were born to them between 1859 and 1875.<br>
<br>The O'Donoghue arrived on the Irish political scene in the mid-1850s as a youthful swashbuckler. He sided with the independent oppositionists such as George Henry Moore MP, against the Catholic-Liberals who followed the policy of co-operation with the whigs. The O'Donoghue was returned as MP for co. Tipperary in March 1857 following an epic by-election contest with a Catholic whig. With Moore out of parliament from 1857, the O'Donoghue's role was enhanced. Over the years that followed he was prominent in almost every public manifestation of popular nationalist sentiment. Behind the scenes he was one of a group of about a dozen notables who from early 1858 discussed among themselves the launching of an organization to renew campaigning for national independence. In December 1860 the O'Donoghue publicly advocated a policy of abstention from Westminster, thus presaging a move to set himself up as leader of a nationalist movement. In May 1861 he travelled to Boulogne to meet John Mitchel and won the latter's endorsement for a programme combining constitutional and non-constitutional campaigns. However, the Fenian leader, James Stephens, would co-operate only on his own terms. From 1861 to 1864 Stephens used his secret organization to obstruct the O'Donoghue's attempts at launching a public movement. The O'Donoghue eventually abandoned his nationalist project in 1865&#150;6, embracing instead the emerging alliance between majority Irish opinion and the Liberals which came to be embodied by Gladstone. In 1865 he transferred to the borough of Tralee&#151;a less expensive constituency than Tipperary&#151;and represented it until its abolition in 1885. Although he described himself in the 1880 election as a home-ruler, he in fact remained aloof from both the Buttite and Parnellite movements. He died on 7 October 1889 at his home, Ballinahowen Court, co. Westmeath, after a brief illness. He was buried in the family vault at Muckross Abbey, Killarney, on 10 October 1889. A grandson, Geoffrey O'Donoghue, was prominent among the members of the Connaught Rangers in the Punjab who mutinied in June 1920 in sympathy with Sinn F&eacute;in.<br>
