<span class="headword">Davy,  Edward</span>  (1806&#150;1885), <span class="occ">chemist and promoter of the telegraph</span>, was born on 16 June 1806 at Ottery St Mary, Devon, the eldest son of Thomas Davy, a surgeon, and his wife, Elizabeth Boutflower. He was educated at the Revd Richard Houlditch's school at Ottery St Mary and at the school of his maternal uncle in Tower Street, London. At the age of sixteen he was articled to Charles Wheeler, a house surgeon at St Bartholomew's Hospital, with whom he lived for three years. In 1825 he won the prize for botany, in 1827 gained his licence from the Society of Apothecaries, and in 1828 secured his membership of the Royal College of Surgeons. In 1830 his father bought him a practice at 390 Strand, London, under the impression that it was a medical practice. It was not, and Davy practised as a dispensing and operative chemist under the name of Davy &amp; Co. His interests lay in the general sciences, particularly chemistry and electricity, and a catalogue of instruments, appended to his <span class="italic">Experimental Guide to Chemistry</span>, published in 1836, includes several devices invented by him in the list of goods and instruments for sale. In 1836 he patented Davy's diamond cement, an adhesive for mending china and glass, from which he gained a small annual income until he sold the rights to the process.<br>
<br>Also in 1836, Davy published <span class="italic">Outline of a New Plan of Telegraphic Communication</span>, and in 1837 he carried out telegraphic experiments in Regent's Park. He laid down a mile of copper wire in the park and developed his &#145;electric renewer&#146; or relay system, which renewed the signal with the aid of a local battery to compensate for attenuation of the original signal. He demonstrated a working model of his telegraph that year and a needle telegraph in the Exeter Hall in central London for several months in 1838. He applied for a patent for his telegraph, which was granted on 4 July 1838 after the solicitor-general asked Michael Faraday's advice as to whether it constituted a different mechanism from that of Cooke and Wheatstone, patented on 12 June 1837. Davy managed to interest two railway companies, the Birmingham Railway and the Southampton Railway, in his telegraph, but left England for Australia before developing a practical system or completing negotiations, which he left in the hands of his father and a friend, Thomas Watson, a London dentist. Eventually his patent was bought by the Electric Telegraph Company in 1847 for &pound;600. Although his telegraph was never developed, Davy was important for popularizing to the general public the concept of telegraphy, and was the first to develop a relay system. Without Davy's demonstrations, public awareness of the telegraph would perhaps have been much slower. Moreover, his correspondence with public figures and engineers, such as I. K. Brunel, did much to hasten the adoption of the telegraph. He also devised a block system for recording train movements between stations by means of an electrically operated dial, which would advance when the train passed a milestone, but he never patented this idea. In 1883 J. J. Fahie, a historian of the telegraph, initiated a campaign to have Davy's contribution recognized, and in November 1884 the Society of Telegraph Engineers and Electricians (later the Institution of Electrical Engineers) made him an honorary member.<br>
<br>While in London, Davy married Mary Minshull; they had one son, George Boutflower Davy, who was born before 1837. By 1838 their marriage had irretrievably broken down, and Mary Davy tried unsuccessfully to divorce her husband. Her extravagance and Davy's lack of business sense led to mounting debts, which he settled with help from his father. To free himself from his wife Davy decided to emigrate. He left his son in the care of his family, and in April 1839 set sail for Australia intending to take up a smallholding. He soon abandoned farming to settle in Adelaide, South Australia, where he engaged in various pursuits. He edited the <span class="italic">Adelaide Examiner</span> from 1843 to 1845, built up a small medical practice, and for a time managed the Yatala copper-smelting works, where he developed a process for copper refining. He patented the process in Australia, and an English patent was granted in 1847 under his brother's name. He also undertook some assay work. In 1852 he was appointed head of the government assay office in Adelaide which he ran very successfully. The following year he was invited to set up the assay office in Melbourne, Victoria, which he also ran very well until a change of government in 1854 led to its abolition. Davy again took up farming near Malmsbury, Victoria, but soon settled in the town itself, where he engaged in local politics, serving for twenty years as a justice of the peace and for three terms as mayor. He developed his medical practice, and acted for twenty years as the first honorary health officer of the borough. When he retired from that position in August 1882, the Malmsbury borough council presented an address of thanks to him at a special evening <i>conversazione</i>. He had become a much loved figure in the Malmsbury area.<br>
<br>Davy married twice while in Australia; it is not clear whether his first marriage had ended (by divorce or his wife's death) or whether these marriages were bigamous. By 1845 he had married Rebecca Soper, with whom he had five sons and two daughters. After her death in 1877 he married Arabella Cecil, the daughter of Stephen Tunbridge Hardinge, postmaster-general of Tasmania. They had four children, two of whom, a son and a daughter, survived him. Davy died on 26 January 1885, at Mollison Street East, Malmsbury, and was buried on 27 January in Malmsbury. Efforts to secure a government pension in Australia and England for his widow were unsuccessful, but the Royal Society of Victoria, which had elected Davy an honorary member in March 1883, raised &pound;150 by a subscription among its members for her and her children.<br>
