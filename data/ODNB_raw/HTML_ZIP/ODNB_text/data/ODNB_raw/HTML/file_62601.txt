<span class="headword">MacEwen <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Radford]</span>,  Ann Maitland</span>  (1918&#150;2008), <span class="occ">architect and town planner</span>, was born on 15 August 1918 at Saxtead, Marshalls Road, Sutton, Surrey, the daughter of Maitland Radford (1884&#150;1944), doctor and medical officer of health for St Pancras, and his wife, Muriel Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lloyd (1889&#150;1983), a doctor working in public health. She was educated at Howell's School, Denbigh, and in 1935 entered the Architectural Association, before graduating in 1940.<br>
<br>Ann Radford was born into a family tradition of socialism. Her grandparents had been members of the Socialist League alongside William Morris, and her parents were committed socialists also. She continued this tradition, and her commitment to left-wing politics coloured the choices she made throughout her career. It was only natural, therefore, that her time at the Architectural Association saw her participation, alongside a group which included Anthony Cox, Richard Llewellyn Davies, Elizabeth Chesterton, and Leo de Syllas, in the student rebellions that sought the modernization of the school's curriculum in order that architects might be better equipped to design for the needs of a modern age. Importantly for her later career, she gained an early introduction to town planning through her assistance on a collaborative project, known as Tomorrow Town, which the students who formed Unit 15 submitted as their thesis project in 1938. Based on extensive research, and designed by group work, the scheme presaged the sort of techniques which she would practise in her post-war work for the London county council (LCC).<br>
<br>Ann Radford married one of the Tomorrow Town team, John Wheeler (1916&#150;1945), son of Walter James Wheeler, bank manager, on 21 December 1940 and, like him, became a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). As she wrote later,<blockquote>one reason for joining the party was &hellip; the conviction that without radical changes in society the skills of the architect could not be used to benefit ordinary people &hellip;; one had to work politically as well as professionally and for some of us Marxism and the Communist Party seemed to offer the way forward. (letter to Anthony Cox, December 1989, Cox papers)</blockquote>The Wheelers' two daughters were born in 1941 and 1943. John Wheeler, who, despite the CPGB's official neutrality between 1939 and 1941, had joined the RAF shortly before their marriage, was killed in a plane crash in September 1945 while out testing a new plane at high altitude. By this date the family had been living in a communal household at 6 Keats Grove, Hampstead, with Ann's brother and sister-in-law, and she had begun work for the architect&#150;planner Judith Ledeboer, assisting her work on neighbourhood planning. Between 1946 and 1947 she then took on a similar role with Geoffrey Jellicoe, assisting on the master plan for the new town at Hemel Hempstead. She married for a second time, on 22 May 1947, the journalist <a href="#cosubject_62601">Malcolm MacEwen [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>After her marriage Ann MacEwen decided to focus her career on town planning and, following discussions with Jacqueline Tyrrwhit, head of the School of Planning and Regional Reconstruction in Gordon Square, London, it was agreed that she could take its planning diploma in two terms, while pregnant with her third child (a daughter), who was born in September 1948, two months after she completed the course. This allowed her to qualify for work at the LCC and she joined Percy Johnson Marshall's team in 1949, working for the head of planning, Arthur Ling, on the reconstruction of Stepney and Poplar. Despite the progressive politics of many of her colleagues who, like her, were CPGB members, her refusal to work on Saturdays in order to be with her family initially caused her to be denied pension rights and promotion. The repeal of this mode of institutional sexism allowed her to win establishment and promotion, which culminated in her taking on responsibility for the detailed planning of the reconstruction of north-east London. At the LCC she, and her co-workers, reflecting the influence of the pre-war thesis projects of the Architectural Association, brought to their planning schemes a desire to address both the physical and social needs of the rehoused, but budget cuts thwarted their visions for social and health centres, nursery schools, parks, and recreation grounds alongside the new housing estates.<br>
<br>From the LCC Ann MacEwen (who had left the CPGB in 1956, in protest at its response to the Hungarian uprising of that year) went to the Ministry of Transport in 1961, to form part of the team working under Colin Buchanan on what became the <span class="italic">Traffic in Towns</span> report (1963). The report was significant for forming part of a nascent movement against the unquestioned dominance of the motor car and the power of the traffic engineer in post-war planning. The team sought to balance the demands of traffic and commerce with existing historic urban infrastructure and while it retained a fondness for comprehensive redevelopment, its stress on managing the impact of the car, the maintenance of environmental standards, the safety and well-being of pedestrians, and the need for good public transport, represented an important challenge to the contemporary orthodoxy. MacEwen became a partner in Colin Buchanan and Partners from 1964 to 1973, where she produced planning and transport studies of Bath, Edinburgh, and Canterbury, as well as Bergamo, Italy. She succeeded in Edinburgh in getting plans to build a motorway-scale bridge between the Old and New towns abandoned. She also pursued an academic career as a researcher in the transport section of the department of civil engineering at Imperial College, London (1963&#150;4), and later as senior lecturer at the school of advanced studies at Bristol University (1974&#150;7).<br>
<br>In the late 1970s the focus of MacEwen's attention turned to national parks, then under threat of redevelopment, working in close collaboration with her husband. Based at University College, London, where they were both honorary research fellows from 1977, and funded by the Nuffield Foundation, they were early pioneers of sustainable planning. In particular they advocated the continued validity of national parks, not as nostalgic acts of preservation, but as what they called &#145;greenprints&#146; for the future. Their two books, <span class="italic">National Parks: Conservation or Cosmetics?</span> (1982) and <span class="italic">Greenprints for the Countryside? the Story of Britain's National Parks</span> (1987), provided the intellectual rationale for the campaign. The MacEwens had moved to the Manor House, Wootton Courtenay, Somerset, in 1968, the shift from Hampstead to the west country being a key factor in their interest in environmental politics. In retirement Ann MacEwen learned to weave silk and also set up a local branch of the University of the Third Age. She spent much of the 1990s caring for her husband, who had suffered a series of strokes before his death in 1996.<br>
<br>Ann MacEwen's significance lay not just in her status as the pre-eminent woman town planner of her generation and her ongoing attempts to strike a balance between heritage and modernity in the age of the car. It may also be attributed to her presence among that generation of architect&#150;planners who sought to develop a people-centred mode of planning, however thwarted their intentions may ultimately have been. In 2004 she moved into sheltered accommodation and died at Springdene Nursing Home, 55 Oakleigh Park North, Whetstone, Barnet, of bronchopneumonia on 20 August 2008.<br>
<br>Her second husband, <a name="cosubject_62601"></a><span class="headword">Malcolm MacEwen</span>  (1911&#150;1996), <span class="occ">journalist and environmentalist</span>, was born on 24 December 1911 at Brangan, Lower Drummond, Inverness, the son of Sir Alexander Malcolm MacEwen (1875&#150;1941), lawyer and Scottish nationalist, and his wife, Mary Beatrice, daughter of Surgeon-Major George Henderson of the Indian Medical Service. Educated at St Salvator's preparatory school, Inverness, Inverness Academy, and Rossall School, Lancashire, he initially embarked on a degree in forestry at Aberdeen University in 1929, abandoning this after two years for the study of law at Edinburgh University. There he met his first wife, Barbara Mary Stebbing (1910&#150;1944), a geology student, and daughter of George Stebbing, stockbroker. They married on 2 April 1937 and had one daughter. His political engagement began as a young man. Following an initial flirtation with the Scottish nationalism of his father, he turned next to the Labour Party, a conversion he attributed to the loss of his leg in a motorcycle accident in 1933, when the costs of his care convinced him of the need for a free public health service. Between 1938 and 1940 he served as Labour councillor in Ross and Cromarty but his instincts were towards communism and he joined the party in 1939. In 1940 he joined the staff of the <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span>, becoming its parliamentary correspondent in 1943. He left the post, and the party, in 1956, for the same reasons as his second wife. In this period he was involved in the establishment of the <span class="italic">New Reasoner</span> and the <span class="italic">New Left Review</span>.<br>
<br>In 1956 MacEwen entered a second phase of his career, as an architectural journalist and administrator. On the recommendation of Leo de Syllas, he joined the staff of the <span class="italic">Architects' Journal</span>. In 1960 he moved to the Royal Institute of British Architects as head of its information services (1960&#150;66), later taking the role of editor of its <span class="italic">Journal</span> (1964&#150;71), head of its publishing services (1966&#150;70), and director of public affairs (1971&#150;2). This period saw him become heavily involved in critiques of contemporary urban and transport planning resulting, first in &#145;Motropolis&#146;, a special issue of the <span class="italic">Architects' Journal</span> in October 1959, analysing the social and economic disadvantages of the car. This early sign of a concern for the compromising of the promise of post-war reconstruction culminated in his book, <span class="italic">Crisis in Architecture</span> (1974), a critique of the RIBA. The move to Exmoor in 1968 inaugurated the final phase of his career and what he called (in the title of his autobiography) &#145;the greening of a red&#146;. As a nominee of the Ramblers' Association, he became a member of the Exmoor National Park committee and fought from within its support of the ploughing up of moorland. A long and bitter campaign finally succeeded, in 1977, in saving the land. In his later years he worked closely with his wife to advocate sustainable conservation. He died on 11 May 1996 at the Winsor Nursing Home, The Avenue, Minehead, following a series of strokes. His first daughter had predeceased him; he and Ann were survived by their daughter, and by her two daughters with John Wheeler.<br>
