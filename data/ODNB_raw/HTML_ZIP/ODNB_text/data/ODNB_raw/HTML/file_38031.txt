<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sugden,  Samuel</span>  (1892&#150;1950), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 21 February 1892 at 2 Arthington View, Hunslet, Leeds, the eldest son of Samuel Sugden, a master draper of Leeds who was connected with wool-trade journals, and his wife, Eliza Jane Broadbent. He was educated at Batley grammar school from where he went to the Royal College of Science in London in 1912. In 1914 he graduated with first-class honours as an associate.<br>
<br>Because of the outbreak of war Sugden abandoned plans to do research and took an industrial job, but in September 1915 he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps as a private soldier and served with the British expeditionary force. In June 1916 he was released to join the research department at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, working under Robert Robertson. He prospered there, but in April 1919 resigned to become a lecturer at Birkbeck College, London.<br>
<br>In 1924 Sugden published work on the &#145;parachor&#146;, a function of surface tension which could give information about the structure of molecules. This attracted much attention and thereafter his advancement was rapid: in 1928 he was appointed reader and in 1932 professor of physical chemistry at Birkbeck. He was elected FRS in 1934 and in 1937 he was appointed professor of chemistry at University College, London.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the Second World War, Sugden immediately joined the Ministry of Supply and went to the chemical defence experimental station in Porton, near Salisbury. He became impatient with the pace of work there, and felt that gas warfare was unlikely to be used, and so he obtained a post as a superintendent of explosives research at the armament research department in 1942. But here, too, there were soon difficulties and in 1943 he resigned to become scientific adviser to the United States 8th army air force in Great Britain. Later that year he suffered a breakdown of health following a severe attack of influenza. In September 1944 he was able to return to his academic duties, but soon after the war ended he was stricken by chronic illness and did relatively little research thereafter.<br>
<br>Though Sugden did very useful work on molecular structure by other means, his main contributions came through his parachor. This proved to be an additive function of atomic constants with structural constants in addition. Unfortunately these constants could not be determined theoretically but only empirically, and eventually this proved to be an unsound basis. Nevertheless, because it came when the instrumental techniques of structural determination were in a rudimentary state or were non-existent, Sugden's work was very stimulating and may have helped encourage the search for better methods. He published his major book, <span class="italic">The Parachor and Valency</span>, in 1930.<br>
<br>In 1926 Sugden married Eleanor, daughter of Thomas Dunlop of Glasgow. They had no children. Sugden died on 20 October 1950 at the Epsom and Ewell Cottage Hospital near his home in West Hill Avenue, Epsom, Surrey; his wife survived him.<br>
