<span class="headword">Weemes <span class="st"> [Wemyss]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1579&#150;1636), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and exegetist</span>, was the only son of John Weemes of Lathockar, in Fife. He was educated at the University of St Andrews, graduating MA in 1600, and&#151;probably soon afterward&#151;married Margaret Cockburn. The couple had a son, David. Weemes was appointed minister of Hutton, Berwickshire, in 1608. In the same year he was one of several commissioners appointed by the general assembly to consult &#145;upon all maters standing presentlie in controversie &hellip; anent [the] discipline of the kirk&#146;  (Calderwood, 7.27&#150;8), and took the side of those who opposed the imposition of episcopacy. Subsequently his proposed transfer to a vacant charge at Edinburgh was refused and he was admitted to the parish of Duns, Berwickshire, in 1613. At an unknown date Weemes lost both his wife and son. He married Janet Murray, and they had a son, John, and a daughter.<br>
<br>Weemes remained steadfast in his opposition to royal policy. In 1617 he signed a petition condemning the king's attempts to curtail the &#145;power of &hellip; Generall Assemblies&#146;, and he was one of the &#145;cheefe reasoners&#146; against the five articles&#151;both &#145;in conference&#146;, and in &#145;open assemblie&#146;&#151;during the following year  (Calderwood, 7.253, 332). In March 1620 Weemes appeared before the court of high commission for &#145;not ministering the Communion according to the order prescrived at Perth&#146;. In answer to the charge he claimed that &#145;all the brethrein of the shire where he was minister agried with [his] judgement&#146;, that to administer the sacrament to kneeling communicants was &#145;evill &hellip; [and] directlie against the institution&#146;. &#145;Therfor&#146;, he concluded, &#145;we will never doe it&#146;. He was dismissed on his assurance that he would return to his parish, &#145;be quyet, and not hinder others&#146;  (ibid., 412&#150;13, 425&#150;6).<br>
<br>True to his word Weemes retired from active opposition. He was considered &#145;one of the best learned&#146; of ministers  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), and devoted the remaining years of his life to a study of the scriptures. His most famous work, <span class="italic">The Christian Synagogue, Wherein is Contayned the Diverse Reading, Poynting, Translation, and Collation of Scripture with Scripture</span> (1623), was reprinted on five occasions during his lifetime. He wrote several other highly regarded books, including <span class="italic">The Pourtraiture of the Image of God in Man</span> (1626), <span class="italic">The Right Understanding of the Scriptures</span> (1632), <span class="italic">The Right Understanding of the First Table of the Morall Law</span> (1632), <span class="italic">An Explanation of the Ceremoniall Laws of Moses</span> [1632], <span class="italic">An Explication of the Judiciall Lawes of Moses</span> [1632], and <span class="italic">Observations, Naturall and Morall</span> (1633). At the latter date a three-volume set of the <span class="italic">Workes of Mr John Weemse</span> was published at London. In 1634 his contribution to theological debate was recognized by no less an authority than Charles I, who recommended the minister to the second prebend of Durham Cathedral. Weemes accepted, and was installed honorary canon in the same year. His final work, <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Foure Degenerate Sonnes, viz. the Atheist, the Magician, the Idolater, and the Jew</span>, was published as &#145;the fourth volume of the Workes&#146; in 1636. Weemes died, aged about fifty-seven, in November of that year; his wife apparently survived him.<br>
