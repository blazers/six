<span class="headword">Singer,  Simeon</span>  (1848&#150;1906), <span class="occ">rabbi</span>, was born in London on 5 November 1848, the youngest son of Julius Singer, a clothier from Raab in Hungary, and his wife, Frederica Wolff of Hamburg. Singer went to the Jews' College School, London, where he subsequently became a teacher. In 1867 he became minister to the Borough New Synagogue, south London, a post which he combined with a variety of Jewish and non-Jewish charitable and philanthropic endeavours, while busying himself also as a prison visitor. On 21 April 1868 he married Charlotte, the youngest daughter of Samuel Pyke; they had five sons, including the medical historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36110/', "Charles Joseph Singer")</script>, and one daughter, Frederica 
    (Freda; 1869&#150;1959)
  , who married the scholar and historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51111/', "Israel Abrahams")</script>, who later edited his father-in-law's <span class="italic">Literary Remains</span>. In 1878 Singer was appointed minister of the New West End Synagogue, then in the course of erection in St Petersburgh Place, west London; he served as its minister for the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>Singer thus moved from one of the poorest to one of the wealthiest of the Jewish congregations in London; the transition coincided with a turning point in the development of the Anglo-Jewish ministry. In 1870 the lay leaders of the Ashkenazi congregations in London had established the United Synagogue, over which &#145;the cousinhood&#146;&#151;and pre-eminently the Rothschilds&#151;presided. Nathan Marcus Adler, the chief rabbi, became the supreme ecclesiastical authority of this body; ministers of its constituent synagogues were not intended to be rabbinical authorities, but merely preachers and pastors. Singer was an enthusiastic supporter of the concept of the United Synagogue; he moved easily within the world of wealth with which the New West End was associated, enjoyed the friendship of the Rothschild family, and acquired an unrivalled reputation as a preacher of great power and eloquence. At the same time he immersed himself in public service beyond as well as within the Jewish and Anglo-Jewish worlds.<br>
<br>Singer edited, in conjunction with Solomon Schechter, <span class="italic">Talmudical Fragments in the Bodleian Library</span> (1896). In 1890 he had published, with Nathan Adler's authority, the <span class="italic">Authorised Daily Prayer Book</span>, which combined accuracy of Hebrew with a vibrant and intelligible English translation. That same year the rabbinical diploma was conferred on him by Rabbi Weiss, lector in Vienna. Singer undertook this study partly as a protest against the lowly status of the Anglo-Jewish preacher, and partly to demonstrate that Anglo-Jewish scholars were capable of securing the rabbinical qualification.<br>
<br>As a Jewish theologian, however, Singer stamped himself as a radical and, in some respects, as a rebel. Though a supporter of Jewish settlement in Palestine, and one of Theodor Herzl's earliest Anglo-Jewish patrons, he opposed Herzl's scheme for a Jewish state as impractical, contrary to the divine will, and subversive of the attachment of the Jew to the state of which he was a citizen. Though Orthodox in his religious beliefs, Singer deplored the division between the Orthodox and Reform camps, preached in the Reform synagogue in Manchester, and was a supporter of the Jewish Religious Union, forerunner of the Union of Liberal and Progressive Synagogues; it was only under intense pressure from within the United Synagogue that he broke off this association.<br>
<br>Singer died at his London residence, 52 Leinster Square, on 20 August 1906, and was buried in the United Synagogue cemetery, Willesden. He was survived by his wife.<br>
