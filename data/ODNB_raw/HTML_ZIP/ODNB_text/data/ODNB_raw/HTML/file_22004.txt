</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pery,  Edmond Sexton</span>, Viscount Pery  (1719&#150;1806), <span class="occ">speaker of the Irish House of Commons</span>, eldest son of Stackpole Pery (<i>c</i>.1688&#150;1739), Church of Ireland clergyman, of Stackpole Court, co. Clare, and his wife, Jane Twigg, daughter of William Twigg, archdeacon of Limerick, was born in Limerick on 9 April 1719. The family originally came from Brittany and rose to prominence during the reign of Henry VIII. Edmond was educated at Trinity College, Dublin (1736&#150;9), and was admitted as a student of the Middle Temple on 30 June 1739. He was called to the Irish bar in Hilary term 1745 and quickly achieved distinction within the profession. In 1751 he was elected MP for the borough of Wicklow. Initially he acted with the government, aligning himself with the administration of the duke of Dorset, and followed the party line by voting for the altered money bill on 17 December 1753.<br>
<br>The journals of the Irish House of Commons reveal Pery's activity in promoting the interests of Ireland, in particular the city of Dublin, of which he was a common councillor. On 7 January 1756 he presented heads of a bill for the encouragement of tillage; on 28 February heads of a bill for the improved supply of corn and flour to the city of Dublin; and on 2 March heads of a bill to prevent unlawful combination to raise the price of coals in the city of Dublin. Most of his measures gradually found their way into the statute book, but at the time he experienced considerable opposition from government, and at the close of the session of 1756 he thought himself justified in opposing the usual vote of thanks to the lord lieutenant, the duke of Devonshire. On 11 June 1756 Pery married Patty (<i>d</i>. 1757), youngest daughter of John Martin of Dublin. They had no children during their brief marriage.<br>
<br>In the 1756/7 parliamentary session Pery took part in the attack on the pension list, and, in order to secure proper parliamentary control of the revenue of the country, he supported a proposal to limit supply to one year, with the object of insuring the annual meeting of parliament. During the mid-1750s Pery virtually single-handedly agitated the issues that were to become central to patriot concerns during the late eighteenth century. As a result he was regarded in some quarters as the embodiment of the &#145;new&#146; patriot opposition. The fact that he declined the prime serjeantcy, the third law office of the crown, enhanced his credibility and popularity. However, he declined it not because of patriotic interest but from an &#145;undeserved friendship&#146; with the first earl of Belvedere, who was in a sulk with Dublin Castle  (Emly (Pery) MS T/3087/16). In 1757 he published anonymously his <span class="italic">Letters from an Armenian in Ireland</span>, which contains some interesting and valuable reflections on the political situation.<br>
<br>Pery displayed great interest in the prosperity of his native city, and secured a grant of &pound;27,000 from the government between 1755 and 1761 for construction in Limerick. In 1760, when Limerick was declared to be no longer a fortress, he was instrumental in causing the walls to be levelled, new roads to be made, and a new bridge and spacious quays to be built. At the general election of 1761 he was returned unopposed for the city of Limerick, which he continued to represent in successive parliaments until his retirement in 1785. On 27 October 1762 he married his second wife, Elizabeth Handcock (1732/3&#150;1821), widow of Robert Handcock of Waterstown, co. Westmeath, and eldest daughter of John Denny Vesey, first Baron Knapton, and Elizabeth Brownlow. They had two daughters: Diana Jane, who married Thomas Knox, and Frances, who married Nicholas Calvert of Hunsdon, Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>In 1761 Pery had had a serious illness, but on his return to parliament he resumed his place as the dominant opposition figure. He was the <i>de facto</i> leading spokesman of the &#145;flying squadron&#146;&#151;a group of patriot and independent-minded MPs who voted according to issues and were not averse to supporting measures sponsored by the administration if they perceived them to have some merit. During the parliamentary session Pery recommenced his onslaught on the pension list. An amendment to the address, moved by him at the opening of the session in October 1763, opposing the view that the &#145;ordinary establishment&#146; included pensions, was adopted by the house, and was the means of wresting a promise from the government that no new pension should be granted on the civil list &#145;except upon very extraordinary occasions&#146;. During November 1763 when debate commenced in the committee of supply Pery took the lead in challenging the administration's economic policies and sustained a critique of the national debt. He graphically highlighted the deterioration in the kingdom's finances by comparing the current national debt of &pound;520,000 with the situation in the late 1740s, when the Treasury ran a surplus. But all the efforts to obtain an unqualified condemnation of the system ended in failure.<br>
<br>In the early winter of 1769 Pery was prominent in successfully opposing the main money bill on the grounds that it had originated not with the Irish House of Commons but with the British privy council. When the House of Commons adopted the usual face-saving formula of reintroducing the same money bill as a measure of its own, he proposed or was associated with successful amendments. In 1770 efforts were made by Pery and other patriots concerning the need to unite all the opponents of the administration to act as &#145;an Association&#146;. However, these came to nothing. Then, when parliament reassembled after its long prorogation in February 1771, Pery carried an amendment to the address to the king which Lord Townshend described, in an official dispatch, as &#145;an artful justification of what the House voted last session, and a fresh, though indirect, assertion of their [sole] right to originate Money Bills&#146;  (R. A. Roberts, ed., <span class="italic">Calendar of Home Office Papers of the Reign of George III</span>, 1770&#150;72, 216&#150;22).<br>
<br>On the resignation of John Ponsonby, Pery was elected speaker of the Irish House of Commons on 7 March 1771. He had not been the choice of most patriots: Henry Flood and other independents lobbied on behalf of another candidate. However, it had been an avowed ambition of Pery since at least 1767. He did not, as was usual, affect to decline the honour conferred upon him, but on being presented for the approbation of the crown he admitted that it was the highest point of his ambition, and that he had not been more solicitous to obtain it than he would be to discharge the duties of the post. On 1 May he was sworn a member of the privy council.<br>
<br>It is unclear to what extent Pery's election as speaker changed his political course. From 1771 until his retirement from the house, he was speaker and as such had only limited opportunities for public pronouncements on political subjects. However, during the next session, on 19 February 1772, the house was equally divided on a motion censuring an increase in the number of commissioners of the revenue, a measure which was vital to Townshend's policy. Pery gave his casting vote in favour of the motion. &#145;This&#146;, said he:<blockquote>is a question which involves the privileges of the commons of Ireland. The noes have opposed the privilege: the noes have been wrong; let the privileges of the commons of Ireland stand unimpeached, therefore I say the ayes have it. (Grattan, 1.109)</blockquote>Again, he was a source of great embarrassment to the succeeding administration, in the course of which he delivered in December 1773 his most outspoken presenting speech of all, in which he expressed the hope &#145;that the restrictions, which narrow and short-sighted policy of former times, equally injurious to Great Britain and to us, imposed upon the manufactures and commerce of this kingdom, will be remitted&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journals of the Irish House of Commons</span>, 9, 1773&#150;8, 74). In March 1774 he made a further, unscheduled speech in the house that was designed to widen the definition of what was a money bill, and so extend the authority of the House of Commons at the expense, almost certainly, of the British privy council. The bill which he endeavoured to define as a money bill was a bill amending the <span class="roman">Tontine Act</span> passed earlier in the same session, the amendment being designed to make it easier for English capital to participate in the Irish tontine. It is clear that Pery warmly espoused the House of Commons view that the British privy council had no power to amend money bills, even when its amendments did not alter the level of tax.<br>
<br>After the general election of 1776 the administration exerted itself to get Pery re-elected speaker, holding a two-day session of parliament purely for that purpose and returning to it three people who sat for those two days only and were raised to the peerage as soon as their votes for Pery were cast. However, there is no suggestion that any pledge of good behaviour had been forthcoming from Pery. Indeed, his conduct as speaker of the 1776 parliament was very far from that of a ministerial hireling, particularly over free trade in 1779, and the constitution of 1782 which resulted in Ireland's legislative independence. In 1778 he travelled to England to press for concessions over free trade and had some success in clarifying the issue for doubting and suspicious ministers.<br>
<br>Pery was re-elected to the speakership in 1783 and played an active part in opposing Pitt's commercial propositions of 1785. These were an attempt to rationalize the laws governing trade between Great Britain and Ireland by reducing or eliminating tariffs. His original enthusiasm for the commercial arrangements waned visibly as it emerged that the resolutions were seen to threaten the legislative autonomy of the Irish parliament. Pitt's resolutions were simply unacceptable and opposition MPs began to bond together in what Thomas Orde (Irish chief secretary) termed &#145;murmurs and cabals&#146; led by Pery, who &#145;with more warmth than usual declaimed against your propositions as unions to Ireland and intended to force this country into a rejection of them&#146;  (Kelly, <span class="italic">Prelude</span>, 145). Pery's discontent derived from his conviction that the changes Pitt had introduced represented &#145;a departure from the system of reciprocity which is the professed principle of the intended settlement&#146;  (NL Ire., Bolton MS 16351, fol. 23). The actions of Pery, who, Orde claimed, furnished Grattan &#145;privately with materials for discontent and remonstrance&#146; and &#145;make[s] up perpetual doses of poison and puts some of it into almost every man's mess&#146;, combined with rumours of the unhappiness of other MPs with the terms of the arrangement, underlined the importance of the administration's search for concessions to appease the growing opposition  (NL Ire., Bolton MS 16358, fols. 106&#150;8, 223&#150;8). Pitt worked on a compromise, and although Pery gave no firm indication that he supported the arrangement he did keep in close contact with the government and regularly suggested amendments. Pery's absence during the debate of the <span class="roman">Commercial Bill</span> in the Irish House of Commons during August 1785 has to be taken as an indication of his disapproval.<br>
<br>Pery's retirement followed closely on the abandonment of Pitt's commercial propositions after their near defeat in the Irish House of Commons. For some time prior to this, Pery, who was now sixty-six, had been negotiating with the government over the terms of his retirement from the speakership. However, his decision to resign the chair on 4 September 1785 in the immediate aftermath of the rejection of the <span class="roman">Commercial Bill</span> shocked Dublin Castle. In recognition of his service he was granted a pension of &pound;3000 p.a. and raised to the peerage by the title of Viscount Pery of Newtown-Pery in the county of Limerick.<br>
<br>Predictably, Pery was strongly opposed to the union. The impression that Pery's opposition was not uncompromising, as quoted in Lecky's <span class="italic">History of England</span> (8.295), was a probably somewhat optimistic interpretation of his sentiments by Dublin Castle. Before the start of the 1799 session of parliament, when the union was first introduced, it was at Pery's Dublin house that the anti-unionists met to discuss tactics. He ultimately voted against the act.<br>
<br>Pery died at his house in Park Street, London, on 24 February 1806 and was buried in the Calvert family vault at Furneaux Pelham, Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, on 4 March. He was survived by his widow, who died on 4 April 1821, and by his daughters, who inherited his personal property; the family estate, worth &pound;8000 p.a., descended to his nephew, Edmond Henry Pery, earl of Limerick. His papers were later catalogued and published by the Historical Manuscripts Commission.<br>
<br>Pery's contemporaries' reactions concerning him ranged from veneration to contempt. In particular, his critics disputed his superiority over the attractions of patronage and power. However, his surviving correspondence establishes his reputation as a statesman and as a great Irishman. He was unquestionably one of the most influential members of parliament from 1751 to 1785. During the twenty years prior to his election to the speakership he had generally followed an individualistic course, judging questions on their merits and glorying in the fact that he was not a party man. He was of course looked to for leadership but this was largely a matter of spontaneous deference to his ability. He always worked to diminish what was bad in legislation and increase what was good. He was the only Irish politician of the second half of the eighteenth century who continued to strike a balance between government and opposition, and he was in effect a &#145;patriot&#146; in power. Yet it must be recognized that Pery crucially entered the Irish House of Commons at just the right time. Nearly all the causes which he espoused&#151;an Irish <span class="roman">Habeas Corpus Act</span>, a limitation in the duration of parliaments, annual parliamentary sessions, a change in the tenure of judges, the modification of Poynings' law&#151;came to fruition during his time as an MP. Nevertheless, Pery was undoubtedly one of the leading political figures of eighteenth-century Ireland.<br>
