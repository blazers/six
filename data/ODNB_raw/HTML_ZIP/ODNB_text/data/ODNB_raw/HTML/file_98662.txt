<span class="headword">King,  Alexander <span class="st"> [Alex]</span></span>  (1909&#150;2007), <span class="occ">chemist, international civil servant, and environmentalist</span>, was born on 26 January 1909 at 5 Battlefield Avenue, Langside, Glasgow, the eldest child of James Mitchell King, a cashier in the Nobel Explosives Company, later a director of ICI, and his wife, Janet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dale. He was educated at Albert Road Academy, Pollokshields, and then, after the family had moved to London, at Highgate School and the Royal College of Science (part of Imperial College), London, graduating in chemistry. While an undergraduate he edited the college's literary magazine, <span class="italic">The Phoenix</span>, and was president of the literary and debating society. He also attended Edith Sitwell's Saturday afternoon salons in Bloomsbury. After graduate research at the University of Munich, in 1932 he was appointed a demonstrator in physical chemistry at Imperial College, where he also pursued research on surface chemistry and emulsification, and wrote three chemistry textbooks. On 27 March 1933 he married, at the Presbyterian church in Falstone, Northumberland, Sarah Maskell Thompson (1909&#150;1999), a talented pianist whom he had met in Munich, daughter of John Charles Read Thompson, solicitor, and niece of the Liberal politician Walter Runciman. They had three daughters. In 1938 King led the Imperial College expedition to Jan Mayen; he received the Gill memorial prize of the Royal Geographical Society in 1938, and served on the society's council from 1939 to 1940.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the Second World War King was a senior lecturer in physical chemistry at Imperial College. After a short period investigating sabotage techniques, in 1940 he was recruited as assistant director of scientific research at the Ministry of Supply. One of his tasks was to examine intercepted communications containing scientific information that might be of use to the war effort. One such communication, from the Geigy company in Switzerland to its Manchester subsidiary, contained details of an organochlorine, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), that one of Geigy's chemists, Paul M&uuml;ller, had identified as an effective moth-balling agent, harmless (as he thought) to humans. King recognized the chemical's potential as an insecticide, particularly against lice and mosquitoes, and its usefulness in limiting the spread of typhus and malaria. Within months he had arranged for the mass production of the chemical, which was later credited with saving thousands of servicemen's lives, particularly in the Far East. (He later expressed regret at the indiscriminate use of DDT as an agricultural pesticide in the post-war period.) In 1942 he was transferred to the Ministry of Production on its formation, as deputy scientific adviser, and then in 1943 was sent to Washington to share knowledge of DDT's properties with the Americans. In Washington he was made head of the British scientific mission, and scientific attach&eacute; at the British embassy; he was awarded the American medal of freedom in 1946.<br>
<br>King returned to the UK in 1947 to become secretary of the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy and scientific adviser to the lord president of the council, Herbert Morrison, who was charged with the co-ordination of economic planning. He was appointed CBE in 1948. In 1950 he moved to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research as chief scientific officer, in which post he played an important role in deciding which research programmes would be funded by the government. He also served as chairman of the productivity and industrial research committee of the Organization for European Economic Co-operation.<br>
<br>In 1956 King became an international civil servant, as deputy director of the European Productivity Agency, a semi-autonomous agency within the framework of the OEEC, which aimed to increase industrial and agricultural productivity in western Europe by encouraging the adoption of American technological and managerial techniques. When the OEEC was transformed into the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development in 1961 King became its director (from 1968 director-general) for scientific affairs, again concerned with promoting technological and scientific innovation in order to underpin and sustain economic growth.<br>
<br>While working at the OECD, which he later described as the &#145;high tabernacle of economic growth&#146;  (King, 293), King became concerned about the long-term social and environmental consequences of the untrammelled pursuit of industrialization. In 1966 he came across the transcript of a speech given in Argentina by the president of Olivetti, Aurelio Peccei, in which Peccei voiced his concerns about population growth, environmental degradation, and the misuse of technology, and predicted (if humanity failed to change its ways) a future of environmental crisis, food shortages, conflicts over energy and other resources, and a catastrophic decline in standards of living. King wrote to Peccei, the two met to discuss their concerns, and in April 1968 they organized a two-day meeting at the Accademia dei Lincei in Rome, bringing together some forty high-ranking scientists, industrialists, politicians, civil servants, and others, to explore future scenarios. The participants agreed to continue to meet regularly, choosing to name their organization the Club of Rome, under which name it was incorporated as a non-profit organization, with permanent headquarters in Switzerland. The club achieved a spectacular success with the publication of <span class="italic">The Limits to Growth</span> in 1972, based on research the club had commissioned from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, modelling the impact of future population growth and economic activity on the environment, and making clear the need for a more sustainable approach. Published just before the oil crisis ushered in a period of acute economic turbulence across the developed world, the book sold some twelve million copies in the first few years, and was translated into thirty-seven languages. King developed many of the concerns raised by the Club of Rome in his own writings, which included <span class="italic">The International Stimulus</span> (1974), <span class="italic">The State of the Planet</span> (1980), and, with Bertrand Schneider, <span class="italic">The First Global Revolution</span> (1991). He also travelled indefatigably on behalf of the club, which he served as its second president from 1984 to 1991, following the death of Peccei.<br>
<br>King retired from the OECD at the age of sixty-five, in 1974. For the next ten years he served as chairman of the International Federation of Institutes of Advanced Study. He was a visiting professor at Brandeis and Montreal universities, an associate fellow of the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and an adviser to the government of Ontario. He was awarded honorary doctorates by the National University of Ireland, the Open University, and Strathclyde, Guelph, and Bucharest universities, the Erasmus prize in 1987, and the great medal of Paris in 1998. He was appointed CMG in 1975.<br>
<br>Both physically and mentally agile, King (known to friends and colleagues as Alex) was described by one obituarist as &#145;a man of engaging impatience&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 26 March 2007). Ricardo D&iacute;ez-Hochleitner, his successor as president of the Club of Rome, described him as &#145;a peace-searching, wise world citizen&#146;, and &#145;a real humanist because a solid scientist&#146;  (King, v). He published an engaging autobiography, <span class="italic">Let the Cat Turn Round: One Man's Traverse of the Twentieth Century</span>, in 2006. He enjoyed literature and music, but above all liked to keep in touch with global affairs. He kept a flat in London (in Chartwell House, Ladbroke Terrace, Hammersmith) and also a house in Callian, Fayence, Provence. He died at Hammersmith Hospital on 28 February 2007, of sepsis following a urinary tract infection, and was survived by two of his daughters (one having died in a climbing accident in the Swiss Alps).<br>
