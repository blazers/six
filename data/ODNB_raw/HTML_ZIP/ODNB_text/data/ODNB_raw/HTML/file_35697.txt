<span class="headword">Read, Sir  Herbert James</span>  (1863&#150;1949), <span class="occ">civil servant and colonial governor</span>, was born at Honiton, Devon, on 17 March 1863, the second son of Charles Read, proprietor of a drapery store, and his wife, Mary Ann Avery. Read was educated at Allhallows School, Honiton, and at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he was an exhibitioner and gained a first in mathematics in 1884. He was also a good classical scholar, and his knowledge of the history of London in recent times was encyclopaedic.<br>
<br>Read entered the civil service as a higher division clerk at the War Office in 1887. In 1889 he was transferred to the Colonial Office where he remained until retirement. As a civil servant Read linked the Colonial Office to the world of science, championing&#151;from within Whitehall&#151;the practical application of scientific innovation for the benefit of those living and working in the empire, a generation before &#145;development and welfare&#146; became serious official concerns. Throughout his career his work was mainly concerned with Britain's tropical African empire. In the colonial secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, who selected him as his assistant private secretary in 1896&#150;8, Read found an appreciative and congenial chief. In turn, Read &#145;stimulated his chief's interest in tropical medicine&#146;, ensuring Chamberlain's &#145;desire to innovate was well fed, and that Colonial Office inertia was circumvented&#146;  (Kubicek, <span class="italic">Administration of Imperialism</span>, 20, 142). He played a vital role in the early twentieth-century drive against tropical diseases, and matched scientific and technical advances with official support for their application throughout the empire.<br>
<br>Read was exceptional among his official colleagues, most of whom were graduates in the arts, in his quick recognition of the importance of scientific research in the future administration and development of tropical dependencies. He was largely instrumental in stimulating official interest in organizations concerned with tropical medicine and agriculture and in establishing contacts between his department and scientific institutions, some of which, such as the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the Commonwealth institutes of entomology and mycology, owe their inception largely to him. The early investigation of trypanosomiasis in Uganda was directly due to his influence.<br>
<br>Read's promotion within the Colonial Office was rapid: he rose to be head, in turn, of both the east and west African departments. In 1911&#150;12 he visited east Africa at a time when overseas visits by Colonial Office officials were rare. In 1916 he was appointed an assistant under-secretary of state with supervision over the two African departments. He became a prominent member of several committees which were greatly indebted to him for their achievements. This was due to his &#145;veritable genius for committee work, not only setting them up, but for seeing there was work for them to do and that they got on with it&#146;  (Mason-Bahr, 128).<br>
<br>Read was chairman of the colonial survey committee in 1905&#150;24, of the colonial advisory medical and sanitary committee in 1909&#150;24, of the committee on staffing of the agriculture departments in the colonies in 1919, and of the Bureau of Hygiene and Tropical Diseases in 1908&#150;24. He served as British delegate to several international conferences, including the African liquor conference, Brussels, 1895, the commission on the Anglo-German frontier in east Africa, Berlin, 1905, the sleeping sickness conference, London, 1907&#150;8, and the African arms traffic conference, Brussels, 1908. He was senior member of the Colonial Office delegacy to the Paris peace conference in 1919. Read went overseas as governor of Mauritius from 1925 to 1930 for the final phase of his official career. He was a vigorous governor, but his tour was hampered by the depression in the sugar industry on which the island depended, and by the death of his son there. He is remembered in Mauritius more for his good intentions than for his concrete achievements.<br>
<br>In retirement Read resumed the activities in keeping with his aptitudes, serving on a large number of committees concerned not only with scientific research but with social welfare, an interest to which he was now able to devote more time. He was an active member of the Reform Club, a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, and an honorary fellow of the Society for the Preservation of the Fauna of the Empire. He was a long-standing member of the committee of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, a crown trustee of the London Parochial Charities, chairman of the Corona Club, and Colonial Office representative on the governing body of Imperial College, and later chairman of its executive committee. He was a member of the court of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Colonial Office representative on the governing body of the Seamen's Hospital Society, and Colonial Office representative on the council of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, and later honorary vice-president of the school. These latter positions provided the institutions with a Colonial Office link.<br>
<br>Tall, stooping, and superficially shy, Read had a lovable nature and ready sense of humour, and was effusive and genial in private. He endeared himself to his junior colleagues&#151;particularly by his habit of retreating before them during discussion conducted standing up&#151;and enjoyed a happy domestic life. He married in 1905 Violet Kate (<i>d</i>. 1951), daughter of Major Duncan Maclachlan, 90th regiment; they had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>Read was appointed CMG in 1907, promoted KCMG in 1918 and GCMG in 1935, and appointed CB in 1914; he became a commander of the order of the crown of Belgium in 1919. He died at the Clarence Nursing Home, Tunbridge Wells, on 16 October 1949.<br>
