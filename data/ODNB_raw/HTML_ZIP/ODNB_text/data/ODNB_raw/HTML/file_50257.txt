<span class="headword">Mancini,  Domenico</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1434, <em>d.</em> 1494<span class="mult">x</span>1514), <span class="occ">scholar and chronicler</span>, was born in Rome. Little is known about his life. His first recorded appearance was in Paris in 1482, when he described himself as &#145;old&#146;, a term that may indicate that he was at least fifty at the time. In that year he wrote a Latin verse recommendation to a commentary on the <span class="italic">Sentences</span> of Peter Lombard by the Augustinian hermit Gregorio da Rimini (<i>d</i>. 1358). This edition marked a turning point in a philosophical controversy among Paris intellectuals, and Mancini must have been sufficiently well known to be asked to contribute by the printer or editor. His involvement suggests he was an Augustinian hermit himself; elsewhere he described himself as &#145;dedicated to the faith&#146;, and there is evidence that he wore a black habit.<br>
<br>Mancini was a competent Latinist and poet. He wrote occasional verse with elegance and ease and his prose style has been said to have &#145;the merit of clarity&#146;. Two of his verse works were printed: <span class="italic">Libellus de quatuor virtutibus</span> (1484), a traditional rehearsal of the four cardinal virtues, and <span class="italic">Tractatus de passione domini</span> (1480s), a reworking of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> texts of Christ's passion. His accomplishments as author and moralist were appreciated by his contemporaries. One of them was the humanist Robert Gaguin, Mancini's neighbour in Paris, a student of classical historians and author of the <span class="italic">Compendium</span> of the history of France (1495). In the 1480s and 1490s Gaguin was the leader of a circle of literary minded scholars and statesmen that included Angelo Cato, archbishop of Vienne, the French chancellor Guillaume de Rochefort, and Guillaume's brother. Their names can also be linked to those of Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Dutch chronicler Cornelius of Gouda, and Johann Tritheim, a scholar in the service of the emperor. All these men were interested in history and its political and didactic aspects; they visited, corresponded, and dedicated or recommended their writings to each other and used each other's work.<br>
<br>Mancini's reputation in England rests on his eyewitness account of the dramatic events between the death of Edward IV and the coronation of Richard III, from April to July 1483. His only surviving prose composition, <span class="italic">De occupatione regni Anglie per Ricardum tertium libellus</span> (&#145;A little book about the taking of the realm of England by Richard III&#146;, usually translated as &#145;The usurpation of Richard III&#146;) survives in a unique, sixteenth-century copy in the Biblioth&egrave;que Municipale at Lille; its contents remained unknown to modern scholars until it was discovered by C. A. J. Armstrong, who edited it.<br>
<br>It is not known why or for how long Mancini was in England, only that he left it shortly before Richard's coronation on 6 July 1483. He finished his account on 1 December 1483, claiming it was put on paper at the request of Angelo Cato, who had heard the story several times, found it interesting, and wished to present it to his patron, Federico, duke of Otranto. The book is carefully laid out, starting with a discussion of the situation at the time of Edward IV's death and the reasons why Richard of Gloucester decided to take the throne. The characters of some of the protagonists are discussed to explain their personal motives, but relatively little is said about Richard himself. In the description of the main events Mancini's account agrees with other sources, showing for example that rumours of the death of the &#145;princes in the Tower&#146; started very early. The author appears to be free of personal prejudice, setting out to report the truth as he saw it; he wrote in the knowledge that Richard's coup had been successful, but without the animus of later commentators writing after Richard's downfall. Mancini probably knew no English, but there must have been many willing informants among the clergy and merchants of London, fluent in French, Italian, or Latin; the only one mentioned is John Argentine (<i>d</i>. 1508), physician to the young Edward V.<br>
<br>The value of Mancini's factual information is marred by ignorance of English customs and institutions, and a strong tendency to imitate classical authors both in images and language. His report must have been of interest to French readers like Cato and Gaguin, concerned about the minority of their own king, and to men eager to discuss the proper education of princes generally, such as Erasmus and Thomas More, but there is no positive evidence that <span class="italic">De occupatione</span> became widely known. Mancini's own lack of prejudice left his story open to very different interpretations by modern commentators.<br>
