<span class="headword">Thomas,  Vaughan</span>  (1775&#150;1858), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was born on 18 August 1775 at Kingston, Surrey, where he was baptized on 20 September 1775, the son of John Thomas, of the same place, and his wife, Frances. Having matriculated from Oriel College, Oxford, on 17 December 1792, he was admitted a scholar of Corpus Christi College on 6 May 1794. He graduated BA in 1796 (MA, 1800; BD, 1809), and in 1803 was elected to a fellowship at Corpus. He was appointed vicar of Yarnton, Oxfordshire, in February 1803; vicar of Stoneleigh, Warwickshire, in June 1804; and rector of Duntisbourne Rouse, Gloucestershire, in March 1811. These three lucrative livings he held in plurality until the end of his life, while continuing to reside in Oxford. From 1814 he also acted as curate of Begbroke, Oxfordshire, on behalf of John Cooke, president of Corpus (1783&#150;1823) and rector of Begbroke and Wood Eaton. In October 1811 he resigned his fellowship on his marriage to Charlotte, daughter of the Revd John Williams, vicar of Catherington, Hampshire. They had no children. She was the sister of George Williams MD, fellow of Corpus, regius professor of botany, and physician to the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford.<br>
<br>Thomas was a conservative protestant high-churchman who deployed his formidable powers of management in combating every manifestation of the spirit of the age in the church and the university. In 1821 he opposed the candidacy of Richard Heber for the Oxford parliamentary seat on the grounds of Heber's alleged sympathy with the cause of Catholic emancipation. In 1831 Thomas published a pamphlet on <span class="italic">The Legality of the Present Academical System of the University of Oxford</span>, challenging the proposals for reform made by Sir William Hamilton in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>. As chaplain of his college from 1832 to 1844 he made it his campaign headquarters during a period of unprecedented controversy. In 1833 he was a co-founder of an association formed to defend orthodox doctrine, and in 1834&#150;5 he masterminded the successful resistance to the admission of dissenters to the university. In February 1836 he was chairman of the &#145;Corpus committee&#146; which co-ordinated the protest against the appointment of R. D. Hampden as regius professor of divinity. On all these issues he had the support of the Tractarians, but this marriage of convenience broke up after 1838, when Thomas was one of the prime movers behind the proposal to erect a memorial at Oxford to the protestant martyrs. The same year he published an attack on proposals for a general revision of the university statutes. He continued to defend the <i>status quo</i> until his death, and his critique of Sir William Hamilton's proposals was re-issued in 1853 at the height of the debate on university reform.<br>
<br>Thomas was energetic in his promotion of philanthropic and evangelical causes. It was he who prompted his friend Samuel Warneford to endow an asylum at Oxford for the insane which opened in 1826. In 1827 he published <span class="italic">An Account of the Origin, Nature and Objects of the Asylum on Headington Hill</span>, which sought to educate the public about mental illness. He was a shrewd chairman of the asylum's management committee for twenty-one years, combining broad vision with meticulous attention to detail. Physical exercise and occupational therapy were essential features of the benevolent regime, and restraint was kept to a minimum. Thomas himself designed the layout of the buildings and landscaped grounds. Patients were segregated by class and sex, and he was at pains to prevent &#145;intercourse by conversation and letter-writing&#146; between males and females  (<span class="roman">visitors' book</span>, 28 July 1834, 2). In 1828 he instituted a &#145;fund for poor patients&#146;, named after him.<br>
<br>Because of his local reputation for administrative competence, Thomas was appointed chairman of the board of health formed at Oxford in June 1832 upon the outbreak of cholera. His <span class="italic">Memorials of the Malignant Cholera in Oxford</span> (1835), which took its text from Thucydides' account of the Athenian plague, provides a carefully documented account of the epidemic and the measures taken to combat it, as well as a historical survey of previous epidemics and their causes.<br>
<br>A long-standing visitor and governor of the Radcliffe Infirmary, Thomas was assiduous in his attention to matters of diet, medication, and hygiene, and vigilant in maintaining the moral tone of the establishment. He was insistent that the hospital should promote godliness as well as physical health: the &#145;disorderly&#146; were excluded, and even the reading matter of the patients did not escape his scrutiny. This pastoral zeal is evident also in his campaign to establish a residential college to provide for the tutelary care of students at the Birmingham Royal School of Medicine, also endowed by Warneford. Both he and Warneford were concerned to &#145;stamp the [medical] curriculum with the impress and signature of revealed truth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christian Philanthropy Exemplified in a Memoir of the Revd S. W. Warneford</span>, 1856, 11).<br>
<br>Thomas was active in resisting the secularization of village schools, and maintained that the children of the poor should be taught only what they required for their spiritual welfare and the maintenance of their station in life. Anything that might encourage social mobility was to be discouraged. A watchful custodian of his parish charities, he excluded non-churchgoers and known reprobates from the list of beneficiaries. He served for many years as a justice of the peace, earning a reputation among poachers for the severity of his sentences, and he was equally draconian in his pronouncements on prison administration.<br>
<br>Thomas published nearly fifty works, mostly tracts and pamphlets of a controversial nature. His long association with Stoneleigh bore fruit in a laborious <span class="italic">Italian Biography of Sir Robert Dudley</span> (1861), and he was the author of some other antiquarian papers. After his wife's death in 1843 he married, in Brussels, on 4 December 1845, Catherine (1791/2&#150;1871), daughter of Lieutenant-General G. Johnston of Norbiton Hill, Surrey. He moved from Holywell Street to a house at 83 High Street, overlooking Magdalen Bridge. He died there on 26 October 1858, and was buried on 2 November in his first wife's grave in the churchyard of St Peter-in-the-East.<br>
