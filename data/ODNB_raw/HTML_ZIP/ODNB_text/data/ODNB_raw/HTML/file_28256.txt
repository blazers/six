<span class="headword">Vescy,  William  de</span>, Lord Vescy  (1245&#150;1297), <span class="occ">baron</span>, was born on 19 September 1245, the second son of William de Vescy (<i>d</i>. 1253), lord of Alnwick, Northumberland, and of Agnes, the daughter of William de Ferrers and his wife, Sybil, one of the daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18127/', "William (II) Marshal")</script>, who divided his vast inheritance on the death of their brother Anselm. William senior died in 1253 and was succeeded by his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28254/', "John de Vescy")</script>, who died without heirs in 1289, leaving the family estate to the younger William, who was then forty-three years old. When his mother died in 1290 Vescy inherited a large portion of the county of Kildare in Ireland, as well as property in England. In middle age he became the head of an impressive patrimony in England and Ireland and took on royal service commensurate with his new status.<br>
<br>As a younger son, William de Vescy only occasionally appears in royal records before his brother's death, and his early career clearly followed his brother's. John was an adherent of Simon de Montfort and was wounded and captured at Evesham on 4 August 1265. Like his brother, William supported the barons, and had attempted to hold Gloucester Castle against the Lord Edward earlier in June. After a further bout of rebelliousness in the north in 1267, John de Vescy became Edward's close companion, joined him on crusade in 1270&#150;72, and, as his household knight, subsequently performed a variety of tasks, notably as a soldier and ambassador. In 1276 Edward pardoned the two brothers for depredations committed during the barons' wars, and William was given protection to go on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. William stood surety for John in a debt to the king, and in 1280 was described as one of his brother's household knights. In 1289, after his brother died, William was given custody of Scarborough Castle to hold on the same terms on which John had held it.<br>
<br>During the 1280s William de Vescy began to carve out a career for himself in royal service. He was summoned to perform military service in Wales in 1277, 1282, and again in 1283, and was summoned to parliaments and royal councils in 1283, 1288, and 1295, in consequence coming to be styled Lord Vescy. In 1285 Edward appointed him justice of the forest north of the Trent, and in 1290 named him one of his envoys to treat with the Scots. He also placed him on commissions of gaol delivery and oyer and terminer.<br>
<br>The year 1290 marked a new phase of Vescy's career, for Edward appointed him justiciar of Ireland, demonstrating how his inheritance there could divert Vescy's attention from his interests as a substantial landholder in the north of England. He had to step down as justice of the forest, and Edward immediately granted the office to Vescy's son, John. Vescy received his commission on 12 September, and landed in Ireland two months later on 11 November. Conditions in Ireland were very disturbed, so that besides the &pound;500 allotted to him yearly to maintain him in his office, he was to receive an additional &pound;500 in time of war. In fact Vescy incurred expenses at once for campaigning against the Irish and maintaining a force of Welsh retainers. In 1291 his attention turned briefly to Scotland. Not only was he summoned to serve in Scotland, but more importantly, after the death of Princess Margaret, he put in a claim to the throne of Scotland based on his descent from his grandmother Margaret, an illegitimate daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29452/', "William the Lion, king of Scots")</script> [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93692', "Competitors for the throne of Scotland")</script>]. His son, John, represented him in the process, but Vescy did not pursue the claim vigorously, and abandoned the effort just before Edward made his pronouncement on 17 November 1292.<br>
<br>Various disputes arising out of Vescy's overbearing conduct as justiciar and as lord of the liberty of Kildare demanded his attention in these years. In 1291 the abbot of St Thomas's, Dublin, accused Vescy and the other Marshal coheirs of unjustly impleading him in the court of the liberty. The case took a serious turn when Vescy went ahead and heard the plea anyway after the king had prohibited him from proceeding. Additional accusations, ranging from unjustly taking distresses, issuing prohibitions, proving weights and measures, and harassing officials, to falsely maintaining individuals in suits, were heard by king and council at the parliament at Westminster in October 1293. Edward ordered an inquiry, and the subsequent inquests conducted in March 1294 found Vescy and his men guilty of many transgressions.<br>
<br>The most sensational dispute involved John fitz Thomas Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1316), lord of Offaly, who was Vescy's tenant. Tensions between them mounted to the point that the king intervened in 1293, and ordered Vescy to revoke a military summons that he had issued to raise an army to march on Offaly. Fitz Thomas lodged several of the accusations against Vescy heard in parliament in 1293. The following year Vescy accused fitz Thomas of defaming him before the king and council, by alleging that Vescy had tried to persuade him to enter into a sworn compact against the king. Fitz Thomas denied this accusation, but claimed that Vescy had said even more explosive things about the king, telling him that the Irish were a miserable people, but could be great lords and do without the king. If they knew Edward as well as he did, they would value him less for he was the most perverse and dastardly knight in the kingdom. And he recounted a story of Edward's conduct at Kenilworth during the barons' wars that showed him to be a coward. Outraged, Vescy denied the charges and offered to wage battle to prove his right. The king removed the case to England and ordered fitz Thomas and Vescy to appear before him on July 24. Vescy showed up, armed and ready for battle. Fitz Thomas did not appear, and the case was adjourned several times before it was finally nullified in parliament in 1295.<br>
<br>William de Vescy was removed as justiciar in 1294. Despite his record, Edward bore him no ill will, for Vescy was with the king in Wales in April 1295, was summoned to parliament in June, and was reappointed justice of the forest the following September. Indeed, Langtoft called him a &#145;prudent and wise knight&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronicle of Pierre de Langtoft</span>, 2.231). Preparing for the campaign in Gascony of 1296, in October 1295 Vescy received permission to make a grant in mortmain to the prior and convent of Malton, while in December Edward promised that if Vescy died in Gascony he would charge his heirs for any outstanding debts.<br>
<br>Vescy was summoned to serve again in Gascony in 1297, but he died on 19 July. His wife was Isabel, the second daughter and coheir of Adam of Periton, of Ellington, Northumberland, and the widow of Robert of Welle, who had died in 1265. Their only son, John, died in Wales on 27 April 1295, and in his last years Vescy was much concerned with the inheritance of his estates. In 1296, therefore, he engaged in several transactions with Antony (I) Bek, bishop of Durham (<i>d</i>. 1311), to make his bastard son, another <a name="cosubject_28256"></a><span class="headword">William  de Vescy</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Sir William  de Vescy of Kildare]</span>, Lord Vescy  (<em>d.</em> 1314)<span class="occ"></span>, the inheritor of a number of his English estates. But in 1297 he surrendered the county of Kildare and other Irish lands to the king, and received them back on condition that they would revert to the crown when he died. In return, Edward pardoned all debts and fines to the crown incurred by Vescy as justiciar of Ireland and justice of the forest, as well as the debts owed by his brother John. He was likewise pardoned for all legal actions against him from the time he was justiciar and justice.<br>
<br>After his father's death William of Kildare seems to have succeeded by stages to the lands entailed upon him by his father. He did homage for Caythorpe in Lincolnshire on 22 May 1298, and was summoned to serve in Scotland in 1300 as having lands worth more than &pound;40 per annum in that county, but a petition from early in Edward II's reign, asking the king &#145;to enforce the covenants between the bishop of Durham and his father&#146;  (<span class="italic">CDS</span>, 3, no. 187), suggests that he was slow to obtain livery of his inheritance elsewhere. Later allegations that Bishop Bek defrauded William of the honour of Alnwick by selling it to Henry Percy have been shown to be baseless. In 1310 Vescy litigated against the widow of his half-brother, John de Vescy, for the Lincolnshire manor of Stapleford, claiming that his father had assigned it to her as dower with reversion to himself, but no judgment is recorded. None the less at the time of his death William held a number of manors in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. He is recorded as a knight of Edward II's household, which may explain the summonses to parliament directed to him in 1313 and 1314; he is thus regarded as having become Lord Vescy in his own right. But it was as a retainer of the earl of Pembroke that he fought at Bannockburn, where he was killed on 24 June 1314. According to Dugdale he married Maud, widow of Thomas Neville of Cleatham, Lincolnshire, but this is unlikely. His heir was his distant cousin Gilbert Aton, who succeeded to all that was left of the Vescy inheritance.<br>
