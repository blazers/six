<span class="headword">Swanwick <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Sickert]</span>,  Helena Maria Lucy</span>  (1864&#150;1939), <span class="occ">suffragist</span>, was born in Munich, Bavaria, in 1864, the only daughter of Oswald Adalbert Sickert (1828&#150;1885), a commercial artist of Danish origin (who became a German by virtue of the Prussian invasion of Schleswig-Holstein), and his wife, Eleanor Louisa Moravia Henry (1830&#150;1922), the illegitimate daughter of a professional dancer and a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. She had three brothers, of whom the eldest was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36083/', "Walter Sickert")</script>, the artist. In 1868 the Sickerts moved to England and settled first in Bedford, and then in Notting Hill, London, where they were part of an artistic and literary circle that included the families of William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones, and later Oscar Wilde.<br>
<br>Helena was educated at a French boarding-school in Neuville, and then at Notting Hill high school. In 1882 she went to Girton College, Cambridge, where she studied with Henry Sidgwick, Alfred Marshall, and Neville Keynes. She gained second-class honours in the moral sciences tripos (1885). In 1885 she was appointed lecturer in psychology at Westfield College, London. In 1888 she married Frederick Tertius Swanwick (1851&#150;1931), a Cambridge wrangler and lecturer in mathematics at Owens College, Manchester (later to become Manchester University). He was the son of Thomas Swanwick, a Manchester merchant from a Unitarian family. There were no children of the marriage. Helena Swanwick became a close friend of C. P. Scott and his wife, Rachel, and over the next eighteen years wrote and reviewed regularly for the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> on domestic and feminist subjects and gardening. Her first book, <span class="italic">The Small Town Garden</span>, was published in 1907.<br>
<br>Swanwick also did voluntary work in a girls' club, which brought her into contact with the local women's trade union council, the Women's Co-operative Guild, and ultimately the Labour Party. Through them she met Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters, and became involved in the women's suffrage movement. However, she found the physical force tactics employed by the Pankhursts unacceptable, and in 1905 joined the North of England Suffrage Society, which was affiliated to Millicent Fawcett's National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. In 1908 she addressed 150 mass meetings in all parts of Britain, and in 1909&#150;14 was editor of the suffragist newspaper, the <span class="italic">Common Cause</span>.<br>
<br>In 1914 Swanwick resigned from the paper because of differences with her colleagues over the issue of war, and became a member of the executive committee of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95108', "Union of Democratic Control")</script>, founded by E. D. Morel to campaign against secret diplomacy. From 1915 to 1922 she was chairman of the Women's International League for Peace, which aimed to harness feminism to the peace movement; and throughout the First World War she campaigned for a negotiated peace and the establishment of an international peace-keeping organization. She was highly critical, however, of the terms under which the League of Nations was set up in 1919, partly because the league was permitted the use of force and economic sanctions, and partly because it was committed to supporting the Versailles settlement, which she regarded from the start as an unjust and unstable peace. In 1920&#150;21 she campaigned against the activities of the Black and Tans in Ireland, and in 1923&#150;4 she campaigned against the French invasion of the Ruhr (the latter she saw as legitimizing renascent German nationalism).<br>
<br>Swanwick published a history of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95108', "Union of Democratic Control")</script>, <span class="italic">Builders of Peace</span> (1924), and from 1925 to 1928 was editor of the organization's journal, <span class="italic">Foreign Affairs</span>, which she aimed to make a more popular and widely read journal. Through its columns she continually attacked the &#145;war guilt&#146; clause of the Versailles treaty, denounced the &#145;tragic-comedy&#146; of the Locarno treaty, and argued that the new phenomenon of aerial bombardment had made any form of war an intolerable option, however just its cause. In 1924 and again in 1928&#150;31 she was a member of the British empire delegation to the League of Nations assembly. In 1929 she visited Bavaria for the first time since her childhood: a visit that reinforced her sense of cultural sympathy with Germany, and of the injustice to the German people meted out by Versailles.<br>
<br>In 1930 Helena Swanwick was appointed CH for her services to &#145;peace and the enfranchisement of women&#146;. Throughout the 1930s, however, she was an increasingly isolated figure. Her husband died in 1931; and she found herself increasingly estranged both from moderate members of the peace movement (who disliked her attacks on the League of Nations), and from its more extremist members (who disliked her refusal to countenance violent revolution). Her own stance in this period was one not of pure pacifism, but of non-interventionism and isolationism&#151;a position that she defended on largely pragmatic grounds. She outlined her ideas and the rationale behind them in a very attractively written autobiography, <span class="italic">I have been Young</span> (1935). But her differences with other peace campaigners were reinforced by the rise of Nazism, and by her publication of <span class="italic">Collective Insecurity</span> (1937) and <span class="italic">The Roots of Peace</span> (1938). These books defended Adolf Hitler's foreign policies as no different from those of other imperialists, past and present, and claimed that nothing could be done about his uncivilized domestic policies (any more than the equally objectionable policies of Soviet Russia). Instead she argued for the development of a federal Europe, with communal control of all vital strategic areas, and for the cultivation of an &#145;international mind&#146; among European citizens. In the context of the late 1930s such proposals confirmed her separation from all sections of British politics. She committed suicide on 16 November 1939 at her home, Satis, Boulters Lane, Maidenhead, Berkshire, after the outbreak of the Second World War.<br>
