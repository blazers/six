<span class="headword">Vane <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Stewart]</span>,  Charles William</span>, third marquess of Londonderry  (1778&#150;1854), <span class="occ">army officer and diplomatist</span>, was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26506/', "Robert Stewart, first marquess of Londonderry (1739&#150;1821)")</script>, and his second wife, Frances (<i>d</i>. 18 January 1833, aged eighty-two), eldest daughter of Charles Pratt, first Earl Camden. He was born in Mary Street, Dublin, on 18 May 1778, and was thus nine years younger than his half-brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26507/', "Robert Stewart, second marquess")</script>, better known as Lord Castlereagh. Charles was raised as an Anglican, in contrast to the family's Presbyterian tradition, and was educated at Eton College (1790&#150;94), where at the age of thirteen he narrowly escaped drowning in a vain attempt to save the life of his schoolfellow Lord Waldegrave.<h2>
<a name="Earlymilitaryservice"></a>Early military service</h2>At the age of sixteen, on 11 October 1794, he was commissioned an ensign in a newly raised regiment of foot (Macnamara's), in which he became lieutenant on 30 October and captain on 12 November. He obtained a majority in the 106th foot on 31 July 1795, but both this and his former regiment were disbanded in that year. He was employed on the staff of Lord Moira's corps in the campaign of 1794&#150;5 in the Netherlands. He then accompanied Colonel Craufurd to the headquarters of the Austrian army, and served with it in the campaigns of 1795&#150;6 on the Rhine and upper Danube. At Donauworth he was struck by a bullet, the ball entering the right side of his face, passing under his nose, and lodging in his left cheek, subsequently leaving his sight impaired.<br>
<br>Having briefly served as aide-de-camp to his uncle, Lord Camden, the lord lieutenant of Ireland, on 4 August 1796 Stewart obtained a majority in the 5th dragoons (Royal Irish); he became lieutenant-colonel of the regiment on 1 January 1797. The 5th dragoons served in Ireland during the uprising of 1798, but were disbanded as potentially disloyal on 8 April 1799. Lord Cornwallis, however, expressed the hope that since Stewart's individual exertions had been &#145;as meritorious as possible&#146; his worth should not be &#145;suffered to pass unnoticed&#146;, and with the concurrence of the duke of York he was within four days made lieutenant-colonel of the 18th light dragoons  (Charles, marquess of Londonderry, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 1st ser., 2.105&#150;6, 112). Stewart served in the short campaign of 1799 in the Netherlands. He was attached to Abercromby's division on 19 September, and to Pulteney's on 2 October, and was again slightly wounded on outpost duty at Schagenburg on 10 October. On 25 September 1803 he was made aide-de-camp to the king and colonel in the army. Shortly afterwards he was appointed under-secretary in Ireland. He had been elected member for Thomastown in the Irish parliament in March 1800, and for County Londonderry (where his family owned estates) in May; after the union he was member for County Londonderry in the imperial parliament from 1801 until 1814, serving as under-secretary to his half-brother at the war department in 1807.<h2>
<a name="ThePeninsularWar"></a>The Peninsular War</h2>In August 1808 Stewart left his office for a time to command the hussar brigade in the corps sent out to Portugal under Sir John Moore. The brigade, composed of the 18th and the King's German hussars, to which the 10th hussars were later added, covered Hope's advance on Madrid and Salamanca in November, and afterwards the retreat of the whole army on Corunna. Stewart was critical of Moore, who in turn thought Stewart a &#145;very silly fellow&#146;  (Fortescue, <span class="italic">Brit. army</span>, 6.319), though publicly he praised Stewart and Paget for the spirit they had inspired in the cavalry. Stewart returned to England and to his office in January 1809, but in April 1809, on the recommendation of Castlereagh, he went back to Portugal as adjutant-general under Sir Arthur Wellesley (later Viscount Wellington), with the rank of brigadier-general. He was promoted major-general on 25 July, and served as adjutant-general throughout the campaigns of 1810 and 1811. Stewart was full of praise for Wellington, but the latter shared Moore's reservations, especially as regards the pretensions Stewart brought to his position as adjutant-general. <span class="italic">The Times</span> commented that &#145;it was never pretended that the Marquis of Londonderry possessed the qualities of a great military commander&#146;, but added that &#145;there never was a braver soldier in the British army&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 March 1854, 9). At Rueda his dashing attack unfortunately gave away the British positions; at Porto his charge with a squadron of the 14th dragoons resulted in severe casualties. No one doubted his gallantry; Wellington mentioned him in his dispatches following Busaco and Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro; he singled him out for repeated praise for his actions at Porto, while the French commander, Foy, described his action as &#145;un charge incroyable&#146;. The thanks of the House of Commons were voted to him after Talavera, and Wellington told Liverpool that Stewart behaved with &#145;his usual gallantry&#146; at Cuidad Rodrigo  (Oman, 341; <span class="italic">Despatches, Correspondence</span>, 2nd ser., 4.321&#150;4, 5.309). Wellington, however, refused to trust him with a substantial cavalry command, telling the duke of York that, with his defective sight and hearing, his gallantry would be apt to lead him into difficulties &#145;from which even the superiority of our men and horses would not be able to extricate our cavalry&#146;. Years later, Wellington told Croker that Stewart used to harass the cavalry to death by constant patrols and reconnaissances. This, he added, &#145;I was obliged to forbid, but he refused to obey me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Supplementary Despatches</span>, 7.165&#150;6; <span class="italic">Croker</span>, 1.346). Moore, with some justification, and Wellington with less, believed Stewart intrigued in London behind their backs. His direct line to the war department was unsettling to his commanders, for, as Wellington told Croker in 1826, &#145;Castlereagh had a real respect for Charles's understanding, and a high opinion of his good sense and discretion. This seems incomprehensible to us who knew the two men&#146;  (<span class="italic">Croker</span>, 1.346).<h2>
<a name="Diplomacy"></a>Diplomacy</h2>With the rejection of his repeated requests for a new cavalry command, on the return of his half-brother to office as foreign secretary, Stewart embarked on a diplomatic career. As he later confessed to Lord Clarendon, though he had &#145;no trade but the sword&#146;, a &#145;smatter&#146; of diplomacy had come his way  (Londonderry to Clarendon, 19 Nov 1851). Having been made KB on 1 February 1813, and having received the Portuguese order of the Tower and Sword on 27 March (he was to receive the gold medal with one clasp in the following year for his services in the Peninsula), Stewart was appointed on 9 April 1813 British minister to the court of Berlin; he was &#145;specially charged with the military superintendent, so far as Great Britain is concerned, of the Prussian and Swedish armies&#146;. He reached the headquarters of the allies at Dresden on 26 April, and signed the formal treaty of alliance between Great Britain, Russia, and Prussia. To his chagrin he missed the battle at Lutzen; but he was actively engaged at Bautzen, and he took part in Blucher's cavalry stroke at Haynau on 26 May. He helped to storm one of the redoubts at Dresden, and was severely wounded at Kulm. At Leipzig (16 October) Blucher gave him the command of his reserve cavalry, and he captured a battery at the head of the Brandenburg hussars. He was said, as ambassador, to be &#145;always at the post of danger&#146;, and &#145;to have no other object in view than to go in quest of death wherever it is most likely to be found&#146;  (<span class="italic">Supplementary Despatches</span>, 8.353).<br>
<br>But it was in bringing pressure upon Bernadotte that Stewart was of most service to the cause of the allies. Recognizing Bernadotte's reluctance to attack his countrymen, Stewart, using &#145;outrageous&#146; plain speaking, brought him to undertake a limited advance at Leipzig  (Brett-James, 204&#150;5), and he prevented the completion of a convention under which Davout would have been allowed to return to France with 30,000 troops. During the campaign of 1814 Stewart, who had been made colonel of the 25th light dragoons on 20 November 1813, was present at the actions of La Rothi&egrave;re, F&egrave;re-Champenoise, and Montmartre, and at the entry into Paris on 31 March. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 4 June.<br>
<br>Bernadotte &#145;a pr&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute; ses inter&ecirc;ts &agrave; ses passions&#146;  (ibid., 212), in creating Stewart knight grand cross of the sword of Sweden (25 October 1813), but his elevation to the peerage as Baron Stewart of Stewart's Court and Ballylawn, co. Donegal, rumours of which were abroad in 1813, but which was finally gazetted on 1 July 1814, marked genuine regard for his services, as well as Castlereagh's favour. He also received the order of the Black Eagle (30 September 1813), and of the Red Eagle (12 March 1814) of Prussia, and the Russian order of St George (fourth class) (30 September 1813). He received an honorary DCL from Oxford (16 June 1814) and an honorary LLD from Cambridge (July 1814), and was sworn of the privy council on 22 July 1814. On the enlargement of the Bath he received the GCB (January 1815), and in March 1816 the GCH.<h2>
<a name="AmbassadoratVienna"></a>Ambassador at Vienna</h2>On 27 August 1814 Stewart was appointed ambassador at Vienna. He assisted Castlereagh, and afterwards Wellington, in the negotiations of the congress there, being especially concerned with the affairs of Switzerland. His chief function, and one in which his skill was acknowledged, was as a verbatim note-taker, but Castlereagh also used him as a trusted messenger to England. At Vienna his love of finery in dress earned him the name &#145;the golden peacock&#146; and made him ridiculous; his drinking attracted unfavourable comment; and his womanizing shocked the diarist Charles Greville, as well as attracting the attention of the Austrian secret police. As well as patronizing the brothels of Vienna, as a handsome widower, Stewart's name had been linked with Lady Priscilla Burghersh and the Princess Bagration, before he resumed an affair, begun while recuperating from his wound at Kulm, with the duchess of Sagan. Nevertheless Castlereagh confirmed him as British representative at the congresses of Troppau in 1820, and Laybach in 1821, and he was at Verona with Wellington in 1822. More sceptical of Metternich that the gullible Aberdeen, Stewart played the difficult role assigned to him, of participating without committing his government, with some skill.<h2>
<a name="MarquessofLondonderry"></a>Marquess of Londonderry</h2>By his brother's death on 12 August 1822 Stewart became marquess of Londonderry, and when he found that Canning was to take the Foreign Office he tendered his resignation; but at Canning's request he remained until the end of the year to assist Wellington at Verona. Nevertheless he sought to persuade fellow ambassadors, such as Cathcart, to help in resisting the new foreign secretary. His devotion to his brother, which was to persist throughout his life, was largely responsible for his hatred of Canning, and also made him suspicious of Wellington, leading to hostility between the two men at Verona, and setting a pattern of alternating distrust of, and regard for, the duke that was also to remain a feature of Stewart's career. In 1823, on his return from Verona, he demanded of Liverpool a diplomatic pension, causing the prime minister (who had already experienced great difficulties with Stewart's demands for the reversion of his brother's command of the County Londonderry militia, and the granting of the British peerage promised to his late brother) to write on the offending letter &#145;This is too bad&#146;, a phrase that was to be thrown at Stewart, now Londonderry, by his enemies for the rest of his life. The prime minister and others saw him as greedy and grasping; for his part Stewart pointed out that he had resigned the lordship of the bedchamber he had held since 1814, as well as resigning the governorship of Fort Charles in Jamaica (to which he had been appointed in 1809) to facilitate the government's arrangements with Bloomfield.<h2>
<a name="Marriagesandpolitics"></a>Marriages and politics</h2>On 8 August 1804 Stewart had married Lady Catherine Bligh (<i>b</i>. 1774), daughter of the third earl of Darnley. She died on 11 February 1812, while he was on his way home from Spain, leaving one son. On 3 April 1819 he married, against the protests of her family, Frances Anne Emily Vane-Tempest (<i>d</i>. 1865) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41159/', "Vane, Frances Anne")</script>], only daughter of Sir Harry Vane-Tempest, and of Anne, <i>suo jure</i> countess of Antrim, and heir to very large estates in co. Durham and the north of Ireland. On his marriage he took the surname Vane, and on 28 March 1823 he was created Earl Vane and Viscount Seaham in the peerage of the United Kingdom, with remainder to the eldest son by his second marriage.<br>
<br>Having failed in an attempt, prompted by his own and his sister-in-law's antipathy to Canning, to establish an independent political connection with Camden and other associates of his late brother, the new Lord Londonderry devoted himself to establishing a political power base in Ireland and co. Durham. In co. Down he renewed his family's alliance with the Hills; in Durham he achieved, until 1831, a similar understanding with the Lambtons. This latter, though surviving the accession to office of Lord Grey, with whom Londonderry, once again estranged from Wellington, expressed sympathy, failed to survive the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, of which Londonderry became one of the most bitter opponents, being at one point almost dragged from his horse by a pro-reform mob, and having to be forcibly restrained in his place in the Lords from interrupting William IV's dissolution in 1831.<br>
<br>As a reward for his considerable expenditure in the Conservative cause, amounting in his own estimation to &pound;30,000, in 1835, during Peel's short administration, he was offered and accepted the embassy at St Petersburg; the appointment was, however, bitterly attacked in the House of Commons on 13 March, on the grounds of Londonderry's unsuitability as an ambassador, and his pro-Russian stance on the Polish revolt. Wellington, as foreign secretary, had told Greville:<blockquote>that he was not particularly partial to the man, nor ever had been; but that he was very fit for that post, was an excellent ambassador, procured more information and obtained more insight into the affairs of a foreign court than anybody, and that he was the best relater of what passed at a conference, and wrote the best account of a conversation, of any man he knew. (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 15 March 1835)</blockquote>But in the face of the Commons' attack Londonderry, to save the government embarrassment, withdrew. Partly in compensation Peel offered Londonderry his old job at Vienna in 1841 (in spite of Queen Victoria's request that Londonderry should not be offered employment), but Londonderry's sense of self-importance and pretensions to other office (he wanted the Paris embassy, or the lord lieutenant of Ireland) made him decline. He nevertheless remained a supporter of Peel until 1850, though the latter failed to appreciate the complex local factors which induced Londonderry to support John Bright at the Durham City by-election of July 1843, in preference to a Conservative. Similar local considerations also induced him to oppose his own son at County Down in 1852.<br>
<br>In co. Durham he threw himself enthusiastically into his second wife's coal concerns, investing heavily in property, and recruiting the foremost mining viewer of his day, John Buddle, as his agent. Seaham harbour was commissioned and built by him, exporting its first coal in 1831. That year also saw Londonderry settle a coal strike, following a face-to-face meeting with the union leader, Thomas Hepburn, to the disgust of his fellow owners. High expectations were held out that he would perform a similar function in the 1844 coal strike, and miners' delegates appealed to him to arbitrate the dispute. When, however, Londonderry refused to do so, the miners turned against him; his habit of issuing paternalistic ukases played into the hands of his critics, and popular mythology from then on unjustly cast him as the arch villain of the north-east coal trade, citing his opposition to the <span class="roman">Coal Mines Act</span> of 1842 as evidence for their view. Though Londonderry was in theory a wealthy man, the fluctuations of the coal trade, his electioneering expenditure, and his personal extravagance meant that he was always in financial difficulties&#151;so much so that in 1834 it was feared he would follow his half-brother's example of suicide.<br>
<br>Londonderry fought two duels, the first against Cornet Battier, of the 10th hussars, of which he had become colonel on 3 February 1820, for which he was soundly reprimanded by the Horse Guards; and the second against Henry Grattan the younger in 1839 for an alleged slight over the so-called &#145;bedchamber&#146; crisis. In each case Londonderry received his adversary's fire, and then discharged his own pistol in the air.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>On 10 January 1837 Londonderry became general, and on 21 June 1843 he was transferred from the 10th hussars to the 2nd Life Guards. He had been appointed governor of co. Londonderry in 1823, and one of the joint-governors of co. Down in 1824; and he was made lord lieutenant of Durham on 27 April 1842. His lingering military ambitions were rebuffed by Derby, to whom he had transferred his political allegiance, when the latter declined to appoint him MGO in 1852. Derby, however, sought to compensate him on 19 January 1853 by awarding him the Garter made vacant by Wellington's death.<br>
<br>Londonderry was one of the pallbearers at Wellington's funeral, but he did not long survive his old chief. He died at his home, Holdernesse House, Park Lane, London, on 6 March 1854, from influenza, and was buried on 16 March at Long Newton, near Wynyard Park, co. Durham, where his widow (who died on 20 January 1865, after continuing, to the admiration of Londonderry's friend, Disraeli, to manage the colliery enterprises following his death) built a &#145;memorial-room&#146; for the insignia of his orders and other relics of him. An equestrian statue of him by Gaetano Monti was unveiled in the market place at Durham by Disraeli on 2 December 1861.<br>
<br>Londonderry's only son from his first marriage, Frederick William Robert Stewart (1805&#150;1872), succeeded as fourth marquess of Londonderry. Londonderry had three sons and four daughters from his second marriage. The eldest of these sons, George Henry Robert Charles William Vane-Tempest (1821&#150;1884), succeeded him as Earl Vane, and (by the death of his half-brother) became fifth marquess of Londonderry on 25 November 1872.<br>
