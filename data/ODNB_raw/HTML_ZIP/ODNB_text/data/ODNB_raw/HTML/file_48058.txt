<span class="headword">Mercer,  Thomas</span>  (1822&#150;1900), <span class="occ">maker of marine chronometers, watches, and clocks</span>, was born in November 1822 at St Helens, the second of three children of Richard Mercer (<i>d</i>. 1830), sailmaker and barge builder, and his wife, Sarah. In 1836 Sarah married Samuel Fletcher, manager of the Bridgewater Canal. Fletcher did not accept young Thomas, who was therefore apprenticed to his grandfather William Walker (1783&#150;1860), a watch-movement maker at Duke Street, St Helens. His apprenticeship duties included on occasion walking from St Helens to Liverpool to deliver a basket of uncased watch movements to his uncle at 108 Homer Street, though his grandmother insisted that he should also attend the local school. In 1843 he went to work for Thomas Russell at 30&#150;32 Slater Street, Liverpool, in order to learn from the top of the trade. In his free time he made watches, which he signed and sold under his own name. While in Liverpool, he absorbed the radical views then current, his support for these ideas earning him the nickname of &#145;Radical Tom&#146;, though he did not join any political group.<br>
<br>In 1854, having decided that the English watch and clock industry held no future for him, Mercer took a coach to London and purchased a one-way ticket to America, a land where, he said, everyone was equal and where he would be able to make progress. Fate decided his future, however, for while awaiting passage he saw a marine chronometer in the shop window of John Fletcher, one of the most important chronometer makers of the day. He entered the shop to ask for work, and was accepted as a watch springer and finisher. During this period, the Greenwich premium trials were being held, to enable the Royal Navy to find makers capable of supplying and servicing chronometers that could be relied on to perform accurately and consistently under the extremes of temperature and motion encountered at sea. High prices were paid for chronometers that passed these trials. Mercer left Fletcher's service in 1858 to set up on his own as a chronometer maker at New North Road, London, moving to 45 Spencer Street, Clerkenwell, in 1860 and later to other addresses in Clerkenwell. He had to face considerable competition in his chosen craft. Thomas Earnshaw and John Arnold, the two great modernizers of the marine chronometer, were long dead, but Dent, Frodsham, Blackie, the Poole brothers, Reid, and the Scandinavians Kullberg and Johannsen were all established and active in this lucrative field.<br>
<br>Mercer became involved in the British Horological Institute, which had been established in 1858 and was reputed to be the oldest professional institute in the world for that discipline. He served as its honorary treasurer from 1875 to 1895, and lectured there on the need to modernize the industry and to train young people. In 1874 he moved to St Albans, setting up a factory behind his house at 14&#150;15 Prospect Road. Each Friday he travelled the 20 miles to collect finished parts from his specialist outworkers in Clerkenwell and call into the Horological Institute. In 1890, feeling the need to have a London address on his dials and letterheads, he took an office at 81 Westmoreland Place, City Road.<br>
<br>Mercer's marriage to Mary Thompson, daughter of a St Albans newspaper reporter, on 15 May 1875, was held at the church of St John in Holloway, so that many of his old friends and competitors could attend. The couple had seven children in six years: three boys and two sets of girl twins. Success in the Greenwich trials was the key to Mercer's profitable business: he entered at least one chronometer each year and he was placed second in 1881, his son Frank being placed first in 1911. Thomas Mercer was appointed as judge for the horological class at the Universal Exhibition held in Paris in 1900. Unfortunately he caught a cold on the ferry crossing to France and died at the H&ocirc;tel Internationale, Paris, on 29 September 1900. He was buried in St Stephen's Church, St Albans. At the time of his death he had been responsible for the manufacture of over 5000 chronometers, sold to the Royal Navy and to the navies of the world. The obituary of Mercer, published in the <span class="italic">British Horological Journal</span> for November 1900, attested:<blockquote>The annexed portrait affords a very fair idea of the man. Straightforward and self-reliant, he was, nevertheless, of retiring and unpretentious disposition, rarely mixing in public gatherings, yet taking an absorbing interest in all that pertained to horology, and especially in any proposal or device connected with improved methods of manufacture. Unswerving honesty was his prominent characteristic; this, coupled with the large amount of sound common sense with which he was endowed, enabled him by plodding industry to attain a position second to none in the trade.</blockquote>
