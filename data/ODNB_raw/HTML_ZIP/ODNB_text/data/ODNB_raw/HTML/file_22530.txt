<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pope <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Younge]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (1739<span class="mult">x</span>45&#150;1797), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born near Old Gravel Lane, Southwark; she may have been the Elizabeth Young baptized at St Olave's, Southwark, on 14 January 1744, the daughter of Samuel and Mary Young. Little is known about her family and background, and what is available seems to be anecdote or conjecture. Her parents probably died when she was young. <span class="italic">The Secret History of the Green Rooms</span> credits her with a good education and reports a broken engagement to a lawyer. She supposedly became a milliner, but about 1767&#150;8 secured through the actor father of a fellow worker an introduction to George Garrick. He was so impressed by her talent as an actress that he took her to his brother, David Garrick. Circumstances were to favour Miss Younge, for during that season Hannah Pritchard retired, and Garrick was also having trouble with the difficult Ann Barry. Garrick had a policy of keeping a good actress in reserve&#151;a &#145;bisque&#146;, as he called them&#151;which he used to balance the demands of his star players. Seeing that she would strengthen the Drury Lane company, Garrick not only employed her but gave her his personal instruction.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Younge's first appearance at Drury Lane was as Imogen in <span class="italic">Cymbeline</span>, on 22 October 1768. The prompter William Hopkins wrote of her d&eacute;but in his diary:<blockquote>Miss Younge&#151;an elegant Figure in both dresses, has a very good voice, but wants management,&#151;a great deal of acting about her, and would make a great figure, if she had a better face. Upon the whole she played the part amazingly well, and had deserved the applause. (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>)</blockquote>Garrick thought well enough of her to raise her salary from &pound;2 to &pound;3 per week. Her next roles were Jane Shore and Ovisa in the premi&egrave;re of Alexander Dow's <span class="italic">Zingis</span>. The play was mocked by audiences and Younge was among the performers hissed. She played Perdita in Garrick's <span class="italic">Florizel and Perdita</span> for her benefit on 7 April 1769, reciting the epilogue entitled <span class="italic">Bucks Have At Ye All</span>. In summer 1769 she worked at Richmond with James Love, but in the autumn returned to Drury Lane and played Juliet in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> (2 October), among many other roles.<br>
<br>Younge began the new season of 1770 at Drury Lane with Imogen in <span class="italic">Cymbeline</span>, followed by Alcmena in <span class="italic">Amphitryon</span>, Lady Easy in <span class="italic">The Careless Husband</span>, and Almera in <span class="italic">The Mourning Bride</span>, but on account of a dispute with Garrick over her salary she moved to Capel Street Theatre in Dublin, where she enjoyed great success in both tragedy and comedy. She spent summer 1771 in Bristol and, after renegotiating her terms with Garrick, went back to Drury Lane to play Imogen again (26 September), which, according to Hopkins, she &#145;played Well &amp; was receiv'd with Great Applause&#146;. Francis Gentleman, writing in <span class="italic">The Theatre</span>, objected to her wearing men's breeches, finding it &#145;rather a breach of female delicacy&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>), though he found her performance spirited, despite her being &#145;in actions stiff&#146;  (ibid.) and &#145;oft dissonant in tone&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>From 1771 to 1778 Younge remained at Drury Lane, where she gained a reputation as a leading actress of both tragedy and comedy. In the summer months she also performed in Bristol, Edinburgh, Birmingham, Liverpool, and Cork, earning as much as &pound;10 per night at Liverpool in 1777. Garrick seems to have had a great respect for her talent, though at times she caused him irritation, particularly over the negotiation of salary and role allocation. On 11 January 1775 she performed Viola before George III, but only following a stern letter from Garrick which cautioned her for trying his patience after she threatened to withdraw from the play, pleading a cough. In October 1775, when Younge, Mary Ann Yates, and Frances Abington were being temperamental, Garrick cast a lesser actress Mary King, in a leading role to play before the king in order to belittle the three. Despite these disputes Garrick seemed to have had a warm affection for Younge. In the green room during his final performance of King Lear, on 8 June 1776, according to one account, they played out a scene from the play, she being Cordelia, during which he affectionately gave her a mock father's blessing.<br>
<br>Younge was the fifth highest paid actress at Drury Lane by the time of Garrick's retirement, earning &pound;12 per week. At her benefit on 30 March 1778 the box-office receipts amounted to &pound;285, which was a considerable sum for the time.<br>
<br>It was again a dispute over salary that caused Younge to move to Covent Garden after the 1778&#150;9 season, despite the fact that Sheridan offered her &pound;20 per week, a free benefit, and a substantial clothing allowance. She remained at Covent Garden until her death. In 1784 she again played Juliet and was satirized poetically in the <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span> for not acting her age.<br>
<br>Younge was as subject to scandalous gossip as other actresses, but she was more discreet than many. A batch of anonymous letters to the poet Edward Jerningham may be hers. If so, they represent an association of some fondness on her part. It was during her summer seasons at Dublin and Cork from 1782 and 1785 that Younge met her husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22528/', "Alexander Pope (1763&#150;1835)")</script>, a young Cork artist and actor. They were married in Dublin on 9 August 1785, causing some comment to arise from the age difference of two decades. After the marriage Mrs Pope returned to Covent Garden but worked only part of the 1785&#150;6 season, probably because she was pregnant. The Popes had one son, who is reputed to have died as a midshipman on the frigate <i>Doris</i> in 1804. Mrs Pope had secured her husband a position at Covent Garden, to which she returned in September 1786, after both of them had played at Norwich and Edinburgh that summer. She was now being paid &pound;20 and her husband &pound;9 per week.<br>
<br>From all accounts Elizabeth Pope was a solid performer, an exemplar of the Garrick style who excelled in characters of sentiment such as Portia in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>. She was not among the greats of tragedy, like Sarah Siddons, or comedy, like Elizabeth Farren, but she had the talent and flexibility to move between the two; comedy, however, was her forte. It was reported that she was not a beauty, though it is suggested she became more attractive with age. A biographer in the <span class="italic">Monthly Mirror</span> (1775) had the following adulatory word portrait of her:<blockquote>Her features, without being regular, were soft, and her natural complexion the most delicate in the world &hellip; eyes blue &hellip; mouth well formed &hellip; teeth white. Her neck, her shoulders, her arms, were models of statuary &hellip; Her height was commanding, yet easily elegant. Such also were her manner and conversation. Her heart spoke of every thing said.</blockquote>George III supposedly admired her resemblance to Lady Sarah Lennox, the object of his affections as a young man.<br>
<br>On 10 January 1797 Mrs Pope created the role of Helen Vortex in Thomas Morton's <span class="italic">A Cure for the Heartache</span>, and this proved to be her last original piece. Seriously ill from the start, she rapidly deteriorated and had to abandon the role by 26 January. She died on Wednesday 15 March 1797, at her home, 5 Half Moon Street. The records at Westminster Abbey give her age at death as fifty-two, but Ralph Wewitzer, in his <span class="italic">Dramatic Reminiscences</span>, wrote that she died aged fifty-seven, which has been echoed by other accounts  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>). During her life, by agreement with her husband, she had retained control over her own property and finances; however, she died intestate, so her considerable estate of &pound;7000 and house went automatically to him. She was buried in the west cloister of Westminster Abbey on 22 March 1797, and her funeral was attended by colleagues from Covent Garden and members of the School of Garrick, the society of Garrick's former colleagues, in which she was the only woman to be given honorary membership.<br>
