<span class="headword">Barber,  (Charles) Chapman</span>  (1801<span class="mult">x</span>4&#150;1882), <span class="occ">barrister</span>, was the first son of Chapman Barber, a solicitor of Chancery Lane, London (<i>d</i>. before 1829). He was educated at a school in Saffron Walden, Essex, before being admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, in 1824, graduating BA in 1833 and MA in 1836. He first entered Lincoln's Inn in May 1824, was recorded as having been readmitted five years later, and was called to the bar on 2 May 1833. He was a pupil of Lewis Duval, an eminent conveyancer. Barber never took silk, but acquired a high reputation as an equity draftsman. For nearly half a century he had an extensive practice at the junior bar, conducting his business from the late 1830s onwards from chambers at 11 New Square, Lincoln's Inn. On 24 September 1845 he married Harriet Frances Bambrick at the chapel of the British embassy in Paris  (<span class="italic">IGI</span>).<br>
<br>In December 1850 Barber was appointed secretary to the commission set up to investigate reform of chancery court procedure, at a salary of &pound;600; he was paid an additional &pound;300 for the preparation of bills arising from the commission's first report of January 1852. His experience of chancery work was clearly invaluable for this role, and in this connection was later published <span class="italic">Mr Barber's Statement on the Practice and Procedure of the Court of Chancery in England</span> (1865). Barber's spell in the limelight, however, came during the affair of the Tichborne claimant, during which he was a junior counsel on the defendants' legal team. At the initial hearing in July 1867, held at the Law Institution, Chancery Lane, it was he who cross-examined the claimant on key points of his story, most notably on the means of his escape from the shipwreck that was supposed to have claimed the life of Sir Roger Tichborne. The general opinion of the common law bar was that Barber, as a chancery barrister, was not best fitted for this task. Sir Henry Hawkins, who went on to lead for the defence, felt that Barber's mild style of questioning had let the claimant off the hook, and made the hindsight-gifted assertion that &#145;had I been instructed I am perfectly sure I could have extinguished the case then and there&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 1.310&#150;11). But historians of the affair have defended Barber, who had never before undertaken a cross-examination, on the grounds that in the preliminary hearing, the aim was only to establish the key points of the claimant's story, and that in any event Hawkins had been on the spot to direct the junior counsel had he felt so inclined. Whatever his shortcomings as an inquisitor, Barber was retained by the defence for the 103-day civil trial in common pleas (<i>Tichborne v. Lushington</i>, 1872), during which his experience in the law of real property and settlement was called upon in connection with the descent of the Tichborne and Doughty estates, and by the crown for the 188-day criminal trial for perjury that followed (April 1873&#150;February 1874). On the conclusion of this, Barber was appointed a county court judge for Hull and the East Riding, but resigned after only a month in the post to resume his practice at the bar.<br>
<br>Barber died on 5 February 1882 at his residence, 71 Cornwall Gardens, South Kensington, London. He was survived by his wife, the sole executor of his estate. At his death he was &#145;the father&#146; of the junior equity bar, and was eulogized as &#145;one of the most skilful and experienced conveyancers of his day&#146;, whose advice and opinion were regularly sought by his junior colleagues  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 Feb 1882).<br>
