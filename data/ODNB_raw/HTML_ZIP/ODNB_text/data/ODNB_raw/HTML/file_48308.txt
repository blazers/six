<span class="headword">Hugh the Chanter</span> <span class="st"> [Hugh the Chantor, Hugh Sottovagina]</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1140), <span class="occ">historian</span>, may have had family origins in Flanders or Picardy, a suggestion supported by the other name by which he was known, Sottovagina (Sottewain in the vernacular), evidently a nickname meaning &#145;foolish (or absurd) scabbard&#146;. It was an unusual name, which Hugh shared with a number of individuals associated with York. Thomas Sottovagina and his brother Ernulf, for instance, both York canons, occurring from the 1120s to the 1150s, may have been Hugh's nephews or sons. Hugh's place and date of birth are, however, unknown. The text of his history of the church of York (which survives in one manuscript copy, in the early fourteenth-century <span class="italic">Magnum registrum album</span> (MS L2/1) of York Minster Library) does not bear his name, but he is identified as its author by the Digby chronicle of the archbishops of York, written soon after 1140. The chronicler acknowledged his own debt to Hugh, whom he described as &#145;an admirable man, worthy of remembrance&#146; and &#145;a man of venerable age and happy urbanity&#146;  (Raine, 2.355).<br>
<br>Hugh's history, covering the period from 1070 to 1127, is an account of the primacy dispute between the churches of York and Canterbury, which centred on the demands by the southern archbishops that those of York make written profession of obedience. The way in which he refers to the cathedral chapter makes it clear that Hugh was a canon from the time of Archbishop Thomas (II; 1109&#150;14), and he may have been collated <i>c</i>.1108. Until 1114 some aspects of Hugh's account are confused and misleading, but from that date, and thus for the main body of the book, Hugh was writing as an eyewitness. He was probably with Archbishop Thurstan (1114&#150;40) in 1119 and 1120, years for which he was able to give details of dates and places of events and meetings. His narrative therefore, although partisan, is generally well informed. At the very end of the work Hugh states its purpose, that posterity might forgive those who professed obedience to Canterbury, and imitate those who maintained York's independence, notably the book's central character, Thurstan. He suggests that the book might have been entitled &#145;The man set free&#146; because it demonstrated how Thurstan brought the church of York back to its ancient freedom. The history shows Hugh to have been a skilful and lively writer. It is his only surviving historical work, but Richard of Hexham quotes two lines from an account by Hugh of the battle of the Standard, which took place near Northallerton on 22 August 1138, and Hugh was also the author of a set of versified moral precepts, dealing with themes such as tyranny and government, wealth and poverty.<br>
<br>The date at which Hugh became archdeacon and precentor is not known. As canon of York he was a frequent witness to charters issued by the archbishop and others, and was attesting <i>acta</i> as precentor by 1133; however he is not likely to have held that office before <i>c</i>.1125. His occurrences as archdeacon are not easy to establish, since there was a slightly earlier archdeacon of York also named Hugh. It is therefore not certain which of these, for instance, accompanied Archbishop Thurstan to St Mary's Abbey, York, in October 1132 when a number of monks seceded to found Fountains Abbey. Hugh's archidiaconal title is either simply &#145;archdeacon&#146; or &#145;archdeacon of the church of York&#146;, but it is probable that the archdeaconry which he held was that of Cleveland. As precentor and archdeacon Hugh issued a charter addressed to Prior Roger and the convent of Durham, which cannot be later than 1137. This survives in its original  (Durham Cath. CL, Charter 2.4 Ebor.6), with Hugh's seal attached. Hugh was still alive in August 1138, at the time of the battle of the Standard, but had been succeeded as precentor by William d'Eu before January 1140. The <span class="italic">Liber vitae</span> of Durham Cathedral priory records the commemoration of an archdeacon Hugh on 4 July. If this was the obit of Hugh the Chanter, then his death occurred on 4 July 1139. However, there exists a poem written by Hugh, monk of Pontefract, which contains strong verbal echoes of the history of Hugh the Chanter. It is therefore possible that Hugh the Chanter and Hugh the monk of Pontefract were one and the same, and that Hugh did not die in office, but retired to Pontefract with Archbishop Thurstan in 1140.<br>
