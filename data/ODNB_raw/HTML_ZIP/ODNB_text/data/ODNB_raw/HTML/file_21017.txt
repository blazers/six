<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Owen,  John</span>  (1766&#150;1822), <span class="occ">missionary society administrator</span>, was son of Richard Owen, a jeweller, of Old Street, London. He entered St Paul's School on 18 October 1777, from where he proceeded in 1784, as Sykes exhibitioner, to Magdalene College, Cambridge (admitted a sizar 10 May). He migrated to Corpus Christi College and was admitted a scholar on the old foundation on 17 November 1784; he graduated BA in 1788, became a fellow on 11 April 1789, and proceeded MA in 1791.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1791 Owen went to the continent, at first as tutor to a young gentleman. In September 1792 he left Geneva for the south of France, and arrived in Lyons to find it in the hands of a revolutionary mob. He with difficulty escaped to Switzerland. Owen published an account of his adventures in <span class="italic">Travels into Different Parts of Europe, in the Years 1791 and 1792</span> (2 vols., 1796). On 1 September 1794 he married Charlotte Green of Cambridge and settled there. On 11 March and 5 August 1794 Owen preached two assize sermons in the university church of St Mary, which were published that year. In 1794 he also published <span class="italic">The retrospect, or, Reflections on the State of Religion and Politics in France and Great Britain</span>. He was ordained on 21 June 1795 and was made curate of Fulham by Beilby Porteus, bishop of London, who also made him rector of Paglesham, Essex, in 1808. Owen held the curacy until 1813, being made minister of Park Chapel, Chelsea, in 1815.<br>
<br>Owen published in 1804, writing as Theophilus Christian, esq., <span class="italic">The Fashionable World Displayed</span>, which went through several editions. In that year began his connection with the British and Foreign Bible Society, his chief claim to fame. From 23 April 1804&#151;a few weeks after its foundation&#151;until his death he was its principal secretary, although unpaid. He was successful in persuading Bishop Porteus to allow an association between the society and the Church of England: a link vital to the society's success. At the request of some of its members Owen wrote <span class="italic">The History of the Origin and First Ten Years of the British and Foreign Bible Society</span> (2 vols., 1816), still a valuable work.<br>
<br>After an illness in 1817, Owen went abroad in August 1818. He helped to establish a branch <span class="roman">Bible</span> society in Paris, and inspected the progress of the <span class="roman">Turkish New Testament</span>, then in course of preparation for the society by Professor Kieffer. He visited Pastor Oberlin and the branches established at Z&uuml;rich, St Gallen, Constance, and other Swiss towns. He returned to England in December and published <span class="italic">Brief Extracts from Letters on the Object and Connexions of the British and Foreign Bible Society</span> (1819) and worked on the third volume of his history, published in 1820. He also wrote <span class="italic">Two Letters on the Subject of the French Bible</span> (1822). This was in reply to a charge of Socinianism brought against that translation and symptomatic of more general criticisms of the society's translations.<br>
<br>Owen had a reputation for being prickly and short-tempered. He died at Ramsgate on 26 September 1822, and was buried at Fulham. His wife and several children survived him. One of his daughters married the eldest son of William Wilberforce.<br>
