<span class="headword">Langton, Lady  Anna Eliza Mary  Gore-</span>  (1820&#150;1879), <span class="occ">campaigner for women's rights</span>, was born in February 1820, the only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11497/', "Richard Plantagenet Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, second duke of Buckingham and Chandos (1797&#150;1861)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Mary Campbell (1795&#150;1862), daughter of John, first marquess of Breadalbane. Her father dissipated his inheritance after succeeding to the dukedom in 1839. He left England a ruined man in 1847, and the contents of Stowe, the family seat, were sold in 1848. Her parents were divorced in 1850. Nothing is known of Lady Anna's formal education, though her home life presumably gave her instruction in the realities of politics; her father had been the proposer of the Chandos clause to the 1832 <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, by which the vote in counties was conferred on &pound;50 tenants.<br>
<br>On 9 June 1846, at St George's, Hanover Square, London, Lady Anna married William Henry Powell Gore-Langton (1824&#150;1873). They had three sons and two daughters. The family's country home was Newton Park, Newton St Loe, near Bath. Her husband was a Conservative member of parliament for Somerset, but was sufficiently radical to support John Stuart Mill's attempt to include women in the <span class="roman">Representation of the People Bill</span> in 1867. Lady Anna had signed the petition in favour of women's suffrage that Mill presented to parliament in 1866. From 1872 she was president of the Bath committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage, and in 1874 she became president of the Bristol and west of England branch. In April 1873 she was a speaker at a public meeting organized by the central committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage at the Hanover Square Rooms, London. Helen Blackburn wrote of Lady Anna that &#145;Her speaking was thoroughly practical, and carried with it great earnestness and conviction&#151;perhaps it was all the more convincing because it was quiet and unassuming. Her fine presence and noble face lent great dignity to all she said&#146;  (Blackburn, 113&#150;14). In June 1877 Lady Anna was a member of a deputation to the chancellor of the exchequer, seeking his support for a bill in favour of women's suffrage that Jacob Bright was to present the next day. After this bill's disastrous defeat Lady Anna took the lead in organizing a meeting of suffrage workers at her London house in order to review the position. She was presumably riled by the suggestion, in the course of the parliamentary debate, that supporters of women's education (particularly supporters of Girton College) were not friends to women's suffrage. Lady Anna was decidedly a supporter of both; she was to leave &pound;1000 to Girton in her will.<br>
<br>Lady Anna Gore-Langton was involved with several other feminist enterprises, being a director of the Women's Printing Society; a member, from 1871, of the general committee for securing a medical education to women in Edinburgh; and, by 1878, a vice-president of the London School of Medicine for Women. At a public meeting held in London on 25 June 1877 she had described how, from her own knowledge, women in English villages failed to seek medical attention because it could be had only from men; for the same reason, she thought women medical practitioners much needed in India. She was a vice-president of the National Indian Association, particularly interested in the welfare and education of women in India. She accompanied her brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11498/', "Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, third duke of Buckingham and Chandos")</script>, when he was appointed governor of Madras in 1875 and spent much of the remainder of her life in India. During one of her return visits to England she gave lectures on &#145;The Social Conditions of Indian Women&#146;; initiated, with Mary Carpenter, a scheme to train and send out women teachers to India; and assisted in raising scholarships for women in Indian universities.<br>
<br>Lady Anna Gore-Langton died of cerebral apoplexy at her London home, Langton House, George Street, Hanover Square, on 3 February 1879, shortly after returning from India.<br>
