<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Colet,  John</span>  (1467&#150;1519), <span class="occ">dean of St Paul's and founder of St Paul's School</span>, was born in January 1467, as attested by a contemporary document; Erasmus, always vague as to chronology, believed him to have been about thirty, two or three months younger than himself, when they first met in 1499. Colet's birthplace was almost certainly the London residence of his father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5897/', "Sir Henry Colet (c.1430&#150;1505)")</script>, Mercer and twice mayor of London, and mother, Christian Knyvet (<i>d</i>. 1523), in the parish of St Antholin, Watling Street. Both parents were from well-to-do stock, Henry Colet's relations being connected with the Mercers' Company and he a younger son of Robert Colet of The Hale, Wendover, Buckinghamshire; his wife was the eldest daughter of John Knyvet of Homerton, Huntingdonshire, and Buckenham Castle, Norfolk, and Alice (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Lynn), of a London merchant family. Henry Colet and Christian Knyvet married about 1465&#150;6, he to become wealthy and she to bear at least twenty children. Only John survived past 1503, when a brother, Richard, of Lincoln's Inn, was living; another brother, Thomas, died in infancy in 1479. According to Erasmus John was the eldest son and sole survivor of eleven sons and eleven daughters; he is followed by Polydore Vergil of Urbino, who arrived in England in 1502, and George Lily, son of the first high master of Colet's St Paul's School, William Lily. John Stow's <span class="italic">Survey of London</span> (1598) records a stained-glass window in the former church of St Antholin, Watling Street, showing Sir Henry and Dame Christian with ten sons and ten daughters.<br>
<br>Colet was survived by his mother by some four years; in her will, dated 13 January 1523 and proved on 2 November, she asks to be buried near her husband in St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney. In letters of 1512 and 1516 Colet tells Erasmus that she is spending a healthy and contented old age in the country&#151;that is, in Sir Henry's house, Great Place, Stepney, which passed to the Mercers at her death&#151;and that she speaks often with pleasure of Erasmus; Erasmus wrote admiringly of her in 1521 and in 1532 recommended her stoical example to Bonifacius Amerbach. In 1510 the German theologian, physician, and magus Henricus Cornelius Agrippa was her guest, no doubt in connection with a visit to her son. On 1 December of that year Dame Christian was granted letters of fraternity by Christ Church, Canterbury. Co-executor of her husband and of her sons Richard and John, she was left well provided for and presented the Mercers with two silver-gilt standing cups and covers.<h2>
<a name="Educationandchurchpreferments"></a>Education and church preferments</h2>Colet was taught the rudiments of Christian belief, good conduct, and Latin either at the school of St Antholin's Hospital in Threadneedle Street or the hospital school of St Thomas of Acon. His holy and religious nature, according to Polydore Vergil, impelled him towards divine studies, with St Paul as his preceptor, at both Oxford and Cambridge. The Oxford registers of congregation for 1464&#150;1504 being lost, Anthony Wood's assertion in 1691&#150;2 that Colet was a student at Magdalen College, Oxford, graduated BTh in 1501, and was incorporated DTh in 1504 lacks confirmation; the doctorate is mentioned in a letter from Erasmus; and at his election as dean he was styled &#145;sacre theologie professor&#146;, that is DTh. A John Colet is recorded at Cambridge University as questionist in Lent term 1485, when he would normally have spent four years in study, and in Lent term 1489 incepting as MA. Given family connections and holdings in the east midlands and Sir Henry's name among those few appealed to by the university in 1503&#150;4 for funds to rebuild Great St Mary's, these entries almost certainly relate to his eldest son. At Cambridge Colet would have completed his necessary regency in 1490; later, he glossed the word <i>philopompi</i> (&#145;lovers of display&#146;) as <i>Cantabrigienses</i> (&#145;Cambridge men&#146;).<br>
<br>Before being ordained deacon on 17 December 1497 and priest on 25 March 1498 Colet had been admitted on 6 August 1485 to the rectorship of Dennington in Suffolk (which was in the gift of his mother's family and which he held until his death) and of the free chapel of Hilberworth, Norfolk, in 1486. Rector of Thurning, Huntingdonshire, a living in his father's gift, from 1490 to 1494 and canon of York and prebendary of Botevant from 1496 to 1519, he was also canon of St Martin's-le-Grand and prebendary of Goodeaster by 1497 until 1504. He held the living of Stepney&#151;in the 1530s the richest in England&#151;from 1499 to 1505, was canon of Salisbury and prebendary of Durnford from 1502 to 1519, rector of Lambourn, Berkshire, in 1505, and treasurer of Chichester, Sussex, from after 1508 to 1519. In a letter usually dated December 1504 but perhaps of mid-1505 Erasmus congratulates him on his deanship of St Paul's. Collated prebendary of Mora on 5 May 1505 and elected dean at the instance of the king on 2 June, he held both deanship and prebend until his death.<h2>
<a name="Europeantravel"></a>European travel</h2>Colet passed an indeterminate portion of the 1490s in France and Italy, visiting France first according to Erasmus. Though he is not mentioned in the extant university records of either Orl&eacute;ans or Paris, he spent time in both cities. Towards the end of 1516 the jurist Fran&ccedil;ois Deloynes wrote to Erasmus that he had been impressed with Colet's learning and holiness when they studied together at Orl&eacute;ans. In Paris Colet may have frequented the circle of conservative theologians with an interest in the Florentine Neoplatonist philosopher Marsilio Ficino; he did not then meet Erasmus, however, who arrived in the city in the late summer of 1495.<br>
<br>Encouragement for a European journey must have come from the example of William Grocyn, Thomas Linacre, and William Lily, Grocyn's godson, who had improved their Latin and Greek in Italy and elsewhere, but precise dates for Colet's departure and return are lacking. By September 1492 he was in Rome, quartered in the English Hospice; on 13 March 1493 he inscribed himself, his parents, and his brother Richard in the Fraternitas Sancti Spiritus et Sanctae Mariae de Urbe, giving all four a share in the spiritual benefits of the fraternity's charitable works; and on 3 May was enrolled as <i>confrater</i> of the English Hospice also. He may not have stayed in the city beyond that year. In Rome he was in contact with Christopher Urswick who, leaving in the late summer or early autumn of 1492, asked Colet to secure for him a manuscript of the <span class="italic">Historia Bohemica</span> of Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini (Pius II); Colet sent him a printed edition, with an apologetic letter, dated from Rome 1 April 1493. Urswick's annotations show an interest in the Hussite movement; Erasmus's report that Colet valued the stimulus of heretical writings suggests that he read Pius's book before passing it on, though his letter is merely complimentary to Urswick and to history, in stock humanist mode. It is likely that Colet followed Grocyn's, Linacre's and Lily's example in spending time in Florence. There were intellectual attractions for him in the city, Ficino was at Careggi nearby, and the distance along the land route to and from Rome was not great.<h2>
<a name="OxfordandErasmus"></a>Oxford and Erasmus</h2>The date of Colet's return to England is unknown: probably some time in or after 1495, and more certainly to Oxford, where he remained continuously until 1504 or 1505. Thereafter his only documented Oxford contacts are two dinners at Exeter College in 1516. From Oxford he had written to Erasmus, greeting him on his first arrival in England during late summer or autumn 1499; in Oxford that year they debated at least twice. When they met in 1499 (according to Erasmus in 1521), Colet had been giving successful free public lectures on the Pauline epistles in Oxford for some years. Polydore Vergil says that he lectured on St Paul in London. How far the manuscripts of one commentary on <span class="roman">1 Corinthians</span> and two on <span class="roman">Romans</span> by Colet that survive preserve the text or even the substance of the lectures is unclear. The most satisfactory witness to Colet's approach to St Paul in the 1490s may be his letter of 1498&#150;9 to Richard Kidderminster, abbot of Winchcombe, containing a series of precepts extracted from <span class="roman">Romans</span> 1.<br>
<br>Of letters between Colet and Erasmus some twenty-three survive; seven&#151;dating from 1499 to 1517&#151;are from Colet. In a letter to Johannes Sixtinus of November 1499 Erasmus gives an animated account of Colet's heated after-dinner disquisition on the sacrifices of Cain and Abel (<span class="roman">Genesis</span> 4), putting his unmediated Pauline view that Abel's offering had been more acceptable &#145;by faith&#146; (<span class="roman">Hebrews</span> 11: 4). His reaction to Erasmus's attempt to lower the temperature with a facetious <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> fable is not recorded. Two letters to Colet of 1499, which Erasmus worked up and published (<span class="italic">Lucubratiunculae</span>, 1503), give access to an earlier debate in the Augustinian College of St Mary, Oxford, on the agony in the Garden. Erasmus's arguments from reason and authority that Christ's human nature was expressed in his plea that the cup should pass from him were met by Colet's contention that this implied derogation of Christ's divinity; rather, he was prescient of Jewish guilt.<br>
<br>At the end of the letters in 1503 Erasmus alludes to Pauline questions too delicate for public discussion, which might be aired on their walks together. That he does this in Greek is probably an adroit enhancement of his complimentary reference a few lines before to learning in both ancient languages acquired in Italy by Colet, who never, in fact, had more than a few words of Greek, as he acknowledged regretfully to Erasmus in 1516. The same year Erasmus reports Colet so conscious of his handicap that, stimulated by Erasmus's publication of the Greek <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in his <span class="italic">Novum instrumentum</span>, he was working at it with John Clement, Thomas More's pupil&#150;servant and alumnus of St Paul's School. In 1519 an anonymous contemporary stated that Colet knew no Greek.<br>
<br>In the letter sent with his <span class="italic">Lucubratiunculae</span> from Paris (1504?&#150;5) Erasmus is delighted at Colet's doctorate and deanship, expresses surprise that Colet's Pauline and gospel commentaries have not been printed, enquires about money for copies of his own <span class="italic">Adagia</span>, and asks for help. His London stay (late 1505 &#150; early June 1506) followed the death of Sir Henry Colet on 1 October 1505, which had made his son rich; in his father's memory, a little later, Colet commissioned from the Brabantine scribe Pieter Meghen imposing codices with Ghent&#150;Bruges illustrations of the <span class="roman">Vulgate</span> epistles and gospels (BL, Royal MS 1 E.v; CUL, MS Dd.7.3).<h2>
<a name="DeanofStPauls"></a>Dean of St Paul's</h2>Royal favour had secured Colet's translation from the academy to the important deanship of St Paul's. The prominence he achieved before being possibly robbed of a bishopric by death resulted partly from zealous performance of ecclesiastical duty, including his preaching and his insistence that his chapter mend their ways, partly from his refoundation of St Paul's School, and partly from his involvement in affairs of state. In London he continued his association with the Christian humanist circle to which Erasmus became a constant mentor, whether by intermittent physical presence or <i>in absentia</i>. Thomas More, Erasmus's host during his third visit, was also a leading constituent of a group that included Grocyn, Lily, Linacre, Cuthbert Tunstall, William Latimer, Richard Fox, Urswick, John Clerk, Thomas Lupset, and Richard Pace, Colet's successor as dean of St Paul's, Latin secretary to Henry VIII, and diplomat, who in 1517 dedicated to Colet <span class="italic">De fructu qui ex doctrina percipitur</span>, addressed to the pupils of St Paul's School. Most of these, together with John Yonge and the Italians Polydore Vergil and Andreas Ammonius, belonged to Doctors' Commons, the loose association of civilians and clergy concerned with matters in the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts. Colet was probably admitted in 1505. His closest English friend was More, his junior by ten years, to whom he was &#145;vitae meae magister&#146; (&#145;my life's overseer&#146;) and who, thinking him more learned and holy than anyone in England for centuries past, praised the bishop of Lincoln as a second Colet. Colet in turn thought More &#145;Britanniae unicum ingenium&#146; (&#145;the ablest man in Britain&#146;), though he was out of sympathy with <span class="italic">Utopia</span>.<br>
<br>Of Colet's early activities as dean there are a few minor traces, some autograph, among papers from St Paul's (London, Guildhall Library, MSS 25121/1804, 25187); they include his visitation, using thirteen horses, of cathedral properties outside London in May and July 1506; new furniture and a cross; and armorial glass for his summer parlour at Stepney. More importantly, he framed statutes for the chapter, accepted by them after 20 June 1506 (a fair copy made by Meghen is lost), and exhibited to Wolsey in 1518. Conventional in their nature, they do not in themselves justify reports of the chapter's resentment, which is more likely to have resulted from Colet's authoritarian and high-minded expectations. On 28 April 1507 he added statutes for the Guild of Jesus associated with the cathedral. In 1510&#150;11 the dean of St Paul's may have been involved in the campaign against Lollards of the bishop of London, Richard Fitzjames, on whose behalf he acted in other ecclesiastical matters, including censorship. He certainly took part in the drives of William Warham, archbishop of Canterbury, in 1511&#150;12, being one of the formidable bench of examiners in two Kentish cases (8&#150;19 May, 8 May &#150; 3 October 1511).<br>
<br>To Colet's seriousness and dramatic power as a preacher both Erasmus, comparing his name to Coheleth, and More bear witness. The substance of many sermons given in Oxford and in London must be represented in his Latin commentaries on St Paul and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite; he also preached, according to Erasmus, on the creed and Pater noster as well as the gospels. That some of his homilies were in English is implied in Erasmus's statement that Colet had studied the English poets to prepare for preaching the gospel. From 1510 to 1517, with perhaps an interval in 1514, Colet regularly received 20<i>s</i>. for the Good Friday sermon at court, although evidence of his preaching does not survive in quantity; his homily to the first assembly since 1504 of the convocation of Canterbury is the only one of which the text is extant. For the others, there remain only brief summaries, by Erasmus and an unknown reporter. Colet's surviving sermon was delivered in Latin on 6 February; internal evidence suggests the year was 1510, though the version printed in London by Richard Pynson gives 1511 and the printing has been assigned to probably 1512. The sermon has been an important element in Colet's later reputation as a precursor of the Reformation; an anonymous English translation, perhaps made in the Reformation interest, was printed in London by Thomas Berthelet probably in 1530&#150;31. Taking as its text <span class="roman">Romans</span> 12: 2&#151;&#145;Be ye not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed in the renewing of your mind&#146;&#151;the sermon was a strongly worded example of the critical and hortatory discourse usual on such occasions, without doctrinal emphasis but pressing on the clergy the need for an absolute purity of life and a restraint in temporal matters such as would justify the church in its claims to liberty from state interference and obedience from the people at large.<br>
<br>Erasmus's account of sermons for which he is the sole witness as to content places Colet's candour in a context of difficulties, triumphantly resolved in his favour, first with the episcopate and then with Henry VIII. According to Erasmus, Colet had quoted in a sermon the Ciceronian maxim that an unjust peace was preferable to the most just of wars, at the very time that war with France was imminent. His clerical enemies attempted to make capital of this, and Colet was summoned to an interview with the king, who promised him protection. Then in a Good Friday sermon, which Erasmus briefly summarizes, Colet compounded his offence by declaring that war and Christianity could not accord. At this his enemies renewed their efforts and he was again summoned by the king, who required the easing of his conscience as to certain scruples and an undertaking from Colet to preach again in a way that would not sow doubt in the minds of the rough soldiery. That conversation over, Henry publicly embraced and commended Colet, so that his opponents, whose attempts to bring Colet down had included delation to Archbishop Warham for heresy, were discomfited. A laconic reference by Colet to Erasmus of October 1514 to unspecified problems with his bishop, Fitzjames, may refer to this situation. It is clear in any case, despite any distortion due to the vague chronology, antipathy to worldly and conventional ecclesiastics, and a generally admiring tone in Erasmus's narrative, that the Pauline Christianity of Colet's preaching had aroused resentment among his fellow clergy.<br>
<br>In the same brief letter of October 1514 in which he complains of his bishop's harassment, Colet tells Erasmus of Thomas Wolsey's translation to the archbishopric of York. Just over a year later he was chosen to preach, in Westminster Abbey on 18 November 1515, in honour of Wolsey's elevation to the cardinalate. The sermon survives only in notes taken by a listener, from which it appears to have begun with Wolsey's praises before passing to a discourse on the secular authority and nobility of the cardinalate, and dilating upon its spiritual significance and its correspondence in the ecclesiastical hierarchy to the burning red seraphim in the celestial.<h2>
<a name="StPaulsSchool"></a>St Paul's School</h2>The first surviving indications of Colet's intention to apply his patrimony to education by the reconstitution of St Paul's Cathedral school in new premises, reflecting a preoccupation with education as prerequisite for spiritual regeneration, belong to 1508. Precedents for his preference for laymen as trustees had existed for more than a century. According to Erasmus he believed reputable married men to be least corrupt; he may also have thought them more trustworthy than the chapter and more businesslike than churchmen in general, as well as less vulnerable in the clutching times that were already threatening the church. In his selection of the Mercers, there may also be a hint at preservation of his father's memory. Admitted a freeman of the company without payment in 1508, in April 1510 he opened and concluded negotiations with them for the school's endowment, and on 27 June obtained the chapter's consent to the school's ordinances. In March 1511 the site at the east end of the churchyard was formally transferred to the Mercers, with whom Colet was in constant consultation; on 17 June 1512 he &#145;shewed forth and read&#146; the school statutes to their court of assistants, petitioning the pope in the same year for a bull to confirm the statutes and annul the power over schools of the chancellor of St Paul's. The statutes describe the school buildings as finished in 1512; it is doubtful whether any extant manuscript of them dates from before 1517&#150;18; that inscribed by Tunstall or another as having been deposited in the hands of the high master on 18 June 1518 gives both 1512 and 1517 as completion date.<br>
<br>On 4 November 1511 Colet had devised property, in what was perhaps a draft will intended for the court of husting in the city of London, to the Mercers for the school's benefit. A longer and fuller will for that court, dated 10 June 1514, may be connected with the intention announced by Colet to retire from active life. In that year he built himself a <i>nidus</i> (nest)&#151;Erasmus calls it a very splendid house&#151;in the precincts of the Charterhouse at Sheen; his will of 1519 requires that all &#145;boardwork&#146; and &#145;painted images upon the walls&#146; remain there.<br>
<br>Dedicating his school to the Virgin and the Christ Child, Colet retained power over the appointment of its teachers. Lily was high master by 27 July 1510, when he was granted a stall in the cathedral choir; though he was a good Graecist, it is uncertain how much Greek was taught before 1516. No record of John Ritwise, Lily's son-in-law and first surmaster (second master), is extant from before 18 December 1517, when Colet petitioned Wolsey on his behalf; a chaplain was envisaged by 1513 and a chantry established in 1514. Colet's intention, avowed in his statutes, &#145;specially to incresse knowledge, and worshipping of god and oure lorde Christ Jesu, and good Cristen lyff and maners in the Children&#146; is clear in his close definition of the required moral, intellectual, and physical conditions for pupils and teachers. Acceptance of Erasmian humanist ideas about the need for Greek and of how Latin should be taught, with brief lip-service to pagan Latin, are overwhelmed by a rigidly literal and passionately expressed insistence on Christian morality. The authors prescribed are the fathers of the church and other early Christian writers (with two late ones, Baptista Mantuanus and Erasmus himself), pure in doctrine as in expression, to the utter exclusion of the language of scholasticism, &#145;adulterate, of the later blind world &hellip; rather &hellip; blotterature than literature&#146;. In this, boys &#145;of all nations and countries indifferently&#146; to the number of 153, large by contemporary standards and referring to the miraculous draft of fishes, were to be instructed without fee. The masters, who might be (married) laymen or in orders (but without benefice), were allotted good salaries and perquisites. Knowledge of reading and writing, and of the catechism, qualified for entry; the creed, in Erasmus's Latin verse (<span class="italic">Institutum Christiani hominis</span>), was required reading, along with Colet's own Latin accidence in English adapted to young needs, preceded by prayers and precepts for living (<span class="italic">Aeditio</span>, 1509?; first extant edition 1527). Colet probably commissioned from Lily <span class="italic">Rudimenta</span>, a Latin syntax in English, later frequently reprinted with the <span class="italic">Aeditio</span>, and certainly <span class="italic">De constructione</span>, a more advanced syntax in Latin. Erasmus, on request, revised this so thoroughly that neither man would thereafter acknowledge it as his: it was first printed as an anonymous work in 1513. Though Colet's conservative curriculum seems later to have been abandoned in practice, the method of Latin teaching used at St Paul's was influential, and modifications of the grammatical works for the school enjoyed a long life as the <span class="roman">Paul's</span>, <span class="roman">Royal</span>, and <span class="roman">Eton</span> grammars. Erasmus, less inflexible than Colet in attitude to classical learning, though refusing to teach in the school, defended it against criticism, helped with appointments, and advised on how to deal with Linacre, whose Latin grammar Colet had rejected as too advanced for his purposes. He also wrote for it <span class="italic">Concio de puero Jesu</span>, and suggested an inscription for the schoolroom. His <span class="italic">De copia</span> (1512), aimed at improving rhetorical fluency and dialectical invention and hugely influential throughout Europe, was prescribed for the school by Colet, to whom it had been dedicated; <span class="italic">De ratione studii</span> (1512), a blueprint for Christian humanist aims and methods in education, has special reference to St Paul's.<br>
<br>The original stone schoolhouse at the east end of old St Paul's, rebuilt on the same site in 1670, after the great fire, was again replaced in 1822. In 1884 the school moved to Hammersmith, where a new and larger building had been erected for it, and in 1968 to new premises across the Thames in Barnes.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>The selection of Colet to preach on 18 November 1515 at Wolsey's receipt of the red hat makes clear his alliance with the rising power of the new cardinal. This is confirmed by his appointment by convocation in December that year to the five-man committee that was to inquire into the dispute about ecclesiastical revenues that led to Warham's being forced out of the chancellorship of England and replaced by Wolsey. To the cardinal's favour he must have owed his place in the king's council. His entry date is not documented and he was never one of the small number that constituted its core, though on 18 June 1517 he was made a member of its committee to hear poor men's causes, an appointment renewed on 18 June 1518. His attendance is recorded at three at least of a minimum of eight meetings between 25 June and 6 November 1518.<br>
<br>In 1517 Colet's health had begun to deteriorate; he suffered the first of three attacks of the sweating sickness which, weakening him and exacerbating a liver condition revealed by his autopsy, led to his death on 16 September 1519. His last will, dated 22 August 1519 and proved in the prerogative court of Canterbury on 5 October, required that he be buried in St Paul's Cathedral near the image of St Wilgefortis, where he had made &#145;a little monument&#146;. Erasmus writes of an unassuming grave identified by the letters &#145;Joan. Col.&#146;. In 1548 George Lily recorded the existence of a more elaborate tomb and the Latin verses by his father hung up beside it (there was also a prose epitaph); and in 1575&#150;6 the Mercers laid out a large sum for marble for it. A coloured miniature attributed to Sir William Segar and thought to be of 1585&#150;6, on the cover of the Mercers' Hall copy of the school statutes, shows a <i>transi</i> tomb, with a bust of Colet; there is an engraving in William Dugdale's <span class="italic">History of St Paul's Cathedral</span> (1658). Refurbished in 1618, the tomb survived the great fire and in 1667&#150;8 was taken down and laid, with the effigy, in Convocation House Yard. In 1680 what was believed to be Colet's coffin was found and investigated by members of the Royal Society.<h2>
<a name="Portraitsandpersonality"></a>Portraits and personality</h2>Colet was a grave and impressive presence, tall and handsome. Several representations survive. The kneeling, tonsured figures in the miniatures at the opening of Colet's <span class="roman">New Testament</span> manuscripts (1506&#150;9) are conventional representations of a cleric. Two closely contemporary portraits only have a claim to authenticity. Of one, attributed to Pietro Torrigiano and probably made from a death mask about 1520, there is a plaster version of uncertain date in Mercers' Hall. The portrait drawing made before 1535 by Hans Holbein the younger during his second visit to England is most likely based on this image. An engraving by Willem or Magdalena van de Passe is in Henry Holland's <span class="italic">Her&#333;ologia Anglica</span> (1620); there are eighteenth-century portrait engravings by George Vertue and Francesco Bartolozzi. Colet invariably wears clerical robe and bonnet; Segar's miniature of the tomb shows him pen and book in hand. The head of the full-length statue by Sir Hamo Thornycroft (1901) in the grounds of St Paul's School is of the Torrigiano&#150;Holbein type.<br>
<br>Erasmus saw in Colet a quick-tempered but pure Christian with a fertile, powerful, profoundly serious mind, always bent on seeking the moral. As aids to self-control he used prayer and fasting; as guides to goodness of life scripture, especially St Paul, the early fathers and the Pseudo-Dionysius. His views, impatiently expressed, were individual, definite, and strongly held. Benevolent towards children, he loved chastity (by his own testimony he deprecated marriage); and he delighted in sacred reading and holy conversation, particularly with friends, with whom he would relax his severity. Sometimes tight-fisted with money and needing reminders of a patron's duty, intolerant both of undue pomp and of slovenliness, he did not follow certain English habits, dressing habitually in plain black woollen, being frugal with food and drink, and not celebrating mass daily. Mistrusting religious and collegiate institutions, conventional piety, and over-scrupulosity in confession, he was intolerant of pilgrimage and particularly of the cult of images and relics as vulgarly practised&#151;as is recollected by Erasmus in <span class="italic">Modus orandi Deum</span> (1524), where Colet is named, and taken up more fully in &#145;Peregrinatio religionis ergo&#146; (&#145;A pilgrimage for religion's sake&#146;), which records their experiences and reactions at Canterbury about 1512&#150;14  (<span class="italic">Colloquies</span>, 1526). There Colet is thinly disguised as Gratianus Pullus (&#145;Gratiane colte&#146; in the English version printed in probably 1540). In &#145;Pia confabulatio&#146; (1522) Colet's trust in faith and prayer is commemorated.<br>
<br>Erasmus, paying Colet's eloquence the stock humanist compliment of comparison with Plato's, also recounts how Colet was taken in by the feigned arguments against rhetoric of <span class="italic">Antibarbari</span>. Colet also amused him by reporting that a bishop had denounced St Paul's School as idolatrous because poets were part of its curriculum, and by passing on another English cleric's foolish Latin etymology. Erasmus, judging Colet's written Latin to be fluent rather than pedantically correct, surmises that he failed to publish for this reason; he remarks also that Colet had not been entirely persuaded to adopt the &#145;new&#146; humanist mode in speaking that language and retained his childhood habit of pronouncing <i>ie</i> as <i>ii</i>  (<span class="italic">De pronuntiatione</span>).<h2>
<a name="Learningandlibrary"></a>Learning and library</h2>What Colet read is more easily characterized than precisely when, where, and in what form, manuscript or print, he read it, let alone when he used it. Besides his own works, his will mentions a manuscript <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and St Jerome.<br>
<br>Among his English contemporaries Colet was unique in his firsthand knowledge and use of Florentine Neoplatonism, with its combination of esoteric philosophy and Christian piety; he was also familiar with the work of some of those who had felt its impact. His heavily annotated copy of Marsilio Ficino's <span class="italic">Epistolae</span>, in the edition of Venice, 11 March 1495, is now in All Souls College, Oxford; he must at least have had in his hands a copy of Ficino's <span class="italic">Theologia platonica</span> (1482), from which he quotes; and he probably knew Ficino's translations of Plato (a copy of the edition of 1491 was in England then), Plotinus, and the <span class="italic">Corpus hermeticum</span>. Colet also read and used such writings by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola as the <span class="italic">Heptaplus</span> (printed 1490?), <span class="italic">Apologia</span> (printed 1482), and <span class="italic">Oratio</span>, as well as perhaps <span class="italic">Adversus astrologiam divinatricem</span>, all included in Pico's <span class="italic">Opera omnia</span> of 1496 and 1498. It was probably from Pico that he derived his interest in the Hebrew cabbala, which was strengthened by his reading of Johann Reuchlin's <span class="italic">De verbo mirifico</span> (1494); and that interest was augmented by Cornelius Agrippa, with whom in 1510 he toiled over St Paul and who made acknowledgement to Colet's teaching. In a letter of 1517 to Erasmus, who the year before had assured Reuchlin of Colet's good opinion of him, however, Colet professed to prefer the &#145;love and imitation of Christ&#146; to Reuchlin's recent speculations in his <span class="italic">De arte cabbalistica</span>. The meditations, commentaries, and denunciatory preaching of Girolamo Savonarola (1452&#150;1498), which might have been expected to appeal to Colet, have left no explicit trace in his extant works; nor have other Savonarolan writings circulating in the England of his time. He may have known Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite in Ficino's Latin versions (1496) and certainly used Ambrogio Traversari's (1436), in the second edition of Pseudo-Dionysius's <span class="italic">Works</span> overseen by Jacques Lef&egrave;vre d'&Eacute;taples (Paris, 1499), for his responses to the <span class="italic">Celestial</span> and <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical Hierarchies</span>. Like Lef&egrave;vre, he remained unmoved by Erasmus's publication in 1505 of Lorenzo Valla's treatise showing that their author was not the convert of St Paul (<span class="roman">Acts</span> 17: 34; the belief that he invited Grocyn to lecture on Pseudo-Dionysius at St Paul's is erroneous). He cites the fifteenth-century Christian Virgil, Baptista Mantuanus; and uses the etymologies in Nicol&ograve; Perotti's standard <span class="italic">Cornucopiae</span>.<br>
<br>Other modern works included Erasmus's <span class="italic">Novum instrumentum</span> of 1516; he interested himself in progress towards <span class="italic">Novum Testamentum</span>, its second edition (1519), and joined in opposition to Edward Lee's strictures. Among Colet's books would also have been Erasmus's <span class="italic">Lucubratiunculae</span> (1503), which included the <span class="italic">Enchiridion militis Christiani</span> whose &#145;philosophia Christi&#146; so chimed with his own; <span class="italic">Copia</span> (1512), dedicated to him, and other educational works; <span class="italic">The Praise of Folly</span> (1511); <span class="italic">Institutio principis Christiani</span> (1516); and the commentary on <span class="roman">Romans</span> (1517), of which he was critical. He would also have had a copy of Pace's <span class="italic">De fructu</span> (1517). In the British Library are two transcripts by Meghen, perhaps for Colet: an incomplete, undated glossed psalter and Lef&egrave;vre's translation of the Pauline epistles, printed in 1512 (BL, Royal MSS 1 E.iii, 1 D.xi&#150;xv).<br>
<br>In Colet's library would have figured the early Christian writers he read, according to Erasmus, while he was in Europe. St Augustine, to whom Erasmus reports Colet as <i>iniquior</i> (&#145;more prejudiced&#146;, probably in favour), is most often cited and has left other traces. Colet himself refers to St Jerome; St John Chrysostom; St Ignatius of Antioch; Lactantius, the Christian Cicero (also commended to St Paul's School); and Polycarp of Smyrna. He quotes the Pseudo-Clementine <span class="italic">Recognitions</span> and Origen (whom he seems to have known both directly and indirectly), and cites Philo Judaeus and Pseudo-Aristeas (probably indirectly). Erasmus adds St Ambrose and More's favourite St Cyprian; he arranged to have his edition of Jerome sent to Colet on 2 October 1516.<br>
<br>Among the transmitters of the pagan wisdom so suspect to Colet as a means to scriptural exegesis, he refers to Cicero (whom he devoured, according to Erasmus), Ovid, Suetonius (whose life of Claudius he invokes in connection with <span class="roman">Romans</span> 13), Terence, Varro, and Virgil. Of late antique writers he knew Macrobius; and of medieval, Thomas Aquinas's <span class="italic">Summa theologica</span> and <span class="italic">Catena aurea</span>; St Anselm (perhaps indirectly); Durandus; Gratian; Pseudo-Ivo of Chartres; and Leo I (the Great), whom he cites explicitly in relation to the extra-scriptural verities entrusted to the church by the Holy Spirit. Though his own theology was biblical and Neoplatonic, he had received and retained a training in scholasticism discernible in his preference, reported by Erasmus, of Scotus to the defining, presumptuous, and worldly Aquinas. His mass books and books of devotion included an illuminated Flemish book of hours (now at Stonyhurst College), once owned by Dame Katherine Bray (<i>d</i>. 1507), widow of Sir Reginald Bray, which bears a petition in his hand for prayers for her soul and Colet's.<br>
<br>Colet's Jerome, with unspecified printed books and his bed and bedding from his house in the grounds of the Sheen Charterhouse, he left to one John Bambrughe. Thomas Lupset, &#145;my scholer&#146;, was to have such printed books as he needed; those remaining went to poor students and others &#145;who have been scholars with me&#146;. Some of the manuscripts of Colet's own works went to St Paul's School. Other codices reached the royal library. In the three volumes containing the epistles (1506) and gospels (1509), Erasmus's new version was transcribed by Meghen from the edition of 1522 into the space originally left for commentary; pages were added and the set completed with a separate volume containing both versions of <span class="roman">Acts</span> and <span class="roman">Apocalypse</span>. The three may have been augmented for Henry VIII and the fourth, written for him and Katherine of Aragon (Hatfield House, Cecil papers, MS 324), appropriated by Lord Burghley to add to his other Meghen manuscripts, including the fair copy of Colet on Pseudo-Dionysius (BL, Add. MS 63853).<h2>
<a name="Coletswritingsandtheirdissemination"></a>Colet's writings and their dissemination</h2>Colet's surviving writings are almost exclusively in Latin. Some, listed by sixteenth-century authorities such as John Bale (1548, 1557&#150;9) and John Pits (1619), are not extant; others remained in manuscript, often singly. Works in English, chiefly sermons perhaps, are also lost, the few printed English versions all dating from after his death. The English of his convocation sermon may be Lupset's; and the English in which Latin accidence is presented in his printed <span class="italic">Aeditio</span> and the few miscellaneous texts preceding it, most likely Colet's, is just possibly that of a translator. Editions of his grammatical work from before 1527 are not extant, and no printing is known of his <span class="italic">Right Fruitful Monition</span> from before 1534. An English paraphrase of the Lord's prayer attributed to him was not printed until 1534. Of his extant manuscripts only the school statutes and a prayer to the Virgin (almost Colet's only surviving reference to Mary) among the annotations in the All Souls Ficino are in the vernacular.<br>
<br>The only Latin work by Colet to have been printed in his lifetime is his convocation sermon. Some codices of the Latin works, according to a note in one of them, probably by Tunstall, were lost &#145;incuria puerorum&#146; (&#145;through the carelessness of the boys&#146; [or &#145;of his servants&#146;]). The rest, remaining in manuscript until the nineteenth century, present severe chronological problems; assigned by some to his Oxford period, they have also been seen as belonging to the second decade of the sixteenth century. Colet's chief Latin works are: two commentaries on St Paul's epistle to the <span class="roman">Romans</span>, one on the whole epistle, the other, unfinished, on the first five chapters; a commentary on <span class="roman">1 Corinthians</span>; a commentary on <span class="roman">1 Peter</span>, with maxims from other Pauline epistles; a commentary on, or rather a series of responses to, the <span class="italic">Celestial</span> and <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical Hierarchies</span> of the Pseudo-Dionysius; two brief tractates, <span class="italic">De sacramentis</span> and <span class="italic">De corpore Christi mystico</span>; an unfinished commentary on the account of creation in the opening chapter of <span class="roman">Genesis</span>; and annotations of the <span class="italic">Epistolae</span> in which Ficino briefly explained his doctrines. None of the manuscripts bears a date; the make-up of one, in particular, may confirm Bale's report that works were discovered &#145;unbound&#146; (&#145;divaricatis pagellis&#146;) after Colet's death.<br>
<br>Colet's copy of Ficino's <span class="italic">Epistolae</span> could have been acquired in England or France, but is more likely to have been an Italian purchase. His annotations of it must postdate its publication on 11 March 1495, though they, still less the transcripts and notes in his hand on its flyleaves, need not belong to a single period. The transcripts consist of two polished letters from Ficino to Colet, one brief, playing self-deprecatingly with light and sun imagery; the other longer and dealing with the currently important questions of intellect and will, on which Colet's position remained voluntarist. They are accompanied by two awkwardly expressed drafts, again in Colet's hand, of a short letter to Ficino. That these indicate a Florentine visit and a meeting with Ficino (1433&#150;1499) at Careggi is at least likely; Pico della Mirandola (1463&#150;1494) Colet seems to have known only through his writings. Exactly how long after his return Colet jotted down that he would do his best, &#145;next Monday, at the usual time and place&#146;, to expound <span class="roman">1 Corinthians</span> is unsure.<br>
<br>One of the manuscripts of Colet on <span class="roman">1 Corinthians</span> (CUL, Gg.4.26, which contains more than one work and may consist of loose papers gathered together by a later hand) is autograph, on paper, the script sometimes careful, sometimes hurried, with Colet's diagrams, corrections, and insertions and an occasional single word in Greek. The other manuscript (Cambridge, Emmanuel College, MS III.3.12) is a fair copy on vellum by Meghen, with no Greek or diagrams and only minimal signs of later intervention. The unique manuscript of the commentary on the whole of <span class="roman">Romans</span>, a scribal transcript with corrections and insertions by Colet, begins the Cambridge University Library codex: it concludes with the word &#145;Oxoniae&#146;. Colet's commentary on the first five chapters of <span class="roman">Romans</span>, addressed to a young man named Edmund and ending imperfectly, in Meghen's transcript, with additions and corrections by Colet, begins Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 355: it too is unique. The maxims extracted from the Pauline epistles and the brief commentary on <span class="roman">1 Peter</span> exist only in Trinity College, Cambridge, MS O.4.44. The hand of this is more Italianate than any of those in other Colet manuscripts; its old royal library pressmark is of <i>c</i>.1548.<br>
<br>Colet's commentary on <span class="roman">Genesis</span> is addressed to an unidentified Ralph and breaks off, unfinished, at 1: 14; it exists uniquely in a fair copy, probably not by Meghen, which occupies the second part of Corpus Christi College, MS 355. The treatise on Christ's mystical body, like the unique surviving copy of the letter to Kidderminster, is preserved in Colet's autograph in the Cambridge University Library manuscript; which also contains a perhaps scribal transcript, with Colet's additions and corrections, of his responses to the texts he selected from the <span class="italic">Celestial Hierarchy</span> of the Pseudo-Dionysius. Meghen's transcript of Colet on both <span class="italic">Hierarchies</span> and <span class="italic">De sacramentis</span> constitute BL, Add. MS 63853, where the text of the <span class="italic">Celestial Hierarchy</span> is a fair copy of the Cambridge University Library manuscript, incorporating Colet's changes. A copy made from the British Library manuscript later in the sixteenth century is now in St Paul's School Library.<br>
<br>Meghen's copies, with the second part of the Corpus Christi codex, apparently constitute a sort of collected edition intended to preserve the views of its author, for his private use. That three of its constituents are unfinished and at least two addressed to specific persons suggests that, if they record Colet's Oxford lectures, they do so in a modified form. When the collected edition was put together is uncertain; it may have been soon after Colet left Oxford and came into his inheritance, about the time when he was employing Meghen on his <span class="roman">New Testament</span> manuscripts. Meghen had been working for English patrons from about 1503 at latest; no date later than 1509 appears in any undoubted surviving work of his for Colet, and the hand of the transcripts is stylistically related to his work of about that time. Some at least of Colet's emendations and annotations on some of the copies may have been made at any time before September 1519; a few headings and annotations were added after his death, probably by Tunstall.<br>
<br>In responding to Pseudo-Dionysius's <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical Hierarchy</span> Colet quotes at length from Pico's <span class="italic">Apologia</span> or <span class="italic">Oratio</span>, repeating the substance of the quotation in both his commentaries on <span class="roman">Romans</span>. Pico's mode of regarding the creation in the <span class="italic">Heptaplus</span> is simplified and moralized in Colet's commentary on <span class="roman">Genesis</span>, and the <span class="italic">Heptaplus</span> quoted both in his commentaries on <span class="roman">1 Corinthians</span> and the whole of <span class="roman">Romans</span>. To Pico he is indebted for at least one quotation from the commentary on <span class="roman">Romans</span> by Origen, whom Erasmus names as Colet's favourite. <span class="italic">Contra Celsum</span>, available through Cristoforo Persona's Latin version in manuscript or print (1482), he cites once, to emphasize the allegorical character of the writings attributed to Moses; he also knew Origen on <span class="roman">Romans</span> in Rufinus's Latin, first printed in 1506. Colet's awareness of the Greek father of allegorical exegesis, regarded by Erasmus as first after St Paul among the interpreters of scripture who go beyond the literal meaning, may belong to the same time as his preoccupation with what he could know through Pico and Reuchlin of the Hebrew cabbala as a guide to hidden biblical significance.<br>
<br>The chronological and interpretative problems of Colet's surviving works are not diminished by the constancy both of his exegetical method&#151;which is homiletic, individual, idiosyncratic, and, by the end of his life, old-fashioned, especially in its failure to take account of Greek&#151;and of the attitude to humanity and divinity at its root. His tendency to respond unsystematically to those sections of a given text that support him in his search for what he called &#145;living wisdom&#146;, visible most clearly in his annotations of Ficino and in his encounter with Pseudo-Dionysius, is also apparent in his Pauline commentaries. These do not attempt to treat every biblical verse, nor are they preoccupied with theology, philology, or history. Colet's single-minded purpose is to move men to holiness by instructing them in the relevance to it of selected propositions. Insisting on the primacy and inexhaustible meaningfulness of scripture, he applies everything in it, in the Pauline manner, to Christ, the great exemplar. Spiritual significance being both pervasive and paramount can be truly grasped and imparted, not through knowledge but through grace, only by the spiritual man, who is not necessarily a priest. All but dualistic in his estimate of diabolic power, troubled by the world's depravity, Colet is continually severe against the flesh. Only by asceticism and prayer can the grace be sought that will lead through purgation and illumination to perfection and the soul's union with God.<br>
<br>Attachment to the Neoplatonism he knew from the Pseudo-Dionysius, from Ficino's original works, and Ficino's translations of Plato and Plotinus must have strengthened Colet's mistrust of scholasticism and partiality to St Paul. Mistrust would have been augmented by his association with Erasmus, whose influence on him was plainly immense; the importance of Colet in the formation of Erasmus's thought, long regarded as proven, less so. Always capable of opposing or rejecting the positions to which the more learned and acute Erasmus sought to steer him, however, Colet remained profoundly his own man as he attempted to arrive at holiness through a true perception of scripture.<h2>
<a name="Influenceandreputation"></a>Influence and reputation</h2>Colet's posthumous influence, limited by his reluctance to publish and exerted indirectly through St Paul's School, is entirely English. The same may almost be said of his reputation. Though, as the Basel reformer Johannes Oecolampadius noted, Colet's name echoes through the writings of Erasmus, only two other continental scholars, Marquardt von Hattstein and Martin Bucer, are recorded as catching its resonance. The long retrospective assessment of his friend and patron that Erasmus addressed, almost two years after Colet's death, to Justus Jonas in the hope of dissuading him from conversion to Lutheranism, failed in that attempt, though its publication in the year of its composition (it is dated 13 June 1521) must have attracted attention.<br>
<br>This biographical memorial letter, an extended comparison of the well-to-do dean of St Paul's with the poor Franciscan, Jean Vitrier, as exemplars of true piety, was intended also to demonstrate to Jonas how far criticism of the church of the time could go without apostasy. It was early converted to their use by English reformers. On 2 July 1533 an English translation by Matthew Tyndall was sent by Tyndall to Thomas Cromwell, and Erasmus's letter itself was drawn on by John Foxe in <span class="italic">Actes and Monuments</span> (1563). Foxe added the testimony of two Lollards that they had gone to London to hear Colet preach, but also rightly names Colet as among persecutors of their sect. By then Colet had disappeared from English Catholic consciousness and his transformation from a firmly faithful member of the pre-Reformation Catholic church, unorthodox in opinion and less than discreet in expression, to a reformer <i>avant la lettre</i> was well under way. In 1529 William Tyndale had reported him as in trouble with his bishop for rendering the Pater noster in English; in 1552 Hugh Latimer had him in danger of burning as a heretic; and in 1562 John Jewel, bishop of Salisbury, attempted to enlist him among the forerunners of protestantism&#151;to which the Catholic Thomas Harding in 1566 retorted: &#145;as for John Colet, he hath never a word to show, for he wrote no works&#146;.<br>
<br>If Colet's protestant reputation depends to an extent on the protestant interpretation of the testimony of Erasmus in this letter and elsewhere, the same is true, in a sense, about Colet's reputation at large, at least until the later twentieth century, when Erasmus's accounts came to be treated with greater caution. There are ways in which Colet's situation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> Erasmus parallels that of Thomas More, of whom Erasmus also gave an account in a Latin letter, addressed to a Lutheran sympathizer, Ulrich von Hutten, in 1519, and with whom he corresponded more copiously than with Colet. The letters are alike in presenting their subjects as they were before the convulsions of the Reformation, in which More was deeply involved and which Colet was spared by death. More, however, was already famous in the European humanist community for his <span class="italic">Utopia</span> and his poems (which Erasmus had helped him to publish), and for his involvement in the controversies that followed the <span class="italic">Praise of Folly</span> and Erasmus's new <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. From both before and after Erasmus's letter, firsthand evidence from More's own writings has long been available in quantity. For Colet, that was lacking until the later nineteenth century. Erasmus, with his discreetly flattering accounts of his and Colet's debates and other dealings, sometimes affected in recollection and by a tendency to favour his own part, is often the only witness to important aspects of Colet's life and character. Like Erasmus's estimates of others, More included, the portrait of Colet in the letter to Jonas of 1521 has elements in it of a self-portrait.<br>
<br>Colet's protestant reputation is discernible in Samuel Knight's biography (1724, reprinted 1823), which was based on the seventeenth-century collections of White Kennett, bishop of Peterborough (BL, Lansdowne MS 1030); it is still visible in the work of the nineteenth-century pioneer in Colet studies, J. H. Lupton, surmaster of St Paul's School. Much is owed to Lupton who, in a series of volumes published between 1867 and 1876, made available for the first time Colet's Latin writings with, for the most part, accompanying English translations, to which he added a translation of Erasmus's letter to Jonas and a <span class="italic">Life</span> of his hero. Lupton's imperfect texts and versions were for well over a century, with the important exception of Jayne's edition and translation of Colet's marginalia to the <span class="italic">Epistolae</span> of Marsilio Ficino, virtually the only published means of access to Colet's writings; they have been superseded only partially by O'Kelly and Jarrott (<span class="roman">1 Corinthians</span>, 1985) and Gleason (<span class="italic">De sacramentis</span>, 1989). Lupton was much influenced by his friend Frederic Seebohm's <span class="italic">Oxford Reformers of 1499</span>, particularly in his ideas about Colet's originality and his importance for the English church. Their Colet gave place only in the second half of the twentieth century, especially in the study of Gleason (1989), to a Colet made more credible by a fuller appreciation of the religious and intellectual context of his time.<br>
