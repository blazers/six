</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Moat,  Henry</span>  (1871&#150;1940), <span class="occ">servant</span>, was born on 2 August 1871 at 17 The Cragg, Whitby, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, the son of John Moat (<i>b</i>. 1827/8), master joiner, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Carter (<i>b</i>. 1831/2). By his own account the Moats were descended from a family of Italian jet cutters, the Moatti, who came to England in the late sixteenth century; certainly the family had been resident in Whitby for more than 200 years by the time of Henry's birth. At the 1881 census Moat and his immediate family were living with his maternal grandparents at The Cragg, with Henry attending a local school. Little more is known about Moat's life before he entered the service of Sir George Reresby Sitwell, antiquary and father of the authors Edith, Osbert, and Sacheverell Sitwell. He may be the Henry Moat of Whitby listed as lodging in Ripon in the 1891 census.<br>
<br>On 26 October 1893 Moat joined the Sitwell household as a footman. One of his first acts was to etch his name, and the date of his arrival, on a window pane of the pantry at Renishaw Hall, Derbyshire, then the Sitwells' principal residence. So began Moat's forty-two-year association with Sir George, during which time he rose to become the family's butler about 1902. His, however, was not a continuous life in service. Moat left Sir George's employment on a number of occasions, his longest absence from the family being between April 1913 and 1923. In this period he worked briefly and unhappily as butler to a Hampshire fur trader before joining the Army Service Corps, in which he served throughout the First World War. On his return to the Sitwells in the 1920s Moat resumed as butler&#151;now principally at Sir George's Italian property, Castello di Montegufoni, near Florence&#151;and retained this post until his retirement in the following decade.<br>
<br>Moat's extended absences from the Sitwell household were typically prompted by his frequent disputes with Sir George, with whom Henry enjoyed and endured a relationship that was simultaneously affectionate, confrontational, intimate, long-suffering, and considerate. Its ebb and flow was lovingly charted by Osbert Sitwell in his autobiography, <span class="italic">Left Hand, Right Hand!</span> (1945&#150;50) and in Sitwell's publication of extracts of Moat's correspondence in <span class="italic">Tales my Father Taught Me</span> (1962). Osbert and Henry were lifelong friends, often drawn together by shared exasperation at Sir George's behaviour, and it was through Sitwell's popular autobiographical works that Moat reached a wider audience as the colourful but dedicated servant who was not afraid to bite back.<br>
<br>Periods of worsening relations between employer and butler were often brought on by another of what Moat described as &#145;Sir George's fads&#146; or eccentric schemes. These he typically dismissed with a characteristic deadpan rebuff. One such exchange followed Sitwell's proposal that all knife handles be replaced with new ones made of condensed milk. &#145;Henry looked particularly disgusted at the idea and very worried at its application. Then with emphasis, and with an unusual air of correctitude, he countered, &#147;Yes, Sir George, but what if the cat gets them?&#148;&#146;  (O. Sitwell, <span class="italic">Left Hand</span>, 1.94&#150;5). On another occasion Moat showed his displeasure at his master's habit of filling his houses with Italian ornaments: &#145;I am going to ask him if he will allow me to go through them after him with a huge hammer&#146;  (O. Sitwell, <span class="italic">Tales</span>, 71).<br>
<br>Several of Moat's absences followed his dismissal when an &#145;enjoyment of sensual pleasures&#146; was considered &#145;too pronounced&#146; by Sir George. A heavy man with a taste for alcohol, Moat was notably attractive to women, though he did not marry. More than six foot tall, he gave the &#145;impression of great physical strength&#146; and combined this with a &#145;robust, original and audacious&#146; character  (<span class="italic">Left Hand</span>, 1.95). Osbert's memoir also makes frequent reference to Moat's striding walk and his habit of never leaving the house without his bowler hat. Edith Sitwell offered a more vibrant description of an &#145;enormous purple man like a benevolent hippopotamus &hellip; a voice like some fog-horn endowed with splendour&#146;  (E. Sitwell, 28). Moat's performances in the Renishaw pantry gave him a reputation for sombre wit and irreverence (especially popular with the younger Sitwells), though he was also a lifelong source of advice and support to the children and especially to Osbert. Moat himself retained a fascination with and respect for learning; asked what he would do if he had his life again, he spoke of his wish to &#145;go in for scholarship and deep-thinking&#146;  (<span class="italic">Left Hand</span>, 1.97).<br>
<br>Moat's disputes with his employer could be bitter and prolonged, but no offence was ever severe enough for either man to break off relations fully. To Sir George, Moat was always &#145;the Great Man&#146;, while Henry reciprocated with a blend of &#145;utmost disrespect&#146; and &#145;sentiments approaching veneration&#146;  (<span class="italic">Left Hand</span>, 1.93, 96). Having returned to the Sitwells in 1923, Moat enjoyed one of his happiest periods as butler at Montegufoni, where he passed his time serving and quarrelling with Sir George, learning Italian (which he spoke with a thick North Riding accent), reading in his garret room, drinking, and consorting with visitors such as, in 1928, William Walton and Constant Lambert, to whom he described Sir George as &#145;the strangest old bugger you ever met&#146;  (Ziegler, 5). A life in service meant that Moat spent most of his adulthood outside Yorkshire. Even so he remained intensely proud of his native county. Having fallen ill during an early trip to Italy, he responded to Sir George's offer of assistance by saying that he wanted nothing &#145;except to be buried with his feet in the direction of Whitby&#146;  (<span class="italic">Left Hand</span>, 2.246).<br>
<br>Moat finally retired from Sir George's service in spring 1936. He moved to 1 Beulah Terrace, Falsgrave, Scarborough, from where (&#145;a born letter-writer&#146;) he conducted a regular correspondence with his former employer and with Osbert  (<span class="italic">Left Hand</span>, 1.24). These letters tell of a period of ill health in late 1936 and a new regimen in which he only drank boiled water &#145;for I go to a herbalist and am giving these herbs a fair chance and feel grand&#146;  (20 Sept 1938, ibid., 4.306). In retirement Moat wrote warmly to Sir George (&#145;I think you are wonderful and much to be proud of&#146;), urged him to look after himself by eating more slowly and taking less salt, and concluded that &#145;I have not had a single happy day since I left your service&#146;  (ibid.). Yet, even in later life, he could never refuse the chance to swipe, albeit affectionately. In his final letter to Osbert he noted his surprise on hearing that Sir George had attempted to avoid giving offence: &#145;I don't think it is habitual of him considering others feelings&#146;  (23 Feb 1940, ibid., 4.311). By then Henry Moat was living in his family's Whitby home, 17 The Cragg, where he died, on 23 March 1940. He was buried in Whitby.<br>
