<span class="headword">Stoughton,  John</span>  (1807&#150;1897), <span class="occ">Congregational minister</span>, son of Thomas Stoughton (<i>d</i>. 1812/13) and his wife, Sarah Bullard, daughter of the master of the Norwich Lunatic Asylum (Bethel Hospital), was born in the parish of St Michael-at-Plea, Norwich, on 18 November 1807. His father, son of an admiral in the navy, was a strict churchman. He died when Stoughton was only five years old, and the boy's education was somewhat neglected. His mother, brought up as a Friend but an Anglican from her marriage, taught him to read, and sent him to the Norwich grammar school. While there he saw something of the intellectual coterie which then gave Norwich an exceptional position among provincial cities. His sense of being &#145;called&#146; led him to investigate the various church systems. Placed in the office of a Roman Catholic lawyer, Stoughton turned with zest from the constitutional authorities, William Blackstone and Jean Louis Delolme, to the study of John Milner's <span class="italic">The End of Religious Controversy</span> (1818) and convinced himself that the independent churches most nearly corresponded to the primitive type. To this view he adhered throughout his life. Abandoning the law, Stoughton in 1828 entered Highbury College, where the society of his contemporary Henry Rogers formed a potent intellectual stimulus.<br>
<br>On his ordination in May 1833 Stoughton was called to the co-pastorate of the Congregational church at Windsor. On 12 May 1855 he married Mary Vyse, the daughter of George Cooper of Windsor, and they had eleven children. She died in 1879. He resigned his charge in Windsor in 1844 to succeed to that of Hornton Street Church, Kensington. He remained at Hornton Street for more than thirty years. Though he never took rank among the masters of pulpit eloquence, his sermons attracted the more cultivated middle class. His leisure he devoted to organizations for evangelical propaganda and to literary work, chiefly historical, which gained him wide recognition; he was proposed by Matthew Arnold for the Athenaeum. In 1856 he delivered the Congregational lecture, taking as his subject &#145;The ages of Christendom before the Reformation&#146;, and was elected chairman of the Congregational Union.<br>
<br>After an early study of puritanism in 1848, there appeared in 1862 Stoughton's first important work, <span class="italic">Church and State Two Hundred Years Ago: a History of Ecclesiastical Affairs in England from 1660 to 1663</span>. There followed his elaborate <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical History of England</span> (4 vols., 1867&#150;70), covering civil wars, Commonwealth, and Restoration; though unduly diffuse in style, it showed careful study of original sources and freedom from pedantry and prejudice. With its sequels&#151;<span class="italic">Religion in England under Queen Anne and the Georges</span> (2 vols., 1878) and <span class="italic">Religion in England from 1800 to 1880</span> (2 vols., 1884)&#151;it forms an important contribution to the religious history of England.<br>
<br>At the instance of Lord Ebury, Stoughton compiled an account of nonconformist modes of communicating, which was appended to the fourth report of the ritual commission in 1870  (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1870, 19). Having accepted in 1872 the chair of historical theology in New College, St John's Wood, he resigned on 11 April 1874 the Kensington charge. With his professorial and literary work he combined for many years occasional duty as a preacher. His friendship with prominent members of the Church of England&#151;deans Alford and Hook, archbishops Tait and Magee, and especially Dean A. P. Stanley&#151;was close and distinctive. In the summer of 1876 he arranged a conference between churchmen and dissenters, which met on 4 July in a room in the House of Lords under the presidency of Archbishop Tait, and discussed, without immediate result, the means to co-operation in Christian effort. In 1877 he delivered in Westminster Abbey a lecture on missions, part of a series of discourses by eminent nonconformists instituted by Dean Stanley by way of protest against ecclesiastical exclusiveness. He was one of the pallbearers at the funeral of Dean Stanley on 25 July 1881. He attended the conferences held under the auspices of the Evangelical Alliance at New York in October 1873, at Basel in September 1879, and at Edinburgh in October 1885.<br>
<br>Stoughton's culture was liberal, and was improved by much travel not only in France and Germany but also in Italy&#151;Rome he visited three times&#151;Spain, and Palestine. His travels furnished him with materials for three popular books of some merit: <span class="italic">Homes and Haunts of Luther</span> (1875; new edn 1883), <span class="italic">Footprints of Italian Reformers</span> (1881), and <span class="italic">The Spanish Reformers, their Memories and Dwelling Places</span> (1883).<br>
<br>Stoughton was no systematic theologian, and, after having his say on the Oxford Movement in <span class="italic">Lectures on Tractarian Theology</span> (1843), eschewed controversy. His only contribution to apologetics was a lecture, &#145;The nature and value of the miraculous testimony to Christianity&#146;, printed in <span class="italic">Modern Scepticism</span>, edited by C. J. Ellicott (1881). He also published a number of minor works, mostly historical and biblical, but including lives of William Wilberforce (1880) and William Penn (1882).<br>
<br>Stoughton was a handsome man with a robust physique. On 27 June 1884 he resigned his chair and retired to Ealing. In retirement he often visited Tunbridge Wells. He died at his home, Oberlin House, St Leonard's Road, Ealing, on 24 October 1897 and was buried in Ealing cemetery.<br>
