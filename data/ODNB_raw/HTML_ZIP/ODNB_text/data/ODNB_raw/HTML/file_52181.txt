<span class="headword">Gisors,  John (I)  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1282), <span class="occ">merchant and mayor of London</span>, laid the foundations for the success of a family, probably of Norman origin, who can be traced in London for nearly three hundred years. The son of Peter de Gisors, John married a sister of Arnold Fitzthedmar, alderman and chronicler. He was sheriff in 1240&#150;41 and 1245, and alderman of the ward of Vintry from 1243 to <i>c</i>.1263. He lived on the riverside in the parish of St Martin Vintry, and acquired extensive property elsewhere in the city and nearby counties.<br>
<br>Gisors traded chiefly in wines, often transported in his own ships. His sales, and his purchases of wines as butler for the royal household, as well as other services, led to a profitable association with Henry III. The king entrusted the shrievalty of London to him in December 1245, and the custody of the city in 1254. The royalist group among the aldermen was strong enough to elect Gisors as mayor from January to October 1246 and again for the year from 28 October 1258, and &#145;that, too, even in his absence&#146; wrote the chronicler  (Riley, 42). But by that time the king's position had deteriorated, and the city's approval of the provisions issued by the Oxford parliament was required by the baronial reformers. Although the king was again in control by 1261&#151;he appointed Gisors master of the exchange in 1262&#151;rioting in London and a populist mayor in office allowed Simon de Montfort to establish himself at the Tower of London in 1263, despite an attempt by Gisors and his friends to trap him. Gisors headed a list of men the rebels planned to kill, but he was saved by the news of the royalist victory at Evesham in August 1265. In poor health in 1263, he died in 1282. A will, enrolled before the court of husting on 27 April 1282, conveys little impression of his wealth.<br>
<br>Gisors's eldest son, John (II) de Gisors (<i>d</i>. 1296), alderman of the ward of Vintry in 1282&#150;96, was in turn the father of <a name="cosubject_52180"></a><span class="headword">John (III) Gisors</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1351), <span class="occ">mayor of London</span>. Of this John's four brothers and four sisters, Anketin, alderman (1312&#150;36) and six times MP, was the most prominent. John (III) married twice, first Isabella, who was dead by 1350, and second Alice. Possibly knighted, he inherited valuable properties in and near London; part of Gisors Hall, built by his father in the parish of St Mildred, Bread Street, was to survive until the mid-nineteenth century. A vintner and rentier, not a pepperer, he probably lived in the parish of St Martin Vintry.<br>
<br>Gisors was alderman from 1306, from 1310 for the ward of Vintry, when conflicting personalities and shifting interests both in London and the kingdom seriously threatened Edward II's control of his turbulent capital. He held the mayoralty from 28 October 1311, soon after the king had been forced to accept reforms proposed by the lords ordainer, until October 1313, and again from 1314 to 1315. He maintained the traditional protection of London's liberties, defending the franchise, and resisting both levies of tallage and investigation by royal justices of misdeeds of officials.<br>
<br>Gisors's family interests in the wine trade, harmed by royal favour to Gascon importers, drew him at first into opposition to the king. But while all citizens were agreed on protection of their monopoly of retail trade, not all supported Gisors's vigorous anti-alien policy, which in the spring of 1312 he pressed through in assemblies to which representatives of wards had been added. Conflicting objectives divided both leading merchants and retailers within trades. A year later an assembly, which included representatives from each trade, decreed that craft regulations, then implicitly recognized, should be publicized and enforced. All became alarmed by the city's growing lawlessness, of which Gisors had personal knowledge when in September 1312 unruly crowds surrounded the Guildhall and insisted on seeing for themselves that he was not under arrest. By the summer of 1313 Gisors and his friends were ready to co-operate with more conservative aldermen whose leader, William Leyre, was, with Gisors, elected on 10 August 1314 to represent the city at the York parliament. Attempts were made to check the uproar that had accompanied civic elections by a decree of 1313, repeated in 1315, that only &#145;the more discreet and powerful citizens&#146; should take part  (Sharpe, <span class="italic">Calendar of Letter Book D</span>, 25).<br>
<br>By 1320, when Edward and Hugh Despenser the younger moved to tighten control of London, Gisors was coming under attack. When royal justices sat at the Tower of London from 13 January to 20 May 1321 to challenge privileges and investigate grievances, Gisors was found guilty of having in 1312 predated the grant of the freedom to a committed felon so that he could release him on bail, a privilege restricted to freemen. Such use of his powers as an elected mayor, and other complaints against him, provided the king with the pretext he needed to suspend the mayoralty and appoint a royal warden. Gisors was arrested, fined, and removed from his aldermanry.<br>
<br>By 1323 Gisors was supporting Roger Mortimer, whose escape from the Tower he assisted, and in November 1326, when Queen Isabella with her son and Mortimer were welcomed in London after violent scenes, the Tower was surrendered to him. He led the city's delegation to see the king at Kenilworth in January 1327. But by March 1327 Gisors was no longer constable of the Tower, and he played no part in public life in later years. He died in 1351, leaving three sons and one daughter and his widow, Alice; his will, dated 5 January 1351, was enrolled before the court of husting on 19 January 1351. He left bequests for a chantry to be set up in the church of St Martin Vintry, where he and other members of the family were buried.<br>
