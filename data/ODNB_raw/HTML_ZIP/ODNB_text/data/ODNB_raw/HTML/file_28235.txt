<span class="headword">Verney,  Richard</span>, eleventh Baron Willoughby de Broke  (1622&#150;1711), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 28 January 1622 at Kingston, Warwickshire, the third of five children of Sir Greville Verney (1585/6&#150;1642) and his wife, Katherine (1590/91&#150;1657), daughter of Sir Robert Southwell and his wife, Elizabeth Howard, daughter of the first earl of Nottingham. Together with his younger brother George, he was admitted to Jesus College, Cambridge, on 30 March 1640.<br>
<br>Verney and his family were neutral during the civil war, though with sufficient royalist sympathies to be assessed at &pound;3500 by the committee for the advance of money. The Verneys were an old and wealthy Warwickshire family and though as a younger son Richard did not inherit much property at his father's death in 1642, he was able to purchase an estate at Allexton, Leicestershire, in 1652, which was valued at &pound;1000 per annum in 1660. Shortly before this he married Mary Pretyman (<i>bap</i>. 1631, <i>d</i>. 1663), daughter of the royalist Sir John Pretyman of Lodington, Leicestershire, and his wife, Elizabeth Turpin. After Mary's death Verney married Frances, daughter and heir of Thomas Dove of Upton, Northamptonshire. Some time in the 1670s he moved to Belton, Rutland, and, at the death of his great-nephew William, on 23 August 1683, he inherited the principal Verney family estate at Compton Verney, Warwickshire.<br>
<br>With strong court support Verney was elected to parliament from Warwickshire in 1685, despite opposition from the whig Sir Richard Newdigate. He was knighted on 1 April 1685 after presenting a loyal address from his county to James II. He was &#145;discreetly absent&#146;  (<span class="italic">VCH Leicestershire</span>, 2.120) in 1687 when the questions were presented regarding the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> and penal laws, and he was temporarily removed from office as a JP. Verney was elected from Warwickshire to the Convention Parliament and voted with the bulk of his fellow tories against declaring the throne vacant and making William and Mary king and queen. He was not returned to parliament in 1690.<br>
<br>At the prompting of his son John, Verney petitioned the House of Lords on 11 December 1694 to be formally recognized as Baron Brooke, tracing his claim to an individual writ of summons to the Lords received in 1491 by his ancestor Sir Robert Willoughby. Several objections were raised against this claim, including that an individual writ of summons in the fifteenth century did not automatically create a peerage; that if it did, it could not descend through a female line, as Verney's claim did; and that, even if it could so descend, the claim was extinguished first when it fell into abeyance and even more when Willoughby's direct heir, Sir Fulke Greville (1554&#150;1628), was created Baron Brooke of Beauchamps Court on 29 January 1621. The current Baron Brooke especially objected to Verney's claiming the barony of Brooke, which may have influenced the Lords to reject his petition.<br>
<br>The following year Verney renewed his petition but this time, to appease Baron Brooke, claimed the title of Baron Willoughby de Broke. Despite the protest of some peers that the issue had already been decided the upper house voted to hear the case again. Verney's petition was approved on 13 February 1696 and he took his seat as Baron Willoughby de Broke on 27 February, at which time he signed the association in defence of William III. The pedigree submitted by Verney was published and the case became an important precedent for the inheritance of peerages.<br>
<br>In the Lords, Willoughby de Broke was a solid though usually silent tory, opposing the Fenwick attainder bill, supporting bills against occasional conformity, and voting against the impeachment of Henry Sacheverell. He was more active in local affairs, including participating in election strategy meetings of Warwickshire tories. He served as justice of the peace in Warwickshire from 1660 to his death in 1711, as well as sheriff (1683&#150;4) and deputy lord lieutenant (1686&#150;7, 1689&#150;1711) of that county and sheriff (1681&#150;2) and deputy lord lieutenant (1682&#150;8) of Rutland. He helped Sir William Dugdale in preparing his <span class="italic">Antiquities of Warwickshire</span> by drawing some local maps and monuments. Both Dugdale and the Rutland historian James Wright praised Verney as &#145;a true lover of Antiquities&#146;  (Wright, 22). Verney died on the night of 28 July 1711 at Compton Verney and was buried in the chapel there. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
<br>Verney's eldest son, John (1652&#150;1707), was MP for Leicestershire in 1685 and again from 1695 to 1707, except for the last parliament of William III; his second son, George (1661&#150;1728), became dean of Windsor and succeeded his father as Baron Willoughby de Broke. A third son, Thomas, a merchant, died in 1681 and a daughter, Mary, married Samuel Davenport of Calveley, Cheshire. From his second marriage Verney had a son, Richard, who died unmarried in 1698, and a daughter, Diana, who married Sir Charles Shuckburgh.<br>
