<span class="headword">Wadding,  Luke</span>  (1631&#150;1687), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic bishop of Ferns</span>, was born in the town of Wexford, the son of Walter Wadding and Mary Sinnott. His father was a younger son of a landed family settled at nearby Ballycogley since the twelfth century. By the 1630s the townspeople of Wexford, with very few exceptions, had opted for the Catholic Counter-Reformation, and the Wadding family were prominent in the affairs of the confederate Catholics during the 1640s.<br>
<br>However, on 11 October 1649 the town was stormed by Oliver Cromwell; the army ran amok and there was much loss of life and damage to property. Two years later, on 7 October 1651, Wadding was, in his own words, &#145;banished&#146; and went into exile  (Corish, 51). He studied at the University of Paris, was ordained priest, and taught for some time in Paris in some capacity. In 1667 his name was among those put forward for the presidency of the Irish College in Louvain. The next year, 1668, the bishop of Ferns, Nicholas French, in exile and with little prospect of returning to Ireland, named Wadding his vicar-general. Wadding returned to Ireland and settled in New Ross. Bishop French's hopes of returning steadily declined, and Wadding was appointed coadjutor bishop on 6 May 1671. He accepted the nomination, but French agreed that the consecration might be deferred until after his own death. Shortly afterwards Wadding moved to Wexford.<br>
<br>The town still bore scars of the sack of 1649. It was controlled by an exclusively protestant corporation, but many of the former Roman Catholic merchants had returned. Their presence had to be at least connived at if economic life was to be carried on, and it appears that in some respects relations were quite good. Certainly Wadding was on good terms with many protestants as he set about rebuilding his own Catholic community. He began a series of parish registers that are the oldest extant in the Roman Catholic church in Ireland, and he recorded many details in a personal notebook, which survives. Pride of place in this was given to listing his library of about 700 works, ranging from the standard theology and spirituality of the Counter-Reformation to the English metaphysical poets.<br>
<br>In 1684 Wadding published in Ghent <span class="italic">A Small Garland of Pious and Godly Songs for the Solace of his Friends in their Afflictions</span>; a popular work, it was to be reprinted a number of times during the eighteenth century. It included a collection of Christmas carols, reflecting a local tradition ranging from before the Reformation to the present day. His notebook also details his efforts to furnish the chapel that the protestant corporation allowed him to build in 1684 and the house that he acquired in the same year.<br>
<br>When the Popish Plot had erupted in September 1678 it was inevitable that Wadding should have been indicted. He escaped conviction, however, because he had good friends among the protestant community and because he could plead in all honesty that he was neither a bishop nor a vicar-general, this office having lapsed on Bishop French's death in Ghent on 13 August 1678. Wadding was soon under pressure not to defer his consecration any longer, but it was only prudent to be cautious for a time. No record of episcopal consecration survives but it took place some time in 1683 or 1684. After the accession of James II he attended the first of the provincial synods held by Archbishop Russell of Dublin in July 1685. Like the other bishops, he received a pension from the king, in his case &pound;150 a year, but he did not live long to enjoy it. That his health began to fail is clear from a number of entries in his notebook dated 1687 detailing the disposition of his possessions after his death. He died in Wexford in December 1687 and was buried in the chapel of the Franciscan friary there.<br>
