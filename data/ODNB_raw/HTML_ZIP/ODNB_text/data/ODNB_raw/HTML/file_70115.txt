<span class="headword">Fontenelle,  Louisa</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Mrs Williamson]</span>  (1769&#150;1799), <span class="occ">actress and singer</span>, was born on 31 August 1769 in the parish of St Margaret, Lothbury, London, the daughter of John Fontenell and his wife, Ann. After receiving a boarding-school education designed to fit her for the life of a respectable tradesman's wife, the lively girl became set on a stage career and made her d&eacute;but at Covent Garden on 6 November 1788, as Moggy in the premi&egrave;re of John O'Keeffe's comic opera <span class="italic">The Highland Reel</span>. The <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> commented that her face and figure were attractive and her eyes expressive and that she performed &#145;with great spirit, vivacity, and comic effect&#146;  (p. 373). Later in the season she created Sophia in O'Keeffe's <span class="italic">The Toy</span>, sang the highwayman Macheath in John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>, and, at her own benefit, played Priscilla Tomboy in T. A. Lloyd's afterpiece <span class="italic">The Romp</span>. Her high spirits pleased at first, but audiences grew tired of &#145;too much liveliness, and too many gestures&#146;  (Haslewood, 2.307) and the Covent Garden management did not retain her beyond her first season. Miss Fontenelle appeared at the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh, in winter 1789&#150;90, playing soubrette roles in plays and musical afterpieces, and after this performed in London only in the lightweight pieces of the Haymarket summer seasons of 1790&#150;93. In Scotland she also appeared at Glasgow and at the newly opened theatre in Dumfries in 1792 and 1793, where Robert Burns admired &#145;her personal charms, amiable manner &amp; gentle heart&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Letters</span>, 683). He wrote a prologue, <span class="italic">The Rights of Woman</span>, for her benefit in November 1792 and asked that she should include the afterpiece <span class="italic">The Spoiled Child</span>, in which she played the mischievous boy, Little Pickle. He also wrote the verses <span class="italic">On Seeing Miss Fontenelle in a Favourite Character</span> (&#145;Sweet na&iuml;vet&eacute; of feature &hellip;&#146;) and a new prologue for her 1793 benefit. The actor John Brown Williamson (<i>d</i>. 1802) was a fellow performer at the Haymarket, in Edinburgh, and at Dumfries. She joined his company of English actors on an unsuccessful tour of Germany, and in 1795 they emigrated together to the USA, where Fontenelle acted as Mrs Williamson, although it is unclear whether they married or whether Williamson's first wife was still alive. They made their American d&eacute;but at the Federal Street Theater, Boston, Massachusetts, on 25 January 1796, with John in the title role of <span class="italic">Othello</span> and Louisa as Little Pickle in the afterpiece. Her performance was described by one critic as &#145;the most astonishing and brilliant display of theatrical genius ever exhibited in America&#146;  (Hornblow, 1.236&#150;7). Williamson was appointed manager of the company in May 1796, but sustained disastrous losses in his first season. The couple acted in New York in summer 1797 and that autumn made their first appearances at Charleston, South Carolina, where Williamson became senior manager of the theatre company the following year and where Louisa's appearances in her three favourite roles, Moggy, Priscilla Tomboy, and Little Pickle, drew crowded houses. In December 1797 she played Rosalind in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, a performance described as &#145;impressive, gay, touching and pointed&#146;  (Willis, 372), and she was later to play Portia and the breeches role of Sir Harry Wildair. She died after three days' illness in Charleston, South Carolina, on 31 October 1799; the Charleston theatre was closed until 4 November as a mark of respect, and John Williamson did not act again for almost two months. He died on 28 March 1802.<br>
