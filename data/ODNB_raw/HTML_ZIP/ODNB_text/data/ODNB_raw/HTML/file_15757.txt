<span class="headword">Knollys,  William</span>, first earl of Banbury  (<em>c.</em>1545&#150;1632), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15755/', "Sir Francis Knollys (1511/12&#150;1596)")</script>, politician, and his wife, Katherine (1529/30&#150;1569), daughter of William Carey of Aldenham, Hertfordshire, and his wife, Mary. His mother was Anne Boleyn's niece, and so Knollys was cousin to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8636/', "Elizabeth I")</script>, a relationship that did much to advance his career. His brothers included Henry (<i>c</i>.1542&#150;1582), Edward (<i>c</i>.1546&#150;1575), Robert (<i>c</i>.1547&#150;1619), Richard (<i>c</i>.1548&#150;1596), and Francis (<i>c</i>.1550&#150;1648), who were all MPs. He had four sisters, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8159/', "Lettice Dudley (1543&#150;1634)")</script>. He was particularly close to Lettice. The exact date and place of Knollys's birth is unknown. In his youth his parents took great care of his education: he was first tutored by Julins Palmer, who was burnt as a heretic in 1556, and then studied at Eton College (1560). Knollys attended Magdalen College, Oxford, probably as a commoner, in or before 1564 (where he was tutored by Laurence Humphrey), and then the Middle Temple in 1565. He was created MA on 27 September 1592.<br>
<br>In 1569 Knollys commanded a company during the suppression of the northern uprising and in 1570 he became a gentleman pensioner. He served under his father guarding Mary, queen of Scots, at Bolton Castle, Yorkshire, in July and August 1568 and was in both the expeditions into Scotland in 1570 and at the siege of Edinburgh Castle in 1573. Knollys was elected MP for Stafford in 1571 and then, in 1572, for Tregony, Cornwall. Shortly afterwards (probably in 1573), he married Dorothy (1529/30&#150;1605), fifth daughter and coheir of Edmund Braye, first Baron Braye, and his wife, Jane, and widow of Edmund Brydges, second Baron Chandos. The couple had no surviving children. In 1582 Knollys's position in the world changed dramatically after the death of his older brother, Henry. Now his father's heir, he assumed a more prominent political role. He joined Sir Francis Knollys as knight of the shire for Oxfordshire in 1584, and in November 1585 the queen sent him to Scotland as ambassador-extraordinary. In January 1586 he left for the Netherlands, where he served as a captain under his brother-in-law Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, who knighted him. Knollys's association with Leicester went back to the earl's marriage to his sister in 1578; he was a trustee of her jointure in 1584. He supported his knighthood with the profits from his office as keeper of the Marshalsea prison (1586). Although Knollys did not stay on the continent long, he served briefly as governor of Ostend before he returned to England with Leicester, where his military experience and political prominence earned him command of the Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire regiment raised in the Armada crisis of 1588.<br>
<br>Knollys was re-elected as knight of the shire for Oxfordshire in 1593, 1597, and 1601. He was the senior knight after his father's death in 1596. His succession to his father's position meant a significant increase in his power. Until 1596 his political role centred mostly on the House of Commons and local affairs&#151;he was an active JP and deputy lieutenant, particularly in Oxfordshire and Berkshire. On 30 August 1596, however, the queen appointed him comptroller of the household and a privy councilor, both positions that his father once occupied. She also named him lord lieutenant of Oxfordshire and Berkshire, an office he held for almost forty years. In 1599 Knollys returned to the Netherlands as an envoy to the states of Holland.<br>
<br>Knollys was uncle to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7565/', "Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex (1565&#150;1601)")</script>, and sided with his nephew in the factional struggle between the favourite and Sir Robert Cecil. He escaped compromise during Essex's rebellion in 1601, however, and in fact testified for the prosecution during the earl's trial. His timely abandonment of Essex secured him the office of treasurer of the household in 1602, and on 13 May 1603 James I elevated him to the peerage as Baron Knollys of Greys. Still wary of Cecil, Knollys allied himself to the Howards through his second marriage. His first wife died on 31 October 1605 and on 23 December he married Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1586, <i>d</i>. 1658), the nineteen-year-old daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13942/', "Thomas Howard, first earl of Suffolk (1561&#150;1626)")</script>, and his second wife, Katherine. Although over forty years separated the couple, Knollys could now hope for an heir and further political advancement. In the end he achieved both, though he discovered that neither blessing was unalloyed. The couple had two sons, including <a href="#cosubject_15757">Nicholas [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and a daughter. The countess was a well-known Catholic and suspicion fell on both her husband and herself as a result. Over the next ten years Knollys's career flourished, though. In 1606 he became cofferer to Henry, prince of Wales, and in 1613 he entertained Queen Anne at Caversham as she made her way towards Bath, while in 1614 he was appointed a treasury commissioner and master of the court of wards. In the same year rumour falsely appointed him lord chamberlain of the household and in 1615 he followed his father as KG, being elected on 24 April and installed on 22 May. On 7 November 1616 the king promoted him Viscount Wallingford. His prominence at court made him a much sought after patron: he was high steward of Reading, Abingdon, Wallingford, Banbury, and Oxford.<br>
<br>Lord Treasurer Suffolk's fall in 1618 brought his son-in-law down as well. In November John Chamberlain reported that Wallingford would be sacked as master of the court of wards for misadministration. After a brief struggle, he resigned&#151;with the king's consolation that his only fault was his poor choice of a wife. Wallingford was also on bad terms with the new favourite, George Villiers, first duke of Buckingham, who coveted his house in the Tiltyard. A reconciliation of sorts came in 1622, when the duke bought the house.<br>
<br>Although he continued his attendance in the House of Lords and was an active lord lieutenant, Wallingford withdrew from the court after 1619. On 18 August 1626 Charles I promoted him first earl of Banbury, possibly as a reward for his effort to drum up loans for the crown in his lieutenancy. The king provoked the ire of the House of Lords by granting Banbury precedence over six other earls created since the coronation. Charles justified this unusual favour by noting Banbury's lack of an heir, and the house grudgingly accepted, stipulating that the title's precedence would revert to its normal position should there be a second earl. In fact the fears of the house were entirely justified, for on 10 April 1627 the countess of Banbury bore a son, Edward (1627&#150;1645), at Rotherfield Greys, the family's Oxfordshire home. A father at last at eighty-two, it is not surprising that two years later Banbury excused himself from attendance at parliament as &#145;old and lame and fit for no use, but attends his majesty and his friends with his prayers&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1629&#150;31</i>, 84). Banbury finally died, aged about eighty-seven, in Paternoster Row, London, on 25 May 1632. He was buried at Rotherfield Greys.<br>
<br>The succession to Banbury's title generated controversy for over two hundred years, a dispute whose origins lay in the mysterious paternity of the countess of Banbury's two sons, Edward and his younger brother, Nicholas, born in 1631. The countess gave birth to a daughter who died as an infant years before Edward was born, but until 1627, when she was over forty, there were no other children. It was unusual, though by no means unprecedented for a woman of her age to give birth. What raised suspicions about Edward and Nicholas was that the countess was openly involved with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28160/', "Edward Vaux, fourth Baron Vaux (1588&#150;1661)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28163/', "Vaux, Thomas, second Baron Vaux (1509&#150;1556)")</script>]. Banbury's will, dated 19 May 1630, left almost all of his estate to his wife, but made no mention of Edward, then three years old. Moreover, the countess married Vaux only about five weeks after her husband's death. Edward, a minor at the earl's death, was called earl of Banbury on 9 February 1641 in a suit in the court of chancery, but he never sat in the Lords; about June, 1645, he was murdered in a dispute while travelling in France, aged eighteen.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_15757"></a><span class="headword">Nicholas Knollys</span>, third earl of Banbury  (1631&#150;1674), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was born on 3 January 1631 at Harrowden, Vaux's Northamptonshire home. At fifteen he assumed the title as third earl of Banbury. He is referred to as Lord Banbury in a settlement made by Vaux in 1646, and it was as earl of Banbury that he petitioned Oliver Cromwell for permission to sell lands on 27 February 1655. By this time he was gaoled for debts amounting to &pound;10,000. His first wife, Isabella (<i>d</i>. 1655), daughter of Mountjoy Blount, first earl of Newport, and his wife, Anne, died shortly afterwards. On 4 October that year, at Stapleford, Leicestershire, he married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1680), daughter of William Sherard, first Baron Sherard, and his wife, Abigail, thus improving, at least temporarily, his financial position. This was enhanced further, when his mother died on 17 April 1658, freeing up the dower estate.<br>
<br>Banbury took his seat in the Lords during the Convention Parliament in 1660, where his attendance earned him a place on two committees&#151;but in July 1660 someone in the house challenged his legitimacy. Although the house ordered a hearing at the bar, it took no action. Banbury did not receive a summons to the Cavalier Parliament and in 1661 he petitioned Charles II for his writ. The king referred the petition to the Lords' committee of privileges, which in July 1661 resolved that Nicholas Knollys was the legitimate earl of Banbury. However, the full house refused to go along. While it is very probable that Nicholas's father was, in fact, Vaux, the Lords, in refusing to accept his legitimacy, was setting aside a long-honoured principle of the common law, which presumed that children born in wedlock were sired by their mother's husband. Banbury remained excluded from his seat, and in December 1661 a bill bastardizing him was read in the Lords, though it was never passed. The earl continued his efforts to regain his seat, petitioning the Lords and the king regularly. In August 1665 he disrupted the progress of James, duke of York, through Northamptonshire. After York declined an invitation to dine at Banbury's house, the earl stopped the royal carriage and &#145;laid hold of His Highness's leg and pulled so hard that he had almost drawn off his shoe&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1664&#150;5</i>, 498). Unfortunately these histrionics failed to advance Banbury's case, and he never again sat in the Lords. He died on 14 March 1674 at Boughton, Northamptonshire, and was buried there, leaving the struggle to his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15754/', "Charles Knollys, fourth earl of Banbury (bap. 1662, d. 1740)")</script>, and his descendants.<br>
