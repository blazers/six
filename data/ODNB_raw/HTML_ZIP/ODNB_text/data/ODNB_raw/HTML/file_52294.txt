<span class="headword">Miskin, Sir  James William</span>  (1925&#150;1993), <span class="occ">barrister and judge</span>, was born in Hong Kong on 11 March 1925, the son of Geoffrey Miskin, general manager of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, and his wife, Joyce. The Miskins were of Huguenot origin, and had settled in Kent. He was educated at Haileybury College before seeing war service as a sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. After demobilization in 1946 he went to Brasenose College, Oxford, where he was senior Heath Harrison exhibitioner, and from where he graduated with a second-class degree in jurisprudence in 1949. On 28 April 1951 he married Mollie Joan Milne (<i>b</i>. 1927/8), daughter of Eric Ivan Milne of Crowborough, Sussex. They had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1951, Miskin joined the south-eastern circuit, and developed a good common law practice, mainly civil, principally in family and medical negligence work. He so impressed Desmond Ackner that he was invited to join the latter's chambers. He was led by Ackner in a number of important cases, and was given a red bag by Ackner in recognition of his outstanding contribution as an advocate, &#145;the like of which [Ackner] had not seen&#146;  (private information). Thereafter his career progressed well. From 1964 to 1967 and from 1970 to 1973 he served on the bar council, including service on a committee looking at the position of women at the bar. He was made a queen's counsel in 1967. From 1968 to 1971 he was deputy chairman of the Hertfordshire quarter sessions, in 1972 he became a crown court recorder (a part-time post entailing four weeks on the bench yearly), and from 1974 to 1975 he was leader of the south-eastern circuit. He succeeded Ackner as counsel for the children in the thalidomide tragedy. In the end the case against Distillers did not come to trial but was settled, those acting for the victims taking the view that there was no more than a 40 per cent chance of success in an action for negligence.<br>
<br>In 1975, on the recommendation of Mr Justice Melford Stevenson, Miskin was appointed recorder of London, the senior judge at the central criminal court (the Old Bailey), and second citizen to the lord mayor. The appointment was something of a surprise as he had not been common serjeant, the deputy, and his practice had not been principally criminal. At the time it was believed in the profession that he was appointed in order to get the Old Bailey moving and to deal with complacency among those who regularly sat and practised there. He disliked waste of time and insisted that all courts start promptly at 10.30 a.m. With a considerable sense of humour, he was an outstanding after-dinner speaker and made many such speeches; indeed he was a sort of court jester for the City of London.<br>
<br>The office of recorder of London is very arduous, involving the trial of many very serious cases, including murder, manslaughter, rape, grievous bodily harm, and robbery; it also involves considerable administrative responsibilities. Miskin enjoyed a reputation for fair summings-up (&#145;straight down the middle&#146;) and was generally well thought of as a judge. Although he was outwardly tough in sentencing, it was said that his bark was worse than his bite; his sentencing, however, was often unpredictable and surprising. He was inconspicuously kind to young counsel.<br>
<br>Like many good lawyers, Miskin was not good at administering his own affairs. He ran into tax problems, and had to sell his house in Wimbledon, to the great disappointment of his wife, Mollie. Being so involved in all his various activities he neglected his wife and the first marriage broke up. He married second, on 6 December 1980, Sheila Joan Collett (<i>b</i>. 1927/8), a widow, and the daughter of Harold Radcliffe Scott, schoolmaster.<br>
<br>In his latter years on the bench Miskin's health declined, and he was reluctant to take medical advice; ill health converted his fine speaking voice to hoarseness, and he became known as &#145;Whispering Jim&#146;. He became increasingly indiscreet and open to criticism. He was sometimes difficult with counsel, expressed himself unnecessarily forcefully, and told convicted criminals what he thought of them. Publicly he made a number of trenchant remarks and criticisms; these may have been justified but they were imprudent, indeed unwise, in a judge in office. He wanted the minimum age for jurors raised to twenty-five, and wanted capital punishment for premeditated murder. He cast doubt upon the innocence of the Guildford four after their conviction was quashed. He made unfortunate remarks about ethnic minorities, referring to a black man as a &#145;nig-nog&#146;, and to &#145;murderous Sikhs&#146;. He wanted more money spent to increase the number of prison places. Some years previously he would have liked to move from the Old Bailey to the High Court, but consent from the lord chief justice was not forthcoming. The surprising deterioration in his personality and judicial performance was subsequently attributed to incipient, undiagnosed Alzheimer's disease, and a hitherto excellent reputation was spoilt.<br>
<br>Miskin was involved in many extra-judicial activities. A keen boxer in his youth, he was appeals steward for the British board of boxing control from 1972 to 1975. He was also chairman of the board of discipline of the London School of Economics (1972&#150;5), chairman of the inner London probation committee (1979&#150;88), a liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Furriers, an honorary liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Cutlers, and one of her majesty's lieutenants for the City of London (1976&#150;93). He retired from the bench in 1990, having been knighted in 1983. He died of bronchopneumonia and senile dementia at his home, 25 Collingwood Road, Horsham, Sussex, on 21 November 1993, and was survived by his second wife, Sheila, and the four children of his first marriage.<br>
