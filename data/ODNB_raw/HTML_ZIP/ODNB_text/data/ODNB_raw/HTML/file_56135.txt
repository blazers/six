<span class="headword">Crane, Sir  Edmund Frank</span>  (1886&#150;1957), <span class="occ">cycle manufacturer</span>, was born on 21 November 1886 at 55 Cape Hill, Smethwick, Birmingham, the eldest of two sons in a family of six children of Edward John Crane, then a clerk, and his wife, Edith Maude Willmott. He was educated at Handsworth grammar school and soon after leaving became involved in the family's cycle business. The Petros Motor and Cycle Company Ltd, registered in his mother's name owing to his father's earlier bankruptcy, came to prominence in the early years of the century producing bicycles at prices well below those of the established manufacturers. This enterprise foundered in the face of hostility in the trade and went into liquidation in 1910. Crane, along with his father and brother Harry, only narrowly escaped imprisonment for alleged attempts to defraud the creditors of the business the following year, but their sentences were dismissed on their appeal.<br>
<br>In 1910 Crane and Harry went into partnership and founded the Hercules Cycle and Motor Company Ltd with &pound;25 capital. Beginning with an output of twenty-five machines a week, assembled from bought-in components and targeted for sale in the Birmingham area, the company grew at a rapid rate. By 1922 output of cycles had reached 700 machines a week, and by 1928, 300,000 machines a year, of which over a third were exported. By 1933 the company had reached a total output of three million cycles, which it doubled by 1939, making it the largest cycle manufacturer in the world.<br>
<br>Crane's success lay in his commitment to produce a reliable and affordable bicycle, initially for lower-middle-class urban dwellers, and then for members of the working classes also. He placed great emphasis on the use of the bicycle for travelling to work rather than for weekend leisure usage, and the new inter-war housing estates, often ill served by public transport, provided a ready market. By a policy of scrupulously using the cheapest suppliers, and buying in bulk, the company drove down costs and where it was advantageous manufactured parts itself. Despite its name, the company remained highly specialized, did not enter the manufacture of motor vehicles, and did not contribute to innovations in bicycle design. In order to boost sales Crane spent considerable sums of money on advertising, particularly in newspapers, promoting cycling as a sport and in general, as well as making Hercules a household name. Crane married twice. His first marriage was on 22 May 1911 to a singer, Naomi, daughter of Samuel Tamkin, an artist from Edinburgh, with whom he had a daughter. The marriage was dissolved in 1938. His second marriage was on 10 August 1938 to Kathleen Margaret, daughter of Cecil Murray Wright, a soldier.<br>
<br>As a businessman Crane was single-minded and autocratic. This brought him into conflicts within the industry, where he was regarded as ruthless and unsympathetic to the trade's overall interest. Disagreements with the industry's trade association, the British Cycle and Motor Cycle Manufacturers' Trades Union Ltd, ultimately led to Crane withdrawing his company from it in 1933. In later years Crane delegated management of the works to trusted subordinates, while devoting more effort to strategic issues. He assumed complete financial control when he bought his brother Harry's share of the business following disagreements over the scale of the company's advertising. Although an attempt was made by Raleigh Cycle Holdings Ltd to effect a merger in 1935, with a highly advantageous offer alleged to have been &pound;2.5 million along with a place on the board of the proposed new company, Crane declined it, probably because he would have found loss of overall control unpalatable. In 1946 he nevertheless sold his business for &pound;3.25 million to Tube Investments. After only a few months on the board of that company Crane retired, initially to South Africa and later to Jersey, where he lived at Villa Millbrook, St Lawrence.<br>
<br>Crane's interests were golf and shooting and he was at one time a referee in amateur association football. His contributions to charitable works included donations towards the treatment of sufferers from tuberculosis. Although he did not enter political life at either local or national level, he made donations to the Conservative Party; for these public and political services, as well as for his company's export success, he received a knighthood in 1935. Crane died of heart failure on 18 September 1957 at Le M&eacute;ridien, avenue Docteur Raymond Picaud, La Bocca, Cannes, in the south of France.<br>
