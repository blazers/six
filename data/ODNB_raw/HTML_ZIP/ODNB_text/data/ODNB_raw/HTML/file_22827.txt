<span class="headword">Pritzler, Sir  Theophilus</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1839), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was in 1793 appointed ensign in an independent company in the British army, and on 18 March 1794 he became a lieutenant in the 85th foot. He exchanged, on 27 August 1794, into the 5th dragoon guards, went to the Netherlands, and served through the two unsuccessful campaigns of 1794 and 1795, in the Netherlands and Germany. He then took part in an expedition to San Domingo (1796&#150;8). On 21 September 1796 he transferred to the 21st light dragoons, in which regiment he remained until 21 September 1804, when he was appointed major in the Royal Fusiliers. He acted as major of brigade at Portsmouth from 1800 to 1804, and from 1807 to 1809 held the post of assistant adjutant-general at the Horse Guards. He received the brevet of lieutenant-colonel on 16 April 1807, and on 4 June 1813 was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the 22nd light dragoons. He had the brevet of colonel in the army on 4 June 1814.<br>
<br>Pritzler then went to India with his regiment. On the outbreak of the Third Anglo-Maratha War in 1817, he was given the rank of brigadier-general, and ordered to pursue the peshwa on the latter's flight from Poona on 16 November 1817. On 8 January 1818, with a force partly European and partly Indian, he came upon a large enemy force close to Satara, where they had been left to cover the peshwa's retreat. Pritzler attacked and dispersed them, and continued his pursuit, marching rapidly southwards in co-operation with Brigadier-General Smith. He came up with the peshwa's rearguard on 17 January, near Meritch, and severely defeated them.<br>
<br>Pritzler was for a time employed in the movement against the smaller fortresses in the southern Maratha districts. He was ordered to press the siege of Sinhgarh, which surrendered, after a short resistance, on 2 March 1818. He was then ordered to reduce to obedience the country in the vicinity of Satara. His chief achievement in this district was the capture of Vasota, a fort situated in an almost impregnable position of the Western Ghats. The siege began on 11 March, and ended in unconditional surrender on 5 April. Pritzler then marched south and joined Colonel Thomas Munro on 22 April at Nagar-Manawali. The united British force now moved across the Sena River to the siege of Sholapur, the peshwa's last great stronghold in the southern districts. On 10 May two columns, under Colonel Hewitt, advanced to the assault. Pritzler, with a reserve force, stood by to offer support. The Maratha commander, Ganpat Rao, moved round to the east side of the town with the object of taking the assailants in flank. The Marathas were checked and driven back in disorder by Pritzler, which contributed to the speedy capture of the town that day. The Maratha garrison, about 7000 strong, tried to escape. Pritzler, however, pursued, came up with them on the banks of the Sena, and inflicted upon them so crushing a defeat that they ceased to exist as an organized force. Pritzler was made a KCB on 3 December 1822. He died suddenly at Boulogne on 12 April 1839.<br>
