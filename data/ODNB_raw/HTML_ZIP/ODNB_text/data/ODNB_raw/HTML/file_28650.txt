<span class="headword">Walton,  Elijah</span>  (1832&#150;1880), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born on 22 November 1832 in Birmingham, the son of Elijah Samuel Walton and his wife, Mary Ann Lees. Walton's father was a tailor and his mother a straw bonnet maker, and money was scarce. However, he showed an early talent for art, and, aided most probably by a local benefactress, he studied at the School of Art in Birmingham. In 1851 he exhibited his first picture, a study of fruit, at the Royal Academy, and in July 1855 he became a student at the Royal Academy Schools. Although he exhibited genre paintings at the academy until 1859, he became interested in mountain scenery through copying pictures. About 1856 he went to Australia, where his elder brother had settled at Geelong, and he exhibited six works at the Mechanics' Institute there in 1857.<br>
<br>On 13 July 1860 Walton married Mary, the daughter of John Neale; their honeymoon was spent in Switzerland and Egypt, where Mary died. Walton travelled and painted in the Middle East until returning to London in spring 1862. Later in 1862 William Mathews, of Edgbaston, the founder of the Alpine Club, offered Walton a commission to travel to the Tarentaise Alps, and for the next five years he journeyed and painted in the Alps or in Egypt. In 1864 he exhibited at the Royal Academy <span class="italic">The Pyramids</span> and in 1865 <span class="italic">Tombs of the Sultans Near Cairo&#151;Sunset</span>, a huge oil painting now at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. Walton also exhibited at the British Institution and the Suffolk Street Galleries. The Victoria and Albert Museum has a collection of his watercolours of the Middle East, and the British Museum has six watercolours of mountain views. In some of these alpine watercolours there is a sharpness of outline delineating mountain peaks combined with a brilliancy of colour which has great vitality and freshness.<br>
<br>On 20 June 1867 Walton married Fanny Heyes Phipson, the daughter of John Phipson, a manufacturer. Walton's sketching tours became less frequent, although he visited Norway (with T. G. Bonney) in 1869, and continued to travel to the Alps. In 1870 he visited Greece. Like many Victorian artists, he became passionately interested in the nature he painted and how it was formed. He became a fellow of the Geological Society in March 1867 and of the Royal Historical Society in November 1872. In 1874 Walton exhibited at the Burlington Gallery, Piccadilly, London. He wrote and illustrated three books: <span class="italic">The Camel: its Anatomy, Proportion and Paces</span> (1865), <span class="italic">Clouds: their Forms and Combinations</span> (1868), and <span class="italic">Peaks in Pen and Pencil for Students of Alpine Scenery</span> (1872). The thoroughness of Walton's observation of the camel could, perhaps, compare with George Stubbs's on the horse in the previous century; his line drawings of the camel are in the Victoria and Albert Museum and Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. He also illustrated seven books by his friend T. G. Bonney, including <span class="italic">The Peaks and Valleys of the Alps</span> (1867), <span class="italic">The Coast of Norway</span> (1871), and <span class="italic">Welsh Scenery</span> (1875).<br>
<br>From 1856 to 1865 Walton lived at various addresses in London, and after his second marriage he lived at Staines and then Bromsgrove. He was said to have &#145;affected peculiar dress and ways, wearing his hair in little curls all over his head and a tunic of black velvet, with the sleeves slashed at the shoulders with some very bright colour&#146;  (Howard, 20). Fanny died on 7 December 1872 and Elijah Walton's health declined; he died at his home, Beacon Farm, Lickey, Bromsgrove, on 25 August 1880, leaving three sons. He was buried at Bromsgrove cemetery. Further collections of his watercolours are at Smith Art Gallery, Stirling, the Alpine Club, London, the Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery, and the Frenchay Museum, Bristol.<br>
