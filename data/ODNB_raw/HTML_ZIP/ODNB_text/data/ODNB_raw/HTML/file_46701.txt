<span class="headword">Constance</span>, duchess of Brittany  (<em>c.</em>1161&#150;1201), <span class="occ"></span>was the only daughter and sole heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59576/', "Conan (IV), duke of Brittany (c.1135&#150;1171)")</script>, and Margaret, daughter of Henry, earl of Huntingdon (<i>d</i>. 1152), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50012/', "Ada de Warenne (d. 1178)")</script>, and sister to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17860/', "Malcolm IV")</script> (<i>r</i>. 1153&#150;65) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29452/', "William I")</script> (<i>r</i>. 1165&#150;1214), kings of Scotland. Her parents married in 1160 and Constance is first mentioned in 1166 as a young child, when Conan was persuaded by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12949/', "Henry II")</script> to betroth her to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10533/', "Geoffrey")</script>, the fourth son of his marriage to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8618/', "Eleanor of Aquitaine")</script>. The subordination of the native Breton ruling dynasty to their powerful Plantagenet neighbours, symbolized by this act, provides the background to Constance's own life: it shaped her personal destiny and that of her children, and radically affected the political history of Brittany and the Angevin empire as a whole.<br>
<br>After Conan (IV)'s death in 1171 Henry II further tightened his hold on Brittany. Conan's widow married Humphrey (III) de Bohun, hereditary constable of England. It is likely that Constance accompanied her mother to England, where Margaret had dower lands, and Constance's claims as countess of Richmond were eventually acknowledged by the king. After the constable's death (1185) mother and daughter remained close; Margaret is found on at least one occasion with Constance in Brittany, where she died early in 1201; she was buried, according to her wishes, at Sawtry Abbey, Huntingdonshire. But little is definitely known of Constance's movements or whereabouts before her marriage to Geoffrey was finally celebrated in 1181; during their betrothal, although Geoffrey was occasionally to be found in Brittany, usually after being dispatched by Henry II, the duchy was administered almost entirely by men nominated by the English king, with only the barest reference to the young duchess or her rights.<br>
<br>Matters changed when Constance and Geoffrey married. Until Geoffrey's premature death in August 1186 Constance was frequently at her husband's side, both within and outside the duchy. She was actively associated in his government of Brittany at a critical moment in the duchy's institutional and legal development. Together they also made benefactions to several Breton abbeys (among them Beaulieu, Boquen, and Bonrepos), as well as a grant to Rouen Cathedral in memory of Geoffrey's eldest brother, Henry, the Young King (<i>d</i>. 1183). Constance also patronized Sainte Croix de Quimperl&eacute;. Two daughters were born during Geoffrey's lifetime: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46702/', "Eleanor (d. 1241)")</script> and Matilda (<i>d</i>. before 1189), while at Easter 1187 (29 March) Constance gave birth to a posthumous son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/704/', "Arthur")</script>, for whom high hopes were entertained by Bretons chafing at Angevin domination.<br>
<br>On Geoffrey's death, although Constance assumed control of the duchy, it was under the continuing supervision of Henry II, at whose command in February 1189 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2716/', "Ranulf (III), sixth earl of Chester (d. 1232)")</script>. In contrast to her first marriage, this appears to have been an unhappy and loveless affair; Constance and Ranulf seldom kept each other's company, no children were born, and the major incident in the marriage was Ranulf's seizure of his wife at Pontorson in 1196, while on her way to Normandy for an interview with Richard I, and her subsequent imprisonment in his castle at St James de Beuvron. His part in this ploy can be surmised since, as king, Richard had also been very anxious to continue the tradition of Plantagenet control of Brittany. In 1190 he acknowledged his nephew, Arthur, as his own heir in the treaty of Messina negotiated with Tancred of Sicily, and he tried to smother dissension among Breton nobles anxious to shake off his authority. Some, appointed by Constance to high positions in the Breton administration or as members of her council, also served Richard in a similar capacity. But disputes continued and tension remained high; soon after returning from captivity in Austria (1194), Richard invaded Brittany in force, further alienating many Bretons by his aggression. Ranulf's capture of Constance exacerbated matters still more, while her subsequent escape from confinement gave rise to many legends.<br>
<br>By 1198 peaceful relations with Richard I had once again been restored, following complex negotiations which can only be traced with great difficulty through not entirely trustworthy later sources, which apparently paraphrase contemporary records. But both Constance and Ranulf were anxious to end their marriage and it was annulled (probably in 1199). The death of Richard I, on 6 April 1199, the claims of Arthur to the Angevin succession, and his rivalry with John, opened a final dramatic chapter in Constance's life. Initially she was closely involved in the military and diplomatic moves of Arthur and his supporters to implement his claims to the Angevin succession. She was with him at Angers in April 1199 after an invasion of Anjou, and accompanied him to Le Mans shortly afterwards to seek the support of the barons of Maine. Her role as Arthur's &#145;councillor&#146; is acknowledged in several charters from this period.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1199 Constance married Gui de Thouars, younger brother of Aimery, vicomte de Thouars, a move probably designed to widen her political contacts, but which also brought her considerable personal happiness. She also sought help for Arthur at Tours from Philip Augustus, king of France. However, domestic matters increasingly claimed her attention: three more daughters were born in quick succession&#151;Alix (later duchess of Brittany), Marguerite, and Catherine&#151;and Constance gradually withdrew from active politics. The treaty of Le Goulet (22 May 1200), by which Philip reserved Arthur's wardship, while stipulating that he must perform homage for Brittany to King John, represented a severe setback for the policies Constance and her supporters had been pursuing. Moreover, by summer 1201, Constance was ailing; some contemporary sources claim she had contracted leprosy, though it is more probable that recent pregnancies had undermined her constitution. She died in early September 1201, and was buried in the Cistercian abbey of Villeneuve (diocese of Nantes) which had been refounded in 1200 through her generous endowment.<br>
