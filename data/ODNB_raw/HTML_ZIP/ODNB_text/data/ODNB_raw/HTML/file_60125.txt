<span class="headword">Fryon <span class="st"> [Frion]</span>,  &Eacute;tienne <span class="st"> [Stephen]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em>1462&#150;1501), <span class="occ">diplomat and spy</span>, was a Burgundian whose precise origin and education remain obscure. By 1462 he was practising as a <i>procureur</i> of the <i>grand conseil</i> of Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, and by 1466 was a ducal secretary. He moved to the service of Burgundy's ally, Charles, duke of Guyenne, until Charles's death in 1472, whereupon he returned to the Burgundian secretariat and served until 1480 without obtaining senior rank.<br>
<br>On the death of Duke Charles the Bold in 1477 Louis XI of France had overrun Burgundy's southern heartlands, and the Duchess Marie, Charles's daughter, required Edward IV's military support if she was to defend Burgundian territories in the Netherlands and north-east France against Louis's encroachments. In 1480 Edward's sister Margaret, dowager duchess of Burgundy, led an embassy to England which offered a marriage alliance between Mary's infant heir, Philip, and Edward's daughter Anne. Fryon accompanied Jean Gros, treasurer of the Golden Fleece, on a preparatory mission and then on Margaret's embassy. Margaret, observing that the office of French secretary to Edward was effectively vacant, apparently recommended Fryon for this position. He was appointed on 26 September; yet within a month he was sending back to Gros a detailed intelligence letter disclosing information about England's parallel negotiations with Louis, scarcely compatible with his new official responsibilities.<br>
<br>Nevertheless Fryon's ability was valued by his English employers. In 1482 he was sent on a mission to Fran&ccedil;ois (II), duke of Brittany, and he was reappointed to his position by Richard III and Henry VII. In 1486 he was granted a valuable property in the parish of St Giles Cripplegate, London, confiscated from Humphrey Stafford after his rebellion. In December 1488, now described as a councillor, he was an envoy to Charles VIII of France, in the company of Christopher Urswick and Thomas Ward. Henry sent him again in September 1489, with Sir John Risley and Chester herald; but this time he took the opportunity to defect to French service.<br>
<br>Late in 1491 Charles VIII sent Fryon to Cork to meet the leaders of the Yorkist conspiracy forming around Perkin Warbeck, who had recently assumed the identity of Richard, duke of York, and to invite Warbeck to take up residence at the French court. Warbeck was in fact the son of a boatman from Tournai. Whatever he had already learned, in Portugal, of the Yorkist court from Duarte Brand&atilde;o (who had taken English nationality and served Edward IV as Sir Edward Brampton), he doubtless derived from Fryon in 1492 much of the inside knowledge he required to become a convincing impersonator. But in November 1492 Charles VIII came to terms with Henry VII at the treaty of &Eacute;taples and could no longer harbour Warbeck at court; so he secretly passed him to the custody of Margaret of York in Flanders.<br>
<br>Fryon was assumed by Sir Francis Bacon to have continued after this as Warbeck's &#145;principal counsellor&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Francis Bacon</span>, 6.138), but the evidence is lacking. He failed to gain entrance to the Paris <i>chambre des comptes</i> and in 1501 suffered imprisonment at the hands of the <i>pr&eacute;v&ocirc;t</i> of Paris; but he was released on appeal. He was active as a <i>procureur</i> in the <i>parlement</i> of Paris probably as late as 1509.<br>
<br>The circumstances of Fryon's appointment in 1480 and the nature of his intelligence about the diplomatic activity of the Archduke Maximilian, as well as Louis XI, imply that he was then a member of Margaret of York's circle. If this allegiance continued, it would support the story of Henry VII's propagandist Bernard Andr&eacute; that Margaret was the instigator of Warbeck's conspiracy&#151;with Fryon as her agent&#151;as well as his principal backer after 1492. But ostensibly Fryon cut his links with Burgundy and with Margaret. His defection to France must be seen in the context of those of more senior Burgundian officials in the 1480s, including Jean Gros and Guillaume de Rochefort; equally, his intelligence activity appears symptomatic of an era in international relations when &#145;diplomat&#146; and &#145;spy&#146; were regarded as opposite sides of the same coin. Nevertheless, Bacon's sketch of Fryon as &#145;an active man, but turbulent and discontented&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Francis Bacon</span>, 6.137) remains entirely apposite.<br>
