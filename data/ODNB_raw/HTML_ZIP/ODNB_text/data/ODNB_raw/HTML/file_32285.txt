<span class="headword">Capper, Sir  Thompson</span>  (1863&#150;1915), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Lucknow, India, on 20 October 1863. He was the third son of William Copeland Capper of the Bengal civil service and his wife, Sarah, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6260/', "William Taylor Copeland")</script>. His older brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41054/', "Sir John Capper")</script>. Thompson Capper was commissioned lieutenant in the East Lancashire regiment on 9 September 1882, and was promoted captain on 22 April 1891. He served in the Chitral relief expedition in 1895 and attended the Staff College at Camberley in 1896&#150;7, where he was regarded as an original and imaginative student. He then served with the Egyptian army in the Sudan from December 1897 to July 1899, being present at the battles of the Atbara and Omdurman. Capper received a brevet majority on 16 November 1898. After a brief attachment to the War Office as staff captain for intelligence, Capper went to South Africa in November 1899 as deputy assistant adjutant-general on the staff of the Natal army during the operations for the relief of Ladysmith and the subsequent advance into the Transvaal. From June 1901 to May 1902 he commanded a mobile column in Cape Colony. For his services he received the DSO and was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel on 29 November 1900.<br>
<br>Capper's next employment was as professor and then deputy assistant adjutant-general at the Staff College from December 1902 to December 1905, in the course of which he received a brevet colonelcy in December 1904. It would appear that Sir Henry Hughes Wilson feared that Capper rather than himself would succeed to the command at Camberley and, at Wilson's suggestion, Capper was then selected first commandant of the Indian Staff College at Quetta, a position he held from March 1906 with the rank of colonel, and from May 1906 to January 1911 as temporary brigadier-general. In his teaching at Camberley, and especially at Quetta, where he lectured extensively on the Russo-Japanese War, Capper was a powerful exponent of the &#145;offensive spirit&#146;, arguing that &#145;attacking dash&#146; was the best means of overcoming entrenched positions defended by modern firepower. He thus placed particular emphasis on courage. A fellow instructor at Camberley, Hubert Gough, recalled that Capper &#145;always inculcated a spirit of self-sacrifice and duty, instead of the idea of playing for safety and seeking only to avoid getting into trouble&#146;  (Gough, 93). Similarly John Charteris recorded during the first battle of Ypres that Capper told him, &#145;No good officer has a right to be alive during a fight like this&#146;, and that Capper had also supposedly ordered his staff to the front with the words, &#145;What! Nobody on the Staff wounded today; that won't do!&#146;  (Charteris, 58). It is difficult to assess Capper's precise influence on his audiences, and Douglas Haig, who came into contact with him at Quetta, believed Capper &#145;too full of nerves and too much of a crank to get the best out of officers&#146;  (Haig to Kiggell, Kiggell MSS, 1/27, 22 Oct 1911), while George Barrow also considered that the geniality that had marked Capper's personality at Camberley had given way to a darker intensity of outlook at Quetta.<br>
<br>On 15 October 1908 Capper married Winifride Mary, the eldest daughter of the Hon. Robert Joseph Gerard-Dicconson of Wrightington Hall, Wigan; they had one son. Two years later he received the CB, and after a brief period of half pay he was appointed to command the 13th infantry brigade at Dublin on 19 February 1911. Capper's abilities as a trainer of troops were much in evidence, and he was appointed inspector of infantry in February 1914, and promoted major-general on 12 May. He had strongly supported Hubert Gough during the Curragh incident in March. On 27 August 1914 he was appointed to command the 7th division, and he took it to Belgium in October. Capper covered the Belgian retreat to the Yser and then took a leading role in the first battle of Ypres, his division losing over 10,000 of its infantry in just three weeks but holding its ground. One obituarist later commented that &#145;no one but Capper himself could, night after night, by the sheer force of his personality, have reconstituted from the shattered fragments of battalions a fighting line that could last through tomorrow&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 Oct 1915).<br>
<br>Capper was created KCMG for his services at Ypres but was accidentally wounded during experiments with hand grenades in April 1915 and did not return to his division until shortly before the battle of Loos. Indeed Capper had been appointed to a corps but received permission to remain with his division until after the battle. On 25 September 1915 the division took its first objectives but was heavily counter-attacked. Accounts vary as to whether Capper was trying to encourage his men or to urge forward a &#145;sticky&#146; unit and whether or not he was riding his horse in full view of the enemy. He was hit by a sniper and died on the following day, 26 September 1915. He was buried in Lillers communal cemetery, Pas-de-Calais.<br>
<br>Capper had been true to the principles he had set out in one of his lectures in June 1908: that wars could not be won &#145;unless the individuals composing an army set out to fight with the determined spirit that they will conquer, or they will die in the attempt to do so&#146;  (Capper MSS, II/4/16).<br>
