<span class="headword">Balliol,  Bernard  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1190), <span class="occ">baron</span>, referred to as &#145;junior&#146; in the Durham <span class="italic">Liber vitae</span>, was probably the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1204/', "Bernard de Balliol &#145;senior&#146;")</script>, and succeeded his elder brother, Guy, in the early 1160s, certainly by 1167. He is best known for his part in the events surrounding the capture of William the Lion, king of Scots, at Alnwick in 1174, an action for which he was singled out for praise by some chroniclers. He was <i>vir nobilis atque magnanimus</i> (&#145;an honorable and magnanimous man&#146;) according to William of Newburgh, and a <i>seur chevalier</i> (&#145;trustworthy knight&#146;) to Jordan Fantosme, conventional terms of praise perhaps but sufficient to delineate a strength of character in this, one of the few ascertainable details of his public life.<br>
<br>Balliol's wife was Agnes de Picquigny, who was probably of the family of the <i>vidames</i> of that name, French royal officials and territorial lords of Picquigny, which was no great distance from Bailleul-en-Vimeu. There is, however, no evidence to connect her and her family with the Pinkenys, <span class="roman">Domesday</span> tenants on the honour of Huntingdon who also originated from Picquigny. Despite unfounded statements to the contrary, Bernard de Balliol had no children, certainly none that survived long enough to find their way into written record. His last datable act was a final concord with the bishop of Durham in the court of Richard I at Dover in early December 1189, and he was succeeded during 1190 by his cousin, Eustace de Helicourt, who assumed the Balliol patronymic and remarried in that year. His sons, also listed in the <span class="italic">Liber vitae</span>, were Hugh, Ingram (or Ingelram), Bernard, and Henry: Ingram and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1207/', "Henry de Balliol")</script> established cadet branches in Scotland at Inverkeilor and Cavers respectively; Hugh, who had probably succeeded his father about 1209, and Bernard were conspicuous members of the group of northern English barons who were staunch supporters of King John. Hugh's own son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1208/', "John de Balliol")</script>, possibly even named after the king, acquired Scottish interests through marriage to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49378/', "Dervorguilla de Balliol")</script>, and his grandson, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1209/', "John (c.1248x50&#150;1314)")</script>, became king of Scots (1292&#150;6).<br>
