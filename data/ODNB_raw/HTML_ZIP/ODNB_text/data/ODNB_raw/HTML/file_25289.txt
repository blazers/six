<span class="headword">Sheepshanks,  John</span>  (1787&#150;1863), <span class="occ">art collector and patron</span>, was born in Leeds, where his father, Joseph Sheepshanks, was a wealthy cloth manufacturer. His mother was Anne Wilson of a Westmorland family; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25290/', "Richard Sheepshanks (1794&#150;1855)")</script>, the well-known astronomer, was his younger brother. John Sheepshanks retired before the age of forty, until which time he was a partner in his father's firm of York and Sheepshanks.<br>
<br>While still in business, Sheepshanks had developed a taste for collecting. He started by acquiring books and Flemish and Dutch prints, and proceeded to collecting copies of Italian old masters. Moving to London on his retirement, he turned his attention to promoting and encouraging contemporary British artists. Generally commissioning directly from artists, he built up a collection, largely of genre paintings: among the artists represented were Turner, Constable, Edwin Landseer, John Linnell, William Mulready, C. R. Leslie, David Roberts, Clarkson Stanfield, David Wilkie, Thomas Creswick, R. P. Bonington, John Crome, and Alexander Nasmyth. Sheepshanks's collection was unique at the time, the only other large-scale collection of contemporary British art being that of Robert Vernon (who, however, also bought British old masters such as Reynolds and Gainsborough).<br>
<br>Vernon's collection had been given to the nation in 1847, and in 1857 Sheepshanks followed suit, offering his 233 paintings in oil and 289 drawings and sketches as a gift to form the nucleus of a national gallery of British art. The deed of gift was framed with a view to rendering the pictures a source of education to the rising generation of artists, and with this intention they were placed with the South Kensington Museum. The galleries built to house them&#151;which opened on 20 June 1857&#151;were the first permanent buildings on this site. In a truly altruistic spirit, Sheepshanks stated that it was not his desire that his collection &#145;be kept apart or bear his name as such&#146;; however, the paintings have generally remained together and the collection has always been distinguished by the name of the donor. Sheepshanks added a notable proviso to his deed of gift, calling for Sunday afternoon openings as soon as possible. This provision was first carried out in 1896.<br>
<br>Sheepshanks moved to Hastings about 1833, and then to Blackheath, where he devoted himself to horticulture, becoming a fellow of the Royal Horticultural Society. He was of a retiring and unostentatious disposition, but his house was the resort of artists and literary figures. He died, unmarried, on 5 October 1863, at 24 Rutland Gate, London, where he had lived since 1842.<br>
