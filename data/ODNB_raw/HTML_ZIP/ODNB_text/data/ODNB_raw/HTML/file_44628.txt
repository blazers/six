<span class="headword">Lienhardt,  (Ronald) Godfrey</span>  (1921&#150;1993), <span class="occ">anthropologist</span>, was born on 17 January 1921 at 19 Fernbank Road, Bradford, Yorkshire, the elder of the two sons of Godfrey Lienhardt, a textile merchant from Switzerland, and his Yorkshire wife, Jennie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Benn. He was educated at Eastborough council school, Dewsbury, and Batley grammar school. In 1939 he went up to Downing College, Cambridge, on an open major scholarship to read English; his tutor there was F. R. Leavis, who was to have a lifetime influence on him. Having obtained a first in part 1 of the tripos, Lienhardt joined the Royal Army Ordnance Corps in 1941 and was appointed an army driving instructor (despite not being able to drive). In March 1943 he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Army Service Corps and posted to east Africa.<br>
<br>Lienhardt returned to Downing College in 1945 and read for the archaeological and anthropological tripos, in which he achieved first-class honours (with distinction) in 1947. Between 1947 and 1950 he carried out fieldwork among the Dinka of Sudan. In 1948 he migrated to Oxford, following his friend and colleague Edward Evans-Pritchard, to become a graduate student at Exeter College. The following year he was appointed research lecturer (later lecturer and then, in 1955, senior lecturer) in African sociology. He obtained his doctorate in 1952 and then conducted further research in Sudan among the Anuak in 1952&#150;4. In the academic year 1955/6 he received leave from Oxford to help set up a department of sociology and social anthropology at the college of arts and sciences in Baghdad and in 1964 he was visiting professor at the University of Ghana in Accra. In 1967 he was elected to a governing body fellowship of the recently founded Wolfson College, of which he was vicegerent in 1973&#150;5. In 1972 he was appointed to an <i>ad hominem</i> readership in social anthropology and in 1983 he received an honorary DLitt from Northwestern University, Illinois. He acted as external examiner for universities in both Britain and Africa, and between 1968 and 1976 was chief examiner in social anthropology for the international baccalaureate. He retired in 1988, when he became an emeritus reader of Oxford University and an emeritus fellow of Wolfson College.<br>
<br>Although Lienhardt published extensively, his anthropological reputation was above all made by <span class="italic">Divinity and Experience: the Religion of the Dinka</span> (1961). This book was immediately heralded as a masterful and outstanding contribution both to African ethnography and to the anthropological study of religion, and quickly took on the status of a classic work. He also wrote a highly successful textbook, <span class="italic">Social Anthropology</span> (1964), which was translated into Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Italian, and Greek. His earliest publications, dating back to 1941, were mainly literary in nature and were published in <span class="italic">Scrutiny</span>. From 1949, however, anthropology became the subject matter and his articles appeared in such academic journals as <span class="italic">Africa</span>. As well as his scholarly publications he gave a number of radio talks, many of which were subsequently published in <span class="italic">The Listener</span>. He was also invited to give numerous public lectures, including the Malinowksi memorial lecture in 1961, the Spalding memorial lecture in 1969, and the Frazer lecture in Cambridge in 1992, the year before his death. This last was on Sir James Frazer himself, in whom he had had a long interest.<br>
<br>Lienhardt never married. However, his generous and sociable character was such as to attract a large circle of devoted friends. Many of these were present and former students, because for Lienhardt his tutorial duties were a lifetime commitment. Those who gathered round him for a drink came, however, from a much wider variety of backgrounds and countries, and people from all over the world came to visit him in Oxford. Indeed Lienhardt, who was of frail appearance, particularly during his last years, and by no means tall, was a memorable sight as he walked through Oxford surrounded by towering Dinka. He was a delightful and amusing raconteur but, as is often the case with such people, his wit was occasionally at other people's expense.<br>
<br>It is probable that Lienhardt was converted to Roman Catholicism while at Cambridge. If in his later life his practice fell away his faith did not, and one of his last requests was for a requiem mass. He died from bronchopneumonia at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, on 9 November 1993 and was cremated at Oxford crematorium on 16 November after a mass in St Aloysius's.<br>

<a name="cosubject_70590"></a><span class="headword">Peter Arnold Lienhardt</span>  (1928&#150;1986), <span class="occ">anthropologist</span>, followed in his elder brother's footsteps. After taking a first in English and oriental languages at Downing College, Cambridge (1946&#150;9), he did two years' national service (1950&#150;52) in the Royal Air Force. He went up to Lincoln College, Oxford, as a graduate student in 1952, did fieldwork in the Gulf states, and obtained his doctorate in 1957. In 1957&#150;60 he was senior research fellow at the East African Institute for Social Research at Makerere College, Uganda, during which time he carried out research in Zanzibar. During 1960&#150;62 he was a research fellow at St Antony's College, Oxford (and briefly adviser to the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Shakhbut bin Sultan), and in the latter year was appointed to a faculty lecturership in Middle Eastern sociology at Oxford's Institute of Social Anthropology. He undertook a further period of field research in Iran in 1965&#150;6. He died, unmarried, on 17 March 1986.<br>
