<span class="headword">Clark, Sir  Wilfrid Edward Le Gros</span>  (1895&#150;1971), <span class="occ">anatomist</span>, was born in Hemel Hempstead on 5 June 1895, the youngest of three sons and third of the four children of the Revd (Edward) Travers Clark, of Washfield, near Tiverton, and his wife, Ethel May, daughter of Edward Clapton, physician. His eldest brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30932/', "Frederick Le Gros Clark")</script>. After the death of his mother when he was eight years old he became a delicate child, developing a bad stammer, which he overcame in later life with the help of psychoanalysis. He attended Blundell's School in Tiverton, and in 1912 entered the medical school of St Thomas's Hospital, on whose consultant staff both his grandfathers had served with distinction. His paternal grandfather (Frederick Le Gros Clark) had also been president of the Royal College of Surgeons. Qualifying MRCS, LRCP in 1916, Clark immediately joined the Royal Army Medical Corps and served in France from the beginning of 1918. He was demobilized in 1919 and, having passed the FRCS examination, was appointed a year later principal medical officer in Sarawak, a post which he filled for three years. In addition to discharging his medical duties, he was able to cultivate a deep-seated interest in natural history. He got on well with the indigenous population and, because of his success in treating ulcerous yaws, was made a fellow member of the Sea Dyaks, whose tattoo marks he bore on his shoulders. In 1923 he married Freda Constance (<i>d</i>. 1963), daughter of Frederick Giddey, shipping agent; they had two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1924 Clark left Borneo to become head of the department of anatomy at St Bartholomew's Hospital medical school, first as university reader and then from 1927 to 1929 as professor. In 1930 he succeeded to the chair of anatomy at St Thomas's Hospital medical school. Four years later he was appointed Dr Lee's professor of anatomy in Oxford, a post he occupied until his retirement in 1962.<br>
<br>Clark's scientific work reflected the main interests of the anatomical profession during the 1920s and 1930s, and in particular the relationship of humans to other primates. In Borneo he collected specimens of the spectral tarsier (<i>Tarsius</i>) and the tree shrew (<i>Tupaia</i> and <i>Ptilocercus</i>), two creatures whose evolutionary affinities were at the time much disputed. His specimens of <i>Tarsius</i> were studied anatomically by H. H. Woollard, and it is generally accepted that this creature represents a surviving group of the primitive mammals of the Eocene period from which all other primates evolved. Clark made a corresponding study of the tree shrew, which he also regarded as a primitive primate. His investigations of the structure of its brain marked the beginning of a long series of valuable studies of the central nervous pathways of the visual and other senses.<br>
<br>In 1934 Clark published his first book on the subject of human evolution, <span class="italic">Early Forerunners of Man</span>, essentially a compilation of existing knowledge of the anatomy of living and fossil primates. After a visit to South Africa in 1946 he became persuaded that the australopithecines, the ape-like fossils which had been unearthed in that country during the 1920s and 1930s, were in the direct line of human descent. He expounded his views on the subject in some six short books, as well as in a popular British Museum handbook <span class="italic">History of the Primates</span> (1949).<br>
<br>Clark played a part in the exposure of the Piltdown forgery, to which his attention was drawn by J. S. Weiner; with Weiner and K. P. Oakley, he published the results of this inquiry in the <span class="italic">Bulletin of the British Museum (Natural History)</span> (1953). He also wrote numerous papers for scientific journals, two general books on the structure and tissues of the body, and an autobiographical memoir, <span class="italic">Chant of Pleasant Exploration</span> (1968). He was elected FRS in 1935, knighted in 1955, received several honorary degrees, and was an honorary member of various foreign academies. He was president in 1950 of the International Anatomical Congress, in 1952&#150;3 of the Anatomical Society, and in 1961 of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He became an honorary fellow of Hertford College, Oxford, in 1962. Clark's first wife died in 1963, and in 1964 he married Violet, widow of Leonard Foster Browne, psychiatrist, and daughter of the Revd Richard Bott, vicar of Newlands, Keswick.<br>
<br>Clark was a complex and contradictory character. To many he showed kindness and generosity; to some he was a kind of father figure; to others he appeared cold, reserved, and changeable. He wanted to be admired, and it rankled when some whose esteem he sought, denied it  (Zuckerman, 225). Clark died on 28 June 1971, while staying with friends in Burton Bradstock in Dorset.<br>
