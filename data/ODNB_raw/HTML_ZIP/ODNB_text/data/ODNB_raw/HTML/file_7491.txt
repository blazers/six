<span class="headword">Denison,  William Joseph</span>  (1770&#150;1849), <span class="occ">banker and politician</span>, was born in Prince's Street, Lothbury, London, in May 1770, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49178/', "Joseph Denison (c.1726&#150;1806)")</script>, a cloth merchant and banker of St Mary Axe, London, and Denbies, near Dorking, Surrey, and his wife, Elizabeth (1738/9&#150;1771), daughter of William Butler, a hat maker of Tooley Street, Southwark. Denison's paternal grandfather had been a woollen cloth maker and dissenter in Leeds, and his father had amassed a considerable fortune in London, purchasing, in 1787, the Denbies estate in Surrey from Lord King, and also the Seamore estate, near Scarborough, from the duke of Leeds for &pound;100,000. Little is known of Denison's early life. He spent his business career in his father's bank, Denison, Heywood, and Kennard of Lombard Street, becoming senior partner upon his father's death. The bank, which dealt in both domestic and foreign loans, prospered exceedingly under his direction, and Denison was probably among the eight or ten wealthiest British businessmen at the time of his death.<br>
<br>Upon the advice of George Rose, the MP and Pittite minister, Denison entered parliament, successfully contesting Camelford in 1796, and holding the seat until 1802. After unsuccessfully contesting Hull in 1802, he was elected for this seat in 1806, but failed to stand at the 1807 election. He was elected for Surrey in 1818, remaining its member until 1832; after the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> he was elected for Surrey West, holding the seat until his death. He was thus a member of parliament for thirty-eight years. Although a keen supporter of Pitt recommended his entry into politics, Denison was, from the first, a staunch whig, joining Brooks's Club in 1797 and speaking regularly on behalf of the whig opposition in parliament. Denison was a strong supporter of parliamentary reform, voting in its favour in 1797 and subsequently. He was, however, opposed to the repeal of the corn laws in 1846. Denison was one of the founders of the Reform Club, and his portrait occupies a prominent place in the club's main room.<br>
<br>Denison also became a major landowner in Yorkshire and Surrey. He served as a lieutenant in the Middlesex Volunteers and, in 1808&#150;9, as high sheriff of Yorkshire; he was a patron of two livings. In 1794 Denison's sister Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1861) married Henry Conyngham, third Baron and first Marquess Conyngham. Owing to the influence of his sister, a friend of George IV, Denison was offered&#151;and declined&#151;a peerage at some time in the 1820s.<br>
<br>Denison left the whole of his fortune, estimated by contemporaries at &pound;2.3 million, to his nephew Lord Albert Conyngham (1805&#150;1860) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7485/', "Denison, Albert, first Baron Londesborough")</script>], the second surviving son of the first Marquess Conyngham, on the condition that he alter his name to Denison. Although the younger son of an aristocrat could normally expect neither title nor estate, through this highly unusual arrangement Denison's nephew received both. In 1850 he was created Baron Londesborough, and he used his inherited wealth to add substantially to the landed acreage he inherited from his uncle. In 1883 the second Baron Londesborough owned nearly 53,000 acres in Yorkshire, worth &pound;68,000 per annum in rental income, one of the very greatest examples of the use of business wealth to purchase land on a grand scale in modern British history.<br>
<br>Denison, who was unmarried, died at his home at 90 Pall Mall on 2 August 1849. He was the author of a patriotic poem on Napoleon's threatened invasion of 1803.<br>
