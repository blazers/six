<span class="headword">Crisp,  (Charles) Birch</span>  (1867&#150;1958), <span class="occ">financier</span>, was born on 5 September 1867 at Dove Street, Bristol, the son of Charles Birch Crisp, common-law clerk, and his second wife, Clara Isabella, daughter of James Peterkin, solicitor. His paternal grandfather, Charles Crisp, was a corn merchant. He was raised in Bristol and initially worked as a journalist. He was a newspaper manager in London by 1893, the year in which he married Beatrice Marion, daughter of Edwin Chapple. They had at least two sons, Charles Birch and Christopher Norman Birch, and at least one daughter, Phyllis Crowhurst, later Mrs Archer. He was a self-styled &#145;Tory Democrat&#146; who stood unsuccessfully as Unionist candidate at Oldham in the general elections of 1900 and 1906.<br>
<br>Known usually as Birch Crisp, he became a member of the London stock exchange in 1897, and was active as a company promoter for several years. His most important domestic transaction was the acquisition in 1917 of the Siemens electrical factory at Stafford, which had been confiscated from German ownership under the trading with the enemy acts. Crisp and his long-term associate Almeric Paget MP (created Lord Queenborough in 1918) superintended an elaborate capital reconstruction of Siemens, which was merged with the English Electric Company in 1919.<br>
<br>Crisp had ambitions as an international financier. After visiting St Petersburg in 1909, he was instrumental in placing on the London market &pound;3.5 million of railway bonds, and he made contacts at this time with other financiers interested in Russia. He became chairman in 1910 of the Anglo-Russian Trust which had a 30 per cent holding in the Russian Commercial and Industrial Bank (Russki Torgovi Promishlenni Bank), of which he also became London director. In 1911 he launched the Anglo-Russian Bank, the name of which was changed to the British Bank for Foreign Trade (BBFT) in 1912; he was its chairman until 1927. He intended his BBFT to imitate the French and German practice of making &#145;tied loans&#146; whereby in return for British investment the Russians would place industrial orders in Britain. Between 1908 and 1914 Crisp's banking interests placed &pound;20 million of Russian bonds and other securities in London, and at the outbreak of the world war BBFT held over &pound;1 million of Russian government and municipal bonds.<br>
<br>In 1910 an international consortium of bankers, supported by their respective governments, had agreed a system to regulate the haphazardly expanding indebtedness of the Chinese government. The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank was initially the sole British bank in this concern until Barings joined in 1912, and the consortium enjoyed the British government's exclusive support. Crisp however assailed this monopoly with a syndicate which in 1912 agreed to loan &pound;10 million to China in defiance of consortium policy. After public acrimony and Foreign Office hindrance of the flotation of the first instalment of &pound;5 million, the Chinese paid &pound;150,000 to Crisp for surrendering his right to issue a second instalment and for waiving his option to handle a &pound;25 million reorganization loan. He thus received &pound;150,000 of the loan's proceeds for the privilege of breaking his own contractual obligations. Crisp made other attempts to break the consortium policy, notably in 1918 when he organized the so-called Marconi loan of &pound;600,000 to be spent on erecting wireless stations. The Chinese predictably defaulted on interest payments.<br>
<br>Crisp in his prosperity bought Moor Close, an imposing red-bricked house built in 1881 at Binfield, a village on the edge of Windsor Park, with easy rail links to the City and convenient for racing. A &#145;Spy&#146; cartoon of him published in <span class="italic">Mayfair</span> in 1911 shows a sharp, self-assured, resilient-looking man with glossy tailoring but no physical distinction. He sat several times for this portrait, &#145;in spite of the fact that he is an extremely busy man and rarely to be found out of his office&#146;, wrote Sir Leslie Ward, of whose work Crisp &#145;made a representative collection &hellip; which hangs in his beautiful house near Ascot&#146;  (Ward, 338).<br>
<br>After the revolution in 1917, the BBFT bought Russian securities on the open market in an attempt to protect the value of its own holdings. By the early 1920s Crisp's stockbroking firm was the largest individual holder of Russian securities in Britain. He was a member of the Russian committee of the Foreign Bondholders Council until 1924, when he was forced to resign on the discovery that he had been negotiating privately with Soviet officials. Crisp saw the Conservative Party's anti-Bolshevism as an obstacle to debt settlement, and therefore contested Windsor unsuccessfully as a Liberal in the general elections of 1922 and 1923. After a minority Labour government took office under Ramsay MacDonald in 1924, he visited Russia, and discussed Anglo-Soviet settlement and the abandonment of the Chinese consortium policy with MacDonald and other Labour leaders. When a general election was called before the Anglo-Russian commercial treaty was signed, Crisp's bank lent &pound;5000 to the Labour Party, and he personally paid &pound;750 for Labour to fight the three parliamentary seats in Berkshire. These were the first Labour candidacies in the county: his son Christopher stood at Windsor, also unsuccessfully. Crisp wrote to Hugh Dalton on 21 July 1930, &#145;When I resigned from the Carlton Club my firm lost many clients, and when I fought the Windsor Division as a Liberal Free Trader more clients fell away, and when my son stood &hellip; as a Labour candidate my business suffered an eclipse which led me later to leave the Stock Exchange&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PRO 30/69/676).<br>
<br>Crisp retired in 1927 and went to Australia for a few years. His supporters turned away in his misfortune, and such was his obscurity that his entry was deleted from <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> in 1948. He died of coronary disease on 7 November 1958 at Tooting Bec Hospital, London, and was cremated at Streatham Vale.<br>
