<span class="headword">Mayo,  Elizabeth</span>  (1793&#150;1865), <span class="occ">educational reformer and evangelical writer</span>, sister of the educationist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18451/', "Charles Mayo (1792&#150;1846)")</script>, was born at 1 Hammet Street, Aldgate, London, on 18 June 1793, daughter of Charles Mayo (1754&#150;1814), a solicitor, and his wife, Elizabeth Knowlys (<i>d</i>. 1837). In 1822 Elizabeth joined her brother to help run an evangelical school, first at Epsom and later at Cheam, based on ideas Charles had acquired from the Swiss educationist Pestalozzi.<br>
<br>Under Charles's influence Elizabeth acquired a lifelong interest in infant education, with a particular concern to develop teacher training. She adopted the Pestalozzian method of developing observation through the examination of objects. At Cheam Elizabeth produced her two most successful works, <span class="italic">Lessons on Objects</span> (1830) and <span class="italic">Lessons on Shells</span> (1832). The first books of their kind in England, they popularized the use of the object lesson, influencing generations of teachers. They were frequently reprinted, both in England and abroad, with <span class="italic">Lessons on Objects</span> reaching a sixteenth edition by 1859. However, although Elizabeth was keen to counteract the dullness of contemporary teaching styles, her lesson plans tended to be artificial and mechanical. <span class="italic">Lessons on Objects</span> is a simple analysis of the properties of 100 common objects and shows a limited understanding of Pestalozzi's claim that good observation can lead to verbalization and subsequent concept formation.<br>
<br>In 1834, following her brother's marriage, Elizabeth moved to Hampstead, where she continued to write about infant methodology, both separately and with Charles. The Mayos differed from other infant school pioneers, Robert Owen, David Stow, and Samuel Wilderspin, because they attempted to combine Pestalozzian philosophy with a passionate religious conviction. They became the most widely known contemporary evangelical writers on early years education. Both stressed the importance of making infant education a &#145;sacrifice to the Lord&#146;, and of ensuring children were on &#145;the side of religion and morality&#146;  (C. and E. Mayo, <span class="italic">Practical Remarks on Infant Education</span>, 1837, 47). Elizabeth was, if anything, more zealous and single-minded than Charles. Teachers had a duty to inculcate religion in the next generation simply because &#145;it is written&#146;  (E. Mayo, <span class="italic">Lessons on Objects</span>, 1852, v).<br>
<br>In 1843 Elizabeth became the first woman in England to be employed in teacher training. She undertook supervisory work at the Home and Colonial Infant School Society in Gray's Inn Road, London, the first specific institution dedicated to the training of infant teachers. Her exact position is unclear, but it is evident she devised and presented model lessons, supervised and reviewed programmes of work, and acted as a general consultant. Students were trained to teach grammar, arithmetic, geography, drawing, singing, physical education, and sensory discrimination through the examination of objects. Priority was given to the inculcation of religious and moral beliefs. Members of the public were invited into the institution to observe the teaching process for themselves.<br>
<br>Under Elizabeth's guidance the Home and Colonial Society provided not only teachers but lesson plans, pictures, and objects specifically designed for young children (see her <span class="italic">Model Lessons for Infant School Teachers</span>, 1838). By 1846 Joseph Fletcher, an inspector of schools, reported that the society was supplying teachers for nearly all the country's infant teaching vacancies. In 1848 and 1849 Elizabeth also edited the society's <span class="italic">Quarterly Educational Magazine and Record</span>. Although ill health forced her to relinquish this post, she continued to make regular contributions to society publications  (see <span class="italic">The Educational Paper of the Home and Colonial Society</span>, vols. 1&#150;5, 1859&#150;63) until her death.<br>
<br>Elizabeth's emphasis on structure, at a time when early years teaching tended to be unsystematic, secured her importance in the history of infant education. A plaque at the Home and Colonial Society buildings commemorated her &#145;hearty sympathy, wise counsel and friendly aid&#146;, and praised her attempts to combine the &#145;principles of Pestalozzi &hellip; with evangelical truth&#146;. A &pound;500 bequest from Elizabeth was subsequently used for a Mayo Schoolroom in Gray's Inn Road. In 1861 her approach was adopted at Oswega, America's foremost teacher training institution. Elizabeth Mayo died at Great Malvern, Worcestershire, on 1 September 1865, and was buried on 8 September in her mother's grave in Kensal Green cemetery, London.<br>
