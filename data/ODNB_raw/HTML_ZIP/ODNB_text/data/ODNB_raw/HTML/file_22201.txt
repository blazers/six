<span class="headword">Picken,  Ebenezer</span>  (1769&#150;1816), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in Well-meadow, Paisley, and was named after his father, a silk weaver. He received his elementary education in Paisley, and went in 1785 to Glasgow University, studying there for five years. He preferred literature and good-fellowship to the prospects of a United Secession minister&#151;the office which his father desired him to fill. Picken wrote poetry while a student which was published in 1788 as <span class="italic">Poems and Epistles, Mostly in the Scottish Dialect</span>. Alexander Wilson, poet and naturalist, warmly hailed his gifts in his own <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1790). On 14 April 1791 Picken and Wilson debated in the Edinburgh Pantheon &#145;Whether have the exertions of Allan Ramsay or Robert Fergusson done more honour to Scottish poetry?&#146; Picken eulogized Ramsay, while Wilson defended Fergusson, and they later published their poems in a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Laurel Disputed, or, The Merits of Allan Ramsay and Robert Fergusson Contrasted</span>.<br>
<br>In 1791 Picken opened a school at Falkirk, and on 23 September married Robina Belfrage, the daughter of the minister of the burgher church there. Towards the end of the year he was appointed teacher of an endowed school at Carron, Stirlingshire, where he remained about five years, struggling with poverty which compelled him to give up his clerical ambitions.<br>
<br>In 1796 Picken settled in Edinburgh and tried business, first as the manager of a mercantile enterprise, and afterwards on his own account as a draper and music-seller. He travelled to America in 1809. Unsuccessful as a merchant, he returned to teaching, and was known, about 1813, to Robert and William Chambers, his neighbours in Bristo Street, as well-meaning, but &#145;sadly handicapped&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoir of Robert Chambers</span>, 72). In 1813 he published <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Poems, Songs, &hellip; Partly in the Scottish Dialect, with a Copious Glossary</span> (2 vols.). In 1815 Picken assisted Andrew Duncan with <span class="italic">Elogiorum sepulchralium Edinensium delectus</span>, on monumental inscriptions selected from Edinburgh burial-grounds.<br>
<br>Picken's health gradually failed and he died of consumption in Edinburgh in 1816. He was survived by his wife, three sons and two daughters, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22202/', "Joanna Belfrage Picken (1798&#150;1859)")</script>. Four children had died in infancy. Picken's <span class="italic">Pocket Dictionary of the Scottish Dialect</span> was published anonymously in 1818 and was used by John Jamieson for his etymological dictionary of the Scottish language.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_22200"></a><span class="headword">Andrew Belfrage Picken</span>  (1802&#150;1849)<span class="occ"></span>, second son of Ebenezer Picken, was born at Stevenlaw's Close, Edinburgh, on 5 November 1802, and some time before 1827 became private secretary to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17519/', "Sir Gregor MacGregor")</script> of Poyais in Central America. Ruined by MacGregor's fraudulent enterprise, Picken made his way back to Edinburgh where, penniless, he wrote occasionally for the <span class="italic">Caledonian Mercury</span>, and played small parts in the theatre. At Edinburgh, in 1828, he published <span class="italic">The Bedouins and other Poems</span>. The work displays considerable fancy and energy of expression. In 1830 he went to Montreal, where he became an artist and teacher of drawing. He died there on 1 July 1849.<br>
