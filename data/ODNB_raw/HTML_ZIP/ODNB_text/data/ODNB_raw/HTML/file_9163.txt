<span class="headword">Farley,  Charles</span>  (1771&#150;1859), <span class="occ">actor and theatre producer</span>, was born in London. He is said by John Doran to have appeared on stage at Covent Garden as early as 1782, but the first documented record of him is as Prince Edward in <span class="italic">Richard III</span> on 11 October 1784, when he was about thirteen years old. From this point on he appeared regularly on Covent Garden's salary list (and also, during the summer seasons, on the Haymarket's), gradually rising at Covent Garden from 15<i>s</i>. weekly (in 1785&#150;6), to 30<i>s</i>. in 1790&#150;91, to reach &pound;5 in 1798&#150;9. By this time he had gained experience in a variety of roles (such as Buckle in Benjamin Hoadley's <span class="italic">The Suspicious Husband</span> and Lamp in John O'Keefe's <span class="italic">Wild Oats</span>). One speciality was the smaller Shakespearian roles, such as Poins, Roderigo, Osric, and Cloten, which were invariably original and distinctive. His salary increased to &pound;10 weekly from 1804&#150;5 and remained at this level into the 1820s.<br>
<br>Farley is described on the playbill as the composer of the pantomimic ballet <span class="italic">Raymond and Agnes, or, The Castle of Lindenbergh</span> (1797), an elaborate setting of an episode in Lewis's <span class="italic">The Monk</span>, in which Farley played the hero. It logged twenty-two performances and was frequently revived. Farley's interest in pantomime, the staging of spectacle, and the perfecting of tricks made possible by theatrical machinery was stimulated by Thomas Dibdin's arrival at Covent Garden. Among their early projects were <span class="italic">The Magic Oak</span> (January 1799), for which Farley was principally responsible&#151;Dibdin wrote the songs and recitatives&#151;and <span class="italic">The Volcano, or, The Rival Harlequins</span> (December 1799), described on the playbill as &#145;invented by Dibdin, &amp; produced under the direction of Farley&#146;, which was especially impressive for its fiery volcanic opening and mid-air battle between Floridel and Cratero. His most notable pantomime was <span class="italic">Harlequin and Mother Goose</span> (1806), praised by <span class="italic">The Times</span> for its &#145;brilliancy of effect, dexterity of trick, activity and variety&#146;, among which were a chair which rose into the flies immediately it was sat on, a duck which flew out of a pie, a letter box which changed into a lion's mouth, and a sideboard which transformed itself into a beehive. Grimaldi, who excelled in the role of the clown, was introduced to Covent Garden that season, and Farley tutored him with &#145;infinite pains&#146;  (Dickens, 163) for his exhausting first part as Orson to Farley's Valentine in Dibdin's eponymous play.<br>
<br>Farley, who was effectively Grimaldi's master, coached the clown in many subsequent roles; and Dibdin paid tribute to his &#145;indefatigable aid&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 1.400) as collaborator. However, Farley was not always keen to claim the extent of his involvement in many of the pantomimes and other pieces his inventive mind crafted for the Covent Garden stage in a more or less unbroken association lasting nearly forty years (1797&#150;1834). An adaptation of Scott's <span class="italic">Old Mortality</span> as <span class="italic">The Battle of Bothwell Brigg</span> (1820), seemingly outside his usual ground, gave scope to his love of effects. In similar vein was his adaptation of <span class="italic">Henry IV, Part 2</span>, with additional coronation scenes (1821).<br>
<br>Farley's long acting career, remarkable for the sheer number of roles he created, belonged in style more to the eighteenth than the nineteenth century. Hazlitt praised him in 1814 for his &#145;comic personage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 18.200); his stentorian voice&#151;said to have a &#145;curious bubbling sound&#146;&#151;could be tuned to fit foppish parts, and his exceptionally large nose (which was in later life reduced by surgery) suited villains. His best villains were the hero in the equestrian drama <span class="italic">Timour the Tartar</span> (1811) and Grindoff in Pocock's melodrama <span class="italic">The Miller and his Men</span> (1813), with its spectacularly explosive finale. Doran concluded that he was the &#145;jolliest of millers, most imposing of Tartars, most wicked of sorcerers, most abominable of ruffians, gayest of Frenchmen, most laughable of fops&#146;  (Doran, 144).<br>
<br>Farley survived the increasing tribulations of Covent Garden in the 1820s and early 1830s&#151;when his author payments sometimes failed to materialize and there were quarrels with James Winston, resented for his interference in preparations for the pantomime&#151;to retire from the theatre in 1834, after fifty years in the profession. Alfred Bunn, who regretted having no job for him at Drury Lane in 1835, described him as one &#145;whose industry and great abilities so many years contributed to [Covent Garden's] fortunes and reputation&#146;  (Bunn, 2.6).<br>
<br>The last twenty-five years of Farley's life were spent quietly in retirement, mainly at 3 Hart Street, Bloomsbury. He outlasted most of his contemporaries into a new theatrical era, which, by his death from general decay at the age of eighty-seven, at 42 Ampthill Square on 28 January 1859, had largely forgotten his name and achievements.<br>
