<span class="headword">Burgh,  William George  de</span>  (1866&#150;1943), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was born at New Wandsworth, London, on 24 October 1866, the son of William de Burgh, barrister and civil servant, who died when de Burgh was twelve, and his wife, Hannah Jane, daughter of Captain Thomas Monck Mason RN. He went to Winchester College, thence as a postmaster to Merton College, Oxford, where he was awarded a second class in classical moderations (1887) and a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1889). Some difficult years followed in which he was briefly an assistant master at Derby School and, living at Toynbee Hall, was appointed in 1892 as censor of studies at Balliol House and Wadham House, university settlements in London. In 1896 he found his life work on appointment as lecturer in Greek and Latin in the University Extension College at Reading, where he remained until 1934. On 26 January 1897 he married Edith Mary, daughter of William Francis Grace, vice-consul at Mogador, with whom he had two daughters and one son.<br>
<br>For many years de Burgh's teaching burden was excessive; he soon added philosophy to his curriculum and became professor of the subject in 1907; he taught classics until 1910. His administrative cares were hardly less absorbing: from the first he had faith in the future of Reading, and he had the satisfaction of guiding the development of the college into a university (its charter was received in 1926). The credit for this achievement is generally ascribed to W. M. Childs, and de Burgh was willing that this should be so; but while the acquisition of the necessary funds was Childs's work, the academic statesmanship was de Burgh's. Childs, de Burgh (deputy vice-chancellor, 1926&#150;34), and F. H. Wright, the registrar, &#145;formed a kind of inner cabinet&#146;  (Holt, 42) which ran the university's affairs.<br>
<br>The enforced leisure of 1914&#150;18 was used by de Burgh to prepare work for publication, and <span class="italic">The Legacy of the Ancient World</span> (1924, rev. edn, 1947) proved the most successful of his books. Although his intellectual gifts were highly regarded by his pupils and by the Oxford philosophers who were his contemporaries and friends, their wider recognition was belated: he was Gifford lecturer at St Andrews (1937&#150;8) and Riddell memorial lecturer at Newcastle (1938); not until 1938 was he elected to a fellowship of the British Academy. The reason for this may have lain in his disinterestedness; for himself he sought neither fame nor reward. He had a strong sense of duty as a categorical imperative, and in fulfilling his obligations the only standard he failed to satisfy was his own. Inflexible when any matter of principle was at stake, he was nevertheless warm-hearted and genial, an unfailing tonic to his friends. His sympathy with the young, his forensic gifts, and his vitality were the secret of his success as a teacher. He knew all the students in his faculty individually and was remembered for his influence upon them  (Holt, 86).<br>
<br>Tall, slim, and erect, de Burgh made walking his only physical recreation; his other diversions lay in art, literature, light verse, and the complexities of the railway system. His radiance of personality had its roots in the religious faith expressed in his motto, <i>A cruce salus</i>, the keynote of his life. A student of scholasticism, yet much influenced by modern idealism, he endeavoured to construct a distinctively Christian philosophy by developing a philosophical argument to the truth of the gospel. His project was unfashionable at a time when protestant theologians were disparaging reason and when few philosophers were interested in religion, but his argument, based on the experience of a lifetime and elaborated by the resources of his vigorous mind, was found impressive by those in sympathy with his views. He suffered a stroke in the summer of 1942 while walking on the Dorset downs and died at his home, The Cottage, Toller Porcorum, Dorset, on 27 August 1943, survived by his wife. He was buried at Toller Porcorum on 30 August.<br>
