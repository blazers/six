<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Devine,  George Alexander Cassady</span>  (1910&#150;1966), <span class="occ">actor and theatre director</span>, was born on 20 November 1910 in Hendon, near London, the only child of Giorgios Devine, bank clerk, of Hendon, and his wife, Ruth Eleanor Cassady. He was educated at Clayesmore School, of which the founder and headmaster was his uncle Alexander Devine, and at Wadham College, Oxford, where he read modern history. One of his tutors was Lord David Cecil. As president of the Oxford University Dramatic Society in his last year, he established a foothold in the professional theatre by inviting John Gielgud to direct the society's 1932 production of <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, in which Devine played Mercutio in company with Peggy Ashcroft's Juliet and Edith Evans's Nurse, and Christopher Hassall's Romeo.<br>
<br>Devine left Oxford without taking schools to embark on a London acting career. At the same time, he attached himself as business manager to the firm of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74321/', "Motley")</script>, the stage design partnership of Elizabeth Montgomery, Margaret Harris, and her sister (Audrey) Sophia Harris (1900&#150;1966), who on 27 October 1939 became Devine's wife, and was the mother of his only child, Harriet.<br>
<br>It was in the Motley studio that he first met Michel Saint-Denis, director of the Compagnie des Quinze, whom for the rest of his life he acknowledged as his master. With Saint-Denis and others he set up the London Theatre Studio (1936&#150;9) which attempted a revolution in British stage training. After the war (which Devine spent mostly in Burma as a captain in the Royal Artillery, and during which he was twice mentioned in dispatches), he resumed his alliance with Saint-Denis at the Old Vic Centre: a tripartite offshoot of the Old Vic Company, comprising a school (directed by Glen Byam Shaw), the Young Vic touring troupe (directed by Devine), and a never-completed experimental theatre (in the charge of Saint-Denis). From its opening in 1947 the centre produced an astounding crop of young actors, directors, and designers, and when the governors of the Old Vic closed it down in 1952 their action provoked a storm of professional outrage and parliamentary criticism.<br>
<br>Up to this time Devine had spent most of his working life as a teacher&#150;administrator, but with the break-up of the Vic Centre, he turned to freelance directing: partly of opera at Sadler's Wells and Covent Garden (where he directed the premi&egrave;re of Sir William Walton's <span class="italic">Troilus and Cressida</span>, 1954), and partly of the Shakespeare repertory at Stratford upon Avon (collaborating with Gielgud and Isamu Noguchi in the &#145;Japanese&#146; <span class="italic">King Lear</span> in 1955). In 1956 he resumed his reformist mission as artistic director of the newly formed English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre. The company's original policy was to persuade established novelists to write for the stage, a policy abandoned after the production of John Osborne's <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span> (1956) which released a tidal wave of new plays by hitherto unknown young playwrights including John Arden and Arnold Wesker. Until the end of the decade the Court was the spearhead of the so-called &#145;breakthrough&#146; movement, challenging the reigning conventions of dramatic craftsmanship and reasserting the theatre's role as a platform for radical opinion.<br>
<br>Throughout this spectacular period Devine remained personally inconspicuous. After the first season he directed very few new plays himself (excepting those by his close friend Samuel Beckett); and when he acted on the Court stage it was usually to save money. His purpose was to create a free space where the best talents could collaborate in pushing the theatre from the periphery to the centre of English cultural life: a purpose partly acknowledged in 1958 when he was appointed CBE &#145;for services to drama&#146;.<br>
<br>Devine's &#145;writers' theatre&#146; was a place where material of a kind formerly restricted to club performances found a public outlet. He was not the originator of this idea, but he was the first English director to make it work. He succeeded through an unshakeable determination, entirely untouched by narrow obsessiveness. In opening his doors to unknown writers and directors he also kept them open to eminent pre-war colleagues such as Ashcroft and Laurence Olivier: and in keeping an open space for the rebel artists under his roof he took great care not to play the rebel with his own management committee. He remained a dedicated teacher, and the creator of an exemplary theatre in which the technician was respected no less than the actor and the writer. His final years were spent with his former London Theatre Studio pupil the designer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/89981/', "Jocelyn Herbert (1917&#150;2003)")</script>, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31222/', "Sir Alan Herbert")</script>. In her company he died in London on 20 January 1966.<br>
