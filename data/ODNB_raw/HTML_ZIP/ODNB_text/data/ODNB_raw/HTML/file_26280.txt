<span class="headword">Stanley,  Edward</span>, first Baron Monteagle  (<em>c.</em>1460&#150;1523), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the fifth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26279/', "Thomas Stanley, first earl of Derby (c.1433&#150;1504)")</script>, and his wife, Eleanor Neville (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1440, <i>d</i>. before 1471), fifth daughter of the earl of Salisbury. He married first Anne Harrington (1455&#150;1489), and second, about 1501, Elizabeth Vaughan (<i>d</i>. 1515), with whom he had a son, Thomas, and a daughter, Jane. Stanley also had three illegitimate children: a daughter, Mary, and two sons, Edward and <a href="#cosubject_26280">Thomas [<i>see below</i>]</a>. During the Scottish campaign of 1482 he was knighted by Richard, duke of Gloucester. The following year he served as a pallbearer at the funeral of Edward IV. He was one of several northern knights granted lands and offices in southern counties during Richard III's reign. Richard's patronage did not, however, secure his loyalty, and Edward benefited from his family's support for Henry Tudor, becoming sheriff of Lancashire in October 1485.<br>
<br>Stanley's main residence was at Hornby, Lancashire, formerly a Harrington estate, inherited through his wife. Although frequently present at court&#151;for the creation of Prince Henry as duke of York in 1494, and at the reception of Katherine of Aragon in 1501&#151;his most important duties concerned the security of England's northern border. Responsible for the defence of Lancashire and a commissioner of array for Yorkshire and Westmorland, he led 3000 men in the army of Thomas Howard, earl of Surrey, which defeated a Scottish invasion at Flodden on 9 September 1513. Commanding the English left flank, he won distinction by storming Branxton Edge, and overrunning the enemy baggage park. For his valour he was installed KG in 1514 and summoned to the House of Lords as Baron Monteagle the following November, a title that was supposedly an allusion to the eagle crest of the Stanleys and the seizure of the high ground at Flodden.<br>
<br>For a while Monteagle was prominent in English diplomacy in France, attending both the marriage of Princess Mary to Louis XII in 1514 and the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520. Yet it was to be the regional politics of north-west England that dominated his affairs. In 1521 his nephew, the earl of Derby, resenting the encroachment of royal authority into Lancashire and Cheshire, engaged in some provocative challenges to the crown. Men of his household killed deer in the royal forests of Bowland. Monteagle faced a conflict of loyalties, but swiftly seems to have chosen his king over his kin. At a specially convened session of assizes to deal with the offenders, there were scuffles between his adherents and those of Derby. The rift eventually became so bitter that the earl attempted, unsuccessfully, to deprive his uncle of Hornby and its revenues, in his will of 1521. During the next two years Scottish troops again massed on the border. Monteagle was busily organizing companies of soldiers to meet this threat when he died, at Hornby Castle, on 6 April 1523. The parish church was being rebuilt at the time, and he was buried in the grounds of Hornby Priory, which was later demolished. Both Henry VIII and Cardinal Wolsey were left gold rings and bequests of money in his will.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_26280"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Stanley</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1569), <span class="occ">bishop of Sodor and Man</span>, was the illegitimate son of the first Baron Monteagle. As lords of Man, the Stanleys controlled the Manx church and, after attending Oxford, Thomas was consecrated as bishop in 1510. A pluralist, he was also rector of several northern parishes, including Badsworth, Yorkshire, and Winwick and Wigan in Lancashire. Often at odds with authority, he boasted in 1523 of his intent to leave England to take service with Richard de la Pole. In 1536 he sneered at the earl of Derby, his kinsman, for accepting a commission to raise troops to suppress the Pilgrimage of Grace. Eventually, in 1545, he was deprived of his bishopric for refusing to comply with the act that reallocated his see from the province of Canterbury to that of York. Restored in 1556 by Queen Mary, he then supported the crown, presiding over the ordination of priests in Preston. On Elizabeth's accession he took up residence in Durham where he wrote a metrical chronicle of the Stanleys, completed in 1562. He thereafter attracted comment chiefly for his idleness, for he lived, it was said, &#145;as merry as Pope Joan&#146;  (Bridgeman, 139) until his death in March 1569.<br>
