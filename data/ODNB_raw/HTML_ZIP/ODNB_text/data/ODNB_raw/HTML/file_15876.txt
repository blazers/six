<span class="headword">LaFontaine, Sir  Louis-Hippolyte</span>, first baronet  (1807&#150;1864), <span class="occ">politician in Canada</span>, born at Boucherville, in the county of Chambly, Lower Canada, on 4 October 1807, was the third son of Antoine M&eacute;nard, called LaFontaine (1772&#150;1814), a carpenter, and his wife, Marie-Josephte Fontaine, called Bienvenue, and the grandson of Antoine M&eacute;nard Lafontaine, a member of the legislative assembly of Lower Canada. He was educated at Montreal, and in 1825 proceeded to study law by entering the office of Fran&ccedil;ois Roy. His political reputation was considerable while he was yet a clerk, and after his call to the bar in 1828 he quickly acquired a large practice among French Canadians. On 9 July 1831 he married Ad&egrave;le (<i>d</i>. 1859), the daughter of Amable Berthelot. He was returned to the legislative assembly of Lower Canada at the general election of 1830 for the county of Terrebonne, for which he continued to sit until 1837. He was at first a follower of Louis-Joseph Papineau, whom he vigorously urged on in his resistance to the British government. But as the <i>parti patriote</i> became more intransigent he began to seek compromise. At the outbreak of rebellion in 1837, he travelled to Westminster to plead unsuccessfully for constitutional reform. On the outbreak of a second rebellion in November 1838 he was imprisoned, but released without trial. He then became the leader of the French-Canadian moderate reformers.<br>
<br>Although LaFontaine considered it fundamentally unjust, he did not oppose the union of Upper and Lower Canada in 1840. On 21 September 1841, after contesting Terrebonne unsuccessfully, he was returned to the parliament of the united provinces for the fourth riding of York, a county in Upper Canada, chiefly through the influence of Robert Baldwin. He was at once recognized as the leader of the French Canadians in the new assembly. In September 1842, on the urging of the governor-general, Sir Charles Bagot, he formed the LaFontaine&#150;Baldwin administration, in which he held the portfolio of attorney-general for the lower province. During his term of office he obtained a cessation of proceedings against the rebels of 1837, including Papineau. The ministry resigned on 28 November 1843 in consequence of a difference with Bagot's successor, Sir Charles Theophilus Metcalfe (afterwards Baron Metcalfe), with regard to the control of the nomination of government officials. In November 1844 LaFontaine was again returned for Terrebonne, which he represented during the whole period of his opposition. In March 1848, after a stormy election in which several people were killed, he was returned for the city of Montreal, which he represented during the remainder of his public life.<br>
<br>In March 1848 the Reform Party triumphed at the general election, and LaFontaine was commissioned by the governor-general, Lord Elgin, to form a ministry based on the principle of responsible government. He thus became the first prime minister of Canada in the modern sense of the term. During this, his second, administration, he demonstrated the achievement of responsible government by the passage of the <span class="roman">Rebellion Losses Bill</span>, despite fierce opposition and violent demonstrations. His ministry also passed an <span class="roman">Amnesty Act</span> to forgive the 1837&#150;8 rebels, secularized King's College into the University of Toronto, incorporated many French-Canadian colleges, established Laval University, adopted important railway legislation, and reformed municipal and judicial institutions. LaFontaine retired from political life towards the close of 1851, and was created a baronet on 28 August 1854.<br>
<br>His first wife having died in 1859, on 30 January 1861 LaFontaine married Julie-Elizabeth-Genevi&egrave;ve 
    (Jane; 1822&#150;1905)
  , the widow of Thomas Kinton, a merchant of Montreal. They had one surviving son, Louis-Hippolyte, on whose death, in 1867, the baronetcy became extinct. On 13 August 1853 LaFontaine was nominated chief justice of Lower Canada, and continued to hold the office until his death, at his home in Montreal, on 26 February 1864, following an apoplectic fit the previous day. He was buried on 29 February in the C&ocirc;te-des-Neiges cemetery, Montreal.<br>
