<span class="headword">Monoux,  George</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1465, <em>d.</em> 1544), <span class="occ">merchant and local politician</span>, was born by 1465, probably in London, the youngest of the five sons of Richard Monoux, of the Salters' Company. He was descended from John Monoux, of Stanford, Worcestershire, and the family was probably of Welsh marcher origin. He is first recorded (1485&#150;6) in Bristol, where he exported cloth to Bordeaux, Lisbon, and Spanish ports in return for wine, oil, salt, and sugar. He rose to be mayor (1501) and there married his first wife, Joan, with whom he had three children (who predeceased him).<br>
<br>At the end of his mayoralty Monoux returned to London and became a freeman of the City (1503) as a member of the Drapers' Company. By 1508 he had remarried, his new wife being Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wood, the widow of Robert Wattes, sheriff of London and a fellow draper. From 1510 he lived in Crooked Lane, New Fish Street, not far from Drapers' Hall. He was master of the company in 1508&#150;9 and was re-elected five times between 1516 and 1539. In 1507 he became alderman of Bassishaw ward, which office he held until 1541, and in 1524 became the City's senior alderman. He was sheriff (1509), auditor (1512), and mayor of London (1514), and in 1514 he received a grant of arms. He was appointed one of the commissioners to sell the goods of Scots in London (1513), and he was also a commissioner for collecting five subsidies (1512&#150;24). He petitioned Henry VII over cloth-making irregularities in 1508 and was on deputations seeking remission of new customs rates in 1508&#150;9. In 1512 he lobbied parliament over a new corporation bill, so he had some parliamentary experience when in 1523 he was elected one of the four MPs for the City. He was re-elected mayor the same year, but he declined the mayoralty on grounds of ill health and was fined &pound;1000; the fine was remitted in 1524.<br>
<br>Monoux's wealth was considerable, and he invested his profits in land. His ledger traces (from 1508) the increase of his estate in London, which included ex-monastic property and well-known taverns, such as the Pope's Head. He acquired manors in ten counties, especially Bedfordshire, Essex, Norfolk, and Yorkshire. In the subsidy valuation of 1523 he was assessed at &pound;1000, and his contribution to the loan of 1535&#150;6 (&pound;3000) was the highest in London. Monoux was a hard-headed and somewhat devious businessman. In 1508 he fell foul of the law banning payments to foreigners in gold coin, but escaped financial penalty. Sir Richard Gresham's plans (1537&#150;8) for a bourse in Lombard Street to rival that in Antwerp were stalled partly because Monoux haggled over the sale of property he owned. It took Henry VIII's intervention, which Gresham said should be &#145;sharply made, for he ys of no gentyll nature&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>), to browbeat Monoux into acquiescence, though the scheme was temporarily abandoned.<br>
<br>As a country seat Monoux bought in 1507 the moated mansion Moones in Walthamstow, and he became a local benefactor. He built a causeway and two bridges over the Lea marshes to avoid floods on the journey into London, he provided a feast room (1527) for the proper celebration of parish weddings and holy days, and for St Mary's Church he reconstructed the tower and north aisle and built the Monoux chantry chapel. He died at Moones on 9 February 1544. His altar tomb is gone, but the mural memorial brass of him and his second wife, originally above the tomb, is now (with later inscription) in the north aisle of St Mary's. His heir, George Monoux, was the great-grandson of his eldest brother, Humfrey. In 1527 Monoux had bought land in Walthamstow churchyard on which to build a school and almshouses, and his will left City property worth &pound;50 a year as an endowment to pay the salaries of a schoolmaster and parish clerk, who were to pray for the souls of Monoux and his wives and to teach up to thirty children. The school is today the Sir (a local posthumous courtesy title) George Monoux Sixth Form College, now on another site in Chapel End, Walthamstow.<br>
