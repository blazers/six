<span class="headword">Boate,  Gerard</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Gerrit Boot]</span>  (1604&#150;1650), <span class="occ">physician and natural historian</span>, was born in Gorinchem, the Netherlands, one of five children born to Godefroy de Boot (<i>c</i>.1570&#150;1625), soldier and author, and Christina van Loon (<i>fl</i>. 1600&#150;1630). He entered the University of Leiden, possibly first as a student of letters, but certainly as a medical student, on 21 June 1628. He graduated DM on 3 July 1628. In 1630 he published the well-received <span class="italic">Vrolycke uuren (Horae jucundae)</span>, a book of Low German and Latin poems. About 1630 Boate and his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2739/', "Arnold Boate")</script>, also a medical student from Leiden, went to England to join their mother and sisters. Boate settled in London, where he was appointed physician to the king. In 1631 he married Katherine Menning.<br>
<br>Most of what we know of Boate and his brother stems from their close association with the Boyle family and other Anglo-Irish politicians, and with Samuel Hartlib. They were men of science, Baconian empiricists, protestants, and improvers. Webster suggests that they were part of Boyle's Invisible College and they were certainly involved in Hartlib's Office of Address for Communications for the dissemination of useful learning. The brothers turned their reforming pens first to philosophy and in 1641 published a treatise critical of Aristotelian philosophy, an event referred to by Samuel Beckett in his poem &#145;Whoroscope&#146;: but Gerard is remembered mainly for his natural history of Ireland. This was a project of some importance to the Hartlibians. When he wrote his natural history Boate had never visited the country. He relied on information from his brother, who had spent eight years travelling and practising medicine there, and from Sir William Parsons, surveyor-general of Ireland, his son Richard, and other families who had been driven from their large Irish estates by the civil war. Boate apparently completed his natural history by 1645, having begun work in 1644 when Arnold sent information, but it was not published immediately.<br>
<br>Boate was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians on 6 November 1646 and his London practice throve. On 17 July 1647 Boate's Irish connections secured him appointment as physician to the army in Ireland, but the disturbances there delayed his arrival until towards the end of 1649 and he died in Dublin in January 1650.<br>
<br>Boate's papers were acquired by Hartlib after his death. They included medical papers, particularly Boate's &#145;choicest secrets&#146;, namely &#145;1. Receipt against the Consumption Cough for which he was mainly cryed up. 2. Receipt against the stone. 3. Receipt of his Purge which the old Archbishop Abbot hugely commended because the next day the body was not costive or bound which was a great inconveniency in all other purges&#146;  (Hartlib MSS, Ephemerides 1653, pt 2 28/2/57A). They also included his natural history, which Hartlib, with the agreement of Arnold Boate, who was then in Paris and who edited the text, published as <span class="italic">Ireland's naturall history &hellip; conducing to the advancement of navigation, husbandry, and other profitable arts and professions &hellip; published &hellip; for the common good of Ireland, and more especially for the benefit of the adventurers and planters there</span> (1652). The dedication to Oliver Cromwell and Charles Fleetwood, commander-in-chief in Ireland, apparently by Hartlib but in fact by John Durie, is a fine piece of religious writing. He expresses the hope that Ireland will be settled by Adventurers and perhaps exiled Bohemians and other protestants. Boate's text itself is described by Webster as &#145;a major development in economic geography&#146;  (Webster, 429). In a break with the chorographic tradition of Camden which emphasized antiquities and local curiosities, Boate describes natural resources plainly and systematically to produce a coherent regional geography. There is little topographic information and there are no maps, but his scientific education is evident from his descriptions of geology and processes such as glass making. His aim was systematic description as a prelude to improvement by and for protestant settlers: consequently the natural features of the country are described with enthusiasm to interest new settlers, but the Irish are reproached for their failure to improve the land and for their unruliness and disorderliness. This might well reflect the influence of William Parsons who was fiercely anti-Catholic and bitter towards the Irish. In a letter to Hartlib prefixed to the volume Arnold Boate stated that his brother had contemplated three further books on the flora, fauna, and people of Ireland respectively. A French translation was published in 1666 and further versions were published in Dublin in 1726, 1755, and 1860. Hartlib prevailed unsuccessfully on several others to complete the work of producing a natural history of Ireland: Arnold Boate contributed an <span class="italic">interrogatory</span> or questionnaire about Ireland to Hartlib's <span class="italic">Reformed Spiritual Husbandman</span> of 1652. Further progress was made by Robert Wood and Miles Symner but the impetus for scientific reform in Ireland passed to the surveying and mapping of Petty and others, and Gerard Boate's contribution remained the most important part of the natural history project.<br>
<br>Boate and his wife are listed among the Adventurers who financed the English suppression of the Irish rising of 1641, and in repayment Boate's widow Katherine obtained under certificate dated 15 November 1667 more than 1000 acres of land in co. Tipperary. Boate's sons Gerard, Godefroy, and Gerson, became respectively a lawyer, a Treasury secretary, and a preacher to the German congregation in Dublin. Other descendants played a distinguished part in the history of Irish medicine into the twentieth century.<br>
