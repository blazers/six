<span class="headword">O'Callaghan, Sir  Robert William</span>  (1777&#150;1840), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, second son of Cornelius O'Callaghan, first Baron Lismore (1741&#150;1797), and Frances (1757&#150;1827), second daughter of Mr Speaker Ponsonby, was born in October 1777. He was descended from one of the few indigenous families in the Irish peerage. He was appointed ensign in the 128th regiment on 29 November 1794, and was transferred as lieutenant to the 30th light dragoons on 6 December 1794; he became captain on 31 January 1795. He was transferred to the 22nd light dragoons on 19 April 1796, was appointed major to the 40th regiment on 17 February 1803, and became lieutenant-colonel in the 39th regiment on 16 July 1803. In March 1805 he embarked in command of the 1st battalion of the 39th regiment, which had been selected to form part of the expedition destined for the Mediterranean under Lieutenant-General Sir James Craig, and subsequently went from Malta to Naples with the flank companies. When they returned to Malta in February 1806 he remained in Sicily, and at the battle of Maida (4 July 1806) he commanded a grenadier battalion, receiving after the victory a gold medal. At the end of August 1811 he went with the 1st battalion of the 39th from Sicily to join the army in the Peninsula, and attained the brevet rank of colonel. At the battle of Vitoria (21 June 1813) he was in temporary command of the brigade, and his gallant conduct was praised in Wellington's dispatches. He also commanded the brigade during the actions in the Pyrenees in July 1813, and was at the passage of the Nivelle and the Nive. His conduct at Garris (15 February 1814) was mentioned in dispatches. He was present at the victory of Orthez (27 February 1814), and received a gold cross with two clasps for Maida, Vitoria, Pyrenees, Nivelle, Nive, and Orthez.<br>
<br>O'Callaghan was promoted major-general on 4 June 1814, and was made a KCB on 2 January 1815. He was appointed to the staff of the army in Flanders on 25 June 1815 and to the staff of the army in France on 22 April 1818, and commanded the troops in Scotland from 15 June 1825 to 22 July 1830. He was gazetted colonel of the 97th regiment on 7 September 1829, and was promoted lieutenant-general on 22 July 1830. He was appointed to command the army at Madras on 4 October 1830, and was made colonel of the 39th on 4 March 1833. In the spring of 1835, on the departure of Lord William Bentinck for England, he held for some months command of the troops in India, and was in command at Madras until October 1836. O'Callaghan was made GCB on 19 July 1838. He died, unmarried, in London on 9 June 1840.<br>
