<span class="headword">Balfour, Sir  Andrew</span>  (1873&#150;1931), <span class="occ">expert in tropical medicine and novelist</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 21 March 1873, the eldest son of Thomas Alexander Goldie Balfour MD, of Edinburgh, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Peter Christall, of Elgin. He was educated at George Watson's College and at the University of Edinburgh, graduating MB CM in 1894, and MD in 1898 with a thesis on the toxicity of dyestuffs and river pollution, for which he received a gold medal. After a short period of private practice with his father he entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, as an advanced student, in 1895. He graduated DPH there in 1897, and BSc in public health at Edinburgh in 1900.<br>
<br>During the South African War, Balfour served in 1900&#150;01 as a civil surgeon and gained the queen's medal with three clasps. In 1901 the advice and friendship of Patrick Manson awakened in him an interest in tropical medicine, which was to make his reputation. The following year he became director of the Wellcome Tropical Research Laboratories at Khartoum and local medical officer of health. His knowledge of Arabic, his popularity with the Sudanese, and his untiring energy resulted in the eradication of malaria in Khartoum. His work there earned the support and approval of the three British administrators, Lord Cromer, Lord Kitchener, and Sir Reginald Wingate, to whom he strongly advocated the care and health of the indigenous population as essential features of modern imperial rule. Also in 1902 Balfour married Grace, third daughter of George Nutter, of Sidcup, Kent; they had two sons.<br>
<br>In addition to the duties of organization Balfour made several important discoveries in protozoology. These resulted from his work on spirochaetosis in birds and in man, the study of the life history of spirochaete bacteria in the tick, and the identification of a leishmanoid disease of the skin. In order to study protozoa he explored the upper reaches of the White Nile in a floating laboratory. All his scientific work was published in four reports of the Wellcome Research Laboratories between 1904 and 1911. In 1913 he returned to England and became the founder of the Wellcome Bureau of Scientific Research.<br>
<br>During the First World War Balfour was given the rank of lieutenant-colonel and rendered conspicuous service in the army medical corps. First as president of the medical advisory committee of the Mediterranean expeditionary force in Mudros, Salonika, Egypt, and Mesopotamia, and then as scientific adviser in east Africa, he organized sanitary reforms throughout these theatres of war. Subsequently he was asked to reorganize the health service of Egypt, and later, in 1918, at the request of General Sir Edmund Allenby, he reported on anti-malarial measures in Palestine.<br>
<br>When the war ended Balfour resumed his scientific research at the Wellcome Bureau, but he was soon called away from his laboratory. In 1921 and 1923 he visited Mauritius and Bermuda to advise the Colonial Office on health reform in these islands. In 1923 he was appointed director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and for seven years worked with boundless energy towards the perfecting of the school. The predominant place which the school achieved in the teaching of and research into preventive medicine owed much to Balfour's initial administration. In the course of his work Balfour contributed extensively to medical literature, writing on the prevention of tropical diseases and sanitary reform. His writings include <span class="italic">Public Health and Preventive Medicine</span> (with C. J. Lewis, 1902); <span class="italic">Memoranda on Medical Diseases in Tropical and Sub-Tropical Areas</span> (1916); <span class="italic">War Against Tropical Disease</span> (1920); <span class="italic">Reports to the Health Committee of the League of Nations on Tuberculosis and Sleeping Sickness in Equatorial Africa</span> (1923); and <span class="italic">Health Problems of the Empire</span> (with H. H. Scott, 1924).<br>
<br>Early in his career Balfour also achieved fame as a novelist. His novels of historical adventure, &#145;wild tales&#146; as he called them, show the influence of R. L. Stevenson and G. A. Henty, but he had a distinctive and vigorous style of his own. He wrote <span class="italic">By Stroke of Sword</span> (1897), <span class="italic">To Arms</span> (1898), <span class="italic">Vengeance is Mine</span> (1899), <span class="italic">Cashiered and other War Stories</span> (1902), and <span class="italic">The Golden Kingdom</span> (1903).<br>
<br>Balfour was appointed CMG in 1912, CB in 1918, and KCMG in 1930. Honorary degrees were conferred on him by the University of Edinburgh and by the universities of Johns Hopkins and Rochester, USA. He was elected FRCP (London and Edinburgh). In 1920 he was awarded the Mary Kingsley medal of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and from 1925 to 1927 he was president of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.<br>
<br>Balfour was endowed with qualities which brought him distinction in various paths of life. He was a fine athlete, and played rugby for both Edinburgh and Cambridge, obtaining his &#145;blue&#146; at the latter university; he was also capped twice for Scotland. He was a noted boxer, a keen fisherman, and a big-game shot. He was of a kindly and modest disposition, and his conversation and speeches were adorned with wit and humour. His work in tropical medicine and public health was of outstanding merit. Balfour's health broke down in 1929 under the strain of overwork and he died by self-strangulation at Penshurst, near Tonbridge, Kent, on 30 January 1931. He was buried at Grange cemetery, Edinburgh, on 5 February.<br>
