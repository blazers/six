<span class="headword">Peterson,  Peter</span>  (1847&#150;1899), <span class="occ">Sanskritist</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 12 January 1847, the son of John Peterson, merchant of Leith, and Grace Montford Anderson. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35490/', "Sir William Peterson")</script>, classical scholar and educationist, was his brother. His father and grandfather were natives of Shetland, and hence Peterson often described himself as a Shetlander. He was educated at Edinburgh high school and Edinburgh University, where he graduated MA with first-class honours in classics in 1867. It was there that he began to study Sanskrit, under the professor Simon Theodor Aufrecht. After a visit, partly for study, to Berlin, he proceeded in 1869 to Lincoln College, Oxford, to continue Sanskrit under Monier Williams and Friedrich Max M&uuml;ller, gaining the Boden Sanskrit scholarship in 1870, and then moving to Balliol College, from which he graduated BA in 1872. Peterson married, on 29 October 1872, Agnes Christall (<i>d</i>. September 1900). Several children of the marriage survived him; a son entered the India civil service.<br>
<br>On 2 January 1873 Peterson joined the Indian educational service, and went to Bombay as professor of Sanskrit in Elphinstone College, where he remained until his death, except for the period from September 1874 to November 1876, in which he spent a year's sick leave in Europe and another year teaching at the Deccan College, Poona. During his first nine years in India Peterson did little research, thus contravening the terms of his post; accordingly in 1881 the government proposed to transfer him to a chair of English which did not require him to produce original work, and to give the Sanskrit chair to Professor Bhandarkar of Poona, who had been acting professor at Elphinstone from 1867 until Peterson's appointment. In 1882, however, it was agreed that the two would retain their posts and jointly lead the government-funded search for Sanskrit manuscripts in the Bombay &#145;circle&#146; (western and central India). Many of Peterson's discoveries in the libraries of Gujarat, Rajputana, and elsewhere were of high literary value, and his six reports on the search (1883&#150;99) were highly praised, as displaying his ability to identify what was most important out of a large mass of material; his exploration of Jain literature was especially appreciated. He edited several Sanskrit texts, mostly for the <span class="roman">Bombay Sanskrit Series</span>, of which he and Bhandarkar had joint charge. The most important were the romance <span class="italic">K&acirc;dambar&icirc;</span> (1883) and the poetry anthology <span class="italic">The Subh&acirc;shit&acirc;vali of Vallabhadeva</span> (1886), the latter edited jointly with Pandit Durgaprasada; in these his main aim was to convey his appreciation of the literary qualities of the Sanskrit, and he frequently made comparisons with Western literature. Others included the <span class="italic">Hitopade&#347;a</span> (1887) and selections from the <span class="roman">Ramayana</span> (1883) and the <span class="roman">Rigveda</span> (4 vols., 1888&#150;92). For the <span class="roman">Bibliotheca Indica</span> he edited (1889) <span class="italic">The Nyayabindutika of Dharmottaracharya</span>, a Buddhist text he had discovered himself. Much of Peterson's success was due to his tact and respect for Indians and their traditions. This is made clear in an obituary speech made by Bhandarkar, who remained not only a colleague but one of his closest friends  (Bhandarkar, xlvi&#150;l). To this also was due his success in unearthing the jealously concealed manuscripts of the Jains at Cambay and elsewhere.<br>
<br>Peterson also taught and examined English for Bombay University and produced editions of <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> and book 4 of Palgrave's <span class="italic">Golden Treasury</span> designed for Indian students. He was much admired for his mastery of different styles of English, displayed mainly in his frequent contributions to the Bombay dailies and the <span class="italic">Times of India</span>.<br>
<br>For some time Peterson was a popular member of the Bombay municipal corporation, and for a long time he was registrar of Bombay University. He often served as secretary of the Bombay branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, and he was its president from 1895 until his death. In 1883 he received a DSc in philology from Edinburgh University, and he was a candidate for the Boden chair of Sanskrit in Oxford at the time of his unexpected death from heart disease in Bombay on 28 August 1899.<br>
