<span class="headword">Whall,  Christopher Whitworth</span>  (1849&#150;1924), <span class="occ">stained-glass artist and craftsman</span>, was born on 16 April 1849 at the rectory, Thurning, Huntingdonshire, the third of eight children of the Revd William Whall (1808&#150;1874), rector of Thurning-cum-Little Gidding, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Boultbee (1817&#150;1891). Christopher Whall's rural childhood in the hamlet of Thurning was a lifelong inspiration, and his art was rooted in his sympathy with vernacular craftsmanship and a profound love of nature. He was largely educated at home but from 1863 to 1865 attended Rossall School, Lancashire. His ambition, despite parental opposition, was to be an artist. He moved to London, and in 1867 enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools, where he studied painting for the next seven years; Lord Leighton (one of his teachers) and the Pre-Raphaelites were early influences on his work. In the late 1870s he travelled in central and northern Italy for almost three years, studying painting and decorative art, guided by the writings of John Ruskin. At Lucca he felt called to dedicate himself to &#145;Catholic art&#146;  (C. W. Whall, &#145;Private Journal&#146;). After returning to London in 1879, he became a Roman Catholic and was helped by the Rosminian Order of Charity at St Etheldreda's, Ely Place, who commissioned his first designs for stained glass for the newly restored church. The windows were only a partial success, and further experience of designing for firms such as James Powell &amp; Sons reinforced Whall's growing frustration with the division of labour between artist and executant in the craft.<br>
<br>On 10 November 1884 Whall married Florence Chaplin (1849&#150;1936), a portrait painter, and in the following year they moved to a cottage and smallholding at Stonebridge, near Dorking, Surrey, where their five children were born. Whall's career remained precarious until in 1887, having converted part of his cowshed into a workshop, he determined to learn the technical processes of stained glass&#151;cutting, painting, and glazing&#151;so that no aspect of the craft would be beyond his experience and control. His works shown at the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in 1888 were described as among &#145;the most important&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Year's Art</span>, 1889, 97) and he soon gained commissions from leading architects such as J. D. Sedding and Henry Wilson (lady chapel windows, St Mary's, Stamford, Lincolnshire, 1891&#150;3) and E. S. Prior (east window, Holy Trinity, Bothenhampton, Dorset, 1895).<br>
<br>Identifying with the continuous tradition of English stained glass, not just its medieval triumphs but also the humbler work of eighteenth-century plumber-glaziers, Whall created an innovative, expressive style based on materials and honest craftsmanship. It was a logical development from Morris &amp; Co.'s stained glass, with the added dimension brought by Whall's own constant involvement in workshop practice. His windows are emphatically glassy rather than purely pictorial in character, combining sumptuous colours, thickly textured &#145;slab&#146; glasses, and bold leading patterns. The beautifully drawn figures, often framed by silvery canopies of foliage and set against backgrounds of patterned quarries, blend the Italianate grace of late Pre-Raphaelitism with a peculiarly English&#151;and Gothic&#151;sensibility. The general effect subtly echoes, without imitating, historic forms.<br>
<br>By the late 1890s Daddy Whall (as he was called by his studio staff) was assisted by a team of young pupil-apprentices, many of whom progressed to distinguished careers of their own. Their collaboration was essential to his most important commission, the glazing of the lady chapel and chapter house at Gloucester Cathedral (1898&#150;1913), which established him as the leading stained-glass artist of the arts and crafts movement. Acclaimed by the American architect Ralph Adams Cram as &#145;perfectly Medieval and perfectly Modern&#146;  (R. A. Cram, <span class="italic">My Life in Architecture</span>, Boston, 1936, 192), much of the Gloucester work was undertaken for payment which barely covered costs. It led, however, to many subsequent commissions: windows for Canterbury Cathedral (1900&#150;02), for the new cathedrals at Cape Town (1908) and Pretoria (1909&#150;10), and for churches in the USA.<br>
<br>In 1896 Whall and his family had returned to London, where W. R. Lethaby invited him to teach stained glass at the London County Council Central School of Arts and Crafts and, later, at the Royal College of Art. Whall's inspirational teaching, stressing technical mastery alongside design skills, is encapsulated in his book <span class="italic">Stained Glass Work</span> (1905), still the best manual ever written on the subject. Friends and followers felt that his windows truly expressed the man. He was, like the saints depicted in his glass, &#145;gentle, friendly, great-hearted&#146;  (Connick, 245).<br>
<br>The extent of Whall's influence on British, Irish, and American stained glass in the early twentieth century would be difficult to exaggerate, for almost every major designer-craftworker of the period belongs, in some sense, to his &#145;school&#146;. It would include, among many others, Louis Davis, Henry Payne, and James Hogan in England, Douglas Strachan in Scotland, Wilhelmina Geddes and Harry Clarke in Ireland, and Charles Connick in the USA. In art education his impact was seminal: he helped set up courses at Dublin and Birmingham and, throughout the English-speaking world, his <span class="italic">Stained Glass Work</span> became the standard textbook on the craft. Whall was master of the Art-Workers' Guild in 1912 and closely involved in organizing the British arts and crafts exhibitions at Ghent (1913) and Paris (1914) and at the Royal Academy (1916). Although eminent within his profession, he disliked publicity and self-promotion, declining a knighthood as incompatible with his lifestyle as a practising craftsman.<br>
<br>From 1907 Whall's studio-workshop was at 1 Ravenscourt Park, Hammersmith, a short walk from 19 Shaftesbury (later Ravenscourt) Road, where he lived for over twenty years. His daughter, Veronica Whall (1887&#150;1967), began work in the studio while still in her teens and many later commissions were designed and made jointly with her, for example the east window at Leicester Cathedral in 1920. Their collaboration was formalized in 1922 as Whall and Whall Ltd. In 1921 Whall moved to 37 Harvard Road, Gunnersbury, where he died on 23 December 1924. Despite contracting leukaemia, he continued to work almost to the end. Examples of his designs are in the Victoria and Albert Museum and the William Morris Gallery, London, where an exhibition of his work was held in 1999&#150;2000. Nature studies, including <span class="italic">The Oak Tree and its Inhabitants</span> by Whall and his pupils, are in the British Museum.<br>
