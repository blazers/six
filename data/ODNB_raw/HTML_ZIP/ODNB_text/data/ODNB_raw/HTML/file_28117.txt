<span class="headword">Varlo <span class="st"> [Varley]</span>,  Charles</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1725, <em>d.</em> in or after 1795), <span class="occ">agriculturist</span>, was born in Snaith, Yorkshire, about 1725. He visited Ireland at the age of twenty-one, and spent several years working for Edward Synge (1691&#150;1762), bishop of Elphin, whom he advised on agricultural matters. Synge knew him as Varley, probably the original form of his surname. While in Ireland, he was employed by the linen board to advise flax farmers on how to improve the quality of their flax, on the grounds that he came from a part of Yorkshire well known for flax farming. The post was obtained with Synge's help, as was the farm in co. Leitrim, acquired by 1748, where he experimented in the growing of turnips. He was seriously ill in 1750, Synge being &#145;in great pain for Varley's life&#146;  (Synge, 230). At the age of twenty-seven he married, and bought more land. He brought over English labourers and farm implements. It used to be thought that Varlo was the inventor of the Rotherham plough, which was in wide use by the end of the eighteenth century, but in fact this had been patented in 1730.<br>
<br>In 1760 the prohibition on the export of Irish cattle to England was removed, and Varlo&#151;abandoning Synge, who may have regarded him almost as a &#145;surrogate son&#146;  (Synge, xix)&#151;sold his land in Ireland and prepared to bring his cattle over to England. This was a very unpopular move: Varlo's cattle were slaughtered by the mob in the streets of Dublin in May 1760, and he himself had a very narrow escape. With the help of the duke of Bedford, lord lieutenant of Ireland, he managed to get some compensation from the government, and he appears to have begun cattle farming in England, probably in Yorkshire. In 1764 he perfected a harrowing and sowing machine. He also invented a winnowing machine which he perfected in 1772, and a machine designed to remove friction.<br>
<br>In 1784, while he was living in Sloane Square, in London, Varlo became involved in a somewhat ludicrous episode. He had bought papers and charters supposedly granted by Charles I to Sir Edward Plowden, entitling him to colonize New Albion (later New Jersey) in America. This attempt at colonization had failed and in Charles II's reign the charter was superseded by a new grant to the duke of York. Armed with his papers (which were probably forgeries), Varlo went out to the American colonies in 1784 hoping to be recognized as governor of the province of New Jersey and to take over one-third of the territory. The case was tried before the colonial courts, but Varlo's claim was dismissed. Varlo nevertheless printed his documents in America in a thirty-page pamphlet. Before returning to England he travelled for a year through New England, Maryland, and Virginia (where he met George Washington). Once back in Britain he unsuccessfully petitioned the king and the prince of Wales in the hope of getting some of the money granted to American loyalists.<br>
<br>Varlo wrote widely on agricultural topics, with observations made on his travels in England and in America. His works include <span class="italic">The Yorkshire Farmer</span> (1766), <span class="italic">A New System of Husbandry</span> (1770, 5th edn 1785), and <span class="italic">The Floating Ideas of Nature, Suited to the Philosopher, Farmer, and Mechanic</span> (1796).<br>
<br>It is not known when Varlo died, but he appears to have been living in Southampton Row, New Road, Paddington, Middlesex, on 24 February 1795, when Sir John Sinclair sent him a formal letter of thanks for certain suggestions made by Varlo to the board of agriculture about the offering of premiums for the cultivation of maize.<br>
