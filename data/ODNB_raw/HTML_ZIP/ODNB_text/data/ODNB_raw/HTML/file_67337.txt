<span class="headword">Emin,  Emin Joseph</span>  (1726&#150;1809), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company and Armenian nationalist</span>, was born in Hamadan, Persia, the son of Hovsep 
    (also known as Joseph; <i>d</i>. 1777)
  , merchant. During Emin's youth internecine wars killed his mother (in 1734) and next youngest brother, scattering his family. about 1735 Hovsep emigrated with a new wife, Thekghi (<i>d</i>. 1758), to Calcutta; Emin and his paternal grandfather, Michael, joined them in 1745. Emin studied under a Mr Parrent at the English School in the Old Court-House. Rejecting a merchant's life, Emin worked his passage to England on the East India Company ship <i>Walpole</i> (14 February to 14 September 1751).<br>
<br>In London the Armenian Stephanus Coggigian of the London Royal Exchange employed Emin to represent Armenian interests at the king's bench and advanced Emin money for tuition at Mr Middleton's Academy for Boys in Bishopsgate. When Stephanus converted to Roman Catholicism, he demanded repayment from Emin, who left school in debt.<br>
<br>For three years Emin laboured for a bricklayer in Drury Lane, signed (then broke) indentures for a West India plantation, and briefly rejoined Middleton's academy as a servant&#150;student until Middleton went bankrupt. Destitute, Emin served Mr Roberts in the City as grocer's porter and then Mr Webster in Cheapside as a law clerk. Emin also briefly studied military drill with Colonel Dingley. In 1755, while strolling in St James's Park, Emin met Edmund Burke, who guided Emin's education, employed him as a copyist, and presented him with maps of Armenia. That year Emin also gained the patronage of the duke of Northumberland, who elicited his story of his militant Armenian nationalist ambitions and encouraged him to compose an autobiographical epistle, which he then circulated among 300 members of the British &eacute;lite. William, duke of Cumberland, subsequently sponsored him as a cadet officer in the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, where he studied mathematics and fortification under John Muller. He also received patronage and exchanged correspondence with, among others, the literary patron Elizabeth Montagu, the physician Messenger Monsey, Amelia, Lady Yarmouth, George, Lord Lyttelton, and William Pitt the elder.<br>
<br>After thirteen months at Woolwich Emin campaigned (from May 1757) on the continent as a gentleman officer attached to the British and Prussian armies during the Seven Years' War, including at the battle of Hastenbeck (26 July 1757). He briefly accompanied the Prussian army under Frederick the Great against Russia, but his English patrons withdrew him on the eve of the battle of Zorndorf (25 August 1758). He joined the British St Malo raid (June 1758). Between 1759 and 1761 he travelled to rouse Armenians living under Ottoman rule. After a brief return to England he went via Russia to serve Heraclius II, prince of Georgia. For eight years he used his European-style military training, limited Russian support, and financial subsidies from Lord Northumberland in vain attempts to achieve Armenian liberation from the Turkish and Persian empires. He returned from these futile guerrilla actions to Calcutta in 1770.<br>
<br>Despite his impressive credentials, the East India Company's Bengal army classed Emin as non-British, which barred him from the regular officers' corps. Instead the company appointed him (27 October 1770) only as the most junior brevet ensign (risaldar) of the first troop of Turksowars (irregular cavalry) in the 1st brigade, at Rs 300 (including <i>batta</i>, or extra pay) per month. Not even the dukes of Northumberland and Cumberland could arrange his nationalization or full commission from London. He served two frustrating years in the Bengal army, garrisoned at Dinapore, advancing (1771&#150;2) under General Sir Robert Barker to the assistance of Nawab Shuja ud-Daula of Oudh, then returning via Benares to Calcutta.<br>
<br>When Governor-General Warren Hastings disbanded the Bengal army's irregular cavalry in 1772, Emin perforce retired to half pay. Seeking advancement of the Armenian cause, he took leave and journeyed via Madras and Bombay. Settling in Jolfa, Persia, in 1776, he married Thangoom Khatoon (1748&#150;1843), daughter of Aga David. Emin subsequently returned to India in 1782, taking his eldest son, Arshak (1777&#150;1792), but leaving behind in Persia for a decade his wife, second son, Joseph (1781&#150;1868), and two daughters, Begoom (<i>b</i>. 1778/9) and Ismeen (1780/82&#150;1831). Resettling in Calcutta in 1784, Emin managed a posting in 1786 to the Bengal army's 3rd European Invalid regiment. Owing to his irregular status, he had repeatedly to petition the company for his back pay and monthly pension of Rs 91, granted only in February 1797. Emin's 640-page memoir <span class="italic">Life and Adventures of Joseph Emin, an Armenian, Written in English by himself</span> was published in London in 1792. Thereafter he lived among the struggling Armenian community in Bengal, dying in Calcutta on 2 August 1809.<br>
