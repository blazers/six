<span class="headword">Bradley,  Humphrey</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1584&#150;1625), <span class="occ">designer of land drainage systems</span>, was possibly the son of John Bradley (<i>fl</i>. 1561&#150;1568), concierge of the English trading house at Bergen op Zoom, Brabant, who was married to Anna van der Delft. He first appears in England in 1584, when he submitted to secretary Walsingham a lengthy and able &#145;advys&#146; on the cost of improvements to Dover harbour, though he was not employed on the scheme.<br>
<br>In 1589 Bradley was involved in various local drainage schemes: on the River Ouse in Cambridgeshire, the Nene near Wisbech, and the Witham in Lincolnshire. He was the first to see the need of and to plan for a single comprehensive drainage scheme for the whole of the fens, and on 3 December 1589 he presented a treatise on the topic to Lord Burghley. Access to Burghley was probably assisted by Bradley's marriage on 27 June 1589, in London, to Anna Sermantens from Delft, whose uncle, Joachim Ortell, was one of the Dutch diplomatic representatives in London. Bradley proposed that, since all the fenlands were above sea level, a simple gravitational drainage system would be sufficient, obviating the need for mills and machinery; this anticipated the system of straight new cuts later employed by Vermuyden. Bradley suggested that &#145;the greatest impediments to all good drainage projects live in the minds and the imaginations of men&#146;  (Darby, 264) and that privy council inaction over his scheme owed much to the selfish interests of individual landowners and counties.<br>
<br>In a letter of 3 March 1592 Bradley claimed to have leased from Lord Lumley all the coal on his manor at Hartlepool, but it is unclear if he ever developed the enterprise. Two further submissions to Burghley in March and April 1593 contained a comprehensive survey of the fenland economy and topography, and sensibly suggested that the variety of tenures demanded an act of parliament and crown finance to compel agreement. Although in the Netherlands he was reputed to be a skilled dyker, it is unlikely that Bradley had any experience of very large-scale drainage (as opposed to land reclamation by embankment). His suggested drainage methods seem woefully inadequate, and his assessment that the work could be completed by 700&#150;800 men in six months for &pound;5000 was hopelessly optimistic, given Vermuyden's later experiences. Yet the reason for Burghley's rejection of the scheme was probably not its technical defects but Bradley's failure to win financial patronage when well-placed groups of prospective English undertakers had a rival interest in fen drainage.<br>
<br>Bradley finally left England in 1594. Two years later he was sent to France by the states general of the United Provinces to aid Henri IV in land reclamation and drainage for strategic military purposes. On the establishment of peace, he was appointed on 1 January 1599 &#145;ma&icirc;tre des digues du royaume&#146;, which conferred a practical monopoly of land drainage throughout France. Initial difficulties were remedied by a royal edict (1607), which established a new body, the Association pour le Dess&eacute;chement des Marais et Lacs de France, whose members secured the necessary capital and shared in land allocation on completion of the work. Backed by Sully, the king's chief minister, and with strong connections at court, Bradley presided over extensive drainage works in the Auvergne, Languedoc, and Saintonge. He was unable to persuade Sully to have Rouen joined to Marseilles by connecting Joigny on the River Seine to Dijon on the Sa&ocirc;ne, but overall his work in France seems to have been successful.<br>
<br>Bradley was alive in France in 1625 and probably dead by 1639. His private life is glimpsed only in his letters to and from his wife, and in the baptism of two children, Joachim (1592) and Sara (1594), at the Dutch church at Austin Friars, London.<br>
