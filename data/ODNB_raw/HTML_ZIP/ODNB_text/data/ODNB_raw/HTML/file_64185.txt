<span class="headword">Hornyold,  John Joseph</span>  (1706&#150;1778), <span class="occ">vicar apostolic of the midland district</span>, was born on 19 February 1706, the eldest of the six children of John Hornyold (1679&#150;1771), gentleman, of Blackmore Park and Hanley Castle, Worcestershire, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1731), eldest daughter of Sir Piers Mostyn of Talacre, Flintshire. Originally destined for a worldly career, he entered the English College, Douai, on 7 August 1728 and took the student's oath on 24 December 1730. Having survived an accident that deprived him of sight in his left eye, he was ordained at Arras on 22 December 1736, and left for the English mission the following September with the hope of the college authorities that he would be &#145;a good missionary in the future&#146;  (<span class="italic">Douay College Diaries</span>, 214). For nearly two years he was based in Grantham, Lincolnshire, where he was noted for his pastoral zeal.<br>
<br>In 1739 Hornyold became chaplain to Mary, the widow of Thomas Giffard of Chillington, Brewood, Staffordshire, who lived in the dower house, called Longbirch, from 1718 until her death in 1754. After this date, and until 1804, Longbirch was rented as a residence for the vicars apostolic of the midland district. During his time as chaplain Hornyold published three works: <span class="italic">The Decalogue Explained</span> (1744), <span class="italic">The Sacraments Explained</span> (1747), and <span class="italic">The Real Principles of Catholics</span> (1749), based on the writings of his predecessor at Longbirch, John Johnson.<br>
<br>By 1750 Bishop John Talbot Stonor, vicar apostolic of the midland district, decided that he needed a coadjutor and that &#145;no body, within my acquaintance, was as fit as good Mr Hornyold&#146;  (Stonor to Mrs Giffard, 27 Sept 1750, Birmingham Archdiocesan Archives, A183). The bulls confirming Hornyold's appointment as bishop of Philomalia <i>in partibus infidelium</i> and coadjutor with right of succession were dated 20 December 1751  (ibid., A939), and he was consecrated by Bishop Stonor at Stonor Park, Oxfordshire, on 10 February 1752, succeeding to the vicariate on Stonor's death on 29 March 1756.<br>
<br>Hornyold continued to live at Longbirch, but was assiduous in making pastoral visits throughout his vicariate, which comprised fifteen counties and the Isle of Ely, and numbered 8760 Catholics, served by 42 secular and 48 religious priests  (draft letter to Propaganda, 1773, Birmingham Archdiocesan Archives, A793). He often supplied for priests who had to be absent from their missions and, whenever possible, received newly ordained priests into his house to prepare them for their pastoral duties. His reputation was that of a quiet, hard-working prelate who continued to live as far as possible the life of a holy and dedicated pastor.<br>
<br>By 1765 Hornyold complained that his constitution was &#145;much broken&#146;, that his eyesight was failing, and, being unable to ride, he could not visit his district  (J. Hornyold to T. Talbot, 15 Sept 1765, Birmingham Archdiocesan Archives, A142a). He tried to obtain Thomas Joseph Talbot as his coadjutor, offering &#145;with utmost Pleasure to resign the whole Government of the Distr[ict] to your Sole Care and to retire&#146;  (J. Hornyold to T. Talbot, 6 May 1766, ibid., A153), but Talbot steadfastly refused until prevailed upon by others, and he was consecrated in June 1766.<br>
<br>Although Talbot undertook the active care of the vicariate, Hornyold continued to interest himself in its affairs. He took over responsibility for Sedgley Park School on the death of William Errington in 1768, he bought land and caused the house and chapel at Oscott, Birmingham, to be rebuilt as a possible future residence for his successors, and he maintained a wide correspondence. &#145;Though he was most abstemious and mortified in his way of living,&#146; wrote Bishop Milner, &#145;he was cheerful and good humoured, as his friends in general testify, and particularly those clergymen, who, in succession were his chaplains.&#146; His health continued to decline, and he died at Longbirch on 26 December 1778, leaving the bulk of his estate, after some personal, pious, and charitable legacies, to his successor. He was buried on 30 December in Brewood parish church.<br>
