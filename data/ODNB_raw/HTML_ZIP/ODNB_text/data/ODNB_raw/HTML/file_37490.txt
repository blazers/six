<span class="headword">Griess,  (Johann) Peter</span>  (1829&#150;1888), <span class="occ">industrial chemist</span>, was born on 6 September 1829 in Kirchhosbach, Hesse, Germany, the son of Heinrich Griess, a farmer and the village blacksmith, of Kirchhosbach. He studied chemistry at Kassel Polytechnic and then at the universities of Jena and Marburg. He was an unruly student, noted for his eccentricity of dress, and accumulated large debts which his father had to settle by mortgaging some of his properties.<br>
<br>This seems to have sobered Griess somewhat and he became an assistant in A. W. H. Kolbe's laboratory in Marburg, but his contract was not renewed. However, Kolbe relented when Griess approached him again in 1856 after working in a tar distillery in Offenbach, and took him back. For reasons not apparent he had become a reformed character: he worked diligently and spent long hours in the laboratory. He so impressed Kolbe that when the great German chemist, A. W. von Hofmann, professor at the Royal College of Chemistry in London, visited Marburg in 1858 he recommended Griess for a position in Hofmann's laboratory. To support his recommendation Kolbe provided Hofmann with the April 1858 edition of Liebig's <span class="italic">Annalen der Chemie</span>, which included a paper by Griess entitled &#145;A preliminary notice on the influence of nitrous acid on aminonitro- and aminodinitrophenol&#146;. Hofmann realized that Griess had discovered a new and versatile chemical reaction which could provide a route to a wide range of new compounds. Griess was duly invited to London and Hofmann commissioned him to explore the possibilities of his new diazo compounds. The results of his experiments were published in a series of papers in the <span class="italic">Annalen</span> over the years 1860&#150;66, entitled &#145;A new class of organic compounds in which hydrogen is replaced by nitrogen&#146;.<br>
<br>For the latter part of this period Griess was no longer in London. In 1852 Hofmann had successfully completed an investigation for Allsopp &amp; Sons of Burton upon Trent after the French industrial chemist A. Payen had alleged that Allsopp's famous India Pale Ale&#151;an important export&#151;contained strychnine. Through Hofmann Greiss was offered an appointment as chemist at the brewery. He accepted in 1862 and remained there for the rest of his life, being left free to pursue his own research. In 1864 he discovered a further variant of his diazo reaction, known as coupling. In this the diazo compounds were linked with phenol or an aromatic amine, thereby forming intensely coloured compounds. Thus were born the azo dyestuffs, perhaps the greatest single discovery in the history of the dyestuffs industry. Griess played little part in the industrial exploitation of these dyes&#151;his few patents were not lucrative&#151;though he published a further series of papers, &#145;New investigations of the diazo compounds&#146;, in <span class="italic">Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft</span>. In 1884 he lodged a patent for the first direct cotton dye: that is, a dye requiring no mordant. The originality of his research was recognized by his election as FRS in 1868. The University of Munich conferred an honorary degree on him.<br>
<br>In 1869 Griess married Louise Ann (<i>d</i>. 1886), daughter of William Mason, medical officer of health for Burton upon Trent. They had two sons and two daughters. In the summer of 1888 he took his family on holiday to Bournemouth and there died of a heart attack, at Pynes, West Cliff Gardens, on 30 August, frustrating his desire to retire to Kirchhosbach when his children's education was complete.<br>
