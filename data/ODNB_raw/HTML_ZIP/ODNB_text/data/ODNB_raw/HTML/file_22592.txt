<span class="headword">Pory,  Robert</span>  (1608?&#150;1669), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in London, the son of Robert Pory, and attended St Paul's School, perhaps in the same cohort as John Milton. He was admitted as a pensioner to Christ's College, Cambridge, on 28 February 1625, just two weeks after the poet. Here he graduated BA in 1629 and proceeded MA in 1632; he acted as Burrell lecturer in rhetoric from 1634 to 1639, when he was admitted BD. On 24 September 1637 Pory was ordained priest in the diocese of Ely. On 21 September 1640 he was granted licence to marry Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Juxon and niece of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15179/', "William Juxon (bap. 1582, d. 1663)")</script>, then bishop of London. Exactly one week later, on Bishop Juxon's presentation, he was instituted to the rectory of St Margaret's, New Fish Street Hill, in London.<br>
<br>In November 1639 Pory acquired a second rectory, that of Thorley, Hertfordshire. By about November 1642 he appears to have abandoned London; on 23 March 1643 the House of Lords confirmed a Commons order admitting Thomas Froysell to St Margaret's, Pory having been sequestered on the basis of allegations that he had taught Arminian doctrines, and had refused to read parliamentary declarations before deserting his cure. It seems that there had been considerable friction with his parishioners, for the churchwardens recorded that &pound;6 1<i>s</i>. was &#145;paid in charges and expence in prosecuting the complaints&#146;  (<span class="italic">Walker rev.</span>, 55) against Pory at Westminster. On 4 April 1643 John Halsiter was admitted to the rectory of Thorley on the failure of Pory to appear to answer the charges against him, and the Commons ordered the rents be sequestered for Halsiter's use. In 1650 the committee for the advance of money was informed that he was living at Little Compton, Gloucestershire, the residence of his uncle-in-law, William Juxon, and that he had been present with Charles at Oxford and acted as a chaplain to the late king. Like Juxon, for the next ten years nothing is heard of him.<br>
<br>Pory did not return to New Fish Street Hill, but was restored at Thorley in 1660. After the Restoration he also became prebendary of Mardon in Chichester Cathedral; having originally acquired the bishop's mandate for installation on 13 December 1657 he was collated again on 21 July 1660. By the time of his installation at Chichester on 18 August Pory had acquired other livings: he was collated as archdeacon of Middlesex on 20 July, instituted as rector of St Botolph without Bishopsgate on 10 August, and collated as prebendary of Willesden in St Paul's Cathedral on the 16th of the same month. On 7 May 1661 Pory was installed as president of the puritan stronghold of Sion College. Also in 1661 he was awarded the degree of DD at Cambridge on the king's motion, &#145;for his particular sufferings for ourself and the church&#146;  (McDonnell, 145). At an unknown date after 29 November that year he married Jane, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10239/', "William Fuller (1579/80&#150;1659)")</script> and widow of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28648/', "Brian Walton (1600&#150;1661)")</script>, the late bishop of Chester.<br>
<br>Henry Oxinden, in his efforts to find a living, tried repeatedly to win Pory's favour. His diary makes clear that Pory was highly influential in the allocation of benefices, a fact which Oxinden understood to be connected to the elevation of Juxon to Canterbury, for Pory was &#145;a kinsman and favourite of the Archbishop&#146;. On Friday 10 October he &#145;went again to Dr Porie's house in Warwick court and asked him what he could object against me&#146;; it seems that Pory feared his suitor's illness would give rise to the need to employ a curate  (Gardiner, 273, 280). Pory himself did not wait at the back of the queue for livings. On 18 February 1662 he was instituted to the rectory of Hollingbourne, Kent, and in the same year added those of Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, and of Lambeth. Wood reports that this profusion of benefices &#145;being look'd on as too many for one person, was an almanack published this year (1663) by <i>Poor Robin</i>, in the title of which was an imprimatur pretended to be set by Robert Pory DD&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>: <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 2.267). Whether it was the scale of his pluralism or the punning opportunity afforded by his name which won him this notoriety is unclear. Pory died on 20 November 1669 and was buried at St James's, Clerkenwell. When he made his will he had two sons and four daughters living; each of the latter was given &pound;1000. Among his bequests the most notable was that of &pound;100 towards the rebuilding of St Paul's Cathedral, destroyed in the great fire of London.<br>
