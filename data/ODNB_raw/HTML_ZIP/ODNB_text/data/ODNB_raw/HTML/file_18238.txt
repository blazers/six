<span class="headword">Martyn,  Thomas</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1779&#150;1811), <span class="occ">natural history illustrator and pamphleteer</span>, was said to be a native of Coventry, Warwickshire  (Nichols, 8.432). Martyn developed a talent for coloured depictions of insects and shells. He purchased shells brought back from Cook's third voyage, although, as he wrote to Henry Seymer on 9 December 1780, &#145;I have purchased, amounting to 400 gns, more than 2 thirds of the whole brought home, Nevertheless I do not abound either in the variety of the new or many duplicates of the known ones that are valuable&#146;  (Dance, 100). He sold many of the shells, but the paucity of new species led him to modify his original plan to figure two different shells on each plate. Martyn sought to impose order on his subject: his <span class="italic">Universal Conchologist</span> bore the subtitle &#145;A new systematic arrangement by the author&#146;. It had 160 hand-coloured plates, the whole being published in four folio volumes between 1784 and 1787, making it the greatest of all books on shells.<br>
<br>Since Martyn's illustrations were hand-coloured he needed the assistance of professional artists, but, finding that miniaturists were unwilling to interrupt their normal work to paint shells, he decided to recruit his own workforce and train boys to paint in a uniform style. His first boy joined him about 1779; others followed, and eventually he had ten young men at work in his &#145;academy&#146; at 10 Great Marlborough Street, Westminster. In the first three and a half years over 6000 paintings were produced; at the end of that time Martyn saw that the standard had greatly improved, and decided to scrap the earlier plates and copies and begin again. This cost him dear, in time and money, but the splendour of the <span class="italic">Conchologist</span> brought him rewards in the form of gold medals from Pope Pius VI, the German Emperor Ferdinand, and the king of Naples, and flattering letters from lesser dignitaries.<br>
<br>Turning thereafter to insects, Martyn produced his <span class="italic">English Entomologist</span> (1792), followed by <span class="italic">Aranei, or, A Natural History of Spiders</span> (1793), a quarto in two parts. It included much of Eleazar Albin's well-known work on English spiders, Martyn having purchased Albin's drawings at the sale of the dowager duchess of Portland's museum. <span class="italic">Psyche: Figures of Non-Lepidopterous Insects</span> (1797) was probably produced privately and only about ten sets of its thirty-two stipple engravings are known to have been published. His only venture into botany, <span class="italic">Figures of Plants</span> (1795), consisted of forty-three coloured plates without text or captions.<br>
<br>Martyn reacted to the balloon flights of Lunardi and Blanchard in 1784 by issuing a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Hints of important uses to be derived from aerostatic globes. With a print of an aerostatic globe &hellip; originally designed in 1783</span> (1784). The design of his &#145;globe&#146; and its undercarriage was utterly impractical, the proposed uses being to elevate military signals in wartime and to serve as bases to explore the upper atmosphere. Military matters seem to have held some fascination for Martyn. In 1804 he published <span class="italic">A Dive into Buonaparte's Councils on his Projected Invasion of Old England</span>, in which he advised the duke of York, as commander-in-chief of the king's forces, on the enemy's probable invasion tactics. He also offered advice on how to keep the British troops in good heart, by the provision of good food and clothing, and medals for the brave. The preface states that the duke had recommended Martyn's son for a commission in the royal army or reserve. In patriotic mood, Martyn's <span class="italic">Great Britain's Jubilee Monitor</span> (1810) was merely a verbose and flattering expression of royalist sentiments. Nothing is known of his wife and family, nor of the circumstances of his death.<br>
