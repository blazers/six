<span class="headword">Sermon,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1629, <em>d.</em> 1680), <span class="occ">physician and inventor of medicines</span>, was almost certainly the William, son of John Surman, who was baptized on 8 November 1629 at Eldersfield, Worcestershire. He had a brother John, and was a near relative of Edmund, son of Edmund and Jane Surman, baptized in 1644 at Naunton Beauchamp, Worcestershire, and of Edmund Sermon (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1680), MA of St Mary's Hall, Oxford.<br>
<br>Sermon apparently decided at the age of fourteen to study medicine, having observed (from behind a hedge, while out hare-shooting) a young woman giving birth alone in a wood. He served for many years in the parliamentary forces under George Monck, and after the Restoration established a fashionable practice in London.<br>
<br>In 1661 Sermon was consulted by a patient suffering from dropsy; by the following year he had devised a pill which he successfully tried out on a friend. His pills must have contained aloes, as they were purgatives. In large doses (and strong men were recommended to take three at a time) they acted as emetics. To induce sweating he also offered a liquid medicine, presumably with an antimony base. Since the pills expelled all harmful humours and purified the blood, they were also reckoned to be effective against scurvy, venereal swellings, and jaundice.<br>
<br>Once Sermon had&#151;by his own account&#151;achieved some noteworthy cures in London during the great plague, early in 1666 he was invited by the mayor to Bristol, when the plague erupted there. In three months Sermon claimed to have cured all those who had followed his directions. With a thriving practice he stayed in Bristol until June 1669, when he was summoned to New Hall, Essex, to treat his old commander, Monck, by then first duke of Albemarle, who was gravely ill with dropsy. Sermon restored him to health in twenty-eight days, with nineteen pills. Monck, as Sermon later unblushingly wrote, evacuated by stool no fewer than 12 gallons of water; the patient also took Sermon's liquid drink infused in wine. On Sermon's departure in July the grateful Monck gave him a glowing testimonial; he died six months later, but not, Sermon defiantly maintained, of dropsy.<br>
<br>Sermon's career as a physician was now secure. A few weeks later Charles II requested the University of Cambridge to award him a doctorate of medicine. Sermon then moved to London and advertised his removal in the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, his address being East Harding Street, near Goldsmiths' Hall, Fetter Lane. Awarded his MD in 1670, and claiming to be physician-in-ordinary to the king, Sermon published his <span class="italic">Advertisement</span> (1670) concerning his &#145;most famous and safe cathartique and diuretique Pills&#146;; it ran to eleven editions by 1675. It was issued by the bookseller Edward Thomas, at the Adam and Eve, Little Britain, also the sole agent for the pills, which by 1672 had no fewer than seventy-eight retail outlets throughout Britain, twenty-four in London, one in Edinburgh, and one in Dublin. They sold at the high price of 4<i>s</i>. for twenty pills, no reduction being given for quantity.<br>
<br>In 1671 Sermon produced <span class="italic">The Ladies Companion, or, The English Midwife</span>. Its frontispiece, drawn and engraved by William Sherwin, portrays the author at the age of forty-two as dark-eyed, bewigged, and in a doctor's gown, with a round face, and a slightly disdainful smile; the antiquary Anthony Wood called Sermon &#145;forward, vain and conceited&#146;. Having declaimed in the preface about the &#145;black-mouth'd envy, that barks but cannot bite&#146; excited by his successes, and having warned against worthless imitations of his pills, Sermon went on to cover obstetric subjects in plain and straightforward language. He demonstrated the empirical nature of medicine in his day by prescribing herbal remedies for various ailments, and stated that a woman was most likely to conceive a few days after menstruation ceased, particularly if she hung wild carrot seed over her left arm above the elbow. An interesting pregnancy test was to mix thoroughly equal quantities of white wine and the woman's urine; if the concoction resembled bean broth, she was with child. Sixteen rather imaginative copperplate illustrations showed the positions of full-term infants in the womb.<br>
<br>Sermon's third work, <span class="italic">A Friend to the Sick</span> (1673), narrated the most remarkable cures achieved by the pills. Prefaced by a sequence of laudatory verses by Payne Fisher, Edward Cocker, and William Winstanley, among others, it is of interest for being punctuated by a variety of rambling reminiscences. He was determined that what he called his great arcanum should not die with him, and he wrote out the formula on a large piece of parchment, sealed it, and entrusted it to his wife. She was the daughter of Thomas Saunders of Bristol, but nothing further is known about her, except that she died in her husband's lifetime without surviving children. On 15 October 1678 he married the twenty-year-old Edith Davis, of St Margaret's Lothbury; almost forty-nine, he gave his age as about forty-five. They had a son, George. Sermon died just over a year later: six days after making his will, he was buried at St Bride's, Fleet Street, on 9 January 1680. His wife was sole executor, but he referred affectionately to his first father-in-law, Thomas Saunders, asking him to oversee the will. Despite Sermon's efforts to ensure the survival of his pills, they vanished without trace, not being included in the list of patent medicines in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1748, 346&#150;50).<br>
