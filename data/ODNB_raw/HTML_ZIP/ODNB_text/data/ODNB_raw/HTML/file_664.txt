<span class="headword">Armstrong,  Robert Archibald</span>  (1788&#150;1867), <span class="occ">lexicographer</span>, was born at Kenmore, Perthshire, and was baptized on 16 February 1788 at Dull, Perthshire, the eldest son of Robert Armstrong and his wife, Mary McKercher. He was educated initially at home, and then in Edinburgh and at St Andrews University. After graduating with good results in Latin and Greek, he moved to London, where he ran schools located in succession in various parts of the city. In 1842 he married Emma, the daughter of Stephen Dungate, and they had three daughters.<br>
<br>Armstrong wrote a number of articles and scientific papers, but his principal work was his dictionary: <span class="italic">A Gaelic dictionary in two parts, I. Gaelic and English, II. English and Gaelic, in which the words, in their different acceptations, are illustrated by quotations from the best Gaelic writers</span>, published in two quarto volumes in London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Dublin in 1825. This work, running to nearly 1100 pages, was the first Gaelic dictionary to attempt to provide etymological information. It also improved on previous works by incorporating a grammar of Gaelic and by indicating the word-class of entries. However, Armstrong can be seen in hindsight as overcredulous in accepting the authenticity of &#145;Ossian&#146;&#151;devoting an appendix to characters from his poems&#151;and overenthusiastic in offering not just (frequently accurate) Indo-European cognates for the words whose etymologies he provides, but also parallels from other language families which later developments in linguistic sciences have discredited. He makes it plain in his preface that he believes all languages have a single origin, which is highly debatable, and that Scottish Gaelic is the ancestor of Irish, Manx, and even Welsh, which is definitely wrong. The amount of space devoted to etymologies and other notes actually led to the total vocabulary in the English&#150;Gaelic section being smaller than that in William Shaw's earlier and more limited <span class="italic">Galick and English Dictionary</span> of 1780.<br>
<br>Armstrong's dictionary also was unfortunate in appearing barely three years before the <span class="italic">Dictionarium Scoto-Celticum</span> produced in 1828 by a team of compilers working for the Highland Society of Scotland. This work, apart from the prestige of its source, benefited from a greater number of entries, more distinction of senses within them, and slightly less wild etymologizing, while retaining a grammatical sketch of a nature similar to Armstrong's. As a consequence Armstrong lost money on his 3 guinea dictionary, though he was granted in 1826 the honorary status of Gaelic lexicographer-in-ordinary to the king.<br>
<br>For some two decades Armstrong supported his family on income from the South Lambeth grammar school, which he had established. He retired from the headship in 1852, and moved to Richmond. He was awarded a civil-list pension of &pound;60 a year, thanks to Lord Palmerston; a small grant from the Royal Literary Fund; and later the sum of &pound;100 from the Royal Bounty Fund, on the advice of Lord Derby. However, he had to continue tutoring until shortly before his death, which occurred on 25 May 1867 at Hanover House, Choumert Road, Peckham Rye, London. In 1869 Queen Victoria, on the recommendation of W. E. Gladstone, awarded a pension of &pound;50 a year to his widow.<br>
