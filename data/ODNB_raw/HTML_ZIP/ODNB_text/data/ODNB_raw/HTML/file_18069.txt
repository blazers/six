<span class="headword">Markham,  John</span>  (1761&#150;1827), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18071/', "William Markham (bap. 1719, d. 1807)")</script>, archbishop of York, and Sarah, daughter of John Goddard, a Rotterdam merchant, was born in Westminster on 13 June 1761. At the age of eight he went to Westminster School where his father was headmaster. In March 1775 he entered the navy on the <i>Romney</i>, with Captain George Elphinstone, and in her he made a voyage to Newfoundland; in March 1776 he followed Elphinstone to the <i>Perseus</i>, going out to join Lord Howe at New York, from where he sailed for the West Indies in February 1777. During this time he twice acted as prize-master. On a third occasion, in May 1777, during a violent gale, with a sinking ship and a drunken crew, Markham prevented prisoners retaking the prize until her crew were rescued by a passing vessel; some months later in England, Markham found his family in mourning for him, Elphinstone having written that he had been lost with the prize.<br>
<br>In March 1779 Markham was appointed to the <i>Phoenix</i>, and in July he was moved into the <i>Roebuck</i>, with Sir Andrew Snape Hamond, in which he returned to North America. Hamond appointed him acting lieutenant, and in May 1780 Admiral Marriot Arbuthnot, who had hoisted his flag on the <i>Roebuck</i> during the siege of Charles Town, gave Markham a commission as the ship's first lieutenant. In April 1781 he was moved into the <i>Royal Oak</i>, and in August Admiral Thomas Graves took him as first lieutenant of the <i>London</i>, his flagship. In her Markham was present in the battle off Cape Henry on 5 September, and afterwards he went to Jamaica, where, in March 1782, Sir Peter Parker promoted him to command the fireship <i>Volcano</i>. In May Sir George Brydges Rodney moved him to the sloop <i>Zebra</i> and sent him out to cruise off Cape Tiburon.<br>
<br>On 22 May Markham fell in with a brig flying a French ensign. He chased her, and she hoisted a union jack at the fore; Markham remained suspicious and fired into her. But it then appeared that she was a cartel, and had meant to display a flag of truce. On the complaint of the French lieutenant in command, Markham was tried by court martial and cashiered, but Rodney, after reviewing the evidence, reinstated him, and the king in council, on the report of the Admiralty, completely restored him on 13 November 1782. Indeed on 3 January 1783 he was promoted post captain.<br>
<br>From 1783 to 1786 Markham commanded the <i>Sphynx</i> in the Mediterranean. He was then on half pay for seven years, when he travelled in France, Sweden, Russia, and North America. In June 1793 he was appointed to the <i>Blonde</i>, in which, after a few months' service in the channel, he went out to the West Indies with Sir John Jervis (later earl of St Vincent), and took part in the reduction of Martinique. The <i>Blonde</i> was then sent home with dispatches, and during the summer of 1794 she was attached to the squadron under Admiral George Montagu, or cruising among the Channel Islands and on the French coast. In August Markham was moved into the <i>Hannibal</i>, and in May 1795 he was again sent out to the West Indies, where he was met by the news that a younger brother, David, colonel of the 20th regiment, had been killed at Port-au-Prince on 26 March. From here, in common with many others, Markham was invalided; more than a quarter of his ship's company died, and another quarter was committed to hospital. On his return home in 1796 he married (27 November) the Hon. Maria (<i>d</i>. 1810), daughter of the late <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23477/', "George Rice")</script>, politician, and his widow, Baroness Dinevor; they had three sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18064/', "Frederick Markham")</script>, army officer, and a daughter.<br>
<br>In March 1797 Markham commissioned the <i>Centaur</i> at Woolwich, and during the following months he sat on many courts martial arising from the mutiny at the Nore. He did not get to sea until September, and was then employed during a stormy winter on the south coast of Ireland. In May 1798 he sailed to join Lord St Vincent, off Cadiz, from where he was detached with Commodore John Thomas Duckworth whom he supported in the capture of Minorca in November. Between May and August 1799 the <i>Centaur</i> also took part in the vain chase round the Mediterranean of the French fleet under Admiral Bruix, who eventually returned into Brest. When the bulk of his pursuers retired to the Mediterranean station, the <i>Centaur</i> remained in the channel and participated in the blockade of Brest. In 1800 Lord Bridport was relieved of the channel command by Lord St Vincent, with whom Markham shared a political association with Lord Lansdowne. When, in February 1801, St Vincent was appointed first lord of the Admiralty, he selected Markham as one of his colleagues at the board. For the next three years Markham's career was identified with St Vincent's. In November 1801, on the death of Lord Hugh Seymour, he was elected MP for Portsmouth, and became the representative of the Admiralty in the House of Commons. He retired from the Admiralty with St Vincent in May 1804, but returned to it in January 1806 as a colleague of Lord Howick, and afterwards, until March 1807, of Thomas Grenville. He then practically retired from public life, though he continued to sit in parliament for Portsmouth until 1826, with one break from 1818 to 1820.<br>
<br>Markham became a rear-admiral on 23 April 1804, vice-admiral (25 October 1809), and admiral (12 August 1819). In 1826 his failing health compelled him to retire from public life altogether. He was advised to winter in a milder climate and left England in September, travelling by easy stages to reach Naples in January 1827. There he died (13 February) and was buried (27 February).<br>
