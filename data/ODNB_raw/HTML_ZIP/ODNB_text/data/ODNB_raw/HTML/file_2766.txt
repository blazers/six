<span class="headword">Bogue,  David</span>  (1750&#150;1825), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was born on 18 February 1750 at Dowlaw, in the parish of Coldingham, Berwickshire, the sixth of the twelve children of John Bogue (<i>bap</i>. 1713, <i>d</i>. 1786), who became laird and farmer at Hallydown, and Margaret Swanston (<i>d</i>. 1805). He was educated at the parish school of Eyemouth and Duns grammar school, whence he proceeded in 1762 to the University of Edinburgh. He studied for the ministry of the Church of Scotland, and received licence as a preacher.<br>
<br>Bogue's father, however, refused on principle to ask the patron of the Coldingham living, Lord Marchmont, to present him, and instead advised him to seek work in London. Thus in 1771 Bogue taught in schools in Edmonton, Hampstead, and finally Chelsea, with the Revd William Smith, whom he assisted also in his ministerial duties. In 1777 he became minister of an Independent or Congregational chapel at Gosport in Hampshire, and played a key role in the formation of the Hampshire Association of Independent Churches. He provided some tuition for students, and from 1789 was able to develop the Gosport Academy for the education of young men destined for the Independent ministry. On 28 August 1787 he married Charlotte Uffington (<i>d</i>. 1824).<br>
<br>Early in 1792 Bogue emerged as a pioneer in the cause of protestant missions overseas, expressing his concern forcefully in <span class="italic">A sermon preached at Salters-Hall, March 30th, 1792, before the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge in the Highlands and Islands</span> (1793). Thereafter he took a leading part in the foundation of the London Missionary Society, notably through his influential appeal published in the <span class="italic">Evangelical Magazine</span> for September 1794 and the consultations which it stimulated [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42118', "Founders of the London Missionary Society")</script>]. He preached the closing sermon at the society's inauguration in 1795, hailing its interdenominational principle as &#145;the funeral of <i>bigotry</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sermons Preached in London at the Formation of the Missionary Society, September 22, 23, 24, 1795</span>, 1795, 130), and was one of the society's original directors. In 1796 he and his friend Robert Haldane of Airthrey planned to go to India themselves as missionaries, but the East India Company refused to sanction the scheme. Bogue's major contribution to the society instead became the education of its missionaries. Most of its directors at first considered this unnecessary, but Bogue convinced them otherwise, especially for those who would work amid the ancient civilizations of Asia; so, from 1800, prospective missionaries were trained at the Gosport Academy with Bogue as their tutor. He retained this position for the rest of his long life, providing a course centred on divinity but not neglecting other subjects. Bogue also took an active part in founding the Religious Tract Society (1799), to which he contributed the first of a series of long-popular tracts, and also&#151;though less conspicuously&#151;the British and Foreign Bible Society (1804).<br>
<br>In 1790 Bogue had published <span class="italic">Reasons for Seeking a Repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts</span>. He argued consistently that religious freedom was dependent on civil liberty: initially he hailed the French Revolution with enthusiasm, seeing in it the overthrow of a Roman Catholic tyranny oppressive to protestants. In 1802 he published an <span class="italic">Essay on the Divine Authority of the New Testament</span>, which was quickly translated into French and other languages, and appeared as the preface to a French edition of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. During the brief peace of 1802 he visited France. His pacifist principles are clear in his <span class="italic">On Universal Peace, being Extracts from a Discourse Delivered in October 1813</span>, published as tract 6 of the Society for the Promotion of Permanent and Universal Peace in 1819.<br>
<br>Bogue's address at the foundation of Mill Hill School, published as <span class="italic">The Nature and Importance of a Good Education</span> (1808), demonstrated his concern for a broad Christian and liberal education. His &#145;Proposal for establishing a university for dissenters&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Christian Instructor</span>, May 1820) contributed to the subsequent foundation of University College, London.<br>
<br>Bogue's major scholarly work was his <span class="italic">History of Dissenters from the Revolution in 1688 to the Year 1808</span> (4 vols., 1808&#150;12), prepared in association with Dr James Bennett. A second edition in two volumes was issued in 1833: painstakingly researched, it was for long a standard work. It contains material which remains of value, especially on the dissenting academies and the careers of notable individuals. Written from the standpoint of moderate Calvinist evangelicals, it is polemical in places, for example in its critique of the Arminian Wesley. A major theme is concern for religious liberty&#151;that peaceable citizens should have the right to form churches &#145;which the state should neither establish nor oppress, but protect&#146;  (1.xxvi). This commitment to toleration is attested by the authors' condemnation of persecution even by regimes of which they approve, such as the reformers of Edward VI's reign, while the religious policy of William and Mary and of the early Hanoverian kings is warmly commended. Other publications included numerous sermons, his theological lectures, and articles in the <span class="italic">Evangelical Magazine</span> and other periodicals. In 1815 Yale College, Connecticut, conferred upon Bogue the degree of doctor of divinity.<br>
<br>Charlotte Bogue died on 26 February 1824; four of their seven children also predeceased him. Bogue himself died at Brighton during the course of a preaching tour on behalf of the London Missionary Society, on 25 October 1825. He was buried at Alverstoke parish church, Gosport, on 2 November.<br>
<br>Bogue was a moderate Calvinist, but relatively undogmatic as a teacher. His learning was extensive rather than profound. As a preacher he was rational&#151;even dry&#151;rather than emotional. Energetic and industrious, firm without being domineering, he was an impressive, indeed patriarchal, figure: one of the most influential Congregationalists of his time.<br>
