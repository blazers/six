<span class="headword">Fitzwarine family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1145&#150;1315), <span class="occ">landowners</span>, were a leading family on the Welsh marches. <a name="cosubject_9649"></a><span class="headword">Fulk (I) fitz Warin</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1171)<span class="occ"></span> and his brother Roger were sons of Warin de Metz (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1146). Fulk witnessed a charter of St Peter's Abbey, Shrewsbury, in 1145. He appears to have been a supporter of the Empress Matilda during the civil war of Stephen's reign, for in 1149 he received the manor of Alveston, Gloucestershire, from Henry Plantagenet and he may have been enfeoffed with land at Whittington, Shropshire, which was held by the Peverel family during Stephen's reign. In 1157 Fulk was witness to a royal charter for Malmesbury Abbey. He seems to have been a trusted follower of Henry II, who gave him 40 marks and pardoned a debt of 12<i>d</i>. in 1158, pardoned another 2 marks in 1161, and pardoned an additional 11<i>s</i>. in 1163. In addition the king gave him Whadborough, Leicestershire, in 1158. Henry entrusted Fulk with arming and provisioning Dover Castle in 1160. The children of Fulk (I) and his wife, Eva, included Fulk (II), Ralph, Richard, Warin, Alan, and William.<br>
<br>Fulk fitz Warin's eldest son and heir, <a name="cosubject_9650"></a><span class="headword">Fulk (II) Fitzwarine</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1197)<span class="occ"></span>, made a potentially advantageous marriage to Hawise de Dinan, daughter and coheir of Josce de Dinan, who had held Ludlow Castle under the Empress Matilda during Stephen's reign. This marriage may have taken place as early as 1167, certainly by 1178. Fulk (II) strove to gain control of Whittington and did win a favourable <i>curia regis</i> judgment in 1195 but could not take possession of the manor. Whittington had been held by the Welshman Roger of Powys during the reign of Henry II, and then by Roger's son Meurig for his service as an interpreter and guide. The children of Fulk (II) included Fulk (III), William, Philip, John, Alan, and Richard; on Fulk (II)'s death in 1197, he was succeeded by <a name="cosubject_9651"></a><span class="headword">Fulk (III) Fitzwarine</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1258)<span class="occ"></span>, who continued his father's quest for Whittington. He paid a fine of &pound;100 for the manor, but King John gave it instead to Meurig and, after Meurig's death, to his sons &#145;Werennoc&#146; and &#145;Wennoneo&#146; (probably garbled versions of the Welsh names Goronwy and Gwenwynwyn). Exasperated, Fulk (III) waged a guerrilla rebellion against the king between 1200 and 1203. His fifty-two adherents included his brothers William, Philip, and John, some Fitzwarine family tenants, and many younger sons of prominent Shropshire families. The king sent Hubert de Burgh with 100 knights to respond to this threat, but finally pardoned Fulk and his followers on 11 November 1203. Fulk paid 200 marks and finally received Whittington Castle in October 1204.<br>
<br>In 1207 Fulk (III) married Matilda, daughter of Robert le Vavasour and widow of Theobald Butler, who had been butler of Ireland and was brother to Archbishop Hubert Walter. Fulk assumed the fine of 1200 marks that Matilda's father had offered for royal permission for this marriage to take place. Between 1207 and 1223 Edlington in Yorkshire was the focus of a prolonged dispute between Fulk and Robert le Vavasour. Fulk accompanied the king to Ireland in 1210 and was frequently with him during the next few years, including the king's interlude in France during the summer of 1214. However, in 1215 Fulk joined the barons who were rebelling against the king, and although by February 1216 he was reconciled to the crown, mistrust of him lingered. In 1221 he was given permission to strengthen Whittington Castle, but only enough to resist the Welsh. Llywelyn ab Iorwerth (<i>d</i>. 1240), ruler of Gwynedd and the ascendant power in early thirteenth-century Wales, captured both Whittington and Fulk's castle at Alberbury in 1223 and held the latter until 1226.<br>
<br>After 1228 Fulk enjoyed Henry III's favour and confidence. In 1229 with the bishop of Hereford he escorted Llywelyn's son Dafydd and his sister to Westminster and in 1230 and 1231 he was overseas on royal business. The king gave him 500 crossbow bolts in November 1233. In July 1236 Fulk and his brother William were two of seven <i>dictatores</i> (&#145;negotiators&#146;) appointed to mediate disputes about the truce with Llywelyn. In July 1245 the king had Fulk convey the royal order to Martin, the papal nuncio, to leave England and in November Fulk was ordered to arbitrate a dispute regarding the Welsh truce. Some time between 1221 and 1226 Fulk (III) founded Alberbury Priory and gave it first to the Augustinian canons of Lilleshall and later to the order of Grandmont. In 1252 he bequeathed that his body be buried there. Fulk was very advanced in age when he died, probably during the spring or summer of 1258, and may have been blind during the final seven years of his life. His second wife was Clarice d'Auberville. Fulk (III) had two sons, <a name="cosubject_9652"></a><span class="headword">Fulk (IV) Fitzwarine</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1264)<span class="occ"></span> and Fulk Glas of Alberbury, and four daughters: Hawise, who married William Pantulf, Joan, Eva, and Mabel. Fulk (III)'s attempt to marry Fulk (IV) to Angharad, daughter of Madog ap Gruffudd of south Wales, was foiled by Llywelyn and Henry III.<br>
<br>Because of his father's great age Fulk (IV) handled the family affairs for several years before Fulk (III) died. In 1253 Fulk (IV) accompanied the king to Gascony. By now the Fitzwarines were significant marcher barons and Fulk (IV) was listed among those specifically enjoined to be intendant upon John de Gray, Hamon L'Estrange, and John (II) Fitzalan when these men were appointed to keep the Shropshire march in May, July, and August 1257 respectively. During this period Fulk (IV) had persistent disputes with Fitzalan of Oswestry and Thomas Corbet of Caus, both neighbouring Shropshire barons. Fulk (IV) supported Henry III in the barons' war and was drowned in a stream at the battle of Lewes on 14 May 1264. He left a widow, Constance, and a minor son and heir, <a name="cosubject_60935"></a><span class="headword">Fulk (V) Fitzwarine</span>  (1252?&#150;1315)<span class="occ"></span>, of whom, along with Whittington Castle, Simon de Montfort gained custody immediately after Lewes. However, after the battle of Evesham in August 1265 custody of both was given to Hamon L'Estrange, whose family held Knockin Castle adjacent to Whittington and had traditionally been allies of the Fitzwarines. Fulk (V) came of age and inherited control of his lands in 1273.<br>
<br>The romance <span class="italic">Fouke le Fitzwarin</span> is now extant only in an early fourteenth-century manuscript, &#145;Fouke le Fitz Waryn&#146;, but was probably composed during the period 1258&#150;65, or perhaps a little later. The author displays detailed local knowledge of the Whittington and Ludlow districts of Shropshire. This work conflates the careers of Fulk (I) and Fulk (II), is confused about many twelfth-century events, and focuses most of its attention on the long and remarkable career of Fulk (III). The romance alleges that Fulk was a playmate of the young Prince John and quarrelled with him while playing chess. It is mistaken in calling Fulk (III) &#145;warden&#146; of the march (<i>gardeyn de tote la Marche</i>), for no such office existed during the early thirteenth century, although various border barons and others were appointed to &#145;keep&#146; the march on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis when circumstances required such special military commanders. While mistaken on some facts, however, <span class="italic">Fouke le Fitzwarin</span> presumably reflects the pretensions and aspirations of the Fitzwarines during the last portion of Henry III's reign.<br>
