<span class="headword">Hutt,  (George) Allen</span>  (1901&#150;1973), <span class="occ">journalist and political activist</span>, was born at 57 Harvist Road, Willesden, London, on 20 September 1901, the son of Edwin George Wellington Hutt, a commercial clerk and later general manager in the paper industry, and his wife, Marion de Witt, a headmistress. He was educated at Kilburn grammar school and at Downing College, Cambridge, where he gained a first in the history tripos in 1923.<br>
<br>By this time Hutt was a committed Marxist. In its latter stages he was &#145;vehemently&#146; opposed to the First World War, and at Cambridge he was active in the university socialist society, eventually becoming the national secretary of the communist-dominated University Socialist Federation. Briefly, in 1920&#150;21, he was a member of the Independent Labour Party, but it was his adhesion to the Communist Party in 1922 that set the course for the rest of his political life.<br>
<br>Equally fateful in professional terms was Hutt's recruitment to the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span>, then a congenial home for communists, in 1923. Through a paternal lineage of master printers, Hutt took pride in a family involvement in the publishing industry dating from the seventeenth century. Combining political commitment with exacting professional standards, he was a priceless asset to a left-wing press disproportionately endowed with only the first of these. In addition to the <span class="italic">Herald</span>, he worked on or for the communist <span class="italic">Workers' Weekly</span>; the Soviet news agency TASS; Palme Dutt's <span class="italic">Labour Monthly</span>, which he briefly claimed to edit &#145;in fact if not in name&#146;; and <span class="italic">Trade Union Unity</span>, a short-lived venture of TUC &#145;lefts&#146; like A. A. Purcell for which Hutt functioned as a self-designated &#145;factotum&#146;  (Hutt to Karl August, 29 Dec 1925, Hutt papers, People's History Museum, Manchester). These trade union contacts were reflected in his first book <span class="italic">Communism and Coal</span> (1928), a collaboration with Arthur Horner, and a voluminous correspondence with the Fife miners' leader David Proudfoot.<br>
<br>After a spell at the International Lenin School and two years as chief sub-editor at the newly launched <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span> (1930&#150;32), Hutt produced a series of books on British working-class politics, most of them developing historical narratives which seemingly culminated inexorably in the current policy of the Communist Party. Perhaps the best of them, however, was <span class="italic">The Condition of the Working Class in Britain</span> (1933), an early example of the decade's committed documentary style, revealing a flair for the investigative side of journalism as well as its technical aspects.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, it was to the latter that Hutt owed a reputation extending well beyond the left. In 1936 he joined the co-operative-owned <span class="italic">Reynolds News</span> as chief assistant to the editor with a special brief for the paper's redesign. Six years later he rejoined the <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span>, then being relaunched after a temporary wartime ban. These were halcyon days for British communists, and much of their optimism for the post-war world was focused on the prospect of the &#145;new&#146; <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span> that, from its own distinct perspective, would match the best that Fleet Street had to offer. Hutt as chief sub-editor made perhaps the outstanding contribution to such a goal, turning &#145;a squad of unqualified and in some cases poorly qualified people into journalists&#146;  (MacEwen, 109). Famously rude&#151;the paper's editor, William Rust, likened him to &#145;a combination of a dragon and a porcupine&#146;&#151;he nevertheless earned the tremendous respect of both his colleagues and his profession. While the <span class="italic">Worker</span>'s circulation figures never matched expectations, and from the late 1940s declined steadily, the paper won prestigious awards for newspaper design, and Hutt himself gained the rare distinction of being named a royal designer for industry. His book <span class="italic">Newspaper Design</span> (1960), a summation of his technical experience, cemented the high professional regard in which he was held.<br>
<br>For a quarter of a century from 1946 Hutt also sat on the executive of the National Union of Journalists and edited its monthly paper <span class="italic">The Journalist</span>. Here too he achieved high honour when in 1967 he was made the union's president. If he had a great frustration, it was that on the <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span> the positions of editor and assistant editor were the preserve of leading communist functionaries, politically dependable but often unpractised in journalism. When these posts were filled in this fashion on Rust's untimely death in 1949, Hutt was driven by the &#145;most bitter disappointment and humiliation&#146; to consider his resignation  (draft statement, 14 Feb 1949, Hutt papers, People's History Museum, Manchester). Through finesse or party discipline he was persuaded to change his mind, and he remained with the paper until his retirement in 1966. That same year, to his fervent dismay and contempt, the paper changed its name to the <span class="italic">Morning Star</span>.<br>
<br>Both the issue and the reaction were typical. A disciplined communist not known to have had any major disagreements with the party line, Hutt was nevertheless fiercely independent on the matters which he knew best. He married three times, in each case to an active communist, and left children by both his first marriage, to Norma, and his second, to Sheena. He died of cancer at his home, 8 Regent's Park Terrace, Camden, London, on 10 August 1973; his third wife, Avis, a nurse, survived him.<br>
