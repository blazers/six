<span class="headword">Martin,  Paul Augustus</span>  (1864&#150;1944), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born on 16 April 1864 in Herbeuville, France, to a local farming family, his father, Jean Baptiste Martin, being a mill and vineyard owner. When his childhood home was destroyed in 1869 by the hostilities of the Franco-Prussian War, his family was forced to relocate in Paris, but in turn they were trapped there during the siege and the brutal commune of 1871. Having barely survived, the family fled to London in 1872, where they settled in without further difficulty. After attending St Mark's College in Chelsea, Martin studied at the &Eacute;cole Gosserez at Ch&acirc;lons-sur-Marne, France, from 1878. In 1880 he was apprenticed to the London wood-engraver M. Douet and did so well that he stayed with him for six years. In 1886 he moved to the Fleet Street firm of R. and E. Taylor. The public had a voracious appetite for the woodcuts filling the popular press and for some years Martin was a skilled practitioner in this active industry.<br>
<br>When he was ten years old Martin had purchased a packet of materials to &#145;make your own photographs&#146;, and he produced simple cyanotypes of leaves and other objects by contact. By 1884 he was able to afford a camera and began practising as one of the new wave of amateur photographers. In the first decades of photography most of the sensitive materials had to be made by the photographer himself, often immediately before use. An already costly hobby was made prohibitively expensive to most working people simply because they did not have sufficient leisure time to practise it. With the widespread introduction of packaged factory-made plates and paper in the 1880s, it became possible to take photographs in odd moments and on the occasional bank holiday. Martin's early work was generally a record of outings he had taken with friends, and he became active in the camera clubs and in amateur exhibitions.<br>
<br>In 1892 Martin acquired one of the new breed of so-called &#145;detective&#146; cameras. Most of these were novelties, inspired by literature and disguised in various ways. His bulky Facile plate camera was wrapped in paper to look like a parcel of books. Held under an arm, it permitted the taking of candid &#145;snap-shots&#146; (a term applied by Sir John Herschel) with relatively short exposures. Martin's world was that of the working person and it was to this world that he turned for subjects. He was never a voyeur, but by not calling particular attention to the act of photographing he was able to inject real life into his images. Many of his pictures were taken while running errands in the Fleet Street area. Others were taken on bank holidays, in the public parks, and on excursions.<br>
<br>Martin's mechanical ingenuity greatly improved his simple camera and allowed him to photograph under conditions previously thought impossible. In 1896 he was awarded the royal medal by the Royal Photographic Society for his series of <span class="roman">London by Gaslight</span> photographs (now in the collection of the Royal Photographic Society at the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, Bradford). Taken at dusk with a mixture of twilight and the novel new gas-lighting, the series presented an image of urban life previously unrecorded by photography. A measure of its impact at the time is the fact that his night views beat out another new type of imaging introduced in 1896&#151;the R&ouml;ntgen rays. He was invited to show his work at the exhibitions of the pioneering art-photography group the Linked Ring Brotherhood (though he was never a member), and he supplied images to the Eastman Kodak Company to use in their advertising. He was in constant demand as a speaker and a judge to camera clubs and exhibited widely.<br>
<br>Even as Martin's reputation in the world of amateur photography was growing ever greater, his hobby was beginning to undermine his livelihood. The demand for woodcuts began to shrink near the end of the century as photomechanical processes became more common. He declined George Davison's offer in 1899 to join the Kodak firm as he had heard that their prospects were &#145;none too rosy&#146;, a decision he was later to regret bitterly. He had already completed arrangements to enter into partnership with H. G. Dorrett, a fellow amateur, and left wood-engraving to set up as a photographer to supply the press. In this highly competitive and rapidly evolving area he was never successful, and the firm eventually did most of its trade in making lowly photographic buttons.<br>
<br>Martin married Clara Emily Ackary (<i>b</i>. 1867/8) on 20 October 1900; they had two sons. He continued to photograph for exhibition, often during family holiday trips, but more and more came to recognize just how special his 1890s work with the Facile camera had been. In retirement he once again became an active lecturer: with his enormous moustache and ample supply of lantern-slides depicting the end of the century, he was widely known. Although he had never been successful as a press photographer, he now found he had a steady demand from publishers wanting accurate and lively views of days gone by. In 1937 Beaumont Newhall included his work in his pioneering photohistorical exhibition &#145;Photography, 1839&#150;1937&#146;. In 1939 his work was featured in the &#145;Centenary of photography&#146; exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. That same year he published his autobiography, <span class="italic">Victorian Snapshots</span>.<br>
<br>With the advent of the Second World War Martin lost his opportunity to appear before camera clubs. His death at 55 Hosack Road, Balham, London, on 7 July 1944 went unnoticed in the press; he was buried in Morden cemetery, London, on 12 July. The turmoil of the blitz very nearly destroyed his photographic legacy; however, nearly a thousand of his lantern-slides and press-prints were rescued from commercial files by Helmut and Alison Gernsheim and are now at the University of Texas at Austin. The photographic historian Brian Coe discovered the remains of Martin's work for Kodak sitting in a barrel ready for silver recycling: these now form part of the Kodak Collection in the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television at Bradford. Meticulously kept personal albums, mostly of platinum prints, were preserved by his family and are now in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Quite by chance the contents of an auctioned tea trolley yielded many of his exhibition negatives and prints and they are now preserved in the archives of the Royal Photographic Society, held at the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television. Although he was not a social documentarian by intent, Martin's photographs are among the finest records of late nineteenth-century society, and particularly urban working-class life. He had lived and worked in England most of his life but never obtained citizenship.<br>
