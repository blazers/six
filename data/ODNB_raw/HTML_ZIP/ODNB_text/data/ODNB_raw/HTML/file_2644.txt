<span class="headword">Blewitt,  Jonathan</span>  (1782&#150;1853), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 19 July 1782 in London, the son of the organist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2643/', "Jonas Blewitt (1757&#150;1805)")</script>. He was educated by his father and his godfather, Jonathan Battishill (1738&#150;1801), and he is also said to have received some instruction from Haydn. At the age of eleven he acted as deputy to his father, and thereafter held several appointments as an organist in London. He was also successively organist of Haverhill, Suffolk, and of Brecon, where he remained for three years. About 1808 he returned to London for the production of an opera he had written for Drury Lane, but the theatre burnt down in February 1809, before the work was produced. Blewitt next went to Sheffield, and from there proceeded in 1811 to Ireland, where he acted as private organist to Lord Cahir. His piano sonata <span class="italic">The Battle and Victory of Salamanca</span> appeared in 1812. He became organist of St Andrew's, Dublin, succeeded Tom Cooke in June 1813 as composer and director of the music at the Theatre Royal, Crow Street, and was appointed grand organist to the masonic body of Ireland by the duke of Leinster. An active conductor in Dublin, Blewitt also joined J. B. Logier when he introduced his system of music instruction into Ireland; he became a very successful teacher in his own right, and published in Dublin a treatise on singing and <span class="italic">An Epitome of the Logierian System of Harmony</span>. About 1825 he was back in London, and began the long series of pantomime compositions, musical plays, and light operas with which his name was connected for the rest of his life. For over twenty-five years he wrote music for most of the London theatres, and his last work, the pantomime <span class="italic">Harlequin Hudibras</span>, was brought out at Drury Lane on 27 December 1852. In 1828 and 1829 he was director of music at Sadler's Wells Theatre, and he was also, at different times, music director at Vauxhall and at the Tivoli Gardens, Margate, and pianist for the Vocal Entertainments run by the tenor John Templeton, with whom he revisited Ireland in 1849. He wrote hundreds of vocal pieces, most of them comic songs and ballads in the Irish style, which were particularly popular, the best-known at the time being <span class="italic">Barney Brallaghan</span> (a selective list of works is given in <span class="italic">New Grove</span>). In his latter years Blewitt sank into great poverty and suffered from a &#145;painful internal disease&#146;  (<span class="italic">MT</span>). He died on 4 September 1853 in London, and was buried at St Pancras. He left a widow and two daughters.<br>
