<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Flew,  (Robert) Newton</span>  (1886&#150;1962), <span class="occ">Methodist minister and theologian</span>, was born on 25 May 1886 in Holsworthy, Devon, the elder son of the Revd Josiah Flew (1859&#150;1925), Wesleyan Methodist minister, and his wife, Florence Jones (1863&#150;1964). The family's home was originally in Portland, Dorset, but Wesleyan ministry took them to Wiltshire and Warwickshire before they settled finally in London suburbs. In 1897 Flew won a scholarship to Christ's Hospital, from where he was awarded a classical postmastership at Merton College, Oxford. Here he had a distinguished academic career, reading both classics and theology and subsequently being awarded several theological prizes. In 1909 he spent a term studying in Bonn and Marburg, where he came under the influence of Wilhelm Herrman and Adolf J&uuml;licher.<br>
<br>During his Oxford course Flew had decided to follow his father into the Wesleyan Methodist ministry. He was invited to act as assistant tutor in theology and classics at Handsworth College, Birmingham, while completing his own training for ministry. In 1913 he began a five-year circuit ministry in Winchmore Hill in north London. During this time he was given leave of absence to use a travelling scholarship to make two extended study visits (despite the war) to Switzerland and Italy, where he made his first ecumenical friendships with Roman Catholics. Before the war ended in 1918 he had volunteered to undertake a naval chaplaincy. The armistice had already been signed when he set sail for Mesopotamia, where he remained for eighteen months. From there he moved to India to teach at the United Theological College in Bangalore for another eighteen months.<br>
<br>In July 1921, a few weeks after his return home, Flew married Winifred Garrard (1887&#150;1982), a teacher and Wesleyan Methodist. The couple had a son, and Flew spent the following six years in circuit ministry in London. During these years the foundations of his ecumenical commitment were laid, through both friendship and scholarship. In the London Society for the Study of Religion he met the Roman Catholic theologian Baron von H&uuml;gel, who encouraged him in the study of spirituality which was to result in <span class="italic">The Idea of Perfection in Christian Theology</span> (1934), a work which earned him the Oxford DD in 1930; he was the first nonconformist to gain this degree by examination.<br>
<br>In 1927 Flew's academic achievements had already led to his being appointed to the Greenhalgh chair of <span class="roman">New Testament</span> language and literature at Wesley House, Cambridge, a college founded in 1921. Its new buildings had just been opened in 1926. Cambridge was to be Flew's home for the rest of his life. After ten years as tutor, he was appointed principal of Wesley House, a post he held until his retirement in 1955, exercising a profound influence on a whole generation of students. From the outset Wesley House had accepted Primitive and United Methodists as well as Wesleyan Methodist students, and Flew helped the new united Methodist church after 1932 to deepen its understanding of the church and churchmanship. His book <span class="italic">Jesus and his Church</span> (1938) was based on the Fernley-Hartley lecture delivered to the Methodist conference in 1938, and went through several editions. He was a respected and influential member of the Cambridge faculty of divinity.<br>
<br>Flew's influence spread far beyond Cambridge. He was elected moderator of the Free Church Federal Council for the year 1945&#150;6, and president of the Methodist conference in the year immediately following. While firmly rooted in Wesleyan Methodism, he grew to love and appreciate other Christian traditions and to long for a deeper unity with them, and the main focus of his scholarly work moved from spirituality to the doctrine of the church. He was a member of the Friends of Reunion and a firm supporter of the proposed Church of South India. He was one of the group of nonconformists appointed to respond to Archbishop Fisher's Cambridge sermon of November 1946 calling for new moves towards unity. He chaired the group which produced <span class="italic">The Catholicity of Protestantism</span> (edited jointly by Flew and Rupert Davies, 1950) in response to an Anglo-Catholic work entitled <span class="italic">Catholicity</span>; both were intended to aid ecumenical conversations.<br>
<br>At the same time Flew was active on the international ecumenical stage. In 1934 he was appointed as a Methodist member of the World Faith and Order Continuation Committee set up at the Lausanne conference in 1927; this led to his being appointed as a delegate to both the life and work conference in Oxford and the faith and order conference in Edinburgh in 1937 (both forerunners of the World Council of Churches). After the war he was appointed vice-chairman of the provisional committee of the World Council of Churches, and he was recognized as a leading figure at the inauguration of the council in Amsterdam in 1948. As chairman of the faith and order commission on the church, he edited a volume entitled <span class="italic">The Nature of the Church</span> in preparation for the second meeting of the World Council of Churches at Lund in 1952. During all these years he maintained his lifelong interest in sport, especially cricket.<br>
<br>Flew remained in Cambridge in retirement, editing the <span class="italic">London Quarterly and Holborn Review</span> and preparing his book <span class="italic">Jesus and his Way</span>, published posthumously in 1963. One of his last public acts was to support the inauguration of Anglican&#150;Methodist conversations at the Methodist conference in 1955. He died in Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, after a fall, on 10 September 1962, his mother's ninety-ninth birthday.<br>
