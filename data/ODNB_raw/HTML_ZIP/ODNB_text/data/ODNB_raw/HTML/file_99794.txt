<span class="headword">Calder,  Angus Lindsay Ritchie</span>  (1942&#150;2008), <span class="occ">historian and literary critic</span>, was born at Cedar Court Nursing Home, Sutton, Surrey, on 5 February 1942, the second son and third of the five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30891/', "Peter Ritchie Calder, later Baron Ritchie-Calder (1906&#150;1982)")</script>, journalist and author, and his wife, Mabel Jane Forbes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McKail (1906&#150;2001). Educated at Wallington county grammar school and King's College, Cambridge, where he read English literature, he was active in student politics and, like his father, a socialist and supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. On 1 October 1963 he married Jennifer Rachel (Jenni) Daiches (<i>b</i>. 1941), historian and literary scholar, and daughter of the literary historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95922/', "David Daiches")</script>. They lived at first in London, where Calder completed a PhD thesis on the wartime Common Wealth Party under the supervision of Asa Briggs at the University of Sussex. He was also at work on <span class="italic">The People's War: Britain, 1939&#150;1945</span> (1969), a prodigiously researched narrative that challenged conventional accounts of unity and solidarity on the home front.<br>
<br>Published to widespread acclaim, <span class="italic">The People's War</span> would have guaranteed Calder a full-time academic career if he had wanted one. He opted instead for the life of a freelance, living off the proceeds of literary work and occasional teaching jobs. After three years (1968&#150;71) during which he and Jenni taught at the University of Nairobi, they set up home in Edinburgh with their children, a boy and two girls. In 1979 Calder was appointed staff tutor in arts at the Open University in Scotland, a role well suited to his romantic socialist convictions. An inspirational tutor and lecturer, he journeyed far and wide meeting tutors and students, but took early retirement in 1993 with the title of reader in cultural studies. &#145;It seems clear to me&#146;, he wrote in 2003, &#145;that every child should be encouraged to deviate as far as possible from careerist norms&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gods, Mongrels and Demons</span>, 4).<br>
<br>In 1971 Calder embarked on another <i>magnum opus</i>, a one-volume history of the British empire. It soon expanded into a proposal for three volumes, of which the first, <span class="italic">Revolutionary Empire: the Rise of the English-speaking Empires from the 15th Century to the 1780s</span>, was published in 1981. A dazzling blend of stupendous research, narrative art, and provocative argument, enriched by his own travels to parts of the former empire, it was probably his most important book, but the response was appreciative rather than enthusiastic: imperial topics lacked the emotional resonance of the home front. Having twice climbed an academic Everest, Calder may perhaps have lacked the stamina for another ascent. At any rate the second and third volumes never appeared and his writing increasingly took the form of essays and shorter works.<br>
<br>History was only ever one component of Calder's literary life. A prominent literary critic, editor, and commentator, he wrote a history of Russian fiction from Pushkin to Chekhov, a study of Byron and Scotland, and luminous introductions to classics by Sir Walter Scott, Charles Dickens, and Evelyn Waugh. An enthusiast for the post-colonial literature of Africa and the Caribbean, he co-edited the <span class="italic">Journal of Commonwealth Literature</span> from 1981 to 1987. The Scottish strands in his work, always present, multiplied in response to the cultural debates stimulated by the rise of nationalism. He co-edited three volumes of the uncollected writings of Hugh MacDiarmid and published two collections of essays on the myths and realities of Scottishness: <span class="italic">Revolving Culture: Notes from the Scottish Republic</span> (1994) and <span class="italic">Scotlands of the Mind</span> (2002). Politically he described himself as a &#145;socialist home ruler&#146;  (<span class="italic">Revolving Culture</span>, vii).<br>
<br>Calder was contemptuous of Thatcherite values but generous in the range of his sympathy for individuals, which transcended ideology. Rebels, romantics, and oddballs all commanded his interest and admiration. Intellectually he towered above most of his contemporaries but his modesty was genuine. In his own estimation he probably never matched up to the exacting standards he set himself. Nor was he entirely confident of his identity as a Scot or his credentials as a man of the people. In <span class="italic">The Myth of the Blitz</span> (1990) he revised <span class="italic">The People's War</span> by deconstructing what he saw as an English national myth of 1940. In a sense the book was an apology for his English upbringing and accent and relatively privileged background. &#145;All your life&#146;, wrote his friend Joy Hendry, &#145;you longed to wrench the shining spoon of privilege from your mouth &hellip; to know the sweat and strain of workers in the fields and factories and to sing the songs in their hearts&#146;  (Berengarten and Calder, 51).<br>
<br>Calder suffered bouts of depression which he relieved with alcohol, cigarettes, and the camaraderie of the pub. His growing dependence on drink contributed to the break-up of his first marriage in 1982. On 19 December 1986 he married Catherine Janet (Kate) Kyle, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Young (<i>b</i>. 1949), a schoolteacher, and daughter of William Young, a scientific and technical officer in the Ministry of Defence. They had one son. Eventually, however, his second marriage also broke up and Calder opted for a bohemian existence in a city centre flat whence he could sally forth to the theatres, bookshops, and howffs of Tollcross. Sadly his descent into alcoholism continued and plunged him into predicaments from which he had to be rescued by long-suffering friends, but something of his old creativity remained.<br>
<br>Ever since Cambridge Calder had written and published occasional verse, and he was one of the prime movers in the establishment of the Scottish Poetry Library in 1984. Poetry was his spiritual home: in the company of his fellow &#145;makars&#146;, with a bottle of malt whisky to hand, he was halfway to paradise. The publication in 1997 of a collection of his poems, <span class="italic">Waking in Waikato</span>, marked a late flowering in the course of which he published another four volumes of verse. <span class="italic">Horace in Tollcross</span> (2000), an updating of the <span class="roman">Odes</span> of Horace, gave enduring expression to his caustic wit, his most tender feelings, and his reaffirmation of life in the shadow of his approaching death. In 2007 he suffered a loss of short-term memory and in 2008 he was diagnosed with lung cancer and transferred to the Elsie Inglis Nursing Home in Spring Gardens, Edinburgh. &#145;It's been a helter-skelter existence&#146;, he told one of his visitors, &#145;and mainly my own fault&#146;  (private information). He died in the nursing home on 5 June 2008 and was survived by his four children.<br>
