<span class="headword">Tiedeman,  May Louise  Seaton-</span>  (1864?&#150;1948), <span class="occ">campaigner for divorce law reform</span>, was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the daughter of Alfred Herbert Seaton, an export merchant and lay preacher. She claimed descent from Scottish Presbyterians on one side of her family and from English Anglicans on the other. The Seaton family moved from America to England when she was in her teens. On 5 January 1886 she married Frederick Henry Lewis Tiedeman (1847&#150;1915), a Dutch journalist and editor of the <span class="italic">Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant</span>; they had one son, Henry Seaton Tiedeman. Although the couple were based in London they travelled around the world and had a wide circle of friends, including many writers, politicians, and social reformers. May Tiedeman's happy marriage of thirty years ended with her husband's death in 1915; within the year, on 31 July 1916, she married Edward Woolf Abrams (1865&#150;1945), a metal mining agent and a long-time family friend. This marriage also lasted nearly thirty years, ending only with Abrams's death in 1945.<br>
<br>May Seaton-Tiedeman's role in the divorce law reform campaign of the inter-war years has been overlooked because the organization of which she was honorary secretary, the Divorce Law Reform Union, left few traces in the history books. This is partly owing to the fact that most of its records were destroyed during the Second World War. A more significant reason is that, despite the union's best efforts, its primary contribution to divorce reform was as a resource centre, drafting and promoting bills for parliamentary allies, rather than as a high-profile mass-membership pressure group: accordingly, the union did not receive any public recognition when its central object, the enactment of reform based on the recommendations of the 1909&#150;12 royal commission on divorce and matrimonial causes, was achieved with the passage of A. P. Herbert's <span class="roman">Matrimonial Causes Bill</span> in 1937.<br>
<br>As a courageous and indefatigable campaigner Seaton-Tiedeman was the driving force behind the Divorce Law Reform Union, rather than its famous figureheads such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Lord Birkenhead. Herbert described her as a &#145;brave fighter [who] had been at it for I know not how many years, speaking in Hyde Park on Sundays, lobbying the House of Commons and all the time keeping her little Union alive with hardly any resources&#146;  (Herbert, 73). As the union's primary propagandist she was the editor of its quarterly paper, <span class="italic">The Journal</span>, which was published from 1919 to 1931. She was not motivated by personal experience of an unhappy marriage, but rather by her belief that immorality, injustice, and unnecessary human suffering were not to be tolerated. A member of the Ethical Union, her secular humanism found its fullest expression in the divorce reform movement not least because the primary ideology of opponents of reform was Christianity; for her the extension of matrimonial jurisdiction was as important as the extension of the divorce grounds themselves. She therefore advocated the establishment of courts of domestic relations, and in 1925 submitted evidence to a lord chancellor's committee set up to investigate the working of the poor persons' rules, devised to assist litigants with low incomes to pursue divorce petitions in the High Court.<br>
<br>Despite her membership of the World League for Sexual Reform on a Scientific Basis, May Seaton-Tiedeman was not a libertarian; indeed, in many ways she was a conservative reformer. She did not believe that sexual relations were solely a private concern, and she wished to see legal marriage become coterminous with a loving relationship, thereby ending society's tolerance of promiscuity and non-marital unions. This led her to campaign for the abolition of permanent legal separation and the extension of fault-based divorce grounds: although she believed that divorce should be permissible on the ground of incompatibility of temperament, she remained hostile to divorce being granted on the ground of mutual consent.<br>
<br>May Seaton-Tiedeman campaigned for further divorce law reforms after 1937, but retired during the Second World War. She moved first to Hove and then to London to be with her son, before dying at Friern Hospital, New Southgate, Middlesex, on 22 October 1948. She was cremated privately on 26 October.<br>
