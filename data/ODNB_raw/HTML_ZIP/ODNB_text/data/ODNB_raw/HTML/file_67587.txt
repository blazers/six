<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hutchison,  Robert  Gemmell</span>  (1855&#150;1936), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 1 July 1855, the oldest son of George Hutchison (<i>b</i>. 1830), brass founder, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Forman (<i>b</i>. 1829). He was not academically inclined and left school at a young age to be apprenticed to a seal engraver. His artistic talent was evident by the age of seventeen and his mother encouraged him to pursue a career as a painter. He trained at the government art school in Edinburgh (formerly known as the Trustees' Academy) and also received guidance from the artist James Campbell Noble (1846&#150;1913). His first studio was at 1 India Buildings in Edinburgh, where he was established by 1878. In the same year he had three pictures accepted for the annual exhibition of the Royal Scottish Academy, where he exhibited annually until his death. On 24 June 1879 he married Janet (<i>b</i>. 1857), daughter of James Boe, grocer, of Biggar. They had four daughters and two sons (one of whom died in infancy).<br>
<br>Gemmell Hutchison began painting views of the Fife coast, but he soon turned to genre painting, producing sentimental scenes of Scottish rural life, very much in the spirit of the Faed brothers. His d&eacute;but at the Royal Academy of Arts, London, in 1880 was a work entitled <span class="italic">The Empty Cradle</span> and thereafter he began to specialize in images of children and childhood. His first success was with <span class="italic">Boys Guddling Trout</span>, which was awarded a prize at the Royal Scottish Academy exhibition of 1886 and was purchased by the Royal Association for the Promotion of the Fine Arts in Scotland. He exhibited at the Royal Glasgow Institute for the Fine Arts from 1888 onwards, enjoying immediate commercial success, and by the end of the 1890s he had patrons in Scotland, Manchester, and London. His best-known works from this period include <span class="italic">The Gundy Man</span> (1897; McManus Galleries, Dundee) and <span class="italic">Village Carnival</span> (1898; priv. coll.), which was bought by Sir Edward Moss, the British theatre impresario. As a mark of his early success Gemmell Hutchison was elected an associate of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1901, along with Edward Atkinson Hornel and William Walls. In 1903 he exhibited for the first time at the Paris Salon. His only submission, <span class="italic">Bairnies Cuddle Doon</span>, was inspired by the poetry of Alexander Anderson, who wrote in the Scots vernacular under the pen name Surfaceman. The picture won a third-class medal and was purchased by the Scottish Modern Arts Association.<br>
<br>In 1905 Gemmell Hutchison moved to Musselburgh, a coastal village to the east of Edinburgh. In the same year, perhaps prompted by a large exhibition of Dutch Hague school art in London, he made his first trip to the Netherlands, working at Volendam in North Holland. He greatly admired the work of the Hague school, and paintings like <span class="italic">Idyll on the Shore</span> (1907), one of his earliest works to depict young children playing on the foreshore, show the direct influence of Jozef Isra&euml;ls, whose pictures were widely collected and exhibited in Scotland. Some of Gemmell Hutchison's later paintings&#151;for example <span class="italic">Sea Urchins</span>, exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1928&#151;even appear to take their titles directly from the Dutch artist, and in later life Gemmell Hutchison was often referred to as the Scottish Isra&euml;ls.<br>
<br>After returning to Scotland Gemmell Hutchison worked at Carnoustie on the Forfarshire coast, painting in the open air and developing a looser technique and lighter palette. Works from this period include <span class="italic">Seagulls and Sapphire Seas</span> (1909; Bolton Art Gallery), <span class="italic">The Breezy Bents</span> (1910), and <span class="italic">A Song of the Sea</span> (1912). An important influence on his developing style was the work of the Scottish artist William McTaggart. From the mid-1880s onwards McTaggart had been working in a broadly impressionist style, painting out of doors at Machrihanish on the Argyll coast, and Gemmell Hutchison followed his example.<br>
<br>McTaggart died in 1910 and in the following year Gemmell Hutchison was elected in his place as a full member of the Royal Scottish Academy. In the same year he was commissioned to paint the coronation of George V and Queen Mary at Westminster Abbey, for reproduction as a photogravure. In 1912 he moved back to Edinburgh and settled at 8 St Bernard's Crescent and in the next year he submitted his diploma picture, <span class="italic">Shifting Shadows</span> (Royal Scot. Acad.). This was a large impressionist canvas, painted in the open air, depicting a maid hanging out washing on a breezy day. In the early summer of 1914 Gemmell Hutchison was again working in the Netherlands and he also exhibited at the Paris Salon. His submission for that year, <span class="italic">L'oeuvre du pass&eacute;</span>, was stranded in France at the outbreak of the First World War.<br>
<br>During and after the war Gemmell Hutchison continued to paint out of doors in the summer months, working mostly at Carnoustie, where he had a cottage, but also at Machrihanish, Easthaven in Forfarshire, and on the Farne Islands. He also painted interior scenes and in 1928 he won a gold medal at the Paris Salon for <span class="italic">The White Seam</span> (Paisley Museum and Art Gallery), which was bought by Paisley corporation. In the 1930s he spent the summers at his daughter's house at Coldingham, Berwickshire, and painted at St Abbs on the Berwickshire coast. He died at Coldingham on 22 August 1936, and was buried in Dean cemetery, Edinburgh, on the 26th. His son George Jackson Hutchison (1896&#150;1918), a talented artist specializing in pastoral scenes and animals, was killed in action at Merville, France, six months before the end of the First World War. His daughter (Marion) Maud Gemmell Hutchison (1886&#150;1963) also painted still lifes and coastal scenes.<br>
<br>Gemmell Hutchison was described by contemporaries as &#145;a man of strongly individual and forceful personality&#146;, possessing &#145;a vigour of manner and expression which was arresting and often amusing&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 24 Aug 1936). His output was prodigious and he reputedly listed his recreational interests as &#145;work&#146;. His pictures of children playing on the shore remain as popular as they were during his lifetime and it is not surprising that he is represented in numerous British collections, both private and public.<br>
