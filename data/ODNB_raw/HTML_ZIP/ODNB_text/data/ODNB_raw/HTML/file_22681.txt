<span class="headword">Poyer,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1649), <span class="occ">merchant and army officer</span>, was a Welshman from near Narberth in Pembrokeshire. About 1640 he was both a wealthy merchant regularly trading with Bristol and an industrial entrepreneur who claimed to employ &#145;more poor &hellip; in making cloth than any other man in those parts&#146;  (Leach, 44). Having become mayor of Pembroke in 1641&#150;2, he effectively continued in office for another six years, usurping the position of his successor. Aided by what some of his local enemies described as &#145;a loose rabble of the meaner sort&#146;, he also took possession of Pembroke Castle  (<span class="italic">A Declaration of Divers Gentlemen &hellip;</span>, April 1648, BL, E436/7, 2).<br>
<br>In 1642 Poyer was prominent in staying ships and arresting Catholics bound to and from Ireland. He was once detained for staying two ships bound for Galway, but was quickly released on 27 June by order of the House of Commons. Under Poyer's rule Pembroke survived several royalist sieges and blockades during the first civil war. In 1643 he lost one of his own ships in a vain attempt to acquaint the lord admiral the earl of Warwick with Pembroke's plight. However, he did at least frustrate the threat of the earl of Carbery's soldiers to roll him into Milford Haven in a barrel of nails, and in March 1644 he succeeded in capturing Carew Castle. This apparent triumph was later to occasion charges from his local enemies that he had illegally appropriated to himself some revenues of its demesne. Carew Castle was to be retaken by the royalists in May 1645 as part of a spectacular campaign by Sir Charles Gerrard which was again to put Pembroke at risk. Poyer was later to maintain that he had impoverished himself by personally financing the defence of Pembroke Castle though his critics averred that this had been done out of the sale of confiscated ships and goods and other exactions. Be this as it may, Poyer's petition for reimbursement was sympathetically received in February 1647 by the House of Lords and recommended&#151;apparently unavailingly&#151;to the attentions of the lower house. For all his grievances, Poyer played no part in the insurgency in south Wales in the summer of 1647 and it was not until the following year that the resentment which he shared with Major-General Rowland Laugharne, exacerbated by the projected disbandment of the parliamentary forces in south Wales, boiled over into active revolt.<br>
<br>In February 1648 Sir Thomas Fairfax's suspicions about Poyer's intentions impelled him to send down Colonel Fleming to replace him as governor of Pembroke Castle. Poyer's refusal to co-operate unless paid what he claimed to be due to him and his soldiers produced an ultimatum at the beginning of March that he hand over the castle within twelve hours on pain of being declared a traitor. Poyer's response was decisive; sallying forth from the castle he routed Fleming's force, some of whom he captured along with artillery pieces brought to subdue the castle. Having raised more men at a muster on 9 April, Poyer now moved to Carmarthen to join forces temporarily with Colonel Rice Powell. Their combined force was estimated at between 3000 and 4000 men, many of them, if Poyer's opponents are to be believed, reluctant and ill-armed conscripts. Poyer's and Powell's increasingly pro-royalist stance is evidenced by their appeal to the prince of Wales  (<span class="italic">Powells and Poyers Letter to the Prince of Wales</span>, April 1648, BL, E436/14). But while this produced a favourable response from the prince, it seems to have cut little ice with the Welsh royalist &eacute;lite who despised Poyer in particular as a plundering social upstart. As a letter of early April puts it, &#145;not many Gentlemen of note or Men of Estates &hellip; come in to Poyer or &hellip; give him any visible Countenance&#146;  (Rushworth, 7.1051). To such gentlemen the aims of these roundhead renegades amounted to no more than &#145;the advancement of their owne wretched &amp; mechanick ambitions&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Declaration &hellip; of Col. John Poyer</span>, May 1648, BL, E441/6, 3), a view not notably different from that of a parliamentary news sheet of mid-January which describes Poyer as standing &#145;neither for the king, parliament or army, but his own interest and free booting&#146;  (<span class="italic">Heads of Chiefe Passages in Parliament</span>, no. 2, 12&#150;19 Jan 1648, BL, E423/11, 12). In pursuit of these ends he regularly dispatched his so-called &#145;bullies&#146; to plunder the cattle and property &#145;of any Gentlemen he bore a spleen to&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Declaration of Divers Gentlemen &hellip;</span>, BL, E436/7, 3).<br>
<br>As for his religion, Poyer was described as &#145;a stiffe maintainer of the <span class="roman">Booke of Common Prayer</span>&#146;, which he and Powell declared to be &#145;the sole comfort of the People here&#146; in south Wales (<span class="italic">Heads of Chiefe Passages in Parliament</span>, no. 2, 12&#150;19 Jan 1648, BL, E423/11, 11; <span class="italic">The Declaration of Col. Poyer and Col. Powel</span>, April 1648, BL, E435/9, 4&#150;5, 6). A hostile account tells a more cynical story, albeit one which confirms Poyer's anti-puritan credentials. After challenging a gentleman as to whether he was an Independent or a Presbyterian, he heard the latter reply, &#145;Neither, for he was a Protestant&#146;. &#145;Why, so am I, quoth Poyer, therefore let us be Merry. So in they went, and drunk so hard that neither was able to stir in Four and twenty Hours after&#146;  (Rushworth, 7.1033).<br>
<br>At the beginning of May, with Cromwell already <i>en route</i> to quell the various insurgents in south Wales, Poyer reportedly boasted that he would be &#145;the first that shall charge against Ironsides (viz. Cromwell), saying that if he had a back of steel and a breast of iron, he durst and will encounter with him&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Declaration &hellip; of Col. John Poyer</span>, May 1648, BL, E441/6, 6). He was soon to be joined in Pembroke Castle by Laugharne, whose force had been smashed at St Fagans by Colonel Horton on 8 May. They were an ill-assorted couple. Poyer was described by his critics as at best a protean character: &#145;a man of two Dispositions every Day &hellip; in the Morning Sober and Penitent, but in the Afternoon, Drunk and full of Plots&#146;  (Rushworth, 7.1033). Laugharne, on the other hand, had a distinguished record as a parliamentary major-general, even if he was also subject to fits of something approaching paranoia in face of real or imagined slights. Rumour soon had it that, in the course of one dispute, he had run Poyer through with his sword. Nevertheless, while Powell capitulated at Tenby on 7 June, Pembroke held out for more than a month longer, Poyer striving to encourage the garrison through the vain hope of relief from Sir Marmaduke Langdale's northern royalists. On 14 June Cromwell assured Speaker Lenthall that the garrison would be starved out within a fortnight. Deserters predicted that Poyer's throat would soon be cut and the danger of mutiny appeared to be confirmed by the cry heard from within the walls: &#145;Shall we be ruined for two or three men's pleasure? Better it were we should throw them over the walls&#146;  (Carlyle, 1.269&#150;70). On 10 July Cromwell sent his final summons to surrender and Poyer yielded on the following day.<br>
<br>Poyer, Laugharne, and Powell were placed at parliament's mercy and on 13 August the prince of Wales requested Fairfax to intervene to the end that &#145;such moderation may be used towards them as becomes souldgers to one another&#146;. But the lord general replied that he was powerless to act since they had &#145;betrayed the trust &hellip; reposed in them to the ingaging the Kingdom againe in War &amp; Blood&#146; (BL, Add. MS 19399, fols. 58, 60; Rushworth, 7.1233). After many delays a court martial condemned them to death on 10 April 1649, but it was ruled that only one should die, and that lots should be drawn to decide who this should be. This was done on 21 April when the fatal lot fell to Poyer who, following the rejection of his wife Elizabeth's appeal for his life, &#145;was shot to death in <i>Covent-Garden</i> and died very penitently&#146; on 25 April  (Whitelock, 384<i>b</i>). In June 1661 his impoverished widow petitioned Charles II, claiming that her late husband had lost &pound;8000 in the royal service. On 25 August 1663 she was granted &pound;100 and soon after a further &pound;3000 to be paid in ten annual instalments.<br>
