<span class="headword">Hislop, Sir  Thomas</span>, first baronet  (1764&#150;1843), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 5 July 1764, the third and youngest son of Lieutenant-Colonel William Hislop (<i>d</i>. 1779), Royal Artillery. His two elder brothers were killed in India, James at the battle of Polillur in 1781, when aide-de-camp to Sir Eyre Coote, and William, captain Royal Artillery, at Cundapore in 1783.<br>
<br>Hislop entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, on 31 March 1778, and on 28 December the same year was appointed ensign in the 39th (East Middlesex) foot, with which he served throughout the siege of Gibraltar (1779&#150;83) and was promoted lieutenant on 28 January 1783. He became captain by purchase in the 100th foot on 28 January 1785, exchanged back to the 39th on 4 February 1785, and in December 1792 was appointed aide-de-camp to Major-General David Dundas, on whose staff he served in Ireland, at Toulon, and in the expedition to Corsica. He brought home the dispatches announcing the capture, on 19 February 1794, of San Fiorenzo, for which he was promoted major on 16 August 1794. In May the same year he was appointed aide-de-camp to Lord Amherst, then commander-in-chief. He was employed by the prince of Wales on a special mission in Germany, and on his return was appointed, on 25 March 1795, lieutenant-colonel of the 115th foot, from which he exchanged once more to the 39th on 1 September 1795. He accompanied the 39th to the West Indies, and commanded it at the capture of Demerara, Berbice, and Essequibo in 1796. He remained in military command of those settlements until their restoration to the Dutch at the peace of Amiens in May 1802. On 6 September 1798 he became lieutenant-colonel of the 11th West India regiment, which he raised. He was promoted colonel on 29 April 1802, joined the 8th West India regiment in 1803, and became lieutenant-governor of Trinidad. He joined the army under Sir George Beckwith at Martinique in 1809, and commanded the 1st division at the capture of Guadeloupe in 1810. He was promoted major-general on 25 October 1809. He left Trinidad in ill health in 1811.<br>
<br>On 28 March 1812 Hislop was appointed commander-in-chief at Bombay with the local rank of lieutenant-general, and sailed in the frigate <i>Java</i>, which in December 1812 was captured by the United States frigate <i>Constitution</i> off the coast of Brazil. Hislop, whose bravery was conspicuous during the action, was put on shore at San Salvador, and returned home. On 27 May 1813 he was appointed commander-in-chief at Madras (Fort St George). He was given the full rank of lieutenant-general on 4 June the same year, and on 2 November was created a baronet. He was made KCB in 1814.<br>
<br>Hislop arrived at Madras late in 1814. During the Third Anglo-Maratha War, of 1817&#150;18, he was commander-in-chief of the army of the Deccan. After a delay from illness he assumed the command at Hyderabad on 10 November 1817. At Mehidpur on 21 December, with a force of 5500 men, Hislop signally defeated the Maratha army of Indore, consisting of 30,000 light cavalry, 5000 infantry, and 100 guns, under the command of the youthful Malhar Rao Holkar. The surrender by the Marathas of certain border fortresses followed. The division under Hislop's personal command arrived before the fort of Talnar, the governor of which, after a parley, refused to obey the order to surrender. By Hislop's order he was hanged as a rebel, and the garrison of 300 men killed. When the chief objects of the campaign had been accomplished, the army of the Deccan was broken up at Aurangabad in March 1818, and Hislop returned to his command at Fort St George, which he held until 1820. He was made GCB in 1818.<br>
<br>Explanations of Hislop's severities at Talnar had been called for by Lord Moira, the governor-general [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12568/', "Hastings, Francis Rawdon")</script>], and the home government; the House of Commons, in voting thanks to the army of the Deccan, specifically excepted Hislop in consequence. Wellington defended Hislop in the House of Lords on the ground of his previous high character. The explanations eventually sent home were never made public, and the subject dropped. Another controversy arose from the conflicting claims of the Bengal and Madras armies to the spoils known as the Deccan prize. The privy council, after hearing counsel, decided that the Bengal army under the marquess of Hastings, though at a great distance from the scene of capture, were co-operating by their presence in the field, and entitled to share equably with the troops under Hislop's command. Wellington remarked that the sole satisfaction he felt at the decision was that, had the sum thus put into the pockets of the army fallen to Sir Thomas Hislop, it would have vanished in Mexican bonds or Columbian securities, like Hislop's private fortune.<br>
<br>In 1822 Hislop received an &#145;honourable augmentation&#146; to his arms in recognition of his distinguished services in India. On 30 October 1823 he married Emma, daughter of the Rt Hon. Hugh Elliot, governor of Madras, and they had one daughter. He was appointed colonel of the 51st foot on 4 June 1822 and of the 48th foot on 25 December 1829, and served for many years as equerry to the duke of Cambridge. He died at Charlton, Kent, on 3 May 1843.<br>
