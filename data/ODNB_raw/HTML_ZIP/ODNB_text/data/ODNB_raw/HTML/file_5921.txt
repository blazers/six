<span class="headword">Collier,  Robert Porrett</span>, first Baron Monkswell  (1817&#150;1886), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Mount Tamar, near Plymouth, on 21 June 1817, the eldest son of John Collier (1769&#150;1849), a merchant, and his wife, Emma, fourth daughter of Robert Porrett, of North Hill House, Plymouth. The firm of Collier &amp; Co., corn and timber merchants, had been established in Southside Street, Plymouth, in 1676. Collier's father, who ran the business, was agent for Lloyds for nearly fifty years, and vice-consul for Norway, Sweden, and Portugal. Formerly a member of the Society of Friends, he was an alderman for Plymouth, a justice of the peace, a deputy lieutenant of Devon, and Liberal MP for Plymouth from 1832 to 1841. With such a family background it is not surprising that Robert Collier should have developed an interest in commercial, maritime, and international law. He was educated at Plymouth grammar school and then received private tuition from Revd John Kempe, curate of Tavistock, before entering Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1836. Poor health forced him to give up reading for honours and he left the university for a period, returning to take an ordinary BA degree in 1843. He had already developed political ambitions, making speeches at Launceston in 1841 with a view to contesting the seat, though he did not go to the poll, and later becoming an active member of the Anti-Corn Law League, addressing league meetings in Covent Garden Theatre. On 14 April 1844 he married Isabella Rose (1815&#150;1886), daughter of William Rose Rose of Wolston Heath, Warwickshire.<br>
<br>Collier joined the Inner Temple on 4 June 1838 and was called to the bar on 27 January 1843. He practised from 1 Mitre Court Buildings, Temple, and joined the western circuit and the Devonshire, Plymouth, and Devonport sessions. His first case to attract public attention was <i>R. v. Serva</i> at Exeter assizes in July 1845. Some Brazilian slave traders had killed an English naval officer on board the Brazilian vessel the <i>Felicidade</i>, and they were tried for murder in this country. Serjeant Manning defended some of the prisoners, Collier the others. Collier made a very vigorous speech at the trial in Exeter and, after successfully laying the matter before the home secretary (Sir James Graham) and Sir Robert Peel, a very learned speech on the question of jurisdiction when the point was reserved for all the judges in November. On his next visit to Exeter he had nineteen briefs. In 1845 he published a treatise on the <span class="roman">Railway Clauses Acts</span>, followed in 1849 by an account of the law relating to mines, and in 1851 by a letter to Lord John Russell on reform of the superior courts (2nd edn, 1852).<br>
<br>Local influence and wide practical knowledge gave Collier a good practice; he was an excellent jurist and an eloquent, sharp, and witty advocate. He was recorder of Penzance from July 1848 to March 1856. On 8 July 1854 Lord Cranworth granted him a patent of precedence (QC) at the age of thirty-seven and after only eleven years at the bar; and he was elected a bencher of the Inner Temple. From 1854 to 1863 he was one of that brilliant quartet, Montague Smith, Collier, Karslake, and Coleridge, who dominated the western circuit during its golden age. In the earlier part of that period there was friction on the circuit between him and Coleridge which permanently affected the relations between them.<br>
<br>In July 1852 Collier was elected Liberal MP for Plymouth, holding the seat until October 1871. He made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 29 November 1852 on the <span class="roman">Courts of Common Law (Ireland) Bill</span>, supporting the fusion of common law and equity in England and their administration in one common court. After that he spoke frequently and with good effect, especially on the Russian blockade on 20 February 1855, but chiefly on questions of law reform. In 1859 he was appointed counsel to the Admiralty and judge-advocate of the fleet. In 1862 the American minister, Adams, consulted him about vessel &#145;no. 290&#146; being built at Liverpool for the Confederate navy. In his opinion (23 July 1862) he said that he thought it was the duty of the port authorities to detain her, but before the government could take action she had escaped to a destructive career on the high seas as the <i>Alabama</i>. On 2 October 1863, when Sir William Atherton retired and Sir Roundell Palmer was promoted to be attorney-general, Collier was appointed solicitor-general and knighted, and filled the office with success until the Liberal government resigned in 1866. One of his first duties as solicitor-general was to defend the government's record on the Confederate cruisers, including the <i>Alabama</i>, in the House of Commons on 4 March 1864. In December 1868 Collier became attorney-general with Coleridge, after an initial refusal, as solicitor-general. In 1869 he was responsible for the <span class="roman">Bankruptcy Bill</span> in the House of Commons.<br>
<br>In August 1870 Collier was appointed recorder of Bristol on the death of Serjeant Kinglake, thereby causing a by-election in his constituency. Plymouth Dockyard was suffering badly from cuts in government expenditure, and at his adoption meeting an amendment was passed that he should resign the recordership. Although there were good precedents for the attorney-general holding the recordership of Bristol, which was one of the most valuable in the country, he decided to resign the position, amid widespread criticism in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, the <span class="italic">Law Journal</span>, and elsewhere, and was duly re-elected as MP for Plymouth without opposition.<br>
<br>Collier ran into another storm in 1871. On 5 August he moved the second reading of the <span class="roman">Judicial Committee of the Privy Council Bill</span> in the House of Commons, providing for the appointment of four salaried judges on the judicial committee. The appointments were limited to persons of high judicial authority: the new judges had at the date of their appointment to be or have been English superior court judges or Indian chief justices. Two Indian chief justices were found, and Sir Montague Smith was promoted from the court of common pleas. The fourth vacancy was refused by three English judges and likely to be refused by more, because the act made no provision for the clerks of the new judges. To solve the problem the lord chancellor, Hatherley, appointed Collier to the vacant seat in the court of Common Pleas, which he held for a few days (7 to 22 November) only before Gladstone appointed him to the judicial committee. The &#145;Collier Juggle&#146; was technically legal, but in blatant conflict with the spirit of the act, and a long and bitter controversy ensued, notably captured in a <span class="italic">Punch</span> cartoon (16 Dec 1871). There were letters from both chief justices, Cockburn and Bovill, published in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and motions of censure in both houses of parliament. The government won by only a single vote in the House of Lords, and by twenty-seven in the House of Commons thanks to a brilliant speech by Sir Roundell Palmer. Collier held this post until his death, and he was frequently responsible for giving literary shape to the judgments of the privy council. On 1 July 1885 he was created Baron Monkswell, of Monkswell, Devon.<br>
<br>Collier was highly versatile and accomplished. At Cambridge he wrote some clever parodies, and published a satirical poem called <span class="italic">Granta</span>; and he also wrote some very pretty verses both in Latin and English. He was an excellent scholar, publishing a translation of Demosthenes' <span class="italic">De corona</span> (1875), and a good billiard player. But it was chiefly in painting, of which he was passionately fond, that he was distinguished. As a young man he drew very clever caricatures in the H. B. manner. When solicitor-general he painted in St James's Park, and he exhibited frequently at the Royal Academy and Grosvenor Gallery, especially pictures of the neighbourhood of Rosenlui, Switzerland, where he spent many vacations. He was president of the Devonshire Association in 1879, and his presidential address at the annual meeting at Ilfracombe dealt mainly with the progress and development of the art of painting. His wife died suddenly on 10 April 1886. In failing health he went to the Riviera, and died at Grasse, near Cannes, on 27 October 1886. He was buried at Brompton cemetery on 3 November. He had three children: Robert, second Baron Monkswell (1845&#150;1909); <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32499/', "John Collier (1850&#150;1934)")</script>, a well-known artist who painted the portraits of a number of eminent lawyers, including Lord Chancellor Halsbury; and Margaret Isabella, who married Count Arturo Galletti di Cadilhac. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48939/', "Mary Josephine Collier, Lady Monkswell")</script>, the diarist, was his daughter-in-law.<br>
