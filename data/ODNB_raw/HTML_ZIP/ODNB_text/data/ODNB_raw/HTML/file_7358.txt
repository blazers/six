<span class="headword">Day,  Alexander</span>  (1745&#150;1841), <span class="occ">miniature painter and art dealer</span>, was born in Somerset, the son of John Day. He was the pupil of Ozias Humphry in London, and exhibited miniatures with the Society of Artists in 1768, 1772, and 1773. He was described as &#145;At Mr Humphrey's, King Street, Covent Garden&#146; in 1768, and as the &#145;Late Pupil of Mr Humphry's&#146; in 1773  (Graves, <span class="italic">Soc. Artists</span>). In December 1773 he was at Lyons, travelling to Rome, where Humphry, already resident, obtained a room for him. On his arrival in April 1774 Day was described as a &#145;scolar to Humphrys&#146;  (Stainton). He was to stay more than forty years, practising as a miniaturist, copyist, and dealer.<br>
<br>From 1774 to 1777 Day shared apartments with Humphry in the strada Gregoriana and strada Felice; after Humphry left in April 1777 he continued living in the strada Felice with the Scottish painter James Nevay. He also became the friend of the artist Prince Hoare, who was in Rome between 1776 and 1779, and remained in correspondence with him between 1780 and 1791 (letters in the Beinecke Library, Yale University). On 8 December 1792 Day, described as being forty-two, married Anna Mattei, aged twenty-four, &#145;an Italian woman who he had secreted in his apartment three years &amp; had children by her&#146;; he had been obliged to marry her &#145;on it being discovered by an Ecclesiastical authority&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 4.1380). In 1801 Day and his wife had a son and two daughters aged between one and nine.<br>
<br>Very little is known of Day's work as an artist, though contemporary accounts show he maintained a practice in Rome. A miniature of John, Lord Hervey, dated 1795, is at Ickworth, Suffolk; he copied a portrait of Lady Hamilton in 1792 and painted William Lambton in 1797 (both untraced). His miniatures of Venus and Antinous (ex Sothebys, 11 July 1991) are dated 1793, the year in which Day's miniatures were described as &#145;much inferior in merit to several in London&#146;  (journal of Sir William Forbes, Ingamells, 285), but by that time he was also being employed as a copyist by the fourth earl of Bristol and Philip Hardwicke (later third earl of Hardwicke).<br>
<br>Already in 1779 Day was being described as both a miniature painter and a dealer  (Gwynne, 164). In 1787 he was trying to persuade the sculptor Vincenzo Pacetti to sell a marble faun, and in January 1792 he was sending to Sir William Hamilton in Naples &#145;a Colossal Head &amp; Leg&#146;  (Ingamells, 286) cast (presumably) from the celebrated group <span class="italic">Alexander and Bucephalus</span> on Monte Cavallo (of which Day subsequently assembled a set of casts). When the French invaded Rome in 1798 Day was able to make spectacular acquisitions from apprehensive Italian collectors, in particular from the Aldobrandini, Borghese, and Colunna palaces. At the time he had two French officers billeted on him, &#145;but they provided for themselves and almost daily invited him to their dinner, thinking it unreasonable to live upon Artists&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 4.1571); Day meanwhile secreted his pictures &#145;in walls etc&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 3.1066).<br>
<br>In 1800 Day returned to London and exhibited his purchases for sale by private contract at 20 Lower Brook Street. There were twenty-nine paintings, including masterpieces now in the National Gallery, London, such as Titian's <span class="italic">Bacchus and Ariadne</span>, Raphael's <span class="italic">Aldobrandini Madonna</span> and <span class="italic">St Catherine</span>, the Michelangelo &#145;Manchester Madonna&#146; and Annibale Carracci's <span class="italic">Domine quo vadis</span>, besides Bellini's <span class="italic">Feast of the Gods</span>, now in the National Gallery, Washington, and the Graeco-Roman bas-relief <span class="italic">The Apotheosis of Homer</span>, now in the British Museum. It was a remarkable exhibition; whenever he visited it Benjamin West said he &#145;used to walk home as if he felt himself some inches taller&#146;  (Buchanan, 2.9). In July 1801 Day returned to Rome. He sent more pictures to London in 1802 and 1806, and in 1804 he briefly returned with Vincenzo Camuccini, one of two brothers, who were acting as his business partners in Rome. He was again exhibiting pictures in London in 1808.<br>
<br>Although at Easter 1816 Day and his family were listed in the via Sistina (as the strada Felice had become in 1804), in March that year he had already been lodging in London &#145;for the past six months&#146; with the gem-engraver Nathaniel Marchant  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 14.4805). In February he had appeared before a parliamentary commission as an enthusiastic witness for the purchase of the Elgin marbles. He had also been permitted by the prince regent to adapt the royal stables in the King's Mews for an exhibition of his casts from Monte Cavallo together with further pictures and antiquities. Prince Hoare wrote an explanatory pamphlet for the exhibition which was open at least from February to September. In July, Day was said to have married Mrs Burnage, Marchant's housekeeper, who had been in &#145;a very poor state of health&#146; on her master's death in March, but had subsequently received more than &pound;9000 in his will  (ibid., 4805, 4878); there was then no mention of Day's previous marriage.<br>
<br>There are few facts concerning Day's later years. In 1819 he was offering pictures to the prince regent from an address at the &#145;Mews Gallery, Charing Cross&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of George IV</span>, 2.294&#150;5). He apparently returned to Rome, for in 1821 Farington noted that Day &#145;who has long been a resident in Rome&#146; had enabled an English artist, Evans, to make copies of Raphael's <span class="italic">Loggie</span>  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 16.5745). On 21 June 1833 Day held a sale in London at Christies which included pictures from the Aldobrandini collection. He died in Chelsea in his ninety-sixth year on 12 January 1841, by which time, according to his obituarist, he had often been described as &#145;long since deceased&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Union</span>, 87). The final dispersal of his collections took place at Christies on 27 May 1843 and 24 May 1845.<br>
<br>When his obituary was reprinted in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, new series, 16 (1841), 101&#150;2, his age was transposed from &#145;96&#146; to &#145;69&#146;, which led all his subsequent biographers to assume the existence of at least two, and sometimes three, artists called Day.<br>
