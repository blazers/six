<span class="headword">Lucas,  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1740&#150;1802), <span class="occ">writer and lawyer</span>, was born in Dublin, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17124/', "Charles Lucas (1713&#150;1771)")</script>, the radical Irish politician, and his first wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Blundell. His father had to flee Ireland in 1749 after his election campaign for the Dublin city seat in the Irish House of Commons resulted in a charge of seditious libel. It is not clear if Henry remained with his mother and family in Dublin while his father subsequently studied medicine in Europe. However, the family was with Charles while he practised medicine in London and Bath in the 1750s. Henry returned to a scholarship at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1757. There he was taught by Thomas Leland, a supporter of his father's. He tactfully subscribed to Leland's <span class="italic">The History of the Life and Reign of Philip, King of Macedon</span> in 1758. He graduated BA in 1759, the year his father returned from exile, and obtained his MA in 1762. He was admitted to the Middle Temple the following year (as had been his father during a brief spell in London after his flight from Ireland and before taking up his medical studies). He seems to have made the law his occupation and was called to the bar in 1790.<br>
<br>In his later twenties Henry rode on the coat-tails of his father in Dublin. Indeed, his father may have been grooming him for a political career, for Dr Lucas's stalwart supporters the Dublin Guild of Barber Surgeons admitted Henry as a freeman in 1767. In 1770, the year before his father's death, Lucas was involved in a fracas at a meeting of the Constitutional Free Debating Society. After drawing with Richard Brinsley Sheridan for a medal, with a group of &#145;ignorant, giddy, young men&#146; he attacked the chair and attempted to take it  (<span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span>, 30 May&#150;1 June 1770, 471). His expulsion from the society is the last record of his Irish involvements, and after his father's death in 1771 he appears to have transferred his attentions to London and to writing.<br>
<br>Lucas shared his father's interest in the theatre, and his first attributed work was an opera in 1776. He attempted to obtain patronage from the duke of Northumberland with a &#145;pastoral elegy&#146; on the death of the duchess in 1777. Northumberland had been Irish viceroy from 1763 to 1765, and Lucas was possibly acquainted with him thus. Samuel Johnson was a connection of Lucas's father from the time of his exile, and Lucas asked him for advice on his historical play <span class="italic">The Earl of Somerset</span> in 1777. The subject of the play was the fall of Robert Cauvs the earl of Somerset following his unjust treatment of Sir Thomas Overbury. Johnson said that it was &#145;but a poor performance&#146;, but which given it might &#145;put money into his [Lucas's] pockets [and] contains nothing immoral or indecent &hellip; we may very well wish success&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Samuel Johnson</span>, 3.21). (The remark of Johnson, &#145;I never did the man an injury&#146;, has been wrongly attributed to this episode and actually refers to Joseph Reed.) However, Johnson was annoyed two years later when Lucas used his name in association with attempts to get the work staged. The play received mixed notices the best of which, in the <span class="italic">London Review</span>, said it contained &#145;more beauties than defects&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Review</span>, 11 Feb 1780, 143). When Lucas published the play by subscription in 1779, describing himself on the title-page as a &#145;student of the Middle Temple&#146;, he complained about the difficulties of getting work staged, and was still making similar complaints twenty years later with the publication of his last work, shortly before his death in 1802.<br>
<br>Lucas's other published works are either poetical or dramatic, and in subject and tone highlight Lucas's pressing need to attract remunerative patronage. Examples include: <span class="italic">A Visit from the Shades, or, Earl Chatham's Adieu to his Friend Lord Cambden</span> (1778); <span class="italic">Poems to her Majesty</span> (beginning with the unfortunately titled &#145;Ejaculation Occasioned by Seeing the Royal Children&#146;, published together with <span class="italic">The Earl of Somerset</span> in 1779); and <span class="italic">The cypress-wreath, or, Meed of honour: an elegio-heroic poem, to the memory of Lord Robert Manners</span> (1782).<br>
<br>Neither Lucas's legal nor his literary career seem to have been much of a success, and in 1818, sixteen years after his death, his stepmother and sister were in such financial straits that a public subscription had to be launched in Dublin for their support. Like his father's political pamphlets, his poetry and dramatic works stress the theme of personal virtue.<br>
