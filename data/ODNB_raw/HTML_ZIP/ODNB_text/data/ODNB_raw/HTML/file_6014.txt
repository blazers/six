<span class="headword">Colwall,  Daniel</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1690), <span class="occ">merchant and philanthropist</span>, has an obscure family background, and nothing is known about his early life. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 16 January 1661, and was a council member (1663&#150;86 and 1689) and treasurer from 1665 to 1679 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/59221', "Founder members of the Royal Society")</script>]. He became a vice-president of the society in 1682.<br>
<br>During his long, influential period as treasurer, Colwall helped the society to survive its frequent financial difficulties. Fellows were reluctant to pay the weekly subscription of a shilling. In 1667 and 1673 the council instructed Colwall to require members to pay their subscriptions, but in vain. In 1667 the arrears approached &pound;1000 and in 1674 &pound;2000 when only 53 of the 146 fellows paid regularly.<br>
<br>In 1663 and 1666 Colwall presented the society with &pound;50 on condition that he was not exempted from his weekly subscriptions; and the council decided that these sums should be expended to purchase &#145;the collection of rarities belonging to Mr Hubbard&#146;, which was the beginning of the society's museum. Colwall himself presented gifts including &#145;an Arabian stone to provoke wine&#146; and &#145;a piece of wood good for green wounds&#146; and spoke on such subjects as &#145;making vitriol&#146; and &#145;ordering oysters at Colchester&#146;  (Birch, 1.20, 41; 4.178).<br>
<br>In 1681 Nehemiah Grew published <span class="italic">Musaeum regalis societatis</span>, dedicated to Colwall, who paid for the engravings. Grew hoped that the society &#145;may always wear this Catalogue, as the miniature of Mr. Colwall's abundant respects near their hearts&#146; and added<blockquote>Besides the particular regard you had to the Royal Society itself, which seeming (in the opinion of some) to look a little pale, you intended, hereby, to put some fresh blood into their cheeks; pouring out your box of oyntment not in order to their burial, but their resurrection. (Weld, 1.278)</blockquote>The other philanthropic cause Colwall supported was Christ's Hospital, the charitable school in London of which he was long a governor. As such he was a member of the court, the supreme body of the hospital, and regularly attended its meetings and served on the general committee hearing cases and petitions. He was present on 27 March 1683 for the visitation of the mathematical school, grammar school, and reading and writing school. In 1678 the court accepted his offer to give the hospital &pound;1000 provided the court would pay him &pound;50 a year in half-yearly instalments.<br>
<br>Samuel Pepys, who became secretary of the Admiralty in 1672, was worried by the inadequate supply of skilled sailors as navigators and encouraged Charles II to establish in the hospital the royal mathematical school. Colwall made a gift to it, though the hospital doubted whether the king would agree to any augmentation of his establishment, but the king's reply was &#145;so far was he from disliking this that he would be glad to see any gentleman graft upon his stock&#146;  (Trollope, 2.560). In 1676 Colwall took the charge, an admonition then given by the court to enable him to nominate a child for admission to the hospital, and in 1684 he presented a child to be admitted to the school.<br>
<br>In Colwall's will, proved on 20 November, he bequeathed to the hospital &#145;for ever one rent or yearly payment of sixty-two pounds and eight shillings issuing and payable out of the hereditary excise which was assigned to me by Sir Robert Viner, knt. and bart. deceased&#146;, and the sum of &pound;4000; besides supplementing the salary of master of the grammar school by a life annuity of &pound;20.<br>
<br>The court set up a committee to consider how Colwall would have wished the &pound;4000 to be used. They decided, first, that it should assist the children sent to two places in Hertfordshire after the London fire of 1666 since &#145;he did generally approve of making such a kind of reception for the nurses and children at Hertford as has been lately made at Ware&#146;; and, second, to make &#145;a new Writing School in the Hospital&#146;. They asserted, &#145;We think ourselves bound both in gratitude and for transmitting the memory of so bountiful a benefactor as also for the great usefulness of the things themselves&#146;  (Christ's Hospital general committee minutes, 1687&#150;98, fols. 224, 229, 243).<br>
<br>In 1670 and again in 1673 Colwall was recorded as living in a house with twelve hearths in Tower Hill East in the liberty of the Tower of London, the inhabitants of which, after being sworn and registered by the steward of the Tower court, became &#145;free men of the Tower&#146;. This absolved them from jury service at assizes and county sessions and exempted them from the jurisdiction of the City of London and county of Middlesex. Its inhabitants were expected to support their own poor; and after Colwall's death in November 1690 in the liberty, his will made generous provision for the poor there.<br>
