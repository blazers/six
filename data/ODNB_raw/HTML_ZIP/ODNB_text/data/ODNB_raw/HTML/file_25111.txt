<span class="headword">Seton <span class="st"> [<em>later </em>Gordon]</span>,  Alexander</span>, first earl of Huntly  (<em>d.</em> 1470), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son of <a name="cosubject_61150"></a><span class="headword">Sir Alexander Seton</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1440/41)<span class="occ"></span>, son of William Seton and Janet Fleming. His mother was Elizabeth Gordon (<i>d</i>. 1439), daughter and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11012/', "Sir Adam Gordon")</script>, lord of Gordon, who died at Homildon Hill on 14 September 1402. When Alexander senior married Elizabeth Gordon in 1408, she brought with her the Berwickshire baronies of Gordon and Fogo, but also the lordship of Strathbogie in the heart of the north-east, largely neglected by the Gordons throughout the fourteenth century. Alexander had an elder brother, John Seton, who was already reasonably prominent in the borders, and so he seems to have taken the decision to develop his own sphere of influence, moving his base to the northern estates. Over the next two decades he gradually built up a network of support and alliances which included Alexander Stewart, earl of Mar (<i>d</i>. 1435), the most powerful magnate in the region, and also members of prominent local families, such as the Forbeses, Ogilvys, and Irvines of Drum.<br>
<br>More importantly, however, Seton also became involved in the negotiations to release James I from his long period of captivity in England. Knighted by 1419, he visited James while the king was with Henry V in France in 1422 and took part in talks held in England in 1423 and 1424. This not only brought him royal favour, it also brought him into contact with leading figures at court, among them William Crichton, who was to become chancellor of Scotland during the minority of James II. Seton never became a major political figure, but he remained on the fringes of the political scene both at the centre and in the north-east, a position that his eldest son was able to build on. In or about 1440 he left Scotland on pilgrimage, possibly carrying the heart of James I. He died on his journey between 31 August 1440 and 3 April 1441, probably in Rhodes, from where James's heart was returned to Scotland in 1444.<br>
<br>The early successes of Seton's son were based on the relationship Seton had developed with William Crichton, chancellor from 1439. In 1438 the younger Alexander divorced his first wife, Egidia Hay (<i>d</i>. 1441), in order to marry Crichton's elder daughter, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1479), disinheriting his own eldest son in the process. Even at this early stage the younger Seton's territorial ambitions were evident, since he forced Egidia to resign into his hands the liferent of her family estates. So desirable was the union with Elizabeth Crichton that Seton was prepared to obtain his divorce from Egidia fraudulently, denying that he had received a papal dispensation for the marriage in 1426 and concealing the offending document &#145;with malicious intent in his own house&#146;  (Seton, 277). This deception came to light only in 1441, after the death of Egidia Hay, when Seton asked for, and was given, absolution for his transgressions. With the benefit of Crichton's support Seton set about establishing the family in the north-east, the two men working together to frustrate the claims of Robert, Lord Erskine (<i>d</i>. 1452), to the vacant earldom of Mar, effectively allowing Seton to step into the vacuum created.<br>
<br>Seton was knighted in 1439 or 1440 and most probably promoted to earl of Huntly in June 1445, as part of the settlement between the warring Crichton and Douglas&#150;Livingston factions. In 1446, however, he and his supporters were heavily defeated in battle at Arbroath, when the new earl travelled south to aid his Ogilvy allies in their struggle with the Lindsays over the office of justiciar of Arbroath Abbey. As a result he was forced to retire to Strathbogie and concentrate on consolidating his regional position. His re-emergence onto the political stage came with James II's personal entry into politics in 1449. The young king chose to use Huntly as his principal northern ally during the struggles with the earls of Douglas, Crawford, and Ross that dominated the 1450s. Huntly was granted the lordship of Badenoch and castle of Ruthven in 1451, but proved unable to stand against the MacDonalds at this stage; Ruthven was destroyed by Ross's men. In 1452 Huntly achieved greater success when he marched south to confront the earl of Crawford, defeating him at Brechin despite the loss of two of his own brothers. The victory was fundamental in securing James II's position, and the contemporary Auchinleck chronicle suggests that at the time Huntly was operating in an official capacity as royal lieutenant. The chronicle states that &#145;thair was with the erll of huntlie fer ma [men] than was with the erll of craufurd becaus he displayit the kingis banere and said it was the kingis actioun and he was his luftennend&#146;  (McGladdery, 173). For Huntly, however, the opportunity to avenge his defeat at the hands of the Lindsays in 1446 and further establish his regional dominance was possibly just as important as any desire to secure royal authority.<br>
<br>Huntly's opportunism was again highlighted by his swift reaction to the final defeat of the Douglas faction at Arkinholm in 1455. Within seventeen days he had arranged the marriage of his teenage son and heir, George, to the widow of Archibald Douglas, earl of Moray (who fell in the battle), in an attempt to add that earldom to the family estates. On this occasion, though, James II reacted equally swiftly, proceeding to forfeit the earldom rather than allow the Setons to gain total dominance in the north-east. Huntly had some consolation when George was allowed to marry the king's sister Annabella after his divorce from the unfortunate countess of Moray.<br>
<br>In or about 1457 Huntly changed the family name to Gordon to try to secure the succession of George, his eldest son by his second marriage. In 1460 he was present at the siege of Roxburgh when James II was killed by the bursting of one of his own cannon. He has been described as a councillor in the early minority government of James III, but if this is true he seems to have taken little interest in his duties, preferring to remain in the north-east. After 1465 he apparently played a much more limited role in the family's concerns, allowing his son George to direct affairs. He and his first wife, Egidia Hay, the daughter of Sir John Hay of Tullibody, whom he married in 1427, had a son, Sir Alexander Seton, ancestor of the Setons of Touch, Stirlingshire. His second marriage, to Elizabeth Crichton, produced four sons and at least four daughters: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11033/', "George Gordon")</script>, the eldest, succeeded him as the second earl of Huntly, and the second son, Sir Alexander Gordon of Midmar, was the ancestor of the Gordons of Midmar. Alexander Gordon, first earl of Huntly, died on 15 July 1470 at Huntly Castle and was buried in the cathedral church of Elgin. By the time of his death he had effectively established the Setons of Gordon as the most powerful family in the north of Scotland.<br>
