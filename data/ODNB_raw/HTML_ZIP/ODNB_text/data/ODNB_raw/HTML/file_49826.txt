<span class="headword">Mayett,  Joseph</span>  (1783&#150;1839), <span class="occ">agricultural labourer and autobiographer</span>, was born on 12 March 1783 at Quainton, Buckinghamshire. He was the second of the eight children born to Mary (<i>c</i>.1749&#150;1829/30), the wife of Joseph Mayett (1743/4&#150;1826), a day labourer, though his father had had two children from a previous marriage. Most of these ten children died in their infancy, and &#145;four was the most that ever was living at one time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1). It was a nonconformist family whose house in Quainton was licensed for preaching first by the Methodists and after 1801 by the Baptists, though until the second decade of the nineteenth century the family attended the Particular Baptist Chapel at Waddesdon Hill.<br>
<br>Mayett was taught to read by his mother at about the age of four from a chapbook&#151;<span class="italic">The Reading Made Easy in a Variety of Useful Lessons</span>&#151;and later from the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, <span class="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</span>, and Isaac Watts's <span class="italic">Hymns</span>. His education continued from 1794 onwards at Sunday school, though he was still trying to perfect his writing and to grasp punctuation in the militia when he was twenty-three. He learned lace making at the age of seven, but then followed his father as a labourer and farm servant for various masters in Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. His autobiography depicts a young man trying to square the competing claims, in a poor rural community, of a fundamentalist religion and the desire for physical pleasure, and, feeling himself often misunderstood or misrepresented, he enlisted in 1803 in the Royal Buckinghamshire militia.<br>
<br>For the next twelve years Mayett saw service in various parts of England. He experienced the Luddite riots in Nottinghamshire and Lancashire in 1812, and served in Ireland from 1812 to 1814. He survived smallpox, suffered permanent eye damage, and, according to the autobiography, veered from periods of religious rectitude to those of licentiousness. In May 1815 he obtained his discharge as the oldest soldier in the regiment and returned to Quainton, where, despite initial prosperity and happiness, he was soon on hard times again, scraping a living as a pedlar, gathering rags, and selling tapes and laces. He married, on 18 December 1815, Sarah Slade (<i>bap</i>. 1784, <i>d</i>. 1844), another member of the Waddesdon Hill church, and he was formally accepted into the congregation there in May 1816. Five months later, however, seventeen members formed a separate church at Quainton with Joseph Mayett as deacon. They built a new chapel, and later Mayett and his wife began a Sunday school, which was initially very successful. Numbers fell away, however, when they could no longer offer cash prizes for good work to match those at the rival church school.<br>
<br>The last twenty years of Mayett's life were a struggle to find work and keep it, to obtain parish relief when out of work, and, when unable to work through sickness, to obtain payment from his friendly society. He was also constantly in dispute over family and church matters with his brother William (<i>b</i>. 1786) and his wife and then, after William's death in 1827, with his remaining brother Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1790), who subsequently emigrated to America. His father's death in 1826 is unrecorded in the autobiography though that of his mother, in 1830, is. He continued to live in Quainton, in declining health, and died there, childless, on 17 February 1839. His wife died on 18 August 1844.<br>
<br>The autobiography records the principal events in Mayett's life until the end of 1830, and seems to have been written up between 1828 and 1831, perhaps from a journal or notes made earlier. It was published by the Buckinghamshire Record Society in an edition by Ann Kussmaul in 1986. A rare survival from a level of rural society not frequently documented, its na&iuml;ve and misspelt narrative, described by Kussmaul as a &#145;late example of confessional writing, in the Puritan tradition&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, xv), provides a picture of a man struggling to survive and to find salvation at a time of rural economic depression.<br>
