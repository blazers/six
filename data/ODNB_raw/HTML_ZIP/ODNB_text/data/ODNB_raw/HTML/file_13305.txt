<span class="headword">Hill,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1653), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born at Knighton-on-Teme, Worcestershire, the son of William and Mary Hill. He has been claimed as a pupil of the King's School, Worcester, but from an association based on the false identification of his birthplace as Kington in the same county. He was admitted pensioner of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 19 October 1618 and matriculated the same year. He advanced to a scholarship, and graduated BA in 1623. After becoming a fellow of Emmanuel he proceeded MA in 1626. He was ordained deacon in the diocese of Peterborough on 23 January 1629, and made priest the following day. While at Emmanuel he was a regular preacher at the nearby parish church of St Andrew the Great, and continued to minister to the townspeople during an outbreak of plague. He spent a period with the puritan divine John Cotton at Boston, Lincolnshire, during which time his religious convictions were sharpened. In 1633 he took his BD and four days later was instituted to the rectory of Titchmarsh, Northamptonshire, on the presentation of the earl of Manchester. He sought relief from the composition fee payable to the university by beneficed graduands, since he had paid more than his first year's income to pension the previous incumbent, and because he was not formally possessed of the living when he took his degree. The university rejected his suit, but despite this awkward beginning Hill became an energetic rural pastor. At this time he visited Lord Brooke at Warwick, through which connection he met and married Mary Willford, governess to the earl of Warwick's daughter Lady Frances Rich.<br>
<br>Hill was appointed to advise the Lords committee on religious reform established in March 1641. He became a member of the Westminster assembly and was a regular weekday morning preacher in Westminster Abbey; on Sundays he was heard in St Martin-in-the-Fields. Several of his sermons before parliament between 1642 and 1644 were printed, as was a fast sermon before the lord mayor and aldermen of Easter week 1644. In 1645 he was first designated master of his old college and then, because this was &#145;not &hellip; a sphere large enough&#146;  (Tuckney, 52), he was made master of Trinity College, Cambridge, in which post he was confirmed by parliamentary order of 17 January 1648. In 1645/6 he was vice-chancellor and in 1646 he received his DD. He obtained for the university library the reversionary interest in books bequeathed by Archbishop Richard Bancroft, and solicited from Sir John Wollaston the establishment of a mathematical lecture. Hill himself lectured every Sunday in St Michael's Church, attached to Trinity, and also preached in the parish church of All Saints opposite the Great Gate. In the pulpit he was &#145;plain, powerful, frequent and laborious&#146;  (Tuckney, 58). A further <span class="italic">Six Sermons</span> were published in 1649. Hill edited William Fenner's <span class="italic">Wilfull Impenitency</span> (1648) and with Edmund Calamy edited Fenner's works, published from 1651. He also assisted Samuel Clarke with his <span class="italic">Lives</span> of puritan divines.<br>
<br>Hill died of a quartan ague on 18 December 1653. His friend for thirty-four years Anthony Tuckney, master of St John's, preached at the funeral in Great St Mary's on 22 December. By his will of 15 July 1650 and codicil of 7 July 1652 Hill left to his wife his house at Over Aston (Aston Court) in Knighton-on-Teme, together with other property there and at Burford, Shropshire (all which he had bought from his father) together with lands at Over, Cambridgeshire. Mary Hill subsequently became Tuckney's second wife, and died some time before 30 September 1668. When Hill made his will his parents were still alive; he also mentions sisters Jane Doughty, Margery Floyd, Anne Clarke, Mary Carbourne, and (as yet unmarried) Penelope. He made bequests to the poor of Titchmarsh, to his colleges, and to the university library. His personal effects were valued at &pound;485 16<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., including &pound;45 in plate and &pound;120 in books.<br>
