<span class="headword">Bonville <span class="st"> [Boville; <em>alias </em>Terill]</span>,  Anthony</span>  (1623&#150;1676), <span class="occ">Jesuit and theologian</span>, was born at Canford in Dorset either on 20 February or on 2 March 1623, the son of Humphrey Bonville, esquire, and his wife, Mary. Both his parents were Roman Catholics, although, according to a later account by Anthony, his father &#145;was much estranged from the Catholic faith&#146;  (Kenny, 468). As a result the parents followed the not unusual procedure of raising their six sons as protestants, while their daughter was brought up as a Roman Catholic.<br>
<br>Owing to the missionary activities of the Jesuit Thomas Blackfan (or Bennett), Anthony and three of his brothers converted to Catholicism. At the age of fourteen Anthony went to Flanders and studied at the Jesuit college at Ypres for three years, after which he travelled to Rome to become a priest. He entered the English College at Rome on 4 December 1640 and received minor orders in 1642. Unwilling to subscribe to the usual college oath (which bound students to return to the English mission as soon as they had been ordained) he became a convictor, which meant that he had to pay for his own board and lodging. His ordination took place at St John Lateran on 16 March 1647 and on 20 June of the same year he entered the Society of Jesus at St Andrew's noviciate, Rome. In the following years he went through the various stages of higher Jesuit studies which he completed by being professed of the four vows on 25 March 1658 at Parma.<br>
<br>During these years Bonville also functioned as one of the penitentiaries at Loreto, taught philosophy at Florence, and completed his dissertation, <span class="italic">Conclusiones philosophicae rationibus illustratur</span> (1657). About this time the University of Parma appointed him professor of philosophy and subsequently professor of scholastic divinity.<br>
<br>In 1660 Bonville brought out a short treatise on mathematics, <span class="italic">Problema mathematico-philosophicum tripartitum</span>. Shortly afterwards he transferred to the English province of the Society of Jesus and was sent to the English Jesuit college at Li&egrave;ge where he stayed for the rest of his life, working as a professor of theology and mathematics and, from 1661 to 1674, as rector. At Li&egrave;ge he wrote his two most important works, <span class="italic">Fundamentum totius theologia moralis, seu, Tractatus de conscientia probabili</span> (1668) and the posthumously published <span class="italic">Regula morum, sive, Tractatus bipartitus de sufficienti ad conscientiam rite formandam regula</span> (1677). These two works established Bonville's reputation as one of the most systematical expounders of the seventeenth-century moral-theological doctrine of probabilism, whose central tenet was that when faced with a choice between two courses of action, neither of which has been explicitly condemned by the church, it is permissible to choose one course of action even though it is probable that the other course of action is morally safer. In his <span class="italic">Florus Anglo-Bavaricus</span> (1685) John Keynes had high praise for Bonville's intelligence, erudition, and personal charm. Bonville died at the Jesuit college at Li&egrave;ge on 11 October 1676.<br>
