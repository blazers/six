<span class="headword">Sparkes,  John Charles Lewis</span>  (1832/3&#150;1907), <span class="occ">educationist and college head</span>, was among the most prominent art educationists of the Victorian period. He was the son of John Sparkes, but little is known of his early life except that he was first taught by Paul Naftel in Guernsey and, on arriving in London, pursued his studies at Leigh's academy and the Royal Academy Schools. Advised by Leigh to take up teaching, he entered the art masters' training class at Marlborough House, run by the fledgeling Department of Science and Art, about 1853. A year later, he took charge of the art classes formed by the Revd Robert Gregory at the schools of St Mary-the-Less in Lambeth. From these classes developed the successful Lambeth School of Art, which soon established itself as a leader in the provision of instruction in applied art and design to working artisans, many of whom were employed by local manufacturing firms. Through his friendship with Henry Doulton, Sparkes cultivated a special relationship between the Lambeth School and Doulton's pottery manufactory: from about 1869, the school developed coursework geared to the pottery trade, and the firm provided rooms for students to carry out the work, a link that was maintained until the 1880s when these advanced classes were taken over by the City and Guilds Institute. The result of this collaboration was a new line of &#145;art-pottery&#146;, known popularly as Doulton ware, many items of which were designed by Sparkes.<br>
<br>As an educator, Sparkes proved to be both innovative and resourceful, being among the first art instructors to teach mechanical drawing by setting students to draw actual pieces of machinery as opposed to merely copying flat examples. Despite the technical flavour of such an experiment, he was actually a firm traditionalist in matters of art and design education, espousing throughout his life the approved academic belief that life drawing was the best training for any kind of artistic work. Although his students were generally quite successful in examinations and competitions, his methods were not fully endorsed by his superiors in the Department of Science and Art. When its head, Henry Cole, introduced full payment on results into the national system of art education in 1863, an association of art masters was formed to contest the new minutes, led by Sparkes. A nationwide revolt of art masters managed to attract a great deal of political momentum, projecting Sparkes to the fore of the debate. The masters were eventually defeated, as Cole's system survived a parliamentary inquiry in 1864, but Sparkes had begun to make his mark administratively.<br>
<br>In 1875 (after Cole's retirement) Sparkes was invited by Edward J. Poynter to become headmaster of the National Art Training School at South Kensington and was promoted to principal when Poynter relinquished the position in 1881. He remained in this post until retiring in 1898, having reached the age limit. Many famous names can be counted among his pupils, including W. W. Ouless, George Frampton, and Stanhope Forbes. During these years he published works on a wide range of artistic subjects, including <span class="italic">A Handbook to the Practice of Painting</span> (1877), <span class="italic">The Classical Composition of John Flaxman, Sculptor</span> (1879), <span class="italic">Hints on Pottery Painting</span> (1885), <span class="italic">A Manual of Artistic Anatomy</span> (1888), <span class="italic">Wild Flowers in Art and Nature</span> (1894), and <span class="italic">Potters: their Arts and Crafts</span> (1897). He also contributed to the descriptive catalogue of the Dulwich Picture Gallery (1876&#150;1905) and edited the <span class="roman">Fine-Arts Library</span> series from 1884.<br>
<br>On 1 August 1868 Sparkes married the painter and illustrator Catherine Adeline Edwards (<i>d</i>. 1891), who had been his student at Lambeth and who exhibited many pictures at the Royal Academy between 1866 and 1890, first under her maiden name and then as Mrs C. A. Sparkes after 1870. After her death in 1891, and a few years before his own, Sparkes made arrangements with the Royal Academy to bequeath the proceeds of his Surrey estates towards founding scholarships for female students, in memory of his wife. Afflicted with blindness in his later years, he died on 12 December 1907 at Heathside, Ewhurst, Surrey.<br>
