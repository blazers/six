<span class="headword">Bancroft,  John</span>  (1655&#150;1696), <span class="occ">playwright and surgeon</span>, was born in London, perhaps in the Postern, on 3 June 1655, the son of John Bancroft (<i>bap</i>. 1614, <i>d</i>. 1705), sergeant carver to the lord mayor from 1660, and his second wife, Rebecka, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cole (<i>bap</i>. 1631, <i>d</i>. 1711). His younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95053/', "Francis Bancroft")</script> became a noted financial agent and benefactor of Bancroft's School, Mile End, London. John was apprenticed to the surgeon Richard Wiseman on 3 September 1669 and later practised in the fashionable Covent Garden area. Becoming &#145;infected by the Vicinity of the Wits with Poetry&#146;  (Gildon, 5), he wrote a blank-verse tragedy, <span class="italic">Sertorius</span>, which was staged at Drury Lane early in 1679 and published shortly afterwards as by &#145;John Bancroft, Gent.&#146; It was not a success. His <span class="italic">King Edward the Third</span>, premi&egrave;red late in 1690, was published anonymously in 1691. The actor William Mountfort signed the dedicatory letter, describing the play as &#145;a Present to me&#146;. Mountfort doubtless prepared the play for the stage and oversaw the production; the epilogue stated that the author's payment was to go to &#145;the Player&#146;. It fitted the political temper of the time and did well, Queen Mary and her maids of honour seeing it at Drury Lane on 4 February 1691. An anonymous adaptation, <span class="italic">The Fall of Mortimer</span>, was popular in 1731 as an anti-Walpole piece. The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Journal</span> for October 1692 (appearing in late November) announced: &#145;A new Play, by the Author of that call'd <span class="italic">Edward the Third</span>, which gave such universal satisfaction, hath been acted several times with applause&#146;  (p. 24). This was <span class="italic">Henry the Second</span>, which also appeared anonymously in 1693 with a dedication signed by Mountfort, who presumably again reworked the play where necessary. The play had strong acting roles for Thomas Betterton as the king, Elizabeth Barry as the jealous queen, and Anne Bracegirdle as the fair Rosamond. It opened on 8 November 1692 and was performed every day until at least 14 November, when the queen was present. Late in the evening of 9 December Mountfort was attacked by Captain Richard Hill and Lord Mohun, after their failed attempt at abducting Anne Bracegirdle. Bancroft, hurriedly summoned to Mountfort's house after midnight, found the actor &#145;very Desperately wounded&#146;  (Egerton MS 2623, fol. 47<i>v</i>) and stayed with him until four o'clock. He returned at eight, remaining until he was called to give evidence to the justices. Mountfort, who died that afternoon, told Bancroft that Hill, not Mohun, stabbed him. Bancroft was a witness at Mohun's trial, Hill having escaped.<br>
<br>John Bancroft married Diana King (1658&#150;1709) of Ashby-de-la-Launde, Lincolnshire. Four of their children, three of whom died in infancy, were baptized at St Paul's, Covent Garden, between 1681 and 1692, and Bancroft was buried there on 1 September 1696.<br>
