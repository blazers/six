<span class="headword">Cook,  Arthur Bernard</span>  (1868&#150;1952), <span class="occ">classical scholar and archaeologist</span>, was born in Hampstead, London, on 22 October 1868, the son of William Henry Cook MD (1825&#150;1882) and his wife, Harriet Bickersteth (1830&#150;1918), of a family which produced several noted evangelical figures, including her brother, Edward Henry Bickersteth, who became bishop of Exeter. Cook was a scholar of St Paul's School in a brilliant period. He matriculated in 1887, holding a major scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge. He obtained first classes in both parts of the classical tripos (1889, 1891), won the Craven scholarship (1889), the chancellor's medal for English verse (1889), the chancellor's first medal for classics (1891), and the members' prize for Latin essay (1892). His older brother, Edward Bickersteth Cook, had died in 1881, but his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38473/', "Albert Ruskin Cook (1870&#150;1951)")</script> followed him to Trinity, also holding a major scholarship, to read natural sciences before becoming a physician and medical missionary.<br>
<br>Henry Jackson, praelector in ancient philosophy and later regius professor of Greek, exercised a remarkable and richly merited influence on men reading classics at Trinity in Cook's time, and it was no accident that Cook's first book was <span class="italic">The Metaphysical Basis of Plato's &#145;Ethics&#146;</span> (1895). But there were other forces to influence him in his formative years. In his inaugural lecture Cook paid tribute to John Henry Middleton, the Slade professor of art, and Charles Waldstein (later Sir Charles Walston), the first reader in classical archaeology and director of the Fitzwilliam Museum. The former he recalled as &#145;a realist with a grasp of facts&#146; but the latter as &#145;prolix, polysyllabic, on occasion plethoric, but always persuasive and not seldom convincing&#146;  (A. B. Cook, <span class="italic">The Rise and Progress of Classical Archaeology</span>, 1931, 51&#150;2). Comparative philology as part of the classical tripos had been an important influence on Cook. James Frazer was also a Cambridge presence, not teaching but working in the full enthusiasm of the movement of thought to which E. B. Tylor and William Robertson Smith had given so powerful an impulse. In England as elsewhere the history of religion then excited interest as perhaps never before or since. Cook's deep and continuing evangelical convictions predisposed him towards thought on these things, without alienating him from those who shared his interest but not his beliefs.<br>
<br>Cook applied for the chair of Greek at University College, London, in 1892 at the time that A. E. Housman was elected to the chair of Latin. Although the application failed, perhaps because of Cook's youth and inexperience, he was appointed professor of Greek at Bedford College, London, in 1893, a post he held until 1907. At the same time he was elected to a fellowship at Trinity, which he held until 1899. He led a dual life, commuting by train to London, where he taught, and returning to Cambridge for research and writing. London also gave him access to the riches of the collections in the British Museum which were to stimulate his writing. In 1894 he married Emily (<i>d</i>. 1943), daughter of George Thomas Maddox, of Hampstead. They had one daughter, Phyllis, and a son who died in infancy.<br>
<br>Cook was influenced by other students of Greek religion in Cambridge, notably by Jane Harrison, Gilbert Murray, and Francis Cornford. Some have seen Cook as a marginal member of this group, and Murray recalled that Cook &#145;was a great help to us, but not one of us&#146;  (letter to Jessie Stewart, 26 Oct 1953: Beard, 116). At one point he formed part of a select class with Frazer, Jane Harrison, and Francis Cornford, learning Hebrew at the feet of Robert Hatch Kennett, the regius professor of Hebrew. Cook's interest in Greek religion was developed in a series of articles&#151;for example, &#145;Animal worship in the Mycenaean age&#146; (1894) and &#145;The bee in Greek mythology&#146; (1895), both in the <span class="italic">Journal of Hellenic Studies</span>, and the noteworthy &#145;Greek votive offerings&#146; in <span class="italic">Folk-Lore</span> (1903). The <span class="italic">Classical Review</span> contains his highly original and stimulating papers &#145;Associated reminiscences&#146; (1901) and &#145;Unconscious iterations&#146; (1902). He also started work on an edition of Theocritus. Cook was to supply the commentary on the historical and archaeological material, and Peter Giles, master of Emmanuel College in Cambridge from 1911 to 1935, the compilation of a critical text. The study was never published, though the manuscript was presented, after Cook's death, to the Cambridge University Library.<br>
<br>Following the expiry of his fellowship at Trinity, Cook was elected lecturer in classics at Queens' College in 1900, and a fellow in 1903. In 1907 he resigned the chair at Bedford College and became reader in classical archaeology at Cambridge. This was the period when his focus started to turn to Zeus. A series of papers in the <span class="italic">Classical Review</span> between 1902 and 1906, and another in <span class="italic">Folk-Lore</span> between 1903 and 1907, were the forerunners of his monumental <span class="italic">Zeus: a Study in Ancient Religion</span> (3 vols. in 5, 1914, 1925, and 1940), which the Revd C. T. Wood, the senior fellow of Queens' College, described as &#145;an incredibly rich mine of information on most forms of religion&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Queens' College Record</span>, 5). This study shows a fabulous command of every kind of material which could be brought to bear on the subject&#151;ancient literature, monumental evidence, the Near Eastern background, and folklore and folk-ways from all parts, all presented with supreme accuracy and so indexed as to be instantly available. <span class="italic">Zeus</span> would be indispensable to students in many fields, even if every single conclusion of its author were rejected. Perhaps no one has equalled Cook in his ability to present the views of others with generous fairness and to state objections to his own; no one has surpassed him in awareness of the fact that the ancients took their gods seriously. He constantly brought forth new data and parallels and suggestive ideas, and his sheer knowledge of the works of ancient art was so wide and thorough that his lack of aesthetic taste hardly affected his powers of interpreting and illustrating them. His sense of historical criticism and chronological stratification was weak: he drew confident inferences for early times from very late writers, and he never appreciated Wissowa's fundamental discovery of the contrast between the religious heritages of Rome and Greece. Nevertheless, recognition of Cook's research came in 1941 with his election as a fellow of the British Academy, following the publication of the third volume of <span class="italic">Zeus</span> (1940). Cook was also a foreign member of the American Philosophical Society and the German Archaeological Institute, as well as a member of the Folklore Society.<br>
<br>In Cambridge Cook's responsibilities included the curatorship of the Museum of Classical Archaeology in Little St Mary's Lane, which housed the cast collection. He also brought order to the library. Women were permitted to attend his lectures on Greek sculpture, although in 1920 Cook voted against awarding degrees to women, much to the annoyance of his friend Jane Harrison. He proceeded LittD in 1926. In 1928 he became general editor for Methuen's <span class="roman">Handbooks of Archaeology</span>, a role he retained until 1949. Former pupils wrote volumes for the series, such as Winifred Lamb of the Fitzwilliam Museum with <span class="italic">Greek and Roman Bronzes</span> (1929), and Charles T. Seltman with <span class="italic">Greek Coins</span> (1933). In 1931 Cook became the first holder of the Laurence chair of classical archaeology, from which he retired in 1934 to be succeeded by Alan J. B. Wace. In the following year Cook was elected vice-president of Queens' College.<br>
<br>Cook travelled widely in the Mediterranean to pursue his research&#151;to Italy, Sicily, Greece, and Turkey. He formed his own collection of antiquities, including Greek and Roman coins, to support his studies; most were dispersed before his death. For example, some items were presented to the Liverpool Museum, which had been badly damaged during the Second World War. A head of Aphrodite, allegedly collected on the Athenian acropolis in 1890, was presented to Queens' College and was placed in the library. A twelfth-century manuscript of the Pauline epistles and a thirteenth-century manuscript of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> were presented to Ridley Hall in 1947. A small selection of items was bequeathed to the Fitzwilliam Museum by his daughter. A further selection of antiquities was purchased by the Otago Museum in Dunedin, New Zealand, after Cook's death, in part through the good offices of A. D. Trendall.<br>
<br>Unlike his friend Frazer, Cook could not live a life of pure research, and he probably would not have wished to do so. He was an admirable lecturer, always clear, thorough, and entertaining; he was supremely helpful to younger men, whether undergraduates or colleagues. Anyone who came to consult him was sure to go away with &#145;a pocket of references&#146; and a sense of encouragement. His weight of learning was never oppressive and was accompanied by a warm friendliness, a joy in living, and a puckish humour which went with the twinkle of his keen eyes. His natural instinct for collecting extended to the maintenance of a scrapbook, entitled &#145;Explicanda&#146;, for first-hand accounts of the unexplained and of extrasensory perception. He never seemed pressed for time and knew how to relax in talk or tennis or travel; his spare, wiry physique appeared to sustain his long labours with ease. Cook's favourite poet was Robert Browning, and he also composed poetry. His satirical &#145;Criticism criticised&#146; was published in the <span class="italic">Cambridge Review</span> (1892). In later years he avoided academic reviewing, quoting &#145;judge not that ye be not judged&#146;. Cook retained his evangelical faith, serving on the council of Ridley Hall, the evangelical Anglican theological college in Cambridge, from 1906. He also served as a Sunday school teacher. He regularly attended evensong at Queens' College, his position next to the preacher enabling him to insert <i>sotto voce</i> comments during the delivery, such as &#145;Come to the point&#146;, or &#145;You have said that already&#146;, or even &#145;Bravo, that's got them&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1943 Cook's wife, Emily, died. One of Cook's last public appearances was in 1948 at the quincentenary celebrations of Queens' College during the visit of the then Queen Elizabeth. Cook bore ill health in his closing years with serene courage and without losing his old gaiety. There are two accounts of deathbed conversations that reflect his continuing mischievous sense of humour. His niece, on a final visit, was talking to a comatose Cook and mentioned that she had just visited the British Museum with her son. Cook opened one eye and asked, &#145;What did you go to see?&#146;, and received the reply, &#145;Well, we had two hours to spare, so we did the lot!&#146; With the words &#145;May you be forgiven&#146;, Cook sank back on his pillow. In another instance the Revd Henry Chadwick, then dean of Queens' College, was reading the opening verses of the 121st psalm to Cook, only to receive the comment, &#145;that is a mistranslation&#146;  (Seltman, 300&#150;01). Cook died at his home, 19 Cranmer Road, Cambridge, on 26 April 1952 and was buried on 2 May following a funeral at Queens' College, Cambridge.<br>
