<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Obote,  (Apolo) Milton</span>  (1925&#150;2005), <span class="occ">prime minister and president of Uganda</span>, was born on 28 December 1925 at Akokoro in Lira district, Lango, northern Uganda, the son of Stanley Opeto Anyanga, a farmer who eventually became a minor chief, and his second wife, Priscilla Acen Eyer.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlypoliticalcareer"></a>Education and early political career</h2>Obote was educated in Church of Uganda (Anglican) schools. Starting his schooling in 1936 at Ibuje elementary vernacular school for boys, he went on to an elementary school at Boroboro, thence to Gulu high school, and finally to Busoga College, Mwiri, where he took his school certificate. At each stage he strove, almost obsessively, to come top of the class. From Mwiri he gained entrance to Makerere College, Kampala, where he wanted to study law, which Makerere did not then teach. He therefore took a general arts course studying English, geography, and general studies. He was at Makerere for the years 1948 and 1949, but he then left after an apparent mix-up over an offer of a place to study law abroad that the protectorate government would not fund. This left him with a grudge against the colonial authority. He went to Kenya briefly before returning to Uganda and finding employment with the construction company Mowlem, and in 1952 joined the newly formed Uganda National Congress. When sent to Kenya for the second time by Mowlem he was active in the Kenya African Union.<br>
<br>There was less popular pressure for independence in Uganda than in Kenya and Tanganyika: there were hardly any white settlers and protectorate rule had been relatively benign. The country faced two main problems on the road to independence. The first was the ambition of the Buganda kingdom to retain the privileged status it had enjoyed under protectorate rule, even if that meant secession. The second was the religious divide between the Roman Catholics and the protestants (the Anglican Church of Uganda). There were virtually no other Christian denominations in Uganda. A plethora of political parties emerged, fissured, and merged again until only two remained: the Democratic Party, identified with the Roman Catholics, and the protestant Uganda People's Congress (UPC), of which Obote emerged as the leader. The parties strove to overcome this sectarian identification but in the pre-independence elections of 1961 the Democratic Party defeated the UPC largely because the mainly protestant Ganda boycotted the election. Benedicto Kiwanuka then became Uganda's first prime minister. When new national elections were held in April 1962 Obote forged an alliance with the royalist Kabaka Yekka (&#145;the king alone&#146;) party of Buganda, in order to win, and succeeded Kiwanuka as prime minister. At independence on 9 October 1962 Obote remained prime minister, as he did following the declaration of a republic exactly a year later, when the <i>kabaka</i> of Buganda, Frederick Mutesa, became president. On 11 November 1963 Obote married Miria Kalule (<i>b</i>. 1936), with whom he had four sons.<h2>
<a name="Primeministerandpresident"></a>Prime minister and president</h2>In January 1964 Obote faced his first challenge in the shape of a mutiny in the over-rapidly expanded army at the main barracks at Jinja, Uganda's second city and the site of the only bridge over the Nile. No one has ever fully explained why the armies of all three east African countries should have mutinied in the same month, though dissatisfaction with pay and promotion were issues. The presidents of all three countries called in British troops to quell the mutinies. Before these could arrive in Uganda, Obote sent Felix Onama, minister of defence, to negotiate with the mutineers. He was taken captive by them and gave in to most of their demands, including huge pay rises and rapid promotions. A contingent of 450 British soldiers then put down the mutiny without a shot being fired. Obote made the mistake that neither of the other east African presidents did, of failing to discipline the mutineers, for which he was later to pay dearly. Among those too rapidly promoted was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/92669/', "Idi Amin")</script>, who had escaped court martial for a massacre committed under his command. He was one of only two Ugandan commissioned officers and neither the governor nor Obote felt it would be wise to court-martial him on the eve of independence. Obote came to regret this decision. The following April, Obote set up the General Service Unit, dedicated to countering insurgency and under the command of Akena Adoko, a close associate.<br>
<br>Having used the Kabaka Yekka to gain power Obote now worked to render this alliance unnecessary and establish a one-party state. By July 1964 sufficient Democratic Party and Kabaka Yekka members of the national assembly had been induced to cross the floor and join the UPC to render the alliance unnecessary. The pretext for Obote to take over the presidency occurred two years later. He was secretly aiding the Simba rebels against President Moise Tshombe of Congo on the grounds that Tshombe was a puppet of Western capitalist interests. Obote kept this secret, even from his cabinet, not all of whom would have approved. Amin was entrusted with gold and ivory by the rebels to be used in payment for arms; he later deposited the equivalent of &pound;24,000 sterling into his personal bank account. Early in 1966, when Obote was away from Kampala, an MP, Daudi Ocheng, who was dying of cancer and knew he would therefore be secure against victimization, accused Amin in the national assembly of embezzling the money and called for an inquiry into the actions of Amin, Obote, and two other government ministers who, he claimed, had taken their share of the proceeds. This call had the overwhelming support of MPs and provided a focus for their distrust of Obote. On his return to Kampala, Obote detained five ministers whom he suspected of plotting to overthrow him, and appointed a judge of the court of appeal of eastern Africa, Sir Clement Nageon De Lestang, to hold an inquiry, whose findings, however, were not published until after Obote had been ousted from power. Obote then introduced a new constitution, which he forced the national assembly to accept unseen (it was known as the &#145;pigeonhole constitution&#146;: MPs were told they could collect it from their pigeonholes after the debate was over). Obote went on to declare himself president with full executive powers and appointed Amin head of the army, which was recruited mainly from the supposedly warlike peoples of northern Uganda, as had been colonial practice.<br>
<br>The <i>kabaka</i> refused to accept Obote's usurpation of power, and on 20 May the Buganda parliament ordered the Ugandan government off Bugandan soil within ten days. Obote's response was to impose a state of emergency and on 24 May he ordered the army under Amin to investigate reports that there was a cache of arms in the <i>kabaka</i>'s palace. The troops overran the palace in a day-long bloody battle in which many Ganda were killed or wounded. The <i>kabaka</i> escaped over the back wall, eventually finding refuge in Britain. The Ganda elsewhere rose in the <i>kabaka</i>'s defence, and were violently suppressed: the army high command had difficulty in restraining the troops. These events left the Ganda with a lasting hatred of Obote. A state of emergency was imposed in Buganda that remained in force as long as Obote remained in power. In September 1967 Obote abolished all the pre-colonial kingdoms of southern and western Uganda. Because the army had been used to resolve a political matter, Obote and all successive Ugandan governments became dependent on it.<br>
<br>In the next two years Obote moved to restrict the Asians who dominated the import&#150;export trade (this was a popular move), and towards the end of 1969 announced the &#145;move to the left&#146;, to be expounded in five documents. The first, announced in October, was the &#145;National service proposal&#146;, and the second in December was &#145;The common man's charter&#146;. A few days later, on 19 December, an assassination attempt was made on Obote in Lugogo stadium. There was no one but soldiers in the area of the stadium from which the shots were fired. Obote was not seriously hurt, but was rushed to hospital through streets where his army escort shot at bystanders. Responsibility for the attempt was never firmly placed, but Amin fled Kampala and was believed to be implicated. Throughout 1970 further policy initiatives were taken to implement the &#145;move to the left&#146;. In April and May many companies were nationalized, investors took fright, and an economic crisis followed, with imported goods ceasing to be available and supermarket shelves emptying while the value of the Ugandan currency fell against both sterling and the dollar. In November 1970 Obote expelled 33,000 Kenyan workers, which damaged the economy further, though some began filtering back fairly soon.<h2>
<a name="TheAminregime"></a>The Amin regime</h2>While Obote was attending a Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Singapore, Amin seized power in a coup on 25 January 1971. The immediate cause seems to have been an attempt by Obote to curb military expenditure. His failure to exert control over the army now proved to be his undoing. It had been a disastrous mistake not to court-martial Amin for the pre-independence massacre and then to promote him. Obote had other shortcomings as well. He lacked the charisma of the other east African leaders, Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya and Julius Nyerere of Tanzania. He was a tactician and manipulator rather than an orator and populist. Uganda lacked any common language in which he could address the nation, nor did Uganda have any slogan around which support could focus, like Kenya's <i>Harambee</i> (&#145;togetherness&#146;) and Tanzania's <i>Ujamaa</i> (&#145;familyhood&#146;). The &#145;move to the left&#146; and &#145;The common man's charter&#146; were attempts to fill this gap, but they came too late and failed to capture the popular imagination.<br>
<br>Throughout the period of Amin's rule Obote was given sanctuary in Tanzania by President Julius Nyerere, who shared his socialist views. The chance of making a comeback occurred in 1978&#150;9 when Amin tried to divert attention away from the murderous factions forming within his army by invading Tanzania's Kagera salient, a triangle of land adjacent to south-west Uganda, in response to alleged provocations by Tanzanian troops. Tanzanian forces, together with a small contingent of Ugandan exiles loyal to Obote, counter-attacked. Finding no serious resistance, they fought their way on foot to Kampala, which they reached on 10 April 1979, and thence pushed through to the Sudan border. Obote had been sidelined at the Moshi unity conference held in March 1979 by exiled Ugandan leaders to plan their next moves. His return to fight elections in early 1980 was engineered by Paulo Muwanga, who had emerged as the strong man, after the two disastrous, but short-lived, presidencies of Yusufu Lule and Godfrey Binaisa. The 1980 elections were shamelessly rigged after the Commonwealth observer group had left so as to return Obote and the UPC to power, a result that was not accepted by a large part of the Ugandan population.<h2>
<a name="Secondpresidency"></a>Second presidency</h2>Obote's second presidency was marked, not mainly by what he did, but by what he omitted to do. His overriding failure was shared with Muwanga: between them they failed to bring the largely untrained Uganda National Liberation Army under control or to prevent tribal factionalism developing within it. Acholi and Langi troops, who had suffered most from Amin, took early revenge against West Nile, the district from which Amin and many of his followers had come. By mid-1983 there were nearly 100,000 refugees from West Nile in Zaire and Sudan. By 1984 a few had returned under a scheme operated by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, but many remained in exile until Obote had been overthrown.<br>
<br>In order to halt the economic decline Obote's government dropped all pretensions to socialism, accepting World Bank and International Monetary Fund advisers. As a result the West, and Britain in particular, turned a blind eye to reports of atrocities. In the context of the cold war, Yoweri Museveni, whose well-disciplined Uganda Resistance Army and Movement was winning popular support in western Uganda, was seen as dangerously left-wing, whereas Obote's new dedication to capitalism aligned Uganda with Western interests in this part of Africa and helped provide a bulwark against socialist Tanzania and Sudan.<br>
<br>The undisciplined forces of the Ugandan army having driven many Ugandans into exile, Obote now turned against those who had taken refuge in Uganda, blaming them for atrocities committed by Uganda's unruly troops. The Rwandese were popular targets, accused of taking land. In 1982 members of the UPC youth wing in Ankole in south-western Uganda turned on those who had been settled on land near the border with Rwanda, and eventually against all Rwandese, no matter how long they had been in Uganda or whether or not they were Ugandan citizens&#151;and many of them were. Many were driven back into Rwanda, where they were not permitted to leave the border areas, or were trapped on the border. All speakers of Kinyarwanda who remained in Uganda were eventually moved to refugee camps elsewhere, whether they were refugees or not. The expulsion of Rwandese and their subsequent mistreatment had long-term consequences. Rwandese naturally turned to support Yoweri Museveni's insurgency and joined the National Resistance Army, which eventually ousted Obote from power. These were the people who subsequently defected from the National Resistance Army and invaded Rwanda in 1990, and it was in the context of this invasion that the Rwandan genocide of 1994 was sparked off.<br>
<br>When Museveni's forces moved to the Luwero Triangle to the north-west of the capital in 1982&#150;3, the Uganda National Liberation Army responded by rounding up the civilian population, placing them in camps, and shooting them as insurgents if they ventured out to find food or water. The Uganda government eventually had to call in the international aid agencies to deal with what the agencies considered an emergency of the government's own making, but one so acute that they felt bound to assist. The atrocities committed by the Uganda National Liberation Army alienated the civilian population and provided support for the well-disciplined National Resistance Army soldiers. Torture was documented by Amnesty International in a report dated 18 June 1985, which shook Britain and Uganda's Western allies. This included a report of the totally unprovoked massacre at Namugongo, not even in the conflict area, of 100 persons including the principal and students of a theological college, and the imam of a nearby mosque.<h2>
<a name="Exileandfinalyears"></a>Exile and final years</h2>Divisions within the army were Obote's eventual undoing. In 1985, in a belated attempt to exercise control over the army, he promoted a clan-relative, Brigadier Smith Opon Acak, as commander-in-chief over the heads of more experienced generals. This act precipitated a putsch led by Bazilio Olara-Okello and Tito Lutwa Okello in which he was ousted from power for the second time. In January 1986 Yoweri Museveni captured Kampala and was proclaimed president.<br>
<br>No neighbouring country would give Obote sanctuary: he eventually found refuge in Zambia, where he was forced to live in semi-isolation but was politically active in supporting the UPC. He only resigned from the chairmanship of his much depleted party early in 2005. His wife, Miria, succeeded him. He died of kidney failure in a Johannesburg hospital a few months later, on 10 October 2005. He was given a state send-off from South Africa when his body was returned to Uganda, and a controversial eight-day lying-in-state and state funeral at All Saints' Cathedral in Kampala, on the order of his old foe, Museveni; he was, after all, the person who had finally led Uganda to independence. His body was then taken to Lango and buried on 22 October at Akokoro, where he had been born.<br>
