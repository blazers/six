<span class="headword">Hawksley,  Bourchier Francis</span>  (1851&#150;1915), <span class="occ">lawyer and imperialist</span>, was born on 4 April 1851 at Barlborough, near Chesterfield, Derbyshire, the son of John Hawksley, a Church of England priest who in 1874 was commissioner to the bishop of Saskatchewan and in 1883 became an honorary canon of Saskatchewan, and his wife, Henrietta Cordelia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jackson. Hawksley became a solicitor, after being articled in Bristol in 1866. He moved to London in 1872 and was married there, on 3 April 1873, to Clara Elizabeth, the daughter of Leonard Addison Duncan, gentleman. By 1881 they had a daughter and a son. It was through his appointment as solicitor for the British South Africa Company's London office that he came into contact with Cecil Rhodes and his imperial project. From 1889 until Rhodes's death in 1902 Hawksley was his trusted lawyer and confidant.<br>
<br>Hawksley never set foot in Africa himself, but in 1889 he was entrusted by Rhodes with concluding the legal formalities that turned a supposed grant of authority from Lobengula, paramount chief of the Ndebele (Matabele), into the British South Africa Company charter. The company proved to be Rhodes's vehicle for the conquest and administration of the lands that later became Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi, as well as for ultimately unsuccessful assaults on Mozambique and Za&iuml;re. Hawksley, an austere, combative man, was entirely committed to Rhodes's &#145;big idea&#146;, the quasi-Jesuitical dream of uniting all English-speaking lands into a commonwealth to improve and save the world. Rhodes's &#145;band of brothers&#146; was the vehicle of mystical imperialism. What Hawksley eventually helped to develop was more practical and lasting. As the drafter of Rhodes's final four versions of his will Hawksley was able to refine what became the Rhodes scholarship scheme, and was almost certainly responsible for the final definition of the qualities to be sought in Rhodes scholars. As an executor of the will, he was an important interpreter of Rhodes's wishes to the committee which implemented the scholarship plan after Rhodes's death.<br>
<br>Hawksley was influential in the selection of the members of the House of Commons select committee of inquiry into the Jameson raid of 1895; he also inspired many of the favourable lines of questions put to Rhodes and his accomplices who testified during the summer of 1897. Under Rhodes's instructions, he refused to reveal a clutch of secret telegrams to the committee. The telegrams, which Hawksley wanted to produce, implicated Joseph Chamberlain (who could protect the company's charter) in the planning of the raid; Rhodes obfuscated, and Hawksley fumed privately. Hawksley also acted to extricate Rhodes from the clutches of Princess Catherine Radziwill, who had been forging his name and causing him financial embarrassment, and, in order to protect the British South Africa Company's share price, managed the news of Rhodes's long illness and death in 1902.<br>
<br>Hawksley was a member of the Liberal Party from the mid-1890s, stood unsuccessfully in 1895 for Holderness, campaigned for several colleagues in 1897, and always hoped that Rhodes would leave Africa for British politics. He died on 22 December 1915 at his home, 14 Hyde Park Gardens, London, and was survived by his wife and at least one daughter.<br>
