<span class="headword">Higginson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ellis]</span>,  Eleanor Beatrice</span>  (1881&#150;1969), <span class="occ">suffragette</span>, was born on 19 April 1881 at 2 Caroline Villas, Plashet Road, Plaistow, London, the eldest of the four children of Alfred Leopold Ellis, a merchant seaman, and his wife, Elizabeth Vernon. Her family moved first to Manchester, then to Preston, Lancashire. There, Eleanor trained as a schoolteacher, working at St Mark's School until she married Arnold Higginson (1879&#150;1938), a chemist, on 9 September 1905. The couple had five children, four of whom survived into adulthood. About 1910 Eleanor opened a health food shop in Preston, which she ran until 1920.<br>
<br>Eleanor Higginson's involvement in the suffrage campaign was at the instigation of another suffragette, Edith Rigby, then honorary secretary of the Preston branch of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). Preston WSPU recruited many women from the Labour Party and the Women's Labour League, and as a prominent Labour Party member Higginson was encouraged to become involved. However, she initially refused the invitation, but agreed to attend local meetings.<br>
<br>Higginson became actively involved in the suffrage movement relatively late in the campaign, in summer 1913. In April 1914 she became the honorary secretary of Preston WSPU, replacing another active suffragette, Elizabeth Ellen (Beth) Hesmondhalgh. Both women ran the Preston branch during late 1913 and early 1914 while its mainstay, Edith Rigby, was in hiding from the authorities.<br>
<br>On 21 May 1914 Higginson took part in a WSPU deputation to the king. The deputation was not received, and in the struggle of protest Higginson, like others, experienced violent treatment from the police. She later said that &#145;they mauled us about the shoulders and we were all of us black and blue the next day&#146;  (Raeburn, 230). She was not arrested, and so returned to the &#145;safe house&#146; that had been arranged by the London membership, where she and the other women who had not been arrested were given stones and asked to go out and break windows in protest at the king's refusal to hear the deputation.<br>
<br>Higginson threw a brick at a pub window, and was soon arrested along with a total of sixty-five other women and two men. The scenes in court as the accused were committed for trial were chaotic, and Higginson was eventually charged, alongside two other women, with breaking a shop window in Parliament Street. Of the three charged, one pleaded guilty, while the other two were convicted by jury. All were sentenced to four months in prison.<br>
<br>In Holloway gaol Higginson adopted a hunger and thirst strike and was released after less than two weeks under the provisions of the <span class="roman">&#145;Cat and Mouse Act&#146;</span>. This act allowed prisoners debilitated by hunger strikes to be released under licence, giving them time to recover before they were fit to be re-arrested and returned to prison. Higginson was released for about three weeks before being re-arrested and detained in Holloway for three days, after which she was again released on licence owing to ill health. The First World War broke out before she was required to return to prison, and thus she benefited from the amnesty that was then declared for all suffragette prisoners.<br>
<br>Like the WSPU leadership, the Preston branch called off its suffrage campaign during the war, and instead Higginson and her colleague Edith Rigby organized a jam-making enterprise to combat the food shortage. When the war and the campaign for the vote were over, Higginson turned to local politics. She took a keen interest in local government throughout the remainder of her life, becoming a local magistrate and from 1940 to 1945 serving as a representative on Preston town council. She took Workers' Education Association classes in Preston, was a delegate to Preston's trades and labour council and also unsuccessfully stood as a local government candidate for Ashton ward.<br>
<br>Throughout her life Higginson kept in touch with Edith Rigby and a number of her suffragette colleagues. Her husband, Arnold, died on 10 June 1938, and in 1954 she moved to Bognor Regis, Sussex, where she lived for the remainder of her life with her old WSPU colleague Beth Hesmondhalgh. Eleanor Higginson died in St Richard's Hospital, Chichester, on 8 June 1969, aged eighty-eight.<br>
