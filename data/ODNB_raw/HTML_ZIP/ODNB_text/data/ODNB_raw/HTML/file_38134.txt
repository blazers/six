<span class="headword">Williamson,  James</span>, Baron Ashton  (1842&#150;1930), <span class="occ">linoleum manufacturer</span>, was born on 31 December 1842 in Lancaster, the third of five sons (three of whom died in infancy) and the fourth of six children of James Williamson (<i>d</i>. 1879), originally of Keswick, painter, decorator, and later oilcloth manufacturer of Lancaster, and his wife, Eleanor, daughter of Leonard Miller, innkeeper of the Blue Anchor, Lancaster. He was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Lancaster and at a private school in Cheshire.<br>
<br>Williamson entered the family business, assuming personal control in 1875. He quickly expanded the business, which was based on linoleum, and he was the first to see the potential of the mass-production of this product as a cheap, effective floor covering. Cork linoleum was produced in Lancaster from 1887, and the firm rapidly became the largest of its type in Britain, with important overseas interests, including a factory in Antwerp, and major colonial markets. The Lune Mills factory in Lancaster grew to employ more than 4000 hands. Williamson's relations with his workforce were ambivalent. He behaved as a benevolent autocrat, but was reluctant to delegate, being suspicious and secretive. He kept hands in work after their most productive years and was reluctant to dismiss them when trade was slack. But his concern for profit margins kept wage levels low and he prevented the trade unions from recruiting among his workforce. He fought many battles with the early Labour Party in Lancaster, and it was alleged that he discriminated against socialist employees.<br>
<br>Williamson used some of his vast wealth to provide permanent evidence of his beneficence. He developed the park donated by his father and provided an imposing neo-Georgian town hall in 1909. His best-remembered gift was the impressive domed Ashton memorial built on a site dominating Lancaster. Williamson donated more than &pound;500,000 to Lancaster and about &pound;100,000 to Lytham St Anne's, where he spent an increasing amount of time after 1913.<br>
<br>Williamson's political career was not extensive. He served on Lancaster town council from 1871 to 1880 and was MP for the Lancaster division of North Lancashire from 1886 to 1895, when he retired to accept a peerage (as Baron Ashton), allegedly in return for a contribution of &pound;10,000 to Liberal Party funds. He became high sheriff of the county palatine in 1885 and constable of Lancaster Castle in 1921. While in the Commons he was a staunch, if silent, Gladstonian Liberal. He later became a Conservative.<br>
<br>From about 1913 onwards Williamson became a reclusive eccentric, shunning both London and local society. He was married three times. In 1869 he married Margaret, daughter of Joseph Gatey, draper, of Keswick, Cumberland; two daughters were born before she died in 1877. Three years later he married Jessy Henrietta Hume, widowed daughter of James Stewart of Clapham, Yorkshire, who died in 1904. His third wife, whom he married in 1909, was Florence Maude, daughter of the Revd Robert Daniel of Osbaldwick, Yorkshire, and widow of Colonel J. Lawson Whalley. Williamson died intestate on 27 May 1930 at his home, Ryelands, Lancaster, leaving a fortune of 9.5 million pounds, the largest intestate legacy in British history to that point.<br>
