<span class="headword">Boston,  Thomas</span>  (1713&#150;1767), <span class="occ">a founder of the Relief church</span>, was born at Ettrick, Selkirkshire, on 3 April 1713, the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2943/', "Thomas Boston (1676&#150;1732)")</script> and Katharine Boston, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brown (1674&#150;1737). After receiving his early education from his father and his brother John, he attended the grammar school in Hawick. In 1728 he entered Edinburgh University, returning home in January 1729 to be educated by his father. In December 1730 he returned to the university to &#145;attend the school of divinity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 453). He was licensed by the presbytery of Selkirk on 1 August 1732 and ordained to Ettrick on 4 August 1733. On 26 April 1738 he married Elizabeth Anderson (<i>d</i>. 1787) of Tushielaw, Tweedsmuir; they had one son, Michael, and four daughters. In 1749 Boston moved to Oxnam in Roxburghshire, where he began his ministry on 10 August.<br>
<br>Soon after the death of their previous minister the elders of the parish of Jedburgh, along with the town council, indicated to their patron, the marquess of Lothian, that they would like Boston to be their next pastor. Oxnam was only 3 miles from Jedburgh, and Boston was a popular preacher. It would appear that a personal dispute had offended the marquess and he presented John Bonar, another member of the popular party within the Church of Scotland. Following various delays the general assembly in May 1756 took the decision that John Bonar should not be called as minister of Jedburgh. The next candidate to be presented and then called was John Douglas, minister of Kenmore. The people of Jedburgh objected to Douglas and Thomas Boston demitted his charge at Oxnam on Sunday 4 December 1757, informing the presbytery of his decision only on the following Wednesday. The fact that he first made his decision known to the kirk session rather than to the presbytery may indicate his own conviction that he was accountable to the local congregation, the community which called him, rather than the presbytery. His appearance at the presbytery on 7 December drew so large a crowd that the Jedburgh church was damaged. A large meeting-house had already been built and Boston was admitted as pastor of the new church on 9 December 1757.<br>
<br>Boston made it clear that his actions were not to be interpreted as being a final break with the Church of Scotland. In a letter to the presbytery of Jedburgh he stated his desire to &#145;hold ministerial and Christian communion with all who faithfully avouch the Gospel system&#146; and justified his &#145;partial secession as being a response to the unlawful use of patronage&#146;. When he was inducted to his new independent congregation, he promised to &#145;hold communion with &hellip; his brethren in the Lord, if an opportunity shall be afforded him&#146; and added that he intended to keep himself from &#145;Sectarianism&#146;  (Morren, 2.155&#150;7).<br>
<br>The general assembly of May 1758 prohibited any minister of the Church of Scotland from assisting Boston in any ministerial function. Therefore, when the Jedburgh church decided to celebrate its first communion season in August 1758 Boston turned to Thomas Gillespie, who had been deposed from the ministry in 1752 because of his opposition to the law of patronage. In 1761 Boston joined with Thomas Gillespie to induct Thomas Colier as minister of the Relief congregation in Colinsburgh in Fife and to form the presbytery of Relief and serve as its first moderator. The three men were clear in their conviction that every member of every congregation should have a vote in the election of their own minister. In an age of increasing division among Presbyterian groups within Scotland, the presbytery of Relief sought to maintain fellowship with all Christians within every section of the church. The Relief church became a symbol of the liberality of the grace of God which it preached, and expressed the Enlightenment concepts of toleration and freedom, virtues which would eventually bring about the healing of some of the divisions within Scottish presbyterianism in 1847.<br>
<br>In 1765 a large Relief congregation in Glasgow attempted to call Boston as their minister. Initially he declined the invitation because he was not in good health. A fresh approach was made in which it was suggested that his son, Michael, might be appointed as an assistant minister and successor. The proposal was accepted and Boston went to Glasgow to preach, but the congregation then voted against issuing a call to him. A popular speaker, he was described by David Brogue as being &#145;the most commanding preacher he had ever heard&#146;  (Struthers, 150).<br>
<br>Boston's several published sermons give some indication of the ministry which he exercised as a pastor. One of his most significant publications was the printing of his father's essay on schism (1758), with a preface by Boston, in which he justified the foundation of a separate Presbyterian denomination in Scotland which avoided the censorious attitude of the Original seceders towards the Church of Scotland. Boston died on 13 February 1767 and was buried in the tower at Jedburgh Abbey. He was survived by his wife, who died on 21 June 1787 in the home of her youngest daughter, Margaret, who was married to William Campbell, minister of the Relief congregation in Dysart, Fife. Two more daughters married ministers of the Relief church and his fourth daughter, Christian, moved to South Carolina to marry Dr Tucker Harris in Charleston. Boston's son Michael became minister of the Relief congregation in Falkirk.<br>
