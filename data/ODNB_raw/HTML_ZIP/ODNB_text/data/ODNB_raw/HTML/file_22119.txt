<span class="headword">Philips,  Ambrose</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1674, <em>d.</em> 1749), <span class="occ">poet and playwright</span>, was born in Shrewsbury, of a Warwickshire family, and baptized there on 9 October 1674, the fourth son of Ambrose Philips (<i>d</i>. 1677), a draper, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brookes (1648&#150;1712), of Montgomeryshire. He was not, as Robert Shiels (<span class="italic">Lives of the Poets</span>, 1753) believed, of the Leicestershire branch of the family of which Sir Ambrose Philips (<i>d</i>. 1706) was a distinguished member. <br>
<br>Philips was educated at Shrewsbury School and at St John's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted fellow in 1699, and remained in residence until 1704. He held a variety of posts throughout his life, none very distinguished or lucrative. He was commissioned captain-lieutenant in Colonel Breton's regiment of foot in 1705, campaigned in Spain, was captured after Almanza in 1707, but escaped and returned to Britain by the end of that year. In January 1709 he went to Denmark as secretary to the British envoy and, with a break in London, remained there until the end of 1710. <br>
<br>In 1695 Philips contributed a poem on the death of Queen Mary to a Cambridge collection, <span class="italic">Lacrymae Cantabrigienses</span>, presented to the royal family, and in 1700 he wrote a short life of John Williams, archbishop of York, a benefactor of his college. His 1748 collection includes a poem on the death of King William (1702) and a verse &#145;Epistle from Utrecht&#146; (1703). From about 1704 he was composing pastoral verses, two of which were praised by Joseph Addison in a letter of 10 March 1705. All six of his <span class="italic">Pastorals</span> were published in Jacob Tonson's <span class="italic">Miscellany</span> of 1709, as were Alexander Pope's. Praise of Philips's poems eventually excited a sardonic riposte from Pope in <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, number 40 (27 April 1713). (Johnson and others report that Philips hung up a rod at Button's Coffee House with which to avenge himself on Pope for this attack;  (S. Johnson, <span class="italic">Lives of the English Poets</span>, ed. G. B. Hill, 1905, 3.320).) Another work that had secured Philips admirers was a <span class="italic">Winter Piece</span> evocatively describing the rigours of the Danish winter, which appeared in <span class="italic">The Tatler</span>, number 12 (7 May 1709). <br>
<br>Philips did not marry. He refers in <span class="italic">The Freethinker</span>, number 103, to a &#145;broken love-promise&#146;. A letter from Jonathan Swift (30 Oct 1708) refers to a &#145;Geneva&#146; lady Philips evidently admired, and it may be in this connection that in a letter of 15 December 1710 Swift, by then very influential, refers to Addison's &#145;soliciting me to make another of his friends queen's secretary at Geneva; and I'll do it if I can, it is poor Pastoral Philips&#146;. Philips did not get the post. <br>
<br>In early 1711 Philips went from Denmark to Italy as tutor, or chaperone, to the 24-year-old Simon Harcourt, son of the lord chancellor, an appointment that must have been grating to both, as the young man was something of a tearaway as well as a Jacobite, and Philips a rather prim and rigid whig. He was close to Addison during this period and may have acted for him as amanuensis or secretary. With his play <span class="italic">The Distrest Mother</span> (1712)&#151;almost a translation of Racine's <span class="italic">Andromaque</span> in Johnson's judgement  (S. Johnson, <span class="italic">Lives of the English Poets</span>, ed. G. B. Hill, 1905, 3.320)&#151;Philips enjoyed real success, partly perhaps attributable to <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>'s endorsement and partly to a highly popular comic epilogue by Budgell spoken by Mrs Oldfield, whose &#145;manner of speaking the Epilogue &hellip; greatly contributed to the success of this play, and which whenever revived, the Audience have always insisted on&#146;  (W. Egerton [E. Curll], <span class="italic">Faithful Memoirs &hellip; of Mrs Oldfield</span>, 1731, 35). In 1714 Philips was briefly tutor to George I's grandchildren. He was appointed paymaster of the lottery in 1715, which afforded him &pound;500 per annum for himself and his staff. In the same year he was made a justice of the peace. For most of the next decade Philips was engaged with writing for various periodicals. Philips's later historical play <span class="italic">The Briton</span> (1722) and his protestant propaganda piece <span class="italic">Humphrey Duke of Gloucester</span> (1723), derived from <span class="italic">2 Henry VI</span>, earned him no further fame as a dramatist. Much more successful had been the 350 issues of the whiggish periodical <span class="italic">The Freethinker</span> (24 March 1718 &#150; 28 July 1721) which he founded and wrote much of: contemporaries ranked this after only <span class="italic">The Tatler</span> and <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>. His <span class="italic">Collection of Old Ballads</span> (1723&#150;5) was innovatory and anticipated later interest in indigenous ballads. At the same time his <span class="italic">Proposals for Printing an English Dictionary</span> (which did not materialize) impressively anticipated many features of Johnson's <span class="italic">Dictionary</span>. <br>
<br>Philips's later verse included poems addressing the children of aristocratic acquaintances: their intended charm excited the derision of fellow writers and earned him the nickname &#145;Namby-Pamby&#146;, his most lasting, if involuntary, contribution to the language. The style of Philips's poem &#145;To the Honourable Miss Carteret&#146; (1725) and the motives that prompted it are scabrously lampooned in Henry Carey's <span class="italic">Namby-Pamby</span> (1725?):<blockquote>
<div>All ye poets of the age,<br>
</div>
<div>All ye witlings of the stage &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>Namby-Pamby is your guide,<br>
</div>
<div>Albion's joy, Hibernia's pride.<br>
</div>
<div>Namby-Pamby, pilly-piss,<br>
</div>
<div>Rhimy-pim'd on Missy Miss<br>
</div>
<div>Tartaretta Tartaree<br>
</div>
<div>From the navel to the knee;<br>
</div>
<div>That her father's gracy grace<br>
</div>
<div>Might give him a placy place.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>In November 1724, aged fifty, Philips had gone to Dublin with Boulter, the bigoted anti-Irish primate of all Ireland. In 1727 Philips was given the insignificant post of purse-bearer to the lord chancellor, and later that year was returned as member for Armagh, retaining his seat in the Irish House of Commons until his death. Boulter angled unsuccessfully for appointments for Philips, who eventually turned to the law in 1734, became a public notary and was appointed registrar for the court of facilities and the prerogative court. He prepared an edition of his poems in 1748, and probably returned to London in that year, where he died in early June 1749. He was buried on 4 June at the Grosvenor Chapel, Audley Street. <br>
<br>Johnson's assertion that &#145;Philips became ridiculous, without his own fault, by the absurd admiration of his friends&#146;  (S. Johnson, <span class="italic">Lives of the English Poets</span>, ed. G. B. Hill, 1905, 3.320) is most apt to the period about 1712 when Philips was closest to Addison, <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> praised his pastorals above Pope's, and <span class="italic">The Distrest Mother</span> enjoyed an unwarranted success. In general, however, if Philips was not brilliant he was competent. Even Pope, before becoming riled by <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>'s devaluation of his own pastorals, recognized the quality of Philips's in a letter to Henry Cromwell, and also particularly commended the early <span class="italic">Winter Piece</span>: &#145;This Gentleman &hellip; is capable of writing very nobly, as I guess by a small Copy of his &hellip; on the Danish Winter; Tis a very Lively Piece of Poetical Painting, and I recommend it particularly to your Perusall&#146;  (Pope to Cromwell, 28 Oct 1710). Philips was not a hack beneath notice but he lacked the deftness and wit of Pope and his friends, and his whiggish sympathies may have exacerbated the ridicule of the so-called tory satirists. His sycophantic and sentimental later verse, including that to children, perhaps merited the obloquy it attracted. Swift, an early friend who had later turned against him, seems to have taken something of Philips's measure: &#145;Philips is a complainer &hellip; and Complainers never succeed at Court though Railers do&#146;  (Swift, 29 Sept 1725). <br>
<br>Philips's twentieth-century editor, M. G. Segar, noted that Philips reportedly thought he looked like Julius Caesar, and Caesar of course was also fatally wounded by his former friends. Joseph Spence describes Philips as &#145;of lean make and pale complexion, extremely neat in his dress and five feet seven inches high&#146;  (J. Spence, <span class="italic">Anecdotes</span>, ed. J. M. Osborn, 1966, 1.340). However moderate in his talents, and however much ridiculed, Philips had a place in the Augustan world of letters. A contemporary obituary notice described him as &#145;the last survivor of the excellent authors of the spectators, tatlers and guardians, author of the <span class="italic">Distressed Mother</span>; and several other pieces&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 19, 1749, 284). In fact, as Segar notes, Philips may have been ahead of his times rather than a &#145;survivor&#146;: his sentimentalism was perhaps more in tune with the emergent cult of sensibility than the writing of the wittier, cleverer, more talented authors who mocked him.<br>
