</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hemmings,  David Leslie Edward</span>  (1941&#150;2003), <span class="occ">actor, director, and producer</span>, was born on 18 November 1941 at Mount Alvernia maternity home, Harvey Road, Guildford, Surrey, the son of Arthur Percy Charles Hemmings, a grocer's salesman then serving as a corporal in the Royal Air Force, and his wife, Kathleen Lilian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wharf. At the time of his birth his parents were living at 16 Gravetts Lane, Worplesdon, Surrey. He was educated at Glyn College, Epsom, but his formal education was interrupted by his illustrious career as a boy soprano. He spent five years, from the age of nine, touring Europe with the English Opera Group; his stage d&eacute;but was in the role of Miles in the premi&egrave;re of Benjamin Britten's opera <span class="italic">The Turn of the Screw</span> (Teatro La Fenice, Venice, 14 September 1954). Hemmings's singing career came to an abrupt, if unsurprising, end when his voice broke during a performance in Paris. He declined an offer to study to be a tenor, preferring to attend Epsom Art College, where he showed considerable aptitude for painting, having an exhibition of watercolours when he was fifteen.<br>
<br>Temperamentally restless, Hemmings left to pursue an acting career, touring in repertory, having a season at the Royal Court Theatre, and appearing in numerous radio and television series including <span class="italic">Dixon of Dock Green</span>. His first feature film, <span class="italic">Five Clues to Fortune</span>, made for the Children's Film Foundation in 1956, was followed by more substantial roles and the lead in two rather anodyne &#145;youth&#146; films, <span class="italic">Live It Up</span> (1963) and <span class="italic">Be My Guest</span> (1965), but stardom eluded him until <span class="italic">Blow-Up</span> (1966). Moulding his performance to Michelangelo Antonioni's directorial vision, Hemmings's fashion photographer (widely assumed to be a portrait of David Bailey) was profoundly ambivalent, arrogantly hedonistic, but uncertain as to the meaning and purpose of his life. Provocatively enigmatic, <span class="italic">Blow-Up</span> became one of the most widely acclaimed films of the 1960s, symbolizing swinging London and counter-cultural rebellion. With his blond, blue-eyed good looks that suggested something darker within, a fascinating combination of earthiness and ethereality, Hemmings became an iconic figure, one of a new breed of English actors who were young, sexy, and &#145;liberated&#146;, both on- and off-screen.<br>
<br>Hemmings married, on 25 March 1961, Genista Mary Ouvry (Jenny Lewes), a 21-year-old actress and daughter of Romilly Ouvry, a wealthy solicitor. They had met when they were both working in repertory in Leicester. They had a daughter, Deborah Jane, but divorced in 1964. After becoming a star Hemmings enjoyed a celebrity lifestyle and numerous affairs, moving to Hollywood and marrying, amid much fanfare, the Texan-born actress Gayle Hunnicutt in Los Angeles on 16 November 1968. They had one son, Nolan, who bore a striking resemblance to his father and also became an actor.<br>
<br>Now an international star playing one of the cameo roles in <span class="italic">Barbarella</span> (1968), Hemmings's strongest performances were as ambivalent, divided characters: the idealistic but ill-fated Captain Nolan in <span class="italic">The Charge of the Light Brigade</span> (1968), the stranded paratrooper in <span class="italic">The Long Day's Dying</span> (1968), King Alfred in <span class="italic">Alfred the Great</span> (1969), inclined to spiritual contemplation but forced to defend his kingdom against the viking invaders, and attractive but flawed anti-heroes in three psychological thrillers: <span class="italic">The Walking Stick</span> (1970), <span class="italic">Fragment of Fear</span> (1971), and <span class="italic">Unman, Wittering and Zigo</span> (1971).<br>
<br>Despite his success Hemmings regarded acting as rather limited&#151;&#145;as an actor you're really just a tool&#146;&#151;whereas directing was both &#145;much more creative&#146; and &#145;the only way you can have full artistic control&#146;  (<span class="italic">TV Times</span>, 16 Aug 1973). His d&eacute;but film as director, <span class="italic">Running Scared</span> (1972), starring his wife, Gayle Hunnicutt, and Robert Powell, was an ambitious melodrama, strongly influenced by Antonioni in its cool objectivity and elliptical narrative. Although critically admired, it was not a commercial success. <span class="italic">The 14</span> (1973), an unsentimental depiction of slum children trying to survive after their mother's death, fared better, but <span class="italic">Just a Gigolo</span> (1979), starring David Bowie and Marlene Dietrich, was an ambitious misfire. Concurrently Hemmings worked as a producer both in Britain and abroad. An able and astute businessman, Hemmings, with John Daly, founded Hemdale Corporation in June 1967, a group of fourteen interlocking companies that allowed stars to exchange higher taxed income for lower taxed capital investment, as well as offering an attractive package of financial, legal, and publicity services. After several well-publicized boardroom battles Hemmings left the company in 1970.<br>
<br>After Hemmings's marriage to Gayle Hunnicutt was dissolved in 1975, he moved to Chelsea and married Prudence Jane de Casembroot, who had been his secretary for five years, on 19 March 1976. She was the daughter of Stuart Edward Lear de Casembroot, boat builder. They had four children, George, Edward, Charlotte, and William. They divorced in 1997, and Hemmings moved to Calne in Wiltshire with Lucy Anne Williams, a design consultant, whom he married on 18 October 2002. She was the daughter of Geoffrey Bretton, chartered surveyor.<br>
<br>Although Hemmings continued to appear occasionally on British television in the 1980s, notably as a seedy intelligence agent in <span class="italic">Charlie Muffin</span> (1983), his principal activity was as a prolific director of American television series, including <span class="italic">Magnum P.I.</span>; <span class="italic">Murder, She Wrote</span>; and, for four years, <span class="italic">The A-Team</span>. His acting career and public profile revived when he played the manipulative Cassius in <span class="italic">Gladiator</span> (2000). Portly and pasty-faced but still vibrant, Hemmings sported a pink wig and eyebrows that matched the epic grandeur of the Colosseum. He was delighted with the frequent offers of film parts that followed, judging, &#145;I can be a different sort of actor. I can be fresh again&#151;which I love&#146;  (<span class="italic">Independent on Sunday</span>, 15 Dec 2002). The best of these later films was <span class="italic">Last Orders</span> (2001), in which four south Londoners embark on a day trip to Margate to scatter the ashes of a dead friend. Hemmings gave a brave, unsentimental performance as Lenny, the insecure, abrasive outsider.<br>
<br>In 1974 Hemmings had remarked, &#145;I'll be very surprised to reach 65&#146;  (biography, United Artists Company)&#151;a prediction that proved to be poignantly correct when his febrile lifestyle, coupled with heavy smoking and drinking, led to a fatal heart attack in his dressing room on 3 December 2003 while filming the horror picture <span class="italic">Samantha's Child</span> (released posthumously as <span class="italic">Blessed</span>, 2004) in Bucharest, Romania. A memorial service was held at St Mary's Church, Paddington Green, on 24 March 2004. He was survived by his wife, Lucy, and his six children.<br>
<br>Hemmings was precocious and multi-talented&#151;he was even a skilled magician&#151;but his career had been kaleidoscopic rather than substantial. But if his achievements did not quite match his potential, he remains one of the most celebrated embodiments of the 1960s, of a generation that believed that &#145;whatever you want you can have&#146;, as he put it himself  (<span class="italic">The Observer</span>, 3 June 1968).<br>
