<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pollock, Sir  Frederick</span>, third baronet  (1845&#150;1937), <span class="occ">jurist</span>, was born in London on 10 December 1845, the eldest of the three sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22480/', "Sir William Frederick Pollock, second baronet (1815&#150;1888)")</script>, queen's remembrancer, and his wife, Juliet, daughter of Henry Creed, rector of Corse, Gloucestershire. He was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22479/', "Sir (Jonathan) Frederick Pollock, first baronet")</script>, lord chief baron of the exchequer. Pollock received his initial education at Eton College, where he won distinction as a king's scholar. He then matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1863, where he was elected a scholar in 1865. He was placed second in the classical tripos of 1867 and sixth among the senior optimes of the mathematical tripos of that same year. He won the first chancellor's medal in 1867 and he was elected a fellow of Trinity in the following year. Pollock determined to make the law his profession and he was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1871.<br>
<br>For the rest of his life Pollock devoted himself to the study of the law as an essayist, professor, and editor. His primary goal was that law should be established as a science; in other words, that legal scholarship should aim in every field of the law to present the principles that must be extracted from the diverse mass of reported cases. To this endeavour he had been introduced by Nathaniel Lindley and Sir James Shaw Willes. Under their inspiration Pollock sought to lead the way in depicting the common law not as a series of disparate cases, but as a body of scientific principles open to rational inquiry. Viewing the common law in this fashion justified its practical role over the centuries and its status as an appropriate object of academic study. Pollock's insistence on both functions kept him among practising as well as academic lawyers, though he rarely appeared in court.<br>
<br>Pollock produced two treatises that were typical of this enterprise. In 1876 he published <span class="italic">Principles of Contract at Law and in Equity</span>. This remarkable book laid down in organized form the basic principles essential for those in practice, yet Pollock also presented his precepts in a manner that made the book valuable to beginning students, and he even managed to infuse some speculative issues that attracted attention from the nascent body of academic lawyers. In 1887 a companion work appeared, <span class="italic">The Law of Torts</span>, which was marked by the same wealth of legal learning and thought, combining the philosophy of law with its practical aspects. These two books became instant classics, went through numerous editions in Pollock's lifetime, and continued to exercise influence through posthumous editions in the hands of other scholars. As models for the legal literature Pollock sought to inaugurate, both works acquired substantial authority.<br>
<br>Pollock married Georgina Harriet Deffell in 1873, a union distinguished by a harmony that lasted for sixty-two years. The marriage produced one daughter and one son. Georgina Pollock shared the wide variety of her husband's interests, and provided a haven to which Pollock could escape from the heavy burden of work he had voluntarily assumed. Georgina Pollock died in 1935, predeceasing her husband by two years. A naturally shy individual, Pollock rarely alluded to his domestic life, though there are some references in his memoirs of a long life, <span class="italic">For my Grandson: Remembrances of an Ancient Victorian</span> (1933).<br>
<br>In 1883, one year after standing unsuccessfully for the Vinerian chair against Albert Venn Dicey, Pollock became Corpus professor of jurisprudence at Oxford (with a fellowship at Corpus Christi College); he held the chair until 1903. In the three decades between 1882 and 1912 Pollock produced a remarkable series of books on jurisprudence and politics that established him as a leading analyst and historian of the common law. Among the best-known of these are <span class="italic">Essays in Jurisprudence and Ethics</span> (1882), <span class="italic">English Opportunities and Duties in the Historical and Comparative Study of Law</span> (1883), <span class="italic">An Introduction to the History of the Science of Politics</span> (1890), <span class="italic">Oxford Lectures and other Discussions</span> (1890), <span class="italic">The Expansion of the Common Law</span> (1904) and <span class="italic">The Genius of the Common Law</span> (1912). These books were marked by an exploration of the intellectual foundations of law, not merely an explication of a single branch of the law. Pollock's capacity to succeed so effectively in both areas indicated the breadth and depth of his learning.<br>
<br>Pollock drew upon a wide variety of influences in the formulation of his own legal philosophy. He combined an understanding of the political and social realities that law reflected with a critical intelligence that gave to him an air of legal omniscience. He accepted little on faith except the strength of the common law itself. Pollock championed the comparative method of scholarly investigation with respect to law, in particular the utility for the common lawyer of familiarity with Roman law. The justification for this approach was twofold. In the first place Roman law provided a model for the consolidation of the common law into a rational system, so that its development might be understood as a whole. Secondly, proficiency in Roman law and its attendant scholarship promoted better understanding of common-law doctrines, rescued the common lawyer from insularity, and gave to the student of the common law a comparative perspective before such methodology became academically fashionable.<br>
<br>Pollock was the foremost admirer of Sir Henry Maine's historical jurisprudence, which provided for him an enduring antidote to the analytical jurisprudence of John Austin and a scientific basis for law different from the narrow confines afforded by the utilitarian tradition. Pollock thought that Maine's stimulus to the intelligent investigation of the common law, especially the refusal to depict the common law as simply a dogmatic, technical system, could not be overrated. Maine had forged intellectual links that bound together law, history, and anthropology, an achievement that made the rational basis of law more discernible. Pollock's concern for historical record made him sympathetic to Maine's emphasis upon evolution in the development of legal systems.<br>
<br>A substantial portion of Pollock's jurisprudence was drawn from his ambivalent reaction to the then prevailing Austinian jurisprudence. Pollock rejected Austin's premises for two principal reasons: the unhistorical nature of Austin's conclusions as revealed by Maine; and the failure to perform the promised separation of law and morality&#151;Austin having, in Pollock's view, substituted utilitarian ethics for conventional morality. In addition, Pollock detested the plodding literary style Austin had imposed upon legal philosophy, a fault that impeded realization of Pollock's desire for clarity in the law. Pollock did, however, accept the intellectual utility of analytical jurisprudence's stress upon the necessity to separate morality from legal analysis, even if he felt that Austin had not followed his own prescription. But for Pollock the separation was a methodological imperative only: as a tool for the scientific study of law, Austin had been correct to attempt to separate law from morality, but in the real world law and morality intersected through the medium of public opinion. Pollock was eclectic in his intellectual preferences, and pragmatic in the way in which he attempted to reconstruct the history of the common law.<br>
<br>Another classical work of scholarship with which Pollock was associated was that made in collaboration with Frederic Maitland, whom he had met through Leslie Stephen's <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96363', "Sunday Tramps")</script>: the two-volume <span class="italic">History of English Law before the Time of Edward I</span> (1895). Despite its fame as &#145;Pollock and Maitland&#146;, Pollock readily conceded that most of the credit for this great work belonged to his colleague. This famous partnership succeeded despite personal and professional disagreements. Indeed S. F. C. Milsom refers to &#145;the bizarre need to finish &#147;Pollock and Maitland&#148; before Pollock could write any more of it&#146;  (&#145;F. W. Maitland&#146;, <span class="italic">Proceedings of the British Academy</span>, 66, 1982, 277). Pollock desired to place law at the centre of the research, while Maitland wished to discuss the historical context without which the understanding of law would be impossible. Pollock contributed the section on Anglo-Saxon law, notable in its own right for its rejection of the view that legal institutions were transmitted genetically through the Germanic race. Pollock had little admiration for the work of William Stubbs, for example, precisely because it attributed English constitutional liberties to such a transmission. The affiliation with Maitland worked in spite of their different intellectual attitudes, and their complementary relationship in the end produced a masterpiece of scholarship on the history of medieval English law.<br>
<br>The founding editor of the <span class="italic">Law Quarterly Review</span> in 1885, Pollock served until 1919, when the journal had taken its place as the premier vehicle for legal scholarship in the world. Under his guidance the periodical not only published articles of note from leading scholars, it kept readers abreast of important treatises through its book review section. In addition to his editorial duties, Pollock contributed many original articles to its pages. He also wrote notes on current decisions and never hesitated to criticize or to praise when he thought it appropriate. The <span class="italic">Law Quarterly Review</span> set a standard of excellence in the common-law jurisdictions that became much admired and imitated.<br>
<br>Pollock also acted as chief editor of the <span class="italic">Law Reports</span> from 1895 to 1935, relinquishing his sole jurisdiction only at the age of ninety. This duty, supervising a most important portion of the English system, indicated his commitment to the practical workings of the law. Of the Oxford professoriate in the 1880s and 1890s that included such academic luminaries as Albert Venn Dicey, Thomas Erskine Holland, and James Bryce, it was Pollock who best kept in touch with the bar. Further practical involvement came with his public work: he drafted the 1890 <span class="roman">Partnership Act</span> and several Indian bills, and he served on several royal commissions, including those on labour (1891&#150;4) and public records (1910). Perhaps better than any other individual who moved between academic law and practice, Pollock never forgot that the law was untidy, constantly changing, and beyond the ability of a single individual to change dramatically. His humility in the face of the law's majesty sustained his role as the primary mediator between theory and practice of his generation.<br>
<br>Pollock is now remembered chiefly for his famous epistolary friendship with justice Oliver Wendell Holmes of the United States supreme court. For more than half a century these two individuals, both major figures in the legal development and jurisprudence of their respective countries, exchanged letters on every conceivable subject, not just on legal matters but across the impressive variety of interests each man possessed. The publication of these letters in 1942 gave an insight into Pollock's personality which was surprising to many people. At the same time, however, even after the length of their friendship, the letters revealed a restriction on intimacy that was part of each man's reserve.<br>
<br>Pollock presented to the world a fa&ccedil;ade of immense dignity, especially on public occasions, which was often mistaken for coldness or snobbery. In truth he was not much for small talk nor did he suffer fools gladly. While on cordial terms with individuals, he did not permit familiarity; the result has been a paucity of personal memoirs. His formidable appearance notwithstanding, Pollock was a devoted husband and father whose private conduct belied his public image.<br>
<br>The learning that Pollock possessed was truly prodigious. Whether it was about fencing, mountaineering, the Persian language, classical philosophy, or architecture, he acquired an expert's knowledge of these discrete fields. His son quoted an anonymous Oxford professor's conclusion that Pollock had been the most learned Englishman since Francis Bacon  (Pollock, <span class="italic">Time's Chariot</span>, 48). In letters to Gilbert Murray, for example, Pollock never hesitated to suggest alternative translations of Greek literature to his friend. Pollock remained both intellectually and physically active until the end of his long life.<br>
<br>In his time Pollock earned universal recognition for the remarkable position he had acquired by his mastery of both legal practice and legal theory. Since his death in London on 18 January 1937, however, he has received only passing evaluations from subsequent scholars. This is in part because he was too much an academic lawyer for the practitioners and too devoted to practice for the academic jurists; moreover, the diversity of his scholarly activity has prevented a greater appreciation of its specific parts. A fair assessment of Pollock's place in the history of English law and jurisprudence came from C. H. S. Fifoot: Pollock &#145;was for sixty years at the heart of the law&#146;  (Fifoot, <span class="italic">Judge and Jurist</span>, 136). His faith in the ultimate beneficence of the historic common law, and his courage to record its failures, made him a notable publicist for the English legal system and its accomplishments in other countries.<br>
