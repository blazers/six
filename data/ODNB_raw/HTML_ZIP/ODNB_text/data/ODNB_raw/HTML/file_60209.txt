<span class="headword">Friel,  George</span>  (1910&#150;1975), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 15 July 1910, in a room-and-kitchen tenement flat at 1172 Maryhill Road, Glasgow, the fourth of the seven children (two girls, five boys) of Jimmy Friell and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Toal (<i>b</i>. 1883). His father, born in Donegal in 1879, had left school at eleven, but had nevertheless found &#145;respectable&#146; work as a salesman for the Scottish and Legal Insurance Company; he believed, though, that his true vocation was the music-hall stage, where he occasionally performed. George Friel signalled revolt by dropping the second &#145;l&#146; which Jimmy had added to the family name, and later made feckless, selfish fathers a staple of his fiction. He seems to have been very close to his mother, who was an avid reader. In the Maryhill tenement hierarchy of subclasses, the Roman Catholic Friells, though cramped in their two rooms, were nowhere near the bottom. The liveliness of the area, with Maryhill army barracks and Partick Thistle football ground close at hand, would make a vivid mark on George's fiction.<br>
<br>George Friel's elder siblings, Cissie, Jack, and Tommy, had all impressed their teachers at St Charles's Primary, before leaving school at fourteen, and George received encouragement to proceed further. After going on to St Mungo's Academy, in 1926 he reached Glasgow University, where he fell under the spell of recent modernist writing. He became deeply interested in philosophy and in left-wing political ideas, making a lifelong friend of James Gillespie, a science student, son of a miner, who introduced him to Marxism. In autumn 1929 he published his first contribution to the <span class="italic">Glasgow University Magazine</span>, and he rose to edit the magazine in 1931; his brief tenure was curtailed by unpleasant controversy raised by his Catholic origins.<br>
<br>Like several other very gifted Scottish writers who attended university at this time of deep economic depression, Friel could not see beyond schoolteaching as a career: after he graduated with an ordinary MA degree in 1932 he went on to Jordanhill Teacher Training College. After a phase in 1934 when he had eleven brief supply-teaching appointments in eight different schools, he was a master at St Roch's junior school until 1940. On 9 July 1938 he married Isabella Keenan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McAulay (1912/13&#150;1985), a fellow teacher whom he had met four years previously. They had no children, and resided for the rest of their lives at 25 Brackenbrae Road in the outer suburb of Bishopbriggs. Their relationship struck outsiders as staunch and warm, though, in the Scottish manner, undemonstrative. She was a constant supporter of his writing.<br>
<br>In 1933 Friel had a poem published in the <span class="italic">Adelphi</span> magazine, but he abdicated his verse ambitions after several publishers rejected an offered collection. Before the Second World War disrupted literary life he had made a promising start as a writer of short stories, publishing eight, most of them involving a family called Plottel whose circumstances echoed the Friells'. From 1940 to 1946 he served in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, where he became a warrant officer; he was posted in England, then moved to Belgium and Germany. Isabella spent most of the war in Dumfriesshire, where her family farmed. In 1947 George resumed his teaching life at St Mark's junior school, and in 1960 transferred to become assistant head teacher at St Philomena's primary school.<br>
<br>Friel's literary career languished. A first novel, <span class="italic">So I was Told</span>, which threaded his Plottel stories together, did not impress publishers. Late in 1946 he began to send out <span class="italic">Sons and Daughters</span>, and after this had been rejected by eight different London publishers he revised it as <span class="italic">No other Herald</span>, which incurred an identical number of rejections. He was in his late forties before his luck changed. The distinguished fiction writer Fred Urquhart reprinted one of Friel's pre-war productions in <span class="italic">Scottish Short Stories</span> (1957). <span class="italic">No other Herald</span> impressed, though it did not convince, Hutchinson's readers, and Timothy O'Keeffe of that firm wrote encouragingly to Friel early in 1958. Within six months Friel responded with another book which Hutchinson brought out in a series quixotically devoted to first novels. <span class="italic">The Banks of Time</span> (1959) is a carefully crafted story which refractedly echoes Friel's disagreements with his brothers and exasperation with their father. The protagonist, David Heylyn, is the first of Friel's self-conscious, autodidactic, petty-bourgeois Glaswegian aesthetes, a charmless youth with prickly integrity. Friel suppressed his splendid ear for dialogue and rendered the speech of all his characters in standard English.<br>
<br>Publication of <span class="italic">Banks of Time</span> did not make Friel famous, but did spur him to quest for further publication. Hutchinson rejected his second rewrite of <span class="italic">No other Herald</span>, now <span class="italic">Three Days with Delaney</span> (Friel was to rewrite and retitle this novel twice more, with consistent lack of success). In 1960 he tried out <span class="italic">All for Moira's Wedding</span>, which he set aside permanently after three rejections. Meanwhile, he had acquired an agent, James McGibbon of Curtis Brown. Friel had a new novel, <span class="italic">The Boy who Wanted Peace</span>, which unusually he had written in a rush, without pernickety revision. The raciness of this grim yet hilarious fable about juvenile corruptibility eventually prevailed. After eight publishers had rejected it, John Calder, after many months of dithering, accepted it in July 1963. This might have seemed something of a mismatch, as in the 1950s Calder had become Samuel Beckett's English publisher, and his list promoted the European avant-garde in general and the French <i>nouveau roman</i> in particular. The tenement-close, slice-of-life realism of Friel's previously published work might indeed have seemed out of place. In his reply to Calder's reservations Friel dramatized his humdrum career, making exaggerated play with brief episodes when he had tended bars, helped his father sell insurance, and appeared on stage at university, so that teaching might seem merely a retreat to a steady job after picaresque roving:<blockquote>I am not a Scottish writer at all. I am a Glasgow-Irishman, which makes writing in English feel like trying to walk in your teacher's cast-off shoes &hellip; I am old enough to have bought for a florin Samuel Beckett's <span class="roman">Dolphin</span>-book essay on Proust when it was first published, and I knew he was an exceptionally intelligent writer long before <span class="roman">Waiting for Godot</span> became a text for parsonical parables. (G. Friel, letter, 1963, Friel MSS)</blockquote>In fact Calder's was a highly apt firm to produce, in succession, Friel's further four novels, in which the writer freely indulged at last his Joycean delight in wordplay and bizarre incidents. Language itself emerged as his major theme. Glasgow became an Eliotesque &#145;waste land&#146; haunted by symbolic resonances. Friel was not, as it turned out, an alien stablemate for Beckett.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Boy who Wanted Peace</span> appeared in October 1964, and was respectfully reviewed in major British journals&#151;the praise of Anthony Burgess in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> was particularly gratifying. Calder was not the most smoothly efficient of publishers, but the firm's zeal in promoting the book took Friel himself aback&#151;he first heard about serialization in the <span class="italic">Scottish Daily Express</span> from the newspaper itself. There was much activity concerning film rights over the next few years, and, though this came to nothing, BBC Scotland broadcast a radio adaptation in March 1967, then a version for television in February 1970. Although the Calder edition sold fewer than 2000 copies before Friel's death, and a Pan paperback edition launched in February 1972 was pulped after disappointing sales eighteen months later, Friel was now established in literary circles. Marion Boyars, Calder's partner, had handed the manuscript of <span class="italic">Grace and Miss Partridge</span> back to him early in 1965, and he had tried other publishers. Then in 1967 Boyars sheepishly asked to have it again&#151;she had found it unforgettable. This very offbeat theological fable is narrated by an authorial persona who claims to have known the characters (indeed, has married Grace herself) and developed the story out of documents and intuitions.<br>
<br>Calder and Boyars published <span class="italic">Mr Alfred MA</span> early in 1972. To Friel's annoyance he had to abandon his chosen title, <span class="italic">The Writing on the Wall</span>, because Mary McCarthy brought out a book of essays with that name. It was preserved as the title of part two of the novel, in which a gentle, alcoholic Glasgow English teacher eventually loses his wits, overpowered by the ferocious graffiti now scrawled all around the city by its teenage gangs, more meaningful, as he surmises, than his own always-rejected volume of poems.<br>
<br>Friel himself was by now sick of teaching. St Philomena's, as a primary school, gave him less time to himself during the day than he had had at St Mark's. The discrepancy between his lowly status as an educationist and the esteem which many now had for him as a writer was expressed in an unctuous letter from Glasgow corporation's director of education, giving him one day's leave of absence&#151;&#145;without salary&#146;&#151;to represent himself at a launching event for new Pan paperbacks, and concluding &#145;May I congratulate you on your success.&#146; Friel was developing a sideline in scripts for radio and television that might have become profitable. In 1973 he resigned from his teaching job on grounds of ill health. Sadly, these were not spurious. On 5 March 1975 he died of lung cancer, at home, just two months before Calder and Boyars published his last novel, <span class="italic">An Empty House</span>.<br>
<br>For all his natal Catholicism, Friel's personality, like his writings, had been deeply affected by the dour Scottish Calvinist tradition. He kept himself to himself, did not mix with other writers, and refused to yield any ground in argument. Immensely observant, fascinated by overheard snippets of conversation, he uttered extremely funny remarks without a smile. One radio producer who worked with him remembered a small man with rather cherubic features dominated by large spectacles&#151;&#145;giving nothing away, taut and tight, very quiet&#146;. He was a heavy smoker. He relaxed after his day's teaching, then wrote after midnight, whisky and cigarettes to hand.<br>
<br>Friel died just before a remarkable efflorescence of fiction in the west of Scotland was signalled by William McIlvanney's <span class="italic">Docherty</span> (1975) and Alasdair Gray's <span class="italic">Lanark</span> (1981). He could have seen in these two writers, and in James Kelman who followed them, many affinities with his own work. He had written fiction exclusively about Glasgow. The tenement world of his youth dominates his novels, with its warmth and its feuding, its gossip and its violence, its pub talk and prevalent petty criminality, remembered with mingled pain and nostalgia. Pain largely comes from the discrepancy between the visions which literature, music, and art reveal to some of his characters and the dwarfish opportunities of a provincial city. Friel's belated status as an important writer was marked by two Scottish Arts Council awards for his third and fourth published novels, and the inclusion of <span class="italic">Mr Alfred MA</span> among the earliest titles in the new <span class="roman">Canongate Classics</span> series launched with the support of the council in 1987. Douglas Gifford, introducing the book, acclaimed it as &#145;one of the greatest of Scottish novels&#146;.<br>
