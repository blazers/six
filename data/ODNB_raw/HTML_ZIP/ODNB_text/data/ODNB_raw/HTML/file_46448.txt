<span class="headword">Gooch,  Edwin George</span>  (1889&#150;1964), <span class="occ">politician and trade unionist</span>, was born in Fairland Street, Wymondham, Norfolk, on 15 January 1889, the youngest son in the family of at least five sons and three daughters of Simon Gooch (1843&#150;1912), a master blacksmith and &#145;an ardent Liberal&#146; in politics, and his wife, Ellen Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stackard (or Stackyard) (1846&#150;1917), who had been a dressmaker before her marriage in 1864. Edwin's father was able in 1881 to employ one man and have a &#145;living-in&#146; apprentice. In 1904 his business was described as &#145;Gooch and Son, Shoeing Smiths, Machinists &amp; Agricultural Engineers&#146;. The son was Albert, Edwin's elder brother.<br>
<br>Edwin Gooch was well educated for a tradesman's son. Having attended the board school at Browick Road, Wymondham, he went in 1900 to Duke Street Higher Grade School in Norwich. On leaving school, and after a brief period at his father's forge, he went to work for the <span class="italic">Norwich Mercury</span> as a printer. In 1911, still living with his parents in Wymondham, he was described as a &#145;printer and reporter&#146;  (census returns, 1911). He remained as a journalist at the <span class="italic">Norwich Mercury</span> until he was elected to parliament in 1945, by which time he had become chief sub-editor. He married on 26 December 1914, at the Primitive Methodist chapel, Wymondham, Ethel Banham (1888&#150;1953), a schoolteacher; she was the daughter of Charles Dawson Banham, a gasworks manager. They had one son.<br>
<br>In common with many Norfolk men and women of his generation, Primitive Methodism was central to Gooch's life and to his subsequent political career. His beliefs came, in part at least, from his parents, who were active Primitive Methodists. The &#145;Prims&#146;, although well established by Gooch's day, still had at their core a belief in the social gospel which, combined with a numerous lay ministry, encouraged self-education and above all a deeply held political radicalism. It was this which probably led Gooch into Labour Party politics. In August 1918 he was a key figure in founding the South Norfolk Labour Party in Church Street, Wymondham, and he was its first secretary.<br>
<br>Although there were some industrial workers, especially in Wymondham and to a lesser extent Diss, the vast majority of voters in south Norfolk in the period after the First World War were agricultural workers. It was to them that the new South Norfolk Labour Party had to appeal. This linked Gooch, an urban journalist, to the cause of the rural worker for the rest of his life. In 1918 the Labour candidate was George Edwards, the veteran farm workers' union leader, who despite local support, lost against a &#145;National Liberal&#146;. However, in a by-election in 1920 Edwards was elected by a narrow majority. He lost the seat in 1922 but regained it in 1923&#150;4.<br>
<br>These successes owed much to Gooch, who marshalled the farm workers' vote, a large but politically disorganized majority of the electorate. Gooch was also building for himself a considerable reputation both in Norfolk and in national politics. His election to Norfolk county council in 1922 followed on from election to the rural district council, the poor law guardians, and Wymondham parish council, as well as appointment to the magistrates' bench. In 1935, when Wymondham became an urban district council, he was elected its first chairman.<br>
<br>Gooch's association with the National Union of Agricultural Workers moved him firmly into the sphere of national politics. In common with many officials of the union, the fact that Gooch was not a farm worker was a real strength in that it gave him protection from victimization, an ever-present threat for rural trade unionists. In 1923 during the Norfolk strike he became treasurer of the strike fund, and in 1926 he was elected to the union's national executive. More significantly, in 1928 he was made temporary chairman and in 1930 was elected president of the union.<br>
<br>Gooch's presidency marked an important change in the direction of the union and its policy, which was aided by the resignation in 1928 of Robert Walker as secretary. Walker represented an older, more radical, and avowedly socialist position, which was increasingly undermined by declining union membership, widespread and growing unemployment, and what was seen by many on the executive as the failure of the &#145;militant&#146; policy of 1923 and afterwards. Against this Gooch proposed a policy of moderation, based on a belief that agriculture as a sector of the economy should be united, with farm workers, farmers, and landowners working together. In Gooch's view a successful and prosperous agriculture would automatically lead to prosperity for the farm worker. This meant an end to the &#145;class war in the countryside&#146; which many wrote about in the 1920s, and its replacement with a policy of co-operation within the industry, with wages and conditions mediated through the peaceful means of the government-run wages boards. It was a view which dominated the union's national policy until long after Gooch's death.<br>
<br>In 1931 and again in 1935 Gooch stood as Labour parliamentary candidate for South Norfolk, Edwards's old seat. He was defeated on both occasions. In 1944 he was selected to stand for North Norfolk. Like South Norfolk this had a long Lib&#150;Lab tradition, and at the 1945 general election Gooch won with a substantial majority. He held the seat until his death. In national politics he was a loyal member of the Parliamentary Labour Party, always a man of the centre rather than the left, but also seen as a reliable pair of hands. He was elected to the national executive of the party from 1945 to 1961 and party chairman from 1955 to 1956. He also served on the Agricultural Wages Board and a number of Ministry of Agriculture committees, as well as the International Labour Organization and the Food and Agriculture Conference of the United Nations. His wartime work led to the award of the CBE in 1944 for services to agriculture.<br>
<br>Edwin Gooch was in many ways a Labour politician of the old school, shaped by religious radicalism and the trade union movement, and firmly based in the politics of his locality. Yet in other respects he was a modernizer. He guided the National Union of Agricultural Workers through the difficult years of the 1930s with studied moderation, and he consolidated many of the gains made by the union in the years between 1939 and 1951. In the context of the Labour Party he was a Gaitskellite, seeking ways to accommodate with capitalism to earn working people, and especially the farm worker, &#145;a place in the sun&#146;, as he himself put it.<br>
<br>Despite his national importance Gooch continued to direct much of his energy to Norfolk affairs. He retained a strong Norfolk accent, and he never left Wymondham. He was made an alderman of the county in 1932 and it was as Alderman Gooch that he was remembered. Even in his seventies he remained a JP, a county alderman, vice-chairman of Norfolk county council, and chair of its education and agricultural education committees.<br>
<br>His first wife, Ethel Gooch, was herself a formidable and important figure in the history of Norfolk Labour politics. She was elected a councillor in Wymondham and was the first woman to chair the town's urban district council. Her nephew was Peter Reyner Banham, the architectural critic. Following her death Gooch married, on 7 April 1960, Mary Agatha (Mollie) Curl (1911&#150;1996), a bakery supervisor, of Norwich; she was the daughter of William Curl, hotel keeper. Edwin Gooch died of kidney failure on 2 August 1964 at his home, Rydal Mount, 76 Norwich Road, Wymondham, and was buried in Wymondham next to his first wife after a funeral in the Methodist church and a memorial service in Wymondham Abbey.<br>
