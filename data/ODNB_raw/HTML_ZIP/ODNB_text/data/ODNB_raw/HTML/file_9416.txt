<span class="headword">Fife, Sir  John</span>  (1795&#150;1871), <span class="occ">surgeon and politician</span>, was born at Newcastle upon Tyne, his father, William Fife, being a medical man of Scottish origin, practising at Newcastle. After qualifying as a member of the London College of Surgeons, he was for a short time an army assistant surgeon at Woolwich, but returned to Newcastle in 1815, and commenced practice with his father. As a practitioner, and especially as a surgeon, he took a leading position in his town and throughout the northern counties, being remarkable for his punctuality and for the long distances he would ride in all weathers. He specialized in diseases of the eye, founding in 1822, with T. M. Greenhow, a charity which became the Newcastle Eye Infirmary. In 1834 he took an active part in founding the Newcastle school of medicine, in which he long lectured on surgery, being also surgeon to the Newcastle Infirmary. He was a successful lithotomist and a very cool and confident operator. He became fellow of the College of Surgeons in 1844. In March 1818 he married Elizabeth, second daughter of Joseph Bainbridge, a prominent Newcastle solicitor who contained Fife's radical political enthusiasm. They had four sons and two daughters. His wife died in 1834.<br>
<br>Fife's distinction as a local politician was even greater than his mark as a surgeon. He was, as a young man, an advanced Liberal, being active in 1831 in forming the northern political union, which agitated in favour of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, Fife's stirring speeches and effective organization having a great effect on Northumbrian opinion. In 1835 he was elected one of the first members of the new corporation of Newcastle, and was immediately chosen alderman. In 1838&#150;9 he was mayor, and when the Chartist outbreak of July 1839 took place he broke it up with bayonets. For this he was knighted in 1840. In 1843 he was again mayor, and presided at a great meeting on 22 January 1843, addressed by Richard Cobden, in furtherance of the anti-corn law agitation. He continued a member of the corporation until 1863. His radicalism cooled and he &#145;gradually settled down into a mild and colourless Whig&#146;. He was an energetic proponent of the establishment of a diocese of Newcastle. He was one of the most influential promoters of the volunteer movement in Newcastle in 1859, and became lieutenant-colonel of the local regiment, resigning his post in 1868, and receiving a silver centrepiece, of value &pound;100, as a testimonial from the regiment. He was for some years president of the Newcastle Mechanics' Institution, and supported many educational and other measures for the benefit of the working classes. After a life of great activity, Fife suffered from stone in the bladder, which was removed by Sir William Fergusson in 1870, but he was compelled to retire from practice. On 15 January 1871 he was attacked by paralysis, and died the next day at his home, Reedsmouth House, North Tyne.<br>
