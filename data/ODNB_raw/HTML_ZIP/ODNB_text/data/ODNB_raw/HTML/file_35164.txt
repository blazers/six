<span class="headword">Murray, Sir  James Wolfe</span>  (1853&#150;1919), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 13 March 1853, the eldest son of James Wolfe Murray (1814&#150;1890) of Cringletie, near Peebles, Peeblesshire and his first wife, Elizabeth Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 4 Oct 1857), daughter of John Whyte-Melville. The addition of Wolfe to the family name derived from Murray's grandfather being a godson of General James Wolfe of Quebec fame. Murray was educated at Glenalmond College then Harrow School (1867&#150;9). After attending the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, he was commissioned lieutenant, Royal Artillery, on 12 September 1872. He was promoted captain on 1 November 1881 and, after passing Staff College, began a period of almost continued staff service for the remainder of his military career, much of it on intelligence duties. He was deputy assistant adjutant and quartermaster-general of the north British district from January to August 1884 before entering the War Office's intelligence branch in a similar capacity. He advanced to deputy assistant adjutant-general in the intelligence branch in June 1887, becoming head of section D with responsibility for Russia, central and south Asia, and the Far East. He was promoted major in January 1889 and, after a brief spell of regimental service from July 1890 to March 1892, returned to the War Office as a special service officer from April 1892 to January 1894. From the War Office he moved to Aldershot as deputy assistant adjutant-general for instruction, and remained in post until February 1897. However this was interrupted by special service on the lines of communication for the Asante expedition between November 1895 and February 1896, for which he was rewarded with a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy on 25 March 1896. He went to India as assistant adjutant-general in January 1898 and was serving as assistant quartermaster-general for intelligence at army headquarters when the South African War broke out in October 1899.<br>
<br>Murray was sent to South Africa to act on the lines of communication with the Natal field force under Sir Redvers Buller, being progressively colonel on the staff and then both brigadier-general and major-general commanding lines of communication between September 1899 and November 1900. These were local ranks and Murray, who had received his substantive colonelcy in March 1899, was created KCB for his services. He returned to India to command a brigade in May 1901, being promoted to major-general on 1 January 1903 and appointed quartermaster-general in India in May 1903. On 12 February 1904 he became master-general of the ordnance and fourth military member of the new army council, established as a result of the War Office reconstitution committee chaired by Reginald Brett, Lord Esher. However, in something of a precursor of his future ineffectualness at the highest level, Murray found it difficult to comprehend his precise responsibilities in the new system and he was also bitterly opposed to the army reform scheme advocated by the secretary of state for war, H. O. Arnold-Forster. In particular, Murray opposed the attempt to institute both long- and short-service recruiting simultaneously, but he also objected to the creation of a &#145;blue ribbon&#146; general staff, which would become the only route for promotion to high rank. Indeed, Murray offered and then withdrew his resignation on three occasions in his first six months of office. The temperamental Arnold-Forster concluded at an early stage, &#145;If ever there was a wholly useless member of a Board, it is this tiresome, but no doubt well-meaning Scotsman&#146;  (Arnold-Forster, diary, 12 July 1904, BL, Add. MS 50339). Arnold-Forster was hard put to understand how Murray had gained his apparently high reputation, commenting on another occasion, &#145;He really sometimes gives the impression of being only half-witted&#146;  (Arnold-Forster, diary, 10 Nov 1905, BL, Add. MS 50352). In the event Arnold-Forster's scheme was swept away by the Balfour government's resignation in December 1905, but it was already apparent that it could not prevail against the entrenched military opposition. Murray himself took up the divisional command at Secunderabad in March 1907 and was promoted lieutenant-general on 1 April 1909. After his tour in India in February 1911 he was general officer commanding (GOC) in Scotland then South Africa.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 most of the general staff departed for Flanders with the expeditionary force, while Field Marshal Lord Kitchener became secretary of state for war. On 25 October 1914 Sir Charles Douglas, who had acted as chief of the Imperial General Staff since March, died of overwork and Murray was hastily recalled from South Africa to replace him. It was said that Murray was a master of detail but lacked breadth of view, but in any case the War Office was utterly dominated by Kitchener, whose autocratic and secretive methods were ill-suited to the proper functioning of the staff system. Murray was certainly not the man to challenge Kitchener's authority and he was noted for his total silence in meetings of the war council, hence the nickname of Sheep bestowed on him by Churchill. This was especially true of the planning for the Gallipoli expedition in 1915, Murray's only response to a direct question on strategy addressed to him in February 1915 being that &#145;he had no suggestions to make&#146;  (minutes of war council, 16 Feb 1915 TNA: PRO, CAB 42/3). Examined before the Dardanelles commission in 1917, Murray remarked of his relationship with Kitchener that &#145;it did not appear to me that he, having so to speak, taken the whole thing in hand and working on it almost entirely himself, to be necessary or desirable that I should interfere&#146;  (Dardanelles commission: minutes of evidence, Q.2605, TNA: PRO, CAB 19/33). He also professed to leaving meetings with &#145;a very indistinct idea of any decision having been arrived at all&#146;  (ibid., Q.2648). Murray neither saw the plans for the expedition nor even suggested that he should. Following Bulgaria's entry to the war in September 1915 the cabinet finally acted to reconstitute the general staff, and on 25 September 1915 Murray was replaced by Sir Archibald Murray.<br>
<br>Following his departure from the War Office Murray was employed on a special mission to Russia before becoming GOC at eastern command in 1916. Appointed colonel-commandant of the Royal Artillery on 9 April 1917, he retired on 5 May 1918. Murray was twice married: first, on 14 May 1875, to Arabella (<i>d</i>. 1909), daughter of W. Bray, with whom he had two sons and three daughters; and, secondly, in 1913 to Fanny, daughter of James Scott Robson and widow of Sir Donald Horne Macfarlane (<i>d</i>. 1904). Murray died suddenly of heart failure at Cringletie, Peeblesshire, on 17 October 1919.<br>
