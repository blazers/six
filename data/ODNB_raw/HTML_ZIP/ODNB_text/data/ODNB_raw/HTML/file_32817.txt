<span class="headword">Dickinson,  Hercules Henry</span>  (1827&#150;1905), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland clergyman</span>, was the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7603/', "Charles Dickinson (1792&#150;1842)")</script>, afterwards bishop of Meath, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Abraham Russell, of Limerick. He was born at Dublin on 14 September 1827. Two brothers, Charles and John Abraham, were in holy orders, and the eldest of his four sisters, Elizabeth, married John West, afterwards dean of St Patrick's Cathedral. Dickinson was educated at Dr Flynn's school, Harcourt Street, Dublin, and, from October 1845, at Trinity College, Dublin, where he obtained a classical scholarship in 1848, graduated BA in 1850, and proceeded MA in 1856. He was ordained deacon by Archbishop Richard Whately, who was an old friend of his father's, became BD in 1852, and proceeded DD in 1866. In 1852 he became curate of St Ann's, Dublin, considered an important parish, and was appointed vicar there in 1855. He continued to minister St Ann's for forty-seven years. On 2 October 1867 he married Mary Mabel, the daughter of Dr Evory Kennedy of Belgard, co. Dublin. They had nine children.<br>
<br>In 1868 Dickinson was appointed dean of the Chapel Royal, Dublin, in 1869 treasurer of St Patrick's Cathedral, and in 1876 precentor. In 1894 the Irish bishops elected him to the chair of pastoral theology at Dublin University. For many years Dickinson was a prominent figure in Dublin clerical life: he was examining chaplain to successive archbishops, an active supporter of the Association for Promoting Christian Knowledge, chairman of the Dublin Clerical Association, a member of the Representative Church Body, and a frequent speaker at the annual meetings of the general synod, where his humour enlivened debates. He was an ardent advocate of temperance, and he served on the royal commission for licensing reform from 1896 to 1899. He was also an advocate of the higher education of women, and he helped Archbishop Richard Trench in the foundation in 1866 of Alexandra College, Dublin, of which he was warden for thirty-six years.<br>
<br>Like his ecclesiastical patron, Dickinson was opposed to Tractarianism and was a strong supporter of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel at a time when it was not popular in Ireland. He was the author of <span class="italic">Lectures on the Book of Common Prayer</span> (1859) and <span class="italic">Scripture and Science</span> (1879), as well as occasional sermons and papers. He resigned his offices because of poor health in 1902, and died at his home, Baldonnel, Clondalkin, co. Dublin, on 17 May 1905. He was buried in Mount Jerome cemetery. Three decorated panels to his memory were placed in the chancel of St Ann's Church, Dublin.<br>
