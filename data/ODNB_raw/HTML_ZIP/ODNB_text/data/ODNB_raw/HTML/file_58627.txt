<span class="headword">Day,  Susanne Rouviere</span>  (1875/6&#150;1964), <span class="occ">suffragist and writer</span>, was born in Cork city into a family of prosperous merchants; little is known of her early life. She described herself as being &#145;five-foot seven&#146;, and of &#145;ample proportions &hellip; a wild Irishwoman with all the native and national love of a row boiling in my veins&#146;  (Day, <span class="italic">Round about Bar-le-Duc</span>, 205, 218). She was a formative force in organizing a branch of the suffrage organization, the Irish Women's Franchise League (IWFL), in Cork city in 1910. Susanne Day herself did not approve of militant activity and believed originally that the IWFL could remain non-militant. She eventually left the IWFL and formed the Munster Women's Franchise League in 1911, which declared itself to be non-militant. She organized and spoke at meetings on suffrage throughout Munster. Day acknowledged that her suffrage work had raised her awareness of social problems. She stood for election as a poor-law guardian in 1911 and topped the poll in the north-east ward of Cork city. She later wrote a novel based on her experiences as a poor-law guardian, <span class="italic">The Amazing Philanthropists</span> (1916), a satire on the workhouse system. She described the workhouse as a &#145;colossal business run by amateurs&#146;  (Day, <span class="italic">Amazing Philanthropists</span>, 89). She believed that the workhouse system &#145;breeds and perpetuates the very evil it was designed to kill&#146;  (ibid., 93). Considered an excellent public speaker, Susanne Day was encouraged by her work as a poor-law guardian to stand as a candidate for the Cork municipal elections in January 1914, but she failed to be elected by six votes.<br>
<br>Susanne Day became involved in relief work during the First World War. She spent fifteen months in northern France with a Society of Friends relief scheme providing aid to refugees in the months surrounding the battle of Verdun. Her experiences are recounted in <span class="italic">Round about Bar-le-Duc</span> (1918). She also wrote a number of articles on topics such as white slavery, and women and war for the <span class="italic">Irish Citizen</span>, a suffrage newspaper. Her literary work included co-writing two plays, <span class="italic">Broken Faith</span>, and <span class="italic">Fox and Geese</span> with Geraldine Cummins, which were produced in the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, in 1914 and 1917. Her last book, <span class="italic">Where the Mistral Blows</span>, a travel book about Provence, France, appeared in 1933. Little is known of her life after 1918. She did not marry and is reputed to have worked for the London fire service during the Second World War. A resident of Kensington, London, Susanne Day died on 26 May 1964 in the Cromer and District Hospital, Norfolk.<br>
