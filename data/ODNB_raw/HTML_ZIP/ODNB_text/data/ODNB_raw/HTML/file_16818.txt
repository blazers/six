<span class="headword">Lloyd <span class="st"> [Floyd]</span>, Sir  Charles</span>  (<em>c.</em>1602&#150;1661), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was the son of Sergeant-major Brochwel Lloyd of Moel-y-garth, Montgomeryshire, and his wife, Honoria, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65801/', "Sir Stephen Procter")</script>. He served in the Dutch army in the 1630s, where he showed his skill as a map maker and military engineer, and was an ensign by 1632. His abilities as an engineer were such that in April 1639 he was appointed engineer-in-chief and quartermaster-general for life of all fortifications in the British Isles, at 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. per day. He was employed to repair the fortifications of Berwick upon Tweed in the winter of 1639&#150;40 and served as a captain in the earl of Northumberland's regiment in the second bishops' war.<br>
<br>In December 1641 parliament appointed Lloyd chief engineer and quartermaster-general with the army to serve in Ireland, at &pound;1 10<i>s</i>. per day. He went to Ireland, but when the civil war began returned to England and joined the royalist army. Oxford's fortifications were constructed under his direction in spring 1643 and he supervised the setting out of the camp at Culham in May. Lloyd took command of Sir Thomas Salusbury's regiment following his death in the summer of 1643. This was raised in Denbighshire and Flintshire and was then the largest of the king's foot regiments. It was part of the army during the campaign in 1643 which saw the capture of Bristol, the siege of Gloucester, and the first battle of Newbury. In October 1643 Lloyd was directed to supervise the fortification of Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire. He took part in the campaign in the west country in 1644 and on the army's return was appointed governor of Devizes in Wiltshire. He was knighted in Oxford on 8 December 1644.<br>
<br>Lloyd was an active garrison commander, leading a raid on parliamentarian forces at Aldbourne, Wiltshire, in August 1645 and attempting to make Devizes more secure by firing or wrecking country houses nearby, including Bromham House. He was, however, wary of the reactions of local people. On 15 September 1645 Oliver Cromwell arrived with a detachment of the New Model Army and quickly occupied the town, forcing Lloyd and the garrison, which was said to number 300 men, to retire to the castle gatehouse. This was bombarded by Cromwell's artillery and Lloyd surrendered on 23 September 1645, attracting criticism from Sir Edward Walker for not having made a longer defence. He was given the use of three carriages to take his belongings to Worcester.<br>
<br>In October 1654 Lloyd arrived at The Hague from England. He returned to England after the Restoration and petitioned for the resumption of the pay of 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. per day granted him by Charles I. He was appointed chief engineer in 1660, but did not receive his salary and was forced to borrow money. Lloyd made his will on 8 March 1661 and died, apparently unmarried, at some point between then and 14 March when he was buried at St Margaret's, Westminster. His sister Blanch was his executor and residuary legatee and both she and his mother petitioned after his death for his arrears of pay. He was succeeded as chief engineer by his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16834/', "Sir Godfrey Lloyd")</script>.<br>
