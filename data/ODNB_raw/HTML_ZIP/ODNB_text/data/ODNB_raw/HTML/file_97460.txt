<span class="headword">Finnis,  Valerie Margaret Steriker</span> <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Valerie Margaret Steriker  Montagu Douglas Scott, Lady Montagu Douglas Scott]</span>  (1924&#150;2006), <span class="occ">gardener and photographer</span>, was born on 31 October 1924 at Wyke Cottage, Crowborough, Sussex, the younger daughter of Steriker Finnis, a paymaster commander in the Royal Navy, and his wife, Constance Mary Katharine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barford. At the age of five she moved with her family to Earlswood, near Reigate, where she created her first garden, with encouragment from her mother. She attended the Kerry School in Reigate. From the age of thirteen she boarded at Hayes Court, Kent; when it was closed at the beginning of the Second World War she moved to Downe House School, near Newbury. In 1942 she enrolled as a student at Waterperry Horticultural School for Women, a rigorous but happy establishment founded by the redoubtable Beatrix Havergal, which trained young women, including Land Army girls. When the course ended she stayed on as a gardener and teacher, eventually becoming head of the alpine department. She became extremely knowledgeable on alpines and, in time, an internationally noted expert on Kabschia and Engleria saxifrages. She was a particularly good cultivator of plants, with a prodigious memory for names.<br>
<br>In 1955 Valerie Finnis took up plant photography, partly as a means of making a little money to augment her modest salary. Her first images appeared in a learned article on crocus, but she soon started to sell them to Gordon Fraser for greetings cards and calendars, and to EMI for record covers. Later her pictures illustrated gardening magazines and books, such as the <span class="italic">Collins Guide to Alpines and Rock Garden Plants</span> (1972). She maintained that she only ever took one exposure of a subject, as film was so expensive. Her plant portraits, especially her carefully assembled bouquets of seasonal garden flowers, were immensely appealing and became very popular. In 1961 she won a gold medal from the Royal Horticultural Society and exhibited her photographs at Kodak's headquarters. Her powers of observation, honed by the culture of small alpine plants, naturally disposed her to expertise in this field. She strongly influenced many of the garden photographers who appeared on the scene in the 1970s and 1980s to satisfy demand when gardening magazines began to be printed in full colour. She also gave illustrated lectures all over Britain and, after she was invited as a guest lecturer on a Swan Hellenic cruise in 1961, abroad as well. She appeared as a guest presenter on Percy Thrower's <span class="italic">Gardening Club</span> programme on television. She constructed miniature rock gardens at Chelsea flower show and was a long-standing judge for the Royal Horticultural Society from 1962. She received the Victoria medal of honour of the Royal Horticultural Society in 1975.<br>
<br>One day in 1968, while in the potting-shed in the alpine department at Waterperry, Finnis heard a visitor point out the unusual American woodland herbaceous plant <i>Gillenia trifoliata</i> to his companion. She called out, &#145;You're the first person who's ever known that plant&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 30 Oct 2006). The person was Sir David John Montagu Douglas Scott (1887&#150;1986), a widower and retired head of the consular service, as well as an avid gardener. They married on 31 July 1970 at the parish church in Weekley, Northamptonshire; she was forty-five, he eighty-three. He lived at the Dower House, a wing of Boughton House near Kettering, Northamptonshire, renting it from his cousin, the eighth duke of Buccleuch and tenth duke of Queensberry. He had told Finnis that he lived in a semi-detached house outside Kettering, which was true&#151;in a way. He had already made a fine two-acre tree and shrub garden on a north-facing slope with his first wife, Dorothy (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Drummond), who died in 1965. The year after Valerie Finnis (who continued to use her maiden name) moved to Boughton, Waterperry closed as a horticultural college for women, so she imported many thousands of alpine plants; 150 yards of raised beds were built for these against the north- and south-facing walls of the kitchen garden. For a number of years the Montagu Douglas Scotts opened the garden to visitors very successfully under the charitable National Gardens Scheme twice a year. As popular as the garden was the sale of unusual plants, mainly propagated by David, who worked all day in the garden until well into his nineties, usually accompanied by a pug dog.<br>
<br>David Montagu Douglas Scott had, over many years, assembled an important collection of Victorian and twentieth-century paintings and drawings. His most famous acquisition was <span class="italic">No Walk Today</span>, by Sophie Anderson. Valerie Finnis fully shared his love of art, having herself a very good eye; she later curated the pictures. She and her husband were excellent company and entertained a wide variety of friends at the Dower House, until David became ill about three years before he died. Everyone who came to visit&#151;from the Aga repair man to Princess Alice, duchess of Gloucester&#151;was photographed and asked to write something about him- or herself in a succession of Smythson leather-bound scrapbooks, which chronicled the Montagu Douglas Scotts' life together, and which she later willed to the British Library. Valerie Finnis was full of fun, gossip, and practical jokes, and could be mischievous. She had a wide circle of friends and got on especially well with children. Although she had an attractive and lively personality, which drew people to her, she could also sometimes be a trouble-maker, which made them wary; she was said to enjoy a good row.<br>
<br>In 1990 Valerie Finnis founded a charity, the Merlin Trust, to fund travel scholarships for young gardeners. It was named in memory of her husband David's only child, Merlin, who had been killed while serving as a second-lieutenant in the rifle brigade in the Middle East during the Second World War. In her seventies arthritis forced her to give up gardening, although she lived on at the Dower House. She remained a judge for the Royal Horticultural Society until 2002. On retirement from judging she selected pictures of plants and gardeners that she had known, from her collection of 50,000 transparencies; these were included with her reminiscences in a book published in 2007, <span class="italic">Garden People: Valerie Finnis and the Golden Age of Gardening</span>. She died in Kettering General Hospital on 17 October 2006, of an upper gastro-intestinal bleed. Her brain was willed to scientific research, and her remains cremated at Kettering crematorium on 1 November. She directed that all her assets, including the picture collection, be sold for charitable purposes. The Finnis Scott Foundation was set up in 2007, with the purpose of giving grants to horticultural and art-related projects, reflecting the abiding interests of Valerie Finnis and her husband.<br>
