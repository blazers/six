<span class="headword">Nicholson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Jackson]</span>,  Nancy</span>  (1788&#150;1854), <span class="occ">miser and eccentric</span>, was born on 3 May 1788 at Drax, Yorkshire, the only child of John Jackson (<i>d</i>. 1810), vicar of Drax, and his second wife (<i>d</i>. 1842). Her father was the master of Drax grammar school, and it was probably the prospect of succeeding to this position and other financial rewards which induced the Revd John Nicholson (<i>d</i>. 1850) to marry her in October 1811. Although Nicholson became not only master of the school but also vicar of Drax, the couple had a miserable marriage. While Nancy Nicholson's miserliness was of a legendary order, her husband was not faultless: periodically he got very drunk, and was known to beat her. As mistress of the school she exercised her economizing talents to the full, serving the boys tiny meals and making them perform many household chores, which apparently included pilfering fruit from neighbours' gardens. After the Nicholsons were relieved of the charge of the school, she turned to the keeping and marketing of livestock, especially pigs, at which she proved herself very successful. Her business sense was further evidenced by the care she took to ensure that her own name as well as her husband's appeared on the deeds for the considerable amount of land which they purchased. After they separated in 1845 Nicholson consoled himself with an accordion, while his wife passed through a period of unusual extravagance, subscribing to a weekly newspaper and having her portrait painted. This was perhaps unwise in a woman of some 17 stone, who always refused to purchase new clothes. After her husband's death on 8 February 1850, Nancy Nicholson energetically sought for a post as a housekeeper, finding her leisured existence as a woman of property a dull one. In 1850 she joined the Roman Catholic church, but left it when a priest asked for a small donation towards the building of a church at Howden. She died on 6 August 1854 at her house in Asselby, leaving several expectant relatives out of her will. A distant cousin received &pound;1500 but the bulk of her property was bequeathed to a half-nephew. Much of her apparent oddity could be more fairly viewed as the result of frustrated intelligence and energy, coupled with a total disregard for the conventions of her sex and class.<br>
