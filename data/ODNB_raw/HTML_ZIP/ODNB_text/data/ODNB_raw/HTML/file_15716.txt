</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Knight,  Charles</span>  (1791&#150;1873), <span class="occ">publisher and writer</span>, was born on 15 March 1791 in Windsor, the son of Charles Knight (<i>d</i>. 1824), bookseller and stationer, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1792), daughter of John Binfield, a farmer in Iver, Buckinghamshire.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandeducation"></a>Early life and education</h2>Knight's childhood and early adulthood were spent in Windsor, a conservative provincial town whose meagre amusements he experienced to the full: he read unrestrictedly in the bookshop; he rambled in the Great Park and he visited the castle's state apartments and paintings; he was moved by the beauty and the solemnity of the service in St George's Chapel (although, after his confirmation, he told his father that his religious scepticism was such that he would become either a Quaker or a Unitarian); he attended the tiny Theatre Royal, to which he had free admission from the age of eight.<br>
<br>Knight went to a day school in Windsor in the late 1790s, where his education was &#145;altogether rotework&#146;  (Knight, 1.23). In 1803, however, he was sent to Dr Nicholas's school in Ealing, a more stimulating environment where he learned to read for &#145;solid improvement&#146;  (ibid., 1.54). However, in 1805 he left the school to become his father's apprentice, and spent the next three years learning the print trade. Clearly disappointed at the abrupt termination of his formal education, he gave himself up to &#145;desultory reading to the neglect of all systematic acquirement&#146;  (ibid., 1.69); this thorough grounding in contemporary popular literature later stood him in good stead as a publisher. Deciding to make literature his profession, he embarked on a course of more serious reading, mainly history and law, and in 1810 founded an unsuccessful reading club for young men in Windsor. He also began to write poetry, essays, and plays and in 1813 published a play, <span class="italic">Arminius</span>.<br>
<br>Knight's interest in books extended beyond their educative uses: by the age of seventeen, he was a confirmed bibliophile, and a buyer and seller of second-hand books and a collector of rare books. A client gave him an imperfect first folio edition of Shakespeare, which he made complete by printing the missing pages from a facsimile edition. At the completion of his apprenticeship in 1812, however, his interests were directed away from the more staid side of his father's business to the expanding press industry. Staying for some weeks with the newspaper editor George Lane, he sampled the London journalistic world, sitting in the Commons gallery with reporters. On his return to Windsor, on 1 August 1812 he became the joint proprietor with his father and the sole editor (until 1827) of the <span class="italic">Windsor and Eton Express</span>, the borough's first newspaper. The cost of stamp tax and paper duty and the difficulties of the subscription system made the initial outlay great and the price of the paper was consequently high. However, it throve and in the first weeks of its establishment, the paper had the exciting news of the July battle of Salamanca to report.<h2>
<a name="EarlycareerinWindsor"></a>Early career in Windsor</h2>As a journalist, Knight was resolved to be &#145;the temperate advocate of everything that thinking men will support&#151;Toleration, Education of the Poor, Diffusion of Religious Knowledge, Public Economy&#146;  (Knight, 1.124). Accordingly he supported Catholic emancipation, advocated low taxation, and favoured only moderate protectionism and limited parliamentary reform. His social conscience had first been awakened in his adolescence, when the heavy taxation, high prices, miserable housing, and poor sanitary conditions endured by the poor of Windsor had made him &#145;a sort of Communist&#146;  (ibid., 1.75). During the next decade, his social concerns deepened: in the post-war period of economic distress and political protest, he became convinced that enclosure and mechanical innovations were depriving people of their livelihoods.<br>
<br>This Cobbett-like humour was tempered by some practical experience of local government. In 1818 Knight was appointed as an overseer of the poor. Appalled by the wasteful expenditure of the committee and the number of fraudulent claimants, he attempted to reform the administration of poor relief, calling for visitations of the out-poor in their homes to ensure a fairer and more economical system. Believing that the state should assist the less fortunate in so far as it was able, he also tried to promote vaccination and to provide employment on public works for able-bodied paupers. His social philosophy was also influenced by John Sumner Bird, then a fellow at Eton College and later archbishop of Canterbury: Bird's dovetailing of Christian theology with Malthusian social and economic views fitted with Knight's growing belief that the poor must be encouraged to better their own condition through prudential financial planning and, significantly, autodidacticism. Complex as he believed the causes of poverty to be, he recalled that he &#145;never had any doubt of the advantages of educating [the poor]&#146;  (Knight, 1.191).<br>
<br>In December 1819 Knight wrote an article in the <span class="italic">Express</span> denouncing cheap publications as irreligious and anti-government, and calling for the provision of more &#145;healthful&#146; literature. He now attempted to publish an example of the latter: with Edward Hawke Locker as joint editor, Knight decided to publish a monthly serial entitled the <span class="italic">Plain Englishman</span>, of which the first number appeared in January 1820. Lasting nearly three years (until December 1822), the journal advocated moderate social reforms, avoiding contentious political issues such as the Queen Caroline affair. It was the first of a series of short-lived journals in which Knight was involved. In October 1820 he published the first number of <span class="italic">The Etonian</span>, which perished after only ten months; it was succeeded in 1823 by <span class="italic">Knight's Quarterly Magazine</span>, which survived until late 1824. The contributors for both publications were largely Etonians, including W. M. Praed, John Moultrie, and T. B. Macaulay, but the <span class="italic">Quarterly</span> also brought Knight into contact with such London literati as Thomas De Quincey and Barry St Leger. With St Leger he published for two months in 1826 a &#145;smart weekly sheet&#146;  (Knight, 1.342), entitled the <span class="italic">Brazen Head</span>. His connections to the metropolitan literary and journalistic world were also strengthened by his position as editor and part-proprietor (from 1820) of the London weekly, <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, where he continued to promote tepidly progressive but largely non-partisan views. The paper necessitated constant visits to London, a relief to Knight who felt stifled in Windsor. On the advice of J. W. Croker, he decided to enter London publishing, and in 1822&#150;3 he sold <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> and took premises in Pall Mall East; he moved his family&#151;in late 1814 he had married Sarah (1791/2&#150;1879), daughter of William Vinicombe, an architect, and they had, eventually, two sons and five daughters&#151;into a cottage in Brompton.<h2>
<a name="PublisheroftheSocietyfortheDiffusionofUsefulKnowledge"></a>Publisher of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge</h2>Knight's career as a London publisher began rather shakily. One of his earliest and most promising publications, R. C. Dallas's <span class="italic">Correspondence of Lord Byron</span>, provoked a court case in 1824; the work appeared only in a paraphrased version under a different title. Then his grand scheme for publishing a &#145;national library&#146; of cheap and informative abridgements of important works was stifled by the financial panic of 1825&#150;6. In autumn 1826, a close friend, Matthew Davenport Hill, had introduced Knight to Lord Brougham, who was then establishing the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (SDUK) and had expressed interest in the publisher's scheme. Negotiations were opened with John Murray, who offered to merge Knight's business with his firm and to publish the &#145;national library&#146;. The collapse of this arrangement forced Knight to put his business in the hands of trustees in spring 1827.<br>
<br>Knight now supported himself by literary hack work, writing for J. S. Buckingham's <span class="italic">The Sphinx</span> and editing an annual, <span class="italic">Friendship's Offering</span> (1828). From July 1827 he also acted as reader and superintendent for the publications of the SDUK, a far more promising employment. Under the aegis of the society, with Baldwin and Cradock as publishers, he produced in 1828 <span class="italic">The British Almanac</span>; 10,000 copies sold in a week, according to its proud progenitor, and <span class="italic">A Companion to the Almanac</span> followed. Knight added to the society's <span class="roman">Library of Useful Knowledge</span> a <span class="roman">Library of Entertaining Knowledge</span> (1829&#150;37), publishing the first volume in the series from his own regained premises in Pall Mall East. Until the dissolution of the society, he remained its principal publisher (and its creditor), forming important connections with such men as Henry Hallam, James Stuart Mill, Isaac Goldsmid, and James Allen.<br>
<br>In 1828 Knight had undertaken a tour of the midlands industrial towns to organize local committees for the SDUK: it produced a revolution in his understanding of industrialization and capitalism which completed the transformation of his social and political philosophy from his teenage tory radicalism to the whiggish utilitarianism which characterized his mature outlook. In addition to meeting a range of literary and antiquarian figures, Knight visited factories and finally appreciated the role of machinery in the industrial revolution. He also became convinced of the necessity of low taxation and free trade to safeguard industry, and still more of the importance of harmonious relations between industrialists and workforce, whose interests he believed to be too interdependent to allow any separation. Knight was opposed to trade unions, as indeed to most organizations with entirely working-class leadership and membership, and viewed popular demonstrations with no sympathy (as his reaction to the Bristol riots of 1831 and, later, the Chartist meeting of 1848 displayed). These views, strongly reliant on the economics of Adam Smith, were expressed in <span class="italic">The Results of Machinery</span> and <span class="italic">The Rights of Industry</span> (both 1831).<h2>
<a name="ThePennyMagazineandotherpublications"></a>The Penny Magazine and other publications</h2>Knight's publications for the SDUK were astonishingly diverse. In addition to volumes in the <span class="roman">Library of Entertaining Knowledge</span>, he started the <span class="italic">Working Man's Companion</span> (1830&#150;32) and the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of Education</span> (1831&#150;5). The best-known and most significant of his publications, however, was the <span class="italic">Penny Magazine</span> (1832&#150;45), the first issue of which appeared on 31 March 1832, &#145;the most successful experiment in popular literature that England had seen&#146;  (Knight, 2.179). The joint idea of Matthew Davenport Hill and Knight, it was aimed primarily at a working-class readership and served up a wholesome diet of informative articles on art, literature, natural history, science, history, and biography (but not politics or religion), intended to encourage thrift, self-discipline, self-education, and other social and moral desiderata. Although undoubtedly read by the self-improving artisan, it probably enjoyed a much larger audience among the middle classes, particularly among adolescents with a thirst for knowledge or didactic parents. It was the first lavishly illustrated publication to be offered to the working classes at an affordable price, and according to Knight by the end of 1832 it was enjoying sales of nearly 200,000 in weekly numbers and monthly parts. Its sales easily outstripped rivals such as <span class="italic">Chambers's Edinburgh Journal</span> and the <span class="italic">Saturday Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>Its lack of controversial material and its pragmatic attempt to explain an increasingly complex society to itself were probably important factors in the <span class="italic">Penny Magazine</span>'s appeal to a mass audience. But its success owed even more to Knight's copious use of illustrations, his wholesale mechanization and improvement of his printing equipment, and his well-developed system of distribution. Knight had early decided that illustrations were the key to attractive popular publications, and he aimed to capitalize on the development of the new reproductive medium of wood-engraving, which by the 1830s was overtaking the more expensive method of steel-engraving and even recently discovered lithography. Based in London, Knight had access to a growing ghetto of skilled designers and engravers, including William Harvey, Thomas Williams, John Orrin Smith, Ebenezer Landells, the Whympers, the Dalziel brothers, and Edmund Evans. However, the availability of engravers was not in itself sufficient. Experiencing difficulties in the production of cheap images for <span class="italic">The Menageries</span>, Knight worked with the printer and inventor Edward Cowper to adapt his printing machinery to produce more illustrations by stereotype castings and steam printing. Casts of Knight's best cuts were later sent all over the world for insertion in popular publications. The mechanization of his plant was combined with the use of a nationwide network of wholesalers and retailers, which he had built up during his first four years with the SDUK.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Penny Magazine</span> was joined, in January 1833, by the <span class="italic">Penny Cyclopedia</span>, at a penny for a weekly sheet. This immense project tested Knight's commitment to the cause of popular education: costs soon forced the price up to 4<i>d</i>., and sales flagged. Over the eleven years of its publication, Knight suffered chronic financial loss, with the profits of his other more successful enterprises being entirely swallowed up. Nevertheless, he saw the project through, employing a distinguished band of contributors including Southwood Smith, Andrew Ure, and Charles Eastlake, and ensuring a fully contemporary ethos by covering new inventions such as photography and including the biographies of living statesmen. The <span class="italic">Cyclopedia</span> was a highly influential work in its day, and represented a remarkable achievement for the hard-pressed Knight.<br>
<br>Other publications by Knight&#151;some published under the auspices of the SDUK, some independently&#151;included the <span class="italic">Gallery of Portraits</span> (1832&#150;4); <span class="italic">The Pictorial Bible</span> (1836&#150;8), with commentaries by John Kitto; <span class="italic">The Thousand and One Nights</span> (1838&#150;41) in a new translation by Edward Lane; <span class="italic">The Pictorial History of England</span> (1837?&#150;1844), by G. L. Craik and Charles Macfarlane; <span class="italic">London</span> (1841&#150;4); <span class="italic">Old England</span> (1845&#150;6); and <span class="italic">The Land We Live in</span> (1847&#150;50). He also published from 1844 <span class="roman">Knight's Weekly Volumes</span>, which began with Knight's own biography of William Caxton.<h2>
<a name="Sociallifeandcharacter"></a>Social life and character</h2>During the 1830s and 1840s Knight became a well-known and respected figure in London literary, publishing, and political circles. He moved his business into the heart of the City, 22 Ludgate Street, in 1833; from 1833 he lived at Hampstead, moving in 1835 to Highgate. In 1837 he played a part in the establishment of the penny post. He became an early member of the Reform Club in 1834 (although his admission to the Garrick Club was delayed by rumours about his 1827 near bankruptcy). In the same year, he was appointed publisher to the poor-law commission (he was a hearty supporter of the new poor law, and became a close friend of Edwin Chadwick). In 1850 he was publisher to the General Board of Health and he himself wrote a pamphlet of advice during the cholera epidemic of 1853. Impressed by the Great Exhibition of 1851, Knight agreed to act as a juror at the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1855, writing the part of the report dealing with drawing, modelling, printing, and other related media.<br>
<br>Despite his almost heroic industriousness, Knight was a sociable soul: although he had a quick temper, his contemporaries remembered him as a generous employer and a popular companion. According to one of his contributors, Charles Macfarlane, he put up Thomas De Quincey in his own house for three months while waiting for him to produce a sketch of Milton for the <span class="italic">Gallery of Portraits</span>; he also let Leigh Hunt stay rent-free in his Brompton cottage for two years. One overworked contributor, Harriet Martineau, was invited to join his family for a month's holiday in St Leonards. His altruistic character may well explain Knight's lack of financial success as a publisher, as he was no mean statistician and clearly knew how to balance his books. He was, however, incurably kind, essentially idealistic, and&#151;according to Macfarlane&#151;&#145;about the worst man of business that has ever belonged to the &#147;Trade&#148;&#146;  (Macfarlane, 96).<br>
<br>In 1845 Knight met Douglas Jerrold, the playwright and <span class="italic">Punch</span> contributor, with whom he visited Dublin and Killarney in 1849, to view the effects of the Irish potato famine; he also came to know such younger literary lights as W. M. Thackeray and Charles Dickens. He contributed to the first two volumes of Dickens's <span class="italic">Household Words</span> and joined the novelist's Amateur Company of the Guild, which toured the provinces in 1850&#150;51; the two men differed amicably on the issue of the working-class thirst for fiction, which Knight inevitably viewed as unimproving. In a letter to Knight of 17 March 1854 Dickens argued that:<blockquote>The English are, so far as I know, the hardest worked people on whom the sun shines. Be content if in their wretched intervals of leisure they read for amusement and do no worse. They are born to the oar and live and die at it. (<span class="italic">The Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 12 vols., 1965&#150;2002, 7.294)</blockquote>His position was vindicated by the collapse of the readership for the <span class="italic">Penny Magazine</span>, which was no doubt caused by the exclusion of fiction from its pages.<h2>
<a name="KnightasauthorShakespearescholarandhistorian"></a>Knight as author: Shakespeare scholar and historian</h2>Throughout his career, Knight had always been an author as well as editor and publisher. However, his first major project as an author took shape in 1837, when he resolved to produce a pictorial edition of Shakespeare's works. He started searching for &#145;authentic&#146; visual materials and began a critical reading of the texts. His edition was based substantially&#151;indeed, too substantially&#151;on the first folio edition, although he made comparisons with other quartos and, in some cases, with originals in the British Museum. His background reading led to a deep interest in Shakespeare's life and the edition, published between 1838 and 1841 (he published six later editions of the works of Shakespeare), was prefaced with a one-volume biography. Knight succeeded in contextualizing Shakespeare's life as no biographer except Nathan Drake had done, and in dismissing a couple of the more absurd legends surrounding the playwright's early life. But he was prone to speculation&#151;even suggesting that Shakespeare had visited Italy and Scotland&#151;and all too dependent on J. P. Collier's forgeries, the traces of which were visible even in the last revised edition.<br>
<br>Knight's retreat from publishing grew more pronounced in the late 1840s. In 1844 the last volume of the <span class="italic">Penny Cyclopedia</span> appeared and in 1846 the SDUK itself was dissolved; from 1855 he withdrew from his publishing business, his own works appearing with Bradbury and Evans, and Murray (the firm of Charles Knight &amp; Co.&#151;based from 1848 at 90 Fleet Street&#151;continued to publish long after his death). Knight's fascination with Shakespeare was but one aspect of his wider enthusiasm for English history and culture; it was this field of scholarship which he now explored more fully. In the 1840s&#151;in addition to writing the first sixteen chapters of <span class="italic">A History of the Thirty Years' Peace</span> (1849&#150;50)&#151;he had contributed as author as well as editor to such works as <span class="italic">Old England</span> and <span class="italic">The Land we Live in</span>, early illustrated examples of the tourist and heritage literature which is now a staple of British publishing, These heavily illustrated but essentially lightweight works were succeeded by a more serious historical enterprise, Knight's <span class="italic">Popular History of England</span> (1855&#150;62)&#151;&#145;perhaps the most arduous work of his life, and in some respects the most successful&#146;  (Clowes, 84). Knight aimed to write a social and cultural history of the English people but, in an era which was only just beginning to see the professionalization of history as a discipline, he lacked the appropriate critical training and apparatus to achieve this ambition. The <span class="italic">History</span> was instead an essentially constitutional history, a whiggish narrative of national progress, based on protestantism, economic prosperity, and harmonious co-operation between different social classes. Separate chapters covered the social, economic, and cultural history of the country&#151;a compartmentalization which Knight had objected to in <span class="italic">The Pictorial History</span> and had hoped to avoid&#151;but the <span class="italic">History</span> was a largely conventional interpretation of English history within the context of later Victorian historiography, a partial forerunner of J. R. Green's infinitely more popular <span class="italic">History of the English People</span>. Knight's illustrations, judiciously selected and recycled from his historical publications of the 1840s, enjoy a higher profile, still appearing occasionally in history textbooks and popular historical works.<br>
<br>A veteran campaigner against paper tax and excessive stamp duties (fearful of cheap radical political journals, he held that some duty should be charged), Knight was the author from the 1830s onwards of a variety of pamphlets, including <span class="italic">The Struggles of a Book Against Excessive Taxation</span> (1850). He also took an interest in the history of publishing, producing <span class="italic">The Old Printer and the Modern Press</span> (1854) and <span class="italic">Shadows of Old Booksellers</span> (1865).<h2>
<a name="Lateryearsandassessment"></a>Later years and assessment</h2>The elderly Knight looked like a benign patriarch, with an &#145;ample brow, long white locks, and slightly bowed figure&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 343). In 1864&#150;5 he published his rather long-winded autobiography, <span class="italic">Passages of a Working Life</span>. With <span class="italic">The Old Printer and the Modern Press</span>, it provides a unique insight into the world of nineteenth-century popular publishing; unlike many other publishers, Knight analysed supply and demand in detail, giving print runs and sales figures for some of his publications. Four other works followed the autobiography in 1867&#150;8, but by this time Knight was losing his eyesight. He spent his later years at various addresses in London, Surrey, and Ventnor on the Isle of Wight, before moving to Addlestone in Surrey, where he died at his home at Grove End on 9 March 1873. He was buried in the old burial-ground, Bachelor's Acre, Windsor, on 14 March.<br>
<br>Knight was, in the words of his <span class="italic">Athenaeum</span> obituarist, &#145;a highly useful man&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 343). With the Chambers brothers and John Cassell, he stands as a key figure in the development of the popular press and literature. Neither a great writer, nor a commercially successful publisher, nor an outstanding journalist, he is nevertheless significant in all these areas. He at once recorded and participated in the most remarkable events of the nineteenth-century newspaper and publishing worlds: the development of the provincial press, the mechanization of the printing press, the introduction of cheap illustrations, the expansion of popular publications to include educational works, and the abolition of &#145;taxes on knowledge&#146;. Publisher to the &#145;Schoolmaster Abroad&#146;, this popular educator&#151;as he saw himself&#151;influenced the minds of thousands of Victorian men, women, and children (some working-class but still more middle-class). Yet he still awaits a full-scale modern biography.<br>
