<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dawson,  Charles</span>  (1864&#150;1916), <span class="occ">palaeontologist and antiquary</span>, was born on 11 July 1864 at Fulkeith Hall, Lancashire, the second of the four children (he had two brothers and a sister) of Hugh Dawson, barrister, and his wife, Mary Anne Chaffer. By 1873 his father had moved to St Leonards, Sussex. He completed his formal education at the Royal Academy, Gosport, in 1880, and then followed his father into the legal profession, though his real interest always lay in archaeology, historical and industrial. From 1890 until his death he practised as a solicitor in Uckfield, Sussex, where he held several public appointments, and established his own law firm, entering into partnership with Ernest Hart in 1905.<br>
<br>Tall, moustachioed, and prematurely bald, Dawson appeared older than his years and as a long-serving clerk to the magistrates he was an important figure in the life of the town. In 1903 he bought Castle Lodge from the marquess of Abergavenny, a prestigious house under the shadow of Lewes Castle. Until the final stages of the sale the marquess was under the misapprehension that Dawson was purchasing the lodge on behalf of the Sussex Archaeological Society, which had for twenty years rented it to store its collections and records. The purchase soured Dawson's relations with the society, which he had joined in 1892, and they were never properly repaired. On 21 January 1905 he married, at Christ Church, Mayfair, London, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne L&eacute;onie Elizabeth Postlethwaite (1859&#150;1917), daughter of Barnaby Gaffney of Curzon Street, London, and a widow with two grown children. There were no children from this marriage.<br>
<br>In his time Dawson was viewed as an exemplar of &#145;that great class of men&#146; who provided &#145;the driving power to British science&#151;the thinking, observant amateur&#146;. His primary avocation was palaeontology, an interest he had lovingly nurtured since childhood. Indeed, it was a precocious interest in Wealden fossils that led to the assembly of a large and valuable collection that was donated in 1884 to the newly opened Natural History Museum in South Kensington, and which gained him not only the title of honorary collector for the museum but also brought him the coveted fellowship of the London Geological Society at the age of twenty-one. During his lifetime he was responsible for finding several new species of iguanodon, as well as a new species of the Mesozoic mammal <i>Plagiaulax</i>.<br>
<br>Dawson also won a reputation in Sussex geology and archaeology, the latter indicated by his election as a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1895. He was a recognized authority on the Sussex iron industry, and his two-volume <span class="italic">History of Hastings Castle</span> (1909) became a standard work. He wrote many articles about his discoveries which appeared in learned journals such as <span class="italic">The Antiquary</span>, <span class="italic">Sussex Archaeological Collections</span>, and the <span class="italic">Geological Magazine</span>. He was also a highly competent photographer, adept in the preparation and development of glass plates. Although all this assured him a footnote in the history of British science, it was his intimate association with one of the most celebrated scientific forgeries that rescued him from relative obscurity.<br>
<br>Between 1908 and 1912 Dawson recovered the remains of a human skull from a reputedly ancient gravel bed located at Barkham Manor (where he was steward), near Piltdown in Sussex [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59597/', "Piltdown Man")</script>]. On 18 December 1912 a reconstruction of these remains was presented to the Geological Society of London by Arthur Smith Woodward, keeper of geology at the Natural History Museum, who was convinced they represented an early human form which he had dubbed <i>Eoanthropus</i> (&#145;dawn man&#146;) <i>dawsoni</i>. In the discussion that followed Professor Arthur Keith hailed the discovery as &#145;by far the most important ever made in England, and of equal, if not of greater consequence than any other discovery yet made, either at home or abroad&#146;  (<span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London</span>, March 1913, 148). During the next forty years, however, it became increasingly difficult to reconcile this hominid with the burgeoning human fossil record from Asia and Africa. In 1953 a detailed examination of the Piltdown remains demonstrated conclusively that they were faked and had been planted as part of an elaborate hoax, evidently aimed at manipulating scientific views on human evolution. Though Dawson may not have masterminded this sophisticated and influential forgery, his complicity in the affair was strongly suspected. But the glory he gained for his &#145;discoveries&#146; at Piltdown was short-lived. Late in 1915, in a letter to Woodward, Dawson reported that he was ailing from an &#145;anaemic condition&#146;. He was given serum injections to counteract this, but developed septicaemia and died on 10 August 1916 at his home, Castle Lodge, Lewes.<br>
