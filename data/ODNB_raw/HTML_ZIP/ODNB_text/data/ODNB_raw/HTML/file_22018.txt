<span class="headword">Peter,  David</span>  (1765&#150;1837), <span class="occ">Independent minister and ecclesiastical historian</span>, was born at Aberystwyth, Cardiganshire, on 5 August 1765, the son of David and Margaret Peter. When he was seven years old his father, who was a ship's carpenter, moved to New Quay, Cardiganshire. He received his early education at the school of Evan Davies, Troed-y-rhiw, and later with the Revd David Davies of Castellhywel. His father, who was a churchman, wished him to become a clergyman. However, under the influence of the Revd Benjamin Evans of Tre-wen, Peter joined the Independents, and in March 1783 became a member of the church at Penrhiw-galed. In August 1783 he entered the Presbyterian Carmarthen Academy at Rhyd-y-groes and by the following year was keeping a school at St Ishmaels, Carmarthenshire. During this time he began to preach at Penrhiw-galed and in August 1786 he enrolled as a student at the Swansea Academy. In October 1789 he was appointed assistant tutor to the Revd William Howell at this institution, a position he resigned in 1792, in order to take the pastorate of Lammas Street Church, Carmarthen, where he was ordained on 8 June. The academy at Swansea was dissolved in 1794, but in the following year it was re-established at Carmarthen, and Peter was appointed president. He held this office, in conjunction with his pastorate, until his death. Peter married twice: his first wife was Sarah Lewis (<i>b</i>. 1755), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Llywelyn, a widow from Carmarthen, whom he married in October 1795; after her death in 1820 he married Charlotte Nott (<i>c</i>.1783&#150;1834) on 18 July 1822.<br>
<br>Peter was highly regarded as an evangelical preacher who found great success in his ministry at Carmarthen. He was responsible for translating Samuel Palmer's <span class="italic">Protestant Dissenters' Catechism</span> (1803), but he is best known as the author of <span class="italic">Hanes crefydd yng Nghymru</span> (1816), an account of Welsh religion from the times of the druids to the beginning of the nineteenth century. The book, which shows fairly wide reading and is free from sectarian bias, remained for many years the main history of religion in Wales. Peter died on 4 May 1837 at Carmarthen and was buried at the Lammas Street Church.<br>
