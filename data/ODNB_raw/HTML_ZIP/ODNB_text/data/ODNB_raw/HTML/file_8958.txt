<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Evans, Sir  Frederick John Owen</span>  (1815&#150;1885), <span class="occ">naval officer and hydrographer</span>, son of John Evans, master RN, was born on 9 March 1815. He entered the navy as a second-class volunteer in 1828. After serving in the <i>Rose</i> and the <i>Winchester</i> he was transferred in 1833 to the <i>Thunder</i>, Captain Richard Owen, and spent three years in surveying the coasts of Central America, the Demerara River, and the Bahama banks. Evans subsequently served in the Mediterranean on the <i>Caledonia</i> (flagship), <i>Asia</i>, <i>Rapid</i>, <i>Rolla</i>, <i>Dido</i>, and <i>Wolverene</i>, passing through the different ranks of the &#145;master's&#146; line, the officers then charged with the duties of navigation. In 1841 Evans was appointed master of the <i>Fly</i>, and for the next five years surveyed the Coral Sea, the great barrier reef of Australia, and Torres Strait. Beete Jukes, the geologist, was on the <i>Fly</i>, and wrote an account of the expedition. Shortly after his return to Britain Evans married, on 12 November 1846, Elizabeth Mary, eldest daughter of Captain Charles Hall RN, of Stoke, Plymouth.<br>
<br>After a short spell of duty in the Isle of Man, Evans returned in 1847, in the <i>Acheron</i>, to New Zealand, where he spent four years in surveying. During the Russian war he served on the <i>Lighting</i>, Captain Bartholomew Sulivan, in the Baltic, where he received the special thanks of Sir Charles Napier for his share in piloting the fleet through the Aland isles.<br>
<br>By this time Evans had become known by his scientific qualifications, and in 1855 he was appointed superintendent of the compass department of the navy. He had at once to consider a difficult problem, the use of the compass in iron ships and armourclads. In co-operation with Archibald Smith, he accomplished the task satisfactorily, and he contributed seven papers, on the magnetism of ships, to the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> of the Royal Society, of which he was elected fellow in June 1862. This work was critical to the safe navigation of iron warships.<br>
<br>In 1858 Evans prepared a <span class="italic">Chart of Curves of Equal Magnetic Declination</span>, published by the Admiralty. In 1860 he wrote a valuable <span class="italic">Report on Compass Deviations in the Royal Navy</span>, on the magnetic character of the various iron ships in the navy, and also of the <i>Great Eastern</i>. His most important work was the <span class="italic">Admiralty Manual for Deviations of the Compass</span> (1862), of which Smith and himself were joint editors. A simple account of the same subject was issued by Evans in 1870 as an <span class="italic">Elementary Manual for Deviations of the Compass</span>. These became standard textbooks, and were translated and adopted by the major maritime nations.<br>
<br>Evans later devoted much attention to terrestrial magnetism. He compiled the magnetical instructions for the observers on the <i>Challenger</i> in 1872, and delivered a lecture on the &#145;Magnetism of the earth&#146; to the Royal Geographical Society in 1878. He was made a staff commander in 1863, staff captain in 1867, and full captain in 1872. In 1865 he was appointed chief naval assistant to the hydrographer to the Admiralty, Captain G. H. Richards, whom he succeeded in 1874. He was made CB in May 1873, and KCB in May 1881. He was vice-president of the Royal Geographical Society from 1879 to 1881, and president of the geographical section of the British Association in 1876. In 1881 he contributed a paper to the latter on &#145;Oceanic or maritime discovery from 1831 to 1881&#146;.<br>
<br>After resigning the post of hydrographer in August 1884, Evans was appointed one of the British delegates to the international conference held at Washington in 1885, to fix a prime meridian and universal day. He died at his residence, 21 Dawson Place, Pembridge Square, Bayswater, London, on 20 December 1885. He was the only officer to join the hydrographic service as a master who rose to be hydrographer of the navy.<br>
