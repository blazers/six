<span class="headword">Boyle,  Henry</span>, Baron Carleton  (1669&#150;1725), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 12 July 1669, the third and youngest son of Charles Boyle, Baron Clifford of Lanesborough (1639&#150;1694), and his first wife, Lady Jane Seymour (<i>d</i>. 1679), the youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25182/', "William Seymour, second duke of Somerset")</script>. He was a scion of a prominent Anglo-Irish aristocratic family; his grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3135/', "Richard Boyle, second earl of Cork")</script>. After Westminster School he was commissioned into the army, almost certainly through the offices of his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14332/', "Laurence Hyde, earl of Rochester")</script>. He did not share the legitimist views of his Hyde relations, however, adopting instead the moderate whiggery of his father. In November 1688 he had joined the desertion of James II for the prince of Orange. He entered parliament for Tamworth, his father's old constituency, in May 1689, but after losing the seat at the general election in 1690 went to Ireland to run his grandfather's huge estates in counties Cork and Waterford. He served briefly in the Irish parliament, where he was noted for his great skill and &#145;quickness&#146;. In 1692, having resigned his army commission, he was elected MP for Cambridge University, of which his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25158/', "Charles Seymour, sixth duke of Somerset")</script>, was chancellor. Identifying himself with the &#145;country&#146; opposition, he shone as a speaker and scrutineer of government activity, and obtained election to the commission of accounts during the years 1695&#150;7. Tiring of opposition, however, he crossed to the court party during the winter of 1697&#150;8, and his effective advocacy of the court's financial measures brought him appointment as a lord of the treasury in May 1699 and advancement to chancellor of the exchequer in 1701, which latter office he retained until 1708. From 1704 until 1715 he was also both lord treasurer of Ireland and lord lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire. Urbane and superior, he avoided political infighting wherever possible, preferring the steady routines of treasury business, from which he profited handsomely.<br>
<br>Following the 1705 election, when he became MP for Westminster, Boyle emerged as one of Godolphin's chief lieutenants in the lower house, and in February 1708 he replaced Robert Harley as secretary of state in the southern department. His leadership over the court whigs, the high point of his career, ceased, however, towards the end of 1709 as the ministry succumbed increasingly to the dominance of the junto whigs. Early in 1710 he was a manager in the Sacheverell trial, but, unable to face the battles engendered by ascendant toryism, he declined re-election later in the year and withdrew from politics altogether. Following Queen Anne's death in 1714 he was, inevitably, tipped for the highest offices under the incoming whig ministry, but received only a barony. He supported Lord Sunderland's government during the &#145;whig schism&#146; and in 1721 was appointed to the cabinet rank of lord president; he was retained as such by Walpole. Boyle died, unmarried, at his London residence, Carleton House, on 14 March 1725, leaving estates in Oxfordshire, Wiltshire, and Petersham in Surrey, plus a personalty in excess of &pound;27,000. According to Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Carleton was the real father of Kitty Hyde [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7876/', "Douglas, Catherine, duchess of Queensberry and Dover")</script>], daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14331/', "Jane Hyde, countess of Clarendon and Rochester")</script>, and her husband, Henry, Lord Hyde. The veracity of the story remains unclear, but certainly both Kitty and Jane benefited in money and jewellery from Carleton's will. He was buried in the family vault at Londesborough, Yorkshire, on 31 March 1725.<br>
