<span class="headword">Eaton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Waldie]</span>,  Charlotte Anne</span>  (1788&#150;1859), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 28 September 1788, the second of the three daughters of George Waldie of Hendersyde Park, Roxburghshire, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ormston, eldest daughter of Jonathan Ormston of Newcastle upon Tyne. Charlotte also had two brothers, and her elder sister Maria Jane married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11610/', "Richard John Griffith (1784&#150;1878)")</script>, the distinguished geologist and valuator. Little is known about Charlotte's education but at a young age she began to write a novel in the Gothic style, &#145;At Home and Abroad&#146;, which she abandoned in 1814 because of similarities to Maria Edgeworth's <span class="italic">Patronage</span>. She published a letter in the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span> (2, 1814) addressing the points of resemblance.<br>
<br>In June 1815 Charlotte visited Brussels, the hastily established headquarters of Wellington's army, via Bruges and Ghent with her brother John and sister <a href="#cosubject_28448">Jane [<i>see below</i>]</a>. They were evacuated to Antwerp because of the rapid French advance, and visited the battlefield at Waterloo before returning to England after six weeks away. Charlotte wrote an account of the battle published first as &#145;Circumstantial detail&#146; by &#145;a Near Observer&#146; in <span class="italic">The Battle of Waterloo</span> (1815) which was accompanied by panoramic sketches by Jane Waldie. In 1816 Charlotte and Jane met John in France and continued with him to Italy. In 1817, while she was still in Italy, Charlotte's family published a more extended account based on her own experiences in <span class="italic">Narrative of a Residence in Belgium, During the Campaign of 1815, and of a Visit to the Field of Waterloo. By an Englishwoman</span>. It was noted for its liveliness and its unflinching account of the horror of the battle, vestiges of which were still very much in evidence when Charlotte visited Waterloo:<blockquote>the effluvia which arose from [the grave pits], even beneath the open canopy of heaven, was horrible; and the pure west wind of summer, as it passed us, seemed pestiferous, so deadly was the smell that in many places pervaded the field. (pp. 270&#150;71)</blockquote>It was also a staunchly patriotic piece of writing, which revelled in &#145;English greatness and glory&#146;, and was considered one of the best contemporary accounts by a non-military writer.<br>
<br>Charlotte Waldie was in Italy until 1818, and in 1820 she anonymously published the very popular and acclaimed <span class="italic">Rome in the Nineteenth Century</span>, which remained in her lifetime the definitive guide to the city. On 22 August 1822 she married Stephen Eaton, a banker, of Ketton Hall, Stamford, Rutland. They had two sons and two daughters. Charlotte Eaton anonymously published <span class="italic">Continental Adventures</span> in 1826, which integrated factual travel writing with &#145;a fictitious story and imaginary characters&#146;, and in 1831 revised and published her early <span class="italic">At Home and Abroad</span>. After her husband's death on 25 September 1834 Eaton revised <span class="italic">Narrative of a Residence in Belgium</span> as <span class="italic">The Days of Battle, or, Quatre Bras and Waterloo; by an Englishwoman Resident in Brussels in June 1815</span> (1853) prior to her own death from breast cancer at 17 Hanover Square, London, on 28 April 1859. A further edition of the <span class="italic">Narrative</span> was issued in 1888 as <span class="italic">Waterloo Days</span>.<br>

<a name="cosubject_28448"></a><span class="headword">Jane Watts <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Waldie]</span></span>  (1793&#150;1826), <span class="occ">artist and author</span>, showed a taste for painting at an early age, and studied under Alexander Nasmyth. She painted many pictures, mostly landscapes inspired by the scenery surrounding her home in Roxburghshire. The result of her travels with her sister Charlotte was <span class="italic">Sketches Descriptive of Italy in 1816&#150;17; with a Brief Account of Travels in Various Parts of France and Switzerland</span> (1820). In 1819 she exhibited <span class="italic">The Temple at Paestum</span> at Somerset House. On 20 October 1820 she married Captain (later Rear-Admiral) George Augustus Watts of Langton Grange, Staindrop, Darlington. After losing her only child, she died at Langton Grange on 6 July 1826.<br>
