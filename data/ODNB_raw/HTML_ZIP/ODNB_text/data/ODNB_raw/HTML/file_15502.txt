<span class="headword">Keynes,  John</span>  (1624&#150;1697), <span class="occ">Jesuit and religious controversialist</span>, was born at Compton Pauncefoot, Somerset, son of Edward Keynes and Anne Brett. The Keynes family belonged to the Catholic gentry and the name Keynes occurs frequently in accounts of seventeenth-century members of the Society of Jesus. In line with the family tradition John Keynes was sent to the Jesuit school at St Omer. In 1642 he went to St Alban's, the English College at Valladolid, with the intention of becoming a priest. Although he had taken the usual vow to return to England after the completion of his studies in order to work on the mission, the registers at Valladolid state that he was released from his vow and joined the Spanish province of the Society of Jesus. In July 1645 he entered the noviciate at Villagarcia. In the following years he went through the various stages of higher Jesuit studies which he completed by being professed of the four vows on 15 August 1662. Meanwhile he had become a teacher. In 1660 he was professor of theology at the Jesuit College of St Ambrose's in Valladolid, and later taught philosophy and theology at Compostela, Salamanca, and Pamplona. At the end of the 1660s he decided to transfer to the English Jesuit province. He became prefect of studies at the Jesuit college at Li&egrave;ge and in 1670 was at St Omer, where, according to Southwell, he became seriously ill when he attended to the spiritual needs of English and Irish Catholic soldiers during a plague epidemic.<br>
<br>Keynes was sent to England in order to recover but was soon engaged in a theological controversy with the Anglican theologian Edward Stillingfleet. Stillingfleet's <span class="italic">Discourse Concerning the Idolatry in the Church of Rome</span> (1671) provoked a number of replies from Catholic writers, but Keynes was Stillingfleet's most persistent opponent. His contributions to the debate were two pamphlets, <span class="italic">Doctor Stillingfleet Against Doctor Stillingfleet</span> (London, 1671), under the pseudonym John Williams, and <span class="italic">Dr Stillingfleet's Principles of Protestancy</span> (London?, 1673), and a full-length book, <span class="italic">Dr Stillingfleet Still Against Dr Stillingfleet</span> (Paris?, 1675), under the pseudonym J. W. Although there is some confusion about Keynes's authorship of these works, the testimony of Keynes's contemporary Southwell seems decisive  (Ribadeneira, 466). Keynes's basic approach as a controversialist is captured in the title of his more general work, <span class="italic">A rational, compendious way to convince, without any dispute, all persons whatsoever, dissenting from the true religion</span> (London, 1674; Latin translation, 1684; French, 1688).<br>
<br>In 1672 Keynes became rector of the London district of the English Jesuits and seven years later his name figures prominently on Titus Oates's lists of accomplices in the Popish Plot (Keynes's uncle, the Jesuit Alexander Keynes, was also named). John Keynes managed to escape to the continent in March 1679 and was appointed rector of the college at Li&egrave;ge in January 1680. During his time as rector he wrote another controversial work answering Bishop William Lloyd's <span class="italic">Papists No Catholics</span> (1677) under the title <span class="italic">No Catholic No Christian</span>. He was dissuaded from publishing this work by the Jesuit provincial John Warner  (Holt, &#145;Letter book&#146;, 465). Together with Thomas Stapleton SJ he wrote <span class="italic">Florus Anglo-Bavaricus</span> (Li&egrave;ge, 1685), an account of the college at Li&egrave;ge and of the Jesuit priests who suffered in the Popish Plot. The work was dedicated to the patron of the college, Maximilian, duke of Bavaria. In July 1684 he succeeded John Warner as provincial of the English Jesuits. In the following years he was in London, where he was responsible for the founding of the Catholic schools at the Savoy and Fenchurch Street. These schools, of which James II acted as a patron, provided free education for both Catholic and protestant children and proved to be very popular. Inevitably with the revolution in 1688 this surprisingly modern experiment came to an end and the schools were closed. Keynes returned to the continent, where he remained provincial until July 1689. He died eight years later, on 15 May 1697, at the Jesuit house at Watten, Southern Netherlands.<br>
