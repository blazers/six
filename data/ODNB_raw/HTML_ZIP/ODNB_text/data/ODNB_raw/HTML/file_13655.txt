<span class="headword">Hondius,  Jodocus</span> <span class="st"> [Joost  de Hondt]</span>  (1563&#150;1612), <span class="occ">engraver and cartographer</span>, was born on 12 October 1563 at Wackene, near Ghent, in Flanders, one of several children born to Olivier de Hondt (<i>d</i>. 1580), engraver, and his wife, Petronella van Havertuyn. Two years later his parents moved to Ghent, where Hondius was educated. By the age of eight he was able to reproduce his own designs by engraving on ivory and copper, and in due course his father apprenticed him to Hendrick van der Keere, an engraver and typecutter at Ghent. Hondius's formal education ceased with the death of both his father and van der Keere in 1580, but he had shown sufficient proof of his talents to be offered commissions by Alexander Farnese, duke of Parma, commander of the Spanish forces in what was then the Spanish Netherlands. As his family was protestant, Hondius declined this invitation, and another to go to Rome, and applied himself to the study of Greek and Latin and to cosmography. When Parma's troops captured Ghent in 1583 Hondius and the family of van der Keere were among those who fled to London.<br>
<br>In London, Hondius adopted the Latin form of his name, settled in the parish of St Thomas the Apostle, Southwark, and was soon at work engraving maps and charts bearing the latest information brought back by mariners venturing new routes into distant seas. His work for the map publisher Edward Wright brought him into contact with the great explorers, among them Sir Francis Drake, Sir Walter Ralegh, and Thomas Cavendish. In 1589 he associated with De Bry and Augustin Ryther to engrave maps for the English version of <span class="italic">The Mariner's Mirror</span>, and he produced a world map in hemispheres measuring some 7&frac12; by 6 feet. He cut type, illustrated the voyages of Drake and Cavendish, and engraved their portraits and those of Queen Elizabeth, Henry IV, and Gerardus Mercator, signing his prints H. J. A set of five circular thematic maps, probably designed as book illustrations, may date from this period. On 11 April 1587, at the Dutch church in London, Hondius married Colette van der Keere, daughter of his late master. Of their thirteen children, two sons and four daughters survived infancy.<br>
<br>Celestial globes had long been familiar, and the first terrestrial globes had been produced on the continent about 1500. The depiction of topographic information on globes grew in popularity as voyages of discovery extended to distant regions and high latitudes, for it was difficult to project such large areas realistically on a flat map. William Sanderson (1548?&#150;1638?), a merchant who had funded several of the northern voyages, paid for the manufacture of a pair of large globes (of 62 cm diameter), the terrestrial being the first to be made in England. Emery Molyneux compiled the maps and Hondius engraved the copper plates in the richly embellished style of the Southern Netherlands. They were published in 1592 and the first pair were presented to Queen Elizabeth at Greenwich. A second pair, bearing Sanderson's newly acquired arms, are now in the library of Middle Temple, London.<br>
<br>In 1593 Hondius left London for Amsterdam, now part of the United Provinces and a prosperous trading city. Hondius was fully employed, obtaining a privilege to publish in 1597 the first pair of his own globes. The celestial globe was the first to show those constellations newly invented by Petrus Plancius, based on a recent survey by Dutch navigators. In the same year Hondius brought out a Dutch translation of Robert Hues's <span class="italic">Tractatus de globis</span> (1594), updated and corrected as <span class="italic">Tractaet Ofte Handelinge van het Genbrijk der Himelscher ende Aertscher Globe</span>, to serve users of his own terrestrial globe. His smaller map of the world of 1596/1597, known as the &#145;Christian knight&#146; from a prominent figure in the margin, was one of the first produced before 1600 to Gerardus Mercator's projection. It led to trouble with Edward Wright, who complained that Hondius had stolen this projection when he was shown in confidence the manuscript of Wright's &#145;Certaine errors in navigation&#146; (1599). The argument turned on whether Hondius had used the method of calculation published by Mercator in 1569, or that of Wright. Hondius was, moreover, in competition with other map makers, first with Jacob Floris van Langren and later with the Blaeu family. In 1602 he bought the plates of Mercator's famous <span class="italic">Atlas</span>, adding fifty more plates in a new edition published in 1606. In his later years Hondius was described as tall and stout, but sober, pious, gentle, and hardworking. He died at Amsterdam on 10 February 1612. The business continued in the hands of his widow and their eldest son, Jodocus de Hondt (1593&#150;1629), later joined by the younger son, Hendrik de Hondt (1597&#150;1651).<br>
