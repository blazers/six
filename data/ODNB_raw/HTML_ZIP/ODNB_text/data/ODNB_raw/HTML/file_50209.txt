<span class="headword">Samuel,  Howard</span>  (1914&#150;1961), <span class="occ">property developer and publisher</span>, was born on 2 February 1914 at 1 Maisemore Mansions, Canfield Gardens, Hampstead, London, one of at least two sons of Henry Samuel, jeweller, and his wife, Grace Jacobs. He was educated at St Paul's School, where he became interested in rare books and while still very young acquired sufficient expertise to contribute to trade catalogues. His business career put a stop to his book collecting activities, but after he had amassed his fortune he resumed this interest and assembled what his <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary called &#145;an important and highly individual collection&#146;.<br>
<br>Samuel went into surveying after leaving school, founding the agency Basil and Howard Samuel with his brother Basil. Their cousin, Harold Samuel, was also active in the commercial property market; he eventually became Britain's most successful post-war property developer and founder of Land Securities, the country's largest property company. Howard Samuel served in the army in the ranks throughout the Second World War and turned to property dealing during the post-war property boom, and with his brother formed a company which acquired extensive properties in London. Great Portland Estates Ltd was subsequently formed to hold these interests and rapidly grew into a major concern. The firm obtained some of its initial mortgage finance from the church commissioners and later took part in the redevelopment of the commissioners' Hyde Park estate. Samuel's property interests formed the core of a considerable business fortune, worth almost &pound;4 million at his death.<br>
<br>Howard Samuel was said to be a man with a strong social conscience, which a long friendship with Aneurin Bevan and Jennie Lee served to develop, and was an active supporter of the Labour Party. He was able to develop his political interests via a close association with the left-wing newspaper <span class="italic">Tribune</span>&#151;he joined its board in 1952 and was an active contributor&#151;and the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>. While visiting the Bevans he met his wife, Jane Lane, the artist. They married in 1944 and later divorced, but remarried in 1959. The couple had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>In addition to his property interests, Samuel's other main area of business activity was publishing, which allowed him to further his enduring interest in books. By the beginning of the 1960s he controlled a number of publishing houses, and shortly before his death he had made an unconditional offer for all the outstanding ordinary shares of Associated Publishers. In addition to his interest in books, Samuel was also recognized as a discriminating connoisseur of painting.<br>
<br>Samuel was found dead in shallow water off Glyfada, near Athens, on 6 May 1961, having drowned after a heart attack. He was survived by his wife.<br>
