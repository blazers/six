<span class="headword">Levy,  Joseph</span>  (1906&#150;1990), <span class="occ">property developer and estate agent</span>, was born on 27 January 1906 at 1 Mansell Road, Acton, Middlesex, the youngest of the five children of David Edward Levy, then a hotel waiter, and his wife, Ellen Kate Twine. David Levy was later described as a manufacturer's agent and as a bookmaker. Joe, as Levy was popularly known, spent his early life in Clapham and was educated at Emmanuel School, Wandsworth.<br>
<br>After working at a bookmaker's and as a stock exchange negotiator Levy entered the property world in 1924, when he and his older brother David went to work for the famous office developer and estate agent Jackie Phillips, whose contracts included the development of Broadcasting House in London. When in 1939 Phillips ran up heavy debts the brothers took over the ailing business, which became D. E. and J. Levy. A year earlier, on 29 December, Joe Levy had married Frances Ninot (<i>b</i>. 1912/13), daughter of Francis Charles Henwood, a hairdresser's assistant; they had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Levy worked first as a civil defence warden and then with the National Fire Service. He was awarded the British Empire Medal in 1941 after entering a collapsing building and rescuing several people. Despite their war work the Levys were able to keep their estate agency open during the war years. They amassed a portfolio of well-located war-damaged properties which were to prove extremely valuable in the post-war property boom; as Levy later recalled, &#145;We were on the spot and we could see that if this country came out of the war, London would have to be rebuilt&#146;  (Marriott, 155). They entered the post-war property market with both substantial experience of the way market conditions had changed during the war and a substantial client base. They understood the complexities of war-damage regulations and arranged a number of &#145;lessor schemes&#146; (by which developers built property for letting to government departments and thereby obtained the necessary building licences) on behalf of developers. During this period they became acquainted with some of the key figures of the property boom, including Harold Samuel, Charles Clore, Jack Cotton, Lew Hammerson, and Charles Forte.<br>
<br>Levy was a prime mover in the 1954&#150;64 office development boom. In the mid-1960s D. E. and J. Levy claimed to have handled for clients some 9 million sq. ft of new London offices. However, the firm's most important role was as principal rather than agent. The brothers formed a partnership with Robert Clark, a shrewd Scottish solicitor whom they had met in 1937 when looking for finance for their first development, three depots for Dunlop. Joe Levy's relationship with Clark was said to be at times stormy, though Clark's cautious temperament, together with Levy's enthusiasm, provided a highly successful blend that was to make both men millionaires.<br>
<br>Joe Levy and his brother, together with Clark, initially established a separate company for each development, the three holding equal shares. However, in 1951 they acquired a small property company, Stock Conversion Investment Trust, to which they transferred their property assets. This was to become one of the most successful companies of the &#145;property boom&#146; era.<br>
<br>David Levy died suddenly in 1952, aged forty-seven. In the same year Joe Levy came into contact with a project which was to form the basis of the largest single development in Britain initiated by the private sector during the first two post-war decades. D. E. and J. Levy were asked to handle the sale of a 1 acre corner site facing Euston Road and Stanhope Street. The vendor withdrew the property, for tax reasons, but resubmitted it to the practice four years later. Negotiations with the London county council revealed that in return for the use of some land for a road development the council would permit a large, co-ordinated development on a 13 acre site of which this property formed a part, it being left to the developer to acquire the remainder. Levy offered the project to Charles Clore, who was initially interested but later pulled out. Levy eventually decided to conduct the expanded project via Stock Conversion, but the estimated cost of development (&pound;15&#150;20 million) made it necessary for the firm to bring in two major contractors, George Wimpey &amp; Co. and Wates, as partners; Wates later withdrew, leaving the others with 50 per cent each. The necessary land was acquired secretly (to prevent the price escalating) about 315 separate deals, and development commenced in the winter of 1963&#150;4. The value of the development, which included 100 shops, 160,000 sq. ft of showrooms, a factory, luxury flats, and a huge volume of office space, was considerably boosted by the imposition of a ban on new office development in and around London imposed in November 1964 by the new Labour government. However, a later attempt to institute a similar development, in conjunction with a road development scheme, at Piccadilly Circus produced considerable delays and complications, leading Levy to sell off Stock Conversion's Piccadilly sites, including the Trocadero.<br>
<br>Levy retired from his surveying practice in September 1973 and subsequently devoted more of his time to Stock Conversion. He remained active with the company until the early 1980s, after which he suffered from increasing ill health. Levy had distributed much of his shareholding via a charitable foundation, together with various family trusts. In 1986 P. &amp; O. took over Stock Conversion in a hostile bid; following this Levy's son Peter started another property company, Shaftesbury plc, of which the elder Levy became president, although he was by then too ill to take an active role.<br>
<br>Oliver Marriott described Levy as a jovial man with an uninhibited pleasure in the material results of great wealth  (Marriott, 154), while his <span class="italic">Telegraph</span> obituary described him as an ebullient, likeable, and blunt cockney, who bubbled with enthusiasm and confidence. Levy was a keen footballer, enjoyed playing golf and tennis, and owned several racehorses and greyhounds. He was also heavily involved in charitable work, serving as founder trustee and chairman of the Cystic Fibrosis Research Trust, vice-president of the London Federation of Boys' Clubs, and a governor of Millfield School and chairman of its rebuilding fund. He was appointed MBE and CBE for his charity work. In 1972 Levy's charitable foundation bought Dickens's Old Curiosity Shop to ensure that it remained in British hands: this repeated history, as his mentor Jackie Phillips had purchased it for similar reasons in 1925, at which time Levy conducted the transaction.<br>
<br>Levy died on 18 December 1990 at his home, Goldsborough, 42 Ladbroke Road, Kensington, from Alzheimer's disease; he was buried at the Jewish cemetery in Golders Green on the 20th. Despite the trusts and the charitable foundation Levy's estate was valued at almost &pound;9 million.<br>
