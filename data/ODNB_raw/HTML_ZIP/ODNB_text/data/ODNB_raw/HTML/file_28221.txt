<span class="headword">Verelst,  Harry</span>  (1734&#150;1785), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born on 11 February 1734 in Hadbury, Worcester, the fifth of seven children of Robert Verelst and his wife, Elizabeth. Harry Verelst was brought up by his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28223/', "William Verelst")</script>, a painter with influential connections, who managed to procure his nephew an appointment as writer on the East India Company's Bengal establishment. He arrived in Calcutta in 1749, then aged only fifteen. His first post of importance was his appointment in 1756 as chief of the company's factory at Lakshmipur. A few months later, after Siraj ud-Daula's attack on Calcutta, Verelst left his station for Falta, where the company's council had taken refuge. After the recapture of Calcutta, Verelst was again sent to Lakshmipur to resume his chiefship. On their way, Verelst and his party were imprisoned by Siraj ud-Daula's officers repudiating the treaty concluded between Clive and their master. Having spent two months in confinement, Verelst was released after the battle of Plassey. His chiefship at Lakshmipur was contested by William McGwire, who insisted on being appointed in Verelst's stead, supporting his demand with the company's order that only a member of the council should occupy that post. On finding his appointment overruled, Verelst returned to Calcutta. Soon after, in 1759, he was appointed to superintend the revenue collection in the Nadia district. He fulfilled this task to Clive's satisfaction and was sent to Burdwan with a similar mission later that year. In February 1760 he was called to Calcutta to take up his seat in the council. At the end of that year he was appointed to take charge of the company's affairs at Chittagong after the cession of that district to the East India Company by Mir Kasim.<br>
<br>As a member of the council, Verelst opposed Governor Henry Vansittart in his decision to depose Mir Jafar in favour of Mir Kasim. He deeply mistrusted Vansittart, and judged the latter's policy as &#145;the works of darkness&#146;  (Verelst to John Carnac, 27 Nov 1761, BL OIOC, MS Eur. F/128/5g), inspired only by private interest. At Chittagong, Verelst was himself widely involved in private trade, including both inland trade (mainly in salt produced on the island of Sandwip) and seaborne country trade. For the latter purpose Verelst and his associates set up a wharf in nearby Bakarganj, from where a first schooner was launched in 1762.<br>
<br>In 1765 Verelst returned from Chittagong to take up his seat in the select committee under Clive's second governorship. Clive had come to appreciate Verelst's considerable administrative abilities during his first government, and had declared in 1764 that Verelst was one of those on whom he relied to reassert order in the company's Bengal establishment. From 1765 to 1766 Verelst's talents were put to good use at Burdwan, and later at Midnapore, where he supervised and reformed the revenue collection. Verelst became a loyal supporter of Clive and from 1766 onwards repeatedly acted as governor during Clive's absence or indisposition, and finally succeeded to the latter's position in January 1767.<br>
<br>As governor, Verelst firmly intended to pursue his predecessor's policy. But the authoritarian sway with which Clive had tried to suppress corruption and licentiousness among the Bengal company servants had made him many enemies. Fear and respect for Clive had kept them in abeyance until his departure, but Verelst did not inspire the same awe. Soon Verelst saw his policy and authority publicly attacked. Richard Smith, the commander of the company's Bengal army, sneered that Verelst thought &#145;Clive the greatest man that ever existed&#146;, and &#145;consequently all his systems infallible&#146;  (Smith to Robert Orme, 31 Aug 1768, BL OIOC, Orme MS 37). But Smith, a member of the select committee, was not the only man contesting Verelst's authority. William Bolts, a junior merchant who claimed to have been done great wrongs at the hands of Clive and Verelst, went to great lengths in publicly denouncing the supposed venality of their governments. His favourite target in Bengal was the governor himself. Back in Britain, in 1772, Verelst published his <span class="italic">View of the Rise, Progress and Present State of the English Government in Bengal</span>, defending his own and Clive's administrations, after a public attack was made on them by Bolts in his <span class="italic">Considerations on India Affairs</span> earlier in the same year.<br>
<br>Verelst was well aware of his meagre successes in imposing his authority on men who did not believe he had any. He never felt at ease in his elevated station and pressed his supporters at home to appoint his successor as soon as possible. As governor, he recognized the need for administrative reforms to put the company's government in Bengal on a more solid basis. On relinquishing his governorship, in December 1769, Verelst analysed the company's situation: &#145;The native government is now fallen, in the eye of the inhabitants, dependant on our own government &hellip; Our original constitution &hellip; must be enlarged in proportion, as our sphere of action is extended and our duty increased&#146;  (Verelst to John Cartier, 21 Dec 1769, BL OIOC, MS Eur. F/218/20). But he warned against an open avowal of sovereignty and advised that &#145;exteriors should be upheld as essentials&#146;  (ibid.), and that every order should carry the sanction of the native government. This staunch adherence to Clive's dual system, even when against his better judgement, is perhaps indicative of Verelst's incapacity to take decisive action where his intelligence clearly indicated that such was necessary.<br>
<br>Verelst was convinced that the people of Bengal should be governed according to their own laws. Acknowledging that the company itself was the source of all power in Bengal, Verelst realized that a thorough &#145;knowledge of the laws and customs of the country&#146; was the <i>sine qua non</i> of the formulation of reforms to improve the administration of justice and thus to establish peace and order in Bengal. His scheme to send supervisors into the different parts of Bengal had, among other intentions, this object in view, and started a process of official information gathering on the country and the people the British were to rule for another 180 years.<br>
<br>Verelst returned to Britain in 1770. In Bengal he had had two illegitimate daughters and an illegitimate son with Sophia Yeandle. At least one of those children was in England by 1778. On 20 May 1771 Verelst married Ann, the rich and attractive daughter of Josias Wordsworth of Wadworth. They had six daughters and four sons. Soon after his return to Britain, Verelst was harassed by litigation started before the courts at Westminster on the instigation of William Bolts. The cases of two Armenians, formerly agents of Bolts, who accused Verelst of having abused his authority as governor in procuring their imprisonment on false grounds, created a stir in London. The cases went against him and Verelst was required to pay &pound;9700 in damages. Though the East India Company would eventually indemnify him for this sum, he was at that time already in dire financial straits. In 1772 Verelst estimated his fortune at &pound;142,711. Much of his fortune, however, was still in Bengal, where deteriorating economic circumstances after the great famine of 1770 severely endangered its recovery. In England, Verelst had stretched his fortune too far in buying the Aston estate, near Sheffield, from Lord Holdernesse for &pound;49,800. In 1775 John Knott, Verelst's private secretary, volunteered to return to Bengal to recover his own and his employer's effects. On the return journey to Britain overland Knott died in the desert, and all papers and effects he carried with him were lost. Verelst's finances never recovered and in 1785 he fled to the continent to escape his creditors. He died on 24 October 1785 at Boulogne, and was buried at Minster in the Isle of Thanet.<br>
