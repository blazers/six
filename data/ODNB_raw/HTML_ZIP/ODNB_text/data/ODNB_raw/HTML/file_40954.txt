<span class="headword">Trollope,  George Haward</span>  (1845&#150;1929), <span class="occ">builder and Territorial Army officer</span>, was born at Westminster on 20 January 1845, the elder son of George Francis Trollope (1817&#150;1895), interior decorator and builder, and Constance Haward. His father had been apprenticed to the firm of Haward and Nixon, Constance's family's building business. At the age of fifteen Trollope joined the family building business, George Trollope &amp; Sons, and had only a limited formal education. In the same year he enlisted as a private in the Queen's Westminster rifles, a militia unit. He rose through the ranks to become the commanding officer and, by 1891, a colonel. Thereafter he was commonly known to his peers and employees as &#145;the Colonel&#146;. Trollope married Jessie, daughter of George Gouldsmith, auctioneer, on 8 April 1869; they had at least two sons, Fabian George Trollope and Howard Woolwright Trollope (who predeceased his father), and a daughter, Sybil L. H. Hickley.<br>
<br>The family firm expanded during the 1850s by undertaking large speculative building projects in Belgravia, but in the later 1860s the economic slump found the building side of George Trollope &amp; Sons dangerously over committed. Fortunately, the firm had been restructured in 1864 to take advantage of limited liability and the assets of its interior decorating, estate agency, and cabinet-making branches were protected. During the 1870s, particularly on the Cadogan estate in Chelsea, the firm re-established itself as builders of residential property. Its reputation was based on the very high quality of craftsmanship and the speed and flexibility with which contracts were executed. The consequent requirement for systematic overtime and disregard for the craft unions' working rules led to repeated outbreaks of industrial strife.<br>
<br>Little is known of Trollope's role in the firm prior to 1891, although he did represent the company on the council of the Institute of Builders. He did not serve a formal apprenticeship in one of the building crafts. By the time that Trollope took control of the business he had acquired his father's hostility to trade unions and the cautious conservatism of his uncle Robert, also a director of the firm. Under his direction, Trollopes remained active in London's West End, building Claridge's Hotel and Alfred Beit's house in Park Lane. The firm also diversified into ship-fitting (making interior woodwork for liners) and the construction of country houses, particularly for South African financiers. Randlord clients included Barnato, Beit, Joel, Phillips, and Wernher. Trollope's imperialistic views and accumulated wealth may have helped to secure these contracts.<br>
<br>In 1894&#150;5 Trollope was at the centre of bitter industrial disputes in London. The trouble began at Beit's house in Park Lane where Trollopes' foreman refused to employ union bricklayers. During the ensuing strike a lurid poster headed &#145;Trollope's Black List&#146; appeared and Trollope obtained a court injunction prohibiting it. The dispute spilled over onto a Mowlems site where the presence of a &#145;Trollope blackleg&#146; provoked a strike. In both disputes the Central Association of Master Builders of London played a pivotal role, supporting the firms while moderating their intransigence in negotiations. Trollope served as the association's treasurer, 1892&#150;3, vice-president, 1893&#150;5, and president, in 1895&#150;6. At one point he advocated that it should support the strike-breaking National Free Labour Association, but later changed his mind.<br>
<br>The firm of Trollope and Colls was formed in 1903 and Trollope served as joint chairman until 1910. Although the Trollope family were the majority shareholders, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46836/', "Howard Colls")</script> appears to have been the driving force of the new firm. Colls had a greater technical understanding of reinforced concrete, structural steel, and other innovations in construction. Following Colls's death in 1910 Trollope became sole chairman of Trollope and Colls, a position he retained until 1924. He recruited Dr Oscar Faber as the firm's first chief engineer, apparently to compensate for the loss of Colls's expertise. During this period the firm undertook very substantial contracts. War work included factories, hospitals, camps, aerodromes, and even an aeroplane factory at Oldham which was the largest in Britain under a single roof (covering 6 acres). After the war large bank contracts were executed, including the construction of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank building at a cost of &pound;1 million.<br>
<br>During the years 1910 to 1924 Trollope and Colls was transformed into a large public company with family directors and professional management. This change was emphasized by the fact that most of the family directors were on active service, overseas during the war. Despite his age, &#145;the Colonel&#146; held staff appointments in France, Mesopotamia, and the eastern Mediterranean. He died at his home, Hammershott, Liphook, Hampshire, on 30 May 1929 at the age of eighty-four. His estate was valued at &pound;75,000: this relatively modest sum may be explained by the references to gifts and loans to family members which appear in his will. He was survived by his wife.<br>
