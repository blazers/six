<span class="headword">Yeaxlee,  Basil Alfred</span>  (1883&#150;1967), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born at 29 Oxford Street, Southampton, on 2 December 1883, the eldest son of Alfred George Yeaxlee, pastry cook and confectioner, and his wife, Lila Lavinia Read. According to an obituarist, his life was one of &#145;complete obscurity&#146; until he appeared at New College, London, to prepare for the Congregational ministry  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 24 Aug 1967). Prior to that he attended Smyth's school, Southsea, then, from 1905 to 1909, he was at Oxford University attached to Mansfield College, having matriculated as a non-collegiate. After service as an assistant Congregational minister in Bootle, Lancashire, he was appointed in 1912 educational assistant to the London Missionary Society and editor to the United Council for Missionary Education. The following year he married Annie Julie Mary Leadbeater (<i>d</i>. 1955); they had two daughters.<br>
<br>The First World War changed the direction of Yeaxlee's career. In the autumn of 1915 the YMCA set up a committee to organize educational facilities for the wartime army and appointed him secretary. The task was to recruit civilian lecturers, mostly people associated with the universities, to give talks, and lead classes in military locations at home and behind the fighting lines abroad. By the end of the war a far-flung structure had been created. Subsequently H. A. L. Fisher, president of the Board of Education, assigned to it &#145;the credit of introducing and developing the largest scheme of adult education which has ever at any time been launched from the country&#146;  (<span class="italic">An Educated Nation</span>, 1920, 58). An obituarist saw added significance in Yeaxlee's own work in France during 1917: the YMCA scheme was a calming influence in a situation where the uncertainties of world politics, and lack of information, were producing considerable unease among the troops  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 Aug 1967).<br>
<br>By the summer of 1917 Yeaxlee was sufficiently well known to find himself part of a national inquiry into adult education, sponsored by the Ministry of Reconstruction. YMCA involvement in army education came to an end in April 1919, and he moved on to be joint secretary to the Educational Settlements Association (ESA), a body with close free-church connections. In this capacity he was recruited to the Board of Education's new advisory committee on adult education at its formation in 1921.<br>
<br>The eight years during which Yeaxlee was secretary to the ESA saw no remarkable progress. A successor in the office has speculated that his approach, emphasizing individual development rather than social activism, may have been inappropriate to the times  (Thomas and Elsey, 664). That is debatable, but clearly his interests were recrystallizing. His doctoral thesis for London University (published as <span class="italic">Spiritual Values in Adult Education</span>, 2 vols., 1925) surveyed the place of organized religion in adult education. By 1929 his <span class="italic">Lifelong Education</span> (a very early use of what much later became a vogue term), was locating adult education in a longer process of &#145;growing up&#146;. In 1930 he became principal of Westhill College, Birmingham, a centre for nonconformist teacher training; then from 1935 an increasing interest in &#145;modern psychology&#146; as applied to religious development in the young (<span class="italic">The Approach to Religious Education</span>, 1931; <span class="italic">Religion and the Growing Mind</span>, 1939) brought him appointments in the department of education at Oxford University (1935&#150;49), and a fellowship of the British Psychological Society.<br>
<br>There was one significant interruption to Yeaxlee's culminating Oxford career. After 1939 the Second World War forced adult education back onto the military agenda: a central advisory council for adult education in HM forces was set up, and the &#145;sage and experienced&#146; Yeaxlee brought in as secretary  (Kelly, 324). There was little of the improvisatory dash of twenty-five years before, but the council had an even bigger task of co-ordinating the civilian contribution. Its chief officer was later (1946) appointed CBE in recognition&#151;a topping up, one might say, of his earlier OBE.<br>
<br>Retirement in 1949 did not halt Yeaxlee's involvement with Mansfield College, the British Council of Churches, and the Institute of Christian Education. In 1958, three years after his first wife's death, he married Margaret Frances Addison Tatham. He himself died at his home, Church Cottage, Islip, Oxfordshire, on 23 August 1967.<br>
