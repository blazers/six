<span class="headword">Townsend,  George</span>  (1788&#150;1857), <span class="occ">writer and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Ramsgate, Kent, the son of George Townsend, independent minister, and his wife. He was educated at Ramsgate and attracted the attention of the playwright Richard Cumberland (1732&#150;1811), who encouraged and helped him to go to Trinity College, Cambridge. He matriculated at Trinity in the Lent term of 1808, and graduated BA (1812) and MA (1816). He was ordained deacon in 1813 and priest in 1814. He became curate of Littleport, Cambridgeshire, in 1813, before moving to Hackney as curate to John James Watson, archdeacon of Colchester. In 1816 he was appointed professor at Sandhurst and became curate at Farnborough, Hampshire.<br>
<br>Townsend's first publication was <span class="italic">Oedipus Romanus</span> (1811), a controversial tract which followed the logic of Sir William Drummond's <span class="italic">Oedipus Judaicus</span> (which had argued that most of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> was an astronomical allegory) in order to suggest that the twelve Caesars represented the signs of the zodiac. <span class="italic">Oedipus Romanus</span> was reissued in 1819, and it also led Townsend to pursue with vigour the research which was to lead to his great work <span class="italic">The Old Testament Arranged in Historical and Chronological Order</span>, whose first part was published in London in 1821. This work obtained the notice of, among others, Shute Barrington, bishop of Durham, who appointed him his domestic chaplain in 1822. This position gave Townsend enough free time to bring out the second part of his work, entitled, <span class="italic">The New Testament, Arranged in Chronological and Historical Order</span> (1825).<br>
<br>During heated arguments over the pending issue of Catholic emancipation, and with Barrington's encouragement, Townsend published a reply to the Catholic Charles Butler's <span class="italic">Historical Memoirs of the English, Scottish and Irish Catholics since the Reformation</span> (1822) with his own <span class="italic">Accusations of History Against the Church of Rome</span> (1825; new edn, 1845). He was rewarded for his controversial work and received, on 25 August 1825, the tenth prebendal stall in the see of Durham, which he retained until his death. He also obtained, on 26 April 1826, the chapter living of Northallerton, which he left on 22 February 1839 to become perpetual curate of St Margaret, Durham. In 1836 he compiled a &#145;Life and vindication of John Foxe&#146;, the martyrologist, which was prefixed to the first volume of an edition of S. R. Cattley's <span class="italic">Acts and Monuments of John Foxe</span> (8 vols., 1837&#150;41).<br>
<br>In 1850 Townsend undertook an unusual journey to Italy with the intention of converting Pope Pius IX to protestantism. He failed in his efforts, but on his return published an account of the mission, <span class="italic">Journal of a tour in Italy in 1850, with an account of an interview with the pope in the Vatican</span> (1850). During his lifetime Townsend also published a variety of poems, sermons, theological studies, and historical works. He brought out <span class="italic">Flowers from the Garden of the Church, or, The Collects of the Church of England Versified</span> in 1854.<br>
<br>Townsend, who was twice married, died at The College, Durham, on 23 November 1857, and has been described by one historian as an &#145;old-style Durham High Churchman&#146;  (Wolffe, 112). A son from his first marriage, George Fyler Townsend, later became perpetual curate of St Michael's, Burleigh Street, Westminster, London.<br>
