<span class="headword">Watson,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1537), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was educated at Eton College from about 1479 until 1483, when he was admitted to King's College, Cambridge. He was elected a fellow of King's in 1486, was ordained priest in 1489, and became a fellow of Peterhouse at about the time that the humanist Henry Hornby was appointed master in 1501. He served as junior proctor of the university in 1504 and was made a Lady Margaret preacher in the following year. He was admitted BTh in 1511. He is remembered chiefly as a Cambridge friend and correspondent of Erasmus, who considered Watson a distinguished theologian and consulted him on his edition of the <span class="roman">Greek Testament</span>. Erasmus described Watson's character as being &#145;devout without bigotry, sociable without triviality and strict but not severe&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 4.181). In 1516 Watson travelled to Venice and the Holy Land in the company of John Reston, recording aspects of life on board ship with other friends of Erasmus. He was admitted rector of Elsworth, Cambridgeshire, on 30 March of the same year, resigning his fellowship at Peterhouse on 6 December.<br>
<br>In 1517 Watson graduated DTh and was instituted master of Christ's College. In that year he declared in a letter to Erasmus that he had formed &#145;a solemn resolution to devote the rest of my life exclusively to biblical and sacred studies&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 4.343). He served as vice-chancellor of Cambridge University in 1518&#150;20 and 1530&#150;32. On 30 April 1523 he was instituted rector of St Mary Woolnoth, London, and on 17 September 1523 became prebendary of Norwell-tertia-pars in the church of Southwell. In 1529 he was one of nearly 200 divines selected to answer, for Cambridge University, Henry VIII's questions about his divorce; he is not listed as one of those favourable to the king. In May 1530 he was one of twenty-four divines selected to examine certain English books feared to contain contentious material on the chief points and articles of religion. One of his fellow examiners was Hugh Latimer who had formerly been Watson's scholar. As master of Christ's, Watson was one of those who opposed Latimer at King's College in 1530. In May 1531, after censuring points made in a sermon by Nicholas Shaxton on Ash Wednesday, Watson, as vice-chancellor, attempted to ensure religious conformity in the university by issuing a decree which imposed an oath on scholars proceeding to degrees in divinity. The list of controversial issues covered by the oath included communion in both kinds, fasting, clerical celibacy, and the authority of the church. The decree was dropped by the next vice-chancellor, Simon Heynes.<br>
<br>Watson retired to King's College after ceasing to be master of Christ's in 1531 (he was replaced by Cromwell's client, Henry Lockwood). In 1536 he became rector of White Notley, Essex, where probably he died, unmarried, in March of the following year.<br>
