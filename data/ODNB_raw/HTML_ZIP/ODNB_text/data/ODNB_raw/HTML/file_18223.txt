<span class="headword">Martindale,  Adam</span>  (1623&#150;1686), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister</span>, was born in September 1623 at High Heyes, Windle, in Prescot parish, Lancashire, and baptized at Prescot parish church on 21 September, the youngest child among the four sons and two daughters of Henry Martindale (<i>c</i>.1578&#150;1658), yeoman, and his wife, Jilian or Julia Dombill (<i>d</i>. 1632). <h2>
<a name="Educationandearlylife"></a>Education and early life</h2>In January 1630 Martindale attended the free school at St Helens. His own account, found in &#145;The life of Adam Martindale written by himself&#146;, composed towards the end of his life, presents a picture of a somewhat haphazard education under the tutelage of incompetent teachers and the companionship of boys less able than himself. Subsequently he studied under a former schoolmaster from the school at Winwick. In retrospect, Martindale found him equally unsatisfactory&#151;&#145;he was a very silly and unconstant man, always making new laws, in-so-much that if a boy had beene absent a day or two, he knew not how to behave himself for feare of transgressing some new ridiculous order or other&#146;  (Martindale, 13). Martindale later attended schools at Rainford and received tuition from various other schoolmasters. By mid-1639 he had acquired sufficient education for him to consider Oxford. However, &#145;the university was not so readie for me; warres being coming on, that soone after turned Oxford &hellip; into a garrison, and many scholars into souldiers&#146;  (ibid., 28). <br>
<br>After failing to gain university entrance, Martindale entered the household of one Mr Shevington of Booths in Eccles parish, as tutor to his children. In addition, he apparently undertook the duties of secretary until his dismissal at Christmas 1641. He returned to his father's house, and subsequently, for about three months, taught at a school at Holland in Wigan parish. He recorded this as an unsuccessful experience owing to a shortage of pupils &#145;in those days of constant alarms&#146;, his lodgings among papists, drunkards, and quartered soldiers, and his reputation as a &#145;roundhead&#146; which he could not &#145;cleare myself from &hellip; by swearing and debaucherie but would have been quiet and meddled on no side&#146;  (Martindale, 34&#150;5). There followed a period of schoolteaching in Rainford. About this time Martindale heard a sermon preached at St Helens by Mr Smith, presumably Timothy Smith, minister of Rainford Chapel in Prescot parish, who was later described by the Commonwealth church survey of Lancashire in 1650 as &#145;an orthodox preaching minister&#146;  (Fishwick, 79). This sermon influenced Martindale greatly, and he seems to have experienced a conversion: &#145;I was rouzed to purpose and this proved a sharp needle, drawing after a silken thread of comfort in due season, so as if I may, without presumption, lay claim to a work of grace&#146;  (Martindale, 36). <br>
<br>Martindale found teaching unprofitable, and turned instead to employment as clerk to Colonel John Moore, MP for Liverpool and governor of the parliamentarian garrison in 1644. Having again failed to prosper, he became clerk to a foot regiment, where his literacy enabled him to assist the quartermaster. The army gave him the opportunity of discussion with devout puritans, who read scripture and prayed together. About this time he took the solemn league and covenant with the rest of his regiment. There he continued until Liverpool was taken by Prince Rupert in June 1644, which led to his imprisonment for about nine weeks and the loss of most of his possessions. On release he became schoolmaster at the free school at Over Whitley in Great Budworth parish, Cheshire. There he embarked on an impressive programme of self-education, and resolved to enter Oxford or Cambridge University should the opportunity present itself. Martindale's determination to defend his rights led to his steadfast refusal to provide free education to a family who had been born in another parish. This in turn led to an argument during which he and the father came to blows. Martindale stayed at Over Whitley until April 1646, when, being of the age for ordination, he accepted an invitation to Gorton Chapel in the parish of Manchester, having apparently gained preaching experience at Middleton and St Helens. <br>
<br>The move to Gorton gave Martindale the opportunity to observe the lively debate over church government between the presbyterians Richard Hollinworth of Manchester, John Harrison of Ashton under Lyne, and Thomas Johnson of Stockport and the Independents Samuel Eaton and Timothy Taylor, ministers of Duckinfield Chapel in Stockport parish. Martindale was reluctant to accept the Scottish model of presbyterianism advocated by such men as Hollinworth, Harrison, and John Tilsley, minister of Deane, Lancashire. He disapproved of the Independent gathered churches, considering them harmful to the common good, as was &#145;the preaching of gifted brethren not intending the ministrie&#146;  (Martindale, 66). He was, however, firmly of the opinion that the doctrine and liturgy of the English church would benefit from a thorough reformation. In Manchester on 31 December 1646 Martindale married Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1620/21, <i>d</i>. in or after 1686), second daughter of John Hall of the Clock-House, Droylsden, and his wife, Elizabeth Low, who had in 1626 married James Jollie. Elizabeth Martindale was therefore half-sister to the future nonconformist ministers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14977/', "Thomas Jollie")</script> and John Jollie. The Martindales had four sons and four daughters born between 1648 and 1665. <h2>
<a name="Martindalesministry16471662"></a>Martindale's ministry: 1647&#150;1662</h2>Towards the end of 1646 or at the beginning of 1647, Martindale approached the veteran puritan minister John Angier with a view to ordination by the newly formed Manchester classis. At a meeting of the classis on 4 March, Martindale presented himself for examination for ordination. The classis signified its approval of him, but&#151;since Angier was deputed to ask the reason for Martindale's non-attendance for ordination&#151;it appears that he had last-minute doubts. Meanwhile his work at Gorton was apparently attracting attention. During 1647 and 1648 Martindale was invited by six parishes in Yorkshire and five in Cheshire to leave Gorton and minister to them. One such was the large Cheshire parish of Rostherne, the living there being vacant following the death of the incumbent, William Shenton, in September 1647. However, some of the parishioners, &#145;thinking themselves undervalued, and not liking a man of my kidney&#146;  (Martindale, 78), attempted to block Martindale's appointment by enlisting the help of the patron, Peter Venables, Baron Kinderton, who had served in the royalist armies. The Manchester classis was informed that Martindale's appointment was not universally popular, and on 21 November 1648 it agreed to delay his ordination until the parish sanctioned the appointment. Martindale and his supporters retaliated by petitioning the committee for plundered ministers, who on 26 March 1649 appointed him to the parish. Again in June and July 1649, Martindale's supporters and opponents made their various views known to the classis. Impatient of the delay, Martindale signified that he would no longer trouble the Manchester classis with his ordination. He travelled to London, where he was examined and ordained by the eighth London classis on 25 July 1649. While in London he obtained a licence to publish his tract <span class="italic">Divinity Knots Unloosed</span>, written &#145;for the strengthening of the younger sorts of christians of our parish&#146;  (ibid., 85&#150;6), in which he examined the nature of scripture and exact doctrine in the light of the antinomianism and anabaptism, which, he feared, were rife in Rostherne and surrounding parishes. <br>
<br>In 1650 Martindale took part in a debate, conducted at a meeting of ministers at Warrington, as to the legality of taking the engagement to the Commonwealth government. Biblical precedent was searched for an answer to a question that deeply troubled Martindale. Could he, in all conscience, take the engagement? Should ministers pay allegiance to usurpers? The question continued to exercise him until <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning the Engagement, or, The Northern Subscribers Plea</span> was published later in 1650. This treatise &#145;by a friend to the commonwealth&#146; examined arguments for and against the engagement and concluded that, being far from the centre of influence and action, and lacking information, ministers should in conscience subscribe and thereby defuse a potentially dangerous situation. These arguments appear to have reassured Martindale, and when called on to subscribe, he did so, although the matter continued to trouble him. <br>
<br>From his appointment to Rostherne parish in 1649 until his ejection in 1662, Martindale tackled his duties as parish minister with an enthusiasm not always appreciated by his parishioners. Not only did he attend to the normal parish duties, but he preached regularly in the parish, and also in its chapels. In addition, he attended and preached on the exercise circuits in Cheshire, Staffordshire, and Lancashire. <br>
<br>In common with his presbyterian colleagues in Lancashire and Cheshire, Martindale showed a willingness to shoulder an impressive workload in the effort to bring godly reformation to the church. A direct challenge to this ambition was posed by alternative strands of puritan ideology. Both Martindale and his fellow presbyterian Henry Newcome, then minister of Gawsworth, east Cheshire, left accounts of the activities of the followers of Samuel Eaton of Duckinfield Chapel. Eaton was respected as a godly minister, episcopally ordained and formerly rector of West Kirby, on the Wirrall. However, the practice of lay preaching among his followers was not welcomed, particularly when carried on in the parish regarded by Martindale as his own preserve. The latter entered into public debate with those Independents who were frequently preaching at Tabley Chapel in the parish, with little success. The lay preachers were as determined to pursue their course as Martindale was to prevent it. In an attempt to counter the Independent threat, Martindale preached at Tabley, where he &#145;answered all the material arguments I had met with for the preaching of gifted men, not intending the ministry, showed the irregularity of such men's thrusting their sickle into my harvest&#146;  (Martindale, 107) and asked that such intruders be discouraged. <br>
<br>As a result of these differing notions as to doctrine, the dissemination of radical ideas by the army, and the growing influence of the Quakers, Martindale published <span class="italic">An Antidote Against the Poyson of the Times</span> (1653), a catechism intended to provide his parishioners with a clear account of orthodox doctrine. As a defence against rising sectarian activity, a number of ministers met at the exercise day in Knutsford on 20 October 1653 when it was agreed to form the voluntary association of Cheshire. Martindale subscribed to the association, which was drawn up along the lines proposed by Richard Baxter's model of the Worcestershire association. In the Cheshire association ministers had no power over each other's parishes. The rules and conditions were advisory rather than compulsory. Interpretation of the conditions as to parish discipline and the appointment of elders seem to have been left to the discretion of the individual minister. To Martindale &#145;these termes were approved as rationall and moderate by many, onely the proud, the grossely ignorant, (especially if ancient) and the scandalous liked not these termes&#146;  (Martindale, 114). Although Martindale referred to this association as the classis, it had none of the organization or authority of the formally convened Lancashire classes. Cheshire men seeking ordination had to request the authority of the Manchester classis or that of Wirksworth (Derbyshire) or Bridgnorth (Shropshire) classes to give them legitimacy. <br>
<br>In the summer of 1655 Martindale entered into public debate on Knutsford Heath with the Quaker missionary Richard Hubberthorne, a formidable opponent from an area of growing Quaker strength. In contrast to the ill-thought-out and irrational argument that he had encountered in other public debates with radical sectarians, Hubberthorne was, Martindale found, &#145;the most rationall calme-spirited man of his judgment that I ever publicly engaged against&#146;  (Martindale, 115). The rising influence of the Quakers in the north-west led the Lancashire presbyterians and Independents to form the Accommodation of Ministers in 1659. Although the Cheshire ministers did not subscribe to the accommodation, Martindale bemoaned the fact that there had not been more attempt to reach agreement in preceding years, particularly in the debate between presbyterians and Independents that he had witnessed at Gorton in 1646. <br>
<br>The late 1650s were a period of uncertainty for presbyterians in the north-west. The ill-fated Cheshire rising on behalf of Charles II led by Sir George Booth in September 1659 implicated many of the presbyterian clergy. Apparently Martindale was aware of plans for Booth's rising, and sympathetic to its aims, but he did not join it, although he considered reasons for and against so doing. In later years, and perhaps with the benefit of hindsight, he wrote that although he had feared that supporting a restoration of the monarchy would result in his ejection from his ministry, such a risk was an improvement on the uncertain political climate and insecure government that prevailed. When the monarchy was restored in May 1660 Martindale welcomed it, &#145;that I might be freed from the yoke of usurpers&#146;  (Martindale, 143), and despotism thwarted. <br>
<br>As Martindale's appointment at Rostherne had been occasioned by the death of the previous incumbent, the <span class="roman">Act for Settling Ministers</span> confirmed his appointment as vicar. Following the Fifth Monarchist rising in January 1661, Martindale was ordered to read orders for the suppression of conventicles to the congregation. By dint of searching the text for loopholes, he persuaded himself that he need not comply. On 25 February he appeared before the justices, where he was &#145;secured as a countenancer of seditious meetings&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1660&#150;61</i>, 515). He was imprisoned at Chester, but released upon a bond of &pound;1000 before 30 April 1661, when Henry Newcome wrote to Richard Baxter: &#145;Blessed be God Mr. Martindale is a freeman now, and returns you hearty thanks for your kindness to him&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 2.14). <br>
<br>Martindale welcomed the Restoration, but deplored the return of traditional custom and ritual. When on 1 May 1660 local youths set up a maypole, he preached that &#145;many learned men were of the opinion that a May-pole was a relique of the shamefull worship of the Strumpet Flora in Rome&#146;  (Martindale, 157). To reinforce his message he invited Thomas Brooke, minister of Congleton, to preach. Elizabeth Martindale solved the problem in a more practical manner when one night, assisted by some women friends, she took a saw to the maypole. <br>
<br>The winter of 1661&#150;2 saw Martindale once more in trouble. He was indicted for refusing to read the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, but he appears to have avoided punishment by proving that although he had not read it, he had not refused to do so because no copy of the book had been supplied to the church, the churchwarden having neglected this responsibility. It was a short reprieve, for on 29 August 1662 he was deprived of his living by the bishop of Chester under the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>, having conducted his last services twelve days earlier. <h2>
<a name="Dissent16621686"></a>Dissent: 1662&#150;1686</h2>After ejection Martindale moved, with his family, to a house at Camp Green, not far from the vicarage. He returned to teaching and taking in scholars, which with income from other sources allowed him sufficient income to support his family. In the early days he formed the habit of hearing the sermons of Benjamin Crosse, his successor as vicar. These he would repeat to sympathetic supporters, adding a discourse of his own. He began to fear that he would be prevented from taking in scholars, following an anti-nonconformist sermon preached by the bishop of Chester at nearby Bowden. He therefore considered a change of career. He was encouraged to learn physic, but prudently decided, &#145;the time would be long, practice uncertaine, and above all, the lives of men were not to be jested with&#146;  (Martindale, 175). He decided on the study of mathematics, encouraged and helped by Lord Delamere (the former Sir George Booth), who subsequently presented him to the school at Warrington. <br>
<br>In 1665, following the passing of the <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span>, Martindale moved his family to Birkenheath, in Rostherne parish, while he went to Manchester to teach mathematics at the grammar school. In 1668 he published <span class="italic">The Description of a Plain Instrument</span>, in which he described the uses of a scientific instrument designed for geometric and navigational measurement. In August 1668 Henry Newcome learned that &#145;certificates from the bishop were issued&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>, 343) against Martindale and Edmund Jones, formerly minister of Eccles parish in Lancashire, for preaching at Gorton. Martindale may have been referring to this when he recorded being brought before the sessions of the peace in the late 1660s. On this occasion he had a good advocate, and the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. <br>
<br>About 1670 Martindale was invited to be private chaplain to Lord Delamere at Dunham Massey, an appointment that lasted until Delamere's death in August 1684. Under the declaration of indulgence of 1672 he was licensed to be a presbyterian teacher at the house of Henry Peacock at Rostherne. Following the retraction of the declaration he continued as chaplain to Delamere, in 1674 moving his family to Millington to bring them nearer to Dunham. About this time he wrote <span class="italic">The Country Almanack</span>, three editions of which were published in 1675 and 1677. <br>
<br>Throughout the period from ejection until his death, Martindale travelled widely to meet sympathetic and like-minded friends, on several occasions visiting Hoghton Tower, Lancashire, where dissenting clergy frequently met under the patronage of Sir Charles Hoghton. The 1670s and the 1680s were in large part overshadowed by his worries regarding his children, only four of whom had survived infancy. In 1673 his eldest daughter, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1648), died. His eldest son, Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1649), whose extravagant lifestyle in London had been a severe worry to his father, died in 1680. The youngest daughter, Hannah (<i>b</i>. 1665), was struck down by a crippling illness. In May 1681 the surviving members of the family moved to Hough Heath in Mere, where Martindale wrote his <span class="italic">Country Survey Book</span> (1682). In Calamy's <span class="italic">Account of the Ministers</span> he &#145;appears to have been a judicious divine, by a little book which he published relating to the Arminian controversy intitled <span class="italic">Truth and Peace Promoted</span> (1682)&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.135). In May 1684 the family moved for the final time, to Leigh in Rostherne parish, to a tenement that Martindale had purchased in 1655 as a home for his wife and family should he predecease them, the rents from which had supplied some of his income since ejection. <br>
<br>Martindale was imprisoned at Chester in June and July 1685 on the groundless suspicion of involvement in Monmouth's rebellion. Later in 1685 he was involved in litigation as a witness in a civil action. He died at Leigh in September 1686 and was buried at Rostherne on 21 September. Thomas Jollie recorded that:<blockquote>the loss of soe faithfull a brother must needs bee grevious to mee and the rather becaus his day was not soe cleer in the evening thereof as might bee desired, he dyed in the close of his great climatericall year (63) which is accounted most dangerous, I dout he had too deep apprehensions thereof. (Jolly, 78&#150;9)</blockquote>He was survived by his wife and two daughters, Martha (<i>b</i>. 1657) and Hannah. The &#145;Life&#146; was edited from a manuscript in the British Museum and published in 1845.<br>
