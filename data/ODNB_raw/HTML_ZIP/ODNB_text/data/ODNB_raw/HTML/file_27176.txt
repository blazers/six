<span class="headword">Thesiger,  Frederick</span>, first Baron Chelmsford  (1794&#150;1878), <span class="occ">lord chancellor</span>, was born at 1 Fowkes Buildings, Tower Street, London, on 15 July 1794, the third and youngest son of Charles Thesiger (<i>d</i>. 1831), comptroller and collector of customs in the island of St Vincent in the West Indies, and his wife, Mary Anne (<i>d</i>. 1796), daughter of Theophilus Williams of London. His paternal grandfather, John Andrew Thesiger (<i>d</i>. 1783), was a native of Saxony, who settled in England about the middle of the eighteenth century, and was employed as amanuensis to the marquess of Rockingham.<br>
<br>Thesiger was sent at the age of seven to Dr Charles Burney's school at Greenwich. He was destined for the navy, in which his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27175/', "Sir Frederick Thesiger")</script>, afterwards Nelson's aide-de-camp at Copenhagen, was a distinguished officer, and went in 1806 to Gosport naval academy. After a year at Gosport he joined the frigate <i>Cambrian</i> as a midshipman in 1807 and was present at the seizure of the fleet at Copenhagen; but shortly afterwards left the navy on becoming heir to his father's West Indian estates by the death of his last surviving brother, George. He was sent to school for two more years and then in 1811 went out to join his father at St Vincent. A volcanic eruption on 30 April 1812 entirely destroyed his father's estate and considerably impoverished his family. It was then decided that he should practise as a barrister in the West Indies.<br>
<br>Thesiger entered Gray's Inn on 5 November 1813, and read successively in the chambers of a conveyancer, an equity draughtsman, and of Godfrey Sykes, a well-known special pleader. Sykes thought his talents would be thrown away in the West Indies, and on his advice, though without family connections there, Thesiger resolved to try his fortune in England. On 18 November 1818 he was called to the bar, joining the home circuit and Surrey sessions. In two or three years, after the removal of his chief competitors, Turton and Broderic, he attained the leadership of these sessions. He also became by purchase one of the four counsel of the palace court of Westminster. The legal experience which he gained through a succession of small civil and criminal cases gave him a good deal of useful knowledge, and his defence in 1824 of Hunt, the accomplice of the famous murderer John Thurtell, brought him to public attention. An action of ejection, which was tried three times in Chelmsford in 1832, was so important in further enhancing his reputation that when he was eventually raised to the peerage, he chose as his title the name of that circuit town.<br>
<br>On 9 March 1822 Thesiger married Anna Maria Tinling (<i>d</i>. 9 April 1875); they had three daughters and four sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36464/', "Frederic Augustus Thesiger")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27174/', "Alfred Henry Thesiger")</script>.<br>
<br>In 1834 Thesiger became a king's counsel and was leader of his circuit for the next ten years. His name became very prominent in 1835 as counsel for the petitioners before the election committee which inquired into the return of O'Connell and Ruthven for Dublin. After an unsuccessful contest in 1840 at Newark against Wilde, the solicitor-general, he was returned to parliament as Conservative member for Woodstock on 20 March. In 1844, owing to differences of opinion with the duke of Marlborough, he ceased to represent Woodstock, and was elected for Abingdon, and at the general election of 1852 he was returned for Stamford by the influence of Lord Exeter.<br>
<br>On 8 June 1842 Thesiger was created DCL by the University of Oxford, and on 19 June 1845 was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. On 15 April 1844 he was appointed solicitor-general in succession to Sir William Webb Follett and was knighted. The breakdown of Follett's health left him almost all the work of both law officers, and on Follett's death he became attorney-general on 29 June 1845, retiring on the fall of the Peel administration on 3 July 1846. Had the ministry lasted another fortnight, he would have succeeded to the chief-justiceship of the common pleas (which became vacant on 6 July by the death of Sir Nicholas Tindal, and was given to Wilde). Instead, he returned to his private practice at the bar, and in parliament acted with Lord George Bentinck.<br>
<br>Thesiger became attorney-general again in Lord Derby's first administration from February to December 1852. When Lord Derby formed his second administration, and Lord St Leonards refused because of his advanced age to join, Thesiger became lord chancellor on 26 February 1858 and was created Baron Chelmsford (1 March 1858) and a privy councillor. His chancellorship was short, since the government fell in June 1859. His chief speech while in office was an opposition to the removal of Jewish disabilities, on which subject he had repeatedly been the principal speaker on the Conservative side in the House of Commons. He was very much opposed to the idea of Jews in parliament, as well as to the establishment of the Roman Catholic hierarchy in England.<br>
<br>After his resignation Thesiger remained active in judicial work, both in the House of Lords and the privy council. He constantly found himself in collision with Lord Westbury. The two men did not get on personally and Lord Chelmsford opposed Lord Westbury vigorously in relation to the hardship inflicted under the new <span class="roman">Bankruptcy Act</span> of 1862 on the officials of the former insolvent court. Chelmsford resumed office again under Lord Derby in 1866, but was somewhat summarily set aside in 1868 by Disraeli when Lord Derby ceased to be prime minister. He died on 5 October 1878 at his house, 7 Eaton Square, London.<br>
<br>Thesiger was, after the death of Follett, probably the most popular leading counsel of his day. As a lawyer he was ready and painstaking, and was a good cross-examiner, although not renowned for his intellectual abilities. Politically, he was right-wing and Conservative; however, as a judge he seems to have remained independent and principled on the whole. Two incidents are reported which, although dubious, did not seem to cast a shadow on his career. The first involved being sued by a client for settling a case without consultation. However, Lord Chelmsford defended himself successfully. The second concerned his purported appointment of a friend (though only barely qualified as a barrister) to the position of master in chancery. In the end he was defeated and outvoted: the friend was never appointed. On balance, he will be remembered as a sound and fair judge; and there is little evidence that these reported incidents damaged his judicial reputation in any way.<br>
