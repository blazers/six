<span class="headword">Dunn,  John Robert</span>  (1833&#150;1895), <span class="occ">chief in the Zulu kingdom</span>, was born, it is believed, at Port Alfred, Cape Colony, the son of Robert Newton Dunn, a Scottish emigrant, and his second wife, Ann Biggar. The family moved to Natal, where the young John Dunn lived on the borders of the colonial frontier, making use of his shooting and riding skills to trade and hunt. He traded in the neighbouring Zulu kingdom, and became known to the heir to the Zulu throne, Cetshwayo, the son of King Mpande kaSenzangakhona. In 1858 he moved to the Zulu kingdom to act as the prince's secretary and adviser. In recognition of this, Dunn was awarded territory in the south-east of the kingdom along the coast between the Thugela and Mhlatuze Rivers, where he set himself up as a Zulu chief. He also traded, hunted, supplied African labour to Natal, and ran guns into Zululand with the assistance of Natal merchant houses. He exploited his transitional status within colonial and African society with ruthless skill. Using the wealth he accumulated to build up his chieftainship within Zululand, he acquired large herds of cattle, built a number of homesteads, and took, to the lasting scandalized fascination of observers, forty-eight wives from the families of his Zulu neighbours. These wives were in addition to Catherine Pierce, the daughter of Robert Dunn's assistant, Frank Pierce, and a Cape Malay woman, whom John Dunn had taken with him to Zululand.<br>
<br>Dunn fled the Zulu kingdom when it was invaded by the British in 1879, and became an intelligence officer in the British forces. After the defeat of the Zulu army and the exile of King Cetshwayo, Dunn was awarded a huge territory in the south of the kingdom. This he attempted to rule with energy and efficiency, thereby incurring the wrath of his erstwhile benefactor and his former Zulu supporters, who saw him as a traitor. His rule there was described by W. R. Ludlow in his <span class="italic">Zululand and Cetewayo</span> (1882); Lord Kimberley, the colonial secretary, commented after reading it: &#145;Dunn has feathered his nest but the stories put about by the Cetewayo party against him are &hellip; mostly untrue&#146;  (Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 10.316&#150;17). However, in 1883 the British withdrew Dunn's appointment as the dominant chief in the south of the country. Dunn's protests achieved little, and he died an embittered man on 5 August 1895.<br>
