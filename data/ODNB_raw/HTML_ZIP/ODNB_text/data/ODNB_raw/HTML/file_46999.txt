<span class="headword">Foden,  William</span>  (1868&#150;1964), <span class="occ">vehicle manufacturer</span>, was born on 23 September 1868 at Bradwall Green, near Sandbach, Cheshire, the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38997/', "Edwin Foden (1841&#150;1911)")</script>, engineer and vehicle manufacturer, and his wife, Sophia Scragg (1841&#150;1893). His father was a partner, later proprietor of an agricultural engineering business at Sandbach which, as Edwin Foden &amp; Sons (later Fodens Ltd), became a noted manufacturer of steam-powered goods vehicles. Educated at Sandbach grammar school, William shared his father's engineering skill, as also did his younger brother, <a name="cosubject_46999"></a><span class="headword">Edwin Richard Foden</span>  (1870&#150;1950)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born at Bradwall Green on 28 March 1870. They both joined the business and assisted their father. On 5 January 1892 William Foden married Ellen Arden Davies (<i>b</i>. 1870?), daughter of Thomas Davies, a hotel keeper; they had three children. Edwin Foden married in 1896 Elizabeth Ann Davenport, and they also had three children; Elizabeth died in 1912, and in 1934 Edwin married Mary Cooke, with whom he had had a further child in 1930.<br>
<br>During the period from the late 1880s to the early years of the twentieth century the family firm successfully developed a steam vehicle for the road, in the form of the &#145;overtype&#146; steam wagon, which carried its payload rather than pulling it as the traction engine did. The Foden overtype wagon, in its 5 ton form, provided Fodens' main product line into the mid-1920s. By this time the model had dated and a successor was introduced, with an improved cab, better driving visibility, and, most important, more powerful brakes.<br>
<br>In 1924 William Foden, who had largely run the commercial side of the business, retired to Australia with his family. This move was brought about by the brothers' major differences with their stepmother, Annie Cowap (1868&#150;1939), whom their father had married in 1894. She had been a major shareholder since their father's death in 1911. More general factors lay behind the upheaval: the depressed market in commercial vehicles as a result of the availability of military stock, and an increasing preference for the internal combustion engine with its greater ease of operation.<br>
<br>William, by correspondence, helped to convince Edwin of the future of the diesel engine, and limited production was in place at Fodens by 1932. Edwin retired in 1932, but after a period of recuperation he returned to the development of a diesel lorry on his own account. With the collaboration of his son Dennis, William's son Ted, and several key figures dismissed by Fodens, Edwin went on to establish in 1933 a rival concern, which became ERF Ltd.<br>
<br>Two years later William returned from retirement, at the age of sixty-seven, and took over again as managing director of Fodens. The firm was by then in dire straits, with an order book of three vehicles and a file of unsettled warranty claims. William eased liquidity problems by introducing sharper accounting methods and greater manufacturing economy. His son Ted also joined the firm, which now concentrated on diesel lorry manufacture, the first Foden diesel lorry having been built in 1931, powered by a Gardner engine. The introduction of a new series of diesel-engined lorries subsequently restored the viability of Fodens. By the end of 1937 the tide of decline had been turned, placing the company in a strong position to develop its war production of military lorries, and also of tanks and shells.<br>
<br>ERF's war production concentrated on military lorries, mostly for the Royal Army Service Corps, with some vehicles for essential civilian users. Edwin Foden died on 23 December 1950, having remained active in the firm until the end of his life and having seen some development of what was to be the post-war model range. He had an interest in all forms of transport: he was successful in cycle racing and progressed to motorcycles and cars, being reserve driver for the Vauxhall works' team in the 1914 Isle of Man motor car TT races. He was also an enthusiastic owner of motor cruisers and interested in flying. Active in charity, Edwin Foden was particularly involved with the Foden Motor Works Band, which had been established by his father. Edwin remained its patron even after setting up ERF. Under such distinguished conductors as William Rimmer and Fred and Harry Mortimer, it played a major role in the life of Fodens in the inter-war period, and it also achieved national prominence through broadcasting.<br>
<br>Diversification helped to carry Fodens through a difficult period after the war. With William Foden as governing director, and assisted by his two sons as managing directors, the firm applied the new two-stroke diesel to industrial and marine uses and developed a rugged dumper-truck range. William's long involvement with the family company came to an end only with his death from heart failure on 2 June 1964, at Knowlton House, Parson Street, Congleton, Cheshire. He was described by Fodens' historian as &#145;a firm, insistent but sympathetic boss&#146;  (Kennett, 155).<br>
<br>The Fodens, William and Edwin Richard, take their place alongside the Dennis, Jensen, and Rootes brothers, as examples of fraternal co-operation in the development of successful motor-manufacturing concerns, but with a significant difference: the Foden brothers finished their working lives as proprietors of competing companies.<br>
