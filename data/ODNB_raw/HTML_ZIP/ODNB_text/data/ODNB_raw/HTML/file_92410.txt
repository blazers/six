<span class="headword">Lucas,  Charles Davis</span>  (1834&#150;1914), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 19 February 1834, probably at Druminargal House, near Poyntz Pass, co. Armagh, Ulster. He was the youngest son in the family of four sons and three daughters of Davis Lucas (1802&#150;1886), a member of the Lucas-Scudamore landowning family, of Clontibret, co. Monaghan (where some accounts have suggested that Charles Davis Lucas was born), and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hill (<i>d</i>. 1837). He joined the Royal Navy in 1848 serving on board HMS <i>Vanguard</i> as a cadet. As an acting mate on board HMS <i>Fox</i> during the Burmese campaigns of 1852&#150;3, he was present at the attack on Pegu, the capture of Prome, and a severe and gallant action near Donabew. His bravery and presence of mind under fire were noted by his superior officers. On 1 July 1853 he was promoted to the rank of mate.<br>
<br>In May 1854 Lucas was appointed mate of HMS <i>Hecla</i>, a small paddle-wheel steam warship, under the command of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11998/', "Captain William Hutcheon Hall")</script>, an officer noted for his prominent role during the First Opium War in 1841. On the night of 21&#150;2 June 1854 the <i>Hecla</i>, with two other ships, was engaging the Russian fortress at Bomarsund, on the Baltic &Aring;land Islands. While the action was of no consequence, neither the fort nor the ships suffering any significant damage, Lucas's actions earned him immortality. At the height of the action a Russian shell landed on the deck of the <i>Hecla</i>, the fuse still burning, and the men were ordered to lie flat on deck. Lucas, as Hall observed, showed &#145;a remarkable instance of coolness and presence of mind in action, he having taken up and thrown overboard a live shell &hellip; whilst the fuse was still burning&#146;  (Hall to Admiral Napier, 22 June 1854, quoted in Bonner-Smith and Dewar, 81&#150;4). The shell exploded as it hit the water, slightly damaging the ship and wounding two men. Lucas was immediately promoted acting lieutenant, and on the recommendation of his commander-in-chief, Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Napier, who cited his &#145;great courage&#146; the Admiralty gazetted him lieutenant with seniority from the day of the action  (Napier to Admiralty, 28 June 1854, ibid.). Sufficiently impressed to promote Lucas, Napier returned to the incident when the Victoria Cross was instituted (in 1856), recommending that Lucas receive the medal. This was the first action for which the Victoria Cross was awarded. Lucas was gazetted with the award on 24 February 1857, and attended the first investiture in Hyde Park on 26 June, when Queen Victoria presented the medals. Unusually, Lucas was also awarded the Royal Humane Society medal for lifesaving, despite being engaged in warlike activity.<br>
<br>After his heroics Lucas was transferred to the <i>Dauntless</i>, and paid off at the end of the year. In 1855 he joined HMS <i>Calcutta</i>, moving to HMS <i>Powerful</i> at the end of the year. Between 1858 and 1865 he served on board HMS <i>Liffey</i>, being promoted commander on 19 February 1862, and ending his service with promotion to captain on 25 October 1867. In 1873 he retired from active service, and became a retired rear-admiral in 1885. Between 1873 and 1883 he commanded the 13th Argyll rifle volunteers (the Ballachulish corps) with rank of brigadier-general. On 22 April 1879 he married Frances Russell Hall, the only child of his old captain. They had three daughters. Lucas served as a justice of the peace for Kent and, while resident in Scotland, for Argyll. He died at his home, Great Culverden, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, on 7 August 1914 and was buried in St Lawrence's churchyard, Great Mereworth, Kent.<br>
<br>Lucas was a typical mid-nineteenth-century naval officer in many respects. He saw service in two significant conflicts, reached the captains' list, and in retirement carried out a number of useful social and military functions. Aside from his presence of mind and courage under fire, his career was unremarkable. Yet, as a result of performing the first act of bravery to be recognized by the award of the Victoria Cross, he has become widely remembered. His medal is on display at the National Maritime Museum, London.<br>
