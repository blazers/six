<span class="headword">Poynting,  John Henry</span>  (1852&#150;1914), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, the youngest son of Thomas Elford Poynting, Unitarian minister at Monton, near Manchester, and his wife, Elizabeth Long, of Bath, was born at Slack Lane, Monton, on 9 September 1852. He received his early education at the school kept by his father, and then went in 1867 to Owens College, Manchester. He took the BSc degree of London University in 1872. In the same year he gained an entrance scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge, and entered in October. In 1876 he graduated third wrangler in the mathematical tripos and returned to Owens College as demonstrator in the physical laboratory under Balfour Stewart.<br>
<br>Elected a fellow of Trinity College in 1878, under James Clerk Maxwell in the Cavendish Laboratory, Poynting began experiments on the mean density of the earth, which occupied much of his time for the next ten years. In the next two years he also published work on the use of balances, the sonometer, the saccharimeter, and on the change of state from solid to liquid. Those articles advanced the understanding of both the physics and mathematics of those areas. He remained at Cambridge until 1880, when he was elected to the chair of physics in the new Mason College, later the University of Birmingham, a post he held until his death. There he developed his interests in improving scientific instruments, and later supervised the construction of new physical laboratories.<br>
<br>Poynting married on 9 June 1880, Maria Adney (<i>b</i>. 1857/8), daughter of John Cropper, a Unitarian minister, of Stand, near Manchester. They had one son and two daughters. In 1887 Poynting received the ScD of Cambridge, continued to act as an examiner for that university, and won their Adams prize in 1893 and the Hopkins prize in 1903. In 1888 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. He was president of section A of the British Association in 1899, of the Physical Society in 1905, and in 1907 was a founder of the National Physical Laboratory. In 1905 he received a royal medal from the Royal Society &#145;for his researches in physical science, especially in connexion with the constant of gravitation and the theories of electro-dynamics and radiation&#146;. He was a vice-president of the Royal Society in 1910&#150;11.<br>
<br>Poynting's most important contributions to physics were two papers communicated to the Royal Society: &#145;On the transfer of energy in the electromagnetic field&#146;  (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 1884) and &#145;On the connexion between electric currents and the electric and magnetic induction in the surrounding field&#146;  (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 1885). These papers revolutionized ideas about the motion of energy in the electric field. For example, it was previously supposed that when a charged Leyden jar was discharged by connecting the inside and outside by a wire, the energy travelled along the wire. Poynting's explanation was that the energy spread out from the glass between the coatings of the jar and then converged sideways into the wire, where it was converted into heat. He showed that there was a general law for the transfer of energy, according to which it moves at any point perpendicularly to the planes containing the direction of the electric and magnetic forces, and the amount crossing unit area per second is equal to the product of these forces multiplied by the sine of the angle between them and divided by 4&#960;. The line which represents in direction and magnitude the flow of energy at any point is now known as the Poynting vector and is of fundamental importance in electromagnetic questions.<br>
<br>Poynting did work which was important at the time on the pressure of radiation. This helped to confirm earlier work by Maxwell, but was later more usually explained in terms of the quantum theory of radiation. Poynting established the existence of the tangential force produced when light is reflected from a surface at which there is some absorption, and the existence of a torque when light passes through a prism. He succeeded in demonstrating the recoil from light of a surface giving out radiation. These experiments, in which he was associated with Guy Barlow, are a good example of Poynting's practical skill. He had exceptional mechanical ability and an excellent knowledge of the capabilities of instruments.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Poynting was engaged on researches connected with gravitation. As well as his early experimental work on determining the density of the earth, he investigated whether the gravitational attraction between two crystals depended on the orientation of their axes, and whether the attraction was affected by temperature. He also made important contributions to the theory of the change of state in matter  (<span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, 1881) and to osmotic pressure  (<span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, 1896). He took great interest in the philosophical basis of physics and chose this as the subject of his presidential address to section A of the British Association in 1899. There he argued for physicists to move away from a mechanical cause&#150;effect view of scientific laws, and that the aim should be to reduce the number of laws. He used as examples the notions of corpuscle and wave as applied to light.<br>
<br>Poynting's <span class="italic">Collected Scientific Papers</span> was published by Cambridge University Press in 1920. In addition he wrote <span class="italic">On the Mean Density of the Earth</span> (Adams prize essay, 1893), <span class="italic">The Pressure of Light</span> (1910), <span class="italic">The Earth</span> (1913), and, in conjunction with J. J. Thomson, a series of textbooks on physics. Poynting was very successful as a teacher, and his sound judgement and conspicuous fairness and courtesy were of great service to the University of Birmingham. He became dean of the science faculty when Mason College was made the University of Birmingham, and held the office for twelve years.<br>
<br>Poynting suffered from diabetes for twenty years. To improve matters he lived for some time at a small farm in Alvechurch in Worcestershire where he pursued his interests in farming and natural history. He was for some time chairman of the Birmingham Horticultural Society. He died of diabetes at his home, 10 Ampton Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, on 30 March 1914. He was survived by his wife.<br>
