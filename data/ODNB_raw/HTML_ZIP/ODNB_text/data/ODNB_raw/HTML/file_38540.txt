<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bauer,  Franz Andreas</span>  (1758&#150;1840), <span class="occ">microscopist and botanical artist</span>, was born on 4 October 1758 in Feldsberg, Austria (now Valtice, Czech Republic). He was the second of the four sons of Lukas Bauer or Baur (1706/7&#150;1762), a religious and court painter to the prince of Liechtenstein. After his father's death he was trained by his mother, Theresia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hirsch, and encouraged by Dr Norbert Boccius, prior of Feldsberg monastery. His first published drawing, at the age of thirteen, was of <span class="italic">Anemone pratensis</span> (unsigned) in a work by von St&ouml;rck (1771). On moving to Vienna about 1780, Franz and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38542/', "Ferdinand Lukas Bauer (1760&#150;1826)")</script> met Baron Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin (1727&#150;1817), director of the Sch&ouml;nbrunn Imperial Gardens, and improved their botanical techniques by working on his <span class="italic">Icones plantarum rariorum</span> (1781&#150;93). During the spring of 1786 Ferdinand Bauer was engaged by John Sibthorp (1758&#150;1796) for a botanical tour of the Near East and returned with him to England. Two years later, Franz Bauer began a European tour with his friend Joseph Franz von Jacquin. On visiting London, after seeing his brother (then working for Sibthorp at Oxford), to use the library and herbarium of Sir Joseph Banks, Bauer was persuaded to work at Kew as a resident draughtsman to draw newly discovered plants. He took up the position in 1790, and was occupied in such work over the next eighteen years; all his drawings became the property of Banks. In addition he drew specimens for Robert Brown and Banks's other friends. For a short period Bauer acted as unpaid drawing-master to Queen Charlotte and the princesses and also had other pupils including T. C. Holland and William Hooker (1779&#150;1832). After 1816 he worked for Sir Everard Home (1756&#150;1832), Banks's physician, using his talent for microscopical detail to produce accurate drawings of animal and human organs for various papers, subsequently reprinted as Home's <span class="italic">Lectures on Comparative Anatomy</span> (1814&#150;28). Bauer became a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1804 and of the Royal Society in 1821.<br>
<br>Although unofficially identified as &#145;Botanick painter to His Majesty&#146; when working at Kew, Bauer's salary was paid by Banks, and ceased with his death in 1820. Banks bequeathed his library and herbarium to the British Museum and at one time it was intended that all the botanical books were to be sent to Kew with Bauer filling the post of librarian. That scheme failed but Bauer received a life annuity of &pound;300 under Banks's will on condition that he continue to work at Kew, while various codicils and conditions caused further difficulties that halted other provisions for Bauer's future  (Meynell, &#145;Francis Bauer&#146;, 211&#150;12; Desmond, <span class="italic">Kew</span>, 409&#150;10). With Robert Brown, Bauer was involved in implementing the provisions of Banks's will.<br>
<br>Bauer remained at Kew throughout his life and produced drawings, including those for Lindley's <span class="italic">Illustrations of Orchidaceous Plants</span> (1830&#150;38) and William Hooker's <span class="italic">Genera filicium</span> (1842), and even produced popular articles on the diseases of corn under his own name  (<span class="italic">Penny Magazine</span>, 2, 1833). Apparently Bauer simply followed his own bent, satisfying a curiosity and fascination with the floral mechanisms of the Orchidaceae and of micro-organisms. His sketchbooks of 1805 and 1813 reflect this continued interest in palynology and plant pathology, while a paper  (<span class="italic">Transactions of the Linnean Society</span>, 18, 1840, 475&#150;82) demonstrated a concern to establish the priority of his research. Meynell  (&#145;Francis Bauer&#146;, 214) emphasized that a feature of Bauer's work was its continuity, with some projects taking several decades, although on occasion he produced single drawings for particular papers.<br>
<br>Everyone for whom he worked valued Bauer's opinion on scientific questions, realizing that in order to achieve such detailed drawings he thoroughly understood the material. Baker established that Bauer had recognized in his drawings numerous microscopic features of pollen &#145;that were not cleared up until &hellip; half a century later&#146; and concluded that, had his work been known, the science of palynology would have advanced much earlier. This contradicts the contention of Olby  (<span class="italic">DSB</span>, 1.520&#150;21) that Bauer's microscopical paintings had little scientific worth since they were made without the benefit of modern laboratory techniques. It was during the studies of pollen that Bauer published his lithographs of <span class="italic">Strelitzia depicta</span> (1818) that are virtually original watercolours. His knowledge, together with a general affability and modesty, encouraged his medical and botanical acquaintances to meet regularly at Kew as a discussion circle, while most scientists visiting London endeavoured to meet him.<br>
<br>Bauer died at his home, Eglantine Cottage, 20 Waterloo Place, Kew Green, on 11 December 1840 at the age of eighty-two; he was buried on 16 December at St Anne's Church, Kew Green. The epitaph on a memorial tablet recognized that &#145;In microscopical drawing he was altogether unrivalled&#146;; not surprisingly it was found that he had sixteen microscopes. Shortly before his death, Bauer had adopted Elizabeth Baker, his maid for the past twenty-five years, as his daughter. To the end of his life he is said to have retained his German accent and had difficulty in writing polished English  (Haverfield).<br>
<br>Together with his brother Ferdinand, Franz Bauer created a standard of botanical artistry combined with critical observation that has never been equalled. Banks had considered that any description of the plants portrayed in the <span class="italic">Delineations of Exotic Plants</span> (1796&#150;1803) was superfluous as the figures displayed every aspect. Bauer has since been regarded as one of the outstanding artists in the &#145;golden age&#146; of flower painting  (Desmond, <span class="italic">Kew</span>, 434); Blunt  (Blunt and Stearn, 199), when deciding &#145;the greatest botanical artist of all time&#146;, stated &#145;I myself unhesitatingly give first place to Franz Bauer&#146;, believing he was &#145;the more perfect craftsman&#146; when compared with his brother. Stearn  (<span class="italic">Endeavour</span>, 27, 35), however, felt that the two brothers had to be honoured together, as they stood &#145;unrivalled &hellip; as supreme masters of their craft which came nearer to perfection than that of any other artist before or since&#146;.<br>
