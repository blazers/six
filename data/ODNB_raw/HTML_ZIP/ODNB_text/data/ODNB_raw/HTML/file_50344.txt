<span class="headword">Briouze,  Giles  de</span>  (<em>c.</em>1170&#150;1215), <span class="occ">bishop of Hereford</span>, was one of the oldest among the sixteen children born to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3283/', "William (III) de Briouze (d. 1211)")</script>, and his wife, Matilda de St Val&eacute;ry (<i>d</i>. 1210). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47212/', "Loretta de Briouze")</script> was his sister. William held numerous lordships in Normandy, England, and Wales, notably in Brecon and Upper Gwent in the southern Welsh marches. It is likely that William and Matilda married before 1170 and that Giles was born in or around that year. It is not known how or where he was educated, though it is conceivable that he received some of his schooling from one of his father's clerks, Master Hugh de Mapenore, whom he later made dean of Hereford.<br>
<br>The bishopric of Hereford fell vacant on the death of William de Vere on Christmas eve 1198, and an attempt by Hereford Cathedral chapter to elect Walter Map (<i>d</i>. 1209/10) as his successor in 1199 was thwarted by the death of Richard I. At the start of John's reign William de Briouze was high in the king's favour; in addition to other benefits, John bestowed the bishopric of Hereford early in 1200 on William's son Giles to increase the family's standing in the Welsh marches yet further. Giles was consecrated on 24 September 1200 in St Catherine's Chapel at Westminster, and during his first four years as bishop he continued to receive signs of John's favour, including the grant of an annual fair at Lydbury North in 1201 and the right to take sixteen deer in the forest of Malvern in 1204.<br>
<br>Briouze was an active and efficient diocesan. Nearly fifty of his episcopal <i>acta</i> survive, and although most of these, as would be expected, are charters requested by beneficiaries, many of them show knowledge of and interest in canon law. To support him in his administration Briouze employed at any one time about four clerks with the title <i>magister</i>, in addition to chaplains and junior clerks. One of the <i>magistri</i> was Walter Map's nephew Philip. In addition to his duties as diocesan, Briouze was fairly often appointed to act as papal judge-delegate. The cases included the dispute between the priories of Llanthony Prima (Llanthony in Wales) and Llanthony Secunda (Lanthony by Gloucester) over the division between the two houses of their widely scattered properties and of their rights and their muniments. Briouze, acting with two fellow bishops, Mauger of Worcester (<i>d</i>. 1212) and Eustace of Ely (<i>d</i>. 1215), attempted to settle this dispute in 1205.<br>
<br>As bishop of Hereford, however, Briouze was also a marcher lord, and through this and his family connections was drawn into Welsh border politics. He was involved in the dispute between his family and Gwenwynwyn of Powys (<i>d</i>. 1216?), settled by King John in August 1204. Then, late in 1206, King John began to take action against the hitherto loyal William de Briouze, and in 1208 he appointed his mercenary captain, Girard d'Ath&eacute;e, sheriff of Herefordshire, the better to threaten William's lordship in Brecon and Giles's own position as bishop of Hereford. In late April and early May 1208 Briouze seems to have been forced to travel with John, presumably as surety for his father's good conduct. Later in May he fled to France, where he formed part of a group of English exiles seeking the support of King Philip Augustus against John. It is likely that Briouze, whose feelings against John must have been further embittered by his treatment of his mother and eldest brother, who were starved to death in Windsor Castle in 1210, assisted Llywelyn ab Iorwerth (<i>d</i>. 1240) to make his treaty of alliance with Philip Augustus in 1212. In order to support himself in France, Briouze seems to have offered his services to French bishops as a substitute: in May 1210 he dedicated a chapel at St Riquier at the request of Bishop Richard of Amiens.<br>
<br>After John had made terms with the papacy in May 1213 Briouze, with the other exiled bishops, returned to England. John visited Hereford late in 1213 and granted him seisin of the manor of Tetbury, and when John left Hereford, Briouze accompanied him to Guildford. Early in 1214, however, John ordered Briouze and three other bishops to keep the peace. Briouze's main grievance was that his family's lands were being withheld from his young nephews, the sons of his eldest brother, William. Negotiations between the two parties broke down in May, after which John gave Briouze's Gloucestershire lands to Henry fitz Count (<i>d</i>. 1222). During the summer Briouze joined the baronial opposition to John, and he and Llywelyn ab Iorwerth won the support of all the inhabitants of the marches except Hugh de Mortimer, whose castle of Cwm Aran in Maelienydd they razed. Peace was made in October by the papal legate Nicol&ograve; of Tusculum, at a council held at Wigmore.<br>
<br>Once more Briouze returned to John's entourage, accompanying his ruler to Worcester in December and to London in January. However, his sympathies must certainly have been with the other side, the more so because by 5 March the fine he was required to pay for his paternal inheritance had been set by the king at the very high figure of &pound;6000. Briouze clearly protested, for on 10 May his fine was one of two which John offered to submit to the judgment of his court. The bishop, no doubt regarding that court as unlikely to be impartial, continued in his support for the barons, and it was probably his influence that led to the inclusion of a clause condemning Girard d'Ath&eacute;e in <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>. Following Llywelyn's capture of Shrewsbury on 17 May 1215, Briouze rose in rebellion and he and his brother Reginald took possession of their family's castles in Brecon, Giles himself capturing Brecon, Hay, Radnor, Builth, and Blaenllyfni. He was not uncompromising in his enmity to King John, however, but continued to negotiate with him, until on 21 October a lower fine was agreed upon (the amount is unrecorded) for the restoration of his lands, castles, and the custody of his nephews. But before the necessary arrangements could be made Briouze died at Gloucester on 17 November 1215. He was buried in Hereford Cathedral, where his tomb was marked by an effigy in the late thirteenth century.<br>
