<span class="headword">Grimaldi,  Joseph <span class="st"> [Giuseppe]</span></span>  (1709<span class="mult">x</span>16?&#150;1788), <span class="occ">dancer and dentist</span>, was probably born between 1709 and 1716, perhaps in Malta, the son of the dancer John Baptist Grimaldi (<i>fl</i>. 1709&#150;1741) and his wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1773). Many details of his life and circumstances are based on hearsay, conjecture, and fragmentary information. He was one of a family of Italian entertainers who performed throughout western Europe, &#145;where he spent the first forty years of his life&#146;  (Findlater, 33). His father, also known as Nicolini, was the first to use Grimaldi's byname of Gamba di Ferro, or Iron Legs. Grimaldi may have appropriated his father's stage name to bolster his status and career in England, or confusion in later accounts of his life may be responsible for an erroneous conflation of the father's achievements with those of his son.<br>
<br>When Grimaldi first settled in England is uncertain. He appeared as a dancer at the King's Theatre on 10 January 1758 and may have continued to perform there during the rest of the season. He performed at Drury Lane during the 1759&#150;60 season and in every following season (apart from 1777&#150;8) for the next twenty-six years. As a dancer he excelled in the role of Pantaloon in numerous harlequinades; as a ballet master he both choreographed and performed in dances which were presented either as set pieces in a longer stage play or as separate items in the programme. He also acted as <i>ma&icirc;tre de ballet</i> during the summer months at Sadler's Wells Theatre from 1763 onwards and at the Royal Circus in 1782. Following in the footsteps of his paternal grandfather, also John Baptist Grimaldi (who appears to have spent some time in England and whose will, dated 11 March 1760, can be found in the Public Record Office), he practised dentistry alongside his career in dance, advertising himself as a &#145;Surgeon-Dentist, who has had the Honour of attending her MAJESTY, the Prince of Wales, and the Prince and Princess of Brunswic&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>).<br>
<br>On 13 April 1762, when he was in his late forties or early fifties, Grimaldi married a sixteen-year-old dancer, Mary Blagden (1745/6&#150;1781). There were four children from this first marriage: Mary, baptized at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 19 January 1763; Isabella Louisa, baptized at St Paul's on 14 October 1764; Margaret Charlotta, born in 1765; and Catherine, born in 1767. During the 1760s Grimaldi had a number of affairs with young dancers and entertainers. He had contracted syphilis by 1767 and infected his wife with the disease, insisting on having sexual relations with her while she was carrying their fourth daughter. Grimaldi and Mary stopped living together in 1775, and in 1779 Mary&#151;two years before her death&#151;began divorce proceedings on the grounds of severe cruelty and abuse. About 1775 Grimaldi began a relationship with Rebecca Brooker (<i>d</i>. 1819), a young dancer at Drury Lane, by whom he had two, or possibly three, illegitimate children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11630/', "Joseph Grimaldi")</script>, the future clown Joey, born on 18 December 1778, baptized at St Clement Danes on 28 December; and John Baptist, born some time in 1780. William, mentioned in Grimaldi's will, may have been a third son by Rebecca (being one of the three young Grimaldis who performed alongside her in the Drury Lane season 1789&#150;90). However, he may have been the result of a parallel relationship, for, in the same month and year as Joseph was born, another illegitimate child, Henrietta Marguerite, was born to Ann Perry, with whom Grimaldi was having an affair. Ann later adopted the name Grimaldi and lived with Grimaldi at 125 High Holborn, while Grimaldi continued to maintain a household with Rebecca Brooker and their children at Theatre Court, Lambeth. Old Grim had a reputation as a coarse humorist and an obscene practical joker, a harsh and cruel teacher, an accomplished dancer and pantomimist, and a violent and melancholic human being whose obsession with death is recorded in numerous contemporary anecdotes, in Charles Dickens's <span class="italic">Memoirs of Joseph Grimaldi</span>, and in the bizarre details of the will he made on 25 February 1786. He requested that, on the day that he was buried, his eldest child, Mary, should sever his head from his body. Grimaldi died of dropsy two years later, on 14 March 1788, perhaps at Theatre Court, Lambeth, and Mary employed a surgeon to carry out the beheading. She touched the knife as he did so. Grimaldi also stipulated that Mary, Joseph, John Baptist, and William should share his estate equally and that Margaret and Catherine should receive nothing; no mention was made of his other children or of Rebecca Brooker or Ann Perry. He was buried at the Northampton Chapel in Exmouth Street, Clerkenwell, on 23 March 1788.<br>
