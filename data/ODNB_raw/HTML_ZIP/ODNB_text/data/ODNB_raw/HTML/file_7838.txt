<span class="headword">Dormer,  John</span>  (1730&#150;1796), <span class="occ">army officer in the Austrian service</span>, was born on 18 February 1730 at Grove Park, Warwickshire, the second son of John, seventh Baron Dormer (1691&#150;1785), of Grove Park, and Mary (<i>d</i>. 1739), daughter of Sir Cecil Bishopp of Parkham, Sussex. The Dormers were an Anglo-Catholic family with large estates in Warwickshire and Buckinghamshire, but the career prospects in England for a younger son of the Catholic aristocracy before emancipation were poor. Consequently John Dormer left England on 24 July 1752, and studied at the military academy in Vienna between September 1752 and August 1753. According to family papers  (Warks. CRO, CR895/107) he joined General Count Luquesy's regiment of cuirassiers as a cornet in May 1754 and saw action against the Prussians in the Seven Years' War. After the battle of Prague (6 May 1757) he was promoted to captain and was present at Breslau (22 November 1757) and Leuthen (5 December 1757). After the battle of Stochkerch (18 September 1757) he was given command of the 4th squadron of carabiniers. At Maxen (18 November 1759) Dormer's squadron, together with General O'Donnell's carabiniers, relieved and saved a battalion of Croats, which had been surrounded by seven squadrons of Prussian dragoons. Dormer's squadron played an equally prominent role at Torgau (2 November 1760), taking five pairs of colours. In 1762 he became 2nd captain of the regiment, now the Kleinhold cuirassier regiment, and 1st captain in 1763. When his regiment was disbanded in 1768 he was transferred to Count Serbelloni's cuirassier regiment. On 29 January 1767 he was appointed chamberlain to Empress Maria Theresa.<br>
<br>On 22 May 1775 Dormer married Elizabeth (1753&#150;1824), second daughter of General Count Gabriel Buttler of Erdo-Teleck, near Eslau in Hungary. In 1777 he established his family at Gran in Hungary, where he resided until his death. Following his retirement from the service, in January 1782, he was granted the brevet rank of major.<br>
<br>A small group of letters from Dormer to his family in England during the 1790s has survived; these letters record his opinions on events in revolutionary France and the legal and civil condition of Catholics in England. On 4 December 1792 he wrote to his brother Charles, eighth Baron Dormer,<blockquote>I hope our countrymen will not suffer themselves to be outdone by the French in the generous strife to extend freedom and promote the happiness of mankind. Why should Protestants view us poor Roman Catholics with scornful and suspicious eyes &hellip; if they had seen us in private life, upright, quiet and faithful in our engagements and just in our dealings, why have we been deprived so long of the Rights of Man and why are so many younger brothers &hellip; obliged to exile themselves and search precarious fortunes in foreign climates, to avoid a dependent life.</blockquote>He added that &#145;every spirited Briton would return to his native soil if the advantages of constitutional rights were granted him&#146;  (Warks. CRO, CR895/68).<br>
<br>Dormer did not return to England but lived out his life in frustrated exile. He died on 19 November 1796 aged sixty-six, and was buried on 21 November in the church of St Peter and Paul, Gran. His wife, Countess Elizabeth, died on 6 April 1824. He was survived by two children (three died young): Antonia Dormer (1782&#150;1805), who married Baron O'Brien, a general in the Austrian service; and Joseph Thaddeus Dormer (1790&#150;1871), who, in 1826, succeeded his cousin as eleventh Baron Dormer and also inherited the family's Warwickshire estates.<br>
