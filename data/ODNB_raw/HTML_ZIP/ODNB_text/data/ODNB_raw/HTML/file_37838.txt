<span class="headword">Peace,  Charles Frederick</span>  (1832&#150;1879), <span class="occ">burglar and murderer</span>, was born in Nursery Road, Sheffield, on 14 May 1832, the youngest of the four sons of John Peace, shoemaker, and his wife, the daughter of a naval surgeon. Semi-literate after a cursory schooling, he had a talent for music, being proficient enough with a violin to be billed in his teens at local places of entertainment as the &#145;modern Paganini&#146;. Despite his artistic pretensions, he was apprenticed to a local steel mill, where two accidents left him with a permanent limp and the loss of three fingers of one hand.<br>
<br>Although he was to become Britain's most successful cat burglar, Peace showed no early aptitude, and was frequently arrested. By 1854 he had graduated to longer spells in prison&#151;three sentences totalling twenty years, substantially reduced through remission. Meanwhile, at the age of twenty-seven he met, and is believed to have married, Hannah Ward, a widow with a small child. They had a daughter and a son who died in infancy. But he was learning from experience and moved from town to town to polish his burglary skills.<br>
<br>By 1872 accrued capital enabled Peace to return to Sheffield with his wife and stepson, setting up as a picture framer. His income was supplemented from the sale of musical instruments and small antiques. Success as a burglar was achieved through skill, daring, and an ability to change his appearance&#151;a considerable feat considering his distinctive appearance. The limp accentuated a natural bandiness, and being very short he was compared to a monkey, an impression heightened by thick features and a heavy lower jaw.<br>
<br>Peace's unfortunate appearance and lack of education was offset by a compelling personality, and in 1876 he embarked on an affair with a neighbour, the much younger Katherine Dyson. However, when he attacked her husband, Arthur, she protested and, in front of witnesses, Peace threatened her with a gun. A warrant for his arrest forced him to flee, committing a trail of burglaries in northern cities. In Manchester he was intercepted by PC Nicholas Cock, who was shot and killed. The police arrested John and William Habron, and managed to produce &#145;eye-witnesses&#146; at the trial, which Peace attended in disguise. William was sentenced to death&#151;commuted to life imprisonment because he was only eighteen.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, having returned to Sheffield, Peace shot and killed Arthur Dyson after an argument. Accompanied by his wife and stepson, he headed south, leaving his mark as a burglar. In Nottingham he acquired a mistress, Susan Grey, an attractive and educated widow who accompanied the Wards (he was now using Hannah's name) to London, where they eventually settled in Peckham. Susan was used to complete the air of respectability&#151;the couple called themselves Mr and Mrs Thompson, and Hannah lived in the basement, posing as their housekeeper. Quite affluent, the newcomers entertained, although Mr Thompson managed to get away at nights, robbing houses across London. However, after considerable success he was eventually caught in October 1878, breaking into a house in Blackheath. Ambushed by two policemen, Peace was overpowered by PC Edward Robinson despite a bullet through the arm. The following month &#145;John Ward&#146; was given a life sentence for shooting with intent to murder. At that stage Susan Grey revealed his true identity for the &pound;100 reward.<br>
<br>On the train to face trial in the north, Peace jumped through an open carriage window, and although a guard clung to his shoe he wriggled free, only to be found unconscious in the snow. At Leeds assizes, the evidence of Katherine Dyson was conclusive. Awaiting execution, Peace finally confessed to the murder of PC Cock, providing the detailed evidence to persuade the authorities of Habron's innocence. Peace was hanged by William Marwood at Armley Prison, Leeds, on 25 February 1879, having composed his own memorial card, ending with the words: &#145;For that I don [<i>sic</i>] but never intended.&#146;<br>
