<span class="headword">Cole, Sir  Ralph</span>, second baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1629, <em>d.</em> 1704), <span class="occ">painter and patron of the arts</span>, was baptized on 3 November 1629. Of his six sons, Ralph was the first surviving son and heir of Sir Nicholas Cole, first baronet (<i>d</i>. 1669), of Brancepeth Castle, co. Durham. The founders of this family were Nicholas and Thomas Cole, sons of James Cole, smith, of Gateshead. Thomas amassed a large fortune and died in 1620; Nicholas was the father of Ralph Cole, sheriff of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1625 and mayor in 1633, who bought Brancepeth Castle. The Brancepeth estates of Charles Neville, sixth earl of Westmorland, had been sequestrated by the crown for his support of Mary, queen of Scots, during the rising of the northern earls in 1569. In 1613 James I gave Brancepeth Castle to Robert Carr, earl of Somerset, who later forfeited it by attainder, and Ralph Cole bought it in 1636. Ralph Cole was the father of Nicholas Cole of Kepier, near Durham, who was created a baronet on 15 February 1641; Sir Nicholas Cole was sheriff of Newcastle in 1633, and mayor in 1640, 1641, and 1643. He defended the town against the Scots in the civil war, and for his loyalty to the royal cause he was imprisoned and fined. He married his first wife, Mary, second daughter of Sir Thomas Liddell, bt, of Ravensworth, on 28 September 1626 and left two sons, the eldest of whom was Sir Ralph Cole.<br>
<br>Sir Ralph Cole thus inherited the vast fortune of his ancestors, and spent the greater part of it on art and the patronage of artists. He reportedly took lessons in painting from Van Dyck, and is said to have retained several Italian painters in his service. He is described in a letter of 1677 as a &#145;very worthy ingeniouse gent: hee has furnished his house with incomparable Pictures of his drawing, and is very ingeniouse in making knives, guns, Pistols &amp;c: &amp; of a very courteouse behaviour&#146;  (Hake, 64). He painted portraits, subject pictures, and miniatures. A portrait of Thomas Wyndham is preserved at Petworth House, Sussex, and was engraved in mezzotint by Richard Tompson, <i>c</i>.1677, though the mezzotint more closely resembles a painting that was sold through Christies in 1948 and might be a self-portrait. Sir Ralph Cole also engraved a portrait of Charles II in mezzotint. His own portrait was painted by Sir Peter Lely, <i>c</i>.1675, and used to hang in Brancepeth Castle; it was engraved in mezzotint by his friend and brother dilettante Francis Place, <i>c</i>.1677. He was twice married: first, by 1651, to Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1657), daughter of Thomas Windham of Felbrigg, Norfolk, and widow of one Shouldham, and second to Catherine (<i>b</i>. 1637), daughter of Sir Henry Foulis, second baronet, of Ingleby Manor, Yorkshire; she died on 29 September 1704 and was buried at Brancepeth. He represented Durham city in parliament in 1675&#150;6 and 1678, and in 1685 commanded the Durham regiment of militia. In 1674 he sold Kepier, and in 1701 he sold Brancepeth to his friend Sir Henry Bellasyse. He died on 9 August 1704 and was buried at Brancepeth. Brancepeth Castle was still furnished with his paintings when John Loveday visited it in 1732; he mentioned in particular a portrait of Dean Sudbury by Sir Ralph Cole.<br>
<br>Cole had three sons, but he was succeeded by his grandson, Sir Nicholas Cole, third baronet. The family fortune having been considerably reduced, the fourth and last baronet, Sir Mark Cole, grandson of Sir Ralph, was buried at the expense of his cousin, Sir Ralph Milbanke, in 1720.<br>
