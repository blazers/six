<span class="headword">Spry, Sir  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1715, <em>d.</em> 1775), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, second son of George Spry (1685/6&#150;1732) of Place in Cornwall and his wife, Mary, daughter of Richard Bullock of Helston, was baptized at St Anthony in Roseland, Place, on 2 December 1715. He entered the navy in 1733 as a volunteer per order on the <i>Exeter</i>, and in the following year was appointed to the <i>Swallow</i>, in which he served for four years on the home station. He was afterwards for two years in the <i>Canterbury</i>, and passed his examination on 26 June 1740. On 27 September he was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Deptford Prize</i>, a small vessel employed in cruising and convoy service in the chops of the channel, until early in 1743, when he was appointed to the <i>Superbe</i>, which in October went out to the West Indies, bearing the broad pennant of Commodore Sir Charles Knowles. On 21 September 1744 he was promoted by Knowles to command the bomb <i>Comet</i> and sent to Boston to refit.<br>
<br>On 12 February 1745, as he was approaching Antigua on his way back, Spry fell in with a large Spanish privateer, the <i>Galga</i>, to which, after a stubborn action, he was forced to strike. The <i>Comet</i> was so completely disabled that the Spanish captain gave orders to remove her people and sink her. However, before this could be done, the approach of ships from English Harbour compelled the <i>Galga</i> to forsake her prize. The Spanish now fled but took Spry as a prisoner, landing him at Havana two months later. In June he was sent to Charlestown in a cartel, and in September he joined Rear-Admiral Peter Warren at Louisbourg; on 23 September Warren promoted him captain of his flagship, the <i>Superbe</i>.<br>
<br>In 1746 when Warren was succeeded by Commodore Knowles as governor of Cape Breton and went to Boston to co-ordinate plans for the proposed invasion of Canada, Spry was sent in the <i>Chester</i> to the Bay of Fundy to add to the defence of Annapolis Royal and to careen by making use of the bay's celebrated high tides. The arrival later that summer on the Nova Scotia coast of a large French naval force under d'Enville seemed at first to threaten Annapolis Royal. Owing to the distress endured by the French from sickness, their attempt was made too late in the season to get into the bay. Spry thereupon returned to England with Warren. In November 1747, still in the <i>Chester</i>, he went out to the East Indies with Edward Boscawen; here he took part in the siege of Pondicherry before returning to England in 1750.<br>
<br>In October 1753 Spry was appointed to the <i>Garland</i>, and in June 1754 to the <i>Gibraltar</i>, in which he went out to North America with Commodore Augustus Keppel. He was sent home in the following spring, and was immediately appointed to the <i>Fougueux</i>, one of the squadron sent out to North America with Boscawen. In the winter of 1755&#150;6 he was left senior officer at Halifax, where in October 1755, having received news that Sir Edward Hawke had begun seizing French shipping, he ordered his own squadron to do the same  (Spry to S. Hood, 21 Oct 1755, TNA: PRO, ADM 1/1890). The decision to winter several ships of the line in Halifax harbour initiated a new forward naval policy in the Gulf of St Lawrence. Having established a watering wharf on the future site of the naval yard, Spry had his ships cleaned at a hired commercial wharf, and sailed with his squadron on 18 May 1756, where off Louisbourg, Commodore Charles Holmes assumed command of the blockading force. Spry's arrival was too late to prevent both a large naval force getting into Louisbourg and a squadron with reinforcements for Quebec getting into the St Lawrence. Throughout the summer of 1756 he was with the squadron under Commodore Charles Holmes, blockading Louisbourg. In the same year he succeeded to the family estates in Cornwall on the death of his elder brother. In the following January he was moved into the <i>Orford</i>, in which he served on the coast of North America under Vice-Admiral Francis Holburne, at the reduction of Louisbourg by Boscawen in 1758, and in the operations in the St Lawrence under Vice-Admiral Charles Saunders in 1759. In 1760, and again in 1761, the <i>Orford</i> was one of the Grand Fleet in the Bay of Biscay under Boscawen or Hawke, and in November 1761 Spry was moved into the <i>Mars</i>, on the same station, where he stayed until August 1762, when he went out as commodore and commander-in-chief on the coast of North America. In Halifax Spry's most enduring indirect achievement arose from his suggestion to the Admiralty that a coastal survey of Nova Scotia be undertaken, a scheme begun under his successor, Alexander Colvill. He successfully recommended Joseph Frederick Wallet Des Barres, a Swiss-born engineering officer, who enjoyed a growing reputation in North America for his surveys.<br>
<br>In December 1763 Spry was appointed captain of the yacht <i>Fubbs</i>, and in April 1766 of the <i>Jersey</i>, in which in May he went out to the Mediterranean as commodore and commander-in-chief. He returned to England in November 1769. On 18 October 1770 he was promoted rear-admiral of the blue, and in 1772 he commanded a squadron in the channel. In 1773 he held a command in the fleet when the king reviewed it at Portsmouth, and on 24 June he was knighted. Spry became rear-admiral of the red on 31 March 1775; he died, unmarried, a few months later on 22 November 1775 at his home, Place House, and was buried in St Anthony's Church.<br>
