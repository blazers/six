<span class="headword">Cutler <span class="st"> [<em>married names </em>Greenleaf, Dudley Ward]</span>,  Kate Ellen Louisa</span>  (1864&#150;1955), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 14 August 1864 at 28 Queen's Road, Marylebone, London, the daughter of Henry Cutler, an artist and singer, and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tims. She is reported to have studied voice &#145;at the conservatoire in Watford&#146; and made her first known appearance on the stage with Horace Lingard's touring comic opera company in 1888, taking over, in turn, the principal <i>soubrette</i> part of Pepita (in Manchester) and then the <i>ing&eacute;nue</i> role of Inez (for London), the two girls who are candidates for the real princess in Charles Lecocq's <span class="italic">La princesse des Canaries</span>. She next appeared with the Carl Rosa Light Opera Company in the supporting role of Malaguena in Robert Planquette's <span class="italic">Paul Jones</span> (1889) before joining the company of George Edwardes's <span class="italic">In Town</span> and beginning a steady rise that would result in a career as the ultimate <i>ing&eacute;nue</i> of the Victorian and Edwardian musical theatre.<br>
<br>Kate Cutler was cast in <span class="italic">In Town</span> as a take-over to the small <i>ing&eacute;nue</i> role of Lady Gwendoline, but covered and deputized latterly for the show's star, Florence St John, and she fulfilled the same function in <span class="italic">A Gaiety Girl</span>, moving up from the small part of Lady Edytha Aldwyn to replace Decima Moore in the juvenile lead of the piece. She succeeded Ada Reeve, when that lady departed, soon after the opening night, in the title role of the Gaiety's highly successful <span class="italic">The Shop Girl</span> (1894) and then left the Edwardes organization to take over from Isa Bowman as Connie, the juvenile lady of <span class="italic">All Abroad</span> (1895).<br>
<br>In 1895 Kate Cutler created her own first good musical-comedy role, as Mabel Kavanagh, the <i>ing&eacute;nue</i> heroine&#151;alongside the rather more prominent <i>soubrette</i>, Kitty Loftus&#151;of the show starring Arthur Roberts, <span class="italic">Gentleman Joe</span>, and, in the wake of the craze awakened by Beerbohm Tree's production of <span class="italic">Trilby</span>, went on to play a burlesque Trilby in Nellie Farren's production of <span class="italic">A Model Trilby</span>. She returned to Edwardes's management the following year to create the juvenile lead, May Mildreth, in <span class="italic">The Clergyman's Daughter</span> out of town. When the piece was brought into the Gaiety, as <span class="italic">My Girl</span>, the role was given to Ellaline Terriss, and instead Miss Cutler appeared in town as Dorothy Travers in the less successful <span class="italic">Monte Carlo</span> (1896). She came into her own, however, when she was cast, for the piece's London showing, in the title role of Suzette in <span class="italic">The French Maid</span> (1897), created in the provinces by the genuinely French Andr&eacute;e Corday. Just how much she had risen in status was shown when she finally left the long-running show and was replaced by the same Kitty Loftus to whom she had played second fiddle in <span class="italic">Gentleman Joe</span>. She went on to score another big success in 1898 as Elsie Crockett in <span class="italic">Little Miss Nobody</span>. The following year she played Catarina in the operetta taken from the French <span class="italic">L'amour mouill&eacute;</span> and then found her most successful role of all as the <i>ing&eacute;nue</i>, Angela, in the original production of <span class="italic">Florodora</span>, in which she introduced &#145;The Fellow who Might&#146;.<br>
<br>Kate Cutler took on the unenviable task in 1900 of starring as Victoria Chaffers opposite the unpredictable, often inebriated Arthur Roberts in a London season of his touring show <span class="italic">HMS Irresponsible</span>&#151;this time ousting Kitty Loftus, who sued the producer and star (and lost)&#151;and took over the soprano role of Princess Soo-Soo in the record-breaking <span class="italic">A Chinese Honeymoon</span> (1901) when that piece, once its success became evident, began to be cast with star performers. In 1902 she created one of her most appealing roles, as Nora, the befuddled young bride of the classy musical comedy <span class="italic">The Girl from Kay's</span> (where she sang &#145;Papa&#146;), opposite the star comic Willie Edouin. <span class="italic">The Lovebirds</span> (1904, in which she played Grace Rockingham) gave her a rare experience of failure, but this was quickly remedied by a delightful star part as the Baroness Papouche in Edwardes's Gaiety Theatre musical <span class="italic">The Spring Chicken</span> (1905). By now over forty (though she claimed to have been born in 1870), she abandoned musicals and turned instead to the straight stage and to performing playlets and sketches in the music halls.<br>
<br>Over the next decade Kate Cutler was seen regularly in the West End in featured roles in plays, appearing with Tree in revivals of <span class="italic">The Red Lamp</span> (1907, Felise) and <span class="italic">A Woman of No Importance</span> (1907, Lady Stutfield), as the feather-headed little milliner, Madame Henriette, to the <span class="italic">Bellamy the Magnificent</span> of Charles Wyndham (1908), the seduced servant girl to <span class="italic">The Real Woman</span> of Evelyn Millard, and the pretty widow, Marion Nairn, alongside Charles Hawtrey in Somerset Maugham's <span class="italic">The Noble Spaniard</span> (1909). She played the would-be social Mrs Dallas-Baker, alongside Marie L&ouml;hr and Robert Loraine, in Somerset Maugham's <span class="italic">Smith</span> (1909) and Lydia Languish in Sheridan's <span class="italic">The Rivals</span> (1910) with Lewis Waller, took over from Ethel Irving in the leading role of <span class="italic">The Witness for the Defence</span> (1911), and performed in <span class="italic">The Ogre</span> (1911) and <span class="italic">The Fire Screen</span> (1912), then took a turn into the music halls, where she appeared alongside George Alexander in Max Beerbohm's <span class="italic">A Social Success</span> and in several other short plays.<br>
<br>Thereafter Kate Cutler moved towards playing mostly aristocratic and charming character roles and made brief returns to the musical stage as gracious older ladies such as Helen in <span class="italic">That's a Good Girl</span> (1928), Mrs Gerard in <span class="italic">Dear Love</span> (1929), and the Queen of Vassau in <span class="italic">Command Performance</span> (1933). In the 1930s she was still finding good parts in the London theatre: in 1936 she was seen as Old Lady Squeamish, alongside Michael Redgrave and Edith Evans, in <span class="italic">The Country Wife</span> at the Old Vic, and in 1938, half a century after her d&eacute;but, with another graduate of the musical-comedy stage, Marie Tempest, as Belle Schlessinger in <span class="italic">Dear Octopus</span>. She also appeared in several films, including the screen versions of <span class="italic">That's a Good Girl</span> (1933) and <span class="italic">Pygmalion</span> (1938).<br>
<br>Unfailingly graceful, ladylike, and charming (&#145;she always looks as if she has a sprig of lilac under her nose&#146;, reported her contemporary Emily Soldene), and the possessor of a pretty light soprano voice, the young Miss Cutler was, as a genuine and durable <i>ing&eacute;nue</i>, the ideal partner for some of the more rumbustious comedy actors of her time. As an older actress, although she rarely found new roles as important as those she had created on the musical stage, she kept up a full career with very few bald spots, thanks to her always-winning stage presence and demeanour. She married, on 12 April 1900, the director and choreographer Sidney Ellison (whose real name was George Greenleaf), the stager of <span class="italic">Florodora</span>, but they had separated before his death in 1930, and she subsequently married Major Charles Dudley Ward, who also predeceased her. She died at her home, 41 Onslow Square, London, on 14 May 1955, and was cremated at Putney Vale crematorium.<br>
