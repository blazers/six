<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dering, Sir  Edward</span>, first baronet  (1598&#150;1644), <span class="occ">antiquary and religious controversialist</span>, was born on 28 January 1598, and baptized on 9 February, the eldest son of Sir Anthony Dering (1557/8&#150;1636), landowner and JP, of Surrenden Dering in Pluckley, Kent, and his second wife, Frances (1577&#150;1657), daughter of Robert Bell. He was born in the Tower of London, where his father may have been acting as deputy for his mother's stepfather, who was lieutenant of the Tower. Dering was apparently educated at Westminster School, and was a fellow-commoner of Magdalene College, Cambridge, from January 1615 to September 1617 (typically for one of his social station, he did not proceed to a degree); he was admitted to the Middle Temple on 23 October 1617. He paid a very brief visit to Calais and Gravelines in 1620 and he visited a cousin in Ireland in 1621.<h2>
<a name="Aspiringcourtier1619c1635andlocalgovernorc16251640"></a>Aspiring courtier, 1619&#150;c.1635, and local governor, c.1625&#150;1640</h2>Dering's father enjoyed the patronage of his relative Edward, first Lord Wotton, and it may have been through friendship with the Wottons that Edward was introduced to the court: in January 1619, suggestively close to his twenty-first birthday, he was, as he recorded in one of his notebooks, &#145;knighted at Newmarket through the meanes and favor of the Marquesse of Buckingham&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Gough Kent 20, p. 4). His first marriage, on 25 November 1619, to Elizabeth (1602&#150;1622), daughter of a Kentish neighbour, Sir Nicholas Tufton, the future first earl of Thanet, may have strengthened his links with the court. Certainly Dering's second marriage, following his first wife's early death, to Anne Ashburnham (1604/5&#150;1628), is evidence both of his continued ambition and of his success in attaching himself directly to the circle around the duke of Buckingham. In the following year Dering paid the artist George Cottington (or Cuddington) &pound;25 to undertake two full-length and two three-quarter length portraits of himself, Elizabeth, and Anne, and of his brother Henry; at the same time Dering's father commissioned from Cottington a portrait of his grandson, Anthony, the son of Edward's first marriage. Cottington's portraits are lost and are thought to have been destroyed in a fire at Surrenden Dering in 1952, though photographic records remain. Dering's marriage to Anne Ashburnham took place on 1 January 1625 in Buckingham's lodgings at Whitehall; Anne's mother was a destitute widow, but she was related to the duke, and Dering accepted Anne without any marriage portion on the understanding that her mother would use her connections to his advantage. In May 1625 Dering travelled to Boulogne in the company of Buckingham's mother and elder brother, presumably in the hope of meeting Charles I's queen, whom the favourite was escorting from France, although Dering returned to England before the queen set sail.<br>
<br>In 1625 Dering was returned to parliament as a member for the Cinque Port of Hythe in Kent&#151;Buckingham had become lord warden of the Cinque Ports in 1624 and, although Dering was not Buckingham's nominee, his connections with the favourite were invoked on his behalf in the election; the backing of Buckingham and of other courtiers was obtained for Dering's unsuccessful attempts to find a parliamentary seat in 1626 and in 1628. On 1 February 1627 Dering became the fifth baronet to be created by Charles I, something in which his mother-in-law claimed to have been instrumental. It was also in early 1627 that Dering took the oath of a gentleman-extraordinary of the king's privy chamber. This was not a position of great importance, although it gave him access at court. The only office of potential profit that Dering obtained was the lieutenancy of Dover Castle in Kent, effectively the post of local deputy to the lord warden of the Cinque Ports, which had been held by a Dering in the early sixteenth century. Sir Edward enjoyed Buckingham's support in his efforts to gain the lieutenancy, although the favourite was killed while Dering was negotiating for the post and he had to pay the existing holder in order to obtain the office, which he finally entered in March 1629. In practice the lieutenancy proved both frustrating and unprofitable; although Dering continued to enjoy the support of courtiers, in particular the earl of Dorset after Buckingham's death, he was to claim in 1635 that he &#145;was never gratified or benefitted by anie of the greate friends and kindred&#146; of Anne Ashburnham's mother, as had been promised at the time of his marriage  (TNA: PRO, C2/Charles I/D.31/40). In 1634&#150;5 he left the lieutenancy; although he remained active in local government until 1640, he wrote in the mid-1630s that &#145;the circumference which a Statesman must fill, is a larger Orbe then my ambition doth stretch unto &hellip; so (beside proteccion generally due to all subjectes) I have no neede of the State&#146;  (Folger Shakespeare Library, V.b.307, p. 71). Dering's court connections fade into the background in the later 1630s; he declined a summons to attend the king at York during the first bishops' war and his name does not feature among the extraordinary gentlemen of the privy chamber listed in the household establishment of 1641, perhaps as a result of this.<br>
<br>Dering's motivation for the pursuit of office was probably in part financial: when he declared that he had &#145;no neede of the State&#146;, he added the rider that &#145;my fortunes are not now to make&#146;  (Folger Shakespeare Library, V.b.307, p. 71). Although his father had already transferred some of the family estate to him, he had been over &pound;1400 in debt in midsummer 1629, just after assuming the lieutenancy of Dover Castle. Following his second wife's death in 1628 he had again sought a profitable marriage, albeit this time by the more conventional means of courting a wealthy widow. The possibility of increasing his income from office may therefore have been important for Dering in 1628&#150;9. Indeed, it is less clear why he felt that his finances were more secure in the mid-1630s. When he did remarry, on 16 July 1629, it was to Unton Gibbes (<i>d</i>. 1676) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/93800/', "Dering, Unton")</script>], the daughter of a Warwickshire gentry family, who brought a portion of &pound;2000, but he appears to have inherited a debt of some &pound;3000 on his father's death in 1636, and net sales of land in 1636&#150;8 were necessary in order to reduce his debts to just over &pound;1000 by May 1638, although this situation did not prevent him rebuilding the family seat.<br>
<br>Even in the later 1620s, while pursuing his court career, Dering took his duties as a magistrate and as a militia officer seriously. His court connections had enabled him to succeed his father as a JP in 1626 while retaining his father's precedence on the bench. Dering became notorious in Kent for his zeal in response to the commissions issued in 1630&#150;31 to compound for failure to take up knighthood and he was said to have ensured the success of ship money in the county, probably as a result of his contributions at the initial rating meeting. Yet Dering was not undiscriminating in the implementation of central initiatives in the localities: for example, he appears to have connived at the Cinque Ports' petition for exemption from the knighthood compositions. Indeed, in his conduct as a magistrate and as lieutenant of Dover Castle there are signs of religious preoccupations which would also be evident in his later career as a member of the Long Parliament and the hope of promoting them may even have played a part in his pursuit of office. His anti-Catholicism is apparent in his activity as a JP while, as lieutenant, he sought to tighten the regulation of Roman Catholics passing to and from the continent. However, Sir Roger Twysden recalled that Dering had once wondered whether a &#145;Puritane&#146; (by which Dering probably meant separatist) was more likely to be saved than a &#145;papist&#146;  (BL, Stowe MS 184, fol. 10), and Dering's opposition to separatism is also evident both in his conduct as a JP and in his denunciation of separatists at Dover in his capacity as lieutenant.<h2>
<a name="Antiquarianismandtheologyc16251640"></a>Antiquarianism and theology, c.1625&#150;1640</h2>Another concern apparent in Dering's later career, his antiquarian interests, was also present in the later 1620s, and also interacted with his connections at court. It was by Buckingham's &#145;especiall favor&#146; that Dering obtained in 1627 a warrant authorizing him to consult public records without paying any fees  (CKS, U.1107, Z.3). It may have been envisaged that Dering would apply his antiquarian researches to political questions on Buckingham's behalf, in the way that, for example, Sir Robert Cotton had done on behalf of the earl of Northampton earlier in the century. Dering's extensive collections and compilations of records were concerned, however, with the more limited spheres of his county and his family. In 1638 Dering formed an association with three other antiquaries (William Dugdale, Sir Christopher Hatton, and Sir Thomas Shirley), called Antiquitas Rediviva; the members were to collect &#145;all memorable notes for historicall illustration of this kingdome&#146;, but &#145;especially&#146; those concerning the four counties in which they resided  (Larking, &#145;Antiquaries&#146;, 5). However, the only connected historical writings to survive from the 1630s are drafts of the preface to, and of some early entries in, a history of the Dering family. Dugdale described Dering as &#145;an excellent Antiquarye&#146;  (Wright, 373); in recognizing the importance of mastering Old English, Dering was in tune with leading scholars of his generation. Yet he also adjusted names on documents in his collection in order to support his claims for the antiquity and importance of his family; Dering may have seen himself as reconstructing what must once have existed, for he alleged that an antiquary employed by his father had stolen many family records.<br>
<br>Dering had other interests in the mid-1630s: apart from his rebuilding of Surrenden Dering, he interested himself in garden design and he apparently remained interested in drama (he had earlier produced a shortened version of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Henry IV</span> for private performance). However, according to his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37354/', "Sir Edward Dering")</script>, Dering &#145;wholly addicted himself&#146; to &#145;the study of Divinity&#146; from the late 1630s onward  (CKS, U.1107, Z.3). He became involved in 1639&#150;40 in controversy with the Carmelite Thomas Doughty (Father Simon Stock), at least in part as a result of attempts to convert Roman Catholic acquaintances, one of them a recent convert. Two of Dering's polemical works were later published (<span class="italic">The Foure Cardinall-Vertues of a Carmelite-Fryar</span>, 1641; <span class="italic">A Discourse of Proper Sacrifice</span>, 1644). Dering made some use of his knowledge of English history to expose the novelty of papist doctrines, although this was far from being the principal source for his arguments, in which the church fathers figured largely. He appears to have come to believe, in the course of his theological researches, that Church of England divines such as Peter Heylyn and John Pocklington were expounding views that were indistinguishable from popery, especially on the sacrament of the eucharist; the publication with official sanction of &#145;Libelling Pamphlets against true Religion&#146; would become a major plank of Dering's argument against the ecclesiastical hierarchy in the Long Parliament  (Dering, <span class="italic">Speeches</span>, 13).<br>
<br>Dering wrote, with regard to the Short Parliament election in the spring of 1640, that &#145;in times so desperate I would contribute no help to any privy councillor or deputy lieutenant&#146;  (Jessup, 2). There can be little doubt that Dering's perception of popish tendencies in the church contributed to this conviction and fed, in turn, into his dogged pursuit of one of the seats for Kent in both of the 1640 elections, unsuccessfully in the spring but successfully in the election for the Long Parliament. In the spring he pursued the parliamentary seat despite warnings that his opposition to the privy councillor Sir Henry Vane was badly taken at court; his wife was able to remind him that his candidature for the Long Parliament had been &#145;only assumed for God's Glory&#146;  (CKS, U.350, C.2/82).<h2>
<a name="TheLongParliamentandthechurch16401642"></a>The Long Parliament and the church, 1640&#150;1642</h2>Dering's election to the Long Parliament opened the most conspicuous phase of his career; as Dering himself later put it, his first speech, which presented the petition of a deprived Kentish minister and denounced Archbishop Laud as the &#145;Center&#146; of &#145;our miseries&#146;  (Dering, <span class="italic">Speeches</span>, 11), &#145;did beget me &hellip; many new friends&#146;  (ibid., 162). His speech on 23 November 1640 complaining of the authorization of crypto-popish publications was followed by his nomination to the chair of a subcommittee (later a committee in its own right) to deal with ministers' grievances and the licensing of books. Numerous manuscript copies of his early speeches survive, and some were published as &#145;separates&#146;, before Dering produced his own editions. Even a hostile contemporary admired Dering's oratory and he appears by May 1641 to have become an important member of the Commons. In addition to his speeches on ecclesiastical matters he made several procedural motions, including an important and successful one in May 1641 for a committee to determine what matters should be brought to a conclusion before the recess. It is not surprising, therefore, that Sir Arthur Hesilrige placed the root and branch bill for the abolition of episcopacy in Dering's hands on 27 May 1641, prompting Dering to introduce the bill.<br>
<br>However, the alliance between Dering and the leading supporters of root and branch proved short-lived. On 21 June, Dering launched a scheme to replace the existing bishops with a new structure under which the ecclesiastical affairs of each shire would be managed by a presbytery, in each of which a &#145;moderatour&#146; or &#145;President&#146; would be established (Bodl. Oxf., Rawlinson MS D1099, fol. 80<i>v</i>; BL, Harley MS 5047, fol. 30). Although he was almost certainly propounding the &#145;constant presidents&#146; whom he would describe as bishops when he published the speech in 1642, contemporary diarists did not interpret the speech as a plea for episcopacy, and Dering would claim in 1642 that his intention had been to encourage the &#145;rooters&#146; and the would-be reformers of episcopacy to coalesce around a model of what would replace the existing hierarchy. However, if this was his intention, he was unsuccessful; the question of what would replace the existing hierarchy was postponed in favour of a plan to put ecclesiastical government into the hands of interim commissioners.<br>
<br>Dering left the Commons in early August and did not return until after the recess. The reasons for this absence may well not have been political: attendance at Westminster kept him away from his estates, from his library, and from his wife, to whom he complained that he might not have patience to sit the session out as early as May 1641. What is certain is that after the recess Dering adopted an openly partisan position. On 21 October 1641 he impugned the force of the orders that the Commons had issued on religious matters prior to the recess. He was aware of feeling in Kent on this issue, but he probably realized that his speech would touch a raw nerve in some quarters: Henry Marten suggested that Dering should withdraw while the offence given by his remarks was considered. In November, Dering attacked the content of the grand remonstrance and, indeed, the very principle of a document addressed by the Commons to the people rather than to the king. Furthermore, in January 1642 he took the step of publishing a collection of his speeches in the Long Parliament, in vindication of his own conduct, but also as a condemnation of the factionalism of others. While bemoaning others' partisanship, he depicted his opponents in the blackest of terms: he alleged that one member of the Commons had told him privately that he wished to &#145;bring the Lords down into our House&#146;  (Dering, <span class="italic">Speeches</span>, 166). Dering spoke as the voice of &#145;moderation&#146;  (ibid.), but his political tactics were far from moderate. The result was, on 2 February 1642, the condemnation of Dering's published speeches, which were ordered by the Commons to be burnt by the common hangman, and his own expulsion from the Commons; on a division he was sent to the Tower, where he remained until discharged on his own petition on 11 February.<br>
<br>Dering's opposition to the grand remonstrance brought him into line with future royalists such as John Colepeper, Edward Hyde, and Lucius Cary, Viscount Falkland, with whom he had disagreed on ecclesiastical matters before the recess, but his views on episcopacy still did not accord with theirs. By January 1642 Dering was certainly using the word &#145;bishop&#146; to describe the &#145;constant presidents&#146; he favoured, and he had slightly softened some of the presbyterian aspects of his proposals; his views on the relative roles of the laity and of the clergy in determining religious matters had shifted somewhat in favour of the clergy. However, he was still propounding the extirpation of the existing bishops and their replacement by county-based sees in which bishops would be assisted by presbyteries. According to one critic, Dering was no better than a presbyterian. Indeed, Dering may have felt himself to be isolated in the Commons: he was nominated to barely any committees in November and December 1641. This may explain his decision to make an appeal to opinion outside the house by publishing his speeches, thus doing exactly what he had condemned in the grand remonstrance.<br>
<br>The part that Dering took in the drafting of the Kentish petition of March 1642 perhaps reflects a realization that to have an impact politically he would have to identify more closely with the more conservative defenders of episcopacy. He now became involved with a petition that asked, not that episcopacy should be uprooted and replanted, but merely that it should be &#145;preserved&#146;. The petition's assertive defence of the prayer book&#151;&#145;celebrious by the Piety of holy Bishops and Martyrs who composed it&#146;&#151;contrasts with Dering's sponsorship in late 1641 of a petition which, while defending the prayer book, had entertained its &#145;severe Reformation&#146; (Woods, 141&#150;2; Larking, <span class="italic">Proceedings</span>, 61). Contemporaries described the March 1642 petition as Dering's, although they probably exaggerated his importance in its making on account of his existing notoriety. None the less his involvement with this petition identified him with the royalist side of (and, indeed, exacerbated) the paper war being conducted between the king and his advisers on the one hand, and the two houses at Westminster on the other. Furthermore, by linking together the question of ecclesiastical government and the dispute over control of the militia, the petition reflects a process (first apparent in Dering's condemnation of the Commons' orders on religious questions) by which, in order to defend his ecclesiastical ideals, Dering adopted constitutional positions at variance with the majority in the Commons. It was on these constitutional positions, rather than on ecclesiastical matters, that the Commons dwelt in the impeachment drawn up against Dering in April 1642.<br>
<br>Dering was, therefore, as contemporaries argued, inconsistent. Yet underlying his shifting proposals for church government was surely his desire to see proper order restored to the church as soon as possible: he had written in May 1641 of &#145;the necessity of composing the state and church in those things wherein [the Commons] had (upon just groundes) disjoynted them&#146;  (Larking, <span class="italic">Proceedings</span>, 47). In part this &#145;necessity of composing&#146; resulted from the radicalism apparent both in London and in Kent following the collapse of ecclesiastical authority in 1640&#150;41. However, Dering did show throughout his career a concern for a uniform church with a set liturgy: as has been seen, he had opposed separatism in Kent prior to 1640 and he had also seen the Church of England's &#145;devout and pious&#146; liturgy as a point in its favour when combating popery  (CKS, U.2479, Z.1); in 1640 he removed attacks on the liturgy from the Kentish petition against episcopacy before presenting it to the Commons; though he supported, in 1641, reform of the prayer book, he could still, in his <span class="italic">Collection of Speeches</span>, praise Laud's &#145;intent of publike uniformity&#146;, while accepting that &#145;in the way of his pursuit thereof he was extreamely faulty&#146;  (p. 4). The retention of a set liturgy was more important to Dering than the precise nature of ecclesiastical government; no form of government had a <i>jure divino</i> claim, he argued, and, in proposing the root and branch bill, he argued that it was necessary because the hierarchy was incapable of reform (not because it was essential, on principle, to return the church to a primitive state)&#151;indeed, his later claim that his chief purpose in introducing the bill was to expedite the bill against the bishops' secular jurisdiction may have some foundation.<br>
<br>By early 1642 Dering appears to have had little confidence in the parliamentary leaders' ability to establish a speedy settlement in the church, or even in the sincerity of their professions on the matter, studiedly moderate though these were in late 1641 and early 1642. In forming this judgement he may have been influenced by his involvement in the unsuccessful attempt to condemn Henry Burton's radical <span class="italic">Protestation Protested</span>, which was reportedly blocked in committee by a number of leading supporters of root and branch. In contrast, Dering was aware that his views were finding a ready ear at court, through the agency of one of his Ashburnham relatives; a copy of his collected speeches was given to the king, who was reported to have smiled at the preface and conclusion of the work. In such a context the king's efforts in late 1641 and early 1642 to claim the middle ground by dissociating himself from the religious policies of the 1630s must have seemed convincing to Dering. Dering could see no grounds for the fear of popish plotting which both energized and held together the parliamentary leadership in late 1641 and early 1642: as the Commons took measures to defend themselves in January 1642, following the attempted arrest of the five members, Dering complained that they had voted a guard &#145;against no enemy&#146;; he thought that the king intended &#145;to pursue the five gentlemen in a legal way&#146;  (Larking, <span class="italic">Proceedings</span>, 69, xliii).<h2>
<a name="Summer1642June1644"></a>Summer 1642 &#150; June 1644</h2>Following the affair of the Kentish petition in March 1642, Dering was summoned before the Commons but slipped away and returned to Kent. Unsurprisingly after his role in the March petition, he was placed by the king on the commission of array for Kent, and his later claim that his move toward active royalism was reluctant may be called into question by reports that he had undertaken a &#145;circuit&#146; to raise support for it  (N. Payne, <span class="italic">A True Relation of a Brave Exploit Performed by Captain Richard Dawks</span>, 1642, 7). Both Dering and his eldest son were with the king when the royal standard was raised at Nottingham. None the less, Dering sought a rapprochement with the two houses at Westminster in October 1642: a &#145;Mr P.&#146; (who may have been Pym, but was perhaps Purefoy) was said to be &#145;much joyed&#146; by Dering's approaches  (CKS, U.350, C.2/99), but the existence of earlier votes of delinquency against Dering was deemed to necessitate some formal submission from him, and perhaps he baulked at making this. None the less, it was apparently only in July 1643 that Dering was commissioned to raise a regiment for the king and, if a later account is to be trusted, he resigned his commission the following November. Military activity may have been less uncongenial to him than has been supposed, as there are signs that he had been an enthusiastic militia officer in the 1620s, and he had his portrait painted in armour against a military background, probably in the 1630s; but allegations that he encouraged a royalist drive towards Kent, promising a rising in the county in response, should probably be treated with caution.<br>
<br>The circumstances of Dering's final defection from royalism at the beginning of 1644 are confused. He was widely reported to be among the royalists besieged from December 1643 to January 1644 in Arundel Castle, but he escaped before the castle fell and appears to have returned to the court at Oxford. Newsletters reported that articles were being drawn up against him there, but Dering himself alleged that he was thought at Oxford to be the least likely person to defect. What is certain is that Dering had contacts who gave him advance notice of the declaration of both kingdoms; on 7 February he became the first person to petition the Commons at Westminster for a pardon according to its terms.<br>
<br>Dering's petition exists in two somewhat differing printed versions, one of them published with some additional remarks at the behest of the Kent county committee, which insisted that Dering produce it to &#145;satisfie the vulger&#146; whom he had &#145;misled&#146;  (BL, Stowe MS 184, fol. 73). The explanations of Dering's decision to make his peace with the parliament which these publications contained related partly to recent events: he claimed, for example, that he was scandalized by the king's attempt to assemble a parliament at Oxford; he also pointed to the &#145;cessation&#146; in September 1643 between the king and the Irish rebels, explaining that the popish plot was now &#145;explicited unto me&#146;  (Dering, <span class="italic">Declaration</span>, 8, 9). Experience of religious services at Oxford may explain the complaints that he subjoined to the petition, which are not anticipated in his earlier writings, about the excessive use of music in church services, although the very general terms in which he denounced the royalist clergy's love of &#145;externall pomp&#146;  (ibid., 11) contrast somewhat with his more discriminating treatment of ceremonial matters in 1642; Dering's tone in 1644 was probably somewhat adapted to his parliamentarian audience. Yet continuity with his earlier views is definitely apparent in his complaint against the continuing attachment of some clergy around the king to hierarchy. In 1641 Dering had found that he had common ground with the &#145;rooters&#146; in his desire to remove the existing hierarchy, but that this common ground was insufficient to sustain agreement on how the church should be rebuilt; by the end of 1643 he had discovered, it appears, that the common ground of support for liturgy and episcopacy (broadly understood) was insufficient to enable him to live in the royalist camp.<br>
<br>Yet Dering's writings in 1644 were not simply a denunciation of the royalists. There was a warning for the houses at Westminster that if the conflict were continued it might end in military tyranny. Dering's insistence that the king should return to London, but that this should be arranged in a way that would be honourable to the king, may also have contained an implied call for greater moderation at Westminster. Indeed, hostile observers said that Dering had left Oxford simply because the king had refused to give him office. They were probably right that Dering's departure from Oxford is not to be explained simply in ideological terms. As on previous occasions in his career, separation from his wife and family may have been a factor in his behaviour, especially as Dering was already in pain from an &#145;imposthume in his head&#146; (possibly a brain tumour), which proved fatal on 22 June 1644  (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 109).<br>
<br>Dering had spent the preceding months in conflict with the county committee over the sequestration of his estate. According to tradition he died in extreme poverty on a farmhouse on his estate; his correspondence in his last months certainly alleges poverty, but is dated from Surrenden Dering, and presumably he died there. He appears to have died intestate (although his widow alleged that a will had been concealed); he was buried in St Nicholas's Church, Pluckley. His fine was finally fixed by the Commons on 27 July and his heir, Edward, was able to obtain the remission of the fine and the discharge of the estate in the following month. Edward was a child of Dering's second marriage, a son of Elizabeth Tufton's having died in 1634. However, Dering's third marriage, to Unton Gibbes, had been one of great mutual affection (he once called her &#145;my most comfortable Numpes&#146;  (Larking, <span class="italic">Proceedings</span>, 55); Dering had settled on her a life interest in the family seat and made generous provision for the sons born of his marriage to her.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>Dering's final defection to the protection of the parliament ensured that he was harshly treated by royalist writers: Clarendon called him &#145;a man of levity and vanity&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 1.314). The incumbent at Pluckley, during a dispute with Dering in the 1630s, allegedly called him &#145;the proudest man in the world&#146;  (CKS, U.350, Q.1). Yet such judgements, especially those made in the light of Dering's &#145;defections&#146; in 1641&#150;2 and 1644, should not obscure the extent of Dering's reputation in mid-1641; in May he wrote to his wife of being shaken by the hand by &#145;many &hellip; whom I knew not; many said to one another &#147;There goes Sir Edward Dering&#148;&#146;  (Larking, <span class="italic">Proceedings</span>, 47&#150;8). Furthermore, even at the end of his career some parliamentarian writers thought it worth trying to rehabilitate his reputation, in order to claim the defection of a man of &#145;singular Wit and Learning&#146;, as evidence of the frustration felt by the &#145;moderate partie about the King&#146; (<span class="italic">Mercurius Anglicus</span>, 1, 31 Jan&#150;7 Feb 1644, 5; <span class="italic">A Declaration wherein is Full Satisfaction Given Concerning Sir Edward Deering</span>, 1644, sig. A2<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Recent writers have emphasized Dering's connections with Kentish opinion, seeing him as driven by &#145;service to the county and its desire for moderation&#146; (A. Everitt, <span class="italic">The Community of Kent and the Great Rebellion, 1640&#150;60</span>, 1966, 207; cf. Hirst). Yet what is perhaps most striking about Dering's career is the range of his connections and interests; thanks to his concern to record (and often to justify) his own life, and the survival of so many of his papers, it is possible to trace not only Dering's relationships with the gentry and clergy of Kent, but also how those relationships intermeshed with his theological and antiquarian researches, and with his links to the court. Dering's career&#151;eccentric though its particular course may have been&#151;can therefore provide useful insights into the world of the early and mid-seventeenth-century political &eacute;lite.<br>
