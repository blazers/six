<span class="headword">Foulston,  John</span>  (1772&#150;1841), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was a pupil of Thomas Hardwick and set up practice in London in 1796. In 1811 he won the competition for a complex of buildings in Plymouth consisting of a hotel, assembly rooms, and theatre. His success with this important commission established his local reputation, and he moved to Plymouth, where he remained for twenty-five years the leading architect of the neighbourhood. So much of Foulston's work has been lost that it is difficult to appreciate its impact, but with the backing of the ambitious mayor Edmund Lockyer he extensively transformed both Plymouth itself and its satellite towns of Stonehouse and Devonport. He was active not only as an architect, designing a further series of public buildings, stucco-faced terraces in the London manner, and attractive suburban villas, but also as a town planner, responsible for the creation of Union Street, a bold stroke of planning which united the three towns.<br>
<br>Most of Foulston's work was in the Greek revival style&#151;which it was his role almost single-handedly to propagate in the area&#151;but his best-known project was the extraordinary group of buildings erected at Ker Street, Devonport, in 1821&#150;4, an extreme example of the picturesque stylistic eclecticism of the early nineteenth century. It consisted of a Greek Doric town hall and commemorative column, a terrace of houses in the Roman Corinthian order and a pair in the Greek Ionic, a &#145;Hindoo&#146; nonconformist chapel, and an &#145;Egyptian&#146; library. (The chapel and the houses have been demolished.) Foulston wrote of himself that, in designing this group:<blockquote>it occurred to him that if a series of edifices, exhibiting the various features of the architectural world, were erected in conjunction, and skilfully grouped, a happy result might be obtained. Under this impression, he was induced to try an experiment (not before attempted) for producing a picturesque effect. (J. Foulston, <span class="italic">The Public Buildings, Erected in the West of England, as Designed by John Foulston, F.R.I.B.A.</span>, 1838, 3)</blockquote>In a number of his other works, notably the proprietary library (1812; des. 1941) and St Catherine's Church (1823; dem. 1958) in Plymouth and the ballroom in Torquay (1830; dem.), the influence of Sir John Soane was strongly apparent; while his few Gothic projects, although more conventional, included a restoration in 1829 of the medieval abbey gatehouse in Tavistock. His theatre in Plymouth (dem. 1939&#150;41) was notable for its extensive early use of cast iron.<br>
<br>Shortly before he retired Foulston took into partnership the architect George Wightwick, who succeeded to his practice. In his latter years he created an elaborate water garden at the <i>cottage orn&eacute;</i> he had built for himself on the outskirts of Plymouth, and was wont to drive round the streets of the town in a gig disguised as a Roman war chariot, looking, in Wightwick's words &#145;(as far as his true English face and costume allowed) like Ictinus of the Parthenon, &#147;out for a lark&#148;&#146;  (G. Wightwick, &#145;The life of an architect&#146;, <span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span>, 42, 1857, 297).<br>
<br>In his retirement Foulston made a set of nineteen watercolour drawings of his buildings which is now in the City Art Gallery at Plymouth. His pupils were Michael Angelo Nicholson, E. W. Gribble, C. E. Lang, and T. J. Ricauti. In 1838 he became a fellow of the Institute of British Architects. He died at his home in Plymouth on 30 December 1841 and was buried in St Andrew's new cemetery, Plymouth.<br>
