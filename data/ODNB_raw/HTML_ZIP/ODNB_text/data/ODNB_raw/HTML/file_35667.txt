<span class="headword">MacIver,  David  Randall-</span>  (1873&#150;1945), <span class="occ">archaeologist and anthropologist</span>, was born in London on 31 October 1873, the only son of John MacIver (<i>d</i>. 1875), shipowner, and his wife, Eliza Mary Rutherford. His father died a young man and his mother later married Richard Randall, barrister, whose name MacIver added to his own. He was educated at Radley College and was elected a scholar of Queen's College, Oxford, where he obtained a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1896.<br>
<br>While at Oxford MacIver also found time to investigate the subject of anthropology, and was much influenced by E. B. Tylor. His first ambition was to follow up this interest by work in Yucat&aacute;n. This project, however, came to nothing and instead, having obtained an introduction to Flinders Petrie, he went to Egypt. From 1899 to 1901 he excavated at Abydos for the Egypt Exploration Fund (later Society), and from 1900 to 1906 he was Laycock student of Egyptology at Worcester College, Oxford. In Egypt he included measuring skulls among the other duties of an excavator and thus added a new and highly important item to the essential data to be compiled by a field worker. He undertook an anthropometrical study of this craniological material under the supervision of the anatomist Arthur Thomson. Their results were published as <span class="italic">The Ancient Races of the Thebaid</span> (1905). His many excavations during these years, and his able and prompt publication of reports on these early works, were of invaluable use to his successors in the field. Many of the major names in Egyptology in the first half of the twentieth century owed much to his pioneering work.<br>
<br>In 1905 Randall-MacIver went to Rhodesia at the invitation of the British Association and the Rhodes Trustees to excavate at Zimbabwe and other sites. Although much had been written about the immense antiquity of these ruins, MacIver was able to suggest in his book <span class="italic">Mediaeval Rhodesia</span> (1906; repr., 1971) a revised date of <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 1200 to 1500 (subsequently extended back to <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 1000 by others). In 1907 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.<br>
<br>After his Laycock studentship expired, Randall-MacIver, assisted by C. L. Woolley, directed (1907&#150;11) an archaeological expedition in Nubia for the University Museum in Philadelphia, funded by a coal magnate, E. B. Coxe jun. His <span class="italic">Areika</span> (1909) described the Meroitic civilization of the black nations to the south of Egypt during the period of the Roman empire. In 1911 he married Joanna (<i>d</i>. 1931), daughter of W. H. Davidge, of New York, whom he had met through the Coxe family. In the same year he became librarian of the American Geographical Society, but in 1914, on the outbreak of the First World War in Europe, he returned immediately to England and served on the intelligence staff in both France and Macedonia.<br>
<br>After the war Randall-MacIver settled in Rome and this period was perhaps the most fruitful in his long and varied career. His publication of <span class="italic">Villanovans and Early Etruscans</span> (1924), which was produced during these years and which was perhaps his main achievement, was at the time an essential source for any student on the subject. To this period also belong other well-known books on Italian archaeology including <span class="italic">The Iron Age in Italy</span> (1927), <span class="italic">Italy before the Romans</span> (1928), and <span class="italic">Greek Cities in Italy and Sicily</span> (1931). Following his wife's death he continued to live in Rome, making visits to Rhodes, Syria, Cyprus, and the Balearic Islands, spending summers in the USA. In 1936 he married Mabel, daughter of Edward S. Holden, of St Louis, USA, and widow of George Tuttle, of New York.<br>
<br>In 1938 Randall-MacIver was elected FBA, an honour which greatly pleased him. He was in the United States on the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 and although unable to take an active part in the war he nevertheless found activities of a quieter kind to employ his wide experience. Among these was his invaluable assistance to those charged by the United States war department with listing Italian monuments to be protected from destruction.<br>
<br>In the archaeological world Randall-MacIver was a much beloved and fascinating figure. His appearance throughout his life was extremely striking for he was very tall with bright blue eyes and wavy fair hair; to this was added a smiling sparkling charm of speech which gave a peculiar interest to everything he said and served to kindle in others his own unfailing enthusiasm and optimism. He was a worker with very high standards and he expected others to hold equal standards. Although he was intolerant of slipshod work or thought in any form, and never hesitated to denounce such weaknesses when he found them, he was also full of encouragement and interest in the efforts of others, and always ready to do anything within his power to help young students on the threshold of their own careers.<br>
<br>Randall-MacIver was always exceedingly proud of his highland origin. He was a complete stranger to any form of narrow nationalism and spent his life with equal serenity in England, Italy, or America. He died on 30 April 1945 at his residence in New York. His second wife survived him, but both marriages were childless.<br>
