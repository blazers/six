<span class="headword">Collinges,  John</span>  (1623/4&#150;1691), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born at Boxted, Essex, the son of Edward Collinges, a minister. Educated at the neighbouring grammar school of Dedham, he was influenced by the puritan clergyman John Rogers and his successor, Matthew Newcomen. His father died when he was fifteen, leaving &#145;little above &pound;50 a year to maintain my Mother, and self and two sisters young and sickly&#146;  (Collinges, <span class="italic">New Lesson</span>, 9), but John was allowed to complete his schooling. On 9 April 1639 he was admitted as a sizar at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, &#145;where I lived, though in no height, yet in no want, by the favour of my learned tutor&#146;. Collinges was a diligent student, graduating BA in 1643, but fell &#145;into the temptations of those sinful times&#146; and acquired &#145;a hatred of holiness&#146;  (ibid., 10). The sharp disapproval of Newcomen helped him towards a different path. He proceeded BD in 1653 and DD in 1658.<br>
<br>Before 18 October 1645 Collinges became a chaplain to the family of Isaac Wyncoll of Bures, Essex, whose eldest daughter, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1692), he later married. They had at least one son and two daughters. In 1645 he was also installed as rector of Alphamstone, Essex, in the place of Rowland Steward, accused in March 1644 of gambling, drunkenness, and adultery. The living, according to a terrier of 1637, comprised a parsonage house, barn, stable, and more than 20 acres. In 1646 Collinges moved to Norwich and became vicar of St Saviour's and also of St Augustine. The sequestered minister of the latter, Joseph Reading, returned in an effort to unseat him but on 1 December 1646 the committee for plundered ministers ordered Collinges to continue in both parishes. Already in September 1646 Collinges had been invited by Sir John Hobart of Chapelfield House, Blickling, &#145;to take my chamber in his house whilst I discharged my ministerial office in the county, and to take some oversight of his family as to the things of God&#146;  (Collinges, <span class="italic">Par nobile</span>, 21). Soon after her husband's death in 1647 Frances, Lady Hobart:<blockquote>converted some less useful lower rooms of her house into a chapel which was conveniently capacious of more than 200 persons. Here she obliged me at first to preach a lecture every week, and to repeat one or both of my sermons every Lords Day at night, after the more publick sermons were finished in the Town. (ibid.)</blockquote>Collinges was a signatory of the attestation of Norfolk ministers in 1648, and was selected by Norwich corporation to read the afternoon sermon on the day of thanksgiving appointed after the royalist riot in the city in May 1648. On 2 February 1650 he was named by the committee of plundered ministers to serve the parish of St Stephen, Norwich, where on 21 June 1654 he was formally admitted as vicar; also in 1654, he was appointed assistant to the Norfolk commission into the ministry. Collinges was a prolific controversialist. His opponents included Theophilus Brabourne, and those such as William Sheppard who advocated lay preaching. On church organization he had firm views: &#145;I believe Presbyterian Government will be in credit at the great day (when Christ shall have trod all his enemies under his feet) yet from my soul I wish that all God's people had one heart and one way&#146;  (Collinges, <span class="italic">New Lesson</span>, 11). And, &#145;if the Devil were aske a courtesie of a state, he should aske no more than 1) An universall toleration, and 2) an uncontrouled liberty for every one to preach and expound scriptures&#146;  (Collinges, <span class="italic">Responsoria ad erratica pastoris</span>, 1652, 37). On 28 November 1660 the Commons rejected a bill which would have curtailed episcopal power and allowed some latitude in the forms of worship; Collinges later recalled this as disastrous:<blockquote>Whether the wisdom of his Majesty, or that party of the House of Commons who then opposed the passing of it into an Act, were greater let the experience now of twenty years more determine, which for the most part have been years of confusion and disorder as to matters of religion. (Cliffe, 42)</blockquote>On 26 April 1661 Collinges was licensed to continue preaching at St Stephen's, and he served in that year as a commissioner at the Savoy conference, which sought to amend the prayer book in a direction acceptable to moderate dissent. In 1661&#150;2 he was involved in a law suit against the dean and chapter of Norwich, patrons of St Stephen's, for recovery of a yearly pension of 53<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. Collinges was ejected with the other dissenting ministers in August 1662. Shortly afterwards Chapelfield House was searched by the authorities. The lord lieutenant, Horatio, Lord Townshend, felt obliged to apologize for the intrusion, but warned against allowing &#145;any scandalous number to meet&#146;  (Cliffe, 111); after the death of Lady Hobart in November 1664 Collinges wrote an affectionate account of her life and virtues. He maintained close links with the family and was described in 1688 as chaplain to Sir Henry Hobart, Sir John Hobart's son. In 1669 Collinges was reported to be preaching, with Benjamin Snowden, to &#145;about 300 Presbyterians and Independents at the house of John Barnham, hosier&#146; in the parish of St John Maddermarket, Norwich. On 30 April 1672 he was licensed as a presbyterian teacher at John Wilson's house in St Stephen's, and on 14 May Norwich corporation leased to his congregation the East Granary behind St Andrew's Hall. At Easter 1674 Collinges was presented by churchwardens of St Laurence for not receiving the sacrament.<br>
<br>Collinges played a notable role in the civic struggle of 1678&#150;81 in Norwich, when local and national politics collided. Robert Paston (Viscount Yarmouth), lord lieutenant of Norfolk, was determined to make the city an Anglican royalist stronghold and had obtained Bishop Sparrow's assurance that proceedings against Collinges would follow a by-election of February 1678. No action was taken, however, until in July 1678 rumours circulated of a plot on Bishop Sparrow's life; on the orders of Yarmouth the mayor arrested the suspects, who included Collinges. They were obliged to give security of &pound;500 each for good behaviour, and appear at the next quarter sessions. In a letter of 22 July 1678 Yarmouth reported that &#145;Dr. Collinges, a man long famous in that country for his ill-affections to the Crown&#146; was &#145;under a process for nonconformity and preaching in conventicles&#146;. But the chancellor of the diocese of Norwich was sent &#145;a minatory letter from an unknown hand to desist in the prosecution&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>March&#150;December 1678</i>, 306) and the justices summoned to the quarter sessions conspicuously failed to attend. The tories won all three general elections of 1679&#150;81 and controlled the court of aldermen and the Norwich assembly; but the recorder of Norwich, Francis Bacon, &#145;refused to assist Mayor Davey in investigating the case against John Collins&#146;  (Evans, 271). Collinges continued in his ministry. One tory described him in 1682 as &#145;a man of some learning, which he employs in promoting Presbytery, and, were he removed, tis probable many of that sect would fall off&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1682</i>, 54). His survival probably owed something to Sir John Hobart, the cousin and heir of his former patron, now a leader of the anti-court party in Norwich.<br>
<br>In 1685 Collinges was twice arrested as a &#145;non juring suspect&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lothian MSS</span>, xii), but then seems to have lived quietly until James II issued his declaration of indulgence of which Collinges took full advantage. On 14 April 1687 the bishop of Norwich wrote scathingly:<blockquote>Dr. Collins who not long since sent me wonderfull submissive letters is now grown very pert and pragmatical, and tells some of the Clergy of this City, that now he stands upon a levell with them, and well remembers the horrid persecutions of the saints, and that he had rather owne the kindness of the indulgence then submitt to the unreasonable Terms of the Church of England.</blockquote>He concluded dismissively that Collinges was &#145;made up of spleene and choler and is not much to be regarded&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>). In 1689 a new meeting-place, certified on 19 July, was built for Collinges and his congregation in the parish of St John Colegate, and in the winter of 1689&#150;90 his salary was given as &pound;56 a year. His last days were spent in implementing the union of presbyterians and congregationalists. He died at Walcott, Norfolk, on 17 January 1691, aged sixty-seven, and was buried there on 20 January; his funeral sermon was preached by Martin Fynch. His wife, Elizabeth, died the following year.<br>
