</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Palles,  Christopher</span>  (1831&#150;1920), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at 5 Lower Gardiner Street, Dublin, on 25 December 1831, the third son of Andrew Christopher Palles, a Dublin solicitor, and his wife, Eleanor Plunkett. Both were members of Roman Catholic families which had adhered to that religion throughout the period of the penal laws. Those laws, which imposed severe disabilities on Catholics, had been significantly relaxed by the time Palles was born. He was educated at Clongowes Wood College, near Dublin, which had been founded by the Jesuits for the education of Catholic boys in 1814. From there he went to Trinity College, Dublin, from which he graduated in 1851 as a senior moderator in mathematics. The school of mathematics in Trinity at that time had a considerable reputation: one of its most famous graduates, Sir William Rowan Hamilton, was internationally known for his work on quaternions. Palles might well have chosen to pursue an academic career in mathematics or philosophy, but at this point, not for the only time, his career was affected by the state of Irish university education, which was to be a controversial political and religious issue until the early years of the twentieth century. Fellowships in Trinity were not open to Catholics, and Palles, who had been admitted as a student in the King's Inns in Dublin in 1849 and had in 1851 started to keep terms in Gray's Inn, London, decided to make the law, rather than mathematics, his career.<br>
<br>The relaxation of the penal laws had enabled Catholics to be called to the Irish bar since 1793, among them such celebrated advocates as Daniel O'Connell. The King's Inns in Dublin began to provide a course of education for prospective barristers for the first time in 1851, and Palles was among the first Irish barristers to sit the new examinations as a preliminary to being called to the bar in the Hilary term of 1853. He rapidly built up a good practice on the old home circuit, in the counties near Dublin, and he took silk in 1865 at the unusually early age of thirty-three, specializing in chancery law. He was highly regarded by his peers at the bar and played a part in the reforms of the King's Inns which were implemented by the benchers towards the end of the 1860s. He also at this stage became increasingly involved in politics.<br>
<br>Palles was a Liberal but had no sympathy with the developing movement for Irish home rule led by his great contemporary at the bar, Isaac Butt, and later by Charles Stewart Parnell. The Liberal administration led by W. E. Gladstone, who had yet to declare his support for home rule, appointed him to the post of solicitor-general for Ireland in 1872. A few months later he was promoted to the office of attorney-general for Ireland and almost immediately contested a by-election in Londonderry on behalf of the Liberals. He was opposed, not only by a Conservative, but by a home-rule candidate.<br>
<br>It was not only his opposition to home rule which involved the Catholic Palles in controversy during the by-election; he was also noticeably reluctant to express support for the Liberal administration's proposals for the establishment of non-denominational university colleges in Ireland. That scheme, which was designed to placate Irish Catholic opinion by providing alternatives to Trinity College, was strenuously opposed by Cardinal Cullen and other members of the Irish hierarchy, who wanted a professedly Catholic university to be established. Palles's views on religion tended to be of the ultramontane variety, supporting as he did the Vatican in its struggle with the new Italian monarchy and, in private at least, he espoused Cardinal Cullen's opposition to the government's university proposals. But his unwillingness to make his views publicly known during the campaign drew down on him the wrath of many of his co-religionists, and the supporters of the home-rule candidate were also unsparing in their invective. One poster read: &#145;Who is likely to attain the judgeship which will probably be vacant in four months? Palles, of course, for defeating the cause of Ireland in Derry!&#146;<br>
<br>As a result of the split in the Catholic vote, the Conservative candidate was elected. Palles's defeat in the by-election was a critical event in his career; had he been elected, he would probably have spent the rest of his life involved in politics at Westminster. As it was, just over a year later, in February 1874, at the age of forty-two, he was appointed the chief baron of the Exchequer Division, one of the senior judicial posts in Ireland. He was the youngest Irish judge to be appointed since Tudor times. The vacancy arose just in time for Palles, before Gladstone made way for Disraeli. The story, long current at the Irish bar, that he was appointed by the outgoing prime minister on the platform at Paddington Station as he was about to board the train for Windsor to tender his resignation, is undoubtedly apocryphal (Gladstone does not record a conversation with him that day).<br>
<br>Palles's brief excursion into politics was darkened by the ferocity of the attacks on him as an unscrupulous careerist. In contrast, his reputation as a judge has always been remarkably high. Several factors contributed to this, one of them undoubtedly being the length of his tenure: his forty-two years on the bench is without parallel in Irish judicial history. He had thus ample time to develop the qualities which equipped him to be an outstanding judge: a powerful intellect, a deep and comprehensive knowledge of the law, and a strong and independent personality. Nor does he seem to have suffered from the mental infirmity, deafness, remoteness from ordinary life, and increasing rigidity of views which marred other lengthy judicial careers. In his case, there were only harmless eccentricities, such as his habit of kicking the bench and twisting his head around as though he were trying to bite his ear off, when he was carried away by the intellectual excitement of a complex legal debate.<br>
<br>Palles's experience at the Chancery bar was reflected in his judgments in that area of the law, but he was also acknowledged to be a master of the common law. His decisions in both branches of jurisprudence demonstrated his reverence for precedent: he was a passionate believer in the virtues of the system of common law and equity which had developed in Ireland since the twelfth century, but he was also well known for his open-minded approach to novel arguments. His insistence on going out on assize regularly every year almost until his retirement ensured that his knowledge of Irish conditions was not confined to Dublin.<br>
<br>The reputation of Irish judges in the nineteenth century was not uniformly high. They were seen in some instances as being unduly eager to win favour with the executive. Palles was one of a generation in the later part of the century which did much to redeem the reputation of the judiciary: his robust assertion of the independence of the judges in a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> with a strongly political background at the Connaught winter assizes of 1886 was characteristic. A riot broke out during the course of an eviction and there was evidence that the police had not intervened, apparently on instructions from the executive. Palles caustically observed that the execution of the decrees of the court in a civilized country did not depend on the will of the executive which happened to be in office.<br>
<br>Two of Palles's reported judgments illustrate his qualities as a judge. In <i>Ussher v. Ussher</i> (1912), his lucid and magisterial survey of the English and Irish law of marriage demonstrated his erudition, his understanding of legal principle, and his capacity for closely knit reasoning. The same qualities were evident in <i>O'Hanlon v. Logue</i> (1906), in which Irish law diverged sharply from English in treating bequests for the celebration of masses, even when said in private, as valid charitable gifts. A remarkable feature of that case is that Palles, having carefully weighed the arguments, had no compunction in reversing a decision he had arrived at to contrary effect at the outset of his judicial career some thirty years earlier.<br>
<br>In 1877 a unified Irish High Court and Court of Appeal was established for the first time and this involved the abolition of the old Exchequer Division over which Palles presided. That change was not fully implemented, however, until 1897, and it was agreed that even thereafter Palles should retain his title of lord chief baron, which he did until his retirement. It is a measure of the esteem in which he was held that long after his death Irish lawyers continued to refer to him simply by his title: &#145;I believe there is a decision of the chief baron on the point.&#146;<br>
<br>Towards the end of his career Palles was again concerned with the contentious topic of Irish university education. He was largely responsible for the drafting of the instrument which led to the establishment of the National University of Ireland, including the new Dublin college, in 1909, thus ending the virtual monopoly of Trinity College in higher education in the capital, which had lasted since the sixteenth century.<br>
<br>Palles's private life was clouded by tragedy. He married Ellen, the only daughter of Denis Doyle of Dublin, in 1862, while he was still a junior. She was frequently ill and died in 1885. Their only child was mentally handicapped. Palles retired from the bench in June 1916 in his eighty-fifth year, after suffering a slight stroke; he died at his home, Mount Anville House, Dundrum, co. Dublin, on 14 February 1920, and was buried in Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin. He remained a devout Roman Catholic throughout his life. His son, Christopher, died without issue at the age of ninety.<br>
