</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lambton,  John George</span> <span class="st"> [<em>nicknamed </em>Radical Jack]</span>, first earl of Durham  (1792&#150;1840), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest son of William Henry Lambton, MP for the city of Durham, and his wife, Lady Anne Barbara Frances Villiers, second daughter of George, fourth earl of Jersey; he was born in Berkeley Square, London, on 12 April 1792. His father, a supporter of Charles James Fox, died in 1797. &#145;I have never felt the blessing of a father's care or advice&#146;, Lambton wrote in 1817, &#145;and, I fear, I have suffered much from it&#146;  (New, 17).<h2>
<a name="Familywealthandhealth"></a>Family, wealth, and health</h2>The Lambtons were a Durham landed family. By 1826 coalmines were earning the estate &pound;50,000 annually, although Lambton was reported to be &pound;900,000 in debt: he economized by limiting expenditure during a visit to Paris to &pound;1000 a month. He told Thomas Creevey that &#145;a man <i>might jog on</i>&#146; with an annual income of &pound;40,000  (<span class="italic">Creevey Papers</span>, 374). Creevey called him King Jog.<br>
<br>Lambton (as he was known to his family) suffered recurrent poor health&#151;he complained in 1822 that it was &#145;damned hard that a man with &pound;80,000 a year can't sleep!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Creevey Papers</span>, 391)&#151;which probably explains his outbursts of temper, lovingly chronicled and sometimes exaggerated in contemporary diaries. A sympathetic observer noted in 1832 that &#145;his haughty and disdainful demeanour as well as petulant and ungovernable temper&#146; made him &#145;generally unpopular&#146;  (<span class="italic">Holland House Diaries</span>, 166). J. C. Hobhouse saw insecurity behind the arrogance: &#145;he did not attach so much value to his character, or opinions, as to give himself a sufficient amount of self-confidence in matters of importance&#146;  (Hobhouse, 5.75&#150;6). Lambton acknowledged that &#145;there is no one who more keenly feels a slight than myself&#146;&#151;in cabinet in 1831 he treated opposition &#145;as a personal reflection upon himself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Holland House Diaries</span>, 8)&#151;but such attitudes mainly characterized his dealing with social equals. He accepted sharp criticism from Joseph Parkes and Charles Buller. &#145;Everybody has always been afraid of him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lord Melbourne's Papers</span>, 434&#150;5), a puzzled Melbourne noted in 1838. Although acknowledged as a fine orator, he was intimidatingly taciturn, &#145;lacking the slightest power or turn for conversation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Creevey Papers</span>, 391). Florid colouring created an impression of smouldering intolerance: he looked &#145;like a picture by Murillo of a young Spanish Jesuit&#146;  (Sheil, 2.45). In 1832 Palmerston, an unfriendly observer, described him in cabinet as &#145;sullen, silent, &amp; sulky &hellip; not condescending to take part in the discussions of mortal men&#146;  (Bourne, 524).<h2>
<a name="Educationmarriageandsport"></a>Education, marriage, and sport</h2>At the age of six Lambton was entrusted to the Bristol physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1919/', "Thomas Beddoes")</script>, a radical supporter of the French Revolution, who laid the foundation of a broad education which enabled him to survive three undistinguished years at Eton College. Beddoes gave him a grounding in chemistry (Lambton later encouraged the experiments of Humphrey Davy with the miners' safety lamp, and his Durham home, Lambton Castle, was one of the first houses in Britain to be lit by gas).<br>
<br>When Lambton left Eton in 1808 his guardians wished to send him to Edinburgh University, but he insisted on joining the army, and was commissioned as cornet in the 10th hussars on 9 June 1809. By 1811 he had tired of military life. He fell in love with Henrietta (Harriet) Cholmondeley, illegitimate daughter of Lord Cholmondeley, and evaded his guardians' disapproval by marrying her in Scotland on 1 January 1812. An Anglican ceremony followed at Malpas in Cheshire on 28 January 1812. Harriet Lambton died on 11 July 1815, leaving three daughters.<br>
<br>Keen on cricket&#151;he took 61 wickets and scored 600 runs in 1812&#151;and horse-racing, Lambton also had a feeling for his family inheritance and marked his coming of age in 1813 by resuming massive reconstruction of Lambton Castle to the design of Joseph Bonomi, commissioned by Lambton's father in 1796. Creevey thought the &#145;highly collegiate&#146; dining-hall like a &#145;family vault&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Earlyradicalpolitics"></a>Early radical politics</h2>Barely twenty-one, on 20 September 1813 Lambton was returned at a by-election as MP for co. Durham, declaring himself a reformer but &#145;no friend &hellip; to wild and improbable theories&#146;  (Reid, 1.68). His election brought him into contact with the whig aristocrat Earl Grey [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11526/', "Grey, Charles, second Earl Grey")</script>], whose daughter Louisa Elizabeth Grey he married on 9 December 1816. Loyalty to the Grey clan led him to oppose J. C. Hobhouse at the Westminster by-election in 1819, and to fight a duel in 1826 with his Eton contemporary T. W. Beaumont, who was defending his Northumberland seat against Lambton's brother-in-law Lord Howick.<br>
<br>Lambton's radical reputation was founded on a few set-piece orations, beginning with his maiden speech on 12 May 1814, in which he attacked the transfer of Norway to Sweden. He made a similar protest over Genoa on 21 February 1815. In May 1817 he criticized the expense of Canning's embassy to Portugal. At a Durham county meeting on 21 October 1819 Lambton denounced the use of troops against a Manchester reform meeting (the Peterloo massacre). Brougham later claimed that Lambton, &#145;in no profession, independent in fortune&#146;, might have done more to oppose repression  (Thomas, 360). He had done enough to be regarded as a danger to the established order, as Sir Thomas Liddell bluntly told him when refusing his electoral support in 1820.<br>
<br>On 6 December 1819 Lambton proposed a sweeping measure of parliamentary reform, including shorter parliaments, a wide franchise, and a redistribution of seats. His initiative was overtaken by Lord John Russell's specific proposal for the disfranchisement of the corrupt borough of Grampound. On 17 April 1821 Lambton renewed his proposal, but was humiliated by being accidentally prevented from voting for his own motion. He ceased to be a frequent Commons speaker, and spent the winter of 1826&#150;7 in Italy for his health. On his return Lambton leaned towards support of the new prime minister, the liberal tory George Canning, placing some strain on his relations with Grey. From Canning's successor, Lord Goderich, Lambton received the peerage which he claimed &#145;as a matter of right&#146;  (New, 94), since his whig grandfather had refused a title from the tainted Pitt in 1793. In 1833 he claimed that he had accepted a title so that &#145;one who was born, bred, and educated among the people&#146;  (Reid, 1.341) might argue their cause in the upper house. Lambton was created Baron Durham on 29 January 1828.<h2>
<a name="Officeandparliamentaryreform"></a>Office and parliamentary reform</h2>It was claimed in 1829 as &#145;a well-known fact&#146; that Durham wanted a Wellington&#150;Grey coalition  (<span class="italic">Creevey Papers</span>, 543), but on 22 November 1830 he became lord privy seal in his father-in-law's cabinet, though refusing to accept the &pound;2000 salary. Grey quickly commissioned Durham to draft a reform bill. Durham convened a committee of himself, Russell, Duncannon, and Sir James Graham, which worked intensively at his London house, 13 Cleveland Row, and produced a bold scheme on 14 January 1831. Durham overcame Russell's reluctance to include the secret ballot, perhaps because he did not wish to be upstaged as he had been in 1819, but the cabinet struck out the proposal.<br>
<br>Throughout the reform crisis Durham opposed compromise. He successfully pressed the cabinet on 21 April 1831 to call an election on the issue. To circumvent procedural devices designed to delay a dissolution, ministers persuaded William IV to prorogue parliament in person. Durham's role in the plot was to chivvy the master of the horse, Lord Albemarle, from his breakfast to summon the king's carriage. When the protesting Albemarle asked &#145;Is there revolution?&#146;, Durham replied &#145;There will be if you stay to finish your breakfast&#146;  (Brock, 191). Durham also favoured a large creation of peers to force the bill through the Lords, and stalked out of a cabinet dinner on 7 March 1832 when Grey prevented him from arguing his case. He was in a minority of one when he pressed the issue to a vote on 11 March. Only the likelihood that his departure would trigger the collapse of the ministry deterred him from resignation. He spoke in support of the bill in the second reading debate in the Lords on 13 April, and on 22 May, probably from a brief by Francis Place, defended the creation of new constituencies in the London suburbs. On 7 June 1832 he was one of four commissioners who signified the royal assent on behalf of the king.<h2>
<a name="Familydisasters"></a>Family disasters</h2>Durham felt himself excluded from a political battle fought largely in the Commons, although Grey replied, deploring his ill-tempered refusal to discuss amendments on their merits. Durham was under great stress in 1831&#150;2 caused by a tragic series of bereavements. On 24 September 1831 Charles, his &#145;beautiful and remarkable son&#146;, died aged thirteen after a long illness. Durham's mother died unexpectedly on 21 April 1832. After &#145;terrible sufferings&#146; the youngest daughter from his first marriage, Harriet, followed on 30 May. &#145;In eight months I have lost son, mother, and daughter&#146;, Durham wrote. &#145;I shudder to think who could be the next victim&#146;  (Reid, 1.299). It was not long before he knew. His second daughter, Georgiana, died on 3 January 1833. In December 1836 the surviving child of his first marriage, Fanny, &#145;the blessing of my life from her earliest childhood&#146;, died in Ireland just two months after her marriage  (New, 284).<br>
<br>Durham was devastated by these blows: he needed laudanum to sleep. On 30 November 1831, his first cabinet appearance after his son's death, he &#145;lost all command of himself&#146; in a violent clash with Grey. Durham felt that the ministry was losing its resolve over reform, and that the high personal price he had paid for his political involvement entitled his views to more consideration. The diary of Lord Holland, who witnessed the &#145;distressing&#146; scene  (<span class="italic">Holland House Diaries</span>, 88&#150;9), does not support Greville's version, recorded third-hand, that the diatribe included an accusation that Grey contributed to the boy's death by forcing Durham to remain in London throughout his illness  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 2.226&#150;7). &#145;No two men are more unlike than Durham when in good humour, and Durham in his angry, tetchy and, I am afraid one must add, usual mood&#146;, Holland noted in December 1831  (<span class="italic">Holland House Diaries</span>, 93).<h2>
<a name="Resignationandearldom"></a>Resignation and earldom</h2>Durham resigned from the cabinet on 14 March 1833, and on 23 March he received the earldom for which &#145;he had long panted with childish vanity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Holland House Diaries</span>, 207). Out of office Durham followed a threefold strategy. First he disputed the leadership of the radicals with Brougham, especially in speeches at Edinburgh on 15 September and Glasgow on 29 October 1834. Secondly he energetically cultivated the press, and was thought to have <span class="italic">The Times</span> and <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> &#145;under his immediate control&#146;  (Aspinall, 380). In the publicity battle Durham broke cabinet confidentiality to claim responsibility for the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>. Thirdly he exploited a long-standing friendship with Leopold, king of the Belgians, to cultivate his sister, the duchess of Kent, as &#145;the avenue to Court favor&#146;  (H. R. V. Holland, 391) when her daughter, Princess Victoria, came to the throne. At Cowes in September 1833 Durham entertained Victoria with a firework display including the Lambton motto, <i>Le jour viendra</i>.<h2>
<a name="AmbassadortoRussia18351837"></a>Ambassador to Russia, 1835&#150;1837</h2>The re-formed whig ministry under Melbourne appointed Durham ambassador to St Petersburg in July 1835, perhaps to get him out of the country. Durham had undertaken a special mission there in 1833, and relations with Russia were cordial during his term&#151;not surprisingly, since Durham was &#145;completely bit by the Emperor Nicholas&#146;  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 2.2), whose critics he termed &#145;Russophobites&#146;. Durham's return to Britain in June 1837 coincided with the death of William IV, and there was speculation that he would join Melbourne's weak ministry.<h2>
<a name="CanadaandtheDurhamreport18371838"></a>Canada and &#145;the Durham report&#146;, 1837&#150;1838</h2>On 22 July 1837 Melbourne asked Durham to consider tackling the problem of Canada. In the mainly French-speaking province of Lower Canada (later Quebec) the elected assembly had reached stalemate in quarrels with successive governors-in-chief over the control of the colonial government. Durham decided to &#145;have nothing to do with the settlement of that unfortunate question&#146;  (Martin, <span class="italic">Durham Report</span>, 13). In December 1837 news arrived of rebellion in Lower Canada. Ministers were forced to suspend the constitution and required a governor-in-chief who could be trusted to wield dictatorial power. Durham's motives for accepting the task in January 1838 remain conjectural. His later claim that he had been &#145;told that their Existence as a Govt&#146; depended on his acceptance suggests that he assumed that he had acquired the whip hand over his former associates. The critical Greville marvelled at &#145;the general applause&#146;  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 4.54) for his appointment. Realization that Melbourne controlled access to the young queen may also have persuaded him that the day predicted in the Lambton motto had not yet arrived.<br>
<br>Durham's mission quickly ran into problems. Although appointed to tackle a crisis, he delayed his departure until 24 April 1838. The interval was spent in assembling a lavish outfit, even including musical instruments, prompting Sydney Smith's explanation &#145;that Durham is going to make overtures to the Canadian people&#146;  (Reid, 2.165). On 2 April a motion to limit Durham's expenditure was defeated by just two votes in the Commons. Durham made two controversial appointments to his staff: both his legal adviser, Thomas Turton, and the colonization theorist Edward Gibbon Wakefield had been involved in sex scandals. Even the easy-going Melbourne felt that if &#145;their abilities &hellip; were superhuman they would not counterbalance the discredit of their characters&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lord Melbourne's Papers</span>, 428&#150;9).<br>
<br>Durham arrived in Canada on 29 May 1838 with wide powers as governor-in-chief of British North America and high commissioner. Ruling Lower Canada through a special council, composed mainly of his own associates, he began to overhaul all aspects of the administration. To pave the way for a general amnesty, on 28 June 1838 Durham issued an ordinance exiling eight imprisoned rebel leaders to Bermuda, on pain of death should they return. Brougham attacked this as an abuse of power. It soon transpired that Durham had no authority over Bermuda. Ministers briefly attempted a defence, but were forced to disallow the ordinance. Unluckily, Durham learned of this from an American newspaper on 19 September. Melbourne suspected that Durham would &#145;concoct a general arrangement &hellip; boast of the effect he produced while there&#146; and blame any failures &#145;on the manner in which he has been treated&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lord Melbourne's Papers</span>, 432). On 9 October 1838 Durham issued a forthright proclamation announcing his resignation. He departed on 1 November, after barely five months in Canada.<br>
<br>On his return Durham intended to &#145;be the plaintiff &amp; not the defendant&#146;  (Martin, &#145;Durham myth&#146;, 54), but found the political world unsympathetic. The Bermuda ordinance proved that Turton's &#145;law is not a jot better than his morals&#146;  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 4.123), and the proclamation was generally condemned. As Melbourne had predicted, when Durham arrived at Plymouth on 30 November he boasted of his success in Canada, but news quickly followed of a second revolt in the province, and his critics now alleged that he had fled from problems of his own creation.<br>
<br>The unauthorized publication of Durham's &#145;Report on the affairs of British North America&#146; in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, beginning on 8 February 1839, caused another sensation. Wakefield was probably responsible, possibly because ministers were pressing for deletion of his ideas on land policy. Durham's enemies denied that that he was the author of the report, alleging that he merely signed the dubious production of his shady entourage. Durham's work on the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> and a major report he produced on Russian affairs in 1836 are testimonies to his intellect. The production of a text of 120,000 words in two months suggests collaboration, and a persistent tradition points to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3913/', "Charles Buller")</script>, his secretary, as co-author.<br>
<br>Durham's report recommended the union of Lower Canada with English-speaking Upper Canada (now Ontario) to Anglicize the French Canadians and as a step to a union of all the British North American provinces. He avoided the contentious term &#145;responsible government&#146;, but argued for limited colonial self-government, reserving tariffs and the disposal of public lands to Britain, and brushing aside the problem of enforcing imperial authority. Because of the brevity of his stay in Canada and his magnificent isolation from ordinary settlers&#151;his three-week visit to Montreal and Upper Canada in July 1838 was like a royal progress&#151;Durham hardly acquired any profound understanding of its problems.<br>
<br>Durham's report was later hailed by historians as the blueprint for the Commonwealth, a hagiography which in the 1970s provoked exuberant rebuttal. Although Melbourne expected that legislation would &#145;probably be based, at least to some degree&#146; on Durham's proposals  (Maxwell, 1.159), the verdict of &#145;<span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> of the Second British Empire&#146;  (R. Coupland, ed., <span class="italic">The Durham Report</span>, 1945, xlvi) cannot be sustained. Durham's fame as a proconsul has died with the British empire, but in modern Quebec he remains a symbolic cultural threat.<br>
<br>Durham's &#145;Report on the affairs of British North America&#146; was published as a parliamentary paper (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1839, 17). Editions were published by Ridgway (1839) and Methuen (1902), without named editors. C. P. Lucas published an extensive edition (3 vols., 1912) and R. Coupland a short version (1945). G. M. Craig edited <span class="italic">An Abridgement</span> (1963) with the <span class="roman">Carleton Library</span>, published by McClelland and Stewart (Toronto). A French translation, edited by M.-P. Hamel, was published in Quebec in 1948.<h2>
<a name="Deathandreputation"></a>Death and reputation</h2>Durham's health suffered in Canada, and he took little part in politics after his return, speaking in the Lords &#145;like a man of great decision, mixed with some impatience&#146;  (<span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span>, 23 Feb 1839). By May 1840 he was gravely ill, probably with tuberculosis. He died on 28 July 1840 at Cowes, and was buried at Chester-le-Street. Tradition related that on his deathbed Durham had said, &#145;The Canadians will one day do justice to my memory.&#146; In contemporary usage, &#145;the Canadians&#146; usually referred to French-Canadians: Reid, in 1906, emended this to &#145;Canada&#146;  (Reid, 2, title-page). Durham was survived by his son George and three daughters, one of whom, Mary, married in 1846 Lord Elgin, the governor-in-chief of British North America who presided over the province's transition to self-government. Their vow, as newly-weds, &#145;to build a monument&#146; to Durham's memory added a sentimental note to his mythic role in Canadian nationhood. More tangibly, a Greek temple was erected by public subscription on Penshaw Hill in 1844, and still looms over the Durham countryside.<br>
<br>Durham left &pound;250,000, all to his widow. The estate had liabilities of &pound;635,000, but much of this was probably planned refinancing of the Lambton collieries. In religion he was a liberal Anglican, and a strong foe of reactionary clergy such as Henry Phillpotts. Durham favoured freemasonry as a means of uniting classes. He became deputy grand master for England in May 1834.<br>
<br>Essentially, Durham was an eighteenth-century figure. So were many of his contemporaries. The most notable among them were granted lifespans sufficient to adjust to the Victorian world. Durham died at the age of forty-eight with his personal and political contradictions unresolved.<br>
