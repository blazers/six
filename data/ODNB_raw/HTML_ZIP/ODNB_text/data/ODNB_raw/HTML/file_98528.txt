<span class="headword">Fletcher,  Christian</span>, Lady Abercrombie  (1619/20&#150;1691), <span class="occ">royalist heroine</span>, was born in Kinneff, Kincardineshire. About 1642 she married James Granger or Grainger (1603/4&#150;1663), presbyterian minister of Kinneff church since 1640. He had graduated MA from the University of St Andrews and had been a preacher in Montrose. Their children were John, Robert, and James, and the family lived in the manse at Kinneff.<br>
<br>Christian Fletcher achieved fame for helping prevent the honours of Scotland (the crown, sceptre, and sword of state) from falling into the hands of Cromwellian forces. The honours were used at the coronation of Charles II at Scone on 1 January 1651, but could not be returned thereafter to Edinburgh Castle which had fallen to Cromwellian forces. In June 1651 the honours were ordered to Dunnottar, a castle owned by the Keith family, earls Marischal, on the coast of Kincardineshire near Stonehaven. Katherine Drummond (daughter of Patrick Smith of Braco, wife first of John Cowan of Tailourtown and second of David Drummond, minister of Moneydie) carried the honours there, hidden in sacks of wool, through territory occupied by Cromwellian forces. She was never rewarded for this heroic feat.<br>
<br>By September 1651 it was only a matter of time before Dunnottar's small garrison surrendered. A plan to spirit away the honours and the king's papers was hatched with the involvement of Mary Erskine, dowager Countess Marischal; Elizabeth Douglas, wife of George Ogilvie of Barras, governor of the castle; and Christian Fletcher. Ogilvie and James Granger might also have been involved. Douglas's kinswoman and &#145;dependant&#146;, Anne Lindsay (daughter of Alexander Lindsay of Cuichbirnes, in the parish of Logie Buchan, and later wife of John Willcox, minister of Kemnay) walked out of the castle with the papers sewn into her belt, taking them safely through enemy lines&#151;a further act of female heroism that went unrewarded. In her &#145;informatione&#146; to the Scottish privy council in 1664 Fletcher claimed to have visited the castle three times to remove the honours. In February 1652 Elizabeth Douglas gave her the crown and sceptre, which she brought away on horseback, riding always close to the cliffs, having resolved to throw the honours into the sea rather than let them fall into English hands. In March 1652 she went on foot with a servant, who took away the sword in a sack of hards (coarse flax tow) on her back. Later in March 1652 she removed the sword case in a sack of cods (pillows). Barron considers her account to have been &#145;written in a conscious spirit of self-advertisement&#146;  (<span class="italic">In defence</span>, 20) and instead favours the story, recounted by William Meston, tutor in the Marischal family in the eighteenth century, that the crown and sceptre, and perhaps also the sword, were lowered from the castle to Fletcher's servant girl, who waited on the beach below and took them away hidden in a creel of &#145;Dulse and Tangles&#146; seaweed  (ibid., 165). This version is plausible, though influenced by Barron's distaste for Fletcher on account of her later sexual conduct, and it still names Fletcher as having been involved in planning the scheme, providing a servant, and receiving the smuggled honours. The name of Fletcher's servant girl, whom both versions agree to have been active in the enterprise, is not known, and her heroism was never rewarded.<br>
<br>However they came to have the honours, it is agreed that Fletcher and her husband buried them in Kinneff church by night and in secret. Dunnottar surrendered on 24 May 1652 and the Cromwellians were angry to find the honours gone when they took the castle two days later. A story put out by the Countess Marischal that her son, John Keith, had removed them to the continent threw the English off the scent and the hunt was discontinued. The honours remained at Kinneff church and every three months Fletcher and Granger disinterred them by night, aired them, and reburied them in fresh cloths. They surrendered them after protracted negotiations on 8 October 1660. The Countess Marischal secured money and titles for her son by falsely insisting that the story of his having smuggled them to the continent was true. Ogilvy secured a lesser reward by claiming the main role in saving the honours, and a bitter feud broke out between the families over their claims, all of which minimized the role of Fletcher, Granger, and the servant. An act of the Scottish parliament of January 1661 recognized that Fletcher had been &#145;most active&#146; in conveying the honours to safety and then preserving them from the &#145;English usurpers&#146;, and awarded her a sum of 2000 merks Scots. The money was, however, never paid.<br>
<br>James Granger died just before 20 May 1663. On 18 October 1663, at Kinneff, Christian Fletcher married James Sandilands, first Lord Abercrombie (<i>b</i>. before 1627, <i>d</i>. after 1667), a dissolute spendthrift whose first marriage to Jean Licton had ended in divorce in March 1663. A daughter, Margaret, was baptized on 27 February 1664, just four months after the wedding. In January 1664 Abercrombie granted Fletcher a life-rent charter of the estate of Largie. Nothing is known of Fletcher's later life. She died in February 1691, aged seventy-one.<br>
<br>Interest in Fletcher grew after the rediscovery by Walter Scott on 4 February 1818 of the honours, which had lain forgotten in Edinburgh Castle since 1707. Scott mentioned Fletcher's and Granger's role in saving them in several publications and this led to the repetition of the story in numerous Scottish guidebooks, accounts of antiquities, and histories. In a letter of 7 February 1818 Scott referred to the tradition that Fletcher and Granger had been tortured by the boots, but rightly considered this to have been improbable. The story of the saving of the regalia appealed to Scottish painters: Alexander Chisholm's painting <span class="italic">The Minister of Kinneff and his Wife Concealing in the Church the Scottish Regalia</span> was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1846, and David Wilkie produced three studies for a painting of the burial of the honours (NG Scot., 1835/6; Hunterian Art Gallery, Glasgow; priv. coll.), but it is thought that he never executed the work. Fletcher's bravery and patriotism were cited in 1912 by Lady Agnes and Sir Robert Baden-Powell as an example to Girl Guides  (<span class="italic">Handbook</span>, 410&#150;11). An investigation by J. P. Campbell (2007) provides useful biographical detail and is far more sympathetic to Fletcher than was Barron, whose work, however, remains the standard source.<br>
<br>In the rebuilt church at Kinneff (now the old kirk) Victorian monuments honour James Granger (the allusion to his enjoyment of heavenly reward draws attention to the fact that he had none on earth), as well as Ogilvie and his wife, but not Fletcher. In Dunnottar Castle an inscription over a fireplace commemorates the role of Ogilvie, his wife, and Anne Lindsay in saving the honours. Following their rediscovery, the honours have been on show at Edinburgh Castle since 1819. Ironically they were never again used in a coronation ceremony, though the crown was displayed at the inaugural sitting of the Scottish parliament in 1999, the opening of the Scottish parliament building in 2004, and at ceremonies marking new parliamentary sessions. Though her precise role in events is disputed, Fletcher epitomizes the fact that women took most of the risks in saving the honours while men took most of the glory.<br>
