<span class="headword">Pain,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1743&#150;1794), <span class="occ">writer on architecture</span>, described himself variously as an architect, carpenter, and joiner. Almost nothing of his professional or private life is known, but it is safe to assume that his great success as an author of pattern books made him an influential figure in eighteenth-century building practice, both in Britain and North America. His first book, <span class="italic">The Builder's Companion, and Workman's General Assistant</span> (1758), was co-published by the London printseller and publisher Robert Sayer. Like most of Pain's subsequent output, this substantial folio was intended to instruct builders and craftsmen who wished to work in one or other of the prevailing styles (Palladian, rococo, or Gothic). A minimum of text accompanies a large number of technical illustrations. <span class="italic">The Builder's Pocket-Treasure</span> (1763), containing the first known architectural engravings by Pain's future publisher Isaac Taylor, was a smaller book of the same kind. In its preface Pain claims more than twenty years of professional experience and states that in his course of work he had &#145;executed almost every Part of the Book himself&#146;.<br>
<br>A decade later, when Taylor's firm began marketing a series of new books by Pain, he was sufficiently abreast of fashion to be of significant help in diffusing the so-called Adam style (named after the architect brothers Robert and James Adam). In <span class="italic">The Practical Builder</span> (1774), <span class="italic">The Carpenter's and Joiner's Repository</span> (1778), and <span class="italic">The Carpenter's Pocket Directory</span> (1781) Pain concentrated on his principal area of expertise, that of wood construction. His reputation established, he then published independently <span class="italic">The Builder's Golden Rule</span> (issued in parts, 1780&#150;81; with a supplement, 1782), <span class="italic">The Practical Measurer</span> (1783), <span class="italic">Pain's British Palladio</span> (1786), <span class="italic">The Practical House Carpenter</span> (&#145;second edition&#146;, 1788; 1st edn untraced), and <span class="italic">The Builder's Sketch Book</span> (1793). The title-pages of these books indicate that Pain lived in London at 3 Little Red Lion Court, Charter House Lane, near West Smithfield, from 1782 to 1786; at 12 Fisher Street, Red Lion Square, Holborn, from 1787 to 1793; and at 1 Diana Place, New Road, opposite the west end of Fitzroy Square, in 1794.<br>
<br>Most of Pain's books were published in several editions, often improved with an unusual degree of care by the author for at least the first few years after their initial appearance. <span class="italic">Pain's British Palladio</span>, his most ambitious work, included designs by his son James Pain, described as a builder and surveyor. It may have been this family partnership that allowed the father to advertise his willingness to build the houses he featured at the listed prices.<br>
<br>It was undoubtedly the number and clarity of Pain's illustrations for all kinds of structural and decorative woodwork that made these pattern books popular in America, where the existence of numerous copies can be traced from 1760 onwards, and where four of Pain's titles were reprinted before 1800. <span class="italic">The Practical House Carpenter</span>, his most successful work, had the rare distinction of being reprinted both in Boston (1796) and Philadelphia (1797). Unlike its predecessors it shows roof trusses complete with purlins and wall plates rather than as isolated frames, and it was this kind of advance in technical illustration, rather than any great innovation in building techniques, that made Pain's books useful in New England even as they were being superseded in Britain by the works of the architect Peter Nicholson. Pain was last noticed in 1794, and his date and place of death are unknown.<br>
