<span class="headword">Kennedy,  Gilbert</span>, fourth earl of Cassillis <span class="st"> [<em>nicknamed </em> the King of Carrick]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1541&#150;1576), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the eldest of five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15368/', "Gilbert Kennedy, third earl of Cassillis (c.1517&#150;1558)")</script>, and his wife, Margaret (<i>c</i>.1520&#150;1596), daughter of Alexander Kennedy of Bargany. He was under age in November 1558 when his father&#151;in whose absence he first sat in parliament as master of Cassillis&#151;died in France, and he was not served heir until 16 October 1562. On 10 February 1559 he succeeded his father as a gentleman of the bedchamber to Henri II of France. The English ambassador reported him, in August 1561, &#145;that Sunday at the preaching and the Monday at the Mass: it is said that since he has repented it and this is but Tuesday&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1547&#150;63</i>, p. 547). Despite such inconsistency, Cassillis initially resisted reform, guided by his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15389/', "Quintin Kennedy")</script>, abbot of Crossraguel. His eventual conversion to the protestant faith, in August 1566, is attributed to Margaret (<i>c</i>.1545&#150;1626), only daughter of John Lyon, seventh Lord Glamis, whom he married on 30 September. They had two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15377/', "John Kennedy, fifth earl of Cassillis")</script>, and Hew, master of Cassillis.<br>
<br>Cassillis's relative youth precluded any significant participation in politics until the later years of Mary Stuart's reign. He sat on the assize which in April 1567 acquitted the earl of Bothwell of Lord Darnley's murder, signed the so-called Ainslie bond shortly afterwards in favour of Bothwell's marriage to Mary, but joined the confederacy opposing the royal couple at Carberry Hill on 15 June. Following Mary's escape from Lochleven Castle on 2 May 1568, he signed the Hamilton bond, and on 13 May fought for her at Langside, where his brother Sir Thomas Kennedy of Culzean was taken prisoner. After the queen's flight to England he remained loyal to her, though he entertained a genuine respect for the regent Moray, and acted as pallbearer at his funeral.<br>
<br>Cassillis achieved notoriety when he attempted to resolve a long-running dispute over the ownership of the lands of Crossraguel Abbey by roasting their commendator (lay proprietor) in the black vault of Dunure Castle. The abbey had been in Kennedy hands since 1524, but following the death of Abbot Quintin in August 1564 the crown intervened to appoint Allan Stewart as commendator. Cassillis held a five-year lease of the abbacy set to expire at Whitsun 1569 and when he attended the 1566 celebration of Candlemas in Holyrood chapel, his display of devotion was rewarded with a further nineteen-year lease, in terms which appeared to contradict the earlier grant to Stewart. However, the new commendator, intent on diverting lands to his brother Sir James Stewart of Cardonald, proved unreceptive to Cassillis's attempts to buy him out. Allan Stewart was lured to Dunure Castle on 29 August 1570. When he refused to dispone the lands in Cassillis's favour, so Stewart alleged, he was carried to the black vault, where he was stripped below the waist and his feet set between an iron chimney and a fire until he complied with the earl's demands. His refusal to ratify the relevant charters a week later saw him put back over the fire. He was finally rescued in November 1570 by men of the sheriffdom led by Cassillis's uncle Sir Thomas Kennedy of Bargany. The leader of King James's party in Carrick, Bargany had himself detained the commendator in the previous year, in pursuit of a share of the Crossraguel lands.<br>
<br>Cassillis's attempts to reassert his authority in Ayrshire were arrested when the regent Lennox descended on Carrick, and he was forced to enter himself in ward at Stirling on 15 April 1571, thus effectively ending his support for the queen. He rejoined the privy council under the regent Mar on 7 September. Cassillis subsequently acquired the Crossraguel estates by purchase. His violence was condemned by opponents of the Marian cause, but his actions consolidated his family's grip on southern Ayrshire, where he was popularly known as the King of Carrick. He had earlier secured the lands of Glenluce Abbey at the expense of Sir John Gordon of Lochinvar. In 1576 his horse fell with him as it crossed a bridge near Glasgow. He was carried to Edinburgh, where he died on 12 December. He was buried in Maybole collegiate church.<br>
