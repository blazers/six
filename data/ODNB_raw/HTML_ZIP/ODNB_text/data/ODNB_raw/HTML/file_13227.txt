<span class="headword">Higford,  William</span>  (1580/81&#150;1657), <span class="occ">writer on conduct</span>, was born in Dixton, Alderton parish, Gloucestershire, one of five children of John Hugford (<i>d</i>. 1616), whose family owned the manor, and his wife, Dorothea, daughter of William Rogers. William (who adopted the spelling Higford) matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford, on 14 January 1597 but later transferred to Corpus Christi College, which his father and grandfather had both attended. Here he studied under Sebastian Benefield and &#145;by the benefit of good discipline and natural parts, he became a well qualified gentleman&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3rd edn, 3.429), gaining his BA in February 1599. He returned to Dixton and married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1657), daughter of Sir John Meulx of Kingston, Isle of Wight, with whom he had seven children.<br>
<br>Through the patronage of Grey Brydges, fifth Baron Chandos, he was appointed a JP. Wood describes him as a zealous puritan but his anthologist, Clement Barksdale, rector of Sudeley, contends that Higford held fast to the Elizabethan church, &#145;warping neither to Rome nor Amsterdam&#146;  (<span class="italic">Harleian Miscellany</span>, 9.582). This is not necessarily reliable either, since Barksdale was a firm Anglican, but Higford's writings show only conventional protestant piety and give fulsome praise to the Chandos and Tracy families, both of whom were royalist in the civil war. Higford died at Dixton on 6 April 1657, in his seventy-seventh year, and was buried in Alderton church.<br>
<br>Barksdale collated some of Higford's writings and published them posthumously as <span class="italic">Institutions, or, Advice to a Grandson</span> (1658). The recipient of this advice was John (<i>b</i>. 1627), son of Higford's son John (<i>b</i>. 1607), who married in 1626 Frances Scudamore (1608&#150;1688) but predeceased his father. Higford clearly felt responsible for his grandson's upbringing. <span class="italic">Institutions</span> was reprinted in 1660, republished in 1666 as <span class="italic">The Institution of a Gentleman in III Parts</span>, and reprinted by Thomas Park in <span class="italic">The Harleian Miscellany</span> in 1812. The book draws on a wide-ranging classical knowledge to advise Higford's young grandson on such matters as preserving the estate, religion, education, how to act towards friends and servants, and drawing attention to the key virtues of justice, temperance, fortitude, and prudence. Knox suggests that Higford's work is largely derivative, but has the merit of offering a broad curriculum and praises the benefits of foreign travel and the acquisition of a foreign language. Wood records that Higford left behind other &#145;matters fit for the press &hellip; which being not understood by his children were lost&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3rd edn, 3.429).<br>
