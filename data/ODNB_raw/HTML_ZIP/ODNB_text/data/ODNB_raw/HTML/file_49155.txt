<span class="headword">Ruthquist <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>McKay]</span>,  Alexina</span>  (1848&#150;1892), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born on 8 September 1848 at Fordyce, Banffshire, the third child of the Revd Murdoch McKay, Free Church of Scotland minister at Rhynie, and his wife, Alexina Robertson. She had at least two sisters. Alexander McKay (1849&#150;1890), CMS missionary to Uganda, was her cousin. She was educated at home and later at Miss Milne's seminary in Edinburgh. While at school she expressed a desire to become a missionary. Her mother, however, was unwilling to give her permission; in accordance with her wishes, Alexina agreed to defer her ambition and wait for a definite &#145;call&#146; to mission work.<br>
<br>Mrs McKay was convinced of her daughter's vocation in 1876, when a family friend recommended the McKay daughters to the Ladies' Society for Female Education in India and South Africa of the Free Church of Scotland. Her mother's approval secured, Alexina was sent to Nagpur as zenana agent (a missionary employed specifically to evangelize women) of the Free Church Mission there; she arrived in India in November 1877.<br>
<br>Travelling with an interpreter and a Biblewoman, Alexina visited the homes of all who would allow her entrance, offering lessons in English, needlework, reading, and the harmonium, as well as religious instruction. She was said to have had a beautiful singing voice which she used to good effect, punctuating lessons with hymns in Marathi. Unwilling to confine her ministry to women, she made temperance visits to the local soldiers' camps. Her sister Maggie joined her at Nagpur in early 1881. Alexina spent 1883 on furlough in Britain conducting missionary meetings on behalf of the society; she declined a proposal of marriage, and returned to India. From 1880 she wrote under the pen name Phoebe for the magazine for Free Church of Scotland zenana agents, <span class="italic">Jottings by Busy People</span>.<br>
<br>In March 1884 Alexina's sister married a Swedish missionary and moved to Narsingphur. Alexina continued as zenana agent but resigned on her own marriage, which took place in Bombay on 13 October 1888, to the Revd Johan Ruthquist, also of the Swedish Mission. The couple settled in Amarwara and on 3 November 1889 their only child, Mary Juanita, was born; she lived for twelve days. With few domestic duties Alexina was able to accompany her husband as he toured the district. Her talent for singing, used before to keep the attention of her zenana pupils as well as to impart simple biblical messages, was now employed to draw audiences in the villages they visited. When in Amarwara she held <span class="roman">Bible</span> classes, visited village women, and distributed medicine.<br>
<br>Although failing in health, Alexina offered to accompany a widowed Swedish missionary to Stockholm with his two children, one a sickly infant. While the ship was in the Red Sea she became ill. After lying unconscious for two days, she died at Elektra on 5 September 1892, and was buried at Suez.<br>
