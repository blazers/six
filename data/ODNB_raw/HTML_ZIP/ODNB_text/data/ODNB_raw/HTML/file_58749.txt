<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Carstairs,  John Paddy</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Nelson John Keys]</span>  (1910&#150;1970), <span class="occ">film-maker and writer</span>, was born at 1 St Stephen's Mansions, Smith Square, London, on 11 May 1910, the eldest of four sons of Nelson Waite (Bunch) Keys (1887&#150;1939), actor and comedian, and his wife, Hazel Eileen Saqui, actress, of Dublin. After Alleyn Court preparatory school, Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, he went to Repton School in 1924. Self-confessedly a genial exhibitionist, he became a proficient lightweight boxer. His headmaster, the Revd Geoffrey Fisher, later archbishop of Canterbury, supported his formation in 1927 of a cinema club, with its own tie and magazine; he produced a full-length melodrama of public-school life, <span class="italic">The Hero of St Jim's</span>, and news of its success reached Fleet Street. To the initial annoyance of his father, he abandoned any idea of proceeding to Cambridge, becoming instead an apprentice to his father's old friend Herbert Wilcox, the film producer and director.<br>
<br>Henceforth Carstairs was irretrievably wedded to the film industry. Having changed his name so as not to cash in on his father's success, he profited from Wilcox's sponsorship and from him learned the spadework of the film business: editing, camera work, and scenario writing. This proved invaluable in his later career as a director. At the age of nineteen, after a year in Hollywood, he went on to spend two years as assistant director to Basil Dean, who disliked his loud clothes and the American accent he had acquired in his time there. At this time Carstairs also collaborated on scripts with A. P. Herbert, Miles Malleson, and Evelyn Waugh, and wrote a series of articles on Hollywood for the <span class="italic">Evening News</span>. A trip around the world was followed by script writing for Gaumont-British and an unsuccessful directorial d&eacute;but with <span class="italic">Paris Plane</span> (1933). In 1934 he secured a six-month contract in Hollywood with MGM as a scenario writer and collaborated on <span class="italic">A Yank at Oxford</span> (1937). Back in England, he survived a serious car accident; directed <span class="italic">Night Ride</span> (1937); wrote and directed <span class="italic">Incident in Shanghai</span> (1938), set during the Sino-Japanese War; and directed <span class="italic">Lassie from Lancashire</span> (1938) and, with George Sanders in the title role, <span class="italic">The Saint in London</span> (1939).<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war Carstairs made three short films for the Ministry of Information on &#145;careless talk&#146; and directed George Formby in <span class="italic">Spare a Copper</span> (1940), a comedy set in Merseyside which netted &pound;130,000. For much of the war he worked in the Royal Navy's air photography section. When he resumed his film career in 1945, his speed and efficiency as a director and his flair for comedy ensured his constant employment. In all, Carstairs directed forty-five feature films, including the comedies <span class="italic">The Chiltern Hundreds</span> (1949), <span class="italic">Made in Heaven</span> (1952), <span class="italic">Sands of the Desert</span> (1960), and <span class="italic">A Weekend with Lulu</span> (1961). Despite some clash of personalities, he directed Norman Wisdom's earliest films, including <span class="italic">Trouble in Store</span> (1953) and <span class="italic">The Square Peg</span> (1958). He directed Tommy Steele in the musical <span class="italic">Tommy the Toreador</span> (1959).<br>
<br>Carstairs was also a prolific author, producing more than thirty books. A light novel, <span class="italic">Vinegar and Brown Paper</span> (1939), sold 144,000 copies. <span class="italic">Movie Merry-Go-Round</span> (1937) was a technical analysis of film-making. The war years saw him publish <span class="italic">Bunch</span> (1941), a biography of his father, and two volumes of autobiography, <span class="italic">Honest Injun!</span> (1942) and <span class="italic">Hadn't we the Gaiety?</span> (1945). He also wrote eight popular novels and romances, including <span class="italic">Gremlins in the Cabbage Patch</span> (1944) and <span class="italic">No Music in the Nightingale</span> (1945). Post-war works included the satirical <span class="italic">Sunshine and Champagne</span> (1955); a book of short stories, <span class="italic">My Fancy has Wings</span> (1948); a third autobiographical work, <span class="italic">Kaleidoscope and a Jaundiced Eye</span> (1946); and a book for children, <span class="italic">Lollipop Wood</span> (1946). In addition to eight other novels, he published seven detective novels from 1958 to 1967 featuring his sleuth Garway Trenton.<br>
<br>Carstairs was also a painter of figures and townscapes in watercolours, oils, tempera, and gouache. He studied under Sir William Coldstream at London University and attended life classes at the Slade. His initial London exhibition was in 1949, and he later exhibited at the Paris Salon, and the John Whibley, Redfern, and Leger galleries. Between 1957 and 1968 he showed a dozen paintings at the Royal Academy and his work is represented in public collections. He painted in the manner of the Impressionists, and he was much influenced by great colourists like Derain, Matisse, Dufy, and Picasso. He favoured harbour scenes, crowded streets, and seascapes, many set in the south of France. Works such as <span class="italic">Venice, 1970</span> have a na&iuml;ve quality. In 1958 he published an artists' handbook, <span class="italic">Watercolour is Fun</span>. He died of heart failure on 12 December 1970 at Kingston Hospital, Kingston upon Thames, and was cremated at the Kingston crematorium. He was survived by his wife, Molly.<br>
