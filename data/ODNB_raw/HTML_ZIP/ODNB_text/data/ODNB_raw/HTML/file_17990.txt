<span class="headword">Mansel,  William Lort</span>  (1753&#150;1820), <span class="occ">bishop of Bristol and college head</span>, was born at Pembroke on 2 April 1753, the son of William Wogan Mansel, of Pembroke, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Major Roger Lort, officer in the Royal Welch Fusiliers. He was educated at Gloucester grammar school, under Mr Sparks, and was admitted pensioner, aged seventeen, at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 2 June 1770. Elected scholar in 1771, he graduated BA in 1774 and proceeded MA in 1777. He was made junior fellow in 1775, full fellow in 1777, and held many college offices, twice serving as junior dean (1783&#150;4 and 1785&#150;6). He was ordained deacon at Peterborough on 18 June 1780 and priest on 28 September 1783, after which he was appointed vicar of Bottisham, Cambridgeshire, by the bishop of Ely. On 6 November 1788 his college presented him to the vicarage of Chesterton, and in the following year, on 20 January, he married Isabella Haggerstone, the daughter of a Cambridge attorney.<br>
<br>In college Mansel was known as a fine wit and mimic, and delighted in satirizing academic rivalries. His popularity led to his election as public orator in 1788. He often preached before the university and took part in county politics as a strong supporter of William Pitt's government. He was linked to the administration through his position as chaplain to Pitt's master of the rolls, Sir Richard Pepper Arden. His former pupil Spencer Perceval recommended him to Pitt for the mastership of his college; Mansel was duly appointed on 25 May 1798, with instructions &#145;to maintain the authority of the situation, and (what is much wanted) to improve the discipline of the College&#146;  (William Pitt to George III, 12 May 1798, <span class="italic">Later Correspondence of George III</span>, 3.61). The elements of political and religious radicalism in Trinity&#151;encouraged by two of the fellows, Thomas Jones and James Lambert&#151;certainly dispersed under &#145;the perfectly orthodox&#146; Mansel  (ibid., 3.61), who also served as vice-chancellor in his second year as master. Mansel's loyalty to the political establishment was recognized when Perceval, then chancellor of the exchequer, promoted his candidacy for the bishopric of Bristol, to which he was consecrated on 30 October 1808. He was further rewarded, in 1810, with the wealthy living of Barwick in Elmet, Yorkshire, which was in Perceval's gift as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster.<br>
<br>Mansel published only three of his sermons. He died at the master's lodge, Trinity College, on 27 June 1820, and was buried in the chapel on 3 July. He had five daughters and at least three sons, the youngest of whom, Spencer Perceval Mansel (1797&#150;1862), was named after his great patron.<br>
