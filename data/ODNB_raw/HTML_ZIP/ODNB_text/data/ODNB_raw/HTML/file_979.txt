<span class="headword">Bache,  Francis Edward</span>  (1833&#150;1858), <span class="occ">composer and organist</span>, was born on 14 September 1833 at Birmingham, the eldest of the seven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/980/', "Samuel Bache (1804&#150;1876)")</script>, a Unitarian minister, and his wife, Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Higginson (<i>d</i>. 1855). From a very early age he showed extraordinary talent for music, learning the piano, organ, and violin. On the last instrument, which he studied with Alfred Mellon, he played in the orchestra at the Birmingham festivals of 1846 and 1847. Having decided to become a professional musician, he left school in the summer of 1849, and, after studying for a short time with the city organist of Birmingham, James Stimpson, went to London, and continued his studies with Sterndale Bennett. He became organist at All Saints' Church, Gordon Square, in October 1850, and in November his first overture was performed at the Adelphi Theatre.<br>
<br>From 1849 to 1853 Bache worked hard in London, teaching, studying, and, under contract to the publishing firm Addison, Hollier, and Lucas, composing numerous piano pieces. In October 1853 he went to study with Moritz Hauptmann in Leipzig, where he remained until the end of the following year; he returned to England in 1855 after short stays in Dresden and Paris. He then obtained an appointment as organist at Hackney, but was soon forced to give it up by illness. In 1856 he went to Algiers, where for a time the symptoms of his tuberculosis were alleviated. From Algiers he travelled through Paris <i>en route</i> to Leipzig, then, via Dresden and Vienna, to Rome, where he spent the winter. In June 1857 he returned to Britain, and passed the next winter at Torquay, but on his return to Birmingham in April 1858 his condition gradually worsened, and he died, at 44 Frederick Street, Edgbaston, on 24 August.<br>
<br>It is undeniable that Bache's potential was greater than his achievements; as a twentieth-century commentator remarked, &#145;Bache's early death deprived Victorian music of one of its most promising talents&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Grove</span>). But though much that he wrote was obviously the ephemeral and immature work of one whose powers were prevented from full development, some of his compositions show that he possessed considerable talent. His piano compositions evidence attractive spontaneity and polish in their essentially Mendelssohnian idiom; and similar traits, developed to a higher level, are encountered in his songs, especially those published as op. 16 (<i>c</i>.1850), which include settings of Uhland, Goethe, and Heine, and which constituted a significant contribution to the development of sensitive word-setting, on the German model, in nineteenth-century England.<br>
