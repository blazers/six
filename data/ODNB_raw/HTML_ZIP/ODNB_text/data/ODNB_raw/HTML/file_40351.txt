<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Munro,  Neil</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Hugh Foulis]</span>  (1863&#150;1930), <span class="occ">novelist and journalist</span>, was born on 3 June 1863 (and not 1864 as often stated) in Crombie's Land, Inveraray, Argyll. His mother was Ann Munro, a kitchen maid, perhaps at Inveraray Castle. His death certificate names John Thompson Munro, farmer, as his father, but despite the lack of any concrete evidence, it has been rumoured that his father was of the house of Argyll. Soon after his birth Neil and his mother moved to his grandmother Ann McArthur Munro's home in McVicar's Land, and in this Gaelic-speaking household he lived for most of his childhood. In 1875 his mother married Malcolm Thomson, prison governor.<br>
<br>Munro's formal education at Inveraray parish school under the scholarly Henry Dunn Smith was supplemented by his voracious appetite for reading. About 1877 he left school and became a clerk to William Douglas, a local lawyer, but found the work tedious and even then seems to have been preparing himself for a career in journalism. Like many young Gaels, however, he found no other satisfactory employment in the highlands and on 1 June 1881 he moved to Glasgow. There he soon became a reporter, working successively on the <span class="italic">Greenock Advertiser</span>, the <span class="italic">Glasgow News</span>, the <span class="italic">Falkirk Herald</span>, and, finally, the paper he was to remain with for the rest of his working life, the <span class="italic">Glasgow Evening News</span>, where he was made chief reporter under the editor James Murray Smith at the age of only twenty-three. In the meantime he had married Jessie Ewing Adam, daughter of Hugh and Euphemia Adam, on 23 July 1885.<br>
<br>Although a gifted journalist Munro believed this to be the inferior side of the writer's craft and sought to become a novelist, making his first mark on the literary scene in 1896 with his innovative collection of short stories <span class="italic">The Lost Pibroch and other Sheiling Stories</span>. In these powerful and somewhat bitter highland pieces he seeks to counteract&#151;perhaps too extremely&#151;the sentimentality of contemporary Scottish kailyard and &#145;Celtic twilight&#146; writing, and to portray the highlander accurately in a language which captures Gaelic idiom.<br>
<br>In 1897 Munro reduced his journalistic commitment to two anonymous weekly columns, &#145;The Looker on&#146; and &#145;Views and reviews&#146;, to allow himself to concentrate on his literary work, and in 1898 his well-judged romantic historical novel <span class="italic">John Splendid</span> appeared. Told from the Campbell point of view, it deals with the sack of Inveraray by Montrose and his subsequent victory over the Campbells at Inverlochy in 1645. Like most of Munro's novels it is set in a period of major social change, and analyses its effects on the highlands.<br>
<br>In 1899 the partly autobiographical novel <span class="italic">Gilian the Dreamer</span> was published. It deals with a young boy whose undisciplined poetic gifts manifest themselves in excessive sensibility and impede his maturity and his ability to act effectively. He has affinities with Tommy Sandys in J. M. Barrie's <span class="italic">Sentimental Tommy</span> (1896) and his failure to grow up properly makes him a kind of highland Peter Pan. This was followed by three tales, <span class="italic">Doom Castle</span> (1901), <span class="italic">The Shoes of Fortune</span> (1901), and <span class="italic">Children of Tempest</span> (1903), all loosely connected with the aftermath of the Jacobite rising of 1745.<br>
<br>Munro published a vast number of highly amusing sketches in his column &#145;The Looker on&#146;. For their publication in book form he used the pen name Hugh Foulis. These included stories about the waiter Erchie MacPherson and the commercial traveller Jimmy Swan, but most famous of all were his tales of the eccentric captain Para Handy and the crew of the puffer <i>The Vital Spark</i>. The first of these appeared in 1905, and he continued to produce them for most of his working life. Ironically, it is for these he was best remembered.<br>
<br>After <span class="italic">Children of Tempest</span> Munro felt that he had carried the theme of highland historical romance far enough and turned with <span class="italic">The Daft Days</span> (1907) and later <span class="italic">Fancy Farm</span> (1910) to the contemporary scene, but with far less success. In 1908 he was honoured with an LLD from Glasgow University, and in 1909 with the freedom of Inveraray. Not surprisingly, then, he returned to historical romance and in 1914 produced his finest novel, <span class="italic">The New Road</span>. Ostensibly this is the story of the hero's quest for information about his Jacobite father's mysterious death, but at a deeper level it examines the forces which shape individual destinies. Like Scott's <span class="italic">Waverley</span> (1814) it shows the hero's gradual disillusionment with the superficial glamour of the highlands as he begins to recognize many of the chiefs for the scoundrels that they are. Eventually he comes to believe that only by trade will the highlands ultimately be civilized, and that the instrument to achieve this will be the new road that Wade is building between Stirling and Inverness. This road becomes a symbol of a more civilized and prosperous way of life for Gaeldom but, at the same time, it will destroy the old Gaelic way of life for ever.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of the First World War Munro returned to full-time journalism. In 1915 his son Hugh was killed in France, near Albert. This trauma, coupled with the pressure of work on the <span class="italic">Glasgow Evening News</span>&#151;he became editor in 1918&#151;seemed to inhibit further large-scale literary production. From this time, apart from the short story collection &#145;Jaunty Jock and other Stories&#146; (1918), only the typescript of the first ten chapters of a novel entitled <span class="italic">The Search</span>, a sequel to <span class="italic">The New Road</span>, survives.<br>
<br>In 1927, in failing health, Munro reluctantly retired from the newspaper, where he was loved for his kindness and affability. In retirement he wrote a <span class="italic">History of the Royal Bank of Scotland</span> (1928) and articles for the <span class="italic">Daily Record and Mail</span>. In October 1930 he was honoured with a second LLD, this time from Edinburgh University. Munro died a few months later on 22 December, as the result of cerebral thrombosis at his home, Cromalt, in Craigendoran, Helensburgh, and was survived by his wife, one son, and four daughters. He was buried at Kilmalieu cemetery, Inveraray. In 1935, at the dedication of the monument erected to his memory in Glen Aray, R. B. Cunninghame Graham praised him as the &#145;apostolic successor of Sir Walter Scott&#146;.<br>
<br>Munro's high literary reputation declined after 1925 when he became the object of adverse criticism by C. M. Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid) who accused him of escapism and not dealing with the great national and highland issues of the day. Late twentieth-century scholarship, however, has shown that Munro's critique of highland life was much more penetrating than MacDiarmid had perceived.<br>
