<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Owen,  John</span>  (1854&#150;1926), <span class="occ">bishop of St David's</span>, was born at Ysgubor Wen, in the parish of Llanengan, Caernarvonshire, on 24 August 1854. His father, Griffith Owen (<i>d</i>. 1893), a weaver who prospered and became a wool merchant, was a Calvinistic Methodist and for many years a deacon of Bwlch chapel at Llanengan. Though he never deviated from his own loyalties, he watched his son's career as an Anglican with great pride. Owen's mother, Ann Jones from Aberdaron, could not easily reconcile herself to her son joining the church, nor could she wholly accept the fact that he married an English wife. Owen and his sister grew up in an intensely religious home; as a boy, he was learned beyond his years, and showed a particular liking for mathematics. His early education at the British School at Llanengan was extended at Botwnnog grammar school (1865&#150;9) under a sympathetic headmaster (known to the boys as Mr Jenkin) who appointed him, when he was only fifteen, as assistant master, largely so that he could prepare for entry to university. In 1872 he was awarded a mathematical scholarship at Jesus College, Oxford, where he read classics and mathematics, gaining a second class in classical moderations (1873) and in mathematical moderations (1874). To his great disappointment, he was again placed in the second class in the final school of mathematics, and he began to read for <i>literae humaniores</i>, hoping for a first, but he did not sit the examinations.<h2>
<a name="Religionandearlycareer"></a>Religion and early career</h2>As a pupil at Botwnnog, Owen was impressed by the fact that his headmaster, respecting his family background, did not oblige him to attend the parish church. When he became a teacher there he decided, in gratitude, to go to church regularly with the boys. Local Welsh clerics (notably James Rowland, rector of Botwnnog) fostered his interest, and at Oxford he came under the influence of A. M. W. Christopher (1820&#150;1913), rector of St Aldates. He was drawn towards ordination, but he decided to teach for a few years until he was sure of his vocation. He was assistant master at Appleby grammar school in Westmorland from 1877 to 1879. There he met Amelia (<i>b</i>. 1861/2), third daughter of Joseph Longstaff of Appleby; they were married on 4 January 1882. They had four sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>In 1879 Owen was persuaded to apply for the post of professor of Welsh at St David's College, Lampeter, and he committed himself in two respects: if appointed he &#145;would of course make a special study of Welsh&#146;, and he would hope to be ordained before, or soon after, joining the college. At that stage, much to his regret, Welsh was not included in the degree structure, but Owen combined his chair with some responsibility for teaching classics. He was confirmed and ordained deacon in 1879, and priest in 1880. At Lampeter he began to emerge as a publicist, engaging for the first time in controversy over the vexed question of disestablishment. After a brief tenure he was appointed warden of Llandovery in 1885, where his role was more overtly to encourage the Welsh traditions of that college. It was a comparatively small school with some eighty boys, and he made it his concern to attract more pupils and to recruit new staff on a generous scale. Before his work had had time to mature he was drawn away to new responsibilities.<h2>
<a name="DefendingtheChurchofEngland"></a>Defending the Church of England</h2>In 1889 Alfred Edwards, newly appointed as bishop of St Asaph, invited him to join him as dean&#151;the &#145;Controversial Dean of a Militant Bishop&#146;, as he was to be described in the <span class="italic">Liverpool Mercury</span>  (quoted in Owen, <span class="italic">Early Life</span>, 88). They had to face three major crises: the problem of tithes, the difficulties arising from changes in local government, especially in education, and the threat of disestablishment. Edwards regarded Dean Owen as his indispensable aide in the battle over tithes. As the market price of some cereals fell, the ability of many tenant farmers to pay tithes was reduced; as the value of tithe charges dropped, the clergy grew more impoverished. Resentment among Welsh nonconformists obliged to pay tithes to the church, and Welsh tenant farmers obliged to pay tithes to a church they regarded as English, exacerbated the conflict, especially in north Wales. Legal action taken by individual clerics against individual tenant farmers inflamed local feelings.<br>
<br>The presentation of a rational case and of statistical material, and the need to conduct the controversy with diplomacy in the current atmosphere of hostility and violence, demanded skills which Owen had in abundance. Through letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span> in the summer of 1890 he sought to win over opinion in England. Through public debate with the leader of opposition to tithes, Thomas Gee of Denbigh, conducted in August and September 1890, in Gee's Welsh newspaper, <span class="italic">Baner ac Amserau Cymru</span>, he sought to divorce the vexed issue of tithes from the major political issue of disestablishment. The remedy was found in the <span class="roman">Tithe-Rent Charge Recovery Act</span> of 1891 which removed the necessity for open hostility between cleric and tenant farmer by placing the liability for tithe upon the landlord, not upon the tenant. Bishop Edwards was deeply involved in the political negotiations which produced this act, but he recognized the indispensable help of his dean.<br>
<br>At St Asaph, Owen became increasingly involved in education. Despite some reservations, he gave a warm welcome to the <span class="roman">Welsh Intermediate Education Act</span> of 1889. Bishop Edwards castigated it as &#145;saturated with rigid undenominationalism&#146;  (Edwards, 178), but Owen argued persuasively and urged his fellow Anglicans to accept it. The act established a joint education committee for each Welsh county and a central committee for Wales and Monmouthshire. Owen was appointed to the Flintshire committee and to the central body. There he played a significant part in the development of the Central Welsh Board to supervise inspection and examinations in intermediate schools. His colleagues nominated him to serve on the charter committee of the University of Wales, established in November 1891, and that gave a new emphasis to his interest in higher education, and a new platform from which to press the claims of St David's College.<h2>
<a name="PrincipalofLampeter"></a>Principal of Lampeter</h2>In 1892 Owen returned to Lampeter as principal, an office he was to hold until he became bishop of St David's in 1897. There his income was augmented by the rectory of Llangeler, Carmarthenshire, a sinecure in the gift of the college. Bishop Edwards ensured that the close association between himself and the new principal should not be broken by appointing him to a residentiary canonry at St Asaph. In 1893 Owen fought a sustained battle to bring St David's College into the University of Wales. The plans for the creation of that university embraced the colleges at Aberystwyth, Bangor, and Cardiff. He was anxious that Lampeter should be included. It was already a college conferring degrees under royal charter and, for him, it was unthinkable that it should be excluded from the new university. By contrast, the advocates of the university were clear that Bishop Burgess's original plan for Lampeter had been to found a seminary in which young men could be trained for the ministry, and that identified it as a theological college which must stand as any other denominational college in relation to the new university. In January he argued his case strenuously but unsuccessfully in the charter committee. In June he petitioned the privy council, and his petition was rejected. In the autumn his influence lay behind a debate in the House of Lords, where Lampeter's case was upheld. But Gladstone refused to be moved, and the University of Wales was given its royal charter, with St David's firmly excluded. Shrugging off his defeat, Owen secured in 1896 a new charter for Lampeter which established a college council with wide powers, and which re-affirmed that the college had been founded &#145;to receive and educate any person whatsoever, whether destined for Holy Orders or not&#146;.<h2>
<a name="AvoidingWelshdisestablishment"></a>Avoiding Welsh disestablishment</h2>In the last years of the century, two threats to Welsh Anglicans were checked. In 1893 H. H. Asquith introduced a <span class="roman">Suspensory Bill</span> which would have prevented the creation of any new vested interests in the Welsh dioceses. In effect, on any future disestablishment, appointments made during the interim would not have counted for any compensation. Owen was responsible for briefing Lord Randolph Churchill who spoke vehemently and effectively against the bill, which failed to secure a second reading. In 1894 Asquith went further and introduced a bill to disestablish the Welsh church. In the ensuing campaign Owen faced some difficult audiences but, as he acknowledged, opposition was always a greater stimulant to him than approval. In the event, Lord Rosebery's unexpected resignation removed the immediate danger.<h2>
<a name="BishopofStDavids"></a>Bishop of St David's</h2>In January 1897 William Basil Jones, bishop of St David's, died and within six weeks John Owen had been named as his successor. The death of the dean of St David's and the appointment of a new dean delayed Owen's consecration until May. That was the beginning of a notable episcopate. The sheer size of St David's, the largest diocese in England and Wales, created problems for its diocesan. Bishop Jones, austere and aloof, had administered his diocese efficiently with the help of his suffragan, John Lloyd, consecrated bishop of Swansea in 1890. Lloyd continued to serve under Bishop Owen, who appointed as his successor Edward Latham Bevan of Brecon. From 1915 Bevan was largely responsible as bishop for Brecknockshire and Radnorshire.<br>
<br>Sir John Llewellyn, one of the most active and forthright laymen in the diocese, welcoming Owen in Swansea, rejoiced that a cold withdrawn scholar should have been replaced by a man of warm sympathy. Free from controversy for a few vital years, Owen could concentrate on his diocese, getting to know his clergy and resolving a number of local problems. He renewed an earlier attempt to deal with clerical poverty, raising large sums of money, and setting (though not achieving) a target of a minimum stipend of &pound;200.<br>
<br>In April 1903 the bishop's palace at Abergwili was largely destroyed by fire. Bishop Owen and his family escaped, but it was a disaster which overshadowed his later years. The cost of rebuilding left him heavily in debt, and the immediate strain contributed to a marked decline in his health. Even while he was warden of Llandovery, long hours of work and little exercise left him with recurrent nervous exhaustion, but then (as on later occasions) he recovered quickly. Late in 1903 he suffered a breakdown which made work impossible. From 1904 until 1914 a relaxed summer holiday in Switzerland became an essential part of his routine. Ill health remained a problem. He was seriously unwell in 1920, and again in 1924 and 1925.<br>
<br>Much of Owen's episcopate was marked by controversy. For many years he was involved in conflict over church schools and the place of religious instruction in schools. The <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1902 gave county councils the responsibility for financing elementary education. Subject to clear conditions, church schools qualified for rate-aided status, but this gave great offence to nonconformists. Lloyd George used this discontent to advantage in Wales where some county councils, including Carmarthenshire, refused to use rates to maintain church schools. A long legal and parliamentary battle ensued before the council was obliged to give way. Between 1907 and 1911 Owen was involved in another long but ultimately successful conflict with the local education authority in Swansea over the funding of church schools in the town.<br>
<br>From 1902 to the last years of Owen's life the question of religious education in state schools was a recurrent problem. Churchmen defended the need for doctrinal teaching, others insisted on undenominational teaching. From an early date Bishop Edwards had been convinced that a concordat was the most practical solution, and he was concerned to negotiate an agreed compromise. Owen defended a stronger line, seeking to maintain a firm doctrinal approach. He was converted to the value of a concordat in the 1920s, only to find in 1924 that he could not persuade the governing body of the Church in Wales to accept the necessary compromise.<br>
<br>Confrontations never frightened Owen, and he acquired the reputation of being &#145;a battling bishop&#146;, but he had many gifts as a negotiator. He liked always to work closely with his associates, consulting them at every stage, and adjusting the wording of formal statements and of his own speeches to meet their point of view. In negotiation he looked for common ground and respected the standpoint of his opponents. He liked to have clear in advance what was to be proposed and agreed in formal meetings. He disliked unexpected shifts in policy and the development of new lines of thought in public discussion. He believed firmly in strong political action and knew the value of giving full and accurate briefing to the politicians who were prepared to speak in defence of his case.<h2>
<a name="Welshdisestablishment"></a>Welsh disestablishment</h2>All these qualities were constantly in demand in the long conflict over disestablishment. Pressure on Welsh Anglicans was maintained throughout the 1890s, with Gladstone himself speaking in favour of disestablishment in 1892 and bills introduced in 1894 and 1895. In 1906 a royal commission on the Welsh church began to collect evidence, and Welsh bishops were thrown on the defensive. Owen was a leading figure in collecting material for the church and the evidence he presented to the commission filled seventy pages of the final report (1910). In 1909 government intentions were made clear in a <span class="roman">Disestablishment Bill</span> which made little progress, but in 1912 a similar bill passed through the Commons but was rejected in the Lords. It had to wait for the <span class="roman">Parliament Act</span> of 1911 to take effect before it was reintroduced to be passed without hindrance in 1914. In this long process, Owen became the leading spokesman for the Welsh church. In the first half of 1912 he spoke at seventy public meetings in England and ten in Wales. He was constantly in demand to consult with and advise leading politicians.<br>
<br>Once the Welsh church had been disestablished Owen played a leading part in securing the <span class="roman">Welsh Church Temporalities Act</span> of 1919 which modified parliament's original financial settlement, and he contributed to dealing with the practical problems of organizing the new Welsh province. In private correspondence there was a suggestion that he should become the first archbishop, but he refused to consider it. In Easter week 1920, he presided over the election of Bishop Edwards as the first archbishop of Wales.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsanddeath"></a>Final years and death</h2>Owen's last important task was to secure the division of the diocese of St David's. For more than twenty years, schemes for smaller dioceses centred on Brecon, Swansea, and possibly Aberystwyth had been canvassed. After disestablishment they had to be modified, if only because of financial pressure. The influential churchmen of Swansea were reluctant to be severed from St David's. But the plan for a diocese combining Swansea and Brecon offered the best chance of reducing the burden of the bishop's work and of creating a viable new bishopric. In 1923 it was adopted, and the province had to elect a new diocesan. Owen was convinced that his suffragan, Bishop Bevan, should be chosen; he had been an effective suffragan and he knew much of the area well. There was one major difficulty: he could not speak Welsh. For that reason Archbishop Edwards was consistently and implacably opposed to his appointment, and the electoral college was deeply divided. Owen was not to be moved. He continued firm in his support for Bevan, who was elected by the narrowest of margins.<br>
<br>By that time it was becoming clear that John Owen's strength was failing. He relied more heavily on younger colleagues. As late as 1924 he was asked by the Board of Education to chair a committee to examine the use of Welsh in education, but he did not live to see its report, which was published in 1927. He held his own until the summer of 1926, but in the autumn he confided to a friend &#145;I am taking off my armour.&#146; He died after a short illness on 4 November in a nursing home at 19 Manchester Street, St Mary, London, and was buried on 9 November at Abergwili, Carmarthen. In his cathedral church at St David's there is a recumbent effigy in the lady chapel. Photographs capture his characteristic stance, but he was essentially a modest man and no portrait of him was painted.<br>
