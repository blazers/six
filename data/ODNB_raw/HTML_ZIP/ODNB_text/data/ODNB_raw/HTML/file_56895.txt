<span class="headword">Stern,  Bertha Gladys</span>  (1890&#150;1973), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, who wrote under the name G. B. Stern, was given the name of the paternal grandmother who died in the week her newest granddaughter was born. She was known as Gladys as a child, later substituted Bronwen for Bertha, and was called Peter by her friends (but Tynx by Rebecca West). She was born at home on 17 June 1890 at 99 St Mark's Road, North Kensington, London; the family home was later nearby at 42 Ladbroke Road, Notting Hill. She was six years younger than her sister Clara May (later Mrs Malden). Her father, Albert Stern, was a German-born trader and her mother was Elizabeth (formerly Elise) Schwabacher (1859&#150;1939), whose family had left Vienna for London in 1872; her maternal grandfather was a Rakonitz, the name appropriated for the family in the &#145;matriarch&#146; novels. It was a comfortable childhood dominated by &#145;the family&#146; and<blockquote>the approved standards of that particular little clump of German-Jewish families dwelling in Hampstead and Bayswater; a high-minded and affluent little clump &hellip; some of It was German, and lots of It was Jewish (mildly, not aggressively so) &hellip; and It regarded the most secret affairs of every single member of It as common property. (Stern, <span class="italic">Pantomime</span>, 24, 26)</blockquote>The walks in Kensington Gardens, the nannied summers in Kent at Broadstairs, ended in 1904 with the Vaal River diamond smash and Gladys began &#145;eleven years of nomad existence&#146;  (Stern, <span class="italic">Monogram</span>, 265) in hotels and furnished flats. Educated from April 1898 to July 1907 at Notting Hill high school, at day school in Wiesbaden, Germany, and at finishing school at Montreux, Switzerland, she attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London from April 1908 to June 1909.<br>
<br>G. B. Stern wrote plays from the age of eight, published her first poem aged seventeen and aged twenty-four her first book: <span class="italic">Pantomime</span> was light-heartedly autobiographical about the heroine's shock when her fianc&eacute; confesses to a mistress: for the family's &#145;women were all cultured, elegant&#151;and as ignorant of realities as canaries in a cage&#146;  (Stern, <span class="italic">Pantomime</span>, 24). In 1919 came <span class="italic">Children of No Man's Land</span>, about a young man's discovery that he had been born in Germany (&#145;I don't <i>like</i> Germans &hellip; I'm English&#151;like other chaps&#146;  (p. 79). In that year G. B. Stern married Geoffrey Lisle Holdsworth, a good-looking but mentally unstable New Zealander who was a friend of No&euml;l Coward, &#145;whom she helped to select the nostalgic period-songs used in <span class="italic">Cavalcade</span>&#146;  (Kunitz and Colby). They lived in Italy for six years, in a house among the olive groves of Diano Marina in Liguria, but were divorced at the end of the 1920s and Stern never used his name. <span class="italic">Tents of Israel</span> (1924; <span class="italic">The Matriarch: a Chronicle</span> in the United States) was the first of a series about the family and its Viennese matriarch (based on G. B. Stern's great-aunt Anastasia Schwabacher). It was dedicated to John Galsworthy. This novel, and the sequels, <span class="italic">A Deputy was King</span> (1926), <span class="italic">Mosaic</span> (1930), <span class="italic">Shining and Free</span> (1935), and <span class="italic">The Young Matriarch</span> (1942), are the works for which G. B. Stern will be remembered, describing as they do<blockquote>that easy and opulent Jewry which, rooted in Central Europe, was robustly at its ease wherever its fortunes carried it, to the south of France, to South Kensington, to the East Sixties in New York, wherever there was good talk, good food, good humour. (Golding, &#145;Stern&#146;)</blockquote>In 1929 Mrs Patrick Campbell starred in the stage version; indeed much of G. B. Stern's work was for the theatre (she wrote several plays) or about it&#151;notably <span class="italic">Little Red Horses</span> (1932), one of her best novels. She had many theatrical friends, but was also a friend of writers such as Rebecca West (whose sharp tongue&#151;or pen&#151;often wounded her sensitive friend), Somerset Maugham, and Pamela Frankau. Her closest male friends for many years were the playwright John Van Druten and his friend Jack Cohen.<br>
<br>G. B. Stern wrote nearly fifty novels, short stories, two books about Jane Austen with Sheila Kaye-Smith, and a great deal of journalism (always dictating to a succession of put-upon secretaries). In her later work &#145;she became professionally competent and vivacious [but] often too studiously light and amusing&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 20 Sept 1973). She had homes in London, Cornwall, New York, Hollywood (where she wrote film scripts in 1933), the south of France and, after the late 1940s, Mill Brook Cottage, Blewbury, Berkshire. Her London home was destroyed by a bomb in 1940; later she had rooms in London at A4 Albany, Piccadilly. In 1947 she became a Roman Catholic and described this in <span class="italic">All in Good Time</span> (1954). <span class="italic">And Did he Stop and Speak to You?</span> (1958) consists of sketches of, among others, Max Beerbohm, Ronald Knox, and John Betjeman. Five volumes of autobiographical philosophizing (1936&#150;56) were all curiously uninformative about herself: &#145;Miss Stern has a &#147;profound interest&#148; in wine, wolf-dogs, talking, ping-pong, and collecting walking-sticks&#146;  (Kunitz and Colby). &#145;Swift, rich, radiant, extravagant&#146;  (Golding, <span class="italic">Borzoi</span>, 92), in later life she was &#145;formidable, rather manly &hellip; normally dressed in black&#146;  (<span class="italic">Betjeman: letters</span>, 69). Perhaps something of an outsider, it is likely that G. B. Stern lived to regret her detachment from the family that had once been her security; but she could not forget that &#145;resentments remained&#151;against the continental quality of it all, the loudness, the insistence on family duty, and on the superior treatment accorded to males&#146;  (Neuberger, xv). G. B. Stern died on 18 September 1973 at St Mary's Hospital, Wallingford, Berkshire, of bronchial pneumonia after a stroke. She was buried in the cemetery near her home at Blewbury.<br>
