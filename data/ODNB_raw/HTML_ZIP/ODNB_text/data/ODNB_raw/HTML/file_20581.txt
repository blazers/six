<span class="headword">Ogden,  Samuel</span>  (1627/8&#150;1697), <span class="occ">ejected minister and schoolmaster</span>, was born at Fowleach, Oldham, the son of John Ogden, a yeoman, and attended school for three years at nearby Littleborough. He was admitted at Christ's College, Cambridge, on 4 May 1648, aged twenty, under the supervision of Samuel Ball, fellow of Christ's College from 1644 to 1651. Ogden graduated BA in 1651 and on 6 January the following year married Hester (or Esther) Barnett, sister of Joshua Barnett, curate of Over Darwen, Lancashire, who had been educated under John Ball of Whitmore, Staffordshire, the father of Samuel Ogden's tutor. William Bagshawe, the Apostle of the Peak, who became friends with Ogden after meeting him at a lecture at Saddleworth, praised Hester, &#145;who being the Daughter of a good old Nonconformist, when in a single State, shone as a Star of the first Magnitude, among Matrons near Ouldam&#146;  (Bagshaw, 98).<br>
<br>Also in 1651 Ogden was instituted as curate of Buxton, a chapelry attached to the church of Bakewell, Derbyshire, at the meagre stipend of &pound;8 per annum. On 17 September 1652 the committee for plundered ministers ordered that tithes of Great and Little Huckley in the parish of Hope, worth &pound;10, &#145;sequestered from Rowland Eyre, papist and delinquent and the tithe corn and hay of Buxton and Blackwell in the said county, sequestered from the Earl of Newcastle delinquent, impropriator thereof &hellip; amounting in the whole to the yearly sum of &pound;32 13 4d&#146; should &#145;be from henceforth continued and paid unto Mr Samuel Ogden, minister of the said chapel&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.190). This area came within the jurisdiction of the Wirksworth classis. Having presented testimonials as to his fitness for the ministry and having preached before the classis at Brassington on 15 September 1653, Ogden was ordained at Wirksworth on 27 September by Robert Porter, Thomas Shelmerdine, Martin Topham, Edward Pole, John Oldfield, Samuel Moore, and Thomas Miles. The following year he was presented by John Manners, eighth earl of Rutland, to the chapelry of Fairfield, but it appears there was resistance, for it proved necessary for Ogden to travel to London, and to present his claim to the commissioners for approbation, who granted their consent on 23 October 1654. In May 1658 Ogden settled at Mackworth, Derbyshire, acting as vicar and schoolmaster there.<br>
<br>Ogden was hostile to restoring the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. He &#145;thought the idolising the Common Prayer, and placing all Religion in it, was a provocation to the good spirit of God&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.196). After his ejection in 1662 he continued to make entries in the parish register for some months. His successor was instituted on 9 June 1663, but Ogden continued to teach at Mackworth until in 1666 he was compelled by the <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span> to move his operations first to Yorkshire and then to Markeaton, near Derby. In 1669 &#145;Mr Ogden late of Marton [Markeaton] by Derby&#146; was reported to be preaching at Little Ireton &#145;every Lord's day at the house of Colonel [Thomas] Saunders&#146; where &#145;200, 300, 400 at a time&#146; were said to congregate  (Turner, 1.49). On 8 May 1672 he was licensed as a presbyterian preacher for this house. Throughout this period Ogden seems to have been able to continue teaching, possibly in his own house. Rachel Ogden, one of three daughters known to have survived their father, married Zachary Merrill, who acted for many years as the usher of his school and kept a notebook detailing his methods. Ogden's evident success eventually provoked the master of the free school at Derby to a law suit. When the court of arches found against him in 1685, Ogden was forced to desist from teaching at Marton. From 1686, through the patronage of Sir John Gell and, according to Bagshawe, with the collusion of &#145;Persons Dignified in the Church&#146;, he became master of the free school at Wirksworth  (Bagshaw, 98). In 1689 he took the oaths under the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> at Derby quarter sessions and his house at Wirksworth was certified as a meeting-place.<br>
<br>Ogden was by no means a narrow, stereotypical puritan. He was knowledgeable about anatomy, medicine, and botany:<blockquote>and took delight in algebra, trigonometry, and the several parts of mathematics. He was acquainted with some of the greatest men of the age in that science and taught his scholars &hellip; to charm them into a love of those studies &hellip; And he was used to observe that very few good mathematicians were lewd and scandalous. He was a great lover of music, both vocal and instrumental. He was also well versed in Natural Philosophy, and very ready in the Cartesian scheme &hellip; He took great delight in poetry, and especially in Latin verse, and did so even to his old age. (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.193)</blockquote>In 1697, as Calamy explains, &#145;being of a melancholy disposition, and apt to be incumbered with troublesome fears about dying, it pleased God he was on a Lord's day seized with a palsy, as he was in the pulpit&#146;  (ibid., 197). He died a few weeks later, on 25 May 1697, and was buried in the church at Wirksworth two days later. Bagshawe, who also observed the melancholy with which &#145;this Dear Brother was more than touched&#146;, remembered his friend as &#145;a burning as well as shining light&#146;, &#145;one of another (and choicer) Spirit than many in the Ministry are&#146;  (Bagshaw, 97).<br>
