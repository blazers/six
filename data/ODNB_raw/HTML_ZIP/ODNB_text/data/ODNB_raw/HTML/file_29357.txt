<span class="headword">Widdrington <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Cook]</span>,  Samuel Edward</span>  (1787&#150;1856), <span class="occ">writer on Spain</span>, was the eldest son of Joseph Cook (1759&#150;1844) of Newton Hall, Morpeth, Northumberland, vicar of Chatton and Shilbottle, and sufficiently acquainted with the duke of Northumberland to ask him to be a sponsor for his son. His mother, Sarah Brown, the daughter of E. Brown, was a great-niece and coheir of Nathaniel Widdrington of Hauxley in Northumberland. Samuel Cook entered the navy on 31 December 1802 and saw service in the English Channel, notably in the vicinity of the Camp de Boulogne, where Napoleon was then amassing a flotilla for his projected invasion of England. Cook was later sent to the West Indies, where in June 1805 he obtained special mention for his conduct in the capture of the felucca <i>La Concepci&oacute;n</i>. On 10 July 1809, after further service off the coast of Cayenne and Surinam, he was appointed lieutenant to the <i>Fame</i> (74 guns). On 16 September 1813, when under the command of Captain Edward Reynolds Sibly in the sloop <i>Swallow</i>, he led a successful attack on the <i>Guerri&egrave;re</i>, a French brig, in the neighbourhood of Port d'Anzo in Tuscany. He later served with Captain Charles Dashwood in the <i>Windsor Castle</i> (74 guns), on which, in May 1824, when at Lisbon, Dom Jo&atilde;o VI of Portugal took refuge from his son Dom Miguel, who was putting pressure on him to abdicate. In consequence, Cook was presented by Dom Jo&atilde;o with the Portuguese Order of the Tower and Sword, and was promoted to the rank of commander. Wearing this insignia he sat for a portrait by the Sevillian artist Jos&eacute; Gutierrez de la Vega which was later hung at Newton Hall, Morpeth. He retired from the service shortly after. It would appear that mineralogy and botany were subjects closer to his heart than the navy.<br>
<br>Although he refers to having known Spain from his earliest youth, it was not until 1829 that Cook made his first extensive tour of the country, where he was to remain for over three years. It is difficult from his descriptions to reconstruct the order of his excursions, mostly made from Madrid; but with the possible exception of Richard Ford, whom he met in Seville, Cook explored more remote districts of Spain than any other visitor. Accompanied by Sir Charles Lyell, the geologist, he also made an excursion into the central Pyrenees. While in Madrid, he had shown particular interest in the new mineralogical department added to the museum of natural history. Before leaving Spain he sent home a collection of geological sections together with fir-cones of various species (from which were grown two trees still standing at Newton Hall in the 1990s), and also a number of paintings by Spanish artists, among them a St Catherine by Zurbar&aacute;n, which he had acquired, for he considered himself a connoisseur. On 18 September 1832, not long after his return to England, Cook married Dorothy, second daughter of Alexander Davison of Swarland Park, Northumberland. In 1834 his <span class="italic">Sketches in Spain during the Years 1829, 30, 31, and 32</span> was published, and, in 1838, <span class="italic">Observations on the Present State of the [Carlist] War</span> written from a whig point of view. He also published papers on botany.<br>
<br>In 1840 Cook assumed the surname of Widdrington. He was a fellow of the Royal Society and of the Royal Geographical Society. In October 1842 he revisited Spain, and, <i>en route</i> to Andalusia, inspected the phosphorite deposits at Logros&aacute;n, the paintings by Zurbar&aacute;n at neighbouring Guadalupe, and the cinnabar mines of Almad&eacute;n. On the return journey Widdrington traversed the Asturias and Galicia, provinces he had not explored previously. At Oviedo he met Schultz, a German professor of geology and mining, and remarked on the &#145;unsaleable&#146; remains he had seen of a consignment of testaments left by George Borrow, whose missionary activities he gratuitously criticized. Widdrington sailed home from Vigo, relieved after having been officiously interrogated at both Santiago and Pontevedra by the police, who, suspicious of his activities, had accused him of &#145;examining buildings&#146;, which was true enough.<br>
<br>Richard Ford, when acknowledging the invaluable assistance he had received from him while compiling his <span class="italic">Handbook for Travellers in Spain</span> (1845), described Widdrington as &#145;a great geologist and stalker of little birds and fat women, a tall, stiff man, with a sort of philosophical hat&#146;, and as a writer &#145;dry, painstaking and accurate &hellip; [who] understands the people better than the pictures. There he breaks down lamentably &hellip; and does not know a Murillo from a mainmast&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Richard Ford</span>). Nevertheless, Widdrington's <span class="italic">Spain and the Spaniards in 1843</span> (1844), the result of his second tour, was reviewed sympathetically by Ford, who remarked that &#145;every page discovers good sense, observation, and earnestness, a love of the beautiful and a single-hearted desire to obtain and impart correct information &hellip; and like the former [book], must ever be reckoned among the classical works on Spain&#146;  (<span class="italic">QR</span>, 1846).<br>
<br>Widdrington died childless at Newton Hall on 11 January 1856, and was succeeded in his estates by his nephew, Shallcross Fitzherbert Jacson, son of his sister Frances, who also assumed the surname of Widdrington.<br>
