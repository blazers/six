<span class="headword">Pettigrew,  Thomas Joseph</span>  (1791&#150;1865), <span class="occ">surgeon and antiquary</span>, was born on 28 October 1791 at 128 Fleet Street, London, son of William Pettigrew (1739&#150;1825), surgeon&#150;apothecary, a Scot and former naval surgeon, and his second wife, Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Cranford). Thomas showed an interest in anatomy from the age of twelve. He attended a local school until the age of fourteen, assisted his father for two years in his duties as surgeon to St Bride's parish, and was then apprenticed to the surgeon John Taunton. He attended the United Borough Hospitals' medical schools and assisted Taunton as demonstrator in his anatomy school. In 1808 he was one of the founders of the City Philosophical Society, later the Philosophical Society of London. Also in 1808 he was elected a fellow of the Medical Society of London and in 1809 he published his first book, <span class="italic">Views of the Basis of the Brain and Cranium</span>, a precocious work which attracted suspicions of plagiarism&#151;the first of many controversies. In 1811 he married Elizabeth Reed (1786&#150;1854). They had twelve children, of whom five sons and three daughters reached adult life. Two of the sons followed their father into the medical profession.<br>
<br>In 1812, at Taunton's instigation, Pettigrew was elected secretary of the Medical Society of London, defeating the eminent physician George Birkbeck, a contest which led to some subsequent ill feeling. He also took on the post of registrar with residential accommodation at the society's house in Bolt Court, Fleet Street, but forgoing the salary. He qualified as MRCS in 1812. In 1813, through the influence of the Medical Society's founder, John Coakley Lettsom, Pettigrew became secretary to the Royal Humane Society, holding the post until 1820 and in 1818 receiving the society's medal for life-saving. On Lettsom's death in 1815 Pettigrew delivered a eulogy before the Philosophical Society of London, printed in 1816, and in 1817 produced <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life and Writings of the Late John Coakley Lettsom</span>, in three volumes. From 1816 to 1819 he was surgeon to the Dispensary for the Treatment of Diseases of Children, St Andrew's Hill, Doctors' Commons, later the Royal Universal Dispensary for Children. In 1818 he left the Medical Society and moved to 22 Spring Gardens.<br>
<br>Through his connection with the Royal Humane Society, Pettigrew was appointed surgeon to the duke of Kent and vaccinated his daughter Princess Victoria. He also became surgeon to the duke of Sussex and, in 1819, his librarian. Under the duke's influence he was initiated as a freemason. The first volume of an ambitious catalogue of the duke's library, <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Sussexiana</span>, was published in two parts in 1827, containing the religious manuscripts and printed editions of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Pettigrew's reward was a doctorate in philosophy from the University of G&ouml;ttingen, conferred on 7 November 1826. Meanwhile his professional career continued: in 1819 he became surgeon to the Asylum for Female Orphans, a post which he retained until 1848, and in 1822 surgeon to the Royal West London Infirmary and Dispensary which in 1827 became the Charing Cross Hospital. He published regularly in the medical journals and in 1819 delivered the annual oration of the Medical Society of London, on medical jurisprudence (MS in Wellcome Library). In 1824 he moved to 8 Savile Row, where he later held popular soir&eacute;es. His connection with the duke of Sussex came to an untimely end. Pettigrew, who had been elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1827, was involved in the negotiations leading to the controversial election of the duke as president on the resignation of Davies Gilbert in 1830. The duke found the unexpected contest embarrassing and soon afterwards severed relations with Pettigrew, following his repetition of the duke's private comments about an unsuccessful fellowship candidate. Pettigrew was never restored as librarian but a partial reconciliation made possible publication of volume 2 of the <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Sussexiana</span> in 1839. In 1835 Pettigrew also lost his position at Charing Cross Hospital on a charge of receiving &pound;500 from John Howship for securing him the post of assistant surgeon, though Pettigrew in his <span class="italic">Address to the Governors and Subscribers of the Charing Cross Hospital</span> (1836) maintained that the payment was part of an agreement for the sharing of anticipated fees. Thereafter he devoted himself to private practice and, increasingly, to his antiquarian interests.<br>
<br>Pettigrew had been interested in Egyptology since the 1820s; he published in 1834 <span class="italic">A History of Egyptian Mummies</span> (having himself unrolled numerous specimens) and in 1842 the first part only of <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Aegyptiana</span>. In 1836 he published <span class="italic">The pauper farming system: a letter &hellip; on the condition of the pauper children of St James Westminster</span>. As a diversion after the death of his eldest son, Thomas Lettsom, an officer in the Madras army, in 1837 he compiled <span class="italic">The Medical Portrait Gallery</span> (4 vols., 1838&#150;40), including his own autobiography. He also contributed 540 biographies to H. J. Rose's <span class="italic">A New General Biographical Dictionary</span> (12 vols., 1840&#150;57), and in 1849 published <span class="italic">The Life of Vice-Admiral Lord Nelson</span>, in two volumes. He was appointed to the council of the Historical Society of Science in 1840 and to the council of the Percy Society in 1841. In 1843 he was elected one of the first fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons and over the years was elected to various foreign medical and antiquarian societies. His publications in medical history include <span class="italic">On Superstitions Connected with &hellip; Medicine and Surgery</span> (1844) and an edition for the Percy Society of John Halle's <span class="italic">An Historiall Expostulation Against the Beastlye Abusers both of Chyrurgerie and Physyke</span> (1844). He had been an active fellow of the Society of Antiquaries since 1824 and was one of the founders of the British Archaeological Association in 1843, serving as treasurer until his death and allowing meetings to be held at his house. He declined an offer of the presidency in 1854.<br>
<br>Pettigrew continued to court controversy: in 1852 his <span class="italic">Letter to the Lord Viscount Mahon</span> criticized the management of the Society of Antiquaries, and in 1854 he successfully defended his conduct at the British Archaeological Association against an attack by Thomas Hugo. His antiquarian writings appeared mainly in periodicals. A revised edition of Richard Gough's <span class="italic">Sepulchral Monuments</span> was projected in 1852 but abandoned on grounds of cost. His last book was <span class="italic">Chronicles of the Tombs</span> (1857). On the death of his wife in 1854 he retired from practice and moved to 16 Onslow Crescent, Brompton, London. He continued to attend the British Archaeological Association's annual conferences, in spite of failing health, but made only a token appearance at Durham in 1865. Pettigrew died at his home on 23 November 1865 and was buried on 30 November at Brompton cemetery. His library was sold at Sothebys on 10 May 1866. There had been an earlier sale on 13 February 1856, and a final sale at Knight, Frank, and Rutley on 23 August 1905 included his collections of paintings, engravings, Egyptian antiquities, shells, and minerals, as well as books and manuscripts.<br>
