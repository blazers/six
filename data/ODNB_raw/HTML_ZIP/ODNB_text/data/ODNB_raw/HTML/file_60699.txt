<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Elssler,  Fransiska <span class="st"> [Fanny]</span></span>  (1810&#150;1884), <span class="occ">dancer</span>, was born in a suburb of Vienna, Austria, on 23 June 1810, the seventh of the nine children of Johann Florian Elssler (1769&#150;1843), valet and copyist to Haydn, and his wife, Theresia Prinster (1779&#150;1832), an embroideress. Many stories circulated about her youth, the veracity of which cannot be established, among them that Fanny and her sister Therese were the natural daughters of Prince Esterh&aacute;zy, in whose service their grandfather had worked, and that they had begun their studies at the scandal-ridden Kinderballet at the Theater an der Wien. Fanny's name appeared on the playbill of the K&auml;rntnertortheater on 20 April 1818, and she was also on stage at the same theatre on 10 June 1822, when her future rival Marie Taglioni made her d&eacute;but. By 1825 the impresario Barbaja was sufficiently impressed with her progress to introduce the blue-eyed, auburn-haired dancer to audiences in Naples. There she had a liaison with the elderly Leopold, prince of Salerno, whose son, Franz Robert, she bore in 1827, thereby earning an annuity of 3000 ducats.<br>
<br>Elssler rapidly became one of the stars of European ballet under the patronage of Friedrich von Gentz, a friend of Metternich. Her career was not impeded by a series of affairs with prominent men and the births of two further children; indeed, she had danced at the King's Theatre, London, in <span class="italic">Flore et Z&eacute;phyr</span> with Taglioni on 27 April 1833 while pregnant with her third child. She took up residence in London in 1834 with her sister Therese; Count D'Orsay squired them about the town. The two women made their d&eacute;but in <span class="italic">Faust</span> on 9 March 1834, but were soon engaged by Louis V&eacute;ron of the Paris Op&eacute;ra, where Fanny first appeared in <span class="italic">La temp&ecirc;te</span> on 15 September. Charles Maurice of <span class="italic">Le Courrier</span> described her &#145;astonishing strength &hellip; rich <i>pointes</i> &hellip; abundance of <i>entrechats</i> &hellip; [and] much suppleness&#146;  (quoted in Guest, <span class="italic">Fanny Elssler</span>, 63).<br>
<br>Elssler's position as a serious rival to Taglioni was established in 1836 when she enjoyed a sensational success in <span class="italic">Le diable boiteux</span>, introducing her celebrated dance, the chachuca. The performance earned her ecstatic reviews from Th&eacute;ophile Gautier, who described her somewhat hermaphrodite beauty and spectacular technique. In <span class="italic">La tarentule</span> and <span class="italic">La Gypsy</span> she revealed great pantomimic ability, although her appearance in Taglioni's favourite role, <span class="italic">La sylphide</span>, was less successful. Gautier compared the two dancers, finding Taglioni a Christian, religious dancer, appreciated by women, and Elssler a pagan dancer, full of the pleasures of life, and appealing most strongly to men. He did, however, suggest that she paint her nails a less vivid shade of pink. Both Elssler and Taglioni were in London for the brilliant season of the coronation year, 1838, and in 1840 Elssler danced at her own benefit before Queen Adelaide, Queen Victoria, Prince Albert, and Louis Napoleon.<br>
<br>In 1840 Elssler set off on a tour of the United States, arranged by her current lover, the marquis de la Valette, and a future one, the American Henry Wikoff. She left her daughter, Therese, in the care of George and Harriet Grote, who had befriended her. Her tour, which included New York, Richmond, Charleston, and Boston, was a great success. The enthusiasm of her reception, and the size of the fees she commanded, caused her to overstay her leave of absence from the Paris Op&eacute;ra and embroiled her in a prolonged and acrimonious dispute: she never danced in Paris again. She remained in America with Wikoff until July 1842, when she returned to London and peremptorily removed her daughter from the Grotes (although she was soon to be abandoned with them again). Elssler broke off with Wikoff, claiming that he had stolen from her; rumour had it that he had also beaten her. She took up instead with the wealthy Count Samuel Klostrowicki, who offered her marriage, which she refused. Despite her two-year absence and the arrival of a new star, Fanny Cerito, Elssler was rapturously received on her return to the London stage, in <span class="italic">Giselle</span> at Her Majesty's Theatre.<br>
<br>Elssler spent some four years in Italy, where she danced one of her most celebrated roles, <span class="italic">La Esmerelda</span>, to great applause, and in 1848 went to Russia, where she was also triumphant, despite the initial hostility of the Russian ballet establishment. She announced her retirement at St Petersburg in 1850, and at her final performance of <span class="italic">La Esmerelda</span> took forty-two curtain calls.<br>
<br>With a collection of caged birds and her devoted cousin and companion, Katti Prinster, Elssler proceeded to enjoy her retirement, first in Hamburg and then in Vienna. The rift with the Grotes was eventually healed, and all were pleased with the marriage in 1859 of Elssler's daughter Therese, whose own daughter was named after her grandmother. The death of Therese in 1870, the suicide of Elssler's son in 1875, and the death of her sister Therese (who had become the morganatic wife of Prince Adalbert of Prussia) in 1878 saddened her last years. Elssler died at her home in Seilerst&auml;tte, Vienna, on 27 November 1884 and was buried in the Heitzing cemetery.<br>
<br>According to her <span class="italic">New York Times</span> obituary (28 November 1884), Elssler had been long forgotten by the time of her death; if this was ever so, her eclipse was soon over. A stream of biographies memorialized her life and talents, as did an operetta (1936), a ballet (1934), and a film by Paul Martin (1936).<br>
