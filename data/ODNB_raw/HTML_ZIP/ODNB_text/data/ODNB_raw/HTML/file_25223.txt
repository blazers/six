<span class="headword">Sharp,  William</span>  (1805&#150;1896), <span class="occ">physician and homoeopathist</span>, third son and fifth child of Richard Sharp, merchant, and his wife, Mary Turton, was born at Armley, near Leeds, on 21 January 1805. His family had lived in that neighbourhood and at Horton, near Bradford, for several generations. One relation was John Sharp (1645?&#150;1714), archbishop of York; another was Abraham Sharp (<i>bap</i>. 1653, <i>d</i>. 1742), the astronomer and mathematician. William Sharp was educated at Wakefield grammar school from 1813 to 1816, and at Westminster School, London, from 1817 to 1820.<br>
<br>Originally destined for the church, Sharp was articled in 1821 to his uncle, William Sharp, a leading surgeon in Bradford. He subsequently served a part of his apprenticeship with his uncle's cousin, William Hey of Leeds. Sharp went to London to complete his training at Guy's and St Thomas's hospitals. In 1826 he obtained the licence of the Society of Apothecaries, and in 1827 he was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. He spent a year in Paris at the Sorbonne before returning to Bradford to assist his uncle, to whose practice he succeeded in 1833. Sharp was elected a surgeon to the Bradford Infirmary in 1829, and became its senior surgeon in 1837; for many years he also had the largest general practice in the West Riding of Yorkshire. In 1856 the degree of MD was conferred upon him by the archbishop of Canterbury.<br>
<br>During the winter of 1838&#150;9 Sharp gave a course of scientific lectures, which were so successful that he proposed the revival of the Bradford Philosophical Society, originally formed by Joseph Priestley. He was elected as the first president of the new society, whose principal aim was the formation of a local museum, a subject in which Sharp had a particular interest. The museum which was eventually opened in Bradford was the first of its kind in the country. A paper read to the Birmingham meeting of the British Association on the subject of local museums led to Sharp's election as FRS on 7 May 1840.<br>
<br>In 1843 Sharp left Bradford for Hull, where he lived until 1847. He then moved to Rugby so that his sons could attend Rugby School. Sharp convinced Dr Tait, the headmaster, of the value of the teaching of natural science. As a result he was appointed as the school's first &#145;reader in natural philosophy&#146;. He thus became the first teacher of science in a public school, setting the example which other schools followed. He resigned the post in 1850, to devote himself more exclusively to medical research.<br>
<br>At the suggestion of his friend Dr Ramsbotham of Leeds, Sharp next studied homoeopathy, and two years later adopted its methods. While he accepted the basic principle of &#145;like cures like&#146; he had little time for Samuel Hahnemann, the founder of homoeopathy. Many of his contemporaries were unable to accept Hahnemann's explanatory theories but Sharp went much farther. In his <span class="italic">Letter to Sir Benjamin Brodie</span> (1861) he described Hahnemann as &#145;a visionary, unscientific mind&#146;, and in his essay entitled <span class="italic">Organopathy</span> (1867) he stated that &#145;Homoeopathy, as represented by Hahnemann, is vague, indefinite and unproved&#146;. For Sharp, disease was local. He rejected Hahnemann's proposal that most disease was a general condition and concluded that Hahnemann's drug provings had accumulated numerous unnecessary symptoms. According to Sharp, drugs must affect the same organs as the disease affects. This, he said, was &#145;organopathy&#146;. His alleged discovery that drugs in different doses caused different therapeutic effects gave rise to the allied method of &#145;antipraxy&#146;. Both these systems were described in Sharp's <span class="italic">Essays on Medicine</span> (1874&#150;80). In 1873 Sharp presided at the British Homoeopathic Congress, but his address, which focused on his own ideas, was virulently criticized when reported in the <span class="italic">British Journal of Homoeopathy</span>.<br>
<br>By his own account Sharp played an important part in preventing the inclusion, in the <span class="roman">Medical Act</span> of 1858, of proposals that would have prevented the registration of homoeopathic doctors. He wrote brilliantly in defence of homoeopathy but could not avoid including in that defence his own personal theories. Whether by accident or by design, he ignored the work of most homoeopaths who had practised before him. He seemed to regard himself as the saviour of homoeopathy, as if nothing significant had happened before his arrival in 1852.<br>
<br>Sharp retired from practice in 1877. He continued to write tracts on homoeopathy, which finally totalled sixty-three works, the first twenty-four of which were collected and published in his <span class="italic">Essays on Medicine</span>. He also learned Hebrew in order to study the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in its original. When the Revised Version was published he submitted several criticisms which were accepted by the editors.<br>
<br>Sharp was married in 1833 to Anne (1811&#150;1834), daughter of the botanist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11875/', "Samuel Hailstone (1767&#150;1851)")</script>. After her death he married on 10 March 1836 Emma, sixth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24896/', "John Scott")</script>, vicar of St Mary's, Hull [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24919/', "Scott, Thomas")</script>]. Sharp died at 4 South Parade, Llandudno, Wales, while on a visit to Llandudno, on 10 April 1896, and was buried at Llan-rhos cemetery.<br>
<br>Sharp's claim to recognition rests on his encouragement of the teaching of science in schools and for the establishment of local museums. His medical theories were not accepted by the homoeopathic medical community of his time and have passed into oblivion. His apparent view of himself as the saviour of homoeopathy, and indeed of medicine, appears to reflect a personality similar to that which he criticized in Hahnemann. It is regrettable that the energies of one who had so much to contribute were sometimes so sadly misdirected.<br>
