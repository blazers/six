<span class="headword">Vassall <span class="st"> [<em>later </em>Phillips]</span>,  (William) John Christopher</span>  (1924&#150;1996), <span class="occ">Admiralty official and spy</span>, was born on 20 September 1924 at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, where his father, William Vassall, was a long-serving chaplain and his mother, Mabel Andrea Sellicks, was a nurse. Educated at a boarding-school at Seaford in Sussex, he went to Monmouth School at the age of thirteen. His obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> noted that he was &#145;a mediocre scholar with no enthusiasm for games, [though] he had the reputation as the best-dressed boy in the school, but also acquired the nickname &#147;Serf&#148;, for his servility towards his elders and eagerness to please&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). At the age of seventeen he volunteered for the Royal Air Force, but was rejected. He also failed to get into Keble College, Oxford. After jobs in a City branch of the Midland Bank and as a temporary clerk in the Admiralty he was conscripted into the Royal Air Force in 1943 and trained as an RAF photographer, serving with 137 wing in western Europe. After the war he joined the civil service and in 1948 gained a posting with the Admiralty. In 1952, at the height of the cold war, he was sent to Moscow on the staff of the naval attach&eacute;: although a very lowly employee, he grandly described himself on his business cards as &#145;junior attach&eacute;&#146;, and was rebuked for turning up at social occasions thought to be too elevated for his grade.<br>
<br>Unsurprisingly Vassall was unhappy with the protocol and snobberies of embassy life and sought friends outside. A homosexual at a time when such practices were unlawful in Britain and the Soviet Union, he was vulnerable to entrapment by the KGB. He made the acquaintance of a Pole named Mikhailsky, who introduced him to the secret world of homosexual Moscow. It was at a party in 1954 that he was photographed in a variety of compromising positions. There followed a classic entrapment, with the KGB using threats of exposure, which quickly gave way to flattery and financial inducements. From 1954 until his arrest in 1962 Vassall supplied his Soviet controllers with an unceasing flow of documents, first from the Moscow embassy, then from the Admiralty in London. His treachery inflicted untold damage as, at various times in his career, he had access to critical information. At the time Vassall claimed that he did not regard his actions as espionage. He never, for example, thought of confiding in the British ambassador or the naval attach&eacute;, whom he considered cold, aloof, and forbidding: curiously the ambassador later said he would have arranged for Vassall to be returned home, &#145;as had been done in one or two other cases&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>).<br>
<br>Back at the Admiralty, Vassall's lifestyle began to outstrip his civil service income. He took a flat in Dolphin Square, Pimlico, and started to wear Savile Row suits and take foreign holidays. Eventually the lifestyle brought him to the attention of the authorities and a secret raid at his flat uncovered a range of incriminating evidence. That another spy had been uncovered at the heart of the British state led to a scandal that destabilized the Macmillan government a year before the Profumo affair led to the downfall of the prime minister. A range of security issues were raised, and after the trial of the hapless Vassall&#151;most of which was heard <i>in camera</i>, and which ended with an eighteen-year sentence&#151;the Radcliffe inquiry was established to investigate. The inquiry did not achieve any concrete results, except the gaoling of two journalists, for refusing to reveal their sources, and a former junior minister at the Admiralty. A former political correspondent of the <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span> called the tribunal &#145;a massive cover-up&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 6 Dec 1996).<br>
<br>Vassall had converted to Roman Catholicism in 1953, and was regularly visited by Lord Longford. He was released ten years into his sentence, and spent some time in a monastery, writing a volume of self-serving memoirs  (<span class="italic">Vassall</span>, 1975) in which he described himself as a &#145;pygmy of a spy&#146;. He changed his name to Phillips, found a job as a clerk with the British Records Association, and lived for the rest of his life in quiet obscurity in London's St John's Wood. He died of a heart attack on 18 November 1996 in St Mary's Hospital, Praed Street, Westminster, and was cremated; it was not until nearly three weeks later that his death came to the attention of the press.<br>
