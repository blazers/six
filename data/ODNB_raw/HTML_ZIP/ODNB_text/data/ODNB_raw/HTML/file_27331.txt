<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thorburn,  Grant</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Lawrie Todd]</span>  (1773&#150;1863), <span class="occ">entrepreneur and author</span>, was born at West Houses, near Dalkeith, Edinburghshire, on 18 February 1773, the son of Elizabeth Fairley (<i>d</i>. 1776) and James Thorburn, a nailmaker. His mother died when he was three years old and his subsequent neglect left him physically undersized. In 1792 he joined the Friends of the People, a group committed to reforming parliament by more equal representation, and in the winter of 1793, along with seventeen others, was held in Edinburgh as &#145;a suspicious person&#146;, but dismissed. In 1794 he emigrated to New York, where at first he worked at the nailmaking trade. In 1796 he and his brother started a hardware business, which presently became Thorburn's sole concern. In June 1797 he married Rebecca Sickles, with whom he had a son. Rebecca died in 1800, and in 1801 Thorburn married Hannah Wortemby (<i>d</i>. 1852). By this year the introduction of cut-nails forced him to abandon his trade and he opened a grocery store which he stocked with flowering plants. From this he developed a seed business and in 1812 issued the first seed catalogue in America, <span class="italic">The Gentleman and Gardener's Kalender for the Middle States of North America</span>. Although faced with such set-backs as fire, crop failure and imprisonment for debt, he re-established his business in 1816, and thereafter it prospered.<br>
<br>From his youth Thorburn believed that he was under the care of a special providence, and his &#145;self-help&#146; autobiography, <span class="italic">Forty years' residence in America, or, The doctrine of a particular providence exemplified in the life of Grant Thorburn</span> (1834), while it is meant to justify this theory, reveals that he was an extraordinarily resilient character whose unflagging optimistic outlook turned many of his failures into successes.<br>
<br>Thorburn first became widely known as the model for the hero of John Galt's <span class="italic">Lawrie Todd, or, The Settlers in the Woods</span> (1830). Now financially independent, Thorburn wrote articles and sketches for newspapers and magazines. Noted for his energy, originality, candour, and wide interests, many of these are humorous and &#145;folksy&#146; pieces on current affairs. Some give accounts of his meetings with famous radicals such as Thomas Muir (with whom he was imprisoned in Edinburgh) and Thomas Paine, while others recount his experiences in the wake of the yellow fever outbreak in New York in 1798. Among the most interesting works of this dedicated republican is his <span class="italic">Men and manners in Britain, or, A bone to gnaw for the trollopes, fiddlers, &amp; c., being notes from a journal on sea and land, 1833&#150;4</span> (1835), a caustic response to Frances Trollope's <span class="italic">Domestic Manners of the Americans</span> (1832), in which he pronounces on the savagery of English history, the servility of English shopkeepers, and the profound ignorance of the British about America, but the work is also invaluable for Thorburn's more serious observations of British culture in that period, in particular his sense of social and cultural change in his native Scotland. His other works include <span class="italic">Fifty Years' Reminiscences of New York</span> (1845), <span class="italic">Sketches from the Note-Book of Lawrie Todd</span> (1847), <span class="italic">Lawrie Todd's Hints to Merchants, Married Men, and Bachelors</span> (1847), <span class="italic">Notes on Virginia, with a Chapter on Puritans, Witches and Friends</span> (1848), and <span class="italic">Lawrie Todd, Life and Writings of Grant Thorburn</span> (1852). His second wife died in 1852, and in 1853 he married Maria, with whom he moved from New York to Winsted, Connecticut, and then to New Haven, where he died on 21 January 1863. He was buried in New Haven.<br>
