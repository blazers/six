<span class="headword">Mitchell,  Jean Brown</span>  (1904&#150;1990), <span class="occ">geographer</span>, was born on 26 July 1904 at 396 Lower Broughton Road, Manchester, the elder of the two daughters (a son died in infancy) of James Mitchell (1866&#150;1908), a veterinary surgeon, and his wife, Margaret Brodie Cowan (1877&#150;1911). After six years at Macclesfield high school, she went to Cambridge in 1923 as an outstandingly able undergraduate to read for the newly established geographical tripos and graduated with first-class honours. She then lectured at Bedford College, London, before returning in 1931 to her undergraduate college, Newnham, as a research fellow. Later she became a fellow and college lecturer, and from 1945 until her retirement in 1968 she was a university lecturer in geography.<br>
<br>Jean Mitchell's intellectual inclinations were those of the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century naturalists. Endowed with a thirst for knowledge, she allied a sharp eye with a rigorously logical and precise mind. She saw geography as a discipline in which observation and analytic comparison could yield a description and understanding of variation in the earth's features. For her, geographical practice was grounded in observation: &#145;Let one thing be said at the outset and borne in mind throughout, it [geography] must be studied at first hand, on the ground itself&#146;  (Mitchell, 3). Physical geography was her first love, but when constraints of serious illness redirected her research into historical geography her talents found full expression. In unravelling the human geographies of the past her quick eye sought out both natural and man-made features. Her &#145;ground&#146; included old maps and records. She would explore England by car&#151;and had travelled most of the roads, even tracks, from England to Scotland. She developed a shrewd knowledge of English architecture and of atlases and rare prints. For recording her observations she became an adept photographer.<br>
<br>Jean Mitchell set out her creed in her influential <span class="italic">Historical Geography</span> (1954), a volume in the <span class="roman">Teach Yourself Geography</span> series. The book follows themes in the human geography of England and Wales, showing why topics repay historico-geographical attention and indicating sources and their use. Apart from this, she mainly contributed to compilations, including the 1938 and 1965 volumes prepared for the Cambridge meetings of the British Association. As one of the geographers in Cambridge during the Second World War she wrote part of the volumes of the naval intelligence division geographical handbooks covering Greece (1944&#150;5). But it was rather by the superb quality of her teaching and by sharing her geographical insights in the field that Jean Mitchell influenced generations of geographers. True to her own precept that &#145;geography like charity should begin at home&#146;, she concerned herself much with East Anglian landscapes. Excursions became legendary for the variety of information conveyed, the vividness of the interpretation, the stamina displayed and demanded. Small in physique, Jean Mitchell could outlast most of her audience and outface them too if need be: &#145;Out of the bus. The rain won't hurt you. Skin is waterproof.&#146; Through these excursions she passed on her message not only to undergraduates (to whom she was strongly committed) but also to lecturers from the colleges of education and her academic peers.<br>
<br>Jean Mitchell helped to establish the reputation of geography as an academic discipline in Cambridge University and also formed part of the national geographical scene; she served as a member of the council of the Royal Geographical Society from 1951 to 1952 and 1958 to 1961, but Cambridge was her centre. Unmarried, and valiantly combating frequent bouts of severe ill health, she lived in college, unstintingly giving it, and also the department of geography, her loyalty and her time. In this she was a characteristic daughter of her generation. She was not a natural committee woman but was enthusiastically devoted to her students and to caring for and enhancing Newnham's fabric and its artistic contents. She was a generous benefactor to the college. Her interest in antique silver gave opportunities to exercise her discerning eye and taste, and she built for herself a small but fine collection of Scottish silver. Her working life was spent in England, but Scotland, where her parents had come from, remained her spiritual home. She retired to Edinburgh, and died at the Royal Victoria Hospital there on 5 January 1990. She was buried in Mortonhall cemetery, on 10 January.<br>
<br>As memories of her teaching fade, <span class="italic">Historical Geography</span> stands as a lasting testament to Jean Mitchell's qualities. It embodies many of the characteristics of its author: small in size, vigorous, erudite, exemplarily clear in argument, and imbued with enthusiasm, honesty, and humanity.<br>
