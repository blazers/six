<span class="headword">Le Squyer,  Scipio</span>  (1579&#150;1659), <span class="occ">record keeper and antiquary</span>, was the eldest son of Edmund Le Squyer (<i>d</i>. 1620) (third son of George Squyer), later rector of King's Nympton, Devon, and his wife, Martha, second daughter of Mark Slader of Bath. He left home for London in 1597, and was a student at an inn of chancery, New Inn, for four years from 1599. In 1603 he became marshal of his fellow Devonian John Doddridge (later Sir John and justice of king's bench). Before 1620 Le Squyer married Frances, third daughter of Sir Hugh Brawne; they had at least two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>While retaining his marshal's position until Doddridge's death in 1628, in 1620 Le Squyer entered crown service as one of the two deputy chamberlains in the receipt of the exchequer. He apparently continued as a deputy chamberlain until 1655, when, with essentially unchanged duties, he was appointed one of the two chamberlains of the exchequer and keeper of its records. The officers gained some of their fees from those wishing to consult <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> and other records in their custody; it was a matter at their discretion whether to index or calendar the records. Le Squyer was as active in this side of his work as had been his predecessor and friend, Arthur Agarde, and about twenty volumes of his abstracts and calendars survive (JRL). In 1627 he was granted an extra &pound;10 p.a. for his &#145;extraordinary service and charges in sorting, ordering and digesting&#146; the contents of the Westminster treasuries. In April 1643 he was acting escheator of Devon and Cornwall.<br>
<br>Le Squyer also had a disinterested fascination with the records of the middle ages, especially those of the west country. He was a friend of such antiquaries as Sir Robert Cotton (with whom he swapped medieval manuscripts and from whose collection he copied extracts), Sir Simonds D'Ewes, and Sir William Dugdale, who thanked him as &#145;a gentleman of great knowledge in Antiquities and a special furtherer of this worke&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Antiquities of Warwickshire</span>, 1730, 913).<br>
<br>A more general indication of Le Squyer's interests is given by the catalogue of his library, which he drew up in 1632 when he had just moved house to Long Acre, Covent Garden. Quite apart from over 200 manuscripts, many heraldic or about Devon and some medieval, he owned nearly 500 printed books, including about 130 each of &#145;theological&#146; and &#145;historical&#146; works, over seventy works of &#145;Poesy&#146; and over forty of &#145;Morality&#146;. He had made his own translations of one of the &#145;Psalms and Prayers&#146; of Cardinal John Fisher (although his theological books show a puritan tendency) and of &#145;The life and death of Edward II&#146;, and he had part of the original manuscript of the <span class="italic">Advancement of Learning</span> by Francis Bacon.<br>
<br>By 1656, Le Squyer had married his second wife, Elizabeth. He died in September 1659 and was buried in Westminster Abbey; in his will he had requested that he should be buried near to Agarde's monument there. Elizabeth Le Squyer survived her husband.<br>
