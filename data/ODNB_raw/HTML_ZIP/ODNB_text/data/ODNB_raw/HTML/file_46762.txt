<span class="headword">Cary,  Henry</span>, fourth Viscount Falkland  (<em>bap. </em>1634, <em>d.</em> 1663), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Burford Priory, Oxfordshire, and baptized at Burford on 21 November 1634, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4841/', "Lucius Cary, second Viscount Falkland (1609/10&#150;1643)")</script>, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66709/', "Lettice Cary, n&#233;e Morison (c.1612&#150;1647)")</script>. He was educated at Hayes in Middlesex by Dr Thomas Triplett. On 14 April 1653 he married Rachel (<i>bap</i>. 1637, <i>d</i>. 1718), daughter of Anthony Hungerford of Blackbourton, Oxfordshire, and his wife, Rachel (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones). Cary, who succeeded as fourth Viscount Falkland following the death of his older brother Lucius at Montpellier in September 1649, shared his parents' royalist sympathies: in 1650 he travelled for a while in France, and in 1654 he was secretly commissioned as a colonel with John Talbot. The council of state monitored his movements, and in July 1656 granted him a pass to travel to France with four servants. The following October William Lockhart, the ambassador in Paris, informed the secretary of state, John Thurloe, that he regarded Falkland as &#145;a greater enemy to himself (by reason of his extravagant debawches) then to any else&#146;  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 5.520). It is possible that such behaviour helps to explain a reference to an earlier &#145;miscarriage &hellip; in Hyde Park&#146; in May 1653  (<span class="italic">CSP dom., 1649&#150;63</span>, 322).<br>
<br>Nevertheless, Falkland sat as a member for Oxfordshire in the third protectorate parliament (1659). There was initially a double return for the county but this was resolved in Falkland's favour. He consistently opposed the recognition of the &#145;Other House&#146; as a house of parliament, and reportedly argued on 28 March that &#145;if we own them as another House they will say, they are the other House, in place of the Old Peers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Burton</span>, 4.281). On 5 April he was teller against a motion to include the phrase &#145;both Houses of Parliament&#146; in the title of a declaration appointing 18 May as a day of public fasting and humiliation, while on 6 April he was appointed to a committee to consider &#145;the manner of transacting with the Other House&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 7.627). On 14 April he was teller for an unsuccessful motion for Mr Grove to take a declaration concerning the fast to the Other House and return without waiting for an answer. On 12 April he was appointed to a committee to prepare impeachment articles against Major-General William Boteler following a complaint that the latter had illegally distrained the property of the late Sir Thomas Hatton. Falkland claimed that he had personal experience of Boteler's methods, and alleged that he &#145;robbed me, and keeps my goods to this day&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Burton</span>, 4.406). On 18 April he was appointed to a committee to prepare security measures following reports that some were arming against parliament in the City of London.<br>
<br>After the parliament was dissolved in late April, Falkland became involved in plans for a royalist rising, and on 12 August 1659 he was arrested and sent to the Tower, where he remained until November. When the council of state ordered his house at Great Tew to be searched, eleven or twelve cases of pistols, six or seven swords, twenty powder horns, and a bag of bullets were discovered there. In February 1660 he was among those Oxfordshire gentry who signed a declaration to General George Monck calling for a free parliament. The following month he was appointed a justice of the peace and a commissioner for the militia for Oxfordshire.<br>
<br>Following the restoration of the king, Falkland was appointed a colonel of horse in June 1660. He was also appointed to further offices in Oxfordshire, notably lord lieutenant (July 1660) and commissioner for assessment (August 1660). He became a gentleman of the privy chamber in June 1660 and a privy councillor for Ireland in July 1662. In the Convention Parliament (1660&#150;61) he was returned for both Arundel (Sussex) and Oxford, and chose to sit for the latter. In that parliament he served on twenty-eight committees and made seventeen recorded speeches that suggest strong royalist and Anglican sympathies. On 7 May he was among the twelve members chosen to attend the king in Holland. When Falkland returned, he delivered a letter to the house from the king at Canterbury, and was appointed colonel of a regiment of horse. He took a strong line towards the regicides, and argued that any member who had sat in the high court of justice should be excluded from the house. Regarding individual parliamentarians, he wished to make William Sydenham and John Pyne liable for any penalty short of death, and he opposed the limited punishment proposed for Francis Lascelles. On 24 August he was sent to the Lords to desire a free conference on those regicides who had surrendered themselves following the proclamation of the king. On 7 December Falkland moved that estates acquired during the civil wars and interregnum should be forfeit, and he clearly resented the more magnanimous aspects of the Restoration settlement. Similarly, on religious matters, Falkland opposed the imposition of the oaths of allegiance and supremacy on Roman Catholics, and supported Sir Allen Brodrick's motion &#145;to leave the doctrinal part to a synod&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 4.79). Falkland supported the Worcester House declaration, with its proposal for a modified episcopacy, but was opposed to the granting of a &#145;liberty for tender consciences&#146;.<br>
<br>Falkland served as MP for Oxfordshire in the Cavalier Parliament that met in May 1661, and in the next two years he was appointed to a total of thirty-six committees. His royalist and Anglican attitudes continued to be clearly apparent. On 17 May 1661 he was teller for a resolution to burn the solemn league and covenant, which he then carried up to the Lords. He strongly supported the claims of the former royalist, John Paulet, fifth marquess of Winchester, for compensation from Robert Wallop's estate, and he helped to bring in the <span class="roman">Militia Bill</span> that affirmed the crown's powers over the armed forces. Roger Morrice described Falkland as &#145;a most violent, indefatigable promoter of the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>&#146;, and recorded that in the debate on the uniformity bill he caused a stir by declaring that &#145;popery came in with such a full torrent upon us that upon my consideration we that have all in land shall not have time left us to compound for that [e]state&#146;. Such strong language prompted a proposal that he be called to the bar, but it was thought better to draw no further attention to a member &#145;that can speak excellently well and [cares] for no man&#146;. However, Falkland was not appointed to the committee on the uniformity bill, and Morrice added that he &#145;was all his time after under a cloud and looked upon as a dangerous person both by those in the court and the parliament that were in the Council&#146;  (Morrice, 1.112). It was consistent with Falkland's vehement support for the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> that, as lord lieutenant, he was energetic in his persecution of Oxfordshire nonconformists.<br>
<br>Falkland was appointed colonel of foot in the Dunkirk garrison in 1661, and when his regiment was disbanded in October 1662 he was appointed captain of a troop of horse in Ireland. He was also elected to the Irish parliament in 1662, where Edward Cooke described him as &#145;the hornet &hellip; in the House of Commons &hellip; to sting all&#146; those in opposition to the government. Cooke also observed that Falkland had &#145;grown grave as well as severe&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fifteenth Report</span>, HMC, appendix, part 7, p. 165). On his return to England in October 1662 Falkland was appointed to the committees to consider the defects of the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> and to bring in a bill to prevent the growth of popery. But before he was able to contribute further, Falkland died in London on 2 April 1663, and was buried at Great Tew on 9 April. He apparently died intestate, and the prerogative court of Canterbury granted letters of administration to his widow on 1 July 1663  (TNA: PRO, PROB 6/38, fol. 81<i>v</i>), his heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58100/', "Anthony Cary")</script>, who succeeded as fifth viscount, being still a boy. According to his father's great friend Edward Hyde, earl of Clarendon, Falkland's &#145;hearte was broke, with the pure despayre of his fortune &hellip; He was a worthy and a right honest man, and when a little age had worne away some heates and passyons, he would have prooved an extraordinary man&#146;  (Clarendon to Ormond, 11 April 1663, Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 47, fol. 44<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Falkland was the author of one play, a tragedy set in Castile entitled <span class="italic">The Mariage Night</span>, which was licensed posthumously on 16 October 1663, and printed in 1664. In its treatment of the themes of tragedy and revenge, the play shows some Shakespearean influences, and may also have owed a certain debt to Cyril Tourneur's <span class="italic">The Revenger's Tragedy</span> (1607). Pepys saw the play performed on 21 March 1667, and described it as &#145;a kind of a tragedy, and some things very good in it, but the whole together, I thought, not so&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Samuel Pepys</span>, 21 March 1667). An edition of the play was published in volume 10 of Robert Dodsley's <span class="italic">Select Collection of Old Plays</span> (12 vols., 1744&#150;5) and as part of an updated version of Dodsley's collection in 1876 (<span class="italic">Select Collection of Old English Plays</span>, ed. Hazlitt, 15.109&#150;83). Falkland's widow twice remarried, one of her husbands being Sir James Hayes (<i>d</i>. 1693). She died at Bedgebury in Kent on 24 February 1718.<br>
