<span class="headword">Wedderburn, Sir  Peter</span>, Lord Gosford  (<em>c.</em>1616&#150;1679), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was the third and youngest son of James Wedderburn (1589&#150;1627), town clerk of Dundee, and Margaret, daughter of James Goldman, merchant of Dundee, and a younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28953/', "Sir Alexander Wedderburn")</script>. He was educated at St Andrews University, graduating MA in 1636. He was admitted advocate on 19 January 1642, beginning a successful legal career. He represented Dundee, becoming &#145;town's agent&#146; in 1648 and a burgess in February 1657. The covenanting revolution and the Cromwellian period acted as a temporary brake on his career, his royalist sympathies leading to a brief imprisonment in 1645 and fines under Cromwell's <span class="roman">Act of Grace</span> of 1654.<br>
<br>The Restoration, however, led to preferment and public service. On 28 August 1660 Wedderburn was appointed clerk to the privy council and keeper to the signet. In January 1661 he was knighted and the same month began a long parliamentary career as commissioner for Haddingtonshire, representing the shire in parliaments and conventions of estates until 1674, and sitting on various important committees. On 17 June 1668 he became an ordinary lord of session, taking the title Lord Gosford after his estates at Haddington. At the same time he resigned as clerk of the privy council to concentrate on his legal duties. While in the early 1660s he was allied to secretary of state Lauderdale against the earl of Middleton, Wedderburn was largely removed from the subsequent political tension that dogged the Lauderdale administration.<br>
<br>Wedderburn's collection of the decisions of the court of session from 1 June 1668 until July 1677 was considered authoritative. No ordinary judge, Mackenzie of Rosehaugh described him as a judge &#145;whose deeds were prompted by truthfulness, and whose law was directed by justice and sympathy&#146;  (Wedderburn, 1.364), and his surviving portrait reflects a mood of integrity. He married three times: first, on 1 February 1649, Christian Gibson, with whom he had a son who died young; second, on 20 October 1653, Agnes, daughter of John Dickson of Heartrie, with whom he had five sons and four daughters; and third, on 15 June 1677, Elizabeth Goldman, with whom he had no children. He was succeeded by his sons John (<i>d</i>. 1688) and Peter (<i>d</i>. 1746), who took the name of Halkett. His will and testament has not survived but he was a wealthy man. Though his estates at Gosford, Haddingtonshire, were purchased in 1659 with the help of his uncle Sir John Wedderburn, physician to Charles I, from 1660 he went on to acquire numerous properties in the counties of Haddingtonshire, Renfrewshire, Forfarshire, and Edinburghshire. He died at Gosford on 11 November 1679.<br>
