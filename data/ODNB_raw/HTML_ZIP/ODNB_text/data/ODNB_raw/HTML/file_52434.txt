<span class="headword">Richter,  Hans <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Johann Baptist Isidor]</span></span>  (1843&#150;1916), <span class="occ">conductor</span>, was born on 4 April 1843 at Raab, Hungary, the sole survivor of the four children of Anton Richter (1802&#150;1854), an organist and choirmaster, and Josefine Czasensky (1822&#150;1892), an opera singer and singing teacher. When his father died Richter was sent to Vienna as a choirboy in the Imperial Chapel and then to the conservatory. He graduated in 1862, joined the K&auml;rthnerthor theatre as a horn player, and in 1866 was sent to Wagner to copy the score of <span class="italic">Die Meistersinger</span>. In June 1868 he assisted at the opera's premi&egrave;re, and his musical versatility even enabled him to replace an indisposed singer at a performance. For a year he conducted in Munich, but in August 1869 he was sacked by King Ludwig for refusing to conduct Wagner's <span class="italic">Das Rheingold</span> (the staging was poor). Instead he went to Brussels to conduct the premi&egrave;re there of <span class="italic">Lohengrin</span>. In 1871 he became music director at the Pest Opera, where he exerted a new musical discipline and raised standards. He stayed until 1875, when he went to Vienna. On 27 January 1875 he married Mariska von Szitanyi (1854&#150;1926), a singing pupil, and by 1882 they had six children. In the period 1875 to 1900 Richter increasingly dominated the musical life of Vienna as music director of the Vienna Philharmonic, as first Kapellmeister at the court opera, as Kapellmeister at the court chapel, and as conductor of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde from 1884. He gave world premi&egrave;res of symphonies by Brahms and Bruckner and Tchaikovsky's violin concerto, and championed Dvo&#345;&aacute;k, who dedicated his sixth symphony to the conductor.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Wagner's festival at Bayreuth began in 1876 with the first staging of <span class="italic">The Ring</span> cycle, which Richter conducted under the composer's supervision. To recoup its financial losses, Wagner's London supporters organized a festival at the Royal Albert Hall in 1877, when the composer's conducting so confused the orchestra that Richter took over most of the programmes, and had great success with both players and public alike. He returned in 1879 to conduct the first of what became the annual Richter Concerts, which for twenty-three years took place in the summer and/or autumn at St James's Hall and (after 1893) the Queen's Hall. His programmes were dominated by Wagner and Beethoven&#151;the season usually concluded with the &#145;Choral&#146; symphony&#151;and orchestra and chorus were reconstituted annually, though they invariably had the same personnel. During these visits he toured with the orchestra throughout Britain. He was a fastidious orchestral trainer and a hard taskmaster, whose ear and eye missed nothing; such musical discipline and lack of rostrum showmanship had hitherto rarely been encountered. Because of Richter's reputation in and influence upon the musical life of London and Vienna, it became vital for the careers of solo instrumentalists and singers to appear under his baton and for composers to get their new works performed by him. Richter duly obliged with compositions by Parry, Stanford, Mackenzie, Cowen, and Elgar, whose <span class="italic">Enigma Variations</span> were first heard in June 1899. From 1885 to 1909 he led the Birmingham triennial festival, and in 1900 conducted Elgar's <span class="italic">Dream of Gerontius</span> there. In 1904 he gave a London Elgar festival, an unprecedented tribute to a living composer. After his own Richter Concerts ended in 1902 he formed a close association with the new London Symphony Orchestra, which he conducted in its first concert in June 1904 and in his own last concert, at Eastbourne in April 1911.<br>
<br>Richter loved the music of Wagner, whose operas from <span class="italic">Rienzi</span> to <span class="italic">The Ring</span> he conducted in both Vienna and London. From 1888 to 1912 he conducted either <span class="italic">Die Meistersinger</span> or <span class="italic">The Ring</span> at Bayreuth, and he gave the first <span class="italic">Die Meistersinger</span> (1882) and <span class="italic">Tristan und Isolde</span> (1884) in England. In 1903 he conducted at Covent Garden in the first of many German seasons, culminating in 1908 and 1909, when he gave <span class="italic">The Ring</span> in English, hoping (in vain) to develop an English National Opera. He took over the Hall&eacute; Orchestra in 1897, moving to Manchester in 1900 from Vienna, and introduced Strauss, Sibelius, Bart&oacute;k, Debussy, and Glazunov to his programmes. He retired to Bayreuth in 1911 where he died on 5 December 1916. He was buried there on the 7th.<br>
<br>Despite Richter's gruff manner, his players and audiences alike held him in awed respect and genuine affection. His impact on British concert life was explosive, for his expectations of playing standards and demands for accurate orchestral scores and parts were unprecedented. Nineteenth-century conductors, often regarded by contemporary critics as mere time-beaters, were generally also composers or performers, but Richter, with his prodigious memory, his talent for playing every musical instrument except the harp, and his ability to make his players give of their best, concentrated solely on conducting and, although he made no recordings, built for himself an enduring international reputation.<br>
