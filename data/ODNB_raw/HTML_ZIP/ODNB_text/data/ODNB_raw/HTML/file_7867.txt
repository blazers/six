<span class="headword">Douglas,  Archibald</span>  (<em>c.</em>1540&#150;<em>c.</em>1602), <span class="occ">conspirator and Church of Scotland minister</span>, was the second son of William Douglas of Whittingham and Janet Matheson; he had an elder brother, also William (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1572). Educated for the priesthood in France, Archibald graduated MA and by June 1562, probably in his early twenties, was parson of Douglas. An early convert to protestantism, in February 1566 he was appointed subdean of Orkney in recognition of his work as a royal clerk. Three months earlier, probably through his knowledge of canon law, he had been appointed an extraordinary lord of session in place of Adam Bothwell, bishop of Orkney. Douglas held his new positions only for a short time. In March 1566, with his brother William and his kinsman James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton, he was involved in the conspiracy to murder David Rizzio, secretary to Mary, queen of Scots. Charged for his part in the crime, Douglas fled to France, where he found favour with Charles IX. After his return to Scotland he successfully negotiated the pardons of the other conspirators and attached himself to the company of James Hepburn, fourth earl of Bothwell. In February 1567, with Bothwell, Douglas was implicated in the plot to murder Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, the queen's husband. Despite widespread belief in his guilt, however, no immediate proceedings were taken against him.<br>
<br>Following Queen Mary's deposition in June 1567, Douglas helped secure the casket letters for Regent Moray (it has been suggested that he was responsible for forging them). On 2 June 1568 Douglas was appointed an ordinary lord of session in place of John Leslie, bishop of Ross, and in 1570 he was presented to the parsonage of Glasgow through Morton's intercession. However he was refused letters testimonial by the commissioner and this decision was confirmed by the general assembly in March 1570. At length he was allowed possession, on 23 January 1572, but an account of his examination for the benefice stated: &#145;when he had gottin the psalme buike, after luking, and casting ower the leives thereof a space, he desyrit sum minister to mak prayer for him; &#147;for&#148;, said he, &#147;I am not used to pray&#148;&#146;  (Pitcairn, <span class="italic">Memoriales</span>, 312). Indeed Douglas was more of a politician than a cleric: in September 1570 he acted as ambassador to the earl of Sussex, and in April 1572, having been detected sending money and supplies to the queen's party besieged within Edinburgh Castle, he was imprisoned in Stirling Castle (when it was alleged he plotted to kill his kinsman Morton, now regent). The rift did not last long, and for the remainder of the 1570s Douglas remained prominent, mainly owing to his close alliance with the regent. He was restored to his place on the bench in November 1578.<br>
<br>A year earlier Douglas had married Janet Hepburn (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1586), Bothwell's only sister and widow successively of John Stewart, Lord Darnley (an illegitimate son of James V) and of John Sinclair, master of Caithness. They appear to have had at least one son, John. The marriage was not successful, however, and by 1581 Janet Hepburn was seeking a divorce. Meanwhile, on 31 December 1580 Douglas had been accused (along with Morton) by Captain James Stewart (afterwards earl of Arran) of &#145;heigh treason and foreknawlege of the king's murthour&#146;  (Thomson, <span class="italic">James the Sext</span>, 180&#150;81). Hearing of Morton's imprisonment&#151;and aware of orders issued for his own arrest&#151;Douglas fled from Morham Castle to England and then France. His wife did not accompany him. He was degraded from the bench in April 1581, and a decree of forfeiture was pronounced against him on 28 November 1581.<br>
<br>In France and England, Douglas remained heavily involved in Scottish affairs and was primarily responsible for the forged letters which implicated Esm&eacute; Stewart, duke of Lennox, in popish plots. Although Elizabeth refused James VI's requests to return Douglas for trial in Scotland, she did temporarily imprison him in the Tower of London. After six months Douglas gained his release by disclosing his private transactions with the imprisoned Queen Mary; he then remained at the English court as an unofficial agent to various Scots who sought his aid (including the king). From mid-1583 he was also a paid agent for the English secretary, Sir Francis Walsingham, acting as a spy in the household of Michel de Castelnau, the French ambassador to England. In spring 1586 he was permitted to return to Scotland, and on 1 May an act of rehabilitation was passed under the Scottish great seal restoring him, but at the same time providing that if he should be found guilty of King Henry's murder then the act should have no effect. On 21 May Douglas received a pardon for all his crimes except the murder, and five days later he was put on trial for it. The indictment declared that Douglas had been present at the blowing up of Henry's lodgings in Kirk o' Field, and claimed that while perpetrating the crime Douglas &#145;tint his mulis [lost his dancing slippers]&#146;, which, being found upon the spot the next day, were acknowledged to be his  (Pitcairn, <span class="italic">Criminal Trials</span>, 1.146). The rigged jury unanimously acquitted him.<br>
<br>The continuing association between Douglas and the Scottish administration fluctuated depending on who was in favour at court. He had a close relationship with his stepson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12999/', "Francis Stewart, first earl of Bothwell")</script>, but was greatly disliked by the more powerful Chancellor Maitland. Although known to be an agent of Elizabeth, Douglas returned to England as the official Scottish ambassador. Highly sensitive to political realities, he was well aware of the ambiguities of King James's position with regard to his mother, Mary, queen of Scots&#151;her execution would damage the Scottish king's honour while at the same time greatly strengthening his claim to be Elizabeth's heir. Faced with the task of securing the promise of the English succession for his king while also attempting to preserve Mary's life, Douglas treacherously revealed royal letters to Walsingham and Elizabeth, and informed the earl of Leicester that, even if Mary was executed, it was unlikely that James would break amity with England. In spite of such acts of disloyalty, Douglas remained a well-used conduit for official and secretive cross-border communication. Following Mary's death James employed him to try to secure his English heritage, and he continued to use his services until at least 1596.<br>
<br>Douglas was also active on his own behalf. He attempted to co-ordinate English support for his stepson Bothwell after the murder of the second earl of Moray in February 1592; he was approached by the rebel Roman Catholic earls in an attempt to secure English support in 1594; and he involved himself in the various continental (largely Spanish) plots to invade England and Ireland. He was deposed from his parsonage for non-residence and neglect of duty on 13 March 1593, though it was not until July 1597 that he ceased to use his ecclesiastical style. The date of his death is unknown, but it appears that he was alive until at least the summer of 1602 (resident in Lime Street, London) when he was &#145;unfit for ony service&#146;, of &#145;poor estate&#146;, and desiring to return to Scotland  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 12.252).<br>
