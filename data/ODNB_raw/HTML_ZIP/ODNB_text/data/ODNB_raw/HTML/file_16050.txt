<span class="headword">Lanier, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1692), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, volunteered as a young man to serve with the English troops in French pay in Flanders, during which time he lost an eye. He was promoted to lieutenant-colonel, commanding the duke of Monmouth's regiment of horse in 1674 following the battle of Enzheim, and kept that post until his return to England in May 1678, when he was knighted and commissioned as a brigadier of horse. In 1679 he succeeded Sir Thomas Morgan as governor of Jersey. He quarrelled with the states, fell out with the Carteret family over precedence, challenged Sir Edouard Carteret to a duel, and spent so much time away from the island that he was forbidden by the privy council to leave without the king's permission. He improved the defences of Elizabeth Castle by building a magazine, on the north side of which may still be seen his coat of arms set in stone. He was replaced in July 1684, although the king claimed to be &#145;well satisfied&#146; with his services.<br>
<br>After the accession of James II he was given the colonelcy of the Queen's regiment of horse and made a brigadier-general. Lanier was one of the professional soldiers, often with experience of foreign service, who had been promoted by James but who, by the summer of 1688, were conspiring to deliver their allegiance to William, prince of Orange. James promoted Lanier major-general and, in the autumn of 1688, posted him to Ipswich with three regiments to prevent a Dutch invasion. Recalled and dispatched to the south-west upon news of William's landing, a stream of desertions from troops under Lanier's command promoted the retreat of James's army towards London. Lanier declared for William III and was sent to Scotland, where he took over the siege of Edinburgh Castle from Hugh Mackay. Lanier accepted the duke of Gordon's surrender and took possession of the castle on 12 June 1689. He was subsequently posted to Ireland, where in February 1690 he led a force from Newry to attack Dundalk, which he found strongly garrisoned by the Irish. He burnt the western suburbs, took the lightly garrisoned Bedloe Castle, and drove off 1500 cattle. Lanier led King William's advance guard of horse to the Boyne and was present in the battle on 1 July 1690. He was also present at the siege of Limerick in August, where some held him responsible for the failure to intercept Sarsfield's raid on the artillery train. He directed the abortive attempt to seize Lanesborough Bridge on the Shannon in December 1690, and took part in an ineffective raid on Ballymore in the following spring, shortly after which he was relieved of his command in Ireland and sent back to England.<br>
<br>In December 1691 Lanier declined an offer of a generous pension if he resigned, but was nevertheless promoted to lieutenant-general on 23 January 1692. However, so resentful was he of William's supposed favour for his Dutch and German officers that in May 1692 his name was included in a lengthy list of officers against whom Jacobite sympathies were alleged. Lanier marched with his regiment to Flanders in July, was fatally wounded at the battle of Steenkerke on 3 August 1692, and died there a few days afterwards. His corpse was returned on an Admiralty yacht to England for burial there. Although he had a wife while he was in Jersey, he died a widower and left no heirs.<br>
