<span class="headword">Percy, Sir  Henry</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Henry Hotspur]</span>  (1364&#150;1403), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was born on 20 May 1364 at Alnwick, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21932/', "Henry Percy, first earl of Northumberland (1341&#150;1408)")</script>, and his first wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1372), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19950/', "Ralph Neville, Lord Neville of Raby (d. 1367)")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Growthofachivalricreputation"></a>Growth of a chivalric reputation</h2>Knighted by Edward III in 1377, the young Henry Percy quickly began to make a name for himself as a successful war-captain, &#145;who above all else desired feats of arms, always the first in the skirmish at the barriers&#146;  (<span class="italic">&#338;uvres de Froissart</span>, 13.210). He was first armed in November 1378, when he assisted his father in recapturing Berwick Castle from a band of Scottish raiders. He married Elizabeth Mortimer (1371&#150;1417), eldest daughter of Edmund (III) Mortimer, third earl of March (<i>d</i>. 1381), before December 1379. They had two children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21933/', "Henry Percy")</script>, created earl of Northumberland in 1416; and Elizabeth, who married John, Lord Clifford, and, second, Ralph Neville, second earl of Westmorland (<i>d</i>. 1484). Percy served in Ireland with the earl of March in 1380, then travelled and crusaded in Prussia and Asia Minor during 1383. It was on the Scottish border, however, that he made his reputation and acquired his nickname, Hotspur, bestowed on him by the Scots as a tribute to his speed in advance and readiness to attack. In May 1385 Percy was appointed warden of the east march and, in the following month, accompanied Richard II into Scotland with his own company of sixty men-at-arms and sixty archers. He subsequently played an important part in securing the line of the royal army's withdrawal, beating off a series of Scottish attacks. Hotspur relinquished the wardenship in April 1386 and was immediately sent to reinforce the Calais garrison, with a company of 100 men, in the face of a rumoured French attack; characteristically, he took the opportunity to lead several raids into Picardy. Between August and October 1387 he had command of a substantial naval force in the channel and attempted, without success, to relieve the siege of Brest. The appellant regime showed their gratitude for these military endeavours by nominating Percy as a knight of the Garter early in 1388 and reappointing him as warden of the east march for three years in June, at the substantial fee of &pound;12,000 p.a. in time of war and &pound;3000 p.a. in peace. Taken unawares by large-scale Scottish raids through the march the same summer, Hotspur caught up with the force of James, second earl of Douglas, at Otterburn in Redesdale. In the confused engagement that followed&#151;&#145;as hard an encounter and as well-fought a battle as there could ever be&#146;  (<span class="italic">&#338;uvres de Froissart</span>, 13.219)&#151;Douglas was killed and Hotspur captured. It is an indication of the public esteem he already enjoyed that the bulk of his ransom, set at 7000 marks, was met by royal gift and parliamentary subscription.<br>
<br>At large again by July 1389 Henry Percy was appointed warden of the west march for five years in June 1390. Despite the cessation of open hostilities against the Scots and French, his chivalric reputation continued to grow, fostered by displays of prowess at the jousts of St Inglevert in March 1391 and at Smithfield, during the festivities that followed the king's marriage, in 1396. Hotspur was sent on a diplomatic mission to James, king of Cyprus, in June 1393 before taking up the sensitive post of lieutenant in the duchy of Aquitaine, then in a state of near rebellion against the king's grant of the duchy to his uncle, John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster. He returned to England in January 1395, joining Richard II's expedition against the Irish, before going back to Aquitaine in the following autumn in order to consult with the Gascon estates over their continued opposition to Lancastrian rule. In 1396 Hotspur spent the summer at Calais, moderating and resolving outstanding ransom disputes between the French and English. Such consistent military and diplomatic employment brought with it growing evidence of royal favour. Richard had retained Hotspur for life in January 1391, at a fee of &pound;100 p.a., and he granted him the chief forestership of Inglewood, with power to nominate a deputy, in May 1393. Percy was appointed warden of the east march, in succession to his father, for the exceptionally long term of ten years, in June 1396 and granted wardship of the extensive Umfraville inheritance in Northumberland, free of rent, in January 1399.<h2>
<a name="SupportforHenryIVanditsrewards"></a>Support for Henry IV and its rewards</h2>Despite such tokens of royal favour the Percy family viewed with suspicion Richard II's attempts to dilute their monopoly of border office; the town of Berwick was, for instance, removed from Hotspur's command in January 1399. This was one influence on the Percys' decision to support Henry of Lancaster on his return from exile in June. Joining forces at Doncaster, Hotspur and his father accompanied Lancaster on his march south. While the earl of Northumberland played a crucial role in negotiating Richard's surrender, Hotspur was prominent militarily, beating off an attack by dissident Cheshire forces as the Lancastrian army moved towards London in August. The Percys were lavishly rewarded for their support. Within a year of Henry IV's accession Hotspur had been reappointed as warden of the east march for a further term of ten years, with the garrisons of both Berwick and Roxburgh included within his command, nominated as sheriff of Northumberland, and granted the castle and lordship of Bamburgh. He was also made justiciar of north Wales and Chester, and his authority in the region further underwritten by an extensive series of grants, including the castles of Chester, Flint, Conwy, Caernarfon, and Beaumaris, the shrievalty of Flint, the county and lordship of Anglesey, and the custody of the valuable Mortimer lordship of Denbigh.<br>
<br>These grants gave Percy a virtual monopoly of civil and military authority on the east march and in north Wales, two areas vital to the security of the new Lancastrian regime. In the north Hotspur was able to translate his augmented powers into military success but, as the rebellion of Owain Glyn D&#373;r gathered strength, his Welsh commands proved unexpectedly taxing. Early in 1400 he and George Dunbar, earl of March, raided through the Lothians; the following autumn he was stationed at Dunstanburgh in order to protect the east march from retaliatory raids in the wake of Henry IV's campaign in Scotland. At Easter 1401 Conwy, one of the Welsh castles under Hotspur's command, was captured by rebels. After conducting the siege to recapture it at his own expense, and successfully negotiating the rebels' surrender, he remained in north Wales for the rest of the summer, co-ordinating the English forays against Glyn D&#373;r's forces. The king's continuing confidence in Hotspur's military ability was underlined by his appointment as royal lieutenant in north Wales in March 1402 while, in September, he and Dunbar won a considerable victory over an invading Scottish force at Homildon Hill, capturing the earl of Douglas and many other nobles.<h2>
<a name="Rebellionanddeath"></a>Rebellion and death</h2>Building on this success against the Scots, Percy and his father sought to make good a royal grant to themselves of the Douglas estates in southern Scotland by besieging the fortress of Cocklaw, near Hawick, in May 1403. In July, however, Hotspur moved south, &#145;with a small company, feigning peace&#146;  (Galbraith and Clarke, 177). Once in Cheshire he issued proclamations accusing Henry IV of oath breaking and tyrannical government, declared his continuing allegiance to Richard II, and, joined by his uncle, Thomas Percy, earl of Worcester, marched on Shrewsbury in order to engage the forces of Henry, prince of Wales. Arriving outside the town on 21 July, however, Hotspur found that the king was there before him and he was forced to give battle against the superior royal forces. The fighting was exceptionally intense, with heavy casualties sustained on both sides, but the Percy forces broke when Hotspur himself, driving his way towards the royal standard, was struck down and killed. His body was taken for burial at Whitchurch, Shropshire, by Thomas Neville, Lord Furnival, but, on hearing that rumours circulated that Hotspur was still alive, Henry IV had the corpse exhumed and displayed it, propped upright between two millstones, in the market place at Shrewsbury.<br>
<br>Hotspur's rebellion was the final result of the growing discontent felt by the Percys at their treatment by Henry IV. On the march they believed their legitimate territorial ambitions in southern Scotland were being hampered by the king's failure to pay the wages due to them for their war service sufficiently promptly, while their sense of grievance was further inflamed by the favour Henry showed towards George Dunbar. Hotspur and his father had already expressed the frustration they felt on this issue by refusing to hand over to the king the prisoners taken at Homildon. In Wales the continuing success of Owain Glyn D&#373;r was an additional source of tension. Frustrated by the king's reluctance to contemplate the negotiated settlement with the Welsh he had sought to promote, Hotspur had been forced to accept a substantial reduction in his regional predominance when a unified military command in the principality was created in April 1403 and vested in Henry, prince of Wales. A further, more personal, grievance was Henry IV's continued refusal to ransom Sir Edmund Mortimer, Hotspur's brother-in-law, after his capture by the Welsh in June 1402. This connection by marriage with the Mortimer family, who possessed a plausible claim to the English crown, may have been the decisive consideration in Hotspur's decision to rebel. In the parley before Shrewsbury Henry accused him of ambitions to rule the kingdom in the right of his wife and, in the heat of the battle itself, Hotspur's soldiers set up the cry &#145;Henry Percy King&#146;. It was a fittingly grandiose epitaph for the most famous soldier of his day, whose military talents, allied to the shrewd political opportunism of his father, briefly secured for the Percy family a pre-eminent position among the English nobility.<br>
