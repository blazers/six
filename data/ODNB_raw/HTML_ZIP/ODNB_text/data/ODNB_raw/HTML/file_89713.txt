<span class="headword">Cowan,  William Maxwell <span class="st"> [Max]</span></span>  (1931&#150;2002), <span class="occ">neurobiologist</span>, was born on 27 September 1931 in Johannesburg, South Africa, the son of Adam Cowan, a structural engineer, and his wife, Jessie Sloan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Maxwell. His parents had recently moved from Scotland to South Africa in search of jobs. He studied medicine at the University of the Witwatersrand (graduating BSc in 1951), where a vacation job looking after psychiatric patients started his lifelong interest in the brain. An opportunity to continue in research and teaching took him to Hertford College, Oxford, where he was guided into neuroanatomy by Sir Wilfrid Le Gros Clark. He obtained his DPhil in 1956, then completed his clinical medical course in Oxford (graduating BM BCh in 1958). From 1958 to 1966 he was a university lecturer in anatomy and fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford. Meanwhile, on 31 March 1956, he had married Margaret Sherlock, a 26-year-old nursery school teacher, and daughter of William Thomas Sherlock, tailor. They had two sons, David and Stephen, and a daughter, Ruth.<br>
<br>In 1965 Cowan spent a sabbatical year at Washington University, St Louis, Missouri, and subsequently, after two years as an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, was invited back to Washington University to become professor and head of the department of anatomy, a post he held from 1968 to 1980. In the latter year he moved to the Salk Institute, San Diego, California, as professor, becoming vice-president in 1982. In 1986 he returned to Washington University as provost, but left in 1988 when he was appointed vice-president and chief scientific officer of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, a post he held until 2000. On retirement he was made a distinguished professor at the Salk Institute, only the fourth person to be awarded that honour.<br>
<br>Cowan's research involved elucidation of the structure of the brain, and its development. His first work was a study of how nerve fibre connections reach the cerebral cortex from the thalamus. In the course of this he worked with Tom Powell on the interrelationships of the thalamus and corpus striatum, and later with Geoff Raisman on the fibre connections of the hippocampus. The investigation of how the brain is organized was always dependent on developing methods of tracing nerve fibres through the immensely complex network of the brain. Cowan learned from Le Gros Clark that these connections can only be traced by experimental methods, the first of which was to study the pathways marked out by the distribution of the degeneration engendered by making small areas of damage in specific locations. Cowan used, and indeed extended, a number of these mapping techniques, such as retrograde degeneration (loss or shrinkage of nerve cells when the fibres arising from them are damaged at a distance), and orthograde degeneration (break-up of nerve fibres when they are disconnected from their parent cells). His work showed examples of how both these effects could cross from one nerve cell to another along a chain of connections (transneuronal degeneration), and he was one of the early pioneers of the study of connections by electron microscopy of orthograde degeneration, thus taking the analysis down to the level of precision of the individual synapses by which one nerve cell communicates with another. Always aware of the limitations of mapping by degeneration techniques, he was one of the first to espouse the newly found method of introducing into the brain tracer substances to be carried along intact nerve fibres to distant destinations in both orthograde and retrograde directions. Throughout his career he recruited and trained a galaxy of highly talented young people, virtually all of whom went on to outstanding careers of their own, and who contributed to establishing the definitive methodology for using radioactive amino acids, or non-radioactive substances, such as lectins, as orthograde tracers, and enzymes such as horseradish peroxidase and multiple fluorescent coloured dyes as retrograde tracers.<br>
<br>Cowan's initial interest in degeneration led him to a major new field. Whereas adult nerve cells and fibres degenerate when damaged, during normal development there is major loss of nerve cells and nerve fibres which is not a result of damage. Cowan played an important part in showing that the brain develops by sculpting down from an initially much larger set of nerve fibres and connections. His contact with Rita Levi-Montalcini and Viktor Hamburger in St Louis introduced him to the principle of nerve growth factors, and the concept that one of the elements in this sculpting down is the competition between nerve cells for a limited supply of growth factors. Work with James Fawcett showed that another element is the effect of external stimuli which lead to the remodelling of connections into the most adaptive pattern for the specific environment in which the individual finds itself.<br>
<br>Cowan was always dedicated to education, and over and above their scientific training, he played a keen and fatherly role in helping his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s face the challenges and problems of their lives. His interests and knowledge spread far beyond neuroanatomy, and this enhanced his effectiveness as a communicator. The sustained enthusiasm, tireless energy, and incisive thought he brought to the fabric of scientific communication and to the development of the scientific community were outstanding, at least matching the impact of his own personal research. In 1969 he took over the editorship of the <span class="italic">Journal of Comparative Neurology</span>, raising it from obscurity to be one of the foremost neuroscience journals of its time. Subsequently he became editor-in-chief (1980&#150;87) of the new <span class="italic">Journal of Neuroscience</span>, which became the flagship of the newly formed American Society of Neuroscience, of which he was president (1977&#150;8). From 1978 until his death he was co-editor of the <span class="italic">Annual Review of Neuroscience</span>, in which he was proactive in identifying larger topics of historical importance, many of which involved compiling research and individual contributions which had never before been made accessible. In 1993 he became co-chairman with Jim Watson of the Dana Alliance, which formulated the objectives of the &#145;decade of the brain&#146;, and was subsequently active in promoting public understanding of brain research, including through his vice-chairmanship of the European Dana Alliance.<br>
<br>One of the key conceptual advances in which Cowan was a leader was the realization that the separate ways of studying the nervous system&#151;anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, psychology, development&#151;could not be adequately advanced as isolated disciplines. During his time in St Louis he effectively united the departments of anatomy and physiology, and he was one of the most effective proponents of the new, inclusive discipline called neuroscience, or neurobiology. Possibly his outstanding contribution during his period at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute was to integrate the newly burgeoning molecular biological approach with the existing, older disciplines already included in neuroscience.<br>
<br>Cowan (who published as W. Maxwell Cowan, and was known to friends as Max) was one of the most eminent neuroanatomists of his day; he trained some of the most important scientists of the next generation, and he made a virtually unparalleled contribution to the recruitment to and dissemination of the study of the brain. He was elected a foreign associate of the US National Academy of Sciences in 1981, and a fellow of the Royal Society in 1982. He died at his home in Rockville, Maryland, USA, of prostate cancer on 30 June 2002, and his funeral service was held at the Fourth Presbyterian Church, Bethesda, Maryland, on 6 July. He was survived by his wife, Margaret, and their three children.<br>
