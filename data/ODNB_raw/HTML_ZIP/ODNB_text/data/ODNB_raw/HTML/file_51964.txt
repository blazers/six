<span class="headword">Colville <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em> Crewe-Milnes]</span>, Lady  (Helen) Cynthia</span>  (1884&#150;1968), <span class="occ">courtier and social worker</span>, was born on 20 May 1884, the third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32628/', "Robert Offley Ashburton Crewe-Milnes (1858&#150;1945)")</script>, Liberal politician, who the year after her birth succeeded as second Baron Houghton and who subsequently became the first and last marquess of Crewe. Her mother was his first wife, Sybil Marcia (<i>d</i>. 1887), daughter of Sir Frederick Graham, third baronet, and his wife, Lady Jane St Maur. She had a twin sister, Celia Hermione; her only brother died in childhood. After their mother's death the children lived principally with their uncle, the third Baron Crewe, and had a spell in Dublin when their father was Gladstone's lord lieutenant of Ireland (1892&#150;5). Cynthia was educated by governesses and studied piano at the Royal College of Music.<br>
<br>On 21 January 1908 Lady Cynthia married George (Geordie) Charles Colville (1867&#150;1943), barrister, third son of Charles Colville, first Viscount Colville of Culross. They had three sons. Lady Cynthia shared her husband's enthusiasm for sailing, and they made the annual pilgrimage to Cowes. After her marriage she became very active in social work, joining the committee of the Charity Organization Society in Shoreditch, the district of London with the highest infant mortality rate in the city. She was for twenty years the honorary secretary of the pioneering infant welfare centre opened there and became involved in many other committees and organizations devoted to the welfare of the borough, including a school for mothers and the council's public health committee. In 1948 the metropolitan borough of Shoreditch renamed the Felton Street estate the Colville estate in the light of her long association with the borough. &#145;My sole &#147;qualification&#148; I think, is that I just love Shoreditch, and have done so for quite a long time&#146; Lady Cynthia was minuted as writing to accept the honour  (Hackney Archive Service, S/CE 48, p. 321). A strong Liberal, she was invited to stand for parliament for the party in Shoreditch in 1923. In 1929 she was appointed a magistrate and served in the east London juvenile court, becoming eventually a juvenile court chairman. She shared the conviction of her generation and class that there had been a slackening of morals, attributable to &#145;the over-indulgent parents, the absentee mother, the lack of any fixed standard of right and wrong, the silly sexy stories that constitute the bulk of light reading matter, [and] the dramatic presentation of violence&#146;  (C. Colville, 142). She believed that &#145;kindly deflation&#146; was a more effective approach to take to young male delinquents and criminals than &#145;fear-inspired seriousness&#146;, while &#145;the quasi-prostitute girl of fourteen or fifteen can be made to feel ignorant and pathetic sooner than adult and romantic&#146;  (ibid., 143&#150;4). In 1952 she was appointed a lay justice at Bow Street magistrates' court.<br>
<br>In 1923, following a royal visit to Shoreditch, Lady Cynthia was invited to become a woman of the bedchamber to Queen Mary, and retained the position until the queen's death in 1953. She was invaluable to the queen as a source of information on health and welfare issues, in which the queen was very interested. According to her son, Lady Cynthia lent Queen Mary a copy of <span class="italic">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span> in 1933, earning a rebuke from the king, who was subsequently found reading it himself as it was &#145;his duty to study the kind of temptations to which his subjects were exposed&#146;  (J. Colville, 41). She had also the unenviable task of breaking to Queen Mary the news of the deaths of two of her sons: the duke of Kent and King George VI. The Colville family connections with the royal court were continued in the next generation: her youngest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39878/', "Sir John Rupert Colville")</script>, served as a page of honour to King George V and later as private secretary to Princess Elizabeth.<br>
<br>Lady Cynthia Colville was appointed DCVO in 1937 and DBE in 1953. She was made an honorary LLD by Leeds University, and delivered the Clark Hall lecture (&#145;Social progress and the individual&#146;) in 1954. She published her autobiography, entitled <span class="italic">Crowded Life</span>, in 1963 and died at her home, 4 Mulberry Walk, Chelsea, on 15 June 1968.<br>
