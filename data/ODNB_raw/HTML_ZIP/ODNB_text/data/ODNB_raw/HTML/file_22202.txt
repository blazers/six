<span class="headword">Picken,  Joanna Belfrage</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Alpha]</span>  (1798&#150;1859), <span class="occ">poet and teacher</span>, was born on 8 May 1798 at Fountain Close, Edinburgh, the fourth child and third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22201/', "Ebenezer Picken (1769&#150;1816)")</script>, &#145;the poet of Paisley&#146;, and Robina Belfrage, daughter of the Revd John Belfrage of Falkirk, Stirlingshire, and sister of the Revd Henry Belfrage DD (1774&#150;1835). She was one of nine children, of whom one of the three daughters and three of the six sons died in early childhood. She and her sister Catherine were well educated, and for a while they had a boarding-school in Musselburgh, Midlothian. It failed, it is reported, in part because of Joanna's poetic satires of local people. In 1842, after the death of their mother, Joanna and Catherine joined their brothers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22200/', "Andrew Belfrage Picken (1802&#150;1849)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22201/', "Picken, Ebenezer (1769&#150;1816)")</script>] and Henry Belfrage Picken in Canada. Joanna supported herself in Montreal as a teacher of music.<br>
<br>As a poet Joanna Picken is best remembered for &#145;An Auld Friend wi' a New Face&#146;, a comic poem, in seven twelve-line stanzas in Scots dialect, about marriage. It begins:<blockquote>
<div>A queer kind o' lott'ry is marriage&#151;<br>
</div>
<div>Ye never ken what ye may draw,<br>
</div>
<div>Ye may get a braw hoose an' a carriage,<br>
</div>
<div>Or maybe get nae hoose ava.<br>
</div>
<div>I say na 'tis <i>best</i> to be single,<br>
</div>
<div>But ae thing's to me unco clear:<br>
</div>
<div>Far better sit <i>lane</i> by the <i>ingle</i>
<br>
</div>
<div>Than thole what some wives hae to bear.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>The speaker goes on to enumerate the hazards of the institution, from a woman's point of view, concluding with advice to unmarried women similar to that offered in the first stanza. James Grant Wilson included this poem and Joanna Picken's &#145;The Death Watch&#146; in his anthology <span class="italic">The Poets and Poetry of Scotland</span> (1876), noting that her work had appeared in Scottish and Canadian journals (in the latter under the pen-name Alpha) and that at her death she left a 45-piece manuscript. Thus far none of that work has been published except in nineteenth-century periodicals. Indeed, until 1998, only sixteen poems in addition to the two published by Wilson have been recovered, three in the <span class="italic">Montreal Transcript and Commercial Advertiser</span>, and thirteen in the possession of a great-great-grandson of the poet's brother Henry Belfrage Picken. Most are grave or melancholy in tone and tell of disappointment, loss, sorrow, homesickness, and death as a cherished release from the pains of life. Some can be dated as early as 1829, more than a decade before she emigrated, but others were certainly written in Canada. None is in Scots dialect. Only two, &#145;To Berwick&#146; and a two-stanza poem set to the music of a serenade, &#145;The Light Guitar&#146;, by John Barnett, show the comic spirit which informs &#145;An Auld Friend wi' a New Face&#146;. Conceivably among the missing poems were those satirizing citizens of Musselburgh and perhaps some others meant to be sung.<br>
<br>From the newly recovered poems it can be surmised that Joanna Picken was devoted to her parents, that she mourned the loss of dear friends as well as her parents, and that her hopes were repeatedly disappointed. She started out with great lyric gifts which dwindled over the years. It is doubly sad that probably some of her best work has perished. Joanna Belfrage Picken died of apoplexy in Montreal on 24 March 1859 and was buried five days later in Mount Royal cemetery in that city.<br>
