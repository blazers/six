<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Garson,  Mary Sunniva</span>  (1921&#150;2007), <span class="occ">nun and founder of the Benedictine sisters of Grace and Compassion</span>, was born on 3 October 1921 at Denend, Udny, Aberdeenshire, the only daughter and eldest of four children of David Garson, merchant seaman and later harbour master, and his wife, Jessie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Anderson. She was educated at Invergordon Academy and at the University of Aberdeen, where she graduated MA in psychology. During the Second World War she served as an officer in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, working on the interviewing procedures for RAF recruits, and was seconded to the army to assist the diagnostic testing of soldiers returning from Burma. On demobilization she worked as an industrial and educational psychologist.<br>
<br>Mary Garson had been brought up as a presbyterian but in 1947 was received into the Roman Catholic church. She was at first, by her own admission, a reluctant Catholic. Her contacts with a Jesuit priest, Bernard Bassett, who had been involved in RAF leadership courses, persuaded her that she had a religious vocation, but its character was discerned slowly. While practising as a psychologist in Brighton she began to work, encouraged by the local clergy, among the many elderly in the town and witnessed their desperation and loneliness. Perhaps her inspiration was similar to that of her fellow Catholic converts Leonard Cheshire and Sue Ryder and so many other former service personnel of her generation. She had great determination and an ability to overcome a shortage of funds for her initiatives: &#145;If we do our best, God will do the rest&#146; she would say  (personal knowledge).<br>
<br>Mary Garson was small in stature, about 5 feet 2 inches in height, and of average build. She had a personal serenity and meekness and was quietly spoken with a faint Scottish lilt. She was a woman of few words but they were always well chosen. She had a shrewd business sense and a determined character. She always believed that what good she did was simply God's will.<br>
<br>Garson's residential home for the elderly in Brighton, St Mary's House, Preston Road, which opened in 1954, was always a place of prayer as well as of work. Her co-workers gradually turned themselves into a religious community not resident in one place but united in purpose and lifestyle. In 1959, only five years after the first home opened, Cyril Cowderoy, the Roman Catholic bishop of Southwark (whose diocese then included Brighton) recognized the community as a &#145;pious association&#146;. Holy Cross Priory, near Heathfield in Sussex, became the headquarters of Mary Garson's charitable and religious activities in 1965. Gradually habits were adopted, blue in colour and with black veils, and in 1978 the rule of St Benedict, with its moderation and wisdom, was adopted. She was greatly influenced by the monks of Worth Abbey in Sussex and in particular by their first abbot, Victor Farwell. Her spirituality, in her early Catholic days, was Jesuit-inclined and her houses hosted &#145;cell&#146; meetings inspired by Bernard Bassett. She gradually saw that the Benedictine rule, in its origins intended for a closed community, was easily adapted for an active congregation, as for similar groups like the Sisters of the Good Samaritan in Australia. She lived in a convent within the grounds of Worth Abbey, which served as her generalate from 1977 until 1994. The sisters remained there until 2003. In 1992 Cormac Murphy O'Connor, bishop of Arundel and Brighton, had recognized them as a diocesan congregation. Their dedication to ecumenism would particularly have appealed to him.<br>
<br>On 18 September 1992 the sisters were admitted into full association with the international Benedictine confederation. Garson was by then styled Mother Mary Garson, prioress general of the Benedictine sisters of Grace and Compassion. Their life was not that of the cloistered nuns but their observance was centred on shared liturgical prayer; their active work was compassion, especially for the elderly. It was a mixed life, fully informed by the Second Vatican Council and with a strong emphasis on collaboration with lay professionals and helpers. It attracted many vocations and by the time of her death there were more than 200 sisters in Europe, Africa, and Asia, representing a truly multinational community, running twenty-seven care homes for the elderly and needy. This was a key part of the congregation's charisma and explains, alongside Garson's own inspiration and initiatives, why, at a time when many European Catholic congregations of women were in decline, the sisters of Grace and Compassion flourished.<br>
<br>Mary Garson celebrated the jubilee of her first foundation in Arundel Cathedral in 2004, a year before her retirement as prioress general in 2005. She was appointed MBE in 2004 &#145;for devoting her life to the care of others&#146;, having both promoted &#145;the vision of individual dignity&#146; and &#145;engendered an overwhelming family feeling about the charity, attracting people of all religious faiths&#146;, who, by her example, &#145;foster participation and unity&#146;. She died on 8 March 2007 at St Joseph's Home, Albert Road, Bognor Regis, Sussex, and, after a requiem at Worth Abbey, she was buried at Holy Cross Priory, Heathfield, Sussex, on 27 March 2007.<br>
