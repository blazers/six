<span class="headword">Tobin,  John</span>  (1770&#150;1804), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born in Endless Street, Salisbury, on 26 January 1770, the third of eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53030/', "James Tobin (1736/7&#150;1817)")</script>, a sugar planter and merchant of Nevis and Bristol, and his wife, Elizabeth (1744/5&#150;1824), daughter of another Nevis planter, George Webbe.<br>
<br>Tobin's father, a partner of the Bristol West India merchant John Pinney, campaigned against the abolition of slavery. An older brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27484/', "Rear-Admiral George Tobin (1768&#150;1838)")</script>, sailed on Bligh's second voyage to Tahiti and was an amateur marine painter. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58446/', "James Webbe Tobin (1767&#150;1814)")</script>, the eldest of the children with whom he was very close, moved in radical and dissenting circles and was a friend of Coleridge, Southey, Lamb, the philosopher William Godwin, and Sir Humphry Davy. Unlike his father, James Webbe campaigned for the abolition of slavery and was instrumental in bringing to the attention of the British public the cruelties of the Nevis planter Edward Huggins.<br>
<br>In 1777 James Tobin set out with his wife for Nevis in the West Indies, leaving his three eldest sons in the care of their grandfather who sent them to King Edward VI School in Southampton. When his father returned to settle in Bristol in 1784 John Tobin was sent to Bristol grammar school. In 1787 he left Bristol to be articled to a solicitor in Lincoln's Inn, taking over the partnership with three others in the office some ten years later. Disagreements arose and Tobin left to join a new firm with a Mr Ange.<br>
<br>A quiet, contemplative, but disorganized man, Tobin was bored with legal work. Always interested in poetry and the theatre as a child, he devoted all of his spare time and energy to writing, trying his hand at opera and tragedy, but feeling most at ease with comedies and stage lyrics. These tended to be imitative and his explanation was that he had &#145;great difficulty in getting good plots, or in making them&#146;  (Benger, 38&#150;9). One such comedy about gambling, <span class="italic">The Faro Table</span>, was provisionally accepted by Sheridan who then rejected it on the grounds that it bore too close a resemblance to <span class="italic">School for Scandal</span> and it might have libelled a well-known dowager who gambled.<br>
<br>In 1796 Tobin's brother James, whose eyesight was failing, came to live with him at the Temple. His brother played an important role in sustaining Tobin when thirteen of his plays (including <span class="italic">The Curfew</span> and <span class="italic">School for Authors</span>) were rejected by theatre managers. Tobin suffered again when he was persuaded to put his name to Godwin's dull play <span class="italic">Antonio</span> and attend the rehearsals to keep up the deception. Godwin was afraid that his play would be suppressed because of his radical reputation. It is not clear how far Tobin shared Godwin's political views, as in 1792 he had complained about &#145;the present growing system of mental tyranny&#146; in England, but was becoming disillusioned with the outcome of the French Revolution  (Benger, 28&#150;30). Desperate to have some of his own work performed, Tobin was encouraged to get the popular actor John Shepherd Munden to stage a piece as a benefit. This early and insignificant farce, <span class="italic">All's Fair in Love</span>, was put on successfully in April 1803 but was speedily forgotten.<br>
<br>Tobin's final effort, <span class="italic">The Honey Moon</span>, was inspired by a discussion one day in his chambers as to how far it would be possible to revive old English comedy as it existed in the days of Shakespeare and Fletcher. Tobin set out to write a play imitative of this style. It was rejected in 1804 by Covent Garden and submitted to Drury Lane. Without knowing the result Tobin left London with some resignation to recover his failing health in Cornwall. While there he concluded that producing a new edition of Shakespeare's work would be less arduous than combating the obduracy of managers, and he began collecting materials. He was almost delirious with joy on hearing that <span class="italic">The Honey Moon</span> had been accepted; but in the meantime alarming symptoms of tuberculosis had become evident. He was told that to save his life he must winter in the West Indies. He left Cornwall to see his family in Bristol where he learned that the play was in rehearsal and his father heard of his writing activities for the first time. Tobin left for the Caribbean, possibly on board the <i>Pilgrim</i> from Bristol, in late November 1804. His ship sailed out of Cork on the afternoon of 7 December but he died that night. The ship was driven back by a contrary wind and this allowed Tobin to be buried, unmarried, in what is now known as the Lusitania graveyard near Cobh, where his father, visiting some years later, erected a plaque in his memory.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Honey Moon</span>, a romantic comedy written in blank verse interspersed with prose, was staged at Drury Lane on 31 January 1805, with Elliston as Duke Aranza and Bannister as Orlando, and proved a great success. Much of it was imitative as Tobin had planned and his success at this is demonstrated by the reactions to it. Hazlitt thought the plot owed much to the <span class="italic">Taming of the Shrew</span>; Genest detected reminiscences of Massinger and other Elizabethans; others saw Beaumont and Fletcher. A favourite on the English stage for twenty years and still being put on in 1869 at Sadler's Wells, it was translated into French and performed in North America. After this initial posthumous success, Tobin's rejected pieces were eagerly sought after.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Curfew</span>, a tragi-comedy set in feudal times alternating prose with blank verse, was produced at Drury Lane on 19 February 1807 and would have run longer than twenty nights but for Sheridan's anxiety to avoid providing a benefit for Tobin's relatives as had been agreed. Two further pieces, <span class="italic">The Fisherman</span>, an opera, and <span class="italic">Attraction</span>, were accepted by Drury Lane and Covent Garden respectively but the music was lost in a fire at these sister theatres.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The School for Authors</span>, a prose comedy, was the next success. Based on <span class="italic">The Connoisseur</span>, one of Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Marmontel's tales, this amusing and well-constructed little play owes something to Samuel Foote's <span class="italic">The Patron</span>. The part of Diaper, the sensitive author, provided a triumph for J. S. Munden when he played the role at Covent Garden on 5 December 1808. Tobin's brother, who had been an energetic literary executor, then had to set out himself for Nevis for the sake of his own failing health and no new work was staged until he began to renew pressure on theatre managers from the Caribbean.<br>
<br>In 1813, a year before he died, James Webbe Tobin wrote a letter from Nevis in which he noted the earlier withdrawal by Sheridan of <span class="italic">The Faro Table</span>. He noted also that on the death of the dowager it had been brought forward again and put into rehearsal. However two days before its presentation he was told that it could be considered as a satire on another lady and it was withdrawn. He continued &#145;Now Sir, should there be no more peeresses or ladies of quality standing in the way, I may justly require that this piece &hellip; may be brought forward&#146;  (Benger, 157&#150;8). This was done eventually at Drury Lane on 5 November 1816, nearly twenty years after it had been written, when the manners it satirizes were already passing away. It was not a success nor was <span class="italic">The Fisherman</span> which was staged unexpectedly in 1819.<br>
