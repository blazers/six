<span class="headword">Morten,  (Violet) Honnor</span>  (1861&#150;1913), <span class="occ">nurse and journalist</span>, was born at Mayfield House, Cheam, Surrey, on 13 November 1861, the only daughter among the four children of John Garrett Morten (1833&#150;1900), a wealthy solicitor, and his second wife, Wilhelmina Milroy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Black (1837&#150;1907). She was a niece of the novelist William Black. She had two half-siblings by her father's first marriage. As a child she enjoyed playing billiards with Herbert Spencer, a family friend. She reached adulthood in &#145;an old Stuart palace&#146;, Ivy Hall, Richmond, Surrey, but eventually rejected the life of &#145;a fine lady with nothing to do but pay great attention to dress, fashion, and society&#146;  (Friedrichs, 304).<br>
<br>Aged twenty, Morten began nurse's training at the London Hospital under Eva L&uuml;ckes, practised as a volunteer from 1885 to 1888, and came to accept nursing as her central calling. She gained the midwifery diploma of the London Obstetrical Society. In 1895 she began a course in scientific hygiene at Bedford College, London, and qualified for the certificate in 1896; her highest mark was her physics paper, reflecting her study of astronomical physics just after leaving school. In her later <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry she listed only astronomy and socialism as her recreations.<br>
<br>A steady schedule of journalism, speaking, and international travel characterized Morten's life. She contributed to <span class="italic">The Hospital</span>, <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, and other periodicals. She also published several classic nursing manuals: her <span class="italic">Nurse's Dictionary of Medical Terms and Nursing Treatment</span> (1891) reached an eighth edition by the time of her death. In 1889 she founded the Women Writers' Club with offices in Fleet Street. In the early 1890s she founded a nurses' co-operative and the Association of Asylum Workers. About this time she began to lecture widely on infant care, first aid, family health, and women's rights. Her audiences ranged from Women's Co-operative Guild chapters to the London Ethical Society, and even women prisoners at Wormwood Scrubs&#151;prison reform being another of her causes.<br>
<br>About 1896 Morten took up residence in the inner London district of Hoxton. Here she and two college friends established a small settlement along &#145;unsectarian and socialist lines&#146;. The settlers, both male and female, lived like their neighbours, and kept house for themselves. In her autobiographical <span class="italic">From a Nurse's Notebook</span> (1899) she exulted at the local curate's terror of her Chianti, cigarettes, and unorthodox religious views. During these Hoxton years Morten stood, in 1897, for election to the London school board, a powerful body responsible for educating about 660,000 pupils and employing 15,000 teachers. Only twenty-nine women (of a total membership of 326) served on the board during its existence from 1871 to 1903. She came in first among the candidates in her district of Hackney but wisely switched to represent the City when one of her constituents spotted her publicly smoking and raised an outcry. On the school board she advanced radical positions: equal pay for women employees, school nurses in the poorest schools, and better facilities for retarded children. She founded the School Nurses' Society to provide free nursing care for London children. Morten's vigorous campaign to abolish corporal punishment in the schools earned her adverse coverage in teachers' publications.<br>
<br>About 1905 Morten established Oakdene, a Tolstoy-inspired settlement in Rotherfield, Sussex, which was partly funded by donations from Aylmer and Louise Maude, the English translators of Tolstoy's <span class="italic">Resurrection</span>. According to a friend the house followed a rule that &#145;insisted on silence at the breakfast table&#151;on the principle that people are never amiable at breakfast&#146;  (Porritt, 136). The settlement was both a country holiday home for disabled children from inner London, each of whom was cared for by an adult settler, and a retreat for adults.<br>
<br>Like others of her generation devoted to serving the poor Morten caught &#145;the St. Francis spirit&#146; in the 1890s  (Porritt, 135). Her religious faith was that of a high-church &#145;firm Protestant&#146;, but she was rather secretive about it. She started writing a life of the Catholic martyr Edward Colman and published anonymously a &#145;little devotional book&#146; entitled <span class="italic">The Enclosed Nun</span>, only revealing its authorship in a later book on St Francis's friend and disciple, <span class="italic">St Clare</span> (1912).<br>
<br>Morten, &#145;militant in spirit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Votes for Women</span>, 18 July 1913, 621), was a non-militant suffragist. She protested against the disenfranchisement of women by refusing to pay taxes, suffering instead the confiscation and public auctioning of some of her property. According to her friend the journalist Arthur Porritt, Morten submitted to more than one of these auctions in the months just before her death, of throat cancer, at Oakdene on 11 July 1913.<br>
