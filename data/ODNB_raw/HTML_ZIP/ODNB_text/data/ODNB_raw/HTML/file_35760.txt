<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Risley, Sir  Herbert Hope</span>  (1851&#150;1911), <span class="occ">administrator in India and anthropologist</span>, was born on 4 January 1851 at Akeley, Buckinghamshire, where his father, John Holford Risley, was rector. His mother was Frances, daughter of John Hope, at one time residency surgeon of Gwalior. On 13 July 1863 he was elected a scholar of Winchester College, a privilege which his ancestors had for many generations enjoyed as founder's kin. He won there the Goddard scholarship and the Queen's gold medal for the Latin essay, and in 1869 obtained a scholarship at New College, Oxford. He passed on 29 April 1871 the competitive examination for the Indian Civil Service, but he graduated BA in 1872 with a second class in law and modern history before he joined the service on 3 June 1873 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95501', "competition wallahs")</script>].<br>
<br>Posted to Midnapore as assistant collector, Risley at once became interested in district life, and until his death, despite service in the secretariat, he cultivated an intimate knowledge of the peoples of India. In 1910 he asserted that a knowledge of facts concerning the religions and habits of the peoples of India equipped a civil servant with a passport to popular regard. His zeal for work and his literary power early attracted the attention of the government, and Sir William Wilson Hunter, then engaged on the compilation of the <span class="italic">Gazetteer of Bengal</span> as director-general of statistics, made Risley on 15 February 1875 one of his five assistants, entrusting him with the accounts of Hazaribagh and Lohardaga. He rapidly rose to the rank of assistant secretary, and in 1879 was promoted to the imperial secretariat as under-secretary to the government of India in the home department. On 17 June 1879 he married, at Simla, Elsie Julie, daughter of Friedrich Oppermann of Hanover; they had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Despite his unusually rapid promotion, Risley's heart was still in the districts, and by his own wish he reverted to them, going to Govindpur in 1880, Hazaribagh, and then in 1884 to Manbhum, where he superintended the survey of the <i>ghatwali</i> and other forms of land tenure. In January 1885 he was employed on the congenial task of compiling information on the castes and occupations of the people of Bengal. He thus acquired a wide acquaintance with scientific authorities in Europe, including Paul Topinard, whose system of anthropological research Risley applied to India. His four-volume work entitled <span class="italic">The Tribes and Castes of Bengal</span> (1891&#150;2) was well received by the public as well as the government, and he was made an <i>officier</i> of the Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise in 1891. Next year he was created CIE. Continuing to work in the secretariat, in 1898 he was acting financial secretary to the government of India. In 1899 he was appointed census commissioner, and his monumental contribution to the census report of 1901 was epitomized in volume 1 of the new edition of the <span class="italic">Imperial Gazetteer of India</span> (1907). From the date of his report a new chapter was opened in Indian official literature, and the census volumes, until then regarded as dull, were at once read and reviewed in every country. His categorization of Indian castes and occupations had an enduring social and political effect.<br>
<br>In 1901 he became director of ethnography for India, and next year home secretary in Lord Curzon's administration, acting for a short time as member of council. He had served as member and secretary to the police commission in 1890, and his special knowledge was of great value to Lord Curzon in many administrative matters, including the partition of Bengal. When the administrative reforms suggested by Lord Morley came under the consideration of Lord Minto in 1908&#150;9, Risley proved an admirable instrument for the work in hand, and he was retained for two years beyond normal retiring age. With clear judgement and rare facility of expression Risley excavated from an enormous mass of official documents the main issues on reform, enlarged councils, and administrative changes, and he submitted the necessary points to Minto's council. Although every provincial government held different views, Risley directed the members of council to conclusions and compromises, and finally put their orders into resolutions, regulations, and laws. He was created CSI in 1904 and KCIE in 1907. In 1910 he returned to England to fill the post of permanent secretary in the judicial and public department at the India Office.<br>
<br>Despite the pressure of his secretarial labours, Risley continued to pursue his study of ethnography and anthropometry. He was more than once president of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and became president of the Royal Anthropological Institute in January 1910. On the processes by which non-Aryan tribes are admitted into Hinduism he was recognized to be the greatest living authority, and he argued on anthropometric grounds that the Kolarians south of Bengal are not to be distinguished from their Dravidian neighbours. He strongly advocated the addition of ethnology to the necessary training of civilians for work in India. His chief contributions to literature, besides those already cited, were the <span class="italic">Gazetteer of Sikhim: Introductory Chapter</span> (1894) and <span class="italic">The People of India</span> (1908; 2nd edn 1915). His work completely revolutionized the native Indian view of ethnological inquiry. A contemporary recorded:<blockquote>Twenty years ago, in his own province of Bengal, inquiries into the origin of caste and custom by men of alien creed were often &hellip; resented. Ethnology is now one of the recognised objects of investigation of the Vangiya Sahitya Parisat. (Anderson)</blockquote>Risley died at his home, South View, Hill Side, Wimbledon, Surrey, on 30 September 1911, pursuing almost to the last his favourite studies despite distressing illness. He was buried in Wimbledon cemetery. His widow married Sir Fenton John Aylmer, bt, in 1913 and died in 1934.<br>
