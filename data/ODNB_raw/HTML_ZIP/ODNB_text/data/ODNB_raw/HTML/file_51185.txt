<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Leyser,  Karl Joseph</span>  (1920&#150;1992), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 24 October 1920 in D&uuml;sseldorf, Nordrhein-Westfalen, son of Otto Leyser (1885&#150;1945) and his wife, Emmy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hayum (1891&#150;1987). He was educated at the Hindenburg Gymnasium, D&uuml;sseldorf. Otto was the head of a family firm which manufactured belts and braces, a scrupulous and successful businessman, but he and his wife were Jewish and suffered constant harassment after the National Socialists came to power. Denounced by a discontented employee in 1937, Otto and Emmy moved to the Netherlands, but sent their two children, Karl and his sister, Dorothea, to England. There charitable organizations and family connections, including the distinguished medievalist Wilhelm Levison, enabled Karl to attend St Paul's School. At the school he studied history under Philip Whitting, who had a high regard for him, and made lasting friendships, including one with Christopher Lloyd, the younger son of Nathaniel Lloyd of Great Dixter, Sussex. In 1939 he matriculated as a demy of Magdalen College, Oxford, but in 1940 was interned with other refugees and sent to the Isle of Man.<br>
<br>Leyser's readiness to join the Pioneer Corps, the only branch of the armed forces open to internees, together with some pressure from his college, secured his release before the end of the year. He served until 1943, with the rank of corporal, when he was transferred to the Black Watch. Commissioned in 1944, he served with the 51st division in north-western Europe, and in 1945 had the great felicity of finding his parents alive, in hiding in Edam, Noord Holland. His father died in August that year, but Leyser brought his mother to England, where she lived until her death in 1987. Demobilized in 1945 with the rank of captain, and mentioned in dispatches, Leyser returned to Magdalen in 1946. He won the Gibbs scholarship in history that year and graduated BA with first-class honours in modern history in 1947.<br>
<br>Leyser then began work on the Good Parliament of 1376, but his time for research was soon curtailed by his election to an official fellowship and tutorship at Magdalen, followed by a university lectureship in 1950. By that time he had begun to lecture on the Saxon and Hohenstaufen periods. He also expressed an interest in the early years of the Empress Matilda and in Anglo-German relations in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries. Those were long-laid plans. He later attributed his immensely productive concern with the empire, and particularly with the Ottonians, to an <i>obiter dictum</i> of Bruce McFarlane's that he should take advantage of his command of German and German sources. McFarlane's influence on him, beginning with his kindly concern during the war, in the bleak days of Leyser's internment, and subsequently for the rest of his own life, is hardly measurable, though much can be deduced from Leyser's perceptive notice of him in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the British Academy</span> in 1976; but there was more to his momentous decision than that. One very powerful consequence of his commitment, however, came when Henrietta Bateman, an undergraduate at St Hilda's, came to hear him on the Ottonians; they were married in 1962 and family life with their four children provided an enriching stability in Leyser's life.<br>
<br>The 1960s and 1970s were certainly a remarkably prolific time, despite Leyser's commitment to teaching in Magdalen, an obligation to which he might have been supposed, from his pupils' recollection, to have devoted his entire energies. His only monograph, <span class="italic">Rule and Conflict in Early Medieval Society: Ottonian Saxony</span>, appeared in 1979, but it was supported by a long line of papers, beginning with his essays on the Lechfeld and on Henry I and the foundation of the Saxon empire, and was followed by a strong company of others extending down to his Raleigh lecture of 1983, published in 1984, entitled &#145;The crisis of medieval Germany&#146;&#151;that is, on the great Saxon revolt of 1073, which, together with the power of the reformed papacy, faced down the accomplishments of Ottonian kingship. Elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1983, he was also appointed to the Chichele chair of medieval history, and held the chair from 1984 to his retirement in 1988. After a severe stroke in spring 1992 he died in Oxford on 27 May 1992, and was buried in Islip churchyard.<br>
<br>Karl Leyser's eminence was based upon a unique blend of German and English scholarship. His own experiences as a refugee, an alien who found solace in his new identity and most particularly in his marriage, gave a special and productive intensity to his work. He drew sparingly and with great skill on his military experience in illuminating the past, though he also valued it as a means further to relish Englishness. Naturalized in 1946, he served after the war in the Territorial Army as captain and major, and was awarded the Territorial decoration in 1963. He died at a time when he seemed about to enter an even more impressive phase of his professional life, but a serious road accident in 1977 had made him particularly aware of mortality, and neither he nor his friends would have felt that his time, most especially in those later years, had been ill spent.<br>
