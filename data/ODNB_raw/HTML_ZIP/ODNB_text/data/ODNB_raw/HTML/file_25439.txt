<span class="headword">Shirley,  Walter Augustus</span>  (1797&#150;1847), <span class="occ">bishop of Sodor and Man</span>, was born on 30 May 1797 at Westport, co. Mayo, Ireland, where his father was curate. He was the only son of Walter Shirley (1768&#150;1860) and his wife, Alicia, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20006/', "Sir Edward Newenham")</script>. His grandfather, also <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25438/', "Walter Shirley (1725&#150;1786)")</script>, was a cousin and collaborator of the countess of Huntingdon. At the age of nine Shirley was placed under the care of the Revd Legh Richmond, but as he seemed to be making little progress he was soon sent to a school at Linton in Cambridgeshire, and in 1809 he became a scholar of Winchester College. Six years later he was elected to a fellowship at New College, Oxford, which he held until 1828, and graduated BA (1819) and MA (1823). In 1822 he gained the chancellor's English essay prize for an essay entitled &#145;On the study of moral evidence&#146;.<br>
<br>Immediately after his ordination in 1820 Shirley took charge of the parish of Woodford, Northamptonshire, one of the livings held by his father. The following year he became curate of Parwich in Derbyshire, and in 1822 he was appointed lecturer at Ashbourne and curate of Atlow. He acted as English chaplain at Rome in the winter of 1826, where he got to know Thomas Erskine, the painter Charles Eastlake, and Baron von Bunsen, the German diplomat, and his wife, Frances. On 4 September 1827 in Paris he married Maria (<i>d</i>. 1854), daughter of William Waddington of Impington Hall, Cambridgeshire. They had a daughter and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25440/', "Walter Waddington Shirley (1828&#150;1866)")</script>, afterwards regius professor of ecclesiastical history at Oxford. In 1828 he succeeded his father as vicar of Shirley in Derbyshire, the ancient estate of the family, combining it with the adjoining parish of Brailsford from 1839 and with the archdeaconry of Derby from 1840. He was also rector of Whiston, Yorkshire, from 1837 to 1839.<br>
<br>In November 1846 Shirley was appointed bishop of Sodor and Man by Lord John Russell, but because he was seriously ill, the consecration was delayed until 10 January 1847. He had been elected Bampton lecturer at Oxford for that year, but lived only long enough to deliver two of the lectures, which with two others (undelivered) were published posthumously as <span class="italic">The Supremacy of Holy Scripture</span> (1847).<br>
<br>Shirley received a strict evangelical upbringing, but his kindly disposition prevented him from running to extremes of partisanship. Indeed in 1829 he alienated some of his friends by his outspoken advocacy of Catholic emancipation, as in later years he estranged others by refusing to support extreme measures against the Tractarians. In politics he was a constitutional whig, and both as an incumbent and as an archdeacon he exercised an energetic and effective ministry. He died at Bishop's Court, Isle of Man, on 21 April 1847, and eight days later was buried in the family vault of the church at Shirley.<br>
