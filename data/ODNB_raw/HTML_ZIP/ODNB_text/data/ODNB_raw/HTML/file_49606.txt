<span class="headword">Clayton,  Peter James</span>  (1927&#150;1991), <span class="occ">radio broadcaster and author</span>, was born on 25 June 1927 in Burghill Road, Sydenham, London, the only son of Charles Augustus Clayton (1891&#150;1961), a clerk with the Southern Railway, and his wife, Rachel Constance French (1894&#150;1985), who was a canteen assistant. He inherited a love of railways&#151;and in later life was still keen to share his knowledge with fellow enthusiasts. He was educated at Haberdashers' Aske's School, at Hatcham, where he was a devoted pupil of headmaster E. H. Goddard, who summed up Clayton's early talents as &#145;a dangerous facility for putting utter rubbish into good English&#146;  (private information). After leaving school in 1945 he did three years of national service in the RAF, serving mainly in Iraq and Kuwait. After demobilization in 1948 he was employed for a short while as a catering assistant with a hydroelectric scheme in the Scottish highlands (&#145;a porridge stirrer&#146; was his description of the job), before joining the staff of Greenwich Public Library, where he remained for seven years. He married Janet Mason (<i>b</i>. 1932), also a librarian, on 6 September 1952 and they had one daughter, Jo Anne, who was born in 1962. They moved to Princes Risborough in 1955 while he worked for a brief spell at High Wycombe Public Library.<br>
<br>Clayton had been brought up in a family where light and popular music were a shared pleasure, and his special interest in jazz began about 1942. The first professional move toward these prime areas of interest came in 1956 when he joined the publicity department of the Decca Record Company, which then had its headquarters in Brixton Road; he worked briefly in the cataloguing section before becoming assistant to Peter Gammond as creator and writer of popular and jazz record sleeves and other associated publicity publications. As an offshoot of these activities he and Gammond began a lifelong friendship and partnership that resulted in the publication of <span class="italic">A Guide to Popular Music</span> (1960); <span class="italic">Know about Jazz</span> (1963); <span class="italic">14 Miles on a Clear Night</span> (1966); <span class="italic">101 Things</span>, a book of cartoons which reflected his considerable talent as a comic artist (1966); and later <span class="italic">The Guinness A&#150;Z of Jazz</span> (1986) and <span class="italic">The Bluffer's Guide to Jazz</span> (1987). An intended partnership on <span class="italic">The Oxford Companion to Popular Music</span> (1991) was sadly curtailed by his increasing ill health.<br>
<br>Clayton left Decca in 1960 to work as a copy-writer with Green Shield and subsequently with an advertising agency, becoming a freelance journalist in 1963 or 1964. For a short time he edited the magazine of the National Jazz Federation, <span class="italic">Jazz News</span>, and he had the opportunity to broadcast. His natural talent for radio work was noted by producer Teddy Warwick, who started him off with some contributions to <span class="italic">The Jazz Scene</span>. His comfortable voice and deceptively casual approach, backed up by deep knowledge and careful research, marked him as a disciple of the Alistair Cooke school of witty wisdom and well-disguised pedantry, and led to a variety of programmes that included <span class="italic">Sounds of Jazz</span>, <span class="italic">Album Time</span>, <span class="italic">Round Midnight</span>, and <span class="italic">Jazz Parade</span>; most memorably, he was the regular presenter of <span class="italic">Jazz Record Requests</span> on BBC Radio 3 from 1972. He was equally well known to overseas audiences through his broadcasts on BBC World Service programmes, and he was much in demand as a comp&egrave;re at jazz festivals.<br>
<br>Clayton gradually widened his entertainment coverage both in broadcasting and as a regular columnist for the <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span> from 1964, which included a spell as a radio critic. From 1986 he contributed to the weekly magazine <span class="italic">Review</span>. He continued to present <span class="italic">Jazz Record Requests</span> until he became too ill to continue; nevertheless, he managed to make a brief final appearance when his old friend and colleague Charles Fox, who had stood in for him on the programme, died in May 1991. His last years were severely interrupted by illness. He was in King's College Hospital in 1988 and for a seven-week spell in 1990, when he became partly paralysed. He died, only a few weeks after making his last broadcast, in St Christopher's Hospice, Sydenham, on 10 August 1991, less than a mile from where he was born and had lived until he was evacuated to Oxted and Teignmouth during the war. He was cremated at Norwood crematorium, and was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Keith Stewart, who had been his BBC producer for many years, said that Peter Clayton was the finest broadcaster with whom he had ever worked. Radio was a medium to which he took naturally, his relaxed and persuasive way of drawing people out being based on a genuine personal interest in their talents and foibles. He had a great love of language and never descended to the common jargon of the popular music scene, and his voice had a rich quality underlined by calm and good humour. He was essentially a radio man and never as completely at ease on television.<br>
<br>Clayton was of short stature and, beyond walking, not much inclined toward physical exercise, and his energetic mode of life, involving much travel all over the country and late nights in dusty studios (with too few chances of relaxing at his cottage retreat in Lyme Regis), and hasty snacks, all took a heavy toll on his health. He had hoped to retire to Lyme Regis in 1990 and had become involved in the town's activities, including comp&egrave;ring concerts given by the town band. He wrote a privately printed booklet, <span class="italic">Walks in Lyme Regis</span>. In spite of his tribulations in the last few years, he managed to maintain his good-humoured approach and was ever loyal to old friends and associates. One could regret, as he frequently did himself, that the fleeting medium of broadcasting took up so much of his time and talent, for he was an accomplished writer and artist and might have achieved an even more lasting monument in these fields if he could have found the time and opportunity.<br>
