<span class="headword">Battier <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Fleming]</span>,  Henrietta</span>  (<em>c.</em>1751&#150;1813), <span class="occ">poet and satirist</span>, was the daughter of John Fleming of Staholmock, co. Meath, Ireland. She later wrote that &#145;strangers possess my paternal acres&#146;  (Battier, preface). By the age of eleven she was writing poetry; she thought well enough of a poem written that year (for Good Friday) to publish it in her collected volume. Her husband was the son of a Dublin banker of Huguenot extraction; they had at least four children. Although called Battier he was not Major John Gaspard Battier as has previously been thought.<br>
<br>Battier was probably the &#145;Polly Pindar, half-sister to Peter Pindar&#146;, whose <span class="italic">The Mousiad: an Heroic-Comic Poem</span> was published at Dublin in 1787 by P. Byrne. The poem and its typography closely resemble <span class="italic">The Lousiad: an Heroi-Comic Poem</span> by John Wolcot (&#145;Peter Pindar&#146;), whose first canto Byrne published in 1785. The pseudonym and general style even more closely resemble those of Battier's later satires. If this work is hers, she was at Ipswich in Suffolk on 21 May 1787: the <span class="italic">Mousiad's</span> preface &#145;To the reviewers&#146; is so dated.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, on a visit to London with her husband in 1783&#150;4, Battier had put together a volume of manuscript poems which she hoped to get published. She approached Samuel Johnson, who gave her his name to head her subscription list, together with warm encouragement and practical help towards securing more subscribers. Her hopes of publishing were dashed by Johnson's death, and further delayed by serious illness and the death of a child. Not until 1791 did her volume appear: <span class="italic">The protected fugitives: a collection of miscellaneous poems, the genuine products of a lady, never before published</span>. The poems (both personal and public, sentimental and sharply topical) show a remarkable talent, but little resemblance to her even more remarkable satire.<br>
<br>While in London, Battier appeared on stage at Drury Lane theatre, playing Lady Rachel Russell in three performances of Thomas Stratford's tragedy on the death of the protestant hero Lord Russell, a role she mentions in <span class="italic">The Protected Fugitives</span>  (Battier, 120&#150;33). She developed friendly relations with the clientele at the Shakespeare tavern, for whom she celebrated the duchess of Devonshire's famous electioneering of 1784  (ibid., 158&#150;62). She then, however, fell seriously ill. Her husband was ill too; her son died in September 1789; a daughter was probably already dead.<br>
<br>The same year as her collection, Battier published in Dublin her first known satire as &#145;Patt. Pindar&#146;: <span class="italic">The Kirwanade, or, Poetical Epistle. Humbly Addressed to the Modern Apostle</span>, in two separate parts, periodical-style. It opens magnificently:<blockquote>
<div>Unknowing either, and to both unknown,<br>
</div>
<div>An individual, fearless and alone,<br>
</div>
<div>I lift the Gauntlet, in full Chapter thrown<br>
</div>
<div>By THEE, O! K[irwa]n, with satanic grace &hellip;<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Her target, Walter Blake Kirwan, dean of Killala, a convert to the Church of Ireland from Catholicism, had subscribed to <span class="italic">The Protected Fugitives</span>. Battier threw down another gauntlet in <span class="italic">The Gibbonade, or, Political Reviewer</span> (three numbers, 1 May 1793&#150;12 September 1794). This attacked Lord Fitzgibbon (later earl of Clare) and praised the United Irishmen and the spirit of Swift (&#145;friend of Ierne&#146;). Battier had to struggle to keep afloat financially; she sold her own works from her poor lodgings at 17 Fade Street, Dublin, where undergraduates from Trinity College regularly dropped in. Thomas Moore the poet later remembered her as &#145;odd, acute, warm-hearted, and intrepid&#146;. His then boundless admiration for Battier's work cooled with time to the condescension he felt due to an old woman.<br>
<br>Battier's political lampoons probably sold well. In 1795 she published as &#145;Pat. T. Pindar&#146;, in Dublin and London, an exuberant <span class="italic">Marriage Ode Royal after the Manner of Dryden</span>, on the marriage of the prince of Wales. &#145;Royal&#146; in the title appears upside down. In 1797 came <span class="italic">The Lemon</span>, another trenchant reading of Irish politics, in 1799 <span class="italic">An Address on &hellip; the Projected Union</span>. This work, addressed to &#145;the Illustrious Stephen III, King of Dalkey, Emperor of the Mugglins, Grand Master of the Noble, Illustrious and Ancient Orders of the Lobster, Crab, Scallop&#146;, was written in Battier's capacity as poet laureate to a club of radicals for its annual festal day (a politicized festival of misrule) on the island of Dalkey near Dublin, as recounted in Moore's <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>. Battier died at Sandymount, Dublin, between September and November 1813.<br>
