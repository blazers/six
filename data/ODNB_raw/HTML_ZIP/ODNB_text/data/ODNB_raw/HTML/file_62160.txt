<span class="headword">McKay <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>McCarthy]</span>,  Margaret</span>  (1907&#150;1996), <span class="occ">politician and trade unionist</span>, was born at 308 Union Road, Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, on 22 January 1907, the eldest of the three children of Joseph McCarthy (1882/3&#150;1911), a spinner in a cotton mill who later became an insurance agent, and his wife, Betty (or Betsy) Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Catlow (1883&#150;1963). Her father was a Roman Catholic of Irish extraction, whose political sympathies were Liberal; her mother was of a long-established Lancashire Methodist family, who in earlier generations had worked as handloom weavers. It was a strongly political household. Margaret's father died aged twenty-nine, leaving her mother, who worked as a weaver, to bring up three young infants; she remarried in 1915 and became a member of the British Socialist Party; she died in 1963. After elementary schooling Margaret began work as a factory half-timer in a weaving mill and then obtained a post in the advertising department of a local newspaper. The family enjoyed two years' respite from the depression after the First World War, when they lived with Irish relatives in New Bedford, Connecticut.<br>
<br>Returning to Lancashire, Margaret McCarthy worked in a mill and joined the weavers' union in Accrington. She found companionship in the Independent Labour Party's Guild of Youth, but disagreed with the party's line towards the general strike (which she supported). In November 1926 she resigned from the guild, citing its failure to support unemployed young workers' entitlement to national assistance, and became a recruit to the Young Communist League, having earlier attended classes run by the National Council of Labour Colleges. In October 1927 she took part in a deputation of British trade unionists to the USSR, and was dazzled by the achievements of the revolution's first decade. In 1929 she moved to Burnley, where she was secretary of the local branch of the National Unemployed Workers' Movement, but in 1930 was required by the Communist Party to go to Glasgow, where she was a typist in the party's Scottish office. From June 1931 to June 1932 she worked in Moscow, monitoring the English press for the industrial section of the Comintern. Shortly after her return to Britain she left the Communist Party, apparently as a result of a dispute over a forged election document. Her commitment to, and then disenchantment with, communism dominated her autobiography.<br>
<br>After 1932 McCarthy turned her energies to the Labour Party and trade union movement. She became general secretary of the National Union of Domestic Workers and on 2 September 1939, in Glasgow, married William McKay (<i>b</i>. 1893/4), a journeyman housepainter who was divorced; he was the son of Jasper McKay, gardener. They had a daughter, Morag. Her husband left them in 1943 (and must have died by 1966, when Margaret was described as a widow), and Morag was largely brought up by her grandmother. Margaret often observed that most women would benefit more from a union card than a wedding ring. During the Second World War she worked for the naval victualling department in Lancashire, and then held administrative posts with the Civil Service Clerical Association and the Transport and General Workers' Union, where she was especially concerned with German and Polish refugees. In 1951 she became chief women's officer of the Trades Union Congress; she wrote <span class="italic">Women in Trade Union History</span> (1954) and contributed fashion advice to the magazine of the shop assistants' union. Her own fashion preferences included a love of hats, of which she was an avid collector; in appearance she was described as small, dark, bird-like, and lively, with energetic mannerisms. She did not get on with the TUC's general secretary, George Woodcock, and left in 1962 to become a public relations consultant for Unilever.<br>
<br>In 1959, sponsored by the Transport and General Workers' Union, McKay stood unsuccessfully as Labour candidate for Walthamstow East, but at the general election of 1964 she was elected for Clapham. Bored by debates in the House of Commons, she became involved with the United Nations Convention on the Status of Women. At its meeting in Tehran, in 1965, she began her association with the Arab world which dominated the rest of her life. Re-elected for Clapham in 1966&#151;despite the allegations of her opponent that she flitted between Middle Eastern capitals collecting trinkets from sheikhs&#151;she pursued an increasingly stormy political career. Following the Arab&#150;Israeli war of 1967 she became one of the few parliamentary exponents of the Arab position, and founded the Anglo-Saudi Parliamentary Association. Through the Anglo-Jordan Alliance, funded by Sheikh Zayed (later president of the United Arab Emirates), she arranged for MPs to visit the Palestinian territories; she captured media attention by establishing a Palestinian refugee camp in Trafalgar Square, and by wearing Arab robes in the House of Commons. She read her parliamentary speeches to Fatah guerrillas and befriended King Hussein of Jordan, who honoured her by issuing a postage stamp depicting her cradling a refugee baby. During an American lecture tour, in 1969, she stirred controversy by alleging that Jewish MPs unduly influenced British foreign policy.<br>
<br>While McKay repudiated charges of antisemitism, these episodes prompted questions about her funding and widened an existing rift with her constituency association and party whips, who despaired of her absences from parliament. Dubbed &#145;the woman on the Abu Dhabi omnibus&#146;, she was held to have neglected her Clapham constituents; in response, she accused her local party of being ignorant of the Middle Eastern situation, and of having been infiltrated by a Trotskyist&#150;Zionist cell. Just before the general election of 1970 she pre-empted a vote on her future by her constituency party and announced her retirement.<br>
<br>In 1971, at Sheikh Zayed's invitation, McKay emigrated to the United Arab Emirates, where she wrote on her adopted region and on women in history. Although continuing to arrange visits to the Middle East by British delegations, she became increasingly reclusive. She died on 1 March 1996 in Abu Dhabi, where she was buried in the Christian cemetery.<br>
