<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Scott, Sir  Harold Richard</span>  (1887&#150;1969), <span class="occ">civil servant and commissioner of police</span>, was born in Banbury on 24 December 1887, the youngest of three sons of Richard Scott, a skilled craftsman, and his wife, Hannah Hopecroft. The family moved to Taunton, and Scott won a scholarship to Sexey's School, Bruton. From there he went on to Jesus College, Cambridge, the first from his school to get a Cambridge scholarship. There he took three triposes in different subjects, securing a first in natural sciences (1907), a second in history (1908), and, after taking his BA, a first (with distinction) in modern languages (French) in 1909. In 1910 he took the first division examination for the civil service and secured a place in the Home Office, which he joined in 1911. Scott found that he and a contemporary were the only non-public-school boys in the administrative class in the department. He was soon caught up in the wartime expansion of government activity, being concerned mainly with the regulation of foreign trade. In 1916 he married Ethel Mary, daughter of James Golledge of Bruton, gentleman. They had a son and two daughters. After a brief spell in the newly created Ministry of Labour Scott returned to the Home Office in 1919.<br>
<br>There followed a period of ten years of overwork and stagnant promotion, but his career took off with his promotion first to assistant secretary and then as the chairman of the Prison Commission (1932&#150;9). Scott threw himself with enthusiasm into this exacting assignment. He had already established a good personal relationship with Alexander Paterson, whose influence on penal reform in the post-war period was outstanding, and he stood firm in the face of some ministerial pressure in the difficult period of unrest following the recent Dartmoor mutiny. Scott extended the scope of prisoners' employment, established the first open prison camp, and set up the Imperial Training School for prison officers at Wakefield, a pioneer effort in public service training.<br>
<br>When Sir John Anderson, the former head of the Home Office, was put in charge of a hastily improvised London civil defence organization during the Munich crisis, he appointed Scott as his chief staff officer, and when Anderson became minister for civil defence he made Scott responsible for the urgent task of accelerating London's civil defence arrangements, with the title of chief administrative officer for the London civil defence region, as from February 1939. Although London was bound to be the main target for attack, its preparations were seriously inadequate. The next two years were probably the most fruitful of Scott's public life. With a small administrative and professional staff he quickly imposed his personality and capacity for decision on the chaotic scene of London's local government. With the support of Herbert Morrison, the leader of the London county council, he brought together the most influential councillors and officers. For operational purposes the ninety-five local authority control centres were co-ordinated through nine group centres, working through an efficient communications system to the London regional headquarters established in the Geological Museum in South Kensington.<br>
<br>By the time war broke out the civil defence machine was ready to operate, although there was still much ground to make up, and good use was made of the unexpected respite before bombing started a year later. When the raids died down after May 1941 Scott was moved to the Ministry of Home Security, first as deputy (1941&#150;2) and then as permanent secretary (1942&#150;3). He then served for nearly two years as permanent secretary of the Ministry of Aircraft Production (1943&#150;5). At the end of 1944, most unexpectedly, Scott was asked by the home secretary, Herbert Morrison, to become commissioner of police of the metropolis.<br>
<br>Scott's years as commissioner (1945&#150;53) were generally regarded as successful. There were no startling innovations, as Scott found that his main task had to be the adaptation of the wartime organization of the Metropolitan Police to meet peacetime conditions, and he was hampered throughout by a manpower shortage for which it seemed that no solution could be found. Scott had the disadvantage, as commissioner, of looking like a civil servant in uniform, although in fact, with his powers of quick decision, he had no use for bureaucracy. He was respected as a fair-minded chief and a humane disciplinarian. He dealt firmly with industrial disputes and efficiently with the problems created by Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia's state visit, as well as with the great occasion of the coronation. He retired to the west country in 1953 after eight years. He wrote a highly successful book, <span class="italic">Scotland Yard</span> (1954), and a memoir, <span class="italic">Your Obedient Servant</span> (1959). Scott was an honorary fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge. He was appointed CB in 1933, KBE in 1942, KCB in 1944, and GCVO in 1953.<br>
<br>Scott was good-humoured, approachable, and unflappable. Confronted with a problem he would reduce it to its essentials, get on with producing a solution, and see that it was put into effect. He died on 19 October 1969 in Minehead, Somerset.<br>
