<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bell,  Quentin Claudian Stephen</span>  (1910&#150;1996), <span class="occ">art historian and potter</span>, was born into the heart of the Bloomsbury group on 19 August 1910, the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30681/', "(Arthur) Clive Heward Bell (1881&#150;1964)")</script>, art critic, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30694/', "Vanessa Bell (1879&#150;1961)")</script>, painter, and the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36271/', "Sir Leslie Stephen")</script>. Brought up at 46 Gordon Square (where he was born) and, during school holidays, at the house his parents leased at Charleston in Sussex, he was educated at Peterborough Lodge in Swiss Cottage, London, and at Leighton Park School, the Quaker boarding-school in Reading. In contrast to his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61593/', "Julian Heward Bell")</script>, he left school at the age of seventeen intending to become a painter. Following a tour of central European galleries with Roger Fry, he spent periods of time in both Paris and Rome.<br>
<br>In 1933 Bell contracted chest infections which led to seven months in a sanatorium in Switzerland (leaving him with a lifelong aversion to the Alps) followed by convalescence near Monaco, where he began a history of the principality. In 1935 he was again painting in Rome, and his collages were exhibited at the Mayor Gallery. But later that year he decided to become a potter rather than a painter and enrolled himself at Burslem School of Art. While living in Stoke-on-Trent he was also active in the affairs of the local Labour Party. Two years later he returned to Charleston, installed a kiln, and continued his political activities both in Sussex and with the Artists' International Association. On the outbreak of the Second World War he would have joined up, but was prevented from doing so on account of his medical history. Instead he worked as a labourer on Maynard Keynes's farm at Tilton in Sussex and helped his mother and Duncan Grant with the mural decorations of Berwick church, before being given a job in the political warfare department of the Foreign Office by David Garnett.<br>
<br>In 1947 Bell published his first major book, <span class="italic">On Human Finery</span>, a pioneering study of the history of fashion, much influenced by the writings of Thorstein Veblen. Following his marriage on 16 February 1952 to (Anne) Olivier Popham, art historian, and the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35576/', "Arthur Ewart Popham")</script>, keeper of prints and drawings at the British Museum, he needed an income and was appointed to a senior lectureship at King's College, Newcastle upon Tyne, by his friend Lawrence Gowing. In 1959 he and his family&#151;including three young children, Julian, Virginia, and Cressida&#151;moved to Leeds, where he was a lecturer in the department of fine art and, from 1962 to 1967, its inaugural professor. In 1963 he published a short study of Ruskin and <span class="italic">The Schools of Design</span>, a scholarly study of the origins of the national system of art education. In 1964 he was appointed Slade professor of fine art at Oxford University and, in 1965, Ferens professor of fine art at Hull. He was a racy lecturer with a particular interest in Victorian painting.<br>
<br>In 1967 Bell returned south to Sussex to become professor of the history and theory of art at Sussex University and bought a large house under the downs, close to Charleston. The move coincided with an invitation to write the biography of his aunt Virginia Woolf. From this point onwards he was increasingly involved in the revival of public interest in Bloomsbury. He published a succinct analysis of the group in 1968, and his biography of Virginia Woolf was published in two volumes in 1972 to great acclaim.<br>
<br>After retiring from his post at Sussex in 1975, Bell was able to spend more time and energy on his pottery. In 1985 he and his wife, Olivier, moved to a smaller house next door to the park in Firle and each morning he would wake up early and disappear to his kiln, only emerging for gin and ginger beer in the evening. He undertook a mixture of work, some rough, painted plates and mugs, which he saw as belonging to an artisan tradition, but also more ambitious ceramic sculpture. Neither style fitted comfortably within the work of contemporaries, as his pots were too utilitarian to be regarded as art and his ceramic sculpture too conventionally figurative. But this in no way deterred him from turning out a great amount of work which was both vigorous and affordable, a crossover between the Omega workshop and folk art.<br>
<br>By the 1980s Bell had very much inherited the mantle of Bloomsbury and was a sage-like figure with a white beard and a humorous, slightly quizzical air, dispensing information and advice to the many visiting academics who came to research the lives of his family. He was particularly instrumental in establishing the Charleston Trust, which was responsible for saving his mother's house, but he also found time to write a pseudo-Victorian novella, <span class="italic">The Brandon Papers</span> (1985), and to collect his essays and lectures in <span class="italic">Bad Art</span> (1989). In the 1990s he embarked on his autobiography, but discovered that he was much better at writing about others than about himself. In the end it emerged as a series of character sketches, <span class="italic">Elders and Betters</span> (1995), which revealed his own character only intermittently in a series of dry asides. Gradually weakened by ill health, he died at his home, 81 Heighton Street, Firle, Sussex, on 16 December 1996. He was survived by his wife, Olivier, and their three children.<br>
