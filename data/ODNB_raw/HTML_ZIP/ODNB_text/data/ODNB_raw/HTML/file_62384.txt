<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pickard,  Percy Charles</span>  (1915&#150;1944), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born at 82 Main Road, Handsworth, Sheffield, on 16 May 1915, the youngest in the family of two sons and three daughters of Percy Pickard, stone merchant, and his wife, Jennie Skelton. In 1920 the family moved to Hampstead, London, where Pickard's father began a successful catering business that later became part of the Mecca Organisation. After an undistinguished academic career at Framlingham College, Suffolk, Pickard left for Kenya in 1932, where he farmed for four years and earned a three handicap at polo. In November 1935 he joined the King's African rifles reserve as a territorial.<br>
<br>After returning to England in 1936, Pickard failed to qualify as an army officer, but was accepted by the RAF and was commissioned in 1937 as a pilot officer in the Royal Air Force reserve of pilots (for which his public school education qualified him) and was posted to Bomber Command. By 1939 he was assistant and personal pilot to Air Marshal Sir John Baldwin, commandant of the RAF college at Cranwell. On 11 November 1939 he married (against her parents' wishes), at Caxton Hall register office, Westminster, Dorothy Hodgkin (1912/13&#150;1998), daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Harry Sidney Hodgkin and his wife, Elsie Gray McMordie, daughter of a former lord mayor of Belfast. They had a son, born in 1943.<br>
<br>Promoted to squadron leader in 1940, &#145;Pick&#146; Pickard gained a well-deserved reputation for leadership (he was awarded the DFC in July 1940), if a touch eccentric in his methods. He took his wife's sheepdog, Ming, on training flights as an &#145;Observer&#146;, and relaxed from flying bombers by solo acrobatic flying in tiger moths. In early 1941 he was posted to command 311 (Czech) squadron, and gained the DSO in March. Blond, pipe-smoking, and 6 feet 4 inches tall, he came to the notice of the film director Harry Watt, who chose him to star as the pilot of the Wellington bomber &#145;F for Freddy&#146; in the Crown Film Unit's documentary feature, <span class="italic">Target for Tonight</span> (1941). Subsequently he was flight commander with 9 squadron, where he met Sergeant John Alan (&#145;Bill&#146;) Broadley, who joined him as a regular navigator.<br>
<br>In November 1941 Pickard took command of 51 squadron, with the rank of wing commander. He led the force of twelve Whitley bombers which successfully dropped paratroopers at Bruneval on the French coast during the night of 27&#150;28 February 1942 to capture, examine, and destroy a German radar station. After doing a reprise of the Bruneval drop for the king and queen, Pickard was given the opportunity by George VI to explain how Pickard's boot-black footprints and backside came to decorate the mess ceiling. For his part in the Bruneval raid he was awarded his second DSO in May 1942. In October 1942 he was given command of 161 squadron at RAF Tempsford; from there, with his exceptionally gifted pilots flying Lysanders and Hudsons, he took part in Special Operations Executive missions over occupied France. Awarded a second bar to his DSO in March 1943, he became the first RAF officer during the Second World War to be awarded the DSO three times. In May 1943, handpicked by Air Vice-Marshal Basil Embry, commander of no. 2 group, Tactical Air Force, he was promoted acting group captain and given command of 140 wing. Throughout winter 1943&#150;4 his wing attacked German V-1 rocket sites in the Pas-de-Calais.<br>
<br>On 18 February 1944, commanding his wing (487 squadron Royal New Zealand Air Force, 464 squadron Royal Australian Air Force, and 21 squadron RAF, and one photographic reconnaissance aircraft) now based at Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, Pickard led operation Jericho. The objective of the raid, originally designated by the codename operation Renovate, was to breach the walls of the prison at Amiens in order to free members of the French Resistance movement, some of whom were facing imminent execution at the hands of the Germans. It was a daylight raid, comprising nineteen Mosquitos, requiring precision bombing from low level (50 ft). After the first two waves of bombers had successfully blasted open sections of the walls, Pickard stayed behind to assess the impact, but was attacked by two German Focke-Wulf fighters, and shot down near the village of St Gratien, 5 miles north-east of Amiens. He and Flight Lieutenant Broadley, his navigator, were killed. They were buried by the Germans on the following day in the cemetery of St Pierre, next to the prison at Amiens.<br>
<br>Pickard's lack of experience of low-level sorties had, in the view of Embry, who organized the operation, contributed to his death. Embry had intended to lead the operation himself, but was forbidden to do so by his commanding officer, Air Chief Marshal Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory, commanding the allied expeditionary force. In his memoirs Embry wrote:<blockquote>It is impossible to measure Charles Pickard's loss to the RAF and Britain, but in courage, devotion to duty, fighting spirit and powers of real leadership, he stood out as one of the great airmen of the war and as a shining example of British manhood. (Embry, 264)</blockquote>After the war Pickard's widow and son emigrated to Southern Rhodesia. As a memorial to Pickard and his friend Broadley, a Mosquito repainted and re-coded to represent the aircraft that they flew to Amiens, is on exhibition at the De Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre, London Colney, near St Albans.<br>
