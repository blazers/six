<span class="headword">Gibbs,  Antony</span>  (1756&#150;1815), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born at the family home in the cathedral close in Exeter and baptized on 3 March 1756 at Mint Presbyterian Meeting-House, Exeter, the sixth in the family of five sons and six daughters of George Abraham Gibbs (<i>c</i>.1724&#150;1794), surgeon at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, and his wife, Anne Vicary; an elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10608/', "Sir Vicary Gibbs")</script>, became chief justice of common pleas.<br>
<br>Gibbs went to Exeter grammar school. He was then apprenticed for five years to a Mr Brook of Exeter, a merchant in the Spanish trade. His first trading venture was in 1788 as a woollen exporter, principally to Spain and Italy; he was also briefly involved with a woollen-cloth factory near Exeter. On 3 October 1784 he married Dorothea Barnetta (1760&#150;1820), the youngest daughter of William Hucks, a Yorkshire wine merchant; they had seven children, two of whom died in infancy. In 1787&#150;9, in circumstances that are unclear, he got into financial difficulties, losing not only his own money but some of his family's: it became a matter of pride to make good those losses.<br>
<br>The first step in Gibbs's financial recovery involved setting up an agency business in Madrid to serve English and other textile manufacturers. In August 1789 he took ship with his wife and children to Corunna, thence overland to Madrid. His family found the hot summers unbearable and in 1792 they returned, in poor health. Early in 1793 Gibbs suffered a terrible accident when the carriage he was travelling in from Madrid to Seville went out of control&#151;he fell from it, and was run over by one of the wheels. Later, he joined a partnership in Malaga to sell Spanish produce in England. When Spain declared war in 1796, Gibbs faced another financial crisis; but he was eventually able to use Lisbon as an illicit (and profitable) means of entry to the Spanish market for English woollens. When peace came in 1801, he was able to set up a profitable business in Cadiz. However, the outbreak of war again in 1805 forced him to close in Cadiz, and once more he had to struggle to survive. A key to the realization of his assets in Spain was a perilous shipment to Peru; the success of at least the outward journey meant financial relief, but it was not until the war with Spain ended in 1808 that Gibbs's difficulties really began to abate. The reopening of the Cadiz house, and the opening of a London house in partnership with his eldest son, (George) Henry Gibbs (1785&#150;1842), under the style Antony Gibbs &amp; Son, marked the beginning of a period of real prosperity. Debts were paid and a profitable trade to and from the south of Spain energetically fostered. He moved his family from Great Russell Street to Denmark Hill in 1809, to Dulwich Common in 1810, and in 1812 brought them back to a house in Powis Place, where they remained until his death.<br>
<br>The siege of Cadiz by the French between 1810 and 1812 led to the closure of the Cadiz house; but when the siege was abandoned trade and profits rapidly regained their former levels. In 1813 his second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/89656/', "William Gibbs")</script>&#151;later the developer of Tyntesfield, near Bristol&#151;was taken into partnership, and the London house became Antony Gibbs &amp; Sons.<br>
<br>By 1814 Gibbs was suffering not only from his earlier carriage accident but also from severe loss of memory. Shortly after returning from a visit to Redland, he suffered a stroke on 5 December 1815; he died five days later at his house, 2 Powis Place, Great Ormond Street, London. In his will he left everything to his wife, so that her income and assets depended on the firm's prosperity. It was the trading contacts that he had established in Spain which enabled his firm, after his death, to exploit so efficiently the opportunities afforded in South America after its liberation from Spanish control.<br>
