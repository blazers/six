<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stuart,  John Patrick  Crichton-</span>, third marquess of Bute  (1847&#150;1900), <span class="occ">civic benefactor and patron of architecture</span>, was born at Mount Stuart, Isle of Bute, Scotland, on 12 September 1847. He was the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37322/', "John Crichton-Stuart, second marquess (1793&#150;1848)")</script>, and his second wife, Sophia Frederica Christina (1809&#150;1859), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12568/', "Francis Hastings, first marquess of Hastings")</script>, and Flora, in her own right countess of Loudoun. His father died in 1848, and he was orphaned in 1859 by the death of his mother; he became a ward in chancery in 1861. He was educated at Harrow School and Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1865. A man of scholarly interests from an early age, his guiding passion was his reverence for ancient institutions. The Presbyterian religion in which he had been brought up was one of the first casualties of his medievalism. At Oxford he studied the forms of eastern and western Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism, and shortly after reaching his majority, he was received into the Roman Catholic church at the chapel of the Sisters of Notre Dame, Southwark, on 8 December 1868. His conversion caused a great sensation, and the incident is believed to have inspired the plot of Disraeli's novel <span class="italic">Lothair</span>. His Catholicism was reinforced by his marriage on 16 April 1872 to the Hon. Gwendolen Mary Anne (1854&#150;1932), eldest daughter of Edward Howard, first Baron Howard of Glossop [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13895/', "Howard, Edward George Fitzalan-")</script>], from an old Catholic family. They had three sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>On coming of age Bute acquired control of his Scottish and Welsh estates, and the tremendous wealth which they generated. Under his ownership the Cardiff docks (which his father had begun building) were completed, contributing substantially to the prosperity of that city. He sought to re-establish the political dominance of his family in south Wales, but much authority had been lost during his long minority. His connections with the city were strong: he was twice mayor in the 1890s, and president of University College, Cardiff. He was proud of his Scottish heritage, and maintained a close identification with that country. His conviction of the superiority of ancient institutions led him to advocate home rule for Scotland, although in all other respects his political views were conservative. He wrote extensively on Scottish history and institutions, and became a benefactor of the universities of St Andrews and Glasgow, providing the former with a chair of anatomy, a medical hall, and a students' union building. He was twice elected rector of St Andrews University, serving in that office between 1892 and 1898. His benefaction to Glasgow University enabled the completion, in 1882, of Bute Hall, which was built to the designs of George Gilbert Scott and John Oldrid Scott to accommodate ceremonial occasions, such as graduations, and examinations.<br>
<br>Bute travelled extensively, particularly in the Middle East, and made a systematic study of the languages of the countries he visited. In 1882 he published a translation of the Coptic morning service, and in 1891 a study of the language of Tenerife. His greatest literary project, begun within two years of his conversion, was an English translation of a pre-Reformation breviary, published in 1879 in two volumes. He went on to translate the services for many of the major festivals, and was closely involved in the preparation of a <i>proprium sanctorum</i> for Scotland. He was greatly interested in all questions relating to liturgy, ritual, and church architecture. In addition to his own work, he was a great patron of scholars working on matters relating to the church, and many important texts, such as Sir William Fraser's edition of <span class="italic">Registrum monasterii S. Marie de Cambuskenneth, <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 1147&#150;1535</span> (1872) and works on Irish saints, the Friars Preachers of Ayr, and the <span class="italic">Itinerary of Edward I</span> (1901) edited by Gough, were issued at his expense.<br>
<br>Above all, Bute was a great patron of architecture. His collaboration with William Burges in the rebuilding of Cardiff Castle and the recreation of Castell Coch provided two of the masterpieces of the Gothic revival. The intensity of the colours, the extent of the decorative detail, and the specially designed furnishings gave these distinctive buildings a lasting interest; the symbolic schemes which guided the decoration were devised by Bute, and put into effect by the architect, &#145;soul-inspiring Burges&#146;. In the Gothic style Bute's medievalism and Catholicism found aesthetic expression. Mount Stuart on the Isle of Bute was rebuilt in Florentine style, after a disastrous fire in 1877, by Sir Robert Rowand Anderson under Bute's direction. His interest in building extended to archaeology and the restoration of ancient monuments: among other sites, he was responsible for the excavations of the houses of the Greyfriars and Blackfriars in Cardiff, and of Whithorn Priory in Galloway, and for carrying out restoration work at Rothesay and Falkland castles, and St Andrew's Priory, and for beginning the restoration of Caerphilly Castle.<br>
<br>In the 1890s, Bute developed an interest in spiritualism and the investigation of psychic phenomena; he subsidized an enquiry into second sight in the Scottish highlands conducted by Ada Goodrich-Freer, and, in 1899, with the same lady published a book concerning the alleged haunting of Ballechin House in Perthshire. He purchased the <span class="italic">Scottish Review</span>, and from 1882 until his death he contributed to it frequently, the range of his articles reflecting the variety of his interests, from &#145;Ancient Celtic Latin hymns&#146; to &#145;The Bayreuth festival&#146;, from translations of Turgenev to &#145;Parliament in Scotland&#146;. A natural scholar, Bute took little active part in the political life of the nation. His profound medievalism gave him a feudal outlook, while his sense of the duties of wealth and position was reinforced by his Catholicism.<br>
<br>In August 1899 Bute had an apoplectic attack, from which he in great measure recovered. The following October, while at his residence Dumfries House, he experienced another seizure, and died the following day, 9 October 1900. He was buried in the chapel at Mount Stuart, and, in accordance with his instructions, his heart was buried on the Mount of Olives at Jerusalem on 13 November 1900.<br>
