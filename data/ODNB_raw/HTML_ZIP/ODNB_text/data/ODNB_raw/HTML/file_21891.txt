<span class="headword">Penrose,  John</span>  (1778&#150;1859), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and theological writer</span>, was born at Cardinham, Cornwall, on 15 December 1778, the eldest son of John Penrose (1753&#150;1829), then vicar of that parish, and afterwards rector of Fledborough and vicar of Thorney, both near Newark, Nottinghamshire, and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1818), second daughter of the Revd John Trevenen.<br>
<br>Penrose was educated at home, and for a short time from 1794 to 1795 at Tiverton School. From there he went to Exeter College, Oxford, but stayed only three months before moving to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, to take up an exhibition. He graduated BA in 1799 and MA in 1802. After teaching for a few months, he was ordained at Exeter in 1801, and he officiated at the chapelry of Marazion in Cornwall until he left Penzance in 1802. Afterwards, he held the vicarage of Langton by Wragby, Lincolnshire, (1802&#150;59) and that of Poundstock, Cornwall (1803&#150;9). In 1805 he returned to Oxford to study, and was Bampton lecturer in 1808, in which capacity he wrote his <span class="italic">Attempt to Prove the Truth of Christianity</span>, published in that year. In 1809 he became vicar of Bracebridge, near Lincoln.<br>
<br>It was while living and teaching in Harefield, Middlesex, at this time that Penrose met and fell in love with Elizabeth (1780&#150;1837), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4813/', "Edmund Cartwright (1743&#150;1823)")</script> and Alice Whittaker. They were married on 6 May 1814 and settled in Bracebridge that summer. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21889/', "Elizabeth Penrose")</script> was a children's historical author and teacher, writing under the pseudonym Mrs Markham. John (<i>d</i>. 1888), their first son, was born in 1815; his twin brother was stillborn. Two more boys followed: Charles Thomas (1816?&#150;1868) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35467/', "Francis Cranmer Penrose (1817&#150;1903)")</script>, who was to become an architect and astronomer.<br>
<br>Over the next forty years Penrose published a large quantity of mainly religious works, notably <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Nature of Human Motives</span> (1820) and <span class="italic">Of Christian Sincerity</span> (1829). In 1837 his wife died. The same year, he was awarded the perpetual curacy of North Hykeham, Lincolnshire. In his later life, as well as sermons and treatises, he published the lives of his paternal and maternal uncles, Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Vinicombe Penrose and Captain James Trevenen, as well as, privately, a memoir of his father.<br>
<br>Penrose died at Langton by Wragby on 9 August 1859, and was buried in the churchyard there.<br>
