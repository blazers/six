<span class="headword">Siward, Sir  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1248), <span class="occ">mercenary and courtier</span>, has obscure origins. In his earliest appearances he is Richard son of Siward, indicating English ancestry and the name of a father or earlier progenitor. It is probable that he was the young man of that name from Farnham in Lower Nithsdale, Yorkshire, who was accused of homicide late in John's reign, arrested, but later released into the military household of an unnamed Yorkshire magnate. Coincidentally, the first certain appearance of Sir Richard is about 1215 in the retinue of William de Forz, count of Aumale, lord of Holderness in Yorkshire's East Riding. Along with other former Aumale followers Richard Siward was retained in the household of William (II) Marshal, earl of Pembroke, and appeared with him in London in 1216, by which time he had achieved the status of knight. He was later reputed to have played a role in the sea battle off Sandwich in 1217. He again fought for the count of Aumale in his rebellion at the end of 1220. Siward escaped the siege of Bytham, and for a period of a week or two in February 1221 in the Forest of Cliff, Northamptonshire, he held off a royal army. He surrendered and left the kingdom, but was pardoned in September of that year.<br>
<br>In 1223 Siward was once again in the retinue of Earl William Marshal and followed him over the next few years into Wales, Ireland, and Brittany. He received manors and rents from his patron. The Marshal connection also brought him into friendship with the Basset family of Headington and High Wycombe, for Gilbert Basset was a prominent Marshal banneret. In October 1229 Siward married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47229/', "Philippa Basset (d. 1265)")</script>, Gilbert's cousin and daughter of Thomas Basset of Headington, only a few weeks after the death of her first husband, Henry (II) de Newburgh, earl of Warwick. This was the turning point of Siward's career, for Philippa brought him control of her share of the lands of Basset of Headington and her handsome dower settlement from the Warwick estates.<br>
<br>The Basset connection brought Siward less profitable consequences in 1233, when Gilbert Basset fell into royal disfavour. Siward shared in his disgrace, being accused (wrongly) of marrying Philippa without royal licence. Siward and Basset found shelter in Gwent with Earl Richard Marshal, who then rebelled against Henry III. On the earl's behalf Richard Siward led several daring forays out of Netherwent and deep into England. One of these was in late September 1233, when Siward and several score of raiders rode across England into Berkshire and pillaged a manor of Bishop Peter des Roches. On 29 October Siward liberated the fugitive Hubert de Burgh from his sanctuary in Devizes church, leading his force of knights and Welsh mercenaries into the town in a fog, causing the Welsh to give their war-cry and the townspeople and besiegers to flee in the belief that Prince Llywelyn's men had come. The force and de Burgh returned, meeting boats at Aust, Gloucestershire, on the Bristol Channel, which ferried his party back safely to Chepstow and Earl Richard Marshal, despite encountering a hostile royalist fleet and military force from Bristol. This and like episodes made Siward's name synonymous with opposition to the obnoxious &#145;Poitevin&#146; regime in 1233&#150;4, and accounts for his subsequent fame.<br>
<br>At the conclusion of the Marshal&#150;Basset rebellion in May 1234 Richard Siward was pardoned, appointed to the king's council, and given temporary keeping of Glamorgan and the castle of Bolsover, Derbyshire. He had fees in Glamorgan from the king or the earl marshal, and in England from de Burgh. Alexander II of Scotland gave him the castle and lordship of Kellie, with other lands in Aberdour, Fife. However, Siward's career was uneven. In 1236 he had both the honour of carrying the sceptre at the queen's coronation, and the disgrace of imprisonment through the machinations of a court cabal. He survived this plot, and was retained in the royal household (for an annual fee of 100 marks), in 1242 serving as a banneret with the king's army in Poitou. It may be that at this time he was retained also by Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester, who had awarded him a money fee before 1245.<br>
<br>But difficulties began to close in around Siward. His friend Gilbert Basset died in 1241, and Philippa Basset, his wife, somehow managed to obtain a swift divorce from Siward by the autumn of 1242. After this he seems to have retired for a time to his Scottish estates. Siward received another blow when Richard de Clare, earl of Gloucester and Hertford, and lord of Glamorgan, had him arrested on 5 July 1245 while going, unsuspecting, to a meeting of the Glamorgan county court. The earl's avowed justification was that Siward had sided with a Welsh magnate of the area against him, but it is evident that the earl's chief purpose was to reclaim areas of his lordship abstracted from the St Quintin family by Siward while the earl was a minor. Siward's castle of Tal-y-fan and extensive lordship of Llanblethian were confiscated. He disputed the disseisin before the king in 1247 and was still in pursuit of justice in July 1248. He died soon after a crippling stroke, by the end of the same year. He left to the wardship of King Alexander an under-age son, also Richard Siward, whom he had with Philippa, and an adult bastard called Daniel, to whom he had given lands at Merthyr Mawr in Glamorgan before 1245.<br>
<br>Siward's career is a remarkable story of social advancement based solely on military prowess. Like the career of the elder William Marshal, it shows the importance of finding the right patron. It is doubtful whether Siward would have risen far in a hostile and increasingly class-conscious world without such support. A marcher writer calls him Richard Severus, which would seem to be an ironic contemporary nickname for him among the literate clergy and laity, alluding to the great philosopher&#150;emperor, whose urbanity, education, and piety Richard Siward must too obviously have lacked.<br>
