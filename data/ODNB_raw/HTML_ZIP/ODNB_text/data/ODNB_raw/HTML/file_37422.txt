<span class="headword">Forbes,  George</span>  (1849&#150;1936), <span class="occ">electrical engineer and inventor</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 5 April 1849, the younger son&#151;there were also three daughters&#151;of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9832/', "James David Forbes (1809&#150;1868)")</script> and Alicia Wauchope (<i>d</i>. 1885). His father was later principal of St Andrews University and was an expert in the field of glacier flow. Forbes was educated at Edinburgh Academy, the University of St Andrews, and at Christ's College and St Catharine's College, Cambridge. He graduated BA in 1871. In 1872 he succeeded Alexander Herschel as professor of natural philosophy at Anderson's University, Glasgow (later the Royal Technical College and then the University of Strathclyde). He retained this post until 1880. Significantly, in view of his later work, his lectures included the advocacy of electricity as a means of traction. His chief work at this time was research into the velocity of light with James Young; however, their results, published in 1882, showed a higher velocity than was later accepted. In 1880 he predicted the existence of a trans-Neptunian planet, fifty years before the discovery of Pluto. In 1874 Forbes led a British expedition to Hawaii to observe the transit of Venus. He then returned to Scotland via Peking (Beijing) and St Petersburg, crossing the Gobi Desert and Siberia in 1875. As a result of the contacts he made on this journey, Forbes was able to become the only British war correspondent with the Russian army in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877&#150;8, reporting for <span class="italic">The Times</span>.<br>
<br>In 1880 Forbes resigned from Anderson's and moved to London; for the next two decades he worked extensively in the field of electrical power engineering. He was commissioned to report on how the City and South London Railway should be powered, and recommended electricity, a significant conclusion for the future of the London underground. In 1881 he served as a juror at the Paris Exposition Internationale d'El&eacute;ctricit&eacute;. In the following year he became manager of the British Electric Light Company, manufacturers of carbon filaments and arc lamps, and at this time began to apply himself to improvements in products and processes. The growing use of electricity made some form of metering essential. Forbes was one of several who invented machines for metering alternating current, though his was never adopted. Of far greater significance was his idea that the brushes in electric motors should be made of carbon rather than the wire or gauze which was then employed. In 1885 he took out a patent for the &#145;improved means for establishing electric connection between surfaces in relative motion applicable to the collectors of dynamo machines&#146; in which he advocated the use of carbon as a current collector for rotating electrical machines. His suggestion would prove outstandingly successful and the practice was still almost universal a century later. This invention could have made him a very rich man, but he sold his American patent rights to the Westinghouse Company for &pound;2000 and there is no evidence that he received any British royalties.<br>
<br>From 1891 to 1895 Forbes was consulting engineer on the Niagara Falls hydroelectric scheme, reporting to a panel chaired by Lord Kelvin. He initiated a number of design innovations, though this consultancy was not without some technical controversy with Ferranti and C. E. L. Brown, who were also employed on the project. He also advised on other schemes, in India (1893), southern Africa (1895), New Zealand (1896), and Upper Egypt (1897&#150;8). He recommended to Lord Kitchener the use of electric locomotives on the railway then being built across the Nubian Desert, and he made similar proposals with respect to the Nile region. In southern Africa he consolidated his friendship with Sir David Gill, the astronomer.<br>
<br>After the turn of the century, Forbes turned his attention to military work, studying techniques of gunnery and qualities of ballistics. He invented an infantry rangefinder which was used successfully in the South African War in 1902, and between 1903 and 1906 he worked with the Admiralty on rangefinders and related matters. The gunsight he developed was still in use by the navy at the outset of the Second World War. During the First World War he was involved in devising methods of signalling for submarines.<br>
<br>In 1906 Forbes built a home near Pitlochry to house the books and memorabilia of his father. This house, which he liked to call &#145;The Shed&#146;, was a large wooden structure with an observatory on the upper storey overlooking Loch Faskally and the hydroelectric scheme which he had first proposed in the early 1900s. He now returned to an earlier interest, from 1906 to 1930 delivering the David Elder lectures on astronomy at the Royal Technical College in Glasgow. Forbes received many honours, including the Russian order of St George (for his services during the Russo-Turkish War) and the French L&eacute;gion d'honneur. He was elected FRS in 1887. He was also FRSE, FRAS, and a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, the Vienna Astronomiches Verein, the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia, and the American Philosophical Society. He was elected a member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1881, served on its council 1885&#150;9, and was its vice-president in 1894&#150;5. He received an honorary LLD from St Andrews.<br>
<br>Forbes did not marry and, in his last years, became something of a recluse. Though he was described in his obituaries as a man with a stern code of honour who thought much of his work and little of his reward, he seems to have been disillusioned that his obvious talents had earned him neither fame nor fortune (there is evidence that he had hoped at one point for a knighthood). He lived in increasing poverty, though in 1928 friends did successfully petition a variety of organizations for assistance on his behalf. His politics were Conservative and he is unlikely to have been comfortable with the developments of the Ramsay MacDonald era: indeed, in the 1920s he complained to a colleague that &#145;even the Tories are all damn socialists&#146;  (Duthie, 66).<br>
<br>Forbes published extensively. Titles included <span class="italic">The Transit of Venus</span> (1874), <span class="italic">Lectures on Electricity</span> (1888), <span class="italic">Alternating and Interrupted Electric Currents</span> (1895), <span class="italic">History of Astronomy</span> (1909), <span class="italic">Star Talks to Boy Scouts</span> (1911), <span class="italic">David Gill, Man and Astronomer</span> (1916), and <span class="italic">The Wonder and the Glory of the Stars</span> (1926), plus numerous contributions to the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> and <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> of the Royal Society, the Royal Astronomical Society, the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Royal Society of Arts, the British Association, and various professional bodies. He died in an accident at his home, 13 New Parade, Worthing, on 22 October 1936. In 1987 the University of Strathclyde honoured his memory by naming a new student hall of residence after him.<br>
