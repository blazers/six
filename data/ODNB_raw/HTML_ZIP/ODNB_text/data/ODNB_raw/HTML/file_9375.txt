<span class="headword">Featherstonhaugh <span class="st"> [Fetherstonhaugh]</span>, Sir  Timothy</span>  (1601&#150;1651), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was the son of Henry Featherstonhaugh (<i>d</i>. 1626) of Kirkoswald, Cumberland, and his wife, Dorothy Wybergh, daughter of Thomas Wybergh of Clifton, Westmorland. His father was the high sheriff of Cumberland in 1613.<br>
<br>Featherstonhaugh matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, on 30 May 1617, and was admitted to Gray's Inn on 24 October 1620. In 1623 he married Bridget Patrickson, daughter of Thomas Patrickson of How, Cumberland. He was knighted at Whitehall on 1 April 1628, and was high sheriff of Cumberland in 1638&#150;9. His estates included lands at Kirkoswald, a coal mine at Broughton, and mills at Caldbeck and Ravenwick. Featherstonhaugh was appointed a commissioner of array in 1642, and despite initial difficulties he left Cumberland in 1643 with 3000 men to reinforce the royalist northern army under the earl of Newcastle. He requested that the earl of Ormond in Ireland dispatch royalist troops to relieve Cumberland from the Scots. He served in the defence of York and was among the royalist army defeated at Marston Moor on 2 July 1644. Afterwards he served with the Northern horse, possibly holding a cavalry command. He contributed provisions to the Carlisle garrison and was reported to be in the city on 8 October 1644, shortly before it was besieged. By February 1645 he was in Oxford, fruitlessly seeking reinforcements for his hard-pressed county; the king and Lord Digby sent him to Dublin to seek Ormond's assistance, where he met with no more success.<br>
<br>With the end of the first civil war Featherstonhaugh compounded for delinquency in arms on 26 February 1647, and took the negative oath and the national covenant. He was fined on 11 May 1647, but the money remained unpaid in September 1649. He was among the royalist and Scots army that invaded England in 1651, and on 26 August he was captured at the battle of Wigan Lane, Lancashire. On 11 September parliament ordered that he was fit &#145;to be brought to trial, and made example of justice&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1651</i>, 423). Despite his plea that he had quarter for life given him, he was tried by court martial. He wrote a farewell letter to his wife on 20 October and was beheaded in Chester two days later. Two of his sons had been slain seven weeks before in the battle of Worcester on 3 September&#151;the elder, Henry, having been knighted on the field. Another son, Philip, petitioned in 1665 that his father had lost &pound;10,000 in loyal service.<br>
<br>Featherstonhaugh's widow suffered much legal expense in her attempts to recover some of the estates, which remained under sequestration until at least 1658. His grandson Thomas erected a Latin monumental inscription to him in the chancel of Kirkoswald church.<br>
