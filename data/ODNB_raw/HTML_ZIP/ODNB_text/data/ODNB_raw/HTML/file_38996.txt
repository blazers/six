<div class="para">
<span class="headword">McKendrick,  John Gray</span>  (1841&#150;1926), <span class="occ">physiologist</span>, was born on 12 August 1841 in the Hardgate, Aberdeen, the only son of James MacKendrick, a silk merchant, of Braco, Perthshire, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith, of Laurencekirk. The key elements in his life were his fascination with natural processes, humanity, and the Christian faith. It is remarkable that a long struggle with poverty should have produced a man so driven by idealism. His mother contracted tuberculosis and could look after him for only his first three or four months. His father died aged twenty-nine after his business in Aberdeen failed; he entrusted his son to a Mrs Gray, a milliner, who became the guiding spirit of McKendrick's early years. For a while she looked after the boy in Aberdeen, but he liked the country, so she left him with his grandparents in Braco. The summer of 1854 was a formative one. Long days in the countryside employed as a &#145;herd laddie&#146; made a deep impression, and, as McKendrick later explained, &#145;My mind awoke about this time&#146;  (McKendrick, <span class="italic">Story of my Life</span>, 11). Meanwhile, Mrs Gray obtained an apprenticeship for him with a firm of advocates in Aberdeen. Through the kindness of friends he was introduced to the possibilities of education, and to his future wife, Mary Souttar. His interest in natural history, especially marine zoology, was encouraged by an anatomist, Peter Redfern, who arranged for McKendrick to exhibit an aquarium at the British Association meeting of 1859, attended by John Gould, Richard Owen, T. H. Huxley, and Roderick Murchison. Redfern suggested that McKendrick should study medicine, and in 1861, aged twenty, he passed the examinations to enter the medical faculty of Aberdeen University.<br>
<br>McKendrick's first year went well, bringing him the comparative anatomy prize, and honours in chemistry, but then disaster struck. His employer asked him to return for work one Saturday afternoon, but he stayed too long at a concert to hear Jenny Lind sing, and was dismissed for being almost thirty minutes late. He found work in Edinburgh in a newspaper office, learnt anatomy from John Goodsir, whom he regarded as the father of British physiology, and won Goodsir's gold medal. But he suffered another frightening setback when he coughed blood. W. T. Gairdner, later a pioneer in public health, diagnosed tuberculosis and advised rest in the country. McKendrick soon recovered, and with further training in Aberdeen and Edinburgh graduated MD, ChB in 1864. After posts in Chester and Whitechapel, London, he got a well-paid position as house surgeon in Belford Hospital, Fort William, and on 21 August 1867 was able to marry Mary Souttar (1842&#150;1896), daughter of William Souttar, a railway clerk, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mearns. They had two daughters and three sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52663/', "Anderson Gray McKendrick (1876&#150;1943)")</script>, medical statistician.<br>
<br>In 1869 McKendrick by chance met Hughes Bennett, professor of physiology in Edinburgh University, who offered him an assistantship. Acceptance reduced his salary, but opened the door to science as a profession. Bennett's frail health gave McKendrick the opportunity to stand in for the professor during the winter sessions, lecturing also to some formidable women pioneers, such as Sophia Jex-Blake. McKendrick also began research. From observing the effects of removing portions of the brains of pigeons he concluded that the deeper parts of the corpora striata are concerned with movement. He was intrigued to know what part of the brain gave these birds their individual characters; for this reason, years later, he set up a lectureship in experimental psychology in Glasgow University. His most significant research was with the physical chemist James Dewar. They discovered that light falling on the retina elicited an electric signal in the retina and optic nerve; the same effect was demonstrated in many species. Light shining on one retina affected optic lobes on both sides of the head. Unhappily, unknown to them, Holmgren of Uppsala had already published similar findings. McKendrick and Dewar also collaborated in pharmacological experiments; their work on chinoline and piridine bases laid the foundations for antipyrine therapy. These experiments made McKendrick's reputation. He later made observations on many subjects&#151;measurements of the cochlea, improvements to apparatus, anaesthetics, respiration&#151;but none had the impact of these earlier studies in Edinburgh. In 1873 Bennett resigned, but William Rutherford, not McKendrick, was elected to succeed him. Initially this was another setback&#151;Lister called round to sympathize&#151;but McKendrick quickly recovered financially by extramural teaching, and in 1876 became professor of physiology in Glasgow University.<br>
<br>McKendrick's predecessor, Andrew Buchanan, who discovered fibrinogen, left a department seriously behind the times. McKendrick bought equipment from the continent, initially at his own expense. By the time of his retirement he had raised about &pound;20,000 for the department and provided his successor with spacious accommodation. He wrote textbooks for medical students, first a single volume, then two volumes, and a biography of Hermann von Helmholtz (1899). Although McKendrick was a founder member of the Physiological Society, his research activities focused on the Royal Institution, where Dewar was now director. As Fullerian professor there (a post held conjointly with his regius chair), he gave public lectures, including Christmas lectures to children. The text of the 1892 series survives, confirming his reputation as one of the best popular lecturers of his time. In addition, he was in demand to lecture on the relation between science and religion (he was a strong Congregationalist). The Combe lectures drew audiences of a thousand. McKendrick later expressed remorse that he had allowed all this intense activity to direct his attention away from original research. However, in his favourite topic, acoustics, experimental methods were still too primitive for real progress.<br>
<br>In 1906 McKendrick retired to Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, and was elected provost in 1910. He was elected FRSE and FRCP Edin. (1871) and FRS (1884), and received an honorary LLD from Aberdeen (1882), and Glasgow (1907). He died at his home, 10 Rosslyn Terrace, Glasgow, on 2 January 1926, and was buried at the chapel of St Mary's between Muchalls and Stonehaven.<br>
