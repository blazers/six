<span class="headword">Gonner, Sir  Edward Carter Kersey</span>  (1862&#150;1922), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born on 5 March 1862 at 35 Conduit Street, Mayfair, London, the second son of Peter Kersey Gonner, silk mercer, and his wife, Elizabeth Carter. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London, before entering Lincoln College, Oxford, in 1880 to study history, in which he gained a first in 1884. After leaving Oxford he worked briefly for the London Extension Society. In the autumn of 1885 he moved to an appointment as lecturer in political economy, modern history, and English literature at University College, Bristol, the combination of subjects reflecting the demands of the University of London BA degree, for which Bristol prepared its students. In 1888 he moved from Bristol to University College, Liverpool, which was at that time a part of the federal Victoria University of Manchester together with Owens College, Manchester, and Yorkshire College, Leeds. In 1890 Gonner married Annie Ledlie; they had one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1891 Gonner was appointed to the newly endowed Brunner chair of economic science at Liverpool, a post which he held until his death. He thus became part of a generation of Oxford history graduates who played a significant part in the development of the teaching of economics at Oxford and elsewhere; William Ashley, for example, was a close contemporary. The Liverpool appointment enabled Gonner to develop his interests in both history and political economy, and was to prove the formative influence on his development as a teacher and economist. At the end of the nineteenth century Liverpool was at the peak of its commercial significance, being Britain's principal Atlantic port and the second city of England as regards population and wealth. The college did not want for benefactors, and Gonner's initial appointment was endowed by members of the shipping and insurance community. Much of his early teaching was directed towards clerks seeking employment in this sector, and his courses were geared towards the Victoria University final examination or the local college business curriculum. His teaching was reflected in his published work during this period: an elementary textbook on the economics of commerce entitled <span class="italic">The University Economics</span> (1888), <span class="italic">Commercial Geography</span> (1894), and two works on socialism, <span class="italic">The Socialist State</span> (1895) and <span class="italic">The Social Philosophy of Rodbertus</span> (1899). By the end of the 1890s the college business curriculum had developed into a school of commerce, a joint venture between the city and the university college, which formed the basis on which the newly independent university initiated its bachelor of commercial science degree in 1909.<br>
<br>In 1894 Gonner was responsible for a report to the British Association for the Advancement of Science on the teaching of economics in Britain and abroad, contributing an appendix on Britain which drew attention to a lack of systematic training in the subject, and a survey of provision for such training in continental Europe. At this time, he noted, the Cambridge and the Liverpool chairs were the sole full-time professorial appointments in economics, and Alfred Flux in Manchester was the only fully occupied lecturer. Popular teaching in political economy was generally more successful, Gonner observed, but in Britain the development of university teaching in the subject was hindered by a failure on the part of relevant professions, such as banking and the civil service, to require of its recruits more than a passing acquaintance with the subject.<br>
<br>Gonner was twice elected president of section F (economics and statistics) of the British Association, and chaired meetings in Toronto (1898) and Australia (1914). The continuing breadth of his interests is demonstrated by the fact that, during the period 1906&#150;9 he was a member of the royal commission on shipping conferences, and in 1912 he published his important study of the development of the English farming landscape, <span class="italic">Common Land and Inclosure</span>. Ostensibly a history of the appropriation of common land for individual use, charting the impact of this transition upon cultivation and employment, it had an explicitly analytical framework which owed much to Gonner's work in geography and economics. Likewise his interest in and advocacy of the writings of David Ricardo, of which he published editions in 1895 and 1923, sets him apart from those of his contemporaries who were shaping an approach to economic history broadly hostile to the analytical style of the new economics. As a &#145;historical economist&#146; there was a great deal more of the economist than the historian in Gonner's approach. This is also evident in his work during the First World War in the Ministry of Food where he worked first as an economic adviser, then as director of statistics. His administrative skills were also put to use as an industrial arbitrator for the Ministry of Labour. Gonner was appointed CBE in 1918 and KBE in 1921 for his wartime service. At his death he was working as a member of the editorial board established by the Carnegie endowment to produce a social and economic history of wartime administration. He died of bronchial pneumonia on 24 February 1922 at 42 Heathfield Road, Wavertree, Liverpool; his funeral took place at Willaston church, near Chester, on 27 February. His wife survived him.<br>
