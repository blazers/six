<span class="headword">Bancroft,  George</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1573?), <span class="occ">religious writer and Church of England clergyman</span>, is first recorded in 1544, when he was presented by Giles Gore, esquire, to the Wiltshire rectory of Grittleton. On 14 October 1547, still incumbent of Grittleton and now also chaplain to William Parr, marquess of Northampton, he was dispensed to hold another benefice. In that same year he was presented to Nettleton by John Butler of Great Badminton. In 1548 he published, as a translation from the Latin, <span class="italic">The answere that the preachers of the gospel at Basile made for the defence of the true administration and use of the holy supper of Our Lord. Agaynst the abhomination of the popyshe masse</span>. It is dedicated to &#145;his singular good Master Silvester Butler&#146;, who, appearances notwithstanding, was his patron's wife, elsewhere impartially recorded as Silvester and Silvestra.<br>
<br>Bancroft's translation of his unidentified original constitutes a modest contribution to Reformation debate. His preface and the main text alike follow a strongly reformist line. Both mount a fierce attack on the Catholic mass as idolatrous and detestable and on the priests who administer it, denounced by Bancroft for their avarice&#151;&#145;whan they here of any riche manes death they flocke together lyke ravennes to a dead carren&#146;  (sig. Aiii<i>v</i>); in the translation they are castigated for pride as well. In the latter English readers are instructed that the Lord's supper is an act of commemoration, rather than a renewal of Christ's sacrifice, that Catholic priests err when they &#145;denye that we are Justified by fayth only ascribinge part of our justificacion to good workes&#146;  (sig. Eiii), and that indeed &#145;there be no priestes nowe appointed of God to offer for synnes, but every christian man is ordeined of Christe to be a prieste&#146;  (sig. Fiiii<i>v</i>). Such teaching was fully in accord with protestant doctrine as laid down by leading Swiss reformers, and now increasingly propagated in England.<br>
<br>The theological content of <span class="italic">The answere</span> seems likely to have appealed to Bancroft's patrons. Northampton was an evangelical, and so was Andrew Baynton, who in 1554 presented Bancroft to the living of Bromham. Bancroft was deprived of Grittleton and Nettleton in the same year, but presumably thanks to Baynton's protection he retained Bromham, and apparently also Yatton Keynell, where the advowson was shared by his former patron Giles Gore throughout Mary's reign. It must have helped him that Baynton does not seem to have flaunted his protestantism, whereas in 1557 Mrs Butler was pardoned her involvement in a conspiracy in the course of which she was said to have exclaimed, &#145;I wold the Kyng and Quene were in the sea in a botomles vessell&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1555&#150;7</i>, 400&#150;01). Bancroft resigned Yatton Keynell in 1560 but was at some point reinstated in Grittleton, holding that living and Bromham until he died, probably in 1573, when successors were presented to both benefices following Bancroft's death.<br>
