<span class="headword">Lanner <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Geraldini]</span>,  Katharina Josefa <span class="st"> [Katti]</span></span>  (1829&#150;1908), <span class="occ">dancer and choreographer</span>, was born in the parish of Laimgrube, Vienna, Austria, on 14 September 1829, one of the two daughters of Josef Lanner (1801&#150;1843), a violinist and waltz composer, and his wife, Franciska, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jahns. Her brother August (1834&#150;1855) was a violinist and orchestra leader. She trained at the ballet school of the Vienna Court Opera, and made her d&eacute;but in <span class="italic">Angelica</span> at the city's K&auml;rntnertortheater on 4 August 1845. For ten years she danced with the Vienna Court Opera Ballet, where her parts included Fenella in <span class="italic">Die Stumme von Portici</span> (1847), and the title roles in <span class="italic">Elina</span> (1847) and <span class="italic">Giselle</span> (1856). She also danced in Berlin, Munich, and Dresden.<br>
<br>In 1862 Katti Lanner took the position of ballerina and ballet mistress at the State Theatre, Hamburg, where she choreographed ten successful ballets, including <span class="italic">Uriella, der D&auml;mon der Nacht</span> (1862) and <span class="italic">Sitala, das Gaukler-M&auml;dchen</span> (1863). On 11 February 1864, in Hamburg, she married the composer Johann Alfred Geraldini; they had three daughters&#151;Sofia, Katharina, and Albertina. In the late 1860s she toured Scandinavia and Russia, and by 1869 she was leading her own company, the Viennese Ballet Company, which performed in Bordeaux (1869), New York (1870), and Lisbon (1870&#150;71). She appeared in London at Drury Lane in 1871, and made her Paris d&eacute;but at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Italien in May 1872. In 1873 she travelled again to America, with the Kathi Lanner Coreographic Combination [<i>sic</i>], and toured for the next two years. She made several appearances at Niblo's Garden, New York, in <span class="italic">Azrael</span> (1873) and <span class="italic">Tom and Jerry</span> (1875).<br>
<br>Lanner returned to London in 1875, and made her family's home at 40 North Side, Clapham Common. The following year she was invited to take charge of the National Training School of Dancing, which had been set up by the opera impresario James Mapleson, at 73 Tottenham Court Road. She later became sole owner of the school, with the object of &#145;the resuscitation of the faded glories of ballet, and to bring a thorough knowledge of the choreography art within the range of those classes among whom talent most abounds&#146;. She was an affectionate but stern disciplinarian. From 1877 to 1881 she was ballet mistress at Her Majesty's Theatre, London, where she staged ballets for the Italian Opera Company, including <span class="italic">Les papillons</span> (1878). Lanner continued to dance herself, one of her last appearances being as Elena in <span class="italic">Robert le diable</span> at Her Majesty's on 16 July 1878. She also choreographed the ballets in Augustus Harris's pantomimes at Drury Lane and for pantomimes at the Crystal Palace. In 1887 she became ballet mistress (choreographer) at the Empire Theatre, which was then a variety theatre, and over the next twenty years she put on more than thirty ballets, some modern, some preserving classical traditions, with Adeline Gen&eacute;e as her principal ballerina. The music for most of these ballets was written by Herv&eacute; and Leopold Wenzl, successive musical directors at the Empire, among them being <span class="italic">The Sports of England</span> (1887), <span class="italic">Cleopatra</span> (1889), <span class="italic">Orf&eacute;o</span> (1891), <span class="italic">The Girls I Left Behind Me</span> (1893), <span class="italic">Faust</span> (1895, to music by Meyer Lutz), a new version of <span class="italic">Les papillons</span> (1901), and <span class="italic">The Milliner Duchess</span> (1903). Lanner was succeeded by Fred Farren, but was called out of retirement in 1906 to put on <span class="italic">The Debutante</span>, and the following year she choreographed <span class="italic">Sir Roger de Coverley</span> to music by F. O. Carr.<br>
<br>Lanner was an honorary member of the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing and of the Society of German Dance Teachers, and was one of the first women to choreograph regularly. Her training of young dancers was perhaps her most important contribution to the profession in Britain, though she was later rather eclipsed by the arrival of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. She died at her home at Clapham Common on 15 November 1908, and was buried at Norwood cemetery.<br>
