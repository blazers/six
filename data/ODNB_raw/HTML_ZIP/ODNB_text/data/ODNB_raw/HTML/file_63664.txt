<span class="headword">Wesley,  Sarah</span>  (1759&#150;1828), <span class="occ">Methodist writer</span>, was born on 1 April 1759 in Charles Street, Bristol, and baptized on 28 April in St James's Church, Bristol, the fourth child and only surviving daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29067/', "Charles Wesley (1707&#150;1788)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63663/', "Sarah Wesley, n&#233;e Gwynne (1726&#150;1822)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29067/', "Wesley, Charles")</script>]. She was partly brought up by a beloved Methodist nurse and for a time attended a school in Bristol, but was also taught Latin by her father. She was a silent child with the shyness and love of solitude and books which characterized her throughout life. She was under 5 feet tall, and when young was very handsome until, like her mother, she was disfigured by smallpox. According to her musician brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29068/', "Charles Wesley (1757&#150;1834)")</script> she had a good ear for music, sang well, and would have been a good instrumentalist but preferred reading to the rigours of practice. She wrote poetry from an early age but was reluctant to show her verses to her critical father.<br>
<br>In contrast to the rest of her family Sarah Wesley did not hold tory principles; nor did she regard Charles I as a martyr, which made her father say that &#145;the rebel blood of some of her ancestors flows in her veins&#146;  (Stevenson, <span class="italic">Memorials</span>, 475). Though she had an aversion to politics she rejoiced at the destruction of the Bastille while abhorring the treatment of the French royal family during the revolution. She was a favourite of her uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29069/', "John Wesley")</script>, but her chief confidante was her aunt Martha Hall, who introduced her to Samuel Johnson. She was not afraid of him, and her brother said &#145;She used to show him her verses and he would pat her head and say to my aunt &#147;Madam, she will do&#148;&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Sarah's father was dedicated to her well-being and offered to share his knowledge of books and poetry. He thought she had a thirst and capacity for knowledge, but that she would be hindered by her lack of resolution to rise early and study regularly. Above all he was concerned for her religious development but, though he urged her to be grateful to the Methodists, he would not force her into Methodist meetings in case aversion to their company prejudiced her against religion. He thought she would not relish the writings of Thomas &agrave; Kempis and William Law, but did allow her to read one of his own favourite works, Edward Young's <span class="italic">Night Thoughts</span>.<br>
<br>Sarah was evidently not immune from fashion. Charles once suspected she had had a fall through wearing fashionable shoes, and her evangelical friend Hannah More once remarked that she found her &#145;more wit than Methodist&#146;  (Pollock, 155). Like her mother she was often used by donors to distribute charity. She was a member of City Road Chapel and there attended a ladies' working circle which sewed clothes for the poor while discoursing on religious and moral issues. Her circle of friends and correspondents included minor literary figures such as Elizabeth Benger, novelist and biographer, the Methodist artist John Russell (who painted her portrait), and the educationist Elizabeth Hamilton, who thought highly of Sarah's ability and believed that, had she made the effort, she could have earned a living by writing. Certainly Sarah appears to have translated material for George Gregory to use in his periodical articles. However, it seems likely that her retiring nature and modesty inhibited her from pursuing a literary career, though she wrote a good deal of poetry, mostly unpublished. Her principal legacy and chief significance for Methodism was indirect, acting as a repository and transmitter of the Wesley family traditions, partly from her mother. Adam Clarke's <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Wesley Family</span> (1823) owed much to her manuscripts and recollections. She was particularly anxious to counter unfavourable judgements on the Wesley brothers' actions and characters.<br>
<br>Sarah Wesley never married, though she appears to have received at least two proposals. She spent much of her time in the company of her gentle and rather unworldly brother Charles, and was much troubled by the irregular life of her brother the composer and organist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29072/', "Samuel Wesley")</script>. Though living in London for much of her life (from 1771 at 1 Chesterfield Street, Marylebone), her affections centred on Bristol. During a last visit there she fell ill and died of a throat disorder on 19 September 1828. She was buried in the churchyard of St James's, the church of her baptism.<br>
