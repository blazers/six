<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Scrope,  Richard</span>, first Baron Scrope of Bolton  (<em>c.</em>1327&#150;1403), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24957/', "Sir Henry Scrope (b. in or before 1268, d. 1336)")</script>, a lawyer who acquired a considerable estate in north Yorkshire, and his wife, Margaret, who was probably the daughter of either Lord Ros or Lord Fitzwalter. Active as a soldier at an early age, in 1346 he fought successively at Cr&eacute;cy (26 August) and Nevilles Cross (17 October), being knighted after the latter battle; he then took part in Edward III's siege of Calais, concluded on 3 August 1347. On 29 August 1350 he fought in the sea battle off Winchelsea, and late in 1355 he campaigned in France, before returning to England with the king for the relief of Berwick Castle in January 1356. Up to this point he had served under a number of captains, under Henry, Lord Percy, at Nevilles Cross, under either the earl of Warwick or the earl of Northampton at Winchelsea. But he now became increasingly closely connected with the young John of Gaunt, a connection certainly strengthened by the latter's being earl of Richmond. It was in Gaunt's retinue that with five other members of the Scrope family Richard took part in Edward III's French campaign of 1359&#150;60, and he served abroad under Gaunt, in France, Spain, and Scotland, on a further five occasions, in 1367, 1369, 1373&#150;4, 1384, and 1385. On 8 November 1367 he was formally retained by Gaunt, with an annuity of &pound;40 per annum. He also enjoyed the favour of the king, and at his death was able to bequeath to his son Stephen a sword which had belonged to Edward III.<br>
<br>During the 1360s Scrope was active in domestic affairs, locally and nationally, being appointed to nine commissions of oyer and terminer and of the peace, almost exclusively in the North Riding of Yorkshire, which he also represented in parliament in 1365. Military service had probably helped to make him wealthy&#151;in the 1360s he was active in buying lands, especially in Wensleydale and Swaledale&#151;and it is not surprising that on 8 January 1371 he should have received a personal summons to parliament, thereby becoming Baron Scrope of Bolton. Further promotion followed, doubtless owing much to Gaunt's influence, when on 27 March 1371 Scrope was appointed treasurer of England. The demands of the French war had created acute financial difficulties. Scrope's treasurership saw serious attempts at retrenchment, as well as the appointment of a special treasurer at war. For a while order was restored, but it is unlikely that Scrope had any specialized financial skills, and the private dealings with London financiers of William, Lord Latimer, and Richard Lyons, apparently undertaken without the treasurer's knowledge to raise loans for the king, at considerable expense to the latter, led to renewed fiscal confusion, and in 1376 did much to discredit the whole government. But by then Scrope was no longer in office, having resigned on 26 September 1375.<br>
<br>Scrope showed both integrity and independence during the Good Parliament of 1376. Questioned about the loans made to the king, he refused at first to answer unless he was released from his councillor's vow of secrecy, but once he had been licensed to speak, he gave evidence damning to Latimer and Lyons. His conduct earned him widespread respect, yet did nothing to lose him the favour of John of Gaunt, and following the death of Edward III he was appointed steward of the household to the young Richard II. On 29 October 1378 he resigned this office to become chancellor of England. In spite of considerable difficulties, Scrope showed great skill in office, especially as a spokesman for the government in parliament, delivering a series of speeches to the Commons which have been described as &#145;models of their kind. They combined firmness with flexibility, and frankness with the occasional but necessary half-truth&#146;  (Saul, 50). But continuous failures in the war with France eventually led to the government's collapse, and Scrope resigned on 30 January 1380. At the end of the year he was appointed a warden of the west march, an office he held at first jointly, but later alone, until 14 March 1382, and in which he directed important works on the gatehouse of Carlisle Castle, supplying lead from his own Wensleydale mines.<br>
<br>Scrope did not remain away from the centre of affairs for long. Following the disasters of the peasants' revolt, on 4 December 1381 he was reappointed chancellor, according to Walsingham, &#145;at the petition of all the magnates and commons&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historia Anglicana</span>, 2.49). But he soon found that popular approval was no substitute for royal favour. His efforts to control Richard II's extravagance were resented, and when he refused to seal charters giving control of the Mortimer inheritance to royal favourites, the king dismissed him, on 11 July 1382. According to Walsingham, Scrope told Richard he would never hold office under him again. This did not prevent Scrope's serving as a warden of the west march from February to July 1384, and in fact he became involved in government on several further occasions, though hardly in the king's interest. In 1385 he was a member of a committee of nine appointed to investigate royal revenues and expenditure, and in November 1386 he was named to the continual committee set up by the Wonderful Parliament to oversee and direct the workings of government in the following year. It is true that in that parliament Scrope spoke in defence of the chancellor, Michael de la Pole, but this was probably on strictly personal grounds&#151;de la Pole was his brother-in-law. In November 1387 Scrope acted as a spokesman for the lords appellant in their dealings with the king, and at the end of the Merciless Parliament he was one of a committee appointed to watch over the king's actions. Following the Cambridge parliament of September 1388 he became one of a small group of councillors who shared responsibility for government until the king's resumption of power in May 1389.<br>
<br>Scrope may not have been as totally disaffected from the king as his actions in the late 1380s might suggest; certainly his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24966/', "William Scrope")</script>, would become one of Richard II's principal supporters, executed as such in 1399. But though he was summoned to a council in London in April 1390 to discuss a proposed embassy to France, Scrope was usually only tangentially involved in government after 1389, for instance being employed in negotiations with the Scots in 1393 and 1394, and acting regularly as a trier of petitions in parliament until 1397. He was, however, active in promoting the welfare of his own soul, being licensed in 1393 to found a chantry of six chaplains in Bolton Castle, and to endow Easby Abbey with the means to maintain first six and ultimately ten additional canons, along with two secular chaplains and twenty-two poor men. Piety was accompanied, for Scrope, by an evident concern for his standing in the eyes of society, lastingly demonstrated by his great castle at Bolton in Wensleydale. Designed by the Durham architect John Lewyn, under an indenture of 14 September 1378, it comprised eight major residential suites, and is said to have cost about &pound;12,000 over twenty years&#151;evidence, it may be, for the profits of government office as well as of war, since Scrope's landed income, even after he had added substantially to his estates, was only about &pound;600 per annum.<br>
<br>Equally compelling evidence for Scrope's concern for his rights and status is provided by the famous lawsuit which he initiated in 1385 against the Cheshire knight Sir Robert Grosvenor, over the right to the arms azure a bend or. Referred to the court of chivalry, the action lasted for five years, and heard depositions from 397 witnesses, 246 of whom appeared for Scrope. Drawn predominantly, though not exclusively, from the north of England, the latter included the dukes of Lancaster and York, the earls of Arundel, Derby, Devon, and Northumberland, lords Basset, Clifford, Dacre, and Neville, the heads of many northern monasteries, and large numbers of knights and esquires, including the poet Geoffrey Chaucer. Their testimony provided abundant evidence for the respect which Scrope enjoyed in landowning society, as well as vindicating his claim to the disputed coat of arms. The fact that he was appointed to be one of their executors by the second earl of Arundel, William Ufford, earl of Suffolk, and Archbishop Thoresby of York, and was an attorney for the duke of Gloucester in 1395, similarly shows that he was widely trusted among the aristocracy. In 1399, however, the overthrow of Richard II, and particularly the execution of Scrope's eldest son, seemed to threaten the future of his whole family. Lord Scrope gave his support in parliament to Richard's deposition, and then made an emotional appeal, &#145;with great humility and bitter weeping&#146;, that the judgment on his son should not be used to justify his own and his other children's disinheritance. Henry IV was merciful, reassuring Scrope that he &#145;regarded him as a loyal knight, and had always regarded him as such&#146;  (<span class="italic">RotP</span>, 3.453).<br>
<br>Scrope served as a councillor in 1401, and attended parliament in 1402, but his commitment to the new regime was never fully tested, since he died on 30 May 1403, and was buried in Easby Abbey. He seems to have spent his later years mostly at his manor of Pishiobury, Hertfordshire, which he bought in 1394, and where he drew up his will on 2 August 1400. As well as showing that Scrope died a very wealthy man, the will also sheds a good deal of light on his personality and preoccupations. The latter centred upon his family. In 1344 or 1345 he had married Blanche, daughter of William de la Pole, who predeceased him, dying some time after 1378; with her he had four sons, William, Roger, Stephen, and Richard. Roger and Stephen he married to two of the three daughters and coheirs of Robert, third Lord Tybotot, having purchased their wardship and marriage. But he showed himself concerned to endow his descendants with a common memory as well as with worldly goods. Thus he bequeathed to Roger, his eldest surviving son, a rosary which had belonged to Scrope's own father, and the missal and breviary that he had himself used to say his morning and evening prayers, and left to him pieces of plate which had belonged to the earls of Arundel and Suffolk, along with instructions that these were to become heirlooms in memory of the earls. His family was the object of his affections as well as of his dynastic ambitions. He left a blessing along with an estate to Roger, as his &#145;dearest&#146; eldest son, and addressed his namesake, godson, and nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24964/', "Richard Scrope")</script>, archbishop of York, as &#145;my most dear father and son&#146;. But his benevolence extended beyond his immediate family circle, to members of his household, each of whom seems to have been remembered, including every servant in the kitchen of Bolton Castle.<br>
<br>Scrope showed his religious devotion in his bequests to a wide range of northern monasteries and friaries, as well as in a gift of &pound;40 to the work then in progress on York Minster. The same motive doubtless lay behind the concern he expressed for the poor of Richmondshire, for instance his bequest of &pound;20 to be distributed among his poor tenants there. The residue of his estate was to go to the hospice for the poor and its associated college which he had founded at Wensley. This last project came to nothing, but his lands and title descended in his posterity until 1630.<br>
