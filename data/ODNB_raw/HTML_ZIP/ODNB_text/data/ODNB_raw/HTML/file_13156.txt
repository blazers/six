<span class="headword">Hewley <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wolrych]</span>,  Sarah</span>, Lady Hewley  (1627&#150;1710), <span class="occ">benefactor</span>, was the only daughter and heir of Robert Wolrych (<i>d</i>. 1661), attorney of Ipswich, Suffolk, and Gray's Inn, Middlesex. Her mother's maiden name was Mott. Her husband, Sir John Hewley (<i>d</i>. 1697), whom she married some time during the 1650s, was admitted into Gray's Inn on 4 February 1638; however he suspended his legal career during the 1640s to play an active role in parliament's struggles against the king. He was the only son of a minor Yorkshire West Riding gentleman, and the couple resided in Yorkshire after their marriage, alternating between their town house in York and Bell Hall, their country residence in nearby Naburn purchased in 1663. Their two children, Wolrych and John, both died in infancy, and the bulk of the Hewleys' considerable estate was subsequently given over to charity or divided among their extended kin&#151;including Hewley Baines, Thomas Wolrych, and Mercy Mott&#151;by Sarah.<br>
<br>The Hewley marriage was characterized by religious and professional compatibility and a strong sense of public duty. Both Sarah and John held strong puritan convictions before and after the Restoration; John was a legal associate&#151;and probably a prot&eacute;g&eacute;&#151;of Sarah's father. The union facilitated their prominent role in public affairs from the 1650s onwards. John came to public prominence in York when he was employed by the corporation to administrate their purchase of the dean and chapter jurisdiction in 1656. However, he had been actively involved in county government since 1646, held the recorderships of Pontefract and Doncaster in the later 1650s, and represented Pontefract in the 1659 parliament. At the Restoration he was excluded from public office, though he maintained his nonconformist networks. However in the 1670s he once again contested Yorkshire parliamentary seats, culminating in his representation of York at the three Exclusion Parliaments on an exclusionary and reformatory ticket. True to form, he supported bills for the prevention of swearing, drunkenness, and sabbath-breaking, and security against popery.<br>
<br>Of course, as a woman Sarah Hewley was unable to hold public office; however, along with other prominent York women, she was no less influential than her politically active husband. She was the first and most powerful patron of nonconformist meetings in York after the Restoration, protecting and befriending preachers and providing a meeting-place for nonconformists from across the county. She was the hub of a network of friends and associates&#151;or her &#145;sosiety&#146;, as she described it&#151;who were drawn from the religious and legal circles within which she and her husband moved  (Raine, 11). These meetings and networks had direct political significance, as evidenced during the exclusion crisis (1679&#150;81) when Yorkshire nonconformists assembled to pray in the houses of dissenting York matriarchs before voting for the &#145;whig&#146; platform at the shire elections in York Castle.<br>
<br>However, Sarah Hewley is best remembered for her charitable activities, which provided the main outlet for her reformatory and godly inclinations after the death of her husband. Although these inclinations were firmly grounded in the presbyterianism typified by Edward Bowles and Richard Baxter, the Hewleys also maintained connections with the circle of Samuel Hartlib and literary networks which included John Rushworth, Matthew Poole, Sir William Dugdale, and Andrew Marvell. The Hewley Trust, which was specifically designed as a northern charity of national significance, was founded by the deeds of 13 January 1705 and 26 April 1707: it institutionalized the support of &#145;poor and godly Preachers&#146; and their &#145;poor and godly widows&#146;; the education of &#145;young men designed for the ministry&#146;; and the propagation of the gospel in &#145;poor places&#146;; and provided a York hospital for &#145;widows or unmarried women&#146; fifty-five years old or over. It was financed in large part by properties purchased from royalists by Sarah's father during the 1650s, marking it as a final legacy of the family's puritan activism of the mid-seventeenth century  (North Yorkshire County RO, ZTP 1, 16&#150;18).<br>
<br>Although a board of male presbyterian trustees was appointed in 1705, it is clear Sarah maintained a powerful discretionary influence over the charity's activities until at least a year before her death. However, she was also willing to entrust other institutions with the administration of reformation and &#145;improvement&#146;. She was the largest anonymous contributor to the meeting-house in St Saviourgate, York, and in her will she provided a fund of &pound;500 to the York corporation for the annual &#145;laying in coals&#146; for &#145;poor housekeepers [and] necessitous persons&#146; and &pound;200 for the maintenance and construction of schools for boys and &#145;poore girles&#146; respectively. She died at her house at St Saviour's, York, on 23 September 1710, after a long illness, &#145;leaving my vile Body to be disposed by my Executors with as little cost and ceremony as may be&#146;  (will of Sarah Hewley, Sept 1710). She was buried in St Saviourgate Chapel, York. The charity was the subject of considerable dispute and parliamentary concern in the 1840s (see G. I. T. Machin, <span class="italic">Politics and the Churches in Great Britain, 1832 to 1868</span>, 1977).<br>
