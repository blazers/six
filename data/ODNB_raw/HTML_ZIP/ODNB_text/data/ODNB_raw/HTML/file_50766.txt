<span class="headword">Abercrombie,  David</span>  (1909&#150;1992), <span class="occ">phonetician</span>, was born in Birkenhead on 19 December 1909, the eldest of the three sons and a daughter of the poet and critic <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30321/', "Lascelles Abercrombie (1881&#150;1938)")</script> and Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gwatkin (1881&#150;1968). One of his brothers was the biologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30742/', "Michael Abercrombie (1912&#150;1979)")</script>. His early years were spent in Ryton, Gloucestershire, in a comfortable home often visited by two family friends of his parents, Robert Frost and Rupert Brooke.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the First World War the family returned to Merseyside, where Abercrombie was educated at Liverpool College. From 1922 to 1929 his father occupied the chair of English literature at Leeds University, and Abercrombie became a student at Leeds in his father's department. It was here that Eric Gordon lectured on Old Norse, and Abercrombie was thanked in print by him for his &#145;illuminating comments on the description of Old Norse sounds&#146;  (E. V. Gordon, <span class="italic">An Introduction to Old Norse</span>, 1927); Abercrombie was just seventeen. He graduated BA in English in 1930 with third-class honours. Immediately he began an MA at Leeds on the phonetic basis of i-mutation. It was never completed, but it carried forward his undergraduate interest in the pronunciation of Old Norse, and foreshadowed a later one, namely prosodic phonology.<br>
<br>Through his father, who was a member of the BBC's advisory committee on spoken English, Abercrombie met Daniel Jones, professor of phonetics at University College, London. An unexpected consequence was that he was able to spend two years, from 1931 to 1933, as a teaching <i>assistant</i> at the Lyc&eacute;e Louis-le-Grand in Paris, at the same time as learning French, attending classes in phonetics at the Institut de Phon&eacute;tique at the Sorbonne (the University of Paris), and sitting the examination of the International Phonetic Association. From 1933 to 1937 he was back in England as an assistant lecturer in English to non-native speakers of English, and also contributing to the teaching of French, at the London School of Economics (LSE).<br>
<br>From 1938 to 1940 Abercrombie worked for the British Council in Athens as director of studies at the Institute of English Studies. From 1940 to 1945 he lectured on English at Cairo University, also acting as an assistant censor in control headquarters of Anglo-Egyptian censorship. His compatriots in Cairo included the novelists Lawrence Durrell and Olivia Manning, and the cookery writer Elizabeth David. In 1944 he married Mary Henderson <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marble (<i>d</i>. 1998), of Illinois and California, the mother of Mortimer Henderson and Mary Brown (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Henderson).<br>
<br>After the Second World War, Abercrombie returned to the LSE for two years until his appointment to a lectureship in phonetics at the University of Leeds (1947&#150;8). In the following year he moved to Edinburgh University, where he established not only a department of phonetics with a distinctively different approach to the subject, but also his own reputation as one of the twentieth century's leading phoneticians. Up until then phonetics had often been regarded as a practical, ancillary discipline in the study of modern languages, which had as its aim the teaching of a native-like reproduction of the sounds of a language. Abercrombie, drawing on his knowledge of the work of particular phoneticians from the seventeenth century onwards, held that the role of phonetics in an undergraduate curriculum was to determine and exemplify a general theory of speech production, with its properties and possibilities. Speech as a worldwide phenomenon, not the speech of a particular language or group of languages, should be the salient characteristic of phonetics at the undergraduate level. With the help of a small group of colleagues, including J. C. (Ian) Catford, he made this a guiding principle in his development of courses at Edinburgh. He is rightly credited with establishing phonetics as an autonomous discipline in the British university system. He was promoted to senior lecturer in 1951, to reader in 1957, and to a personal professorship in 1964; the established chair was created for him in 1967. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1991. Abercrombie's published work ranges over not only questions of general phonetics, but also aspects of the history of phonetics, of writing systems (particularly shorthand), and the contributions of phonetics to the teaching of English as a foreign language.<br>
<br>Lascelles Abercrombie inspired in his son a love of poetry but also a curiosity about the mechanics of poetry, particularly rhythm&#151;see Lascelles Abercrombie's <span class="italic">Principles of English Prosody</span> (1923). This led David to investigate the relationships between rhythm in poetry and the far more complex forms of rhythm in speech. Again thanks to his father he came to know Robert Bridges, for whom he devised a reformed system of English spelling used in the publication of Bridges' collected essays. He also devised the phonetic script used by C. K. Ogden in his <span class="italic">General Basic Dictionary</span> (1942).<br>
<br>Abercrombie was an inspired and inspiring teacher. He was as lucid in speaking about phonetics as in writing about it. He asked high standards of his students, but in return the hospitality and sociability that he and his wife, Mary, extended to them, as well as to colleagues and visitors, was legendary. At heart he was a wise and gentle person. Abercrombie died on 4 July 1992 in Edinburgh. Mary died in London on 28 April 1998.<br>
