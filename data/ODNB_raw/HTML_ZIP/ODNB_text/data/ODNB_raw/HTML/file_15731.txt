<span class="headword">Knight,  Joseph Philip</span>  (1812&#150;1887), <span class="occ">songwriter</span>, was born in Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, on 26 July 1812, the youngest son of Francis Knight DD, vicar of Bradford-on-Avon. At the age of sixteen he studied harmony and thoroughbass with John Davis Corfe, organist of Bristol Cathedral, and began composing. He subsequently published in 1832 a set of six songs under the pseudonym Philip Mortimer. Among these were &#145;Old Times&#146;, later sung by Henry Phillips, and &#145;Go, Forget Me&#146;, which became popular both in England and in Germany. Under his own name, and in collaboration with Haynes Bayly, Knight went on to write numerous songs, the most notable of which were &#145;The Veteran&#146; and &#145;She Wore a Wreath of Roses&#146;. After these came, among others, a solo song, &#145;The Parting&#146;, and a duet, &#145;Let's Take this World as some Wide Scene&#146;, both with words by Thomas Moore. In 1839 Knight visited the USA, where he composed his most famous song, &#145;Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep&#146;, which was for a long time associated with John Braham. On his return to England in 1841 he produced &#145;Beautiful Venice&#146;, &#145;Say, What shall my Song be To-night?&#146; and &#145;The Dream&#146;, with words by the Hon. Mrs Caroline Norton. Some years afterwards he was ordained by the bishop of Exeter, and was appointed to the charge of St Agnes in the Isles of Scilly, where he remained for some years. He then married and moved abroad, but finally returned to England, retired from the ministry, and resumed composition. Knight wrote in all about two hundred songs, duets, and trios, many of which enjoyed great popularity in their time. He was praised for his command of pure English melody. He was also an excellent organist, particularly skilled at improvisation. He died in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, on 2 June 1887.<br>
