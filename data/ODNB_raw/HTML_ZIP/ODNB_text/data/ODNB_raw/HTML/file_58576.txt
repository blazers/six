<span class="headword">Meyer <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Levis]</span>,  Adele</span>, Lady Meyer  (1862/3&#150;1930), <span class="occ">campaigner for social reform</span>, was the eldest daughter of Julius Levis of 35 Belsize Park Gardens, London. Her family was Jewish and her father was a merchant, but nothing is known about her early life. On 14 March 1883 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47715/', "Carl Ferdinand Meyer (1851&#150;1922)")</script>, a financier whose connection with the merchant banking house of Rothschilds brought them both into touch with the prominent financial and political personalities of the time. The couple had a son and a daughter. Her husband was created a baronet in 1910.<br>
<br>Adele Meyer played a prominent role in the social life of the <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i>; and it was later noted that she &#145;always recalled with pleasure the admiration her delicate colouring and prematurely grey hair and her quick intelligence provoked&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 21 Jan 1930). However, the life of a socialite was not sufficient for her, and she became associated with a number of campaigns to improve the position of women in society, the first of which was the St Pancras School for Mothers. In order to improve the physical state of the poor, she organized cooking lessons for women in their own homes. This development was so successful that it was adopted elsewhere in the United Kingdom and overseas. She acted as chair of this organization until 1928, when she was forced to resign through ill health.<br>
<br>Adele Meyer's concern for health and diet motivated her to establish, in 1910, the first rural health centre in Britain, which was based near Shortgrove, her country home at Newport, Essex. The centre included a school for mothers, a welfare club, a girls' club, and a dental clinic, and penny dinners were organized for schoolchildren. As with the St Pancras School for Mothers, this was a model that was followed in other parts of the country. It remained open until the outbreak of the First World War. In addition, Meyer was among the founders of Queen Mary's Hostel for Women, a branch of King's College, London, known for the study of social and domestic science. According to one of her obituaries, this &#145;claimed much of her thought during the latter period of her life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 20 Jan 1930). Unlike many of her social circle, she was a supporter of the movement to extend voting rights to women.<br>
<br>Adele Meyer's concern for women also extended to the abuses many of them suffered in their jobs. From 1906 she became involved, with Clementina Black, in a detailed investigation into the work of women in London in the unregulated tailoring, dressmaking, and underclothing trades. The resulting publication, <span class="italic">Makers of our clothes, being the results of a year's investigation into the work of women in London in the tailoring, dressmaking and underclothing trades</span>, written by Meyer and Black, appeared in 1909. The conclusion of the investigation was that: &#145;If there is any immediate means by which legislation might diminish the evil of underpayment, it is the highest time that legislation should intervene in aid of a law-abiding, industrious, and greatly oppressed, class of citizens&#146;  (p. 18).<br>
<br>Adele Meyer continued to act as a hostess, both in London and in the splendid Queen Anne home in Essex beside the River Cam. The banker Charles Addis recorded a visit to the country home in 1909. He was impressed, but rather patronizingly described her as agreeable but &#145;not deep or learned with good impulses in her fashionable way&#146;. He added that &#145;She ripples along about higher education and vocation schools and health culture and music&#146;  (Kynaston, 2.331&#150;2). In appearance she was &#145;A short plump blonde, [with] wavy grey hair, very dark eyebrows and eyelashes, beautiful white teeth&#146;  (ibid., 331). Both she and her husband were enthusiastic patrons of the opera and discriminating buyers of paintings. After her husband's death in 1922 she served on the committee of the Shakespeare Memorial National Theatre (established in 1963 as the National Theatre, London).<br>
<br>A memorable portrait of Adele Meyer, depicting her and her two children, was painted in 1897 by John Singer Sargent and hung in the dining-room at Shortgrove during her lifetime. It was exhibited at the Royal Academy and has been described as a consummation of <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i> opulence. Henry James praised its &#145;wonderful rendering of life, of manners, of aspects, of types, of textures, of everything&#146;  (Kynaston, 2.332). After his visit Addis agreed that it was a superb portrait.<br>
<br>Despite all Adele Meyer's involvements with social reform, the writer of her obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> felt that &#145;her chief interests &hellip; lay with those near to her&#146;, namely her children and grandchildren, &#145;concerning whose welfare she was vigilant and active&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 21 Jan 1930). Lady Meyer died of heart failure on 17 January 1930 at her home in Kent, Chipstead Place, Chevening.<br>
