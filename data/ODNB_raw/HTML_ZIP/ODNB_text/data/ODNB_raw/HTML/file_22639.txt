<span class="headword">Povey,  Charles</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1651?, <em>d.</em> 1743), <span class="occ">writer and entrepreneur</span>, may have been the Charles Povey, son of John and Elizabeth Povey, baptized at St Andrew's, Holborn, on 27 July 1651. Povey himself was ambiguous about his ancestry, claiming only that his birth was neither noble nor ignoble. His brother, Josiah (<i>d</i>. 1727), was a clergyman at Telscombe, Sussex. Povey was married&#151;his wife's name was Anne&#151;but had no children. His first published works were political tracts directed against James II. For these writings he was gaoled in the 1680s but he continued to write about Jacobitism in <span class="italic">A Challenge to All Jacobites</span> (1689) and <span class="italic">A Challenge in Vindication of the Revolution</span> (1690).<br>
<br>More is known about Povey from the late 1690s when he turned to economic subjects. He published <span class="italic">Proposals for Raising one Thousand Pounds</span> (1699) and entered Britain's thriving coal trade as a wholesaler in 1700. Povey was harassed by coal-dealers in Wapping, where he was living. He had designed a hoist, which supplanted lightermen, for the job of unloading ships at his wharf at Execution Dock, enabling Povey to sell coal priced below the going rate. After being convicted for selling false measure in May 1700, Povey maintained the charges had arisen only because he would neither pay bribes to officials nor price like his competitors. He defended his discount pricing in <span class="italic">A discovery of indirect practices in the coal-trade, or, A detection of the pernicious maxims and unfair dealings of a certain combination of men, who affirm, it is a cheat to be just, and just to cheat</span> (1700); but he traded coal no more. In 1701 he published <span class="italic">The Unhappiness of England as to its Trade by Sea and Land</span>, a work lamenting the impact of monopolistic practices on shipowners and their crews. Povey increasingly came to believe that government regulation was needed to avoid unfair practices in the British coal trade. His next two publications were on religious topics: <span class="italic">Meditations of a Divine Soul</span> (1703) and <span class="italic">Holy Thoughts on a God-Made Man</span> (1704). The latter of these also illustrates Povey's lifelong interest in astronomy, a topic to which he would return in <span class="italic">The Opinions of Ancient Philosophers about the Substance and Nature of the Sun</span> and <span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Nature &hellip; of the Heavenly Bodies</span>.<br>
<br>By 1705 Povey was at Hatton Garden, near Holborn, in a rented building he called the Traders' Exchange House. There Povey matched lenders with debtors, connected those wishing to sell properties with those wishing to buy them, and generally operated as a middleman. In conjunction with that business Povey edited a single-sheet newspaper, the <span class="italic">General Remark on Trade</span> (containing mostly advertisements), the first number of which appeared on 23 October 1705. It continued under that title through to issue number 213 of 7 July 1707 and as <span class="italic">General Remark on Trade: with an Extract of Foreign News and Observations on Publick Affairs</span>, and similar titles with expanded contents, until at least 22 December 1708. Advertisements became secondary to tables of currency exchange, stock valuations, commodity prices, export and import figures, lists of ships &#145;Arriv'd at, and Departed from several Ports of England&#146;, foreign news from papers such as the <span class="italic">Paris Gazette</span>, lists of &#145;Christenings and Burials&#146;, columns of miscellany, brief descriptions of various English towns, counties, and of the universities at Oxford and Cambridge, and running essays on topics such as the trade of England and Scotland. All of that was pitched with Povey's characteristic twist of charitable concern:<blockquote>Favour our Undertaking &hellip; because out of the Profits arising by the sale of it, 20 Poor Boys, most Orphans &hellip; are Cloathed, kept to School, allowed 2s. 6d. a Week each, and at Two Years End, Five Pounds a piece given, to put them out Apprentices to Trades, and Twenty others taken in their Room.</blockquote>These same boys comprised Povey's delivery team. Povey relied, as well, on the labour of others for some of the paper's content, which he admitted was reprinted from &#145;the Old Athenian Mercuries&#146;.<br>
<br>Povey's scheming mind would not be contained and he became caught up in the excitement over insurance companies. In May 1706 Povey floated his own life-insurance scheme, proposing that it would &#145;bring <i>The Traders Exchange-House</i> into far greater Credit and Business than ever&#146; and also make the <span class="italic">General Remark on Trade</span> &#145;sell all over England, more than any other&#146;. It would also fulfil a philanthropic role by &#145;increasing the Store of the Rich, bettering the Circumstances of Persons in a middle Station, and maintaining many who are reduced to want, by Losses, Oppression, or Wrong&#146;. From the quarterly premiums collected from 4000 subscribers, Povey proposed to pay claims on a quarterly basis and also to use profits to construct &#145;a Structure in or some where about <i>London</i>, containing 100 Rooms of &pound;1,000 Value; and the said Structure is to bear the Name of the TRADERS EXCHANGE-HOUSE-COLLEGE&#146;, that would house 100 of the most needy policy-holders and their families.<br>
<br>In 1708 Povey began a new project that would insure &#145;Moveables, Goods, Merchandizes and Wares from Loss by Fire&#146;. The Exchange House Fire Office long outlived Povey's involvement. Povey organized a group of &#145;Exchange House Men&#146; who, &#145;able Bodied&#146; and chosen &#145;out of different Parishes, in the Cities and Suburbs of London and Westminster&#146;, would &#145;be ready at Hand, to give immediate Assistance, where-ever a FIRE shall break forth, in Removing and Securing the Moveable Goods, Merchandizes and Wares, of all &hellip; Subscribers&#146;. Subscribers' homes were identified by &#145;a Mark representing the SUN, nailed up against their Houses&#146;. In 1709 Povey gave up part ownership of the Exchange House Fire Office, or the Sun Fire House as it was popularly known, to raise capital for yet another enterprise.<br>
<br>On 4 October 1709 Povey started his Half-penny Carriage of Letters, a business that infringed upon the monopoly of the royal post. Povey's service delivered letters and parcels between depots in London, Southwark, and Westminster, where patrons identified Povey's mail carriers by their ringing bells. Accused in late 1709 by the Post Office authorities of infringing on their monopoly, a number of letters were exchanged in the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> between Povey and his accusers. Povey's halfpenny post continued to operate for a number of months during this clamour, but eventually was stopped.<br>
<br>On 21 August 1710 Povey had printed the first number of <span class="italic">The Visions of Sir Heister Ryley, with Other Entertainments</span>. Described by Povey himself as an imitator of Richard Steele's <span class="italic">The Tatler</span>, <span class="italic">The Visions</span> was published thrice weekly in two quarto leaves and continued for eighty numbers until 21 February 1711. In the preface to the first number Povey explained that he thought &#145;it adviseable to steer a middle Course, between the Rocks of Padantick Elocution, and the Shallows of a mean Utterance; so as to adapt his Compositions to the Genius of every Capacity&#146;. His design was &#145;to instill into the Mind of the Reader sound Principles of Morality, under the Vail of a pleasing Vision, an apposite Allegory, or a lively Emblem&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1714 Povey published, anonymously, his <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Miscarriages of the Four Last Years Reign</span> (1714), in which he summarized his long-standing literary goal to supplant vice for virtue:<blockquote>I have writ Five large <i>Quarto</i> and <i>Octavo</i> volumes, with many other treatises to recommend Vertue, Loyalty, Wit, Honour, Truth, and Moderation, and to extinguish Vice, Rebellion, Bribery, Pride and Ambition; and yet I see Men of Figure and Fortune still more degenerate in their Morals.</blockquote>That work was followed by others, such as <span class="italic">A Memorial of the Proceedings of the Late Ministry</span> (1714), one of the most widely circulated pro-whig works of the year, and <span class="italic">The English Parliament Represented in a Vision</span> (1715). Thereafter in <span class="italic">The Subject's Representation</span> (1717), <span class="italic">English Inquisition</span> (1718), and <span class="italic">Britain's scheme to make a new coin of gold and silver to give in exchange for paper money and South Sea stock</span> (1720), Povey turned against the ruling whigs.<br>
<br>Povey continued to contrive and market devices of various sorts well into his old age. In 1723 he designed a &#145;fire-annihilator&#146;, essentially a water bomb, for extinguishing fires. Almost twenty years later he invented a self-playing organ, a device that was announced in the <span class="italic">Daily Advertiser</span> on 23 November 1742. He also had begun to look back at his earlier years, publishing a number of books that made reference to his past deeds and tribulations, such as <span class="italic">The Secret History of the Sun Fire Office</span> (1733), <span class="italic">England's Memorial to Obtain Right and Property</span> (1737), and <span class="italic">The Torments after Death, upon Atheism and Charity</span> (1740), a book that commented on his various charitable projects.<br>
<br>Povey's last major publication was <span class="italic">The Virgin in Eden</span> (1741), a book written against Samuel Richardson's popular epistolary novel <span class="italic">Pamela</span>. Povey considered Richardson's to be far from a moral tale, writing in his preface: &#145;<i>Good God! what can Youths and Virgins learn from</i> Pamela's <i>Letters, more than Lessons to tempt their Chastity; those Epistles are only Scenes of Immodesty, painted in Images of Virtue; Disguises in Masquerade, as I shall prove.</i>&#146; Povey's book concluded with a catalogue listing forty of his works. Another short section, headed &#145;Universal Charity imitates the Saviour of the World&#146;, is informative of the mind behind his writings. Povey declared his ruling belief that:<blockquote>no Man can be a Christian in Life and Doctrine, that judges or censures any Speech or Language in Points of Religion, or Principles of Faith. Neither can we be perfect, unless we are invested with a Spirit of Mercy and Pity to all living Creatures in Distress and Pain.</blockquote>It is in that spirit that:<blockquote>the Author most humbly petitions the Publick in Christ's Name, to make one Act of Charity universal in this Island. That as often as any Housekeeper, or other Person, boils any Butcher's Meat, and makes no Use of the Liquor in their own Families, that they would be so good to engage their Servants not to waste or fling the same away as usual, but give it to poor Families.</blockquote>Povey died on 4 May 1743 in Little Alie Street, Goodman's Fields, London. His will, dated 13 January 1742, was published, by his request, in the <span class="italic">London Daily Post</span>, where it appeared on the front page on 1 and 8 July 1743. Povey left his self-playing organ to the parish of St Mary, Newington, Surrey, and money for the parish charity school, for the poor of Whitechapel, and for his executors, Elizabeth Smith, his niece, and Margaret Stringer, a widow. For 100 poor tradesmen's and ministers' widows, Povey left money and a copy each of <span class="italic">The Virgin in Eden</span> and <span class="italic">Torments after Death</span>. Povey was buried beside his wife on 8 May at St Mary's, Newington.<br>
