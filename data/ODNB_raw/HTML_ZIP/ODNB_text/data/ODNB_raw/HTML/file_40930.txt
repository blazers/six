<span class="headword">Blavatsky,  Helena Petrovna</span>  (1831&#150;1891), <span class="occ">founder of theosophy</span>, was born at Yekaterinoslav (Dnepropetrovsk), Ukraine, at midnight on 30&#150;31 July 1831, the daughter of Colonel Peter Hahn (<i>d</i>. 1873), descended from the counts Rotenstern-Hahn of Mecklenburg, and of his wife, Helena Pavolovna Fadeev. She was a petted, wayward, invalid child whose mother, a novelist who advocated women's emancipation, died when she was small. From girlhood onwards she was a beguiling story-teller. On 7 July 1848 she married an older man, General Nikifor Vasilyevich Blavatsky, but separated from him in October 1848.<h2>
<a name="Earlytravels"></a>Early travels</h2>Helena Blavatsky's claims to have become an intrepid traveller seem partly authentic. She sailed for Constantinople in 1848 and toured Turkey, Greece, Egypt, and western Europe during 1849&#150;50. Her curiosity having been aroused by Fenimore Cooper's Red Indian novels, she went to Canada in 1850&#150;51, and then proceeded to investigate New Orleans voodoo. Afterwards she visited Texas, Mexico, and Latin America. She reached India in 1852, but failed in 1853 to enter Tibet, which was then closed to foreigners. Instead she visited Java and Singapore before proceeding to England. She crossed from New York to San Francisco in a covered wagon during 1853&#150;4, proceeded to Japan in 1855, returned to India, and finally in 1856 supposedly entered Tibet, where she was initiated into Buddhism. Next she lived in France and Germany before returning to Russia (1858&#150;63). During these years she &#145;claimed to have ridden bareback in a circus, toured Serbia as a concert pianist, opened an ink factory in Odessa, traded as an importer of ostrich feathers in Paris, and worked as interior decorator to the Empress Eug&eacute;nie&#146;  (Washington, 31). Boase believed she &#145;kept a gambling hell in Tiflis about 1863&#146;  (Boase, 2.430).<br>
<br>Blavatsky travelled in Europe from 1863, and averred that as an adherent of Garibaldi she had sustained sabre and bullet wounds when the Italian patriot army was dispersed by French and papal troops at the battle of Mentana (1867). According to other statements, she was shipwrecked at Spetsai off the Greek coast in 1871. These excitements are far less momentous than her claim that after returning to Asia in 1867 she had re-entered Tibet, where she remained in spiritual seclusion studying esoteric mysteries until 1870. Credence that she was a solitary visitor in Tibet for a total of seven years and was initiated by Himalayan seers is not universal.<br>
<br>Blavatsky, who had intermittently practised spiritualism from 1863, established herself as a medium holding seances in Cairo (1870&#150;72). According to her insistent recollections, she had met a dematerializing Tibetan, Master Morya, in visions some time before a corporeal meeting in London during 1851. She identified Morya as a Rajput prince who was a member of the Great White Brotherhood of Mahatmas (masters), sublime sages whose strict training and absolute purity vested them with esoteric powers. These masters (she represented) were in touch with the infinite, lived on a higher plane than the rest of humanity, could dematerialize, and were clairvoyant. It was they who had made her an adept in their arcane knowledge during her Tibetan seclusion. A lord of the world, living in the Gobi desert, headed their hierarchy. The brotherhood also numbered Buddha, Confucius, Plato, Abraham, Moses, Solomon, Lao Tzu, Cagliostro, Mesmer, Roger Bacon, and Francis Bacon among its number. Blavatsky proclaimed herself as the chosen messenger of this celestial brotherhood without explaining why she had been chosen; she acknowledged that dark forces often vilified the human intermediaries who transmitted the doctrines of the masters. Contact with the spirits of the dead, at which she was an adept, was of little importance compared with communion with the living masters, she later insisted.<br>
<br>In 1873 Blavatsky reached New York City in a condition of near destitution. Her prosperity began to revive after a meeting with Colonel Henry Olcott, whom she impressed with her powers as a medium. Although accused of fraud by another medium, Daniel Dunglas Home, she was undeterred. In 1875 she discovered that her masters could transmit their ideas through &#145;precipitated&#146; letters which were communicated to her by automatic writing or mysteriously materialized in her own or other people's homes.<br>
<br>Blavatsky's name had been linked during the 1850s and 1860s with those of a German baron, a Polish prince, and a Hungarian or Serbian opera singer, Agardi Metrovich; but suggestions that she was a <i>grande horizontale</i> seem spurious. She enjoyed intrigue of every sort, as well as stormy rows; but her professed dislike of sexual activity seems sincere. Nevertheless, on 3 April 1875, supposedly after obtaining an American divorce, she married (perhaps bigamously) Michael C. Betanelly, an immigrant businessman from Russian Georgia. If they cohabited, it was only briefly.<h2>
<a name="Thefoundingoftheosophy"></a>The founding of theosophy</h2>Blavatsky was richly imaginative and an omnivorous, highly suggestible reader familiar with Asian theology, Masonic, Rosicrucian, and Templar rituals, and the occult romances of Bulwer Lytton. These sources were invaluable in 1875 when she founded, with the support of Olcott and William Q. Judge, the Theosophical Society. This society aimed to form a nucleus of the universal brotherhood of humanity without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste, or colour; to promote the study of comparative religion, philosophy, and science; and to investigate the mystic or occult powers latent in life and matter. Overall Blavatsky was unsympathetic to Christianity, neglectful of Islam and Judaism, and considered Hinduism and Buddhism as the conduits of religious discovery. She promised her votaries that theosophy could cure human anguish by enriching the spirit and rejecting sterile intellectualism, secularism, and materialist philosophy and psychology. From early on it was identified with the nascent movement for the cremation of corpses.<br>
<br>Having become high priestess of a new religious system (which, however, she insisted was a science), Blavatsky next produced its bible, <span class="italic">Isis Unveiled</span> (1877). This hectic survey of magic and mystery was supposedly the result of astral dictation or other interventions by the mahatmas (masters). Its extracts and paraphrases from ancient writings challenged the mechanical and materialist spirit of the age, and provided spiritual stimulation at a time when religious faith seemed to be weakened. The book's first section belabours David Hume, Charles Darwin, and Thomas Huxley for constricting scientific notions to demonstrable laws governing the material universe. Blavatsky insisted that other laws of nature, hitherto accessible only to occult wisdom, were indispensable for full scientific understanding. She was especially antagonistic to Darwin, and kept in her room a stuffed bespectacled baboon, dressed in wing collar, morning coat, and tie, with a copy of <span class="italic">The Origin of Species</span> tucked under its arm to express her contempt for evolution theory. The second part of <span class="italic">Isis Unveiled</span> contained Blavatsky's exposition of Buddhism and thoughts on comparative religion. The book excited the hopes and passions of credulous, earnest, and perhaps ill-educated readers who were undeterred by its hodgepodge of ideas, quotations, and huge spiritual projections.<br>
<br>Blavatsky became a US citizen in 1878 but never re-visited the country after sailing for India later that year. Arriving in Bombay in February 1879, she and Olcott started a magazine, <span class="italic">The Theosophist</span>, and became minor celebrities (viewed with deep suspicion, initially, by the imperial government). The Anglo-Indian journalist Alfred Sinnett was among those who found her sincere, brilliant, and life-enhancing. He became one of her most persuasive propagandists, but recognized her blunders:<blockquote>She was rugged and eccentric in appearance; she dressed anyhow&#151;in loose wrappers&#151;and smoked cigarettes incessantly. Worse than this, she was passionate and excitable, and often violent in her language. Namby-pamby conventionality shrank from her aghast&#151;to her grim satisfaction, for she loathed it. She had a loud voice, that grew harsh in its tones when she felt irritated, and something or other would irritate her fifty times a day. (<span class="italic">Review of Reviews</span>, 3, 551)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Expansionofthesociety"></a>Expansion of the society</h2>In India, from 1879, Blavatsky and Olcott converted many adherents to theosophy. In 1880 they both became nominal Buddhists in Ceylon where the Buddhist Theosophical Society subsequently built many schools and had a long-term progressive effect on Sri Lankan education. Subsequently, in 1882, they established the headquarters of the Theosophical Society at Adyar, near Madras. By 1885 121 lodges (on a Masonic model) had been chartered by the Theosophical Society, 106 of them in Burma, India, and Ceylon. Independent theosophical sections were formed in the USA (1886), UK (1888), India (1891), Australia and Sweden (1895), New Zealand (1896), the Netherlands (1897), and France (1899). The theosophical movement always lacked administrative and doctrinal cohesion; moreover, it attracted members whose interest in esoteric contact with rulers of the universe suggested neuroses or worse.<br>
<br>The frauds at seances perpetrated by Blavatsky became more reckless. She was an indiscreet woman who courted but could not control publicity. Eventually she was denounced as a fraud. Emma Coulomb, an unpleasant woman who had been involved with Blavatsky's Cairo seances of 1872, was unwisely employed as housekeeper at the society's headquarters. In 1884 she caused panic and indignation among theosophists by revealing the legerdemain behind some of Blavatsky's supernatural tricks: Richard Hodgson was dispatched by the Society for Psychical Research to Madras to investigate her allegations. Some months later in 1884 a Madras missionary magazine (which opposed theosophy for exalting those Oriental philosophies against which the Christians were working) obtained from Mrs Coulomb letters from Blavatsky betraying her as an impostor. The letters' authenticity was denied; but Hodgson decried her as a crafty, vulgar, and deceitful adventuress who should be shunned as a fraudulent medium rather than honoured as the chosen spokeswoman of hidden seers. A turbulent and destructive scandal ensued.<br>
<br>Blavatsky left India in 1885, almost overwhelmed by obloquy, although her devoted adherents considered these denunciations as signs of grace. After living quietly in Italy, Germany, and Belgium, she established her own esoteric Blavatsky Lodge in London (1887), together with a theosophical magazine, <span class="italic">Lucifer the Light-Bringer</span>. Her robust and captivating conversation impressed many in these final years. W. B. Yeats, who became a member of Blavatsky Lodge in 1888, likened her talk to Samuel Johnson's. She seemed to have:<blockquote>more human nature than anybody else &hellip; She sat there all evening, talking to whoever came&#151;vast and shapeless of body, and perpetually rolling cigarettes&#151;humorous and unfanatic, and displaying always &hellip; a mind that seemed to pass all others in her honesty. (Yeats, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 24)</blockquote>It was in this period that Blavatsky wrote her huge, complicated book <span class="italic">The Secret Doctrine</span> (1888). Supposedly derived from stanzas written in a language of Blavatsky's own invention, Senzar, it covers cosmic evolution, the origins of the universe, the history of humankind (derived from higher beings of lunar origins), reincarnation, and other incomprehensible matter.<br>
<br>Despite Blavatsky's huge, cumbersome bulk, she ran a heterogeneous community household of admirers and a busy volunteer staff. They were convinced that she was the visible agent of transcendent powers and individuals, and credited her with a stupendous revival of forgotten knowledge. She manipulated her followers, and thrived on strife, as Yeats noted in 1889 when she expelled three members for flirtation or gossiping:<blockquote>Madame Blavatsky is in high spirits. The society is like the &#145;happy family&#146; that used to be exhibited around Charing Cross station&#151;a cat in a cage full of canaries. The Russian cat is beginning to purr now and smoothen its fur again&#151;The canary birds are less by three&#151;The faithful will be more obedient than ever. (<span class="italic">Collected Letters of W. B. Yeats</span>, 1.162)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>Blavatsky was a prolific correspondent whose own words near the end of life best describe her aims and self-assessment. She wrote in 1890:<blockquote>The Theosophical Society has been called the Royal Asiatic Society <i>plus</i> philanthropy. The theosophical movement was a necessity of the age [because] it appealed to certain human instincts and aspirations, and held up a certain lofty ideal of perfectibility &hellip; its strongest allies were the human yearnings for light upon the problem of life, and for a nobler conception of the origin, destiny and potentialities of the human being.</blockquote>She was convinced that:<blockquote>morals, peace and prosperity will be promoted by the universal belief in a life after death (whether eternal or broken up by a series of incarnations on the same earth), and in man's possession of a higher, undying SELF, latent spiritual powers, and consciousness.</blockquote>Theosophy and its leaders were the victims of &#145;sectarian bigotry &hellip; frenzied calumny and downright falsehood&#146;  (Blavatsky, &#145;Recent progress&#146;, 174&#150;6).<br>
<br>Blavatsky was dishonest, rash, mischievous, and self-infatuated; but her intellect, physical powers, creative energy, and tenacity were exceptional. &#145;A very gifted and original woman&#146;, W. T. Stead rightly judged; &#145;a fiery, impulsive, passionate creature, full of failings, and personally the very reverse of beautiful&#146;  (W. T. Stead, &#145;Madame Blavatsky&#146;, <span class="italic">Review of Reviews</span>, 3.549). Latterly she was grossly overweight and was trundled about by her admirers in a wheelchair of eccentric design. Weakened by Bright's disease (kidney failure), she died of influenza on 8 May 1891 at her home, 19 Avenue Road, St John's Wood, and was cremated at Woking on 11 May. Her ashes were scattered at Madras. Her death precipitated further deep divisions in theosophy and the emergence of Annie Besant as one of its leaders. Besant, who in 1895 was confirmed as Blavatsky's <i>de facto</i> successor, considered that &#145;she was much more a man than a woman. Outspoken, decided, prompt, strong-willed, genial, humorous, free from pettiness, and without malignity, she was wholly different from the average female type&#146;  (<span class="italic">Review of Reviews</span>, 4, 41).<br>
