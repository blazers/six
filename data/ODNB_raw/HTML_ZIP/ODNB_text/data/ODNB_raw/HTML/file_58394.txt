<span class="headword">Mapother,  Edward</span>  (1881&#150;1940), <span class="occ">psychiatrist</span>, was born on 12 July 1881 at 6 Merrion Square, Dublin, the only son of the seven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34869/', "Edward Dillon Mapother (1835&#150;1908)")</script>, surgeon to St Vincent's Hospital and president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland (1879&#150;80), and Ellen, daughter of John Tobin MP of Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 1888 the family moved to London when E. D. Mapother went into private practice at 32 Cavendish Square. Edward Mapother was educated at University College school and hospital, from where he graduated MB BS in 1905, winning medals in pathology and medicine. After graduation he served as houseman under Risien Russell at the National Hospital, Queen Square. In 1908 Mapother obtained his MD (London) and was appointed to the new London county council asylum at Long Grove, Epsom. He worked with an exceptionally gifted team of young psychiatrists, including Hubert Bond and Bernard Hart, who were experimenting with the new psychological theories of Janet and Freud. The tension between the neurological work carried out at Queen Square and the psychotherapeutic regime instituted at Long Grove was to inform Mapother's intellectual outlook for the rest of his career.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of war in 1914 Mapother volunteered for the Royal Army Medical Corps. He worked as a surgeon in the military hospitals at &Eacute;taples and Millbank and later in Mesopotamia and India. In April 1917 he was invalided back to England with sciatica. He retrained in military psychiatry at Maghull Military Hospital and was appointed neurologist to the 2nd Western General Hospital in Manchester. Mapother demonstrated great energy and organizational ability in his new post, establishing two subsidiary neurological hospitals in Stockport which he administered almost singlehanded until his demobilization in March 1919.<br>
<br>In September 1919, Mapother was appointed medical superintendent to the Ministry of Pensions war neurosis centre in the requisitioned Maudsley Hospital. After the centre's closure in October 1920 Mapother returned to Long Grove, yet he never abandoned his commitment to the Maudsley. He was deeply involved in the protracted discussions concerning its future funding and organization. Mapother was insistent that the institution fulfil its original purpose as a centre for voluntary treatment and psychiatric research. In January 1923 his efforts were rewarded. The Maudsley reopened with Mapother as its medical superintendent. It was a position he was to hold until the end of his career. The post provided the institutional space and intellectual opportunity for Mapother to realize his own vision of psychiatry. At a disciplinary level Mapother strengthened the academic status of the science, forging close links between the Maudsley and the University of London. In 1924 the hospital was recognized as a centre for postgraduate education and in 1936 Mapother was elected to the university's newly created chair in clinical psychiatry.<br>
<br>Intellectually Mapother promoted an eclectic therapeutic. He was suspicious of system-building philosophies which attempted to explain all the symptoms of mental distress through reference to a single cause. In his presidential address to the psychiatric section of the Royal Society of Medicine (<span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine</span>, 1936) and his unpublished Bradshaw lecture before the Royal College of Physicians (1938) Mapother attacked the &#145;therapeutic chanticleers&#146; of psychoanalysis who mistook diagnostic concepts for clinical entities. Yet within the Maudsley he tolerated the use of all forms of therapy, from hormone treatment to Jungian analysis.<br>
<br>In 1939 Mapother resigned from the Maudsley Hospital due to ill health. In his career he had secured status, funding, and clinical success not simply for the Maudsley but for British psychiatry as a whole. As a teacher, he had trained many of the most influential psychiatrists in post-war Britain, including Aubrey Lewis and William Sargant. As a manager, he had established a programme of research and funding through his close negotiations with the Medical Research Council and the Rockefeller Foundation. He died at Mill Hill Emergency Hospital on 20 March 1940 from asthma and pulmonary fibrosis. His ashes were scattered in the grounds of the Maudsley. Mapother was survived by his wife of twenty-five years, Barbara Mary (<i>d</i>. 1945), the daughter of Charles Reynolds. They had no children, but in 1950 their name was commemorated through the Mapother bequest which instituted two research studentships in psychiatry and an eponymous annual lecture at the Maudsley.<br>
