<span class="headword">Seddon,  Thomas</span>  (1753&#150;1795/6), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was born at Acres Barn, Pendleton, Lancashire, the son of John Seddon, farmer, of Pendleton. He received his early education at a number of local schools, including the Manchester grammar school. He was intended by his father for the medical profession and at the age of seventeen was entered for training at the Manchester Infirmary. His own aspirations, however, lay towards the church and while still at the infirmary he received an education in the classics under the tutorship of the Revd John Clayton of the collegiate church in Manchester. Encouraged by a promise of preferment from a certain baronet, he entered Magdalen Hall, Oxford, as a gentleman commoner, matriculating in 1776. He does not seem to have taken any degree and according to his own account was not much benefited by an academic education but he obtained a testimonial and without difficulty was ordained a deacon in 1777 and priest in 1778. The original promise of preferment was not fulfilled, and a combination of improvidence and the expense of his education left Seddon in debt. He sought to resolve his financial difficulties by making an advantageous marriage and on 2 October 1777 married Margaret Sidebottom, a young lady of good family near Manchester. The marriage seems to have proved a disappointment to both parties&#151;there were no children&#151;and seems effectively to have terminated by separation before 1786.<br>
<br>Seddon's early career in the church was also a disappointment. In 1779 he was licensed as incumbent of Stretford, a small living in which he had served as curate since 1778, and in 1781 was also offered the new living of St George's, Wigan. However, his living at Stretford was sequestered for debt after he had been there two or three years, while opposition from an influential group of parishioners in Wigan obliged him to give up St George's. His reputation was further damaged by his publication in 1779 of <span class="italic">Characteristic strictures, or, Remarks on upwards of one hundred portraits, of the most eminent persons in the counties of Lancaster and Chester: particularly in the town and neighbourhood of Manchester</span>. This work, penned under the influence of multiple disappointments and published anonymously, consisted in a number of satirical and libellous sketches of local notables and gave great offence.<br>
<br>After the sequestration of Stretford, Seddon appears to have sought to supplement his income by writing and by serving as chaplain to the earl of Lonsdale. In 1786 he published his most significant work, <span class="italic">Letters written to an officer in the army on various subjects, religious, moral, and political, with a view to the manners, accomplishments, and proper conduct of young gentlemen</span>, in two octavo volumes. This work, probably addressed to his brother the future Lieutenant-General Daniel Seddon, together with his other published output (a number of sermons and a volume of 1780 entitled <span class="italic">Impartial and Free Thoughts on a Free Trade to the Kingdom of Ireland</span>) reveal him generally to have been a man of conventional high-church tory views.<br>
<br>Although in the autobiographical introduction to the <span class="italic">Letters</span> Seddon described himself as retired from all professional engagements and without hope of succeeding to any, his career seems to have revived in 1788, when he was nominated to the perpetual curacy of St Anne's Lydgate in Saddleworth, which he held in plurality with Stretford. The living was poor, however, and his debts continued to increase. In the 1790s he was prominent in co-ordinating anti-radical activity in the area and in 1794 he became chaplain to the 104th regiment of foot, the Royal Manchester volunteers, before leaving in 1795 to join the regiment at Belfast. He met his death by drowning, possibly with men from the regiment who had been transferred to an expeditionary force to the West Indies and whose transport was lost in a gale on 18 November 1795 near Portland. No notification of his death, however, reached Manchester before May 1796, and its precise date remains uncertain.<br>
