<span class="headword">Davis, Miss</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1736, <em>d.</em> in or after 1755), <span class="occ">musician and singer</span>, was the daughter of Mr Davis (<i>fl</i>. 1735&#150;1745), an organist, harpsichordist, and composer, and the singer Mrs Davis (<i>fl</i>. 1730&#150;1751), sister of the violinist John Clegg and the singer Miss Clegg. Both parents were active in Dublin concert life. Miss Davis&#151;whose forename is unrecorded&#151;was a child prodigy, first advertised in Dublin in November 1742 with notice of a forthcoming &#145;Concert of Vocal and Instrumental Musick&#146; for her benefit and described as &#145;a Child of 6 years old&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>). The concert (postponed from December 1742 to February 1743) featured her accompanying her mother in a song as well as playing a concerto and other pieces on the harpsichord. Thereafter she generally held at least one benefit concert each year up to 1750, at either the Crow Street Musick Hall or the Fishamble Street Musick Hall in Dublin. At her d&eacute;but on 5 February 1743, which took place at Crow Street, both her mother and aunt sang; subsequently Mrs Davis frequently sang at her daughter's benefits. Her benefit concert on 5 February 1745 received an enthusiastic critical notice:<blockquote>Last Tuesday &hellip; (a child of 8 Years old) &hellip; played several of Mr Handel's most difficult Grand Lessons and Concertos upon the Harpsichord, to a numerous and polite Audience[;] there were present some of the best Judges, who unanimously expressed their great Admiration of her extraordinary and masterly Performance. (<span class="italic">Faulkner's Dublin Journal</span>, 9 Feb 1745, quoted in Boydell, <span class="italic">Musical Calendar</span>, 102)</blockquote>Miss Davis's London d&eacute;but was at Hickford's Room (then London's foremost concert venue) on 10 May 1745, when she was described as &#145;a child of eight years &hellip; lately arrived from Ireland&#146;  (Boydell, <span class="italic">Musical Calendar</span>, 276); on this occasion she again accompanied her mother. On 6 February 1748, now described as &#145;a child of eleven&#146;  (ibid., 114), besides playing the harpsichord at her annual benefit, Miss Davis sang &#145;some fine Italian songs&#146;  (ibid.) of her own composition. By 1750 the notice of her benefit concert advertised her talents in hyperbolic terms: &#145;Miss Davis, a Native of this Town &hellip; is by all Judges of the Harpsichord, both in England and in Ireland, allowed to have arrived at a greater Perfection on the Instrument than any one ever of her age&#146;  (<span class="italic">Faulkner's Dublin Journal</span>, 30 Jan 1750, quoted in Boydell, <span class="italic">Musical Calendar</span>, 136). Some &#145;Ladies of Quality&#146;  (ibid.) had encouraged her to think of teaching the harpsichord to young ladies; she hoped with her benefit performance to attract the &#145;Nobility and Gentry&#146;  (ibid.) that they might judge her qualifications &#145;for that Purpose&#146;  (ibid.). She took part in a benefit concert for Signor Marella at Crow Street in December 1751, playing a solo on the harpsichord with Marella playing the violin. In October 1753 it was noted in the <span class="italic">Dublin Journal</span> that &#145;Miss Davis, who has been many years distinguished &hellip; for her fine Performance on the Harpsichord &hellip; proposes to attend young Ladies to teach them&#146;  (ibid., 187). In November 1755 a further notice in the <span class="italic">Dublin Journal</span> stated that she had given up harpsichord playing in public but continued to teach. Nothing further seems to be known of her life and career.<br>
