<span class="headword">Kynaston,  Herbert</span>  (1809&#150;1878), <span class="occ">headmaster</span>, second son of Roger Kynaston (<i>c</i>.1777&#150;1847), and Georgiana, third daughter of Sir Charles Oakeley, governor of Madras, was born at Warwick. From 1821 he was educated at Westminster School, where he was badly injured by an explosion of fireworks in his pocket. He was elected to a studentship at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1827, where he obtained the college prize for Latin verse in 1829, took a first class in classics in 1831, and was appointed tutor and Greek reader in 1836. He graduated BA in 1831, MA in 1833, and BD and DD in 1849. He was university select preacher in 1841. In 1834 he was ordained, and served as curate of Culham, Oxfordshire. Four years later, at the early age of twenty-eight, he was elected to the high-mastership of St Paul's School, London, on the retirement of Dr John Sleath. On 2 August 1838, shortly after his appointment, he married Elizabeth Selina, daughter of Hugh Kennedy of Cultra, co. Down.<br>
<br>During the thirty-eight years of his successful rule at St Paul's, Kynaston carried through many innovations. The practice of taking boarders ceased, a mathematics master was appointed, and teaching in modern languages was instituted. M. M. Demogeot and Montucci, the French commissioners who visited the school in 1866, especially mentioned the paternal manner in which the high-master dealt with the boys  (<span class="italic">De l'enseignement secondaire en Angleterre et en &Eacute;cosse</span>, 1868, 241). School tradition suggests that his benign regime, in which he declined to use corporal punishment, was ineffectual. In 1864 the public-school commissioners noted a decline in the academic performance of the school, though this was largely attributable to the unsuitability of the school's location. Kynaston, however, opposed its removal to a more salubrious site.<br>
<br>In 1850 Lord Truro, an old Pauline, presented Kynaston to the City living of St Nicholas, Cole Abbey, with St Nicholas Olave, which he held until the parishes were amalgamated with St Mary Somerset in 1866. He resigned the mastership of St Paul's in 1876, and the only preferment that he held at the time of his death was the prebendal stall of Holborn in St Paul's Cathedral, to which he was presented by Bishop Blomfield in July 1853. He died at 31 Alfred Place West, South Kensington, on 26 October 1878, and was buried at Friern Barnet on 2 November.<br>
<br>Kynaston's taste and scholarship led to his nomination as a candidate for the chair of poetry at Oxford in 1867, but he was defeated by his college contemporary, Sir Francis Hastings Doyle. Few scholars of his age surpassed him as a composer of Latin verse. He was the author of numerous poetical compositions in praise of Dean Colet, the founder of St Paul's School, which were produced each year at the apposition. Among these the <span class="italic">Number of the Fish</span> (1855), and the <span class="italic">Lays of the Seven Half-Centuries</span> written for the seventh jubilee (1859), were the best-known. To the wider world he was most familiar as a writer and translator of hymns, of which he published two volumes, in 1862 and 1864.<br>
