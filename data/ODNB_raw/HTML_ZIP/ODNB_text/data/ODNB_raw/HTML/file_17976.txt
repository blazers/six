<span class="headword">Manning,  Samuel, the elder</span>  (1786&#150;1842), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born in 1786, and baptized on 28 August at St Leonard, Shoreditch, London, the son of the sculptor Charles Manning (<i>d</i>. 1812) and his wife, Sarah Parsons. Charles Manning was the partner of John Bacon the younger (1777&#150;1859) from 1808 until his death. Detailed legal papers relating to this partnership, which came to light in 1954, show that Charles Manning was responsible for the greater part of Bacon's business, mainly in neo-classical memorials  (Cox-Johnson). Within six years of his father's death, Samuel Manning the elder took his place in the partnership. No documents relating to his role in the firm have been found so it is not known whether the terms of this partnership were the same as those for his father. Bacon retired soon after, leaving the business under Manning's control. Manning exhibited a number of portrait busts at the Royal Academy between 1806 and 1843 including in 1819, <span class="italic">Colonel Adenbrooke</span>; in 1820 <span class="italic">Princess Charlotte</span>; in 1825 <span class="italic">John Wesley</span>; in 1838 the <span class="italic">Revd Isaac Saunders</span>; in 1839 <span class="italic">Miss Hunter</span>; and in 1843 the <span class="italic">Revd Charles Manning</span>. Monuments signed by Manning or Bacon and Manning are to be found in many English churches. Mostly in the neo-classical style, they are described by Gunnis as &#145;dull and uninspired&#146; and &#145;only too prevalent in England&#146;  (Gunnis, 252). They include memorials to John Bones (<i>d</i>. 1813) at Fen Ditton, Cambridgeshire; Charles Grant in St George's, Bloomsbury (1823); Bishop Charles Warburton (<i>d</i>. 1826) and his wife at Cloyne Cathedral, co. Cork; John Wilson (<i>d</i>. 1835) at Southborough, Kent, and Lancelot Haslope (<i>d</i>. 1838) in the Wesley Chapel, City Road, London. Manning died on 7 December 1842 at his home, 17 Newman Street, London. With his wife, Eliza, Manning had four daughters, Eliza, Ann, Abigal, and Christiana Mary, and a son, <a name="cosubject_17975"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Manning the younger</span>  (1814/15&#150;1866), who was also a <span class="occ">sculptor</span>. He was baptized on 18 July 1819 at St Pancras Old Church, Pancras Road. It seems likely that the younger Manning trained in his father's workshop. He married Honoria, daughter of Captain James Williams, of Stoke Demerel, Devon, at Marylebone on 13 August 1846. His most successful work, <span class="italic">Prometheus Chained</span>, won a Society of Arts gold medal in 1834, was shown at the Great Exhibition in 1851, and was engraved for the <span class="italic">Art Union</span>. Manning exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1831 and 1858, showing mainly portrait busts, including one of John Bacon in 1846. He executed a statue of Wesley (1849) for the Theological Institute at Richmond, Surrey, and various monuments, in much the same style as his father's, such as those to William Lee Warner, at East Deerham, Norfolk (1852), and to the 53rd Shropshire regiment, at St Chad's, Shrewsbury (1860). Manning died on 29 November 1866 at Victoria Road, Surbiton, Kingston, Surrey, when his age was recorded as fifty-one.<br>
