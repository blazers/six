<span class="headword">Solomons,  Isaac <span class="st"> [Ikey]</span></span>  (<em>c.</em>1785&#150;1850), <span class="occ">receiver of stolen goods</span>, was born in London, probably in Houndsditch, one of three known children of Henry Solomons, an immigrant in his youth from W&uuml;rzburg, Bavaria. Always known as Ikey Solomons, he became a notorious East End Jewish fence, and was reputedly the model for Fagin in Charles Dickens's novel <span class="italic">Oliver Twist</span> (1838). Arthur Morrison described him as &#145;the prince of fences&#146; in <span class="italic">A Child of the Jago</span> (1896). The family were living at 24 Gravel Lane in 1827; and in that year, at the age of about sixty-nine, Henry Solomons was imprisoned for six months, convicted of receiving stolen goods from his son. Solomons senior seems to have trained as a glass-engraver, but earned his living as a dealer in his younger days, possibly acting as a merchant buying on commission for the Goldsmidt banking brothers.<br>
<br>Ikey Solomons married Ann (Hannah), daughter of Moses Julian, a coachmaster of Aldgate, at the Ashkenazi Great Synagogue in Duke's Place, Houndsditch, on 7 January 1807; four sons and two daughters were born between 1807 and 1826. Ann was described in the prison records as being 5 feet 1 inch tall, &#145;stoutish&#146;, with black hair and hazel eyes. Ikey, at 5 feet 9 inches tall, was &#145;slender&#146; and &#145;dark&#146;, with brown hair and hazel eyes. A police portrait sketch certainly depicts a man with a prominent aquiline nose, but Ikey appears to have had none of the supposedly stereotypical Jewish features, &#145;sallow complexion&#146;, or &#145;sharp hooked nose&#146; ascribed to him in some of the more colourful contemporary accounts of his adventures. Indeed, Ikey was able to pass under the gentile names of Jones or Slowman while on the run.<br>
<br>As a child Solomons served an apprenticeship in crime as a pickpocket in a neighbourhood famous for its rogues and gangs of thieves. His first known conviction was for stealing a pocket-book from a gentleman at Westminster Hall on 17 April 1810. However, as an adult he became a receiver of stolen goods, operating out of his house in Bell Lane, Spitalfields. By the mid-1820s he was well known to the police as perhaps the largest dealer in stolen bank notes in London, possibly exploiting a connection with Jewish dealers in the Netherlands for the purpose. He was arrested, gaoled at Newgate, and tried at the Old Bailey in well-publicized cases three times over, in 1810, in 1827, and 1830. On the first occasion Solomons was sentenced to transportation for life, the maximum sentence for pickpocketing. However, owing to the shortage of shipping during the Napoleonic wars, he served his sentence between July 1810 and June 1816 on rusting hulks moored in the Medway near Sheerness. He was then released in error due to a case of mistaken identity, but apparently gave himself up voluntarily and was briefly returned to ship. As a reward he was granted a free pardon on 26 October 1816.<br>
<br>In contrast, on the occasion of his second imprisonment in 1827, Solomons effected a spectacular escape from police custody and went into hiding. He surfaced in Rio de Janeiro in July 1828 and arrived in Hobart Town, Van Diemen's Land, on 6 October of that year. Meanwhile his wife Ann had also been arrested, tried, and convicted of possession of stolen goods and counterfeit money. She was transported in a convict ship to Van Diemen's Land with her four younger children and the whole family were subsequently reunited in the southern hemisphere. However, amid controversy, Ikey Solomons was recaptured and returned to England for his third and final trial. This resulted in his own transportation back to Van Diemen's Land in 1831, where he was employed as a lowly convict official. He never served as forced labour in a penal settlement, possibly reflecting the fact that he could read and write. In 1838 he was allowed to settle in Hobart Town, where he opened a shop and was finally declared a free man in 1844.<br>
<br>Solomons's wife, Ann, with whom he had made such strenuous efforts to be reunited, became unfaithful, and the quarrelsome family apparently disintegrated. Ikey Solomons was buried on 3 September 1850 in Hobart Town. Rumours that he had made a fortune in Van Diemen's Land proved unfounded: letters of administration revealed an estate of under &pound;70.<br>
