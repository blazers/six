<span class="headword">Stokes <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Sutton]</span>,  Doris May Fisher</span>  (1920&#150;1987), <span class="occ">medium</span>, was born on 6 January 1920 at 9 Wong Row, Grantham, Lincolnshire, the only daughter of Samuel Sutton, engineer's labourer, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wesselby. She was educated locally and was, as a girl, a regular customer at the shop run by Margaret Thatcher's father. While she had no formal involvement with spiritualism during early childhood, she was later to assert that her father had always been &#145;a natural psychic&#146;, and that, when still very young, she had received regular visitations from &#145;spirit children&#146;. She further claimed to have witnessed as a child the spirit of a neighbour killed in a house-fire walking alongside his charred body as it was carried from the scene of the tragedy. Her father died when she was thirteen and, at the instigation of a friend, she attended a s&eacute;ance soon afterwards. The likelihood of her own career as a medium, however, was not hinted at until some years later when, as a member of the WRAF stationed at Port Talbot, in Wales, during the Second World War, she sought entertainment by means of a number of tongue-in-cheek visits to the local spiritualist church. She later related that on many such occasions she had been informed by visiting mediums that one day it would be she who was appearing on the platform.<br>
<br>During the war (22 January 1944) Doris married John Fisher Stokes, a journeyman shoemaker, then serving in the Parachute regiment. A son, John Michael, was born in August 1944, but died aged just five and a half months. Doris remained inconsolable in her grief even after the adoption of another son, Terry, and, unable to find comfort in the Church of England faith in which she had been raised, she felt herself inexorably drawn to spiritualism. She and John began attending spiritualist services regularly, and Doris gradually found herself passing on messages from the &#145;spirit world&#146; to fellow churchgoers during post-service gatherings. These meetings became increasingly popular and, gaining confidence in the &#145;voices&#146; coming from outside her, Doris soon began holding services of her own at local spiritualist churches. In 1949 she was officially recognized as a practising clairaudient medium by the Spiritualist Union.<br>
<br>During the following years Doris Stokes became increasingly well known in spiritualist circles, devoting much of her time to public demonstrations and private sittings around the UK. In 1962 she suffered a crisis of confidence, abandoned mediumship, and trained as a psychiatric nurse, but, badly injured by a patient five years later, she was forced to give up nursing, and by 1970 was working as a psychic once more. In 1975 she accepted the post of resident medium at the Spiritualist Association of Great Britain's London headquarters, moving to London from Lancaster, where she and her family had lived since 1954. Her first major step towards celebrity came when, in 1978, she was invited to Australia to appear on the Don Lane television show. Such was the show's success that her initially brief visit to the country was extended to six weeks, during which time she played to three capacity audiences at the Sydney Opera House. There followed visits to the USA and Canada, and 1980 saw the publication of her first volume of autobiography, <span class="italic">Voices in my Ear</span>, which was composed, somewhat appropriately, with the aid of a ghost writer, and greatly heightened her profile in the UK. Six more volumes were to follow, and over 2 million copies of her books were sold during the 1980s. In December 1984 she became the first medium to appear at the London Palladium&#151;tickets for her demonstration there sold out in under two hours. Innumerable stage and television appearances ensued, as did consultations with celebrities. As her popularity snowballed so, inevitably, did the number of her detractors. Journalists were particularly keen to discredit her self-professed psychic involvement in certain criminal investigations, and it was not uncommon for members of the public to accuse her of blasphemy during public appearances. Doris always defended herself against such attacks with vigour, claiming that she was neither Satanist nor psychic detective, that her work was done for God, and that her sole purpose was to reassure people of the continued existence of the &#145;dead&#146;.<br>
<br>Although Doris Stokes was personally wounded by such negative publicity, it did little to damage her popularity. Much of her success lay in her familiar, grandmotherly appeal: a large, amiable woman, she regularly appeared on stage clad in what she termed her &#145;rent-a-tent&#146; dresses, and usually addressed audience members as &#145;lovey&#146; or &#145;dear&#146;. Many of her on-stage exchanges with the other side were of a humorous or domestic nature, and she often disarmed larger audiences by poking fun at popular conceptions of spiritualism.<br>
<br>Whatever the reality of her &#145;strange gift&#146;, Doris Stokes was an individual of great personal warmth, and she continued to give free sittings to those who sought her help until just a month before her death. Plagued by ill health throughout most of her life, she underwent some thirteen operations for cancer, including a mastectomy. In April 1987 she underwent surgery for a malignant brain tumour in the Wellington Hospital, north-west London, from which she never regained consciousness, and died in Lewisham, London, on 8 May 1987, survived by her husband.<br>
