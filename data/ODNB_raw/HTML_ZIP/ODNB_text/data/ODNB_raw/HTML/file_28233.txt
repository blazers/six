<span class="headword">Verney, Sir  Ralph</span>, first baronet  (1613&#150;1696), <span class="occ">landowner and politician</span>, was born on 9 November 1613 at Hillesden, Buckinghamshire, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28228/', "Sir Edmund Verney (1590&#150;1642)")</script> and his wife, Margaret Denton (1594&#150;1641). When Ralph was fifteen years old Sir Edmund paid &pound;1000 to the court of wards to obtain a decree that permitted his son's marriage to Mary Blacknall (1616&#150;1650), sole heir of John Blacknall, a wealthy Abingdon lawyer. Despite the protests of Mary's family, and the fact that at thirteen she was under legal age, she married Ralph on 31 May 1629. Attempts to get her to repudiate the marriage failed, and she brought the Verneys estates including Abingdon and Wasing in Berkshire and Preston Crowmarsh and Fifield in Oxfordshire. The couple lived apart until 1631, when Mary settled at the Verneys' Buckinghamshire seat at Middle Claydon. For two years Ralph spent college terms 20 miles away at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, where he formed ties with sons of important puritan families. He studied astronomy, arts, and Latin, but apparently not Greek, and spent 3&#150;4 hours a day on logic and divinity with his tutor, John Crowther.<br>
<br>The couple had only two surviving children, Edmund (1636&#150;1688) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66749/', "John Verney (1640&#150;1717)")</script>. After 1634 Verney's family lived part of each year in Covent Garden, London, with his father. Yet Verney always felt more natural giving country hospitality and he abhorred court compliment. He also became immersed in business affairs at an early age. He managed the Verneys' estates and finances and acted as trustee for friends.<br>
<br>Verney had deep feelings about his family's importance, and saved every scrap of paper, founding perhaps the largest consecutive family correspondence for seventeenth-century England. His prudent, conscientious nature and attention to detail showed most clearly in his methodical preservation of his papers, which remain at Claydon House. An ardent bibliophile, he also amassed many books and pamphlets, especially religious tracts. He was deeply interested in the theology and practice of the Church of England, and his own faith was tinged with a puritanical piety expressed in strict outward observance. Thus he refused to hire a gardener until he discovered whether he was &#145;married or popish or phanatical or takes tobacco&#146;  (Verney MSS, Ralph Verney/John Verney, 14 July 1679, BL, M/636 [33]).<br>
<br>In 1640 Verney represented Aylesbury in the Short and Long Parliaments, and was knighted in 1641. As he sat next to his father he secretly recorded his impressions, which may be read in <span class="italic">Notes of Proceedings in the Long Parliament</span>, published in 1845. As a young man with parliamentary sympathies, his position was difficult. His father was knight-marshal and standard bearer to Charles I, and he died at Edgehill in 1642 fighting for the king. Ralph Verney's younger brothers also served in the royalist army. At first he supported parliament, which caused grief to his family. However, he soon became disenchanted with political and religious radicalism, and in 1643 he refused to sign the solemn league and covenant, which pledged its signatories to religious reform and the removal of episcopacy. Moreover, the Verney estates were under financial strain, and Claydon House was located amid military positions. Rising taxes, decreasing rents, and the disruption of war combined to make his financial situation precarious.<br>
<br>Verney withdrew from parliamentary work in the summer of 1643, and fled to France in November, using the alias Ralph Smith. Prior to his flight he obtained letters of protection from both parliament and the royalists, and placed his property in trust. In 1645 he was expelled from parliament for absenting himself from his duties. It was, he confessed, &#145;one of the greatest and most inexpressible afflictions that ever yet befel me, for which my soul shall mourn in secret&#146;  (Gardiner, 2.23).<br>
<br>Verney's voluntary exile took him to Paris, Rouen, and then Blois. His decision to leave England was probably motivated by a combination of deep religious principles, loyalty to the traditional Church of England, his unstable finances, and the threat of sequestration. This indeed took place in October 1646, owing to a flawed trust deed. Sequestration was lifted only in 1648, when his wife, Mary, journeyed to England and lobbied friends in parliament. She died soon after her successful intervention, in May 1650.<br>
<br>Verney returned to England in 1653, but he was briefly imprisoned as a royalist suspect in 1655 and was fined in 1656. He had inherited an estate worth about &pound;2200 per annum, but he had debts of &pound;7700, fixed expenses of &pound;1470, and responsibility for nine brothers and sisters. Rebuilding the Verney estate became a lifelong obsession. To obtain needed cash he sold all but a tiny portion of his late wife's dower lands. But he doggedly kept his Claydon estate intact through frugal living and debt consolidation at low rates. He avoided the court, improved his estate, and cleared it of debts.<br>
<br>After the Restoration Verney regained his county offices in the magistracy and lieutenancy and accepted a baronetcy in 1661. He did not re-enter parliament, however, until the 1680s&#151;representing Buckingham in 1681, 1685, and 1689. His later religious and political views were grounded in his desire for peace and moderation after a life marred by sectarian feuding. The books that he gave to his sons reflected the midstream of religious thought: Jeremy Taylor's <span class="italic">The Rule and Exercises of Holy Living</span> (1658) and <span class="italic">The Rule and Exercises of Holy Dying</span> (1663), and Allestree's <span class="italic">The Whole Duty of Man</span> (1668). He also kept a stock of prayer books written by Dr Thomas Tenison to give as gifts to friends. He refused to take sides during the exclusion crisis, and only when the bishops and the church were threatened by James II did he finally back the revolution of 1688. Although he was a firm supporter of the crown he maintained a country independence and low-church sympathies.<br>
<br>Verney's enemies called him a &#145;trimmer&#146;, yet his trimming grew out of strength not weakness, and he commanded immense local respect. During elections in the 1680s he refused to treat the Buckingham populace, but he later contributed to their town hall, a decision of consequence in securing a successful outcome in the fiercely contested 1685 election. In 1686 he was removed from the county bench, and in 1688 from the lieutenancy, after he refused all three questions put by James II's agents concerning the repeal of the penal laws and <span class="roman">Test Act</span>. Yet in the Convention Parliament he voted for agreeing that the throne was not vacant, and subsequently appeared on several blacklists. In the 1690s he spent most of the year in Lincoln's Inn Fields, London. He died at Middle Claydon on 24 September 1696 aged eighty-two, leaving a healthy estate to his younger son, John, a London merchant, and was buried at Middle Claydon church. His family pride is reflected in the monument he erected at Claydon, with busts of his parents, his wife, and himself.<br>
