<span class="headword">Hody, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1441/2), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was the son of Thomas Hody, lord of the manor of Kington Magna in Dorset, and of Margaret, daughter of John Cole of Nethway in Devon. His grandfather was Adam Hody, who may have been born a serf. John Hody held estates at Stowell in Somerset (purchased in the 1420s) and at Pilsdon in Dorset, the latter through his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1473), daughter of John Jewe of Whitfield, near Wiveliscombe, Somerset. They had several daughters and five sons, one of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13456/', "William Hody")</script>, became attorney-general in 1485 and chief baron of the exchequer in 1486.<br>
<br>Hody was a member of parliament for Shaftesbury (1421&#150;7), Devon (1431), and Somerset (1433&#150;7). Retained by the dean and chapter of Wells, 1414&#150;17, he appears in the year-books from 1425. He argued in the exchequer chamber in 1426, was described as an apprentice in 1429, and became a serjeant-at-law in 1438, acting as serjeant of the avenary and clerk of the market of the royal household in 1441. From 1428 onwards he held commissions in the west country and the home counties, mainly of inquiry (the inquiries included concealed crown income and piracy), gaol delivery, and oyer and terminer (Cornwall and Devon in 1440, Oxfordshire and Berkshire in 1441), and was also a justice of assize on the western circuit (1439) and on the eastern circuit (1440). At the same time he was an escheator in Somerset and Dorset (1431&#150;2), recorder of Bristol (<i>c</i>.1438), and a justice of the peace in Somerset (1430), Berkshire (1439), Staffordshire, Shropshire, and Gloucestershire (1439&#150;40), Kent, Surrey, and Sussex (1440), and Essex (1441).<br>
<br>Although never a puisne justice of the king's bench, Hody became its chief justice in 1440, the year in which he was knighted. In 1441 he was appointed umpire in arbitration involving Joan Dogge, later a celebrated litigant in <i>Shipton v. Dogge</i> (1442), an action debated by all the judges in the exchequer chamber and a landmark in the development of contract law. Retained by Peterborough Abbey (1433/4), by the earl of Stafford (1437), and by the duchy of Lancaster (1438/9), he was by Henry VI's order summoned to Sheen in August 1440 to discuss threatened riots. In 1441 he condemned to execution Roger Bolingbroke, the priest implicated in the witchcraft trials involving Eleanor Cobham, duchess of Gloucester. In December 1441 he was summoned to parliament, but was prevented by death from attending. His will, stating his wish to be buried in Woolavington church, Somerset, is dated 17 December 1441, and the keepers of goods for the church of Tintinhull in Somerset recorded thereafter as an expenditure of 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. &#145;a legacy from Sir John Hody, Kt.&#146; His widow, Elizabeth, afterwards married Robert Cappes, who was sheriff of Somerset and Dorset in 1444/5.<br>
