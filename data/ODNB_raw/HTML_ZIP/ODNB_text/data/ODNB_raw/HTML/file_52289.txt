<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mikardo,  Ian</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Mik]</span>  (1908&#150;1993), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in Portsmouth on 9 July 1908, the son of Moshe (Morris) Mikardo, a tailor, and his wife, Bluma. Both his parents came to Britain in the massive Jewish exodus from the tsarist empire in the last decades of the nineteenth century and the first of the twentieth: his mother from the village of Yampol, in the western Ukraine, and his father (who arrived in Britain at the time of the South African War) from Kutno, a textile-manufacturing town west of Warsaw. When Morris Mikardo disembarked in London his total possessions consisted of the clothes that he stood up in, plus a little bag containing a change of shirt and underclothes, his accessories for prayer, and one rouble. He initially settled in the East End of London, intending, like many Russian Jews, to move on to the United States. He was, however, unable to scrape together the money for the fare, and left for Portsmouth (where there was work tailoring for the navy) with his wife in 1907.<br>
<br>Mikardo recalled that the language of the family in those early days was Yiddish. When he went to school&#151;first the Beneficial Society school, then Omega Street school, both in Portsmouth&#151;he had only a few words of English, which put him at a disadvantage with his classmates. His mother wanted him to become a rabbi, and next sent him to Aria College in Portsmouth, which had been set up &#145;for the training and maintenance of young men, natives of the County of Hampshire, as Jewish Divines on orthodox principles&#146;  (Mikardo, 30). He attributed his capacity to draft a document, at which he was superb, to the rigours of Aria College and, subsequently, to an outstanding Latin master at Portsmouth southern secondary school for boys.<br>
<br>Leaving school at 15, Mikardo shuffled from job to job, his greatest pleasure being to support a great Portsmouth football side. In 1930 he met Mary (<i>b</i>. 1907), the daughter of Benjamin Rosetsky, and as he put it, &#145;found a new family in hers&#146;  (Mikardo, 44). They married at Mile End and Bow District synagogue on 3 January 1932, and joined the Labour Party and Poale Zion, the Zionist workers' movement, which was affiliated to the party. All his life they were immersed in Jewish causes, and help for Israel, which they often visited. Nevertheless, Mik&#151;as he was universally called in the labour movement&#151;was very much an &#145;internal Israeli&#146;, worked with Mapam (the united workers' party), and abhorred anything which smacked of gratuitous provocation of the Palestinian Arabs.<br>
<br>Mikardo's crucial break came when he stumbled on an advertisement for a seminar in 1931 on what was then called &#145;scientific management&#146;. He had already seen enough in his various jobs in factories, warehouses, and marketing and distribution agencies, to satisfy himself that there was much room for improvement in the management of industries and commercial organizations. His enrolment in that seminar led to nearly sixty years of activity with the Association of Supervisory Staffs, Executives and Technicians (later the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs, of which he was president from 1968 to 1973). He spent the rest of the 1930s as a management consultant, and during the Second World War worked as an administrator in the aircraft-building industry. In 1944 he published <span class="italic">Centralised Control of Industry</span>, advocating the extension into peacetime of wartime controls on industry.<br>
<br>In 1944 Mikardo was adopted as the Labour candidate for Reading, regarded at the time as a safe Conservative seat. He quickly introduced a more &#145;scientific&#146; approach to canvassing, dividing the electorate into &#145;fors&#146;, &#145;againsts&#146;, and &#145;don't knows&#146;, and concentrating his activists' efforts on persuading the fors to vote and converting the &#145;don't knows&#146;; the &#145;Reading system&#146;, as it came to be called, was subsequently adopted by all the major parties. In the same year as his adoption, he achieved overnight fame in the labour movement. At the London conference of the party he moved a resolution, in effect restating the fundamental principles of the party and committing a Labour government to extensive nationalization. &#145;If L Plates had existed in those days I'd have been wearing one&#146;, he later wrote  (Mikardo, 76). His motion was supported by the formidable Bessie Braddock and was carried by a large majority against the wishes of the party leadership. As he left Methodist Central Hall, Herbert Morrison put a hand on his shoulder and said, &#145;Young man, you did very well this morning. That was a good speech you made&#151;but you realise, don't you, that you've lost us the General Election?&#146;  (ibid., 77). That &#145;misjudgement&#146; was followed by Labour's victory in 1945 and Mikardo's election, by a majority of 6390, as MP for Reading.<br>
<br>Despite his new-found prominence in the labour movement, Mikardo was not invited to become a minister in the Attlee government. Indeed, Attlee believed that both he and Austen Albu were unsuitable, apparently on racial grounds: &#145;They both belonged to the Chosen People, and he did not think that he wanted any more of them!&#146;  (B. Pimlott, <span class="italic">Hugh Dalton</span>, 1985, 596). Mikardo's chances of a ministerial career were further diminished by his close association with the Bevanite left of the parliamentary party: he often contributed to <span class="italic">Tribune</span>, was one of fifteen signatories of the <span class="italic">Keep Left</span> pamphlet (1947), which criticized the government's timidity, and&#151;with Sir Richard Acland, Michael Foot, and others&#151;wrote its successor, <span class="italic">Keeping Left</span> (1950) [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92511', "Keep Left")</script>]. He also wrote <span class="italic">The Second Five Years</span> (1948), setting out a radical programme for a second post-war Labour administration.<br>
<br>Mikardo held his Reading seat through the general elections of 1950, 1951, and 1955&#151;and in the last year published <span class="italic">Electioneering in Labour Marginal Constituencies</span>&#151;but in the general election of 1959 he was defeated by 3942 votes. He also lost his seat on the national executive committee of the Labour Party (to which he had first been elected in 1950) in the same year, though he returned in 1960, and remained a member until 1978. While out of parliament he focused his considerable energies on the development of his private business as an entrepreneur specializing in trade with the Soviet bloc, ably assisted by his secretary, Jo Richardson. His business activities led him to establish close relations with officials from the Soviet Union and eastern Europe, which reinforced the suspicion with which he was viewed by his Conservative opponents, and by many on the right wing of the Labour Party.<br>
<br>Mikardo returned to parliament as MP for the safe Labour seat of Poplar in the East End of London in the general election of 1964. He retained the seat (renamed Tower Hamlets, Bethnal Green, and Bow in 1974, and Bow and Poplar in 1983) until his retirement in 1987. He took a special interest in the problems of the many Bangladeshi families arriving in his constituency, whose children often had only a very few words of English. He saw them harassed by having to study the usual range of school studies while still unfamiliar with the language of their teachers and textbooks. Mindful of his own problems as a Yiddish speaker half a century earlier, he persuaded education ministers in the Labour government to allocate extra funds to local authorities where lack of English among immigrant children was a substantial problem. Mikardo was a popular local MP, and very active on behalf of his constituents. He was much less popular with the leadership of his party, and with Harold Wilson in particular; he was highly critical of the latter's policy on the Vietnam conflict, steadfastly opposed all forms of income policy, and was a firm and highly effective opponent of Barbara Castle's proposals for trade union reform outlined in the government white paper <span class="italic">In Place of Strife</span>. Indeed by 1970 &#145;he had become&#151;from his power base in the Tribune group&#151;in effect the leader of the internal opposition to the government&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 May 1993). Denied ministerial preferment, he nevertheless made a significant impact as chairman of the select committee on nationalized industries, from 1966 to 1970. In the opinion of one House of Commons clerk, he &#145;was simply the most skilful operator in committee that any of us ever saw&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 7 May 1993).<br>
<br>Mikardo served highly effectively as chairman of the national executive committee of the Labour Party in 1970&#150;71, and as chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party from March to November 1974; he was also chairman of the international committee of the Labour Party from 1973 to 1978, and vice-president of the Socialist International from 1978 to 1983. During the Labour administrations of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan in 1974&#150;9 he was again marginalized, and in 1978 he lost his seat on the national executive committee to a younger firebrand of the left, Neil Kinnock. He re-emerged as campaign manager for his old ally Michael Foot, who in November 1980 defeated Denis Healey for the leadership of the party, by ten votes; but after the party's disastrous performance in the general election of 1983 under Foot, he had little sympathy either for his successor, Neil Kinnock, or for his predominantly Bennite opponents on the left. After his retirement from the Commons, at the general election of 1987, he published his beautifully written autobiography under the apt title <span class="italic">Back-Bencher</span>.<br>
<br>With heavy jowls, thick black-rimmed spectacles, and bushy eyebrows which remained stubbornly black long after the rest of his hair had gone white, Mikardo was a gift to caricaturists. Winston Churchill once quipped: &#145;I'm told he's not as nice as he looks&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 May 1993). In fact, he was genial and approachable, with a sharp wit and a talent for self-parody. He was well known as a Commons &#145;character&#146;, and was for many years the house's unofficial bookmaker; fascinated by the mathematics of probability, he even published a pamphlet on the bookmaker's trade, <span class="italic">It's a Mug's Game</span> (1951). He inspired devotion among his constituency activists, as two socialists from Reading testified after his death:<blockquote>At first we were not unduly impressed. No overwhelming charm of manner or appearance, a harsh, somewhat adenoidal voice, and yet, within minutes he had won our respect and, soon after, even a grudging affection. Whatever the topic&#151;the National Health Service, education, social deprivation, nationalisation or socialism itself&#151;he inspired others. He knew where he was going and we wanted to go with him &hellip; above all Mik had that rarest of qualities among professional politicians&#151;integrity. (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 22 May 1993)</blockquote>He was devoted to his wife Mary (who was progressively disabled after a major heart attack in 1959), and to their two daughters, Ruth and Judy. In his final years he moved to Cheadle, Cheshire, in order to be near the latter. Suffering from sarcoma and chronic obstructive airways disease, he died on 6 May 1993 at the Stepping Hill Hospital, Stockport, after a stroke.<br>
