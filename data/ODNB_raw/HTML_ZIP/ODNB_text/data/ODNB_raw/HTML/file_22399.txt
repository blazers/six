<span class="headword">Plumptre,  Anne</span>  (1760&#150;1818), <span class="occ">writer and translator</span>, was born in Norwich, and baptized on 22 February 1760 at the Cathedral Church, Norwich, the second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22406/', "Robert Plumptre (1723&#150;1788)")</script>, prebendary of Norwich and president of Queens' College, Cambridge, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Newcome. She and her sister <a name="cosubject_22400"></a><span class="headword">Annabella <span class="st"> [Bell]</span> Plumptre</span>  (1769&#150;1838)<span class="occ"></span>, the third daughter of the family and also born in Norwich, were both well educated, particularly in languages. They began their writing careers as part of the Enfield circle in the early 1790s. This lively group in an important provincial centre was active in writing drama, poetry, and fiction. Both sisters acted in 1791 in a private theatre in <span class="italic">Adelaide</span>, a play by their friend Amelia Alderson (later Opie), for which their brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22404/', "James Plumptre (1771&#150;1832)")</script> wrote the prologue. The group also came under the influence of William Taylor of Norwich, a major intermediary between German and English culture, and the two sisters began to translate the stimulating new literature, including tales and plays (especially the popular plays of August von Kotzebue). Both women divided their time in the 1790s between Norwich and London, and Anne in particular was part of the radical dissenting culture that sympathized with the French Revolution. In 1794 she met Thomas Holcroft, playwright and radical, George Dyer, and John Thelwall, whose political campaign in Norwich she actively promoted.<br>
<br>Anne Plumptre wrote the circle's second novel, <span class="italic">Antoinette</span> (1796), published anonymously and derived from <span class="italic">Celestina</span> by Charlotte Smith. Reviewed in the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>, it was praised for its interesting story, liberal sentiments, and &#145;instructive lessons to the female world&#146;. The <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> found her second novel, <span class="italic">The Rector's Son</span> (1798), improbably plotted and romantic in a pejorative sense. But it is ambitious and energetic, and strikes out to explore a range of different settings and temperaments, notably in India. She produced two more novels: <span class="italic">Something New, or, Adventures of Campbell House</span> (1801) and <span class="italic">The History of Myself and a Friend</span> (1817). Bell Plumptre's novel <span class="italic">Montgomery, or, Scenes in Wales</span> was published the same year as Anne's <span class="italic">Antoinette</span>. In 1798 the Minerva Press brought out Bell's novel <span class="italic">The Mountain Cottage, or, Wonder upon Wonder, a Tale from the German</span>, which was a translation of Christian Heinrich Spiess's <span class="italic">Ma&uuml;sefallen und Heckelkr&auml;mer</span>.<br>
<br>Anne's translations of Kotzebue, the German playwright then in fashion in London, and Bell's of W. A. Iffland's <span class="italic">The Foresters</span>, both published in 1799, belong to the aesthetics of sensibility associated with the Gothic vogue that exploited the extremes of feeling, especially fear and the <i>frisson</i> of illicit sensuality. Sheridan borrowed Anne's accurate translation before publication in order to produce his own very successful version of Kotzebue's <span class="italic">Pizarro, or, The Spaniards in Peru: a Tragedy</span>. Anne also translated a <span class="italic">Life and Literary Career of Kotzebue</span> (1801).<br>
<br>The sisters' writing careers and political sympathies began to diverge. Amelia Opie contrasted the two sisters: &#145;Bell is laudably attentive to her studies, and stays at home, while Anne, <i>a little in love</i>, as usual, is more at Ham &hellip; than in Caroline Street&#146;  (unpublished letter, Huntingdon MS, OP60, 12 Dec 1800). This was the pattern from now on: Bell was a teacher for a time, and some of her tales from the German, such as <span class="italic">Domestic Stories</span> (1800), were intended for use in that didactic context. She continued to write fiction such as <span class="italic">The Western Mail</span>, professing to be letters stolen from a postbag, and <span class="italic">Stories for Children</span> (1804). Her <span class="italic">Domestic Management, or, The Healthful Cookery Book</span> was published in the same year. Anne ranged more widely, both in her life and her work.<br>
<br>Anne Plumptre was considerably more than a translator or novelist in a popular vein. Her own writings outnumber her translations, and display independence of mind and personal intrepidity. Her translation of the poet Friedrich Matthisson's popular letters and travels in 1799 was accompanied by her introduction, which shows her critical intervention in an important literary instance. The poet Thomas Gray's correspondence had been bowdlerized by his first editor, Mason, and she translated three letters which clearly showed his homosexual attachment to the young Victor von Bonstetten, a close friend of Matthisson. The letters, and the importance of this attachment, were acknowledged by later editors and biographers of Gray.<br>
<br>In 1802 Anne set off for France in the company of Amelia Opie, who had married the painter John Opie in 1798; both women were friends of the poet Helen Maria Williams, whose <span class="italic">Journals from France</span> were well known. Anne's <span class="italic">A Narrative of a Three Years' Residence in France &hellip; 1802&#150;5</span> (1810) is a substantial work and a serious political enquiry, from the point of view of a first-hand witness, into Napoleon's reign and the attitudes of the French people towards it. It examines the rumours and assumptions circulating in England during the war with France, and attempts to put them right by personal observation and cool assessment of the facts. She deliberately went to the provinces, as offering a truer picture than most recent travellers' experiences, often limited to Paris. She examines specific allegations about Napoleon's &#145;atrocities&#146; and finds them unproven. She also scrutinizes the attitudes of the people towards his government, and finds &#145;speech everywhere in France as free as in England&#146;. She draws a firm political conclusion: the emperor is not such a monster as he is painted, his people by and large support him, and he should be accepted by the British and the rest of Europe as a legitimate ruler. She advocated an initiative of making peace with Napoleon. Her views did not find favour in Britain, but this book is a serious and neglected contribution to the absorbing and variegated literature on Napoleon by writers across Europe.<br>
<br>During her stay in France, Anne uncovered an unusual unpublished manuscript, an account of the plague at Marseilles in 1720, written by an eyewitness and participant, a local doctor, M. Bertrand. Her substantial introduction gives a lively defence of its relevance to the present, relating the vivid description of the plague both to recent outbreaks of disease, especially &#145;last summer's epidemic&#146; of &#145;the yellow fever&#146; in a number of Mediterranean ports, and to the more recent calamities or infections of war and of revolution. She also paints a sympathetic portrait of the brave doctor, with his penchant for literature. She draws attention to the literary quality of his account, giving us a glimpse of her own aesthetic criteria:<blockquote>It is a picture which unites in an eminent degree the qualities most calculated to engage the attention of all readers&#151;the horrible and the pathetic, the interesting, and the instructive:&#151;and the interest here excited is so much stronger than in the most finely wrought work of imagination, inasmuch as we know that it is not over imaginary woe that we now drop the sympathetic tear, but over woes, alas, too real &hellip; (p. xiii)</blockquote>She sought and found further documents in Marseilles and London, and the whole was published in 1805.<br>
<br>Anne also translated travel literature including, between 1803 and 1806, <span class="italic">Travels in Southern Africa</span>, from the German of H. Lichtenstein. This, like her further translations of accounts of travels&#151;<span class="italic">Travels through the Morea, Albania, and other Parts of the Ottoman Empire</span> (1813), from the original by F. C. Pouqueville, and <span class="italic">Voyages and Travels to Brazil, the South Sea, Camscatka, and Japan</span> (1813&#150;14), from the German of Langsdorf&#151;again shows Anne's interest in current politics, in Britain's overseas commitments, in medical matters, and in being imaginatively at the centre of the action. Anne travelled to Ireland in 1814&#150;15, and her <span class="italic">Narrative of a Residence in Ireland</span> (1817) also has political concerns, though more circumspectly veiled by description of daily incident. It was ridiculed in the <span class="italic">Quarterly</span> (vol. 16) by Croker, notorious for his vitriolic conservatism.<br>
<br>Anne and Bell collaborated once more in 1818 in their translation of <span class="italic">Tales of Wonder</span>, taken from a variety of different sources, again finding the vein of contemporary interest in German, just moving into a new phase. Neither ever married; but both, especially Anne, had productive and for the most part successful literary careers. Anne died in Norwich on 20 October 1818. Bell lived on until 1838, dying in Rennes on 18 December.<br>
