<span class="headword">Hodgskin,  Thomas</span>  (1787&#150;1869), <span class="occ">economist, political theorist, and journalist</span>, was born on 12 December 1787 in Chatham, the son of a keeper of stores at the Admiralty docks. He described his childhood as impoverished and joyless. When he reached twelve his father cut short his education and procured him a naval cadetship in March 1800. For the next twelve years he cruised in the North Sea and Mediterranean and along the coasts of Africa. Although he distinguished himself in action Hodgskin found naval discipline irksome and his comrades' company desultory. While at sea he began to read widely, but necessarily unsystematically. Conflicts with his superiors deprived him of the prospect of promotion, and at the age of twenty-five he found himself on the retired list, reduced to half pay in 1812. In his first published work, <span class="italic">An Essay on Naval Discipline</span> (1813), he contrasted the arbitrary brutality of naval life with the good government with which Britain was reputedly blessed. Publication of the <span class="italic">Essay</span> brought Hodgskin to the attention of the London radicals, notably Francis Place, who was to offer Hodgskin intellectual companionship and patronage.<br>
<br>In July 1815 Hodgskin embarked on a walking tour which took him first to Paris and later to Germany, where he made a detailed study of the political and economic institutions of Hanover. Although his investigations were shaped by a questionnaire devised by Jeremy Bentham, his suggestion, in <span class="italic">Travels in the North of Germany</span> (2 vols., 1820), that &#145;many evils are in Germany, occasioned by governing too much&#146; was far from Benthamite. Hodgskin expounded a minimalist conception of the state, insisting that government tended to shackle the energies and liberties of individuals. The guarantor of good government was the influence of public opinion. He concluded that if Britain was better governed than the states of Germany this was principally because of the greater freedom of expression in Britain and because the political education of the working classes had progressed further in Britain than in Germany. By 1819 Hodgskin was in Edinburgh, married to Elisabeth, a young German woman whose surname is unknown. The next few years were marked by excruciating poverty. He failed to break into the charmed circle of the Edinburgh reviewers, and was constantly held back by his painful self-abnegation and the growing radicalism of his opinions. Late in 1822 he arrived back in London and Place secured him a position as a correspondent for the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>.<br>
<br>Respectable journalism gave Hodgskin a regular income, but no outlet for his real opinions. In 1823 he was instrumental in establishing the <span class="italic">Mechanics' Magazine</span> and the mechanics' institute, where in 1825 he delivered a course of lectures later published as <span class="italic">Popular Political Economy</span> (1827). His reputation as an economist rests on these lectures, the trenchant <span class="italic">Labour Defended Against the Claims of Capital</span> (1825), and <span class="italic">The Natural and Artificial Right of Property Contrasted</span> (1832). He has frequently been described as a &#145;Ricardian socialist&#146;, but the description is more ironic than accurate. Certainly Hodgskin used elements from Ricardian economics, but only as tools with which to undermine the Ricardian edifice. At the same time he pressed the labour theory of value to far more radical ends than David Ricardo, seeing skilled labour as both the measure and producer of all value. Fixed capital was no more than accumulated labour. Hodgskin saw a shameless deception at the centre of Ricardian economics and British capitalism: both pretended that capital was productive and the essential spring to greater prosperity, but, Hodgskin argued, capitalists were always parasitic, holding wages close to subsistence levels and diverting the fruits of labour's productivity to unproductive and anti-social consumption. Although Karl Marx's formulation of the theory of surplus value was more sophisticated, his debt to Hodgskin is unmistakable.<br>
<br>Hodgskin fathered seven children, and the need to provide for his family may explain his failure to produce any major work after 1832. He intended to complete a critical study of law, &#145;The absurdity of legislation demonstrated&#146;, but this never appeared. Instead he became a prolific journalist, contributing to at least four daily newspapers, as well as several provincial weeklies; and for a time he assisted Thomas Hansard in publishing parliamentary reports. In the early 1840s he published pamphlets for the Anti-Corn Law League, and in 1846 he joined the staff of <span class="italic">The Economist</span>. In the same year the navy awarded him the rank of retired commander. Hodgskin's enthusiasm for free trade was rooted in a belief that the power of governments would wither as the relationships within society became subject to economic laws rather than arbitrary legal systems. In two lectures in 1857 he attributed crime not to personal depravity but the corrupting tendencies of the law. He died in Feltham, Middlesex, on 21 August 1869 after a short illness. No London newspaper published a notice of his life and work.<br>
