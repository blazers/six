<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Chesterton,  Cecil Edward</span>  (1879&#150;1918), <span class="occ">political journalist</span>, was born on 12 November 1879 at 11 Warwick Gardens, Kensington, London, the second son and youngest child of Edward Chesterton (<i>d</i>. 1922), a retired estate agent, and his wife, Marie Louise, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Grosjean (<i>d</i>. 1933), whose father's family was of Swiss origin. Chesterton's elder brother Gilbert (G. K.) greeted his arrival with the satisfied response that now he would have someone to argue with, and the brothers went on cheerfully arguing throughout their lives, though Cecil had the more sharply polemical temperament. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32392/', "G. K. Chesterton's")</script> <span class="italic">Autobiography</span> describes the comfortable, cultivated, and relaxed home in which they grew up. Like his brother, Cecil Chesterton attended St Paul's School. He was destined to join the family estate agency, and qualified as a surveyor, but by 1901 he had turned to journalism.<br>
<br>A committed socialist, in 1901 Chesterton joined the Fabian Society and in time was elected to the executive committee. He had also met Ada Elizabeth Jones (1869&#150;1962) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39077/', "Chesterton, Ada Elizabeth")</script>], an independent-minded woman several years his senior, who made her living as a journalist, writing under the pseudonym John Keith Prothero. Chesterton fell in love with her and remained so for the rest of his life. She was happy to work with him as a colleague but for a long time refused his offers of marriage. He became increasingly close to Hilaire Belloc, and by 1911 had abandoned socialism in favour of distributism, the doctrine advanced by Belloc and G. K. Chesterton, that sought social justice in the widest possible distribution of personal ownership, with the Catholic peasantry of Europe as a model. Chesterton shared Belloc's disillusionment with the parliamentary system, and the two men collaborated in an attack on it in <span class="italic">The Party System</span>, published in 1911; in the same year Belloc launched a weekly paper, the <span class="italic">Eye-Witness</span>, with Chesterton as assistant editor. In 1912 Chesterton, backed by money from his father, took over the paper. The name was changed to the <span class="italic">New Witness</span> and Ada Jones became assistant editor. Belloc's wife urged Chesterton to become a Roman Catholic, and he did so in June 1912.<br>
<br>Chesterton was a short, pugnacious man, generally regarded as ugly; he was gregarious but aggressive, which made him a difficult companion. He wrote with vigour and clarity, but his polemics were extreme and uncontrolled, and in 1913 led him to the dock of the Old Bailey, charged with criminal libel. This was with respect to the Marconi scandal in which the <span class="italic">New Witness</span> alleged that prominent members of the Liberal government, including the attorney-general, Sir Rufus Isaacs, and the chancellor of the exchequer, David Lloyd George, had engaged in corrupt financial dealings in the shares of the Marconi Company, which was setting up a radio communications system throughout the British empire. The case was brought against Chesterton by Isaacs's brother Godfrey, the financier who headed the company; Chesterton was found guilty and fined &pound;100, which was reckoned to be a light sentence, as he might have been imprisoned. His attack on the Isaacs brothers echoed Belloc's antisemitism, but took it a lot further; in the words of Belloc's biographer, Chesterton was &#145;spittingly, uncontrollably anti-semitic&#146;  (Wilson, 184). Belloc himself thought that Chesterton and the <span class="italic">New Witness</span> went too far, and that in the Marconi affair a good case had been bungled  (Speaight, 311&#150;12).<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in 1914 Chesterton adopted a strongly patriotic stance; early in 1915 he visited the United States to lecture and debate in favour of the allied cause. This American experience prompted his <span class="italic">History of the United States</span>, published posthumously in 1919. It is Chesterton's most enduring book; D. W. Brogan, though acknowledging its errors and omissions, wrote:<blockquote>As a political and military narrative it is a success. The qualities of this book far outweigh its defects &hellip; It is a deeply personal account of the history of a great political experiment written by a man who cared profoundly for politics. (Brogan, xvi)</blockquote>In 1916 Chesterton joined the army, serving first in the East Surrey regiment and then in the Highland light infantry, and in 1917 he and Ada Jones were finally married.<br>
<br>Chesterton was a late victim of the war. Had he survived, his polemical fervour and his nationalistic, racist, and anti-parliamentary attitudes might well have led him towards the ideological extremes of the inter-war years. In the last days of the war he became ill on active service, and on 6 December 1918 he died of nephritis in the military hospital at Wimereux, near Boulogne, France; he was buried soon afterwards in the nearby military cemetery.<br>
