<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jellicoe,  George Patrick John Rushworth</span>, second Earl Jellicoe and Baron Jellicoe of Southampton  (1918&#150;2007), <span class="occ">army officer, politician, and businessman</span>, was born on 4 November 1918 at Holwell House, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34171/', "John Rushworth Jellicoe, Viscount Jellicoe of Scapa, later first Earl Jellicoe (1859&#150;1935)")</script>, naval officer, and his wife, Florence Gwendoline (1877&#150;1964), daughter of Sir Charles Cayzer, founder of the Clan Line shipping firm. Born into a family of national prominence and into a life of privilege, he was conscious from his early years of the expectations and responsibilities this entailed. George V was his godfather, the king and queen regularly stayed with his family on the Isle of Wight for Cowes week, and he was a page of honour at the coronation of George VI. He became Viscount Brocas at the age of seven, when his father was made an earl. He was educated at Winchester College and while still at school inherited his father's earldom. He won an exhibition to Trinity College, Cambridge, and before taking this up spent a year in Germany learning the language with a view to a diplomatic career. At Cambridge he achieved a first in history and&#151;in the vacations&#151;developed an enthusiasm for the Cresta run and for challenging skiing.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 Jellicoe surprised many people by opting for the Coldstream Guards rather than the navy with which his name was so closely associated. He was seconded to a guards commando unit and after training in Scotland saw active service in 1941 in north Africa, where he was wounded while leading a patrol behind enemy lines. In 1942 he was recruited by David Stirling for the newly formed Special Air Service (SAS) and the following year became commander of the Special Boat Squadron (SBS), which was deployed on dangerous sorties against the German-occupied Greek islands. In June 1942 he led a raid on Heraklion airfield on Crete, which was being used by the Germans to harass shipping convoys in the eastern Mediterranean. After being dropped off in rubber boats from a submarine his party cut the perimeter wire around the airfield and when they were challenged by sentries managed to convince the Germans that they were merely drunken Greek peasants. In the event they managed to place time-bombs on some twenty-one German aircraft and a munitions supply dump, eventually escaping to a rendezvous with another submarine. For this escapade Jellicoe was appointed DSO.<br>
<br>Other adventures followed thick and fast. In 1943, after the the Italians had signed an armistice with the allies, he was parachuted into Rhodes to try to persuade the Italian governor to hand the island over to the allies rather than to the Germans. He landed off course and, fearing he would be captured, ate the letter he was carrying from General Maitland Wilson to the Italian commander. When he managed to reach the latter he was frustrated by his lack of the swallowed credentials and the Italian's reluctance to antagonize the 10,000-strong German garrison. This setback did not prevent him from arranging for various other islands to be successfully occupied by British troops. For this operation he was awarded the MC. In the course of his campaigning he was also mentioned three times in dispatches and awarded the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, the Croix de Guerre, and the Greek war cross. When the allied forces were eventually closing in on Athens and the Germans were evacuating the city it was Jellicoe (on a borrowed bicycle) who arrived first in the capital and announced to an ecstatic Greek population that they were liberated. Before demobilization he had reached the rank of colonel, although still only twenty-seven.<br>
<br>Jellicoe married on 23 March 1944 the Shanghai-born Patricia Christine (Patsy) O'Kane (1917&#150;2012) (daughter of Jeremiah O'Kane, marine engineer), whom he had met in Beirut while they were both engaged in sensitive operations; they had two sons, Patrick and Nicholas, and two daughters, Alexandra and Zara. He also made many enduring friendships during his special operations, notably with Patrick Leigh Fermor, who was engaged in activities similar to his own and with whom he remained on close terms until the end of his life.<br>
<br>With the war over Jellicoe achieved his original ambition of joining the foreign service. He served in Washington and Brussels as well as in the northern department of the Foreign Office (responsible for Soviet affairs) in London, and was widely considered (like his Washington colleague Nicko Henderson, later ambassador in Germany, France, and the USA) to be a rising star. However, by the time he was posted to Baghdad as deputy secretary-general of the Baghdad pact his marriage had run into difficulties and he set up house with Philippa Anne Bridge, a highly attractive young divorced woman (the former wife of Christopher Charles Cyprian Bridge, and the daughter of Phillip Rushwell Rendell Dunne, of Gatley Park, Herefordshire) he had met in London in 1955. The Foreign Office felt that this arrangement was not sustainable, and he was offered the choice of parting with Philippa or resigning from the diplomatic service. Without hesitation he chose the latter, although it was to be more than ten years before he obtained a divorce from Patsy and was free to marry Phillipa, which he did on 4 April 1966. They had a son, John, and two daughters, Emma and Daisy.<br>
<br>Long before his second marriage Jellicoe had embarked on a successful new career, this time in politics. He had already demonstrated an interest in political&#151;particularly foreign&#151;affairs with speeches in the House of Lords, and his first appointment, notwithstanding the scandal of his leaving the diplomatic service, was as a lord-in-waiting to the queen. He was promoted as a member of successive Conservative governments through a variety of junior posts until in 1963 he was appointed first lord of the Admiralty, in 1967 deputy leader of the opposition in the House of Lords, and in 1970 lord privy seal, minister for the civil service, and leader of the House of Lords. He played a major part in promoting government legislation in a number of fields including European affairs, industrial relations, public service conditions, and the handling of emergencies. He was widely respected as a prodigiously energetic minister who was popular with politicians and civil servants alike.<br>
<br>Given Jellicoe's steady ascent up the ministerial ladder it came as a serious shock when in 1973 Scotland Yard inquiries into a call-girl ring revealed his name. When questioned by the cabinet office about the accusations, he admitted to having had relations with call-girls, and although there was never any implication that national security had been compromised by his involvements, the simultaneous and more serious allegations&#151;involving drugs and prostitutes&#151;against Lord Lambton, and the vivid recollections of the embarrassment caused by the Profumo affair of a few years before, persuaded the prime minister, Edward Heath, to accept Jellicoe's promptly offered resignation. There were many who felt that his departure from the political scene was unnecessary as well as unfortunate, and there was a general consensus that he had acted honourably in not attempting to hang on to office. But it was now the second time that his promising career in public service had been undone by extra-matrimonial affairs.<br>
<br>Jellicoe immediately embarked on yet another successful career, this time in business. He became, among other things, chairman of Tate and Lyle, the Davy Corporation, and the British Overseas Trade Board, president of the London chamber of commerce and industry, a director of Sothebys, Smiths Industries, Morgan Crucible, and Warburgs Bank, and governor of the Centre for Environmental Studies. In 1995 he became involved with Hakluyt, a confidential intelligence company. He also took on the chancellorship of Southampton University and the presidency of the Royal Geographical Society. All these bodies benefited from his energy and leadership skills. He was appointed KBE in 1986, elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1990, and created a life peer (to enable him to remain a participant in the House of Lords), as Baron Jellicoe of Southampton, in 1999. He remained an active and highly sociable figure until his death. He had always been well off financially. He had bought Tidcombe Manor in Wiltshire soon after he left the diplomatic service, and this estate became a convivial and happy centre for his extended family. He died there on 22 February 2007 of a heart attack. He was survived by his wife, Philippa, their children, and his first family. He was succeeded as third earl by his son Patrick (<i>b</i>. 1950).<br>
<br>A biography of Jellicoe (published by Lorna Windmill in 2005) was entitled <span class="italic">A British Achilles</span>, and made clear that his Achilles heel was his susceptibility to women, to whom he had always been a very attractive figure on account of his dash, humour, and generosity of spirit. But he was also dearly loved by almost all who met him on account of his life-enhancing ebullience. The <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> obituary of Jellicoe described him as &#145;by consensus &hellip; one of the nicest men in public life&#146; and few contemporaries would have disagreed with the verdict.<br>
