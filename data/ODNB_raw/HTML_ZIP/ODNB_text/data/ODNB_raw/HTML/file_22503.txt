<span class="headword">Ponsonby,  William</span>  (1546?&#150;1604), <span class="occ">printer and bookseller</span>, was apprenticed for ten years from 25 December 1560 to William Norton, the printer. He was admitted to the Stationers' Company on 11 January 1571, and in 1577 began business on his own account at the sign of the Bishop's Head in St Paul's Churchyard. He engaged his first apprentice, Paul Linley, on 25 March 1576, and his second, Edward Blount, on 24 June 1578. He registered his first book, the anonymous <span class="italic">Praise and Dispraise of Women</span>, on 17 June 1577, but did not publish it until 1579. What seems to have been his first publication, about 1577, was a sermon of Heinrich Bullinger.<br>
<br>A few political and religious tracts followed in the next five years. In 1582 Ponsonby issued the first part of Robert Greene's romance <span class="italic">Mamillia</span>, and in 1584 the same author's <span class="italic">Gwydonius</span>. At the end of 1586 he sought permission, through Sir Fulke Greville, to publish Sir Philip Sidney's <span class="italic">Arcadia</span>, which was then circulating in manuscript. His proposal was not received with much enthusiasm by Sidney's representatives, but Ponsonby secured a licence for its publication on 23 August 1588, and in 1590 he published it, having edited and rearranged the text. A new issue of 1593, &#145;augmented and ended&#146;, introduced a few changes, but in 1598 Sidney's sister, the countess of Pembroke, by arrangement with Ponsonby, revised the whole and added Sidney's <span class="italic">Defence of Poesie</span>, with his remaining poems.<br>
<br>Ponsonby had entered <span class="italic">The Defence of Poesie</span> on 29 November 1594, and it was printed for him under that title by Thomas Creede in 1595. On 12 April 1595 one Henry Olney entered a manuscript called <span class="italic">An Apologie for Poetrie</span>, and had it printed by James Roberts in the same year. Not until then did the wardens who had licensed both items realize that the two titles referred to the same work. Since Ponsonby's entrance had priority, Olney's was deleted, and the two publishers came to an agreement, whereby Ponsonby apparently bought some or all of Olney's remainders, probably at cost. Several copies survive in which Ponsonby's title page has been substituted for Olney's preliminaries. Ponsonby seems to have been on friendly terms with the countess of Pembroke and in 1592 published her translations of De Mornay's <span class="italic">Life and Death</span> and Garnier's <span class="italic">Antonius</span> in a single volume, reissuing the first piece, the <span class="italic">Life</span>, separately in 1600.<br>
<br>Ponsonby chiefly owes his fame to his association with Spenser. He published ten volumes of Spenser's work, the first three books of <span class="italic">The Faerie Queene</span> appearing in 1590. In 1591 he issued <span class="italic">Complaints</span>, containing various hitherto unpublished pieces by Spenser, prefixed by an address to the reader of his own composition. <span class="italic">The Tears of the Muses</span> and <span class="italic">Daphnaida</span>, also in 1591, were followed by <span class="italic">Amoretti</span> and <span class="italic">Colin Clout's Come Home Again</span> (1595) and, in 1596, the fourth, fifth, and sixth books of <span class="italic">The Faerie Queene</span>, a collected edition of the six books, and two other volumes, respectively entitled <span class="italic">Fowre Hymns</span> and <span class="italic">Prothalamion</span>.<br>
<br>The date of Ponsonby's marriage to Joan, daughter of Francis Coldock and Alice Waterson, is unknown. He was elected to the livery on 6 May 1588, became an assistant exactly nine years later, and served as under-warden in 1598&#150;9. On 15 January 1599 he was one of four assistants made eligible for future election as upper warden even though they had not yet qualified by serving twice as under-warden. Two were excused this second term, one being Ponsonby, for which exemption he had to pay a fine of &pound;5. As it happened, he was never elected upper warden. He last appeared in the Stationers' registers as one of the proprietors of a new edition of Sir Thomas North's great translation of Plutarch, on 5 July 1602.<br>
<br>Ponsonby's will was drawn up on the last day of 1603 and proved on 23 January 1604. On 9 February Simon Waterson, half-brother to widow Joan Ponsonby, was bound in &pound;100 to guarantee that she would prepare an inventory of her husband's estate. After outstanding debts and funeral expenses had been subtracted, the final valuation was &pound;1156 7<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>., of which one third belonged by city custom to Ponsonby's six under-age children, Nathaniel, William, Simon, Joan, Anne, and Alice. The total presumably included whatever Waterson had paid for Ponsonby's chief copyrights, which were transferred to him on 3 September 1604.<br>
