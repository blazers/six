<span class="headword">Bennett, Sir  Thomas Jewell</span>  (1852&#150;1925), <span class="occ">journalist and newspaper proprietor</span>, was born on 16 May 1852, at Elm Road, Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, the son of John Thomas Bennett, solicitor's clerk, and his wife, Charlotte Mary Galopin Chabert. He entered journalism early in life, beginning his apprenticeship on the paper of the Cambridgeshire fenland, the <span class="italic">Isle of Ely and Wisbech Advertiser</span>. After a move to Carlisle his career in provincial journalism peaked when he became assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Western Daily Press</span> in Bristol. This was followed by a stint in Fleet Street working on <span class="italic">The Standard</span> as a leader writer.<br>
<br>As was becoming increasingly common, Bennett journeyed overseas in 1884 to work in the English newspaper press of the empire, proceeding to Bombay, the principal city in western India, where he was to remain for seventeen years. He worked initially for the <span class="italic">Bombay Gazette</span> as associate editor and leader writer for eight years. Henry Curwen, a close personal friend, was the editor of the influential English newspaper the <span class="italic">Times of India</span>, and upon Curwen's death in 1892 Bennett succeeded to the editorship and to Curwen's principal proprietary interest in the paper. At first he ran the paper in partnership with Curwen's business manager, Charles Kane, and after the latter's death in 1894 became its sole proprietor. Bennett was responsible for the consolidation, modernization, and expansion of the paper, making it the premier newspaper publishing house in India. He set up new machinery at the offices, acquired land from the Bombay Improvement Trust, and erected new buildings. More significantly, using his professional connections in England, Bennett strengthened the paper's staff. He brought from London a master printer, F. M. Coleman, and his brother; and the publishing company that they formed, Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co., still operated a century later. He also utilized his Bristol press connections to bring over British writing staff, including Lovat Fraser and Stanley Reed, both of whom subsequently became editors of the paper. His decision to bring across such aggressive, imaginative, and professional journalists was a boon for the development of the newspaper press in India. Fraser (editor, 1901&#150;7) was the leading journalist of his time, winning from the viceroy, Lord Curzon, the assurance that the <span class="italic">Times of India</span> was the first newspaper in Asia. Though Bennett left India in 1901, he continued to guide the fortunes of his company from England. (The company passed into Indian ownership in 1946.)<br>
<br>In directing the policy of his paper, Bennett demonstrated sound and cautious judgement, and his support for the raj was discriminating. While recognizing the gravity of the increasing political unrest in western India which was encouraged by B. G. Tilak, for instance, he was nevertheless alive to the political and economic problems of the Indian community and worked steadfastly for Indian political advancement and to enhance amity between the races. He wrote largely on Indian topics, and championed Indian grievances with regularity and compassion. On leaving India he was presented with an address of thanks by 3000 agricultural workers from Gujarat for the persistence with which he had brought their grievances before the government. He was nominated by the Bombay government as a fellow of Bombay University, but for the most part declined direct participation in the university's affairs in order that he might retain his journalistic independence. Similarly, he only accepted company directorships, for example, of the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway, after his retirement.<br>
<br>Back in Britain, Bennett was a JP for Kent, and in December 1910 unsuccessfully contested the Brigg division of Lincolnshire as a Unionist. He was returned for the Sevenoaks division of Kent in December 1918, and held the seat until December 1923. In parliament he spoke chiefly on Indian issues, and occasionally on domestic, Irish, and African empire affairs. He was a vehement critic of racism in the empire, as was demonstrated by his spirited speech against the racist tenor of the Commons debates in July 1920 on the Hunter committee report into the unrest in India in 1919 and in particular into the massacre of unarmed civilians at Amritsar. Bennett stressed the importance of taking account of the broad interests of India and the feelings and expectations of her people. British rule, he affirmed, was not founded on brute force alone but on sympathy, generosity, and co-operation: &#145;Unless we get the sympathy and goodwill of the people of India our task is ended or will be ended in a short time,&#146; he remarked. Though his reasoned support for the coalition government's censure of General Dyer's action at Amritsar brought him into trouble with the &#145;diehard&#146; element in his constituency, he held his ground and was rewarded when a party meeting expressed its entire confidence in him.<br>
<br>Bennett's aversion to reaction and racism was complemented by his desire for Indian political advancement, and he hoped that even after becoming a self-governing nation India would remain an integral part of the British Commonwealth. Thus he was a warm supporter of the Montagu&#150;Chelmsford reforms of 1919. He spoke vigorously in defence of the <span class="roman">Government of India Bill</span> during its successive readings in the Commons, and served as a member of the joint select committee on the bill, and subsequently on the joint standing committee on India. Outside parliament he continued to work on Indian issues, often contributing to the columns of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Bennett was one of the first back-bench Conservatives to advocate publicly the policy of ending the party's support for the coalition government led by Lloyd George, a policy later adopted at the famous Carlton Club meeting in 1922.<br>
<br>On 1 August 1917 Bennett married the forty-year-old Elena Brooke-Jones, daughter of Thomas Brooke-Jones, mining engineer, of Ferrol, Spain. She was active in the Unionist organization. Bennett was described as a widower at this time, though nothing is known of a former marriage. They made their home at Harwarton House, Speldhurst, Kent, and at 38 Hans Place, London. A member of the Church of England, Bennett represented the diocese of Rochester on the national assembly of the Church of England. In 1902 he had been awarded the silver medal of the Society of Arts for a paper on the British connection with the Persian Gulf, and in 1903 he was made a CIE. He was knighted in 1921. After a period of ill health Sir Thomas Bennett died from heart failure on 16 January 1925 at 38 Hans Place. The funeral was held at Speldhurst church, Kent. His widow, who survived him by more than twenty-five years, served on the national assembly of the Church of England from 1930.<br>
