<span class="headword">Watkin,  William Thompson</span>  (1836&#150;1888), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, born at Salford on 15 October 1836, was the son of John Watkin of Salford. His mother, Mary Hamilton, daughter of Benjamin Brierley, was born at Portsmouth, USA. He received his education at private schools, and afterwards became a merchant in Liverpool, where his family had connections: he was the second cousin of Sir Edward William Watkin (1819&#150;1901), the great railway promoter and entrepreneur. From early life, however, Watkin was very interested in archaeology and particularly in the Roman period in north-west England. From 1884 he was a council member and from 1885 honorary librarian of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire, and also an active council member of the Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian Society from its foundation in 1883.<br>
<br>Watkin was a very prolific writer on archaeological and antiquarian subjects, and published no fewer than 123 books and articles between 1871 and 1888. Most of these were concerned with the Roman occupation, his interests extending beyond the north-west to include Yorkshire and Northumbria, but his most important works were the twin volumes on <span class="italic">Roman Lancashire</span> (1883) and <span class="italic">Roman Cheshire</span> (1886), both of which are still widely used and cited. He was a most careful observer, not given to speculation or assumption, and for this reason his notes and writings are regarded as more reliable and trustworthy than those of most of his contemporaries. Valuable unpublished notes on Roman remains in north Wales and in various English counties and other manuscripts were purchased by subscription after Watkin's death and presented to Chetham's Library, Manchester.<br>
<br>On 6 July 1871 Watkin, who was already a widower, married Amelia Runcorn, a widow, daughter of William Broome, a brick merchant, and in 1872 they had a son, William, but Amelia died shortly afterwards and he then married, on 19 June 1876, Marion Smart, daughter of Henry Beeston, a stationer. With his third wife he had two sons and two daughters. He died on 23 March 1888 at his home, 55 Prescot Street, Liverpool, and was buried at Anfield cemetery. His third wife survived him.<br>
