</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tennant,  Stephen James Napier</span>  (1906&#150;1987), <span class="occ">aesthete</span>, was born on 21 April 1906 at Wilsford Manor, near Amesbury, Wiltshire, the fourth son of Edward Priaulx Tennant, first Baron Glenconner (1859&#150;1920), landowner and member of parliament, and his wife, Pamela Adelaide Genevieve Wyndham (1871&#150;1928), a writer. Of his parents, Tennant was perhaps inevitably more attached to his mother, a romantic &#145;Soul&#146; who would greet visitors to the Glenconners' Scottish baronial pile with her brood arranged about her &#145;in a sort of photographic pose&#146;  (Hoare, 7). But she was more at home at Wilsford Manor, the arts and crafts house she had created in 1906, the year of her youngest son's birth. Wilsford would become an extension of Stephen Tennant's personality, a constant reminder of his childhood in a life which remained essentially childlike. There his mother recorded his baby talk, the flowers speaking his name, &#145;Stephen, Stephen&#146;, as he passed; and acknowledged that &#145;what may be self-centred in later life is prettily cloaked in childhood&#146;  (ibid., 9). It was a sense of idyll destroyed by the death of the Glenconners' eldest son, Edward, a budding poet, in the First World War. Just as the aftermath of war influenced his generation, so Stephen Tennant's later relationship with the war poet Siegfried Sassoon seemed invested with the memory of his dead brother and the world before the war.<br>
<br>Unsuited to formal schooling, Tennant was educated at home, his artistic talent encouraged by Pamela (he later illustrated her compendia <span class="italic">The Vein in the Marble</span>, 1925, and <span class="italic">The White Wallet</span>, 1928). In 1922 he attended the Slade School of Fine Art, where he met the artist Rex Whistler. The two shared a passion for Edgar Allan Poe and P. B. Shelley, but it was through Cecil Beaton's lens that Tennant's flamboyant imagination would create his fantastic self-image. Like his mother before him, Tennant adopted a romantic pose, becoming the visual epitome of the &#145;bright young people&#146;, a largely tabloid press response to post-war aristocratic hedonism. He was photographed by Beaton in his silver-foil bedroom in Smith Square: made up, marcell-waved, and clad in a pinstripe suit with his brother's leather flying jacket over his shoulders, he seemed a parody of a City gentleman and a wartime flying ace, an outrageous simulacrum of the masculinity which the war had sapped. The <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>'s &#145;William Hickey&#146; column, written by Tom Driberg, avidly recorded his party entrances: &#145;The Honourable Stephen Tennant arrived in an electric brougham wearing a football jersey and earrings&#146;  (Hoare, 105).<br>
<br>If the bright young people's antics were essentially infantilist, then Tennant was part Peter Pan, part Dorian Gray&#151;a glittering androgynous figure invested with an almost alien sexuality. He remained inordinately attached both to his mother (who, two years after her first husband's death in 1920, had married Viscount Grey of Fallodon, the former foreign secretary), and to his nanny, Rebecca Trusler. When he half-seriously proposed marriage to Elizabeth Belloc-Lowndes, Tennant stipulated that Nanny should accompany them on their honeymoon. On the deaths of these two controlling influences (Lady Grey in 1928, Trusler a year later), Tennant was left to his life of fantasy. Into the emotional breach stepped <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35953/', "Siegfried Sassoon (1886&#150;1967)")</script>, with whom he had begun a relationship in 1927, and who watched as Tennant's friends&#151;including the incongruous figure of William Walton&#151;were persuaded to act out his eighteenth-century <i>f&ecirc;tes galantes</i> in full costume and make-up on the lawns of Wilsford. &#145;It was very amusing, and they were painted up to the eyes, but I didn't quite like it&#146;, Sassoon wrote in his diary  (Hoare, 92); yet he had become obsessed by their fantastic ringmaster.<br>
<br>&#145;It was a tremendous <i>coup de foudre</i>&#146;, recalled Peter Quennell, &#145;Sassoon was like the worthy vicar of a parish coming to town and meeting this great society beauty&#146;  (Hoare, 132). The pair &#145;honeymooned&#146; in Bavaria, for the health of the now tubercular aesthete, and in Sicily. Tales of Sassoon being sent back to their hotel to fetch Tennant's pearls led Edith Sitwell to dub the pair &#145;the Old Earl and Little Lord Fauntleroy&#146;  (ibid., 132). But Tennant's precarious physical and mental state was a source of real concern, and in 1932 he was sent to the Cassel Hospital at Penshurst in Kent, where he received psychoanalysis and where Sassoon attempted to direct his friend's treatment with the help of Sir Henry Head. But Tennant was growing tired of Sassoon's attentions, and, dismissing his lover, returned to Wilsford alone.<br>
<br>Tennant now began a period of restlessness. He travelled to the south of France searching for passion and inspiration in the Vieux Port of Marseilles, where he sketched <i>matelots</i> for his putative masterpiece, <span class="italic">Lascar: a Story of the Maritime Boulevards</span>, &#145;a restless glittering book, about men who have no homes&#146;  (Culme, 16). He received encouragement from Virginia Woolf, E. M. Forster (a particular and loyal friend), Elizabeth Bowen, Rosamond Lehmann, and, most notably (for the contrast it presented), his beloved friend, the American writer Willa Cather; but as Cather told him, &#145;Nobody ever wrote a masterpiece by resolving to do so&#146;  (ibid., 172). Cyril Connolly was less forgiving: &#145;Essentially he is an adolescent exhibitionist acting out the role of grand <i>&eacute;crivain m&eacute;connu</i>&#146;  (Hoare, 298). Constantly rewritten in jewel-coloured inks, <span class="italic">Lascar</span> remained unpublished. Yet Nancy Mitford could not resist putting Tennant in her own novel <span class="italic">Love in a Cold Climate</span> (1949) as the character Cedric Hampton, who drives the tyrannical Uncle Matthew to an insane rage when encountered by the station bookstall dressed in a suit edged in contrasting colours, for which crime he is shaken &#145;like a rat&#146;. &#145;You'd never think&#146;, as Cedric said afterwards, &#145;that buying <span class="italic">Vogue Magazine</span> could be so dangerous. It was well worth it though, lovely Spring modes&#146;  (ibid., 281).<br>
<br>During the Second World War Tennant retreated to a flat in Bournemouth when Wilsford was taken over by the Red Cross. Although he wrote a cogent preface, &#145;The room beyond&#146;, to Cather's <span class="italic">On Writing</span> (1947), his depressive state had by now deteriorated to the extent that he received electroconvulsive therapy and insulin coma treatment at clinics in Scotland and Middlesex. He returned to Wilsford exhibiting what V. S. Naipaul, his later tenant, diagnosed as &#145;accidie&#146;  (Hoare, 361).<br>
<br>Tennant now obsessively redecorated his childhood home, covering the Syrie Maugham d&eacute;cor of the 1930s with flock and velvet and littering the floors with paintings and letters like confetti; he turned the grounds into an English C&ocirc;te d'Azur with sand, palms, and tropical lizards. Here, at Wilsford, he held court to guests brought by Beaton to visit this &#145;last professional beauty&#146;, as Osbert Sitwell had called him  (Hoare, 337); Truman Capote complained of being served soup with candied violets in it, and Christopher Isherwood, having been subjected to a particularly intense session of poetic reverie, told Beaton, &#145;That kind of talk scares the shit out of me.&#146; But for a new generation Tennant acquired a certain mythic status: David Hockney, Patrick Procktor, and Kenneth Anger came to pay homage, and Philip Core wrote that Tennant's &#145;mania for tinselled detritus&#146; had anticipated &#145;the amphetamine glitter taste of the 1960s&#146;  (Core, 177); Caroline Blackwood could compare him only to the rock star David Bowie. Wreathed in his own legend, Tennant had become the stuff of footnotes and anecdotes, as the painter Michael Wishart described him, &#145;resembling a rainbow, exquisite and rarely seen &hellip; Stephen's unique beauty still hung around him like an old-timer at the stage door, hoping for employment&#146;  (Wishart, 164&#150;5). When the present writer visited Tennant at Wilsford in 1986, the house had remained largely untouched since the war, filled with Venetian gilt mirrors, rare animal skins, straw hats, and, perhaps, its occupant's portrait in the attic. With his long hennaed hair and turquoise rings on elegant hands, Tennant himself resembled an exotic Edwardian hostess who had somehow survived into a modern age.<br>
<br>On 28 February 1987 Tennant's languid reign at Wilsford came to an end with his death there; and on 4 March his ashes were interred in the neighbouring churchyard at St Michael's, Wilsford-cum-Lake, where his mother had been buried. The following October the three-day auction of his house and contents propelled Tennant into the spotlight once more. For all his self-obsession, there was yet something innocent and wonderful about Stephen Tennant: he had dedicated himself to a life as art, and in that unique creation he undoubtedly succeeded.<br>
