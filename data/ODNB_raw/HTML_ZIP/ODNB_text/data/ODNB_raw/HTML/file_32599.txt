<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cowper,  Francis Thomas de Grey</span>, seventh Earl Cowper  (1834&#150;1905), <span class="occ">politician and landowner</span>, was born on 11 June 1834 in Berkeley Square, London. Styled Viscount Fordwich until he succeeded to his father's title, he was the eldest in the family of two sons and four daughters of George Augustus Frederick Cowper, sixth Earl Cowper (1806&#150;1856), and his wife, Anne Florence (1806&#150;1880), elder daughter and coheiress of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11565/', "Thomas Philip de Grey, second Earl De Grey and fifth Baron Lucas (1781&#150;1859)")</script>. Based at Panshanger in Hertfordshire, Cowper was born into a family of great wealth at the centre of the whig political, social, and familial cousinhood. His paternal grandmother had one prime minister, William, second Viscount Melbourne, for a brother and another, Viscount Palmerston, as her second husband. On her death in 1869, Cowper inherited the neighbouring Hertfordshire estate of Brocket, along with other properties in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. On his mother's death, he came into the house and estate of Wrest, near Ampthill in Bedfordshire, as well as property in Lancashire and London. In middle life, Cowper was one of the wealthiest landowners in England with four country houses and a town house in St James's Square. Local county responsibilities were discharged during the autumn along with the holding of large house parties at Panshanger or Wrest, the spring was usually spent in London or abroad, while the summer months were taken up from late July by long spells in the highlands, first at Cluny near Inverness, and later at Torloisk, Isle of Mull.<br>
<br>Cowper's father, the sixth earl, was whig MP for Canterbury (1830&#150;34) and lord lieutenant for Kent from 1836 until his death. More influential on her son was Cowper's mother, a strong evangelical tory despite her marriage, who retained powerful personal links with all of her children, managing Cowper's life until his own marriage. Cowper was also close to his siblings, and all were painted by Leighton about 1861&#150;2. On the death of both his sister and brother-in-law in 1870 he became effectively the adoptive father of Ethel (Ettie) Fane, later Grenfell (Lady Desborough).<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlypoliticalcareer"></a>Education and early political career</h2>Cowper was educated first at preparatory school in Bembridge, Isle of Wight, and from September 1847 at Harrow School, at which he was unhappy and from which he was withdrawn at Easter 1849. He continued his education privately, until 1851 when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford, where he enjoyed the life of the aristocratic undergraduate, making friends in particular with William, eighth marquess of Lothian, whose brother, Walter, later married Cowper's sister, Amabel (1846&#150;1906), and William, Lord Valletort (later fourth earl of Mount Edgcumbe). He toured Italy from late 1854, acquiring an interest in Florentine and Venetian painting, before returning home and deciding to submit for a degree in law and history, securing first-class honours in 1855. He had little interest in games, although later acquired a passion for stalking and shooting. Reading was his favourite pastime.<br>
<br>Entry to the Commons was frustrated by the death of Cowper's father on 15 April 1856, which also prompted a mental breakdown. Cowper was always to regret that he was thereby denied the conventional political apprenticeship to a public career for a man in his position. This combined with an already discernible shyness, and a lack of motivating energy, confined Cowper to largely local affairs and social life for the next twenty years. An early enthusiast for the volunteer movement, he took a continuing interest in home defence. He became lord lieutenant for Bedfordshire in 1861, and was made a KG in 1865. At this time, in the words of his wife and later biographer, his friendship with Louise, duchess of Manchester (wife of William, seventh duke, and later on his death, duchess of Devonshire, wife of Spencer Compton, eighth duke), became &#145;a very intimate one&#146;. On 25 October 1870 Cowper married Katrine Cecilia (1845&#150;1913), eldest daughter of William Compton, fourth marquess of Northampton, and Eliza, third daughter of Admiral the Hon. Sir George Elliot. Family tradition has it that Cowper was speeded in his proposal of marriage by rumours of an arranged connection between himself and Princess Louise, fourth daughter of Queen Victoria. The marriage was a happy one, with Katrine, an energetically sporting and Christian woman with artistic and literary interests, providing much of the backbone to Cowper's political and social life, as well as supporting him during his periods of chronic illness. There were no children.<br>
<br>During this period, Cowper was taken up with the ornate restoration of Panshanger (badly damaged by fire in 1855), in what Pevsner later called &#145;a grand rather pompous Neo-Italian style&#146;, and with the custody of its large collection of English portraits, Italian old master paintings, furniture, and porcelain. He purchased a <span class="italic">Madonna and Child</span> by Titian in 1874 (now in the Thyssen collection), and was himself painted by Watts in 1872, while Katrine was painted first by Edward Clofford and later by Poynter. Between 1871 and 1873 he built an additional seat, Beauvale Lodge, on his Nottinghamshire property, with Edward Godwin as architect. As the patron of eighteen livings, he supported the rebuilding of the churches at Hertingfordbury and at Hertford, and paid for a new church at Eastwood, near Beauvale. Although not sharing the intense evangelicalism of his mother or the religious commitments of his wife, Cowper was a responsible patron and continued to urge more effective episcopal disciplines upon indolent or incompetent clergy.<br>
<br>Throughout his life, Cowper was very conscious of his whig pedigree, and in 1866 in an anonymous letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> reaffirmed the whig tradition as that of the aristocratic support for extended individual political rights and moderate institutional reform. Disparaging ideas of fusion with moderate toryism, he urged his colleagues to accept the future leadership of W. E. Gladstone, whose background and experience he saw as leading him not to take &#145;a merely utilitarian view of politics&#146;  (Cowper, 139). He was not given office by Gladstone in 1868, but in April 1871 became a captain of the gentleman-at-arms, a court post coupled with being government spokesman in the House of Lords on Board of Trade matters. It was not a successful appointment. Cowper found the parliamentary routine irksome and the officials uncooperative, and he resigned in August 1873 on not being promoted to under-secretary. Despite political ambition, Cowper did not anticipate any further political opportunities.<h2>
<a name="LordlieutenantofIreland"></a>Lord lieutenant of Ireland</h2>With Gladstone's return to office in 1880, Cowper was surprised to be offered the lord lieutenancy of Ireland. Despite his being, in Lord Spencer's words, &#145;more indolent than most men of his ability&#146;  (Spencer to Gladstone, 18 Sept 1880, BL, Add. MS 44308, fol. 42), Katrine persuaded him to accept. Noted by Lord Derby as &#145;a respectable but rather weak selection&#146;  (Political journal of the fifteenth earl of Derby, 30 April 1880, Derby MSS, Lpool RO), Cowper was not Gladstone's first choice&#151;Lord Carlingford refused the post when offered it, because it was not linked to a seat in the cabinet, a position already assigned to the incoming chief secretary, W. E. Forster. It was seen by the Cowpers as an important political opportunity. For Gladstone, already short of very wealthy whig peers to take on these viceregal roles, it promised a balanced executive in Dublin. Cowper was formally sworn in on 5 May.<br>
<br>Cowper's period of office lasted until late April 1882 and did not prove to be the first chapter of a serious political career. In later life, both Cowpers were inclined to attribute this to the exclusive dominance established by Forster over all aspects of Irish government in both London and Dublin, which left Cowper with little independent authority. In fact, the explanation was more complex, involving a combination of bad luck, the severe challenges posed by the government of Ireland, as well as the temperamental differences between the two men.<br>
<br>Cowper made his state entry into Dublin on 27 May 1880. In T. H. Burke, under-secretary, he found a powerful and experienced official, and by early July 1880 Cowper was already commenting on how little he had to do. From mid-July until 20 September 1880 he was out of Ireland, owing to the death of his mother. He expressed whiggish anxieties over the <span class="roman">Compensation for Disturbance Bill</span>, and did not regret its defeat in the House of Lords on 3 August.<br>
<br>During the following autumn, Cowper supported the coercion measures to deal with rural crime in Ireland, but was already regarded by some leading Liberals as a cipher. Spencer urged him to become more energetically involved in the work of Dublin Castle, especially while Forster was in London. Perhaps as a result, Cowper prepared a vigorous cabinet memorandum on 28 December, which urged the banning of the Land League in addition to the suspension of habeas corpus and arms control, advice which went beyond that recommended by Forster, and which was not followed by the cabinet in its decisions on 30 December 1880.<br>
<br>The early months of the new year were largely taken up by the Dublin season, a social routine which Cowper found tedious, making him homesick. In executive matters, he continued to follow Burke's advice, becoming frustrated at the government's caution over its arrest of suspects, notably Father Sheehy. He supported the government's Irish land legislation, but contributed little to the discussions which led to Parnell's arrest and the proclamation of the Land League in the autumn.<br>
<br>Cowper increasingly found his position untenable. Forster, whom he found overbearing, had tried unsuccessfully to secure his removal in the previous May, and the Cowpers were anticipating retirement from September 1881. Thereafter, they largely restricted themselves to ceremonial duties, making a tour of Ulster in November, although privately they encouraged the landlord class in their attempts to develop a self-defence organization. On 28 December 1881 Cowper suggested to Gladstone that he step down within a few months, adding that he would want to do this at a time which would &#145;not give the impression of deserting in the middle of a battle, or of having been asked to retire from incompetence&#146;  (Cowper, 545). Gladstone agreed to Cowper's request, and by early April 1882, Spencer was reluctantly anticipating a return to Dublin in his place. For a few days there was some doubt about the timing of the change, with Cowper commenting to his brother that he saw no immediate prospect of escaping from &#145;this vile place&#146;  (ibid., 565). Then, a few days later, a possibly designedly tactless suggestion from Forster&#151;that Cowper might take &#145;long leave&#146;  (ibid., 566)&#151;brought matters to a head. Cowper demanded Gladstone bring forward his retirement, a development quickly leaked to the press. He resigned in a letter to the queen on 28 April. Although formally still in office, Cowper was kept completely in the dark about the final stages of the negotiations with Parnell and his colleagues, and on 2 May he initially resisted signing the papers releasing the Kilmainham prisoners. He also made it clear that he disapproved of the engagement entered into with Parnell, largely on the same grounds as had forced Forster's own resignation. The Cowpers left Dublin on 4 May. Much later Lady Cowper claimed that their decision owed more to Forster's attitude than they had admitted at the time. Their experience led Cowper to support the abolition of the viceroyalty in January 1886.<h2>
<a name="Thewhiggrandee"></a>The whig grandee</h2>Cowper never again seriously sought political office, adopting for the rest of his life a senatorial role in national politics as a whig grandee. He contributed a number of articles to the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span> at the request of James Knowles, the editor, during the years of political crisis of 1884&#150;6. In these he urged what he regarded as the traditional virtues of whiggery, in its historic role as the moderating influence within the Liberal Party. As in 1866, he did not support fusion between moderate whigs and tories. Like his whig leader, Hartington, he rejected Gladstone's declaration for home rule, and presided at the first great unionist meeting at Her Majesty's Theatre on 14 April 1886. Despite the bitterness of the Liberal Party's divisions over home rule, Cowper only slowly accepted that they were likely to become permanent. Keen to preside over the royal commission on the 1881 and 1885 Irish land legislation, Cowper was disappointed that the second Salisbury government did not, at first, accept all of his report's conciliatory recommendations. Later, Liberal Unionist pressure during the debates on the 1887 <span class="roman">Irish Land Bill</span> resulted in the commission's recommendations on rent adjudication and the rights of leaseholders being accepted. Cowper continued to advocate a pragmatic approach to state interference on welfare questions, and remained a convinced free trader until the end of his life.<br>
<br>In the years after 1886, Cowper suffered from chronic ill health but continued to be modestly involved in public life. He presided over the Gresham commission in 1893 charged with drafting a new constitution for the University of London. He was an early member of the newly formed Hertfordshire county council, being its chairman from 1891 to 1899. A continuing enthusiast for home defence, he was president of the Naval Volunteer Defence Association, and later entered the debate over the value of rifle clubs. He was a keen supporter of the Sunday opening of national museums and galleries.<br>
<br>For the most part the Cowpers' routine was a social one, of some historical significance in its own right, as their house at Panshanger became one of the meeting grounds for the group known from the late 1880s as the Souls which included A. J. Balfour, George Wyndham, and the young Curzon among its men, and Margot Tennant, Mary Elcho, Evelyn de Vesci, and Cowper's own niece, Ettie Grenfell, among its women. Here in a self-consciously exclusive atmosphere of high living, fine sympathies, and cultivated conversation, relationships and liaisons were nurtured, and in ways thought less vulgarly physical than in the circle around the prince of Wales. Party political divisions were not critical in deciding who should receive the Cowpers' hospitality, and literary and artistic persons were also invited. The Cowpers' own artistic tastes were, like those of the Souls, not avant-garde; both rejected realism in art, drama, and literature, as represented by Millet, Zola, or Ibsen, with Cowper paying &pound;2000 for Burne-Jones's <span class="italic">Aurora</span> in 1898. Similarly, they remained essentially mid-Victorian in their views about the roles of men and women, regretting the decline in &#145;reserve&#146; among women and opposing their increasingly public role.<br>
<br>A handsome man 6 feet tall with a firm profile in adult life, Cowper was described by Edmund Gosse as<blockquote>The very type, and probably the last example, of the old class of sheltered, refined, exquisitely proud Whig noblemen, exalted by wealth and station above the faintest fear of rebuff, and happy to be a Liberal because he saw human nature through rose-coloured glasses from a great distance. (Ellernberger, 30)</blockquote>In the last years of his life, Cowper was confined to a bath chair. On 25 June 1905 he was taken seriously ill with an abdominal abscess, and failing to recover from the necessary operation, he died at Panshanger on 19 July 1905. He was buried in Hertingfordbury churchyard and a recumbent effigy by Henry Poole was erected by his widow in 1909. She died at Cannes on 23 March 1913 and was buried beside him. Since he had no direct heir, Cowper's estates were divided at his death, the bulk, including Panshanger, going eventually to his niece, Ettie Desborough.<br>
