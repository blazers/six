<span class="headword">Livesey,  Roger</span>  (1906&#150;1976), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 25 June 1906 at 138 Holton Road, Barry, south Wales, the son of Joseph Livesey and his wife, Mary Catherine Edwards. His father, known as Sam, was an actor, and the young Roger Livesey was to make his first stage appearance at the age of seven, alongside his father, as an office boy in <span class="italic">Loyalty</span> at the St James's Theatre. Educated in London, he attended the Westminster City School and the Italia Conti School, which prepared its pupils for a career in the theatre, and between 1920 and 1926 he was playing juvenile roles in the West End theatre, including an appearance at the Aldwych Theatre in a farce by Ben Travers. This was followed by a period of touring in the West Indies and South Africa, where he played two seasons. On his return he appeared in a cast which included John Gielgud in the try-out of Ronald MacKenzie's <span class="italic">Musical Chairs</span>, subsequently taking over a role in the play from his brother Jack in 1932. Further association with Gielgud, in the try-out of <span class="italic">Richard of Bordeaux</span> by Gordon Daviot, brought him to the attention of Harcourt Williams, who engaged him for a season at the Old Vic Theatre; from September 1932 to May 1934 he stayed a member of the Old Vic Company, where the most eminent actors of the day appeared in Shakespearian and other roles. Under the direction of Tyrone Guthrie he played the Duke in <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span> (with Flora Robson as Isabella), and Caliban (with Charles Laughton as Prospero) in <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>. William Congreve's <span class="italic">Love for Love</span> saw him appearing in a cast which included his brother as well as his father.<br>
<br>By now established as a promising young actor whose rugged good looks seemed to conceal a shrewd, humorous intelligence, Livesey was rarely out of work, and he tackled demanding roles both on stage and, a little later, in film. He continued to make appearances on the Old Vic and West End stages during the early years of the war, before making a tour of the Middle and Far East for ENSA (the Entertainments National Service Association, the wartime agency which brought performances to serving troops). He starred in a number of films by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, giving a sympathetic portrayal of the seemingly blinkered military mind in <span class="italic">The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp</span> (1943), as well as playing major roles in <span class="italic">I know where I'm going</span> (1945) and <span class="italic">A Matter of Life and Death</span> (1946), the film selected for the first royal command film performance in 1946. During and after the war he appeared in a number of plays with his wife, Ursula Jeans (who predeceased him in 1973), and when the Old Vic reopened in 1953 they were both members of the company. They appeared together in <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span>, <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>, and George Bernard Shaw's <span class="italic">Captain Brassbound's Conversion</span>, and they toured Australia and New Zealand together between 1956 and 1958 in West End successes including William Douglas Home's <span class="italic">The Reluctant Debutante</span>.<br>
<br>On television Livesey appeared in Terence Rattigan's <span class="italic">The Winslow Boy</span>, Jean Giraudoux's <span class="italic">Amphitryon 38</span>, Ibsen's <span class="italic">The Master Builder</span>, and D&uuml;rrenmatt's <span class="italic">The Physicists</span>; he also played Archie Rice's father in John Osborne's <span class="italic">The Entertainer</span> (in the film version of which he played the same part) and the Duke of St Bungay in the BBC serialization of Trollope's novels presented under the title <span class="italic">The Pallisers</span>. By the 1960s his appearance and husky voice were used to advantage in a number of elderly roles, including Captain Shotover in Shaw's <span class="italic">Heartbreak House</span> (which transferred from the Oxford Playhouse to Wyndham's Theatre in 1961), Chebutykin in Chekhov's <span class="italic">The Three Sisters</span> (Oxford Playhouse, 1964), and the earl of Caversham in Oscar Wilde's <span class="italic">An Ideal Husband</span> (1965). In 1969 he doubled as the First Player and the Gravedigger in a production of <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> which opened at the Round House in London in 1969 and was presented at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater, New York, later in the same year. He toured South Africa in 1970. He died in the General Hospital, Watford, on 4 February 1976.<br>
