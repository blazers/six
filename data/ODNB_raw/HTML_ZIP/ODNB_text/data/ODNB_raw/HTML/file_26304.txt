<span class="headword">Stapleton, Sir  Philip</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1603, <em>d.</em> 1647), <span class="occ">politician and army officer</span>, was baptized at Wighill, Yorkshire, on 26 April 1603, the second son of Henry Stapleton of Wighill (1574&#150;1631), esquire, and his wife, Mary Shepherd (<i>d</i>. 1655), the illegitimate daughter of Sir John Forster of Alnwick, Northumberland. He matriculated from Queens' College, Cambridge, on 16 May 1617 and was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1620. He inherited an estate worth &pound;500 per year, and Clarendon noted how he &#145;according to the education of that country, spent his time in those delights which horses and dogs administer&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 1.393). At Scorborough, near Beverley, on 8 October 1629, he married Frances (<i>c</i>.1613&#150;1636), the widow of John Gee of Bishop Burton and the eldest daughter of Sir John Hotham of Scorborough, bt. Shortly afterwards he purchased the estate at Warter Priory and in 1636 he bought a further 400 acres from Dame Mary Bethell at nearby Blanch on the Wolds. He was knighted on 25 May 1630, and served as a JP and a member of the East Riding sewers commission. His wife died in May 1636 and on 5 February 1638 he married again, at St Ann Blackfriars in London; his second wife was the Roman Catholic Barbara, daughter of Henry Lennard, twelfth Lord Dacre of Herstmonceux, Sussex.<br>
<br>Stapleton was elected MP for Hedon in the Short Parliament and in June 1640 signed the petition of the Yorkshire gentry against the forced billeting of royal soldiers in the county. He was returned as MP for Boroughbridge in the Long Parliament and helped John Pym frame the charges against Strafford and abolish the council of the north. He was also appointed to a committee investigating the army plot in May 1641. He resided in London to attend parliamentary business and bought a house near St Ann Blackfriars. On 20 August 1641 he was chosen, along with John Hampden, to attend the king in Scotland. Clarendon believed his activism was procured by Sir Hugh Cholmley and his former father-in-law, Sir John Hotham, &#145;being much younger than they and governed by them&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 1.393). Stapleton returned in time for the debates on the grand remonstrance during November 1641. In January 1642 he and Hotham were among the four members chosen by the House of Commons to deliver their answer to the king's demand for the arrest of the five members, and he was among the committee of twenty-five appointed to sit in the Guildhall during the adjournment of the house.<br>
<br>Early in May 1642 Stapleton was among the five parliamentary commissioners sent to report on the king's actions at York. He returned to London in June but Sir John Hotham, parliament's governor of Hull, requested his return and assistance to rally support in the county. After his appointment to the committee of safety on 4 July, Stapleton accompanied the earl of Holland northwards to present parliament's petition for peace to the king at Beverley on 16 July. He reported that the king had &#145;noe foot&#146; and that Yorkshire's trained bands would only fight &#145;faintly&#146; for him  (Russell, 518). On his return he was commissioned as captain of the earl of Essex's life guard of gentlemen cuirassiers, and colonel of the lord-general's regiment of horse. He was given leave by the House of Commons to accompany Essex's army on 8 September. Stapleton's troopers helped save parliament's army by completing the rout of the king's infantry at the battle of Edgehill on 23 October 1642. Despite his appointments to the East Riding committees of sequestrations on 27 March 1643 and of levying money on 7 May 1643, he remained in the southern counties where he rallied the defeated parliamentarian cavalry at Chalgrove Field on 18 June 1643. During the first battle of Newbury he had a brief confrontation with Rupert in which he tried to shoot the prince with a pistol. After his appointment on 16 February 1644, he regularly attended the committee of both kingdoms, set up as a joint executive by parliament and the Scottish regime. In July 1644 Essex sent him to London to give a military report and he thereby avoided participation in the catastrophe that befell Essex's army in Cornwall.<br>
<br>Stapleton was a close friend of Essex and was believed to represent the earl's views in the House of Commons. Despite his impressive war service, he grew more inclined to the &#145;peace party&#146; desires for a negotiated settlement. From 30 November 1644 he defended Sir John Hotham, who had been arrested for conspiracy to betray Hull, Beverley, and Lincoln to the royalists. In early December Essex invited Stapleton to his house in the Strand to devise a plan to ruin Cromwell by having him indicted as an incendiary. Stapleton strongly objected to the self-denying ordinance, which deprived him of his military command. Some time in 1646 he moved to St Martin's Lane, near Covent Garden. Included in a group of parliamentarian gentry with &#145;Calvinist sympathies&#146;  (Cliffe, <span class="italic">Yorkshire Gentry</span>, 346), on 11 April 1646 he joined Denzil Holles as tellers for the noes in the debate over whether a petition from presbyterian clergy was breaching the privileges of parliament. By now he and Holles enjoyed considerable influence as leaders of the &#145;presbyterian&#146; MPs, both acting regularly as tellers against political Independents in the Commons.<br>
<br>After the first civil war Stapleton was influential with the Scottish commissioners, who relied on him to rally support against the Independents and New Model Army. Baillie recalled that:<blockquote>Stapleton and Holles &hellip; had been the main persuaders of us to remove out of England and leave the king to them, upon assurance, which was most likely, that this was the only means to get the evill army disbanded, the king and peace settled according to our minds. (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, ed. D. Laing, 3 vols., 1841&#150;2, 3.16)</blockquote>His involvement in anti-army propaganda and his activism in advocating the army's disbandment ahead of satisfactory arrangements for settling its pay arrears or dealing with other grievances aroused hostility from Fairfax and Cromwell. He attracted further animosity from the army by assaulting Major Tulidah who presented an army petition which parliament desired to suppress. The army secretary, John Rushworth, called Stapleton an incendiary and noted on 9 June 1647 that &#145;if they had the King, I mean Hollis and Stapleton, &amp;c., the Scots had come in to have crushed this army&#146;  (R. Bell, ed., <span class="italic">Memorials of the Civil War</span>, 2 vols., 1849, 1.353). Stapleton was among the eleven MPs impeached by Sir Thomas Fairfax in the name of the army on 16 June. They were accused of incensing parliament against the army, endeavouring to provoke another civil war, and obstructing the relief of Ireland. Cromwell allegedly reflected shortly after: &#145;What a sway Stapleton and Holles had heretofore in the kingdom&#146;, adding, according to Major Huntingdon, that &#145;he was as able to govern the kingdom as either of them&#146;  (F. Maseres, ed., <span class="italic">Select Tracts Relating to the Civil Wars in England</span>, 2 vols., 1815, 2.405).<br>
<br>The eleven members withdrew from the house rather than face impeachment. On 20 July passes were issued permitting their departure overseas but, heartened by the anti-army riots in London on 26 July, Stapleton returned to parliament. On 3 August Fairfax declared that he wanted Stapleton handed over to him to stand trial. On 6 August the resistance of the City collapsed and Stapleton fled with five of the other impeached members. On 14 August they boarded a ship on the Essex coast bound for Calais, but were overtaken and captured by a Captain Lamming. Vice-Admiral Batten subsequently allowed their release and they landed at Calais on 17 August. Feverish and suffering from flux, Stapleton died at Calais in an inn called the Three Silver Lions on 18 August. As his illness was suspected to be plague he was buried immediately in the protestant burial-ground.<br>
<br>After his death, Stapleton was said to have been &#145;a true and zealous Protestant, though not in any way new-fangled&#146;  (Chetwynd-Stapylton, 459). A puritan chronicler later wrote of him that he was &#145;a Brave Man who Espoused not the Professors of Religion as such, though he sheltered and laid out his Interest for them&#146;  (Morrice MSS, vol. 3). A friend, probably Denzil Holles, recalled &#145;Sir Philip was of a thin body and weak constitution, but full of spirit &hellip; quick of apprehension, sound of judgement, of clear and good elocution&#146;  (Chetwynd-Stapylton, 459). Stapleton fathered ten children&#151;five from each of his marriages&#151;seven of whom survived him. Despite his moderate landed estate he left a fortune of &pound;1000 to each of his three surviving daughters in his will. His wife, Barbara, also outlived him; his eldest son, John (<i>c</i>.1630&#150;1697), succeeded to his lands at Blanch and the manor of Warter.<br>
