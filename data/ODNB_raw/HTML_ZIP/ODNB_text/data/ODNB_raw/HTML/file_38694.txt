<span class="headword">Colman family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1814&#150;1898), <span class="occ">mustard and starch manufacturers</span>, traced its origins in that trade to <a name="cosubject_38696"></a><span class="headword">Jeremiah Colman</span>  (1777&#150;1851), originally a <span class="occ">flour miller</span> at Bawburgh, who in 1814 purchased the flour and mustard making concern of Edward Ames at Stoke Holy Cross, near Norwich, Norfolk. On 15 November 1802 Jeremiah married Ann, daughter of Thomas Theobold, textile manufacturer; their childless marriage led to their adoption, about 1806, of their nephew <a name="cosubject_38695"></a><span class="headword">James Colman</span>  (1801&#150;1854)<span class="occ"></span>. Born on 18 November 1801, James was the eldest of fifteen children of Robert Colman (1775&#150;1867), a dairy and turkey farmer of Rockland St Andrew, Norfolk, and his wife, Ann Mills. James was taken into partnership with Jeremiah in 1823. On 1 August 1826 James married Mary (1805&#150;1898), daughter of John Burlingham, a Norfolk miller and seed merchant. They had two children, the eldest being <a name="cosubject_38694"></a><span class="headword">Jeremiah James Colman</span>  (1830&#150;1898), born on 14 June 1830 at Stoke Holy Cross. Little is known about the education of either the elder Jeremiah or James. They were committed Baptists, upheld liberal principles, and campaigned for civil and religious liberties and free trade. The elder Jeremiah was a founder member of the committee of a local Lancastrian school, was elected to the first board of guardians, and initiated the Stoke Holy Cross New Benefit Society and the politically progressive <span class="italic">Norfolk News</span> in 1846. He served as sheriff of Norwich in 1845&#150;6 and became mayor the following year, filling the offices occupied later by James and his son, Jeremiah James. The elder Jeremiah's move to Norwich in 1841 in effect left James in charge of the mustard-making business of J. and J. Colman at Stoke. The death of Jeremiah at Newmarket Road, Heigham, Norwich, on 3 December 1851, led to the partnership's being extended to include Jeremiah James. Three years later James died, on 19 October 1854, at 8 Marine Parade, Lowestoft, from the cumulative effect of many wearisome years as a commercial traveller and his exertions in expanding the business. The workforce had grown from fewer than fifty workers in the 1830s to about 500 by the late 1850s.<br>
<br>As the business expanded the partnership was extended to include two of James's brothers, Henry Jeremiah (1814&#150;1895) and Edward Colman (1808&#150;1874), whose London agency, which they had established independently, became part of the J. and J. Colman organization in 1844. James's death, however, left Jeremiah James as the sole manager of the Stoke business at the age of twenty-four. The most formative influences on Jeremiah James were the Colman family traditions of liberalism and nonconformity and the belief which his parents expressed in the importance of applying the principles of both to life and labour. His early education at the Poringland Mill School of Samuel Colman, an uncle, and then at a small dame-school was followed by private tuition in Norwich under John Doman, Samuel Colman's brother-in-law. Further education continued through membership of the Norwich Young Men's Mutual Improvement Society, a group whose members met to write, read, and discuss religious, moral, political, and social issues. He was a teaching member of St Mary's Baptist Chapel in Norwich from the 1850s, where he was deacon between 1861 and 1870.<br>
<br>Devout and serious in his approach to life, Jeremiah James was also a somewhat reluctant entrepreneur, requiring reassurance from his mother that the moral imperatives of a nonconformist conscience would not conflict with the demands and responsibilities of running the family business. Perhaps reflecting on the experience of his father he expressed a fear that a life dedicated to success and expansion of the company might leave insufficient time for service in the faith, self improvement, and earnest recreation and that selfishness, influence, and wealth so often associated with business would need to be resisted. On assuming control of J. and J. Colman when his father died he also acknowledged the &#145;perilous position&#146; of being &#145;at so young an age, master absolutely and unreservedly of so many people, and sometimes to have to demand an implicit though be it reluctant obedience&#146;  (Colman, 80). On 25 September 1856 he married Caroline [<a name="cosubject_60826"></a><span class="headword">Caroline Colman</span>  (1831&#150;1895)], eldest daughter of William Hardy Cozens-Hardy of Letheringsett Hall, Norfolk. Caroline shared his religious and social views and was an active partner in his life while raising their family of six children at Carrow House, Carrow, Norwich.<br>
<br>Between 1856 and 1862 Jeremiah James organized the relocation of the factory from Stoke to a newly built, large integrated factory and workshops at Carrow in Norwich, producing mustard, starch, and laundry blue. Growth led to incorporation in 1896, capitalized at &pound;1,350,000, though ownership remained entirely within the Colman family. In business Jeremiah James sought to be &#145;useful&#146;, in accordance with his mother's prescription for a fulfilling but reverential business life, in two ways. One was by increasing employment opportunities for Colman employees and their families in a town which had seen its staple industry destroyed: by 1869 the number of workers employed at the Carrow works was 1100 rising to 2500 by 1898. The second form which usefulness took was an attempt to promote their employees' general well-being. The first was achieved by successful innovation, partly in production and organization but principally through innovative marketing policies first introduced by the elder Jeremiah and James during the 1840s. From that time the sale of mustard, starch, and blue began to be made in small amounts packed in containers distinctive in size, shape, label, and colour.<br>
<br>The bull's head logo introduced in 1856, one of the first merchandise marks of its kind, heralded such a growth in brand advertising that in the 1870s a separate advertising department was formed at Carrow. In 1871 the partners appointed an outsider, Robert Haselwood, as manager (and later general manager) of the Carrow works. His responsibility was to implement the partners' policies. The appointment of accountants also marked the beginning of systematic accountability and control over the business.<br>
<br>Successful managerial delegation was accompanied by an informal arrangement whereby Caroline Colman took responsibility for supervising welfare provision in the company. When in 1857 the company school, started by the elder Jeremiah and James at Stoke, was transferred to Carrow, Caroline became responsible for its management and for planning the new purpose-built accommodation on Carrow Hill. She also originated several welfare initiatives. The Carrow works kitchen, forerunner of the works canteen, was opened in 1868 to serve commuting workers with early morning tea and coffee and hot midday meals at nominal cost. Basic, low cost lodging accommodation, including laundry, was available to young female workers under the immediate charge of a matron. To help women workers to save, Caroline organized a clothing club, to which she contributed a bonus added to their savings, and purchased drapery in bulk annually for sale at cost at Christmas. To help young women to sew and &#145;to become better women and wives&#146; in 1874 the company engaged a dressmaking teacher.<br>
<br>The provision of medical and health care was exceptional, available within a context defined by the company's insistence that employees must be insured either through the company's accident, sickness, and provident schemes or through an independent friendly society. A dispensary was opened in 1864, staffed by a doctor and a nurse. In 1878 an assistant was appointed for the sole purpose of visiting sick employees with food from the works kitchen, probably the first example of industrial nursing in the country. Jeremiah James ensured that the charitable activities within the company designed to alleviate sickness and the consequences of infirmity and old age of Colman employees and families were continued after his death by inserting a clause in the 1896 articles of association. His will included the annual provision of &pound;20,000 for twenty years to be used by trustees for this purpose.<br>
<br>As the Liberal MP for Norwich between 1871 and 1895 Jeremiah James voted as a Gladstonian Liberal until the Parnell sex scandal. He became a friend of the prime minister, who stayed with him at the Cliffe, Corton, Suffolk, on a number of occasions. Lacking oratorical skill Colman made little impact on an institution with which he quickly became disillusioned. However, as a Norwich town council representative between 1859 and 1871 (sheriff in 1862 and 1868 and mayor in 1869) he was the central figure in the movement to remove bribery and corruption for which Norwich was notorious. As the founder chairman of a committee of independent reformers set up in 1859 he campaigned for measures which advanced the liberty and interests of nonconformists and for franchise reform.<br>
<br>In February 1895 Jeremiah James's and Caroline's son Alan Cozens-Hardy Colman (<i>b</i>. 1867) died. In the early part of 1895 Caroline's health, too, declined and she died on 5 July at Corton. She was buried five days later at the Rosary burial-ground, Norwich. Depressed by the deaths of his wife and son, Jeremiah James took up again the burden of work. In February 1898 he started out for the Riviera but was detained in Paris by an attack of influenza. His penultimate visit to London was to attend Gladstone's funeral on 28 May. His final weeks were spent at Corton surrounded by the youngest members of his family. News of his mother's death, at the age of ninety-three, on 15 September further depressed him, and he died at the Cliffe, Corton, on 18 September 1898. Four days later he was buried alongside his wife at the Rosary. After his death, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38025/', "James Stuart (1843&#150;1913)")</script>, who was married to his eldest daughter, Laura Elizabeth, ran the firm for some years.<br>
<br>Members of the nineteenth-century Colman family were responsible for three enduring achievements: the establishment of a business which, well before the merger with Reckitts in 1938 had become one of Britain's 100 largest manufacturing companies, and whose products, especially Colman's mustard, became part of national life; second, the success of the <span class="italic">Eastern Daily Press</span>, with which Jeremiah James was closely involved when it was launched in 1870; not least, the family had a significant impact on the physical and cultural environment of Norwich. This was largely the effect of &#145;Citizen Colman's&#146; campaigning to promote the civic gospel, a cause to which he was a major contributor. He was a leader of the subscription campaign to ensure the use of all historic buildings for the public benefit, which by 1886 had seen both the castle and Blackfriars Hall pass into corporation ownership, and for the inclusion of the city walls and towers as part of the process of preservation. As a trustee of the Norwich Museum, in 1876 he bequeathed a large, varied collection which included paintings of the Norwich school. His library, relating to the history of Norwich and Norfolk, was donated posthumously by the Colman family to the city library, forming the unique Norfolk Studies Collection. Jeremiah James also purchased land for an extension to the children's hospital, the Jenny Lind Infirmary, in 1895, following the death of his son. Behind his conduct and achievements in business and public life lay his insistence that &#145;it is by taking our religion into everyday life, and by so acting that the world around us sees that in party strife, or commercial enterprise, we do that, and that only, which is consistent with our Christian profession&#146;  (Colman, 134).<br>
