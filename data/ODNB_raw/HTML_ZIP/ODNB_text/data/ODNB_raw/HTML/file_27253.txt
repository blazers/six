<span class="headword">Tomlinson <span class="st"> [Thomlinson]</span>,  Matthew</span>, appointed Lord Tomlinson under the protectorate  (<em>bap. </em>1617, <em>d.</em> 1681), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and politician</span>, was baptized at St Michael-le-Belfry, York, on 24 September 1617, two months after the death of his father, John Thomlinson. When Matthew was nine his mother, Eleanor, daughter of Matthew Dodsworth, married Thomas Coventry.<br>
<br>In 1642 Tomlinson was one of the gentlemen of the inns of court who enlisted under Sir Philip Stapleton in the earl of Essex's company of life guards. In spring 1645 he was campaigning in Oxfordshire. He had become a major and eventually took over command of Sir Robert Pye's troop of horse as colonel in 1647. His importance in the New Model Army was indicated in June 1647 when he was chosen to present the army's remonstrance to the House of Commons. He and his regiment were among those who arrived in London in August 1647, and the following October he participated in the debates at Putney over the future settlement of the kingdom. However, he was never conspicuous in political debate. His continuing importance in the army was shown in 1648. On 28 November he was one of those charged with justifying the army's fresh descent on London. Soon afterwards he commanded the troop which guarded Charles I during his trial (to which Tomlinson had been appointed as one of the judges, but had declined to sit) and attended the king to the scaffold. Charles acknowledged the courtesy with which he had been treated by Tomlinson, giving him a golden toothpick and case.<br>
<br>Tomlinson saw renewed fighting in the summer of 1649, quelling trouble in Kent. In 1650 he and his regiment joined Cromwell in Scotland. They were present at the battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651. Residual legal expertise may explain his inclusion by the Rump Parliament among the members of the Hale commission, set up to recommend reforms in the law. With the end of the Long Parliament, in May 1653, he was named to the council of state, and was then co-opted into Barebone's Parliament. His services were already exploited on a number of financial committees. Tomlinson made substantial purchases of crown land during the interregnum. He bought in 1653 Ampthill Great Park, Bedfordshire, for &pound;6140 and the following year part of the manor of Dyndathway, Anglesey, for &pound;2754. He also bought Lincoln dean and chapter lands for, in all, &pound;1671.<br>
<br>In August 1654 Tomlinson was included in the council which was to help Charles Fleetwood govern Ireland. Soon Fleetwood was effectively superseded by Henry Cromwell. Tomlinson was out of sympathy with what he&#151;and others&#151;regarded as the more conservative tenor of the administration, as it sought to widen its appeal among local civilians. Nevertheless outward courtesies were maintained, with Henry Cromwell knighting Tomlinson on 24 November 1657. Shortly afterwards, he was named to the other house of the Westminster parliament, but his duties in Ireland prevented his attendance. His sympathies with the opponents of the Cromwellian protectorate led to his reappointment to the successor government in Ireland as a parliamentary commissioner in July 1659. He collaborated with another proponent of &#145;the good old cause&#146;, Edmund Ludlow. He was toppled when a more conservative group seized Dublin Castle in December 1659, and was returned as a prisoner to England. At risk because of these sympathies, after Charles II's return he was imprisoned but not tried. For the rest of his life he was unobtrusive. In 1669 he was noted as pleading for religious toleration for protestant nonconformists. He had married well: his wife, Pembroke (<i>d</i>. 1683), daughter of Sir William Brooke, was an heir to the Cobham estates. They had two daughters, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1703) and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1692). Tomlinson died at East Malling, Kent, on 3 or 5 November 1681 and was buried in the parish church there.<br>
