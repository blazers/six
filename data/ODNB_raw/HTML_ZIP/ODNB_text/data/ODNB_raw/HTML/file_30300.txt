<span class="headword">Zouche <span class="st"> [Zouch]</span>,  Alan  de la</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1270), <span class="occ">administrator and soldier</span>, was one of Henry III's trusted supporters and servants. His grandfather, also called Alan, had arrived in England from Brittany in the 1170s, and had founded the family's fortunes in England by his marriage to the heiress Alice de Belmeis, thereby securing extensive estates including Tong (Shropshire), Ashby (Leicestershire), and North Molton (Devon). A junior branch of the family was established in Northamptonshire by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61242/', "Eudo de la Zouche (d. 1279)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54535/', "Zouche family")</script>]. Alan succeeded his father, Roger, in 1238, and was soon active in the service of Henry III: in 1242 he was one of those who effected the capture of the notorious outlaw William de Marisco on Lundy island, and in 1242&#150;3 he saw military service in Gascony. His first taste of high office came in 1250 when he was appointed justice of the county of Chester and the Four Cantrefs (the district of north Wales east of the River Conwy). He paid 1000 marks for the post, allegedly outbidding the current holder of the office. He flaunted the wealth he raised from the district, and boasted that the whole of Wales was now reduced to obedience. But his high-handed and insensitive behaviour provoked royal investigation, and fuelled the resentment in the area against the English, which led to the violent overthrow of English rule in 1256. By then Zouche had entered the service of the Lord Edward (who had been given the royal lands in Wales, Ireland, and Chester in February 1254), and acted as his justiciar in Ireland from June 1256 to October 1258.<br>
<br>With the onset of civil discord in England in June 1258, Zouche was given ample opportunity to display his unflinching loyalty to the king. His closeness to Henry III during these years is indicated by the fact that he is described at various times between October 1261 and January 1263 as steward of the royal household. He was also given important posts in the country: sheriff of Northamptonshire (1261&#150;4), justice of the forests south of the Trent (from June 1261), and constable of Rockingham Castle (1261&#150;4) and Northampton Castle (1261&#150;3). His Welsh experience prompted the king to dispatch him to guard the Welsh marches against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in December 1262. Two events in December 1263 showed the measure of the king's confidence in him: on 12 December he was one of the barons chosen on the king's side to submit all points in the political dispute to the arbitration of Louis of France; and on 24 December he was given custody of the counties of Devon, Somerset, and Dorset as a military lieutenant. Taken prisoner at the battle of Lewes (14 May 1264), Zouche escaped to Lewes Priory, where he disguised himself as a monk, but he was recaptured and imprisoned. In the aftermath of the king's victory at Evesham (4 August 1265) he played an important part in the pacification of the country: he was one of the twelve arbitrators appointed to arrange the terms of the surrender of Kenilworth Castle in 1266, and was one of the justices appointed to hear the pleas of the disinherited. The reward for his loyalty included handsome gifts and appointment to the important and lucrative post of warden of London and constable of the Tower from June 1267 to April 1268.<br>
<br>During 1270 Zouche became involved in a dispute with John de Warenne (<i>d</i>. 1304), almost certainly over the manors of Ashby and Chadston in Northamptonshire. The manors had been forfeited by their owner, David Ashby, for his support for Simon de Montfort and granted to Zouche; but Warenne, as the guardian of Ashby's granddaughter, also had an interest in them. During an altercation in Westminster Hall on 1 July 1270 Warenne and his men assaulted Zouche and his son in the presence of the royal justice and the chancellor. Zouche suffered wounds from which he died on 10 August 1270. Warenne was forced to perform public acts of contrition for the assault and to offer a fine of 10,000 marks to the king.<br>
<br>Zouche was a benefactor of the knights templars and of the Cistercian abbey of Buildwas in Shropshire. He married, before 1242, Helen, one of the daughters and coheirs of Roger de Quincy, earl of Winchester, and in 1267 secured her share of the Quincy estates. He was succeeded by his son Roger la Zouche (<i>d</i>. 1285); his widow died on 20 August 1296.<br>
