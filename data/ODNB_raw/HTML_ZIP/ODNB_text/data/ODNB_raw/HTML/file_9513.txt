<span class="headword">Fisk,  William</span>  (1796&#150;1872), <span class="occ">portrait and history painter</span>, born at Thorpe-le-Soken, Essex, was the son of a yeoman farmer at Can Hall in that county, of a family which dated back to the days of Henry IV. Drawing became Fisk's favourite occupation very early, but his inclination to art was discouraged by his father, who sent him to school at Colchester and placed him at nineteen years of age in a mercantile house in London. Fisk remained in this profession for ten years, though he never neglected his artistic talent, and in 1819 sent the Royal Academy a portrait, <span class="italic">Child and Favourite Dog</span>. About 1826 he married Margaret Thomas and after the birth of his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9514/', "William Henry Fisk")</script>, soon afterwards devoted himself seriously to art as a profession. In 1829 he sent the Royal Academy a portrait of William Redmore Bigg RA (1755&#150;1828), and he continued to exhibit portraits there for a few years. At the British Institution he exhibited in 1830 <span class="italic">The Widow</span>, and in 1832 <span class="italic">Puck</span>. About 1834 he started producing the large historical paintings for which he is now best-known. These compositions, although later seen as &#145;a failure from an artistic point of view&#146;, have been seen to possess value from the care Fisk took to obtain contemporary portraits and authorities for costume, which he faithfully reproduced on his canvas. Some of them were engraved, and the popularity of the engravings led to his painting more. They included <span class="italic">Lady Jane Grey, when in Confinement in the Tower, Visited by Feckenham</span> (exh. British Institution, 1834), <span class="italic">The Coronation of Robert Bruce</span> (exh. RA, 1836), and <span class="italic">The Conspiracy of the Pazzi, or, The Attempt to Assassinate Lorenzo de Medici</span> (exh. RA, 1839). The last-named painting was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Manchester Institution for the best historical picture exhibited in its gallery. About 1840 Fisk commenced a series of five paintings connected with the reign of Charles I, namely, <span class="italic">Cromwell's Family Interceding for the Life of Charles I</span> (exh. RA, 1840); <span class="italic">The Trial of the Earl of Strafford</span> (never exhibited, engraved by James Scott in 1841, and now in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool); <span class="italic">The Trial of Charles I in Westminster Hall, 1641</span> (exh. RA, 1842); <span class="italic">Charles I Passing through the Banqueting-House, Whitehall, to the Scaffold</span> (exh. RA, 1843); and <span class="italic">The Last Interview of Charles I with his Children</span> (exh. British Institution, 1844). Other later paintings Fisk exhibited at the Royal Academy, which were of literary subjects, were <span class="italic">The Rivals</span> (exh. 1844) and <span class="italic">Sir Roger de Coverley, Will Honeycomb, &amp;c, in the Temple Cloisters</span> (exh. 1845). Fisk also showed paintings frequently at the Suffolk Street exhibition. He eventually retired to Gay Bowers, a property he had purchased at Danbury, Essex, where he died on 8 November 1872.<br>
