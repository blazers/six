<span class="headword">Payne,  Joseph Frank</span>  (1840&#150;1910), <span class="occ">physician and medical historian</span>, was born in the parish of St Giles, Camberwell, in Surrey, on 10 January 1840, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21649/', "Joseph Payne (1808&#150;1876)")</script>, professor and a founder member of the College of Preceptors, where education was taught, and his wife, Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dyer (<i>d</i>. 1875), also a teacher. After education by his father he went to University College, London. In 1858 he gained a demyship at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1862 with a first class in natural science. He obtained the Burdett-Coutts scholarship in geology (1863), the Radcliffe travelling fellowship (1865), which took him to Paris, Berlin, and Vienna, and a Magdalen fellowship, which he vacated on his marriage (he became an honorary fellow on 30 May 1906). He graduated BSc (London) in 1865. Payne studied medicine at St George's Hospital, London, and graduated BM at Oxford in 1867 and DM in 1880. He became a member of the Royal College of Physicians of London in 1868, and was elected a fellow in 1873. Payne settled in London and became assistant physician at the Hospital for Sick Children in Great Ormond Street, and demonstrator of morbid anatomy at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, in 1869. He left St Mary's in 1871 to become assistant physician to St Thomas's Hospital, where he was appointed physician in 1887. He retired in 1900. He was also on the staff of the Hospital for Skin Diseases at Blackfriars. He married, on 1 September 1882, Helen, daughter of the Hon. John Macpherson of Melbourne, Victoria. They had one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>Although primarily a physician, Payne made substantial contributions to pathology, epidemiology, dermatology, and the history of medicine. As pathologist he came to public prominence as expert witness for the defence in the trial of Louis Staunton and others for the murder of Staunton's wife, Harriet, at Penge in 1877. Although the jury convicted, Payne's argument that death was caused by tuberculous meningitis was eventually accepted. The home secretary commuted the death sentences on Louis Staunton, his brother, and his sister-in-law to penal servitude for life. Payne edited in 1875 <span class="italic">Manual of Pathological Anatomy</span> by Jones and Sieveking, and in 1888 he published <span class="italic">A Manual of General Pathology</span>, which in its emphasis on function and aetiology, as well as morbid anatomy, exemplified the view expressed in his presidential address to the Pathological Society of London in 1897 that &#145;it would be a loss rather than a gain were pathology to live like a cloistered recluse, in laboratories and museums, not breathing the common air of the whole medical world&#146;. Between 1868 and 1891 he presented many case reports to the society. In 1891 he gave the Lumleian lectures at the Royal College of Physicians, entitled &#145;On cancer, especially of the internal organs&#146;. His career as a descriptive morbid anatomist with clinical practice epitomized that of the physician&#150;pathologist dominant in English medicine during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Sir James Goodhart in his 1912 Harveian oration ranked him with Matthew Baillie, Richard Bright, Thomas Addison, John Bristowe, Sir William Jenner, and Sir Samuel Wilks, as a great master of morbid anatomy.<br>
<br>As an epidemiologist and medical historian Payne had a particular interest in plague. In 1879 he was sent to Russia by the government with Surgeon-Major Colvill to report on the epidemic of plague at Vetlyanka. He wrote articles on plague and the sweating sickness in the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> (9th edn), <span class="italic">St Thomas's Hospital Reports</span>, <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> (October 1901), and Allbutt's <span class="italic">System of Medicine</span> (vol. 2, 1907). He was also the spokesman of the committee of the Royal College of Physicians in 1905, on the Indian epidemic of plague. He had printed in 1894, with an introduction on the history of the plague, the &#145;Loimographia&#146; of William Boghurst, who witnessed the London plague of 1665, from the Sloane manuscript. In some of his writing on the transmission of infection, Payne pioneered a quantitative approach&#151;well before this became a common feature of studies on this subject. His main dermatological contributions were his <span class="italic">Observations on some Rare Diseases of the Skin</span> (1889) and his presidency of the Dermatological Society (1892&#150;3).<br>
<br>Payne was held in high regard as a medical historian. He wrote a life of Thomas Linacre which was prefixed to a facsimile of the 1521 Cambridge edition of Linacre's Latin version of Galen, <span class="italic">De temperamentis</span> (Cambridge, 1881). In 1896 he delivered the Harveian oration on the relation of Harvey to Galen, and in 1900 he wrote a still useful life of Thomas Sydenham. He wrote long articles on the history of medicine in the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, and in Allbutt's <span class="italic">System of Medicine</span> (vol. 1, 1905), besides seventy-eight lives in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. In 1904 he delivered the first FitzPatrick lectures on the history of medicine at the Royal College of Physicians. His last historical work was entitled <span class="italic">History of the College Club</span>, an account of a select dining society of the college, of which he was a member. It was privately printed in 1909.<br>
<br>For the Royal College of Physicians, Payne was an examiner for the college licence, a censor in 1896&#150;7, and senior censor in 1905. He became Harveian librarian in 1899, and had a great knowledge of bibliography and of the history of woodcuts. He gave many books to the college library. In 1896 he edited the &#145;Nomenclature of diseases&#146;. He sat on the royal commission on tuberculosis (1890), on the General Medical Council representing the University of Oxford (1899&#150;1904), and on the University of London senate (1899&#150;1906). He was on the London Library committee, and was himself the possessor of a fine library. Except for small bequests to the college, it was sold at Sothebys after his death. The catalogues emphasize the early medical works, the numerous books and tracts on pestilence from the earliest times to the eighteenth century, the rare herbals, and a series of the first and later editions of John Milton's writings and Miltoniana.<br>
<br>Payne first met William Osler in 1873, when he took him to a meeting of the Medical Microscopical Society, at which Osler read his first scientific paper. Osler held Payne in high regard; a particular interest that linked them was book collecting, one that persisted after Payne's death when Osler tried to secure the medical section of his library for the Johns Hopkins Library. The works were bought instead by Henry Wellcome&#151;the most dramatic example of the book-collecting rivalry between Osler and Wellcome.<br>
<br>Payne was said to be ineffective in committees because he gave an opinion only when asked. Although verging on the polymathic&#151;he wrote an article on furniture for the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>&#151;he did not flaunt his learning, as illustrated by an anecdote in the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> obituary:<blockquote>One wet Sunday in Switzerland a young lady came into the salon of the hotel, and joined a semicircle around Payne, who was distributing his golden share of information to any who cared to listen. Her comment on the close was, &#145;To think that I sat next to him at <i>table d'h&ocirc;te</i> for three nights, and all he said was &#147;please pass the salt&#148;&#146;. (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 2 (1910))</blockquote>Payne was below middle height and had a curious jerky manner of expressing emphasis both in public speaking and in private conversation. He died at Lyonsdown House, New Barnet, Hertfordshire, on 16 November 1910, and was buried at Bell's Hill cemetery, Barnet.<br>
