<span class="headword">Austin,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1587&#150;1634), <span class="occ">author</span>, was the only son of James Austin (<i>d</i>. 1602) and his wife, Joyce (1559/60&#150;1626). He probably matriculated from St John's College, Cambridge, in 1603, but later moved to London to study at Lincoln's Inn, where he was admitted in October 1604 (at the request of his future stepfather Sir Robert Clerke, one of the barons of the exchequer) and called to the bar in November 1611. After leaving Lincoln's Inn he settled in Paris Garden, Southwark, where he lived for the rest of his life. He was twice married: first, on 6 June 1609, to Anne Grimes, who died in childbirth in 1624, and second, on 1 January 1627, to Anne Bingham, who survived him. He had ten children, of whom four, Joyce (<i>b</i>. 1613), Mary (<i>b</i>. 1615), James (<i>b</i>. 1616), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/918/', "William Austin (b. 1627/8, d. in or before 1677)")</script>, survived to adulthood.<br>
<br>Austin was one of the London wits who contributed prefatory verses to <span class="italic">Coryat's Crudities</span> (1611) but most of his surviving works appear to have been written in the 1620s. His essay <span class="italic">Haec homo, wherein the Excellency of the Creation of Woman is Described</span>, though not published until 1637, is said by its editor, I. A. (probably his son James), to be an early work, and may have been written about 1620 in response to the misogynist pamphlet <span class="italic">Hic mulier, or, The Man-Woman</span>. His translation of Cicero, <span class="italic">Cato Major, or, The Book of Old Age</span>, may also be an early work, though it did not appear in print until 1648, when a manuscript accidentally fell into the hands of the London stationer William Leake. Austin's most significant work, however, is a series of meditations and poems (some dated 1621 and 1622) on the major feast-days of the Christian year. The poems, which include a set of &#145;Carrols for Christmas Day&#146; and three linked &#145;Meditations for Good Friday&#146;, were circulated in manuscript during Austin's lifetime and at least four contemporary copies survive, all in the hand of the professional scribe Ralph Crane. Writing in 1632 Crane claimed that copies were in short supply, &#145;there not being three such anywhere extant; and not one (unless surreptitiously gotten) but of my pen&#146;  (BL, Harleian MS 3357, fol. 2), but Austin evidently circulated copies among his friends, one of whom, James Howell, urged him to print them, &#145;for they have an edifying power in them, and may be termed the very quintessence of devotion&#146;  (Howell, 5.13). In his will, signed on 19 May 1632, Austin left detailed instructions for the printing of &#145;my poore meditations&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/165/14), which also included an elegy on his first wife and his dead children, and they were duly published in 1635 by his widow and executor, as <span class="italic">Devotionis Augustinianae flamma</span>, with an engraved frontispiece after Austin's own design. The will also lists the intended recipients of presentation copies, including John Selden, Thomas Farnaby, and Ben Jonson, thus providing a useful index of Austin's literary friendships.<br>
<br>Austin was a generous benefactor to the church of St Saviour, Southwark, to which he presented a silver chalice and paten. In the north transept of the church he erected a remarkable emblematic monument to the memory of his mother and first wife, which used agricultural motifs (including harvesters, a wheatsheaf, a winnowing fan, and a corn shovel) to illustrate the text &#145;Vos estis agricultura dei&#146;. The monument has been attributed to the sculptor Nicholas Stone but was almost certainly designed by Austin himself, who was an amateur artist (his will lists a &#145;booke of Christ's Passion coloured by me&#146; and a set of &#145;toyes in paper drawne by my owne hand&#146;) and also owned an important collection of paintings on classical and religious subjects. He died on 16 January 1634, &#145;aetatis suae 47&#146;, and was buried on 18 January in the church. His tombstone, underneath the monument, described him in an elegant Latin epitaph as &#145;an Angel in his thoughts, a Daedalus in his actions &hellip; a miracle of patience in illness, an example of faithfulness in death&#146;.<br>
