<span class="headword">Youngman,  Nancy Mayhew <span class="st"> [Nan]</span></span>  (1906&#150;1995), <span class="occ">painter and art educationist</span>, was born in Lensfield House, Maidstone, Kent, on 28 June 1906, the daughter of John Henry Youngman (1868?&#150;<i>c</i>.1948), a partner in the corn merchants Bradley, Taylor, and Youngman, and his wife, Adelaide Edith (Bida), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marshall (1871?&#150;<i>c</i>.1950). Nan Youngman had two elder brothers, one of whom was killed in Flanders in 1916. She was educated at Wycombe Abbey School, Buckinghamshire, and at the Slade School of Fine Art (1924&#150;7). Nan Youngman lived through one of the most formative periods in British painting during a period of social, ideological, and political change to which most artists of her time felt obliged to respond. Her painting was anchored in the craftsmanship demanded by Henry Tonks and Philip Wilson Steer at the Slade and was initially linked, broadly, with social realism. Her painting was always uncompromisingly original as was her approach to her work in education, her personal life, and the relationships in which she was involved. Nan Youngman belonged to no school. While moving on from her rather austere palette knife paintings of the 1930s she remained consciously apart from any of the modernist movements. But her sharp and humorous eye for the incongruous resulted in what are, at times, surrealist images&#151;a ruined freestanding wall and iron gate juxtaposed with an ancient bicycle, a forlorn red sign on a deserted station, or a couple of windswept beach huts which appear to be knowingly returning the viewer's gaze. The people in her paintings are acutely observed but this acuity of vision is recorded more through their signs and works than in their figures. The surrealist quality of these pictures, while less obvious, is present in the gentle irony that informs all her work, even the most serious of her industrial landscapes.<br>
<br>Nan Youngman saw herself as a socialist, but was offended by Soviet communism. She was a freethinker and a religious sceptic with a liking for ribald and irreverent jokes. Behind the diminutive figure with the pudding basin haircut, trousers, blue smock, and ready grin was a formidable organizer, a leader, and a teacher who inspired admiration, at times adulation, among those she led and taught.<br>
<br>Nan Youngman's working life was divided between painting and teaching. After leaving the Slade she took an art teacher's diploma at the London Day Training Centre under Marion Richardson and began to teach part-time at Highbury Girls' School, London. From Richardson she inherited the strong belief in the importance of art in the curriculum which underlay all her subsequent work in art education.<br>
<br>In the 1930s she showed at the Wertheim Gallery and with the London Group. In 1936 Youngman became involved in the left-wing Artists' International Association (AIA) after the death in action in Spain of her Slade friend Felicia Browne. Here she met the sculptor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66318/', "Betty Rea")</script>, with whom she lived until Rea's death in 1965. She worked on the Paris World Fair peace pavilion in 1937 with Rea and many other AIA artists including Mary Adshead. In 1939 Youngman and Rea moved, after the evacuation of Highbury School to Huntingdon, first to a caravan in the grounds of Hinchingbrooke Castle and then to Godmanchester. In 1944 she was appointed art adviser for Cambridgeshire. She became chair of the Society for Education through Art and was on the editorial board of <span class="italic">Athene</span>. In 1947 she founded the &#145;Pictures for Schools&#146; series of exhibitions showing the work of many distinguished artists, which was widely patronized by local education authorities. These exhibitions later extended to Wales and Scotland. She was a chief examiner, founder of the Cambridge Studio Workshop, later extended to the Mill Group at Overy Staithe, Norfolk, and lectured widely in Britain and abroad. Archive material on Youngman's educational work, including writing on art teaching, is held at Reading University.<br>
<br>In 1954, encouraged by the writer and art critic Bryan Robertson, Nan Youngman began full-time painting, showed at the Leicester Gallery, and, in 1955, with Rea, Cecil Collins, Elisabeth Vellacott, and others founded the Cambridge Society of Painters and Sculptors. Papermills, the large and picturesque house in Cambridge she shared with Rea and her children and many visitors, was the social centre of the society. This was a productive period yielding many of her best and most important oil paintings, especially those of the south Wales mining valleys then at their peak. These were shown in many one-woman and group exhibitions and are in several permanent public collections. With Rea's death in 1965, Nan Youngman moved to The Hawks, Ely Road, Waterbeach. She continued to spend time in Cardiff with the Welsh painter Esther Grainger but her life became quieter and her paintings increasingly focused on the works of nature rather than man. Many of her later paintings are of the sands and skyscapes of the Norfolk coast, mainly in watercolour and gouache. The first Youngman retrospective was held at the Minories Gallery, Colchester, in 1974. Apart from selling exhibitions her work was shown in &#145;The story of the AIA&#146; at the Oxford Gallery in 1983, at her second retrospective at Kettles Yard, Cambridge, in 1987 and in the &#145;Ten decades&#146; exhibition of leading women artists of her generation in Norwich and London in 1991. She was appointed OBE in 1987 for services to art.<br>
<br>Nan Youngman died at home, at The Hawks, on 17 April 1995. She was cremated in Cambridge. A summary exhibition of her life and work was held at the Morley Gallery, London, in October 1997. Nan Youngman distrusted the commercial establishment surrounding artists. She never employed an agent and her work was never self-consciously promoted. Despite this there is a large body of her work in public collections including <span class="italic">Steelworks Ebbw Vale</span> (1951; Newport Gallery), <span class="italic">Rhondda Saturday</span> (1953; Newport Gallery), the Welsh Contemporary Art Society, Manchester City Galleries, the Whipple Museum, and numerous local authorities, colleges, and schools. There are a number of private collections of her work in Britain and the United States.<br>
