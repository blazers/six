<span class="headword">Poole,  Paul Falconer</span>  (1807&#150;1879), <span class="occ">history and genre painter</span>, fourth son of James Paul Poole, a Bristol coal merchant, was born at 43 College Street, Bristol, on 28 December 1807. He was baptized Paul Fawkner Poole at St Augustine's on 22 July 1810. An elder brother, James Poole, a merchant, was mayor of Bristol in 1858&#150;9 and chairman of the docks committee; he died aged seventy-five on 24 December 1872. Paul Falconer Poole received little general education and was largely self-taught as an artist. He received a free season ticket to the Bristol Institution's exhibitions in 1824 when he was already described as &#145;a young artist&#146;  (Bristol RO, proceedings of the Bristol Institution's Exhibition Rooms subcommittee, 1824). The amateur artist George Cumberland mentioned his work with enthusiasm in 1826 and two years later wrote to Sir Thomas Lawrence, president of the Royal Academy, lobbying on Poole's behalf.<br>
<br>In the winter of 1828&#150;9 Poole was sent by his father to Italy to obtain the signature of a parson that was required for the building of Holy Trinity, Hotwells. He visited the Louvre in Paris and stopped at Genoa, Milan, Florence, Rome, and Naples. This &#145;raw lad from the Hotwell Road with a fine strong feeling for art and nature but utterly uncultivated&#146;  (John King to John Gibbons, 8 April 1829, Gibbons papers) sent back letters to his closest artist friend, James Johnson (1803&#150;1834), that greatly impressed the surgeon John King. Both Francis Danby and John King imply that after he returned from Italy Poole enjoyed the drawing parties organized by Bristol artists in 1829 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95531', "Bristol school of artists")</script>], and two sepia wash drawings of harem scenes (Bristol Museums and Art Gallery) come close to the exotic fantasies that William West (1801&#150;1861) produced at the meetings at this time. In July 1829 Francis Danby visited Bristol and spent a day with Poole in Leigh Woods, which, as he reported back to his patron, John Gibbons, &#145;is an excellent place for painters to become acquainted, and I liked him [Poole] very much&#146;  (Francis Danby to John Gibbons, 23 July 1829, Gibbons papers). However, Danby had seen Poole's earliest exhibited works at the Bristol Institution's 1829 exhibition which were titled <span class="italic">The Clarinet Player</span>, <span class="italic">The Woodman's Daughter</span>, and <span class="italic">The Drunken Fiddler</span>, and of these Danby expressed his intense dislike, while recognizing Poole's talent.<br>
<br>In November 1829 Poole moved to London and George Cumberland anticipated that he would soon surpass the Bristol genre artists Edward Bird and E. V. Rippingille<blockquote>if his modest opinion of himself does not impede his studies &hellip; you will find him very good tempered and companiable, but high in his notions, as usual, of the consequence of a Painter &hellip; His family are coal merchants and very respectable. (G. Cumberland sen. to G. Cumberland jun., 20 Nov 1829, Cumberland papers, BL, Add. MS 36513, vol. xxiii, fol. 231)</blockquote>In 1830 Poole showed <span class="italic">The Well: a Scene at Naples</span> at the Royal Academy. He received a commission from John Gibbons, and Rippingille took him to call on Sir Thomas Lawrence.<br>
<br>By June 1830, however, rumours of scandal were already circulating in Bristol. It seems probable that by December of the previous year Poole had been giving guitar lessons to Francis Danby's wife, Hannah (<i>bap</i>. 1794, <i>d</i>. 1879). Danby had just fled to Paris, ostensibly from his creditors. However, Danby's mistress, perhaps already pregnant, had probably gone to Paris with him in December; his seven children joined them in Bruges by June 1830. Poole and Hannah Danby, who was thirteen years or so his senior, may have left London before the children's departure, allowing Danby the subsequent luxury of accusing her of desertion. By early May Poole himself had left London. In June he was in north Wales, perhaps with Hannah, and in September he wrote to John Gibbons from near Birmingham. In August 1831 they visited Bristol but saw almost no one, and Bristol friends were unaware of the location of their self-imposed exile. This unhappy story adds meaning to William Bell Scott's expressive description of Poole:<blockquote>Shy, sensitive, nervous, full of large conceptions, with a pathetic sadness in his manner &hellip; possessed of a strong individuality, a man of peculiar powers of mind and vivid conceptions &hellip; a man with a strain of savage in his blood and a good hater. (Scott, 1.111)</blockquote>Those &#145;vivid conceptions&#146; were slow to take form and Scott's words may owe more to his memory of Poole's paintings and circumstances than of Poole's character.<br>
<br>Poole initially concentrated upon the type of work for which he continues to be best-known: &#145;routine pieces, smiling country girls with their children posed against the rocky streams of the West Country&#146;  (Reynolds, 142). These works appear regularly in the salerooms but were seldom exhibited by Poole. They were evidently a vital and regular source of income and one obituarist described them as &#145;always sweet, simple and tender&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 1879, 263). Today they can seem insipid, but they are mercifully lacking in Greuze's salaciousness and are impressively varied in pose and landscape setting, even if similar in format. Exhibits at the Society of British Artists from 1833 to 1835 suggest that Poole was living in Southampton, but in 1837 he once again showed at both the Royal Academy and the British Institution after a lapse of seven and six years respectively. He now gave a London address. Henceforth, Poole exhibited almost annually at the Royal Academy.<br>
<br>There was, however, little in those exhibited works to prepare the viewer for the convincing dramatic power and exceptional popularity of <span class="italic">Soloman Eagle Exhorting the People to Repentance, during the Plague of the Year 1665</span> (Sheffield Art Gallery), shown at the Royal Academy in 1843 and the following year at the British Institution (where he was not again to exhibit). Impressively, Poole followed up this success with almost equally powerful works. For example, at the Royal Academy in 1844 he showed <span class="italic">The Moors Beleaguered by the Spaniards in the City of Valencia</span> (Wolverhampton Art Gallery) and in 1846 he showed <span class="italic">The Visitation and Surrender of Syon Nunnery</span> (Bristol Museums and Art Gallery) and was rewarded with election as an associate of the Royal Academy. <span class="italic">Arl&egrave;te, a Peasant Girl of Falaise, in Normandy, First Discovered by Duke Robert le Diable</span> (Leicester Art Gallery) depicts six posturing and ill-proportioned girls by a wooded stream and was shown in 1848. In 1851 came <span class="italic">The Goths in Italy</span> (Manchester City Galleries). <span class="italic">The Escape of Glaucus and Ione, with the Blind Girl, Nydia, from Pompeii</span> illustrated Bulwer-Lytton's novel <span class="italic">The Last Days of Pompeii</span> and was exhibited in 1860, the year of Poole's election as a full academician. <span class="italic">The Athenaeum's</span> reviewer noted this painting's &#145;vague, dream-like style&#146; and thought that &#145;such a picture &hellip; would have nearly the effect of opium-eating&#146; upon the viewer  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 12 May 1860, 654). Similarly ambitious works continued to be shown and perhaps the latest in date to be in a public collection is the Tate's <span class="italic">Ezekiel's Vision</span> exhibited in 1875 and selected by the National Gallery from Poole's studio after his death. In 1843 Poole entered the Westminster Hall competition with <span class="italic">The Death of King Lear</span> and in 1847 he won a prize of &pound;300 in this houses of parliament project for his cartoon of <span class="italic">Edward's Generosity to the People of Calais during the Siege of 1346</span>.<br>
<br>Poole is said to have been a tall, elegantly built man, unassuming and without pretension. In the mid-1850s he built himself a house in Haverstock Hill, but as London progressively surrounded him he moved further out to Uplands, Greenhill, Hampstead, in 1872. The landscape painter Thomas Danby, Francis and Hannah Danby's fourth son, lived with Poole for several years from 1855 and the two artists collaborated on some minor works. In 1861, following Francis Danby's death, Poole and Hannah Danby were married. Poole died at his home, Uplands, on 22 September 1879 and was buried in Highgate cemetery. Three of Hannah and Francis Danby's children, including Thomas, were legatees of Poole's will and substantial estate, and the artist John Mogford, their son-in-law, was one of Poole's executors.<br>
<br>Poole's work continues to be hard to assess. His obituaries noted both his inept drawing and his feeling for colour and chiascuro:<blockquote>To Academic accuracy in his figures he never pretended, for, in the strict sense, he had had no academic training; but the dramatic instinct was strong in him, and in suggestiveness and in imagination he stood quite alone. (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 1879, 263)</blockquote>Graham Reynolds's reassessment in 1966 referred similarly to Poole's &#145;uniquely personal colour sense&#146; and found the expressions on the faces of the figures in <span class="italic">The Last scene in &#145;Lear&#146;</span> of 1858 (V&amp;A) &#145;human, unforced and tragic. Here is something barbaric, which corresponds to the elemental in Shakespeare's most moving and absolute work&#146;  (Reynolds, 142&#150;3). The showing of twenty-seven of Poole's paintings, including a dozen major works, at the Royal Academy's winter exhibition in 1884 seems to have prompted significantly little enthusiasm and it may be that his exhibition pieces will always be most enjoyed individually, as bold, personal, and deeply felt interpretations&#151;a welcome foil to the ponderous academic accomplishment of his contemporaries. Bristol City Museums and Art Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, and Manchester City Galleries have examples of his work.<br>
