<span class="headword">Geddes,  Wilhelmina Margaret</span>  (1887&#150;1955), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born on 25 May 1887 on her maternal grandparents' farm at Drumreilly, co. Leitrim, Ireland, the eldest of four children of William Geddis (<i>c</i>.1852&#150;1916), a site engineer with the Sligo/Leitrim and North Counties Railway, and Eliza Jane (1863&#150;1955), daughter of John Stafford, farmer, and his wife, Mary Anne Bleakley, both British. In 1888 her father moved to Belfast where he set up a thriving business as a building contractor. Her earliest (mostly life) drawings date from <i>c</i>.1891, executed when on a family summer outing to Ayrshire, where her lifelong love of Scottish border ballads was kindled. From an early age her (mostly unpublished) black and white book illustrations reflected her love of reading, while her literary skills included writing verse and stories. After attending the Methodist college, Belfast, between 1898 and 1902, she entered the Municipal Technical Institute of Belfast at the age of fifteen, spending eight years drawing from the antique and from life, while participating in Greek drama and suffragist meetings at Queen's University, Belfast, and winning a number of prizes for her assured graphic work, book illustrations, poster designs, and draughtsmanship. As early as 1906 her designs were declared &#145;too modern&#146;  (W. M. Geddes, MS diary, 18 May 1906; priv. coll.), a criticism sometimes levelled against her subsequent stained glass.<br>
<br>In 1910 Geddes's watercolour <span class="italic">Cinderella Dressing the Ugly Sister</span> (Hugh Lane Gallery, Dublin) was exhibited at the Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland and attracted the attention of Sarah Purser (1848&#150;1943), the Irish painter and founder of An T&uacute;r Gloine, the Dublin stained-glass co-operative. Purser, recognizing a strong, expressive line, rich colour, and original imagery, bought it and invited Geddes to join her workshop.<br>
<br>Back in Belfast, Geddes made an initial conventional stained-glass panel (<span class="italic">Sir Walter Raleigh</span>) before embarking in 1911 on a travelling scholarship to London and subsequently life classes with Sir William Orpen at the Metropolitan School of Art, Dublin. Her first, entirely original, work in stained glass, <span class="italic">Episodes from the Life of St. Colman Macduagh</span> (Hugh Lane Gallery, Dublin), a triptych of three small panels, revealed her lifelong vocation. By the end of 1912 she had become a member of An T&uacute;r Gloine, receiving tuition from its manager, Alfred Child, trained in the London studio of the English arts and crafts stained-glass master Christopher Whall, and designed and made her first, remarkably mature, full-scale church window, <span class="italic">The Angel of Resurrection</span> (Inishmacsaint, co. Fermanagh).<br>
<br>Geddes's small frame and spirited expression belied the solemn, monumental drama with which she imbued the fluidly modelled, introspective, and increasingly commanding figures that filled the thirty or so windows, swathed in colours of unimaginable depth and intensity, that she made throughout her life. Her love of archaic, Romanesque, and Assyrian sculpture informed the treatment of her always figurative designs, while her innate feeling for the lead calmes as an integral part of the orchestration of glass, light, colour, and painting revealed her understanding of medieval glass even more than her arts and crafts training.<br>
<br>In 1925 Geddes moved to London, to a studio in the Glass House in Fulham, which remained her working base for the rest of her life. Her best-known windows are the duke of Connaught's war memorial to his Canadian officers in the governor general's church of St Bartholomew, Ottawa (<span class="italic">The Welcoming of a Slain Warrior by Soldier-Saints, Champions and Angels</span>, 1919), <span class="italic">The Crucifixion with the Virgin Mary and St. John, Moses, Joseph of Arimathea, and the Deposition</span> (1922; St Luke's, Wallsend upon Tyne), and the Royal Air Force memorial rose window to King Albert of the Belgians in the rebuilt cathedral of St Martin, Ypres (<span class="italic">Te Deum</span>, 1938). In 1955 she collapsed in the street, and died at University College Hospital, St Pancras, London, on 10 August. She was unmarried. She was buried at Carnmoney, co. Antrim.<br>
