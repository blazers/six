<span class="headword">Neil,  Robert Alexander</span>  (1852&#150;1901), <span class="occ">classical scholar and orientalist</span>, was born on 26 December 1852 at Glengairn manse, Glengairn, near Ballater, Aberdeenshire, the second son of Robert Neil, minister of the <i>quoad sacra</i> parish of Glengairn, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Reid. Both parents were from Aberdeenshire families which had produced many clergymen and medical men. Robert was educated at the local school, but was taught classics by his father. In 1866, while only thirteen, he entered Aberdeen University, having obtained a small scholarship at the annual bursary competition. At the end of the session he was first prizeman in William Geddes's class. In 1870 he graduated at Aberdeen with first-class honours in classics, and shared the Simpson Greek prize.<br>
<br>The following winter Neil acted as an assistant in the university library and next year studied anatomy and chemistry with the intention of graduating in the medical faculty. He soon changed his mind and in 1873 he was elected a classical scholar of Peterhouse, Cambridge. Under the tuition of J. S. Reid, A. W. Verrall, and Richard Shilleto, he made such rapid progress that in 1875 he won the Craven scholarship, as well as obtaining a college prize; and in 1876 graduated as second classic. He was also highly distinguished in the year's examination for chancellor's medals. Soon afterwards he was elected a fellow of Pembroke College, where until his death he was a classical lecturer, although his public lectures were given for many years at Peterhouse. The following year he published &#145;Notes on Liddell and Scott&#146; in the <span class="italic">Journal of Philology</span> (7, 1877, 200&#150;05); but his teaching work left him little time for writing, which his cautious and fastidious nature made a laborious task.<br>
<br>Soon after completing his degree Neil began to read with the university's first professor of Sanskrit, Edward Byles Cowell. For the rest of his life Neil spent one or two afternoons a week in term time working with Cowell. In the earlier years they read parts of the <span class="roman">Rig-Veda</span>, Indian drama, grammar, and philosophy, but gradually they turned their attention to Buddhist literature. Under their joint names there eventually appeared <span class="italic">The Divy&#257;avad&#257;na: a collection of early Buddhist legends now first edited from the Nepalese Sanskrit MSS in Cambridge and Paris</span> (1886), founded on the collation of a number of Sanskrit manuscripts which were supplied to the editors from the libraries of Cambridge, Paris, and St Petersburg. After the publication of this work Neil took up the study of Pali, and formed one of the band of scholars who under Cowell's superintendence translated into English <span class="italic">The J&#257;taka, or, Stories of the Buddha's Former Births</span> (6 vols., 1895&#150;1907). Neil's own contribution forms part of volume 3 (1897; 151&#150;286).<br>
<br>During these years Neil was also busy with classical work. His <span class="italic">Knights of Aristophanes</span> was published posthumously in 1901, the only substantial evidence of his classical scholarship. It concentrates much scholarship and delicate observation of Aristophanic Greek, evident less in the editor's text-critical acumen and solution of unusually difficult passages than in the nicety of his lexical definitions (see, for example, Appendix 1, &#145;The particle <i>ge</i>&#146;), the wide-ranging provenance of his literary comparisons (see, for instances, the introduction, x, xiii, xiv), and his careful treatment of ordinary questions and small matters: the net result being, as one early reviewer noted  (Richards, 354), good commentary on little touches characteristic of Aristophanes and on issues of contemporary Attic life. Neil frequently lectured on the history of Greek comedy, Pindar, and Plato; and on these subjects he accumulated much knowledge. He was also familiar with all work done in the comparative philology of the classical languages, Sanskrit, and Celtic. His emendation of a corrupt word, <i>asageuonta</i>, in Bacchylides into <i>a&#333;teuonta</i> was at once accepted by the Greek scholar Richard Jebb.<br>
<br>Besides his professional work as a classical lecturer, as university lecturer on Sanskrit (a post to which he was appointed in 1883), and as the university instructor in that language for the Indian Civil Service (1886&#150;89; 1892&#150;1901), Neil took much interest in architecture and knew intimately the cathedrals of western Europe. He was interested in women's education, and before his college work became very heavy he lectured at both Girton and Newnham. Especially in work with individual students, his kindliness, care, and quiet humour attracted even the less scholarly. The sensitivity and breadth of his literary interest, which extended to much contemporary language and literature, ensured that he expounded prescribed texts in an engagingly humane manner, thereby complementing the strict linguistic demands of the classical tripos. He was popular in Cambridge society, and amid his duties regularly spared time to solve difficulties for his friends. As a long-standing syndic of Cambridge University Press, he helped many young scholars with advice as their work passed through the press. He also served for four years on the council of the senate.<br>
<br>Neil evidently retained a lifelong affection for Aberdeen University, encouraging its abler classical students in their quest for admission to Cambridge, notably James Adam. In 1891 Aberdeen University conferred upon him the honorary degree of LLD. Neil took a keen interest in Scottish history and literature, and was for long a member of the Franco-Scottish Society. In 1900, on the death of C. H. Prior, he became senior tutor of Pembroke. He died after a brief illness on 19 June 1901, and was buried in the churchyard at Bridge of Gairn, not far from his birthplace. He was unmarried. In appearance Neil was a little over average height and strongly built, with brown hair and large expressive eyes.<br>
