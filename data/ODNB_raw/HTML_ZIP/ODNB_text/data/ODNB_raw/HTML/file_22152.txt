<span class="headword">Phillips,  George</span>  (1804&#150;1892), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, third son of Francis Phillips, farmer, was born at Dunwich in Suffolk on 11 January 1804 and baptized at Westleton on 5 February. Soon afterwards the family moved to Otley, Suffolk. After spending his early years in farm work, and acquiring a knowledge of mathematics in his spare time, Phillips became a master at the grammar school in Woodbridge, and later at that in Worcester. While at Worcester he published his first works, <span class="italic">A Brief Treatise on the Use of a Case of Instruments</span> (1823) and <span class="italic">A Compendium of Algebra</span> (1824).<br>
<br>In 1824 Phillips left Worcester in order to enter Magdalen Hall, Oxford, on 19 June, but after a short residence migrated to Queens' College, Cambridge, on 25 October 1825. He won a scholarship in 1827 and graduated BA in 1829 with a first in mathematics. In 1830 he was elected fellow of his college and subsequently became senior tutor. He was ordained deacon in 1831 and priest in 1832, and received the degree of BD in 1839. In 1846 he was presented to the college living of Sandon in Essex. He proved himself an energetic parish priest; he built a school, restored the church, and improved the parsonage. On 10 August 1848 he married Emily Frances (<i>d</i>. 1898), younger daughter of Henry Pilkington, of Tore, co. Westmeath, Ireland; they had no children. He remained at Sandon until 1857 when, on the death of Joshua King, he was elected president of Queens' and returned to Cambridge, where he lived for the rest of his life. He was made a DD in 1859, and in 1861&#150;2 he was vice-chancellor of the university.<br>
<br>As a fellow of Queens', Phillips had at first continued to study mathematics, publishing <span class="italic">Summation of Series by Definite Integrals</span> in 1832, but soon turned to Hebrew, which he began to teach in the college, although there was then little interest in the subject at Cambridge. He decided that a knowledge of the cognate languages was necessary for a full understanding of Hebrew, and to facilitate this he wrote <span class="italic">The Elements of Syriac Grammar</span> in 1837 (2nd edn, 1845). In 1846 he published an elaborate <span class="italic">Critical Exegetical and Philological Commentary on the Psalms</span>, in two volumes (2nd edn, 1872). After his return to Cambridge he used his position to promote oriental studies in the university, and took a leading part in the establishment in 1872 of the Indian languages tripos and the Semitic languages tripos, examinations for which were first held in 1875. He published editions of several Syriac texts, and rewrote his earlier <span class="italic">Elements</span> as <span class="italic">A Syriac Grammar</span> (1866). Apart from his academic works, his only publication was <span class="italic">Short Sermons on Old Testament Messianic Texts</span> (1863). He was a staunch conservative, unwilling to accept contemporary developments in biblical criticism. As president of Queens' he was noted for his hospitality, and did much to promote the welfare of his college. He gave &pound;1000 to found a scholarship in 1887 and made a generous donation towards building the new chapel in 1891. Phillips died at his residence in Queens' on 5 February 1892. His funeral service was held in the college on the 11th, but his body was buried at Mullingar in co. Westmeath. His wife died on 14 August 1898.<br>
