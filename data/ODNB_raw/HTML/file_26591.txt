<span class="headword">Storer,  Anthony Morris</span>  (1746&#150;1799), <span class="occ">politician and collector</span>, was born on 12 March 1746, the eldest of two sons and two daughters of Thomas S. Storer (1717&#150;1793), West Indies planter, and Helen, daughter of Colonel James Guthrie. He was educated at Eton College (1754 to 1764), the Middle Temple (1762), and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (1764). His contemporaries at Eton included Charles James Fox, Lord Carlisle, William Eden, and Lord Fitzwilliam. At a time when one in ten Etonians reached the House of Commons, it was within this peer group that Storer pursued his career. He became connected with the macaronis, the fashionable young men of the late 1760s and early 1770s, alongside Fox, Carlisle, and James Hare.<br>
<br>Storer remained central to the fashionable London beau monde, a renowned dancer and skater who &#145;led the dancing world at balls and assemblies&#146;. As a socialite he was &#145;polite in his conversation, elegant in his manner, and amusing in a high degree&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 69/2). Lord Glenbervie commented he was &#145;considered to be a successful friend to many of the more fashionable ladies of that day&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries of Sylvester Douglas</span>, 2.349).<br>
<br>Unlike many of his fellow Etonians, Storer did not follow Fox politically. As he lacked the advantages of noble birth and political talent, he was dependent on benefactors for advancement. Lord Carlisle became his patron, and found parliamentary seats for him at Carlisle (1774&#150;80) and Morpeth (1780&#150;84). Though privately close to Fox, Storer adopted the position of Carlisle and his confidant George Selwyn as a court follower. He supported North's government from 1774, just as Fox went into opposition. Alongside Eden he assisted Carlisle on his official conciliatory mission to America in 1778. Publicly a devoted acolyte of North and his American measures, Storer appeared increasingly unenthusiastic in private, particularly when these seemed to threaten his West Indian interests. He had some &#145;compassion&#146; for the American rebels, and after the defeat at Yorktown he said of Fox's speech &#145;he convinced me &hellip; there surely must be some change or alteration in administration&#146;  (<span class="italic">Carlisle MSS</span>, 318, 542).<br>
<br>Much of this impatience with administration no doubt was due to personal frustration. Storer's Jamaican source of income all but dried up with the economic distress caused by a hurricane compounded by government's American policies. Horace Walpole reported &#145;the Storers are totally undone&#146; and Anthony was forced to call upon Carlisle's influence, and North's favour, to apply for a place at the Board of Trade  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 33.266). The ever indolent North took seven months to confer this position on 18 July 1781 and until the end of the year to grant his patent, before which he received no payment. Storer felt &#145;a spark of anger at his treatment&#146;, but he nevertheless voted with his ministry on all the key opposition attacks in 1781&#150;2. Selwyn was surprised at his &#145;tranquillity&#146; during the parliamentary crisis, even after North's fall  (<span class="italic">Carlisle MSS</span>, 477, 546). Indeed, Storer lost his place under Burke's <span class="roman">Civil List Bill</span>.<br>
<br>Storer had some reason to remain sanguine. He appears to have acted as intermediary in discussions between Fox and North during both men's opposition to Shelburne's ministry. When the Fox&#150;North coalition came to power in 1783, Storer was appointed secretary of the embassy at Paris on 21 September, and on 13 December was made minister-plenipotentiary. However, Storer had backed the wrong horse: the coalition fell only days later. Moreover, he had irrevocably offended the ever loyalist Carlisle, as he himself realized; &#145;this dissolution will certainly set me adrift&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal and Correspondence of &hellip; Auckland</span>, 1.76). He was not re-elected for Morpeth in 1784, and never regained a place in parliament. His long-time relationship with Carlisle was at an end&#151;no more letters passed between them. A reluctant speaker, though &#145;an excellent attender&#146;, he made one major speech for the ministry in November 1775, which gained &#145;no great commendations &hellip; but no abuse&#146;  (<span class="italic">Carlisle MSS</span>, 308, 306). He never spoke again. Selwyn despaired:&#145;Why won't he attempt to say something? What signifies knowing what Cicero said, and how he said it, if a man cannot open his mouth to deliver one sentiment of his own?&#146;  (ibid., 316). Yet it was this love of classical knowledge and literature which became Storer's consuming passion. Storer was an avid collector of books and prints. Walpole, whose collection of prints and portraits he viewed, was surprised at his &#145;being turned antiquary; the last patina I should have thought a Macaroni would have taken&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 35.359). Though he gambled&#151;like most of his contemporaries&#151;collecting was his major vice.<br>
<br>For a while Storer's financial position restricted his passion for collecting. In 1781 he reassured Carlisle that he had &#145;not had a book bound, nor spent a guinea in prints, the whole year&#146;, and that &#145;the lion you dread, and are afraid of awakening is perfectly at rest&#146;  (<span class="italic">Carlisle MSS</span>, 488&#150;9). After his father's death in 1793, his fortune was assured, and he could fully indulge his enthusiasm. He was already a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (1777), and in 1781 he joined the Society of Dilettanti. So noted was he in collecting and dealing circles that he appeared in Sandby's &#145;Sketches Taken at Print Sales&#146; in 1798. He amassed some 2800 books as well as prints (many by Joshua Reynolds) which he bequeathed to Eton College Library. The collection contains thirty-four incunabula, including three Caxtons and five of the Aldine incunabula. There are numerous first editions of Greek and Latin classics, Italian literature, and early English plays. There are 388 quartos of the last, as well as the first three folios of Shakespeare. A recent keeper at Eton called the collection &#145;the crowning glory&#146; of the library  (Quarrie, 44).<br>
<br>Storer bought Purley Magnor in Berkshire, worth &pound;5000 annually, with his inheritance. He laid out Purley Park with Humphry Repton, and left &pound;12,000&#150;&pound;15,000 for reconstructing the mansion. He remained unmarried, and died on 28 June 1799 at Hotwells, Bristol, after a &#145;deep decline&#146; and years of poor health  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He left property worth &pound;8000 annually to his nephew Anthony Gilbert, and bequeathed &pound;1000 to James Hare. He was buried on 7 July 1799 at St Mary the Virgin, Purley-on-Thames, Berkshire, commemorated by a monument by Nollekens. Sylvester Douglas, who knew Storer better than most in his final years, described him as &#145;ugly, active, graceful&#146;. He was &#145;of no distinction himself by birth, connections, office or any transcendent parts or talents. But, in society, when he chose, he was somewhat above par, and he made himself agreeable by showing his best side to Lord North&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries of Sylvester Douglas</span>, 2.349).<br>
