<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clutterbuck,  Henry</span>  (1767&#150;1856), <span class="occ">physician and medical writer</span>, was born at Marazion, Cornwall, on 28 January 1767, the fifth child of Thomas Clutterbuck (1728&#150;1781), a solicitor, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Christopher Masterman, a merchant of Truro. After attending the local grammar school Clutterbuck was apprenticed to James Kempe, a surgeon in Truro, whence, aged twenty-one, he entered the United Hospitals of Guy's and St Thomas's in London. On 7 August 1790 he passed as a member of the Company of Surgeons and settled to general practice at Walbrook in the City of London, where he soon prospered. This was helped by his publishing the <span class="italic">Medical and Surgical Review</span> between 1794 and 1807. In the journal, which appeared in alternate months, he &#145;proposed to give a summary view of all the books in the different branches of medicine in Great Britain and Ireland&#146;  (1794, 1.v). About twelve books were reviewed in each issue, and all the editorial work was done by Clutterbuck himself. In appearance Clutterbuck was above middle height with a striking florid complexion. He married, in 1796 at Walbrook church, Harriet Matilda (<i>d</i>. 1852), daughter of William Browne, a solicitor of Kirby Street, Hatton Garden. They had ten children, of whom four survived infancy.<br>
<br>Wishing to leave general practice and become a physician Clutterbuck spent 1802 studying in Edinburgh, but then transferred to Glasgow, where he graduated MD on 16 April 1804. He returned to London, setting up in practice at 17 St Paul's Churchyard. He wrote much about fevers, which he considered to be primarily an affection of the brain. His doctoral thesis was &#145;Tentamen pathologicum inaugurale quaedam de sede et natura febris proponens&#146; (1804), and he followed this with other books on the nature of fevers. Among his other writings was a youthful <span class="italic">Account of a New Method of Treating Affections which Arise from the Poison of Lead</span> (1794), <span class="italic">Remarks on some of the Opinions of the Late Mr John Hunter Respecting the Venereal Disease</span> (1799), and memoirs on Nathaniel Hulme (1810) and George Birkbeck (1842).<br>
<br>On 1 October 1804 Clutterbuck was admitted licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians and because of the regulations had to pay &pound;22 to disenfranchise himself from Surgeons' Hall. He moved to 1 The Crescent, New Bridge Street, Blackfriars, in 1808, and the next year was elected physician to the General Dispensary, Aldersgate Street, where he started a lucrative career as lecturer in medicine and materia medica. <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> (1850, 2.213) described his style as &#145;plain, forcible and unadorned&#146;. It is said that one year his lecturing earned him more than &pound;1000. With the foundation of the Aldersgate school of medicine in 1826 he transferred his lectures there, several of which were subsequently published. These included <span class="italic">On the Proper Administration of Blood-Letting for the Prevention and Cure of Disease</span> (1840) and <span class="italic">Series of Essays on Inflammation</span> (1846).<br>
<br>An individualist, in his youth Clutterbuck resigned from the Aldersgate dispensary when the governors tried to remove some voting privileges of the physicians. In 1809 he led a group that objected to the presidency of the Medical Society of London being perpetual, and late in life he declined a fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians on the grounds that many worthy people had not been elected.<br>
<br>Clutterbuck was very friendly with Lettsom, and inherited much of his practice. This flourished among the merchants and middle classes of London. He also attended several dispensaries and the Peckham Lunatic Asylum. Lettsom introduced him to the Medical Society of London, of which he was a member for more than fifty years and which he served as librarian and council member, and as president on three occasions. He was a model debater, who said nothing that he could not substantiate, who treated young members well, and who never lost his temper. On leaving the anniversary meeting of the society on 8 March 1856 he was run over in the street and died at his home at New Bridge Street, Blackfriars, on 24 April 1856. He was buried at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
