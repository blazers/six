<span class="headword">Laing,  Samuel</span>  (1780&#150;1868), <span class="occ">author and traveller</span>, son of Robert Laing (<i>d</i>. 1805), a merchant and provost of Kirkwall in 1788&#150;92, of an old Orkney family and younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15890/', "Malcolm Laing")</script>, was born at Kirkwall, Orkney, on 4 October 1780. He was educated at Kirkwall grammar school and the University of Edinburgh. Leaving Edinburgh without a degree about 1797, he spent eighteen months at Kiel in Schleswig-Holstein studying German. In 1805 he entered the army as an ensign in the staff corps stationed at Hythe and with which he served in the Peninsular War. He returned to Britain in 1809, sold out from the army, and, through his brother's influence, was appointed manager of mines at Wanlockhead, in southern Scotland. In March that year he married Agnes (<i>d</i>. 1812), daughter of Captain Francis Kelly of Kelly. Shortly before her death they had a daughter, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1809), and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15892/', "Samuel Laing")</script>. In 1818 he returned to Orkney where he successfully organized the coastal herring fishery for a London firm. When his brother died childless in 1818, he inherited the heavily encumbered estates at Strynzia or Strenzie, Orkney. He lived at Kirkwall, of which he was for some years provost, and was engaged in the reduction of kelp to alkali for glass manufacture.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1832&#150;3 Laing unsuccessfully contested Orkney and Shetland as a radical, and in his <span class="italic">Address to the Electors</span> (1833) accused the lord advocate of interfering on his opponent's behalf. Reduced to comparative poverty by the development in 1832 of synthetic alkali which ended demand for kelp and ruined many in the west highlands and islands, he left Orkney in 1834. He lived in Norway from 1834 to 1836 and visited Sweden in 1838, the previous death of his wife, the marriage of his daughter, the successful start in his career of his son, and the departure after a quarrel of his wife's sister Mary who had kept house for him, leaving him unencumbered by domestic responsibilities. His widely read accounts of his journeys were less travel books than works of political economy and attracted notices comparing him to Arthur Young and von Humboldt. In <span class="italic">Journal of a Residence in Norway</span> (1836) he gave unqualified praise to the free, upright Norwegian peasantry. His praise accorded with his own belief that a relatively egalitarian distribution of property led to a virtuous society and with the tendency in nineteenth-century Norway to idealize the peasantry, through whose veins was thought to course the moral and economic lifeblood of the nation. The Norwegians were praised not only in their own right, but as ancestors of the British and the origin of all that was healthy, vigorous, free, democratic, upright, and decisive in the British character&#151;qualities that enabled Britons to range the world as the vikings had done. Laing declares that among the Norwegian people &#145;may be traced the germ of all the free institutions which distinguish the British constitution at the present day&#146; and of Norse literature, &#145;It is in these Saga, not in Tacitus, that we have to look for the origin of the political institutions of England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, preface, 365). The central Gothic virtue according to Laing, and the source of Norway's political freedom, economic enterprise, judicial probity, and cultural richness, is <i>udal</i> inheritance: partible inheritance with freehold, heritable tenure, familiar to Laing from the Orkneys and Shetland. His experience as a younger son colours his judgement, but he argues effectively and grounds his views in Norse history, as then known, and modern political economy, notably the ideas of Malthus.<br>
<br>Laing's <span class="italic">Tour in Sweden</span> (1839) was as critical of Sweden as the earlier book was enthusiastic about Norway, despite the similarities between the two countries. His criticism stemmed in part from his sympathy with the Norwegians, who in 1814 had been compelled to exchange Danish rule for personal union with Sweden, and in part from his use of the comprehensive Swedish statistics on crime, illegitimacy, and poverty which led him to conclude that the Swedes lived &#145;in a more demoralised state than any nation in Europe&#146;  (S. Laing, <span class="italic">Tour in Sweden</span>, 1839, 108), even while admitting that these findings did not accord with his own observations. He reserved his fiercest criticism for the ubiquitous state and state church whose hold over the people was judged insidious and evil. While Norway has retained its Gothic heritage and is egalitarian and democratic, Sweden has betrayed its, to adopt a system based on arbitrary power, empty deference, outdated privilege, and preference for fine over useful arts. Sweden &#145;wants the very foundation upon which civil liberty must stand&#151;a sense of independence and property among the people&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sweden</span>, 274). If Norway taught Britons to rejoice in their Gothic heritage, Sweden served as an awful warning to Britons if they betrayed theirs. His grossly partisan account was widely accepted, for example by James Kay-Shuttleworth who agreed with Laing's opinion that in the degenerate Swedish social system &#145;some of the worst institutions of feudalism corrupt a people aroused from the incurious apathy of the middle ages&#146;  (Kay-Shuttleworth, 215). Count Magnus Bj&ouml;rnstjerna, Swedish ambassador to St James, responded with a pamphlet <span class="italic">On the Moral State and Political Union of Sweden and Norway</span> (1840) to which Laing published a trenchant rejoinder in the <span class="italic">Monthly Chronicle</span> (November, 1840), reprinted in <span class="italic">Notes of a Traveller</span> (1842). Much of the latter book was devoted to Prussia whose people Laing likened to slaves. A German translation of this section by Adolf Heller appeared in Mannheim in 1844. Laing made a similar judgement on the Austrians and Neapolitans. Laing's purpose in these sweeping judgements on various peoples was always to analyse the political and economic r&eacute;gimes in operation in each country, not to point to any inherent or &#145;natural&#146; characteristics of the people.<br>
<br>Laing turned to literary work, publishing his acclaimed translation of Snorri Sturluson's <span class="italic">Heimskringla</span> or chronicle of the kings of Norway (3 vols., 1840). According to Wawn it would be &#145;difficult to exaggerate the importance of Laing's 1844 volumes in awakening Victorian Britain to the turbulent history of the old north&#146;  (Wawn, &#145;Laing&#146;, 35). His lengthy introduction was a passionate restatement of the Gothic views expressed in his travel books. The translation was an important part of the Victorian revival of interest in the northern lands as a source of literary richness and political inspiration, and as a destination for growing numbers of literary tourists. It remained in print in various editions until the 1990s. A revised version edited by Rasmus B. Anderson (4 vols., 1889) cuts some of Laing's wilder notes to the text and makes revisions based on recent historical and literary scholarship; it also contains a biographical memoir with information from Laing's children. Mistrust of the Roman Catholic church, evident from his <span class="italic">Notes of a Traveller</span>, led Laing to oppose the Maynooth grant and to write critically in 1845 of the pilgrimage of one and a half million people to see the alleged holy coat at Trier. He returned to travel and in <span class="italic">Observations on &hellip; the European People</span> (1850) admitted some of the disadvantages of peasant proprietorship. For this he was reproached with inconsistency by J. S. Mill who, influenced by <span class="italic">Residence in Norway</span>, had argued in favour of that mode of land tenure in his own <span class="italic">Political Economy</span>. Laing's <span class="italic">Observations on &hellip; Denmark and the Duchies</span> (1852) showed a similar retreat from his earlier radical views.<br>
<br>Laing spent the rest of his life in Edinburgh, where he died at the house of his daughter, Elizabeth Baxter, who had been widowed in 1837, on 23 April 1868. He was buried in the Dean cemetery. Laing was acclaimed in his lifetime as &#145;Britain's foremost philosophical travel writer&#146;  (Wawn, <span class="italic">Vikings and the Victorians</span>, 106) and some 150 years later there was a revival of interest in him by writers on travel and travel writing and their connection with literature. The editor of his lately discovered autobiography was behind the erection of a plaque commemorating Laing on Papdale House, Papdale, Orkney. Fereday considers Laing &#145;a man who was seldom troubled by self doubt&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 13). Many of Laing's judgements are egregiously partisan, but at least in part because of this enthusiasm, his writings continue to entertain and inform debate on Scandinavia, and peasant proprietorship and its relation to population growth and poverty.<br>
