<span class="headword">Lee,  Lennox Bertram</span>  (1864&#150;1949), <span class="occ">textile industrialist</span>, was born on 7 November 1864 at 2 Camp Place, Camp Street, Broughton, Salford, the eldest son of the eight children of Sir Joseph Cocksey Lee (1832&#150;1894), cotton spinner and merchant, and his wife, Henrietta Burleigh (<i>d</i>. 1922), daughter of James Hill, Independent minister at Clapham, London. He was educated at Thorpe Mandeville School and Eton College before serving in the Sherwood Foresters (1883&#150;5), and travelling extensively in Africa. In 1889 Lee joined the Rossendale Printing Company, a family firm, which in 1899 he took into the Calico Printers' Association (CPA). This amalgamation brought together forty-six printing firms and thirteen merchants to form what was then the United Kingdom's largest company. Having rapidly acquired a reputation as one of the trade's leading practical men, Lee joined the CPA executive, and became its chairman in 1902. The CPA's initial performance proved disappointing, but under Lee's guidance the size of the board was reduced from an unwieldy eighty-four, nearly one-third of the original capacity was closed down, competition was limited by inter-firm agreements, and a research department was set up.<br>
<br>Following these successes, Lee was the undisputed choice as chairman of the board in 1908, a position he held until 1947, an unusual longevity within the corporate economy. By 1914 Lee had again reformed the CPA management and marketing structures, even if the company's main aim remained price stability through trade agreements and reduced capacity rather than the aggressive pursuit of growth. This conservative strategy allowed the CPA to share in the cotton industry's Edwardian summer, outwardly demonstrated by the opening of its new offices, the St James Building, Oxford Street, Manchester, in 1912, then the largest steel-framed building in Britain.<br>
<br>The First World War was a stark reminder to Lee that the textile industry faced threats from two directions: that of the home government, and that of foreign competition, principally from India and Japan. Lee was a thoroughly reluctant participant in government schemes to produce British dyes to replace German and Swiss ones, wholly disbelieving in the power of the official mind to intervene efficaciously in business concerns. On the other hand, he was prepared to serve on several committees, and to back the British Trade Corporation (1916&#150;26) in its ill-fated schemes for commercial expansion. After the war, however, he became an insistent advocate of business as usual, leading efforts to repeal the <span class="roman">Dyestuffs Act</span> of 1920. More positively, Lee recognized the drastic need for his own firm, as for the cotton industry as a whole, to adjust in order to survive, as both the volume and the profitability of British trade slumped in the 1920s. But adaptation posed a dilemma which the CPA failed satisfactorily to resolve&#151;namely was it to remain merely a congeries of family firms, effecting some economies of scale while maintaining its traditional role of printing goods on commission for &#145;merchant-convertors&#146;, or was it, as Lee wished, to become a large, centrally controlled and vertically integrated modern enterprise, producing, printing, and merchanting its own cloth? The company oscillated between these strategies, continuing the process of internal rationalization, but achieving only limited success in its attempt at vertical integration, specialist finishes, and direct-selling schemes.<br>
<br>With keen foresight, Lee also pioneered direct investment abroad, with printworks in China in 1928, in Egypt in 1934, and in India in 1936, followed by Java, Australia, and South Africa during the Second World War. Ironically, this strategy, which Lee had urged in the First World War, reached fruition only in the Second, while the excessive devolution of control abroad, favoured by the board, but not by Lee, squandered the CPA's opportunity to prosper as a truly multinational company. The CPA's defensive mentality was further confirmed in 1941, when following the major discovery of Terylene in its laboratories, it allowed ICI to develop this product under licence. The lucrative royalties from Terylene, however, gave Lee the satisfaction of restoring dividend payments (suspended since 1929) in 1947, the year in which he also resigned as chairman, having ensured the succession of his son, R. M. Lee (1902&#150;1972). A tall, stately figure, whose goatee beard lent the mien of a Spanish grandee, Lee ultimately proved far more autocratic in manner than decisive in business strategy.<br>
<br>After the First World War, Lee continued to act as an important custodian and outspoken defender of Lancashire traditions and interests. In the 1920s he did so from within the Federation of British Industry, first as its Manchester chairman, and in 1929&#150;30 as its president. In that role, and as a consistent free trader, he briefly held back the FBI's accelerating drift towards protection. He served on the influential Macmillan committee, urging in an addendum to the main report the need both for industrial rationalization and for close co-operation with trade unions, a reflection of his involvement in negotiations between employers and the TUC in the wake of the Mond&#150;Turner talks. In the economic crisis of 1929&#150;31 Lee resisted tariffs as likely to undermine, rather than encourage, the rationalization of industry, although throughout the 1930s he advocated an important role for government in backing up collective regulation by business.<br>
<br>With Manchester public life holding little attraction, Lee preferred to retreat to his Herefordshire estate at How Caple. He had lived there since 1901 with his wife, Edith Gertrude (<i>d</i>. 1964), daughter of Malcolm MacLellan of Glasgow, whom he married on 21 June 1892, and their three children. He played an active part in county society, reared pigs, and took a keen interest in the welfare of the Church of England and the architectural beauties of its buildings, especially as a benefactor of Hereford Cathedral. Lee died at home at How Caple Court on 14 December 1949 and was buried at How Caple. He had lived to see the jubilee of the CPA and oversee the publication of its history, itself a revealing chronicle of the frustrated vision and dynastic tenacity which had marked, and marred, his career.<br>
