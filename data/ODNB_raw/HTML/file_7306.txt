<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Davison,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1608), <span class="occ">diplomat and administrator</span>, presents a number of biographical problems. Sir James Melville of Halhill recorded that Davison told him that he &#145;was com of Scotismen and was a Scotisman at hart&#146;, but hardly anything is known about his background or his personal life  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of His Own Life</span>, 328). His parents cannot be identified, although a brother is mentioned in a letter of 1583, and he left his sister Anne, who married a John Carpenter, an annuity in his will. He is found in no extant university or inns of court records, and all that can be said of his education is that he was fluent in French as well as Latin.<br>
<br>About 1570 Davison married Catherine, daughter of Francis Spelman, a minor Norfolk squire, and his wife, Mary Hill, daughter of Elizabeth Isley, who married first Richard Hill and then Sir John Mason. Elizabeth Isley was also first cousin to Jane Guildford, the mother of Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester (1532/3&#150;1588), who always addressed Davison as &#145;cousin Davison&#146;. Davison's wife predeceased him, but they had six children who lived to adulthood&#151;two daughters and four sons. His eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7300/', "Francis Davison (1573/4&#150;1613x19)")</script>, enjoyed a contemporary reputation as a poet, while a younger son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7305/', "Walter Davison (1581?&#150;1602x8)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7300/', "Davison, Francis (1573/&#150;1613x)")</script>], followed a military career.<h2>
<a name="TheDavisonpapers"></a>The Davison papers</h2>There is also a technical reason why Davison the man remains relatively obscure. In 1619 the keeper of the state paper office, Sir Thomas Wilson, discovered that Davison's papers had been sold to the manuscript collector Ralph Starkey. Since Starkey obtained papers of Francis Davison as well, it has been assumed that Francis was the seller. However, Wilson recorded that Starkey bought them from Davison's son-in-law W[illiam] Duncombe. Wilson claimed that the papers were Davison's secretarial papers and therefore belonged in the paper office. He obtained a warrant from the privy council to seize them on 10 August 1619, and four days later he removed &#145;a sackfull of papers to the number of 45 pacquets&#146; from Starkey's house, which he later had bound &#145;into bookes with the rest&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 286, fol. 286<i>r</i>, TNA: PRO, SP 45/20/99). However, not all the papers he obtained were Davison's, nor did he obtain all of Starkey's Davison papers, for a sizeable body is now found among the Harley manuscripts. Together with the rest of Starkey's collection they were bought by Symonds D'Ewes in 1628. D'Ewes's library in turn was purchased by Humfrey Wanley on behalf of Robert Harley in 1703&#150;6.<br>
<br>Elizabethan diplomatic practice was largely a matter of personal preference. Davison does not appear to have used letter-books, but he retained drafts (minutes) of his out-letters as well as the original letters received, and his papers form one of the richest sources for Elizabethan diplomacy between 1575 and 1586. Without them the state papers for that period (particularly the state papers, foreign) would be greatly reduced. However, the papers have also been weeded of the more obviously personal material, presumably when they were sold to Starkey. Some of Davison's surviving correspondence can legitimately be described as private, but for all its size the collection sheds relatively little light on his personal life.<h2>
<a name="Initialdiplomaticcareer15741576"></a>Initial diplomatic career, 1574&#150;1576</h2>By 1574 Davison was one of Francis Walsingham's confidential men of business. Thanks to the disappearance of Walsingham's own private papers, the origin of their association (and whether Davison served with him during his embassy to France in 1570&#150;73) is unknown. The relationship is nevertheless the key to Davison's career. Melville recorded that he first met Davison when he &#145;was at my house in company with Sir Harry Killigrew, my auld friend, when he was resident in Scotland&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of His Own Life</span>, 360). Nicholas Harris Nicolas, unaware of Killigrew's later embassies to Scotland when writing his biography of Davison, assumed the meeting occurred during Killigrew's embassy in June and July 1566, a date that has been accepted since. However, this is an error, not least because in June 1566 Melville was sent to Elizabeth I to announce the birth of James VI.<br>
<br>The association between Davison and Killigrew began when Walsingham attached Davison to Killigrew's embassy to Scotland in May 1574, and this was undoubtedly the occasion when Davison met Melville. Killigrew was effusive in his thanks to Walsingham for Davison's services, and he and Davison became close friends as a result. When Davison returned to London in July with a confidential memorandum Walsingham described him as &#145;a man of his whom he lent Mr. Killigrew&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1574&#150;81</i>, art. 25). Davison accompanied Killigrew to Scotland again in the following summer. This time Killigrew was instructed to leave Davison as resident agent in Scotland if he considered one necessary. However, this embassy never got beyond Berwick, for its arrival coincided with the border incident known as the Reidswire raid, of 7 July 1575. Davison did little more than act as a messenger for Killigrew, who nevertheless brought him to Leicester's attention, as &#145;a gentleman who has married a kinswoman of your lordship's, though unknown, I think, yet to you&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1574&#150;81</i>, arts. 179, 184).<br>
<br>Six months later Davison was sent on his first independent mission. In January 1576 Elizabeth had been offered the sovereignty of Holland and Zeeland, which she was unwilling to accept if a broader settlement in the Netherlands could be arranged. Philip II's governor-general, Don Luis de Requesens, died on 5 March, and at the end of the month Elizabeth sent Davison to the council of state in Brussels to see if it would now grant a ceasefire. If it was willing he was then to obtain William of Orange's adherence. When he arrived at Brussels in April, Davison was informed that the council could not offer a ceasefire without Philip's prior approval. His own assessment was that it was interested only in bringing the siege of Zierickzee to a successful conclusion. On 23 April, Walsingham informed him that in view of the attitude in Brussels he may as well return, and he left early in May.<h2>
<a name="TheNetherlandsembassiesof15771579"></a>The Netherlands embassies of 1577&#150;1579</h2>At the beginning of 1577 the most mysterious of Davison's embassies took place. Thanks to a single reference in February 1577 to Davison's coming from Zeeland with Orange's agent Charles de Li&eacute;vin, sieur de Famars, Professor G. M. Bell has suggested that he may have undertaken a short mission to Orange then. His surmise is confirmed by a letter from Leicester to Orange of 7 March, which notes that, in sending Famars, Orange had followed advice from Leicester passed to him by Davison, &#145;l'advis que je vous ay donn&eacute; par Monsr Davison&#146;  (Kervyn de Lettenhove, 9, art. 3383). There are numerous other references to Davison's acting as an intermediary between Orange and England in spring 1577, and he is not known to have met him on any prior occasion. The mission also marked the beginning of Davison's association with Leicester, and it is just possible that he was sent privately by the earl rather than officially by the queen. In May, Leicester asked Davison to draft letters in French to Orange and his wife thanking them for naming him godfather to their daughter.<br>
<br>In August 1577 Davison was sent to the Netherlands as resident agent with a daily allowance of &pound;1 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., a post he held until May 1579. Dr Thomas Wilson had served as agent between November 1576 and June 1577, but it is not clear whether he was to be replaced as a matter of course. Davison was appointed in July after the news of Don Juan of Austria's seizure of Namur was received. His instructions (26 July, finalized 2 August) provided a cover story that he had been appointed before Namur to replace Wilson as resident with Don Juan. However, his real purpose was to assure the states general that Elizabeth would support them if Don Juan attempted a reconquest by force and &#145;covertly as of yourself&#146; advise them to accept the leadership of Orange  (BL, Harley MS 285, fols. 44<i>r</i>&#150;45<i>r</i>). He was also expected to co-ordinate the still vague plans for English military assistance to Orange under Leicester's command. Leicester later wrote, &#145;my desire of your going was chiefly to deal with him [Orange] therein&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1577&#150;8</i>, 308).<br>
<br>Davison arrived in Antwerp on 10 August and immediately reported that Don Juan was determined on reconquest with the enterprise of England as his ultimate aim. In this and later assessments Davison consistently argued that the Netherlands was the key to English security, and that he was confident that the strength of the Dutch cities would make reconquest difficult. An embassy under Charles Philippe de Croye, marquis de Havr&eacute;, was sent to Elizabeth in September and negotiated the terms for English assistance. At that point it was feared that Henri Guise, third duc de Guise, might come to Don Juan's aid. It was decided that the Leicester expedition would be sent if Guise intervened. At the end of September, Leicester asked Davison to arrange for Orange to request his expedition immediately in order to capitalize on Elizabeth's willingness to act. However, in early October the states general decided that they would not need the English army until the following spring.<br>
<br>On 19 September, Orange arrived in Antwerp, and Davison accompanied him on his famous entry into Brussels three days later. He now argued that Orange offered an opportunity to create a friendly Netherlands government that should not be missed. Yet he also noted the impending arrival of the Archduke Mathias of Austria. Davison was careful in his reporting&#151;once a week was expected&#151;but delays in communication, the apparent rejection of English aid, and the preference for Mathias over Orange as a replacement governor-general for Don Juan made London fretful. On 27 October, Davison supplied a calmly argued assessment that the appointment of Mathias might have its advantages. However, on 15 November he attributed the rejection of English aid to jealousy of Orange.<br>
<br>On 4 November the states general complained to Davison that according to Havr&eacute; (who had remained in England) his reports of dissension in the Netherlands had discouraged Elizabeth. Later in the month Leicester warned him of complaints (probably also from Havr&eacute;) that &#145;you only follow the prince&#146;, while still noting that Davison was &#145;my especial agent to him&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1577&#150;8</i>, art. 453). Davison replied that his original commission was not to the states general, and &#145;there is scarce any other with whom I may frankly deal&#146;  (ibid., art. 461).<br>
<br>In December, Elizabeth tried for a final time to arrange a mediated settlement with Philip, while at the same time returning Havr&eacute; to Brussels with proposals for military assistance if necessary. Her efforts at mediation were conducted by a series of special envoys, and Davison could only pass on Orange's opinion that they would be fruitless. His own embassy was now reshaped by three events: the queen's decision in late January to postpone the Leicester expedition in favour of more indirect forms of financial and military assistance, Don Juan's defeat of the army of the states at Gembloux on 31 January 1578, and the intervention of Fran&ccedil;ois, duc d'Anjou, in February. On 8 March he sent Walsingham a long analysis of the situation, in which he attributed Dutch interest in Anjou to Elizabeth's hesitation. Elizabeth could not abandon the Dutch, and it made more sense to aid them openly. Walsingham showed the memorandum to Elizabeth, and it was &#145;greatly approved by her touching the manner, but as for the matter she takes daily less taste thereof&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1577&#150;8</i>, arts. 676, 714).<br>
<br>Davison's position now became awkward. He informed Leicester privately that he would make sure it was known that &#145;this change succeeded againste the desire of your lordship&#146;  (Kervyn de Lettenhove, 10, art. 3820). On 18 April the states general informed him officially that they were negotiating with Anjou, and he warned them Elizabeth would react badly. At the same time he faced further accusations that he had not defended Elizabeth's decisions over military aid but had agreed with her Dutch critics, that he had complained that the instructions he received were &#145;fonde and childish&#146;, and that he was too much in Orange's pocket  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1577&#150;8</i>, art. 835). Walsingham advised him to cease sending his own opinions and confine himself to reporting the facts. Thomas Wilkes also warned him that his criticisms had alienated men he thought were his friends. One may have been William Cecil, Baron Burghley, for in December 1578 Davison was concerned that the lord treasurer had not answered his letters for six months.<br>
<br>Elizabeth's response to the Anjou negotiations was to send Walsingham and William Brooke, tenth Baron Cobham, as special envoys to the Netherlands. They arrived at the end of June, and until Walsingham returned to England in early October, Davison was very much his subordinate. In mid-March, Davison had been sent the authority to raise loans to the value of &pound;100,000, which Elizabeth had agreed to supply to the states general. In May he was sent an instalment of &pound;20,000 in bullion. However, he was not to disburse it until the result of the negotiations with Anjou was known, and in July he was ordered to retain custody of both the authority and the bullion until instructed by Walsingham and Cobham.<br>
<br>After Walsingham's departure Davison became involved in the clash between Orange and the Calvinist radicals of Ghent, in which John-Casimir of the Palatinate (whose army Elizabeth had funded) supported the <i>gantois</i>. Worried both by rumours that Casimir was acting on the queen's behalf and the possible effects of an open rebuke to Casimir from Elizabeth herself, Walsingham instructed Davison on his own authority to persuade Casimir to withdraw. Davison's encounter with Casimir took place in Ghent on 8 November; it was a stormy one and Casimir immediately complained to London. Although London backed Davison, Leicester in December sent Casimir's friend Daniel Rogers to calm him down. On the night of 10 January 1579 Davison, Orange, and Casimir were formally reconciled&#151;though with more carousing than Davison would have liked.<br>
<br>The future of Davison's posting appears to have depended on the imperial offer to mediate between the states general and Philip, which resulted in the Cologne conference of summer 1579. On 19 January Walsingham informed Davison that if Elizabeth sent a delegation he would be included. Davison was now exhausted and ill and looking forward to his recall. Elizabeth hesitated for several months, but finally (after Davison had been deliberately excluded from the Cologne conference) she sent him his recall in mid-April. His last months were spent in tidying up and forwarding the paperwork over her loans to the states general. When he returned in May, he brought with him the Burgundian jewels that the states general had deposited as security with him and Walsingham in summer 1578.<br>
<br>Sufficient correspondence survives from this embassy to give some idea of Davison's personal circumstances. His wife joined him in Antwerp with his son &#145;Frank&#146; in November 1577  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1575&#150;7</i>, art. 1367). Another child (possibly a daughter) was born there in summer 1578. Most of his private correspondence consists of letters received, chiefly from Henry Killigrew, but also his wife's cousin Edward Cheke, Walsingham's secretary Laurence Tomson, John Stubbe, and Thomas Randolph. Together they arranged for the appointment of the presbyterian Walter Travers as chaplain to the Merchant Adventurers in Antwerp in early 1578. This now celebrated affair embittered Davison's relations with Nicholas Loddington, the governor of the Merchant Adventurers, who complained to Walsingham. Walsingham in turn ordered Davison firmly &#145;to forbear further proceeding therein&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1577&#150;8</i>, art. 852). Davison's letters reveal a dry and sardonic humour, but also a somewhat fastidious disapproval of Dutch drinking habits, even those of his hero Orange.<h2>
<a name="Scottishembassies15821584"></a>Scottish embassies, 1582&#150;1584</h2>Although he kept up his correspondence with his friends in the Netherlands, Davison was not employed there again until 1584. In July 1580 Elizabeth proposed to send him to Orange, but then changed her mind. On 19 January 1579 he was appointed clerk of the treasury and <i>custos brevium</i> (keeper of the writs) of the court of king's bench for life. He had sued for this office in mid-1578, but Elizabeth took some persuading because she did not think it would &#145;serve your present necessity&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1578&#150;9</i>, arts. 356, 459). A further preferment was discussed with his friends in the winter of 1582&#150;3, but it was not specified. Of his other personal affairs, all that is known is the birth of his son Christopher in December 1581 and the appointment of Sir Christopher Hatton and the baby's maternal great-grandmother, Lady Mason, as godparents.<br>
<br>In 1582 and 1584 Davison was employed in two special missions to Scotland, both dealing with the aftermath of the Ruthven raid of 20 August 1582, in which a group of protestant nobles had separated James VI from his favourite, Esm&eacute; Stewart, first duke of Lennox. Elizabeth's government was anxious to stabilize the new Scottish administration and prevent the French from trying to restore Lennox. The situation was made particularly awkward by the apparent Anglo-French co-operation in support of Anjou in the Netherlands. In November, Henri III sent the former ambassador to England, Bertrand de Salignac, sieur de la Mothe-F&eacute;nelon, first to London and then Edinburgh, with instructions to free James if he was a captive (as Mary, queen of Scots, claimed), negotiate a general reconciliation, and arrange for Lennox to retire to France. Although Elizabeth could not refuse him a passport, the English were suspicious that his purpose was to revive French influence. Although these fears were exaggerated, in December, Davison was given the task of escorting him to Scotland.<br>
<br>This mission had its comic aspects. Initially Davison was to try to delay F&eacute;nelon until Lennox had left Scotland. As it turned out they encountered Lennox on his way south between Topcliffe and Northallerton, Yorkshire, on 27 December. The day was so stormy that Lennox and F&eacute;nelon spoke only briefly and Davison could not follow all they said. He also spent much time surreptitiously checking F&eacute;nelon's baggage for hidden money, as it was believed that he was bringing funds to bribe the Scots nobility. They entered Scotland in early January 1583, and F&eacute;nelon had his audience with James on the 18th. Robert Bowes was already in place in Scotland and Davison, considering himself superfluous, expected to return to London with F&eacute;nelon at the end of the month. However, under instructions now missing, he was ordered to remain with Bowes, thanks presumably to the arrival of a second French agent, Fran&ccedil;ois de Roncherolles, sieur de Maineville, who had sailed directly to Scotland. At the beginning of March, Davison pressed again for his revocation, as he considered that Bowes, even if he could not speak French, was able to handle Maineville on his own. His recall was finally granted on 14 March, and he left Scotland at the beginning of April.<br>
<br>Davison's second Scottish embassy was a more serious affair. James escaped from the Ruthvenites on 29 June 1583 and turned to the protestant, if mercenary, James Stewart, earl of Arran. During the winter of 1583&#150;4 a number of the nobles and clergy associated with the Ruthven regime organized a conspiracy to overthrow Arran. They were forced into action prematurely, and on 17 April some of the lords took possession of Stirling Castle, only to abandon it on the 23rd and retire to England. On 25 April, Davison was instructed to mediate between them and James, but he was also provided with &pound;2000 to disburse if he found them in &#145;reasonable probability&#146; to &#145;prevayle ageynst thos that does now abuse bothe the kings eare and his authority&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 286, fol. 48<i>r</i>). By the time he reached Berwick he had learned of the surrender of Stirling and did not enter Scotland. James now demanded that Elizabeth return the fugitives, and on 15 May, Davison was instructed to inform him that she considered the lords victims rather than rebels and would not hand them over. On 5 June he had an inconclusive audience with James at Falkland Palace in Fife and then retired to Edinburgh. In Edinburgh he was informed that the constable of Edinburgh Castle, Alexander Erskine, the master of Mar, was sympathetic to the exiled lords, and he became involved in an ultimately abortive scheme to persuade Erskine to rebel.<br>
<br>In the face of this stalemate Elizabeth now permitted Henry Carey, first Baron Hunsdon, the captain of Berwick, to revive what was known as the &#145;by-course&#146;, a scheme of his own devising to reach an understanding with Arran. At the end of June a meeting between the two was agreed. Davison, who was convinced that the by-course was a waste of time, wanted to be relieved, not least because he was worried that his own involvement with Erskine might be exposed. Walsingham was willing but the queen, who had doubts about the by-course, preferred that he stay and keep an eye on things. Davison was not present at Hunsdon's meeting with Arran at Foulden, near Berwick, on 13 August, but his open scepticism came to the notice of Hunsdon, who accused him of trying to sabotage the by-course out of jealousy. However, on 1 September, Davison was granted his recall, and he left Edinburgh on the 15th.<h2>
<a name="Netherlandsembassies15841586"></a>Netherlands embassies, 1584&#150;1586</h2>Less than a month after his return from Scotland, Davison was sent on the most important embassy of his career. Following the assassination of Orange in July, Elizabeth had rejected a Dutch request for unilateral aid in favour of joint action with France. The Dutch had then agreed to accept Henri III as their sovereign, but he showed little interest either in co-operation with England or in the Dutch cause in general. On 10 October the privy council formally debated Netherlands policy and advised Elizabeth that she could not allow them to be reconquered. As a preliminary measure a &#145;man of skill&#146; was to be sent to assess the situation, and on the 11th Walsingham informed Davison that he had been chosen. As it turned out he did not leave for a month, possibly owing to the queen's illness at the end of October. His letters of credence were signed on the 31st, but his instructions were not ready until 13 November. His main task was to discover the state of the Franco-Dutch negotiations. If Henri &#145;hath undertaken the action for their defence ether as protector or possessioner&#146;, Elizabeth would proceed no further. If he had not, then Davison was to assure them of her assistance upon reasonable conditions. If asked about the &#145;particularities of the cautions [security] desired by us&#146; he was to let them know off the record that she would expect at least the occupation of Flushing and the Brill  (TNA: PRO, SP 83/23/115&#150;7).<br>
<br>Davison left London about 13 or 14 November, but owing to bad weather did not reach Middelburg until the 21st. When he had his audience with the states general on the 28th he was greeted with suspicion in the belief that he had been sent to disrupt the French negotiations. At a later private meeting with some of the leading deputies, he told them he was not ordered to &#145;brouiller&#146; the French treaty, but Elizabeth had reason to believe that Henri was not serious  (Algemeen Rijksarchief, The Hague, 1.01.01.01.90A, art. 4). On 27 December, Walsingham instructed him to wait in The Hague until the Franco-Dutch negotiations were concluded. The states of Holland (who were not very enthusiastic about the French treaty) provided him with generous accommodation in the Wassenaar Hof on the Kneuterdijk. In the absence of his personal papers the composition of his household in The Hague is unknown, with one very interesting exception&#151;William Brewster, the future leader of the Pilgrim Fathers of Plymouth, Massachusetts. Brewster was a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Davison; he was the &#145;young Bruster&#146; for whom he sought to obtain the postmastership at Scroby, Nottinghamshire, in 1590  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1581&#150;90</i>, 686).<br>
<br>The Dutch embassy to France had left just before Davison arrived, but they had a difficult journey and did not reach Paris until 1 February 1585. On the 18th the privy council informed him that the Dutch were not making any headway, and &#145;as of yourself&#146; he was to encourage them to look to England  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1584&#150;5</i>, 287&#150;8). News that Henri had rejected the proposed treaty reached London on 6 March. Walsingham informed Davison on the following day, and two days later (9 March) he sent Edward Burnham with an outline of the terms of Elizabeth's assistance. Burnham reached Davison on the 17th, and on the 30th the terms were presented to the states general. By 10 May most of the provinces had agreed to send an embassy to England but Zeeland proved awkward, and it was only on the 21st that it was brought round. Davison had intended returning with the Dutch embassy, but in view of the delays the states suggested he go first, and he left about 27 May. The Dutch embassy received its instructions only then; it had a difficult passage and did not reach Margate until 24 June.<br>
<br>When the Dutch arrived Davison was summoned to court, and during July he played an important subordinate role in the negotiations as translator, escort, and resident expert. His translating appears to have been purely into French&#151;how much Dutch he knew remains a mystery. The negotiations launched him into the most complicated of his embassies. There was a large gap on both military and political levels between what the Dutch wanted and what Elizabeth would give. The Dutch held an advantage because they would not cede Flushing&#151;the main town Elizabeth wanted as a caution&#151;for an army of fewer than 5000 foot and 1000 horse. The stalemate was broken by an initial compromise, a provisional treaty for the relief of Antwerp, signed on 2 August. Under this treaty, Elizabeth would supply 4000 foot for three months to help to break the siege of Antwerp. She was to be repaid six months after Antwerp was relieved, or within a year if it was not. Immediately afterwards there was a panic that Antwerp had surrendered, and Zeeland let it be known that it was prepared to cede Flushing for less than its original demand. This inspired a second provisional treaty (10 August) for aid during the war. Under this the 4000 English were to serve for the duration of the war. The treaty for Antwerp was still in force, but repayment of English expenditure subsequent to the initial three months was to be postponed until a year after the end of the war. Flushing and Brill were to be ceded as cautions a month after the treaty was ratified. The treaty also outlined the political and military role of the governor-general, the assumed commander of the English force.<br>
<br>There was considerable doubt whether the states general would ratify this treaty, but on 20 August it was learned that Antwerp had actually surrendered. Two days later Walsingham invited Davison to discuss the Netherlands with him in advance of a meeting with the Dutch deputies the following day. The Dutch reported on the 23rd that Elizabeth had decided to increase her troops to the desired 1000 horse and 5000 foot and Leicester had been invited to serve as the &#145;heere van qualiteyt en respect&#146; (&#145;nobleman of rank and reputation&#146;), if Flushing and Brill were handed over immediately  (Algemeen Rijksarchief, 1.01.01.01.92). On the 25th it was decided to send an English envoy to The Hague. The initial choice was William Waad, but Davison replaced him. Davison's instructions (over which he was allowed considerable discretion) stated that out of concern over the possible moral effects of the surrender of Antwerp, Elizabeth had decided to concede what the Dutch wanted, but Flushing and Brill were to be handed over first. Once they were in English hands, he could return.<br>
<br>Davison reached Flushing on 3 September and made his way quickly to The Hague. However, just after he left, London had a new idea: an &#145;instrument&#146; signed by the commissioners for the 10 August treaty that would include both a ratification of the treaty and Elizabeth's recent concessions. This became known as the <span class="roman">Act of Ampliation</span>. A copy was sent to Davison on the 3rd, but the Dutch deputies in England then obtained a further concession that the garrisons of the cautionary towns would be supplementary to the 5000 infantry&#151;a point which had not been clear in the 10 August treaty. The <span class="roman">Act of Ampliation</span> was redrafted and the new version sent to Davison on the 18th.<br>
<br>Davison had only received the first version of the act when he had his initial audience with the states general on the 11th. On the 20th the states general decided to draft its own act of ratification, to which he agreed in order to save time. On the recommendation of Holland two revisions were introduced. The first was the exclusion of the garrisons of the cautionary towns from the 5000 (to which, they had heard from London, Elizabeth had agreed), and the second the absorption of the 2 August treaty into the 10 August treaty. The result of this was that the repayment of all the costs of the English troops was delayed until the end of the war. Davison was shown a draft on the 22nd; he noted that there were problems, but to save time he was prepared to sign it. As he informed London, his primary concern was the quick and peaceful surrender of the cautionary towns. He considered that the concession over their garrisons fell within his discretion, but curiously he did not comment on the amalgamation of the treaties.<br>
<br>Davison then moved speedily to obtain possession of Brill (1 October) and Flushing (19 October). To provide their garrisons he requested the English military commander, John Norris, to supply the best of the English companies. Norris wished to use them on a short campaign near Arnhem. Davison publicly stated that this was a mistake given the season, and their relations suffered. He now intended to delay his return until Sir Philip Sidney arrived in Flushing, but on 19 October he was instructed to wait for Leicester and help him settle in; he could return a month after the earl arrived. On the 23rd Elizabeth finally received the Dutch <span class="roman">Act of Ratification</span>. She was outraged by what she regarded as sharp practice in the revisions, but Davison was informed that no blame was attached to him.<br>
<br>Leicester did not arrive until 10 December. Davison was among the reception party that greeted him in Flushing, and he then accompanied him into Holland. On the 27th Walsingham informed him that Elizabeth had agreed to his recall for she &#145;meaneth to use your service otherwise&#146;, rumours Davison had already heard over a month before  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1585&#150;6</i>, 155, 241). Before he left, however, he became involved in one of the more controversial episodes in his career. The treaty of 10 August had set out the political and military role of the governor-general in some detail, and Davison was aware during November and December that the Dutch were discussing what form this should take. How much he knew about the debates in England is not clear, although Leicester later claimed he had shown him all his commissions and instructions. It would be a key point in his own future defence that he had received no formal instruction that Leicester was not to hold any office other than command of the queen's troops.<br>
<br>On 31 December the states general agreed on a proposal for the governor-generalship to offer Leicester, and this was delivered to him verbally in his bedchamber at The Hague on the following day. Leicester then had Davison answer for him in French. Davison and Sidney were Leicester's main representatives in the debates with the states general over the terms of the offer between 7 and 16 January 1586. Agreement was reached on the 16th, and Leicester was formally sworn in as governor-general on the 25th. Leicester, Davison, and numerous others informed London that negotiations over the governor-generalship were in train from mid-January, though Leicester did not write to Elizabeth directly. Instead on 14 January he informed Walsingham that Davison would be returning shortly and would explain all. He wrote fulsomely in Davison's praise, urged that the queen give him &#145;countenance&#146;, and despite the rumours of a promotion at home requested that he be returned to the Netherlands where his experience was invaluable  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. Bruce, art. 26).<br>
<br>For reasons that are not entirely clear, Davison did not leave The Hague until 5 February; he was then caught at Brill by adverse winds and did not arrive at the court at Greenwich Palace until the 12th. Leicester's letter of 14 January had reached the court by 26 January, when the privy council sent him a strong expression of Elizabeth's displeasure at the offer of the governor-generalship and ordered him not to accept the office. This letter reached him by 8 February while Davison was trapped at Brill. Leicester wrote to inform Davison on the 10th, but he left for England on that very day. Davison arrived at court apparently unaware that Elizabeth had been fuming over the subject for well over a fortnight and that on learning by the 10th that Leicester had actually assumed office she had prepared Sir Thomas Heneage to go and demand that he resign it.<br>
<br>Davison brought with him a (now missing) letter from Leicester to Elizabeth and a prepared defence on grounds of necessity; if Leicester had rejected the Dutch offer they might have sought a peace with Spain. Elizabeth retorted that Leicester had disobeyed her express command. Having heard that Davison &#145;of whom she had conceaved better opinion and towardes whom she had intended more good then now she found me woorthy of&#146; and Sidney were &#145;perswadors thereof&#146;, she also attacked him for not having opposed Leicester (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. Bruce, art. 43; BL, Cotton MS Galba C. viii, fol. 30<i>r</i>). Davison's personal defence was the absence of any instruction on the subject, but he considered Leicester's action politically justified anyway.<br>
<br>Thereafter Davison retired from court with a cold he had picked up on his return and spent most of the next few months in bed. However, there was an unpleasant sequel. Leicester does not appear to have learned of Davison's interview until he met Heneage in Harlem on 8 March. On one level he then took the blame &#145;that I dyd not first acquaint her highness before I dyd accept this office&#146;, but he then claimed that he was dissuaded from doing so by Davison &#145;and others&#146;. Davison had argued &#145;the extremity of the cace to be such as he thought himself full hable to satysfie her majesty&#146;. He also stood to Davison's defence: &#145;I say not this to worke any blame to Mr Davyson, whose most sincere honest minde toward hir servyce I must acknowledge&#146;. Yet Leicester also sent him a savage private letter on the 10th, basically blaming him for the whole business, which Davison equally furiously annotated  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. Bruce, arts. 59, 61).<br>
<br>Several months later Leicester and Davison cautiously began corresponding again, but the warmth had left their relations. On 2 July, Davison wrote to deny rumours that he had told Elizabeth that Leicester had proceeded against his objections, and that he was the author of the &#145;hard procedinges offered to your excellency&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. Bruce, art. 125). Davison's defence of Leicester to Elizabeth was in some senses not the real issue, for by the time he arrived at court the damage had been done. The mystery lies in the responsibility for the way of proceeding. Why Leicester, who knew better than anyone else how to handle Elizabeth, failed to write to her directly and gambled all on Davison's providing his defence is still to be explained.<h2>
<a name="Secretaryofstate15861587"></a>Secretary of state, 1586&#150;1587</h2>Davison had intended going to Bath &#145;for an ache that hath continued in my knees&#146; since he returned from Scotland in 1584, but his cold meant that he did not leave until July  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1585&#150;6</i>, 592). It was in Bath in August, after all the hints, that he was finally informed that Elizabeth intended to appoint him a principal secretary of state. When he returned in February &#145;it is objected against Mr Davison's being Secretary that he is very poure, as in trewth he is not rych and also that Mr Secretary [Walsingham] is now in perfaict health so there nedeth no haste&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 1.190). In his letter to Leicester of 2 July, Davison hinted at a concern that he might see any promotion as a reward for having undercut him. However, although Walsingham informed him in July that Elizabeth &#145;seemethe to be dysposed to make Mr Davison my assystaunt&#146; there is no evidence Leicester had any involvement in the appointment one way or the other  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. Bruce, art. 129).<br>
<br>Davison was formally sworn secretary and a member of the privy council on 30 September, though his letters patent did not pass the great seal until 12 December. His four months' service was dominated by major events. Once appointed a privy councillor he was added to the commissioners for the trial of Mary, queen of Scots, and (for the first time) elected an MP for the duchy of Lancaster borough of Knaresborough in Yorkshire in the parliament that met in October. However, he took no part in either. In October, while Walsingham and Burghley went to Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire, and in November, while they were involved in the parliament, he was in attendance on Elizabeth at Windsor Castle and then Richmond Palace. The correspondence between the three during these months reveals him as an active messenger and co-ordinator, but very much a junior. In December the proroguing of the parliament and the remove of the court to Greenwich brought the council together again, but by the middle of the month Walsingham retired ill, and he did not return until the middle of February 1587. On 10 December, Davison asked him to send him the signet and the privy seal. Burghley remained at Greenwich but a riding accident in mid-January kept him in bed well into February.<br>
<br>Davison's attendance on Elizabeth in these months (he was present at almost every recorded privy council meeting) is the key to his prominence in Mary's last days. Most of what is known of the events surrounding the dispatch of the warrant for Mary's execution comes from the three accounts he drafted later. Two of them, a discourse and a relation of the events of 1 to 14 February 1587, he prepared for Walsingham in the Tower on 20 February. They agree on most of the circumstances, but the relation omits some important issues  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1586&#150;8</i>, arts. 284&#150;5). The third is an undated paper defending his innocence that appears to have been drafted after his trial on 28 March 1587  (ibid., art. 360). The last paper reflects the resentment Davison shared with Robert Beale at being singled out as the instruments of Mary's death and the possible targets of James's revenge when he succeeded Elizabeth. He emphasized that he played no role in either her trial or the parliamentary proceedings. He was responsible only for the custody of the warrant for her execution after Burghley drafted it about 10 December 1586, so that it would be on hand when Elizabeth wanted it. He had no particular interest in Mary's death. In this context he made some interesting claims: he had refused to sign the bond of association despite pressure from Elizabeth (presumably just before he left for the Netherlands in 1584), he had gone to Bath deliberately to avoid involvement in the investigation of the Babington plotters, and he had been instrumental in preventing the sentence being pronounced at Fotheringhay. With regard to the last, he was not entirely honest. When he forwarded to Walsingham the queen's instruction to delay pronouncing sentence until the commissioners had returned to London on 14 October 1586, he had expressed the hope that his letter would arrive too late.<br>
<br>Davison's narrative of the events between 1 and 14 February is straightforward and very detailed. He had retained the warrant for six weeks because he would not present it to Elizabeth until &#145;she sent a greater councillor to him for the same&#146;. This took place at Greenwich on 1 February when the lord admiral, Charles Howard, second Baron Howard of Effingham, told him Elizabeth was ready to sign. Elizabeth signed the warrant having specifically asked for it; it was then to go to the lord chancellor, Sir Thomas Bromley, to pass the great seal. Davison attended to this later that day, telling Burghley (who had Leicester with him at the time) and Walsingham (who was at home) on the way. On the 2nd Elizabeth told him to delay the sealing of the warrant, but he replied that it had already passed. This was a key point, for according to Davison she said nothing further. He then went to see Sir Christopher Hatton to tell him it was signed, that he feared Elizabeth would behave as she had done over the execution of Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk, and that he was unwilling to proceed on his own. Together they saw Burghley, who then decided to summon the privy council for the following day. On the 3rd the privy council met and Burghley proposed that they take the burden from Elizabeth by sending the warrant under their authority, and to appoint Beale to carry it. Nine privy councillors (presumably all those present), including Davison, signed the letter accompanying the warrant, together with Walsingham, to whom it was sent for signature in his sickbed. From then until news of the execution arrived from Fotheringhay on the 9th Davison saw Elizabeth on several occasions about other business, but did not mention the dispatch of the warrant, on the assumption (so he claimed in the discourse) that she knew about it from more senior privy councillors.<br>
<br>The relation differs from the discourse in two key areas. First, it greatly abbreviates Elizabeth's discussions with Davison over the assassination rather than execution of Mary. Second, it omits a long denial by Davison that the queen had ever told him on the 2nd to retain the sealed warrant in confidence until she ordered him otherwise and not to inform the rest of the privy council. The latter was to be another crucial point. Burghley told Elizabeth about the execution in the evening of the 9th, and after brooding on it overnight she announced to Hatton the next morning in &#145;some heat and passion&#146; that Davison had abused her trust by allowing the sealed warrant to leave his possession  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1586&#150;8</i>, 293). Davison himself was told at a privy council meeting later that morning and advised to make himself scarce for a day or two. He was not in good health anyway and returned home. There he learned on the 11th that Elizabeth had decided to send him to the Tower. Owing to his illness this was put off until the evening of 14 February.<br>
<br>The course of events between 14 February and Davison's trial on 28 March is more confusing. He was tried before an <i>ad hoc</i> court in the star chamber composed of three privy councillors (John Whitgift, archbishop of Canterbury, Sir Walter Mildmay, and Sir James Croft), who had not signed the letter of 3 February, and a miscellany of bishops, peers, and judges, under the presidency of the lord chief justice, Sir Christopher Wray, who was appointed lord privy seal for the occasion. The trial lasted for four hours between ten in the morning and two in the afternoon. The main charge against Davison was that he had disobeyed Elizabeth's command to retain the warrant and had then misled the privy council by not informing them of this. If Davison was being honest in the discourse, then it was his word against Elizabeth's. This, however, was not the defence he put forward. He specifically stated he was not going to contest the facts, and did not wish &#145;to utter the private speeches that passed between the queen and him&#146;. He had put the warrant in execution out of concern for Elizabeth's safety and may have mistaken what she told him &#145;not having been long acquainted with her manner of speech&#146; (despite being in attendance for nearly four months). On the lesser issue of concealing the dispatch of the warrant from Elizabeth after the 3rd, he stated that the privy council had agreed together not to &#145;let the Queen understand until it [the execution of Mary] was despatched&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1586&#150;8</i>, art. 328).<br>
<br>Although Davison received a fairly rough handling by the crown's lawyers, the judgment was delivered in a different tone. The first commissioner to pronounce was Mildmay, whose verdict was that Davison had abused Elizabeth's trust by making the warrant known to the privy council, but that he did it with a good intent. He was to be fined &pound;6666 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.&#151;admittedly too much for him to afford&#151;and imprisoned at pleasure, though Mildmay considered that Elizabeth &#145;might be moved upon humble submission to remitt the extremitie of them both&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1586&#150;8</i>, 350). The other commissioners, although expressing greater or lesser condemnation of Davison's actions, fell into line with the punishment. According to an unfortunately anonymous eyewitness, after the trial, when they all dined in the star chamber, Davison dined apart &#145;thanking Sir W. Mildmay by Swanne his man for his good chere but not the sharpe sauce that he had mixed therewith&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/199, fol. 138<i>v</i>&#150;139<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Davison was quietly released from the Tower&#151;where he spent some of the time writing a description of Ireland&#151;on 23 October 1588. It was shown nearly a century ago that he continued to be paid his salary as secretary of state until the end of his life and the various other emoluments and profits of office until the death of Walsingham in 1590. In 1594 Elizabeth granted him lands worth &pound;200 per annum, possibly in compensation for the loss of the profits; these he sold for &pound;5000. There is no evidence that any part of his fine was ever paid. He was never formally dismissed and he continued to be addressed as Mr Secretary&#151;he was simply suspended from office.<br>
<br>There is a definitely orchestrated tone to Davison's trial. Elizabeth at least was consistent. For all her anger with the ten privy councillors involved, Burghley in particular, Davison was a special case for disobeying her order on 2 February not to reveal the sealed warrant. The trial judgment was thus a vindication of her technical innocence. How Davison was brought to co-operate is an interesting question. Immediately after the execution Burghley had stood up for Davison and offered to resign his own offices. On 11 March, Thomas Randolph visited Davison in the Tower, where he found him ill and depressed, yet determined to maintain his innocence and deny any fault or error, expecting that the other privy councillors would stand with him. On 12, 14, and 16 March, Hatton and Sir John Woolley interviewed him, specifically about what Elizabeth had or had not said to him on 2 February. On the day before the trial the other privy councillors involved were also interviewed and a written statement taken from Burghley&#151;which was mentioned in the trial (and may be BL, Add. MS 48027, fol. 702)&#151;along the lines that Davison had misled him about the queen's intentions.<br>
<br>A story circulated later that Elizabeth had considered imprisoning Burghley as well, but decided against it because she was afraid it would kill him. On 25 February, Burghley became very worried that the lord chief justice of the common pleas, Sir Edmund Anderson, had told Elizabeth she had the power to hang Davison under the royal prerogative. He considered this illegal and warned the other judges against concurring. Davison later said that Mildmay had told him that the attorney-general, Sir John Popham, and the solicitor-general, Thomas Egerton, had threatened to resign if he was tried other than in star chamber (which could not pass capital sentences) and in such a way as would both satisfy Elizabeth yet make it possible for her to remit any punishment. Lastly, the anonymous witness (who wrote from Leicester House) gave Leicester credit for having engineered a successful compromise. It looks very much as though Davison was persuaded to forgo his innocence, justify Elizabeth at his trial, and suffer only nominally. Unfortunately the agreement was a bit too neat, and Davison was rapidly seen as an unconvincing scapegoat, either for the queen or for Burghley.<br>
<br>Yet Davison may have been more of an actor than he claimed. He expressed his conviction that Elizabeth would behave as she had done over Norfolk to Walsingham as early as 10 October 1586, several months before he mentioned it to Hatton. There is also his role in the des Trappes affair or Stafford plot of early January 1587, in which William Stafford and Leonard des Trappes, a gentleman servant of the French ambassador, were accused of plotting to assassinate Elizabeth. It was widely believed at the time that it was a put-up job to discredit the French ambassador, Guillaume de d'Aubespeine, baron de Ch&acirc;teauneuf, or to frighten Elizabeth into action. After Davison's arrest Walsingham admitted to Ch&acirc;teauneuf that the accusation was a mistake, which he attributed to Davison's inexperience. This has been seen as another example of Davison's being used as a scapegoat, but Walsingham may have been right. Davison was deeply involved in the investigation of the &#145;plot&#146; and may have believed that assassination to prevent Mary's execution was a very real threat.<br>
<br>Yet if Davison was to be rewarded for co-operating, the issue of his restoration to office remained. Amid the considerable sympathy for him, one champion in particular emerged, Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, who from spring 1587 made his restoration a matter of principle. Walsingham's death in April 1590 initiated a flurry of speculation on the subject. Essex worked hard on Davison's behalf with both Elizabeth and James, and Davison himself petitioned the queen on 7 December 1590. Elizabeth hesitated, but in 1593 she finally informed Essex that, while she appreciated Davison's qualities, restoring him was out of the question. Some years later, in a very bitter paper written after Burghley's death, Davison blamed him for deliberately preventing his &#145;restitution to his place&#146; in the interests of his son Robert Cecil  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1586&#150;8</i>, art. 426). He said nothing about the events of 1587, but whether he considered that Burghley had reneged on an understanding made then is an interesting point.<br>
<br>Davison's last years were spent in possibly deliberate obscurity. Whatever fears he may have had about James's revenge were unfounded, and his secretary's salary continued to be paid to him after 1603. On 25 July 1607 he was granted the reversion of his office of treasurer of king's bench and allowed to assign it to trustees in the interests of his children. He was then living in Stepney, Middlesex, where he died on 21 December 1608. He was buried in St Dunstan's Church, Stepney, on 24 December but no monument was erected. He drew up his last will on 18 December. It contains a predestinarian preamble, but is chiefly concerned with the sharing of the income from his office between his two daughters (referred to only by their married names Duncombe and Townley) and three surviving sons.<br>
<br>By the time of his death Davison had become a Tacitean hero, the honest man destroyed by the deviousness of the court. William Camden even insinuated that he was appointed secretary with the intent of using him as a scapegoat over Mary. The very obscurity of his background and his openly puritan allegiances have given him an attractively homespun image. The comparison of his fate with that of Edmund Grindal, archbishop of Canterbury, first made by R. B. Wernham seventy years ago, is still valid. Yet if he was thrust into some of the trickiest episodes of mid-Elizabethan diplomacy and politics, he also lived dangerously. He held strong views, expressed them publicly, and did not suffer those he considered fools gladly. Throughout his career he urged the seizing of opportunities by decisive action. His behaviour in February 1587 was very much in character, however much he may have wished in retrospect to portray himself as a mere unfortunate instrument.<br>
