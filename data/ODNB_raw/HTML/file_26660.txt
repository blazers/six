<span class="headword">Street, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1625, <em>d.</em> 1696), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was baptized on 13 October 1625 at St Andrew's, Worcester, the son of George Street (<i>d</i>. 1643) of Worcester, brewer, and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1644), daughter of Thomas Andrews of Barnshall, Upton upon Severn, Worcestershire. He was one of sixteen children, though only he and three others survived. He entered Lincoln College, Oxford, on 22 April 1642, but returned to Worcester without a degree early in 1645 after the death of his father, a former Worcester mayor and ship money collector. He was briefly imprisoned by parliamentarian forces at this time.<br>
<br>Street entered the Inner Temple on 22 November 1646, and lived intermittently with his brother John at his family's Worcester home, The Friary, until 1650. During this period he married Maria (<i>d</i>. 1668), daughter of John Wightwick, serjeant-at-law, of Tamworth; they had three sons, all of whom studied at Oxford, and two daughters.<br>
<br>Street was called to the bar on 24 November 1653, and began a law practice that kept him closely engaged with the city of his birth. In January 1659 Worcester sent him to parliament for the first time, but a petition from some of the inhabitants soon followed him there, condemning Street as &#145;a person who had been in arms, and a common swearer, [and who] was chosen by the profane rabble and cavaliers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Burton</span>, 3.70). The Commons investigated the charges, which Street answered by denying that he had fought for the king, though he admitted that he had worn a sword while in the company of royalist soldiers in 1645. Little more came of the accusations and Street was again chosen at Worcester to sit in the convention in 1660 and for the parliament seated in 1661. In the Commons Street's greatest efforts were reserved for Worcestershire interests: he served on committees or spoke for bills concerned with the county's salt and cloth industries, with Severn fishing, and with uniting parishes in Droitwich, whose recorder Street had become by 1664.<br>
<br>By then Street's legal career was on the rise, beginning with his work for the cathedral chapter in Worcester, for which he handled various issues ranging from estate management to a defence of the cathedral in respect of fee farm rents owed to the queen mother since the 1640s. Street should not be confused with a younger cousin of the same name who served as Worcester's mayor in 1667&#150;8 and as justice of the peace the following year; it was probably this cousin who acted briefly as Worcester's town clerk in 1668. In November 1669 Street became a bencher of the Inner Temple, and on 2 October 1672 Worcester corporation unanimously made him the city's recorder.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1660s and 1670s Street was outspoken in parliament against protestant dissenters, and he was increasingly seen as a supporter of court policies. In December 1667 he defended Chief Justice Sir John Kelyng from charges in the Commons that he mistreated jurors. By now Street himself was a judge in Wales; in 1677 he became chief justice for south Wales and a serjeant-at-law, and in October 1678 a king's serjeant.<br>
<br>Worcester returned Street to both parliaments in 1679 together with Sir Francis Winnington, who now moved against court interests as surely as Street supported them. Street's loyalty was rewarded on 21 April 1681 when he was sworn a baron of the court of exchequer; the king knighted him in June. His loyalty and his concern with the politics of his home city converged in late 1681 when, probably owing to his influence, the first <i>quo warranto</i> was brought against one of England's urban corporations. This was a direct attack on twenty-six of his foes in Worcester, all of them notable for supporting Winnington, who became their most ardent defender in court. In 1683 the court's judgment ousted and fined all twenty-six, marking an important legal and political triumph for Street. In May 1683 he resigned as recorder of Worcester, probably because he was so heavily committed in London; in July the reconstituted city corporation voted him its thanks for his help in the <i>quo warranto</i> proceedings.<br>
<br>In 1683 Street sat in judgment in the Old Bailey with Sir Francis Pemberton in the trial of the Rye House conspirators, though in the following year some noted how lenient he was toward Quakers at the Northampton assizes. On 29 October 1684 he became a justice of common pleas but in June 1686, in the crucial case of <i>Godden v. Hales</i>, he was the only judge to declare against the royal dispensing power&#151;a sign of judicial independence that incorrectly convinced some that he would be turned off the bench. Later authors charged that Street gave his decision in collusion with the crown in order to give an appearance of judicial integrity to proceedings in the case. No contemporary evidence exists to support this claim, and Street's memorial in Worcester Cathedral includes this decision among his signal accomplishments. On 16 September 1686 Street married Penelope (<i>d</i>. 1696), the daughter of Sir Rowland Berkeley of Cotheridge, Worcestershire.<br>
<br>After the revolution of 1688 William of Orange refused to see Street, and he lost his place on the bench. He retired to Cotheridge and Worcester. He died at one of those two places on 8 March 1696 and was buried in the south cloister of Worcester Cathedral, having left a modest estate to his grandchildren.<br>
