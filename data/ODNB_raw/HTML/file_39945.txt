<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Powell,  Michael Latham</span>  (1905&#150;1990), <span class="occ">film director</span>, was born on 30 September 1905 at Howletts, Bekesbourne, near Canterbury, Kent, the second son and younger child of Thomas William Powell, farmer, and his wife, Mabel, daughter of Frederick Corbett, of Worcester. He was educated at King's School, Canterbury, where he was a king's scholar, and at Dulwich College. Powell started work with the National Provincial Bank in 1922, but entered the film business in 1925, when he joined Rex Ingram, a Hollywood director who was working at the Victorine Studios in Nice, and Harry Lachman, a Chicago-born painter who secured employment for Powell with British International Pictures. The contact with Ingram was made through Powell's father, who owned a hotel in Nice. In 1927 Powell married Gloria Mary Rouger, an American dancer; they were married in France and stayed together for only three weeks. In 1931 Powell formed Film Engineering with Jerry Jackson, an American lawyer, to produce &#145;quota quickies&#146;, British films given a market by the <span class="roman">Cinematograph Act</span> of 1927. In just five years he worked on approximately twenty-three films, gaining valuable experience and making useful contacts in the film world.<br>
<br>After a successful contract with Gaumont-British, one of Britain's major film production companies, Powell directed a personal project shot on the island of Foula in the Shetlands, <span class="italic">The Edge of the World</span> (1937), produced by the American Joe Rock. The film received good reviews and a cup for the best direction of a foreign film at the 1938 Venice film festival. This led to a contract with Alexander Korda, who facilitated Powell's first collaboration with the screenwriter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39946/', "Emeric Pressburger")</script> on <span class="italic">The Spy in Black</span> (1939), about a German plan to sabotage the British fleet anchored off the Orkney Islands in the First World War, the first of twenty-one films they made together; they formed their production company, the Archers, in 1943. But before their partnership was more permanently forged Powell co-directed a propaganda film, one of the first to be completed after the beginning of the Second World War, <span class="italic">The Lion has Wings</span> (1939). The film was much admired by Winston Churchill for its patriotism. Powell then co-directed Korda's spectacular adventure film <span class="italic">The Thief of Bagdad</span> (1940). This gave him the opportunity to explore the potential of Technicolor, the preferred technique in many of his subsequent films, and also the use of the pre-recorded soundtrack. It also encouraged his fascination with modernist, self-reflexive devices which he developed in later films. On 1 July 1943 Powell married Frances May Reidy (1909&#150;1983), daughter of Jerome Reidy, a medical practitioner. They had two sons. Not long after this marriage he began an affair with the actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/100787/', "Kathleen Byron (1921&#150;2009)")</script>, an entanglement which contributed to the breakdown of both of their marriages.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Powell and Pressburger produced some of their finest work, including <span class="italic">Forty Ninth Parallel</span> (1941), <span class="italic">One of our Aircraft is Missing</span> (1941), and <span class="italic">The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp</span> (1943), a film which was criticized by Churchill and the Ministry of Information for its satirical portrayal of the military. The films were imaginative, creative, cinematic, and rather unconventional. Whereas most British films were made in realistic style, Powell and Pressburger used fantastical situations, dream sequences, bold colour, and disjointed narratives. Powell's break with the realist tradition (of which <span class="italic">The Lion has Wings</span> was part) left both audiences and critics puzzled. The Archers also broke new ground with <span class="italic">A Canterbury Tale</span> (1944), a lyrical meditation for the post-war world which suffered from studio cuts to render it more conventional. Although Powell's films were considered to stray beyond what was expected from British films, the Rank Organization nevertheless gave the Archers a firm production base and considerable freedom in the development of their projects. Powell excelled at location shooting and had a particularly poetic response to landscape. When location shooting was not possible or appropriate, Powell devised ingenious experiments in the studio to create fantasy environments. Pressburger's screenplays gave him ample opportunities to develop these skills, and he always preferred narratives based on fantasy and the imagination rather than on fact.<br>
<br>At the end of the war Powell directed <span class="italic">I Know Where I'm Going!</span> (1945), a film which employed location shooting on the western isles of Scotland and impressive studio effects to create a dramatic storm sequence. This was followed by his favourite film, the spectacular <span class="italic">A Matter of Life and Death</span> (1946), starring David Niven as a British pilot on the verge of death who has to argue his case in &#145;heaven&#146; in order to be allowed to live. It was an aesthetic experiment involving imaginative sets and innovative film techniques to represent the pilot's hallucinations. For this film Powell used the German art director Alfred Junge, with whom he had first collaborated on <span class="italic">Contraband</span> (1940). Junge and Powell worked towards creating a distinctive and imaginative setting for both &#145;heaven&#146; and earth, alternating between black and white and colour to stress the difference. Another collaborator with whom Powell worked on many successful occasions was the cinematographer Jack Cardiff, who did his best work for the Archers. <span class="italic">A Matter of Life and Death</span> was Cardiff's first film for Powell and Pressburger, and used his experience of working with Technicolor for several years to stunning effect.<br>
<br>In a spirit of resourceful creativity <span class="italic">Black Narcissus</span> (1946), based on Rumer Godden's novel, reproduced the Himalayas in a Pinewood studio. Seeking to avoid an awkward mix of two styles, Powell turned down the opportunity to go to India for location shots, in favour of a studio experiment. Powell, Junge, and Cardiff again rose to the challenge, creating stunning sets and evoking an atmosphere of alluring sensuality. The film was the subject of intense controversy in the USA, where the Legion of Decency, a Catholic organization, lobbied to have it banned because of its allegedly sacrilegious portrayal of a religious order. A cut version was released there to placate this powerful pressure group. Their next film, <span class="italic">The Red Shoes</span> (1948), was an extravagant gamble. Rank allowed the Archers to produce a high-budget film about ballet at a time when the British film industry was enjoying a brief period of protection against US film imports. Its excess stretched the limits of the relationship with Rank and ended the Archers' partnership with the studio until <span class="italic">The Battle of the River Plate</span> in 1956. <span class="italic">The Red Shoes</span> is significant for its experimentation with the idea of the &#145;composed&#146; film, whereby the film is conceived and shot on the basis of an existing musical score. Powell had used elements of this method in earlier films, but employed the technique to an unprecedented extent with <span class="italic">The Red Shoes</span>. The film was also ambitious in its use of British and European locations, and dealt with the tempestuous world of ballet, in which dedication and personal sacrifice are demanded for art. The film was extremely successful in the USA, appearing as the highest-earning British film in top box-office lists for many years. Powell repeated the strategy of the composed film several times, particularly in <span class="italic">The Tales of Hoffman</span> (1953), an experimental adaptation of Jacques Offenbach's opera. He was also involved in the development of a technical special effects device known as the &#145;independent frame&#146;, which aimed to reduce costs by creating a multiplicity of effects in the studio.<br>
<br>From 1948 to 1955 Powell worked with Alexander Korda again on <span class="italic">The Small Back Room</span> (1949) and <span class="italic">The Tales of Hoffman</span>. In 1950 two costume films, <span class="italic">Gone to Earth</span> and <span class="italic">The Elusive Pimpernel</span>, suffered from Korda's involvement with the American independent producers Sam Goldwyn and David O. Selznick. Selznick insisted on two versions of <span class="italic">Gone to Earth</span>, resulting in an American version which related more closely than the British to the source novel by Mary Webb. <span class="italic">The Elusive Pimpernel</span> was not released in the USA until 1955 in a black and white version that was shorter than the British version released in 1950, and retitled <span class="italic">The Fighting Pimpernel</span>. Powell's last film with Pressburger was a wartime drama, <span class="italic">Ill Met by Moonlight</span> (1956), produced by Rank. Powell felt constrained with a narrative based on fact and was dissatisfied with the results. The Archers' partnership ended in 1956 after disagreements during the filming of <span class="italic">Ill Met by Moonlight</span>. Over the previous few years there had been a mutual distancing, and several unsuccessful attempts to raise finance for film projects.<br>
<br>In 1959 Powell directed the controversial <span class="italic">Peeping Tom</span>, later widely regarded as a classic but at the time considered to be sadistic cheap horror. It was based on a story by Leo Marks about a young cameraman who photographs victims as he kills them with the point of his tripod. The film was controversial because it encouraged sympathy for the murderer. Powell also indulged his fascination for self-reflexivity with the inclusion of home-movie footage of himself as a child with his father. Its immediate reception was so bad that Powell could get no further funding for his work and had to go to Australia in 1966 to make two films: <span class="italic">They're a Weird Mob</span> (1966) and <span class="italic">The Age of Consent</span> (1969), the last feature film he was to direct. Despite its initial poor reception, <span class="italic">Peeping Tom</span> has subsequently been praised by critics as an important advance in the horror genre and a meditation on voyeurism in cinema. In the 1970s Powell's talent was fully recognized by film-makers and critics, especially Martin Scorsese, Brian de Palma, and David Thompson, who encouraged him to move to the USA in 1980 to teach at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire. Powell's passion for experiment, risk taking, and creative use of colour influenced many film directors in both Britain and the United States. In 1981 Powell became director-in-residence at Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope Hollywood studio, where he also worked on his boastful and vengeful autobiographies <span class="italic">A Life in Movies</span> (1986) and <span class="italic">Million-Dollar Movie</span> (1992).<br>
<br>Powell was remarkable for his liveliness, enthusiasm, and passion for both cinema and Rudyard Kipling. He was a fierce champion of cinema as an art form and resented producers who placed restrictions, creative and budgetary, on his films. Above all, he insisted that a good film was the product of many talents, remarking in his autobiography that &#145;one of my missions in life is to convince my fellow film directors that collaboration is an art, and that the movies is the greatest of collaborative arts&#146;  (Powell, <span class="italic">Million-Dollar Movie</span>, 421). He particularly admired the films of Akira Kurosawa, Luchino Visconti, John Huston, David Lean, Carol Reed, Francis Ford Coppola, and Martin Scorsese. Despite his reputation as an imaginative director who acknowledged the importance of collaboration, however, Powell was difficult to work with, and antagonized many actors with his lack of respect and his self-centredness. The partnership with Pressburger was remarkable for its longevity, even though it was not entirely free from friction. When the work of Powell and Pressburger was being re-evaluated from the 1970s Pressburger often felt that Powell, the consummate self-publicist, dominated billings and events for retrospectives. Yet when interviewed about the partnership Powell always expressed a huge debt to the quality of the screenplays, upon which he worked closely with Pressburger to ensure their most striking realization. In acknowledging the importance of their collaboration Powell remarked that &#145;I am the teller of the tale, and not the creator of the story&#146;  (Macdonald, 155), insisting that above all he was a craftsman in film art. Powell likened their relationship to a marriage which on the whole was characterized by mutual dependence and respect. Powell's physical appearance was distinctive: he had clear blue eyes, ruddy cheeks, and a moustache, and was bald from an early age. He loved the outdoors and always shot on location when possible.<br>
<br>In recognition of his work Powell received a number of awards, including fellowship of the Royal Geographic Society, honorary doctorates from the universities of East Anglia (1978) and Kent (1984) and the Royal College of Art (1987), and the British Film Institute's special award in 1978 and a fellowship in 1983. He married for a third time on 19 May 1984; his wife was the film editor Thelma Colbert Schoonmaker (<i>b</i>. 1939/40), daughter of Bertram Schoonmaker, a clerical worker in the Standard Oil Company. He also lived for many years with the actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40455/', "Pamela Mary Brown")</script>. Powell died from cancer on 19 February 1990 at his home at 1 Lee Cottages, Avening, Gloucestershire. His third wife survived him.<br>
