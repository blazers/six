<span class="headword">Harvey, Sir  Ernest Musgrave</span>, first baronet  (1867&#150;1955), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 27 July 1867 at 1 Oak Hill, Hampstead, London, the third son of the Revd Charles Musgrave Harvey, curate of St John's Church, Hampstead, and later rector of Acton and vicar of Hillingdon, Middlesex, and his wife, Frances Harriet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brewster. He was educated at Marlborough College, and in 1885 obtained a clerkship in the Bank of England. In 1896 he married Sophia Paget (1871&#150;1952); they had a son and three daughters.<br>
<br>During fifty years at the Bank of England Harvey&#151;among the first of a new breed of central banker&#151;became only the second of its officials to be elected a director and the first to enter the ranks of &#145;governors&#146;. Appointed deputy chief cashier in 1902 at the early age of thirty-five, from 1914 he played a large part in the bank's tasks of arranging massive war loans and then post-war monetary reconstruction for Britain and its European allies. For these services he was decorated by the French and Belgian governments, made a CBE in 1917, and knighted in 1920. He succeeded Sir Gordon Nairne as chief cashier in 1918 and again as comptroller in 1925, before joining him as a director in 1928.<br>
<br>These promotions of senior officials to a court of directors traditionally composed of merchant bankers introduced a new professionalism to the Bank of England's highest levels as part of wider organizational reforms arising from its recognition that, amid post-war financial dislocations, central banking had become a much more active and complex function. The customary two-year rotation of governors was also abandoned. Just as Montagu Norman was the first modern, long-term governor, so Harvey in 1929 became the first modern deputy governor.<br>
<br>Harvey's great strength was his thorough knowledge of the Bank of England's organization and practices, making him &#145;the perfect permanent secretary&#146; for Norman by relieving him of responsibilities for administration and co-ordination  (Sayers, 2.622&#150;3, 635, 650&#150;52). He was also unusually articulate in expounding his understanding. On trips to European capitals, and in a visit to Australia in 1927, he was an apostle of the bank's conception of central banking principles under the restored gold standard. With Norman absent through illness in late 1929, Harvey gave the bank's long opening evidence to the Macmillan committee of finance and industry, impressing even Keynes with what remains the most comprehensive and lucid source for the inter-war Bank of England.<br>
<br>Another of Norman's illnesses left Harvey as the bank's acting head during the sterling crises of August and September 1931. He not only orchestrated defensive actions by the City, the Treasury, and American and French banks, but with his fellow director Sir Edward Peacock became a principal adviser to successive governments, even attending cabinet committees. Calling for urgent balancing of the budget as the best means to restore international confidence, they contributed to the pressures which fatally divided the second Labour cabinet. Consequently they figured prominently in accusations of forming a &#145;bankers' ramp&#146; against a socialist government, although Harvey had scrupulously left discussion of specific taxes and expenditure cuts to the politicians. Under the emergency all-party National Government they criticized Conservative efforts to force a general election, and believed these helped to precipitate the final collapse of confidence. After two months of strenuous struggle, Harvey had to preside over the Bank of England's decision to advise abandonment of the gold standard, announced on 21 September 1931.<br>
<br>What then seemed a catastrophe was soon accepted as an economic relief. One result was the implementation in June 1932 of the long-prepared plans of Harvey and Sir Richard Hopkins of the Treasury for a great war loan conversion, which inaugurated the &#145;cheap money&#146; that assisted Britain's economic recovery in the 1930s. Harvey also participated in Bank of England rescues of commercial banks and in its novel industrial reorganization schemes, notably of the Lancashire Cotton Corporation. From 1934 he chaired the R. M. and E. D. Realisation Companies, the Bank of England-led arrangements for liquidating the failed Royal Mail&#150;Elder Dempster shipping combine. Harvey was created a baronet in 1933. He retired from the Bank of England in 1936, but during the Second World War was a member of the General Claims Tribunal. He died at his home, Pennings, Mildenhall, Marlborough, on 17 December 1955.<br>
