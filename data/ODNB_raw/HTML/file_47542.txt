<span class="headword">McInnes <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Highet]</span>,  Helen Clark</span>  (1907&#150;1985), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born at 224 Armadale Street, Glasgow, on 7 October 1907, the only child of Donald McInnes, foreman joiner, and Jessica Cecilia Sutherland, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McDiarmid. When she was five years old her parents moved to Helensburgh, Dunbartonshire, where she attended the Hermitage School. She passed the entrance examination for the University of Glasgow at the age of sixteen, but postponed her entry and attended the Glasgow High School for Girls for one year, before matriculating in 1925. Her family moved back to Glasgow when she went up to university. She played tennis for the university, and was actively involved in the annual student charities' week events. In her final year she undertook part-time work in the university library, where she helped catalogue early printed books. Her interest in books continued after graduation (MA in French and German, 1928), when she was appointed special cataloguer to the Ferguson Collection at Glasgow University Library (1928&#150;9). From 1929 to 1930 she was employed by Dunbartonshire education authority, selecting books for county libraries. In 1930 she enrolled at University College, London, where she was awarded a diploma in librarianship in 1931.<br>
<br>On 22 September 1932 Helen married Gilbert Arthur Highet (<i>d</i>. 1978), a classicist, whom she had met when they were both students at Glasgow. The marriage ceremony took place in the recently opened University of Glasgow memorial chapel. They moved to Oxford upon his appointment as a don at St John's College. Their son, Keith, was born in 1933 and Helen combined the roles of wife and mother with active participation in university life. She took a keen interest in amateur dramatics, and acted in several plays produced by St John's College, the Oxford University dramatic society, and the Experimental Theatre Club. She also travelled extensively in Europe, financing these trips by translating books from German. In 1937 Gilbert Highet was invited to lecture for one year at Columbia University, New York. The family moved to New York in 1938, when he was offered a permanent post as professor of Latin and Greek. New York became the family's home and in 1952 both Helen and Gilbert took American citizenship. Gilbert Highet was appointed Anthon professor of Latin at Columbia. In America, as in Europe, they loved to travel and spent their holidays exploring many parts of the United States, especially enjoying the rugged mountain areas.<br>
<br>Helen began writing novels in 1939, her first book, <span class="italic">Above Suspicion</span>, being published in 1941 under the name Helen MacInnes. This book, the story of a young British couple looking for an anti-Nazi agent in Bavaria, was apparently based on her honeymoon in Bavaria. It later became a film, released in 1943 and starring Joan Crawford and Fred MacMurray. The success of this first novel launched her on a career which would lead to her being acclaimed by her publishers, Collins, as the Queen of Spy Writers. She wrote a total of twenty-one novels, which had sold 23 million copies and had been translated into twenty-two languages by the time of her death. Her work was noted for its high literary standard and descriptive accuracy, and for her obvious understanding of complex political situations and knowledge of current affairs. This may in part have been due to the fact that she kept a diary of important political events in the countries she visited. Her extensive personal experience of European travel must also have contributed to the vividness and accuracy of description of the geographical settings, culture, and customs of the regions in which her novels were set. However, her obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> mentions that some people were concerned that the literary quality of her novels was in danger of being overshadowed by her political standpoint.<br>
<br>In addition to <span class="italic">Above Suspicion</span>, film adaptations were made of the novels <span class="italic">Assignment in Brittany</span> (1943), <span class="italic">The Venetian Affair</span> (1967), and <span class="italic">The Salzburg Connection</span> (1969). In 1966 Helen was awarded the Columbia prize in literature by Iona College, New Rochelle, New York. In 1969 she was the subject of a BBC radio programme entitled <span class="italic">Home this Afternoon</span>, in which she was interviewed about her life and work by Jack Singleton. In 1973 both she and Gilbert Highet received the Wallace award of the American-Scottish Foundation, awarded annually to Scottish-Americans distinguished in the fields of education, journalism, literature, and diplomacy.<br>
<br>Following Gilbert Highet's death in 1978 Helen continued to write, and divided her time between her apartment in New York city and her country home on Long Island. Her last book, <span class="italic">Ride a Pale Horse</span>, was published in 1984, and appeared in the paperback best-seller list of the <span class="italic">New York Times</span> on the day before her death. A number of her books were reprinted after her death. Having suffered a stroke a few weeks earlier, Helen McInnes died in hospital in Manhattan, New York, on 30 September 1985.<br>
