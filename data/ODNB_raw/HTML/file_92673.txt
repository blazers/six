<span class="headword">Poole,  Monica Mary</span>  (1921&#150;2003), <span class="occ">wood-engraver</span>, was born on 20 May 1921 at 43 Whitstable Road, Canterbury, Kent, the younger daughter of Charles Reginald Poole, a bank clerk, and his wife, Gladys Aline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Haskell. Her sister died at the age of seven as the family was moving to Ramsgate. Poole was then only six months old. After contracting polio she was unable to walk until she was five. Her mother developed tuberculosis and in 1929 Poole accompanied her for two years to a sanatorium in the Bernese Oberland in Switzerland. The magnificence of the landscape made a deep impression and she returned there throughout her life. After education at Abbotsford School in Broadstairs she studied at Thanet School of Art, Margate, where she was introduced to the art of wood-engraving by Geoffrey Wales. In 1940 her family moved to Bedford, where she worked in an aircraft factory. From 1945 to 1949 she studied wood-engraving at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London under John Farleigh, whom she found an ideal teacher.<br>
<br>Poole's first commission on leaving the Central School was to do thirty-seven illustrations for Reginald Turner's <span class="italic">Kent</span> in Paul Elek's <span class="roman">Vision of England</span> series, published in 1950. However, feeling unable to portray activity and emotion, she considered that her work&#151;which is often austere&#151;was &#145;too cold&#146; for her to have a career as an illustrator. On 28 May 1952 she married Commander Alastair George Murison Small, a retired naval officer and widower (with one son) who was twenty-four years older than her. The son of Alexander Murison Small, writer to the signet, he worked at the Armament and Research Establishment near Sevenoaks until 1959, when he set up a heating and ventilation consultancy; Poole worked with him in the latter business.<br>
<br>In the immediate post-war period Poole's instinctive feeling for nature made her creative output seem very much part of the British art scene at a time when neo-Romantic artists like Graham Sutherland, Ceri Richards, John Piper, John Craxton, and John Minton were at the height of their reputations. The success of this movement was short-lived, however, and before long both her art and her chosen medium of wood-engraving were regarded as completely unfashionable. She continued to exhibit during the 1960s and 1970s while teaching at Tonbridge Adult Education Centre, but an exhibition review which appeared in 1975 in <span class="italic">The Connoisseur</span> was typical: &#145;many individual blocks are interesting or enjoyable &hellip; but the sensation persists that wood-engravers live in the past, still waiting for the second coming&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 Aug 2003). With the sudden death of her husband in 1969 these years were particularly bleak for Poole. It was not until the 1980s that the tide of fashion turned. In 1984 Graham Williams's Florin Press printed a number of her finest blocks in <span class="italic">Monica Poole: Wood Engraver</span> and the following year she published <span class="italic">The Wood Engravings of John Farleigh</span>. The London dealer Duncan Campbell gave her solo shows in 1989 and 1993, and during 1993 there was a retrospective of her work at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.<br>
<br>Poole's work was remarkable for its intense images of organic form. What fascinated her imagination were the strange and intricate structures of nature which appeared in the roots, vegetation, stones, and shells she collected as inspiration for her extraordinary, surreal wood-engravings. &#145;Those twisted shapes will not leave me alone&#146;, she wrote  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>). They seemed like explorations of a deeply private world. Although not inspired by pure landscape (she preferred things to spaces), in the 1970s she began a series of tree and woodland studies. Her <span class="italic">Spring after the Hurricane</span> was commissioned by the National Trust and the Society of Wood Engravers to commemorate the damage done by the great storm of 1987, which left her personally traumatized.<br>
<br>Between 1947 and 1970 Poole exhibited prints and watercolours at the Royal Academy. She was elected an associate of the Royal Society of Painter&#150;Etchers and Engravers (subsequently the Royal Society of Painter&#150;Printmakers) in 1957, and a fellow in 1976; a member of the Art-Workers' Guild in 1970; and a member of the (revived) Society of Wood Engravers in 1984. The concentration required by the technique of engraving on hard boxwood blocks, as well as Poole's own preference for working on a large scale, meant that her output as an engraver was relatively small. However, her work is extensively represented, including in the Ashmolean Museum (thanks to her own generosity), the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and Boston Public Library in the United States. Uncompromising in pursuit of both her chosen art and her imagery, Poole was described as a &#145;benchmark for excellence&#146; by the wood engraver Hilary Paynter  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). She was unquestionably one of the finest wood-engravers of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Poole was a slight although not a fragile figure; her manner was quiet and reserved but to those who knew her well she was warm and enthusiastic. In later years she became reclusive and lived largely in one room at her house, 67 Hadlow Road, Tonbridge, Kent, as the after-effects of her childhood polio caught up with her. She died of cancer on 3 August 2003 at the Hospice in the Weald, Pembury, Kent. She was survived by her stepson.<br>
