<span class="headword">Wigmore,  Winefrid</span>  (1585&#150;1657), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic religious sister and schoolmistress</span>, was born at Lucton, Herefordshire, one of twelve children of Sir William Wigmore and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Throckmorton. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4542/', "William Wigmore (c.1599&#150;1665)")</script> was one of three of her brothers who joined the Society of Jesus, while one of her sisters (Elizabeth in baptism), joined the English Benedictine convent at Ghent, and another (Helen in baptism), joined the Carmelites at Antwerp. Few details are known about Winefrid's early life, although later sources suggest that she was a pious child who was given an extensive education by her parents, learning to speak and write five languages including Latin.<br>
<br>In 1605, while visiting her Throckmorton cousins at Coughton, Warwickshire, Winefrid encountered in this staunchly Catholic household her equally devout contemporary Mary Ward, shortly to become a nun at St Omer. Following Mary's return to London in 1609 with a vision for a new religious community, Winefrid was one of a group of five young women who joined her at a house in the Strand to participate in the apostolic work being undertaken among persecuted Catholic women. These &#145;companions&#146; remained with Mary, sharing the hardships of the venture then known as the &#145;English ladies&#146; or Mary Ward's institute. Mary shared with Winefrid her deepest concerns and a close friendship developed between the two women. Winefrid remained a loyal companion, sharing the lengthy journeys across Europe and the uncertainties of new foundations. Her linguistic skills were of particular importance to Mary as the institute spread from Flanders into Italy and even further afield. In 1622&#150;3 she became headmistress of schools that were established first in Rome and later in Naples. Mary commented on the fine quality of the Latin teaching in the Naples school. Winefrid was appointed superior in Naples in 1624, although contemporary documents suggest that she was happiest as a deputy rather than a leader.<br>
<br>Winefrid Wigmore has come in for criticism from recent biographers of Mary Ward for the role she played in the events leading to the suppression of the institute. Evidence of the mounting pressure on the papacy in the 1620s to impose enclosure on Mary and her followers can be seen in Flanders as well as Italy. There was a dissatisfied group of members within the Li&egrave;ge foundation opposed to their foundress and by 1630 the house had been operating for nine years without a visit from Mary. When Winefrid was sent by Mary as visitor, only diplomatic negotiations could have prevented serious difficulties. Unfortunately her overwhelming loyalty to Ward and her determination to impose obedience to the founder led to open hostility in Li&egrave;ge. Winefrid deposed the superior, Mary Copley, and the ensuing rows were investigated by the papal nuncio and reported to Rome. The result gave ammunition to those in the Catholic church who sought the suppression of the institute on the grounds that its continuation would directly challenge papal authority as well as break the Tridentine ruling on enclosure. The institute was suppressed by papal bull in 1631 and Winefrid was temporarily imprisoned. Many of the members at Li&egrave;ge left, although a few transferred to Munich, which like the house in Rome remained open but severely restricted in its activities.<br>
<br>However, in the longer term Winefrid, together with Mary Poyntz and the other companions, was important in keeping the institute together after Mary Ward's death in 1645. The suppression by papal bull should have ended the institute but in practice, while it had an immediate and catastrophic effect at Li&egrave;ge and seriously damaged other houses, the &#145;English ladies&#146; were able to negotiate the survival of both the Paradeiser House in Munich and the house in Rome. Provided they acted circumspectly and lived with the appearance of being lay women in tiny groups, members of the institute were permitted to live communally. In the 1630s Winefrid remained in Rome with Mary Ward, acting as novice mistress, secretary, and Mary's nurse. The house seems to have had about twenty members in this period.<br>
<br>Winefrid accompanied Mary on her last journey to England in 1637, remaining with her, first in London and then in Yorkshire, until the latter's death in 1645. In spite of her length of service to Mary Ward, it was not Winefrid who was appointed to head the next stage in the institute's existence: she was always happier in a subsidiary role. Initially permitted to remain at Hewarth by their Catholic landlord, his later decision to reclaim the house occasioned new moves. The defeat of the royalists and the execution of the king in January 1649 increased the dangers of remaining in England. The gift of 500 pistols by the exiled royalist Edward Somerset, second marquess of Worcester, to Mary Poyntz enabled the remaining members under the leadership of Barbara Babthorpe to relocate to Paris in 1650. Here a school was established for English girls with Winefrid as headmistress. She died in April 1657 and was buried in the cemetery of the Bernadine nuns in Paris.<br>
<br>Winefrid Wigmore was self-effacing and left few records of her own contribution to the foundation of the institute that can be clearly identified, choosing to focus on the leadership of Mary Ward. Shortly after the foundress's death, Winefrid and Mary Poyntz composed the first biography of Mary Ward (the &#145;Brief relation&#146; or &#145;Vita E&#146;) and chose the subjects for the <span class="roman">Painted Life</span>, a series of fifty oils with captions giving an account of significant events in her religious life. Probably of continental provenance, the latter works represented a remarkable and original choice of medium. A set of reproductions survive at the Bar convent in York. The Mary Ward sisters are now the Congregation of Jesus.<br>
