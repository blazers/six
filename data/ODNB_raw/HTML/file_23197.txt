<span class="headword">Rawlinson, Sir  William</span>  (1640&#150;1703), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born on 16 June 1640 at Graythwaite, Lancashire, the second son of William Rawlinson (1606&#150;1680) of Graythwaite and Rusland Hall, Lancashire, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1683), daughter of Anthony Sawrey of Plumpton, Lancashire. Rawlinson attended Hawkshead School, run by a Mr Bordley. On 13 April 1655 he was admitted to Christ's College, Cambridge, and on 20 February 1657 he was admitted to Gray's Inn. Rawlinson was called to the bar in 1667, where he emerged as a regular pleader in chancery cases, being the third most frequent pleader in 1680.<br>
<br>In April 1686 Rawlinson was made a serjeant-at-law, being sponsored by Laurence Hyde, first earl of Rochester, and Sir John Trevor. Following the revolution he was named on 1 March 1689 as one of three commissioners of the great seal, and knighted on the 5th. When Sir John Maynard (his wife's grandfather) was removed as a commissioner of the great seal in May 1690 and Sir Anthony Keck resigned, Rawlinson was continued in post along with two new appointees, Sir John Trevor and Sir George Hutchins. In November 1690 Rawlinson appeared before the House of Lords to oppose a bill regulating the court of chancery. He continued as a commissioner until Sir John Somers was made lord keeper in March 1693. Somers was instrumental in denying Rawlinson promotion to be chief baron of the exchequer, arguing that his inexperience in the &#145;course of the exchequer&#146;  (Sachse, 93) rendered him unfit for the office. Instead the incumbent, Sir Robert Atkyns, remained in post, and by late March Rawlinson had resumed his private practice in chancery. In February 1694 he appeared before the Lords in the high-profile <i>Montagu v. Bath</i> case. On 8 March that year Rawlinson appeared before a committee of the Lords considering the bill for settling the estate of Sir John Maynard, and he appears to have secured a clause on his wife's behalf. In May 1695 Sir John Lowther of Lowther, second baronet, the future Viscount Lonsdale, was promoting Rawlinson to succeed Atkyns as chief baron, but again to no avail. In April 1697 Rawlinson again appeared before the Lords as counsel in the <i>Montagu v. Bath</i> case, and in October 1697 he appeared as counsel when the duke of Devonshire and the marquess of Normanby went to chancery over the purchase of Berkeley House.<br>
<br>Rawlinson died in Hendon of apoplexy on 11 May 1703 and was buried in the church at Hendon, where he had purchased the old mansion owned by the Whichcotes in Brent Street. He was survived by his second wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1712), daughter of Edward Noseworthy of Devon and his wife, Honora, daughter of Sir John Maynard. He had two daughters by his first wife (whose identity is unknown): Anne, who predeceased her father and who in 1694 married John Aislabie; and Elizabeth, who married in 1687 William Lowther, a barrister of the Middle Temple and the son of Sir John Lowther of Lowther, first baronet, by his second wife, and, secondly, in 1702 Giles Earle, son of Sir Thomas Earle, MP and mayor of Bristol.<br>
