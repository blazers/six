<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tennant,  William</span>  (1784&#150;1848), <span class="occ">scholar of oriental languages and poet</span>, son of Alexander Tennant, merchant and farmer, and Anna Watson, was born in Anstruther, Fife, on 16 May 1784. He lost the use of both feet in childhood, and used crutches throughout his life. After receiving his elementary education at the burgh school in Anstruther, where he was a contemporary of Thomas Chalmers (1780&#150;1847), he studied at St Andrews University for two years (1799&#150;1801), but he was forced to leave early for financial reasons. On returning to his parental home in 1801 Tennant steadily pursued his literary studies. For a time he acted as clerk to his brother Alexander, a corn factor, first in Glasgow and then at Anstruther. Owing to a crisis in business his brother disappeared, and Tennant suffered a short period of imprisonment for his brother's debts at the instance of the creditors. He began the study of Hebrew about this time, while continuing to increase his knowledge of classical languages.<br>
<br>While at St Andrews, Tennant made some respectable verse translations and a Scottish ballad, &#145;The Anster Concert&#146; (1811): although a piece of light verse, based on the medieval poem &#145;Christ's kirk on the green&#146;, it demonstrates his interest in native verse traditions. With <span class="italic">Anster Fair</span>, published anonymously in 1812 by William Cockburn in Anstruther, Tennant instantly achieved greatness. Based on the Fife folk-song &#145;Maggie Lauder&#146;, it combines local folk tradition with Italian elements drawn principally from Tasso's <span class="italic">Orlando Furioso</span>, and is composed in the style of a mock epic. Following publication Tennant received the praise of Alexander Fraser Tytler, Lord Woodhouselee, and a revised edition, published at Tennant's own expense, was issued in 1814 and won from Lord Jeffrey a warm reception in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>; he described it there both as &#145;eminently original&#146; and &#145;bold and vigorous&#146; and referred to Tennant as a &#145;kind of prodigy&#146;  (Jeffrey). Six editions of the poem appeared in the author's lifetime.<br>
<br>Tennant's father's house had long been a centre of literary activity&#151;a focal point for gatherings of visitors and townsfolk with literary interests and a desire for self-improvement&#151;and Tennant's own literary aspirations were encouraged by this atmosphere. In 1813 he formed, along with Captain Charles Gray, Matthew Conolly (his biographer), and others, the Anstruther Musomanik Society, the members of which, according to their code of admission, assembled to enjoy &#145;the coruscations of their own festive minds&#146;  (Conolly, <span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 213). The main purpose of the society was to recite verse, much of which was composed expressly for the meetings. Honorary members of proved poetic worth, including James Hogg, were admitted, Sir Walter Scott assuring the members, on receipt of his diploma in 1815, of the pleasure the award gave him, and of his best wishes for their healthy indulgence in &#145;weel-timed daffing&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>In 1813 Tennant was appointed parish schoolmaster of Dunino, 5 miles from St Andrews. The close proximity of the university and its library gave him the opportunity not only to develop his Hebrew scholarship, but also to gain a knowledge of Arabic, Syriac, and Persian, and here he also became acquainted with scholars such as Hugh Cleghorn. In 1816, through the influence of Burns's friend George Thomson and others, Tennant became schoolmaster at Lasswade, Midlothian. In 1819, the year in which his edition of Allan Ramsay's poems was published, he was elected teacher of classical and oriental languages at the Dollar Academy, Clackmannanshire, and held the post with distinction until 1834, when Jeffrey, then lord advocate for Scotland, appointed him professor of Hebrew and oriental languages in St Mary's College, St Andrews, where Tennant established a reputation for being a talented and well-liked lecturer.<br>
<br>None of Tennant's later literary work, however, lived up to the initial promise of <span class="italic">Anster Fair</span>. In 1822 he published <span class="italic">The Thane of Fife</span>, a serious attempt at epic poetry concerning the Danish invasion of the ninth century. The first part of the poem was so poorly received that he never completed it. In 1823 appeared <span class="italic">Cardinal Beaton</span>, a tragedy in five acts, and in 1825 <span class="italic">John Baliol</span>, a historical drama. Tennant returned to the formula of the mock epic in 1827, with his <span class="italic">Papistry Storm'd, or, The Dingin Doon o' the Cathedral</span>. Written entirely in Scots, it concerned the destruction of St Andrews Cathedral at the Reformation, and is another example of his local patriotism, which combined comic elements with an indebtedness to the verse style of Sir David Lindsay. He published a number of works which reflected his interest in oriental languages, including five &#145;Hebrew Idylls&#146;, contributed to the <span class="italic">Scottish Christian Herald</span> in 1836&#150;7, and a <span class="italic">Syriac and Chaldee Grammar</span>, which became a popular textbook. In 1830 Tennant became a contributor to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Literary Journal</span>, publishing prose translations from Greek and German, and discussing with Hogg the value of issuing a new metrical version of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span>, in a correspondence which was published in 1830.<br>
<br>William Tennant retired, owing to ill health, in 1848, but continued to write and to research. He died, unmarried, at Devon Grove, Clackmannanshire, on 14 October 1848, and was buried at Anstruther, where an obelisk monument with a Latin inscription was raised to his memory.<br>
