<span class="headword">Stewart,  Alfred Walter</span>  (1880&#150;1947), <span class="occ">chemist and novelist</span>, was born on 5 September 1880 at 18 Annfield Terrace, Partick, Glasgow, the youngest of three sons of the Revd William Stewart, professor of divinity and biblical criticism at Glasgow University, and his wife, Jane (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Richardson). He was educated at Glasgow high school, Glasgow University (BSc, 1902; DSc, 1907), and the University of Marburg, where he worked for a year with Ernst Carl Theodor Zincke (1902&#150;3). In 1903 he went, with a scholarship, to University College, London, where he began his first original work. Supported from 1905 by a Carnegie research fellowship, he carried out at University College doctoral research on the reaction of aliphatic ketones with bisulfite and hydroxylamine, leading him to the conclusion that the contemporary theory of steric hindrance in chemical reactions was inadequate and required revision.<br>
<br>Stewart's studies on the selective absorption spectra of organic compounds (1906) led to the concept of isorrepsis, which, expressed two decades before the application of electronic theory to organic chemistry, foreshadowed later ideas of resonance. His interest in stereochemistry, developed from his studies of the relationship between absorption spectra and chemical constitution, led to his first book, <span class="italic">Stereochemistry</span> (1907), followed by <span class="italic">Recent Advances in Organic Chemistry</span> (1908; 8th edn, 1948), its companion volume <span class="italic">Recent Advances in Physical and Inorganic Chemistry</span> (1909), and two more general works, <span class="italic">Chemistry and its Borderland</span> (1914) and <span class="italic">Some Physico-Chemical Themes</span> (1922).<br>
<br>In 1909 Stewart became lecturer in organic chemistry at Queen's University, Belfast. From 1914 he was for five years lecturer in physical chemistry and radioactivity at Glasgow University, before returning to Queen's University, Belfast, as professor of chemistry in 1919. While at Glasgow, Stewart married, on 5 September 1916, Jessie Lily Coats (<i>b</i>. 1884/5), daughter of a Baptist church minister, the Revd Jervis Coats of Glasgow, and his wife, the late Marion Wark Wyllie. The couple, who were married by the bride's father, had one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1908 Stewart isolated the unstable organic compound ketene. In 1918 he proposed the name &#145;isobares&#146; (later isobars) to designate elements with the same atomic weights but different atomic numbers. His main research during his second tenure at Queen's University was Tesla luminescence spectra. He developed a new field of emission spectroscopy by using a new method of excitation (the discharge of a high-tension transformer through a gaseous phase) to reveal series of spectra which he correlated with the structure of many organic compounds. However, Stewart was essentially a chemist of the classical pre-quantum mechanics tradition, and in his later years his <span class="roman">Recent Advances</span> series lost relevance and authority.<br>
<br>Aside from his textbooks, Stewart's greatest scientific contribution was as an inspiring teacher. Many of his students later occupied important industrial and academic positions. A small, unassuming, moustached polymath with broad interests and wide learning, he was a strikingly effective lecturer with an excellent sense of humour, fertile imagination, and a fantastically retentive memory.<br>
<br>When Stewart's creative talents were no longer fulfilled by writing technical articles, he turned to fiction. In his later years he lectured only from about 11 a.m. to 1.15 p.m. and spent his afternoons writing novels, to which he devoted all his time after ill health forced his retirement in 1944. He was the author of twenty-seven novels&#151;twenty-five of them detective stories. Written under the pseudonym J. J. Connington, they earned Stewart a reputation as a novelist which overshadowed his reputation as a scientist. His first novel, <span class="italic">Nordenholt's Million</span> (1923), a pseudo-scientific thriller, is one of the few of his books to deal with chemical subjects&#151;the nitrogen cycle and nuclear energy. His detective novels were praised by Dorothy Sayers, St John Ervine, and other writers and critics.<br>
<br>Stewart's last novel was published in 1943, but he continued writing until the end of his life. He died of a heart attack at his home, 83 Balmoral Avenue, Belfast, on the morning of 1 July 1947, while engaged in his literary work.<br>
