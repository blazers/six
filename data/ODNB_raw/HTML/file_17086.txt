<span class="headword">Lowe,  Peter</span>  (<em>c.</em>1550&#150;1610), <span class="occ">surgeon and founder of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow</span>, may have been born in the west of Scotland. The exact date and location of his birth are unknown and have been the subject of debate. Lowe described himself variously as &#145;Arellian&#146; (perhaps relating to Errol, or to the University of Orl&eacute;ans) and &#145;Scottishman&#146;. He left Scotland about 1566 and travelled to France, where he remained for some thirty years, serving the Spanish army, the French army, and the French royal household, and experiencing the traumas of events such as the St Bartholomew's day massacre, when he is reputed to have been hidden in the king's wardrobe to avoid capture and probable execution  (Finlayson, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 23). The nature of his medical and surgical training is unclear, although the available evidence suggests that he may have received some medical training at the University of Orl&eacute;ans and also become a master surgeon (academic, or &#145;gown-surgeon&#146;) of the College of St C&ocirc;me, the historic fraternity of surgeons in Paris, the latter being the stronger possibility. Travel, study, and service abroad were entirely typical pursuits for the physicians and surgeons of the time, and the natural destination for Scots was Europe. Whatever his real qualifications, Lowe was clearly an educated man and highly regarded within the upper ranks of French society. He left France around 1596 after serving as surgeon to Henri IV for some six years, and was in London at the time of the publication of his treatise <span class="italic">An Easie, Certain and Perfect Method to Cure and Prevent the Spanish Sickness</span>, dedicated to Robert Devereux, earl of Essex.<br>
<br>Lowe returned to Scotland and was in residence in Glasgow by early 1598. In August of that year he fell foul of the Glasgow presbytery, being ordered to &#145;mak as yet two Sondayes his repentance on the pillar&#146;, no doubt for some minor moral misdemeanour  (Finlayson, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 26). In March 1599 he was contracted by the town council to treat the poor of the town, at a salary of 80 merks a year. Later that year, after petitioning James VI about the unorganized and primitive state of medicine and surgery in Glasgow, Lowe, together with physician Robert Hamilton and apothecary William Spang, was granted a charter (dated 29 November 1599) allowing them to supervise and examine all surgical practitioners in the west of Scotland. Thus came into being a unique organization, encompassing both physicians and surgeons, which continues as the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow.<br>
<br>In addition to his historical significance in terms of the Glasgow institution, Lowe's publications were equally important. His major work, <span class="italic">The Whole Course of Chirurgerie</span> (1597), was written in the vernacular, a move which could have attracted much criticism from contemporaries, who favoured Latin as the legitimate medium for academic discourse. It was constructed partly in the form of a catechism, or conversation between the author and a student, and partly a description of surgical techniques, medical treatments, and examples from his practice in France. The second edition of the book implies that his son John was the second party in the catechism, although at the time he was still a child. Lowe's translation, probably from the French, of the <span class="italic">Presages of Hippocrates</span> is included in the work, which was republished on a number of occasions, being retitled <span class="italic">A Discourse of the Whole Art of Chirurgerie</span> from the second edition, published in 1612. Interestingly, though perhaps typically, many of the illustrations in the book are copied directly&#151;in some cases with the French titles reproduced&#151;from the works of Ambroise Par&eacute;. He refers frequently in his published works to several other books in preparation, notably a &#145;poor man's guide&#146;, a treatise on parturition and the diseases of women, sometimes referred to as the &#145;Book of the infantment&#146;, and a book on the plague, but there is no evidence that any of these was published formally.<br>
<br>It is evident from his testament that Lowe had married twice, as it is stated that &#145;Helen Wemyss now his spous should have nane of his guidis nor geir quhill his first wyffis bairnes were payit of sevin thousand and fyve hundreth merkis&#146;  (Finlayson, <span class="italic">Testament</span>, 2). Helen Wemyss was the daughter of David Wemyss, the first protestant minister in Glasgow after the Reformation, who was rector of Glasgow University on several occasions between 1593 and 1602. Lowe's son John was apparently the son of his first wife, while Helen Wemyss was the mother of his daughter Christian, who was also provided for under the terms of the testament. Lowe died in Glasgow on 15 August 1610  (Finlayson, <span class="italic">Testament</span>, 2, from Commissariot Records). The preface to the second edition of <span class="italic">Chyrurgerie</span> is dated 1612, but this is likely to be a publisher's error. He was buried in the grounds of Glasgow Cathedral. He had been active in practice until a few months previously, as he was paid &pound;40 by the Glasgow town council on 15 May 1610 as his fee for &#145;bowelling&#146; (embalming) the laird of Houston. Lowe's memorial stone bears an appealing inscription:<blockquote>Stay, passenger and view this stone, for under it lyis such a one who cuired many whill he lieved, soe gracious he noe man grieved. Yea when his phisicks force oft failed, his pleasant purpose then prevailed. For of his God he got the grace to live in mirth and die in peace. Heavin hes his soul, his corps this stone, sigh, passenger, and soe be gone.</blockquote>
