<span class="headword">Copley,  John Singleton</span>, Baron Lyndhurst  (1772&#150;1863), <span class="occ">politician and lord chancellor</span>, was born at Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts, before the American War of Independence and died in London after the outbreak of the American Civil War.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducation"></a>Early years and education</h2>Copley was born on 21 May 1772, the elder son of the distinguished portrait painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6271/', "John Singleton Copley (1738&#150;1815)")</script> and Susannah Farnham (1745&#150;1836), the daughter of Richard Clarke, a loyalist and principal agent of the East India Company in Boston. As a result of the increasing political turmoil of the early 1770s his father's income dwindled. In June 1774 Copley sen. left for England and Italy, to &#145;enjoy a long-denied visit and return after the tempest [of colonial unrest] had blown itself out&#146;  (Prown, 1.87). His wife and three of his four children went to England in May of the following year. Neither Copley sen. nor his wife ever returned to America. In 1783 the family moved to 25 George Street, Hanover Square, London. No. 25, later enlarged with the purchase of no. 24, was to be the younger Copley's London home for the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>Educated at a private school, Manor House, in Chiswick, Copley entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1790. His academic career was distinguished: a first-class classicist and second wrangler in the mathematical tripos (1794), &#145;having adopted the subject within these nine months, whereas several of my opponents have been labouring for years&#146;, he was elected, by examination, to a fellowship of his college, which he held from 1795 to 1804. His affection for Trinity and the university remained undiminished and he regarded his election as high steward (1840) as one of the chief honours of his life.<br>
<br>As an undergraduate it was said that he became a &#145;mighty Jacobin&#146; and a fervent supporter of the French Revolution. But in his account, to the vice-chancellor, of his travels in the United States he professed himself a &#145;fierce aristocrat&#146; and extolled that country as the &#145;country to cure your Jacobins. Send them over and they will return quite converted&#146;  (Amory, 145). His contemporaries at the bar, such as Sir Thomas Denman, then a friend, would have been surprised to read this protestation. Viscount Althorp was present during the debate on the second <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> and heard Lyndhurst's vehement protest that he &#145;never was a Whig&#146;:<blockquote>[the Attorney-General (Denman)], who stood next to me, pressed my arm tightly, saying, Villain! No he was a Democrat. When I was a young man, he took me to a dinner of the friends of the people. The violence of the speeches startled me, and I could not help observing that I thought his friends went too far, for there must be some honest Tories. &#145;No&#146;, he (Lord Lyndhurst) answered, &#145;it is impossible; an honest Tory is a contradiction in terms&#146;. (Le Marchant, 350&#150;51)</blockquote>Copley was welcomed in Boston by relatives and friends. But the visit was tinged with disappointment for he vainly sought to recover the family lands on Beacon Hill; he was advised to compromise his father's claims and did so, accepting a sum of about &pound;4200. On his return from the United States he decided to become a barrister, but his limited means compelled him to spend the next seven years learning the mysteries of special pleading in the chambers of the immortal William Tidd. It was only a loan of &pound;1000 from Gardiner Greene, a Boston merchant, married to his eldest sister, Elizabeth, which enabled him to be called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1804. He then joined the midland circuit.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareerto1826"></a>Early career to 1826</h2>Copley appeared to have all the talents for immediate success: he was distinguished in appearance, clever, articulate, and &#145;among his many natural gifts, the rich melodious tone of his voice was not the least&#146;  (Le Marchant, 351). But his progress was relatively slow. By 1807 his mother, to whom he was devoted, could write that: &#145;his prospects are satisfactory, and remove our anxious concern on that score &hellip; He has made a great advance and says, he must style himself, as others do, &#147;a lucky dog&#148;&#146;  (Amory, 284&#150;5). His income was, however, only &#145;satisfactory&#146; for some years thereafter.<br>
<br>Copley came into prominence in 1812 with his defence of one of the leading Luddites, John Ingham, who was indicted at the Nottingham assizes and charged with the capital offences of rioting and the destruction of machinery. The acquittal, which was hugely popular, was on a technicality since the indictment misdescribed the trade of Ingham's employers. In the following year Copley became a serjeant-at-law, a recognition of his growing professional reputation. <i>Bovill v. Moore</i>, in 1816, was a particularly important landmark. In that case, he mastered the specifications of the patent which his client's machine had allegedly infringed. His command of the facts and law persuaded the jury to reject the plaintiff's claim. Thereafter he was the acknowledged leader of his circuit. The increased income was particularly welcome after the death of his father in 1815. The burden of supporting the London family fell upon him, as did the moral obligation, which he gradually discharged, of paying off his father's many creditors.<br>
<br>It was the trial in 1817 for high treason of Watson and Thistlewood, two of the Spa Fields rioters, which brought Copley to the attention of tory ministers. His address to the jury, ridiculing the indictment that they had levied war against the king, helped to secure their acquittal. Lord Campbell, who vilified Lyndhurst in his <span class="italic">Lives of the Lord Chancellors</span>, described his address as &#145;one of the ablest and most effective ever delivered in a court of justice&#146;  (Campbell, 8.17). Henry Crabbe Robinson was equally impressed: &#145;He said nothing that was not to the purpose. There was no idle or superfluous passages in his speech&#146;  (H. C. Robinson, <span class="italic">Diary, Reminiscences and Correspondence</span>, 1869&#150;70, 2.361).<br>
<br>Such successes led to the crown retaining Copley in a number of state trials for treason. The tories had few able lawyers in the House of Commons, and Lord Castlereagh, who had sat through Watson's trial, realized that Copley was an obvious candidate. In March 1818 he accepted Lord Liverpool's invitation to enter the house, and became a member for the rotten borough of Yarmouth in the Isle of Wight, before being returned for Ashburton at the general election later the same year. In October 1819 he was knighted, and switched seats again in 1826 to the University of Cambridge. Denman and other whigs never forgave his &#145;dereliction of principle&#146;  (Arnould, 63); &#145;he had no more formed opinion that Toryism was true than he had that Mahometanism was true&#146;  (Bagehot, 3.232, 236).<br>
<br>Copley may have given no pledge to Liverpool; but he consistently supported the government. His political advancement was swift. In February 1819 he became chief justice of Chester and king's serjeant and, in June of that year, solicitor-general, succeeding Sir Robert Gifford. In the house he defended Castlereagh's six bills but did not otherwise take an active part in debates. He was one of the counsel who led the prosecution of the Cato Street conspirators for high treason (1819) and in the same year supported the bill of pains and penalties against Queen Caroline, earning the praise of her counsel, Denman, for his able cross-examination. In January 1824 he succeeded Gifford as attorney-general.<h2>
<a name="Masteroftherollslordchancellorandchiefbaronoftheexchequer18261834"></a>Master of the rolls, lord chancellor, and chief baron of the exchequer, 1826&#150;1834</h2>In September 1826 Copley succeeded Gifford as master of the rolls, a judicial office which he could hold while retaining his seat in the house. On Lord Eldon's resignation in the following year he was appointed lord chancellor and was raised to the peerage as Baron Lyndhurst of Lyndhurst. He served successively under Canning, Goderich, and Wellington. The tory government fell in 1830 and Earl Grey took office. With Lord Brougham's support, Grey surprisingly offered Lyndhurst the office of chief baron of the exchequer. After consulting the duke of Wellington, Sir Robert Peel, and Lord Aberdeen, he decided to accept the offer, knowing that he &#145;should be subjected to so much obloquy and abuse&#146;  (Lyndhurst MSS, Trinity College, Cambridge); &#145;a judicial office, wholly unconnected with politics&#146;  (Martin, 295) was his apologia. He took his seat in January 1831. &pound;7000 p.a. was more attractive than a pension of &pound;4000 to a man who spent too freely. Wellington well knew that &#145;he cannot live without place, as he has no property and he has already expended <i>three years</i> beforehand his salary&#146;  (A. Aspinall, ed., <span class="italic">Three Early Nineteenth Century Diaries</span>, 1952, 4 n. 2). Lady Lyndhurst's influence over Grey, who even toyed with the possibility of keeping Lyndhurst as lord chancellor, may have been instrumental in securing Lyndhurst's appointment; indeed Arbuthnot suspected that Lyndhurst was already intriguing with the whigs. Possibly Lyndhurst had led Grey to believe that he would not actively oppose government bills and, in return, may have been offered the reversion to the office of lord chief justice. But if any bargain was made, it was soon to be broken.<br>
<br>Greville predicted that &#145;the public will gain by the transaction, because they will get a good judge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 2.89). That prediction proved to be true, for Lyndhurst's brief tenure as chief baron (1830&#150;34) earned even Campbell's praise. He revived a moribund court which became popular with suitors. Whitwell Elwin records he had the &#145;power of summing up evidence with such terseness, completeness and exactness from memory alone&#146;  (Martin, 283).<br>
<br>Nowhere were these skills better demonstrated than in <i>Small v. Attwood</i> in 1832, a dispute which centred on the sale, allegedly induced by the seller's fraudulent misrepresentations, of coal and iron mines in Staffordshire. At the trial, which lasted twenty-one days, Lyndhurst was confronted with a web of tangled facts, complex calculations, and voluminous documents and depositions. But his judgment &#145;was entirely oral, and without even referring to any notes &hellip; Never once did he falter or hesitate, and never once was he mistaken in a name, a figure, or a date&#146;  (Campbell, 8.73). It was &#145;one of the ablest judgments ever delivered&#146;  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 2.330).<br>
<br>Lyndhurst was not a judge who revelled in the niceties of fine legal argument. His judgments do not contain an &#145;ample exposition of the principles applicable to other disputes&#146;. He was one of those judges:<blockquote>who always decide on the particular case before them rightly, who have a nice insight into all that concerns it, are acute discerners of fact, accurate weighers of testimony, just discriminators of argument. Lord Lyndhurst is perhaps as great a judge in this kind as it is easy to fancy. If a wise man had a good cause, he would prefer its being tried before Lyndhurst to its being tried before anyone else. (Bagehot, 3.159, 180&#150;81)</blockquote>Lyndhurst never pretended to be a &#145;chancery man&#146;. Unlike Eldon he was not concerned to establish himself as a master of equitable doctrines. As chief baron, he assigned most of the equity business to Baron Alderson, and from the woolsack he delivered few memorable legal speeches.<br>
<br>Lyndhurst became very influential in the House of Lords. Disraeli said he was a &#145;pleader rather than an orator, and never a debater&#146;  (Monypenny, 1.330). Sir Denis Le Marchant commented that he was:<blockquote>always a complete master of his argument, his premises being so skilfully laid that his conclusions were almost irresistible: nothing could be more clear, distinct and logical than his handling of a subject&#151;at least according to his view of it; but he grappled with no difficulties he was not sure to overcome. (Le Marchant, 351)</blockquote>His mind was a lawyer's mind. Hence, Wellington's comment: &#145;[you are] not only the first speaker in the House of Lords, but &hellip; the first in your own profession&#146;  (Amory, 371&#150;2). Lyndhurst rarely appealed to the emotions. Irony and sarcasm were his telling weapons. So, he looked upon &#145;what proceeded from [Wetherell on the <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Bill</span>, 1829] rather as the ravings of a disordered imagination, than as emanations from an enlightened and sagacious understanding&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 2</span>, 21, 1829, col. 192).<br>
<br>As solicitor-general and lord chancellor Lyndhurst spoke against Catholic emancipation in 1827 and in its favour in 1829. In 1827 he argued that concessions should be granted only if the Catholic community offered &#145;security&#146; that civil liberties would not be usurped, the authority of the church would not be endangered, and there would be no &#145;foreign interference&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 2</span>, 16, 1827, col. 905ff.)&#151;an argument which Denman dismissed as &#145;bad&#151;politically, morally, and intellectually&#146;  (Arnould, 1.201). In 1829 Lyndhurst's defence of the government's volte-face was equally vigorous. Change, consistent with &#145;security&#146;, was necessary if Ireland was to be governed without coercion; and that security had now been offered and accepted. These were higher considerations than personal consistency. The ultras were not mollified. They combined with the whigs to bring down Wellington's government.<br>
<br>The 1831 and 1832 debates on the first and second reform bills were passionate. Lyndhurst was condemned for viewing &#145;[questions] only through the medium of party&#146;  (Le Marchant, 351); the interventions of this &#145;unblushing lawyer&#146;  (Kriegel, 178) were sneering, factious, mischievous, and imprudent. In his speeches on the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, in language reminiscent of Burke, he cautioned against change. &#145;Our constitution is not the work of a day.&#146; The <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> would destroy the &#145;nice balance&#146; of the constitution. There would be an &#145;entire change in the persons who are to elect and, consequently, an entire change in the persons elected&#146;; and the rights and privileges of the monarchy and the church would be endangered  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 8, 1831, col. 283 ff.). It was his wrecking amendment to the 1832 bill, to postpone discussion of the disfranchising clauses until the enfranchising clauses had been disposed of, which made a collision between the two houses inevitable  (Le Marchant, 418&#150;19). His confident assertion, that &#145;we are no less representative of the nation than the House of Commons&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 34, 1832, col. 888ff.), was particularly galling. The amendment was passed, and Grey resigned. On the tories failing to form a government, he resumed office. A constitutional crisis was only averted when, confronted with the threat to create enough peers to secure its enactment, the tory peers withdrew their opposition.<h2>
<a name="LordchancellortwicemoreandoppositionintheLords"></a>Lord chancellor twice more, and opposition in the Lords</h2>After his brief sojourn as lord chancellor in Peel's 100 days' administration in 1834, Lyndhurst was once more in opposition. The sessions of 1835 and 1836 were almost as tumultuous as those of 1831 and 1832. In 1835 Lyndhurst confided to Disraeli that the movement, which sought the radical reform of the country's institutions, could be stopped. He opposed any reform of municipal government, possibly in the hope of bringing down the government; so the tory-dominated House of Lords, encouraged by his speeches, drastically amended the <span class="roman">Municipal Corporations Bill</span> of 1835, which had won the broad support of Peel in the lower house. When the bill was once more debated in that chamber, Lord John Russell accepted some of its amendments, as did Peel who was anxious to reach a compromise. The House of Lords passed the bill in its amended form.<br>
<br>The debate on the <span class="roman">Irish Municipal Corporations Bill</span> of 1836, which Peel had unsuccessfully sought to amend, was even more heated. Lyndhurst infuriated O'Connell by saying that the Irish protestants &#145;had to contend with a population alien to Englishmen, speaking, many of them, a different language, professing a different religion, regarding the English as invaders, and ready to upset them on the first opportunity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 33, 1836, 734). Once again he invoked the independence of the House of Lords as the justification for its intervention. The government abandoned the bill after a conference failed to reach agreement.<br>
<br>On Disraeli's suggestion, in the same year Lyndhurst gave his first &#145;summary of the session&#146;; it was a telling catalogue of ill-considered bills, subsequently withdrawn. It was more restrained than his earlier speeches, and even praised by Holland as one of the &#145;best speeches he had ever heard in Parliament&#146;  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 3.362). But his acerbic attack on the government, in &#145;language reflecting on the Commons&#146;  (ibid.), was bound to be resented by his opponents.<br>
<br>Lyndhurst's combative speeches, praised by Disraeli in his <span class="italic">Vindication of the English Constitution</span> and in the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, won him parliamentary admirers. In 1835 and 1836 there was talk that the king wanted him as prime minister. But the king knew that he was &#145;inextricably bound&#146; to Peel  (Monypenny, 1.329); and a number of tory peers had second thoughts about the proposal to desert Peel for Lyndhurst. It is doubtful whether Lyndhurst sought, except momentarily, the burdens of the highest office. Disraeli may have exaggerated Lyndhurst's political support; three years earlier Holland had described the notion of his leadership of the tories as &#145;absurd&#146;  (Kriegel, 235), but Disraeli perceived that Lyndhurst's &#145;own disinclination [to become prime minister] alone stands in the way&#146;  (Monypenny, 1.304). The source of that &#145;disinclination&#146; was, not only his lack of high political ambition, but also the legacy of the fiery exchanges in the house during these years. In January 1837 he told Greville, on his return from a delightful four months in Paris:<blockquote>I suppose the Government will get on; I'm sure that I shall not go on in the House of Lords this year as I did the last. I was induced by circumstances and some little excitement to take a more prominent part than usual last session; but I don't see what I got by it except abuse. (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 3.378)</blockquote>Lord Holland and Viscount Melbourne vociferously complained about the bitterness of Lyndhurst's invective. But he chose to ignore their taunts of want of principle, which culminated in the prolonged hoots which greeted his appearance under the gallery of the House of Commons during its debate on the <span class="roman">Irish Bill</span> in 1837. Holland was told that he felt these insults &#145;most acutely&#146;  (Kriegel, 356); but, commented Greville, he &#145;neither attempted to stir, nor changed a muscle of his countenance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 3.389).<br>
<br>Lyndhurst was true to his words. After the furore of the <span class="roman">Irish Bill</span>, the years 1838&#150;40 were quieter years. He was more active in the judicial business of the house, although his &#145;summary of the session&#146; of 1839 was enlivened by his description of a discredited government, clinging to office.<br>
<br>In 1841 Lyndhurst became lord chancellor for the third time, in Peel's administration. Lyndhurst and Peel were never intimates. Disraeli wrote that Lyndhurst was jealous of Peel  (Monypenny, 1.301&#150;2). There is little evidence to support that view and their formal exchange of letters was invariably cordial. But Lyndhurst was not alone in thinking that Peel was an austere colleague. It may be that he was less influential in the cabinet, which Peel dominated, than he was in the House of Lords. But even in the house he played, politically, a more muted role. His interventions were generally confined to matters of legal reform, such as the <span class="roman">Copyright Bill</span> of 1843 and the ill-fated <span class="roman">Charitable Trusts Bill</span> of 1845. Not surprisingly, the attacks of his political opponents now became less vituperative.<br>
<br>Peel resigned in July 1846, leaving a party bitterly divided over the repeal of the corn laws. Lyndhurst's attempt to reunite it failed dismally. By the end of that decade Lyndhurst was totally blind; in 1850 a cataract operation partially restored his sight and a second was to follow. Nevertheless a year later he was on his feet in the House of Lords. He refused to take office in the first Derby administration of 1852. Lyndhurst enjoyed being an elder statesman, denouncing Russian aggrandizement (1853) and speaking passionately in 1859 and 1860 on the state of the national defences. These speeches of an octogenarian were admired for their undiminished force and clarity.<br>
<br>Lyndhurst did not welcome political change. But he earned praise as a law reformer. In the debate on the <span class="roman">Juvenile Offenders Bill</span> of 1838 Lyndhurst had drawn a dramatic picture of the horrific treatment of young children in reformatories; and in the following year he proposed the modification of the common law which gave a wife, separated from her husband, access to the children only with his permission. In 1853 and 1858 he supported the admission of Jews into parliament, demonstrating that the words of the oath, &#145;without mental reservation and on the true faith of a Christian&#146;, were inserted to exclude, not Jews, but Roman Catholics. In 1857, in the debate on the amendment of the divorce laws, his study of the church fathers enabled him to refute the bishop of Oxford, who had invoked St Augustine as authority for the dogma of the indissolubility of marriage. The previous year he had mocked Campbell's bill prohibiting the sale of obscene books, paintings, and prints. Correggio's <span class="italic">Jupiter and Antigone</span> would be confiscated, as well as Ovid's <span class="italic">Art of Love</span>; and Dryden's poem &#145;Sigismonda and Guiscerdo&#146; &#145;must be placed in [Lord Campbell's] <span class="italic">Index Expurgatorius</span>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 146, 1856, col. 330ff.). The last time he spoke in the house was in 1861 in the debate on Lord Kingsdown's act for the establishment of the validity of wills of personal estate.<h2>
<a name="Personallife"></a>Personal life</h2>On 13 March 1819 Lyndhurst married Sarah Garay Thomas, daughter of Charles Brunsden and niece of his friend Sir Samuel Shepherd, whose marriage of six weeks to Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Thomas of the Coldstream Guards ended with his death at Waterloo. She was then aged twenty-four or twenty-five, Lyndhurst forty-seven. Three of their five children died in infancy. Two daughters survived. Sarah Elizabeth (1821&#150;1865) married Henry Selwin-Ibbetson, later Lord Rookwood. Sophia Clarence (1828&#150;1911) married Hamilton Beckett; they had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Lady Lyndhurst was a handsome, striking woman, with intelligent black eyes, &#145;so like one of Leonardo da Vinci's pictures&#146;  (A. F. Stewart, <span class="italic">The Diary of a Lady in Waiting: Lady Charlotte Bury</span>, 1835, 200), whose &#145;passion leads her to the universe of clever men only&#146;  (Lady Dorchester, <span class="italic">Recollections of a Long Life: Lord Broughton (John Cam Hobhouse)</span>, 1910, 3.107). Indeed her various &#145;affairs&#146; with the powerful and the wealthy, including the duke of Devonshire  (J. Lees-Milne, <span class="italic">The Bachelor Duke, 1790&#150;1858</span>, 1991, 88, 91&#150;2, 102, 110) and Lord Dudley  (J. Gore, <span class="italic">Creevey's Life and Times, 1768&#150;1838</span>, 1934, 253&#150;4, 363), and her attempted &#145;rape&#146; by the king's brother, the duke of Cumberland, intrigued the London salons  (ibid., 307&#150;9). Mrs Arbuthnot, a high tory, found her &#145;a singularly vulgar woman&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Journal of Harriet, Mrs Charles Arbuthnot, 1822&#150;1832</span>, 1950, 2.258&#150;9). Lady Holland, a whig, was somewhat kinder; she was &#145;good hearted&#146; and &#145;good natured&#146; but &#145;with odd sallies &hellip; from coming into the <i>beau monde</i> when her ways were formed for another class&#146;  (earl of Ilchester, ed., <span class="italic">Elizabeth, Lady Holland to her Son, 1821&#150;1845</span>, 1946, 91). Even Lyndhurst's adoring sister, Mary, admitted that &#145;perhaps she had too high an opinion of the attractions of the world&#146;  (Amory, 351). She was quite manipulative. &#145;Having known what poverty is&#146;  (earl of Ilchester, ed., <span class="italic">The Journal of the Honourable Henry Edward Fox, 1818&#150;1830</span>, 1923, 359), she set out to charm whig grandees to secure her husband's advancement and her security. In turn they vainly hoped that her pro-reform views would persuade her husband not to oppose political change.<br>
<br>Lady Lyndhurst died, suddenly, in Paris on 15 January 1834. Mary wrote to her sister Mrs Greene that &#145;her brother was heartbroken&#146;. &#145;What a melancholy change have a few short months made in the family! Then all was bustle, gayety, and happiness, but now, alas! quite the reverse&#146;  (Amory, 351). But the less charitable doubted Lyndhurst's faithful devotion to &#145;Dolly&#146;, as she was affectionately called.<br>
<br>In many quarters Lyndhurst's personal reputation was no higher than that of his deceased wife. In 1840 William Whewell, soon to be master of Trinity, opposed Lyndhurst's election as high steward of the university, not only on the ground that he was a &#145;political adventurer&#146;, but also because of the many scandalous rumours about his private life which made him &#145;quite unfitted to hold academic office&#146;  (D. A. Winstanley, <span class="italic">Early Victorian Cambridge</span>, 1940, 100). Lyndhurst was quickly comforted after his wife's death. Within months he met Lady Henrietta Sykes, Disraeli's lover, who introduced him to Disraeli; so began a long friendship between the two men. For a short time Henrietta may well have been Lyndhurst's kept mistress. Disraeli and others agreed with her judgement that &#145;where women are concerned never was there a greater fool&#146;  (Blake, 118).<br>
<br>George Street was one of the centres of London fashion. The licence and ribaldry of Lyndhurst's conversation attracted adverse comment, as did his appearance which was more that of a cavalry colonel than a lord chancellor, dressing as he did in &#145;white Russia duck trousers, strapped under his boots of polished leather and in a becoming frock coat&#146;  (Lee, 124). At a great fancy ball in June 1835 he appeared as a marshall of France, and his guests were eighty of the &#145;supremist ton and beauty&#146;. Disraeli wrote to his sister: &#145;you can conceive nothing more splendid and brilliant than his house illuminated, with a banquet to a company so fancifully dressed&#146;  (Disraeli, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2, no. 408).<br>
<br>Paris was Lyndhurst's second home. He loved the company of its politicians and men of letters. On his return from Paris in January 1837 he told Greville that:<blockquote>he had never passed such an agreeable time as the last four months; not a moment of <i>ennui</i>; had become acquainted with a host of remarkable people of all sorts, political characters of all parties, and the <i>litt&eacute;rateurs</i>, such as Victor Hugo, Balzac, &amp;c., the latter of whom &hellip; is a very agreeable man. (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 3.378)</blockquote>Lyndhurst visited Paris almost every year, and was just as much at ease in the Parisian as in the London <i>haut monde</i>. On one such visit, in 1835, he dined with Louis Philippe, and twenty years later he met Louis Napoleon and the empress, remaining in &#145;active conversation, no other person present, for more than an hour&#146;  (Lee, 244). One of the Parisian &#145;political characters&#146; was Lewis Goldsmith, whose daughter Georgiana (1807?&#150;1901) Lyndhurst was to marry on 5 August 1837, much to the surprise of family and friends. Disraeli found her very different from Sarah:<blockquote>Without being absolutely pretty, her appearance is highly interesting &hellip; She is very little, but her appearance is elegant and delicate. She is not all national in the vulgar sense, her features being very small &hellip; Her manner calm and assured, yet tinged with a certain degree of reserve not unbecoming. (Disraeli, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 3, no. 733)</blockquote>It proved a very happy marriage. The couple spent their leisure time in Turville Park, near Henley-on-Thames, which Lyndhurst leased, and its small farm gave him much pleasure. Their one daughter, Georgiana Susan (1838&#150;1926), married Sir Charles Du Cane MP; they had two sons and three daughters.<h2>
<a name="Lateryearsandreputation"></a>Later years and reputation</h2>Historians have described Lyndhurst as a &#145;somewhat enigmatic figure&#146;  (Blake, 115). He died in the determination that this should be so, for he burnt nearly all his private papers. Condemned for his &#145;conversion&#146; to tory principles, a Proteus whose &#145;path to power was through the wreck of all political consistency&#146;  (Arnould, 1.408), once he entered the house as a tory he became an unswervingly loyal party man. He would not have gone to the stake for a principle his party had abjured. So it was that he was first against and then for the defendant's right to counsel in felony trials; against and within two years for Catholic emancipation; against any reform of the franchise, and within a year for some reform; for the corn laws, and shortly afterwards against the corn laws: &#145;He took up the opinions of the existing Government and advocated them, and to the end of his life would have thought it &#147;nonsense and rubbish&#148; to act otherwise&#146;  (Bagehot, 3.232, 236).<br>
<br>For many Lyndhurst appeared a paid advocate, who could not be trusted to be true to a principle. Campbell contemptuously accused him of repudiating &#145;all the opinions and sentiments which he had before entertained and expressed&#146; and castigated him, as solicitor-general, for piloting the detested <span class="roman">Six Acts</span> through the House of Commons. In a bitter and splenetic passage, he remarked that Lyndhurst's conduct had been compared to that of &#145;the mercenary soldier ready to obey every command of his superior officer&#146;  (Campbell, 8.30&#150;31). Campbell then went on to quote three lines from Lucan's <span class="italic">The Civil War (Pharsalia)</span>:<blockquote>
<div>Pectore si fratris gladium iuguloque parentis<br>
</div>
<div>Condore me jubeas &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>&hellip; invita peragam tamen omnia dextra.<br>
</div>(<div>Tell me to plunge my sword into my brother's breast<br>
</div>
<div>Or in my father's throat &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>And I shall do it all with this right hand,<br>
</div>
<div>Though it go against the grain.</div>)<br> (ibid., 1.376&#150;8)</blockquote>Lyndhurst did have some political convictions. He firmly believed that the House of Lords was a vital part of the constitution; he opposed the creation of life peers because he feared that governments would create them for political purposes, thereby further eroding its authority and independence. But he came to perceive, as he did not in the 1830s, that there were limits to its powers. In 1858 he described its role in these words:<blockquote>it is also a most important part of our duty to check against the rash, inconsiderate, hasty, and undigested legislation of the other House, to give time for consideration and for consulting and perhaps modifying the opinions of the constituencies, but I never understand, nor could such a principle be acted upon, that we were to make a firm, determined and persevering stand against the opinion of the other House of Parliament, when that opinion is backed by the opinion of the people, and least of all, on questions affecting, in a certain degree, the constitution of that House and popular rights. (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 149, 1858, cols. 1754&#150;6)</blockquote>Lyndhurst's intellectual pre-eminence was widely recognized. Disraeli said his mind was not original. But Disraeli judged him as a politician and, as a politician, he did not seek to originate; but he &#145;corrected, perfected, or improved much&#146;  (<span class="italic">QR</span>, 126, 1869, 29). He never ceased to be intellectually curious. After he had entered his ninetieth year, he went through the problems of Euclid to ascertain whether he was still capable of effort in mathematics. The posthumous sale of his library included classical, English, and French authors, although it was said that he read little before his retirement. At a later sale there were Old Master engravings and drawings, and paintings by his father, Titian, Van Dyck, Tintoretto, Canaletto, and Paulus Potter.<br>
<br>Lyndhurst &#145;both looked, and was, a great man&#146;  (Bagehot, 3.232). Disraeli described his brow as &#145;majestic&#146;; his deep-set eyes, gleaming &#145;with penetrating fire&#146;; he was a &#145;high-bred falcon&#146;. &#145;Indeed nothing could be finer than the upper part of his countenance &hellip; Nothing could be more beautiful. It was that of the Olympian Jove.&#146; But &#145;the lower part of his countenance betrayed the deficiencies of his character; a want of high purpose, and some sensual attributes&#146;  (Monypenny, 1.333). It was commonly said that &#145;the soubriquet of &#147;Mephistopheles&#148; admirably suited him; the mocking sneer was quickly followed by the genial smile&#146;.<br>
<br>Lyndhurst was condemned for his lack of <i>gravitas</i>, yet it was this very lack of <i>gravitas</i> which even political opponents could find endearing. Only the most salacious claimed that he was corrupt; in 1829 he successfully initiated criminal libel indictments against newspapers which alleged that he had sold church appointments and trafficked in political offices. A formidable political opponent, he was, in Brougham's view, &#145;free from all jealousy or petty spite&#146;  (Martin, 507). He took pains to placate Eldon; he enjoyed the company of radicals like Robert Wilson and Roebuck; he and Edward Ellice, a passionate Liberal, were &#145;great friends here [in Paris]&#146;  (C. C. F. Greville, <span class="italic">Journals of the Reigns of George IV and William IV</span>, 3.379); Brougham attacked him in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> and became his closest friend; Sydney Smith and Macaulay, loyal whigs, gratefully acknowledged his patronage. Nor did Lyndhurst, a devout Anglican, at least in later life, bear any religious grudges; he supported, it is true because it was expedient to do so, the <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Bill</span>, and, from conviction, the admission of Jews to parliament. Such a man would never sacrifice a colleague or friend for political or legal advancement.<br>
<br>Lyndhurst was content with the honours he enjoyed and the influence he exercised in the House of Lords; he was, lamented Henrietta Sykes, &#145;too unambitious&#146;  (Blake, 118). His love of society never left him; and society welcomed him for his gaiety and kindness. Granville, no tory, affirmed that he was totally without intellectual or social vanity. At Turville Park and George Street, surrounded by family, he entertained artists, authors, scientists, and beautiful and gifted women as well as politicians. Never bored, cosseted by a devoted wife, sister, and three daughters, supported by his friends, he was in 1863, as he was in 1791, &#145;naturally a friend to gaiety&#146;, continuing despite infirmity to &#145;love to see what is to be seen&#146;  (Amory, 116&#150;18). Lyndhurst died peacefully on 12 October 1863 at his house, 25 George Street, Hanover Square, London. He was buried on 17 October in Highgate cemetery and later, in 1865, reinterred in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
