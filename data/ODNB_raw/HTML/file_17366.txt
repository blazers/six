<span class="headword">Mac Bruaideadha family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1558&#150;1636), <span class="occ">historians and Gaelic poets</span>, became prominent in the later sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. They ran a school in co. Clare attended by bardic students from Munster and Ulster. Three main branches of the family are recorded, though their relationship is unclear. Flann and Bernard, sons of Conchobhar son of Maoil&iacute;n M&oacute;r, resided about 1637 in the parish of Moynoe on an ancestral holding in the termon, or &#145;sanctuary lands&#146;, of St Caim&iacute;n, patron saint of Iniscaltra. Flann and his father before him claimed headship of the family. They were keepers of the so-called psalter of St Caim&iacute;n, and are described as professional men of learning, or <i>aos ealadhna</i> (Esposito, 79; McGrath, 60&#150;61).<br>
<br>Another branch, with the patronymic Mac D&aacute;ire, were court poets to the earls of Thomond, as perhaps one of their ancestors had been. An ode to the &Oacute; Briain chief, Mathghamhain (<i>d</i>. 1369), elsewhere attributed to Maolmhuire <i>bacach</i> M&aacute;g Raith, is sometimes ascribed to an otherwise unknown Sea&aacute;n Buidhe Mac Bruaideadha (Royal Irish Academy, MSS 3, 7, 1387). The first datable poem of <a name="cosubject_73995"></a><span class="headword">Domhnall  mac D&aacute;ire Mhic Bhruaideadha</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1558&#150;1570)<span class="occ"></span>, <span class="italic">L&aacute; d&aacute; rabha &oacute;s r&aacute;ith Luimnigh</span>, celebrated the installation of Conchobhar &Oacute; Briain as third earl of Thomond in 1558. In <span class="italic">Ceolchar sin, a chruit mo r&iacute;ogh</span>, he laments the same earl's brief flight to France in 1570. He addressed a poem, <span class="italic">Cia as sine cairt ar chr&iacute;ch N&eacute;ill</span>, to the leader of the Desmond revolt, James fitz Maurice FitzGerald (<i>d</i>. 1579), and another to the earl of Clanricarde's son John, on his first assuming arms in the late 1560s, <span class="italic">A mhic, gur mheala t'arma</span>. A number of religious poems are also doubtfully ascribed to this author. Domhnall was the son of D&aacute;ire Mac Bruaideadha and Finola Gray; Tadhg mac D&aacute;ire Mhic Bhruaideadha is stated to have been brother to this Domhnall  (McGrath, 57).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_17366"></a><span class="headword">Maoil&iacute;n  &Oacute;g Mac Bruaideadha</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1602)<span class="occ"></span> belonged to a branch of the family who were mainly historians or <i>seanchaidhe</i>, though he himself composed bardic verse to the professional standard known as <i>d&aacute;n d&iacute;reach</i>. His now lost book of annals, covering the late sixteenth century, was drawn on by the four masters and a Westmeath scribe in the early seventeenth century. Presumably this was the original source for the obituary in 1563 of Diarmaid Mac Bruaideadha, <i>ollamh</i> of U&iacute; Bhrac&aacute;in and U&iacute; Fhearmaic (territories of Mac Gorm&aacute;in and &Oacute; Deagha). Diarmaid's brother and successor was Maoil&iacute;n &Oacute;g's father, Maoil&iacute;n the elder, who had risen to be <i>ollamh</i> in history to &Oacute; Briain before his death in 1582, at which a third brother, Giolla Brighde, became <i>ollamh</i>. The title had passed to Maoil&iacute;n &Oacute;g (&#145;M. the younger&#146;) by 1599.<br>
<br>In that year the insurgent army of Aodh Ruadh &Oacute; Domhnaill plundered co. Clare. Maoil&iacute;n &Oacute;g entered their camp and secured the return of his cattle by reciting a praise poem to Aodh Ruadh, of which only one verse survives  (Walsh, 1.210). Another, though undated, expression of anti-government feeling comes in the poem <span class="italic">Br&aacute;thair don bh&aacute;s an doidhbhreas</span> where he complains that an &Oacute; Briain chief, probably Sir Toirdhealbhach of Ennistimon  (<span class="italic">Catalogue of Irish Manuscripts</span>, 1.394), has dismissed him, and he appears to mock his patron's protestantism, desertion of old Gaelic customs, and indifference to relatives and poets. Yet before the poet's death on 31 December 1602 he had served the protestant cause by joining other Irish scholars at the new Trinity College near Dublin to prepare the text of an Irish translation of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> for publication  (McGrath, 61n.). Naturally the four masters' notice of his death lists his long historical poems on the genealogies of &Oacute; Briain, Mag Cochl&aacute;in, M&aacute;g Gorm&aacute;in, and others as his greatest achievements, combining literary merit and erudition. They awarded him the title <i>file</i>, or &#145;learned poet&#146;, seldom used by annalists about any scholar later than the twelfth century.<br>
<br>The four masters' own annalistic compilation is prefaced by a letter of recommendation from Maoil&iacute;n &Oacute;g's son, <a name="cosubject_73996"></a><span class="headword">Conchobhar Mac Bruaideadha <span class="st"> [Mac Bruadan]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em>1631&#150;1636)<span class="occ"></span>, then head of his family and successor to Tadhg mac D&aacute;ire as conductor of a school of history and literature at Lettermoylan, co. Clare, which had been attended by, among others, the German planter Matthew de Renzy. Antonius Bruodinus (<i>d</i>. 1680) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3784/', "Bruodin, Anthony")</script>], Scotist theologian and controversialist, guardian of the Irish Franciscan college in Prague, and a great-nephew of Domhnall and Tadhg mac D&aacute;ire, was the latest and arguably best-known scholar of this family.<br>
