<span class="headword">Cowley, Sir  John Guise</span>  (1905&#150;1993), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Mussooree, in the foothills of the Himalayas, during an earthquake on 20 August 1905, the son of the Revd Henry Guise Beatson Cowley, army chaplain, and his wife, Ethel Florence (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Prowse). When the family returned to England by ship John won a contest for the ugliest baby on board. His early years were spent in a Dorset village, where his father was the rector and Thomas Hardy was a neighbour. He recalled Hardy as a sad, wizened old man who spoke seldom but who occasionally, though an atheist, attended church services, at which he always asked Cowley's father to read the same passage from the <span class="roman">Bible</span>&#151;Elijah's vision of the earthquake.<br>
<br>Cowley was educated at Wellington College, Berkshire, and the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, before being commissioned into the Royal Engineers in 1925. His first posting was to Aldershot, where he recalled that on route marches the cooker was pulled by a horse while the cook walked behind trying to prepare a meal for the company when it halted; the cook always arrived black in the face from the smoke. In the general strike of 1926 Cowley was sent with a platoon to guard the waterworks at Luton. Before leaving he was warned by his very serious company commander, &#145;If you have to shoot, shoot to kill&#146;. Instead Cowley arranged a football match between his men and the strikers, whom he found &#145;an extremely pleasant and reasonable lot of men&#146;  (personal knowledge).<br>
<br>In 1932 Cowley was posted to the Madras sappers and miners, and later went on to Quetta, where he learned Urdu. In 1935 Quetta was devastated by an earthquake which killed 25,000 people and injured many more. The walls of the local civil hospital collapsed, bringing down the roof on the patients as they lay in their beds. Cowley arranged that the roof should be propped up enough to enable him to crawl under it and drag out the survivors, many of whom were suffering from contagious diseases to which he was fully exposed as he carried them in his arms, but his unflinching courage caused others to follow his example. The lepers were rescued by him personally. Cowley was awarded the Albert medal (in 1971 converted into the George Cross, the civilian equivalent of the VC).<br>
<br>In 1936 Cowley returned to become an instructor at Woolwich; three years later he became a student at the Staff College, Camberley. Before he had completed the Camberley course in 1939 he was posted to the War Office, where he organized the dispatch of the cavalry division, with 2000 horses, to Palestine (it was mechanized soon afterwards). In 1940 he was posted to the western desert army, where he recalled having to wake up General Wavell in the middle of the night and tell him the Australians had captured Sidi Barrani. Wavell then wrote a personal note to Churchill, but though Cowley was sitting within 4 feet of Wavell for half an hour, Wavell did not utter a word to him, not even &#145;Thank you&#146; or &#145;Good night&#146;. Wavell was noted for his extreme taciturnity. In 1941 Cowley was trapped in Tobruk by one of Rommel's sweeping counter-attacks but was evacuated by sea and then put in charge of the docks at Alexandria. He remembered being visited by a confident military police officer who told him he had come to stop pilfering in the docks. Cowley warned him that stopping this ancient and traditional practice might prove difficult. Six days later the officer reappeared, saying he could continue no longer as all his own equipment and stores had been stolen. Cowley was next appointed to the staff of 7th armoured division, and then to 30th corps, where he was made responsible for planning and supply arrangements. On 16 December 1941 he married (Irene) Sybil, daughter of Percy Dreville Millen, of Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire; they had a son and three daughters.<br>
<br>After the battle of El Alamein, Cowley was posted to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, to lecture about the war. His next postings were to allied forces headquarters at Caserta, near Naples, and to Brussels on the staff of the twenty-first army group, where his task was to help refugees and the homeless in Belgium and the Netherlands. Then came a move to Minden with a brief to restore the German economy. The Volkswagen factory lay in the British zone, and he recalled that as it had never functioned in peacetime it was inspected by various motoring experts who said it was inefficient, had no future, and that neither the works nor the designs should be acquired for British industry. Cowley subsequently spent a year at the Imperial Defence College, had a stint on the defence research policy staff, and then became director of administrative planning at the War Office. From 1953 he was chief of staff, headquarters, eastern command, before returning to the War Office as vice-quartermaster-general in 1956, just in time for the Suez crisis. He thought Anthony Eden seemed exhausted and mentally ill: the army wanted to land at Alexandria but Eden insisted on Port Said, which proved a disaster.<br>
<br>In 1957 Cowley became controller of munitions at the War Office. In this post he clashed with Duncan Sandys, the minister of supply, who thought that money should be spent on nuclear weapons rather than soldiers. Cowley pointed out that if nuclear weapons were ever used it would be the end of civilization. Sandys asked Macmillan to sack Cowley, but the prime minister refused. When the row died down Cowley was made master-general of the ordnance. He retired from the army in 1962 and on the day he left he was appointed a director of British Oxygen and Bowmaker. He soon joined other companies, but found time for the presidency of the New Forest Preservation Society and chairmanship of the governors of Wellington College and several other schools.<br>
<br>As a young man Cowley had been an excellent games player, first-class at squash, and had a golf handicap of three. Later he became a skilful bridge and croquet player. He traced the history of snooker back to Woolwich, where the &#145;snookers&#146; (as the junior cadets were called) were allowed to play with extra balls after their seniors had finished at billiards. Cowley was appointed OBE in 1943, CBE in 1946, CB in 1954, and KBE in 1958. He was mentioned in dispatches four times. He died of bronchopneumonia and ischaemic heart disease on 7 January 1993, at Woodpeckers, Sway Road, Brockenhurst, Hampshire. He was survived by his wife and four children.<br>
