<span class="headword">Godwin <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Simmonds]</span>,  Fay Suzette</span>  (1931&#150;2005), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born on 17 February 1931 in Berlin, the elder child of Sidney Simmonds (1899&#150;1978), British consular official, and his first wife, Stella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> MacLean (1896&#150;1948), an American artist. The family moved regularly to different countries. Godwin was educated first by her mother, then in a series of nine schools across the globe, the last of which was Luckley School in Berkshire, where she gained her school certificate. She was an intelligent and competitive child who excelled in most activities, sporting and academic, and had a career mapped out in the international arena using her considerable language skills. However, the loss of her mother (on Fay's seventeenth birthday) put an end to her academic aspirations as she was obliged to assist her father with his official duties. In 1952 she was able to set up base in London, but spent much of the decade working as a travel representative in mainland Europe. It was during this period that she seriously damaged her knee in a skiing accident, which affected, but did not curtail, her lifelong passion for walking.<br>
<br>While working at John Murray publishers, Fay Simmonds met Anthony James Wylie (Tony) Godwin (1920&#150;1976), publisher, who was to become an important and innovative figure in publishing, as chief editor at Penguin Books. They married in 1961 and had two sons, Nicholas and Jeremy. Throughout the 1960s she focused on her role as a mother and played hostess to her husband's career needs. Her interest in photography began as a hobby. She discovered its creative and documentary facilities while producing the family albums and entertaining her children by exploring the developing process to make negative imprints of leaves and flowers. When the marriage terminated, very abruptly, in 1969, it proved to be the catalyst for turning her hobby into a profession, as she resolved to control her own destiny.<br>
<br>In the early 1970s Fay Godwin set up her own business, taking portraits of authors for publicity purposes, and exhibiting them at Swiss Cottage Library (1974). Though largely self-taught, she took some classes with Euan Duff, and it was through this connection that her work appeared in various social documentary articles, especially in the Camden area. Godwin attended, then eventually taught at, photographic workshops, and was a strong champion of the support and community they engendered. At the start of her career she was strongly drawn to photojournalism, but, needing to be home-based, she eventually combined her documentary skills in the landscape images that began to emerge in a serious form during 1974.<br>
<br>Godwin's abiding interest in nature stemmed from her childhood. She joined the Ramblers' Association during the 1950s, later becoming its president (1987&#150;90), and vice-president thereafter. A visit to the Lake District using a Wainwright guide inspired her to produce the first of a series of walkers' guidebooks: <span class="italic">The Oldest Road: an Exploration of the Ridgeway</span> (1975), co-written with J. R. L. Anderson. Her collaboration with established authors was a formula that opened her work to widely different audiences; probably her best-known was <span class="italic">Remains of Elmet</span> (1979), with Ted Hughes.<br>
<br>Godwin received an Arts Council bursary to fund her landscape work in the British Isles in 1978, which formed a significant percentage of the images in <span class="italic">Land</span> (1985), a reflection on the relationship between man and nature. This was the most celebrated body of her work, demonstrating her outstanding artistic and technical abilities. <span class="italic">Land</span> was shown nationally and internationally, and accompanied by her monograph of the same name. However, it was her defence of the environment that brought forth the absolute passion and politics in Godwin. In her fourteenth book, <span class="italic">Our Forbidden Land</span> (1990), she launched a multi-pronged offensive against the various bodies that prevented public access to a large percentage of land across the British Isles. It was dedicated to the Ramblers' Association, and won the first Green Book of the Year award.<br>
<br>Godwin earned many accolades during her professional life. She was the first photographer to have an entire programme of <span class="italic">The South Bank Show</span> feature her work, in 1986, an event that reflected not only her personal standing within the profession, but also changing attitudes of the establishment towards fine art photography. In 1987 she was the second photographer to take part in the fellowship scheme at the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television in Bradford, choosing the opportunity to experiment more formally with colour. Other awards followed, including honorary fellowships of the Royal Photographic Society and the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland, in 1990 and 1992 respectively, and an honorary doctorate from De Montfort University in 2002.<br>
<br>Despite a determined move across the genres of her craft in the 1980s Godwin remained wedded to the welfare of the land. Thus in 1995 she used her award from the Erna and Victor Hasselblad Foundation to revisit Cumbria to investigate the relationship between the landscape and those who farm it. In 2001 the Barbican Centre hosted a major retrospective of her work, once again revealing the wide spectrum of subjects and equipment with which she continued to experiment throughout her professional life. Her state of health was a significant preoccupation throughout much of her life, and she was a devotee of alternative medicine and therapies. She managed to recover from two life-threatening illnesses but died at the Conquest Hospital, St Leonards, Sussex, near to her home at 6 Coastguard Cottages, Toot Rock, Pett Level, Hastings, on 27 May 2005, of heart failure, and was buried at Hastings borough cemetery, The Ridge, Hastings. She was survived by her two sons.<br>
