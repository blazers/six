<span class="headword">Spooner,  Charles Easton</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1818, <em>d.</em> 1889), <span class="occ">railway engineer</span>, was born at Maentwrog, Merioneth, and baptized on 25 May 1818 at Maentwrog church, the fourth of ten children of James Spooner (1790&#150;1856), surveyor and civil engineer, and his first wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Easton (1787&#150;1850). His father was English, his mother English or perhaps Scottish. At the age of twelve or thirteen, he helped his father to survey the Ffestiniog Railway (FR); James Spooner then supervised construction, and in 1836 the line was opened from slate quarries near Blaenau Ffestiniog to Porthmadog harbour. Its gauge was very narrow, less than 2 ft, which enabled the track to follow a serpentine route along steep mountainsides; this in turn facilitated a continuous gradient down which laden trains ran by gravity. Horses hauled the empty wagons uphill.<br>
<br>From about 1834 until 1840 Charles Spooner trained as a civil engineer and surveyor, successively under his father, under Joseph Locke, and under I. K. Brunel. In 1856 he succeeded his father as manager and engineer of FR. On 14 September 1848 he married Mary (1823&#150;1860), daughter of George Barker; sadly, she died just twelve years later, leaving him with four young children.<br>
<br>If, as seemed probable, a standard-gauge steam railway was to be built to Blaenau Ffestiniog, FR would have been unable to compete. Its route inhibited conversion to standard gauge, but no public railway of so narrow a gauge was then worked by steam. None the less, in 1860 Spooner was instructed by his board to enquire into the practicability of using locomotives. George England eventually built two small locomotives&#151;the first of several for FR&#151;in 1863. With these, Spooner was able to replace horses, and to introduce steam-hauled passenger trains in 1865.<br>
<br>Traffic increased rapidly and was catered for by the introduction in 1869 of the double engine <i>Little Wonder</i>, the first wholly successful locomotive built to the patents of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9101/', "Robert Fairlie")</script>. The spectacle of <i>Little Wonder</i> as it hauled a train 400 yards long, up grade through curves as sharp as the sweep of Oxford Circus (as a contemporary put it), was rendered the more dramatic owing to the <span class="roman">Railway Regulation (Gauge) Act</span> (1846). This act had made 4 ft 8&frac12; in. the standard gauge and had had the effect of prohibiting the construction of new passenger railways to narrow gauges.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, railways in Britain had cost too much, it seemed, and cheaper railways were needed, particularly for overseas territories then being opened up. Engineers, often trained in Britain, were already starting to build railways overseas to narrow gauges such as 3 ft 6 in., which was still far wider than that of FR. The Ffestiniog Railway, cheap and very profitable, demonstrated what could be done, and its example led to the construction of narrow-gauge railways all over the world. As Spooner's obituary in <span class="italic">Engineering</span> eventually put it, &#145;hundreds of engineers have been received with kindness by Mr Spooner and courteously conducted over the Ffestiniog Railway &hellip; his experience was freely put at the service of all&#146;. Much of that experience was incorporated into Spooner's book, <span class="italic">Narrow Gauge Railways</span>, published in 1872.<br>
<br>In Britain, where the railway system was already extensive, comparatively few narrow-gauge railways were built. Although Spooner was closely concerned with promotion of the North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways Company in 1872, this company completed only one line of an intended network. His greater contribution to home railways was probably his introduction, on the Ffestiniog Railway in 1872&#150;3, of the first bogie passenger coaches to go into regular service in Britain. The use of bogie coaches was already standard practice in North America, and before long it became so in Britain also. The original two coaches still ran on the Ffestiniog Railway more than a century later, as did Fairlie's double engines.<br>
<br>Spooner was also consulting engineer to many slate quarry companies. He remained manager of FR until shortly before his death, on 18 November 1889, at Bron-y-garth, his Porthmadog residence. He was buried on 23 November at Beddgelert, Caernarvonshire.<br>
