<span class="headword">Lynn,  William Henry</span>  (1829&#150;1915), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 27 December 1829 at St John's Point, co. Down, the elder son of Lieutenant Henry Johnston Lynn of the Irish coastguard service and his wife, Margaretta, daughter of Samuel Ferris MD of Larne, co. Antrim. He was the brother of the sculptor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17269/', "Samuel Ferris Lynn")</script>. He was educated at Dr Newland's private grammar school at Bannow, co. Wexford, before being articled at the age of seventeen to the architect and engineer Charles Lanyon (1813&#150;1889) in Belfast, and serving as clerk of works on the Queen's College (now the Queen's University), Belfast (1846&#150;9), and the county court house, Belfast (1848&#150;50). He was taken into partnership by Lanyon in 1854 and remained with him until 1872, when the firm of Lanyon, Lynn, and Lanyon (as it had become with the addition of Lanyon's son John in 1860) was dissolved. Thereafter, Lynn practised on his own until his death.<br>
<br>Lynn was a prolific designer who worked in a wide range of historic styles and normally displayed an eclectic taste. His work was at first mainly medieval revivalist but later was also classical in inspiration. Early works include the Belfast (now Northern) banks at Newtownards, co. Down (1854), and Dungannon, co. Tyrone (1855), which are among the earliest examples of Venetian Gothic detailing in Ireland. He designed a number of linen warehouses in Belfast, his most conspicuous being that built for Richardson, Sons, and Owden (1865&#150;9), and he also designed many churches throughout Ireland for various protestant denominations. Among his most notable churches are the former St Andrew's Church of Ireland Church of 1860 in Dublin and Carlisle Memorial Methodist Church of 1874&#150;5 in Belfast.<br>
<br>Lynn was very successful in competitions both at home and abroad, although some of his prize-winning designs were not built. The most important competition successes in his time with Lanyon were the unexecuted design for the New South Wales parliament building in Sydney, Australia (1861), a multi-towered Gothic composition, followed by his Italian Gothic design for Chester town hall (1863), which was built and opened in 1869. Competition successes in his later independent practice included Paisley town hall (1875&#150;82), designed in a classical manner, and Barrow in Furness town hall (1877&#150;87), designed in a Gothic style. He was also considered to have supplied the best design in the competition for Birmingham council house (1871), but was disqualified for a minor infringement of the rules.<br>
<br>Lynn was recognized in his time for his planning abilities, and Alfred Waterhouse, the assessor for both the Birmingham and Barrow in Furness competitions and himself a great planner, once told Aston Webb that &#145;there was nothing he would better like to do than to sit behind Lynn and look over his shoulder while he pinned an antiquarian sheet to his board and laid out a large plan&#146;  (Webb, 91).<br>
<br>Most of Lynn's important later work is in Belfast, where he designed the public library (1883&#150;8), the harbour office extension (1891&#150;5), and Campbell College (1891&#150;4). From 1910 to 1915 he was architect of St Anne's Church of Ireland Cathedral in Belfast, begun by his former pupil Thomas Drew (1838&#150;1910), where he provided the design for the baptistery in 1915 (erected in 1922&#150;4). Beyond the British Isles Lynn was responsible for civic improvements at Quebec, and the chapel at the British embassy in Constantinople, both commissioned by the marquess of Dufferin and Ava.<br>
<br>Lynn's honours included the gold medal for architectural drawing at the Paris Universal Exhibition in 1867, presidency of the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland in 1885&#150;9, and nomination for the royal gold medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1911. Unlike his long-time partner Charles Lanyon he had no interest in public life but was entirely devoted to his career, and in the opinion of Aston Webb he was &#145;the greatest Irish architect of his century&#146;  (Webb, 91).<br>
<br>Lynn died of pneumonia on 12 September 1915 at his home, Ardavon, 250 Antrim Road, Belfast, and was buried in the city cemetery. He was unmarried.<br>
