<span class="headword">Kenneth I</span> <span class="st"> [Cin&aacute;ed mac Alpin, Kenneth Macalpine]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 858), <span class="occ">king in Scotland</span>, was ruler of the Dalriada in western Scotland from 840, and also ruler of the Picts from 842. In the genealogy of Scottish kings his father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55318/', "Alpin")</script>, occurs as a son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8930/', "Eochaid")</script>, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55315/', "Aed Find")</script>, a celebrated king of Dalriada [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49278/', "D&#225;l Riata, kings of")</script>]. The Irish synchronisms (based on king-lists), in the undoubtedly correct Edinburgh text, include Alpin among &#145;kings in Scotland&#146;; some modern scepticism concerning his kingship, and also concerning &Aacute;ed Find's own royal descent, is a result of scribal omissions from some texts.<br>
<br>Kenneth himself is first heard of in the seventeenth-century annals of the four masters. Under 835 they say that a lord of Airgialla (perhaps in the Western Isles, not the Airgialla&#151;Oriel&#151;of Ireland) &#145;went over to Alba [Scotland] to reinforce Dalriada at the bidding of Kenneth, Alpin's son&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 1.267). This would be more explicable if it were several years after 835. But although some of the four masters' material is in fact predated by as much as five years, there seems to be no textual reason why this entry should not belong, as does the rest of the year-section, to 836. In that year Eogan&aacute;n, a grandson of &Aacute;ed Find's brother Fergus, became king of Dalriada. Eogan&aacute;n's uncle and father had recently been kings of Dalriada and, for a total of more than twenty years, of Picts as well. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55350/', "Eogan&#225;n (or Uven)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49277/', "Picts, kings of the")</script>] likewise appears in regnal lists for both kingdoms.<br>
<br>In 839 Eogan&aacute;n died in a disastrous battle against &#145;heathen&#146; (probably Danes). In the Pictish kingship he was followed by one Urad who reigned for three years. The Dalriadan kingship seems to have been held by Kenneth's father, Alpin, for only one year, 839&#150;40. It is likely enough that he died at the hands of Picts, as the late chronicle of Huntingdon says, but that is a very poor authority. The year 834 which it gives for the death of Alpin was inferred from a faulty king-list, and has no authority at all.<br>
<br>The most substantial source for Kenneth is the Scottish chronicle, a reign-by-reign narrative from Kenneth to the late tenth century. He held Dalriada, it says, for two years (840&#150;42) before he &#145;came to Pictavia&#146;. Having &#145;destroyed&#146; the Picts, he reigned over Pictavia for sixteen years, from 842 to 858.<br>
<br>King-lists show that in the year when Kenneth &#145;came to Pictavia&#146; the Pictish Urad ceased to reign, and that Urad's son Bred, who succeeded him, probably died in the same year. Three further Pictish kings are named by one group of lists, with reigns totalling six years (842&#150;8). The last of them, Drust, was &#145;killed at Forteviot, or some say at Scone&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Kings and Kingship</span>, 266). This must refer to the story known in Ireland and Scotland in the twelfth century as &#145;the treachery of Scone&#146;, in which Pictish nobles invited by Scots to a council or feast were treacherously killed. Whatever truth there may have been in the tale, the germ of which is as old as Herodotus, it must be supposed that the death of Drust ended six years of active opposition to Kenneth. To follow tradition by describing Kenneth son of Alpin as the first king to rule over both Picts and Scots would be to simplify greatly a development which extended over more than half a century. His main political achievement should rather be seen as the establishment of a new dynasty which aspired to supremacy over the whole of Scotia, and under which the Scots so dominated Pictland that its native language and institutions rapidly disappeared.<br>
<br>The Scottish chronicle says that in the seventh year of his reign (848 or 849) Kenneth &#145;brought relics of Saint Columba to a church that he built&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 1.288). In 849 relics were taken to Ireland also. Norse raids had by this time made Iona untenable. Kenneth's church was probably at Dunkeld, though later Pictish lists attributed the building of Dunkeld church to the King Constantine (or Causantin) who died in 820. The chronicle lists other events of Kenneth's reign without dates. Six times he invaded Saxonia (Northumbria), and he seized and burnt Dunbar and Melrose. But British (from Strathclyde) burnt Dunblane, while &#145;Danes&#146; laid Pictavia waste &#145;as far as Clunie and Dunkeld&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>A notice of Kenneth's death in 858 is the only mention of him in the older Irish annals. The Scottish chronicle says that he died of a &#145;tumour&#146;, in February, at Forteviot; perhaps on Tuesday the 8th, but the reading is in doubt. He and most of his successors down to the eleventh century are said by lists to have been buried in Iona. He left two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6114/', "Constantine I")</script> and &Aacute;ed, who were kings in succession from 862, and at least two daughters: one who married Run, king of the Britons of Strathclyde, and one who married Mael Muire, who died in 913.<br>
<br>Kenneth was succeeded by his brother <a name="cosubject_7795"></a><span class="headword">Donald I</span> <span class="st"> [Domnall mac Alpin]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 862), <span class="occ">king in Scotland</span>, in whose time (the date is not specified) the Gaels with their king &#145;made the rights and laws of the kingdom [which were known as the laws] of &Aacute;ed, son of Eochaid, at Forteviot&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 1.291). What they then promulgated (rather than created, it may be supposed) was presumably a body of more or less Irish customary law associated with the name of Donald's great-grandfather &Aacute;ed Find. &#145;Laws of Macalpine&#146; which were known, or known about, in the thirteenth century may not have been distinct from these laws of &Aacute;ed. Some writers have been misled by a late group of king-lists into believing that Donald was the father of a famous king, Giric. But in the original source Giric's father was undoubtedly &#145;D&uacute;ngal&#146;, not &#145;Donald&#146;.<br>
<br>Donald mac Alpin died on 13 April 862, <i>in</i> <i>palacio Cinnbelathoir</i>, the Scottish chronicle says, but the place has not been identified. Later king-lists say that he died in &#145;Rathinveramon&#146;, &#145;the fort at the mouth of the [Perthshire] River Almond&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 1.291), as Skene proposed. The two places are possibly the same and only a few miles from Forteviot, which archaeological remains show could well have been a royal residence at that time. It stands above the right bank of the Water of May, a small river that joins the Earn less than a mile to the north. The chronicle does not mention Forteviot again after Donald's reign.<br>
<br>Forteviot was almost certainly within Fortriu, roughly equatable with the southern half of modern Perthshire. The Irish annalists give the title &#145;king of Fortriu&#146; to only four Pictish kings: two who died in 693 and 763 respectively, and Kenneth's predecessors Constantine and Oengus in the ninth century. Kenneth I is not called &#145;king of Fortriu&#146;. He, his brother Donald, and Kenneth's two sons are all called &#145;king of Picts&#146;. This title had very seldom been used by the annalists when writing of their own times. It may imply a claim to sovereignty over all Pictish provinces; but there is very little evidence to show how far Kenneth's or Donald's sovereignty actually extended.<br>
