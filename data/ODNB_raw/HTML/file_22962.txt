</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Quin,  James</span>  (1693&#150;1766), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born in King Street, Covent Garden, London, on 24 February 1693, in circumstances that have embarrassed some biographers and confused others. His paternal grandfather was lord mayor of Dublin in 1667; evidently worried about money, he committed suicide in 1674. His son, James Quin, studied at Trinity College, Dublin, and then at London's Lincoln's Inn. It was in England that he met and married Elizabeth Grindzell about 1690. This James Quin, an unusually unworldly lawyer, seems to have accepted Mrs Grindzell's word that her first husband, formerly a soldier but now working as a shoemaker in Shrewsbury, was dead. It was not until about 1701 that the news of the bigamy broke, and even then the Quins agreed to maintain their marriage. The young James Quin was their only child, and had hopes of inheriting a considerable estate when his father died in May 1710, but the will was successfully contested by his Irish uncle John Quin and a first cousin called William Whitehead. Quin did not abandon the fight, nor did he lose touch with his Irish roots. His parents had sent him to school in Dublin from about 1700, and he may have attended Trinity College, Dublin, with a view to a legal career, but he enjoyed the company of actors and quite early aspired to the stage. His first appearances probably occurred in Dublin in 1713 or 1714, and by early 1715 he was a member of the company at Drury Lane in London. He made his English d&eacute;but as Vulture in Charles Johnson's derivative <span class="italic">The Country Lasses</span> on 4 February 1715, and followed it with a number of supporting roles in the season's repertory.<br>
<br>Quin's rise was not a meteoric one. Even as a young man he was stately rather than handsome. His weight would increase with his years, his face grow fat, and his chin double. It was intelligence of phrasing and vocal musicality that distinguished him, placing him in direct descent from Thomas Betterton. It was to these qualities that the Drury Lane audience responded on 7 November 1716, when John Mills was taken ill and Quin stepped in to read the part of Bajazet in Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">Tamerlane</span>. Despite the warmth of the reception, he had to be satisfied with supporting roles in the well-established Drury Lane company. It was probably financial necessity that led him to perform at Southwark fair in September 1717, and at the end of that year he transferred from Drury Lane to John Rich's company at the Lincoln's Inn Fields playhouse. He would remain with Rich for the next sixteen years, during which he climbed to the head of his profession.<br>
<br>Witty and socially at ease, Quin did not lack self-belief. To the unknown writer who rushed a racy biography through the presses immediately after Quin's death in 1766, his subject was:<blockquote>one of the best actors and most facetious men of his time; who was at once the gentleman and the scholar&#151;the philosopher and the critic&#151;the humourist and the moral man, the scourge of knaves and fools, and the admiration of the sensible and good. (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 7)</blockquote>The portrait was recognizable by those who had known Quin in his maturity, but probably not by those who knew him only in his youth. There was much gossip, then, about drinking bouts, philandering, and intrigue. Things came to a head towards the end of Quin's first season at Lincoln's Inn Fields. On the afternoon of 17 April 1718, during a chance meeting at a Cornhill tavern, he had a fierce quarrel with William Bowen, a notoriously hot-headed member of the Drury Lane company twice Quin's age. It culminated in a scrappy duel in which Bowen was fatally wounded. At his trial Quin was found guilty of manslaughter, but seems not to have been branded on the hand, exonerated perhaps by Bowen's reputation. The theatrical public welcomed him back, but the fiery temper remained. Although Quin had many friendships, including a lifelong one with the actor Lacy Ryan, it was his enmities that made news. Actors were so much in the public eye by the middle of the century that they were hard-pressed to conceal their private quarrels. Given their common sensitivity to provocation, it is hardly surprising that Quin, at various stages of his long career, had noisy spats with Charles Macklin and Theophilus Cibber. His dislike of Peg Woffington and Kitty Clive led him to make cutting observations about both in the semi-public forum of the green room, but this was out of character with his normal chivalry towards women. He never married, perhaps burdened by a fear of his sexual unattractiveness. Lady Mary Coke reported an occasion when the duchess of Queensberry, observing that he rarely played lovers, asked him, &#145;Pray, Mr Quin, do you ever make love?&#146;, to which the actor replied, &#145;No, Madam, I always buy it ready made&#146;  (Nash, 196). His habitual overeating may, of course, have been Quin's compensating response to loneliness. His protective concern for actresses he admired, Susannah Cibber and George Anne Bellamy, for example, was sentimental rather than sexual. They, like the poet James Thomson, benefited from his generosity at crucial periods in their lives.<br>
<br>During his years at Lincoln's Inn Fields, Quin played leading roles in both tragedy and comedy: Othello, Macbeth, King Lear (in the Nahum Tate version), Brutus in <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span>, the title role in Jonson's <span class="italic">Volpone</span>, Pinchwife in Wycherley's <span class="italic">The Country Wife</span>, once (for his own benefit performance in 1730) Macheath in Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>: the stately Quin letting his hair down in a singing role. He was, though, generally careful in his choice of parts, knowing himself unsuited to romance and heroism. His comic preference was for the sourer, scowling edges, and he was probably at his finest as the debauched Sir John Brute in Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Provoked Wife</span>. But it was memories of his Falstaff that endured longest, monumentalized in china statuettes put out by Bow, Derby, and Staffordshire and widely sold. This was a part in which he had no rivals. Indeed, between the death of Robert Wilks in 1732 and Garrick's London d&eacute;but in 1741, Quin was England's leading actor, able to command high salaries wherever he went. Dublin's theatres vied for his favours during the summer closure of London's patent houses, and he seems to have used his visits to the Irish capital to pursue his claims on his patrimony. Given the prosperity in which he lived his last years, it is possible that he reached a settlement with his Irish relations.<br>
<br>It was a sign of Quin's status that Drury Lane petitioned for his return at the beginning of the season in 1734. Charles Fleetwood, the new patentee, needed help with the management of his troublesome company, and Quin was one of the very few people with sufficient authority to take on the job. He remained at Drury Lane until the early summer of 1741. Despite his brushes with Macklin and Cibber, he merited and earned the respect of his fellows. Whether or not he recognized it, he was the guardian of an old theatrical tradition. But times were about to change. The first major sign came with the Drury Lane revival of <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> on 14 February 1741. Quin played Antonio, just as he had played such parts before, but the Shylock of his old adversary Macklin was revolutionary, no longer a comic villain but a feeling, suffering human being. Beside Quin's measured cadences, Macklin's speaking style was startlingly natural. Audiences, a little bemused, were stirred. Not so Quin. At the end of the season he undertook the longest of his Irish tours, playing mostly at the Aungier Street theatre from June 1741 to February 1742. He was not in London in October 1741, when Garrick's d&eacute;but at Goodman's Fields carried the Macklin revolution a significant step further. For the rest of his life Quin would always, and generally unfavourably, be compared with Garrick.<br>
<br>Despite the clamour of the theatrical public, it was some years before the two men acted together. Garrick was still at Goodman's Fields when Quin marked his return to Rich's company at Covent Garden on 25 March 1742 by playing one of his favourite Roman characters, Joseph Addison's Cato. His arrangement with Rich allowed him, now that he had passed fifty, to appear less regularly, and it was in the 1740s that he began to develop his fashionable contacts in Bath. Finally, for the 1746&#150;7 season at Covent Garden, Rich succeeded in bringing Garrick and Quin together. It was a curious misjudgement of Quin's to open his campaign as Richard III, a part which Garrick had made his own, and it was not until 14 November 1746 that the two appeared together, Quin as Horatio and Garrick as Lothario in Rowe's <span class="italic">The Fair Penitent</span>. For the fourteen-year-old future playwright Richard Cumberland, the contrast was thrilling: Lothario, &#145;young and light and alive in every muscle and in every feature&#146;, bounding onto the stage to confront a &#145;heavy-paced Horatio&#146;. &#145;It seemed as if a whole century had been stept over in the transition of a single scene&#146;  (Cumberland, 59&#150;60). Quin measured up better when playing Falstaff to Garrick's Hotspur in <span class="italic">I Henry IV</span> on 6 December 1746, but was again at risk on 2 January 1747 when playing Gloster to Garrick's Hastings in Rowe's <span class="italic">Jane Shore</span>. Quin had his loyal defenders, but he knew he was outgunned. It is to his credit, as well as Garrick's, that, although they never again acted together, the two men remained friends. Garrick seems even to have envisaged a managerial partnership with Quin when first contemplating a bid for the Drury Lane patent. Susannah Cibber applauded the idea, writing of Quin, &#145;He is an honest, worthy man, and besides being a great actor he is a very useful one and will make the under actors mind their business&#146;  (Nash, 217&#150;18).<br>
<br>There is no evidence that Quin was interested in so heavy a commitment. He was in Bath when the Covent Garden season opened in September 1747, and there was a widely rumoured correspondence between him and his manager, John Rich. &#145;I am at Bath&#146;, wrote Quin. &#145;Stay there, and be damned&#146;, replied Rich. But if there was a quarrel, it was a short-lived one. Quin remained a regular member of the Covent Garden company from 1748 until his formal retirement on 15 May 1751, when he appeared in the inauspicious role of Horatio in <span class="italic">The Fair Penitent</span>. If, as has been claimed, Rich paid Quin &pound;1000 for his final season, it was the highest salary any actor had yet received. Later appearances at Covent Garden were confined to the benefit performances of his old friend Lacy Ryan in 1752 and 1753. But for the loss of front teeth, he would have been there again in 1754. His note to Ryan has appeared in various versions, but it was along the lines of &#145;There is no person on earth, whom I would sooner serve than Ryan, but by G&#151;, I will whistle Falstaff for no man&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>).<br>
<br>In retirement, Quin was a familiar figure, carrying his vast bulk (he weighed as much as 20 stone) into the assembly rooms. There were even rumours that he aspired to succeed Beau Nash as master of ceremonies, though that seems unlikely. He was content to hobnob with the nobility and to gourmandize. Most summers he would travel north as a house guest of the aristocracy. In June 1762, for example, he amused Garrick and other guests of the duke of Devonshire at Chatsworth House by driving himself about the Peak district in a one-horse chaise, carrying always an umbrella, rain or shine  (Oman, 226). It was during a visit to the Garricks' villa in Hampton in January 1766 that one of Quin's hands became seriously inflamed. He returned to Bath in great anxiety, and died there on the 21st. He was buried in Bath Abbey on 25 January, and Garrick composed an epitaph for his monument there.<br>
<br>Quin's will, drawn up in July 1765, is, in some ways, a surprising document. There were no theatrical beneficiaries, and the only familiar name is that of Thomas Gainsborough, &#145;limner, now living at Bath&#146;. Bequests to relatives are outnumbered by those to tradesmen&#151;a London oilman, a publican, a wine merchant (these were his executors). Always a valetudinarian, Quin left &pound;200 to his London doctor and his gold-headed crutch cane to a Bath surgeon, perhaps the one who treated ineffectively his infected hand in January 1766. Particularly touching is the gift of &pound;100 to Mrs Mary Sampson, landlady, with whom Quin may have boarded at Centre House in Bath's Pierpont Street, &#145;to be paid by my executors into her own hands, independent of all her creditors whatsoever&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 63&#150;4). It is noteworthy, since Quin's detractors accused him of obsequiousness, that there are no bequests to the nobility.<br>
<br>Quin was the first actor to be well treated by painters, though surviving portraits all date from his maturity. Most fascinating is a pencil sketch by Hogarth, now in the Royal Collection, comparing the physical proportions of Quin and Garrick. Quin and Hogarth were fellow members of the freemasons' lodge at the Bear and Harrow in London's Butcher Row, and the artist painted the actor at least three times. Gainsborough's portrait of Quin in old age expresses more of the gourmand than the player, but the greatest damage to Quin's standing was committed by the unknown artist who sketched him in ink and wash as Coriolanus. The often reproduced engraving of this sketch shows a mountainous Quin, sporting a ludicrously plumed helmet and a suit of armour rimmed by a flared miniskirt beneath which his knee-breeches are just visible. There were, to be sure, people who accused Quin of walking in blank verse, but he was never as risible as this drawing makes him.<br>
