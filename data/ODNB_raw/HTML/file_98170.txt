<span class="headword">Herbert,  Godfrey</span>  (1884&#150;1961), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at 4 Warwick Road, Coventry, Warwickshire, on 28 February 1884, the younger son of John Herbert, solicitor, of Kenilworth, Warwickshire, and his wife, Lucy Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Draper. He confided to a biographer that as a boy of eleven he was taken to the Isle of Wight in 1895 and the sight of the fleet anchored in Spithead decided him to seek a naval career. After preparation at Foster's School, Stubbington House, Hampshire, and the celebrated naval &#145;crammer&#146; Littlejohn's School, Greenwich, he was admitted as a naval cadet to HMS <i>Britannia</i> and gazetted a midshipman in June 1900.<br>
<br>Promoted sub-lieutenant in July 1903, Herbert volunteered for the submarine service in January 1905 and spent three months training at the depot ship for submarines HMS <i>Thames</i> before being appointed second-in-command of the submarine A4. The submarine's commander was Lieutenant Eric Nasmith, later an admiral and winner of the Victoria Cross. On 16 October Herbert had the first of his narrow escapes when the submarine flooded and settled to the bottom after a ventilator shaft had been inadvertently left open.<br>
<br>Herbert was promoted lieutenant at the end of December 1905. In February 1911 his submarine C36 was one of three that began an unprecedentedly long passage to Hong Kong, in which he distinguished himself during a storm in the Red Sea by, at considerable risk to himself, reattaching a snapped hawser to the cruiser towing the submarine.<br>
<br>When the war began in August 1914 Herbert was in command of the submarine D5 under the commodore of submarines, Roger Keyes, at Harwich. On 21 August he encountered the German cruiser <i>Rostock</i> in the Heligoland Bight and, in what seemed like a perfect opportunity, fired two torpedoes. They both missed. It was only later that the British discovered that the torpedo warheads were some forty pounds heavier than those used in practice and without compensation would run deeper. He had another narrow escape when on 3 November D5, after putting to sea to repel a raid by German warships on Gorleston, struck a floating British mine that had come adrift. Only a handful of the crew survived.<br>
<br>In January 1915 Herbert switched to the form of naval warfare that was to give him his greatest fame. He was appointed to command the Q-ship <i>Antwerp</i>. The Q-ships were designed to look like innocent and vulnerable merchantmen, with the aim of luring an enemy submarine close enough on the surface so that at the right moment they could deploy their hidden weapons. The <i>Antwerp</i> had no luck and in April 1915 Herbert was given command of the <i>Baralong</i>, a ship that resembled a typical tramp steamer. On 19 August, approximately 80 miles west of the Scillies in the western approaches, Herbert answered a wireless SOS from the steamer <i>Nicosian</i> reporting that she was being chased by two submarines. The <i>Nicosian</i> was forced to halt by the German submarine U-27 and the crew was either in the process of abandoning ship or had already taken to the lifeboats when the <i>Baralong</i> arrived on the scene. Herbert, flying the still neutral American flag and with an American flag hung on boards over the side of the ship, approached as close as possible and then opened fire, raising the British naval ensign at the same time. U-27 was sunk. Approaching under false colours was a traditional <i>ruse de guerre</i> and Herbert insisted he was not flying the American flag when he actually opened fire.<br>
<br>However much the Germans might have protested at being caught by the ruse it was really what followed the submarine's destruction that caused the controversy. About a dozen survivors from the submarine were observed swimming towards the <i>Nicosian</i> and attempting to board. Herbert, informed by the rescued master of the <i>Nicosian</i> that the ship carried a cargo of mules purchased for the British government, feared the Germans might attempt to set fire to the fodder and ordered them to be &#145;shot away&#146;. Some were apparently killed in the water&#151;there were no reported survivors from U-27&#151;but about six Germans managed to board the <i>Nicosian</i>. Herbert, remembering the initial report of two enemy submarines, assumed the Germans were going to scuttle the ship and sent a party of marines to board. He had also learned from <i>Nicosian</i>'s master that there were rifles and ammunition in the chart house and instructed the marine corporal in charge of the boarding party that they were facing desperate men, to take no chances and to shoot first. The Germans aboard the <i>Nicosian</i> were hunted and shot, the bodies promptly buried at sea. The deaths were attributed to &#145;the heat of battle&#146; and it must be remembered that feeling ran high at the time against German submariners because of the sinking of the liner <i>Lusitania</i> the previous May and the news just received that the liner <i>Arabic</i> had been torpedoed.<br>
<br>Exactly what happened in the confined and darkened passages of the <i>Nicosian</i> may never be known. The incident was kept quiet in England but <i>Nicosian</i> had carried a party of American muleteers who on their return to the United States spoke to the press and the story came out, probably with a good deal of exaggeration. The Germans, who had been the target of numerous war crimes charges, now had one to lay against the British. They labelled the captain of the <i>Baralong</i> a war criminal who had killed German sailors in cold blood and misused a neutral flag, and demanded that he be tried for murder and punished accordingly. A published diplomatic correspondence ensued at the end of 1915 and early in 1916. The &#145;<i>Baralong</i> incident&#146; became one of the most celebrated of the war and a German justification for the adoption of unrestricted submarine warfare. Herbert was appointed DSO for the action but the Admiralty seemed a bit embarrassed and only identified the <i>Baralong</i>'s commander as a Captain William McBride, possibly to protect Herbert should he ever fall into German hands.<br>
<br>On 3 May 1916 Herbert married Ethel Ellen, daughter of William Daymond Hammick, the widow of Francis Arthur Nelson, a Royal Marines officer. They had two daughters. He briefly commanded the submarine E22, followed by the Q-ship <i>Corrigan Head</i>. In October 1916 he asked to return to submarines and was appointed to command the K13, then under construction. The K-boats were an ultimately unsuccessful class of large, complex, steam-powered submarines, which nearly cost Herbert his life. On 29 January 1917 K13, on trials with eighty men aboard, foundered. The survivors were trapped in the sunken submarine, apparently doomed if not rescued before their air supply ran out. Herbert and another officer, who died in the attempt, made a perilous underwater ascent through the conning tower to seek rescue. Eventually K13's hull was raised sufficiently for forty-six survivors to escape.<br>
<br>Herbert was next given command of a flotilla of four trawlers equipped with hydrophones working in the western approaches. On 13 June 1917 his flotilla detected and sank UC-66. He was promoted to commander but it was not until the submarine's destruction and identity was confirmed in 1919 that he received a bar to his DSO. He spent the remainder of the war on the staff of Admiral Sir Lewis Bayly at Queenstown, a base primary employed in anti-submarine warfare.<br>
<br>Following the armistice Herbert spent a few months in the cruiser <i>Caledon</i> engaged in operations against the Bolsheviks in the Baltic before retiring from the Royal Navy in November 1919 after twenty-one years of service. He subsequently became sales manager for the Daimler car division of the Birmingham Small Arms Company. Recalled to service in 1939, he commanded the armed merchant cruiser <i>Cilicia</i>, a converted liner primarily employed on the west coast of Africa. In 1943 Herbert left active service and worked in Beira as managing director of Allen, Wack, and Shepherd Ltd. He moved in 1948 to Umtali, Rhodesia, where he was chairman of Hodgson and Myburgh Ltd, 1955&#150;9, and chairman of Rhodesian Insurances (Pvt Ltd) and Sunrho Ltd. He died in Umtali on 8 August 1961.<br>
<br>Submarines nearly cost Herbert his life on at least three occasions and on a fourth they earned him the dubious nickname of <i>Baralong</i> Herbert. The <i>Baralong</i> incident is another example of how submarines did not fit into the traditional practices of naval warfare. Q-ships themselves were to be of diminishing utility as the Germans became more wary. This, however, had a certain advantage for by attacking while submerged the German submarines were forced to expend their limited supply of torpedoes, thereby curtailing their operations. The most successful submarine commanders achieved the majority of their results while surfaced by gunfire or explosive charges. In the long run, by provoking the Germans to resort to &#145;unrestricted submarine warfare&#146;, the British helped bring them into direct conflict with the United States, with decisive results for the outcome of the war. Herbert, however controversial his actions in August 1915, played at least a small part in this.<br>
