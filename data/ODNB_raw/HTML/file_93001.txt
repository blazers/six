<span class="headword">Rubinstein,  Patricia Giulia Caulfield Kate</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Antonia Forest]</span>  (1915&#150;2003), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 26 May 1915 at 142 Fellows Road, Hampstead, London, the only child of Ernest Bernard Rubinstein, trimming and millinery warehouseman, and later textile wholesaler, and his wife, Anna Madeleine Caulfield (Madge), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Campbell, dressmaker. She and her mother lived with an aunt in Bournemouth during the First World War; in 1918 they rejoined her father in Hampstead, where she spent a happy childhood within a large extended family. She grew up in the Reform Judaism of her father's family who had emigrated from Russia (her mother was of Ulster protestant descent), but became a Roman Catholic in 1946; her love of Catholic tradition flavoured her writing at a time when religious belief was an unfashionable ingredient in children's fiction.<br>
<br>Rubinstein attended South Hampstead high school (1921&#150;33) and University College, London (1934&#150;6), where she took a diploma in journalism, though writing novels was always her ambition. Her first job was in the <span class="italic">Times</span> library. Just before the Second World War the family moved permanently to Bournemouth to the house owned by Rubinstein's aunt; this was to be her home for the rest of her life. During the war she served as a civilian clerk in the army pay office.<br>
<br>After the war Rubinstein's determination to be a writer resurfaced; two adult novels were rejected by a publisher, so she tried her hand at a children's book. The result was <span class="italic">Autumn Term</span> (1948), the first of her ten-volume series about the Marlow family, all written under the pseudonym Antonia Forest. Superficially, <span class="italic">Autumn Term</span> was a traditional boarding-school story. Forest's genius was in transcending what was by then a tired genre; she concentrated on character, using the commonplace events of school life as vehicles to explore relationships and moral dilemmas. Nicola and Lawrie, twin sisters and the youngest of a family of eight, start school with expectations of following the successes of their older sisters; but in this realistic portrait of a school community there are no tidy endings, and self-knowledge and maturity develop through episodes of failure or disappointment, and through precarious, shifting friendships. Forest subverted another traditional theme in <span class="italic">The Marlows and the Traitor</span> (1953). Ostensibly this is a holiday adventure story where the children discover that an adult friend is really a spy, but Forest paints cowardice and heroism, loyalty and treachery, in shades of moral grey rather than the black and white certainties more usual in 1950s children's fiction.<br>
<br>Writing as Forest, Rubinstein brought the same confident, subtle approach to later books of the series; her portrayal of the Marlows' complex family and friendship dynamics is utterly convincing and in this she was aided by a keen ear for precisely focused language. Her naturalistic dialogue, carefully differentiated between her characters, is a key to their personalities, from Rowan's elliptical phrasing which conceals her emotions, to Peter's assumption of a mock-rural accent in order to annoy. Forest also expertly offers literary allusion, comparison, and intertextuality as indicators of characters' inner lives. In <span class="italic">The Ready-Made Family</span> (1967) she uses Jane Austen's <span class="italic">Persuasion</span> as a mirror for family change and tension when a Marlow daughter marries. In <span class="italic">Peter's Room</span> (1961) the imaginative world of the Bront&euml; children counterpoints the attractions and dangers of the role-play fantasy games which enliven the Marlows' Christmas holiday. She also wrote two children's historical novels, about Elizabethan Marlow ancestors, and <span class="italic">The Thursday Kidnapping</span> (1963), a contemporary story set in Hampstead, both again published under the pseudonym Antonia Forest.<br>
<br>Forest's intelligent, convincing accounts of the upper-middle-class Marlows were sometimes too easily dismissed as &eacute;litist. Her writing was unfashionably demanding in an age when many children's books were aimed at a less literary readership, and the clash of expectations between the conventional settings of her stories and the startling immediacy of her characterization made categorization difficult. Sales dwindled and her books went out of print by the late 1980s. However, her work always appealed to a discerning minority of bookish children and, later, adult readers, and her books were keenly sought on the second-hand market. Towards the end of her life reassessment of Forest as a neglected author began to redress the balance of critical attention. Victor Watson in <span class="italic">Reading Series Fiction</span> (2000) described her as &#145;at least one of the best writers for children in English&#146;  (p. 174), and suggested that Forest deserves to occupy the same literary space, in terms of children's books, that Jane Austen inhabits in writing for adults. Certainly Forest's talent for sharp, witty social observation in a restricted environment, and her exploration of character in an imperfect world, have a persuasive and timeless appeal. The combination of serious critical reassessment, and the renewed availability of her books through a small independent publisher from 2003 onwards, ensured Forest a belated recognition among a discriminating adult readership.<br>
<br>Rubinstein was a very private person who kept her writing separate from her personal life; she replied generously to readers' letters but always under her pseudonym, and rarely gave interviews. She never married, and lived alone in retirement. Her last book was published in 1982; unassuming about her own work, she was surprised but quietly pleased by the revival of interest during the last few years of her life. She died at her home, 11 Roslin Road, Talbot Woods, Bournemouth, on 29 November 2003, of pneumonia, and was buried at Wimborne Road cemetery, Bournemouth.<br>
