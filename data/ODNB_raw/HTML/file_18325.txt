<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mather,  Robert Cotton</span>  (1808&#150;1877), <span class="occ">missionary and translator</span>, was born at New Windsor, Manchester, on 8 November 1808, the second son of James Mather, Congregational minister of Sheffield and formerly of Clapton. He was educated at Edinburgh and Glasgow universities (MA Glasgow 1831) and at Homerton College. On 1 June 1833 he was ordained at Lendal Chapel, York, and soon afterwards he sailed for India as a missionary with the London Missionary Society. He had recently married, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sewell (<i>d</i>. 1879), a worshipper at Hew Court Chapel, Carey Street, London, accompanied him.<br>
<br>In September 1834, after ten months at Calcutta, Mather moved to Benares and then, in May 1838, to Mirzapur, where he founded a small but viable mission with churches, schools, and an orphan school press. Schools, he discovered, were almost the only way of establishing contacts with Hindus. He became an excellent Hindustani scholar and was well placed to witness and foster the emergence of Khari Boli Hindi as a major written language; a tiny magazine which he issued from his press, <span class="italic">Balko ke liye Phulo ka har</span>, was one of the first publications in Khari Boli Hindi for children. He also revised the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in Urdu, in 1860, and compiled an English&#150;Urdu <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, a Hindi <span class="roman">Bible</span> in roman script, an Urdu commentary on the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, and the beginnings of another on the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>. He saw his new Urdu <span class="roman">Bible</span> through the press while back in England on furlough in 1857&#150;61 and was thus ideally positioned to issue speedily <span class="italic">The Indian Church during the Great Rebellion</span> (1859), compiled by his son-in-law, the Revd M. A. Sherring, who covered for Mather at Mirzapur during his absence. While the rebellion was still raging Mather also published <span class="italic">Christian Missions in India</span> (1858). In common with other evangelicals he viewed the rebellion as proof that God would let no political administration survive, no matter how sound, if it were not underpinned by true religion.<br>
<br>Mather returned to India in February 1861. In 1862 Glasgow University honoured him with the degree of LLD for his new Urdu <span class="roman">Bible</span>. He returned to England permanently in 1873 to work on his <span class="roman">Bible</span> commentaries and died at his home, 5 Torrington Park Villas, North Finchley, Middlesex, on 21 April 1877. After his death his widow, Elizabeth, who had published an Urdu dictionary of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and many improving booklets in Hindustani for Indian women and children, joined the female mission at Mirzapur. She died on 29 March 1879. The Mathers' youngest son, Dr C. B. Mather, became a medical missionary in German East Africa.<br>
