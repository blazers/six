<span class="headword">Law, Sir  Horace Rochfort</span>  (1911&#150;2005), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 23 June 1911 at 46 Merrion Square, Dublin, the younger son of (Samuel) Horace Law (1973&#150;1940), ear, nose, and throat surgeon, and his wife, Sybil Mary (1878&#150;1952), daughter of Sir George Clay, first baronet. Though intent on a naval career (he traced his descent back to Lord Nelson's elder brother, William) he was unable to enter the Royal Naval College on account of ill health and spent four years at Sherborne School before joining the Royal Navy as a special entry cadet at seventeen. Throughout the 1930s he served in surface ships and specialized in gunnery, achieving advanced or &#145;dagger&#146; qualifications.<br>
<br>The outbreak of the Second World War found Law as gunnery officer of the cruiser <i>Cairo</i>, in which he served through the ill-fated Norway campaign of 1940. His experience in fighting off air attacks and dodging bombs delivered both in dives and level flight was a notable baptism of fire, and resulted in a mention in dispatches. His ship was damaged off Narvik and he moved on to HMS <i>Coventry</i>, in which he went through the Greece and Crete campaigns in the Mediterranean in 1940&#150;41. These involved intensive attacks by Italian and German aircraft in which Law distinguished himself, earning the DSC. He returned to the United Kingdom at the end of 1941 and on 13 December that year married Heather Valerie Coryton (<i>d</i>. 1996), the 24-year-old daughter of Henry Haworth Coryton, rector of Merrow, Surrey. The wedding cake had been made by Groppi's in Cairo&#151;a rare sight in wartime Britain. There were two sons and two daughters of the marriage. Law's wartime naval service continued with trials of an American anti-aircraft gunnery system in the cruiser <i>Delhi</i>. His enthusiasm for this did not endear him to the Admiralty authorities. In 1942 he joined the cruiser <i>Nigeria</i>, in which he served for the remainder of the war.<br>
<br>Law was promoted commander in 1946. His first command was the frigate <i>Modeste</i>, the gunnery training ship. Thereafter, after an Admiralty appointment in the gunnery division, he moved on to be fleet gunnery officer in the Far East. During the Korean War he was closely involved in the intricate business of naval gunfire support for the UN forces and particularly the South Korean army. For this work he was appointed OBE in 1950. Promotion to the rank of captain followed, with command of the new and powerful destroyer <i>Duchess</i>. After further staff appointments he assumed command of HMS <i>Centaur</i>, then employed as the training carrier, and then moved on to be captain of the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, in 1960&#150;61. There he oversaw the introduction of a new scheme of entry and training, with the ability to manage change effectively that was increasingly a feature of his career.<br>
<br>On promotion to rear-admiral in 1961, Law became flag officer sea training, in charge of working-up ships from Portland, then flag officer submarines, an unusual appointment for a non-submarine officer. Promoted vice-admiral in 1965, he became controller of the navy, responsible for all aspects of the service's material development. Tenure of this gruelling post coincided with the navy's battle to keep alive the project for a new generation of fixed-wing aircraft carriers, ultimately lost with its cancellation under Denis Healey in 1966. Law, who had some doubts (never voiced in public) about the project, remained in post as controller and oversaw the subsequent evolution of the &#145;through deck cruiser&#146;, eventually to become the Invincible class. His final appointment, from 1970 to 1972, was as commander-in-chief, naval home command, in charge of all shore establishments in the United Kingdom, serving simultaneously as first and principal naval aide-de-camp to the queen. He was appointed CB in 1963, knighted KCB in 1967, and promoted GCB in 1972.<br>
<br>Law's most striking characteristic, among senior officers of his generation, was his devout Christianity. He underwent two deep religious experiences, one as a midshipman and one during the Second World War; and, strikingly, he sought divine guidance during the successful installation, in action conditions, of new gun barrels in a twin 4 inch mounting. He demonstrated his faith in an address given at the empire youth service in Westminster Abbey on 26 April 1942. In later years he was president of the Officers' Christian Union (1976&#150;86) and chairman of the Church Army Brigade (1980&#150;87). This aspect of his life was generally acknowledged and respected throughout the navy&#151;he said, wryly, that he was &#145;known as a God-botherer&#146;  (interview with J. Parsons)&#151;but his unfailing fairness and professional judgement ensured that it did not cloud his views of those with differing opinions.<br>
<br>After his retirement in 1972 Law was chairman of the shipbuilding firm R. and W. Hawthorn Leslie &amp; Co. (1973&#150;81), a member of the security commission (1973&#150;82), and president of the Royal Institute of Naval Architects (1975&#150;7). As a governor of Sherborne School he had to handle a difficult matter of staff succession, which he did with skill. He lived during his retirement at Cowpers, West Harting, near Petersfield, Sussex, and died there of bronchopneumonia on 30 January 2005. He was survived by his four children.<br>
