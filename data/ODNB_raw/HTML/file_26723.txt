<span class="headword">Stuart,  John Sobieski Stolberg</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>John Carter Allen]</span>  (1795?&#150;1872), and <a name="cosubject_26699"></a><span class="headword">Charles Edward Stuart</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Charles Manning Allen]</span>  (1799?&#150;1880), <span class="occ">impostors</span>, were brothers who claimed to be the heirs of Charles Edward Stuart, the Young Chevalier. Mystery surrounds the places and dates of their births, and they sought to surround their ancestry with similar obfuscation. Their father was Thomas Gatehouse Allen (<i>d</i>. 1839), a lieutenant in the Royal Navy, and their mother was Katherine Matilda, daughter of the clergyman and antiquary <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17973/', "Owen Manning")</script>, of Godalming, Surrey. Their pretensions were based on the belief that Thomas Gatehouse Allen was not the son of his supposed father, Admiral John Carter Allen, but was in fact the legitimate son of the Young Chevalier and his wife, born in Italy and fostered by the admiral.<br>
<br>There is no reliable account of the youth and education of the brothers; by their own account, they discovered the &#145;truth&#146; of their birth in 1811, and promptly offered their services to Napoleon, fighting at Dresden and Leipzig in 1813, and again at Waterloo, where they claimed to have been personally decorated by Napoleon. The date of their first appearance in Scotland is unknown, but they were certainly there with their father in 1822 at the time of George IV's visit to Edinburgh. They threw themselves fervently into the acquisition of Scottish culture, and Scotticized their name first to Allan, then to Hay Allan, and then to Hay, encouraging the belief that they were related to the last Hay earl of Erroll. They gained the patronage of the earl of Moray, and spent much time in Darnaway Forest, where they became expert deer-hunters (the source of their 1848 volume, <span class="italic">The Lay of the Deer Forest, with Sketches of Olden and Modern Hunting</span>), and were frequent guests at the homes of many highland chiefs. In 1822 a volume of romantic poetry, <span class="italic">The Bridal of Caolchairn</span>, was published under the name of John Hay Allen. On 9 October 1822, Charles married Anna (1787&#150;1862), daughter of the Hon. John Beresford, MP for co. Waterford, and widow of Charles Gardiner; they had a son and three daughters. John married, on 29 October 1845, Georgiana (<i>d</i>. 1888), eldest daughter of Edward Kendall of Cheltenham. They had no children; and, indeed, there is some doubt as to their ever having resided together.<br>
<br>In 1829, the brothers' careers entered a new phase, with the revelation to the antiquary and novelist Sir Thomas Dick Lauder of their possession of what purported to be a late fifteenth-century manuscript, entitled the <span class="italic">Vestiarium Scoticum, or, The Garde-Robe of Scotland</span>, depicting the clan tartans of Scottish families. They refused to show the &#145;original&#146; of the manuscript (which, had it been genuine, would have lent substance to the claims then current as to the antiquity of the use of clan tartans), and it was dismissed by Sir Walter Scott as fraudulent. The brothers withdrew to Eilean Aigas, a hunting lodge on an island in the Beauly River in Inverness-shire, the grant of which they had obtained from their new patron, Lord Lovat. They declared themselves to be Roman Catholics and adopted the final version of their names, an unambiguous declaration of their belief in their Stuart ancestry and claims. They set up a miniature court on their island: Elizabeth Grant of Rothiemurchus recalled that &#145;for several years they actually <i>reigned</i> in the north country&#146;  (Strachey, 369).<br>
<br>In 1842, the brothers published their manuscript in a limited edition of fifty, and in 1844 produced another volume, <span class="italic">The Costume of the Clans</span>, which has been described as &#145;a monumental work&#146;, in which they set out to demonstrate that the Catholic, Celtic Scotland of the middle ages had been part of a sophisticated and rich culture; as Hugh Trevor-Roper has demonstrated, they saw themselves as living embodiments of the revival not just of highland dress, but of an entire, vanished civilization. <span class="italic">The Costume of the Clans</span> was a work of immense scholarship, drawing on a wide variety of disciplines and arcane sources; it was, none the less, &#145;shot through with pure fantasy and bare-faced forgery&#146;  (Trevor-Roper, 36).<br>
<br>The brothers followed this publication with a volume of romantic short stories, <span class="italic">Tales of the Century, or, Sketches of the Romance of History between the Years 1746 and 1846</span> (1847), in which they made their most explicit claim to royal blood, through historical fictions which the reader was intended to read as thinly disguised historical facts. Far from having the desired effect, the pretensions of the brothers and their earlier work on the clans of Scotland were subjected to a devastating anonymous attack in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> (in fact written by Professor George Skene of Glasgow), which exposed the weaknesses, flaws, and fantasies of the <span class="italic">Vestiarium</span>. Despite the attempts at rebuttal by the brothers, their reputation and scholarship were compromised, and the household at Eilean Aigas finally broke up. The family moved to the continent, where they lived principally at Prague and Pressburg for the next twenty years, and where their pretensions to royal blood continued to be entertained. In 1868, very poor but maintaining their illusions, the Stuarts returned to London, where they were well-known figures in the British Library reading rooms, where a table was reserved for them. Their pens, paper-knives, paperweights, and other paraphernalia were surmounted with miniature gold coronets.<br>
<br>John Sobieski Stuart, who had assumed the title of Count d'Albanie on the death of his father in 1839, died at 52 Stanley Street, Hanover Square, London, on 13 February 1872. His brother then assumed the Albanie title, and continued to defend the family claims, dying on board the steamer <i>Rainbow</i> at Pauillac, near Bordeaux, on 25 December 1880. Of Charles Stuart's children, the son, Charles Edward Lewis Casimir (1824&#150;1882), served in the Austrian cavalry and married Lady Alice Hay, youngest daughter of the seventeenth earl of Erroll, and died without children. Of the daughters, the eldest, Marie (1823&#150;1873), died unmarried; Louisa Sobieska (1827?&#150;1897) married Edouard von Platt of the Austrian imperial bodyguard and had a son; Clementina (1830?&#150;1894) became a Passionist nun and died at a convent at Bolton, Lancashire. The Stuarts also had a sister, Catherine, who married Count Charles Ferdinand de Lancastro, and whose only son (also Charles Ferdinand), served in Mexico with the Austrian army, but died in London in 1873. The claims to direct male descent from the Young Chevalier thus ended with the death of Charles Edward Lewis Casimir Stuart in 1882.<br>
