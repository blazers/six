<span class="headword">Davis <span class="st"> [Davies; <em>married name </em>Paisible]</span>,  Mary <span class="st"> [Moll]</span></span>  (<em>c.</em>1651&#150;1708), <span class="occ">actress and royal mistress</span>, was said to be &#145;a bastard of Collonell Howard, my Lord Barkeshire&#146;  (Pepys, 9.24), a phrase which is more likely to refer to Thomas Howard (<i>bap</i>. 1619, <i>d</i>. 1706), the future fourth earl, than his father, Thomas (<i>c</i>.1590&#150;1669), the then earl. A later account stated that she was the daughter of a blacksmith from Charlton, Wiltshire, the family seat of the earls of Berkshire. In the early 1660s she was one of the actresses in the Duke's Theatre Company, who were boarded in the house of the company's patentee and manager, Sir William Davenant. She was almost certainly the little girl whose dancing and singing in Davenant's <span class="italic">The Law Against Lovers</span> Pepys admired when he first saw her on 18 February 1662. A year later her dancing in boy's clothes pleased him, &#145;she having very fine legs&#146;  (Pepys, 4.56). In the season of 1663&#150;4 she played Violinda in Robert Stapylton's <span class="italic">The Step-Mother</span> and Aurelia in George Etherege's <span class="italic">The Comical Revenge, or, Love in a Tub</span>; on 8 March 1664 Pepys admired her in <span class="italic">Heraclius</span>: &#145;the little guirle is come to act very prettily and spoke the epilogue most admirably&#146;  (Pepys, 5.78&#150;9). Etherege wrote the role of Gatty for her, the madcap girl of <span class="italic">She Would if She Could</span>, giving her a song and a jig. Pepys considered her much superior to Nell Gwyn as a dancer, and the company's prompter, John Downes, praised her dancing at the end of John Dryden's <span class="italic">Sir Martin Mar-All</span>, in which she created the role of Millisent. In November 1667 the company had a great success with a revival of Davenant's <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>, in which Moll Davis, as the mad Celania, sang &#145;My lodging it is on the cold ground&#146;. Downes remembered that she &#145;perform'd that so Charmingly, that not long after, it Rais'd her from her Bed on the Cold Ground, to a Bed Royal&#146;  (Downes, 55). On 11 January 1668 Pepys learned that Miss Davis was leaving the company because the king, who was in love with her, had given her a ring worth &pound;600 and was furnishing a house for her. Three days later Mrs Pearce told him that the &#145;homely jade&#146; was showing the ring to everyone, that the house was in Suffolk Street, and that Lady Castlemaine, the king's mistress, was jealous. On 31 May 1668 Pepys recorded that she was &#145;quite gone&#146; from the theatre and had appeared in a play at court, when the queen left before she danced her jig  (Pepys, 9.24, 219).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The School of Venus</span> (1716) recounts the story that Nell Gwyn gave her rival sweetmeats laced with a laxative before she visited the king, with the result that Moll was pensioned off with &pound;1000 a year. However, Mary, her daughter with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5144/', "Charles II")</script> and the last of the king's offspring, was not born until 16 October 1673 and Moll certainly continued as a performer in court entertainments. In his 1673 <span class="italic">Epigrams</span> Richard Flecknoe added his poem &#145;On her Excellent Singing&#146; to his 1669 effusion &#145;To M. M. Davies. On her Excellent Dancing&#146;. Between February and April 1675 she was the principal singer in the performances of John Crowne's court masque <span class="italic">Calisto</span>. The young princesses Mary and Anne had the leading acting roles, while Moll Davis portrayed the River Thames in the sung prologue and the shepherdess Sylvia in the musical interludes. Crowne defended his unorthodox casting of a woman as the River Thames, saying that his purpose was to delight the court: &#145;and the graceful motions and admirable singing of Mrs. <i>Davis</i>, did sufficiently prove the discretion of my choice&#146;  (Crowne, sig. a3). A satire of 1681 implied that Moll Davis was the mistress of Baptist May, the keeper of the privy purse, who kept her at the king's expense. In the &#145;Masque for the Entertainment of the King&#146;, John Blow's opera <span class="italic">Venus and Adonis</span> (BL, Add. MS 22100), she created the role of Venus, while her daughter, Lady Mary Tudor, sang Cupid. The performance took place after 10 December 1680, when her daughter received her title, and before April 1684, when the opera was performed by a cast of young gentlewomen at Josias Priest's school at Chelsea. The king granted his daughter an annuity of &pound;1500 in September 1683 and she was married to Edward, Viscount Radcliffe, later earl of Derwentwater, in August 1687. Two of their three sons were to be executed for their parts in the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745.<br>
<br>In December 1686 Mary Davis (flatteringly described on the marriage allegation as aged about twenty-five) married the instrumentalist and composer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21136/', "James Paisible (d. 1721)")</script>, a fellow performer in <span class="italic">Calisto</span>. Paisible was a member of James II's private musick and became a performer in his Catholic chapel. The Paisibles appear to have spent some time at James's exiled court in St Germain-en-Laye, although in February 1692 they began a chancery suit in England to recover money owed to Mrs Paisible. During 1693 both James and Marie Paisible obtained French passports to return to England. Paisible re-established himself in London's musical life, and in January 1698 he and his wife were granted a licence to remain in England. &#145;James Paisible now in London&#146;, who received &pound;50 in Paisible's will, was probably not her son, but the &#145;James Peasable of James &amp; Eliz. born 8 July Bastard&#146; who was baptized at St Anne's, Soho, on 19 July 1702. Mary Paisible died probably at her home in Dean Street, Soho, and was buried at St Anne's, Soho, on 24 February 1708.<br>
