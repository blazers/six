<span class="headword">Black,  George</span>  (1890&#150;1945), <span class="occ">theatre manager and impresario</span>, was born on 20 April 1890 at 3 Court, 7 Sutton Street, Birmingham, one of three sons of George Black, then a house-painter, and his wife, Mary Davies. In the late 1890s his father gave up a post as property master at the Theatre Royal, Birmingham, to tour the fairgrounds with a waxworks show, and George's first job was to collect the admission money. In 1905 the waxworks were exchanged for one of Robert Paul's Animatographs, an early cinema projector. Rather than touring, Black senior decided to settle down in Sunderland, his home town, turning a deconsecrated chapel into the Monkwearmouth Picture Hall, one of the first permanent cinemas in Britain. George worked the projector and sang songs in between the shows. The cinema prospered and more were bought. His father died in 1910 but George and his brothers Alfred and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56529/', "Edward Black")</script> built up a circuit of thirteen cinemas. In 1919 they sold them for &pound;280,000 but immediately set about establishing another circuit. In 1928 this too was sold, to Sir Walter Gibbons's conglomerate, the General Theatre Corporation (GTC), but George insisted on being given a seat on the board of directors. By the end of the year GTC had been swallowed by a rival, the Gaumont-British Picture Corporation, and Black was the only one of the original directors to retain his position. He was given charge of GTC's non-cinema interests&#151;twelve provincial music-halls and the London Palladium.<br>
<br>With the support of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56615/', "Val Parnell")</script>, a young showman who had worked as a booker for the London Theatres of Variety circuit, which had also been taken over by GTC, Black sought to revive music-hall as a popular form of entertainment. He argued that there was still a demand for live entertainment but that people were deserting the music-halls because they were dirty, old-fashioned, and badly run. He showed how the trend might be reversed by producing imaginative and lavishly mounted variety programmes at the London Palladium which filled the 2200 seat theatre to capacity. In November 1932 he expanded his operations when Gaumont-British bought a controlling interest in Moss Empires, the largest surviving circuit of music-halls. Black was able to combine his GTC halls with the thirty-odd Moss Empires&#151;which included the Leicester Square Hippodrome and the Holborn Empire. This meant that the London Palladium was at the apex of a substantial circuit of live entertainment venues.<br>
<br>The Crazy Gang, the mainstay of the Palladium between 1932 and 1940, was essentially the brainchild of Val Parnell, but it was the powerful personality of George Black that managed to exert a measure of discipline over this anarchic team of zany comedians whose practical jokes often threatened to disrupt the smooth running of the Palladium. During the war, Black evolved a different strategy for the Palladium, presenting shows such as <span class="italic">Garrison Theatre</span> and <span class="italic">Happy and Glorious</span> designed to fit the different phases of the war. <span class="italic">Happy and Glorious</span>, starring Tommy Trinder, was the longest lasting show in the Palladium's history, and was still running early in 1945 at the time of Black's death.<br>
<br>George Black was married to Hannah Mary Gibson, known as May Gibson, an actress who appeared in <span class="italic">Dick Whittington</span> at the Palladium in 1914, long before Black's involvement with the hall. They had two sons, George and Alfred, and a daughter, Pauline Mary. The sons followed in their father's footsteps as theatrical impresarios, though they were also involved in film production and in the setting up of Tyne Tees Television.<br>
<br>A man of decided views, George Black was once described (by lyric writer Henry Purcell) as &#145;a virile hurricane blowing across the stage, sweeping away all nonsense&#146;  (Bevan, 83). He was an outspoken critic of theatrical agents for their failure to foster new talent, and also of the BBC, which he regarded as a parasite sucking away his artists and his audiences. Nevertheless, he made few enemies and is generally regarded, along with C. B. Cochran, as one of the last great showmen committed to live entertainment. Black died at 40 Upper Grosvenor Street, London, on 4 March 1945.<br>
