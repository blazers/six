<span class="headword">Stannard,  Joseph</span>  (1797&#150;1830), <span class="occ">marine and landscape painter and etcher</span>, was born on 13 September 1797 in Norwich, and baptized on 17 September at the church of St Michael at Plea, the eldest son of Abraham Stannard (1765&#150;1838), landlord of a public house, and his wife, Mary Bell (1769&#150;1848). When he was still a boy, Stannard was sent to the Norwich school artist Robert Ladbrooke (1769&#150;1842), to learn to paint, and he remained with him for seven years. In 1811 at the age of fourteen he exhibited with the Norwich Society of Artists, and continued to exhibit with them regularly until 1830. His early exhibits included still lifes and landscapes, but about 1819 he seemed to concentrate on figure subjects and portraits. He exhibited in London with the British Institution between 1819 and 1829 and the Society (later Royal Society) of British Artists in 1824&#150;5. In 1821&#150;2 he visited Holland where he studied the work of the Dutch masters. The visit seems to have had a profound effect and developed his interest in marine painting. Financial difficulty may have forced him to go to London in 1823, and it may have been while he was there that William Beechey painted his romantic portrait of Stannard (1824; Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery). By 1824 he was back in Norwich experimenting in etching and produced some of the finest etchings of the Norwich school. A complete set of eleven Norfolk landscapes and coastal subjects dated between 1824 and 1827 is in the British Museum. Edward Thomas Daniell (1804&#150;1842) also learned to etch in Stannard's studio at this time.<br>
<br>In 1825 Stannard exhibited with the Norwich Society his masterpiece <span class="italic">Thorpe Water Frolic&#151;Afternoon</span> (Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery), in which Stannard shows himself standing in a boat. He was a skilled oarsman and owned a skiff in which he entered rowing races with great success. His knowledge of ships gained him a reputation for accurately depicting rigging in his marine paintings: &#145;every rope is right&#146;  (<span class="italic">Norfolk Chronicle</span>, 6 Oct 1827). He also excelled in swimming and ice skating. From this time his financial position began to improve from the sale of paintings and commissions from local patrons. He worked primarily in oil and found his subjects in the scenery of the Norfolk rivers and coast, especially at Thorpe and Great Yarmouth. His paintings indicate a firm grasp of the work of the seventeenth-century Dutch masters and he ranks highly among the Norwich school artists. He rarely worked in watercolour but produced many sensitive figure and boat studies in pencil and chalk. Some of his works he signed J. Stannard, others with initials, sometimes with the JS conjoined. On 3 January 1826 he married Emily Coppin (1803&#150;1885), an accomplished flower and still-life painter. The couple lived at 5 St Giles Terrace, Norwich, and in 1827 their daughter Emily (<i>d</i>. 1894) was born.<br>
<br>For the last few years of his life Stannard suffered from ill health: &#145;The consequence of his too intense application was disorder upon the nervous system, and his eyes became alarmingly affected&#146;  (<span class="italic">Norwich Mercury</span>, 11 Dec 1830). On 7 December 1830 he died at his home, 5 St Giles Terrace, Norwich, and was buried on 16 December at St John Maddermarket Church, Norwich.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_26285"></a><span class="headword">Alfred Stannard</span>  (1806&#150;1889), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Norwich in June 1806. He was the brother and pupil of Joseph Stannard. He painted Norfolk landscapes, marine and coastal subjects, often in imitation of his more talented brother. He exhibited with the Norwich Society of Artists in 1820&#150;32, the Society of British Artists in 1825&#150;43, and the British Institution in 1826&#150;60. In 1827 he married Martha Sparkes (1809&#150;1873). Of their numerous children, most of whom did not live to reach maturity, two became artists&#151;Alfred George (1828&#150;1885), a landscape painter, and Eloise Harriet (1829&#150;1915), a painter of fruit and flowers. From about 1838 much of Stannard's work was taken up with teaching, and his most successful pupil was Henry Bright (1810&#150;1873). Towards the end of his life he received an annual pension of &pound;50 from the Turner Fund of the Royal Academy. He died at his home at St Andrew's Hall Plain, Norwich, on 26 January 1889 and was buried at Norwich cemetery on 31 January. The work of both artists is well represented in the collection of Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery.<br>
