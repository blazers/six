<span class="headword">Aubrey,  Andrew</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1356), <span class="occ">merchant and mayor of London</span>, was the son of Roger and Denise Aubrey. It is likely that he was born in London since he did not mention a provincial parish in his will. He became the factor of Thomas Enfield, a successful London pepperer, who exported wool and imported spices, and in 1321 himself sued another London pepperer for refusing to pay for goods worth over &pound;212 which Aubrey had agreed to deliver to him at the fair at Lynn. It seems likely that by this date he was at least in his mid-twenties. Enfield died in 1328, and Aubrey soon afterwards married his widow, Joan. She brought a substantial dower of London property, which, added to Aubrey's profits from the wool and spice trades, made him one of the top London taxpayers in 1332.<br>
<br>Inevitably wealth propelled Aubrey into London's governing &eacute;lite, first as sheriff in 1331, then successively as alderman in 1334, auditor of the city's accounts in 1337, and MP for London in 1337 and 1340. His wool exports also involved him in Edward III's schemes for financing his war against France. In 1338 the king seized wool worth over &pound;156 from him in Antwerp. Such interruptions of the wool trade, and the export of coin to support the war, as well as the burden of heavy taxation, were imposing great strains on London's economy and fragile social cohesion when Aubrey was elected mayor in 1339. Tough but intelligent leadership was needed to quell the increasing disorders and affrays in the city and to avoid the king taking over its government. The mayor was expected to suppress riots in person, assisted only by his fellow aldermen, and by the few serjeants they commanded. In 1340 street fighting between fishmongers and skinners culminated in a young fishmonger seizing the mayor by the throat, while another dealt a life-threatening blow to one of the serjeants. Aubrey's assailant proved to be Thomas Hansard, the son of a wealthy fishmonger of an established family. Although a severe sentence on Hansard threatened to provoke city-wide disorders, Aubrey knew that the mayor's person had to be treated as sacrosanct if his authority was to be upheld and London's liberties preserved. The city's government had no power to inflict capital punishment, and for a month Aubrey waited in vain to hear from the king, who was overseas. He then ordered the wards to elect a large assembly to debate the punishment of the guilty pair. They were declared worthy of immediate beheading, and the sentence was carried out the same day. However there was no civil commotion, and the king later ratified the mayor's action, while Aubrey was rewarded by re-election as mayor.<br>
<br>The economic difficulties of London were increased in 1344 by the introduction of a gold coinage. This particularly affected the retailers and distributive merchants among the London pepperers, and they responded in 1345 by forming their own fraternity which was attached to the church of St Antonin in the pepperers' trading quarter in Sopers Lane. Andrew Aubrey was too rich to share the particular economic worries of the founders, but he joined the fraternity in 1347 with his son John and his kinsman Thomas, and as alderman of the ward he increased its influence. The fraternity developed later into the powerful London Grocers' Company. Aubrey's wealth is underlined by his investment in a cargo of spices and alum worth &pound;2000 from Bruges in 1348, and by his building in the same year his own chantry chapel, and a house for its chaplains, next to St Antonin's Church. Within a year the catastrophe of the black death made his foresight apposite. But although he made his will in 1349, Aubrey and his son survived the pestilence and in thanksgiving went on pilgrimage to Rome.<br>
<br>Aubrey served again as mayor in 1351, in a further crisis arising from London's loss of its commercial privileges. These had protected its retail and distributive trade against competition from aliens and non-citizens. As in 1340, Aubrey showed his belief in consultation by summoning a large common council to give advice, and possibly to raise money to buy a reversal of royal policy. But although he himself had lent considerable amounts of money to the king, he could not change royal policy in 1351, while in 1353 London merchants suffered another blow when the king forbade English merchants to export wool. Aubrey then bought property in Boston, Lincolnshire, possibly so that he could export through aliens, and he began to sell his London property. And to his holdings in Middlesex and Essex he added a country estate in Hertfordshire, which his widow subsequently inherited. In 1355 he retired as alderman and he died in 1356. A monument commemorating him in the church of St Nicholas Cole Abbey was recorded by Stow in 1603. His son John continued his business but did not emulate his father's significant political services to the mid-fourteenth-century city.<br>
