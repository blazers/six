<span class="headword">Wilson, Sir  Jacob</span>  (1836&#150;1905), <span class="occ">agriculturist</span>, was born at Crackenthorpe Hall, Westmorland, on 16 November 1836, the elder son of Joseph Wilson, a farmer. His mother, Ann, was the daughter of Joseph Bowstead of Beck Bank, Cumberland. Wilson received his early education at Long Marton, Westmorland, and he studied land agency for a short time in London. In 1854 he entered the Royal Agricultural College at Cirencester, where he was highly successful; he gained his agricultural diploma after eighteen months' study. He then remained at Cirencester for a further six months as honorary farm bailiff (a post of distinction for students), after which he was commissioned to remodel a Swiss estate on the English system. He returned home in 1857 to assist his father in the management of Woodhorn Manor, a large farm near Newbiggin on the Northumberland coast. Here Wilson took a close interest in agricultural mechanics, especially the new reaping machines which were then coming into vogue, and in steam cultivation which received a great deal of attention in the farming community of the late 1850s. In 1859 he was awarded the first agricultural diploma to be given by the Highland and Agricultural Society, and four years later the same body gave him a special prize for a report on mechanical harvesting.<br>
<br>In the 1860s Wilson developed his profession of land agency and in 1866 he was appointed by the earl of Tankerville to be agent for his Chillingham estates. Here Wilson instigated a series of experiments in crossing selected specimens from the famous Chillingham herd of wild white cattle with pure-bred shorthorns. This led to some successes at stock shows, although the cross-bred progeny suffered from temperamental defects derived from their wild ancestry. Wilson's experience of land management at Chillingham, augmented by that gained from various other estates with which he became associated throughout England, led to his being much sought after as a witness or arbitrator in valuation cases. His professional interests also influenced his campaign for legislation to repress the spread of animal diseases. The <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act</span> of 1878, and a further <span class="roman">Animals Act</span> of 1884, which provided for safeguards against the introduction of animal diseases from abroad (especially foot-and-mouth disease), owed much to Wilson's efforts. In 1888 Wilson presided over a departmental committee of the privy council which investigated pleuropneumonia in cattle; as a result, in 1890 the newly formed Board of Agriculture acquired important powers to control animal diseases. Two years later Wilson succeeded Sir James Caird in the important position of director of the land department and agricultural adviser to the Board of Agriculture, a post that he occupied until 1902. Wilson was also a member of the royal commissions on agricultural depression (1879&#150;82) and on horse breeding (1887).<br>
<br>Wilson is best known for his long association with the Royal Agricultural Society of England, which he joined in 1860. He was elected to the society's council in 1865 at the unprecedentedly young age of twenty-nine. He acted as a steward or judge in various capacities at many royal shows and in 1876 he succeeded Brandreth Gibbs as the honorary show director, an office which he kept for eighteen years. Between 1868 and 1878 he was also secretary of the Northumberland Agricultural Society, during which time he did much to revitalize and extend its proceedings.<br>
<br>Wilson was highly esteemed within the Victorian agricultural community. His work received recognition on 23 April 1874 on the occasion of his marriage to Margaret, daughter of Thomas Hedley of Cox Lodge Hall, Newcastle upon Tyne, when the Northumberland Agricultural Society gave him silver plate to the value of &pound;500. Ten years later, a subscription in recognition of his public service generated a purse of 3000 guineas, which was presented to him at a banquet presided over by the duke of Richmond and Gordon. He was knighted on 29 June 1889 at the conclusion of the fiftieth royal show, which was held in Windsor Great Park, and the distinction of KCVO was conferred upon him in 1905.<br>
<br>Wilson had a commanding presence and mixed in wide social circles; Edward VII was godfather to his elder son, Albert Edward Jacob, and the duke of Richmond and Gordon was godfather to his second son, Gordon Jacob. Wilson also had two daughters, Beatrice and Mildred. He had extensive interests in field sports and was for a time secretary to the Morpeth hunt; while at Woodhorn Manor he was closely involved with coursing.<br>
<br>In 1881 Wilson moved to Chillingham Barns Farm on the Tankerville estate, which he occupied until his death. Impaired health caused him to restrict his many professional and sporting activities during the last years of his life, but in 1905 he came out of retirement to act again as honorary director of the royal show. This was to be the last of the three shows held at Park Royal, west London, which the society had intended to establish as a permanent showground&#151;a policy which Wilson had strongly opposed. Despite Wilson's immense efforts the event was a financial failure, and his contemporaries considered that his exertions on the showground precipitated the heart failure which caused his death at Chillingham Barns Farm on 11 July 1905, shortly after his return to Northumberland. He was buried at Chillingham on 14 July 1905 and a memorial service was held on the same day at St George's, Hanover Square, London.<br>
