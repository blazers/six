<span class="headword">Christison,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1580/81?), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was a Dominican friar at Montrose by the 1550s. He may have been among those who heard George Wishart preach at Montrose following the latter's return from England in July 1543; like Wishart he almost certainly enjoyed the protection of John Erskine of Dun, hereditary constable of the burgh, after he had himself converted to protestantism. By the spring of 1559 Christison and other evangelical preachers were ministering in Angus (Forfarshire), the Mearns, and Perthshire. The regent, Mary of Guise, responded by ordering that Christison, along with Paul Methven, John Willock, and William Harlaw, should stand trial in the court of justiciary at Stirling on 10 May 1559 for preaching seditious doctrine, usurping the ministerial office, improperly administering the eucharist at Easter, and disobeying Lenten proclamations that threatened capital punishment to anyone who disrupted traditional services. Although the fourth earl of Glencairn and Sir Hugh Campbell of Loudoun, sheriff of Ayr, temporarily dissuaded Mary from proceeding with the trial, she soon reversed course, only to find that the ministers' followers were preparing to gather in Perth and accompany them to Stirling in a show of support. None the less, when Christison and his associates failed to appear at Stirling on the specified day, they were outlawed, while Erskine of Dun, as Christison's surety, was fined.<br>
<br>By the spring of 1560 Christison had accepted an appointment as minister at Fetteresso, west of Stonehaven, Kincardineshire, with responsibility as well for the churches at Dunnottar and Glenbervie in the same county. He did not, however, have access to the vicarage and parsonage at Dunnottar, which belonged to the deanery of the collegiate church of Holy Trinity, Edinburgh, and were shared by the parsons William Salmond (<i>d</i>. 1576) and John Elder (<i>d</i>. 1578), and then by Andrew Mylne (to 1579). From 1561 Christison was receiving the pension of &pound;16 per annum allocated to friars who embraced protestantism. In 1563 he was given assistance in his ministerial duties by the appointment of James Paton (or Pawtoun) and John Auchenleck to be readers at Dunnottar and Glenbervie respectively (though Auchenleck stayed less than five years, if he was the man of the same name presented to the vicarage of Menmuir, Angus, on 21 January 1568). Christison remained active at Dunnottar and Fetteresso until at least 1569, but some time before 28 September 1570 he moved to Glenbervie. He was still minister there in 1580, but in 1581 Archibald Douglas, a son of the ninth earl of Angus, is recorded as parson of Glenbervie, suggesting that Christison had now died.<br>
