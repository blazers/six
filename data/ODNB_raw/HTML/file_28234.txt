<span class="headword">Verney,  Ralph</span>, second Earl Verney  (1714&#150;1791), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 1 February 1714, the second son of Ralph Verney, first Earl Verney (1683&#150;1752), landowner of Middle Claydon, Buckinghamshire, and his wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1748), daughter of Henry Paschall of Baddow Hall, Essex. He was educated at Brentford, Middlesex, from 1721 and entered the Middle Temple in 1729. He was admitted fellow-commoner of Christ's College, Cambridge, on 20 April 1733, and graduated MA in 1735. His elder brother, John (1711&#150;1737), died on 3 June 1737, leaving a widow, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nicholson (<i>d</i>. 1789), with an unborn child. Ralph was therefore confirmed as heir to the family title and estates and styled Lord Fermanagh only when his sister-in-law gave birth to a daughter, Mary (1737&#150;1810), on 21 October 1737. On 11 September 1740 he married Mary (1716&#150;1791), daughter and coheir of Henry Herring, of Egham, Surrey, a London merchant and director of the Bank of England, but the couple were childless. As one of the largest landowners in Buckinghamshire, Verney inherited a substantial fortune, to which was added a wedding dowry in excess of &pound;40,000. &#145;A man of great plainness&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 61/1, 1791, 383), he ultimately squandered this wealth through ruinous extravagance, injudicious business dealings, and an absurd generosity that also destroyed his parliamentary interest.<br>
<br>Shortly after his father's death, on 4 October 1752, Verney embarked upon lavish improvements to Claydon House, designed to outshine the palace constructed at Stowe by his Buckinghamshire rivals, the Grenvilles, and thus make Claydon the political and cultural centre of the county. A new wing, with a suite of rococo rooms by Luke Lightfoot, was added, and work was begun on a domed rotunda and great ballroom, designed by Sir Thomas Robinson, but these were unfinished at Verney's death and were demolished in 1792. By 1770 Verney was laying out the gardens with trees and plants obtained from the Southern Netherlands. He also collected books, pictures, and works of art for Claydon and sought further fame as a patron of literature to add to the pleasure he derived from his election as FRS on 20 April 1758. In his heyday he cut a magnificent figure:<blockquote>Lavish in his personal expenses, and fond of show, he was one of the last of the English nobility who, to the splendour of a gorgeous equipage, attached musicians constantly attendant upon him, not only on state occasions but in his journeys and visits: a brace of tall negroes with silver French horns behind his coach and six, perpetually making a noise. (Lipscomb, 1.183&#150;4)</blockquote>Verney also spent profusely on politics. The first earl had built up a strong interest at Wendover and on 17 January 1753 Verney returned himself as MP for the borough, which he represented until 1761. He was a regular government supporter in the Commons and placed one seat at Wendover at the duke of Newcastle's disposal in both 1754 and 1761. In 1761 he used the second seat to bring in his cousin Major Verney Lovett (1705&#150;1771). Meanwhile, he contested Great Bedwyn, Wiltshire, where he had been building up an interest since his purchase of the manor of Stock in 1752. However, he was soundly defeated by Lord Bruce's interest and came in instead for the Welsh borough of Carmarthen, where he paid &pound;2000 to secure his return.<br>
<br>Verney, disappointed by his failure to obtain any patronage from Newcastle, remained a government supporter after Newcastle's resignation in 1762. On 9 December he seconded the address on the peace preliminaries on behalf of the Bute ministry. On 9 April 1763, the day after Bute's resignation, he set out his credentials for a British peerage in a letter to Henry Fox: &#145;My fortune is above &pound;10,000 per annum &hellip; my own personal attachment to Government has been sincere, constant, and uniform &hellip; and &hellip; I have expended very large sums in several elections without obtaining, or indeed asking to this time, any favour whatever&#146;  (Bute MSS). On 29 April 1763 he similarly approached Grenville: &#145;My whole life&#146;, he wrote, &#145;has shown how much I have been inclined to forward the business of the Crown&#146;  (Smith, 2.49&#150;50). Though Verney was offered no assurances he remained loyal to Grenville's administration when it was being run hard in the Commons over general warrants. The solitary exception to this record was his speech in favour of repealing the cider excise on 31 January 1764.<br>
<br>When Rockingham replaced Grenville at the Treasury in July 1765 he unexpectedly chose William Burke, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Verney, as under-secretary of state to Henry Conway. Verney was also rewarded by his appointment as a privy councillor on 22 November 1765, an unusual distinction for one who held no office. He brought in Edmund Burke, William's relation, for Wendover on 23 December 1765. Meanwhile, Verney had been buying up the independent burgages at Great Bedwyn and even offered to buy out Lord Bruce. To retrieve control Bruce agreed to pay Verney 18,000 guineas and to bring in William Burke on 16 June 1766 for the existing vacancy.<br>
<br>Verney followed Rockingham into opposition in 1766. After his long experience of unrequited political support, the marquess's act of recognition had given him a lasting sense of gratitude. On 18 August 1767 Edmund Burke confirmed to Rockingham that Verney's interest was &#145;always at the service of the cause&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.322). For the next sixteen years Verney voted consistently with the party, although he almost never addressed the Commons. At the general election of 1768, when many of the Buckinghamshire country gentlemen signalled their unwillingness to accept the predominance of the Grenvilles, Verney was returned unopposed as one of the knights of the shire, a position he had long coveted. With Bruce's agreement William Burke was once more given one of the Great Bedwyn seats, while Verney again returned Edmund at Wendover. However, he unexpectedly lost control of the other seat through what Edmund later considered &#145;our own egregious neglects&#146;  (to Charles O'Hara, 9 Aug 1770, <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 2.148). Verney allowed his tenants to live rent free provided that they voted for his nominees, but he had reputedly become so easy-going about this arrangement that a secret understanding had been established by &#145;Mr. Atkins, a considerable lace manufacturer&#146;  (Oldfield, 1.40) in favour of Sir Robert Darling. Verney subsequently endeavoured to tighten up control at Wendover by ejecting voters from their houses and reinstating them only after extracting &#145;a promise of good behaviour in future&#146;  (Oldfield, 1.41). This allowed him to return his friend Joseph Bullock there unopposed in 1770 following Darling's death that year.<br>
<br>Verney's financial affairs were now deteriorating, but the lavish expenditure on Claydon was only partly to blame. His speculative purchases of West Indian lands fell heavily in value, an enterprising venture for the manufacture of French cambrics at Winchelsea backfired, and the initial success of his shareholding in the Ranelagh Gardens on the Thames was not sustained. Far worse were his incautious personal transactions in East India stock and his utterly reckless sense of generosity to the Burkes that financed similar speculations by William. Disaster now struck. The first great crash in East India stock in 1769 turned envisaged fortunes into ruinous losses, which the Burkes could not make good to Verney, whose own risk taking cost him dear. Still more catastrophic were the speculations on the Amsterdam market in which Verney and William Burke ran up an accumulated liability of &pound;47,000 that fell entirely on the earl. By the general election of 1774 Verney's circumstances had brought him to virtual political impotence. There was no realistic prospect of making arrangements for William Burke's continuation at Great Bedwyn, and he was obliged to ask Edmund to find another constituency to allow him to sell his seats at Wendover. Edmund, who successfully contested Bristol, readily understood. As he explained to Rockingham on 18 September 1774: &#145;He will, indeed he must, have those to stand for Wendover who can bear the charge which that borough is to him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 3.33). None the less, he lamented &#145;the necessity which drives him to abandon the distinguished courses of disinterestedness and friendship, that has hitherto actuated him&#146;  (ibid., 3.33). Meanwhile Verney was somewhat fortuitously returned again unopposed for Buckinghamshire because of the last minute withdrawal for financial reasons of Richard Lowndes, whom Temple had hoped to run alongside his nephew and heir George Grenville jun. Despite a deteriorating relationship with the Grenville party, both sides were content for another uncontested county election in 1780 when Verney and Thomas Grenville were both returned. Verney again sold both his seats at Wendover which were filled without opposition.<br>
<br>The formation of the second Rockingham administration in March 1782 and the prominent appointments given to the Burkes temporarily gave Verney renewed hope. Yet nothing was done for Verney despite his loyal record over the preceding sixteen years. After Shelburne succeeded at the Treasury in July 1782 Verney distanced himself from Burke and signalled his support for the new minister. He then threw in his lot with the Fox&#150;North coalition and voted for parliamentary reform on 7 May 1783 and for Fox's <span class="roman">East India Bill</span> on 27 November 1783. These changing political allegiances were largely motivated by Verney's desperation to hold his seat in order to protect himself from his creditors. His situation was now so poor that in 1783 he had been forced to sue Edmund Burke in chancery for a &pound;6000 loan made in 1769. In the absence of any bond Verney failed to establish his claim. It seems likely that his capital had been swallowed up in William Burke's financial collapse. He did hold &pound;20,000 in bonds against William, but the true debt was far in excess of this figure. In addition, he had a claim against Richard Burke for about &pound;19,000, while Edmund was also estimated to owe &pound;11,000. However, despite his distress, Verney &#145;would never rack up his tenants in their rents&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 61/1, 1791, 383).<br>
<br>At the 1784 general election Verney was narrowly defeated by a Pittite candidate and petitioned in vain. He also failed at Wendover, having temporarily lost control of the borough and, deprived of parliamentary immunity from debt, fled his creditors to France. Such was his personal popularity, nevertheless, that a Buckinghamshire Independent Club was formed to give him political support, of which a committee of trustees and lawyers dealt with his debts, Wendover being sold in 1788.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1790 Verney, who had returned quietly from France, was elected for the county without opposition but at this moment of triumph the bailiffs were put in at Claydon, which they rapidly cleared. Local tradition states that a stable boy later found the septuagenarian earl wandering forlornly in the shuttered rooms of the empty, unfinished house. The boy fed and cared for his old master and concealed him for weeks in the house. Verney's confusion and gloom were exacerbated on 20 January 1791 when the countess died suddenly at their house in Curzon Street, Mayfair; she was buried at Middle Claydon on 4 February. Verney himself reportedly only eluded his creditors by escaping in his wife's hearse. The countess had borne her misfortunes &#145;with the greatest magnanimity, and readily parted with her money, and even her jewels, at times when Lord V. was pressed&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 61/1, 1791, 383). Verney survived her by only a few weeks. He died at Curzon Street on 31 March 1791 still owing &pound;115,731 5<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. He was buried in the family vault at Middle Claydon on 8 April.<br>
<br>On his death Verney's titles became extinct. The family estates passed to his niece Mary, who on Pitt's recommendation was created Baroness Fermanagh of Ireland on 13 June 1792. Her uncle had held out for the full &pound;20,000 plus interest owed to him by William Burke, but Richard Burke now agreed to pay her an immediate &pound;5250 as composition with a vague agreement for a further &pound;5000 four years later. This was unfulfilled and the baroness's lawyers unsuccessfully pursued William until his death in 1798. When she died unmarried on 15 November 1810 Lady Fermanagh bequeathed all her estates to her maternal half-sister Catherine 
    (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Calvert, <i>d</i>. 1820)
  , directing her husband, the Revd Robert Wright (<i>d</i>. 1827), to take the name and bear the arms of Verney.<br>
