<span class="headword">Simon <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Potter]</span>,  Shena Dorothy</span>, Lady Simon of Wythenshawe  (1883&#150;1972), <span class="occ">politician and educational reformer</span>, was born in Croydon, Surrey, on 21 October 1883, the second of nine children of John Wilson Potter (1856&#150;1933), a shipowner of Scottish descent, and his wife, Janet Boyd, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thompson (<i>d</i>. 1946). Educated at home, she passed the higher local education examination and went on to read economics at Newnham College, Cambridge, from 1904 to 1907. She narrowly missed a first in the new economics tripos and in 1907 began postgraduate study at the London School of Economics, where she developed a close friendship with Beatrice Webb, and came into close contact with the new Liberal theorists Graham Wallas and Leonard Hobhouse. She failed to complete her thesis, which focused on the emergence of the Labour Party, largely because she undertook the role of honorary secretary to the legislative committee of the National Union of Women Workers. This prompted an interest in wage boards, which she investigated in Australia and New Zealand. This in turn led to her involvement in a special committee formed to ensure that the rights of married women were safeguarded in Lloyd George's 1911 <span class="roman">National Insurance Bill</span>.<br>
<br>Shena Potter was also closely involved in the female suffrage campaign. Despite opposition from her family she spoke at suffrage meetings and joined marches. She admired the militant leaders and recognized the value of militant tactics for the vote to be gained, but she herself refused to participate in any militant actions. Her Newnham contemporary Eva Hubback introduced her to the Mancunian social reformer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36095/', "Ernest Emil Darwin Simon (1879&#150;1960)")</script>, who &#145;wanted a wife who could play Beatrice to his Sidney Webb&#146;  (Harrison, 285). They married on 22 November 1912 in a register office, since both were agnostics, and formed a happy and effective partnership, moving in progressive intellectual circles between the wars. Settling in Manchester, they started a family: a first son was born in 1913, a second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76677/', "Brian Simon (1915&#150;2002)")</script>, the educationist and historian, followed two years later, and a third and last child, a girl, was born in 1917, but died aged twelve after a long illness.<br>
<br>After her marriage Shena Simon became increasingly involved in Liberal politics in Manchester, and was elected in 1924 as a Liberal city councillor representing Chorlton ward. She quickly established a reputation as a leading radical on the city council, pursuing educational reform. She became chairman of the education committee in 1932, the first woman to hold that office. She was also closely involved with the development of the Wythenshawe estate, developed after Ernest bought Wythenshawe Park and Wythenshawe Hall and presented it to the city of Manchester to allow the development of a model satellite town for the relief of Manchester's overcrowded centre. Shena Simon sat on the city council's Wythenshawe estate special committee from 1928, becoming its chairman in 1931. In 1933 she was defeated in Chorlton as a result of a Conservative backlash. In 1935, after a period out of party politics, she joined the Labour Party a decade before her husband. Although she failed to be elected when she contested the Moston ward in 1936, she returned to the education committee as a co-opted member and continued to hold this position until she retired in 1970.<br>
<br>Shena Simon's work was not confined to Manchester city council. Between 1929 and 1931 she served on the royal commission on licensing and in 1931 she was appointed to the consultative committee of the Board of Education, contributing especially to its work on secondary education. She served on the University of Manchester council from 1921 until 1966. In 1938 she served on a departmental committee on rating and valuation, her appointment reflecting her reputation as a notable authority on a highly technical subject. In 1942 she was involved in forming the Council for Educational Advance. In the years following the Second World War she was a strong advocate of comprehensive education in Manchester. Her <span class="italic">Three Schools in One</span> (1948) was an influential contribution to the debate on the tripartite system of secondary education in England. Her other publications addressed topics of local government finance and administration.<br>
<br>Shena Simon also continued to pursue feminist issues. In 1922, as lady mayoress, she refused to attend a function at a hospital with no women on the medical staff or the board of management. This action forced a change in policy. Her membership of the city council enabled her to champion feminist causes, the most notable being a campaign against the marriage bar on women teachers in Manchester, which was lifted in 1928 as a result of her efforts. Like others who had campaigned for women's suffrage, she became involved in the inter-war movements for equal citizenship, and was a founder of the Manchester and Salford Women Citizens' Association. With her husband she also helped to found in 1934 the Association for Education in Citizenship to promote the study of democratic politics in schools and universities. Her civic consciousness underlay her reforms in the field of public housing, and her advocacy for raising the school-leaving age and for the introduction of comprehensive schools.<br>
<br>Shena became Lady Simon in 1932 when her husband was knighted. In 1947 her husband was raised to the peerage as the first Baron Simon of Wythenshawe. After his death in 1960 she considered moving to London, but resolved to stay in Manchester. She wanted to continue to serve the university and the education committee. A number of personal honours followed in later life: in 1964 she was made a freeman of the city of Manchester; in 1965 she became an honorary fellow of the London School of Economics; in 1966 she was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Manchester. In her later years she allowed more time for the leisure pursuits that she had enjoyed throughout her life, especially detective novels, cinema, and the music of Gracie Fields. She continued to lead a full and active life until her death, in Manchester, owing to failing health through old age, on 17 July 1972. Her contribution to education in Manchester was recognized in 1982 with the opening of Shena Simon College.<br>
