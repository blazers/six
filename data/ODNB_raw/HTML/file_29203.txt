<span class="headword">Whichcote,  George</span>  (1794&#150;1891), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born on 21 December 1794, was the fourth son of Sir Thomas Whichcote, fifth baronet (1763&#150;1824), of Aswarby Park, Lincolnshire, and his wife, Diana (<i>d</i>. 1826), third daughter of Edmund Turnor of Panton and Stoke Rochford. In 1803 he entered Rugby School, where he fagged for William Charles Macready, the actor. In December 1810, on leaving Rugby, he joined the 52nd foot as a volunteer, and received a commission as ensign on 10 January 1811. That year he joined the British army in the Spanish peninsula, where his regiment, with the 43rd and the 95th, formed the famous light division. He took part in the battle of Sabugal on 3 April, and in the combat of El Bodon on 25 September, though his regiment was not engaged. He assisted in the storming of Ciudad Rodrigo on 19 January 1812, and of Badajoz on 6 April. On 8 July 1812 he became lieutenant, and was present at the battle of Salamanca on 22 July and at that of Vitoria on 21 June 1813, where the 52nd carried the village of Magarita with an impetuous charge. He took part with his regiment in the combats in the Pyrenees in July and August, the combat of Vera on 3 October, and the battle of the Nivelle on 10 November, of the Nive on 10&#150;13 December, of Orthez on 27 February 1814, of Tarbes on 12 March, and of Toulouse on 12 April. He was the first man in the British army to enter Toulouse. While in command of an advanced picket he observed the French retreat, and, boldly pushing on, took possession of the town. At the close of the war the regiment was placed in garrison at Castelsarrasin on the Garonne, and afterwards was sent to Ireland. Whichcote took part in the battle of Waterloo, where the 52nd completed the rout of the imperial guard. He was quartered in Paris during the occupation by the allies, and on his return home received the Waterloo medal and the silver war medal with nine clasps, before he had attained his majority. When his regiment was sent to Australia, Whichcote transferred into the Buffs.<br>
<br>On 22 January 1818 Whichcote obtained his captaincy, and in 1822 transferred to the 4th dragoon guards. He was made major on 29 October 1825, lieutenant-colonel on 28 June 1838, and colonel on 11 November 1851. In 1825 he was placed on half pay, and on 4 June 1857 attained the rank of major-general; he was promoted lieutenant-general on 31 January 1864, and became a full general on 5 December 1871. In 1842 he married Charlotte Sophia (<i>d</i>. 1880), daughter of Philip Monckton; they had no children. Whichcote died on 26 August 1891 at Meriden, near Coventry, where he had lived since retiring from active service, and was buried there on 31 August. At his death he was well known as almost the last surviving British officer who had fought at Waterloo.<br>
