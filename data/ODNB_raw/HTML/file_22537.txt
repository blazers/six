<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hennessy, Sir  John Pope</span>  (1834&#150;1891), <span class="occ">politician and colonial governor</span>, was born on 8 August 1834 in Cork, the third of five sons of John Hennessy (<i>d</i>. 26 April 1867), hide merchant, of Cork, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Casey, butter merchant, of Cork. Hennessy's parents were Roman Catholic and anti-British. His father's family claimed descent from the indigenous Irish landed gentry and styled themselves Hennessy of Ballyhennessy, co. Kerry. As a boy Hennessy suffered from chronic bronchitis, and was educated by a private tutor. His family intended him for a medical career and for five years he attended Queen's College, Cork, gaining first-class honours in surgery and medicine. In May 1855 he went to London, where he continued his medical training at Charing Cross Hospital, but later that year he procured a clerkship in the Privy Council Office. Small, pushy, arrogant, ambitious, manipulative, and an accomplished charmer and bluffer, he was part of the migration of &#145;middle-class or <i>petit bourgeois</i> careerists &hellip; micks on the make&#146;  (Foster, <span class="italic">Paddy and Mr Punch</span>, 283&#150;4). He started to read for the bar, in preparation for a political career.<br>
<br>Like some other Irish Catholics then, angered by the Liberals' policies on the Queen's Colleges and the <span class="roman">Ecclesiastical Titles Bill</span>, Hennessy became a Conservative, and he especially admired Disraeli. In the general election of 1859 he stood as &#145;Irish Nationalist Conservative&#146; candidate for King's county, generally supporting Disraeli but independent on Irish issues. Surprisingly, with no money or powerful patrons, he was elected, the first Roman Catholic Conservative MP. Surviving on arrogance, bluff, and possibly a clandestine subsidy from Conservative Party funds, he publicized himself, intrigued, cultivated Disraeli and others likely to be useful to him, and baited the Liberal leaders. He advocated amendment of Irish land laws and the reclamation of bogs to counter emigration, and criticized the government system of education. He supported the causes of Poland and Italy, and contributed to some minor reforms: amendment of the Irish poor law (1861&#150;2), the <span class="roman">Prison Ministers Act</span> (1863), and amendment of the <span class="roman">Mines Regulation Acts</span>. In November 1861 he was called to the bar at the Inner Temple. His rise had been meteoric and some contemporaries considered him the model for Trollope's Phineas Finn. However, at the general election of 1865 he was defeated by seven votes, through not paying his debts from the previous election to the King's county jaunting-car owners; they refused to work for him, so he could not transport rural voters to the polls. He was involved in business speculation, and acquired a mistress, Miss A. M. Conyngham, with whom he had two illegitimate daughters. In 1866, with &pound;2000 borrowed from a moneylender, he attempted to gain wealth by snaring a rich heiress, a Miss Canning, into marriage, but failed. In debt, he lived in hiding in the country. In 1866 the Conservatives returned to office and, through Disraeli's patronage, Hennessy procured a colonial governorship, of Labuan, a small island off Borneo. With typical arrogance he accepted under protest, wanting Queensland&#151;which was not even vacant&#151;and complained of being given &#145;such a small place&#146;  (Pope-Hennessy, 51). In fact it was only because of lingering &#145;old corruption&#146; and jobbery, and mid-Victorian metropolitan irresponsibility towards the lesser tropical dependencies that so dubious a failed politician&#151;without colonial, naval, military, or administrative experience&#151;was given a position he so little deserved. In September 1867 he sailed for Labuan.<br>
<br>Hennessy was governor of Labuan from 1867 to 1871. It was swampy, unhealthy, backward, and impoverished, and he achieved little there. He freed prisoners (a favourite gesture of his), increased taxes, quarrelled with other officials, and was reproved by the Colonial Office. On 4 February 1868 he married a beautiful but dowryless Eurasian girl, educated in England and Switzerland, Katherine (Kitty) Elizabeth (1850&#150;1923), second child and only daughter of Hugh Low (1824&#150;1905), colonial treasurer at Labuan and botanist, and his wife, Catherine (1828/9&#150;1851), herself half Scottish and half Malay. They had three sons, but reportedly their marriage was not happy. In 1871 Hennessy was designated to the governorship of the Bahamas. He left Labuan in September 1871 and reached London in December.<br>
<br>From February 1872 to February 1873 Hennessy, temporarily seconded from his Bahamas appointment, was governor-in-chief of the British west African settlements&#151;Sierra Leone, the Gambia, the Gold Coast, and Lagos&#151;with his headquarters at Freetown, Sierra Leone. Against Colonial Office advice he insisted on taking his first born, three-year-old son, John Patrick (Johnnie). Soon after arrival at Freetown the child died of dysentery: that year over a quarter of the Europeans died. Hennessy tried to curry favour with the local people and, despite corruption scandals&#151;the creole Treasury cashier stole over &pound;800&#151;wanted the appointment of Creoles to more senior positions: the Colonial Office refused. He criticized missionaries and missionary education (presumably because of his anti-protestant prejudice), praised the Muslims of the interior, and supported Edward Wilmot Blyden's proposal for the establishment of a west African university. He introduced limited sanitary reform in Freetown, and abolished Sierra Leone land and other direct taxes, leaving specific duties the mainstay of the local budget. His tariff chiefly benefited French traders. He also abolished timber duties, removing the only check on deforestation. He was popular with Freetown Africans, and for years afterwards &#145;Pope Hennessy day&#146; was celebrated annually. Before leaving, Hennessy announced a &pound;5000 surplus: later the auditor found he had omitted a month's expenditure. Hennessy claimed that customs revenue would rise, but it fell. By the end of 1873 there was a colonial deficit, the first for nearly twenty-five years. Following the Anglo-Dutch treaty of 1872, Hennessy in April 1872 received from the Dutch their Gold Coast forts. He was made CMG. However, as so often during his colonial career, trouble followed policies. His unpopular appointment of a new civil commissioner at Elmina led to riot and murder there.<br>
<br>At Lagos, annexed by Palmerston in 1861, the British administrator from 1866 was Captain John Hawley Glover RN (1829&#150;1885), a dynamic &#145;man on the spot&#146; who favoured British expansion and had a vigorous, interventionist, anti-Egba and pro-Ibadan policy. In 1872 the colonial secretary, Lord Kimberley, instructed Hennessy to caution Glover. Hennessy went to Lagos in April 1872 and quickly formed an antipathy to Glover. The newly arrived Hennessy told Glover, who had fifteen years' west African experience and spoke Yoruba, &#145;you know nothing of the country, the place or the people&#146;  (Pope-Hennessy, 135). Exceeding Kimberley's instructions, in June he sent Glover home. Kimberley disapproved but did not reverse this. Hennessy quickly and with evident animus reversed Glover's anti-Egba policy. Hennessy's pro-Egba policy soon failed. Glover criticized to Kimberley Hennessy's &#145;vanity and culpable weakness&#146;  (Newbury, 372). On the Gold Coast Hennessy was hostile to the Fante confederation and contributed to its failure. He negotiated with the Asante and as usual thought he was doing well. The Asante invasion of 1873 surprised him, and he initially denied that there was an invasion. However, he left the problem to his successor, as he sailed for Liverpool in February 1873. Back in Britain some blamed him for the Second Anglo-Asante War: he blamed others. Controversy continued between him and the officials with whom he had quarrelled. Sir George Barrow, head of the Colonial Office African department, wrote in February 1873: &#145;one of the &#147;pope's&#148; failings is to endeavour to establish infallibility &amp; at the same time to obtain supremacy&#151;hence his liability to anathematise all around him &hellip; but &hellip; he may be the victim of his own selfish policy&#146;  (Pope-Hennessy, 145). He continued to hope to re-enter Irish politics.<br>
<br>The Colonial Office insisted that Hennessy next be governor of the Bahamas, a post which he had earlier accepted. He demanded a superior governorship and, with mendacious effrontery, claimed he had been insufficiently rewarded after he &#145;abandoned another career to enter the Colonial service&#146;  (Pope-Hennessy, 150). In fact when he procured his first colonial appointment he had been a careerless, disreputable adventurer, in debt and in hiding. He arrived in the Bahamas in May 1873. He introduced some minor reforms and demanded that the crown agents buy a &pound;300 carpet from a shop in Cork. He again mismanaged colonial finances and made false claims about them. A Colonial Office official noted that &#145;when Mr Hennessy leaves a Colony the state of the Finances are not found to be in so satisfactory a state as he has led us to believe&#146;  (ibid., 153). He stayed for only eight months, a tranquil interlude he enjoyed, then in June 1874 was called home on leave and never returned.<br>
<br>In 1874 Hennessy's patron Disraeli again became prime minister, and in 1875 Hennessy was promoted to the governorship (salary &pound;4000) of the Windward Islands, with his capital in Barbados, where he arrived on 1 November. The Colonial Office favoured federation of the Windward Islands, and this Hennessy tried to implement. Always more sympathetic to criminals than to their victims, he released convicts and abolished flogging. He encouraged emigration to other West Indian islands. In Barbados the planters still dominated the assembly, and they opposed federation. Some formed the Barbados Defence Association and, with their allies in London, pressed for Hennessy's recall. At Easter (April) 1876 labourers, their hopes raised by Hennessy, rioted (the federation riots). Hennessy suppressed them. In May the assembly voted for his recall. The imperial government defended him, but in November moved him to Hong Kong.<br>
<br>Appointed governor of Hong Kong in November 1876, Hennessy arrived there in April 1877. The traveller Isabella Bird (Mrs Bishop) described him as &#145;a little man much overdressed in white kid gloves and patent leather boots with a mouth which smiles perpetually and sinister eyes which never smile&#146;  (Pope-Hennessy, 188). An inefficient administrator, he favoured the Chinese and in 1880 appointed the first Chinese member of the legislative council, and increased the revenue from opium. British residents criticized his &#145;Chinomania&#146; and &#145;native race craze&#146;  (Lowe and McLaughlin, 228). Prejudiced against the protestant Scots and English there, he promoted his Catholic favourites. He quarrelled with the merchants, the military commander, and the governor of Macau, and was censured by the Colonial Office. In 1878 an official told the new colonial secretary, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, that Hennessy &#145;cannot ever gain the confidence of those over whom he is placed&#146;  (Pope-Hennessy, 195). Despite a disastrous fire and demands from the residents, he failed to establish an effective fire service. He again freed convicts. His pro-criminal sympathies and failure to act effectively against increased violent crime alienated the British population, who called for his dismissal and boycotted Government House. Nevertheless in April 1880 the outgoing Conservative government, to his delight, made him a KCMG. Finally, following a scandal&#151;in April 1881 Hennessy publicly assaulted with an umbrella a former favourite, Thomas Child Hayllar QC, member of the legislative council, apparently because of Hayllar's relationship with Hennessy's wife&#151;Hennessy was removed from Hong Kong. He left in March 1882 ostensibly on leave. When it was rumoured that he might return, the leading British merchants sent &#145;the strongest remonstrances&#146;  (Eitel, 567) to the British government.<br>
<br>In December 1882 Hennessy was appointed governor of Mauritius, and he arrived on 1 June 1883. He favoured the Francophone Creoles&#151;who demanded &#145;Mauritius for the Mauritians&#146;&#151;and Indian immigrants, openly and extravagantly condemned British rule, and quarrelled with Charles Dalton Clifford Lloyd, the lieutenant-governor, and other British officials. In September 1886 a royal commission was issued to Sir Hercules Robinson, governor of Cape Colony and high commissioner in South Africa, to inquire into Hennessy's administration: an unprecedented situation. The subjects for special inquiry were Hennessy's relations with Lloyd, pro-Creole partisanship, financial maladministration, &#145;persecution&#146; of English officials, and pro-criminal bias. Robinson arrived in early November 1886, and on 16 December suspended Hennessy. In January 1887 the colonial secretary, Sir Henry Thurstan Holland (from 1888 Lord Knutsford), ordered Hennessy back to England. In July, Holland decided, after a long inquiry, that sufficient cause had not been shown for Hennessy's removal, though he had been guilty of &#145;want of temper and judgment&#146;, &#145;vexatious and unjustifiable interference&#146; with the magistrates, and undue partisanship. Accordingly he returned to Mauritius and served out his time, retiring on a pension in December 1889.<br>
<br>When Hennessy left Mauritius he was suffering from tropical anaemia, and Holland had made it clear that he would be offered no further governorship. He had become a governor only by default, and returned to his true m&eacute;tier of politician. He hoped Gladstone would later make him a peer, and in 1890 bought a large house, Rostellan Castle, near Cork. In December 1890 he contested the by-election at North Kilkenny&#151;described by <span class="italic">The Times</span> as a &#145;priest-ridden agricultural constituency&#146;  (Callanan, 69) as anti-Parnellite home rule candidate. Tim Healy and Michael Davitt organized the anti-Parnellite campaign, Parnell campaigned for Vincent Scully, Fenians supported Parnell, and Catholic clergy and farmers opposed him. The contest was bitter and violent. Hennessy, who campaigned despite the winter cold, was apparently almost incidental: the election was fought for and against Parnell. Hennessy was elected by a majority of 1165: a disaster for Parnell, shattering his mystique of electoral invincibility.<br>
<br>Hennessy died of heart failure on 7 October 1891 at his residence, Rostellan Castle, near Cork, and was buried in his father's grave, with no separate headstone or monument, in Cork city cemetery. A statue by M. Loumeau (1908) was erected in Port Louis, Mauritius. Hennessy's widow in 1894 married a much younger man, Edward Francis Thackwell JP (<i>b</i>. 1868, only son of Major-General W. de W. R. Thackwell of Aghada Hall, co. Cork). She was superstitious and a spiritualist and, following supposed messages through a ouija board, she sold Hennessy's books and destroyed most of his private papers. His grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31560/', "(Richard) James Arthur Pope-Hennessy (1916&#150;1974)")</script> wrote a sympathetic but not entirely accurate or impartial biography of Hennessy, <span class="italic">Verandah: some Episodes in the Crown Colonies, 1867&#150;1889</span> (1964).<br>
<br>Hennessy was controversial and, according to his biographer, &#145;essentially a man who produced the most violent reactions in all those with whom he came in contact&#146;  (Pope-Hennessy, 23). To his admirers he was the champion of the underdog and of racial equality. Others saw him as prejudiced, perverse, deceitful, arrogant, autocratic, and quarrelsome. Ernst Johann Eitel, his private secretary in Hong Kong, wrote that &#145;the centre of his world was he himself&#146;  (Eitel, 573). <span class="italic">The Times</span> obituary stated: &#145;he ought never have been placed in charge of such colonies&#146;  (Pope-Hennessy, 22). More recently Frank Welsh has written that he had &#145;an almost complete lack of common sense, method, reliability, tact or management skills&#146;  (Welsh, 255), and H. J. Lethbridge that he &#145;would have been analysed by Adler as suffering from an inferiority complex, as someone who &#147;overcompensated&#148; for physical miniaturization &hellip; an egomaniac who imposed his will regardless&#146;  (Eitel, vii). As C. A. Harris wrote: &#145;he never acquired the habit of making definite and accurate statements&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
