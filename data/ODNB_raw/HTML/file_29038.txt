<span class="headword">Wemyss,  James, of Caskieberran</span>  (<em>c.</em>1610&#150;1667), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the son of James Wemyss, laird of Caskieberran, Fife, and his wife, Janet Durie, lady of Cardan in the parish of Auchterderran, Fife. He moved to London in the winter of 1629&#150;30 with his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63436/', "Colonel Robert Scott (d. 1631)")</script>, probably receiving a grant of denization at the same time as his uncle's family. Scott, while in Swedish and Danish service, had developed a type of leather-covered cannon or leather gun, and Wemyss, who may also have served in the army of Gustavus Adolphus, an innovator in field artillery, was to refine his uncle's invention and more generally devote himself to gunnery and associated skills.<br>
<br>At some point Wemyss married Katherine, widow of John Guilliams and daughter of Thomas Rayment, poulterer of St Botolph without Bishopsgate, with whom he had his son and heir, James, and other children, before her death in February 1649. On 26 February 1634 Charles I granted a warrant to the lieutenant-general of the ordnance, Sir John Heydon, &#145;for carrying such quantity of earth to Mr Wemyss's garden at Foxhall [Vauxhall] as should suffice for making a butt to prove ordnance at&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Three years later Wemyss's house was burnt down, leading to the loss of his scientific instruments and tools he had personally purchased to further his inventions. In the pursuit of his knowledge Wemyss had amassed debts of &pound;2000 by 1637. The king, who had supported Wemyss for seven years, appears to have relieved him from his most pressing debts, and in 1638 made him master-gunner of England. &#145;Weemes, a Scotchman&#146;, Clarendon later sourly noted, &#145;had been as much obliged by the King as a man of his condition could be, and in a manner very unpopular&#146;. His appointment as master-gunner, with &#145;a pension of three hundred pounds <i>per annum</i> for his life, &hellip; was looked upon as some disrespect to the English nation&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.367).<br>
<br>In the middle of 1638 Wemyss gained a contract to hire a ship and load it with light guns and powder to reinforce the royal garrison at Dumbarton Castle. On 12 February 1639, when the king was preparing militarily to suppress the Scottish covenanters, Wemyss explained to the king that England lacked gunners who understood the ranges of ordnance or the use of mortars. Wemyss accompanied the train of artillery which followed the royal army to Berwick in the summer of 1639. He also served with the army raised in 1640 to oppose the covenanters.<br>
<br>The failure of the royal armies to defeat the parliamentarians, and the Scottish decision to ally with the latter, persuaded Wemyss to transfer his services to the English parliament (or as Clarendon glossed the defection, &#145;having never done the King the least service, he took the first opportunity to disserve him&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.367&#150;8). Wemyss was appointed master of the ordnance to Sir William Waller. When Wemyss left London for Waller's army on 5 December 1643 his artillery train included the leather guns which he had developed from his uncle's invention: &#145;leatherne Musquets shooting bullets of one lb weight&#146;  (Sheffield University Library, Hartlib MSS, Ephermerides, 1643: 30/4/86a&#150;93b). &#145;These leather pieces&#146;, a newsletter observed, predicting their value to Sir William's army, &#145;are of very great use, and very easie and light of carriage. One horse may draw a piece, which will carry a bullet of a pound and a halfe weight, and do execution very farre&#146;  (<span class="italic">The True Informer</span>, 9 Dec 1643). In the event the royalist forces at the battle of Cropredy Bridge on 29 June 1644 captured both Wemyss and his eleven cannon, &#145;with two barricadoes of wood, which were drawn upon wheels, and in each seven small brass and leather guns, charged with case-shot&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.367). The leather guns at the time had a higher reputation than they generally have had since, and one royalist later claimed that the pieces captured at Cropredy &#145;proved very serviceable to the king&#146;  (J. Gwynne, <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Great Civil War</span>, 1822, 42). Nevertheless they seem to have had a relatively slight impact in the English context, one reason for which is probably the prolonged imprisonment of the inventor.<br>
<br>The earl of Essex, Sir John Meldrum, Sir William Waller, and Sir Arthur Hesilrige made every effort to have Wemyss (whom Clarendon called &#145;a confessed good soldier&#146;) exchanged, but he remained a prisoner for many months  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 5.489). The king told Wemyss that the post of master-gunner remained vacant, and offered to reinstate him. By 12 June 1645 Wemyss had regained his freedom. Now an officer in the earl of Leven's Scottish army, he proved the ordnance and gunpowder for the English parliamentarian navy, and fitted out three new frigates with 100 pieces of cannon in 1646, for which he received &pound;50. In March 1648 the navy commissioners awarded him the same sum for similar work done in the summer of 1647.<br>
<br>In March 1648 Wemyss returned to Scotland. On 27 March the Scottish parliament passed an act &#145;granting to Colonel James Wemyss the privilege of making leather ordnance for three terms of nineteen years, with power to enforce secresy&#146;  (<span class="italic">APS</span>, 6/2, 18&#150;19). As an adherent of the anti-republican kirk party regime, Wemyss lost his post of master-gunner of England to Richard Wollaston after 5 February 1649.<br>
<br>On 10 July 1649 the Scottish parliament appointed Wemyss general of artillery and engineering, and master of the ordnance of Scotland, replacing the senile engager Alexander &#145;Dear Sandy&#146; Hamilton. Wemyss's pay was fixed at 600 Scots merks monthly. In July 1650 he received command of a regiment of foot. He fought at the battle of Dunbar (3 September 1650), but escaped the debacle that overtook most of the infantry. After the defeat he scoured Scotland for artillery, and produced a train of 29 field and 42 leather pieces for the Worcester campaign of August&#150;September 1651. Wemyss fell prisoner at the battle of Worcester on 3 September. He was confined at Windsor Castle, and was bound over in &pound;2000 in order to attend to private business in London for a few days in the summer of 1652. Early in 1654 he was permitted six months' leave for his health in Scotland. In May 1658 he petitioned the lord protector for an act to enable &#145;him to provide a place to erect his works for the making and practising certain inventions of light ordnance and engines of war, the fruits of his study and labour for thirty years&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1658&#150;9</i>, 35&#150;7). The petition included a list of his scientific inventions for naval and military gunnery, which allowed Britain to make considerable advances in ordnance. The dislocation of governmental functions following Cromwell's death delayed matters, but in 1660 Charles II granted a patent<blockquote>to James Wemyss, senior, and James Wemyss, junior, of the invention of the former for making light ordnance, and of a way whereby all motions caused by the force of a river, wind, or horses may be done by one or two men, and may be useful for lifting of weights, draining of mines, &amp;c. (<span class="italic">DNB</span>)</blockquote>Charles II restored Wemyss to the post of master-gunner of England and general of artillery in Scotland in 1660. On 1 March 1661 the Scottish parliament renewed his monopoly of leather ordnance for fifty-seven years. That April he received a Scottish monopoly of mine draining equipment. In 1663 Wemyss received a royal patent for light ordnance. Owing to the cost of maintaining the affairs of these offices Wemyss resigned from them in 1666, and retired to Scotland on the king's permission. He received a payment for resigning the English position to Captain Valentine Pyne. Wemyss died in December 1667.<br>
<br>Wemyss's son James inherited the estate of Caskieberran. On 15 April 1672 he was created Baron Burntisland for life, following his marriage on 25 December 1671 to Margaret Wemyss (1659&#150;1705), countess of Wemyss in her own right. At his death in December 1682 he left a son David, who succeeded his mother as fourth earl of Wemyss.<br>
