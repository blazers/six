<span class="headword">Lake,  William Charles</span>  (1817&#150;1897), <span class="occ">dean of Durham</span>, was born in London on 9 January 1817, the eldest son of Captain Charles Lake, an officer in the Scots Fusilier Guards who was wounded at Waterloo and thereafter lived in retirement, and his wife, Anna Louisa, youngest daughter of Henry Halsey of Henley Park, Surrey. Some of his childhood was spent in France and the Channel Islands before the family settled in Rugby, where he attended Rugby School as a day boy under Dr Wooll and Dr Arnold. He became head of the school and formed close friendships with A. P. Stanley and C. J. Vaughan. In 1834 he won a scholarship at Balliol College, Oxford, and in 1838 gained first-class honours in the classical school. He was a friend of A. C. Tait, with whom he travelled to the continent in vacations, a member of the celebrated debating society, the Decade, and president of the Oxford Union Society in 1838. As an undergraduate he came under the influence of Newman, and his election to a Balliol fellowship in 1838 with membership of the common room brought him into frequent contact with W. G. Ward. Ordained in 1842, and in the same year appointed a tutor of Balliol (where his nicknames Serpent, Puddle, and Piddle suggested a degree of unpopularity with the undergraduates), he was one of the liberals who opposed the measures taken against the Tractarian leaders by the university's hebdomadal board. Illness caused his absence from Oxford between 1845 and 1847.<br>
<br>On his return to Oxford, Lake played a prominent part in university reform. He gave evidence to the royal commission (1850), was senior proctor in 1852, and took a leading part in the Oxford Tutors' Association, which promoted the moderate settlement, protecting collegiate and clerical interests, carried through by W. E. Gladstone in 1854. His most significant achievement was in organizing the introduction of modern history into the undergraduate curriculum, serving as examiner in the first examinations in law and modern history in 1853 and 1854. His association with modern studies and knowledge of European languages led to his appointment in 1855 as an examiner of candidates for army commissions and, in 1856, as a member of the War Office commission set up following the reverses in the Crimean War to investigate the training of army officers. After visiting military academies on the continent, Lake and his colleagues recommended the establishment of a staff college in Britain. He was also an academic representative, with H. M. Butler, on the royal commission on military education (1868&#150;70). In June 1858 he was appointed a member of the royal commission chaired by the duke of Newcastle to investigate elementary education in England. Its report (1861) foreshadowed the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1870.<br>
<br>In October 1858, to the surprise of his friends, Lake turned his back on academic life and accepted the Balliol College living of Huntspill in Somerset, becoming a canon of Wells in 1860. He had been an unsuccessful candidate for the vacant chair of ecclesiastical history at Oxford in 1856, and he felt a growing estrangement from the direction of Oxford liberalism, believing that the theology of Jowett and Stanley was encouraging doubt and unbelief. For this reason he disliked <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span>, though he publicly defended Frederick Temple, one of the contributors, in 1869. He remained a Liberal in politics and one of the high-church adherents of Gladstone, who on 9 August 1869 nominated him to the deanery of Durham, which carried with it the wardenship of Durham University. Gladstone urged him to infuse life into the moribund university, whose student numbers had fallen below fifty. Lake rejected the idea of making Durham a miniature Oxford, but instead concentrated on its development as a leading school of theology, while the needs of higher scientific and technical education in the north-east were served by the foundation, in 1871, of the Durham College of Science at Newcastle. During his wardenship the Durham College of Medicine was also incorporated into the university.<br>
<br>As dean of the cathedral Lake had to overcome the conservatism of the canons, and relations were not always harmonious. He lacked a winning manner&#151;an archdeacon described him as &#145;imperious&#146;, &#145;impetuous&#146;, and &#145;impertinent&#146;  (Barrett, 48)&#151;and he was obliged to rely on a legal opinion to affirm his authority over cathedral services, which shocked him on his arrival by their lack of decorum. He succeeded in imposing order and reverence, restored the eucharist to a high place, and, in the face of determined opposition from C. T. Baring, the bishop of Durham, oversaw the restoration of the cathedral interior, carried out by Gilbert Scott (1876).<br>
<br>On 2 June 1881 Lake married Katherine, daughter of John Neilson Gladstone, brother of the prime minister. In collaboration with R. W. Church and H. P. Liddon he used his influence with his old college friend Archbishop Tait to dissuade him from taking extreme measures against ritualist clergymen under the <span class="roman">Public Worship Regulation Act</span>, and he supported those clergy who were imprisoned under the act. He was a member of the ecclesiastical courts commission (1881&#150;3). A vice-president of the English Church Union and a governor of Pusey House, Oxford, he opposed attempts to encourage secessions from the Roman Catholic churches on the continent, protesting in 1888 against the Anglican mission to convert Italy. Latterly he broke with Gladstonian Liberalism as he opposed Irish home rule. He resigned the deanery on 2 November 1894, owing to failing health. Lake went to live at Kanescombe in Torquay, where he died on 8 December 1897. He was survived by his wife.<br>
