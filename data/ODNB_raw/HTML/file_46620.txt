<span class="headword">Belling,  Charles Reginald</span>  (1884&#150;1965), <span class="occ">electrical engineer and manufacturer</span>, was born on 11 May 1884 at Fore Street, Bodmin, Cornwall, the son of Samuel Thomas Belling, a dentist, and his wife, Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harry. Charles Belling, known to all as C. R. B., was educated at Burts Grammar School, Lostwithiel, and at Crossley School, Halifax. He attended technical college at Derby and Chelmsford. From 1903 to 1906 he was apprenticed to Crompton &amp; Co. Ltd, of Chelmsford, remaining on their staff until 1909, when he joined Ediswan Electric Company Ltd, of Ponders End, Middlesex, to supervise the production of arc lamps, auto-transformers, and Bastian electric heaters. By 1912 Belling felt he had enough experience to set up on his own as a manufacturer of electric heaters. With just &pound;150 of his own capital and &pound;300 from two colleagues, Belling took on a local boy and a fitter from Ediswans and began equipping a small shed in Lancaster Road, Enfield, ready to begin work on a firebar that would revolutionize electric fire design. Rather than adapt the workings of the Bastian heater, which consisted of a resistance spiral inside a quartz tube, Belling hit on the idea of winding a resistance wire on the front face of a strip of fireclay, which would allow the wire to work at high temperatures and the heat to be thrown forwards. On the back of this success, Belling began to develop a new electric geyser which could deliver instant boiling water at a rate of 3 pints a minute. He clearly anticipated the declining need for coal in the home, and with full order books, a move to larger premises was now essential. During the summer of 1913, just one year after taking the plunge, Belling moved to Derby Road, Edmonton, and set about producing his second brochure devoted exclusively to a range of about a dozen fires.<br>
<br>Profits from Belling's first balance sheet of &pound;3500 on sales of &pound;11,000 must have come to the attention of the Admiralty, for, when war was declared and Lloyd George announced that it was &#145;business as usual&#146;, Belling was called on to switch production to heating and cooking equipment for submarines as well as supplying ovens for canteens. The war not only provided Belling with increased turnover and profits, but also offered the opportunity to buy out his two partners, who were no longer able to commit themselves to the firm. This freed Belling to oversee a period of expansion and diversification that continued virtually unchecked until 1939. The inter-war years saw the company establish itself as one of the leading suppliers of electrical appliances to the British domestic market. The year 1919 saw the introduction of the first modern cooker&#151;the Modernette&#151;followed by the first imitation coal fire and the forerunner of a range of Baby Belling cookers that were to grace countless bedsits over the following decades. By 1924, soaring sales persuaded Belling to buy a 10 acre site at Enfield, and in 1935 he formed the private limited company of Belling &amp; Co. Ltd, because he had &#145;got a bit sick of paying super tax on works extensions, etc.&#146; On the eve of war, the Enfield site accommodated 500 workers engaged in producing cookers and 50,000 fire units a year.<br>
<br>The Second World War again saw Belling &amp; Co. shift production to wartime requirements. Flexibility and innovation allowed emphasis to be placed on the manufacture of hand and rifle grenades, trench mortar sights, and fuel jettison tanks. This ability to confront new challenges stood the company in good stead in the boom years following the war as the high price of competitive fuels and the <span class="roman">Clean Air Act</span> saw the swing towards electricity gain momentum.<br>
<br>Belling married, on 19 March 1946, Cicely Edith (<i>b</i>. 1906), daughter of William Ernest Williams, a railway goods manager. There were no children. By 1955, Belling again found he was short on factory space and he decided to buy a new 30 acre site at Burnley and to move all fire production there, leaving the Enfield works free to concentrate on the production of all types of cookers. By the time of Belling's death in 1965, the company owned 70 acres of freehold property and over 1 million square feet of production space, and had some 3500 workers on its payroll. Belling was immensely proud that he had built up the business entirely out of profits, and that the firm was able to remain a private company. In spite of insisting that all employees had the right to decide whether or not to become a member of a trade union, relations with the thirteen unions represented in the two factories were generally cordial. This is partly explained by the pension fund and profit-sharing schemes Belling had introduced, which were a major factor in securing the loyalty of the workforce. The royal warrant received by the company in 1962 (its golden jubilee year) was for Belling the highest seal of approval anyone could bestow.<br>
<br>Yet, in spite of buoyant sales, Belling remained acutely aware of the shortage of qualified technical staff who had the capability of converting original ideas into practical applications. He had long pioneered the idea of technical training colleges, a move designed primarily to prevent other countries &#145;exploiting our brains&#146;. In his will, Belling set aside &pound;1 million for a technical school to be built on the 60 acres lying to the side of Owls Hall Farm, his home in Enfield, in the hope of bridging the deep divide between pure research and its shop floor application. That said, Belling's autocratic style and his propensity to promote from within ultimately stifled the company's chances of further development after his death.<br>
<br>Charles Belling died on board the <i>Empress of England</i> on 8 February 1965 while cruising in the Bahamas. He left the bulk of his estate, worth over &pound;2.5 million, to his wife. His cousin, Richard Eric Belling, who had been groomed as the future director of the company, was the other main beneficiary.<br>
