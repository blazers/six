<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lamb,  Mary Anne</span>  (1764&#150;1847), <span class="occ">children's writer</span>, was born on 3 December 1764 in the Inner Temple, London, the second of the three surviving of the seven children of John Lamb (<i>c</i>.1725&#150;1799), waiter at the Inner Temple, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1796), daughter of Mary Field, housekeeper at Blakesware House in Hertfordshire. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15912/', "Charles Lamb (1775&#150;1834)")</script> was the third surviving child. In contrast to her two brothers, John and Charles, both educated at Christ's Hospital, Mary received little formal schooling, apart from a few years at a local day school. Apprenticed to a needlewoman, she was soon contributing to the family income as a mantua maker.<br>
<br>A voracious reader throughout life&#151;a habit developed in childhood when she was granted free range of the library of her father's employer, Samuel Salt, a bencher of the Inner Temple&#151;Mary Lamb also taught herself Latin, French, and Italian in her later years. After Salt's death in 1792 her parents were obliged to quit the Temple, and moved with their two younger children, Mary and Charles, to cramped and impoverished lodgings in 7 Little Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields. It was there, on 22 September 1796, that Mary Lamb, in a sudden and violent fit of insanity, killed her mother with a knife stab to the heart; the accumulated strain of nursing a senile father and a bedridden mother, while also maintaining the family through her needlework, had exacerbated a psychological disorder subsequently categorized by her brother's twentieth-century biographers as a manic-depressive illness. In 1796 the law allowed violent lunatics to be released into the care of their relatives, if sufficient surety was given that they would be cared for as potentially dangerous for the rest of their lives. This surety her brother Charles gave, thus saving his sister from incarceration in Bethlem Hospital; he acted against the wishes of the remaining members of the family. Subsequently Mary and Charles lived together until Charles's death in 1834; neither ever married, and their &#145;double singleness&#146;, as Charles described it, was interrupted only by Mary's periodic illnesses, which often necessitated her removal to private madhouses. But both made great efforts to maintain a cheerful and convivial domestic life, and in 1823 they adopted and successfully reared Emma Isola, an orphan of Italian extraction, who later married Charles Lamb's publisher, Edward Moxon.<br>
<br>In the winter of 1805&#150;6, Mary Lamb was commissioned by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67901/', "Mary Jane Godwin")</script> (the second wife of William Godwin), who had established a publishing venture concentrating on material for children, to write a prose version of Shakespeare's plays. When <span class="italic">Tales from Shakespear, Designed for the Use of Young Persons</span> was published in 1807, however, it appeared under Charles Lamb's name; not merely the gender prejudices of the period but more significantly, perhaps, her history, and the manner of her mother's death, probably left his sister disinclined to draw any public attention to herself. Charles had also contributed to the volume, writing its versions of the tragedies. They subsequently prepared together two further volumes for Mrs Godwin's <span class="roman">Juvenile Library</span>, <span class="italic">Mrs Leicester's School, or, The History of Several Young Ladies, Related by themselves</span> and <span class="italic">Poetry for Children, Entirely Original</span>, both of which were published anonymously in 1809. In each case, as with <span class="italic">Tales from Shakespear</span>, about two-thirds of the texts were Mary's work. Her books for children are marked by an unpretentious lucidity of style, and a capacity to enter into the point of view of her readers, also evident in her letters and in the one piece of writing for adults she published, the essay &#145;On needle-work&#146; contributed to the <span class="italic">British Lady's Magazine and Monthly Miscellany</span> (1 April 1815). In this essay, and in <span class="italic">Mrs Leicester's School</span>, she shows a particular concern for the well-being of disadvantaged women and girls. Her remonstrations on such issues as the lack of remunerative female employment, and the vulnerability of young women to social and parental pressures, show her attempting to spare others through her writing stresses she had herself experienced; some of her stories in <span class="italic">Mrs Leicester's School</span> clearly have an autobiographical content. Mary Lamb outlived her brother by a number of years, her last decades darkened by increasingly lengthy periods of insanity; she died at her home, 40 Alpha Road, in St John's Wood, London, on 20 May 1847, and was buried on 28 May in Charles Lamb's grave in Edmonton churchyard, Middlesex.<br>
