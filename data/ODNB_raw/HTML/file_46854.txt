<span class="headword">Critchley,  Alfred Cecil</span>  (1890&#150;1963), <span class="occ">greyhound racing promoter and aviation administrator</span>, was born at Stapleton ranch, near Calgary, Alberta, Canada, the first of the two sons of Oswald Assheton Critchley (<i>d</i>. 1935), ranch owner, and his first wife, Maria Cecil, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Newbolt (<i>d</i>. 1891). Following his early boyhood in Canada, Critchley was privately educated at St Bees Boys' School in Cumberland. In 1908 Critchley was commissioned into Lord Strathcona's Horse, after training at the Royal Military College at Kingston, Ontario. He served on the western front from 1914 with the 7th Canadian infantry brigade. Wounded at Ypres in 1916 while acting brigade major, Critchley was subsequently awarded the DSO. On his return to active service he was put in charge of basic training for new Canadian troops. He undertook this role so successfully that in February 1918 he was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps to undertake a similar training role.<br>
<br>By the end of the war Critchley had the rank of brigadier-general, but then left the army. He spent the years from 1919 to 1923 in South America, involved in a number of commercial activities: in his memoirs he described how he unsuccessfully prospected for oil in Mexico, and was almost kidnapped by the bandit Pancho Villa in 1920. Returning to England in 1922, he and his friend Henry Horne were convinced of the investment potential of the cement industry, and borrowed &pound;300,000 from the Guaranty Trust to begin Associated and British Portland Cement Manufactures, which soon amalgamated almost sixty companies. Critchley and Horne held 600,000 shares between them, and through the directors they nominated to the board played an important role in the affairs of the cement giant. Critchley later claimed to be responsible for first suggesting that a blue circle should be put around all the company's products for advertising purposes, and as a seal of quality. &#145;Blue Circle&#146; was subsequently adopted as the company's name.<br>
<br>In 1926 Critchley actively helped defeat the general strike by co-ordinating the distribution of Winston Churchill's <span class="italic">British Gazette</span>. Critchley later claimed credit for the effective circulation of the <span class="italic">Gazette</span>, which grew from 232,000 on 5 May to over 2,200,000 by 12 May. The same year also saw the introduction of the electric hare into Britain, thanks to the efforts of Critchley and his business associates who grouped together to form the Greyhound Racing Association Limited (GRA). They built the first electric greyhound stadium in Britain at Belle Vue, Manchester, and the GRA's operations soon expanded to White City in London, and to other tracks in Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool, and London. Although the new sport was greeted with popular enthusiasm, Critchley had to contend with disapproval, if not hostility, from the middle and upper classes, and in order to obviate the latter he shrewdly &#145;gathered round him figures of standing in other spheres of sport&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 Feb 1963). Much of the later integrity of the sport's controlling body, the National Greyhound Racing Society of Great Britain, &#145;owes much to his early influence&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Critchley attempted a political career, and stood unsuccessfully as a Conservative candidate at Gorton, Manchester, in 1929. In 1930, he unsuccessfully contested the Islington by-election for Max Aitken's United Empire Party. In a 1934 by-election, however, he was elected as the Conservative MP for Twickenham. However, &#145;his explosive manner in debate did not make him a good parliamentarian&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 Feb 1963). He did not stand as a candidate in the 1935 general election, instead choosing to concentrate on the business of cement and dogs.<br>
<br>Between 1939 and 1943 Critchley resumed his role as trainer of air crew for the RAF with the rank of air commodore. He was again very effective in this role: many of his staff were sporting personalities, and he created training centres at empty seaside resorts. In 1943, having built up an adequate reserve of trained men, he was appointed director-general of the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) at the suggestion of Lord Beaverbrook. His dynamic energy soon made itself felt: while commuting to London from his home at Sunningdale, Berkshire, he had the idea of converting thousands of acres of flat land near Staines into a major airport for London which he intended to name &#145;Churchill Field&#146;. Labour members of the national government objected to this, but he was given clearance for his project, and by mid-1944 the national press was excited about the now public plans for a London airport.<br>
<br>By early 1946 the new London airport was established at what subsequently became better known as Heathrow, and the corporation had also become profitable. However, it was clear that the Labour government was determined to split BOAC into a number of nationalized corporations. This prompted Critchley's resignation in January 1946. He then moved back into the commercial sector and established a private airline, Skyways, with Captain Ronald Ashley. They bought a number of York aircraft from A. V. Roe, and operated scheduled services to Asia and Africa, but the business did not prove to be long-lasting. Critchley later blamed the restrictive effect of the civil aviation legislation of the 1940s, arguing that it was intended to crush private enterprise by removing licences, and thus profitable routes, from private operators. &#145;The death of Skyways&#146;, he wrote, was due to &#145;nothing else but socialist dogma practised by the Labour Government. All that is left is the glory of the pioneering work we did&#146;  (<span class="italic">Critch!</span>, 234).<br>
<br>Critchley married three times. His first wife, whom he married on 19 January 1916, was Maryon, daughter of John Galt, president of the Union Bank of Canada; they had a daughter and a son (killed on active service in Libya in 1941). On 22 December 1927 he married Joan Kathleen Welsh Lee, daughter of Mrs Reginald Foster, and this marriage produced a further son and daughter. Critchley married his third wife, Diana Fishwick, in 1938; with her he had another son and daughter. A celebrated golfer, Critchley won a number of amateur championships, including the French (1933) and the Belgian (1938). His third wife, Diana, was also his golfing partner, and they jointly won a number of contests. One of Critchley's other passions was hunting chamois in the Austrian Alps.<br>
<br>In April 1953 Critchley went blind, a tragedy against which he fought bravely. He maintained his roles as a director of the Greyhound Racing Association, and of Associated Portland Cement. He became president of the British Golf Foundation in 1953, and was captain of Wentworth Golf Club from 1953 to 1956.<br>
<br>Critchley died aged seventy-three on 9 February 1963, at Cherry Garth, Firwood Road, Wentworth, Surrey, of a cerebral thrombosis and of arteriosclerosis; his third wife survived him. A well-attended memorial service was held for him at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 21 February 1963.<br>
