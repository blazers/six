<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sophia Dorothea</span> <span class="st"> [Princess Sophia Dorothea of Celle]</span>  (1666&#150;1726), <span class="occ">electoral princess of Hanover</span>, was born in the castle of Celle, Germany, on 15 September 1666 <span class="smallcap">OS</span>, the eldest child of Georg Wilhelm, duke of Brunswick-L&uuml;neburg (1624&#150;1705), ruler of the Celle portion of the duchy from 1665, and El&eacute;onore Desmier d'Olbreuse (1639&#150;1722), an exiled French protestant aristocrat. At the time of Sophia Dorothea's birth her mother and father were of unequal status; their legal union in 1665 was less than a marriage, consisting of a promise by Georg Wilhelm never to leave El&eacute;onore and not to marry anyone else. None the less, Georg Wilhelm and El&eacute;onore continually worked to regularize their union. Sophia, the only surviving child, gradually transformed from an illegitimate daughter into an eligible heiress. In 1674 her mother became a reigning princess as countess of Wilhelmsburg. On 2 April 1676 Georg Wilhelm and El&eacute;onore were formally married; as part of the marriage settlement Sophia Dorothea was fully legitimized as a Brunswick-L&uuml;neburg princess.<br>
<br>Georg Wilhelm fielded several proposals for his daughter's hand. Sophia Dorothea was at first engaged to Friedrich August, son of Anton Ulrich, duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb&uuml;ttel, but the young prince was killed in battle in 1676. In the succeeding years Georg Wilhelm negotiated with his brother Duke Ernst August, reigning at Hanover from 1679, on behalf of his eldest son Georg Ludwig (1660&#150;1727), later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10538/', "George I of Great Britain")</script>. The marriage of Sophia Dorothea to Georg Ludwig was designed to secure the succession of Ernst August and his heirs to Celle. The union of Celle and Hanover was a vital part of Ernst August's scheme to become an imperial elector. The marriage took place in Celle on 22 November 1682.<br>
<br>The couple formally resided together in Hanover but Georg Ludwig was frequently away on military campaigns. Many of Sophia Dorothea's biographers have seen the contrast between her arranged marriage to Georg Ludwig and the love match of her parents as the root of her later disaffection. Despite the long absences of her husband, the couple had two children, Georg August (later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10539/', "George II of Great Britain")</script>) and Sophia Dorothea, subsequently queen of Prussia to Frederick William I and mother of Frederick the Great.<br>
<br>Sophia Dorothea was introduced to Philipp Christoph, Count von K&ouml;nigsmark (1665&#150;1694), during 1689 soon after he had been granted a commission by Ernst August. The count was from a distinguished Swedish military family and has been contrasted as &#145;ardent&#146; and &#145;poetic&#146; alongside the &#145;matter-of-fact&#146; Georg Ludwig  (Hatton, 54&#150;5). The two began corresponding in July 1690 and were lovers by early 1692.<br>
<br>The relationship alarmed the Hanoverian court because of the couple's lack of discretion. They ignored warnings and began to prepare for an independent life away from Hanover. Sophia Dorothea agitated for control over some of her inheritance, signed away by her father in her marriage contract, while in June 1694 K&ouml;nigsmark accepted a commission from his friend Friedrich August I of Saxony. He returned to Hanover to wind up his affairs, but disappeared on 1 July 1694 after leaving for the Leine Palace to visit Sophia Dorothea.<br>
<br>The disappearance of K&ouml;nigsmark was never satisfactorily explained. Georg Schnath, based on a study of circumstantial evidence, suggested that K&ouml;nigsmark was mortally wounded soon after entering the palace, probably on the orders of Ernst August's mistress Clara von Platen. K&ouml;nigsmark's house was searched and his papers seized. Sophia Dorothea was placed under guard but proved eager to accept the divorce arranged by Ernst August and Georg Wilhelm and consented to be named the guilty party without admitting to her adultery. The consistorial court of Hanover pronounced the divorce on 28 December 1694 and Sophia Dorothea was forbidden to remarry.<br>
<br>Sophia Dorothea remained a political liability. As she could not be allowed to seek help from the emperor or from Saxony should she wish to revise the divorce settlement, Georg Wilhelm and Ernst August agreed to confine her at the manor house of Ahlden in the territory of Celle, built in 1613 as a magistrate's residence. The &#145;castle&#146; was fortified, supposedly for Sophia Dorothea's own protection, and she was guarded by a marshal and forty infantry and cavalry. On 28 February 1695 Sophia Dorothea arrived at Ahlden, where she was to be imprisoned, with a brief interlude, for the rest of her life. She was allocated the title duchess&#151;or princess&#151;of Ahlden. Her mother was the only visitor from her old life permitted to see her, and correspondence with her children was forbidden.<br>
<br>The duchess of Celle sought to improve Sophia Dorothea's condition but her efforts&#151;which included negotiations with both Louis XIV and William III&#151;came to nothing. From April to September 1700 Georg Ludwig (who had succeeded his father in 1698) allowed Sophia Dorothea to live at Celle in the face of a French invasion of the Brunswick duchies. Once the threat subsided Georg Wilhelm, who had refused to see his daughter, sent her back to Ahlden.<br>
<br>Sophia Dorothea had been marginalized to reduce any damage she might do to the dynastic fortunes of the house of Brunswick. At the time of her divorce it was feared that any action she took against the family would jeopardize both recognition of the Hanoverian electorate and acceptance of the Electress Sophia as heiress presumptive to Great Britain. The danger did not abate once the <span class="roman">Act of Settlement</span> had been passed as it was conceivable that Sophia Dorothea would use any freedom she was granted to attack her husband's character and so help the Jacobite cause. Conscious that his divorce was a political and religious embarrassment in Great Britain, Georg Ludwig never explained the absence of his wife to British visitors. However, the story of Sophia Dorothea's relationship with K&ouml;nigsmark and her imprisonment at Ahlden circulated widely, most sensationally through the sixth volume of Duke Anton Ulrich's epic <i>roman-&agrave;-clef</i> the <span class="italic">Roman Octavia</span> (1708), which emphasized the brutality of Georg Ludwig and the virtue of Sophia Dorothea. Opponents of the Hanoverian succession in Great Britain used the K&ouml;nigsmark story to allege that the future George II was not the son of Georg Ludwig.<br>
<br>Georg Ludwig succeeded to the British throne in 1714 as George I, but this brought no change in Sophia Dorothea's position. She began a clandestine correspondence with her daughter soon after her wedding, but the queen of Prussia failed to arrange her mother's freedom as Sophia Dorothea had hoped. The discovery that her financial adviser the count de Bar had embezzled the money she had entrusted to him to invest on the Amsterdam stock exchange further reduced her confidence. Depressed, she died at Ahlden, possibly following a stroke or heart attack, on 13 November 1726 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>; George I intended that she should be buried in the castle grounds at Ahlden but the soil was too waterlogged and her remains were placed in a lead coffin until further instructions were received from London. George eventually conceded that she be interred in the ducal vaults in the Old Church, Celle, where her body was placed in May 1727.<br>
<br>Sophia Dorothea's legend continued to grow after her death. It was said that the death of George I in 1727 was brought on by reading a final letter from Sophia Dorothea written shortly before her death. Variations on her life story continued to appear and she became a measure for the Hanoverian dynasty's immorality. When George IV began divorce proceedings against his wife, Caroline, in 1820, an attack on his conduct was published as <span class="italic">Sophia, Princess of Zell, to George the First, on his Accession to the Throne of England</span>. The discovery by historians of Sophia Dorothea's correspondence with K&ouml;nigsmark ended the myth that Sophia Dorothea had been falsely accused of adultery but did nothing to dispel the romantic allure of her story. This continued to be the basis for several historical novels in the twentieth century, most famously <span class="italic">Saraband for Dead Lovers</span> (1935) by Helen Simpson, filmed in 1948.<br>
