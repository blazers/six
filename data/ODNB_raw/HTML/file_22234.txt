<span class="headword">Piers, Sir  Henry</span>, first baronet  (1628&#150;1691), <span class="occ">chorographer and natural historian</span>, was the son of Sir William Piers and his wife, Martha, daughter of Sir James Ware (<i>d</i>. 1632) and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28729/', "Sir James Ware (1594&#150;1666)")</script>. His grandfather <a name="cosubject_22232"></a><span class="headword">Sir Henry Piers</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1623)<span class="occ"></span> of Tristernagh, co. Westmeath, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22236/', "William Piers (d. 1603)")</script> and Anne Holt, married Jane, daughter of Thomas Jones (<i>d</i>. 1619), protestant archbishop of Dublin; he visited Rome and became a Roman Catholic and also wrote about his continental travels. <a name="cosubject_22234"></a><span class="headword">James Piers</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1631&#150;1635), <span class="occ">writer</span>, identified in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> as a possible son of Henry Piers (<i>d</i>. 1623), was the grandson of James Piers, bishop of Ardfert, through his son Maurice. James Piers went to France, graduated DD, and became &#145;royal professor of philosophy in the Aquitanick College&#146;, the Irish college at Bordeaux. His two works on logic were published in that town in 1631 and 1635. Nothing else is known of him.<br>
<br>In the late 1640s Henry Piers the younger commanded a military company, and probably continued in the army for some years since he later held arrears land in both Wexford and Kilkenny; three of his sisters married leading English officers. About 1653 he married Mary, daughter from an earlier marriage of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15010/', "Henry Jones (1605&#150;1682)")</script>, then archdeacon of Killaloe and a government commissioner but from 1661 bishop of Meath, who had married one of Piers's sisters in 1646. Piers was sheriff of Longford and Westmeath in 1657 and 1658, and in the latter year was knighted by Henry Cromwell. In 1659 he represented the area in the union parliament, and in 1660 was made a baronet.<br>
<br>Piers's fame rests mainly on his &#145;A chronological description of West Meath&#146; of 1682, written at the behest of Anthony Dopping, who that year succeeded Jones as bishop of Meath, and to whom it is dedicated. In the 1680s Piers was associated with William Molyneux and the Dublin Philosophical Society, and his account of Westmeath was intended as a contribution to the Irish part of Moses Pitt's &#145;English atlas&#146;, for which Molyneux collected material from 1682 to the demise of the project in 1685. Of the material collected by Molyneux for twenty-two Irish counties, Piers's manuscript was the largest and most comprehensive contribution, but it did not appear in print until published by Charles Vallancy as the first part of <span class="italic">Collectanea de rebus Hibernicis</span> (1770).<br>
<br>Piers's manuscript was mainly concerned with the history and condition of Westmeath, dealing with the customs and manners of the Irish in that county, including their language, learning, habits, and rituals, as well as physical geography and aspects of economic and social life such as land tenure, the behaviour of landlords, husbandry, and the draining of bogs. Piers acknowledged the influence of Robert Boyle's writings on the weight and pressure of air, and his observations on the natural history of the county are of particular interest. He remarked on species of fish found in lakes, on animals and mussels found in bogs, and on the absence in general of poisonous animals. His entomological description of a venomous caterpillar which he called the &#145;connogh&#146; worm, and the superstitions surrounding this insect, is a highlight of the work, and predates Molyneux's communication on that topic to the Royal Society (PTRS, February 1685), published as &#145;Observatio de insecto Hibernico, vocato Connough worm&#146; in the <span class="italic">Acta Eruditorum</span> (June 1686) of Leipzig. Piers's original description was of:<blockquote>a certain reptile found in our bogs and moorish pastures &hellip; an ugly worm, sometimes as thick as a man's thumb, about two or three inches long, having, as all reptiles have, many short feet, a large head, great goggle eyes and glaring, between which riseth or jetteth forth, one thick bristle almost in shape like a horn, which is prominent and bendeth forward about three quarters of an inch. (<span class="italic">Chronological Description</span>, ed. C. Vallancy, 1770, 56)</blockquote>Martin Lister identified Piers's monster as an &#145;elephant caterpillar&#146; in the 1685 London edition of Johannes Goedart's <span class="italic">De insectis</span>.<br>
<br>Piers died in June 1691 and was succeeded as second baronet by his son William; the title was still extant in the twentieth century. A daughter, Elizabeth, had married her cousin Robert, second son of Sir James Ware (<i>d</i>. 1666). Piers's manuscripts have survived in the Ormonde collection.<br>
