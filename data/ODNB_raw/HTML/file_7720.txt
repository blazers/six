<span class="headword">Dobson,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1820, <em>d.</em> 1884), <span class="occ">journalist and antiquary</span>, was the eldest son of Lawrence Dobson and his wife, Mary Bowe. His father was a stationer and part proprietor with Isaac Wilcockson of the <span class="italic">Preston Chronicle</span>. William Dobson was baptized at Preston on 26 January 1820, and educated at the grammar school of that town. He afterwards pursued a career in journalism. On the retirement of Wilcockson his father purchased the remaining interest in the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span>, and took William into partnership with him. William was for some years the editor, until March 1868, when the proprietorship of the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> was transferred to Anthony Hewitson. Dobson's career as a journalist was at an end, but he continued, along with his brother James, to carry on the family stationery business at 23 Fishergate.<br>
<br>Dobson was a Liberal in politics and in August 1866 he first sat on the town council, with the expressed intention of opening Dr Shepherd's library more fully to the public. He remained on the council until November 1872, and subsequently sat for a further term from 1874 to November 1883. On 18 June 1867 he married Esther, daughter of Job Hallmark, a hop merchant, and sister of Alderman Hallmark of Preston; they had no children.<br>
<br>A member of the Chetham Society, Dobson had an extensive knowledge of local history and antiquities, especially the Preston area, and published nine books relating to the town. His keen interest in politics is evident from his writings, which include <span class="italic">The Preston Municipal Elections from 1835 to 1862</span> (1862) and <span class="italic">A History of Parliamentary Representation of Preston during the Last Hundred Years</span> (1856). Preston Guild was a subject which naturally drew his attention: he wrote an account of the 1862 celebrations and was the co-author with John Harland (1806&#150;1868) of a history of the guild published in 1862. His other work of note is <span class="italic">Rambles by the Ribble</span> (1864&#150;83), originally published as a serial in the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span>.<br>
<br>Dobson belonged to the Independent Order of Oddfellows, Manchester Union, and served as provincial grand master to the Pleasant Retreat Lodge, Preston, in 1882. He was also on the council of the Avenham Institute in the town. At one time he was a large shareholder of various local and district companies, but lost money when some of them failed. A Unitarian initially, in later years he became a member of the Church of England. In 1882 he moved to Churton Road, Chester, where he died on 8 August 1884, aged sixty-four. He was buried on 11 August in Chester cemetery.<br>
