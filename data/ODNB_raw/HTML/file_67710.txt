<span class="headword">Alsop,  Benjamin</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1658, <em>d.</em> in or before 1703), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/424/', "Vincent Alsop (bap. 1630, d. 1703)")</script>, presbyterian minister, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Benjamin King of Oakham, Rutland. His father, who was married on 1 May 1657, lived and preached at Geddington and Wellingborough in Northamptonshire. On 27 November 1672 Alsop was apprenticed to the well-known nonconformist bookseller Nathaniel Ponder; he gained the freedom of the Stationers' Company on 6 October 1679. He then set up in business on his own with a bookshop under the sign of the Angel and Bible in the Poultry in London, and between 1679 and 1684 was involved in the publication of over twenty books. His wife's name is not known, but they had at least three children&#151;Martha, Elizabeth, and Benjamin.<br>
<br>Many of the authors published by Alsop were nonconformists, the most celebrated being John Bunyan. In 1682, together with Dorman Newman, Alsop published Bunyan's allegory <span class="italic">The Holy War</span>. He subsequently went on to publish four other works by Bunyan: <span class="italic">The Greatness of the Soul</span> (1682 and 1683), <span class="italic">A Case of Conscience Resolved</span> (1683), <span class="italic">A Holy Life, the Beauty of Christianity</span> (1684), and <span class="italic">Seasonable Counsel</span> (1684). Among other notable authors with whom he was associated as sole or joint publisher were John Owen, Richard Baxter, Nehemiah Coxe, Thomas Gouge, and Stephen Lobb. He was also involved in the innovative practice of publishing by subscription, in 1680 undertaking with booksellers Thomas Parkhurst, Jonathan Robinson, and Brabazon Aylmer to publish the sermons of the celebrated presbyterian preacher Thomas Manton. He was also joint publisher with the same men, as well as Thomas Cockerill and Dorman Newman, of Matthew Poole's <span class="italic">Annotations upon the Holy Bible</span> (1683&#150;5), a two-volume work which Alsop's father helped to complete after Poole's death in 1679. In 1683, along with Thomas Malthus, he published a work by an anonymous woman, <span class="italic">Fifteen Real Comforts of Matrimony</span>, and in the same year they also published <span class="italic">The Compleat Statesman</span>, a flattering account of the whig leader Anthony Ashley Cooper, earl of Shaftesbury.<br>
<br>In 1685 Alsop gave up his business to become a captain in the army raised by the duke of Monmouth to overthrow the Catholic James II. Monmouth's revolt failed, but Alsop escaped and went into exile in the Netherlands. John Dunton, who later took over Alsop's shop in the Poultry, described him as &#145;a first-rate bookseller&#146;, but also as &#145;a wild sort of a spark&#146; who had joined Monmouth in hopes of being &#145;made an earl, or a baron at least&#146;  (Dunton, 290&#150;91). Alsop's background, however, strongly suggests that religious and political beliefs also motivated him to take this radical step. In 1687 his father was a prominent supporter of James II's declaration of indulgence and, perhaps as a result, on 31 May 1687 obtained a pardon for his son. It is unclear whether Alsop returned to England and nothing is known of his later years except that his father, who died on 8 May 1703, outlived him.<br>
