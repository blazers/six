<span class="headword">Churchill,  Awnsham</span>  (1658&#150;1728), <span class="occ">bookseller and politician</span>, was born on 2 May 1658 in the parish of St Peter's, Dorchester, Dorset, the son of William Churchill (1628&#150;1706), of Dorchester, who was also a bookseller, and Elizabeth Awnsham (<i>d</i>. 1714). He was apprenticed in 1676 to George Sawbridge, one of the principal booksellers in London, published his first book in 1681, and in 1690 entered into partnership with his brother <a href="#cosubject_69162">John [<i>see below</i>]</a> as booksellers and stationers at the sign of the Black Swan in Paternoster Row. Awnsham and John &#145;were of an universal trade&#146;, according to John Dunton who added that he &#145;was never concerned with any persons more exact in their accompts and more just in their payments&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Errors</span>, 204). Two other brothers, Joshua (<i>d</i>. 1721) and William (<i>c</i>.1657&#150;1737), both became MPs. The Churchills were distantly related to John Churchill, duke of Marlborough, though Awnsham appears to have made little political capital out of the connection and indeed held strongly whiggish opinions. In January 1680 he signed, alongside a number of radical printers and publishers, a mass petition calling on Charles II to allow parliament to sit. He also seems to have held strong views on religious toleration. Two of the first pamphlets he published in 1682 pleaded, controversially, for moderation towards and concessions for nonconformists.<br>
<br>Awnsham's political and religious views may have brought him to the attention of John Locke, whose publisher, book dealer, and financial agent he became; but they also embroiled him in controversy. In 1685 he and his brother William (with whom he was in partnership until 1690) were in contact with rebels who had fought for the duke of Monmouth. Awnsham subsequently visited the United Provinces where, according to a spy, he visited and had &#145;a great conference&#146; with one of the most ardent supporters of revolution principles, John Trenchard. Returning to England, Churchill was arrested in 1687 for printing and selling <span class="italic">Fagel's Letter</span>, which outlined William of Orange's views on toleration. That tract had also been printed in the Netherlands by John Starkey, with whom Awnsham worked in partnership at the time of the revolution. In January 1689 he lent &pound;50 to the prince, and soon thereafter began publishing Locke's works. His business was lucrative, and by 1694 he was able to invest &pound;500 of stock in the newly created Bank of England. Churchill's standing with the &#145;true whigs&#146; was sufficiently strong for him to have been approached in 1695 by Slingsby Bethel to publish the republican Edmund Ludlow's memoirs. Churchill found them an editor (almost certainly John Toland) only to find that Bethel both disliked the alterations to Ludlow's text and sought to regain possession of the manuscript through the courts. Churchill won and Bethel's death in 1697 allowed for the publication of the memoirs, albeit in a form shaped to the taste of later Stuart whiggery. Bethel was not the only one to have questioned Churchill's methods, for his friend John Locke also expressed reservations about the care with which Awnsham published his work but nevertheless thought highly enough of him to recommend that he should be consulted in October 1693 about the <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span>. The philosopher encouraged and gave advice about the project which became Churchill's most famous publication, <span class="italic">A Collection of Voyages</span> (1704). That year Locke summoned Awnsham to speak to him before he died and left &pound;10 in his will, which also made Churchill a trustee. It also saw Churchill's publication of the first volume of Thomas Rymer's <span class="italic">Foedera</span>, which ran to sixteen volumes. Other important publications include an edition of Camden's <span class="italic">Britannia</span>, Bayle's <span class="italic">Dictionary</span>, Burnet's sermons, Sir William Temple's <span class="italic">Miscellanea</span>, and John Strype's <span class="italic">Survey of London</span>. Although he was a devout whig, Churchill's publishing interests were diverse, and in October 1701 he joked with Locke that when he published Edmund Gibson's <span class="italic">The Right of the Archbishop to Continue or Prorogue the Whole Convocation</span> he had become &#145;printer for the Church&#146;. He was elected to the court of the Stationers' Company in April 1700.<br>
<br>By 1704 Churchill was wealthy enough to buy the manor of Henbury in Dorset and to consider entering parliament under the patronage of Anthony Ashley Cooper, third earl of Shaftesbury. Although claiming that his decision to contest Dorchester was &#145;against my own judgment and inclination&#146;, perhaps because he suffered a &#145;lameness&#146; in his leg  (BL, Stowe MS 748, fol. 27), he could not &#145;but tremble at the thought of a Tory House of Commons&#146; and decided that if honest gentlemen did not act &#145;the honest commonalty must be trampled on &hellip; I shall not think it very comfortable living in Dorsetshire when the T[ories] have got the possession of the country&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PRO 30/24/20/208/214). Churchill became a freeman of Dorchester and was successful at the polls, though one disgruntled tory believed he was chosen &#145;only for want of a better&#146;  (MS Ballard 21, fol. 222). Classified as a low-church whig on lists drawn up by political observers, he was probably on the country wing of the party&#151;given that he was evidently an ally of Shaftesbury, and was not listed as one of those who supported the court over the &#145;place clause&#146; of the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span> which aimed to limit the number of courtiers in the house. He was re-elected in 1708, but does not seem to have taken a very active role, failing even to participate in the passage of the <span class="roman">Copyright Act</span> of 1710, though in 1708 he was an active supporter of the whiggish Bishop Nicolson in his attempts to legalize his control over his diocese. He continued to represent Dorcester until 1710; in that year his vote in favour of impeaching Dr Sacheverell prompted an address from the borough which condemned &#145;republican principles and anti-monarchical notions&#146;, and took another &#145;kick&#146; at Churchill by declaring an intention to be represented &#145;by such as shall after their own heart be eminently loyal and perspicuously zealous&#146;  (Oldmixon, pt 2, 227). Defeated again in 1713, he made no further attempt to enter parliament. Churchill died, unmarried, on 24 April 1728, leaving &pound;100 to his brother William and his property and extensive library to his nephews. His will referred to &pound;4000 of stock in the Bank of England. One of his apprentices, Charles Rivington, was to follow his master in eminence in the trade. <a name="cosubject_69162"></a><span class="headword">John Churchill</span>  (<em>c.</em>1663&#150;<em>c.</em>1714)<span class="occ"></span> was very much the junior partner to his brother. His name does not even appear in the Stationers' Company apprenticeship books. Like Awnsham, John was on friendly terms with John Locke, and helped invest his money. The brothers' first joint publication was Locke's <span class="italic">Second Letter Concerning Toleration</span>. Churchill's name last appears on an imprint in 1714, but his will (dated 10 September 1714) was not proved until 1716. He left Barkham Farm in Dorset to his eldest son, William, and provided for his other five children, two of whom followed him into publishing. His wife, Mary, was left an annuity of &pound;160 p.a. and his brother Awnsham was made an executor.<br>
