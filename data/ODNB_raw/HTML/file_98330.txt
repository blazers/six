<span class="headword">Colville,  David</span>  (<em>c.</em>1581&#150;1629), <span class="occ">classical and oriental scholar</span>, was the fifth and youngest son of Robert Colvill (<i>d</i>. 1584), the protestant laird of Cleish, Kinross-shire, and his wife, Margaret Lindsay, daughter of the laird of Dowhill. A precocious student who displayed a great talent for Greek and Hebrew, Colville graduated MA at St Andrews University in 1601, when he must still have been a protestant. Although details of his early life are sketchy, he appears to have travelled to Spain in 1605, where the resident ambassador, Sir Charles Cornwallis, met him in Valladolid and remarked that Colville had become a Roman Catholic like his paternal uncle, the political conspirator John Colville, who had converted in 1600. Some time before 1606 David went to Avignon to study theology. In 1608 he was enrolled in the Scots College in Rome, which he left without having taken holy orders. He studied law and medicine in Padua and Bologna, probably between 1609 and 1615, and also appeared in Venice in 1611. In 1617 he moved briefly to Pisa and Rome, whence he departed for Spain.<br>
<br>At the end of 1617 Colville arrived in Madrid, and was appointed royal interpreter by Philip III, with the obligation to reside at the Escorial, near Madrid. Colville was one of the many Catholic Scots who came to serve the Habsburg crown; chief among them was Colonel William Sempill, who gathered around him a circle of illustrious compatriots, including Sir Robert Ker (later first earl of Ancram). Colville entered into correspondence with Sempill about his possible assistance with learned editions of texts prepared by the Jesuits for the Plantin Press. He also corresponded with a number of antiquarians such as Giovanni Battista Doni and his fellow Scot Thomas Dempster. Despite these political and social contacts Colville spent his ten years in the Escorial mostly as a recluse, studying, cataloguing, and teaching. He must have become a Catholic priest during his time there, as he was later called &#145;a priest from Scotland&#146; (<i>sacerdos e Scotia</i>) by Cardinal Federicus Borromaeus  (Durkan, &#145;David Colville&#146;, 148).<br>
<br>Colville had already learned Greek and Hebrew before arriving at the Escorial, but he started studying Arabic only in 1621 and &#145;without any help except through books and dictionaries&#146;, as he himself stated in the colophon to one of his works  (L&ouml;fgren and Traini, 1.76, no. 131). His intellectual interests were extremely wide-ranging. During his ten-year sojourn at the Escorial he catalogued the vast majority of Greek and Arabic manuscripts, as well as many Latin and Hebrew ones. In all these languages he perused authors whom the Inquisition viewed with suspicion; consequently he often needed the special permission of his superiors to consult and copy them. When he left the Escorial in 1627 his prior described him as a reliable man who had done great service in teaching the monks Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic.<br>
<br>It is particularly in the area of Arabic studies where Colville's influence, if indirectly, is most keenly felt today. Three products of his scholarly efforts during this decade illustrate the extent of his knowledge. First, he partly copied a manuscript of the <span class="roman">Koran</span> that originally consisted of the Arabic text, Latin translation, and notes based on the Muslim exegetical tradition (Biblioteca Ambrosiana, Milan, MS D100 inf). Generally speaking, Christians during the middle ages and the Renaissance had mostly been interested in the <span class="roman">Koran</span> as a heretical text, and made little effort to understand it in the light of Muslim doctrine. By copying a <span class="roman">Koran</span> that contained notes based on Arabic commentaries (<i>tafsir</i>), Colville tried to understand the Muslim holy writ not primarily from the perspective of anti-Islamic polemic. In using the same tools as the Muslims, he preceded European <span class="roman">Koran</span> scholarship by several decades. Only with the publication of Luigi Marracci's <span class="italic">Alcorani textus universus</span> (1698) did the use of <i>tafsir</i> become firmly established.<br>
<br>Second, Colville recognized early on that Arabic versions of Greek medical texts could fill the gap where the latter were no longer extant. He found a number of manuscripts in the Escorial containing the Arabic version of those parts of Galen's <span class="italic">Commentary on the Hippocratic &#145;Epidemics&#146;</span> no longer surviving in Greek, and collated them. In doing so he displayed great philological acumen, since he compared the various manuscripts of the Arabic version at his disposal. Moreover, he also recognized the importance of the <span class="italic">Questions on the &#145;Epidemics&#146;</span>, an abridgement of the text in question and answer format produced by Hunain ibn Ishaq, a famous ninth-century translator and court physician in Baghdad. Colville's partial copy of this latter text (Biblioteca Ambrosiana, Milan, MS B135 sup, fols. 119&#150;44) is the only one known still to exist today. He thus laid the foundation for modern editorial efforts in this area.<br>
<br>Third, Colville collated four Arabic manuscripts of al-Firuzabadi's (<i>d</i>. 1415) <span class="italic">Comprehensive Dictionary</span> (<span class="italic">al-Qamus al-muhit</span>). This work marks a high point in the Arabic tradition of national lexicography. The dictionary lists Arabic words according to &#145;radicals&#146; (or &#145;root letters&#146;), and gives an explanation of the various meanings, again in Arabic. Colville finished copying and collating this manuscript (Biblioteca Ambrosiana, Milan, MS D141 inf) in 1623, some five years after Federicus Borromaeus had charged Antonio Giggeo with translating al-Firuzabadi's <span class="italic">Comprehensive Dictionary</span> into Latin, and seeing the translation through the press. The resulting work was printed in four volumes under the title <span class="italic">Kanz al-luga al-&#145;Arabiya, sive, Thesaurus linguae arabicae</span> (1632) at the cardinal's expense. It represented the first European Arabic dictionary to pay proper attention to the indigenous Arabic dictionaries, and therefore constituted a milestone not only in Arabic lexicography, but also in Oriental studies in general. Colville's exact contribution to this work remains to be investigated, but it is likely that his manuscript of al-Firuzabadi's <span class="italic">Comprehensive Dictionary</span> played an important part.<br>
<br>In 1625 Francesco Barberini, the papal secretary of state, had visited the Escorial and made Colville's acquaintance. Two years later, in June 1627, and perhaps because of this meeting, Colville returned to Rome, where he entered Barberini's circle. There he encountered a fair number of his contemporaries, among them the Scottish diplomat and educator George Conn. In February 1628 he left Rome on a trip to consult various Italian libraries; it led him first to Florence, and thence to Pisa, Genoa, Pavia, and finally Milan, where he met Federicus Borromaeus, a great patron of the arts and founder of the Biblioteca Ambrosiana and its sister institution, the Collegium Ambrosianum. In March 1628 Colville returned to Rome via Turin. Later that year, in August, he went back to Turin and stayed there until June 1629 to serve as interpreter to the duke of Savoy, Carlo Emanuele I. At the end of August 1629 he finally returned to Milan and stayed with Cardinal Borromaeus. He died only four days after his arrival, of a fever&#151;or perhaps of the scholarly melancholy to which he had been prone most of his life. The cardinal reported Colville as saying on his deathbed that scholarship and manuscripts were his only delight.<br>
