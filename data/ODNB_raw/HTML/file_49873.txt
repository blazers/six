<span class="headword">Lewy,  Casimir</span>  (1919&#150;1991), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was born in Warsaw, Poland, on 26 February 1919, the son of Ludwik Lewy (1887&#150;1919) and his wife, Izabela, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rybier (1892&#150;1942). His father, who was a medical doctor, died when he was in infancy, so that he grew up in his mother's large and talented family. In 1927 he was sent to a fashionable private school in Warsaw owned by the Lutheran congregation, the Mikolaj Rej School, which was attended by a number of gifted people with whom he became friendly. At fifteen he read an article in a literary weekly by Tadeusz Kotarbi&#324;ski, and his interest in philosophy was aroused. Characteristically he not only bought a copy of a book by Kotarbi&#324;ski, but also started to attend lectures in philosophy at the University of Warsaw.<br>
<br>Lewy came to England in 1936 in order to improve his English but, concluding that this would be insufficiently stimulating, he matriculated at Cambridge and read philosophy as well. Although he had intended to return to Warsaw after a year, he decided to continue with his studies in Cambridge under the supervision of John Wisdom at Trinity College. He graduated in 1939 with first-class honours, having already published four papers in the journal <span class="italic">Analysis</span>, a remarkable achievement for a man of twenty whose native language was Polish. The outbreak of war made a return to Poland impossible, and Lewy registered for a PhD on &#145;Some philosophical considerations about the survival of death&#146; under the supervision of G. E. Moore. The degree was awarded in 1943, and from January 1943 to 1945 he lectured in Cambridge, taking as his theme an influential remark made by John Wisdom in his paper &#145;Metaphysics and verification&#146; that the statements of philosophers are in a certain sense &#145;verbal&#146;. Shortly after marrying Eleanor Ford (<i>b</i>. 1923/4), daughter of Percy Ford, a university professor, on 28 July 1945 Lewy took up a lectureship in Liverpool, where Eleanor also held a lectureship in economic history. They went on to have three sons: Nicholas, Sebastian, and John Dominic.<br>
<br>In 1952 Lewy returned to Cambridge as university lecturer in moral sciences. He was appointed Sidgwick lecturer in 1955, becoming a fellow of Trinity College in 1959. In 1972 he was appointed reader in philosophy, a post he held until his retirement in 1982. Lewy held visiting professorships at the University of Illinois in 1951&#150;2, at the University of Texas at Austin in 1967, and at Yale in 1969. He was elected to an honorary fellowship of the Polish Society of Arts and Sciences Abroad in 1968, and to a fellowship of the British Academy in 1980. In 1985 <span class="italic">Exercises in Analysis</span>, which included papers by nine of his former pupils, was published as a token of gratitude for the passionate work that had gone into his supervisions.<br>
<br>During the first period at Cambridge, as well as attending many of Moore's lectures, Lewy attended all the lectures Wittgenstein gave between 1938 and 1945. He became friendly with both men, but it was Moore whom he chose as his PhD supervisor. His respect and affection for Moore were very great; in the preface to <span class="italic">Meaning and Modality</span> he says that he learned more from Moore's lectures on metaphysics in 1938&#150;9 and in the preceding year than from any other course he attended. During the war he assisted Moore with the editorial work for the journal <span class="italic">Mind</span>, and after Moore's death he prepared two volumes of his papers for publication. The first, <span class="italic">Commonplace Book, 1919&#150;1953</span>, was published in 1962, followed by <span class="italic">Lectures on Philosophy</span> in 1966. He also prepared for publication two books based on the lecture notes of C. D. Broad, Moore's successor at Cambridge, <span class="italic">Leibniz</span> (1975) and <span class="italic">Kant: an Introduction</span> (1978). The time devoted to meticulously preparing these volumes partly explains why he published so little after his return to Cambridge. However, his publications include <span class="italic">Meaning and Modality</span>, which though it was published in 1976 had grown out of the lectures he first gave in Cambridge during the war, for all that they were revised many times. Attacking reductive accounts of abstract entities, Lewy argues that many influential theories in the philosophy of language and logic&#151;for example, that necessary truths are so by convention&#151;are based on the mistaken supposition that such an account is possible. The book concludes with two dense chapters on entailment, the topic he wrote about most, concluding that any attempt to reconstruct an intuitive concept that avoids the paradoxes of strict implication will have aspects which are as anti-intuitive as the paradoxes themselves.<br>
<br>Lewy was an exceptionally able teacher, and many of his pupils went on to distinguished academic careers. To give of oneself as he did in lectures and tutorials must have been exhausting, and further explains why he published relatively little work of his own after 1952. His lectures and supervisions were devoted to a passionate and exhausting pursuit of the truth&#151;the key point was invariably one of logic and meaning. It became apparent that it is easy to make mistakes, and difficult to live up to the standards set for one. But demanding though this was, supervisions could also be fun. Lewy had a superb dramatic talent, and loved telling stories delivered in a Polish accent with a strong vibrato and accompanying winks and gestures. Many concerned the extraordinary things other philosophers had said, culminating with such comments as &#145;If that's what his logic is like, I don't want to know about his moral philosophy&#146;  (personal knowledge). He died in Cambridge, of a heart attack, while being operated on for cancer of the colon, on 8 February 1991.<br>
