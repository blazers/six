<span class="headword">Cowgill,  (George) Bryan</span>  (1927&#150;2008), <span class="occ">television producer and executive</span>, was born on 27 May 1927 at 19 Cowper Avenue, Clitheroe, Lancashire, the son of John Clifford Cowgill (1899&#150;1969), printer and stationer, and later proprietor of the Clitheroe <span class="italic">Advertiser and Times</span>, and his wife, Ada Gertrude, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hartley (1902&#150;1999). He had one brother. He attended Clitheroe grammar school from 1938 to 1942 and left at the age of fifteen with few formal qualifications. His grandfather's connections in the regional newspaper industry helped him secure his first job as a copy boy with the <span class="italic">Lancashire Evening Post</span> in Preston.<br>
<br>In 1943 Cowgill enlisted in the Royal Navy's Y scheme, introduced to allow boys aged sixteen and seventeen to pursue a career in the navy. He was selected for officer training in the Royal Marines king's squad, and at eighteen became the youngest officer in the 3rd Royal Marine commandos. He reached the rank of lieutenant, and in 1945 was billeted to a small fishing village, Tai O, on the island of Lantau, near Hong Kong. On demobilization in 1947 he returned to work at the family-run newspaper, where he became editor. On 16 October 1951 he married Doreen Thompson, a 23-year-old shop assistant, and daughter of Harold Thompson, transport manager. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>Cowgill could have built a career in the family business, but in 1954 he responded to an advertisement for the job of &#145;stage manager&#146; in the BBC's television outside broadcast department, based at Lime Grove, London. The following year he started work as a &#145;floor manager&#146;, the very same day (22 September) that the BBC's competitor, Associated-Rediffusion, began broadcasting in London. He quickly learned the grammar of live television production and within months was a production assistant on the outside broadcast series <span class="italic">Saturday Night Out</span>, which introduced the BBC's &#145;roving eye&#146; camera. In the same year, he directed his first television programme, <span class="italic">Dancing Club</span>, featuring Victor Sylvester and his orchestra. From then on he regularly directed outside broadcasts, including sport.<br>
<br>In 1957 the BBC's director of outside broadcasting (television), Peter Dimmock, asked Cowgill to produce <span class="italic">Sportsview</span>, the BBC's popular midweek sports magazine programme. The slick, fast-paced programme, edited by Paul Fox, mixed live studio interviews with filmed highlights from sport, and demanded disciplined direction. Cowgill excelled in the role, later admitting that his naval background helped him to call the shots with a commanding voice. It was in this role that he earned the nickname Ginger, partly because of his red hair, but more because of his reputation as a loud, fiery taskmaster, a tag he claimed did not reflect his &#145;true character&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mr Action Replay</span>, 25).<br>
<br>After directing the coverage of athletics during the 1958 Commonwealth games in Cardiff, Cowgill and Fox approached Dimmock with an idea for <span class="italic">Grandstand</span>, which became the BBC's flagship sports programme until its demise in 2007. As head of BBC television sport from 1963, Cowgill was involved in a number of ground-breaking initiatives. In 1964 alone these included a deal with the Football League that led to the launch of <span class="italic">Match of the Day</span> on BBC2, satellite coverage from the Olympic games in Tokyo, and forty-over Sunday league cricket. Cowgill won three BAFTA, including one for the coverage of the 1966 world cup finals, in which &#145;action replay&#146; technology (a phrase introduced by Cowgill) was used for the first time in Britain. Throughout the 1960s <span class="italic">Grandstand</span> became synonymous with the BBC's coverage of sport, and so did Cowgill's working relationship with its presenter David Coleman. On 10 November 1966, Coleman was Cowgill's best man when, his first marriage having ended in divorce, he married Jennifer Elizabeth (Jenny) Baker (<i>b</i>. 1939), a BBC television secretary, and daughter of Sidney James Abbott Baker, an insurance official. They had two sons.<br>
<br>With the arrival of colour television in 1967, Cowgill drove the BBC's negotiations with the All England Tennis Club to abolish the amateur&#150;professional distinction, and in 1968 Wimbledon became an open championship. From 1972 he was head of the Television Outside Broadcast Group, and two years later he succeeded Paul Fox as controller of BBC1. It was a role he relished and from 1974 to 1977 his scheduling strategy transformed the performance of the channel, with series including <span class="italic">Porridge</span>, <span class="italic">The Good Life</span>, <span class="italic">All Creatures Great and Small</span>, <span class="italic">Mastermind</span>, and <span class="italic">Jim'll Fix It</span>.<br>
<br>In 1977 Cowgill was invited to become director of news and current affairs, with a place on the BBC's board of management. However, the job entailed a reduction in salary, so when an offer came to become managing director of Thames Television he left the BBC and doubled his salary. In 1979, and again in 1984, he was embroiled in a battle with the engineering unions, and infamously locked out members of the Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians from the Thames building. In spite of the disputes he led Thames to eight years of commercial success and critical acclaim, in the process enticing his friends Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise to flit from the BBC to ITV. However, his tenure ended abruptly in 1985 when he broke a concordat with the BBC and poached the rights to the American soap <span class="italic">Dallas</span>. Cowgill's former colleague Sir Paul Fox later assessed the <span class="italic">Dallas</span> affair as a &#145;monumental misjudgement&#146;. The International Broadcasting Authority forced Thames to relinquish the rights and Cowgill smartly offered his resignation. This effectively ended his professional career, save for a brief period with the sports agent Mark McCormack's IMG, and consultancy with British Satellite Broadcasting, which was establishing a sports channel. He retired to Stratford upon Avon, and published his autobiography, <span class="italic">Mr Action Replay</span>, in 2006. He died of a heart attack on 14 July 2008, and was survived by his wife, Jenny, and his children.<br>
