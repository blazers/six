<span class="headword">Greene,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1573, <em>d.</em> 1612), <span class="occ">actor</span>, said on 16 June 1607 that he was thirty-four years old, that he was born at Romford, Essex, and that he had lived in Whitechapel for three years and, before that, in the Tower of London for six. He must therefore be the Thomas Grene, son of John Grene, who was baptized at Romford on 13 September 1573. He had a sister, Elizabeth Barrett, and brothers, John and Jeffrey Greene, alive in 1612, and he may be the Thomas Greene who wrote <span class="italic">A Poets Vision</span> (1603) and a commendatory poem for Drayton's <span class="italic">Barons Wars</span> (1605). On 15 March 1604, during the great plague of 1603&#150;4, he appears next to last in a list of Queen Anne's Men, having succeeded, apparently, the company's famous clown Will Kemp (<i>fl</i>. 1585&#150;1602). About the same time he married Susan [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74435/', "Baskervile, Susan (bap. 1573, d. 1649)")</script>], the widow of Robert Browne, an actor who held a lease on the Boar's Head playhouse in Whitechapel, where Queen Anne's (then called Worcester's) Men had recently played. Browne had died of plague in mid-October 1603, and Susan Browne acquired his property on 9 January 1604. She was thirty years old and the mother of five infants.<br>
<br>While the plague continued, the company tried unsuccessfully to legitimate themselves by promoting a patent that gives Greene's name first among the members and provides that the company play &#145;Aswell w<sup>th</sup>in there now usuall Howsen, Called the Curtayne, And the Bores head, &hellip; as in any other play howse not used by others, by the said Thomas Greene, elected, or by hym hereafter to be builte&#146;  (Berry, 73). Evidently he owed sudden prominence to his wife and to access to capital. On 1 July 1611 he held, or had lately held, leases on the Curtain playhouse and other properties nearby.<br>
<br>Greene was &#145;one of the principall and cheif persons of the said Companie&#146; until his death  (Greenstreet, 499). They were at the Boar's Head in the winter of 1606&#150;7, then at the Red Bull playhouse in Clerkenwell. He is first among Queen Anne's Men in their patent of 1609 and received payments for their performances at court from 1609 to 1612. He lived in Clerkenwell from at least May 1608.<br>
<br>Greene once played a baboon, and in 1611 in John Cooke's play <span class="italic">Greene's Tu quoque</span> he played Bubble, an amiable ass whose tag line suitable for all occasions is &#145;Tu quoque&#146;. Bubble apparently represented Greene's usual stage persona. When characters propose to go to a play, Bubble does not care &#145;whither, so the Clowne have a part: For I fayth I am no body without a Foole&#146;. &#145;Why then&#146;, says another, &#145;wee'le goe to the Red Bull; they say <i>Green's</i> a good Clowne&#146;. Bubble replies &#145;<i>Greene? Greene's</i> an Asse&#146;, and, when asked why, adds, &#145;Indeed I ha' no reason: for they say, hee is as like mee as ever he can looke&#146;  (Cooke, sig. G2<i>v</i>). A woodcut in all three early editions of the play shows a man, who should be Greene, saying &#145;Tu quoque, To you Sir&#146;; and the frontispiece of Francis Kirkman's <span class="italic">The Wits</span> (1673) shows a man saying &#145;Tue quo que&#146; as he comes through curtains to join bits of old plays being performed on a stage.<br>
<br>Greene's will, dated 25 July 1612, provides for Browne's children as well as Greene's daughter, Honor, baptized in Clerkenwell on 17 April 1609. He was a man of means, for he left bequests of &pound;344, plus a residue (including his share in Queen Anne's Men) to provide for his widow. He was buried at St James's, Clerkenwell, on 7 August 1612. One of five admiring epigrams suggests that he had been overseas just before he died. Thomas Heywood, the company's playwright, wrote &#145;without flattery&#146; that &#145;there was not an Actor of his nature in his time of better ability in performance of what he undertooke; more applaudent by the Audience, of greater grace at the Court, or of more general love in the Citty&#146;  (Cooke, sig. A2). Browne's son, William, asked in 1634 to be buried as near as possible &#145;to my father Greene&#146;  (Bentley, 2.636).<br>
<br>In June 1613 Greene's widow married James Baskervile, who fled to Ireland in 1617 charged with debts and bigamy. She had protracted financial dealings with Queen Anne's Men that led to lawsuits in 1617 and from 1623 to 1626, when she prevailed. She also acquired an interest in the Fortune playhouse. She died in January 1648 and was buried at St James's, Clerkenwell.<br>
