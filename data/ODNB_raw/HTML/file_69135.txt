<span class="headword">Townsend,  Theophila</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1692), <span class="occ">Quaker activist and writer</span>, of unknown parentage, was married to Richard Townsend (1629&#150;1715), a bodice-maker and Quaker of Cirencester, Gloucestershire. Richard, who was the son of Roger and Elizabeth Townsend of Cirencester, had a brother named Roger. His public association with Quakerism is dated first to his arrest in November 1660, and lasted well into the first decade of the eighteenth century; his name appears frequently in the literature of Quaker suffering. The couple were apparently childless.<br>
<br>Theophila Townsend became involved in public professions of faith when, having absented herself for some years from her local parish church, her name became linked to the Quakers. From early in the 1670s through to her death in 1692 she tirelessly protested against anti-Quaker laws: during the 1680s, particularly, she seemed rarely out of prison. The first significant period of incarceration, lasting eleven weeks, was occasioned by an act of public preaching in May 1682. Between that time and April 1686, when she was released, Townsend was frequently castigated by the authorities. By arresting her for minor offences, then committing her for the refusal either to provide sureties for good behaviour or to swear the oath of allegiance, the authorities succeeded in restraining her liberty for much of this four-year period. She was released alongside fifty-six other Quakers freed from Gloucester Castle, after James II issued a declaration of indulgence that brought a level of religious tolerance to nonconformists nationwide.<br>
<br>Townsend's life as a Quaker was therefore shaped by her experiences of &#145;suffering&#146;; however, only one of her published texts refers extensively to imprisonment&#151;the rest being concerned with more general aspects of Quaker policy. When writing to the &#145;persecuting magistrates&#146; in <span class="italic">A Word in Councel</span> (1687), Townsend openly expresses a common antinomian idea that it is better to &#145;obey God then [<i>sic</i>] Man&#146;  (p. 4). Indeed, her usage of <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> topoi here and elsewhere is indicative of a prophetic impulse in her writing. In <span class="italic">A Testimony Concerning the Life and Death of Jane Whitehead</span>, for example, Townsend draws on <span class="roman">Revelation</span> to predict the second coming of Christ. She also wrote in praise of other deceased Quakers&#151;Joan Vokins, Amariah Drewet, and Anne Whitehead. Her tribute to Anne Whitehead (<span class="italic">An Epistle of Love</span>), who was a central member of the London women's meetings, was combined with a more general explanation of women's public work in the separate meetings.<br>
<br>Perhaps the most enduring testimony to Theophila Townsend came from the Quaker martyrologist Joseph Besse who, writing of her many sufferings, pithily described her as &#145;a virtuous Woman, and of great Understanding&#146;  (Besse, 1.225). Townsend's death in Cirencester, through unknown causes, was recorded in the Quaker registers, and she was buried there on 15 June 1692.<br>
