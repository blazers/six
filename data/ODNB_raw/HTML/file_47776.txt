<span class="headword">Cotton, Sir  William James Richmond</span>  (1822&#150;1902), <span class="occ">businessman and politician</span>, was born at Stratford-le-Bow, London, on 13 November 1822, the eldest son of William Cotton. He received a private school education before joining a solicitor's office and then becoming a leading partner in Culverwell, Brook &amp; Co., leather, hide, and tallow brokers. In 1846 he married Caroline, the daughter of Charles Pottinger of Sunderland; they had twelve children. Cotton published in 1850 a poem called <span class="italic">Imagination</span> dedicated to Charles Dickens. He also wrote <span class="italic">Smash: a Sketch of the Times, Past, Present and to Come</span> (1860) referring to railway speculations at a time of commercial panic. Among his other interests he owned extensive iron ore mines in Norway, was director of the Liverpool and London and Globe Fire and Life offices, and served as chairman of the Staines and West Drayton Railway Company.<br>
<br>Armed with a fine business reputation, Cotton began his civic career in 1866 when he was elected alderman for Lime Street ward in the City of London. He served as alderman until 1892, the last four years in the ward of Bridge Without. He had also gained recognition as the deputy chairman and joint treasurer of the Lancashire and Cheshire Operative Relief Fund in 1861. Building on these foundations, he was elected sheriff of London and Middlesex in 1868&#150;9, and was appointed magistrate for London and Hertfordshire, commissioner of lieutenancy for London, chairman of the City police committee, and commissioner of Inland Revenue for Hertfordshire. He was elected to the London school board in 1870, and served in the City area until 1879. He was also made chairman of the board of governors of the Mary Datchelor schools, member of the Thames Conservancy Board, governor of Christ's, St Bartholomew's, St Thomas's, Bridewell, and Bethlem hospitals, and a governor of Queen Anne's Bounty. In 1892 he was appointed chamberlain.<br>
<br>Cotton was lord mayor of London in 1875&#150;6, and hosted a banquet to celebrate the homecoming of the prince of Wales from India at a reported cost of &pound;50,000. This was one of the few remarkable events in an unremarkable year, although Cotton oversaw a fund for eastern war victims and a mass meeting held on the subject of the &#145;Bulgarian atrocities&#146;. Closer to home, funds were raised for the sufferers of the floods of the Thames and the fens.<br>
<br>Above all, Cotton was an advocate for the City guilds. He was a member of the courts of the Furriers', Fanmakers', and Loriners' companies, master of the Haberdashers' and Saddlers' companies in his mayoral year, and master of the Turners' Company (1891&#150;3). When the livery companies were under attack from Liberal opponents, Cotton became chairman of the City Guilds Defence Association and championed their cause in parliament. As a result he was a member of the 1884 royal commission appointed to inquire into the livery companies of the City of London, and both co-author of the dissenting minority report and sole author of an additional protest  (&#145;Commissioners &hellip; livery companies&#146;, 39.57&#150;76). One of his main objections concerned the passages relating to technical education, a subject in which he took a more voluntarist stance.<br>
<br>It is not surprising, then, that as an unsuccessful Conservative candidate for Southwark in December 1868, Cotton campaigned on &#145;constitutional principles&#146;, opposing sitting members on the Irish question. Issuing &#145;a very liberal address&#146;, he won 2495 votes, despite putting his name forward only forty-eight hours before the poll. He was member of parliament for the City of London from 1874 (the first Conservative alderman to be elected for forty-four years) until standing down after the election of 1885. However, he increased his vote in the interim, and remained the most popular candidate. As a critic of Disraeli over his Russian policy, he was denied the customary baronetcy at the close of his year as lord mayor, the honour being conferred only on 5 July 1892. Cotton had a reputation for &#145;manly independence&#146;, a term that, placed alongside his business and civic achievements, may also serve as his epitaph. In spite of suffering from gout for twenty-five years, he served the public continuously until his death, following a relatively short illness, at his home, 9 Bramham Gardens, Kensington, London, on 4 June 1902.<br>
