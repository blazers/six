<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rocker,  Rudolf</span>  (1873&#150;1958), <span class="occ">political activist and author</span>, was born in Mainz, on 25 March 1873, the son of Georg Philip Rocker, a typographer, and his wife, Anna Margarita Naumann. Rhinelanders were at that time opposed to Prussian expansionism and Rocker's father was in the forefront of the struggle against an alien authoritarianism imposed by Berlin. His libertarian activism was not lost on the young Rudolf.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandpolitics18741894"></a>Early life and politics, 1874&#150;1894</h2>Orphaned at the age of ten Rudolf Rocker was confined to an orphanage in Mainz, which proved anathema to a sensitive boy who had absorbed the free enquiring spirit of his environment. This had been reinforced by the influence of his radical uncle, Rudolf Naumann, who had also inculcated in him the pursuit of knowledge and intellectual discourse. A harsh discipline imposed by the Catholic fathers in the orphanage led to his frequent absconding which eventually meant a forcible transfer to a reformatory. Here his luck changed. A liberal-minded administrator recognized a more creative potential in this clever young offender, and obtained him his freedom to become a bookbinder's apprentice&#151;a craft notorious for attracting to its ranks a large group of wandering revolutionaries. In 1890 Rocker joined the Fachverein f&uuml;r Buchbinder and was inducted into the local German Social Democratic Party (SPD) by his uncle. He soon perceived the party's intolerance of dissent imposed by a rigid bureaucracy and consequently, with the party's restoration to legal status in June 1891, he became a member of the young left-wing oppositionists, the Jungen, and with them, was expelled from the SPD in October 1891. His ideological direction was now set towards a form of libertarian socialism. His creed was finalized at the Brussels Congress of the Second International in August 1891 as a result of the opposition proffered by Domela Nieuwenhuis, pioneer leader of the Dutch socialist movement (who was already veering towards anarchism) against the stolid authoritarianism of Wilhelm Liebnecht, leader of the SPD. Rocker recognized that his own route lay through the former, and, henceforth, he devoted his activities to the underground movement led by the German anarchist Johann Most.<br>
<br>Rocker's European education was enlarged by his travels as a journeyman across the borders of Germany into Austria, Switzerland, Italy, France, and Spain. Not only did this reinforce his belief that individual freedom, in all its aspects, was the ultimate test of the &#145;good&#146; society, but it also led to wider ranging interests, especially in the language and culture of other nations: an experience that kept him free from the disease of chauvinism that had already infected many of the older SPD rank and file. It would provide him with an easy entr&eacute;e into, and acceptance by, other ethnic groups, a sound preparation for his future role among the universal &#145;outcasts&#146;&#151;the Jews.<br>
<br>In late 1892 the German police discovered that Rocker had been smuggling illegal propaganda into Germany. He escaped into France and thus began his long exile from the homeland which would last for twenty-five years. It was in Paris, in a rented room on top of a coffee house in the boulevard Barbes, that Rocker was first introduced to a group of Jewish anarchists. In the villages around Mainz he had first come across peasant antisemitism, encouraged by the priests who preached the &#145;gospel&#146; that the socialists were the servants of Jews, but here he was confronted by a different picture. In a small chamber about fifty to sixty &#145;comrades&#146; of both sexes were freely involved in lively intellectual discussion. A few were absorbed in reading journals printed in Hebrew, which he later recalled as the Yiddish anarchist papers the <span class="italic">Arbeter Fraint</span> (&#145;worker's friend&#146;) and <span class="italic">Freie Arbeter Stimme</span> (&#145;free worker's voice&#146;). He was struck by the absence of the gentile caricature of the Jew, and all spoke a German-like patois, Yiddish, which Rocker would soon master as his own. What struck him was the active participation of women as equals and accepted as such in accordance with libertarian principles, in all operations within the circle. This, however, he noted with approval, did not detract from their femininity. The Jews' warmth and hospitality, and their high-powered thrust in debate, appealed to Rocker. He returned often and such was their respect for him that he was invited regularly to lecture on kindred themes. The foundation of a mutual regard was laid; a sound preparation for his golden years of leadership among the immigrant Jewish poor of London's East End and beyond.<h2>
<a name="LifeintheJewishEastEnd18941906"></a>Life in the Jewish East End, 1894&#150;1906</h2>Rocker's first visit to London resulted from an invitation by the West End &#145;Autonomie&#146; libertarian group in 1894, for the purpose of enlisting his aid in smuggling literature over the Belgian border. It came to nothing, and increased anti-anarchist police operations in Paris forced Rocker to return to London on new year's day (1895). An attempted trip to Germany from there also proved abortive when he was ordered by his consulate first to undergo compulsory medical examination. Rocker got the message. Return would mean instant imprisonment. Although reluctant to stay, his election to the post of librarian of the first section of the Communist Workers Educational Union meant a job and a secure base. It was here that he first met the legendary anarchists Louise Michel and Errico Malatesta, who induced him to remain in London.<br>
<br>Rocker's readings on the East End, especially those of John Henry McKay, attracted him to the locale, universally regarded as a &#145;city of dreadful night&#146; harbouring the dregs of humanity. With a fellow &eacute;migr&eacute;, Otto Schreiber, he began to explore the insalubrious rookeries and cobbled alleyways that constituted the worst slums in the metropolis. It was a traumatic experience but it revealed to him that &#145;worse conditions mean better&#146; prospects for revolution was a dangerous illusion. Into these slums swarmed the Jewish exiles, fleeing from tsarist persecution. For Rocker, it was east London's one redeeming feature. Here he rediscovered those kindred spirits he had first encountered in Paris. Rocker's emergence from voluntary partisanship to leadership of these people is a remarkable tale. Before doing so he had to win the confidence of a folk who through bitter experience had reason to shun the gentile. As in Paris, it was not long before he began to command their trust and deep respect.<br>
<br>Most of the newcomers, men and women, were involved in the cheap tailoring trade, which operated in dozens of small home-based workrooms engaged in sweated labour. It was the leadership of Rocker among his Jewish anarchist field workers that was to register a powerful defeat on the sweatshop &#145;bosses&#146; in the London clothing trade. He dedicated himself to a threefold task: to organize and improve conditions among the immigrant Jewish workers; to implement more positive social and political relations between English and foreign Jewish labour within the trade union movement; and, finally, to undertake the broader aim of educating all workers in the libertarian socialist creed that would lead them towards the anarchist goal.<br>
<br>Induction into the East End Jewish group was facilitated through Rocker's friend, Millie Witkop (1877&#150;1955), who became his wife in 1924. He became a welcome guest among the Jewish anarchists who met in the Sugar Loaf public house in Whitechapel's Hanbury Street. He was struck by the contrast between the Parisian Jews and those in the East End. The former were mostly skilled artisans, well fed and clothed, while the latter looked &#145;sad, worn and half starved&#146;, who, none the less, followed with rapt attention the speakers and discussions that opened up to them the vision of the new society. They soon surrendered to this young burly German who exuded warmth and generosity; and were overjoyed when he spoke to them in their own language, Yiddish. He had only recently mastered this, and it led to the extraordinary phenomenon of a gentile being offered the post of editor of the Yiddish political journal, the new <span class="italic">Arbeter Fraint</span>, in October 1898. The revived publication achieved an international reputation in both libertarian and social-democratic circles.<h2>
<a name="TheJubileeStreetClubandpoliticalactivism19061914"></a>The Jubilee Street Club and political activism, 1906&#150;1914</h2>The years 1898&#150;1914 were lean ones for the children of the ghetto. The Kishinyov pogrom in 1903 and the 1905 Russian Revolution brought new waves of immigrants and their incumbent problems. They also, not unnaturally, evoked a high peak of social and political agitation. Rocker was resolved on the parallel duties of teaching and organizing his people and saw the need for a permanent educational institution in order to implement this. In Jubilee Street, in the heart of the Jewish quarter, an old Salvation Army depot was taken over and transformed. The project was financed by the accumulated pennies of the slaves of the sweatshops, many of whom contributed most of their weekly pittance. On a Jewish sabbath, 3 February 1906, the anarchist club was opened by the doyen of all anarchists, Prince Peter Kropotkin, who, although seriously ill, felt compelled to give this unique venture his personal blessing. The Jubilee Street Club was a large building containing two halls; one on the ground floor supported a gallery that could hold 800 people; the other on the second floor housed a library and reading-room with classroom accommodation in side chambers. Rocker emerged as one of the pioneers of London adult education. The institute was thrown open to all workers, whatever their creed or gender. Courses included English for the new immigrant, history, sociology, and public speakers' classes, and on Sundays, Rocker conducted groups to the British Museum. Meanwhile a small adjoining building housed the presses of the <span class="italic">Arbeter Fraint</span>. It was here that Rocker mobilized his immigrant forces for the assault on the tailoring sweatshops.<br>
<br>The complications inherent in the domestic-based sweatshops became clear to Rocker. Hundreds of small master tailors were subcontractors for large city firms, and in order to obtain a contract, underbid each other mercilessly. Their workers, consequently, were poorly paid, particularly the new and relatively unskilled immigrants. Before the First World War immigration swelled the numbers seeking employment, ensuring a steady supply of cheap labour for the masters. The more enterprising workers, on learning their craft, aspired to become <i>meisters</i> themselves, and a jungle of cut-throat competition for jobs and outwork perpetuated the system.<br>
<br>A growing militancy among the tailors culminated in the strike of 1906, with the employers conceding a ten and a half hour working day and the abolition of piece-work to be substituted by a daily wage rate. It proved a false victory for the employees. The use of blackleg labour, easily obtained, and an inadequate strike fund meant a rapid return to pre-strike conditions, but the causes of failure were not lost on Rocker. In May 1912 came his moment of opportunity. The London Society of Tailors was backing a strike of 1500 West End tailors, a highly skilled and internationally reputed labour &eacute;lite. Rocker knew that the East End workshops would be used to produce the work left idle, and if the strike failed, the East End tailors would, rightfully, stand accused as enemies of trade unionism. Antisemitism lay beneath the surface ready to erupt. Rocker was resolved that it was his moral duty to smash the system there and then, and on 10 May he opened his attack in the <span class="italic">Arbeter Fraint</span>, explaining the situation to the immigrant tailors, calling on them to back the strikers. His personal plea evoked an immediate response. A meeting held in the old assembly hall in Mile End was packed to overflowing&#151;over 11,000 workers awaited the word from their leaders. James MacDonald, chairman of the London Trades Council, demanded that it was imperative that they act immediately. It was Rocker, however, speaking in their native Yiddish, who convinced them. The vote was taken in tense silence. The impossible happened. Not one voted against strike action.<br>
<br>In two days 13,000 workmen quit their workshops. They faced starvation and it was the task of the strike committee to collect funds to sustain them. Rocker was appointed chairman of the finance committee and expended his herculean energy day and night to raise money. The East End rallied to aid the strikers: higher-grade workers refused strike pay and lived on their savings; the Jewish Bakers' Union and the cigarette makers provided free supplies. Strike funds were enhanced by a voluntary levy placed on other Jewish trade unionists. Special performances by the Yiddish theatre and an inflow of contributions from outside sympathizers enabled Rocker to pay the strikers a few shillings each during the first week. The master tailors, assured that there was no permanent strike fund, answered with a three-week lock-out. They were convinced that hunger would quickly bring the workers back on any terms, but under Rocker's leadership they held fast. A parallel struggle helped maintain their morale, as their docker neighbours were involved in the great London dock strike. Suffering made strange bedfellows and Rocker was quick to use the opportunity to bring Jewish and gentile workers together. He addressed joint strike meetings and was the inspiring force in organizing vast joint demonstrations in the Whitechapel Waste and at Tower Hill. Their resources almost gone, their families facing the realities of hunger, the tailors still held out, but only just. In the third week the West End tailors reached a settlement. The employers acquiesced in their main demands: no piece-work, reduced hours of employment limited to union members only.<br>
<br>This was a psychological blow at the right time for the cause as a whole. The concept of a negotiated settlement was now accepted by both sides in the women's garment industry, since both were getting desperate. The Masters Association was facing the fact that its seasonal trade was almost ruined; the workers had no funds left. The masters agreed to meet their demands on working hours and pay, but refused to consider a unionized closed-shop. To Rocker the last was the point of the conflict. Union recognition was top priority for the workers' security, their strongest weapon in future disputes. A final meeting was called in the Pavilion Theatre, Whitechapel Road, to settle the question. Facing a mass of &#145;pinched, hungry faces&#146;, it was Rocker's powerful plea that decided the issue. There was a burst of applause and from all sides came the cry &#145;The strike goes on!&#146;<br>
<br>The next morning the master tailors capitulated. All the workers' terms were agreed to. Rocker and his immigrants had dealt a severe blow to the sweatshop system, which no act of parliament could have rendered. Moreover, he had brought about a more congenial relationship between Jewish and gentile workers. The incidence of the contemporary dock strike by Anglo-Irish dockers, which persisted after the tailors' settlement, helped cement the new relationship. The view associating the immigrants with strike breaking was now invalidated. At their hour of victory they rallied to help the dockers' families. A trade union committee of aid was set up and the <span class="italic">Arbeter Fraint</span> enjoined its readers to succour the children. Offers of accommodation and gifts poured in from Jewish people, many of whom could hardly feed themselves. Rocker and his partner Millie personally collected children from the docks, and local retailers subscribed clothing and shoes. Dockers, trade unionists, and social workers spoke of the warmth and hospitality accorded to their unfortunate charges by the East End Jews. Over 300 children were taken into their homes while the strike endured, laying the foundation of enduring friendships. The &#145;hungry thirties&#146; registered its fulfilment. It was the dockers of Wapping and St George's who were part of the militant vanguard which, on 4 October 1936, forcibly prevented the Mosleyite incursion into east London.<h2>
<a name="ConflictinEurope19141933"></a>Conflict in Europe, 1914&#150;1933</h2>Perhaps 1914 proved the high-water mark in Rocker's London years. That year registered the climax of anarchist intercession which, thenceforth, rapidly declined. In 1915 the <span class="italic">Arbeter Fraint</span> was suppressed and the anarchist club closed by police. Rocker himself was interned as an &#145;enemy alien&#146; on 2 December 1914. His removal from the scene was a decisive blow to the London movement from which it never recovered.<br>
<br>In March 1918 Rocker was released under a prisoner exchange agreement and together with his partner, Millie, and son, Fermin, after a short stay in Holland, settled in Berlin. The next fifteen years would see him as activist and writer involved in a marginalized syndicalist group. He was arrested for a short period in January 1920 by orders from Noske, Social Democratic minister of defence, then engaged in incarcerating left-wing revolutionaries and closing their presses. Here his libertarian ideas came to maturity. These encapsulated anti-statism and nationalism; the latter redefined as a state religion which inevitably perpetuated a violent authoritarianism. Rocker himself eschewed violence substituting direct action through a collectivity of workers in trade unions whose ultimate weapon was the general strike.<br>
<br>During the 1920s he contributed many articles to the <span class="italic">Syndikalist</span> and this period was marked by conflict in print and on the streets, first with the communists (Rocker early presaged the totalitarian dangers inherent in the Bolshevik takeover in Russia), and later with the Nazis. At the same time he embarked on writing his great classic <span class="italic">Nationalism and Culture</span>, in which he analysed the concept of the state and its prime aid, religion (&#145;All politics are, in the last resort, religion&#146;). When, in September 1930, the Nazis had gained over 6 million votes and 107 seats in the Reichstag, Rocker realized that the Nazis would achieve power and informed his comrades that &#145;We'll all go the way of Landauer and Eisner&#146;, both of whom had been assassinated by the Nazis' forebears. His prophecies were soon validated. On 4 March 1933 he and Millie, warned of his imminent arrest by the Gestapo, crossed the Swiss frontier with their son to freedom. After a short stay with the doyenne anarchist Emma Goldman, the Rockers went to London, where Rocker received a rapturous welcome especially by his old Jewish comrades as well as by other trade union and labour organizations. By then he had come to accept the fact that he was at the end of his own physical efforts to combat the Nazi&#150;fascist takeover in Europe.<h2>
<a name="Writingandlaterlife19331958"></a>Writing and later life, 1933&#150;1958</h2>On 27 August 1933 the Rockers emigrated to New York. Here Rudolf embarked on a final career both as a writer and coast-to-coast lecturer across the USA and Canada, addressing vast audiences on the dangers of racialism and especially of political authoritarianism be it from the left or right. It was a time to complete his major philosophical tome, <span class="italic">Nationalism and Culture</span>, first published in 1937 in New York. It was immediately accepted by diverse critics as an original contribution to political philosophy in the context of the first libertarian analysis of the development of nationalism and its relationship to the growth of the western state. As the original translator from the German (Professor Roy E. Chase, Los Angeles, March 1937) noted:<blockquote>It is at once a scholarly survey and analysis of human culture and human institutions throughout the range of known history and an eloquent political, often passionate expression of the writer about all of the contents of the realm he surveys.</blockquote>Bertrand Russell praised it as a masterpiece in the genre, and it was followed in 1938 by his second classic, <span class="italic">Anarcho-Syndicalism</span>, published in London. The latter was a synthesis of anarchism and syndicalism. A recent biographer of Rocker regards this contribution as providing &#145;syndicalism with a theoretical foundation which it previously lacked&#146; and, above all, it &#145;turned syndicalism into a philosophy and way of life&#146;  (Graur, 12).<br>
<br>Rocker's last years found him settled in a colony, set up by old comrades at Lake Mohegan, ensconced in a bungalow bought for him by his main admirers, the Jewish tailoring workers in New York. Rocker continued with his lectures and contributions to various anarchist journals, mainly written in German and Yiddish, to the end. He died on 10 September 1958 at his son's home at 258 Riverside Drive, New York, and his ashes were scattered in the woods behind Lake Mohegan. He was mourned especially by those Jewish immigrants among whom he was already a legend. As Herbert Read suggests, for them his was a case of &#145;sympathetic identification&#146; and shows &#145;that where love and humanity prevail divisions of race and creed are of no significance. If only as a demonstration of this great truth, Rocker's books will always live&#146;  (Rocker, <span class="italic">London Years</span>, foreword, 14).<br>
