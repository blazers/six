<span class="headword">Davies,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1635, <em>d.</em> 1708), <span class="occ">Quaker preacher and autobiographer</span>, was baptized on 22 March 1635 at Welshpool, Montgomeryshire, the son of Edward Davies. The name of his mother is unknown.<br>
<br>Richard Davies's parents had a small estate and he was given &#145;a little learning&#146;  (Davies, 13). Brought up an Anglican, at twelve or thirteen he was troubled concerning the state of his soul. He attached himself to the Independents (fairly numerous in the area), attended their meetings in various parishes, and even wrote some of their sermons. He was bound apprentice to a felt maker of the same persuasion but he soon eagerly espoused the beliefs of a visiting Quaker. His lifelong convincement had begun. The fury of the Independents was unabated (for Davies's apostasy was not exceptional), especially that of his master's wife, who severely assaulted him because he addressed her in &#145;the pure language of <i>Thee</i> and <i>Thou</i>&#146;  (ibid., 25). Ostracized by relations, neighbours, and former friends, he was overwhelmed by depression and he long remembered sitting &#145;under an ash tree, weeping and mourning&#146;  (ibid., 35). A handful of kindred spirits, widely scattered and without a home of their own, held meetings on the sheltered side of a hill. As occasionally happened to Friends, they were looked upon as witches.<br>
<br>Apprenticeship completed, Davies settled in his trade in London, where he married a Quaker at the Horselydown meeting, Southwark, on 26 June 1659. She died in 1705, and may be the Tace Davies who signed the Quaker women's petition against tithes in 1659. However, Davies became convinced that God intended him to bear witness in Wales and to Welshpool he returned with his wife. They were later compared to Zacharias and Elisabeth &#145;walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless&#146;  (Davies, 52). There speedily followed bouts of imprisonment, for instance in Montgomery in 1660 and in Shrewsbury in 1661. They did not, however, last long in his case. Seldom a &#145;close&#146; prisoner, he was usually allowed almost unlimited freedom, which he used to great effect.<br>
<br>Davies was a central figure in the monthly meetings of north Wales Quakers, notably at Dolobran, Meifod parish, Montgomeryshire, where Quakers were relatively strong. He was one of the foremost apostles of Quakerism in Wales, often preaching in Welsh, an indispensable requirement if Quakerism was to prosper in Wales. At Whitehall he spoke Welsh to his countryman, the querulous secretary of state, Sir Leoline Jenkins, concerning the first appearance of Christianity in the British Isles. He was one of two selected to distribute devotional books sent to Wales from Devonshire House and it was he who successfully pressed for a measure of devolution whereby Welsh Friends had their own yearly meetings.<br>
<br>In confrontations with high and low, Davies avoided the self-righteous admonitions not infrequently delivered with gusto by some early Quakers. His calm, courteous demeanour tended to disarm antagonists, but there was more to it than sanctified tact. It was his shining sincerity. He may not have entirely won the day with Edward, third Baron Herbert of Cherbury, but he was on the best of terms with Bishop William Lloyd of St Asaph (later one of the &#145;Seven Bishops&#146;). Although his exchanges at Whitehall with Leoline Jenkins began badly, they concluded cordially, Jenkins thereafter apparently moderating his asperity towards Quakers. At Oxford in 1706 unruly students interrupted a Quaker meeting, but having heard Davies they sobered down, some remaining until the end of the proceedings.<br>
<br>Davies consulted lawyers in order to discover loopholes in the law. Thomas Corbet, &#145;the Welch counsellor&#146;  (Davies, 104), as he became known, a barrister who lived in Davies's neighbourhood, often advised him. Corbet was largely instrumental in securing George Fox's release from Worcester gaol in 1675, having argued in Westminster Hall before Sir Matthew Hale and others that no one should be imprisoned upon the writ of <i>praemunire</i>, which had long oppressed Quakers. Fox acknowledged Davies's role in arranging for Corbet to act on his behalf.<br>
<br>Davies was well known to English Friends. He attended meetings in the Severn and the Thames valleys, frequently accompanied, as elsewhere, by his daughter Tace. On one occasion he was away from home for three months. To London Friends he was a familiar figure. His reputation was such that the yearly meeting of Friends in England appointed him one of twelve to wait upon Queen Anne at Windsor to thank her for the continued protection of Friends. Davies, it seems, was the chief spokesman. He was one of thirteen who signed the frame of government for Pennsylvania drawn up by Penn.<br>
<br>In his autobiography Davies says little concerning the exodus of Quakers from Wales to Pennsylvania, much in the minds of Friends from 1681 onwards. Yet we know that he bought 5000 acres there, subsequently reselling them to Friends in small parcels. Presumably he was acting as agent for prospective emigrants. Why he did not himself leave cannot now be determined. Perhaps, like other Friends, he was hostile to the migration which denuded Welsh Quakers at home of several of their sturdier members.<br>
<br>Another matter invites speculation. Quakers and Roman Catholics were not natural allies, especially when also divided by a social chasm. Nevertheless, Richard Davies spoke of the first marquess of Powis, the premier Catholic aristocrat, and his wife as &#145;my particular friends&#146;  (Davies, 98). At Powis Castle he sought the aid of the marquess, who allowed him to use his name to curb the excesses of a justice of the peace who had maltreated Friends. Davies called upon him, too, at his home in Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1685 to be advised concerning the sufferings of Friends. This he did after &#145;I had ended my country business with him&#146;  (ibid., 127), which may mean that Davies had some oversight, hitherto unrevealed, of Powis's estate. Even so, it was an intriguing relationship.<br>
<br>There is no known likeness of Davies, but one Friend recalled &#145;his gravity and grey hairs, his manly presence, and lovely countenance, especially when he stood up in a meeting&#146;  (Davies, 11). A 1667 halfpenny trade token of his as felt maker has survived. Glowing testimonies to his memory by Friends provide few hard facts. A brief tribute by his daughter Tace is more informative, indicating, in addition, that sweetness of disposition had been transmitted from one generation to another. Davies's true memorial is his autobiography, which first appeared in 1710; nine editions followed and a translation into Welsh in 1840.<br>
<br>At an unspecified date, Davies moved a short distance from Welshpool to Cloddiau Cochion. He died at his home there on 22 March 1708 and on 25 March was laid to rest close to his wife in the nearby burial-ground which he had helped to secure for Friends.<br>
