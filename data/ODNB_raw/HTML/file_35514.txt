<span class="headword">Phillips,  Stephen</span>  (1864&#150;1915), <span class="occ">poet and playwright</span>, was born on 28 July 1864 at Albert Villa, George Street, Summertown, Oxford, the eldest of the thirteen children of Stephen Phillips (<i>b</i>. 1837), precentor of Peterborough Cathedral, and his wife, Agatha Sophia (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Dockray), a relative of the Wordsworths. Phillips's relationship with his father was strained; from his mother he inherited a feeling for poetry and the contemplative melancholy that was the keynote of his life and poems. He attended Trinity College School, Stratford upon Avon; then, for six months, King's School, Peterborough; and finally Oundle School (1878&#150;83). A morose boy, Phillips was unpopular at school and despised his teachers. He had no capacity for mathematics or science, but delighted in the Greek and Latin classics. Although he was recommended for a minor scholarship in classics at Queens' College, Cambridge, he prepared instead for the civil service at a crammer run by W. B. Scoones in London. One of the staff, John Churton Collins, encouraged Phillips's interest in poetry, which resulted in the privately printed <span class="italic">Orestes and Other Poems</span> (1884).<br>
<br>In the spring of 1885 Phillips travelled to Wolverhampton to join the theatrical company managed by his cousin F. R. Benson. His histrionic assets were mostly physical, although he possessed a beautiful voice and elocution. He stood an imposing 6 feet 4 inches and had auburn hair and large, intense blue eyes. He resembled Benson, and could double for him. Phillips's strong sense of humour, love of practical jokes, and gift for mimicry meant that this resemblance was exploited in off-stage imitation. Like Benson, he was a keen cricketer. The constant repetition involved in acting bored him, especially in such small roles as Hastings in <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, Gremio in <span class="italic">The Taming of the Shrew</span>, or Snake in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>. However, he was a notable Ghost in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, attempted an unusual Iago, and played Prospero in <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> (when he amused himself by using his wand as a fishing rod over the orchestra pit). In the same production he fell in love with one of the ballet dancers, May Lidyard (1874/5&#150;1948), daughter of Henry Lidyard, a builder. He married her on 28 March 1892 and she was a devoted wife, even though Phillips's drinking excesses and philandering finally forced a separation. They had two children, Persephone (<i>b</i>. 1897), who died in infancy, and Stephen (<i>b</i>. 1899). Phillips commemorated both children in the poem &#145;A Gleam&#146;.<br>
<br>While acting Phillips began writing plays with the notion of restoring poetic drama to the stage, but the play he offered for Benson's consideration met with a silent rebuff. More profitable was his friendship with his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31890/', "Laurence Binyon")</script>, who discerned Phillips's poetic talent and devised a scheme whereby they would each write a poem a week and then compare notes. They published <span class="italic">Primavera: Poems by Four Authors</span> in 1890, with Manmohan Ghose and A. S. Cripps as their collaborators. Phillips's contributions, &#145;To a Lost Love&#146; and &#145;A Dream&#146;, exhibit a lyrical mood rather than any dramatic impulse.<br>
<br>Phillips left Benson in 1892 and for a time earned a living as a history lecturer at an army tutorial school near London run by Messrs Wolffram and Needham. His heart was in his poetry, however. In 1894 he published <span class="italic">Eremus</span>, whose theme and texture anticipated <span class="italic">Christ in Hades</span>, published in 1897 as part of a series edited by Laurence Binyon. However, it was the success of <span class="italic">Poems</span> in 1897 which persuaded Phillips to become a full-time writer, a decision rendered easier by the 100-guinea prize with which <span class="italic">The Academy</span>, in 1898, crowned the volume for its outstanding merit. <span class="italic">Poems</span> includes &#145;The Apparition&#146;, &#145;Christ in Hades&#146;, &#145;Marpessa&#146;, and &#145;The Wife&#146;, four distinctive non-dramatic poems which illustrate Phillips's gift for charging lyric or narrative matter with dramatic sense.<br>
<br>The success of <span class="italic">Poems</span> led also to a commission from George Alexander for a poetic play for the St James's Theatre. However, unavoidable delays in casting <span class="italic">Paolo and Francesca</span>, the play Phillips wrote, meant that it appeared first in book form. It was greeted with almost unanimous praise, although Max Beerbohm sniffed, &#145;It seemed to me very delicate, very smooth, wholly derivative. It might have been the work of a beautiful, etherialised sixth-form boy with an instinct for the stage&#146;  (Beerbohm, 316). Eagerness to see it played was increased by the success both in the theatre (1900) and in print (1901) of <span class="italic">Herod</span>, which H. B. Tree staged with his usual pictorial sumptuousness at Her Majesty's. When <span class="italic">Paolo and Francesca</span>, which boasted seven Bensonians in its cast, was eventually performed in 1902, Phillips was hailed as the successor of Sophocles and Shakespeare, and his royalties amounted to &pound;150 per week. The play contains some effectively poetic lines, but characterization and motivation are thin, while hyperbole and bombast abound. Nevertheless, it ran for 134 performances, two more than Phillips's next piece, <span class="italic">Ulysses</span>, an even more pictorial work than <span class="italic">Herod</span>, on which Tree lavished his attention in 1902.<br>
<br>Phillips was still at his apogee when Tree staged the loosely constructed, rhetoric-charged <span class="italic">Nero</span> in 1906. Tellingly, Phillips told Hesketh Pearson, &#145;I wrote <span class="italic">Paolo and Francesca</span> for love, <span class="italic">Herod</span> for popularity, <span class="italic">Ulysses</span> for money, and <span class="italic">Nero</span> for all three&#146;  (Pearson, 142). From then on he was driven by the need for money, which slipped through his fingers as a result of his generosity and dissipation. He preferred &#145;the company of rougher and ruder individualities&#146;  (H. D. Phillips, 215), and revelled in slumming in London's East End. Profit was the motive for his collaboration with J. Comyns Carr on <span class="italic">Faust</span> in 1908, and in the same year he dramatized Scott's novel <span class="italic">The Bride of Lammermoor</span> (also known as <span class="italic">The Last Heir</span>). By 1909 he was already separated from his long-suffering wife, whom he had deserted for his mistress and secretary, variously known as Greta Hyam and Margaret H. Jerome, under which name she wrote about him; she was probably the journalist Margaret Heimann (1887/8&#150;1940), of Swiss origin, recorded in the census of 1911. In that year Phillips was forced into bankruptcy with liabilities of &pound;710. In the previous year he had squandered over &pound;1100. <span class="italic">Pietro of Siena</span>, a pale imitation of his first (and best) play, did nothing to revive his fortunes in 1910: it received just one performance. <span class="italic">Iole</span> in 1913 managed only two performances. The following year Phillips dusted off an earlier work, <span class="italic">The Sin of David</span>, which had been first performed in Germany in 1905. Because of the censor's ban on biblical subjects, Phillips transposed this story of David, Bathsheba, and Uriah to Cromwellian England, but with little success. His last staged work was <span class="italic">Armageddon</span> (1915), a series of revue sketches notable only for their patriotism.<br>
<br>While enjoying success in the theatre Phillips had not abandoned poetry entirely. In 1908 he brought out <span class="italic">New Poems</span>, which confirmed suspicions that his reputation was overblown. His longest poem, <span class="italic">The New Inferno</span> (1911), is a clumsily constructed series of overdrawn pictures illustrating trite moral texts. Better, with its flashes of Phillips's old spontaneity, was <span class="italic">Lyrics and Dramas</span> (1913), but his themes remained commonplace. His last volume, <span class="italic">Panama and other Poems</span> (1915), is better forgotten. A brighter facet of Phillips's later career was his editorship of the <span class="italic">Poetry Review</span> from January 1913 until his death.<br>
<br>Shortly before his death Phillips completed <span class="italic">Harold</span>, a verse play about the Norman conquest, having completed a scenario for one on John the Baptist. In mid-October 1915 he fell seriously ill after suffering a severe chill. He died at Goodwin Cottage, Griffin Street, Deal, Kent, where he was living, on 9 December 1915, of cirrhosis of the liver and exhaustion. His funeral service at St Clement's Church, Hastings, was conducted by his brother the Revd David Phillips, and attended by his wife and son, and his friend the actor Martin Harvey. Phillips was buried in the cemetery at Hastings on 13 December. He died intestate and worth a nominal &pound;5.<br>
<br>For ten years Phillips was accorded film-star status, which disappeared as quickly as it came. It is difficult now to see much intrinsic merit in his work, and easier to perceive how derivative his poetry was (as several contemporaries also indicated). Nevertheless, the response to his plays reveals that Phillips was alive to that theatrical taste which embraced the spectacular, the romantic, and the melodramatic, cloaked in easy-going pseudo-Elizabethan verse. That Phillips failed to capitalize on his successes is indicative of his indolent nature, his lack of true talent, and his predilection for strong drink.<br>
