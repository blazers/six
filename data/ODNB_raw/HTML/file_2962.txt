<span class="headword">Botley,  Samuel</span>  (1640/41&#150;1677), <span class="occ">stenographer</span>, was a son of Robert Botley, citizen of London and cordwainer. The year of his birth has been calculated from the engraved portrait by William Dolle in the first edition of the shorthand manual for which Botley is chiefly remembered, <span class="italic">Maximum in minimo</span> (first published in late 1674 or more probably early 1675), which gives his age as thirty-three in 1674. Samuel, who was made free of the Cordwainers' Company by patrimony on 12 April 1662, does not appear to have followed his father's profession, and from at least 1668 and probably until 1672 was employed as a messenger in the chamber in the lord chamberlain's department. According to both Botley's <span class="italic">Maximum in minimo</span> (1675?), sig. K2, and the burial record for their daughter Mary in the register of St Thomas the Apostle, London, on 4 November 1677, his wife's name was Hannah, but nothing else is known of her.<br>
<br>By no later than 1673 Botley was teaching the shorthand system invented by Jeremiah Rich (1630?&#150;1667?), with whom he appears to have had some particular connection, at his house in Thames Street, London, adjacent to Vintners Hall, and subsequently at Colonel Mason's coffee house in Cornhill, London. Botley was among those who subscribed to the publication of later editions of Rich's shorthand edition of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> (1673, 1675) and was supplying both this and Rich's shorthand version of the metrical psalms of Sterngold and Hopkins, <span class="italic">The Whole Book of Psalms in Meter</span> (1673), from his house in Thames Street. Although in his introduction to <span class="italic">Maximum in minimo</span> (1675?) Botley addresses scholars in &#145;London, Bristol and Exeter&#146;, it is not known that he himself ever visited the west country, and his treatise may have been designed, at least in part, to foster an early form of distance learning. <span class="italic">Maximum in minimo</span> was simply a reissue of Jeremiah Rich's <span class="italic">The Penns Dexterity</span> to which Botley had added his own contribution of &#145;the whole Terms of the Law in Mr Rich's Character Compleated&#146;; there were at least five subsequent reprints or editions, several of which feature re-engraved versions of William Dolle's original portrait.<br>
<br>On 15 October 1677, according to the register of St James Garlickhythe, Botley died of a gastrointestinal obstruction and was buried in the neighbouring parish of St Thomas the Apostle, Thames Street, London, on 18 October 1677.<br>
