<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Finlay,  George</span>  (1799&#150;1875), <span class="occ">philhellene and historian</span>, the younger son of Major John Finlay RE FRS (1757&#150;1802) and Helen (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Thomson) and the grandson of James Finlay, a Glasgow merchant, was born on 21 December 1799 at Faversham, Kent. His father died in 1802, and in 1805 his mother married Alexander McGregor. Finlay was educated first at home and then at a Liverpool boarding-school. When his stepfather had to go to America on business, Finlay went to live with his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9467/', "Kirkman Finlay")</script> at Castle Toward in Argyll and was educated privately with his cousins. From 1819 to 1821 he shared the cultural activities of Glasgow and read law at the university there. He then continued his studies at G&ouml;ttingen University. Here he came into contact with enthusiasts for the movement to liberate Greece from Ottoman rule.<br>
<br>Finlay's philhellene interests prompted him to abandon legal studies and go to Greece. He reached Zante in 1823 and joined a group of philhellenes assembling in Cephalonia. But they were said to be infringing the neutrality of the Ionian Islands (then under British protection) and had to move to the Greek mainland. Here they became involved in the tangled politics of the revolutionary movement. In December 1823 Finlay reached Athens, where he met Frank Abney Hastings, whom he greatly admired. Acting as intermediary in central Greece (Rumeli) between the western Rumeliots and Odysseus Androutzos, leader of the eastern Rumeliots, he went to Mesolonghi, where in February 1824 he and Byron enjoyed long literary conversations. With Androutzos, Finlay participated in an unsuccessful expedition against the Peloponnese aimed at establishing a single revolutionary party. Incensed at the cruelty and rapacity he found, Finlay transferred his allegiance to the western Rumeliots and Alexander Mavrocordatos (Byron had died on 19 April 1824). Finlay was taken desperately ill in late 1824 and left Greece to recover in Italy.<br>
<br>In 1825 Finlay returned to Scotland and he completed his legal studies (1825&#150;6) but, pressed by philhellene friends, he returned to Greece in 1826 in Hastings's steamship <i>Karteria</i>, and for a time settled in Aegina. With the support of the three powers, Russia, France, and Britain, the Greek right to form an independent kingdom was recognized and the boundary, after much dispute, ran from Arta to Volos. While serving as a volunteer on the <i>Karteria</i>, Finlay met the American philhellene Samuel Gridley Howe. He joined him in aiding refugees, first on Aegina, then in Howe's supposedly model village near Corinth. In 1829 he went to Constantinople, where his friend Julius Millingen lived. Here he acquired a wife, Nectar Trevinian, an Armenian living in Pera. He does not mention this in his journal but the naval officer and author Adolphus Slade gives a racy account in one of his travel books of how the couple eloped in a merchant brig and got married at Syros <i>en route</i> for Aegina. In 1831 Finlay took Nectar to Britain to visit his relatives. His only child, Helen, was born at Exeter on the way north.<br>
<br>Before leaving Greece, Finlay had acquired property in Athens, the future capital, and his own house was in the quarter of Hadrianou; in 1832 he brought his wife, child, and the companion Miss Grocott back to live permanently in Hadrianou. Finlay also had fifteen farms at Liosia in Attica which he meant to cultivate himself but had to give up, frustrated by the crippling system of taxation and the disturbed countryside. He had a special interest in the development of the kingdom and his writings reveal activity at a high level. He was at King Otho's hunting and dinner parties (in Albanian dress) but as a liberal was never really in favour at court, though he was commissioned captain, then major, <i>&agrave; la suite</i>, a commission which he tried unsuccessfully to resign. In July 1834 he was appointed &#145;commissionaire extraordinaire&#146; to the nomarch of Athens in matters concerning the development of the new capital but in November resigned in despair at perpetual frustrations. Nevertheless, in his own way he continued to promote both cultural and material progress. The university, the library, and the archaeological society were indebted to him for untiring canvassing for support, outside as well as within Greece. He got Edwin Chadwick to make excellent suggestions for a water system for Athens (which were, however, not adopted).<br>
<br>From June to September 1835 Finlay went as a volunteer under the command of his friend Thomas Gordon to suppress brigandage in central Greece. His journal admirably fills out the brief three-page account of this in his <span class="italic">History</span> (7.158&#150;61): Finlay's observant eye took in not only military hazards in a difficult region, but the economic condition of villages and towns and local reaction to Bavarian government, and he could not contain his exuberant appreciation of the splendid mountainous terrain and the striking flora. Like his father, he was a naturalist as well as being concerned with climatic variations and archaeological remains. Finlay's next major expedition was a private venture in 1837 among the islands of the Cyclades with the scholars Ludwig Ross and Karl Ritter. In addition to his usual topographical and archaeological interests he analysed current economic and social conditions island by island, showing that there was prosperity together with widespread discontent with the government. When he was in Athens he explored Attica with problems of classical history in mind, making meticulous notes which were of special interest to his friend the topographer and numismatist W. Martin Leake.<br>
<br>From 1840 onwards Finlay's major travels were outside the Greek kingdom. He visited Britain and France from 1842 to 1843, missing the threatened rising in Athens in 1843. Then he went to Britain again in 1851 and 1854, when his mother was ill. On all occasions he combined seeing scattered relatives with visits to friends and politicians including Palmerston, to whom he emphasized the pressing needs of Greece. In late 1845 and early 1846 he explored Egypt, Palestine, and Syria, and his journal details travel conditions and local topography, as well as describing the spectacular Egyptian court and shrewdly commenting on the old fox Mehmet Ali. After 1846 Finlay still continued to write up his travels but left nothing like the many informal political comments of earlier journals. From 2 May to 27 July 1850 he visited Ottoman territory in northern Greece and Asia Minor. His journal entry on Trebizond is valuable as a record of material which has since vanished. In the spring of 1853 he went to Rhodes, Kos, Samos, and Chios, making notes on Ottoman administration with a special entry on the monastery Nea Mone in central Chios and its <i>hegumenos</i>, who spoke fluent English. In 1858 he was in northern mainland territory, including Volos as well as the islands Skiathos and Skopelos. But his foreign interests centred increasingly on Switzerland, whose constitution he greatly admired. In later life, despite chronic illness, he continued to travel: he visited Vichy and Switzerland in 1859, and Switzerland again in 1868 and 1869, an antiquarian and numismatist as keen as ever and delighted to meet once more his many old friends.<br>
<br>Finlay's travel journals should not overshadow his activities in Athens. His unceasing concern was to emphasize the need for sound local and central administration with a workable economic system, and from the outset he had pressed for a national bank. From 1836 to 1850 he fought for fair compensation for his land arbitrarily appropriated for royal purposes. He took an active interest in the constant political crises occasioned by Russian&#150;Ottoman relations, the Greek irredentist movement of the Great Idea (of which he disapproved), the Cretan rebellions of 1841 and 1867&#150;9 (which he supported), the Dilessi murders (1870) involving his friends the Noels, and conflicting Slav ambitions in the Balkans (he wrote an extremely well-informed article on the Bulgarian church for <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>). At the same time Finlay had his place in the everyday life of the community. Though brought up a Presbyterian, he admired &#145;the divine worship&#146; of the English church service and he took a prominent part in the establishment of the Anglican church of St Paul in Athens. He appreciated a good sermon and when in Geneva or Z&uuml;rich attended the &#145;Scotch&#146; church. Though not particularly theologically minded, he could yet enjoy discussing Calvin and Luther with Swiss friends. He freely admitted that he had no aptitude for metaphysics; what most interested him was the nature of the state and the place of justice in the polity.<br>
<br>Finlay has long been known for his <span class="italic">History</span> of the Greek people from 146 <span class="smallcap">BC</span> to <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 1864, providing a particularly valuable contemporary source in volumes 6 and 7 not yet fully exploited. This should be supplemented by the copious material in Athens. Finlay was a keen critic but could also praise. The frequently ignored medieval volumes should not be swept aside as entirely outmoded, as they anticipate certain modern revisions and emphasize the importance of social and economic conditions as distinct from central politics. Letters and reviews received on the publication of the medieval east Mediterranean volumes indicate nineteenth-century interest in the east Roman Empire well before the day of J. B. Bury.<br>
<br>In the past Finlay has been misrepresented largely because he dramatized himself, belittling his activities, and he was taken at face value particularly by William Miller, who quoted him as declaring, for example, in 1859 that he had &#145;entirely ceased working&#146; and lived &#145;in complete retirement&#146;  (Finlay MSS, 396). Nothing is further from the truth. Finlay's Swiss journals of 1859, 1868, and 1869 reveal a genial and sociable, though keenly critical companion with a wide circle of friends, busily revising his <span class="italic">History</span> and pursuing antiquarian interests. Miller's misleading presentation of Finlay as a &#145;twice disappointed man&#146;  (ibid.) was challenged at the Finlay centenary celebrations, a revision strikingly supported by the subsequent discovery of the Noel-Baker collection of Finlay's letters, 125 of which are to Alice, the daughter of Finlay's friend Edward Noel. These cover her progress from childhood to maturity during the years 1855 to 1873, detail the domestic life of the Finlay and Noel households, and portray a genial if somewhat sardonic man who liked and got on with children and had not been soured by the tragic death of his only child in 1841. At the age of sixty-four he could still enjoy pantomimes, charades, and Christmas parties. There was a very human element behind the scholar, antiquarian, and lifelong philhellene. Finlay died on 26 January 1875 at Hadrianou and was buried in the first cemetery at Athens.<br>
