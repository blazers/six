<span class="headword">Bramwell,  William</span>  (1759&#150;1818), <span class="occ">Methodist preacher</span>, was born in Elswick, Lancashire, in February 1759, the tenth of eleven children of George Bramwell, a farmer, and his wife, Elizabeth, devout Anglicans. After a village education William was apprenticed to a Liverpool merchant in 1775, then to a Preston currier. After being converted while receiving communion he joined the Methodists, met John Wesley, and began to preach, one of his early converts being Ann Cutler (1759&#150;1794). In 1786&#150;7 he became an itinerant preacher in Kent, but then served mainly in northern towns. In July 1787 Bramwell married Ellen Byrom (<i>d</i>. 1828); they had four children.<br>
<br>Bramwell was the most successful Wesleyan revivalist of his generation, particularly in the Yorkshire revival of 1792&#150;6. He used groups to pray for those undergoing conversion. Having received the gift of &#145;entire sanctification&#146; he forcefully preached the possibility of receiving this instantaneously by faith, which, with the emotional scenes in his meetings, recalled early Methodism, though he kept tight control of proceedings. His work was admired in America and in revivalist circles inside and outside Wesleyanism. He supported female preaching, opposing restrictions on it by the Wesleyan conference in 1803, though advising the leading preacher, Mary Barritt (later Taft), to submit.<br>
<br>Bramwell was criticized by Wesleyan leaders hostile to revivalism and emphasizing pastoral discipline. On several occasions he appeared to offer leadership to seceders but then retreated. This was so in his dealings with Alexander Kilham in Sheffield (1797) and James Sigston and the &#145;Kirkgate Screamers&#146; at Leeds in 1803. That year he resigned from the Wesleyan Methodists and appeared to be about to lead a secession of the Manchester Band Room Methodists and Christian Revivalists in Macclesfield, but under great pressure returned to Wesleyanism. This behaviour hindered him from achieving high office, though he was nominated chairman of the Manchester district on the eve of his death.<br>
<br>Bramwell acquired some knowledge of the biblical languages. He was the author of <span class="italic">A Short Account of the Life and Death of Ann Cutler</span> (1796) and an abridgement of Samuel D'Oyley's translation <span class="italic">The Salvation Preacher</span> (1800), which seems to have disappointed its readers.<br>
<br>Bramwell stood about 5 feet 9 inches or 5 feet 10 inches tall, with legs which seemed too slender for a figure inclined to stoutness but curbed by diet. He had a dark complexion, black hair, and piercing eyes. Vigorous and ascetic in his habits, he was an inveterate early riser for prayer, in which he had great power. He had a clear, flexible voice, preaching graphically on the horrors of hell and mercilessly condemning sin. He was credited with &#145;discerning spirits&#146; (perceiving strangers' sins).<br>
<br>Bramwell was an outstanding example of the persistence of the revivalist tradition within Wesleyanism, though also of the strains this was now creating, while his methods anticipated the more self-conscious organized revivalism of the American Charles Finney (1792&#150;1875). He died at Leeds on 13 August 1818 of a stroke and was buried three days later at Westgate Hill near Birstall, Yorkshire.<br>
