<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stephens,  Catherine <span class="st"> [Kitty; </span></span> <span class="st"> <em>married name </em>Catherine  Capel-Coningsby, countess of Essex]</span>  (1794&#150;1882), <span class="occ">singer and actress</span>, was born at 85 Park Street, Grosvenor Square, London, on 18 September 1794, the daughter of Edward Stephens (<i>c</i>.1768&#150;1827), a carver and gilder. Her choice of career was probably influenced by her elder sister Elizabeth (later Mrs J. Smith), who performed in Liverpool and then at Drury Lane from 1798 until around 1806. According to Oxberry, the two Misses Stephens &#145;mutually assisted each other&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oxberry</span>, 123), but Catherine was soon to supersede her sister, to become one of the most popular English singers of her generation.<br>
<br>In 1807 Catherine's father articled her for five years to Gesualdo Lanza, a respectable singing-master, who gave her a thorough grounding in Italian vocal technique. Lanza introduced her to musical society at concerts in Bath, Bristol, Southampton, Ramsgate, and Margate, sometimes billing her as Miss Young. In 1812, presumably with Lanza's blessing, she began her London career in evenings of music and recitation at the Freemasons' Tavern (The Museodeum). She was also engaged to sing in burlettas presented by an Italian opera company at the Pantheon: she appeared as Cherubino in their production of Mozart's <span class="italic">Le nozze di Figaro</span> (2 May 1812), the first staging of this opera in London (acts I and II only were given); her duet with Teresa Bertinotti-Radicati, probably &#145;Aprite, presto, aprite&#146;, was encored consistently. Stephens gave her final performance as Lanza's pupil at a concert given by Samuel Wesley and Samuel Webbe in Ramsgate on 3 October 1812: after this, to Lanza's dismay, her father transferred her to Thomas Welsh, who had heard her at a private concert. Welsh launched her at concerts in Manchester on 17 and 19 November.<br>
<br>Stephens made her Covent Garden d&eacute;but as Mandane in Arne's <span class="italic">Artaxerxes</span> (23 September 1813). Her great success, particularly in the airs &#145;Checked by duty, racked by love&#146; and &#145;The soldier tired of war's alarms&#146;, invited comparison with Angelica Catalani and Elizabeth Billington: both divas attended her performance in this role, and afterwards &#145;paid her their joint tribute of admiration of her vocal powers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, 10 Nov 1813). Stephens was courted by London's Italian Opera Company at the King's Theatre following Catalani's departure, but lack of fluency in Italian led her to decline this and subsequent offers of engagement from that theatre.<br>
<br>Stephens continued to succeed that season as Polly in <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>, as Clara in <span class="italic">The Duenna</span>, and as Rosetta in <span class="italic">Love in a Village</span>. Hazlitt's reviews were particularly enthusiastic, and his account of her performance as Polly led Stephens to visit the offices of the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> in person to express her thanks. Her newly acquired fame provoked a dispute in the press between Lanza and Welsh, each of whom claimed the honour of having instructed her. She played Ophelia to the Hamlet of Young and J. P. Kemble, and continued to sing leading roles at Covent Garden with few interruptions until 1824, when, following disagreements with the managers, she transferred to Drury Lane and the English Opera House. There she sang in Henry Bishop's <span class="italic">Aladdin</span>, put on to rival Weber's <span class="italic">Oberon</span> at Covent Garden; Weber saw it, and wrote approvingly of Kitty Stephens's performance. She only returned to Covent Garden in 1828.<br>
<br>Out of season, Stephens toured the British Isles. In August and September 1816 she appeared at the Crow Street Theatre, Dublin, and the <span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span> declared, &#145;we do not recollect that any other performer, in so short a time, became so great a favourite with a Dublin audience&#146; (7 September 1816). She returned to Ireland again in the latter half of 1818 (when she performed in Dublin, Limerick, Kilkenny, and Cork), and again in July 1821 and 1825. The diary of her brother Edward Maxwell Stephens, who seems to have acted as her manager from around 1817, details her performances throughout Britain, a trip to France in November 1821 (including many visits to the Paris Op&eacute;ra), financial affairs, and social life until her marriage in 1838.<br>
<br>Stephens's voice was full and rich, but for some critics she lacked expression and dramatic fire. Though often considered deficient in the bravura style, she was deeply admired in &#145;ballads and songs of simple declamation&#146;, which she performed with little embellishment in a &#145;purely English&#146; manner: &#145;it is impossible for any thing to be more pure, more chaste than the simplicity with which Miss Stephens gives such songs as &#147;Auld Robin Gray&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Quarterly Musical Magazine and Review</span>, 3.62&#150;3). Her acting skills were limited, as W. C. Macready recalled: &#145;in all the various characters allotted to her she represented only one: but the magic spell of that was never known to fail&#146;  (<span class="italic">Macready's Reminiscences</span>, 1.133).<br>
<br>Despite her popularity on the stage, therefore, many thought Stephens at her finest in concert. She sang at the Concerts of Ancient Music for two decades from 1814, and it was probably here that she was &#145;instructed in all she knew of the sacred school by William Knyvett&#146;  (Phillips, 1.144). She also made her d&eacute;but at the Philharmonic concerts in 1814, and performed there regularly until 1827. In April 1821 she sang at the royal concerts at Brighton under George Smart, but, as the latter noted, her voice did not please the king.<br>
<br>Stephens seems to have had a penchant for Mozart, and often selected numbers from his operas as concert items. She sang Zerlina and Susanna in the first English-language adaptations of Mozart's <span class="italic">Don Giovanni</span> (1817, Covent Garden) and <span class="italic">Le nozze di Figaro</span> (1819, Covent Garden). She was also one of three who sang Agnes (Agathe) in Hawes's English adaptation of Weber's <span class="italic">Der Freisch&uuml;tz</span> (1824, English Opera House). Weber himself composed for Stephens a setting of &#145;From Chindara's warbling fount I come&#146;, which she had chosen from Thomas Moore's <span class="italic">Lallah Rookh</span>. This was to be Weber's final composition: she sang it at his benefit concert on 26 May 1826, when the composer improvised a piano accompaniment he did not live long enough to commit to paper (a sketch, with complete vocal part, survives in manuscript).<br>
<br>Oxberry described Stephens as about &#145;medium height&#146; with a figure &#145;more pleasing than excellent&#146;; &#145;her hair and eyes are dark; and her countenance is fascinating, though not strictly speaking handsome&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oxberry</span>, 135&#150;6). She apparently looked older and graver than her years. Lord Milton and the duke of Devonshire were said to have been among her suitors, but the general consensus was that her conduct remained as &#145;pure&#146; and &#145;chaste&#146; as her singing: &#145;this pretty English ballad-singer &hellip; was, in every relation of life, simply admirable, &hellip; her reputation was as unblemished as the new-fallen snow&#146;  (obituary, unidentified newspaper, BL, Add. MS 35027, fol. 90<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>By 1835 Stephens's voice had become thin and her intonation unsteady, and she retired from the stage having amassed considerable wealth (the <span class="italic">Quarterly Musical Magazine and Review</span> estimated that by 1822 she was netting &pound;2500 each winter season from private parties alone). On 14 April 1838, aged forty-four, she married George Capel-Coningsby, fifth earl of Essex (1757&#150;1839). The octogenarian earl was a &#145;distinguished patron of the drama&#146;, whose estranged wife had died three months earlier  (<span class="italic">Era Almanack</span>, 67). A testament to the purity of her reputation was her reception at court by Queen Victoria, who recorded in her journal that Lord Essex had been &#145;<i>excessively</i> pleased&#146; by her &#145;having called up Lady Essex &hellip; at the Ball and having spoken to her&#146;. The queen and Lord Melbourne agreed &#145;she was a very nice person&#146;  (Esher, 1.374). Following Lord Essex's death on 23 April 1839, Catherine continued to live at 9 Belgrave Square, the house in which she had been married, until she died of bronchitis on 22 February 1882. She was buried at Kensal Green cemetery on 28 February. She left her entire personal estate, valued at more than &pound;70,000, to her unmarried niece Esther Mathilda Johnstone, with whom she had often sung duets. It seems that in her retirement Stephens missed the theatrical life: she observed to Macready &#145;that she had never been so happy as when she was on the stage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Macready's Reminiscences</span>, 2.58).<br>
