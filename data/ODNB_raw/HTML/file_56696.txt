<span class="headword">Walton,  Cecile</span>  (1891&#150;1956), <span class="occ">painter and illustrator</span>, was born on 29 March 1891 at 203 Bath Street, Glasgow, the eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38954/', "Edward Arthur Walton (1860&#150;1922)")</script> and his wife, Helen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Henderson (1859&#150;1945), who previously had been married to Thomas Law. The physiologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36719/', "Arthur Walton")</script> was a younger brother. E. A. Walton was a landscape and portrait painter and was one of the so-called Glasgow Boys; Helen Walton had trained as an artist in Paris prior to her first marriage. Cecile was a child prodigy; she was able to draw at an early age and the artistic environment in which she grew up was remarkable. Her father moved to London in the 1890s and it was in his studio that Cecile met James Guthrie, John Lavery, James Pryde, and, not least, Whistler, who asked her to make a drawing of him. It was during these formative years that Cecile found the work of Holman Hunt and the Pre-Raphaelites more to her taste than the work of her father and his friends; she was beginning to drift into a world of fairy tale, poetry, and romance. After the turn of the century E. A. Walton moved to Edinburgh where Cecile was encouraged to work in watercolours and where Jessie M. King taught her to draw with pen and ink. But the most significant influence in her development as an artist came through her introduction to the Scottish symbolist painter John Duncan (1866&#150;1945), whose Thursday afternoon &#145;at home&#146; attracted many young artists as well as a fascinating cross-section of intellectuals and academics including the botanist and sociologist Patrick Geddes. It was Duncan who taught Cecile how to etch and no doubt Duncan introduced her to another aspect of Edinburgh society that revolved around Andr&eacute; Raffalovitch and Father John Gray.<br>
<br>When she was seventeen, Cecile Walton was sent to Paris to study at the atelier La Grande Chaumi&egrave;re, but she considered its teaching methods old-fashioned and later moved to La Palette where Jacques-Emile Blanche was a visiting professor. After a year in Paris she returned to Edinburgh where she attended a limited number of classes at the Edinburgh College of Art, and she was commissioned by T. C. and E. C. Jack to illustrate <span class="italic">Hans Andersen's Fairy Tales</span>, which was published in 1911. She also met the young Scottish artist <a href="#cosubject_56696">Eric Harald Macbeth Robertson [<i>see below</i>]</a>, whose rather flamboyant lifestyle raised a few eyebrows in certain Edinburgh circles. The Waltons, alarmed by this turn of events, promptly sent Cecile to Florence to stay with an uncle with the hope that she might forget Robertson. Her enforced exile was fortuitous, as she recognized in the work of the early Italian painters the path she would take as an artist. The year she spent apart from Robertson did not dampen her desire to know him better, and on her return to Edinburgh her close friend Mary Newbery and Robertson became the subjects of her first major painting in oils (on loan to the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_56696"></a><span class="headword">Eric Harald Macbeth Robertson</span>  (1887&#150;1941) was one of the most brilliant art students of his period and often scandalized Edinburgh society with his drawings of the female nude. But he was a fine landscape and portrait painter and was well aware of developments in English art, particularly vorticism which he tentatively adopted in a modified form, calling it expressionism. He was also influenced by Gustave Moreau, the Pre-Raphaelite painters, and their followers, and not least John Duncan. But Duncan saw a clearly defined element of decadence in Robertson's work and kept his distance from him, much to Robertson's dismay. During the years leading up to the First World War, Robertson carried out designs and decorative work for Professor Patrick Geddes, and at the same time he painted landscape, portraits, and Celtic myth and legend in a symbolist style.<br>
<br>Cecile Walton and Robertson were married in Edinburgh on 21 February 1914 and their first child, Gavril, was born the following year. In 1916 Robertson joined the Friends' Ambulance Unit and he spent the rest of the war in France. Cecile was engaged with a major work in oils, <span class="italic">The Walking Tour</span> (1916), and she painted in watercolours more than twenty illustrations to a number of Polish fairy tales in translations by Maude Ashurst Biggs. These were published as <span class="italic">Polish Fairy Tales</span> by the Bodley Head (1920). But during the years apart there were infidelities on both sides and their marriage was no longer as sound as it had once been, though their second child, Edward, was born in 1919. With the re-formation of the Edinburgh Group of artists, of which Cecile and Robertson were prominent members, Cecile produced her finest work. Major works in oils are <span class="italic">Grass of Parnassus</span> (1919), <span class="italic">And These Also</span> (1919), <span class="italic">The Back of Beyond</span> (1920), <span class="italic">Romance</span> (1920; Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh), and <span class="italic">To Nobody Knows Where</span> (1921), which received the Royal Scottish Academy Guthrie award. But it is her painting <span class="italic">Romance</span> that will be looked upon as her masterpiece; it is a self-portrait shortly after the birth of her second child, the midwife in attendance while her first child stands at the foot of the bed. The artist sees herself as woman and mother in the form of two iconographic traditions, the nude and mother and child. In terms of its subject matter the painting is unique in Scottish art and when it was first shown at the Edinburgh Group exhibition in 1920 it caused a furore.<br>
<br>On his return to Scotland, Robertson painted a number of war subjects, the most interesting of these being <span class="italic">Shellburst</span> (1919; City of Edinburgh Art Collection), painted in his expressionist style. Other works in the same style, though not war subjects, are <span class="italic">Despair</span> (1921; Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum) and <span class="italic">Cartwheels</span> (<i>c</i>.1920; on loan to the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh). In the early 1920s Robertson and Cecile Walton created a stir in Edinburgh with the paintings they exhibited with the Edinburgh Group at the New Gallery, and it was said that &#145;Half Edinburgh goes to Shandwick Place secretly desiring to be righteously shocked, and the other half goes feeling deliciously uncertain it may be disappointed not finding anything sufficiently shocking&#146;  (F. Quinton, <span class="italic">National Outlook</span>, November 1920, 102&#150;3). Typical of the works exhibited is Robertson's <span class="italic">Loves Invading</span> (1919; City of Edinburgh Art Collection).<br>
<br>The achievements of Cecile Walton and Robertson lasted but a few years, as their individual lifestyles became untenable and in 1923 Robertson left Edinburgh for Liverpool. With the failure of their marriage they lost their way as artists, and for the remainder of the 1920s Cecile produced very little: some mural paintings, principally <span class="italic">Suffer the Little Children to Come unto Me</span> (Wolfsonian-FIU Museum, Florida), and a series of black and white illustrations to a collection of poems by Dorothy Una Ratcliffe, published as <span class="italic">Nightlights</span> by the Bodley Head (1929).<br>
<br>In Liverpool, Robertson shared a studio with the artist Sydney Merrills and tried to establish himself as a portrait painter. He married again in 1927: his second wife was a nurse, (Agnes Catherine) Wynne Walker. By the early 1930s his efforts to maintain a wife and daughter (<i>b</i>. 1932) failed through lack of commissions, and though he turned briefly to commercial art his career as an artist was finished. He died on the Wirral, Cheshire, in 1941.<br>
<br>Cecile Walton's career took a new turn towards the end of the 1920s, when Tyrone Guthrie was appointed to manage the Festival Theatre in Cambridge and engaged Cecile as d&eacute;cor artist for four seasons. Her work in the theatre led to her being invited by the BBC Scottish regional director, David Gleghorn Thompson, to apply for the position of organizer of the BBC Scottish <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span> in Edinburgh. She was interviewed by Lord Reith and, following a three-week period working with the <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span> team in London, she took over from Kathleen Garscadden who had been running both the Glasgow and Edinburgh <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span>. But on 27 November 1936 she married the BBC producer (Robert) Gordon Thomson Gildard (<i>b</i>. 1899/1900), who was about to be transferred to Glasgow, and this move required her to give up her position at the BBC.<br>
<br>With the commencement of the Second World War, Cecile Walton returned to Edinburgh (probably unaware that Robertson was dying of tuberculosis in a sanatorium near Liverpool) to work for the British Council in connection with Czechoslovakian refugees. In 1948, having divorced her second husband in 1945, she moved to Kirkcudbright and started to paint again; and though she did not regain the earlier stature she had achieved during the years she was married to Robertson, she did produce some interesting paintings during a number of visits to Algeria. In 1949 she published <span class="italic">The Children's Theatre Book</span> (Adam and Charles Black, London) with illustrations by herself and her son Edward. A few years later she completed a number of illustrations for <span class="italic">Jingling Lane</span> (Lund Humphries, 1954), an idyll set in a Yorkshire dale.<br>
<br>Cecile Walton was admitted to Mortonhall House, an Edinburgh hospital, in 1956 where she died on 23 April of cancer. Her work is also represented in Perth Art Gallery and Museum, Aberdeen Art Gallery, and the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool.<br>
