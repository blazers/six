<span class="headword">Badiley,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1616&#150;1657), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was formerly a mariner, shipowner, and merchant. Though nothing is known of his origins, he was probably related to the John and Thomas Badiley who figure in Trinity House lists of shipmasters in the 1620s. Bred to the sea, Badiley first occurs in the records as master's mate of the <i>Increase</i>, at Cadiz in 1636, aged twenty and of Wapping. He was master of the <i>Advance</i> and <i>Peregrine</i> (which he part owned) on trading voyages to the eastern Mediterranean in the period 1637&#150;45, fighting actions against Turkish corsairs in 1637, 1640, and 1644; in one his forty-four seamen successfully repelled an attack by over 500 &#145;Turks&#146;. He also traded with North America. By 1648 he was a younger brother of Trinity House, and in 1654 he was described as a freeman of the Fishmongers' Company. He later combined his commercial interests with his naval commitments, despite the inevitable difficulties; he also leased several merchant ships to the state. Though he appears to have taken no direct part in the civil war, he had strong puritan leanings and associations. Following the naval revolt in May 1648 he was one of a small group of Trinity House masters who rallied to the earl of Warwick and parliament, signing a declaration early in July which supported plans to pursue the rebel fleet and insisted that any treaty with the king must guarantee freedom and religious reform. The signatories included several men who, like Badiley, were to play leading roles in the Commonwealth navy, among them Robert Moulton, William Goodsonn, and Christopher Myngs (who later served with him in the Mediterranean). In August Badiley published <span class="italic">The Sea-Men Undeceived</span>, warning that the mutiny posed a grave threat to London's trade, though its tone was conciliatory and he stressed that he had taken the covenant and was still hoping for a settlement with the king.<br>
<br>Badiley was one of a number of experienced puritan shipmasters brought into the new republican navy to provide leadership. Early in 1649 he was appointed captain of the <i>Happy Entrance</i>, and commanded the fleet in the Downs, protecting merchant shipping in the channel. In June he won the council's permission to attack the <i>Antelope</i>, which had joined the royalists at Helvoetsluys in 1648, and a party under his lieutenant successfully fired the vessel. On 1 March 1650 he sailed for Portugal, as vice-admiral of Blake's expedition against Prince Rupert. At one point during the long blockade Badiley was dispatched with eight ships to revictual at Cadiz, and fought six French men-of-war he met at sea. He sailed for England on 14 October, convoying several rich Portuguese prizes. In the summer of 1651 he served as vice-admiral to Blake in the Downs, guarding against a possible attack to support the Scots' invasion. Following the Scots' defeat at Worcester, he assisted Blake with the reduction of Jersey before sailing in the <i>Paragon</i> in December, commanding a convoy to the straits, calling at Genoa, Leghorn, Zante, and Smyrna. When war broke out with the Dutch in 1652 he was still in the Mediterranean, along with another squadron under Henry Appleton, then at Leghorn. Badiley, convoying merchantmen from the Levant, hoped to be able to join forces before meeting the Dutch, but Appleton ignored an urgent plea for support and remained at Leghorn, leaving him with only four vessels to face a much larger Dutch force under Van Galen near Monte Cristo (south of Elba) on 27 August 1652. In a fierce action the next day, fought at close range and mainly hand-to-hand, Badiley's <i>Paragon</i> was badly damaged and a third of her crew killed or injured, while the <i>Phoenix</i> was captured. He retreated next day into Porto Longone (Elba), whose Spanish governor forbade the Dutch to attack him, and set about repairing his battered ships. He wrote to England begging for help and, rather to his embarrassment, his wife also lobbied in London for reinforcements to be sent. Plans for a relief force had to be abandoned following Blake's defeat by the Dutch on 30 November, however, and the two squadrons were left to their fate. Early in November Badiley received overall command of the English forces in the region, and promptly crossed to the mainland to assess the position at Leghorn. He had a poor opinion of Appleton's competence and commitment, and found morale and discipline low. Using his new authority, he pressed a number of merchant ships at Leghorn into the state's service, despite the reluctance of their masters, and arranged for others to be hired at Venice. He also set out to restore national honour by backing Captain Owen Cox's plan to recapture the <i>Phoenix</i>, which the Dutch were refitting there, overriding Appleton's strong opposition. Appleton had earlier tried to dismiss Cox, but Badiley reversed his order and on 20 November Cox carried out a successful night-time raid to board and seize the ship. This and other incidents led the grand duke of Tuscany on 18 February 1653 to order the English to leave the port, a decision also influenced by news of Blake's defeat, which led him to suppose that the Dutch would win the war. Badiley now attempted to rescue the English ships at Leghorn. His plan was to approach to lure out the Dutch warships, whereupon Appleton's ships would follow and the two small English squadrons would engage the Dutch fleet from both directions. The plan, sound in principle, ended in disaster. As the Dutch remained at anchor, Badiley ordered Appleton to slip out to sea during the night but, locked in disputes with his insubordinate captains, Appleton missed his chance. When the Dutch did sail out to confront Badiley, early next morning (4 March), Appleton followed so closely that they were able to turn back and destroy almost his entire force before Badiley was near enough to help. There was no point in Badiley, with a much smaller force and disaffected seamen, engaging the enemy alone, and he took his ships home to England, arriving in May. Appleton, freed by the Dutch, returned home overland and blamed Badiley for the disaster, accusing him of deliberately abandoning the Leghorn squadron to destruction and alleging malice, treachery, and cowardice. Rumours circulated that Badiley would be tried and hanged. In self-defence he published two vigorous pamphlets justifying his actions and making counter-accusations against Appleton and his associates. The matter was referred to a lengthy parliamentary inquiry, and ended with Badiley's total vindication. While Appleton was never employed again, Badiley was promoted to be rear-admiral of the fleet (7 December), and commanded the <i>Vanguard</i> for the last months of the war.<br>
<br>In October 1654 Badiley sailed in the <i>Andrew</i> as vice-admiral to Blake on his expedition to the Mediterranean, and took part in the hazardous attack on Porto Farino near Tunis in April 1655. He returned to England in the autumn. On 14 February 1656 he was appointed captain of the <i>Resolution</i> and vice-admiral commanding the fleet in the Downs, in the wake of Lawson's sudden resignation. Rumours that Badiley, too, was disaffected proved groundless and, despite his enemies' attempt to have him arrested for debt, he sailed with Blake's fleet to Spain on 15 March. After a largely fruitless summer blockading the Spanish coast, he sailed for England with Montagu late in September, bringing home the treasure captured by Stayner from the Plate ships. This was his last service at sea, though he was still consulted by the admiralty commissioners and continued his commercial activities.<br>
<br>Little is known of Badiley's private life. His first wife, Rebecca, died in 1641; his second wife corresponded with him during his enforced stay in Elba in 1652&#150;3, and gave early warning of Appleton's campaign against him. One of Badiley's sisters was married to a business partner, the shipowner and master John Bennet, and another to Thomas Biggs, a naval surgeon. Badiley's writings reveal a strong puritan faith, and his first pamphlet mentions substantial religious compositions which remained unpublished. In 1653 he joined the gathered congregation, which contained several senior naval officers, at Stepney. In April 1657 he was living at Milk Yard, Wapping, in poor health, and he died there &#145;of an ulcer&#146; on 7 or 11 August. He was buried on 14 August at St John-at-Wapping. Charles Longland, English agent at Leghorn and an old acquaintance, had earlier paid tribute to &#145;that honest man Capt. Badiley, who, like the silkworm, spun out his own bowels with the many cares and troubles that lay upon him day and night, yet ran through all with alacrity&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1653&#150;4</i>, 214).<br>
<br>Captain William Badiley, mariner, shipowner, and naval administrator, was probably Richard's elder brother. A younger brother of Trinity House by 1629, when he was trading with the Levant, he freighted ships for the Mediterranean and East Indies for the East India Company in the 1640s, and in 1649 was appointed one of the regulators to purge Trinity House and the navy. In 1652 he commanded the <i>Dolphin</i>, fighting courageously with Blake in two actions against the Dutch. He was appointed master attendant at Portsmouth in December 1653, in charge of the dockyard, and held the same position at Woolwich and Deptford from 1654 until his death in 1666, serving with great efficiency. He was the only Commonwealth elder brother of Trinity House to be reappointed at the Restoration.<br>
