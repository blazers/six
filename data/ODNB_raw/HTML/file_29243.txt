<span class="headword">White,  Gilbert</span>  (1720&#150;1793), <span class="occ">naturalist</span>, was born on 18 July 1720 at the vicarage, Selborne, Hampshire, the eldest son of John White (1688&#150;1758), JP and barrister, and Anne (1693&#150;1739), daughter of Thomas Holt (<i>d</i>. 1710), rector of Streatham, Surrey. White's grandfather, the Revd Gilbert White (1650&#150;1728), fourth son of Sampson White (1607&#150;1684), twice mayor of Oxford and knighted in 1660 by Charles II for loyalty to the crown, was vicar at Selborne from 1681 until his death in 1728, having previously been a fellow at Magdalen College, Oxford, in whose gift the living at Selborne lay. Shortly after his arrival at Selborne, he had married Rebecca Luckin (1654&#150;1755), daughter of a yeoman farmer on Nore Hill, Newton Valence, a parish adjacent to Selborne, and from this combination of Oxford learning and local knowledge White derived the main influences that determined the principal features of his life and career.<br>
<br>White's father had been called to the bar in 1713 and obtained at the Middle Temple a life interest in chambers (which he retained until his death), but on his marriage in 1719 he retired from practice and devoted himself to country pursuits. Living first at Compton, near Guildford, and briefly at East Harting, near Petersfield, he and his wife, together with their growing family (eleven children were born within thirteen years) soon established themselves permanently at Selborne. The Wakes, a village house on the west side of The Street, as Selborne's main thoroughfare was known, fell vacant and in 1728 John White and family, joined by his now widowed mother from the vicarage, made it the family home for the remainder of the century and beyond. In character John White was quiet and unassuming&#151;he played the harpsichord, observed the weather, and liked nothing better than to take his horse and &#145;amble along by Hedges under the wind&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters to Gilbert White</span>, 19)&#151;but he honoured the charitable bequests to the parish instituted by his father, and later (in 1741) laid out the 7 acres of the estate at The Wakes in walks and hedges. These features of his life, linked to his &#145;christian Temper&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters to Gilbert White</span>, 136), inspired in his eldest son a gentle filial regard, and during his final illness and decline White planted &#145;bunches of single snow-drops in bloom under [his] Father's window&#146;  (White, <span class="italic">Garden Kalendar</span>, March 1758).<h2>
<a name="Childhoodandeducation"></a>Childhood and education</h2>Familial devotion to parochial concerns, a disposition demonstrated to White not only through the interests of his father and grandfather but also through the country sympathies and country certainties of his paternal grandmother, had a profound effect on the future naturalist. After a childhood immersed in the wisdom of hanger, beech, and stream, including a notable occasion when he planted in the garden an oak and an ash to celebrate his tenth birthday, he went to school, first at Farnham and then to the grammar school at Basingstoke. At the latter he was under the tuition of Thomas Warton (<i>d</i>. 1745) and made acquaintance with the Warton brothers, Joseph, a future headmaster of Winchester, and Thomas, who was to become professor of poetry at Oxford University and poet laureate. An extant pocket book of White's shows that he &#145;carryed to Basingstoke [on] January 17, 1739&#146;  (Holt-White, 31) over thirty books for study. Most of the volumes were essential classics (for example, Xenophon, Homer, Horace, Virgil, Caesar, Tacitus, &#145;Tully&#146; or Cicero), but amid the Greek and the Latin were <span class="italic">The Whole Duty of Man</span> (anonymous, 1758), and John Wilkins's <span class="italic">Of the Principles and Duties of Natural Religion</span> (1675); there was also a copy of James Thomson's <span class="italic">The Seasons</span> (1730) and it seems that it was at Basingstoke that White learned to delight in literature and first tried his hand at making verses in English.<br>
<br>Extensive as this learning was, White retained a growing pleasure in the outdoor life and during his schooldays he began the exploration of southern and central England that in later life was to earn him the sobriquet the Hussar Parson  (<span class="italic">Letters to Gilbert White</span>, 166); he was also adept with the gun. The first record of his observations of nature occur in a notebook belonging to a future brother-in-law, Thomas Barker (1722&#150;1809) of Lyndon Hall, and were made on the occasion of a visit White made in 1736 to stay with an aunt at Whitwell, Rutland. Proceeding to Oriel College, Oxford, in April 1740 (he had been admitted a commoner on 17 December 1739, but the death of his mother on that day from an attack of measles delayed his entrance), he embraced the life of an undergraduate. From his account books it is known that he played chess, attended concerts and the coffee house, won and lost at cards, visited great houses and gardens (Burghley, Windsor, Stowe, Wilton, for example), and drank, buying wine by the gallon, cider by the hogshead, and tea in variety&#151;green, hyson, balm, congo, and bohea are all mentioned. In addition, he read modern (English) literature, and hunted.<br>
<br>A close companion in the first of these activities was John Mulso (1721&#150;1791) who was to become an enduring friend and a regular informant of events in the church and in literary circles. An uncle of Mulso, John Thomas, was successively bishop of Peterborough, Salisbury, and Winchester, the family often met a leading novelist of the age, Samuel Richardson, and a sister, Hester, was to become, on marriage, Hester Chapone. Mulso corresponded with White from 1744 to 1790; he also visited Selborne on a number of occasions and in 1747 White addressed to him the first version of his most sustained poetic effort, &#145;An Invitation to Selborne&#146;, a work that he later revised and used again. From Mulso's extant letters much can be learned about White's character and pursuits; this source reveals that his reading extended not only to the main figures of the literary tradition&#151;Spenser, Shakespeare, Donne, Milton, Dryden&#151;but also included many contemporaries: Swift, Pope, Fielding, and Richardson are referred to. This delight in literature, both classical and English, was to contribute much to White's education, and later in life, throughout his letters and journals, aspects of this period of his reading figure prominently even when the subject matter is the natural world.<br>
<br>If it was a delight in literature that gave White his literary clothes, it was to his second pursuit, hunting, that can be traced his sense of the natural world as an encounter full of mystery and beauty, waiting to be observed and recorded. Expenses noted in the account books from his Oxford days show that the outlay was considerable. In addition to costs associated with the gun&#151;powder, shot, papers, flints, and repairs to his weapon are all mentioned&#151;there were other expenses since a boy had to be hired, boots paid for, and dogs bought, fed, and attended to; a notable sequence of costs centred on the dog Fairey, who went &#145;strolling&#146; during a journey one Christmas from Oxford to Selborne, for entries refer to &#145;Advertising, &amp; crying Fairey&#146;, a &#145;Reward to Bernard Bailey [to whom she had] strolled&#146;, and payment to a &#145;News-man for bringing her to Selborn&#146;  (G. White, account books). The persistence of payments of this kind suggests a regular, even relentless, pursuit of avian game, confirmation of which is given by Mulso who, writing in later life about this period, commented: &#145;at that time You used to practise with your Gun in Summer to steady your Hand for Winter, &amp; inhospitably fetch down our Visitants, the Birds of Passage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters to Gilbert White</span>, 293). However, during the routine of &#145;field-diversions&#146; White experienced an event that was to shape his future and eventually lead to the single work for which he is so well known, <span class="italic">The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne</span> (1789). The occasion can be dated precisely to 21 September 1741: up early, and out hunting for partridge, White &#145;found the stubbles and clover-grounds matted all over with [such] a thick coat of cobweb&#146; that his dogs were &#145;so blinded and hoodwinked that they could not proceed&#146;; and further, the &#145;perfect flakes or rags&#146; (of gossamer&#151;for that is what White describes in <span class="italic">Selborne</span>, Barrington, letter 23) &#145;hung in the trees and hedges so thick, that a diligent person &hellip; might have gathered baskets full&#146;. The immediate outcome of this singular experience was a forced return home, during which he mused on &#145;the oddness of the occurrence&#146;. But a deeper magic was at work and White's devotion to hunting received a considerable shock. Gratuitous killing (even for sport), he came to realize, was alien to the purposes of Providence, and although he continued to shoot for the table and, later, to provide specimens for identification and dissection, the thrill of the chase and the deceit of the stalk were to be replaced in his maturity by a spirit of enquiry and the outcomes of scientific curiosity.<br>
<br>White's immediate concern, however, was completion of his studies at university, and in June 1743 he graduated bachelor of arts. Award of the degree took place on 30 June and led to a notable memorial. The guest at the ceremony was Alexander Pope and he presented to White a copy of his own translation of Homer's <span class="italic">Iliad</span>, in six volumes which are now in the British Library and contain the sole authentic likenesses of White; two sketches, in volumes 3 and 5, were &#145;penned by T:C:&#146;, most probably Thomas Chapman of Trinity College, Oxford, with whom White played chess and later shared proctorial office in the university. In the following year, on 30 April, White was elected to a fellowship of his college. In 1746 he spent several months at Thorney, Isle of Ely, attending to the estate of Thomas Holt, a distant relative on his mother's side who bequeathed a small inheritance to each of the White brothers and entailed his estate (conditional on the adoption of his surname) to White's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59515/', "Thomas Holt White (1724&#150;1797)")</script>, and in the October was awarded his degree of master of arts; this and his fellowship were not the last honours he was to receive from either Oriel or the university, but the prospect of employment beckoned and he now sought to earn a living.<h2>
<a name="Clericalandacademiccareer"></a>Clerical and academic career</h2>From the mid-1740s for a period of nearly fifteen years White pursued a future that might have led to a career at Oxford. Beginning by joining the Anglican church (he was made a deacon on 27 April 1747 at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, by the bishop, Thomas Secker), he was appointed curate at a small country parish, Swarraton, Hampshire, held, together with Bradley, by the Revd Charles White, husband to his father's youngest sister, Elizabeth. Although detained that same year at Oxford for much of the autumn by a severe attack of smallpox, through which he was nursed by &#145;Goody Marshall&#146; who came from Selborne solely for that purpose, on his recovery White soon recommenced a hectic series of tours and visits. At one moment he was in Gloucestershire seeing a college friend, then he visited Sunbury-on-Thames (where Mulso was the incumbent) and Ringmer, near Lewes in Sussex; there he saw a great-aunt, Rebecca Snooke, from whom in March 1780 he was to inherit a tortoise, Timothy, on which he was later to conduct several experiments. (Timothy proved on death to be female; her shell is now in the Natural History Museum, London.) In late summer 1750 he travelled to Wiltshire and on into Devon (where he stayed in the South Hams with an Oriel contemporary, Nathan Wells, and from where he returned with a specimen of sea-kale, <i>Crambe maritima</i>, which he was to grow at The Wakes for several years). In the following year, 1751, he was off again in July and August to make a wide, sweeping tour up to the west midlands and on east into Rutland to visit his youngest sister, Anne, who had married Thomas Barker of Lyndon Hall on 6 January that year at Selborne. The date of the marriage is significant as Barker was already a considerable observer of the natural scene (principally meteorology, and he had already submitted the first of more than thirty papers to the Royal Society, to which he was later elected as a fellow), for on the day following the wedding White made the first entry in a new record book that he termed (for that year) &#145;The Garden-Kalendar for the Year 1751&#146;.<br>
<br>In some form or other White was to keep a near daily record of his activities in the garden and of natural phenomena for more than forty years, until shortly before his death in 1793. Alongside this appetite for observation he continued his clerical duties, becoming in October 1751 curate-in-charge at Selborne (an office he was to hold again in 1756 and in 1758 and, for a fourth time, in 1784 right through to his death); he also maintained the social round, visiting Portsmouth, Winchester, and Midhurst (Cowdray Park), as well as fulfilling the necessary duties as fellow at Oriel. This commitment was to serve him well, for in 1752 the office of junior proctor in the University of Oxford fell to his college and White was elected for a twelvemonth from 8 April. Combining these duties with those of dean in his own college reinforced an interest in an academic future, and in 1757&#151;after a sequence of short curacies, mostly for relatives in the Selborne area but including a period at West Dean in Wiltshire, and social visits in 1753 and 1755 to Bristol Hot-Well&#151;he offered himself for election as provost of his college. Associated as he was with the country scene, and with little academic or other public achievement to his credit, his election was always unlikely and the office went to Chardin Musgrave. White's merits, however, were recognized through preferment as perpetual curate at Moreton Pinkney, Northamptonshire, and, as he was able to hold the parish without residence, he accepted the office. As senior fellow of Oriel he was to receive in later years the offer of a number of wealthy parishes, but although he made numerous visits to inspect each opportunity as it came, he was never to accept further preferment, for it would have required residence away from Selborne.<br>
<br>With no further prospects available to him, White turned his eyes back to his native village. His paternal grandmother, Rebecca Luckin, had died in 1755, and with the death of his father in September 1758 responsibility for The Wakes (the inheritance of which passed to him in 1763 on the death of the Revd Charles White of Bradley) was to fall to him. In November 1759 he began a tour that extended over six months, the longest absence from Selborne he was ever to make. After calling <i>en route</i> at Sunbury to see the Mulsos, he first stayed in London with his brother Thomas (now partner in a wholesale merchant's business in Thames Street), and then set off for Rutland to visit his sister Anne and Thomas Barker at Lyndon Hall; he returned in mid-May 1760 and immediately noted in the &#145;Kalendar&#146; for 17 May that his garden was &#145;in very good order &hellip; The Cucumbers in full bearing &hellip; The Cantaleupe-melons in good Condition [and all] the kitchen-crops &hellip; in good plight&#146;. It was a situation in which he felt most at home and which also provided the seeds of his future acclaim.<h2>
<a name="Beginningsofthenaturalist"></a>Beginnings of the naturalist</h2>Concurrently with his clerical career and his plans for an academic future, White became interested in the formal study of the garden at The Wakes. His serious interest had been indicated by the purchase in 1743 of the standard text of the day, Philip Miller's <span class="italic">The Gardeners Dictionary</span>. He planted more trees (elm, fir, and beech in 1750&#150;51) and, most importantly, began, on Monday 7 January 1751, a journal record of work in the garden. This journal, named the &#145;Garden kalendar&#146;, contains much more than its title suggests. As well as being a record of garden operations, details are given about the weather, with annual summaries; about how best to ventilate a hotbed; and about seed-trials&#151;planting potatoes, for example, in &#145;peat-dust&#146; instead of &#145;old-thatch&#146; for &#145;experiment sake&#146;. Further, across the whole journal from 1751 until 1767 occur instances of White's gift for homely measurement: succade melons &#145;come by heaps&#146; (that is, in abundance); a cucumber in April is &#145;about as big as the top of one's finger&#146;; snow is &#145;deeper than a horse's belly&#146;; and after ploughing, the clods stand &#145;as high as one's knees&#146;. In addition, in 1758 White entered the first explicit references to natural history: &#145;Saw two swallows&#146; (9 April), and in November the much longer: &#145;Saw a very unusual sight; a large flock of House-Martens playing about between our fields, and the Hanger&#146;. The location for this observation, the ground behind The Wakes, is significant for it was to the garden that White now looked for his main satisfactions and to which he chiefly directed his energies, particularly as his clerical income was now secure, for he accepted in 1761 the curacy at Faringdon, a parish adjacent to Selborne and an office he was to hold for over twenty years since it could be easily served from The Wakes.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1750s and on into the early 1760s construction work in the garden, aided by the purchase of part of a neighbour's orchard, was unending. It included brick walks leading from the house to an arbour that he used for observation; a grassed terrace, on which a sundial was erected; a turfed mount; a zig-zag path up the slope of the Hanger (the steep slope of Selborne Hill to the west of The Wakes, clothed with beech); a ha-ha (a large ditch at the boundary, effective as a fence to keep livestock out of the garden but also offering an unrestricted view of the surrounding countryside); vistas that looked to huge oil-jars erected on pedestals; and on the Hanger itself a statue of Hercules, and also a hermitage, a mock hermit's cell roofed with thatch. In good weather, this last became a centre of social activity: Henry (1733&#150;1788), White's youngest brother, rector and schoolmaster at Fyfield, near Andover, played the hermit, guests were entertained, and the fruits of White's exertions in the garden were enjoyed at cantaloupe feasts.<br>
<br>In White's records for 1764&#150;5, however, a new note is struck: he began to extend his library. In addition to some travel literature, Hill's <span class="italic">Herbal</span> (1756) and Jan Swammerdam's <span class="italic">Book of Nature</span> (1758), he obtained the two texts that launched him on a serious study of nature&#151;Benjamin Stillingfleet's <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Tracts</span> (1759), and William Hudson's <span class="italic">Flora Anglica</span> (1762). From Stillingfleet's <span class="italic">Tracts</span>, and especially from the &#145;Calendar of flora&#146; that was added to the second edition (1762), White learned about the natural calendar, about the dream that natural phenomena, especially the migration of birds and the growth of plants, would provide, through the determination of dates for sowing and reaping, a prognostic for the labours of the husbandman such that reliable harvests would be secured to the benefit of all. In order to keep the necessary records for such a project accurate identification of natural forms was necessary. Previously he had used John Ray's publications as the authority for naming and identification, especially of native fauna, but there was much he had to learn about flora and it was from Hudson that he obtained the Linnaean nomenclature so necessary if he was to acquire the knowledge that the venture required.<br>
<br>The first fruits of this new, eager stage in White's growth of understanding occurred in the &#145;Kalendar&#146; for summer 1765 but they were to reach maturity in &#145;Flora Selborniensis&#146;, 1766. This volume, to which he gave the subtitle &#145;with some co-incidences of the coming, &amp; departure of birds of passage, &amp; insects; &amp; the appearing of Reptiles&#146;, was not edited and published until 1911 (by Wilfred Mark Webb, under the title <span class="italic">A Nature Calendar</span>), but it convincingly demonstrates one of White's principal strengths as a naturalist&#151;an openness to enquiry. Although most of the entries are on vegetation, and although the items included embrace those properly contained in both a <i>hortus siccus</i> and a flora, the main focus of the record is on stages of growth. In order to indicate the beginnings of growth White deploys a somewhat elastic vocabulary (plants &#145;spring&#146;, &#145;sprout&#146;, &#145;shoot&#146;, &#145;emerge&#146;, &#145;peep-out&#146;) but when he comes to record flowering, the key stage for the botanist, as for the plantsman and the apothecary, he becomes more precise and establishes a terminology that divides the process into five&#151;&#145;buds for bloom&#146;, &#145;begins to blow&#146;, &#145;blows&#146;, &#145;in high bloom&#146;, &#145;going out of bloom&#146;. Use of this finely graded differentiation enabled White to make comparisons across species and sites, and (because of necessary variation consequent on differing soils and aspects) prompted some scepticism about the venture. Nevertheless, although White records phenomena within a territory he had known since childhood, and one no larger than a parish, his observations avoid the dullness of familiarity; on the contrary, there is a freshness of phrase, an edge of enthusiasm, that conveys a continual delight in the natural world. This delight, accumulated in the garden at The Wakes and in the fields and meadows of his native place, was later tested in London by conversation and correspondence with the leading naturalists of the time. White's survival of the procedure was a triumphant vindication of the wisdom to be learned within a parochial territory, and was to lead directly to his principal accomplishment, <span class="italic">The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne</span> (1789).<h2>
<a name="Maturityasanaturalist"></a>Maturity as a naturalist</h2>Excited by the formal knowledge he now possessed of the Selborne flora and fauna, White travelled to London in April 1767 to make a customary annual visit to see two of his brothers&#151;Thomas, the general merchant and future fellow of the Royal Society (1777), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57016/', "Benjamin White (c.1725&#150;1794)")</script>, bookseller and principal of the premier shop in London for volumes on natural history. During this visit he made the acquaintance in May of Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, who were to leave England the following year with Cook on the 1768&#150;72 circumnavigation, and of Thomas Pennant (fellow of the Royal Society, 1767) who was then working on the second edition of his <span class="italic">British Zoology</span> (1st edn, 1761&#150;6). White greatly admired Banks's fortitude and as he followed details of the voyage in the press he derived much enlightenment from sensing, for the first time, the deprivation that men were prepared to endure in the cause of furthering scientific enquiry; however, it was from meeting Pennant that two important consequences flowed for his own development.<br>
<br>Preparation of a British natural history necessarily required numerous informants, and judging White to be a reliable observer in a part of the country about which he had little personal knowledge (his own home was in Flintshire, north Wales), Pennant invited him to correspond. White took time to weigh this idea but wrote to Pennant on 10 August 1767; this letter, edited and dated 4 August and prefaced by nine specially written putative letters, appeared more than twenty years later as the first &#145;real&#146; letter in <span class="italic">Selborne</span> (1789). If the first consequence of meeting Pennant led to White's discovering he had knowledge to communicate to a specialist in natural history, albeit in private correspondence, the second was to lead directly to public recognition.<br>
<br>Late in this same year there arrived at Selborne, as a gift from the author (but prompted by Pennant whose perception of White as a useful contributor to the cause of natural history was to be fully vindicated), a copy of a published design for a naturalist's annual notebook entitled the <span class="italic">Naturalist's Journal</span> (1767). This journal, devised by Daines Barrington (1727&#150;1800), fellow of the Royal Society (1767), was designed to facilitate at different seasons and across Britain the correlation between meteorological phenomena and the behaviour of flora and fauna. Set within the tradition advocated by Benjamin Stillingfleet of discovering&#151;to the benefit of husbandry and agriculture&#151;the natural calendar, this focus on observation and record appealed to White and harnessed his particular skills to a general purpose. Putting to one side the &#145;Kalendar&#146; that had served him so well for the preceding thirteen years, but which now seemed essentially a private document, he made the first entry in his new journal for Friday 1 January 1768, and thus initiated a pattern of record-keeping that he was to sustain almost daily for over twenty-five years.<br>
<br>The format of Barrington's design devoted a large, landscape page to each week. After requiring completion of year, location, and soil, columns were available for observation of the weather conditions: thermometer and barometer readings were required, as well as wind direction, measurement of rainfall, and a verbal description of conditions. With these contextual data in place, the observer was then provided with five columns: four of these invited record of trees and fungi, of plants and mosses, of birds and insects, and of fish and other creatures, and the fifth gave opportunity for varied memoranda. For each column there was insistence on precision; for example, the meteorological columns required observations four times daily, and the record of plants and creatures emphasized appearance and disappearance, both concepts being of vital relevance to the purpose of the whole venture.<br>
<br>Although White rarely completed every requirement of the format, especially over the reiterated instrumental data, he warmed to the purpose and acknowledged the rewards that flowed from keeping such meticulous, incremental records. A typical page of data, particularly in the summer, often includes nearly 100 items, but White soon found the columnar structure of Barrington's design insufficient for his purposes, and within a few years he arranged to have his annual volumes of the <span class="italic">Naturalist's Journal</span> interleaved with blank pages. On these pages, in particular from May 1776, he began to record extended comments and descriptions of his observations, many of which were to appear in <span class="italic">Selborne</span> (1789) as part of the putative (undated) letters to Barrington. More significantly, and in parallel with the beginning of this process of journal compilation, White began a correspondence with Barrington. After writing to thank Barrington for the gift of the <span class="italic">Journal</span>, and meeting him in London, first in 1768 but then, for almost a decade, usually annually, White began the sequence of letters that carried his observations of the natural world beyond the confines of his parish and into the rooms of the Royal Society of London and, in later years, to the enduring benefit of posterity, onto the shelves of enthusiasts for the natural scene throughout the world. In large measure this outcome must be ascribed to Barrington's influence on White; his disinterest (professionally he was a judge) and, to use White's terms, his &#145;candour&#146; and &#145;affability&#146; appealed strongly, and White responded in kind. Comparison of White's letters to Pennant alongside those to Barrington shows that the former are descriptive, with a focus on information, which was exactly what Pennant could incorporate in his own volumes of natural history; in contrast, the letters to Barrington are relaxed and speculative, and so varied in content that they convey the interests of an author not only at one with the world of his enquiries but also at one with his own nature.<br>
<br>Both sets of correspondence, however, furthered White's studies. Pennant's absorption in new information led White to reveal that he had a brother John (1727&#150;1780) living in Gibraltar, where he was chaplain, and with Pennant's prompting White encouraged his brother to take up the study of natural history. This the latter did most ably, tutored (and for White's development this was a significant fact) by White himself. It was a new role for White. Previously he had been a student of Miller's gardening knowledge, of Gibson's knowledge of fauna in North America (James Gibson, a contemporary of White's at Oxford, was a naval chaplain at Quebec in 1759), of Stillingfleet's dream of discovering the natural calendar, and of Hudson's <span class="italic">Flora Anglica</span>, but now he was to become a teacher. He prompted, cajoled, directed, and guided to such good purpose that John White not only initiated a correspondence with Linnaeus but also amassed sufficient materials to prepare, on his return to England in 1772 and during his subsequent office as vicar at Blackburn, Lancashire, a volume on the fauna of Gibraltar. White's enthusiasm for his brother's progress is strikingly indicated by the cargoes of specimens that his brother sent to England. Identification of their many items presented White with some difficulties, but he enlisted assistance from several specialists, William Sheffield and Richard Skinner from Oxford (both of whom visited Selborne), Dru Drury, Lee of Hammersmith, and Pennant himself, and presented some items to the Royal Society (and elsewhere) in the belief that important specimens &#145;should belong to places where they will be set in natural attitudes and much admired; rather than &hellip; be laid up in a box in my study where they will seldom be seen&#146;  (Foster, &#145;Gibraltar correspondence&#146;, 499&#150;500).<br>
<br>And yet, if it is to Pennant's curiosity that credit should be assigned for White's knowledge of a fauna and flora in a countryside so different from Selborne, it is to Barrington that acknowledgement must be given for the impetus and opportunity that were to haul White into the public arena. The keys to this encouragement were two suggestions made by Barrington in 1769 and 1770. The first, to write about the birds of the parish, brought White to a new understanding of his powers and to an articulation of his comprehensive knowledge of Selborne ornithology (letters 1 and 2 in the Barrington sequence in <span class="italic">Selborne</span>). The second, to prepare an account of the animals in his neighbourhood, faced the Selborne naturalist for the first time with the idea of publication. For White the idea of pursuing these unsolicited suggestions was daunting and he was able to contemplate a response only with hesitation. Friends (particularly Mulso) and relatives encouraged him, however, and letter by letter with painstaking care he wrote himself into history, literary as well as scientific.<br>
<br>Certain key stages in his growing confidence can be noted: a decision to publish, if at all, alone and not in concert with Barrington, who had hoped White would collaborate with him on a joint publication; a commitment to local natural history, much emphasized by reading Giovanni Scopoli whose monograph (1769) on the birds of Carniola encouraged him in his belief that the &#145;more confined y<sup>r</sup> sphere of observation &hellip; the more perfect will be y<sup>r</sup> remarks&#146;  (Foster, &#145;Gibraltar correspondence&#146;, 491); the successful completion, at Barrington's invitation, of monographs for the Royal Society on the house martin (<i>Delichon urbica</i>), swallow (<i>Hirundo rustica</i>), swift (<i>Apus apus</i>), and bank martin (<i>Hirundo riparia</i>); detailed discussion with Barrington on the completed volumes of the <span class="italic">Naturalist's Journal</span> for 1774 and 1775; the commissioning in 1776 of Samuel Hieronymus Grimm as illustrator for the projected volume (he painted twelve different watercolours of Selborne in twenty-four days); a decision to broaden an account of the creatures of the parish into a volume that would accommodate the antiquities of the parish; and lastly, the arrival at Selborne in 1781 of Mrs John White, widow of White's brother, who accepted on her husband's death White's invitation to live at The Wakes and assume responsibility for domestic matters. The decision to include antiquities extended the time required for the preparation of <span class="italic">Selborne</span> by a decade, despite instruction from John Loveday (1711&#150;1789), of Caversham, Reading, in aspects of medieval church history and a considerable contribution made by Richard Chandler (1738&#150;1810) who, as a fellow of Magdalen College, had access to the college records concerning the parish antiquities.<br>
<br>Mrs White's arrival was significant: The Wakes was the family home and White saw it as such. Encouraged by his sister-in-law he not only recorded in his journal a new appreciation of garden produce and culinary satisfaction, but throughout the 1780s (and later) welcomed to the Hampshire village an increasing number of nephews and nieces, that at his last count in January 1793, totalled sixty-two, including spouses. It was with detailed help from two of them, Mary and Benjamin White (the married elder children respectively of his brothers Thomas and Benjamin, who were active participants in 1785 in Benjamin White's Fleet Street shop for natural history books) that <span class="italic">Selborne</span> was printed, and published, on 1 November 1788 (but with 1789 on the title-page, as volumes available in the final months of the year were permitted to carry the date of the following year).<h2>
<a name="Finalyearspublicationsandpresentstanding"></a>Final years, publications, and present standing</h2>With his major, one might even say his life's, work published, White now devoted himself to new activities. <span class="italic">Selborne</span>, reviewed in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> by his brother Thomas (who frequently shared White's enthusiasms as a plantsman and observer, and who had already contributed to that journal a sequence of articles on trees, as well as for much of the 1780s a series of monthly meteorological diaries), and in <span class="italic">The Topographer</span>, brought acclaim and, as well as prompting many gifts from local people of unusual specimens, encouraged new correspondents. Among the latter the most important were George Montagu (1751&#150;1815), author of the <span class="italic">Ornithological Dictionary</span> (1802), and Robert Marsham (1708&#150;1797) of Norfolk with whom White pursued an intense correspondence, chiefly on trees, throughout his remaining years. White also enjoyed reflecting on the relation of natural history to the literary tradition (the <span class="italic">Naturalist's Journal</span> in its concluding phase is much fuller than at earlier periods with reference to literary evocations of the natural scene), and began to prepare a further avian monograph, on the nightjar, <i>Caprimulgus Europaeus</i>. Before he could find a sponsor for this new work at the Royal Society, however, he made his last entry in the <span class="italic">Naturalist's Journal</span> on Saturday 15 June 1793 (and also wrote his last letter, to Marsham); he died quietly at The Wakes eleven days later, on Wednesday 26 June. His funeral, conducted by the non-resident vicar of Selborne, Christopher Taylor, took place on 1 July, and he was buried in Selborne churchyard, at his own wish out of the heat of the sun, near the north wall of the chancel; his grave is marked by a simple stone cut to read &#145;G. W. 26th June 1793&#146;.<br>
<br>Except for a number of short items (an account of the poet William Collins; a few brief poems; and contributions to the monthly &#145;Meteorological diary&#146;), all of which are in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> above the pseudonym V., White's sole publications in his lifetime were the monographs on the &#145;hirundines&#146;, each of which offered something new and original in observation and which appeared in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span> (vols. 64 and 65), and <span class="italic">The natural history and antiquities of Selborne, in the county of Southampton, with engravings, and an appendix</span> (1789), printed in London by T. Bensley for B. White &amp; Son, at Horace's Head, Fleet Street, London. Extending, together with its index, the preparation of which White claimed to be &#145;an occupation full as entertaining as that of darning socks, tho' by no means so advantageous to society&#146;  (Foster, <span class="italic">Gilbert White</span>, 146), to nearly 500 pages, the quarto volume contains nine plates, all from Grimm's drawings.<br>
<br>Purporting to comprise three sequences of letters&#151;those addressed to Pennant and to Barrington forming the natural history portion of the volume, the remainder, unaddressed (although White considered Chandler an appropriate recipient) forming an account of parish antiquities&#151;<span class="italic">Selborne</span> needs to be read with discrimination. In contrast to White's observations of the natural world, notably in the &#145;Garden kalendar&#146;, in &#145;Flora Selborniensis&#146;, and in the <span class="italic">Naturalist's Journal</span> across its many annual volumes, all of which offer a scrupulously documented historical record, <span class="italic">Selborne</span> is a literary work. In preparing it White became conscious that he was freed from the perceptible rhythms and occasions of the natural world, and the outcome is a volume beset by the vagaries of correspondence, by the sensibilities of social discourse, and by the chances of art. Although the core of the natural history portion of the volume remained the letters White exchanged with Pennant and Barrington, when he came to edit those letters he discovered the need both to modify and to extend his material. Features of this process include the omission from the real letters of much personal detail; the changing of actual dates of writing to imagined dates; the admission into the letters of new observations and incidents taken from his journals; and the adaptation of letters to members of his family, and their deployment, as if the originals were to either Pennant or Barrington. In addition, and in order to make an acceptable volume in both design and length, White not only prepared an introductory sequence of letters, which are given as the first nine letters addressed to Pennant, but also raided his journals for new topics and gathered the results together in many of the later letters in the published sequence to Barrington.<br>
<br>In choosing to present his observations in the form of letters, White was following the accepted practice of his time. For decades the exchange of letters between scientists had formed the primary vehicle for reporting new observations and for communicating results, just as in literature the epistolary novel was a dominant form in the years of White's maturity and in an earlier age Defoe had shown how to incorporate in a single volume real alongside fabricated letters. To mediate an understanding of the world by means of letters, whether fabricated or real, invited the reader to participate in the writer's own journey of exploration, to share the very motions of his mind, its doubts alongside its certainties, its astonishment in discovery, and, most important of all, the satisfactions obtained from investigative activity itself.<br>
<br>On White's death his literary papers were passed by his relatives to John Aikin MD (1747&#150;1822), whose first response was to extract previously unpublished material from the journals and issue it as <span class="italic">A Naturalist's Calendar, with Observations in Various Branches of Natural History</span> (1795). He then advised publication of White's collected writings in natural history, and this was accomplished in <span class="italic">Selborne</span> (1802). This volume, comprising first the republication of <span class="italic">Selborne</span> (1789) without the letters on the antiquities, and <span class="italic">A Naturalist's Calendar</span> (1795), and second a calendar of natural occurrences and memoranda, parallel to Aikin's 1795 publication, but prepared by W. Markwick of Catisfield, Sussex, was prefaced by a brief memoir of White written by John White, son of Benjamin White, the bookseller. There followed in 1813 the first comprehensive edition of White's published works: letters on the parish antiquities were restored, White's known poems were added, and the first notes on his work, by the Revd John Mitford of Benhall, Suffolk, were included. These notes marked a change in the perception of White's work. At the time of his first communications with Pennant and Barrington, and for a decade or so after first publication of <span class="italic">Selborne</span>, White's observations, as may readily be confirmed by inspection of Pennant's <span class="italic">British Zoology</span> (1776&#150;7), Barrington's <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span> (1781), and, for example, W. Bingley's <span class="italic">Animal Biography</span> (1805), were valued for their new contributions to natural history. With the assimilation of this knowledge into the scientific literature (a process marked by corrections and additions to published work), one might have expected White's volume to lapse into obscurity. This did not occur: on the contrary, an interest which had initially been focused on factual knowledge was replaced by an interest best described as inspirational.<br>
<br>Throughout the Victorian period and on through the twentieth century, publisher after publisher issued a distinctive addition to White studies. Full bibliographic detail for these many editions of <span class="italic">Selborne</span>, almost always of the natural history letters alone, are given in E. A. Martin's <span class="italic">Bibliography</span> (1970), but two broad comments can be made. First, the styles of these many editions bear witness to the concerns of the period of publication; this is especially noticeable in the heavily annotated editions of the mid-Victorian period and, in the twentieth century, in the changing style of the illustrations used to accompany the text. Second, as White's work became better known it was elevated into a classic and found a place in any series that claimed to publish the &#145;best&#146; books, not only in English literature but in world literature as well. This recognition was the culmination of a process initiated by the 1813 edition: as the nineteenth century neared its end the Victorians, under pressure from the urban excesses of economic and industrial achievement and from the implications of Darwinism, increasingly sought solace in the beacons of the past and <span class="italic">Selborne</span>, in its gentle, quiet, yet elegant and gracious fashion, reassured many.<br>
<br>Such acknowledgement was in accord with White's own experience as recorded in his &#145;Advertisement&#146; to <span class="italic">Selborne</span>. After specifying a three-fold aim in preparing the volume, he averred that if none of his aims was achieved there was:<blockquote>consolation &hellip; [that] his pursuits, by keeping the body and mind employed [had], under Providence, contributed to much health and cheerfulness of spirits, even to old age: and [also had] led him to the knowledge of a circle of gentlemen [who] afforded him much pleasing information.</blockquote>That White's studies granted him both &#145;pleasing information&#146; as well as cheerful employment is an outcome aspired to by many, but it was an outcome additional to White's declared aims. Of these, the first, to throw &#145;light upon ancient customs and manners &hellip; especially on those that were monastic&#146;, met the purpose of many earlier parish histories. What White attempted, however, in <span class="italic">Selborne</span> was a new understanding of a history of a parish which, he thought, ought to include the study of natural productions as well as antiquities. It is to this new understanding that White's two further aims relate. The wish to induce &#145;a more ready attention to wonders of the Creation&#146;, was, in fact, his main aim and will be commented on below; another was the wish to &#145;have lent a helping hand [through his researches] towards the enlargement of the boundaries of historical and topographical knowledge&#146;. At first sight it might be thought this aim was outside the scope of modern natural history, yet it contains, from a scientific perspective, the essence of White's endeavour.<br>
<br>Sceptical of the accuracy of general natural histories and finding support in Scopoli whose <span class="italic">Annus primus</span> (1769) had led White to claim that writers who &#145;undertake only one district are much more likely to advance natural knowledge than those that grasp at more than they can possibly be acquainted with&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selborne</span>, Barrington, letter 7), White placed his focus on the importance of local natural history. Even within a territory as narrow as his own parish and with near a lifetime of observation, he was to reach two conclusions: that &#145;all nature is so full, that that district produces the greatest variety which is the most examined&#146;; and that &#145;investigations (where a man endeavours to be sure of his facts) can make but slow progress; and all that one [can] collect in many years would go into a very narrow compass&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selborne</span>, Barrington, letter 5). It was with this same belief that he had guided his brother John, at Gibraltar, writing in 1771: &#145;True naturalists will thank you more for the life &amp; conversation of a few animals well studyed &amp; investigated; than for a long barren list of half the Fauna of the globe. Monographers are the best Nat: Historians&#146;  (Foster, &#145;Gibraltar correspondence&#146;, 492&#150;3). While true in behavioural and ecological terms, this applies less to species. White's outright discoveries in terms of the identification of species amount to little, the usual citations being: differentiation of the three English species of leaf warbler, identification of the lesser whitethroat, and discovery of the harvest mouse and the noctule bat.<br>
<br>But White aimed at &#145;life and conversation&#146; and it is satisfaction of that aim that illuminates his wish to enlarge &#145;the boundaries [the understanding] of historical and topographical knowledge&#146; within (and this needs stressing) his native parish. From this perspective White made a contribution at a general level as well as at a particular. In the former category one might adduce the hermaphrodite nature of earthworms, ideas about coloration and sexual selection in birds, notions of territoriality, the comparison of local soils and climates and the effects on husbandry, ideas of microclimates, experimentation with different soils for growing (especially potatoes), bird identification by flight behaviour, and so on; and in the latter category, for his journals and <span class="italic">Selborne</span> are delightedly enriched with observations made in his native place of particular occurrences, the first known sighting of an otter, or the itinerant habits of ring ouzel, the felling of a shrew-ash (despite superstitious protests from village believers in its curative powers over cattle), or the discovery of the <i>centrum phonicum</i> for a fine natural echo in the parish.<br>
<br>This attention on the local ran counter to the spirit of leading contemporaries, many of whom sought the generalization of knowledge, Samuel Johnson, for example, in a vivid floristic image, claiming that the main business of the philosopher was &#145;to examine, not the individual, but the species [for] he does not number the streaks of the tulip, or describe the different shades in the verdure of the forest&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rasselas</span>, 1759). It was precisely White's resistance to generalization, together with his unending flow of rich particularity, that enabled him to fulfil his main aim, that of encouraging his readers to give &#145;a more ready attention&#146; to the flora and fauna of their daily world. &#145;Ordinary&#146; observers are much more ready to respond to what is happening in the back garden than to entertain large ideas about general theory, and it is this focus of White's on the everyday, on what is accessible to the curious observer in any age, that is a principal reason for the continuing life of <span class="italic">Selborne</span>.<br>
<br>And yet, although he has had many imitators (Knapp, <span class="italic">Journal of a Naturalist</span>, 1829, based in Gloucestershire, being one of the closest), nobody has managed to rival the grace and ease of White's writing. In a measure this success must be attributed to his style and personality. Central to this last is a modest acceptance that some aspects of the natural scene are beyond understanding. Such &#145;fear before God&#146; has delighted readers for more than two centuries, and unites the cabinet (of specimens), the laboratory, and the study, not only with the open field and the leafy canopy of a wooded valley but also with the bare roof ledge outside the window, where pigeons coo, sparrows squabble, or the local robin taps for food.<br>
<br>White's <span class="italic">Natural History of Selborne</span> is open to everyone, for everyone has observed much of what it describes. Writer and reader each share the inheritance of the natural world, and delight in what is given, so that <span class="italic">Selborne</span> becomes an expression of universal thanksgiving, treasured by all.<br>
