<span class="headword">White,  Robert</span>  (1802&#150;1874), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, son of James White, a border farmer, was born on 17 September 1802 at the Clock Mill, near Yetholm in Roxburghshire, the son of James White and Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Laidlaw (<i>d</i>. 1829). While he was a boy his father moved to Otterburn in Redesdale, where he herded his father's cattle, and attended local schools. He managed to acquire a knowledge of books, with the encouragement of his father's landlord, James Ellis, a former solicitor in Newcastle upon Tyne, then of Otterburn Hall, a friend and correspondent of Sir Walter Scott. He was sent briefly to Jedburgh as trainee millwright, making bobbins for the weaving trade, but returned to work on the farm. In 1825 he found employment in Newcastle in the counting-house of Robert Watson, a plumber, brass-founder, and millwright, at the High Bridge, where he remained until Watson died forty years later.<br>
<br>At Newcastle, White found time for study and by abstemious living amassed some savings, but his father and brother needed financial help in their farming ventures, leaving little for the purchase of books. His holidays were usually spent rambling on the border with his friend James Telfer the Saughtrees poet, steeping himself in border minstrelsy and gathering knowledge of border life. His first poem, &#145;The Tynemouth Nun&#146;, was written in 1829, and at the suggestion of the antiquary John Adamson (1787&#150;1855) it was printed the same year for the Typographical Society of Newcastle, and enjoyed considerable local popularity. After this he devoted himself to the preservation and reproduction of local legend and song, contributing to many local publications. He was an informant of F. J. Child during the preparation of the latter's work.<br>
<br>In 1852 White became a member of the Newcastle Society of Antiquaries, to which he contributed a paper on the battle of Nevilles Cross  (<span class="italic">Archaeologia Aeliana</span>, 2nd ser., 1.271&#150;303). Encouraged by its reception, he published a volume on the <span class="italic">History of the Battle of Otterburn</span> (1857), adding memoirs of the warriors engaged. This was followed in 1858 by a paper read to the Newcastle society on the battle of Flodden  (ibid., 3.197&#150;236), and in 1871 by a <span class="italic">History of the Battle of Bannockburn</span>. These monographs were rendered valuable by White's intimate acquaintance with local legend, and by his topographical knowledge. He died, unmarried, at his house at 11 Claremont Place, Newcastle, on 20 February 1874.<br>
<br>In addition to his antiquarian papers, White wrote <span class="italic">Poems, Including Tales, Ballads, and Songs</span> (1867), and edited the <span class="italic">Poems and Ballads of John Leyden</span> (1858), with a memoir supplementing that by Sir Walter Scott. Several of his songs are to be found in the <span class="roman">Whistle Binkie</span> series and in Alexander Whitelaw's <span class="italic">Book of Scottish Song</span> (1844). His library of 4400 volumes, rich in the history and topography of Northumberland and the borders, ballads, and chapbooks, was dispersed among his sisters after his death, but in 1942 his great-nephew Professor Sir George White Pickering (1904&#150;1980), regius professor of medicine at Oxford (1956&#150;68), with family help, reassembled the library and presented it to King's College, where it remains in the Robinson Library of the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.<br>
