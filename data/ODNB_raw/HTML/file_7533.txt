<span class="headword">Dering,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1580&#150;1630), <span class="occ">organist and composer</span>, was the illegitimate son of Henry Dering of Liss, Hampshire, and, according to one source, of Lady Elizabeth Grey, sister of Henry Grey, earl of Kent (1547&#150;1614)  (BL, Add. MS 5534). He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, where he supplicated for the degree of BMus on 26 April 1610 stating that he had studied music for ten years. This is at odds with Anthony Wood's statement that Dering &#145;was bred up in Italy where he obtained the name of a most admirable musician&#146;  (Wood, fol. 41<i>v</i>&#150;42). However, it seems likely that Dering did indeed visit Italy in his early adulthood, for a &#145;M<sup>r</sup> Dering&#146;&#151;very likely the composer&#151;is noted as being present in Rome, having visited Venice and &#145;now gone to see more of Italy&#146;, in a letter from Sir Dudley Carleton (the king's envoy in Venice) to Sir John Harrington  (TNA: PRO, SP 99/10, no. 62; 26 June 1612). He probably converted to Catholicism about this time and by 1617 he was organist to the English nuns of the convent of the Blessed Virgin Mary at Brussels. While he was in the Low Countries he published two sets of motets: <span class="italic">Cantiones sacrae quinque vocum</span> and <span class="italic">Cantica sacra &hellip; senis vocibus</span> (P. Phal&egrave;se, Antwerp, 1617 and 1618 respectively); and two sets of canzonettas: <span class="italic">Canzonette a tre voci</span> and <span class="italic">Canzonette a quattro voci</span> (both P. Phal&egrave;se, Antwerp, 1620).<br>
<br>In 1625 Dering returned to England and by 22 December was listed among the &#145;lutes, viols and voices&#146; at the English court; he was paid a salary of &pound;40 per annum. When he was later succeeded by Giles Tomkins, his place was described as &#145;for the virginals with the voices in ordinary&#146;. Dering also became organist to Queen Henrietta Maria and in a warrant of 23 October 1626 he is listed as one of eleven musicians who had served the queen from the previous 25 March. His salary for this appointment was &pound;120 per annum.<br>
<br>Dering's English music, none of which was published in his lifetime, consists of anthems (full and verse) for the Anglican church, fantasias and dances for viols, two madrigals, and the <span class="italic">City Cries</span> and <span class="italic">Country Cries</span> for voices and viols which incorporate popular melodies of the time. His Italianate works, nearly all of which were published, include Catholic church music (Latin motets) and Italian canzonettas and madrigals. These all include a part for continuo instruments and show a complete assimilation of the techniques of contemporary Italian <i>concertato</i> music (which he probably studied during his travels in Italy or from printed Italian music circulating in the Low Countries). A number of his small-scale motets may have been written during his time in Brussels, but most were probably composed in England specifically for Queen Henrietta Maria's Roman Catholic services in her private chapel. One large collection of Catholic liturgical organ music often associated with him (Christ Church, Oxford, MS 89) may not be his work.<br>
<br>Dering died, unmarried, and was buried at St Mary Savoy, London, on 22 March 1630. His motets remained popular after his death and appear in manuscripts throughout the civil war, Commonwealth, and Restoration periods. Thomas Mace reports that, in the days before the civil war, after he and his friends had finished playing consort music, they &#145;did <i>Conclude All</i>, with some <i>Vocal Musick</i>, to the <i>Organ</i>, or (for want of <i>That</i>) to the <i>Theorboe</i> &hellip; <i>viz.</i> <i>Mr Deering's</i> <span class="italic">Gloria patri</span> and other of <i>His Latin Songs</i> &hellip; <i>Wonderfully Rare, Sublime</i> and <i>Divine</i>, beyond all Expression&#146;  (Mace, 235). Anthony Wood  (Wood, s.v. &#145;Hingston&#146;) records that the motets were popular with Oliver Cromwell, and their appeal was such that John Playford published a substantial number of them in his two books of <span class="italic">Cantica sacra</span> (1662 and 1674). The diarist Samuel Pepys noted that on Saturday 22 November 1662 on &#145;meeting Mr. Playford, he did give me his Latin Songs of Mr Deerings, which he lately printed&#146;  (Pepys, 3.263) and on Sunday 10 May 1668 he notes that he taught Mary Mercer to sing &#145;Canite Jehov&aelig;&#146;, presumably Dering's setting  (ibid., 9.194). Dering is important in the history of seventeenth-century English music as one of the first pre-Commonwealth composers to show a commitment to the Italianate <i>stile nuovo</i>.<br>
