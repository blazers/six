<span class="headword">Williams,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Skimmington]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1631&#150;1637), <span class="occ">labourer and protester</span>, of English Bicknor in Gloucestershire, came to fame under the alias of Skimmington as one of the leaders of the protests against royal enclosure in the Forest of Dean. Very little is known of his life apart from the records created as a result of his political activities in the 1630s. From a petition of 1637 seeking his release from imprisonment it is evident that he was married and had several children. Variously described in the legal records as either a labourer or a yeoman, it has been suggested that he might have been a miner. The background to his involvement in the protests was the attempt by the crown to improve its revenues from the Forest of Dean by licensing large-scale enclosure and leasing rights to cut timber and to mine coal and iron ore to courtiers and financiers. This had attracted the hostility of the commoners and free miners in an area whose extensive wastes and commons had seen the growth of a large and increasingly poor population.<br>
<br>Williams appears to have been first involved in the protests on Lady day (25 March) 1631 when a crowd of up to 500, drawn from English Bicknor and other forest communities, marched to the sound of drum and fife and with banners flying and destroyed timber, coal mines, and enclosures within the forest. In a second action the foresters attacked enclosures and pits assigned to Lady Villiers, the widow of Sir Edward, half-brother to the duke of Buckingham, and the London monopolist Sir Giles Mompesson. Protests continuing in Dean as well as in the other royal forests in the south-west, the sheriff tried but failed in November 1631 to capture Williams, now given the sobriquet of Skimmington. Williams was involved in at least one further protest in January 1632 which led to the attorney-general's seeking his arrest. By April of that year Williams had been captured and imprisoned in Gloucester Castle. In the same month, his (unnamed) wife was also included on a warrant for the arrest of a further group of protesters from the Forest of Dean. By late April, Williams had been transferred to Newgate where he was held a prisoner, apparently without any further legal action being taken against him.<br>
<br>John Williams's alias of Skimmington was first noted in a document of November 1631. A skimmington, a long, wooden ladle used in the dairying regions of the south-west, is thought to have given its name to a popular shaming ritual prevalent in the area, which took the form of a heavily ritualized and symbolically charged procession or riding and was most commonly directed against dominant wives whose behaviour towards their husbands challenged the gender order. That the term was also used by the protesters, who talked of burying skimmington to describe the April 1632 action in which the effigy of Mompesson was paraded to the sound of music before being thrown into the disputed pits, hints at why Williams, whose precise role in the protests remains unclear, was given the alias of Skimmington. At the heart of the skimmington in a society where patriarchy served as a model of political, as well as domestic, relations was an association with ideas of order and disorder and of rule and misrule. For protesters such as Williams, who saw the inversion of enclosure as a threat to the liberties of the foresters and a denial of the norms of good lordship and kingship, their actions were intended to symbolize this inversion and, by publicly shaming the enclosers, to right the moral world. Some such thinking may help to explain the popularity of the title of Skimmington in simultaneous protests against the disafforestation and enclosure of other royal forests in the south-west. In the Forest of Braydon three of the leaders took the title of Lady Skimmington and in Gillingham Forest there were attempts to recruit Lady Skimmington to the cause, while elsewhere in Gloucestershire there were claims that Skimmington's lieutenant was to lead an action against enclosures outside the forest. This, and the fact that there was at least one other John Williams caught up in the protests in Braydon in Wiltshire, has led some historians to assume, wrongly, that John Williams of English Bicknor was leader too in these other protests. In 1637, after five years of imprisonment, Williams successfully petitioned for his release and slipped away from historical notice.<br>
