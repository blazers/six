<span class="headword">Bowes,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1597), <span class="occ">diplomat</span>, was the fifth but second surviving son of Richard Bowes (<i>d</i>. 1558), soldier, of Norham, Northumberland, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3048/', "Elizabeth Bowes (bap. 1505, d. in or before 1572)")</script>, protestant exile, daughter and coheir of Roger Aske of Aske, North Riding of Yorkshire, and his wife, Margery. His only surviving brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3050/', "Sir George Bowes (1527&#150;1580)")</script>, who acted as Elizabeth I's marshal in the suppression of the northern rising of 1569&#150;70. His sister Marjory Bowes (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1560) married John Knox. The family was experienced in dealing with border warfare, as Richard Bowes had served Henry VIII, leading a force across the Scottish border in August 1542 following the breakdown of Anglo-Scottish negotiations, but was defeated at Haddon Rig. Robert Bowes matriculated at Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1547 but took no degree. He probably attended Lincoln's Inn in 1549. He married first his cousin Anne (<i>d</i>. in or before 1566), daughter and coheir of Sir George Bowes of Dalden. They had at least one child, Ralph Bowes (<i>d</i>. 1623). In 1566 he married again; his second wife was Eleanor, daughter of Sir Richard Musgrave of Eden Hall, Cumberland. They had no children.<h2>
<a name="EarlyElizabethancareer15581577"></a>Early Elizabethan career, 1558&#150;1577</h2>Bowes was sheriff of co. Durham in 1564 and again in 1569, in which capacity he assisted his brother in defending Barnard Castle against the northern earls. Following this he was put in command of a mounted force whose purpose was to maintain and enforce order on the western border. He was JP for co. Durham from 1561 and for the North Riding from 1569. In addition to his house at Berwick, Bowes held the manor of Great Broughton, Yorkshire, the extensive improvement of which he later claimed cost him &pound;2300. He was MP for Knaresborough in 1563 and appointed to the succession committee in 1566. He was MP for Carlisle in 1571 and Appleby in 1572, owing his return to the patronage of leading noblemen, and was active in parliament.<br>
<br>Henry capitalized on the disarray of the Scots following the battle of Flodden in 1513 by establishing a system of diplomatic espionage, continued by his daughter Elizabeth. Bowes's position as treasurer of Berwick from 1576 placed him ideally for employment on diplomatic missions, and in the periods when he served as resident English ambassador at the Scottish court he watched over the queen's interests and was briefed to gather and maintain a party of men who supplied information and were in the pay of the English sovereign. He was a member of the queen's council in the north from 1574 and JP for Cumberland, Northumberland, Westmorland, and the East and West ridings from 1577. The purpose of Bowes's actions regarding Scotland was to weaken any inclination by James VI's government to form ties with France and to unite factions of the Scottish nobility favourably disposed towards England. The course of his diplomatic career may be traced through the many letters that survive.<br>
<br>James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton, was established as regent of Scotland in 1572 with the task of administering government for the young king, but his position was challenged in the late 1570s; Bowes recorded the first signs of significant opposition in a letter to Henry Hastings, third earl of Huntingdon, dated 28 June 1577. He noted the formation of a party headed by John Stewart, fourth earl of Atholl, William Grey, fourth Lord Ruthven, and Patrick Lindsay, sixth Lord Lindsay. He suggested that steps were being taken to end the dispute between Atholl and Colin Campbell, sixth earl of Argyll, in the hope of adding Argyll to the coalition aimed at increasing their political influence.<h2>
<a name="AmbassadorinScotland15771583"></a>Ambassador in Scotland, 1577&#150;1583</h2>Bowes attempted to broker an accord between the leaders of the two factions and was present at a meeting of Morton, Atholl, and Argyll at Morton's residence at Dalkeith in 1578. In his correspondence Bowes states that the three noblemen agreed to share power amicably, but Morton left for Stirling ahead of the others to take possession of the young king. Such was the tension between the two factions that Argyll and Atholl met Morton, at the head of their respective forces, in the field at Falkirk in August 1578. It was Bowes, in his capacity as English ambassador, who by May 1579 had mediated the truce between the two sides and induced the adversaries to settle their differences without recourse to arms. Nevertheless, it is clear from his correspondence that he seriously doubted whether a formula for peace could be devised. The problem for Bowes was that Elizabeth and her privy council had miscalculated how unpopular Morton's Anglophile regime had become and their mediation, intended to prop the earl up, only worsened their situation and undermined further the Anglo-Scottish amity.<br>
<br>By autumn 1579 a new threat to Morton materialized in the person of Esm&eacute; Stewart, seigneur d'Aubigny, who reached Scotland from France in September. Backed by the Guise family, d'Aubigny seems to have been motivated by personal opportunism rather than by a desire to promote Catholicism. He used his French support to appeal to Scottish Catholics and was quick to establish a personal rapport with the thirteen-year-old James, already resentful of Morton's authority. In alliance with James Stewart, captain of the king's guard, d'Aubigny increased his influence at court and drew in Morton's enemies such as Atholl and Argyll. The threat posed to England by a dominant Catholic faction at the Scottish court that could look for support from either France or Spain was not lost on William Cecil, Baron Burghley, lord treasurer, and Sir Francis Walsingham, principal secretary. In April 1580 Bowes, at that time treasurer of the garrison at Berwick, received &pound;500 and instructions to travel to Scotland, where he was to make use of the money to shore up Morton's crumbling regime.<br>
<br>Bowes arrived in Edinburgh on 27 April and his reports to Walsingham indicate that he found Morton's position very fragile, given that d'Aubigny's assiduous attendance at court strengthened his hold on the king. Bowes suggested the provision of financial support for John Erskine, second or eighteenth earl of Mar, and Archibald Douglas, eighth earl of Angus (both more favourably disposed to England), in order to counter this influence. Before departing for Berwick the ambassador sought to secure further support for Elizabeth with the payment of bribes to the captains of Dumbarton and Edinburgh. Upon his return he sent a barrage of messages to Walsingham stressing that immediate action was needed to save the English party in Scotland, but the queen's attention was elsewhere and his proposals seemed too costly, so his pleas were ignored. Verbal assurances of support had lost their appeal to Morton, who sent word to Bowes through Angus that only a pension of 500 marks to him and 2000 marks to the king could save the situation. So far had Morton's faith in Elizabeth evaporated that towards the end of July he was making overtures to d'Aubigny, despite remonstrations from Bowes. When d'Aubigny took Dumbarton, described by Bowes as the gateway of France into Scotland, the English envoy was sent back to Scotland to do what he could, short of using force.<br>
<br>With such restrictions imposed upon him, Bowes's mission was fraught with difficulty. It was complicated further by the fact that Elizabeth was still negotiating with the French, obliging the English envoy to avoid openly antagonizing d'Aubigny. Forbidden to offer more than verbal encouragement and the promise of the queen's approval, Bowes's efforts to discredit the royal favourite were hindered by James's refusal to hear criticism of d'Aubigny unless he was present to defend himself. Bowes nevertheless did what he could to undermine d'Aubigny by spreading rumours that he was planning to abduct James to France. Beyond the court Bowes also made unsuccessful attempts to arrange a meeting of Anglo-Scottish commissioners to discuss border problems, causing him to send a very pessimistic report concerning control of the marches. This stalemate led to his recall from Scotland at the end of October. Clearly frustrated that the duties of his office were so ill-rewarded, he petitioned the queen in 1582 about his expenses and on 14 December wrote to Walsingham asking to be released from service, a request that was denied.<br>
<br>Dissatisfaction with d'Aubigny, created duke of Lennox in August 1581, increased dramatically in the following year, even though Morton had finally fallen and been executed in June 1581. On 7 August, Walsingham wrote to Bowes that he should inform the duke's opponents that Lennox had discovered a plot against him. There followed the Ruthven raid, in which the sixteen-year-old James was tricked into going from Perth to Ruthven Castle, Perthshire, by the earls of Gowrie (Ruthven), Mar, and Lindsay. Bowes was dispatched by Elizabeth to Scotland in order to convey her support and approval. However, the queen was still not prepared to add weight to her words with firm offers of pensions or financial aid, despite his strenuous declaration that all the benefits of the raid would be lost otherwise. He discovered that James was still favourably disposed towards Lennox and that the Ruthven raiders lacked a following. Mar and Thomas Lyon, master of Glamis, he reported, were trustworthy, but the loyalty of the others to the English cause would have to be bought. News that the French ambassador Bertrand de Salignac de la Motte-F&eacute;n&eacute;lon was travelling to Scotland prompted Bowes to work hard for Lennox's departure before the envoy arrived in January 1583. Bowes's fear was that Motte-F&eacute;n&eacute;lon would try to negotiate a French marriage for James and establish a French party to the prejudice of English interests. During his brief sojourn the envoy was able to achieve little, and English concerns over French influence in Scotland were further calmed when Lennox, having alienated the Scottish church's presbyterian leaders, was forced to flee the country in December 1582.<br>
<br>In June 1583 James, with the aid of James Stewart, earl of Arran, Robert Stewart, earl of March, and Patrick Adamson, archbishop of St Andrews, escaped from Ruthven Castle to St Andrews. Bowes conceded that he was taken completely unawares by the king's flight, in no small part because James had repeatedly assured the envoy of his devotion to England and the protestant cause up to the moment of his departure from Ruthven. Having received the information from Bowes on 31 July that the king's affection for Elizabeth was greatly abated, a panicked Walsingham travelled north to Berwick and proceeded with Bowes to Scotland, where they were coolly received and kept waiting until 9 September, when they were granted audience with James at Perth. The king heard their remonstrations, but was in no mood to change course, and Bowes was withdrawn from Scotland shortly after Walsingham's departure.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears15831597"></a>Final years, 1583&#150;1597</h2>Bowes continued to be involved in Scottish politics and was at Berwick in March 1584 trying to further the plotting of Mar, Angus, and Gowrie against Arran, but he seemed not to know how to influence James, fruitlessly believing that Mary had a strong sway over her son and could be used to help direct his policy. Bowes was MP for Cumberland in 1584, 1586, and 1589, through the patronage of Henry Scrope, ninth Baron Scrope of Bolton. Again, he was an active MP. His diplomatic activity became mundane following James's assumption of personal power, and his long royal service brought him little reward.<br>
<br>On 18 January 1596 Bowes wrote from Edinburgh to his nephew, Sir William Bowes, stating that he was suffering much from ill health and from the broken state of his affairs. He was indebted heavily to the crown and became increasingly inactive. On 15 November 1597 he died at Berwick and was buried there on the following day.<br>
