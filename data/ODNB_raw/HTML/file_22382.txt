<span class="headword">Plimer,  Andrew</span>  (1763&#150;1837), <span class="occ">miniature painter</span>, was born at Wellington, Shropshire, and baptized there on 29 December 1763, the younger son of a clockmaker, Nathaniel Plimer (<i>b</i>. 1726), and his wife, probably Mary Elizabeth or Eliza. Andrew and his elder brother, <a href="#cosubject_22383">Nathaniel [<i>see below</i>]</a>, were both trained as clockmakers but, according to G. C. Williamson, they ran away with a troupe of Gypsies and spent over two years travelling in Wales and the west of England before eventually settling in London. There, in 1781, both brothers entered domestic service, Andrew as a manservant to the miniaturist Richard Cosway, and Nathaniel working for the enamellist Henry Bone. Cosway nurtured the ambitions of the young Andrew Plimer, not only allowing him to act as a studio assistant and teaching him the principles of portraiture in miniature but perhaps even sponsoring Plimer's drawing lessons with the engraver John Hall of Soho. By 1785 Plimer had become sufficiently accomplished to establish his own practice as a miniaturist, working firstly from a studio at 32 Great Maddox Street and then, from 1787 until 1810, at 2 and, later, at 8 Golden Square, London. The middle years of the decade saw Plimer working in Exeter but by 1818 he was back in London, at 15 Upper York Street, near Manchester Square. Meanwhile on 21 February 1801 he had married Joanna Louisa Knight (1774&#150;1861), the daughter of John and Frances Knight of Wicken, Northamptonshire.<br>
<br>From 1786 to 1810 and again in 1819 Plimer exhibited at the Royal Academy. Although he continued in practice until <i>c</i>.1830 he may have experienced difficulty attracting new clientele in his later years as he is known to have travelled widely in search of commissions from about 1820 onwards, visiting Devon, Cornwall, Dorset, Wales, and Scotland. This decline in his fortunes is borne out by the wording of his obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, where he was described as &#145;many years ago an eminent miniature painter in Exeter&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>). Most critics agree that in stylistic terms, too, Plimer's work can be broadly divided into two categories: his early and most successful miniatures, which are usually signed with the initials A. P. on the obverse and dated pre-1790, and his more mannered style of the ensuing years, in which he neither signed nor dated his work. At its best Plimer's work from his first phase is pleasing and highly competent, if a little &#145;hesitant in attack&#146;  (Reynolds, <span class="italic">English Portrait Miniatures</span>, 152); his sitters are individualized, their features well modelled, and the fine hatching that was his hallmark is used to good effect in the backgrounds&#151;as, for example, in <span class="italic">Unknown Officer</span> (1785; Kenwood House, London) or <span class="italic">Unknown Lady</span> (1786; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge). Though Plimer stopped signing his work during the 1790s it tends to be instantly recognizable because of the stylized treatment he adopted for his sitters in this era. Most of his subjects are depicted facing half to the left on larger ivories of about 6&#150;7 cms in height; the eyes, generally elongated, are given a disarming dominance, and his sky backgrounds have become somewhat formulaic. However, some very fine examples of his work belong to this second phase of his career, such as <span class="italic">Eliza Boscombe as a Child</span> (<i>c</i>.1800; Christies, 23 April 1998, lot 155) and his most important work, <span class="italic">The Daughters of Lord Northwick: the Hon. Anne Rushout, the Hon. Harriet Rushout and the Hon. Elizabeth Rushout</span> (&#145;The Three Graces&#146;) (<i>c</i>.1800; Huntington Library and Art Collections, San Marino, California). This miniature, one of a group executed for Lord Northwick, demonstrates Plimer's ability to tie together a group composition effectively, a skill also to be seen in <span class="italic">Maria, Lady Affleck and her Daughters</span> (<i>c</i>.1795; Huntington Library and Art Collections, San Marino, Calfornia). None the less the overriding impression of Plimer's later work, and particularly of his female portraits, is one of deteriorating quality as Plimer strove to produce flattering likenesses of his sitters, an impression heightened perhaps by the numerous nineteenth-century copies and fakes of his work in circulation. But even his poorest portraits can usually be distinguished from fraudulent copies by the underdrawing visible in the strokes of the hair and by the neat, dark areas of cross-hatching in the lower sections of the background. Indeed some of his very last works, executed when poor eyesight had forced him to turn to large coloured drawings on paper, display the graphic skills of which he was still capable; these include <span class="italic">Young Lady in White</span> (1829; priv. coll.; R. Walker, <span class="italic">Secret Passion to Noble Fashion. The World of the Portrait Miniature</span>, 1999, exhibition catalogue, Holburne Museum, Bath).<br>
<br>His reputation fading, Plimer died on 29 January 1837 at Western Cottages, Western Road, Brighton, and was buried on 4 February at Old Hove. He was survived by his wife and four daughters: Louisa (1802&#150;1864), later Mrs John Scott; Joanna (1803&#150;1846); Charlotte (1804&#150;1845); and Selina (1809&#150;1841). A son died in infancy. His wife's younger sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15732/', "Mary Ann Knight")</script>, had been his pupil and worked in a manner very similar to Plimer's with great success. Plimer's elder brother, <a name="cosubject_22383"></a><span class="headword">Nathaniel Plimer</span>  (1757&#150;1822), was born in Wellington, Shropshire, and also pursued a career as a <span class="occ">miniature painter</span> after working for Henry Bone and then training with his brother under Richard Cosway. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1787 to 1815 and at the Incorporated Society of Artists in Suffolk Street, London, in 1790&#150;91. From 1804 to 1814 he was resident in Edinburgh where he was an inaugural member and exhibitor at the Associated Society of Artists (1808). Like his brother, Nathaniel signed only early miniatures, up to 1789, with his initials, NP, but, as he failed to develop the same artificial manner as Andrew Plimer in later years, many of his unsigned works go unrecognized. His technique made more use of stippling, lending a softer touch to his work, as in <span class="italic">Miss Harlow</span> (<i>c</i>.1800; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge). He is thought to have returned to London about 1815 and to have died there in 1822, leaving four children, the youngest of whom, Adela, married Andrew Geddes, the Scottish portrait painter. A portrait of Andrew Plimer by Geddes (1815) is in the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh, and a miniature self-portrait by Nathaniel Plimer (priv. coll.) is on loan to the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh. An extensive collection of Andrew Plimer's miniatures is held at the Huntington Library and Art Collections, San Marino, California; examples by both brothers can be seen at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. A large group of family miniatures by Andrew Plimer was sold at Sothebys on 27 January 1964 (lots 55&#150;80).<br>
