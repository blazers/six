<span class="headword">Brooking, Sir  Harry Triscott</span>  (1864&#150;1944), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 13 January 1864, the son of Lieutenant Arthur Yelverton Brooking (1841&#150;1869) of the Indian army and his wife, Constance (<i>d</i>. 1870). He had a sister, Constance Emily. Brooking was educated at Wellington College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, from which he was commissioned into the South Wales Borderers on 6 February 1884. The following year he was transferred to the 21st Madras infantry of the Indian army. He remained with this regiment (renamed the 61st pioneers in 1903) for the rest of his regimental career.<br>
<br>The Indian army, at the turn of the century, offered numerous opportunities for active employment and Brooking took full advantage of them. He saw combat in Burma (1888&#150;9), where he was mentioned in dispatches; the Chin hills expedition (1892&#150;4); the north-west frontier (1897); and Tirah (1897&#150;8), where he was present at the actions of Chagru Kotal and Dargai. He also obtained staff experience, becoming deputy assistant adjutant-general for the Madras district in 1898. In 1900 he went to China as deputy assistant quartermaster-general, part of the multi-national force dispatched to suppress the Boxer uprising, and was present at the relief of Peking (Beijing). He was again mentioned in dispatches and received the brevet of major. After completing his tour as commanding officer of the 61st pioneers (1906&#150;11) he rejoined the staff. When the First World War broke out he was general staff officer, grade 1, of the 5th (Mhow) division. On 30 November 1889 he had married Amy Agn&egrave;se Smith (<i>d</i>. 1934), daughter of Albert Smith; they had one daughter.<br>
<br>Brooking's wartime career was spent mainly in Mesopotamia. His command of the 12th Indian brigade (20 September 1915 to 7 May 1916) and, later, the 15th Indian division (from 7 May 1916) demonstrated the qualities of self-reliance, initiative, decision, and resolve which he had absorbed from his experience of frontier warfare. In February 1916 he extricated the advanced detachments of the 12th brigade from Butaniyyah in the face of considerable Arab opposition, afterwards inflicting retribution on the villages of hostile tribes. In September 1916 his successful action as general officer commanding 15th division at al-Sahilan, near Nasiriyyah, probably prevented a serious Arab rising. His greatest achievements, however, came on 28&#150;9 September 1917 at Ramadi where his division captured 3500 Turks, and at Khan Baghdadi on 26&#150;7 March 1918 where his composite &#145;Brookforce&#146; captured 4000 Turks.<br>
<br>Brooking was a small, slight figure, but a man of great determination and energy. His operational method was characterized by careful preparation, good intelligence, guile, and speed. He excelled at subterfuge and showed a preference for night-time deployments. His victories at Ramadi and Khan Baghdadi have been described as &#145;among the most perfectly conceived and conducted minor battles of the whole war&#146;  (Anglesey, 144).<br>
<br>Brooking was eight times mentioned in dispatches during the war. He was made CB in 1914, KCB in 1916, KGMG in 1917, and KCSI in 1919. He retired in 1920 and settled to a quiet and private life in Bournemouth with his wife and daughter, Eileen Constance, later Lady Greenway (<i>d</i>. 1963). He died at Marrick, 79 Lansdowne Road, Bournemouth, on 17 January 1944, shortly after his eightieth birthday.<br>
