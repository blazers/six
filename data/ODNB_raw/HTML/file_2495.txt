<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Black,  Joseph</span>  (1728&#150;1799), <span class="occ">chemist and physician</span>, was born on 16 April 1728 in Bordeaux, the sixth of twelve children of John Black, an Ulsterman who was a factor in the wine trade, and his wife, Margaret Gordon (<i>d</i>. 1747). Black's brothers all became manufacturers or tradesmen of various kinds and all were unsuccessful in business. Black alone became an academic and, being financially astute, was often called upon to assist his impoverished siblings.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducation"></a>Early years and education</h2>Black was first educated at home but at the age of twelve he was sent to school in Belfast. In 1744 he went to Glasgow University to continue his education, entering (as was then usual) the arts class. After five years he was prevailed upon by his father to study a subject which would lead to a profession. He chose medicine, coming under the influence of William Cullen (1710&#150;1790), who had been appointed to a lectureship in chemistry in 1747. Black did not, however, graduate from Glasgow, for in 1752 he transferred to Edinburgh University where medical teaching had a higher reputation and was better established. For graduation, a thesis had to be produced. Black took this work very seriously (not all students did) and he involved himself in chemical experiments on alkalis. Causticity, the property produced when alkaline earths such as chalk are roasted in a lime kiln, had been a matter of considerable discussion by medical professors at Edinburgh University. Because he did not wish to become embroiled in their specific quarrels, Black conducted his research on a substance similar to limestone, magnesia alba. He initially believed that this substance was simply another progenitor of quicklime and lime water and his research started with limited aspirations. It led, however, to a new theory of causticity and, later, to the first chemical identification of a gas. After heating a weighed quantity of the magnesia alba, Black noticed that the weight of the substance which remained was less than that of the original white powder. The weight lost could be replaced by reacting the product with potash in solution. The potash must have contained the gas which was driven off, which Black called fixed air. Black offered his thesis in 1754 and graduated MD. He then extended his work to experiments on limestone and he showed in a paper presented to the Philosophical Society in 1755 and published one year later in a refined paper that fixed air could be distinguished from the air which makes up the atmosphere. The series of experiments by which he arrived at this conclusion are the most important experiments which Black conducted. He confirmed the view of his teacher, Charles Alson, that when lime is produced by roasting chalk the caustic properties acquired by the former do not derive from the absorption of fiery particles from the heating process but are a property of the lime itself.<br>
<br>In experiments similar to those previously performed for his thesis, Black showed that both chalk and lime combine with the same quantity of acid to form salts, and that a given weight of chalk can be recovered by forming lime and then reacting this with a solution of potash. The explanation is the same in both cases: the lime combines with air contained in the alkali. He then considered a paradox. Lime in solution should combine with air dissolved in water to form a small amount of chalk as an insoluble precipitate, but this does not happen; one explanation might be that on solution of the lime, the air might be driven off. Black tested this by placing two vessels under a bell jar, then reducing the pressure with an air pump. He observed that the same quantity of air bubbles off from both liquids. Clearly this explanation is not tenable. The air in the lime solution was not the sort which formed a chalk precipitate. This &#145;fixed&#146; air and atmospheric air are not chemically the same. Black was the first to show, decisively, that gases can be differentiated in the same way as can solids and liquids.<h2>
<a name="Glasgow17561766andearlyteaching"></a>Glasgow, 1756&#150;1766, and early teaching</h2>The elderly and poorly regarded Edinburgh professor of chemistry, Andrew Plummer, died in 1756 and Black's former Glasgow teacher, Cullen, was appointed in his place. This allowed Black to apply for the Glasgow lectureship. He was successful and later he was elevated to the title of professor. His main research interests in Glasgow were conducted on the properties of heat, interests probably inherited from Cullen's own work. Black considered the phenomenon of heat transfer to or from a body on liquefaction or solidification, evaporation or condensation, which he noticed could occur without a change in temperature being registered on a thermometer. He had been intrigued that when snow melts to form ice it does so over a period of time, not instantaneously. Black introduced the term &#145;latent heat&#146;, that being the quantity of heat which needed to be supplied to the snow before it would melt. He also discovered that different bodies have different capacities for heat: when equal volumes of mercury and water at different temperatures were mixed, the temperature of the mixture at equilibrium was found to be closer to the initial temperature of the water than that of the mercury. This led to a concept of &#145;specific heat&#146;. Black never published his findings on heat, though he presented some of the results to the Literary Society in Glasgow in 1762 and he taught his ideas to his students throughout his long teaching career.<br>
<br>Also working on heat experiments at Glasgow, though apparently somewhat independently, was James Watt (1736&#150;1819), then mathematical instrument maker to the university. The two men became lifelong friends and Watt was able to supply Black with furnishings for his laboratory. Black formally formed a partnership with Watt, along with Alexander Wilson (1714&#150;1786), a typefounder who later became professor of astronomy. Black was to help finance Watt's early endeavours at Glasgow, debts which were not repaid for several years. From 1766, when Black moved to Edinburgh, they were never again to live in the same place but kept up a lively and informative correspondence.<br>
<br>Black's reputation as an inspired teacher of chemistry began to grow in his early years at Glasgow and later at Edinburgh, attracting numbers of foreign students to undertake courses. Although formally part of the medical curriculum, many more students attended the lectures than ever intended to graduate in medicine. Chemistry was a rapidly developing subject and Black's audience included many who wanted to experience the intellectual stimulation which it provided. A significant proportion had not even matriculated; all that was necessary was to pay the 3 guinea fee for the mid-November to mid-May course comprising about 120 lectures. At Edinburgh, only about 20 per cent of those following medical lectures would graduate as doctors of medicine. Black did not vary the basic structure of the lecture series throughout his teaching career. Introductory lectures consisted of definitions and an outline history of chemistry. Following this there were four sections: the general effects of heat (expansion, fluidity, and inflammation); the general effects of mixture; chemical apparatus; and the &#145;chemical history&#146; of bodies. This last, and largest, section was divided into salts, earths, inflammable substances, metals, and waters. Though the content of the lectures was to some extent kept up to date by intelligence provided by Black's wide circle of correspondents and his own reading, the course must have seemed to be very dated by the time he retired. Nevertheless, his reputation as an accomplished lecturer, combined with his skill at performing lecture demonstrations, did not dim even when he was close to retirement. The lectures were published after Black's death (as well as the British edition there were German and American ones) in a somewhat restructured form, the editor being John Robison, professor of natural philosophy at Edinburgh. Robison initially considered his task as an act of piety, though he became disillusioned before long with Black's outmoded approach.<h2>
<a name="Chemicalconsultancy"></a>Chemical consultancy</h2>After he had taught for only a few years at Glasgow efforts were made to attract Black back to Edinburgh. In a complex series of moves which involved his former teacher, Cullen, the chair of medicine and chemistry was vacated and Black was appointed to it. Curiously, the move to Edinburgh marked the end of Black's researches into fundamental chemical concepts. It was not the end of his experimental work, however; it is clear that he spent considerable periods of time in his laboratory. His work was largely directed to investigations which would improve industrial processes and benefit public health. At Glasgow, he had provided metal analyses of minerals for landowners anxious to exploit their estates. This was all part of a drive towards &#145;improvement&#146;, a process which had started early in the eighteenth century in Scotland following the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> of 1707. An early form of financial assistance had been made available from the board of trustees for manufactures in Scotland, established by the government, whereby an annual sum of money was set aside initially to encourage the coarse woollen industry. The scope of assistance was increased and from 1727 help was made available for the herring, linen, and woollen industries. Black and his colleagues were involved in proposals put to the board and in adjudicating proposals of others made to it. A particularly important commodity to Scotland was linen. A crisis had arisen in the 1750s when the price of the agent used for bleaching, caustic potash, rose sharply. The alternative, sour milk, was slow reacting and less effective. Black's colleague, the professor of materia medica, Francis Home, was awarded a premium by the board for proposing dilute sulphuric acid, though it was considered by many to have a destructive effect on the fabric. Black set out to discover cheaper ways of making caustic potash, and showed that kelp, a form of seaweed commonly found around Scottish islands, could be economically turned into the alkali. For this, he was awarded a premium in 1783. Somewhat earlier, Black had sought an alternative means of alkali production by chemical reaction. He had the idea about 1766 that lime and common salt might react to produce soda. This was taken up with enthusiasm by Watt and John Roebuck, a manufacturer of vitriol and leading industrial chemist. The reactants were formed into bricks or cakes and from these walls were built. After a few months, crystals of mild alkali (soda) were formed on the surface and could be scraped off, but the yield was low and the time needed for reaction long. Black seems to have realized the limitations of the process from an early date, but all the same experiments continued until well into the 1780s, with Black playing an unenthusiastic role.<br>
<br>As assessors for the board of manufactures, Black and the geologist James Hutton, a friend who shared many of Black's scientific interests, were asked in 1783 to adjudicate the effectiveness of a new design of furnace for the production of pig iron by a founder in Leith. Though the furnace was not a success, they took significant pains in their judgement and the episode illustrates the efforts being made in Scotland, with the help of the intellectual community, to establish innovative processes for the promotion of industry. A further example, in which Black's economic as well as his technical assessment was important, was the advice he gave to Archibald Cochrane, earl of Dundonald. Lord Dundonald had discovered that if ships' hulls were coated with tar the destructive effect of worms eating their way through the wood could be considerably lessened. He had established a tar works at Culross, on the Firth of Forth, to produce tar by the distillation of coal in closed vessels. Dundonald's business skills were not sophisticated enough: though the process seemed to be potentially profitable, he had immediate financial problems. Black was called in as a consultant to check the technological and financial viability of the scheme. His estimates took many factors into account including the significant one of whether or not the country was in a state of war&#151;in time of war the demand for tar would be much greater and its value higher. He also considered increased profitability which would derive from selling the by-products of the process&#151;varnish from the resin, coke which might be used for iron production in the nearby Carron iron works, and so on. Dundonald was guided by Black to proceed and applied to parliament for an extension to his patent. The advice proved correct and by 1788 Dundonald's British Tar Company was yielding a clear annual profit of &pound;5000. Referring to this success, Sir John Dalrymple, solicitor to the board of excise (and entrepreneur himself) described Black as &#145;the best judge, perhaps in Europe, of such inventions&#146;  (Dalrymple, 6).<br>
<br>Black's correspondence reveals a wide range of topics on which he was approached to offer advice. In addition to those mentioned already, these included sugar refining, ceramic glazing, dyeing, brewing, metal corrosion, salt extraction, glass making, vinegar manufacture, the properties of materials, and water analysis. This last was at the request of the Edinburgh and Leith authorities who were anxious about the quality of the water supply being provided from various sources. For this work Black devised a delicate balance for weighing small quantities of solid matter derived from the water samples which he was sent.<h2>
<a name="Medicine"></a>Medicine</h2>Black had originally trained as a physician and he practised, to a very limited extent, throughout his career; he mentions that private patients were occupying him from as early as February 1753. Only the most famous of his patients are known. He advised Walter Scott, father of the future author Sir Walter Scott (1771&#150;1832), that his son might contract consumption if his tuberculous nurse were not dismissed. Both Edinburgh philosophers, Adam Ferguson and David Hume, consulted Black, and it was he who appreciated the incurable nature of Hume's last illness (other physicians had not) and who informed him of its fatal consequences. Black laid great stress on the benefits of fresh air, exercise (he rode for this reason), and a plain diet including milk and vegetables.<br>
<br>Black was closely involved in the two major Scottish medical institutions of his time, the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. He served as a manager to the infirmary on four occasions between 1771 and 1794, his responsibilities being to make regular inspections and to report these to the board. He also acted, briefly, as physician to the infirmary. Black was admitted a member of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow in 1757, and as a fellow of the Edinburgh Royal College in 1767. He played a significant role in the life of the college, serving as its president from 1788 to 1790. He was a member of the revision committee for the sixth, seventh, and eighth editions of the college's <span class="italic">Pharmacopoeia Edinburgensis</span> of 1774, 1783, and 1794, taking particular interest in mercurial and antimonial preparations. Black was appointed principal physician to George III in Scotland (though the king never, in fact, visited Scotland). He was a founding fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and was elected a member of the Imperial Academy of St Petersburg, the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Royale de M&eacute;decine and the Acad&eacute;mie Royale des Sciences of France. Catherine the Great tried unsuccessfully to persuade him to teach in St Petersburg.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsandreputation"></a>Final years and reputation</h2>Black ceased teaching in 1796, handing over to his chosen successor, Thomas Charles Hope (1766&#150;1844), son of John Hope (1725&#150;1786), professor of botany. Towards the end of his career the aspect of his teaching which seemed particularly behind the times was his approach to combustion. Through most of the eighteenth century, the accepted explanation of burning was offered by the phlogiston theory, propounded in the previous century. Phlogiston was said to be an invisible, weightless substance which was given off when inflammable substances were burned or metals calcined. When Black's contemporary Henry Cavendish (1731&#150;1810) discovered hydrogen in 1766 some considered this to be pure phlogiston. On the other hand, the chemist (and religious dissenter) Joseph Priestley (1733&#150;1804), on heating the calx of mercury found that a gas was produced which strongly supported burning and living systems. He believed this to be atmospheric air without its phlogiston component (&#145;dephlogisticated air&#146;). At the same time the French chemist Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier, produced and studied the gas and suggested that it was a chemical species which he called <i>oxig&egrave;ne</i>. This theory, which he developed in a sophisticated way, was formulated by 1777 and it gradually overturned the phlogiston theory. Black was very slow to accept this changed view&#151;certainly he was not yet won over in the mid 1780s, though by 1790, in a letter to Lavoisier, he wrote that he had:<blockquote>been habituated 30 years to believe and teach the doctrine of Phlogiston &hellip; I felt much aversion to the new system &hellip; This aversion however proceeded from the power of habit alone has gradually subsided &hellip; Your plan &hellip; is infinitely better supported than the former Doctrine. (Black to Lavoisier, 24 Oct 1790, Archives Nationales, Paris, Lavoisier MSS, letters and notes 1770&#150;1794)</blockquote>Black's students had, however, been discussing enthusiastically the new theory five years earlier in their own chemical society (which is thought to be the first of its kind).<br>
<br>Though Black was slow to accept this most significant of chemical theories, his popularity as a lecturer did not wane, with classes of well over 200 students regularly subscribing each year. Attending with the students were well-established chemists who wanted to hear Black describe the seminal experiments which he had performed many years earlier (&#145;the historian of his own discoveries&#146; as Henry Brougham put it). For those who did not require as rigorous a programme Black put on more popular courses. James Boswell (1740&#150;1795) attended one such series for members of the legal profession in 1775. Though Black's fame was widespread, this did not arise from self-promotion. He steadfastly refused to publish his work, though urged to do so by his friends. As Robison put it &#145;Dr Black was perhaps &hellip; too severe in his observations on the hurried publications of some chemists, which he called slovenly, and to consider as literary manufacture for profit&#146;. He wrote only two really significant papers for publication: the MD thesis (in Latin), <span class="italic">De humore acido a cibis orto, et magnesia alba</span> (1754), and the much developed further paper, &#145;Experiments upon magnesia alba, quicklime, and some other alcaline substances&#146; in <span class="italic">Essays and Observations, Physical and Literary</span> (1756). He published nothing on heat, though a pirated version of his lectures on the subject appeared anonymously, <span class="italic">An Enquiry into the General Effects of Heat</span> (1770). A number of letters written by Black were published by their recipients in his lifetime, which annoyed him. A letter to the president of the Royal Society on the subject of the effect of having boiled water on its freezing point was published in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> (1775), as was a letter on the temperature of mercurial congelation (1783). The <span class="italic">Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh</span> for 1794 includes a paper by Black on the analysis of some hot springs in Iceland.<br>
<br>Black had a thin and pale physique. He frequently complained about his poor health and took care of himself, renting houses on the edge of Edinburgh for long summer breaks. He disliked travelling and avoided it as much as possible; many eminent men of the day seemed happy enough to come to Edinburgh in order to call on him. Black was sociable in the manner of his day, attending a variety of dining clubs regularly with male friends, the circle including Cullen, Hutton, Hume, Smith, Ferguson, and the eccentric Lord Monboddo. Black could play the flute, sing, and draw skilfully. Though he never married, he appears to have enjoyed the company of intelligent women. After what may have been a heart attack he died on 6 December 1799 at Nicolson Street, Edinburgh, and was buried on 13 December in Greyfriars churchyard.<br>
<br>In the second half of the eighteenth century Black was widely known throughout the academic communities of Europe and North America. He helped to maintain and develop the reputation of the Edinburgh medical school as the leading place of study of its age. On the other hand, he had a conservative outlook and did not encourage practical skills among his students. No research school was to develop at Edinburgh, and after Black's death there was a relative decline in its status. He had no pupils who became major chemists but he stimulated many students to become competent ones. His own significance as a chemist lies in the work of a few years in the 1750s. His meticulous quantitative technique and his logical mind led to the first chemical characterization of a gas. Other chemists, using similar methods, followed, discovering more and more new species. Black can be seen as the modest initiator of the age of pneumatic chemistry. His work on theoretical concepts of heat was also of great importance and was widely acclaimed. The influence of this on Watt's development of more efficient steam engines is difficult to assess. Watt was anxious to assert that his practical work was independent of Black's ideas on latent heat.<br>
<br>Important though his conceptual work was, Black's contribution to Scottish industrialization and teaching must be properly recognized. When he was born in 1728, industry in the country was in an embryonic state and the youthful medical school, established only two years earlier, regarded chemistry purely in terms of its pharmaceutical applications. At the time of his death seventy-one years later Scottish industry was poised for its great leap forward in the nineteenth century and chemistry had become recognized as an independent subject. Black had much to do with both these changes.<br>
