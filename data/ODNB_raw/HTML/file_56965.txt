<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jacob,  Naomi Eleanor Clare</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Ellington Gray; <em>known as </em>Naomi Ellington Jacob]</span>  (1884&#150;1964), <span class="occ">writer and actress</span>, was born on 1 July 1884 at 20 High Saint Agnes Gate, Ripon, Yorkshire, the daughter of Samuel Jacob, a German Jew and schoolmaster, and Selina Sara (Nina) Ellington, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Collinson (<i>b</i>. 1863), a writer who published under the pseudonym Nina Abbott. She had a younger sister. Naomi Jacob's father's ancestors had migrated from Spain to Holland and then Poland, where his grandparents had been killed in the pogroms; Samuel Jacob's father had escaped from Poland to Germany as a boy. The Collinsons, in contrast, were yeomen who had been firmly rooted on the same plot of land in Yorkshire for over three hundred years. Naomi saw her lively mother as the greatest influence on her, claiming in <span class="italic">Me: Yesterday and To-Day</span> that she inherited her literary skills from her. Her mother &#145;had the gift of making whatever she talked of&#151;live&#146; and was also a rebel, a trait she passed on to Naomi  (<span class="italic">Yesterday and To-Day</span>, 143), while she recollected that her father was &#145;always stern and Teutonic about things that didn't really matter&#146;  (ibid., 208). It is thought that he may have been a model for the brutish Yorkshire husbands she repeatedly portrayed in her novels  (Jasper, 208). However, she was proud of his Jewish heritage, reacted strongly against antisemitism throughout her life, and warmly portrayed Jewish life in her Gollantz novels.<br>
<br>While Jacob remained very attached to Yorkshire, using the setting and its people as subject matter in her fiction, she hated her schooling in and around Yorkshire. She attended a number of private schools, including Skelfield and Sharow, before moving on to Leeds higher grade school. Her gawky boyish appearance and acerbic manner did not endear her to her teachers, who accused her of &#145;showing off&#146;  (<span class="italic">Yesterday and To-Day</span>, 33). Ironically, at the age of fifteen, Jacob was forced to take up teaching at a school in Middlesbrough owing to &#145;family reverses&#146;, which may have included her father's death  (Jasper, 209). Although she loved children, she &#145;hated the petty restrictions&#146; of the profession and left it at the age of eighteen to become the secretary of variety performer Marguerite Broadfoote  (<span class="italic">Yesterday and To-Day</span>, 35). Broadfoote was possibly Jacob's first female lover. It has been suggested that as a young woman Jacob was married for a fortnight, but this was never mentioned in her memoirs  (Baker, 302). Thus began her long association with the stage, including performing in vaudeville before the First World War.<br>
<br>Jacob converted to Roman Catholicism when she was about eighteen, having been brought up in the Church of England. She also plunged into socialism (she was a Labour Party campaigner) and the suffrage movement (she joined the Women's Social and Political Union in 1912). At the outbreak of war several of her passions found a focus in the Actresses' Franchise League, a branch of which assigned volunteer tasks to women. Jacob acted as secretary for a toy factory before founding the Three Arts Employment Fund with the purpose of directing actors into war work. During the last two years of the war she served as a captain in the Women's Legion and ran a munitions factory in Willesden, before tuberculosis forced her to enter a sanatorium.<br>
<br>By 1920 Jacob had recovered, returned to the stage, and begun acting in films. (Most notably she appeared with John Gielgud in <span class="italic">The Ringer</span> in 1936.) She published her first novel, <span class="italic">Jacob Ussher</span>, a best-seller, in 1925. After rapidly writing several more, Naomi had health troubles again, and in 1930 she was ordered to leave England for a warmer clime. She chose Sirmione on Lake Garda, Italy, where she lived for most of the rest of her life. In 1928 Jacob appeared for the defence of lesbian novelist Radclyffe Hall's <span class="italic">The Well of Loneliness</span>, and she developed a friendship with Hall and her companion Una Troubridge. They frequently visited Jacob's &#145;Casa Mickie&#146;, (named after the nickname Naomi adopted when she began to express her masculine identity more openly), which she shared intermittently with her lovers Sadie Robinson and later Marjorie Zamble, a married woman with two children.<br>
<br>During the 1930s Jacob embarked on the Gollantz series of novels and achieved widespread recognition with the third volume, <span class="italic">Four Generations</span> (1934). It chronicles the tribulations of Emmanuel Gollantz, the eldest son of a Jewish antique dealer. Though married for only two years, Emmanuel and his smart wife, Viva, willingly agree to separate and later divorce: she pursues livelier men and he returns to Italy and the great love of his life, Juliet, an opera singer ten years his senior. He experiences a year of bliss with Juliet, before she dies and leaves him with their infant to raise. The novel is essentially a late version of the Edwardian marriage-problem novel, with a modern glaze of frankness and a taste of bitterness. The series as a whole, however, is Edwardian in its assumption of the importance of inherited family traits, with the Gollantz family described as tribal and quixotic.<br>
<br>In 1940, after Italy had entered the Second World War, Jacob was evacuated to England via France and Gibraltar with nothing much except the clothes on her back. She joined the Entertainments National Service Association, and became famous for her flamboyant appearance&#151;signature monocle, crew-cut hair, and First World War Women's Legion uniform&#151;and humorous performances throughout the Mediterranean and Africa.<br>
<br>On returning to Sirmione following the war, Jacob continued to produce two books per year. Increasingly she nostalgically focused on Yorkshire settings and romantic plots. Typically her alienated heroines make sacrifices, perhaps in loveless, even abusive marriages before their brutish first husbands die and they discover their soulmates, as in <span class="italic">Late Lark Singing</span> (1957). The best of these novels are well crafted, and contain vividly realized settings and some fine psychological analysis. From the 1930s Jacob also wrote a series of &#145;Me&#146; memoirs, beginning with <span class="italic">Me: a Chronicle about other People</span> (1933) and ending with <span class="italic">Me and the Stage</span> (1964). <span class="italic">Me and the Swans</span> (1963) recounts her friendship with Hall and Troubridge. In these quirky hybrids of reminiscence, advice, and essays Jacob leaps from interest to interest &#145;like an elderly gazelle&#146;, as she admits: topics include flowers, her beloved cats, travel recommendations, music-hall memories, Italian art, and nuggets of wisdom  (<span class="italic">Yesterday and To-Day</span>, 252). One topic she never broaches in her books (she wrote over seventy) is lesbianism, a sensitive exploration of which might have given her conventional stories greater staying power.<br>
<br>Although Jacob described herself as &#145;inordinately shy&#146;, she loved the limelight and, according to her friend Bransby Williams, was &#145;a jolly, boisterous laughing companion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Yesterday and To-Day</span> 112, 211). She was short and stocky, a physique she called &#145;foursquare&#146;, and this in combination with her short, brushed-back wavy hair, heavy horn-rimmed glasses, and traditional male attire left an impression not easily forgotten  (ibid., 113). Jacob died in Sirmione on 27 August 1964 of a heart attack. Her books still claim a wide readership.<br>
