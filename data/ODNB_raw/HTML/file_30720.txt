</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bentley,  Edmund Clerihew</span>  (1875&#150;1956), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in London on 10 July 1875, the eldest son of John Edmund Bentley, a civil servant in the queen's bench office, and his wife, Margaret Richardson Clerihew. He was at St Paul's School in the days of Frederick Walker, and formed there his lifelong friendship with G. K. Chesterton. He was a member of the history eighth, newly created by Walker, and won a history exhibition at Merton College, Oxford. He fell in love with the college at once and quickly and gratefully absorbed the spirit of Oxford. At the Oxford Union he was an effective debater in a quiet and scholarly style and became president in 1898. John Simon, F. W. Hirst, and John Buchan were among his friends; he knew Hilaire Belloc slightly, but it was not until later that he became close friends with him. His interests during his Oxford years were not confined to political and intellectual discussion: he was captain of the Merton boat club, but gave up rowing in his fourth year in order to work for his degree. One great disappointment of his life was his failure in 1898 to obtain a first in history.<br>
<br>In 1898 Bentley went down from Oxford and read for the bar. He did well in his examinations at the Inner Temple, London, became a pupil in William Hansell's chambers in 1900, and was called to the bar in 1902. One of his closest friends recorded that Bentley had all the qualifications of a successful barrister except the legal mind. On the other hand, he had from his schooldays onwards been active with his pen. At St Paul's he had been a contributor to <span class="italic">The Debater</span>, founded by his friend Lucian Oldershaw; at Oxford he had written regularly for <span class="italic">Isis</span> and for <span class="italic">The J. C. R.</span>, the magazine in which Belloc's <span class="italic">Lambkin's Remains</span> first appeared. While still in chambers he wrote light verse for <span class="italic">Punch</span> under the critical eye of Owen Seaman, and by the end of 1899 he was a regular contributor to <span class="italic">The Speaker</span>, the Liberal weekly edited by J. L. Hammond.<br>
<br>On 14 June 1902 Bentley married Violet Alice Mary (1878/9&#150;1949), fourth daughter of General Neil Edmonstone Boileau, of the Bengal staff corps. They had one daughter and two sons, of whom the younger, Nicolas [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30809/', "Bentley, Nicolas Clerihew (1907&#150;1978)")</script>], went on to illustrate his father's books, as well as many others. Bentley's marriage was one of the reasons for his decision in 1901 to become a professional journalist and to join the staff of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>. Its editor was Rudolph Chambers Lehmann, a good Liberal, a strong opponent of the South African War, and a great oarsman. Thus Bentley felt thoroughly at home in his new work and with his new colleagues, among whom were Herbert Paul, H. W. Massingham, and Harold Spender. The owner of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> was George Cadbury, who, as a Quaker, was regarded by Bentley as a serious-minded nonconformist, but still commendable: &#145;if all business men were Quakers, I do not think we should be any the worse off&#146;  (Bentley, <span class="italic">Those Days</span>). Nevertheless, Lehmann fell out with the Cadbury family on a matter of principle, &#145;and journalism knew him no more&#146;. Lehmann was succeeded by A. G. Gardiner, under whom Bentley in due course became deputy editor. In that capacity he was faced at times with critical decisions and he confessed that he enjoyed the experience. When the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> was amalgamated with the <span class="italic">Morning Leader</span>, Bentley felt that he was no longer in sympathy with Liberal journalism and in 1912 he joined the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, with which he remained for twenty-two years.<br>
<br>Had Bentley confined his activities to leading articles, he might well have been little known and gradually forgotten. In fact, his name is linked with two highly individual achievements: he added a new word to the language and he wrote what Chesterton once described as the finest detective novel of the century. As he sat in the science class at St Paul's at the age of sixteen, the following lines came into his head:<blockquote>
<div>Sir Humphrey Davy<br>
</div>
<div>Abominated gravy.<br>
</div>
<div>He lived in the odium<br>
</div>
<div>Of having discovered Sodium.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Such was the beginning of what Chesterton called the &#145;severe and stately form of free verse known as the Clerihew&#146;. Sir Humphrey soon had a number of companions, and their lives were entered into a notebook with appropriate sketches by Chesterton. Bentley chose to drop his surname for the occasion and <span class="italic">Biography for Beginners</span> by E. Clerihew, with illustrations by G. K. C., was published in 1905. The book did not have an immediate success, but in Bentley's own words, &#145;in course of time it seemed to find its way into the hands of connoisseurs of idiocy everywhere&#146;. <span class="italic">More Biography</span> followed in 1929; <span class="italic">Baseless Biography</span>, with illustrations by the author's son Nicolas, in 1939; finally <span class="italic">Clerihews Complete</span> appeared in 1951. It should be noted that the drawings of Clerihew in the illustrations are themselves caricatured portraits of the author.<br>
<br>In 1910 Bentley thought of a new kind of detective story. Like all boys of his generation he had revelled in the Sherlock Holmes series; but Holmes's eccentricities and his reputed infallibility irritated him and he conceived the notion of a detective's convincing solution being proved wrong in the end. The result of his meditation was <span class="italic">Trent's Last Case</span>, published as one of Nelson's two-shilling novels in 1913. It was a best-seller immediately, and was published in the USA as <span class="italic">The Woman in Black</span>: amid the torrential output of detective stories in that period, it still holds its distinctive place. Bentley's later books are <span class="italic">Trent's Own Case</span>, written with H. Warner Allen (1936); <span class="italic">Trent Intervenes</span> (sixteen short stories, 1938); and <span class="italic">Elephant's Work</span> (1950).<br>
<br>Bentley was happy in, and proud of, his profession as a journalist. At the outbreak of the Second World War he returned to the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>; but the worlds that he loved best&#151;Oxford in the nineties and pre-1914 Fleet Street&#151;had vanished and he recalled them nostalgically in <span class="italic">Those Days</span> (1940). Bentley died at his home, 10 Porchester Terrace, Paddington, on 30 March 1956.<br>
