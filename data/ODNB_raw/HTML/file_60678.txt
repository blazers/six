<span class="headword">Goodbody,  Mary Ann <span class="st"> [Buzz]</span></span>  (1946&#150;1975), <span class="occ">theatre director</span>, was born at 12 Clifton Hill, London, on 25 June 1946, the daughter of Douglas Maurice Goodbody, a barrister, and his wife, Marcelle Yvonne Rubin, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Raphael. She attended the Francis Holland School in London and Roedean School before studying for a degree at the University of Sussex (1964&#150;7). A university production that she devised and directed of Dostoyevsky's <span class="italic">Notes from the Underground</span> won her a prize at the national student drama festival and brought her to the attention of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) director John Barton. In 1967 she joined the RSC as Barton's personal assistant. By 1969 she had worked her way up to assistant director. On 9 September 1967 she married Edward Geoffrey Buscombe (<i>b</i>. 1941/2), from whom she was later separated.<br>
<br>Buzz Goodbody's growing commitment to feminism meant that in 1970 she became involved in founding one of the first feminist theatre companies to emerge in the wake of the second women's liberation movement: the Women's Street Theatre Group. Her feminist leanings and left-wing politics&#151;she was an outspoken, self-declared socialist-Marxist&#151;fed into her work at the RSC. In 1970 she took on responsibility for Theatreground, the educational, touring section of the Shakespeare company. Her abridged touring version of <span class="italic">King John</span> adopted a political, cartoon style that antagonized traditional critics such as John Russell Brown, while others, such as Colin Chambers, argued that here &#145;was the flavour of Littlewood, the living newspaper, a fast-moving, fluent, cartoon-strip production&#146;  (Chambers, 28). Moreover, Chambers observed and speculated: &#145;[Peter] Brook, who was an inspiration for Buzz Goodbody, was &#147;taken by the vigour&#148; of <span class="italic">John</span>, which he found &#147;full of life, energetic, disrespectful&#148;. What would the critics have said if his name had been on the programme instead of an unknown woman's?&#146;  (ibid., 29). After <span class="italic">King John</span>, Goodbody worked with another RSC director, Terry Hands, on a piece about the general strike of 1926, which was eventually shelved for a less than successful production of a drama from the 1590s, <span class="italic">Arden of Faversham</span>. For the 1971 season at The Place, London, she directed a well-received production of Trevor Griffiths's <span class="italic">Occupations</span>, a contemporary political play about revolution.<br>
<br>As the first woman director on the staff of the RSC, Goodbody had to contend with the male domination and bias of the company, which, by all accounts, proved a difficult professional and personal struggle, but one that she incorporated into her production work. <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, her first mainstage production for the RSC (1973), with Eileen Atkins as Rosalind, was nicknamed the &#145;women's lib&#146; production of the play. Analytical accounts of the success or otherwise of the production's feminism are mixed; critics are generally agreed on the contemporary rather than traditional feel that Goodbody brought to her treatment of Shakespeare's comedy.<br>
<br>From 1973 to 1974 Goodbody was assistant to Trevor Nunn in his season of Roman plays. In 1974 she was appointed artistic director of the RSC's alternative experimental venue, the Other Place, which opened in Stratford upon Avon. For the Other Place, Goodbody directed a production of <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, which subsequently went to The Place, in London, and to New York, where it was presented at the Brooklyn Academy in 1975. In contrast to the more lavish RSC productions, Goodbody's <span class="italic">King Lear</span> worked with a small budget of &pound;150 (as compared, for example, with the &pound;25,000 for the set of Nunn's Roman plays). Yet again Goodbody's feminism and politics gave direction to her work: a prologue politicized issues around poverty and old age; Lear's daughters were represented as strong women doing battle with a difficult father (the roles of the husbands were all cut).<br>
<br>Goodbody's last production was <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, which officially opened at the Other Place on 15 May 1975, with Ben Kingsley in the title role. Elsom describes how the production &#145;used the temporary shed of The Other Place to create the atmosphere of a totalitarian, military state&#146;  (Elsom, 175). On 12 April 1975, a month before the play's official opening, Buzz Goodbody committed suicide at her home, 125 Highbury Hill, Islington, London. Several critics echoed Elsom's view that her death had &#145;robbed the theatre of one of its most promising directors&#146;  (ibid.). While Colin Chambers positively argued for Goodbody as the &#145;catalyst for change in the RSC&#146;, explaining that &#145;she provided the all-important bridge between the RSC and the fringe&#146;  (Chambers, 7), Margaret Sheehy cautioned that, for several years after her suicide, the &#145;pervasive, guilt-ridden, tribal memory&#146; of the event meant that the RSC hardly dared to risk more women directors for fear that they might &#145;crack under pressure&#146;  (Sheehy, 12). In her feminist classic <span class="italic">Dusa, Fish, Stas and Vi</span> (1976), Pam Gems remembered Goodbody through the role of Fish, the activist who commits suicide. An annual Buzz Goodbody award for directing is made at the national student drama festival, the forum that had so effectively launched Goodbody's RSC career in 1967.<br>
