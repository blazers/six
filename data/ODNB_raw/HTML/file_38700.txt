<span class="headword">Pilkington family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1825&#150;1925), <span class="occ">glass manufacturers</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_38700"></a><span class="headword">Richard Pilkington</span>  (1795&#150;1869)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_38701"></a><span class="headword">William Pilkington</span>  (1800&#150;1872)<span class="occ"></span>, the brothers who in their lifetime came to dominate British window glass manufacture. Their father, William (1765&#150;1831), came of upwardly mobile farming stock at Horwich near Bolton, 18 miles to the north-east of St Helens. In 1779, when William was fourteen, he was apprenticed to a physician in the hamlet of Hardshaw at the heart of a coalmining district to which glass making and other furnace industries had been attracted. He was then sent to St George's Hospital, London, for six months or more in 1785&#150;6, and finally had bought for him a partnership in his former master's practice. Like other physicians of his day, he kept an apothecary's shop which also sold wines and spirits.<h2>
<a name="Startofthebusiness"></a>Start of the business</h2>William Pilkington's sister, Elizabeth, came to keep house for him and in 1793 she married Joseph Rylands, a linen weaver in the neighbouring township of Parr who later opened a draper's shop in St Helens. Their third son, John, starting in the textile business in a small way locally, soon moved elsewhere in the county and, as the proprietor of the greatest textile manufacturing business in the kingdom, became Manchester's first multi-millionaire, still well remembered by the John Rylands Library which his third wife created in his memory.<br>
<br>Having lost his housekeeper, in 1794 Dr Pilkington married Ann Hatton (<i>d</i>. 1815). Of their thirteen children, the two older sons, Richard, born on 20 August 1795, and William, born on 14 May 1800, were destined to take over the wine and spirit business; both were apprenticed to Liverpool firms and joined their father in 1817 and 1820 respectively. The third son to survive childhood, Thomas, born on 24 November 1804, joined them later. In 1823, with dramatic cuts in the spirit duty and consequently great expansion of the business in prospect, William Pilkington &amp; Sons began to rectify and compound raw spirits themselves. In 1826, a year after the duty had been halved, the elder William, by then aged sixty-one and a successful businessman, retired to Windle Hall, set in large grounds on a healthy hillside to the north of St Helens, which he rented for &pound;300 a year. At his death in 1831 he left a small fortune of &pound;20,000.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in 1821, spirits had married beer. Dr Pilkington's second daughter, Eleanor, born on 11 May 1798, married Peter Greenall (1796&#150;1845). Although the Greenalls had been common brewers in St Helens from 1762, a later partnership in the brewery at Warrington had become more central to their affairs. Peter Greenall was sent in 1818 to manage their brewery at St Helens, where they had become the largest land and property owners. Making the most of the authority which this gave him, Greenall came to dominate local affairs and in 1841 became MP for one of the borough seats at nearby Wigan.<br>
<br>By the middle of the 1820s, increased economic activity had stimulated building in the neighbourhood and led to the creation of a new window glass factory, the St Helens Crown Glass Company, to which Greenall and the younger William Pilkington were each invited to subscribe a two-elevenths share, along with other local people and two glass making specialists. Each share in the St Helens Crown Glass Company, valued at only &pound;1000 at the end of 1827 after its first glass making cone had come into production, grew to over &pound;1600 to cover working costs. By then the glass making partners responsible for the management had become involved in a prolonged dispute with the excise commissioners, who were responsible for collecting the duty payable on glass, and had to sell their three shares. Greenall and William Pilkington acquired them and those of the other two local partners who also decided to withdraw. Greenall then owned three shares and Pilkington, on behalf of himself and his elder brother Richard, the remaining eight. William Pilkington, who had proved himself an effective entrepreneur at the wine and spirit business, especially on the selling side, took over the management. Fortunately that enterprise was doing very well at this critical juncture, bringing in about &pound;5000 a year clear profit.<br>
<br>Greenall and Pilkingtons, as the firm was often then called, had another stroke of good fortune: the other, older crown glassworks in the district ran into trouble with the excise commissioners over the payments of duty. This helped the struggling infant to survive the depression of the later 1820s and early 1830s. William Pilkington, a great believer in face-to-face relationships, travelled to Ireland and the main markets of Great Britain to establish new outlets for St Helens glass, keeping in touch with his elder brother, who remained at Windle Hall, and sending him a stream of instructions. They both lived for the business, though Richard, a devout Congregationalist, and William, who turned Anglican, were strong supporters of their churches and known for their private philanthropy.<br>
<br>Two more glasshouse cones were added when circumstances improved in the mid-1830s. When building again declined, later in the decade, the firm was fortunate that Greenall was a partner in Parr's Bank, Warrington, for the firm's overdraft there in 1838 reached &pound;17,000, a sum far larger than the bank could possibly have recouped at that time. The Pilkingtons took the opportunity to sell their wine and spirit business on the grounds that their brother Thomas, later to emerge as the black sheep of the family, was withdrawing from its management. &#145;If we could have given up the Glass Works&#146;, William Pilkington informed an enquirer in March 1836, &#145;we should, but from great outlay of Capital in building &hellip; we thought it better to give up one of them than verify the old adage of having too many irons in the fire&#146;  (Barker, 78). William Pilkington and his large family, no longer able to live at the shop, moved to more spacious quarters, first Millbrook House in Eccleston, in a salubrious neighbourhood to the west of St Helens, and later, in 1850, to Eccleston Hall itself.<br>
<br>William Pilkington had married in 1821 Charlotte Boyes; fourteen children were born between 1825 and 1849, twelve of whom survived infancy. Six of the survivors were boys. In 1838 the elder brother, Richard, then married Ann (<i>d</i>. 1883), a daughter of Richard Evans of Haydock near St Helens, one of Lancashire's most successful coal owners. Richard and Ann had six children, all boys. The Pilkington partners, therefore, found themselves confronted by the problem, not of finding two suitable sons each to succeed them, but of seeing the others settled in suitable jobs elsewhere. Of William Pilkington's younger sons, George (1840&#150;1923) and Leonard (1847&#150;1925) became chemical manufacturers at Widnes to the south of St Helens on the Mersey, and Harold (1844&#150;1879) was trained for the law and became town clerk of St Helens. William's second son, Richard (1830&#150;1894), a mechanical engineer, spent some time with the firm but then, for reasons unknown, took his skills to London. It was the eldest son, William (1827&#150;1903), better known (from subsequent residences) as Sutton Bill or Roby Bill to distinguish him from his cousin of the same name, and Thomas (1835&#150;1925), who rose from their lowly jobs at the works to become partners, in 1844 and 1853 respectively. Richard's eldest sons, <a name="cosubject_38702"></a><span class="headword">(William) Windle Pilkington</span>  (1839&#150;1914)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_38703"></a><span class="headword">Richard Pilkington</span>  (1841&#150;1908)<span class="occ"></span>, joined them in 1857 and 1858&#150;9. The others, Edward (1843&#150;1923), Alfred (1844&#150;1896), Charles (1850&#150;1918), and Lawrence (1855&#150;1941) joined their Evans uncles in the Clifton and Kearsley collieries near Manchester. Lawrence's daughter, Margaret (1891&#150;1974), trained at the Slade School of Fine Art and became a prominent patron of the arts in Manchester and honorary director of the Whitworth Art Gallery there from 1939 to 1959.<br>
<br>In the early 1840s, as the two families grew, Peter Greenall MP decided to withdraw from the partnership. By an agreement signed on 1 February 1842 his three shares were to be repaid in quarterly instalments of &pound;250 over the following seven years, thus valuing the business as a whole at about &pound;25,700. Before the seven years were up, however, he died from a stroke on 18 September 1845, while on a visit to William Pilkington at Millbrook House.<br>
<br>By then Pilkington Brothers had embarked upon the manufacture of glass by the sheet (pressed from split and flattened cylinders). This process enabled much larger panes to be made than by the existing crown (spun circular) process which the glass excise duty (levied by weight rather than by volume) favoured. When the duty was removed in 1845, followed by the abolition of the window tax in 1851, the three firms which already made sheet glass&#151;Pilkingtons at St Helens, Chances at Smethwick near Birmingham, and Hartleys, who had opened a factory in 1838 at Sunderland, co. Durham&#151;drove out of business the longer-established crown glass producers in the north-east, the traditional centre of British window-glass production. All three made the most of the rapidly growing market as prices fell, and Pilkingtons also cut costs and boosted its profits by mining its own coal and selling it to others. It also diversified into rolled plate glass. Between 1851 and 1854 Pilkingtons' output increased from 80 to 150 tons a week. It then had nine furnaces, which gave it parity with the older firm of Chances and 50 per cent more capacity than Hartleys. The removal of the duties on glass had, however, been accompanied by progressive cuts in import duties. When the latter were finally removed in 1857 imports into Britain, mainly from Belgium, negligible in 1850, grew rapidly and during the 1860s captured all the increased demand, British producers barely maintaining the levels of the 1850s.<h2>
<a name="Thesecondgeneration"></a>The second generation</h2>This was the daunting challenge which confronted the second generation when they joined their fathers on a newly formed board in 1862, and, three years later, took control of the business. The elder Richard Pilkington died at Windle Hall on 30 December 1869 and his brother William on 12 September 1872 at Downing Hall near Holywell, Flintshire, whence he had retired a few years before. Both left a respectable, if not vast, personal fortune.<br>
<br>Their sons brought new energy and enterprise to the business. As they grew up, they had gained a local reputation as young bloods, and their liveliness and willingness to take risks were not lost when they became responsible businessmen. Windle showed particular flair. During the later 1860s he kept watch on the development of tank furnaces. These produced molten glass continuously so that the glass-blowers could be kept at work round the clock, instead of intermittently as was inevitably the case with pots which had to be slowly recharged and reheated every time before blowing could begin. He spent several months abroad in 1872 so that he could monitor the Siemens Brothers' work on tanks at a Dresden glassworks, immediately took a licence to continue development at St Helens, and refused to be deterred when the other partners pleaded with him to stop experimenting on grounds of the continuing costs. When ultimately successful, he rapidly replaced pots with tank furnaces, secured a preferential rate of royalty from Siemens, and gained great advantage over the two British rivals. While all this was happening, Pilkingtons decided to build a completely new factory in another part of St Helens to manufacture the costlier cast plate glass. The market was then booming and Pilkingtons could finance the tanks and new works entirely from its profits. It also started to develop a flourishing export trade, particularly across the Atlantic. The business became larger and more profitable than ever in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, often seen by historians as an era of industrial difficulty. Pilkington Brothers became a private limited company in 1894 with a nominal capital of &pound;1.4 million, a figure which reflected its true value. This grew to &pound;2.6 million by 1903 and to &pound;4.2 million by 1914 when the last of the senior members of the second generation died.<br>
<br>Three of the four board members devoted much more attention to urban development than their fathers had done. Thomas, who did not, retired to Herefordshire in 1898 and, after the South African War, divided his time between Caithness and London (and later Bournemouth), lived to the ripe old age of ninety, and died in 1925. The other three were much more public-spirited. Thomas's brother, Roby Bill, was involved in the incorporation of St Helens in 1868. He was an active Anglican and the life and soul of the local conservative association. He probably transferred most of his wealth to his children before his death in 1903. Their cousin Windle was an equally devoted Congregationalist, as his father and grandfather had been before him. He supported the local ragged school and education development generally, the YMCA, the St Helens Hospital, and the District Nursing Association. He was a town councillor in 1870&#150;90, mayor in 1901&#150;2, and a freeman in 1905. He died on 15 March 1914 in Cannes, France. His younger brother Richard was also actively involved in local government (mayor 1881 and 1896&#150;8) and, like his brother, became a colonel in the volunteers. He was elected MP for Newton, Lancashire, at a by-election in 1899 and held the seat until 1906. He died in 1908. Three of the four members of the second generation sent two sons into the business [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31550/', "Pilkington, William Henry")</script>], Thomas only one. Unlike their fathers, they had been educated at Eton, Harrow, Clifton, or Shrewsbury. Most had gone on to Oxford or Cambridge.<br>
<br>The elder Pilkingtons, Richard and William, who helped to found the business and then guided it through unforeseen danger of collapse to pre-eminence, had the initial benefit of considerable financial support and an adequate business apprenticeship. Returns from the firm which they struggled so hard to build up over four decades gave their many children a good start in the world. The four sons who took over from them proved worthy successors and made St Helens the centre of window and plate glass manufacture in the kingdom. Pilkington became the leading name in the locality, though it was as yet little known elsewhere in the country.<br>
