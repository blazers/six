<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Black, Sir  Cyril Wilson</span>  (1902&#150;1991), <span class="occ">property developer and politician</span>, was born on 8 April 1902 at 11 Langham Mansions, Kensington, London, one of four sons (three surviving) and two daughters of Robert Wilson Black (1871&#150;1951), property developer, of 11 Langham Mansions, and his wife, Annie Louise (<i>b</i>. 1880), elder daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Jonathan North, mayor of Leicester in 1914&#150;18, of Glebe Mount, Oadby, Leicester. Both parents were devout Baptists. His father was both assiduous and astute in building up a family fortune, which amounted to more than &pound;2 million at his death.<br>
<br>Black's upbringing was austere; it would, indeed, be reasonable to call it severe. The house was teetotal, and nicotine was prohibited. Regular church attendance was mandatory. Striving for riches and success, however, was encouraged. Robert Black was not disposed to bestow on his son any financial advantages accruing from his own wealth. The one major monetary outlay he was prepared to make was on the boy's education, and it can reasonably be supposed that he was pleased when, eventually, Black followed him into the business of property development, having trained as a chartered surveyor. He must have been even more pleased when, before he was forty, his son had made himself a millionaire through his own unstinting efforts. Many youngsters might have rebelled against the strictness of this upbringing, but Black revelled in it and, to the end of his days, held fast to its principles. During the twenty years in which he served in the House of Commons&#151;from 1950 to 1970&#151;even his most virulent enemies (and he had many) could find no chink in his moral armour.<br>
<br>Black was educated at King's College School, and went on to train at the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. He quickly&#151;in his twenties&#151;began to put his technical training to effective commercial use, and when he married (Dorothy) Joyce (<i>b</i>. 1908/9), daughter of Thomas Birkett, boot manufacturer, of Wigston Hall, Leicester, on 6 March 1930, he was a coming man in the property world. However, he was driven by much more than financial ambition. From his youth he threw himself into public work (which he listed as a recreation rather than as a vocation). He saw political activity as the best means of achieving moral ends. He began with local politics, and became a member of Wimbledon borough council in 1942, and was its mayor from 1945 to 1946 and 1946 to 1947. He became member of Surrey county council in 1943, was elected chairman from 1956 to 1959, and served until 1965. In that year he also became a member of Merton borough council, and was mayor of Merton from 1965 to 1966. His energy was titanic, and a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of his political career only hints at its strength. At one time he was a director of more than fifty companies, but still found time to give efficient devotion to his favourite causes: the advocacy of temperance, the censorship of what he considered pornography, and the development of a morally uplifting educational system.<br>
<br>When Black entered the House of Commons in 1950, as Conservative MP for Wimbledon, allies and opponents alike found him completely immoveable on his chosen subjects. He was already prominent in the temperance movement and chairman of the Temperance Permanent Building Society. He had acquired a chain of alcohol-free hotels through a family company; when, in 1981, the directors decided to apply for a drinks licence, he resigned, and sold his shares. He was also, at various times, involved in the Boys' Brigade and the Girls' Brigade, a governor of a number of schools (including his own), a member of the South-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board, and an enthusiastic lay preacher.<br>
<br>In the House of Commons, however, Black met with virtually no success. He campaigned against the liberalization of divorce law, and the relaxation of licensing laws, and failed. He fought for the return of the birch as an instrument of criminal punishment, and for stricter control of immigration, but this latter subject had already been taken up by more formidable politicians. He was, however&#151;paradoxical though it seemed to his critics&#151;a keen supporter of the United Nations Association, and a governor of a Roman Catholic Ursuline convent in his constituency. There were, then, limits to his intolerance, and he was a man who strove mightily to do good. Nevertheless, he was not an easy man to like. His successful prosecution for libel of the <span class="italic">Socialist Leader</span>, for calling him a racist, and his unsuccessful attacks on the publication of <span class="italic">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span> and <span class="italic">Last Exit to Brooklyn</span>, set him firmly against the tide of his times. In private he could be a reasonable, if over-earnest, conversationalist. But, as he went about his multifarious activities, with a permanent half-sneer on his face, and as he thundered in public against what he called decadence, he was a voice calling in the lonely wilderness. The sole consolation he received, outside his own circles, was the knighthood bestowed upon him on Harold Macmillan's recommendation in 1959. He retired as MP for Wimbledon in 1970, although he remained active in various causes thereafter. He died in Cheam, Surrey, on 29 October 1991; he was survived by his wife, two daughters, and a son.<br>
