<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  Katherine</span>, countess of Desmond <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Old Countess of Desmond]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1604), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was the daughter of Sir John Fitzgerald, second lord of Decies (<i>d</i>. 1524), and Ellen, daughter of John FitzGibbon, the white knight. After 1505 she married, as his second wife, Thomas fitz Thomas Fitzgerald, who in 1529 became eleventh earl of Desmond, their union producing one daughter, Katherine. Her husband died in 1534, and thereafter she did not remarry, apparently residing for the rest of her life at Inchiquin Castle, co. Cork. In August 1575 she granted the castle and lands to Gerald fitz James Fitzgerald, fourteenth earl of Desmond, but it would appear that she retained possession of the property as thirteen years later Sir Walter Ralegh held Inchiquin of her. Katherine died in 1604, but interest in her did not&#151;due to the writings of two eminent men of letters of the Elizabethan and Stuart periods, the aforementioned Ralegh and Fynes Moryson, who both held her up as an example of remarkable longevity.<br>
<br>Ralegh, who had known the &#145;Old Countess&#146; during his time as an undertaker in the Munster plantation in the late 1580s, wrote in his <span class="italic">History of the World</span>, published in 1614, that she had been married during the reign of Edward IV. If she had married in 1483, the year of Edward's death, Katherine would have been 140 years old at the time of her death, assuming she was approximately twenty years old when she married. The truth is more prosaic. Her husband's first wife, Sheila or Gilis, daughter of Cormac Laidhir McTeige MacCarthy, lord of Muskerry, was alive in 1505, so Katherine could not have been married during Edward IV's reign. Ralegh's information was therefore at least partially flawed. Three years after Ralegh's account of her, Fynes Moryson claimed in his <span class="italic">Itinerary</span> that the countess had died aged about 140. This would appear to support Ralegh's assertions, but again the evidence calls this statement into question. If Moryson's age for her is correct, Katherine would have been approximately forty-one years old in 1505, the earliest date she could have married. Thomas fitz Thomas presumably hoped for children, and it seems doubtful that he would have married a woman already in her forties. It would therefore appear that Moryson's treatment of her is similarly defective.<br>
<br>That said, Katherine was indeed old when she died. If her daughter had been born in 1534, the year of her husband's death, and presuming she was perhaps eighteen or twenty when she gave birth, then she would have been born about 1514, making her aged about ninety at the time of her death in 1604. Later writers added further embellishments to the story of this legendary lady, including one anecdote which claimed that she had danced with Richard, duke of Gloucester, the future Richard III. Her death was variously described as being due to injuries received after a fall from a tree while collecting apples, nuts, or cherries. Others confused her with Eleanor, widow of Gerald, fourteenth earl of Desmond, who went to London on a number of occasions during the latter half of Elizabeth's reign and the early part of the reign of James I. Katherine thus achieved posthumous fame for a longevity which Ralegh, Moryson, and others appear to have overstated; but given that she was at least ninety years old when she died, together with the fact that she had been a widow for seventy years, she none the less still merits the sobriquet &#145;the Old Countess of Desmond&#146;.<br>
