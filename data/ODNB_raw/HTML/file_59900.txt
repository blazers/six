<span class="headword">Hastings,  Henry Weysford Charles Plantagenet  Rawdon</span>, fourth marquess of Hastings  (1842&#150;1868), <span class="occ">rake</span>, was born on 22 July 1842, at 6 Cavendish Square, Marylebone, Middlesex, second son of George Augustus Francis Rawdon Hastings, second marquess of Hastings (1808&#150;1844), and his wife, Barbara Yelverton, <i>suo jure</i> Baroness Grey of Ruthin (1810&#150;1858) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56505/', "Hastings, Barbara Rawdon, marchioness of Hastings")</script>], only child of Henry Edward Yelverton, the nineteenth Baron Grey of Ruthin, who had initiated his country neighbour the poet Byron in homosexuality. In 1851 Hastings succeeded his brother in the marquessate, three earldoms, a viscountcy, and nine baronies; he inherited his mother's barony in 1858. Together with the dukes of Abercorn, the marquesses of Lansdowne, and the earls of Verulam, the marquesses of Hastings were the only peers who enjoyed distinct peerages in the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland. He was educated at Eton College (1854&#150;5) and at Christ Church, Oxford (1860&#150;61), but left both institutions abruptly for unknown reasons.<br>
<br>Having already owned racehorses under the alias of Mr Weysford, Hastings was elected as a member of the Jockey Club on his twenty-first birthday. He was not wildly extravagant at horse sales&#151;his two best runners, the Duke and the Earl, cost him 500 and 450 guineas respectively&#151;but his craving for the odds became excessive. This feeble, runtish, orphaned <i>enfant g&acirc;t&eacute;</i> revelled in the deference of the betting ring and the admiration which accompanied his huge wagers. Initially his betting coups were so brilliant that he believed in his power to break the ring. Although for Hastings the excitement of gambling was more intense and enduring than sex, he attracted Lady Florence Cecilia Paget (1842&#150;1907), youngest daughter of the second marquess of Anglesey. On 16 July 1864, shortly before her intended marriage to a rich squire, Henry Chaplin, afterwards first Viscount Chaplin, she went to Marshall and Snelgrove's drapery store in Oxford Street, entering by one door and swiftly leaving by another for the nearby church of St George, Hanover Square. There she married Hastings. This elopement raised a great stir in society. The marriage proved anxious, discontented, and childless.<br>
<br>In 1866 Hastings became master of the Quorn hounds, but never cared much for hunting and knew little about the sport. Dissolute living was ruining his judgement and health: mackerel poached in gin, with caviare on devilled toast, washed down by claret cup was his favourite breakfast; an eternal cigarette in his mouth maintained his famous pose of nonchalance. He lost heavily at Crockford's gaming club as well as on the turf. His estate at Donington, Leicestershire, was neglected; he sold Scottish land to the third marquess of Bute for &pound;300,000. By the winter of 1867&#150;8 he had gravely damaged his kidneys. It is difficult to say whether, knowing that he was doomed by illness, he became wilder in his betting, or whether his losses drove him deeper into desperate, self-destructive courses. Despite the magnanimity of Chaplin after the theft of his fianc&eacute;e, Hastings developed a spiteful and immature obsession against him. This came to focus on his rival's colt Hermit, and he lost &pound;120,000 in wagers against the horse when it won the Derby by a neck at 66 to 1 (22 May 1867). Much of that money was lost to Hermit's owner. &#145;Every one will be glad that [Chaplin] has this sweet revenge for Lord H.'s shabby conduct about Lady F. P.&#146;, noted John Wodehouse, afterwards first earl of Kimberley  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, 203). Rather than retrench after this fiasco, Hastings persisted in a reckless gambling campaign which only more tightly ensnared him in the moneylenders' traps. &#145;For the sake of the peerage wh. he disgraces the sooner he disappears from public view, the better&#146;, Wodehouse wrote in May 1868 of &#145;that miserable man Lord Hastings&#146;  (ibid., 220).<br>
<br>Hounded by creditors, Hastings resigned from the Jockey Club, and broken in fortune, nerves, and health succumbed to Bright's disease on 10 November 1868, at 34 Grosvenor Square, Mayfair. Reportedly his last words were, &#145;Hermit's Derby broke my heart; but I did not show it, did I?&#146;  (Blyth, 266). On 14 November he was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. E. H. Stanley, afterwards fifteenth earl of Derby, noted in his diary on 16 November:<blockquote>Much writing in the papers about the death of Lord Hastings, aged 26: in five years he had destroyed a fine fortune, ruined his health, and by associating with low characters, on the turf and elsewhere, considerably damaged his reputation. To the peerage his death is a clear gain: and as his titles (except a Scotch earldom) die with him, the ruin of his family matters less. His sister has saved the family place.</blockquote>
