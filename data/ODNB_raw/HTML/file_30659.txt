<span class="headword">Brown,  William  Beattie</span>  (1831&#150;1909), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born in the parish of Haddington, near Edinburgh, on 9 November 1831, the son of Adam Brown, farmer, and his wife, Ann Beattie. When he was still young the family moved to Leith, then a separate burgh outside Edinburgh, and he was educated at Leith high school. He was then apprenticed as a glass-stainer to the firm of Messrs James Ballantine &amp; Son in Edinburgh. Very soon he showed considerable artistic talent and before his apprenticeship was completed he was accepted as a student at the Trustees' Academy in Edinburgh under the directorship of Robert Scott Lauder. His skill and accuracy as a draughtsman led to his employment as an illustrator for medical works. Early in his career he was also employed as a picture restorer by Henry Doig, an Edinburgh art dealer, carver, and gilder. On 23 December 1858 he married his employer's daughter, Esther Love Doig (<i>c</i>.1838&#150;1904); they had three sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>Beattie Brown first exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1852 and from then on became a regular and prolific exhibitor for the rest of his life. He also exhibited at the Royal Academy in London periodically from 1863 to 1899. In 1871 he was elected an associate of the Royal Scottish Academy and in 1884 a full academician. He specialized in landscape painting, in the early years particularly of the Edinburgh area, the lowlands, and the Scottish borders. Gradually he was increasingly drawn to the attractions of the wilder parts of Scotland further north, and it is by these works that he is best remembered. For example, his diploma work in the Royal Scottish Academy, <span class="italic">Coire-na-Faireamh</span> (1883), set in Applecross deer forest in Ross-shire, is a dramatic representation of one of the steepest passes in the north-west highlands. Painted remarkably freely in dark, heavy colours, and with strong contrasts of the highlights of light on water, it evokes very forcefully the idea of a remote and deserted wilderness. The directness of such paintings is a result of his fondness for working <i>en plein air</i>, a practice for which he was an early enthusiast. These works, often characterized by an overall brown tone, brought him much popularity in his lifetime.<br>
<br>Like many others of his contemporaries from the east of Scotland, Beattie Brown also studied in the Low Countries, working particularly in watercolour when away from home. In the late 1880s and early 1890s he exhibited a number of quieter landscapes of the scenery around Dordrecht in the Netherlands and further south in Belgium. He also produced a certain amount of work in the English home counties and Yorkshire. Towards the end of his life his colours became lighter and brighter, reflecting the influence of higher-keyed paintings by, for example, the Glasgow Boys and other younger artists. William Beattie Brown died at his home at 15 St Bernard's Crescent, Edinburgh, on 31 March 1909 and was buried in Warriston cemetery in that city on 3 April.<br>
