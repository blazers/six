<span class="headword">Bohun,  Jocelin  de</span>  (1105<span class="mult">x</span>1110?&#150;1184), <span class="occ">bishop of Salisbury</span>, was born into the Sussex branch of the Bohun family, probably between about 1105 and 1110. His uncle (<i>patruus</i>) was Engelger de Bohun (<i>d</i>. 1175), and he was a close relative, perhaps first cousin once removed, of Savaric Fitzgeldewin, bishop of Bath (<i>d</i>. 1205). He was somehow related to the earls of Gloucester, Earl William (<i>d</i>. 1183) calling him his kinsman (<i>cognatus</i>). His brother, Richard, became bishop of Coutances, and his illegitimate son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9613/', "Reginald fitz Jocelin (d. 1191)")</script>, was successively bishop of Bath and archbishop-elect of Canterbury. Bohun's early life and education are obscure, but, since Pope Alexander III (<i>r</i>. 1159&#150;81) later claimed him as an old friend, and his son was known as the Lombard, it is likely that he studied in north Italy, where his son was born, possibly of a Lombard mother. The first certain context for him is the household of Henry de Blois, bishop of Winchester (<i>d</i>. 1171), who appointed him archdeacon of Winchester before 1139. His election as bishop of Salisbury in 1141 or 1142 was the unforeseen outcome of a dispute over the filling of the see between King Stephen and Henry de Blois, who was by then papal legate. After the preferred candidates of both sides had been mutually rejected, and following Stephen's capture in February 1141, Henry supported Bohun's nomination, although his election by the chapter was not unanimous, being opposed particularly by Dean Azo. He was consecrated by Archbishop Theobald (<i>d</i>. 1161) in 1142. He attended Henry II's coronation at Westminster on 19 December 1154, and assisted at Archbishop Thomas Becket's consecration at Canterbury on 3 June 1162.<br>
<br>Bohun played a significant part in the ensuing conflict between Becket and the king, but one dictated more by circumstance than by conviction or principle. When the quarrel began he was out of favour with Henry, possibly owing to differences between them over his reluctant quitclaim of Devizes Castle in 1157, and moreover he had recently followed the archbishop's advice on the treatment of criminous clerks. At the Council of Clarendon in January 1164 it was partly Henry's enmity towards Bohun and William Turbe, bishop of Norwich (<i>d</i>. 1174), that induced Becket reluctantly to accept Henry's demands. When Becket and the bishops eventually swore to observe the realm's ancient customs, Bohun hesitated and sought guidance from the archbishop, who told him to swear with the others. During Becket's trial at Northampton in October 1164 Bohun was one of two bishops who attempted to console him, while also joining other bishops later in advising him to resign.<br>
<br>Bohun was turned into an enemy of Becket by an episode subsidiary to the main dispute. In May 1165 John of Oxford (<i>d</i>. 1200) was one of the king's emissaries in discussions with the antipope Paschal III's party at the imperial diet of W&uuml;rzburg. As a reward Henry put pressure on Bohun to have John elected to the vacant deanery of Salisbury. Bohun, mindful no doubt of his recent troubles with the king, and despite prohibitions from Alexander III and Becket, complied. He was accordingly suspended by the archbishop in 1166. He appealed against his sentence to the pope and wrote to Becket justifying his action, asserting that the new dean had been canonically elected by a unanimous chapter. Nevertheless, although John of Salisbury and others interceded on Bohun's behalf, Becket insisted on the quashing of John of Oxford's appointment before the suspension could be lifted. This Bohun would not accept. He was driven to seek support from Gilbert Foliot, bishop of London (<i>d</i>. 1187), one of Becket's bitterest opponents, with whom he was closely associated thereafter, becoming increasingly identified with the king's party. In November 1167 he was among the bishops who met the papal legates at Argentan, where he joined Foliot in appealing to the pope on behalf of the English bishops against Becket. In 1168 Alexander III conditionally lifted Bohun's suspension but, after Foliot's fresh appeal to Rome in 1169, both bishops were excommunicated by Becket on Palm Sunday. They were absolved by the pope early in 1170 but, after assisting Archbishop Roger of York at the coronation of Henry the Young King at Westminster on 14 June 1170, their excommunication and suspension were renewed in September by papal letters dispatched to Becket for use at his discretion. From Wissant, Becket sent the letters across the channel to the three prelates waiting at Dover to cross to the king in Normandy. It was their bitter complaints to Henry that set in train the events that culminated in the archbishop's assassination on 29 December. In the aftermath of the murder the pope, evidently anxious not to prolong Bohun's and Foliot's excommunication, conditionally absolved them in April 1171, but their suspension was maintained until March 1172.<br>
<br>Bohun was probably more at home in the administration of his diocese than in the great quarrel which engulfed him. He ruled for forty-two years, the longest pontificate of any twelfth-century English bishop. His surviving charters (numbering over 100) reveal him as a conscientious diocesan. He exerted his authority within the diocese, being active in the appointment of parochial clergy and in settling disputes over churches and tithes. Despite problems at Cerne and Sherborne abbeys in the 1140s and clashes with Malmesbury over its claim to exemption, he appears on the whole to have maintained amicable relations with religious houses, issuing general confirmations to a number of individual monasteries and helping to promote the cult of St James's hand at Reading. At the cathedral of Old Sarum he consolidated and enlarged the prebendal system, developed the full complement of dignities, and built up the common fund. He was occasionally employed as a papal judge-delegate in the first half of his pontificate, most notably in the important settlement of 1157 between York Minster and Gloucester Abbey over certain Gloucestershire manors. Despite the doubts voiced by David Knowles about Bohun's legal learning, Archbishop Theobald clearly felt his opinion worth having; he was, for example, one of the bishops whose advice Theobald followed in handling the difficult case of Osbert the archdeacon in 1155. His son Reginald became archdeacon of Wiltshire and his kinsman Savaric treasurer of the cathedral, but Bohun did not otherwise promote his family at Salisbury. He attended Archbishop Richard's provincial council at Westminster in May 1175, and a royal council at Woodstock in July. In 1184 he resigned his bishopric to become a monk at the Cistercian abbey of Forde, where he died on 18 November. He was buried at Old Sarum, whence his remains were moved on 14 June 1226 to the new cathedral at Salisbury.<br>
