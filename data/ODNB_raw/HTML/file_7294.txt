</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Davis,  Thomas Osborne</span>  (1814&#150;1845), <span class="occ">politician and journalist</span>, was born at Mallow, co. Cork, on 24 October 1814, not on 16 October as has sometimes been asserted. His father, James Thomas Davis, held a commission in the British army, and as a surgeon in the Royal Artillery was for many years stationed in Dublin. Appointed head of the British ordnance medical department in Portugal, he was on his way there when he died at Exeter, Devon, in September 1814, a month before Thomas, his sixth child, was born. Of these children only four lived to adulthood: the three brothers John, James, and Thomas, and their sister Charlotte. Dr Davis's family was of Welsh origin, long settled in England. Davis's mother, Mary Atkins, traced her ancestry to a Cromwellian settler whose descendants, though occasionally intermarrying with Irish families, continued protestants in the English interest. On a fragment of his remaining papers Davis had written that he was brought up a high tory and episcopalian protestant. In his maternal ancestry there was a great-grandmother who belonged to the Gaelic O'Sullivan Beare family of co. Cork. Davis's eldest brother, John Nicholas Atkins Davis, like his father a medical doctor, was also a famous genealogist, known in Dublin as &#145;pedigree Davis&#146;. Of him Davis once wrote that &#145;there is no family in Munster but he knows the pedigree of&#146;  (Duffy, <span class="italic">Davis</span>, 174). Davis's mature ambition to bring Irishmen of whatever origin to work for their common country may well be traced to this knowledge of his own mixed ancestry.<br>
<br>When Davis was four his mother moved her family to Dublin, settling first at Warrington Place and later at 61 (now 67) Lower Baggot Street, where Davis lived his brief life, and where he died in 1845. Some of his early education was at a school on Lower Mount Street kept by a Mr Mongan, from which he entered Trinity College in 1831. There is little evidence of Davis's early years except that he was dreamy, self-absorbed, and quickly emotional. Of his knowledge of Ireland during his youth little is known, except that he spent holidays in co. Tipperary, where an aunt was the wife of the Anglican rector in Templederry. At Trinity he was known as a steady plodding student, reading on a wide variety of subjects&#151;history, law, political philosophy&#151;and works of travel. In his own eyes he was filling the gaps he found in the Trinity curriculum. After graduation in 1836, Davis went to London to keep his terms as a law student, and was called to the bar in 1838. He did not practise. In 1837 he had privately printed a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Reform of the Lords</span>, arguing for an elected upper house, though leaving it with an absolute power of rejecting bills.<br>
<br>A succession of authors commenting on the origins of Davis's nationalism have suggested that it was the result of a journey before 1840 to Germany, where he was influenced by the writings of Lessing, Herder, Fichte, and the Schlegels. No solid evidence of any continental or German visit exists, but rather more telling is the statement in Duffy's biography that Davis had never travelled. A manuscript in Davis's own hand states that his ideas of national independence and national policy had been formed in the historical societies of Trinity College, Dublin, and came from Trinity College protestants and a few Roman Catholics. Moreover, there was Davis's own early admiration for Daniel O'Connell. In the debates in the Trinity College Historical Society Davis played a prominent part and as president in 1840 delivered an address on &#145;The utility of debating societies in remedying the defects of a university education&#146;. This address ranged widely over many subjects, and its famous sentence &#145;Gentlemen, you have a country&#146; has been seen as Davis's public d&eacute;but as an Irish nationalist. It was also an appeal for reform, for the improvement of education at all levels, and for the responsibilities of the educated classes in an age of growing democracy. It indicates the influence on Davis's thinking of Alexis De Tocqueville's <span class="italic">Democracy in America</span> (1835).<br>
<br>In 1841, with his Trinity friend John Blake Dillon, Davis joined O'Connell's recently formed Loyal National Repeal Association. Journalism rather than law attracted him and between 1839 and 1843 he wrote articles for <span class="italic">The Citizen</span>, a monthly journal later called the <span class="italic">Dublin Monthly Magazine</span>, founded by members of the Trinity College Historical Society. These articles&#151;on Grattan's parliament, on India, on Afghanistan, on the Irish parliament of 1689 and on peasant proprietorship&#151;suggested Davis's promise as journalist, politician, and historian. In the spring of 1841 both Davis and Dillon wrote for the Dublin <span class="italic">Morning Register</span>, an engagement which ended after six months. An acquaintance with Charles Gavan Duffy, the successful editor of the <span class="italic">Belfast Vindicator</span>, led to discussions on Irish journalism and in 1842 a decision on the part of all three to found a weekly journal to be called <span class="italic">The Nation</span>. Its first issue appeared on 15 October 1842. The prospectus, written except for one sentence by Davis, had renewal as its theme: emancipation from old and tired issues and the direction of the popular mind and the sympathies of educated men to nationality and the blessings of domestic legislation. The journal endeavoured to bring all Irishmen of whatever origin to patriotic action for their common country. <span class="italic">The Nation</span> was at once successful, its circulation soon far higher than that of any other Dublin paper. Although Duffy was an outstanding editor, <span class="italic">The Nation</span> was very much Davis's paper in its intellectual qualities, and in the number of essays, editorials, book reviews, and smaller pieces written by him. During the first year, Davis had written about 210 essays and editorials; and between 1842 and 1845 he published about eighty poems. Duffy was the second most frequent contributor, and sometimes he and Davis wrote most of the paper. For his work Davis received &pound;500 a year&#151;a considerable sum for those days.<br>
<br>At Duffy's urging Davis tried his hand at poetry, and his first effort, &#145;Lament for the Death of Owen Roe O'Neill&#146;, was followed by other poems recalling famous incidents, military engagements, tragedies, and disasters in Irish history. There were songs and love poems as well. His ballad &#145;A Nation Once Again&#146;, first published in <span class="italic">The Nation</span> on 13 July 1844, became widely adopted as an unofficial national anthem. Critics of Davis have noted the disparity between <span class="italic">The Nation's</span> editorial advocacy of non-violence, following O'Connell, and the martial and military cast of so much of Davis's poetry; but the poems were meant to give Irishmen the history they would never hear in the national schools, and to arouse pride in their country's past. <span class="italic">The Nation</span> was very much a part of the heated atmosphere surrounding O'Connell's mass meetings for repeal during the spring and summer of 1843. After Peel proscribed O'Connell's planned monster meeting at Clontarf in October 1843, followed in 1844 by O'Connell's trial for conspiracy and by his brief imprisonment, <span class="italic">The Nation</span> entered a new phase, keeping up enthusiasm for a now distant repeal of the union.<br>
<br>During 1844, while O'Connell and Duffy were imprisoned, Davis, acting with William Smith O'Brien, who had become a repealer, prepared reports on various governmental issues, and assumed heavy responsibilities for <span class="italic">The Nation</span>. In the newspaper he urged the election to parliament of men of character and ability who would stand together for Irish reform. He was also editing the speeches of John Philpot Curran which were published in 1845. His biography of Wolfe Tone was to remain unfinished, indeed hardly begun, at his death. Working in the general committee of the Repeal Association, Davis rarely spoke in public. In May 1845, however, he encouraged the association to welcome Peel's bill for Irish higher education, and to rejoice in the three projected colleges where Catholic and protestant students would be educated together. Despite his endorsement of amendments which would protect the faith and morals of students, Davis was harshly attacked by O'Connell for his stand for secular education. The quarrel was made up, though opinions did not change.<br>
<br>By 1845 Duffy, Davis, and Dillon had become the centre of a group of young men who contributed to <span class="italic">The Nation</span> and who talked and planned together. A journalist called them Young Ireland, and the name remained. Their history would be written in the 1880s by Gavan Duffy. Close to <span class="italic">The Nation</span>'s founders were John Pigot, John O'Hagan, and Denny Lane of Cork. But Duffy, in his historical works, left no doubt that Davis was their true leader. His wide knowledge, his frank, unpretentious manner, his good nature and fairness attracted friends who would remember him with affection. Writing in 1890, John O'Hagan recalled in him &#145;a grace of nature and manner which never failed to attract&#146;. Among Dublin's intellectual circles there were many, notably Samuel Ferguson, who disagreed with Davis's nationalist politics but remained his friends.<br>
<br>In the late summer of 1845 Davis became engaged to marry Annie Hutton, whom he had first met in 1843. In early September he became ill with what he described in a note to Duffy as &#145;some sort of cholera, and perhaps a slight scarlatina&#146;. Dr Stokes was in attendance. A few days later Davis wrote of &#145;a horrid sore throat&#146;. Improvement was followed by a relapse and on 16 September Davis died at his home in Lower Baggot Street. He was buried in Mount Jerome cemetery. A public funeral attended by those prominent in Dublin's political and cultural life attested to the regard which he had won from all shades of opinion. Commemorative articles in <span class="italic">The Nation</span>, where his poems had appeared under the name The Celt, revealed his life and identity to a wider public. In 1846 Gavan Duffy edited Davis's prose articles, and in the same year Thomas Wallis published a collection of his poems. Both volumes went through many editions. A statue by the sculptor John Hogan now stands in the foyer of the Dublin city hall across from that of O'Connell.<br>
<br>Davis was politically moderate, even though unwavering in his ultimate goals. He wanted true independence for Ireland, but was at one point prepared to accept as a step on the way a subordinate parliament. Probably his goal was the responsible representative government which Canada in the 1840s was attaining and which Duffy was to endorse in 1848. Peasant proprietorship on the land must come, but not by violent means. The fervour with which he wrote sometimes concealed his moderation. His hostility to England and to the landlords was a bitter legacy, but in the case of the landlords he could also see their problems. Much of Davis's patriotism was non-political. Preservation and improvement are themes which thread their way through his <span class="italic">Nation</span> essays. There must be no road through New Grange; old buildings and older ruins must be saved; Irish music and the Irish language should be cherished. The Irish language, a precious cultural inheritance, was necessary for writing the early history of the country, and for understanding its nomenclature and place names as well as its soul and spirit. He advocated education at every level and set great store by repeal reading-rooms, public lectures, and provision for healthful amusements. Often cited as opposed to modernization, he urged industrial education, hoping that in Ireland, should industrialization come, its worst effects might be avoided.<br>
<br>If Davis has affinities with English Victorian reformers, in Ireland he also belongs, outside political nationalism, in a line of descent going back to the Royal Dublin Society (1731) and to the Royal Irish Academy (1785), and forward to the work of George Russell and Horace Plunkett. His own deepest ambition was to write a history of Ireland, and at one time he sought a leave of absence from <span class="italic">The Nation</span> to begin it. He was much attracted to the romantic historical writing of Augustin Thierry. His <span class="italic">Citizen</span> essays on the 1689 parliament of James II won high praise from the historian Lecky, but were republished only in 1893 (as <span class="italic">The Patriot Parliament</span>). In all the cultural, artistic, and historical activities of Dublin in the 1840s Davis was deeply involved, and in January 1845 he became a member of the Royal Irish Academy. His untimely death caused much speculation, both then and since, on what his life might have become. The dedicated patriotism of Davis's life made him ever afterwards an example and an inspiration to Irishmen of widely different political views.<br>
