<span class="headword">Jones,  William Ronald Rees</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Keidrych Rhys]</span>  (1915&#150;1987), <span class="occ">journalist and poetry editor</span>, was born at Blaensawdde, near Llanddeusant, Carmarthenshire, on 26 December 1915, the only son of Morgan Jones, a tenant farmer, and his wife, Margaretta, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Evans. The name by which he was known in literary and journalistic circles was taken from a small river, the Ceidrych, which ran near his home; for a while in the 1960s he used this spelling. Educated at Llandovery grammar school, he found his first job in a local bank, but after an incident involving a shot-gun was dismissed, and shortly afterwards, at the age of twenty, left Wales for London to seek a career in journalism; he worked as a public relations consultant to various animal welfare charities.<br>
<br>Rhys launched the magazine <span class="italic">Wales</span> in 1937 as &#145;an independent pamphlet of creative work by the younger progressive Welsh writers&#146;, taking as his motto, &#145;Though we write in English, we are rooted in Wales.&#146; The first series (1937&#150;40) ceased publication during the war but the second, started three years later, ran for eighteen numbers and was edited from Rhys's home at Llan-y-bri and then from the famously cluttered office of the Druid Press in Lammas Street in Carmarthen.<br>
<br>In October 1939 Rhys married, in a secret ceremony and against his parents' wishes, Evelyn Beatrice Roberts (1909&#150;1995), known as Lynette, a poet whose Welsh parents had emigrated to Argentina from Australia; the best man was Dylan Thomas, who once referred to him as &#145;the best sort of crank&#146;. They lived first at Penybont, a farm near Llangadog where his parents lived, and then rented a whitewashed cottage known as T&#375; Gwyn at Llan-y-bri on the Tywi estuary. The marriage was put under strain by Rhys's prolonged absences from home while serving with the 53rd London Welsh regiment and then the Royal Artillery, during which time his wife suffered a miscarriage; for refusing to serve overseas while she was unwell, he was held in Woolwich arsenal for a few weeks. After his own health broke down, he worked with the Ministry of Information but saw the war out as a correspondent in France, the Netherlands, and Germany.<br>
<br>Rhys published only a small booklet of his own poems, <span class="italic">The Van Pool</span> (1942), in which he wrote mainly about the farming community of his youth and separation from his wife during war service. He also edited three anthologies of verse: <span class="italic">Poems from the Forces</span> (1941), <span class="italic">More Poems from the Forces</span> (1943), and <span class="italic">Modern Welsh Poetry</span> (1944), of which the last-named was the most influential. Among its thirty-seven contributors were Dylan Thomas, Alun Lewis, Glyn Jones, Idris Davies, Vernon Watkins, Emyr Humphreys, and R. S. Thomas. Quixotically, Rhys stood as the Independent Progressive candidate in the Carmarthen county elections of March 1946. His marriage ended in divorce in 1948; the couple had a son and a daughter. He resumed his career as a journalist, notably as a Welsh columnist with <span class="italic">The People</span> from 1954 to 1960. In 1954 he was married again, this time to Eva Smith, with whom he had a son. From 1956 until 1960 he served as London editor of Tambimuttu's intermittent magazine <span class="italic">Poetry London&#150;New York</span>. The third and final series of <span class="italic">Wales</span> (1958&#150;60), published as a monthly from London, was less literary than the early numbers, though it continued to carry poems and stories by some of the best Welsh writers of the day such as Rhys Davies.<br>
<br>Keidrych Rhys, an indefatigable impresario on behalf of Welsh writers, was a generous and gifted editor who was often short of money and could not always pay his printer's bills or his contributors. His was an ebullient personality which delighted in anecdote and controversy, and he was an inveterate purveyor of scandal, especially about members of the Welsh establishment, among whom his paranoia detected many a plot against him. A fluent Welsh speaker, he was a lifelong supporter of Plaid Cymru, for which he arranged publicity in London. In his later years, he dealt in antiquarian books. Rhys died at his home, 40 Heath Street, Hampstead, London, on 22 May 1987.<br>
