<span class="headword">Coote,  Holmes</span>  (1817&#150;1872), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born in London on 10 November 1817, the second son of Richard Holmes Coote, a barrister of the court of chancery. He was educated at Westminster School, and at the age of sixteen was apprenticed to Sir William Lawrence, surgeon to St Bartholomew's Hospital. In 1845 Coote won a prize at the Royal College of Surgeons for his essay, &#145;On the anatomy of the fibres of the human brain, illustrated by the anatomy of the same parts in the lower vertebrata&#146;. His first book, <span class="italic">The Homologies of the Human Skeleton</span> (1849), placed human anatomy in the context of the archetype skeleton of the naturalist Richard Owen. It was not a significant contribution.<br>
<br>As demonstrator of anatomy at St Bartholomew's medical school, Coote taught in the dissecting room until elected assistant surgeon in 1854. In 1863 he was elected full surgeon to the hospital. In 1855 the governors agreed to allow him to serve in the Crimean War as civil surgeon in charge of casualties at Smyrna. After returning from the war he published <span class="italic">A Report on some of the More Important Points in the Treatment of Syphilis</span> (1857). His experience in the Crimean War formed the basis for his interest in the problems of bones and the treatment of wounds, and he published several papers on bone and joint diseases and on the importance of careful management in the treatment of wounds in <span class="italic">St Bartholomew's Hospital Reports</span>. In 1867 he published a volume entitled <span class="italic">On Joint Diseases</span>. His published work did not break new ground and he was not an investigator of any calibre. His strengths were as a teacher and interpreter.<br>
<br>Tall and strongly built, Coote was reportedly kind to both colleagues and patients and enjoyed good food and company. He was married twice: first, on 15 August 1848, to Jessie Blanche (<i>d</i>. 1849), daughter of John Herbert Koe, barrister and county court judge; and secondly, on 14 September 1852, to Georgina Gordon, daughter of Gordon Lorimer, gentleman. Coote never succeeded in establishing a very extensive practice and consequently was not well off. While only in his fifties he looked older than his years, and suffered from mental problems, including delusions of boundless wealth. He died from &#145;general paralysis of the insane&#146; (syphilis) on 21 December 1872, while an in-patient of Blacklands House private lunatic asylum, Chelsea, London.<br>
