<span class="headword">Goodison,  Benjamin</span>  (<em>c.</em>1700&#150;1767), <span class="occ">cabinet-maker and undertaker</span>, is of unknown parentage, although the surname is common in south Yorkshire. His occupation is first recorded in September 1719 when he signed for &pound;500 from Sarah, duchess of Marlborough, for his master the London cabinet-maker James Moore the elder. Goodison was probably apprenticed to Moore about 1716. Some of the giltwood furniture previously attributed to Moore made at this time may be by Goodison working under Moore's supervision. The Bateman chest (V&amp;A) made to commemorate the marriage of William Bateman and Lady Anne Spencer (a granddaughter of the duchess of Marlborough) in 1720 is more boldly sculptural in design than James Moore's documented work and characteristic in style of later documented work by Goodison. In 1720 Goodison signed a further receipt for work done for &#145;My Master James Moore&#146; for Richard Boyle, third earl of Burlington.<br>
<br>By 1725 Goodison was sufficiently experienced to set up on his own and took on an apprentice in January that year. He married Sarah Cooper at St Bride's, Fleet Street, London, on 13 August 1723, but their son, also called Benjamin, was not baptized until 23 February 1735 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster. Goodison worked at the sign of the Golden Spread Eagle in Long Acre and in August 1727 a newspaper announced the theft from his premises of &#145;a large old fashioned Glass Sconce, in a Glass Frame, with Gold Flowers painted on the Glass Frame, and a Green Ground&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Courant</span>, 22, 23 and 24 Aug 1727), demonstrating that he also dealt in secondhand furniture.<br>
<br>By then Goodison had succeeded his master James Moore (who died in 1726) in royal service. In 1729 Goodison supplied a brass lantern for the queen's staircase at Hampton Court Palace for &pound;138 (still <i>in situ</i>). During the 1730s royal demands for furniture were supervised by the master of the great wardrobe, Sir Thomas Robinson. Goodison regularly supplied mahogany, walnut, and giltwood furniture for royal use in palaces and yachts. Some of the giltwood furniture previously attributed to Goodison in the Royal Collection has now been reattributed to the Pelletier workshop, and redated to the early 1700s. No mahogany or walnut furniture by Goodison in the Royal Collection has been identified although detailed descriptions survive in the bills. For instance, in 1741 Goodison was paid &pound;16 10<i>s</i>. by the lord chamberlain for a &#145;Mahogany Library Table with Drawers on one side and Cupboards on the other &hellip; top covered with black leather &amp; Castors to ye Bottom&#146;  (Beard and Gilbert, 352).<br>
<br>Many of Goodison's early customers were related to Sarah, duchess of Marlborough, a client whom Goodison inherited from his master. (Goodison was still supplying her with looking-glasses for Blenheim Palace in the 1730s.) Goodison also worked for her son-in-law, John, second duke of Montagu, supplying furniture for Montagu House, Whitehall, to the designs of the architect Henry Flitcroft. These include a mahogany library table with lion masks and a set of stepped mahogany bookcases with elaborate carved foliage. With their sober use of richly coloured hardwood, they formed an appropriate complement to the Palladian interiors (Boughton House, Northamptonshire). Goodison also worked with Flitcroft at the Dover Street, London, house which Goodison purchased in 1740 as agent for Sarah, duchess of Marlborough. The house was intended for her recently widowed granddaughter Isabella, duchess of Manchester&#151;the elder daughter of the second duke of Montagu. Here Goodison provided chimney-pieces to Flitcroft's designs as well as walnut tables and chairs. For the duchess of Marlborough's other daughter, Lady Sunderland, Goodison provided furniture for Althorp, Northamptonshire, including a pair of white-painted supports for marble tables in the entrance hall and a pedestal for the terracotta bust of Van Dyck by J. M. Rysbrack. Goodison provided an inventory of the contents of Althorp in 1746.<br>
<br>The accounts of John, second duke of Montagu, demonstrate that in addition to supplying new furniture Goodison took charge of old furniture from the duke's former London home Montagu House, Bloomsbury, and restored and reframed pictures and looking-glasses where necessary. A pair of overdoor paintings by Jean-Baptiste Monnoyer (priv. coll.), formerly in Marot-style frames by the Pelletier workshop, were reframed by Goodison for Montagu House, Whitehall. Goodison also worked for Montagu's son-in-law, George Brudenell, fourth earl of Cardigan, furnishing his house in Dover Street, London.<br>
<br>Goodison worked for the first and second viscounts Folkestone supplying furniture for Longford Castle, Wiltshire, considered in 1754 to be &#145;one of the best furnished houses in England&#146;  (J. J. Cartwright, ed., <span class="italic">The Travels through England of Dr Pococke</span>, 1888&#150;9). It is probable that on this occasion Goodison designed the furniture himself. The mahogany and gilt seating in the gallery, for which Goodison received &pound;400 in 1740, consists of two mahogany daybeds, and two large and eight smaller stools. The fine carving of lions' paw feet and superimposed shells on the legs of the stools and daybeds is lightened by the Greek key pattern which serves as a frieze along the seat rails and is highlighted with gilding. A similar set of seating furniture at Woburn Abbey is attributed to Goodison by comparison with the Longford suite. A pair of pedestals incorporating heads of Hercules retain their original eighteenth-century oak-grained painted and gilded surfaces and are also attributed to Goodison. Two substantial marble tables supported on carved wooden plinths incorporating twin figures of foxes are also thought to be the work of Goodison (priv. coll. and V&amp;A). One was originally intended for the two-storey Palladian hall at Longford (dem. in the nineteenth century) and was painted white to imitate statuary marble in order to complement the busts in niches around the hall. The other, curved in form, and originally painted green and gilded, was intended for the circular green drawing room with its carved giltwood decoration supplied in 1747 by Goodison's assistant Edward Griffiths.<br>
<br>Goodison is also associated with the architect William Kent and certainly made furniture to Kent's designs for Sir Thomas Coke, later earl of Leicester, at Holkham, Norfolk. His early commissions included mahogany stools for a temple in the grounds supplied in 1739. Goodison was again employed at Holkham after Kent's death, when the work was probably supervised by the architect Matthew Brettingham. In 1757 Goodison supplied a carved and gilt mahogany table press with wire doors for the gallery. He later made an elaborate carved and gilt frame for the painting of Coriolanus by Pietro da Cortona, for which he charged &pound;74.<br>
<br>Goodison also supplied furniture to Frederick, prince of Wales, and served as his undertaker in 1751, supplying eighty black sconces for the funeral in the Henry VII chapel, Westminster Abbey. Fifteen years later his will mentions that he had not been paid for some of the work done for the prince. When Goodison died in London in 1767, the business was carried on by his nephew, Benjamin Parran, whom he had taken on as an apprentice in 1741. In 1769 Parran formed a partnership with Goodison's son Benjamin, who had qualified as a lawyer by 1764. They continued business as undertakers and serviced the funeral of the duke of Newcastle in 1768. One of Goodison's daughters, Sarah, married the carver and sculptor William Hinchliff, who with Benjamin Goodison the younger acted as executor to his father-in-law.<br>
<br>Benjamin Goodison was a pious man with literary tastes. He enjoyed poetry, and in 1736 subscribed to Stephen Duck's <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> and in 1748 to a similar volume of poems by Thomas Warton. On his death Goodison left an estate of approximately &pound;16,000. This included a substantial house in Mitcham, Surrey, as well as his London property in Long Acre, Covent Garden.<br>
