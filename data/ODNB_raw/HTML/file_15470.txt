<span class="headword">Kerr,  William Henry</span>, fourth marquess of Lothian  (<em>c.</em>1712&#150;1775), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the eldest son of William, third marquess (<i>c</i>.1690&#150;1767), and Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1759), daughter and coheir of Sir Thomas Nicholson of Kemney, first baronet. Until his father's accession to the marquessate in 1722 he was known as Lord Jedburgh; afterwards, as earl of Ancrum. He was appointed a cornet in his grand-uncle Lord Mark Kerr's regiment (the 11th dragoons) on 20 June 1735. On 6 November of that year, at St James's, Westminster, he married Lady Caroline D'Arcy (<i>d</i>. 1778), only daughter of Robert, third earl of Holdernesse; she brought him &pound;20,000. On 9 January 1739 he was made captain in Cornwallis's regiment of foot (the 11th) and in 1741 he was promoted captain and lieutenant-colonel in the 1st regiment of foot guards (the Grenadier Guards).<br>
<br>Ancrum acted as aide-de-camp to William, duke of Cumberland, at Fontenoy (30 April 1745), where he was wounded by a shot in the head. On 4 June 1745 he was promoted to the brevet rank of colonel in the army and on 22 June returned to the 11th dragoons with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Together with his regiment he joined Cumberland's forces in England in the summer and autumn of 1745, in pursuit of the Jacobite army. In early 1746, after the battle of Falkirk, he joined the government army in Scotland, now under Cumberland's command. In March Cumberland placed him in command of a small force of 100 troopers and 300 foot, dispatched from Aberdeen to take a quantity of Spanish arms and powder stored at Castle Corgaff, at the head of the River Don. Upon his approach the Jacobites quitted the castle, having destroyed the munitions. He returned safely without loss, causing Cumberland to report, &#145;during the whole expedition he has behaved with the greatest prudence and caution, and much like an officer&#146;  (Williams, 39).<br>
<br>At the battle of Culloden, Ancrum was placed in command of the cavalry on the extreme left wing. His orders were to move forward on the flank in readiness for a general pursuit of the highland army, once it was broken and in retreat. Cumberland noted that he carried the pursuit, &#145;with so good an effect that a very considerable number were killed&#146;  (Brett-Smith, 18). Indeed the royal cavalry inflicted terrible casualties across Culloden Moor, and Ancrum, although &#145;a chivalrous and compassionate man&#146;  (Prebble, 115), was ineffectual in preventing the slaughter. His brother Robert, a captain in the grenadier company of Barrel's regiment, which met the full onslaught of the highland charge before it was turned and broken, &#145;was the person of greatest distinction who was killed there&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scots peerage</span>, 5.480).<br>
<br>Immediately after the battle Ancrum was sent to the east coast of Scotland to suppress any continuing signs of revolt and to prevent Charles Edward Stuart's escape. After Cumberland's departure he was placed in command of the royal cavalry in Scotland. He rejoined Cumberland on the continent in August 1747 and on 1 December that year was made colonel of the 24th foot, later the South Wales Borderers.<br>
<br>Ancrum represented Richmond in parliament between 1747 and 1763 in the interest of his brother-in-law, Robert D'Arcy, fourth earl of Holdernesse. In the Commons he followed Cumberland's political lead. On the death of his grand-uncle in 1752 he became colonel of the 11th dragoons (8 February) and on 5 November 1755 he was promoted major-general. He served as lieutenant-general under the command of Charles Spencer, third duke of Marlborough, in the expedition to St Malo in 1758. He left his Commons seat in March 1763 after Holdernesse sold Richmond to Sir Lawrence Dundas.<br>
<br>Ancrum succeeded as fourth marquess of Lothian on his father's death on 28 July 1767. On 26 October 1768 he was chosen one of the sixteen representative peers in Scotland, and invested a knight of the Thistle at St James's Palace. He was promoted to the rank of general in 1770, and died at Bath on 12 April 1775. The marchioness died on 15 November 1778. They had three children: William John, fifth marquess; Louisa, who married Lord George Henry Lennox; and Willielmina, who married John Macleod, colonel in the Royal Artillery.<br>
