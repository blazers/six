<span class="headword">Allington, Sir  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1479), <span class="occ">speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was the younger son and second of three children of William Allington (<i>d</i>. 1459) of Horseheath in Cambridgeshire and his first wife, Elizabeth (1410/11&#150;1445), elder daughter of John Argentine. His mother was granddaughter and eventual sole heir of Sir William Argentine of Great Wymondley in Hertfordshire. The Allington family had been well-to-do Cambridgeshire gentry since the early fifteenth century. Beginning in the 1390s <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/92980/', "William Allington (d. 1446)")</script> had risen through the <i>cursus honorum</i> of Lancastrian service, culminating in his election as speaker of the House of Commons in 1429&#150;30. The family's combined annual income in 1436 was about &pound;200. William Allington of Horseheath added to the family fortune, remarrying twice: by 1447 he was married to Mary, widow of Henry Hayward of Boxted in Essex, and by 1454 to Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. after 1472), widow of Sir John Heveningham (<i>d</i>. 1453) of Heveningham in Suffolk. This made it possible for him to bestow Bottisham in Cambridgeshire on his younger son, William, while his heir, John (<i>d</i>. 1480), inherited the bulk of the family property in Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, and Suffolk. In 1452 John was implicated in rebellion at Babraham in Cambridgeshire, and by mid-1455 he was a prominent supporter of Richard, third duke of York, becoming his retainer in January 1456. He married well, however, settled down as one of the principal gentlemen of Cambridgeshire, and was counted among the Paston family's close friends.<br>
<br>On 9 January 1457 William Allington obtained a licence to marry Joan (<i>d</i>. 1493), daughter of John Anstey the elder of Stow-cum-Quy in Cambridgeshire and his wife, Joan. They were married in the chapel of Holme Hall nearby. William was a lawyer, and in July 1457 joined his father as a JP for Cambridgeshire and for Cambridge, later also becoming a JP for Huntingdonshire (1464&#150;70). He was added to the quorum for Cambridgeshire in August 1460, and apart from a few brief absences, notably during the Lancastrian purge of 1470&#150;71, remained on the bench until his death. Allington emerged as a committed Yorkist after the battle of Northampton (10 July 1460). In the years that followed his career was perhaps advanced by William Grey, bishop of Ely, for whom he carried out various kinds of legal business. He was MP for Plympton in Devon in 1467&#150;8. On 5 June 1470 Edmund Grey, first earl of Kent, made him a feoffee to uses of Saxthorpe in Norfolk, and it may have been through Grey that Allington became associated with the Woodvilles, the kinsmen of the queen. J. S. Roskell speculated that Allington joined Edward IV in exile during the Lancastrian readeption, which would explain why he became so prominent on the king's restoration.<br>
<br>Returned as knight of the shire for Cambridge on 10 September 1472, Allington was elected speaker of the House of Commons on 7 October. This was the first parliament since the crises of 1469&#150;71, and his speech opening the session praised the steadfastness of the Yorkists, and particularly the queen, in recent years. The birth of an heir, the future Edward V, was the &#145;grete joy and suerty of this &hellip; londe&#146;  (Roskell, &#145;William Allington&#146;, 48). Parliament supported the king's alliance with Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, but only voted a tenth towards an army to recover Normandy, Aquitaine, and the French crown, and that with restrictions. In February 1473 Allington was one of the twenty-five men appointed to act as tutors and councillors to the prince of Wales during the latter's minority (a group dominated by the Woodvilles), took part in the king's progress through the midlands and Welsh marches between May and September that year, and was on and off the commissions of the peace in Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Shropshire, and Worcestershire from 1473 to 1475. As the king's military plans developed, Allington's parliamentary management during the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh sessions (January 1474 to March 1475) was crucial in securing the cancellation of the original tenth and the grant of a new tenth and fifteenth and of three-quarters of a subsidy. This enabled Edward to mount a serious invasion of France in 1475, culminating in the highly lucrative treaty of Picquigny (29 August). During this campaign Allington was appointed to the regency council and perhaps became a royal councillor. The parliament of 1472&#150;5 was the longest yet held. Allington received various rewards for his services from the king and the Woodvilles, including &pound;200 for &#145;his true and due diligence in awaityng and attending upon our &hellip; parlement&#146;  (TNA: PRO, E 404/75/4, no. 29).<br>
<br>Allington was returned again for Cambridgeshire and re-elected speaker three days after a new parliament met on 16 January 1478. He played a significant part in proceedings against George, duke of Clarence, Edward IV's brother. The king's bill of attainder was passed and the lord high steward gave sentence of death on 7 February, but no action followed until, as the second Crowland continuator states, Allington &#145;came with his fellows into the upper chamber and made a fresh request for the business to be completed; consequently &hellip; the execution &hellip; was carried out&#146;  (Pronay and Cox, 147). This business dispatched, parliament was dissolved before the month was out. By July Allington had been knighted and further reward followed&#151;including appointment for life to the king's council on 11 August, the chancellorship of the duchy of Cornwall, and a life grant of a third of the issues of Bassingbourne in Cambridgeshire and of lands in that county formerly held by Clarence.<br>
<br>Allington died childless on 16 May 1479, leaving his brother, John, as his heir. As early as March 1474 he had provided for a chantry chapel at Bottisham with prayers to be offered by a monk from nearby Anglesey Priory for the good estate, in life and death, of the king and queen and of Allington and his wife. It is assumed that the indent on an altar tomb at Holy Trinity in Bottisham, depicting a knight in armour, represents Sir William (although he was probably interred at Anglesey Priory). Lady Allington married a man called Huddleston and died, again widowed, on 6 March 1493, by when the Allingtons were becoming loyal Tudor subjects.<br>
