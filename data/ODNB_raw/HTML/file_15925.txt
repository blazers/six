<span class="headword">Lambe,  John</span>  (1545/6&#150;1628), <span class="occ">astrologer</span>, of unknown parentage, probably originated in Worcestershire. According to his own later evidence he was first a teacher of reading and writing in English to the families of gentry. Without any training he began to practise medicine, assuming the title of &#145;doctor&#146;, then took up fortune telling. He was arrested in 1608, the charges being that during the previous December, at Tardebigge, Worcestershire, he attempted to disable or sap the strength of Thomas, sixth Lord Windsor, and in May 1608, at nearby Hindlip, he invoked evil spirits. Lambe was held in Worcester Castle, where he contrived to demonstrate his skill and powers to his many visitors. At his trial judgment was suspended on the first charge and stayed on the second.<br>
<br>Within two weeks of Lambe's trial some forty people, including sheriffs, justices, and others who had been present in court, died. The true cause was probably gaol fever, carried by an infected prisoner into the court, but a petition was raised for Lambe's transfer, and he was moved to London's king's bench prison. There he lived in some comfort in two rooms, with servants. He employed laundresses, who worked partly in his rooms and found their custom in the surrounding district. He continued to receive visitors and to practise as before, and during this period he met and became a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of George Villiers, duke of Buckingham and favourite of James I.<br>
<br>This comfortable if confined life was brought to an end on 16 June 1623 when Lambe, then aged seventy-seven, was indicted for the rape of Joan Seger, a girl of eleven who had been sent to his rooms at the prison with a basket of herbs. He was found guilty and sentenced to hang, but was first questioned by James Ley, lord chief justice. Details of Lambe's early life emerged from Ley's report to the secretary of state summarizing Lambe's evidence and defence. Ley found that the girl's father owed Lambe money, and that the charge of rape had only been laid some weeks later when Lambe tried to recover this debt. Ley decided that on the evidence the rape charge was not proved and on 4 June 1624 Lambe was pardoned and released. He then rented a house near parliament, where he lived for over a year.<br>
<br>Lambe's relationship with the hated Buckingham and his supposed magical powers on Buckingham's behalf were common knowledge, which was why the mob continuously watched him. On 12 June 1626 a freak storm caused a mist to rise from the Thames near to York House, Buckingham's residence. &#145;This occasioned the more discourse among the vulgar, in that Dr Lamb appeared there upon the Thames, to whose Art of Conjuring they attributed that which had happened&#146;  (Rushworth, 391). Buckingham's mother consulted Lambe about her son's fate; he showed her in a glass the figure of a big fat man with a long dagger, who would kill her son. Lambe was cited as a lover and supplier of charms to Lady Purbeck, Buckingham's sister-in-law. Charges of sorcery and adultery in that matter, made in November 1627, were later dropped, but in December he was again imprisoned, for inducing a Westminster scholar &#145;to give himself to the Devil&#146;  (Birch, 252).<br>
<br>For some time Lambe had claimed that he had been licensed to practise as a physician by the bishop of Durham. However, on 18 December 1627 he was examined by the College of Physicians of London and found to be ignorant of the language and practice of medicine. His plea was that he just pretended to examine and treat people, in order to acquire a little money.<br>
<br>On Friday 13 June 1628 Lambe went to the Fortune Theatre, a popular haunt of the lower classes. He was recognized by some lads, who waited outside for him and then followed him, attracting thereby a larger gathering; Lambe's reaction was to hire some sailors to act as a bodyguard. They kept the crowd at bay while he supped at the Horseshoe tavern off Moor Lane. He then entered the City at Moorgate, followed by a now hostile crowd who pelted him with stones. He took shelter in the Windmill tavern, at which the crowd took vengeance on his bodyguard. The tavern keeper, fearful for his own safety, forced Lambe to leave; he managed to sneak out unseen and find refuge in a nearby house, but was discovered by the mob and again ejected. Emerging on the street, he was surrounded, and stoned and clubbed into unconsciousness. He was carried into a compter (a small lockup) in the Poultry, where he died early on 14 June. In his pockets were found a crystal ball, knives, pictures, a gold nightcap, and 40 shillings. He was buried the next day in the churchyard of St Mildred Poultry. Buckingham was stabbed to death two months later.<br>
<br>No one was ever brought to trial for Lambe's killing. The City authorities were severally admonished for failing to prevent his death and find his killers, and in 1632 the king's bench imposed a fine of &pound;1000 on them, which was raised by a levy on the City companies. In September or October 1628 there appeared <span class="italic">A briefe description of the notorious life of Iohn Lambe, otherwise called Doctor Lambe. Together with his ignominious death</span>. Supposedly published in Amsterdam, it bore no author's or printer's name; it was, however, printed in London, and was followed by many broadsheets and ballads commemorating a strange life and a horrific death.<br>
