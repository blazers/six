<span class="headword">Fitzgerald, Sir  Peter George</span>, nineteenth knight of Kerry  (1808&#150;1880), <span class="occ">civil servant and landowner</span>, eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9579/', "Maurice Fitzgerald, eighteenth knight of Kerry (1774&#150;1849)")</script>, and his first wife, Maria (<i>d</i>. 1829), daughter of the Rt Hon. David La Touche of Marlay, co. Dublin, was born on 15 September 1808. He married on 11 August 1838 Julia Hussey (<i>d</i>. 1896), daughter of Peter Bodkin Hussey of Farranikilla House, Dingle, co. Kerry, a Catholic of Old English ancestry. They had four sons and seven daughters. He began work in the banking house of his maternal grandfather at Dublin. He subsequently entered public service, and was appointed vice-treasurer of Ireland in the 1841&#150;6 ministry of Sir Robert Peel. Succeeding his father in 1849, he found the estate to be heavily mortgaged, but was assisted by his La Touche relatives in repurchasing his lands from the encumbered estates court. From that period he resided almost constantly on Valentia Island, devoting himself to the duties of landlord, the improvement of his estates, and the welfare of his tenantry. He especially earned the thanks of the people by the erection of substantial homesteads in place of the wretched cabins with which the middleman system had covered the west of Ireland. Nevertheless, he encountered passive resistance and press criticism of some of his consolidation schemes.<br>
<br>Fitzgerald manifested a keen interest in all questions which had a practical bearing on the progress or prosperity of Ireland; and in contributions to <span class="italic">The Times</span> he deprecated the censure which was cast indiscriminately upon all Irish landlords. He was the author of several tracts on the law of marriage, the Irish church question, and landlord&#150;tenant relations. The Atlantic cable had its British termination on his estates, and he evinced much public spirit and energy in connection with the successful laying of the cable. Fitzgerald was a magistrate and deputy lieutenant for co. Kerry, and was high sheriff of co. Kerry in 1849, and of co. Carlow in 1875. On 8 July 1880 the queen conferred upon him a baronetcy. Fitzgerald was by then, however, suffering from a dangerous illness, and he died at Glanleam, Valentia, on 6 August 1880. He was succeeded in the title and estates by his eldest son, Captain Maurice Fitzgerald, who served with distinction in the Second Anglo-Asante War, and who restored the family's decaying fortunes by marrying a German Jewish heiress.<br>
