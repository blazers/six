<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Manning,  Henry Edward</span>  (1808&#150;1892), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic convert and cardinal-archbishop of Westminster</span>, was born at Copped Hall, Totteridge, Hertfordshire, on 15 July 1808, the eighth and youngest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47808/', "William Manning (1763&#150;1835)")</script>, West Indies merchant and tory MP, and his second wife, Mary Hunter (1771&#150;1847), who had influential City connections, her brother becoming lord mayor of London in 1811. William Manning had made his fortune from the West Indian sugar trade and his family grew up in circumstances of considerable affluence, as he gained successive offices of prestige within the City, culminating in his appointment as governor of the Bank of England in 1812&#150;14. Henry Edward was baptized by the bishop of Bath and Wells, and one of his godfathers was a former prime minister, Henry Addington, Viscount Sidmouth. In 1815 the family moved to Coombe Bank at Sundridge, near Sevenoaks, where the young Manning soon made friends with Christopher and Charles Wordsworth, the sons of the rector of Sundridge, the brother of William Wordsworth.<h2>
<a name="Education"></a>Education</h2>Until the age of eight, Manning was educated at home; he then proceeded to a private school at Streatham, from which he was speedily removed because his father feared the lingering influence within the school of a boy who had been removed for immoral practices. He returned to Totteridge where the local curate was taking in private pupils. At the age of fourteen he was sent to Harrow School, where he distinguished himself more in games than at study, playing for two successive years (1825&#150;6) in the Harrow cricket eleven. At this stage of his life he exhibited few indications of subsequent eminence. Being somewhat aloof and fastidious, he was nicknamed the General; he was certainly not particularly pious. His mother had instilled in him a not altogether healthy fear of the inevitability of the day of judgment, but the somewhat high-church religious ambience at Sundridge appears to have left him relatively unmoved. It was not until he left Harrow in 1826 that a major transformation occurred, induced by grief at the death in that year of his favourite sister, Harriet, and by the close association he then formed with his brothers-in-law, John Anderdon, his first real mentor. This was less of a religious conversion than a realization that success in life depended upon industry and disciplined will-power. He therefore subjected himself to a rigorous regime of study under the direction of Canon William Fisher at his coaching establishment at Poulshot in Wiltshire. In April 1827 he entered Balliol College, Oxford. For the next three years, although his health was poor&#151;he was a chronic asthmatic all his life&#151;he worked assiduously, owing much to his tutor, Herman Merivale, and forging stronger links of friendship with Charles Wordsworth at Christ Church and his contemporary at the same college, W. E. Gladstone. He also discovered a talent for public speaking as well as an arena in which to display it&#151;the newly founded Oxford Union, where he enjoyed meteoric success, being cast by his auditors as the rising young statesman of his generation. In December 1830 his industry was rewarded with a first class in Greats.<h2>
<a name="Ordinationandmarriage"></a>Ordination and marriage</h2>There followed a combination of circumstances which altered the whole direction of Manning's life. His hopes of a distinguished political career were dashed when his father's fortunes collapsed, ominously precipitated by a slump in sugar prices in 1829. In 1831 Manning had the harrowing experience of accompanying his father to the Guildhall to hand in his seals of office, the symbolic last possessions of a bankrupt. For a short period he was grudgingly grateful to obtain a junior clerkship in the Colonial Office, during which unhappy period he came under the influence of the second, if only temporary, mentor of his life&#151;an exceedingly pious evangelical lady, Favell Bevan, the sister of one of his Harrow contemporaries. The extent of Miss Bevan's influence in drawing Manning into a state of evangelical &#145;seriousness&#146; has been open to some question  (O'Gorman), but their association undoubtedly coincided with Manning's decision to abandon his political aspirations for a career in the church. He returned to Oxford and, in April 1832, was elected fellow of Merton, taking deacon's orders in December of that year. In Manning's subsequent quest for a curacy, his friend Henry Wilberforce arranged for him a temporary engagement&#151;until he was ready to take up the post himself&#151;as curate to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24666/', "John Sargent")</script>, the evangelical rector of Lavington and Graffham in Sussex, little realizing what the consequences would be. Manning went to Lavington in January 1833 and fell in love with one of John Sargent's daughters, Caroline, to whom he became engaged after a courtship of three months. In May of the same year John Sargent died, and Manning was presented to the living by Caroline's grandmother, having taken priest's orders immediately after John Sargent's death. He and Caroline were married in November 1833.<br>
<br>Thus came about the forging of the closest of bonds between Manning and the Wilberforce and Sargent families. Samuel Wilberforce (later bishop of Oxford and of Winchester) had married Caroline's elder sister, Emily, in 1828; his brother Henry, not at all put out by the chain of events, married yet another Sargent daughter (Mary) in July 1834. In the same month, the fourth Sargent daughter, Sophia, married George Dudley Ryder. Tragically, three of the brothers-in-law were to undergo the agonies of early bereavement, through the successive deaths of Caroline Manning (25 July 1837), Emily Wilberforce (1841), and Sophia Ryder (1850).<br>
<br>Manning suffered first, and the loss of Caroline (there were no children) was a lifelong sorrow. He kept all her letters, which were stolen&#151;to his great grief&#151;from a travelling bag when he was <i>en route</i> for Rome in 1851; on his deathbed, he entrusted to Herbert Vaughan, his successor at Westminster, a book of Caroline's prayers, from which he had prayed and meditated every day since her death. Thereby he also paid final testimony to his enduring attachment to the Church of England.<h2>
<a name="ManningandAnglicanism"></a>Manning and Anglicanism</h2>Manning's advance into full sympathy with Newman's stance at Oxford, while never amounting to adulation and always maintaining a measure of independence, progressed in stages: first, an acceptance of the doctrine of baptismal regeneration (at the time of his ordination) and (by 1834) an understanding of the nature of the real presence, gained from a study of Richard Hooker. In 1835, when he preached his first published sermon (<span class="italic">The English Church, its Succession and Witness for Christ</span>) at a visitation in Chichester Cathedral, he gave eloquent expression to his conviction of the exalted nature of the priestly office; he reverted to this theme in his second visitation sermon, in 1838 (<span class="italic">The Rule of Faith</span>, published in the same year), by which time he had arrived at the conclusion that the credentials of the Church of England must be seen to lie in its authoritative role as the teacher and interpreter of Christian doctrine (the church as <i>ecclesia docens</i>). Although he had shared Samuel Wilberforce's reservations about the severe tone of Newman's first volume of sermons, Manning fully endorsed the concept of the Anglican church as the <i>via media</i> between the corruptions of Rome and the heresies of continental protestantism, and he therefore undertook to become a distributor of the <span class="roman">Tracts for the Times</span> in his locality. In 1836, in collaboration with Charles Marriott, he contributed a tract himself&#151;<span class="roman">Tract 78</span>, a <i>catena patrum</i> on the subject of Catholic tradition. In 1837 he pinned his colours to the Tractarian mast by registering his vote at Oxford in protest against the appointment of the allegedly heterodox R. D. Hampden as regius professor of divinity.<br>
<br>Although during these years Manning's strongest bond of affection was with his senior brother-in-law, Samuel Wilberforce, another close&#151;and probably more formative&#151;friendship had developed with Samuel Francis Wood (younger brother of Charles Wood, later first Viscount Halifax), a brilliant young lawyer, greatly attached to Newman, and himself a keen student of theology. They became firm friends in the course of their joint work on behalf of the National Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor, and recent research has unearthed a highly significant correspondence, as early as the winter of 1835, between Wood (the instigator), Newman, and Manning on the church's role in the development of Christian doctrine, which was later to prove such a decisive issue in Newman's conversion to Rome  (Pereiro, 218&#150;53). Manning was himself engaged in patristic studies during these years (offering a contribution to Pusey's <span class="roman">Library of the Fathers</span> on Justin Martyr), and his scholarship was clearly demonstrated in his most substantial book, written as an Anglican, <span class="italic">The Unity of the Church</span> (1842). There is no doubt, however, that he deeply respected Wood's judgement on all theological questions. After Wood's untimely death in 1843, Manning found a second mentor on theological matters in yet another of the Wilberforce family&#151;Robert Wilberforce, archdeacon of the East Riding, brother of Samuel and Henry, and also a future convert to Rome.<br>
<br>Within the diocese of Chichester, and indeed beyond, Manning was making his mark in other ways, as well as by acquiring influential friends. In 1837 he became rural dean of Midhurst, and rapidly established a reputation as the most active and efficient among his diocesan colleagues. He was appointed to the corresponding committee of the National Society and&#151;in the company of S. F. Wood and Thomas Acland&#151;was the leading force in the founding of the theological college at Chichester, securing his friend Charles Marriott as its first principal. The establishment of the ecclesiastical commission on a permanent basis in 1836, with extensive powers to tackle the anomalies and abuses within the Church of England, provoked Manning to follow the lead of Pusey in publishing an intemperate protest against what he conceived to be an unwarranted encroachment by the state upon the independent authority of the church (<span class="italic">Principles of the Ecclesiastical Commission Examined</span>, 1838), which brought about a renewal of friendship and the beginning of regular correspondence with Gladstone. He was overworking himself, partly as a reaction to the feeling of crushing emptiness after Caroline's death, and William Otter, his bishop, persuaded him to take a complete break abroad. So, in the winter of 1838, Manning decided to join Gladstone who was spending Christmas in Rome. This was to be the first of twenty-two visits that Manning made to the &#145;eternal city&#146; in the course of his life.<h2>
<a name="ArchdeaconofChichester"></a>Archdeacon of Chichester</h2>Shortly after his return from Rome, Manning received his reward for his industry and influence. In December 1840 he was appointed archdeacon of Chichester in succession to the senile Charles Webber, who had been prevailed upon to retire. It was a preferment hardly to be expected from the new evangelical bishop, William Shuttleworth, who had swallowed his antipathy to Tractarians in response to pressure from Julius Hare, archdeacon of Lewes, and the dean of Chichester, G. Chandler, and also because Webber candidly admitted that Manning had been effectively acting as archdeacon since he became rural dean.<br>
<br>As archdeacon, Manning soon became a national figure. A speech that he delivered in Willis's Rooms in London in April 1841, on the subject of the need for more colonial bishops, was so powerful that Gladstone recalled its eloquence fifty years later, and George Selwyn, who was also in the audience, described it as the turning point of his life. His archidiaconal charges were read nationwide, their main significance today lying in the remarkable similarity between the declared priorities in these charges and those which he was later to define in his pastorals as archbishop of Westminster: urgent attention to the plight of the poor and the outcasts of society; sympathy for the lot of the labouring classes and condemnation of exploitation by greedy landowners and employers; and the crucial need for the education of the poor and for the preservation of its denominational character. A theme of several of his Anglican sermons&#151;the church's obligation to undertake the proper training of ordinands&#151;would reappear in time, once he became archbishop of Westminster, as would his emphasis on the awesome nature of a priest's responsibilities and duties (to be prepared &#145;to be crucified with Christ&#146;, as he put it in an Oxford University sermon in 1843). This would be repeated in his work <span class="italic">The Eternal Priesthood</span> (1883), a tough challenge for seminarians, since it reads like a counsel of unattainable perfection. A further enduring theme (which would change only in name when he became a Catholic) was the independence of the church from secular interference: the need to combat Erastianism as applied to the Church of England, labouring under unacceptable manifestations of the royal supremacy.<h2>
<a name="NewmanandRomanCatholicism"></a>Newman and Roman Catholicism</h2>Nevertheless, bold as Manning was in his own championship of the Catholic traditions within the Anglican church, he began studiously to distance himself from the Romeward trend of Newman in 1841 and thereafter. He sincerely believed that Newman's notorious <span class="roman">Tract 90</span> was misconceived; and when called upon to preach the sermon on 5 November at Oxford in 1843&#151;a delicate mission in the circumstances&#151;Manning took the opportunity to inveigh against &#145;the secular domination of the Roman pontiff&#146; and to declare his own total devotion to &#145;our highly-favoured Church&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sermons Preached before the University of Oxford</span>, 1844, 81). From the sensitive and sympathetic correspondence that continued between Manning and Newman up to the point of Newman's reception into the Roman Catholic church in October 1845, however, there is no suggestion of personal estrangement on either side.<br>
<br>Difficult years lay ahead for Manning. Samuel Wilberforce became bishop of Oxford in the same month as Newman's reception, and Manning felt less able to share his private anxieties with him. Pressure was being put upon him to apply his own moderating influence and reputation for statesmanship to rally the shaken ranks of those whom Newman had abandoned. Gladstone begged him, in the winter of 1845, to produce a weighty challenge to the arguments of Newman's <span class="italic">Essay on Development</span>. Manning was well aware that his friends were looking to the day when he would follow his brother-in-law into the ranks of the episcopate, and a new&#151;rather improbable&#151;friendship with the crusty old doyen of the high-church party, Henry Phillpotts, bishop of Exeter, made such an expectation even surer. Yet, when the obvious opening occurred in December 1845&#151;the offer of the post of sub-almoner to the archbishop of York, generally regarded as a springboard to episcopal office&#151;Manning declined it, to the surprise and consternation of his friends.<br>
<br>The truth is that Manning embarked upon the task that Gladstone had set him only to discover that he found Newman's arguments unanswerable. Only to a very few people could he safely communicate his growing fears that he might be ministering within a schismatical church: Henry Wilberforce and Mary, his wife; his own curate, Charles Laprimaudaye, who had become his spiritual director; and Robert Wilberforce, the man whom he hoped would be most able to allay his doubts. In February 1847 he fell seriously ill. He spent ten months of his convalescence abroad, determined to learn for himself as much as he could about continental Catholicism and Catholic theology. Much of the time was spent in Rome, where he had an audience with Pope Pius IX on 11 May 1848. He returned to England still undecided. Three years of spiritual anguish followed, during which&#151;according to the unsympathetic account given by E. S. Purcell, his first major biographer&#151;he spoke with &#145;a double voice&#146;, stoutly defending the Church of England while privately doubting its claims to be a church at all. It should be observed that from this point in Purcell's two-volume biography, published in 1896, indications of strong personal animus appear, amounting to distortion and calumny in the construction that he places on Manning's motives and ruthlessness during the course of his Catholic career. Unfortunately for Manning's reputation in the eyes of posterity, these imputations of unscrupulous personal ambition were to be popularized in 1918 by Lytton Strachey in the first of his essays in <span class="italic">Eminent Victorians</span>. Purcell's motive and methods have been rightly questioned more recently  (see Gilley, 166&#150;98).<br>
<br>A fairer way of representing Manning's dilemma in the years between 1848 and 1851 is to recognize that he could not contemplate injury to the church whose preferments he had accepted, and the sorrow caused to those near to him, until his doubts had become certainties. This eventually came about through an escalating series of considerations and events: his conviction that the Church of England lacked the strength of the penitential system that he had seen at work abroad, as he testified to Henry Wilberforce and T. W. Allies on his return to England in 1848; and the emotional blow of the secession of Henry and Mary Wilberforce in June 1850. On his own admission, however, it was the proof of the inherent Erastianism of the Church of England that forced him to take the decisive step. The church had been impotent in 1847 when Lord John Russell had ignored the howls of protest against his appointment of R. D. Hampden to the bishopric of Hereford. Even more serious, the judicial committee of the privy council (a largely secular tribunal) had presumed to make the final and irrevocable judgment in the Gorham case of 1850, thereby overruling the decision of the court of arches to support the bishop of Exeter's refusal to institute to a living in his diocese a Calvinist who denied the doctrine of baptismal regeneration. Here was proof positive that the Church of England must resign all claims to be an <i>ecclesia docens</i>, if the state had the right to dictate on matters of doctrine. Manning's protest, his last publication within the Church of England (<span class="italic">The Appellate Jurisdiction of the Crown in Matters Spiritual</span>, 1850), went unheeded. When, later that same year, Pius IX proclaimed the restoration of the Roman Catholic hierarchy in England, thereby precipitating outraged protestant accusations of &#145;papal aggression&#146;, Manning was required as archdeacon to convene his clergy to register their repudiation of the papal effrontery. In duty bound, he summoned the meeting; but in conscience bound he vacated the chair and announced his intention to resign. On 6 April 1851, in the company of his friend James Hope, he was received into the Roman Catholic communion by Father Brownbill SJ at the Jesuit church in Farm Street.<h2>
<a name="ARomanCatholicpriest"></a>A Roman Catholic priest</h2>&#145;After this I shall sink to the bottom and disappear&#146;, Manning observed to Robert Wilberforce. Did he sincerely believe this, and did it seriously worry him if he did? Loss of friends deeply distressed him; so too did loss of influence in high places. As for personal advancement, when a member of the cabinet told him in 1854 that, if he had remained an Anglican, he would have gained the bishopric of Salisbury (instead of W. K. Hamilton), his reply was, &#145;What an escape my poor soul did have&#146;  (Gray, 153). In fact, he had underestimated the percipience of Nicholas Wiseman, now installed as cardinal-archbishop of Westminster. He was fully aware of the depth of Manning's spirituality and the many gifts and talents that he could bring to the service of the church. Against Manning's own wishes he ordained him priest on 14 June 1851, within ten weeks of his reception. In the autumn of 1851 Manning left for Rome to study at the Accademia Ecclesiastica, where he remained, returning for occasional breaks in England, until the late summer of 1854. Here again he made an immediate impression, both on Pius IX, with whom he was to have frequent audiences, and on his recently appointed papal chamberlain, acting as Wiseman's personal representative in Rome, the Hon. George Talbot, who had been Manning's travelling companion <i>en route</i> for Rome. He was awarded a papal doctorate at the conclusion of his studies and the pope tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade him to remain at Rome as a papal chamberlain with prelatial rank.<br>
<br>But Manning's place, at his own wish, was in England. An immediate service which he could offer, on the outbreak of the Crimean War, was to use his influence with former friends in the government (and his diplomatic skills with wary members of the Catholic hierarchy) to supply Florence Nightingale with nuns to act as nurses in the Crimea. A more permanent challenge was to respond to Wiseman's invitation to him to found a community of mission priests to work in the poorest quarters of London. This was the origin of the congregation of the Oblates of St Charles Borromeo, for the headquarters of which Manning secured a partially built church in Bayswater (St Mary of the Angels). Having drawn up a rule, Manning was appointed superior, and the congregation began its active life in 1857. For the next eight years&#151;the happiest years of his life, as he later recalled&#151;Bayswater remained his residence; during that time he converted the area around him into a virtual Catholic stronghold, building three new churches and four convents, and setting up eight schools, a choir school, and a reformatory.<br>
<br>These successes, and the favours lavished upon him, did not endear Manning to many of the old English Catholics. He seemed to be in too much of a hurry, a &#145;forward piece&#146; as William Hogarth, bishop of Hexham, described him. He was accused of being over-zealous in his determination to gain converts. By 1865 his tally amounted to 346; as some of them came from the ranks of the aristocracy, he was&#151;very unfairly&#151;taunted with the title the &#145;Apostle of the Genteels&#146;. Wiseman's affection for him did not pass unnoticed. Within a year of his reception Wiseman had invited him, with Newman, to preach one of the two sermons at the first synod of Oscott in July 1852; Pius IX then caused a stir of unrest, amounting almost to a mutiny within the chapter of Westminster, by personally appointing Manning provost of Westminster in 1857.<br>
<br>Understandably, the most resentful were those who had been closest to Wiseman's inner councils before Manning appeared to usurp their place. But the most implacable opponent was Wiseman's own coadjutor, with right of succession to the Westminster see, George Errington, archbishop of Trebizond. Errington was an able canon lawyer who was totally unsympathetic to the religious temper and Italianate usages of the so-called &#145;new ultramontanism&#146;, which coincided with Wiseman's arrival in England and the restoration of the hierarchy. Many of the recent converts rejoiced to see such a day, but it was a wind of change uncongenial to the majority of old English Catholics who responded to it with insular indifference. Errington's many attempts to thwart Manning's influence eventually centred on what he conceived to be a virtual take-over of the seminary at St Edmund's, near Ware, by the Oblates, and the consequent introduction there of Roman usages, both in dress and devotions. The climax of this clash of personalities was fought out in Rome, when Errington's opposition turned into open disloyalty to Wiseman himself. This, then, became Wiseman's battle, and Manning prudently played no direct part in it. But it was to lead to a fateful conclusion. Errington, at the pope's command, was deprived of his coadjutorship and his right of succession to the see.<br>
<br>Already something of a division into parties was becoming discernible among English Catholics, tending to centre on the personalities and priorities of the two most distinguished converts, Newman and Manning. This was almost inevitable, granted their different temperaments and the conflicting interests dearest to their hearts. Newman was anxious to elevate the intellectual standing (and standards) of the Catholic laity; both the tone of his writings and the refreshingly independent spirit displayed within them appealed especially to the Catholic intelligentsia. He became involved, somewhat reluctantly, with Lord Acton and the newly founded organ of liberal Catholicism, <span class="italic">The Rambler</span>, which was inclined in the subject matter of its articles to trespass on the sacred preserves of the hierarchy and official theologians. Newman's wish to establish a branch of the Oratory in Oxford raised fears that his return to his old stamping ground would encourage the laity to defy the inhibition against Catholics attending the university, imposed for fear of their encountering influences damaging to their faith. Both Wiseman and Manning were uneasy about Newman's influence, Manning going so far (after he became archbishop) as to express his views in a private letter to Mgr Talbot that Newman was attempting to reproduce in the church &#145;the old Anglican, patristic, literary Oxford tone&#146;, unfairly branding such an attitude as &#145;worldly&#146; or &#145;diluted&#146; Catholicism  (Newsome, <span class="italic">Convert Cardinals</span>, 257&#150;8). Manning agreed with Newman in putting Catholic education as a top priority, but his main concern was the education of the poor, the founding of Catholic elementary schools, and the provision of seminaries for the training of the secular clergy.<br>
<br>The divergence became a rift, however, over the vexed question of the pope's &#145;temporal power&#146;. To Newman the retention of papal sovereignty within his traditional patrimony was a thing indifferent. To Manning it was the essential safeguard of the pope's independence from secular control, and he was prepared to fight this issue with almost apocalyptic fervour. It was understandable that he should do so. His visit to Rome in 1847 and 1848 had coincided with the flight of Pius IX to Gaeta and the setting up of the Mazzinian Roman Republic. He saw, more clearly than many of his contemporaries, the hypocrisy that underlay Cavour's facile slogan &#145;A free church in a free state&#146;, which was purely a cover to wrest education out of the hands of the church, to spoliate ecclesiastical endowments, and ultimately to silence its effective voice. Furthermore, Manning had abandoned the Church of England because of its inability to resist Erastianism. On the wider stage of the worldwide Catholic communion, secular pretensions to gain control of the church were what he was wont to describe as &#145;Caesarism&#146;, representing it as the greatest menace of modern times. He had not left the Anglican church in order to see the vicar of Christ become as impotent as the archbishop of Canterbury. For such a fate to overcome Pius IX, to whom Manning felt an intense personal loyalty, was unthinkable. The subject of Caesarism evoked from his pen, for the remainder of his life, some of his most powerful invective, directed against Piedmont, the Paris commune, and, finally, the <i>Kulturkampf</i> of Bismarck (for example, in <span class="italic">Caesarism and Ultramontanism</span>, 1873, repr. in <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span>, vol. 2).<h2>
<a name="ArchbishopofWestminsterandcardinal"></a>Archbishop of Westminster and cardinal</h2>Wiseman died on 15 February 1865, and Manning delivered his funeral oration in accordance with the cardinal's expressed wish. He had no serious expectations that the mantle of Elijah would fall on his own shoulders. But the Westminster chapter caused great offence to the pope by placing the name of Errington, with the names of two other bishops who declined to stand, in the terna (the three nominations for the succession to the Westminster see). Pius IX therefore took the matter into his own hands, defying the advice of the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide and relying on the guidance of private prayer. So it came about that within fourteen years of his conversion Manning found himself appointed the second archbishop of Westminster. He was consecrated on 8 June 1865 at the pro-cathedral at Moorfields.<br>
<br>The expected opposition to the appointment never came, and for a while there was a closing of the ranks behind the new archbishop. Manning immediately worked for reconciliation. He offered a bishopric <i>in partibus</i> to Newman, which he declined. Thereafter, despite his private feelings expressed sometimes intemperately to Mgr Talbot, he offered a series of olive branches to the man who had once been his friend and whose support he was so anxious to obtain. He was not prepared to relent, however, on the inhibition on Catholics attending Oxford and Cambridge. In 1875 Manning persuaded <i>propaganda fide</i> not to censure Newman for certain ill-received comments in his <span class="italic">Letter to the Duke of Norfolk</span>. Putting aside his own personal feelings, Manning agreed to support the petition to Pope Leo XIII in 1879 for the bestowal of a cardinalate on Newman, unfortunately gaining discredit for what was meant to be a kindly act by his misunderstanding of Newman's reply, Manning interpreting certain ambiguous phrases as a courteous refusal of the official offer. Following Newman's death on 11 August 1890, Manning delivered his funeral oration at the Brompton Oratory nine days later, acknowledging his services to the church in a eulogy of great eloquence.<br>
<br>Manning was archbishop of Westminster for nearly twenty-seven years. He was elevated to the cardinalate himself on 29 March 1875 (cardinal-priest attached to the church of St Andrew and St Gregory on the Coelian Hill). On the death of his beloved Pius IX on 7 February 1878, Manning's name was put forward at the ensuing conclave as a possible successor, but he refused to be considered on the grounds that the political situation demanded the election of an Italian. The first years of his archiepiscopate were marked by his determination to set in motion a crisis fund to provide school accommodation for Catholic children, and he insisted that this pressing need must take priority over the building of Westminster Cathedral, as Wiseman's memorial. By the time of his death schooling had been provided for 70,000 children. With a determination reminiscent of his Anglican days, he fought a constant battle to undo the damage to denominational teaching in the Forster <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1870. He even took the unprecedented step in 1885 of publishing in every Catholic newspaper instructions to Catholic voters on the eve of a general election, in order to thwart the proposals of Joseph Chamberlain (and therefore the Liberal Party) to put an end to voluntary schools. Lord Salisbury duly appointed him in 1886 as a member of the Cross commission on elementary education.<br>
<br>Not all Manning's educational endeavours were successful, however. He appreciated that if he were to have any hope of countering the pressure on Catholics to defy the official inhibition against entry to Oxford and Cambridge, he must at least take the initial steps to establish a Catholic university as an acceptable alternative. In January 1875 the Catholic University College of Kensington began its precarious life. The Jesuits, however, failed to support it; the first rector consistently created more problems than he solved; and within seven years its effective life was over. Another of Manning's grand educational designs&#151;a project to set up a network of diocesan seminaries, on the Tridentine pattern, in order to guarantee a supply of disciplined and professionally trained priests&#151;was also short-lived. The expense proved too great, and the supply of ordinands too few.<br>
<br>Manning's devotion to the interests of the secular priesthood, on which the major burden of the pastoral office lay, led him to resent the independence of the regular clergy from episcopal control (he could not easily forgive the Society of Jesus for their refusal to support his university plans). In 1881 he, with the support of Herbert Vaughan and Bishop Clifford of Clifton, succeeded in obtaining from Leo XIII the bull <span class="italic">Romanos pontifices</span>, which laid down that in future no religious house, college, or school could be established without the prior consent of the diocesan bishop.<h2>
<a name="Papalinfallibility"></a>Papal infallibility</h2>To Manning, however, this was a minor triumph compared to the issue of the definition of papal infallibility at the Vatican Council of 1869&#150;70, within which he was to play a prominent and a highly controversial role. Against the so-called inopportunists, who feared that a time of political crisis, exacerbated by the designs of Piedmont on the remaining Papal States, was unpropitious for the raising of so sensitive an issue, Manning held precisely the opposite view (again finding himself at odds with Newman). He was determined to secure conciliar confirmation of what was practically universally accepted by Catholics, seeing such a bold assertion of ultramontanism as the most fitting riposte to the revolutionary forces threatening the church on all sides. In three successive pastorals, published as a volume entitled <span class="italic">Petri privilegium</span> in 1871, he called upon the church to unite against the evil of Caesarism. Once in Rome, where he was in his element (he spoke Italian perfectly), he took upon himself the role of chief whip of the infallibilist party, allowing fervour at times to degenerate into ruthlessness in his contriving to ensure that no member of the opposition should be allowed a place on the committee set up to draft the conciliar decree. He employed all his statesmanship, through the intermediary of Odo Russell (England's unaccredited agent in Rome), to persuade the British government and other hostile European powers not to intervene to close the proceedings of the council. On 25 May 1870 he delivered at the council one of the most powerful speeches of his life in support of the definition, lasting one hour and fifty minutes, which even his opponents conceded was a masterly performance. The final definition, in the decree <span class="italic">Pastor aeternus</span>, was actually more moderate than Manning had hoped to achieve, but he had no reservations in his defence of the definition or of the proceedings of the council when he came to respond to Gladstone's published &#145;expostulations&#146; of 1874&#150;5 against a seeming reversion to medievalism. His answer to Gladstone's attacks came in two books: <span class="italic">The Vatican Decrees and their Bearing on Civil Allegiance</span> (1875) and <span class="italic">The True Story of the Vatican Council</span> (1877).<h2>
<a name="Manningandreform"></a>Manning and reform</h2>Manning had an enduring affection and respect for Gladstone, harking back to their close friendship in the 1840s. Gladstone, on the other hand, never quite forgave his friend for abandoning the Church of England, and was constantly perplexed by Manning's change of stance from statesmanlike moderation, as an Anglican, to the extremism and inflexibility of his Catholic years. Nevertheless, intermittent and reasonably cordial relations with Gladstone had been resumed after Manning's elevation to Westminster and again, if slightly less cordial, in the years following the council, chiefly because of their common concern over the plight of Ireland. The first necessity was to secure the disestablishment of the Irish church, the established church being an intolerable affront to a largely Catholic nation. In 1868 Manning published his <span class="italic">Letter to Earl Grey</span> (repr. in <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span>, vol. 1), forcefully expounding his case, as well as identifying other iniquitous abuses&#151;the grossly inequitable land laws most of all. Gladstone had already come round to the need to tackle the issue of disestablishment without Manning's prompting, but the arguments of Manning's pamphlet were used extensively in the parliamentary debates which eventually saw disestablishment achieved in 1869. The removal of the worst abuses of the land laws, for which Manning tirelessly campaigned, was a slower process, but legislation in 1870 and 1881 gained most of what he sought. Manning felt a genuine sympathy for the Fenian cause, but never condoned the use of violence. He maintained friendly relations with both Parnell and Michael Davitt, doing his utmost to counter pressure upon the Holy See from the British government to issue a papal condemnation of the Irish Land League. Towards the end of his life he came to the reluctant conclusion that some form of home rule was inevitable.<br>
<br>Manning's sympathy for the oppressed and disadvantaged in society, already witnessed in his Anglican days, became more and more marked as he grew older. During his retreat with the Passionists at Highgate on the eve of his consecration, he pledged himself to devote all his energies on behalf of the wretched and the so-called &#145;worthless&#146; in society. He also recognized the church's obligation to protect honest labouring people against exploitation by employers. His strongest proclamation on this theme came in an address given in Leeds in 1874, published under the title <span class="italic">The Dignity and Rights of Labour</span> (repr. in <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span>, vol. 2). He had already publicly supported Joseph Arch's National Agricultural Labourers' Union, insisting that labour had a right to protect itself against exploitation and to campaign for fair wages and reasonable hours of work. He was later to declare his support for the even more radical union movement in America, the Knights of Labour. In this respect he stood virtually alone within the church in England as a pioneer of social Catholicism, although he had allies among the Catholic hierarchy abroad in men like Cardinal Gibbons, archbishop of Baltimore, and Cardinal Moran in Australia. Manning's concern was not merely Christian compassion; he vehemently believed that the rising labour movement throughout the Western world was waiting for leadership and guidance. If that genuinely sympathetic guidance was not offered by the church, then more dangerous forces, and communism in particular, would not be slow in seizing the initiative.<br>
<br>As early as 1864 Manning had warned his generation that the old order was dying (&#145;The visit of Garibaldi in England&#146; in <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span>, vol. 1). The church's place was no longer in alliance with princes, but with the common people. The role of the church in modern society was to be &#145;the Mother, Friend and Protectress of the People. As our Divine Saviour lived among persons of the people, so lives His Church&#146;  (Fitzsimon, 142). There is no doubt that Leo XIII's social encyclicals, and notably the great declaration on workers' rights in <span class="italic">Rerum novarum</span> (1891) owed much to Manning's influence. As early as 1884 his concern for social problems had been recognized at home by his appointment as a member of the royal commission on the housing of the working classes. His greatest triumph in the field of labour relations, however, was his personal intervention in the crippling London Dock strike of 1889, through his friendship with one of the dockers' leaders, Ben Tillett, and his readiness to confront the strike committee to negotiate an acceptable compromise. He was successful in breaking the deadlock, and earned for himself the enduring gratitude of the London dockers and the labour force nationwide.<br>
<br>Many of Manning's co-religionists found his radical sympathies difficult to understand. He faced fierce opposition and ridicule in his campaign to curb the evils of intemperance, believing the demon drink to be the greatest single cause of degradation and misery among the poor. He gave active support to the United Kingdom Alliance, a largely nonconformist pressure group working for legislation to control the drink trade; in 1872 he founded the League of the Cross&#151;an organization unashamedly imitating the successful techniques of the Salvation Army&#151;committed to proselytize on behalf of total abstinence. He would cheerfully share a platform with Bramwell Booth, who&#151;in return&#151;came to reverence him almost as a saint.<br>
<br>It is not surprising that Londoners grew to love Manning. He was always in their midst; and the doors of Archbishop House, an ugly barrack-like building on the corner of Carlisle Place and Francis Street, where the cardinal lived in an atmosphere of bleak austerity, were open to all comers, who rarely went away unsatisfied, because Manning was prodigal in his charity. To the end of his life, he preached two or three times every Sunday, usually choosing churches in the poorest parts of his diocese. He never took a holiday. His occasional relaxations consisted of a visit to the Athenaeum to read the papers or to take part in the rarified discussions of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/45584', "Metaphysical Society")</script>, happy to hold his own against T. H. Huxley demonstrating the spurious credentials of the Christian revelation. Sometimes, during the evening, he would relax in the company of a young Anglican friend, J. E. C. Bodley, to whom he could talk more freely than to members of his own communion.<br>
<br>Wherein lay the secret of the exceptional impact that Manning made on everyone who met him? Great personal charm, certainly, but also a remarkable physical presence. Every artist who met him wanted to sketch his portrait; everyone who encountered him tried to find the words to describe the impression, usually recalling the massive forehead, the piercing look of his eyes, and the hollow cheeks, which gave the cardinal a cadaverous look in his old age. But always, despite the frailty induced by years of austerity and self-denial, the dignity and authority were the lasting impression. As G. W. E. Russell recalled, the sight of Manning as he passed through the anteroom to his throne room to hold an audience was such that &#145;the most Protestant knee instinctively bent&#146;  (Russell, 41).<h2>
<a name="Deathandreputation"></a>Death and reputation</h2>Manning died at Archbishop House, Carlisle Place, London, on 14 January 1892, following a serious attack of bronchitis. The scenes at his funeral on 21 January and the crowds that thronged the streets for the 4 miles between the Brompton Oratory and Kensal Green cemetery (where he was buried) had no precedent, it was observed, since the death of the first duke of Wellington. Manning's body was later reinterred at Westminster Cathedral.<br>
<br>Forty years earlier, a cardinal seen in the streets of London would have been pelted with mud. The temperature of No Popery agitation within the nation at large had cooled by the closing decades of the century. To what extent this was due to Manning's personal reputation is difficult to quantify, though it was undoubtedly one among other reasons for the easing of the tension. Perhaps his vision of the role of the Catholic church in modern society has been imperfectly appreciated by his immediate posterity. He was neither Liberal nor Conservative, his political stance being most aptly expressed when he described himself as &#145;a Mosaic Radical&#146;: radical in his indignation over the exploitation of the weaker members of society; authoritative and ultramontane in his conviction that the people ask of the church strong guidance and a voice of certainty. One of his greatest services to his church also has an element of paradox in it. Unflinchingly dogmatic and a Roman of the Romans, he also gave his generation the initiative to practical ecumenism by his readiness to recognize the workings of the Holy Spirit in churches other than the &#145;one true fold&#146;. This was an argument advanced as early as 1864 in his <span class="italic">The Workings of the Holy Spirit in the Church of England</span>, though Anglicans at the time were affronted by the fact that he allowed the Church of England no higher accreditation than he accorded to dissenting churches. He believed passionately that Christians of different communions could and should learn from one another, and should be prepared to work together in endeavours of &#145;practical Christianity&#146;, as he himself demonstrated in his co-operation with nonconformists and the Salvation Army to save men's bodies as well as their souls. Finally, in the course of his archiepiscopate he taught his fellow Catholics that the time had come for them to emerge from the twilight and to show themselves as a powerful pressure group, whose interests and concerns could not be ignored. If they doubted their ability to do so, they had only to witness the example of his own life.<br>
