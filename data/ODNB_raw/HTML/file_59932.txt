<span class="headword">Johnson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Garrat; <em>other married name </em>King]</span>,  Dorothea</span>  (1732&#150;1817), <span class="occ">Methodist leader</span>, was born on 4 December 1732 in Dublin, the only daughter of John Garrat (<i>d</i>. 1765), a Dutchman who had settled in Ireland in 1707 and established a business in Dublin. Nothing is known of her mother but Dorothea was partly brought up by her paternal grandmother, whose piety contrasted with her father's irreligion. Her early education was reportedly scanty: she taught herself to write in adulthood and &#145;carefully cultivated her mind by the diligent study of useful books&#146;  (Crookshank, <span class="italic">Memorable Women</span>, 56). In appearance, she was &#145;very beautiful, a little above the average height&#146; with a &#145;fair complexion&#146; and a &#145;sweet placid smile&#146;  (ibid., 55).<br>
<br>When Dorothea was about sixteen her father's business failed. In order to save him from imprisonment she agreed to marry one of his creditors, a man named King. The couple had two children, a daughter, and a son who died in childhood, but the marriage was unhappy and after some years Dorothea left her husband and returned to live with her father.<br>
<br>On 15 December 1757 Dorothea was converted to Methodism by the Revd George Whitefield. Shortly afterwards her father followed her into the society. She soon became a prominent figure in the local congregation, taking charge of classes and bands, and achieving a reputation for charity, humility, and holiness. According to Crookshank, &#145;many women occupied a more prominent position in the Society, and displayed talents of a higher order, but none lived closer to God&#146;  (Crookshank, <span class="italic">Memorable Women</span>, 56). John Wesley, visiting Dublin in 1762, witnessed her entry into the state known by Methodists as &#145;sanctification&#146;: &#145;She had been seeking it for some time; but her convictions and desires grew stronger and stronger, as the hour approached &hellip; On the Lord's day, she felt an entire change &hellip; She now walks in sweet peace and rejoices evermore&#146;  (Smith, 47&#150;8). In 1771 she began a journal, primarily as a record of her spiritual development, which she kept intermittently for the rest of her life.<br>
<br>Dorothea's first husband died in 1774, and in 1784 she married John Johnson, a Methodist preacher, and moved with him to Lisburn, co. Antrim. Adam Averell, visiting the Johnsons there some years later, saw them as a pattern of married life: &#145;This couple have never had a dispute, nor the slightest difference to settle. O religion! What a treasure! &hellip; If all our friends possessed the invaluable secret of living as they do, what a heaven it would bring upon earth&#146;  (Stewart and Revington, 185). In Lisburn Dorothea worked alongside her husband to promote Methodism, taking particular responsibility for female members of the society. Her efforts were instrumental in the expansion of Methodism in the district: in 1785 John Wesley noted the liveliness of the society in Lisburn, &#145;owing chiefly to the good providence of God in bringing Mrs Johnson hither&#146;  (Crookshank, <span class="italic">History of Methodism</span>, 1.402).<br>
<br>John Johnson died in 1803 but Dorothea maintained her involvement in the affairs of the Lisburn congregation, leading groups in study and worship and corresponding with believers on spiritual matters. The final entry in her journal, dated 19 January 1817, is a catalogue of blessings received and a reiteration of faith:<blockquote>He gives me peace in my family, protection from the wicked, a great measure of health, a competency of this world's treasure, and &hellip; a constant witness of His indwelling spirit, that I am His child. I feel no inward corruption, and I have strong confidence that He will, through the blood and righteousness of my Redeemer, bring me where He is, His hand graciously holding me up in death. (Johnson, 78)</blockquote>Dorothea Johnson died of typhus fever in Lisburn on 23 July 1817. Her <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, including extracts from her journal and correspondence, and a number of short poems on religious themes, were edited by the Revd Adam Averell and published in 1818.<br>
