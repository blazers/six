<span class="headword">Moluag</span> <span class="st"> [St Moluag]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 592), <span class="occ">missionary and holy man</span>, was reportedly Irish in origin&#151;his name is a hypocoristic form of the Irish name Lugaid, meaning &#145;my Lugaid&#146;. The principal source for the traditions surrounding his life is an office for him in the Aberdeen breviary, with proper antiphons and responsories and six lessons, but no proper hymns. The antiphons and responsories add little information to what is given in the lessons, but they may allude to an incident from his <i>vita</i> that the latter do not mention: a thief stole books from the saint's church, and was struck down, blinded, and wounded, but was then healed by Moluag, whose devoted servant he became. The lessons in the breviary associate Moluag with St Brendan, presumably of Clonfert, with Lismore in Argyll, with the monastery of Melrose, and with the church of Rosemarkie in Ross. They also claim that he visited &#145;Thule&#146;. This may derive from a tradition that Gaelic monks had been active in the northern isles, but on the other hand may simply refer to the outer isles&#151;Teampull Mholuaigh is at Eoropie near the Butt of Lewis. The twelfth-century life of St Flannan alludes to Moluag's visit to the Hebrides and Orkneys.<br>
<br>Moluag has a number of place names and dedications throughout Scotland, primarily in the west and north. As well as at Lismore and Rosemarkie, he is found in Raasay, Tiree, Trotternish in Skye, Treshnish in Mull, Kilberry in Knapdale, Ballagan on Loch Ness, Strathpeffer, Tarlan in Aberdeenshire, several places in Strathspey, Alyth, and near Renfrew. Most of his dedications are in the Western Isles, Easter Ross, and between Dee and Spey. Later stories of his rivalry with Columba of Iona are without historical foundation.<br>
<br>The chief centre of Moluag's cult was the church on the isle of Lismore in the Firth of Lorn, which became the cathedral church of the diocese of Argyll during the 1180s. Its choir has been restored and remains in use as the island's parish kirk, though the heights of the roof and floor have been altered and the pulpit and communion table are now at the west end. Medieval doorways and buttresses are still visible externally, and inside there are two medieval doorways and the original sedilia and piscina. To the west of the church are the foundations of a substantial aisle-less nave and small western tower.<br>
<br>According to the office in the Aberdeen breviary Moluag had journeyed across the sea from the north of Ireland to Lismore on a stone, &#145;quite unlike the rest of the rocks of that island&#146;, which was presumably visible at &#145;the port of the church of Lismore&#146;&#151;probably Ardnacroish  (<span class="italic">Breviarium Aberdonense</span>, fol. vi<i>v</i>). The same office mentions several relics of the saint, most notably his square iron bell, which had been miraculously forged while he was a pupil of St Brendan. It has been identified in some quarters with a bell found at Kilmichael Glassary, Argyll, in the nineteenth century. Another relic is the wooden <i>bachall m&ograve;r</i>, allegedly the saint's pastoral staff, which remains in the keeping of the chief of the Livingstone family, but which is not mentioned in medieval sources.<br>
<br>According to the Irish martyrologies Moluag died on 25 June, in a year identified by the annals as 592. Lismore did not claim to have his body, for he is said to have gone to Ross, where he died and was buried at Rosemarkie. His connection with Rosemarkie is problematic, however, for its reputed founder was alive in 697. Equally uncertain are his associations with Melrose, which was founded after 632. His office refers to Moluag as dealing with its abbot, described as a very famous man of strict religion, but does not name him. The local secular ruler, presumably of Lorn, is likewise mentioned but not named. The evidence suggests a complex set of associations linking Lismore with the churches of Clonfert, Melrose, and Rosemarkie, but the factors behind them cannot now be determined. In a similar way, later writings and legends make large claims for Moluag's importance in the spread of Christianity in northern Scotland, but substantive evidence in support of them remains tantalizingly scarce.<br>
