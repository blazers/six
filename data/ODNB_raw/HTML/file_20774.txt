<span class="headword">&Oacute; N&eacute;ill,  Aodh</span> <span class="st"> [Hugh O'Neill, Aodh M&eacute;ith]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1230), <span class="occ">king of T&iacute;r Eoghain</span>, was the son of &Aacute;ed an Macaem T&oacute;inlesc 
    (the &#145;Lazy-Rumped Lad&#146;; <i>d</i>. 1177)
  , who is said to have earned his unusual sobriquet by refusing to rise respectfully to greet his rival kinsman, the high-king Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn (<i>d</i>. 1166). The accession of Ruaidri &Oacute; Conchobair (<i>d</i>. 1198) to the high-kingship of Ireland in 1166 weakened the Mac Lochlainn family, and &Aacute;ed an Macaem T&oacute;inlesc &Oacute; N&eacute;ill shared the kingship of T&iacute;r Eoghain with a Mac Lochlainn in 1167&#150;9, enjoyed a brief spell in sole power <i>c</i>.1170&#150;1174, but was deposed before his death, which took place in the same year as the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ulster under John de Courcy.<br>
<br>Aodh M&eacute;ith (the epithet means &#145;the Fat&#146;) is first recorded in 1199 leading a fleet of five ships to harry the Larne district of Antrim in retaliation for a raid by Courcy on Derry and Inishowen. His successful wars against T&iacute;r Conaill (the Donegal area) and &Oacute; hEignigh of Fermanagh that year show &Oacute; N&eacute;ill leading men from Inishowen and Mag &Iacute;otha, or the west bank of the Foyle, traditional homelands of the Mac Lochlainn family. Perhaps it was after this campaign that he married Bean Midhe (<i>d</i>. 1215), the daughter of &Oacute; hEignigh. In 1200&#150;01 &Oacute; N&eacute;ill repelled a series of Anglo-Norman raids on southern T&iacute;r Eoghain, then joined &Oacute; hEignigh on an expedition into Connacht, to support Cathal Croibhdhearg &Oacute; Conchobhair (<i>d</i>. 1224) against Cathal Carrach &Oacute; Conchobhair and William de Burgh (<i>d</i>. 1206). The annals say the northern Irish were taken unawares by the presence of Anglo-Normans in Cathal Carrach's army and were withdrawing when they were overtaken and defeated, &Oacute; hEignigh being killed and &Oacute; N&eacute;ill forced to submit and give hostages. On his return home &Oacute; N&eacute;ill was briefly deposed in favour of Conchobhar Beag Mac Lochlainn, who was, however, slain the same year when &Eacute;igneach&aacute;n, the first &Oacute; Domhnaill king of T&iacute;r Conaill (<i>d</i>. 1208), raided Inishowen.<br>
<br>After some years' struggle against both Mac Lochlainn and &Oacute; Domhnaill claims on Derry and Inishowen, &Oacute; N&eacute;ill concluded a truce <i>c</i>.1208&#150;9 with Domhnall M&oacute;r &Oacute; Domhnaill (<i>d</i>. 1241) which the four masters call &#145;an alliance against such of the English or Irish as should oppose them&#146;. Meanwhile John de Courcy, deposed from the lordship of Ulster in 1205, sought refuge in T&iacute;r Eoghain, drawing down punitive raids in 1207 from his successor, Earl Hugh de Lacy (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1243), who failed to exact submission or hostages from &Oacute; N&eacute;ill. Aodh M&eacute;ith also refused hostages when he met King John at the siege of Carrickfergus in 1210, during that monarch's expedition to Ireland to expel the rebellious Lacy. However, after the English king departed, his officials exacted a fine of 293 cows from &Oacute; N&eacute;ill and 321 cows as rent for T&iacute;r Eoghain, the earldom of Ulster being now in the king's hands. The northern coastline was granted away to King John's Scottish allies, Alan Fitzroland and Thomas of Galloway, who mounted a series of raids and built a castle at Coleraine, while the justiciar, Bishop John de Gray of Norwich, built three castles along &Oacute; N&eacute;ill's southern borders at Belleek, Clones, and Newry, all of which Aodh M&eacute;ith destroyed in 1213&#150;14, with the assistance of the other Ulster chiefs. He burnt the town of Carlingford in 1214 and raided the Anglo-Normans of eastern Ulster the following year.<br>
<br>The English chancery addressed &Oacute; N&eacute;ill as one among many Irish vassal kings in a circular letter of 1221, but he soon defied the Anglo-Irish government again, in support of the dispossessed Hugh de Lacy, destroying the castle of Coleraine in 1222 and blocking William (II) Marshal's attempt to enter Ulster with the royal army in 1224. He made destructive king-making expeditions into Connacht in 1225 and 1226, with only temporary success, though he did exact hostages from T&iacute;r Conaill on the same campaign. To the surprise of the annalist, this warlike chief died a natural death in 1230, leaving his son Domhnall (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1235), ancestor of the Clann Aodha Buidhe, or Clandeboye O'Neills, to dispute his kingship with Domhnall Mac Lochlainn (<i>d</i>. 1241).<br>
