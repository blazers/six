<span class="headword">Winstone,  James</span>  (1863&#150;1921), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 9 February 1863 at Waunfawr, Machen Lower, near Risca, Monmouthshire, the son of William Winstone, master mason, and his wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Edmunds, whose previous married name was Wilton. His father died young and, at the age of eight, Winstone left school to work at a brickworks to support his widowed mother. He then became a colliery boy at Risca united colliery, where he worked for fourteen years. He gained a reputation as a trade union militant and had to leave the colliery for a time before returning as a checkweighman. On 15 May 1886 he married Sarah Jane Ivin 
    (or Iven; <i>b</i>. 1862/3)
  , the daughter of Richard Ivin, a foundry labourer. They had seven children, two of whom died in infancy.<br>
<br>Winstone worked with William Brace and others in fighting the sliding-scale wage system operating in the Welsh coalfield since the mid-1870s, and became agent for the eastern valleys district in 1891. He was a founder of the South Wales Miners' Federation (SWMF), created after the momentous six months' coal stoppage in 1898, and became executive member for the Tredegar district. About this time he joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP). He was an active Baptist and strong supporter of the temperance movement. He was elected a member of Abersychan district council, becoming chairman in 1911, and from 1906 was also a member of Monmouthshire county council. Apart from being active in local government, he stood for parliament in the general election of 1906 as candidate for Monmouth Boroughs. He polled well in the docks areas of Newport among Irish electors, but finished third, well behind the Liberals.<br>
<br>In the early years of the SWMF, Winstone was always associated with men like Vernon Hartshorn, George Barker, and C. B. Stanton, who sought to reform and radicalize the federation executive and make it far more aggressive in fighting the coal owners. Winstone himself denounced the conciliation board and declared that any reconciliation of capitalism with labour was &#145;an impossibility&#146;. He was prominent in the turbulent history of the rapidly expanding Welsh coalfield in the years from 1906 onwards, with the riots at Tonypandy, battles over an eight-hour day and wage payments in &#145;abnormal places&#146;, and the strike for a national minimum wage for miners in 1912. He was also active in promoting the Central Labour College as a breakaway from Ruskin College, and became president of the Plebs League formed by Noah Ablett and others to promote class-conscious workers' education in the coalfield.<br>
<br>In 1912 Winstone succeeded William Brace as vice-president of the SWMF after the latter had replaced the aged William Abraham (Mabon) as president. At the same time Winstone, unlike others on the radical wing, sought to retain contacts with the Labour Party rather than proceed along the syndicalist path advocated in the Unofficial Reform Committee's pamphlet <span class="italic">The Miners' Next Step</span>. When war broke out in August 1914, he was in a powerful position on the SWMF, and even more so in June 1915 when he followed William Brace as acting president of the federation. He thus led the remarkable wartime strike by the Welsh miners in July 1915 on behalf of a new, higher standard wage rate. Despite the scandalized outcry from critics, the federation forced Lloyd George to visit Cardiff to negotiate, and the outcome was a standard rate for miners of 3<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. a day plus 50 per cent.<br>
<br>On the other hand, unlike Ablett and others on the far left, Winstone supported British participation in the war and took part in recruiting campaigns; a son of his served in the army in France. A momentous episode came in November 1915 when Keir Hardie, MP for Merthyr, died. After much local conflict, Winstone was nominated official Labour candidate by the local Labour Representation Committee. But he was then opposed, on a &#145;patriotic labour&#146; basis, by the erstwhile radical, C. B. Stanton, the miners' agent for Aberd&acirc;r. Since Winstone vehemently opposed conscription, the by-election became a touchstone for the workers' view of the war. It was an angry contest; visiting ILP speakers such as Ramsay MacDonald were denounced as &#145;pro-German&#146;. At one time Winstone appeared to challenge the aggressive Stanton to a bare-knuckle fight. But in the end Stanton defeated Winstone comfortably by over 4000 votes.<br>
<br>Winstone lost again in Merthyr, much more narrowly this time, to a Lloyd George Liberal, in the &#145;coupon&#146; general election of December 1918, when opponents attacked him as a pacifist and a Bolshevik. He remained a powerful force in mining unionism, serving as a south Wales representative on the Miners' Federation of Great Britain executive from 1915 to 1918 and from 1920 to 1921, while in 1920 he succeeded Brace as president of the SWMF. He gave evidence before the Sankey commission in 1919, advocating state ownership of the mines, and also campaigned for British forces to be removed from Ireland and the Soviet Union. In local community affairs, he served as chairman of Monmouthshire county council in 1920, was a member of the Pontypool board of guardians for a time, a magistrate, and a governor of the University of Wales. He was heavily embroiled in the post-war economic downturn in the coalfield and the inter-union tensions leading to the collapse of a proposed general strike on &#145;Black Friday&#146;, 15 April 1921, but then he fell ill. After an operation, he died of appendicitis at 20 Endsleigh Gardens, St Pancras, London, on 27 July 1921. It was recorded that 25,000 attended his funeral and that he left barely &pound;250.<br>
<br>Winstone was a remarkable and selfless workers' leader during the industrial turmoil in the Welsh coalfield between the 1890s and the 1920s. He was a passionate man, without perhaps the tactical shrewdness of others such as Vernon Hartshorn. But both in industrial relations and in local government he could harness socialist idealism to constructive reform, as in his advocacy of municipal housing. In their era of greatness, James Winstone was not the least of the Welsh miners' leaders.<br>
