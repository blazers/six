<span class="headword">Emden,  Alfred Brotherston</span>  (1888&#150;1979), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 22 October 1888 in West Ealing, Middlesex, the elder son of Alfred Charles Emden (1849&#150;1911), barrister and later county court judge, and his wife, Lizzie Whitfield (<i>d</i>. 1955). He was a scholar at both the King's School, Canterbury (1903&#150;7), and Lincoln College, Oxford (1907&#150;11), though he obtained only a second class in modern history (1911).<br>
<br>His future career then seemed uncertain: he qualified for the bar at the Inner Temple, ran a hostel in London for disadvantaged boys, Edghill House, Sydenham (1913&#150;15), and then began schoolmastering at Strand School, Brixton, London. The war intervened, and from 1915 he was an able seaman (Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve) in a destroyer leader, HMS <i>Parker</i>. In January 1919, while still an able seaman, he accepted an almost chance offer of a tutorship in modern history at St Edmund Hall, Oxford. He was appointed bursar in the same year and vice-principal in 1920.<br>
<br>Emden now immersed himself in university life and history, and remained at St Edmund Hall for the next thirty years. In 1920 he published his first article, on the hall's history, in the first issue of its magazine, which he had launched, and in 1927 he produced a pioneering, scholarly study, <span class="italic">An Oxford Hall in Medieval Times</span>. Two years later he was appointed principal of the hall. It was then a small society, unendowed but relatively inexpensive for undergraduates; its principal had virtually complete control over it, choosing both undergraduates and tutors. Emden entered his role with infectious enthusiasm, increasing the number of students and greatly enhancing the hall's prestige in the university. He successfully ran it as what he wished it to remain, the last of the medieval halls; he never wanted it to have full collegiate status. In 1937 the reorganization of the hall's constitution was in some respects amended by congregation before it was enacted by a statute of the university. Another statute made special trustee arrangements for the site and the buildings, the freehold of which had belonged to Queen's College since 1557. However, an uneasy relationship with the tutors (now called fellows) subsequently developed. An enlightened paternalist, he was happier in his relations with the students and shaped the careers of many of them. Until 1939 he continued to teach medieval history, giving tutorials that often lasted for a couple of hours. He was also responsible for the restoration of the hall's old buildings, the near-completion of the south side of its quadrangle in 1934, and the beginnings of an endowment.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Emden remained in charge of St Edmund Hall, while also being lieutenant-commander in charge of the Oxford University naval division (1942&#150;4): he had persuaded a reluctant Admiralty to raise such divisions in several universities. He was, besides, still very active in public school and Church of England affairs, being much consulted over appointments. The strain of all this told, especially when he did such things as going on a submarine foray to the Bay of Biscay while the French coast was still in German hands. His health broke down, and in 1951 he resigned the principalship, going to live with his mother in Headington.<br>
<br>Emden was now sixty-two. He had already written one book, and revised another&#151;H. Rashdall's <span class="italic">Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages</span>, edited with F. M. Powicke, in 1936&#151;but it is on the prosopographical works of his years of retirement that his scholarly reputation depends. Combing the collegiate and university records of Oxford, and going through all the medieval episcopal registers, as well as a vast range of other English sources, he compiled three substantial volumes of <span class="italic">A Biographical Register of the University of Oxford to <span class="smallcap">A.D.</span> 1500</span> (1957&#150;9). He made such thorough notes that it was then no great labour to produce a similar <span class="italic">Biographical Register</span> for Cambridge (1963)&#151;in 1958 he estimated that such a work could be completed within eighteen months&#151;and a more summary <span class="italic">Survey of Dominicans in England, based on the ordination lists in episcopal registers (1268&#150;1538)</span> (1967). He forestalled any criticism of the supplementary <span class="italic">Biographical Register of the University of Oxford, <span class="smallcap">A.D.</span> 1501 to 1540</span> (1974) by the comment that &#145;octogenarians, like young men, are apt to be in a hurry&#146;.<br>
<br>Emden was unconcerned that his chosen areas of research were not then fashionable. He had a gift for friendship, and a wide range of acquaintances, but his close friends were few and in his later years were drawn from a small circle who shared his interest in the lives and books of medieval scholars. His lifestyle was comfortable but simple; he had strong Christian convictions. His manner was normally gracious and unperturbed, although he was a man of powerful emotions and could on occasion explode violently. He delighted in the careful observation of birds, wild flowers and grasses, and medieval floor tiles.<br>
<br>He was elected an honorary fellow of Lincoln College (1939) and of St Edmund Hall (1951), FBA (1959), FSA (1969), and corresponding fellow of the Medieval Academy of America (1968); he received honorary doctorates from both Oxford (1959) and Cambridge (1964). He was a trustee of the Oxford Preservation Trust (1932&#150;67), and he served on the governing bodies of the King's School, Canterbury (1933&#150;62), St Edward's School, Oxford (1933&#150;57), and two other schools, while he was a member of Oxford University's hebdomadal council from 1935 to 1947. He died at his home, Dunstan Cottage, Old Headington, Oxford, on 8 January 1979, a bachelor. His ashes were buried in the ante-chapel at St Edmund Hall. The bulk of his estate, over &pound;400,000, was left to St Edmund Hall.<br>
