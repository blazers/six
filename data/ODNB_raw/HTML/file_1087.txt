<span class="headword">Bainbrigge, Sir  Philip</span>  (1786&#150;1862), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was descended from an ancient family long resident in Leicestershire and Derbyshire. He was the eldest son of Lieutenant-Colonel Philip Bainbrigge, of Ashbourne, Derbyshire, and Rachel, daughter of Peter Dobree of Beauregard, Guernsey, and was born in London. He entered the navy aged thirteen as a midshipman in the <i>Caesar</i>, under Admiral Sir James Saumarez, in 1799, but left because of ill health. His father, who served under the duke of York in the expedition to the Netherlands, was killed in the attack on Egmont op Zoom on 2 October 1799, and the next year the duke appointed young Bainbrigge to an ensigncy in the 20th regiment.<br>
<br>On 13 November 1800 Bainbrigge became a lieutenant, but being then only fourteen years of age, he obtained a year's leave, which he spent at Green's military academy at Deptford, and joined his regiment at Malta in 1801. At the peace of Amiens his regiment was reduced and he was placed on half pay, but was brought on full pay into the 7th fusiliers. After returning to England in 1803, he was employed in obtaining volunteers from the militia to form the 2nd battalion of the 7th, which when completed was moved to Colchester. Here the troops were reviewed by the duke of York, and Bainbrigge, who had come to notice by his zeal and diligence, was gazetted, on 17 October 1805, to a company in the 18th Royal Irish, and joined the 1st battalion in the West Indies. After the taking of Cura&ccedil;ao from the Dutch in 1807, he was appointed inspector of fortifications there, and made plans of the forts and defences, which subsequently recommended him to the authorities at the Horse Guards.<br>
<br>Bainbrigge transferred into the 93rd, and, on returning to England, laid his plans and surveys before the duke of York, who advised him to qualify himself for the staff by studying at the senior department of the Royal Military College at High Wycombe. He entered the college in 1809, and studied so diligently that in a year and a half he passed his examination with distinction. While there he invented a protracting pocket sextant, which was favourably noticed by the board of examiners, and enabled him to make surveys with remarkable accuracy and rapidity.<br>
<br>On leaving the college Bainbrigge was appointed deputy assistant quartermaster-general in the British army in Portugal. On arriving at Wellington's headquarters he was posted to the 4th division, commanded by Major-General Cole, and stationed near Torres Vedras. He was then brought to headquarters, where for some time he was employed in sketching ground and reporting on positions, thereby risking capture by the enemy who occupied the country. His aptitude was acknowledged, for in a letter to Marshal Beresford, dated Cartaxo, 4 January 1811, Wellington said he was appointed to the staff of the army because of the ability he showed at High Wycombe.<br>
<br>Bainbrigge was present at the sieges and storming of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz. As soon as Badajoz was taken he was ordered to join the 6th division, under Sir Henry Clinton, at Albuera, and take charge of the quartermaster-general's department. On the advance of the army into Spain in 1812, Bainbrigge, who had examined the country which was to become the scene of operations, was brought to headquarters. He was present at the siege of the forts of Salamanca, at the actions of Costillegos and Costrejon, and at the crossing of the Guarena, his duties being to carry orders and make sketches of the country and positions, an important but risky role. On one occasion he was ordered to conduct a column of the army, at Pareda, through difficult country and in face of the enemy to Vallesa. He did so successfully, and brought the column in the middle of the night safely to its destination. On the day of the battle of Salamanca he was constantly with Wellington, and at a critical moment he carried the order for the advance of General Leith's division.<br>
<br>After this decisive victory Bainbrigge accompanied the army in the advance to Madrid, and from there to Valladolid and Burgos. He was present at part of the siege of Burgos, and soon after was appointed permanent assistant quartermaster-general with the rank of major. In the retreat from Burgos he rendered important services through his knowledge of the country, which was considered of so much value that Sir Henry Clinton asked for his return to the 6th division, but it was decided that he should remain at headquarters. Bainbrigge held the same position until the end of the war in 1814, and surveyed and sketched the country through which the army passed before entering France. He was present at the battles of Vitoria and Pyrenees, at the last siege of San Sebastian, and at the battles of Nive and Toulouse. He received no honours, and through some strange omission was not recommended for brevet rank, but on 21 January 1817 this was rectified, and he was promoted to the brevet rank of lieutenant-colonel.<br>
<br>In 1815 Bainbrigge applied for employment abroad, and joined the British army in its advance to Paris. He married in 1816 the eldest daughter of Joseph Fletcher; they had at least two sons. When he returned home after the peace, he continued to hold the appointment of permanent assistant quartermaster-general until 1841, when he was made deputy quartermaster-general in Dublin. Having attained the rank of major-general, 9 November 1846, he was appointed by Wellington to the command of the Belfast district. In 1852 the duke selected him to command the forces in Ceylon. There his exertions for the welfare of the troops under his command made him popular and widely respected, and his departure, when promoted lieutenant-general on 20 June 1854, was much regretted.<br>
<br>In 1838 Bainbrigge was made a CB, and subsequently received the &#145;grant for distinguished service&#146;. On 31 March 1854 he was appointed colonel of the 26th regiment (Cameronians), and in May 1860 was created KCB.<br>
<br>In his military career Bainbrigge showed the advantage of scientific knowledge, and much of his success was a result of his diligent application of this knowledge in the field; he was greatly valued as an officer. He died at St Margaret's, near Titchfield, Hampshire, on 20 December 1862, at the age of seventy-six.<br>
