<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Parsons,  Ian Macnaghten</span>  (1906&#150;1980), <span class="occ">publisher and anthologist</span>, was born on 21 May 1906 at 28 Pont Street, Chelsea, London, the only son of Edward Perceval Parsons, a stockbroker, and his wife, Mabel Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Macnaghten. After prep school he went to Winchester College; a contemporary remembered him as &#145;an unbelievably handsome &hellip; and godlike figure &hellip; with his golden hair haloed by his straw boater with its blue-black-blue ribbon&#146;  (R. W. David, memorial address). In 1925 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, as a pensioner (commoner). Two years later he became a senior scholar on the strength of a first in English. This was the last year English was not on offer as part three of the tripos. In his third year Parsons read psychology, which did not carry a class mark. His first, in English part two, stood as his final class. Parsons was one of the Cambridge &#145;guinea pigs&#146; who attended I. A. Richards's sessions on practical criticism. He edited the <span class="italic">Cambridge Review</span> and published some of F. R. Leavis's earliest criticism, as well as poetry by his contemporaries, who included Richards's pupil William Empson.<br>
<br>In 1928 Parsons found employment with the publishers Chatto and Windus as a typographer. Two years later Harold Raymond, the chairman, appointed Parsons as a junior partner. In that year Parsons also made his d&eacute;but as an author with <span class="italic">Shades of Albany</span>, a slim illustrated volume he described as &#145;a facetious phantasy&#146; inspired by the chambers in Piccadilly.<br>
<br>The young writer&#150;publisher was now in a position to bring the work of his Cambridge contemporaries to the attention of the world at large. Empson's <span class="italic">Seven Types of Ambiguity</span> (1930), Leavis's <span class="italic">New Bearings in English Poetry: a Study of the Contemporary Situation</span>, and his wife Q. D. Leavis's <span class="italic">Fiction and the Reading Public</span> (both in 1932) were the first of a steady stream of critical books published by Chatto under Parsons's aegis from the 1930s to the 1970s.<br>
<br>Parsons suffered a misfortune over publication of <span class="italic">Ultramarine</span>, the first novel by the writer Malcolm Lowry, a Cambridge contemporary. After it had been appraised by Oliver Warner, the firm's reader in succession to Frank Swinnerton, and given to Parsons, the typescript was stolen from a suitcase he left unattended on the seat of &#145;an old open 3 litre Bentley of which in my salad days I was the proud possessor&#146;, as Parsons later explained  (<span class="italic">TLS</span>). Lowry had no carbon copy and after he had painfully reconstructed the text from a draft he defected to Jonathan Cape. The 3 litre Bentley was often pointed towards the Lake District and Scotland during Parsons's holiday periods. Though bookish he was also vigorously athletic; off duty he enjoyed long walks and climbs. He once visited Lapland simply &#145;in order to get away from civilisation, to get right away to an obscure part of the world where there's no chance whatever of running into anybody you've ever met before&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Listener</span>, 28 March 1934).<br>
<br>Parsons managed to find time to review and lecture as well as publish. He took classes at the Working Men's College and was part of the team of broadcasters who in the BBC's early days reviewed new books for the Home Service. Parsons's talks, reprinted in <span class="italic">The Listener</span> in the first quarter of 1934, reveal his wide-ranging literary inquisitiveness. However serendipitous he was as a reviewer, Parsons always remained faithful to poetry, his first literary love, and to his aim of making it more accessible to the general reader. He began with <span class="italic">The Poet's Corner</span> (1930), a collection of what he considered to be &#145;the hundred most popular poets in English&#146;; in 1936 came <span class="italic">The Progress of Poetry: an Anthology of Verse from Hardy to the Present</span>, which included poems by Eliot, Auden, Day-Lewis, Spender, MacNeice, and Empson. Parsons was an excellent reciter of poetry as well as an accomplished after-dinner speaker.<br>
<br>On 30 August 1934 Parsons married Marjorie Tulip Brooker, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ritchie (<i>b</i>. 1902), known as Trekkie, an artist who had done illustrative work for the Hogarth Press. They lived in Victoria Square, Belgravia.<br>
<br>Parsons worked closely with Norah Smallwood on <span class="italic">Night and Day</span>, a weekly magazine of which he was managing director and Graham Greene the editor. Parsons and Smallwood hoped the magazine would prove to be a British rival to the <span class="italic">New Yorker</span>. It was launched by Chatto on 1 July 1937 but lasted only six months, undone by a libel action involving Greene's review of Shirley Temple's film <span class="italic">Wee Willie Winkie</span>.<br>
<br>In 1939 when war broke out both Parsons and Trekkie joined the Auxiliary Fire Service and in 1940 Parsons took a commission in the Royal Air Force volunteer reserve. Although at thirty-four he was declared too old for flying duty, he served in intelligence in France with the British expeditionary force until Dunkirk; and then after D-day with Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force. On demobilization he held the rank of wing commander and was awarded the OBE.<br>
<br>Back in civilian life in 1945 Parsons returned to Chatto. In 1946 Chatto took over the Hogarth Press. Leonard Woolf retained his editorial sovereignty but financial control of the imprint remained with Chatto. Their combined lists represented much that was most significant in modern literature. From the Hogarth stable came Virginia Woolf, Vita Sackville-West, Henry Green, and Christopher Isherwood; and from Chatto, Aldous Huxley, Julian Huxley, Richard Hughes, Compton Mackenzie, V. S. Pritchett, Rosamond Lehmann, T. F. Powys, Sylvia Townsend Warner&#151;to mention only some of the most eminent names.<br>
<br>Parsons had originally met the Woolfs in 1935 when he approached them for permission to reprint some of Virginia's novels in the <span class="roman">Phoenix Library</span>, pocket editions published by Chatto. That had come to nothing but in 1942, after he had been bombed out of Mecklenburgh Square, Leonard came to live next door to the Parsons in Victoria Square and a friendship ripened between the three of them. The Parsons' marriage became complicated by a growing intimacy between Leonard and Trekkie. Trekkie divided her time between Monk's House (Woolf's weekend house in Rodmell, Sussex) and the Parsons' home of Juggs Corner in Kingston, near Lewes, and went on visits abroad with Leonard. Parsons accepted the situation without demur or fuss, not allowing it to interfere with his and Woolf's business interests. An unpublished letter from Parsons to Woolf asks Leonard to remit half of the cost of a winter coat they had agreed jointly to give Trekkie as a present.<br>
<br>In 1953 Chatto became a limited company. In 1954 Raymond retired and Parsons took over as chairman. Under his guidance the company extended its reputation as an imprint notable for publishing works of contemporary literature. Fiction and biography were keenly cultivated, while Parsons's work as a promoter of poetry continued with his <span class="italic">Poetry for Pleasure</span> anthology, eight volumes published between 1952 and 1956; <span class="italic">Men who March Away</span>, a pioneering collection of First World War poetry to which he wrote an introduction in 1965; and his important edition of <span class="italic">The Collected Works of Isaac Rosenberg</span> (1979).<br>
<br>Of the post-war generation of authors published by Parsons the most prolific was Iris Murdoch, whose first novel, <span class="italic">Under the Net</span>, was brought out by Chatto to great acclaim in 1954. In the field of translation the major contribution came from the works of Freud: the Hogarth Press had begun this before the war, and the work of Alix and James Strachey was now completed by Angela Richard. Likewise Parsons inherited translations of Stendhal and of Proust by Scott Moncrieff. The Proust volumes were reissued with illustrations by Philippe Jullian, and the cult received a further boost from George D. Painter's two-volume life of Proust in 1959 and 1965, a landmark in modern literary biography.<br>
<br>If Parsons did not personally engineer the boom in books about Bloomsbury, he proved to be its ideal impresario. <span class="italic">A Writer's Diary</span>, a one-volume edition of Virginia Woolf's journals edited by Leonard, appeared as the curtain-raiser in 1953. The publication of Leonard's own autobiography in five volumes from 1960 to 1969, revealing much that was new about his wife's state of health, whetted the public's appetite for still more. This was satisfied for a while by the publication of Quentin Bell's life of Virginia Woolf (his aunt) in 1972. In 1977 came <span class="italic">A Marriage of True Minds: an Intimate Portrait of Leonard and Virginia Woolf</span>, which Parsons wrote with George Spater, the American Woolf scholar.<br>
<br>Resources were now in place to publish Virginia's letters and diaries in full, something that Leonard had initially resisted. The mammoth task, edited by Anne Oliver Bell (Quentin Bell's wife), Nigel Nicolson, and others, was carried out in sets of six and five volumes respectively, throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. The outspoken candour of Virginia's comments on her friends sometimes shocked Parsons. On reading the typescript of one early volume he strongly objected to including some disparaging remarks about Raymond Mortimer which he felt would prejudice the book's being reviewed in the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>. The editors appealed to Mortimer himself who said that the remarks were &#145;Virginia's truth&#146; and should be printed exactly as they stood&#151;and they were.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Parsons became president of the Publishers' Association (1957&#150;9) and a staunch upholder of the net book agreement, which was already under threat. Conditions became more and more difficult throughout the 1960s for an independent publishing company of Chatto's limited financial base to stand on its own, and in 1969 Chatto merged with Jonathan Cape. In 1972 Parsons defended Helen Bannerman's <span class="italic">Little Black Sambo</span>, which came under attack for its alleged racism. A pressure group, Teachers Against Racism, were urging that it should be withdrawn from circulation. This was one battle that Parsons lost. When the Bodley Head became part of Chatto in 1973, Parsons was made joint chairman. He retired in 1975 and was succeeded by Smallwood. Parsons also held directorships with the Edinburgh printers Hunter and Foulis, the Reprint Society, the Scottish Academic Press, and the Sussex University Press. He was made a CBE in 1971 and court assistant to the Stationers' and Newspaper Makers' Company in 1977.<br>
<br>Outside his work Parsons led a full social life, hosting many convivial gatherings at Juggs Corner. He was a popular member of the Garrick and the Beefsteak clubs. He gardened when in Sussex, took a keen interest in sport, especially rugby and cricket as a member of the MCC. He died at his home in Kingston near Lewes, Sussex, on 29 October 1980.<br>
