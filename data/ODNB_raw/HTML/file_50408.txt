<span class="headword">Calder, Sir  James Charles</span>  (1869&#150;1962), <span class="occ">distiller</span>, was born on 28 December 1869 in Alloa, Scotland, the younger son of James Calder, a timber merchant and brewer, and his wife, Cecilia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mackenzie, the daughter of an Edinburgh market gardener. Calder was educated at Perth Academy and St Benedict's College, Fort Augustus. In 1886 he joined his father's brewing business and in 1889 he was appointed manager of Bo'ness distillery, purchased by his father in 1873 from A. and J. Vannan. Originally a pot still (malt whisky) distillery, it was enlarged and converted (in 1876) to a patent still (grain whisky) distillery with an output of 870,000 gallons. In conjunction with Glenfoyle distillery, acquired by his father in 1880, this allowed the family's interests to straddle malt and grain whisky. Bo'ness also made yeast and Calder increased production and built up a sizeable business through Calder's Yeast Company as yeast proved an important source of revenue following the collapse of the grain distillers' cartel (the United Kingdom Distillers' Association) in 1888. Calder was made a partner in James Calder &amp; Co. in 1890 and a director when the firm adopted limited liability status in 1892.<br>
<br>Calder's main interest was in blended whisky (mixtures of malt and grain whiskies) where demand was expanding rapidly. Distillers sought access to this fast growing trade while blenders sought security of supply, and in 1895 James Calder became a partner in the Leith blending firm of Alexander and MacDonald. In the boom of the 1890s Alexander and MacDonald built a pot still distillery, Stronachie distillery at Forgandenny, Perthshire. When demand for whisky declined after 1900, Alexander and MacDonald were forced to reorganize and James Calder &amp; Co. acquired control of Stronachie distillery. In the controversy over blending Calder appeared as a witness at the royal commission on whisky in 1908, arguing for a definition of whisky which would include both pot and patent still products, a view confirmed by the commission.<br>
<br>The decline in whisky drinking prompted an amalgamation movement. James Calder &amp; Co. were wooed by the &#145;big three&#146; blenders (James Buchanan &amp; Co., John Dewar &amp; Sons, and John Walker &amp; Sons), who were interested in obtaining an alternative source of supply to the Distillers Company Ltd (DCL), and by DCL which saw Calders as a means of further consolidating control of yeast and spirit production. James Calder participated in merger talks with the &#145;big three&#146; in 1910 and was one of the few participants to emphasize managerial problems. These convinced him that independence was better and that it made more sense &#145;to remain on good terms with the DCL &hellip; and aim in the future at a larger affair&#146;  (J. Calder to A. J. Cameron, 14 Sept 1910, John Dewar &amp; Sons, original amalgamation papers, United Distillers archive). Nevertheless Calder co-operated in fixing prices and restricting output during the pre-war years.<br>
<br>The pace of the merger movement hastened with the anti-drink campaign during the First World War and the <span class="roman">Immature Spirits Act</span> of 1915 which exacerbated the shortage of mature whisky stocks. In 1919 Alexander and MacDonald combined with two other blending firms, William Williams &amp; Son of Aberdeen and Greenlees Brothers of London, to form MacDonald, Greenlees and Williams (Distillers) Ltd with Calder as chairman. With his extensive knowledge of the trade, Calder's advice was sought by distillers who were contemplating reconstruction schemes. In 1922 he advised the owners of Balmenach distillery and became chairman of the reconstructed company. After his father's death in 1917, he chaired the family timber business and during the war held the posts of deputy timber controller (1917&#150;19) and timber controller (1920) at the Board of Trade. For this service he was made CBE in 1920 and received a knighthood in 1921.<br>
<br>When DCL's plans for a post-war cartel embracing all patent distilleries proved abortive, amalgamation discussions with Calder were resumed. Calders had acquired control of a second patent still distillery, Gartloch, in 1907 and the possibility of the firm entering the DCL offered DCL control over all Scottish patent still distilling capacity except for the North British distillery whose unique, &#145;co-operative&#146; constitution shielded it from take-over. Unknown to Calder, DCL and the &#145;big three&#146; blenders had agreed in April 1918 that neither party would enter into negotiations with Calder &amp; Co. without securing the other party's consent. In effect Calders' future had been decided well before August 1921 when provisional agreement was reached between DCL and Calder. Finalized eight months later, it provided for the transfer of properties, plant, and working stock to DCL in exchange for 20,000 DCL ordinary shares (some six per cent of DCL's ordinary share capital), and a seat on DCL's board. Calder proved a tough and skilful negotiator, retaining ownership of the mature whisky stocks which were the firm's most valuable asset given the post-war shortage. Calder's Yeast Company was sold to the United Yeast Company at the same time.<br>
<br>When Calder joined DCL the company was desperately trying to develop new activities to replace the declining spirit market. Calder's wide business interests assisted this process. While visiting his timber interests in the Black Forest, for example, Calder heard of the &#145;Prodor&#146; and &#145;Goldschmidt&#146; processes for hydrolysing cellulose. This led to DCL, and Calder on a personal basis, investing in the British Bergius Syndicate which tried to develop the oil-from-coal (hydrogenation of coal) process. Calder retained his seat on DCL's board following the &#145;big amalgamation&#146; in 1925, when Buchanan&#150;Dewar and Walkers were acquired by DCL, and was active in the management. In December 1925 he brought MacDonald, Greenlees and Williams into DCL. In 1926&#150;7 he was part of a DCL delegation investigating the production of potable spirit in Australia. This was in response to Australian import duty on Scotch whisky and the delegation recommended that DCL should build a distillery at Corio Bay, Geelong. Calder's none too compelling argument was that &#145;if Australian whisky was going to supplant Scotch then the company may as well supply it&#146;  (Distillers Company Ltd, annual general meeting, 15 July 1927). In fact the investment proved unprofitable because Australia was severely affected by the international depression and merchants were unable to mature stocks of whisky.<br>
<br>Calder was a member of DCL's technical and research committee from 1925 to 1935, a period which saw the creation of a research laboratory at Great Burgh and an increased recruitment of scientists. When DCL formalized its management structure in 1935 Calder was appointed to the powerful management committee with responsibility for industrial alcohol, yeast, malt extract, methylated spirit, the works department, and the gin trade in the USA. As a senior director he represented DCL in several important negotiations including the attempt to prevent the Commercial Solvents Corporation invading the British solvents market, the initial discussions with ICI which culminated in the DCL&#150;ICI agreement, and the abortive project with Union Carbide for oil-cracking. His most enduring contribution was probably the gin trade in the USA for it gave DCL a firm foothold in the liquor trade following the repeal of prohibition. It also brought Calder into contact with Joseph Kennedy, reformed bootlegger and head of Somerset Importers, one of DCL's most successful distributors. He acted as host to Joseph Kennedy and the young John Kennedy when they toured Scotland during Joseph Kennedy's period of office as ambassador to Britain. Calder retired from the management committee in December 1940 and from the board in July 1941.<br>
<br>Calder also had extensive interests in brewing and forestry. He was a director of several brewing firms including the family brewing firm, though his younger brother, John, played the more active part. Calder owned sawmills in the north of Scotland and plantations in Germany and the United States. During the Second World War he was appointed director of home timber production (1940&#150;41).<br>
<br>Calder held a number of public offices, being a justice of the peace for Kinross-shire and a deputy lieutenant of the county from 1930. He owned estates at Ledlanet, Milnathort, and Lyndford Hall, Norfolk. His leisure activities included golf, shooting, and fishing, and he was chairman of the syndicate which owned the Grimersta River in Lewis. He married Mildred Louise, daughter of Colonel R. A. Manners, the Royal Scots, in 1904. They had no children. Lady Calder died in 1936; Sir James died of cerebral thrombosis, on 22 August 1962, at Ledlanet, Milnathort, aged ninety-two, and was buried at Lyndford Hall, Norfolk.<br>
