<span class="headword">Chittick,  (Hubert) Neville</span>  (1923&#150;1984), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, was born at 31 Brunswick Road, Hove, Sussex, on 18 September 1923, the son of Hubert Stanley Chittick (<i>d</i>. 1963/4), mechanical engineer, and his wife, Rosemary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Manson). He was educated at Rottingdean School and Rugby School, intending to proceed to Peterhouse, Cambridge (his father's college). But, because of the war and service in the army intelligence corps (in Austria and Italy), he was delayed until 1947, when, finding the college's quota for his preferred subject, history, fully subscribed, he read law instead. This (according to his contemporary, George Gale) he studied &#145;without enthusiasm&#146;. He completed his course in two years with adequate but not distinguished marks, but these were compensated for by the college's prize in law. He was remembered more for his eccentric appearance and loud conversation.<br>
<br>Despite following up his degree with the bar examinations (at Lincoln's Inn) in 1950, Chittick never practised law, being determined to pursue archaeology. For this purpose he stayed in Cambridge a further year for the diploma course, under Glyn Daniel in particular, and spent the next two years in Egypt and the Near East, travelling and excavating&#151;at Nimrud under Sir Max Mallowan, at Jericho under Kathleen Kenyon, at Mycenae under A. J. B. Wace, and in Cyprus. Then, in 1952, he was appointed curator of museums in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, his knowledge of Arabic being an asset. But that job was &#145;Sudanized&#146; in 1955, and he had to wait two years for a suitable opportunity when the post of conservator of antiquities in Tanganyika was created.<br>
<br>Though Neville Chittick did not intend it at the time, he was to spend the rest of his career in east Africa and to become during the 1960s the leading authority on the later archaeology of the region, and in particular of the medieval Swahili coast and its overseas contacts with the Islamic world. While his responsibilities, as government conservator from 1957 to 1961, covered the whole of Tanganyika, his taste was for the town sites of the coast and islands and their place in world history, their dating being established by architectural styles, by imported ceramics (from the Persian Gulf and indirectly from China), and by Arabic texts. This research was complementary to that which James Kirkman had been pursuing since 1948 on the adjacent Kenyan coast, and followed broadly the precepts established by Sir Mortimer Wheeler for British archaeology overseas at that period.<br>
<br>In 1961 Chittick was appointed director of the British Institute of History and Archaeology in East Africa, a research body newly founded by the British Academy, through the initiative of Wheeler among others, with the intention of developing historical knowledge of the region as Tanganyika, Uganda, Kenya, and Zanzibar were about to achieve their independence. The institute's early headquarters were in Dar es Salaam, convenient for Chittick's continuing excavation of Kilwa on the southern coast; this medieval harbour town had handled the gold from Zimbabwe and had been graced by the largest stone-built mosques and palaces in east Africa. In the mid-1960s the institute moved its base to Nairobi, that being more central for field research throughout the region. Although his own concentration remained on the coast&#151;of Kenya as well as Tanganyika/Tanzania&#151;Chittick followed closely the exploratory work of his assistants and students on up-country archaeology. He also assimilated the research of associated scholars from numerous countries who were at that period inspired to take up African history and archaeology; they found the British Institute and its unparalleled library, which Chittick was assembling at Chiromo in Nairobi, the obvious meeting place&#151;the more so because of Chittick's intellectual conviviality. Moreover, his initiative in founding and editing from 1966 an annual journal, <span class="italic">Azania</span>, for research in eastern African history and archaeology, confirmed the institute's leading role in this nascent subject.<br>
<br>This reputation occasioned a measure of envy in the emergent University of East Africa, with which the British Institute in Eastern Africa (as it was called from 1970) was affiliated, and particularly in the university's branch in Nairobi. Understandably, certain African scholars felt that the initiative in researching into the history of the region and its peoples should rest with themselves. Chittick was apt to exacerbate delicate feelings by his argumentative manner, which some found patronizing, so that what were at heart his liberal inclinations were often mistaken for an outmoded &#145;colonial&#146; attitude. Moreover, his research concentration on coastal history and overseas connections was interpreted in some quarters as a &#145;reactionary&#146; outsider line which failed to appreciate the achievements of African peoples. In this he may have been misunderstood, but he did not endear himself to critics or to students, least of all local ones, since he lacked the sensitivity and patience of a supervisor. He could be equally exasperating to his staff and excavation assistants. Nevertheless, he inspired loyalty, and those who knew him recognized his underlying warmth of character as well as charitable concern for individuals and just causes. He had an admiring circle, of women especially. His sociability (aided by an aptitude for languages) and his hospitality in Nairobi, both during and after his marriage to Helen Jane Wilson (<i>b</i>. 1933/4, whom he married on 6 September 1958), became legendary. Separation from his wife in 1969 was followed by divorce a few years later; he did not remarry, though he had an informal but stable relationship with Helen Morrison through the 1970s.<br>
<br>Chittick's coastal research was published in several British and international archaeological journals, as well as <span class="italic">Azania</span>. The full excavation report on Kilwa appeared in two substantial volumes as a memoir of the British Institute in 1974; a further volume on the excavations at Manda, on the northern Kenya coast, followed in 1984. As the leading authority on the subject, he contributed chapters to collaborative works, including the <span class="italic">Cambridge History of Africa</span> in the 1970s. Together with an American colleague, Robert Rotberg, he edited a volume entitled <span class="italic">East Africa and the Orient</span> (1975); this derived from a memorable conference in Nairobi in 1967.<br>
<br>The last work illustrated Chittick's abiding interest in the Indian Ocean and maritime trade in the Islamic period, and especially contacts with Arabia and the Persian Gulf. For he saw himself as an archaeologist of the old tradition, rather than as an Africanist, and, according to colleagues, he yearned to return to the Near East. That was not to be, but it was notable how from the late 1960s his activities edged northwards, first by extending his coastal explorations into Somalia. Apart from documenting the continuation of medieval Swahili relics there, a significant achievement was to locate sites of the Roman period at the Horn of Africa, notably Ras Hafun (thus confirming the testimony of the important Greek text of the first century <span class="smallcap">AD</span>, <span class="italic">The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea</span>).<br>
<br>Moreover, in 1972 the opportunity arose to investigate the ancient northern Ethiopian capital of Aksum, which had been an ally of the later Roman empire. With encouragement from the council of the British Institute (which was now extending its geographical interests), two major seasons of excavations were undertaken; these focused on the prominent monuments of Aksum, notably great stone tombs and the famous carved monolithic steles, the largest of which are believed to represent the successive kings of the third and fourth centuries (prior to the adoption of Christianity). This work was cut short by the Ethiopian revolution of 1974, and during the subsequent years of insecurity it proved impossible to resume the excavations, a predicament which Chittick found especially frustrating. He died suddenly from a heart attack at his temporary abode, 49 Grange Road, Cambridge, on 27 July 1984 (almost a year after the institute's council had insisted on his retiring), and was cremated in Cambridge on 3 August, after a funeral at Peterhouse. Arrangements were made to have his important, albeit incomplete, Aksum research written up for the British Institute's memoir series (mainly by Stuart Munro-Hay, who had been Chittick's student at Aksum).<br>
<br>Neville Chittick's achievements were recognized when he was appointed OBE in 1984, one month before his death.<br>
