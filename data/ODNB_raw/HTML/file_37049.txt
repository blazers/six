<span class="headword">Wyllie, Sir  (William Hutt) Curzon</span>  (1848&#150;1909), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born at Cheltenham on 5 October 1848, was the third and youngest son of the five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30138/', "General Sir William Wyllie (1802&#150;1891)")</script> and his wife, Amelia (1806&#150;1891), daughter of Richards Hutt of Appley, Isle of Wight, and niece of Captain John Hutt RN (1746&#150;1794). Both his brothers served in India&#151;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30137/', "John William Shaw Wyllie (1835&#150;1870)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30138/', "Wyllie, Sir William")</script>] and Francis Robert Shaw Wyllie (1837&#150;1907). The latter, born on 4 June 1837, was educated at Cheltenham College (1849&#150;54), the East India Company's college, Haileybury (1856&#150;7), joined the Bombay civil service, became under-secretary to the Bombay government, and died in London in February 1907.<br>
<br>Educated at Marlborough College (1863&#150;4) and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst (1865&#150;6), Wyllie entered the army in October 1866 as ensign 106th foot (Durham light infantry). He arrived in India in February 1867, was promoted lieutenant in October 1868, joined the Indian staff corps in 1869, and was posted to the 2nd Gurkha regiment (the Sirmoor Rifles, later the 2nd King Edward's Own Gurkhas). In 1870 he was selected for civil and political employment, appointed to the Oudh commission, and served under General Barrow and Sir George Couper.<br>
<br>Promoted captain in October 1878, in January 1879 Wyllie was transferred to the foreign department, serving successively as cantonment magistrate of Nasirabad, assistant commissioner in Ajmer-Merwara, and assistant to the governor-general's agent in Baluchistan, Sir Robert Groves Sandeman. He went through the Afghan campaign of 1878&#150;80, including the march on Kandahar, with Major-General Sir Robert Phayre, and was mentioned in the viceroy's dispatches. After the war he was military secretary to his brother-in-law, William Patrick Adam, governor of Madras, from December 1880 until Adam's death in the following May, and until November 1881 he was private secretary to William Hudleston (acting governor).<br>
<br>Wyllie married on 29 December 1881 Katharine Georgiana, second daughter of David Fremantle Carmichael of the Indian Civil Service, then member of the council, Madras; she survived her husband.<br>
<br>Wyllie had charge of Malhar Rao, the former Maharaja Gaikwar of Baroda, from December 1881 to November 1882. He then became assistant resident at Hyderabad. Subsequently he was assistant commissioner, Ajmer-Merwara, 1883; first assistant in Rajputana, 1884; additional political agent, Kotah, April 1885; boundary settlement officer, Mewar&#150;Marwar border, November 1886; political agent, Kotah, January 1889; officiating commissioner of Ajmer, July 1891; officiating political agent, Jhallawar, in addition to Kotah, 1891&#150;2; resident, western states of Rajputana (Jodhpur), 1892&#150;3; and resident in Mewar (Udaipur), November 1893 to February 1898, when he officiated as resident in Nepal. Later in 1898 he attained one of the highest appointments in the service, that of agent to the governor-general in central India. In May 1900 he was transferred in the same capacity to Rajputana, where he remained for the rest of his service in India. Made CIE in 1881, he was promoted major in October 1886 and lieutenant-colonel in 1892.<br>
<br>Throughout his long and varied service in the princely states of India, and especially in Rajputana, where seventeen of the most strenuous years of his life were spent, Wyllie gained by his courtesy, charm, and above all by his character and strength of purpose, remarkable influence over the chiefs and officials of the principalities under his administrative charge. In addition Wyllie had the reputation, so dear to Rajputs, of a keen sportsman and a skilful and daring rider, who held as a trophy the blue riband of Indian sportsmen, the Hog-hunters' Ganges cup, which he won in Oudh in April 1875.<br>
<br>Wyllie's example stimulated those who served under him, and it was owing to his energy and to the confidence in him of the princes and people of Rajputana that the calamity of famine during 1899&#150;1900 was successfully overcome by the relief measures he organized.<br>
<br>In March 1901 Wyllie came home on being selected by Lord George Hamilton (Conservative secretary of state for India 1895&#150;1903) as his political aide-de-camp. Wyllie's knowledge of India and the Indian princes fitted him for the important and often delicate duties, which included advising the secretary of state on political questions relating to the princely states. Arrangements for the reception of Indian magnates at the British court were in his charge, and heavy work devolved upon him at Edward VII's coronation in 1902. He was appointed KCIE and MVO in 1902 and CVO in June 1907.<br>
<br>Wyllie's official position brought him into close contact with Indian students in whose welfare he was deeply interested. He also devoted himself to associations and charities for the benefit of Indians.<br>
<br>While attending, with Lady Wyllie, an entertainment given to Indians by the National Indian Association at the Imperial Institute, South Kensington, London, on the night of Friday 1 July 1909, Wyllie was assassinated, almost under the eyes of his wife, by Madan Lal Dhingra, a Hindu extremist student, whom Wyllie had helped, who suddenly fired at him with a revolver, killing him instantly. Dr Cawas Lalcaca, a Parsi physician of Shanghai, who bravely interposed to save Wyllie, was also mortally wounded. These crimes were precursors of terrorist crimes in India. Dhingra&#151;a Punjabi London University engineering student and political pupil of the London-based extremist Shyamji Krishnavarma&#151;was convicted of the double crime at the central criminal court on 23 July, and hanged at Pentonville prison on 17 August. Wyllie was buried at Richmond cemetery, Surrey, on 6 July.<br>
<br>Wyllie's tragic death was felt as deeply in India as at home. Flags were put at half mast, and public offices were closed throughout Rajputana and central India on reception of the news; and on the day of Wyllie's funeral (in Richmond cemetery) a salute of thirteen guns was fired from the palace fortresses of Rajputana. Viscount Morley, the secretary of state in council, recorded &#145;his high appreciation of Wyllie's admirable services&#146;, and his &#145;profound sense of the personal loss&#146; sustained by himself and his colleagues &#145;by the blind, atrocious crime&#146;. He granted a special pension of &pound;500 to Lady Wyllie in recognition of her husband's service and death. Memorial funds were raised in Britain and India. From the British fund a marble tablet erected in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral was unveiled by Earl Roberts on 19 October 1910, in the presence, among others, of the three successive secretaries of state (Lord George Hamilton and viscounts Midleton and Morley) whom Wyllie had served. The balance, &pound;2551, the Curzon Wyllie memorial fund, was entrusted to the Strangers' Home for Asiatics, Limehouse, on the governing body of which he had served. At Marlborough College there was founded a Curzon Wyllie memorial medal, to be awarded annually to the most efficient member of the officer training corps. In India the Curzon Wyllie central memorial fund committee erected at a cost of &pound;2000 a marble <i>aramgarh</i> (place of rest) in Ajmer, Rajputana, to provide shade, rest, and water for men and animals. Local memorials were also instituted in many of the states of Rajputana and central India.<br>
