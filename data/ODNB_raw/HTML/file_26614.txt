<span class="headword">Stowell,  Hugh</span>  (1799&#150;1865), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Douglas, Isle of Man, on 3 December 1799, the elder son of Hugh Stowell (1768&#150;1836), later successively vicar of Kirk Lonan and rector of Ballaugh, and biographer of Bishop Thomas Wilson, and his wife, Amelia (1779&#150;1816), daughter of William Callow, a merchant in Douglas. The family had been long settled on the island, and Stowell's boyhood was spent in his father's rural Manx parishes. He was educated at home and imbibed his parents' deep piety, which blended the high-church legacy of Bishop Wilson with the growing influence of the evangelical movement. He matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in April 1819, but before taking up residence at the university, spent a period of preparation with John Cawood, incumbent of Bewdley, Worcestershire. He took his BA in 1822 and his MA in 1826. Meanwhile, he was ordained in December 1823 by Bishop Ryder of Gloucester. His first curacy was the chapelry of Shepscombe in the parish of Painswick.<br>
<br>In 1824 Stowell moved to Trinity Church, Huddersfield, where he began the energetic urban ministry that was to characterize his career. By 1828 he had already established a reputation as a vigorous and inspiring preacher, and when he moved in that year to become curate in charge of St Stephen's, Salford, Bishop Blomfield of Chester initially hesitated to license a man who had been described to him as an &#145;extemporaneous firebrand&#146;. Stowell, however, overcame such obstacles and settled in Salford, where he married, also in 1828, Anne Susannah, eldest daughter of Richard Ashworth, of Strawberry Hill, Pendleton, Lancashire. They were to have three sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>Stowell's backers shortly built for him the new church of Christ Church, Acton Square, Salford, which was consecrated in November 1831, and where he was to remain for the rest of his life, refusing further preferment apart from an honorary canonry of Chester, to which he was appointed in 1845. He was remarkable for his powerful extemporary preaching, distinguished more by fervency than by intellectual depth, and for his energy in developing structures for education, visitation, and pastoral care. His admirers claimed that he had enormous influence with the working classes.<br>
<br>Stowell assumed a prominent position in religious politics. He was a familiar speaker at the meetings of numerous evangelical societies both in London and in the provinces, and a leader of successful resistance to the suppression of the see of Sodor and Man, and to secular schemes of education. Above all he was an untiring opponent of Roman Catholicism. His fame on this score was first established by his prominent role in the Protestant Association in the later 1830s, and was confirmed in 1840, when he was the defendant in a celebrated libel action brought by a Roman Catholic priest, Father Hearne. Stowell initially lost the case but the verdict was reversed on appeal. He perceived protestantism as a pastoral and political matter as well as a religious one, and he accordingly campaigned vigorously at elections for the return of anti-Catholic candidates.<br>
<br>Stowell was a heavily built man whose combative public image belied his genuine spirituality and his gentleness in private life. He published sermons, pamphlets, and polemical works, and was also a writer and compiler of hymns. His health declined from 1862, and he died at his home, Barr Hill, Pendleton, on 8 October 1865. His wife survived him. He was buried beneath the church where he had ministered for so long on 13 October, following a large-scale funeral that was impressive testimony to the central position that he had attained in the religious and political life of early Victorian Lancashire.<br>
