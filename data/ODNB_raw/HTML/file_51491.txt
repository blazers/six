<span class="headword">Blaschko,  Hugh <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Karl Felix Hermann]</span></span>  (1900&#150;1993), <span class="occ">biochemist and pharmacologist</span>, was born on 4 January 1900 in Friedrichstrasse, Berlin, the only son and second of the three children of Alfred Blaschko (1858&#150;1922), dermatologist and venereologist, and his wife, Johanna (1873&#150;1943), daughter of Karl Litthauer, medical doctor. Surrounded in Berlin by many Jewish relations and by medical and socialist friends of his father, Hermann (or Hugh as he was known in England) developed an early interest in natural science and became an internationalist. An extraordinarily detailed and vivid account of this period is given in his posthumously published book <span class="italic">Memories of my Early Life</span> (1997). He was educated at a private school on the Landsberger Platz, Berlin (1906&#150;9) and at the Prinz Heinrich Gymnasium, Berlin Sch&ouml;neberg. With so much medicine in the family (father and both grandfathers), it was inevitable that he would then study medicine, first in Berlin (1917&#150;19), then in Freiburg im Breisgau (1919&#150;21), then back in Berlin for his clinical studies (1921&#150;2). It was at Freiburg that he first met, as a fellow student, Hans Krebs, who was to join him at Oxford thirty-five years later. His first post was at the university clinic for internal medicine in G&ouml;ttingen (1923), but it was his period with Otto Meyerhof (just awarded the Nobel prize) in Berlin and later Heidelberg (1925&#150;32) that gave him an insight into scientific method and also introduced him to many of the leading biochemists of the time. Blaschko's warmth and sincerity led to lifelong friendships with many he met at this time. One of his outstanding qualities was the way in which he nurtured his friendships, however far away his friends lived.<br>
<br>Blaschko's first period in England was with Archibald Vivian Hill (who shared the Nobel prize with Meyerhof) at University College, London, in 1929&#150;30. It was while he was with Hill that Blaschko carried out his first truly independent piece of research, perhaps reflecting the different attitude of British and continental professors to their young prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. The visit to Hill was to be of great importance for another reason. After his return to Germany Blaschko suffered several recurrences of tuberculosis (which he first contracted in 1926), and one of these was in 1933, when the advent of the Nazi regime made him realize that he had no future in Germany. He was in hospital in Freiburg, being attended by Hans Krebs as physician, but while convalescing he worked in Krebs's laboratory to improve his skills in manometry&#151;a technique crucial to several of his later discoveries. While he was still in hospital, a letter arrived from Hill inviting him to return to University College, London. He did not hesitate to accept: as he wrote later, his return &#145;felt more like a homecoming&#146;. Instead of beginning independent research in Hill's laboratory, Blaschko had to continue his convalescence, and so spent most of his time helping Hill with the Academic Assistance Council. The society had been founded by Hill, Archbishop William Temple, A. D. Lindsay, and Sir William Beveridge to help refugee scholars. Blaschko's main job was to interview scholars from Germany and advise Hill about their needs. He later claimed to have learned from Hill that a scientist's duty does not end in the laboratory but extends to the support and care of the human being, something that his own life clearly demonstrated.<br>
<br>One of the most productive periods of Blaschko's scientific life followed his move to Cambridge in 1934; upon the advice of Hill and Krebs he went to Joseph Barcroft's physiological laboratory with a grant from the Society for the Protection of Science and Learning. It was in response to a question from Barcroft, who asked him how adrenalin was destroyed in the body, that he did the crucial experiments that led to the discovery in 1937 of the enzyme amine oxidase. Blaschko's grant only lasted for two years, and so he had to support himself by teaching at Cambridge&#151;a somewhat precarious business, since he never knew until the beginning of each term whether he would have any students. He often used to recount the future careers of his Cambridge pupils. He told these stories at times when his young colleagues became despondent about the heavy teaching load they had to bear: &#145;Never mind, you never know whether one of your pupils will be another Sanger&#146;, he used to say  (private information). (Frederick Sanger won the Nobel prize twice and was one of Blaschko's pupils.) In 1939 he proposed the sequence of reactions that led to the synthesis of adrenalin in the body; his idea had to wait ten years for convincing experimental proof.<br>
<br>The last and long-lasting flowering of Blaschko's scientific life occurred after he moved to Oxford in 1944 in response to an invitation from J. H. Burn to join the department of pharmacology. Blaschko had the great fortune to move from a department that was the mecca for physiologists to one that rapidly became the mecca for pharmacologists. There he discovered how the potent substance adrenalin was safely stored in the adrenal gland at very high concentration. This discovery paved the way for the understanding of how chemical transmitter substances are stored in, and released from, nerves throughout the body. Not only did Oxford give him his first and only permanent post (he retired in 1967), but there he met and, on 29 December 1944, married Mary Douglas Black (1908&#150;2000), daughter of John Robert Black, of Yelverton, Devon. She was a Quaker and a teacher at the Dragon School, Oxford. The marriage was one of exceptional harmony, mutual support, and happiness, although childless. However, the Blaschkos made up for a lack of children by embracing all who came into their life, such that they had a remarkable extended family throughout the world. Their home at 24 Park Town became a haven for innumerable scientists of all ages. Blaschko kept up with his &#145;family&#146; by correspondence and could remember the finest details of their lives. Indeed, one of his extraordinary attributes was a phenomenal memory, extending back into his childhood. In his relationships he was open-minded, thoughtful, and low-key. He found good in everyone, and had an impish sense of humour and a total lack of conceit. He was a most delightful person to be with.<br>
<br>In 1965 Blaschko became <i>ad hominem</i> reader in biochemical pharmacology in the department of pharmacology, University of Oxford, and a fellow of Linacre College, a college he helped to found. He retired in 1967, becoming emeritus reader and emeritus fellow of Linacre. For nearly half a century he was one of the great figures in Oxford science and in its community. His greatness was not flamboyant but lay in his ever-alert mind, his sense of curiosity and wonder, and his belief in, and encouragement of, others younger than himself. He was author of more than 200 scientific articles, was elected FRS in 1962, and was awarded many distinctions around the world, including the Purkinje medal (Prague, 1963), the Schmiedeberg Plakette of the German Pharmacological Society (1972), the first Thudicum medal of the Biochemical Society (1974), and the Wellcome gold medal of the British Pharmacological Society (1979). He was a member of the editorial boards of numerous journals, including <span class="italic">Pharmacological Reviews</span> and the <span class="italic">Journal of Physiology</span>. He died at his home in Oxford, following a sudden internal haemorrhage, on 18 April 1993. A commemoration was held on 22 May 1993 at the Friends' meeting-house, Oxford. His wife, who survived him, endowed the Blaschko visiting scholarship at the department of pharmacology, Oxford, and Linacre College (where there is a Blaschko Room), in order to continue the tradition that he began of bringing young scholars from Europe into his laboratory.<br>
