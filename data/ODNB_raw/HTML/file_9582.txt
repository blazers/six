<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  Raymond  fitz William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Raymond le Gros]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1189<span class="mult">x</span>92), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, frequently known as Raymond le Gros, was the son of William Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1173), son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45551/', "Gerald of Windsor")</script>, constable of Pembroke, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19905/', "Nest")</script>, daughter of Rhys ap Tewdwr, king of Deheubarth (south Wales). He was therefore a first cousin of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10769/', "Gerald of Wales")</script>, who recounted his participation in Anglo-Norman intervention in Ireland with great partiality.<br>
<br>In April 1170 Raymond le Gros led ten knights and seventy archers in advance of Richard fitz Gilbert, earl of Pembroke and lord of Striguil, known as Strongbow, to whose household he was attached, and from whom Diarmait Mac Murchada, exiled king of Leinster, had sought military assistance to recover his kingdom. He landed at D&uacute;n Domnaill, near Waterford, and constructed an earthen fortification, with the consent of Mac Murchada, from which he and his men plundered the surrounding countryside, seizing cattle. It was besieged by a large force of Irish drawn from Waterford city and Osraige and accompanied by Domnall &Oacute; F&aacute;el&aacute;in, king of D&eacute;isi, and &Oacute; Riain, king of U&iacute; Dr&oacute;na, who managed to penetrate the camp; but the cattle, which had been impounded within, stampeded and scattered the attackers, who were then pursued by Raymond and his men. Over five hundred were slain; seventy more were taken captive and subsequently killed, their bodies thrown from cliffs into the sea. Following Strongbow's landing at Waterford on 23 August 1170, Raymond joined forces with him and Waterford city was besieged and taken two days later. Raymond was also present with Strongbow at the capture of Dublin in September 1170. When Henry II closed the ports to Ireland and summoned the return of subjects who had gone there without his consent, Strongbow sent Raymond to negotiate with the king on his behalf; Raymond was following the royal court in Aquitaine and awaiting a response when news broke of the murder of Thomas Becket, archbishop of Canterbury. Raymond's meeting with Henry was inconclusive. He returned to Ireland and was with Strongbow at Dublin when the city was besieged by Ruaidr&iacute; &Oacute; Conchobair, king of Connacht, and claimant to the high-kingship, in the summer of 1171.<br>
<br>On the testimony of Gerald of Wales, when Henry II visited Ireland in 1171&#150;2 he sought to attract Raymond le Gros into his service and away from Strongbow's party, and Raymond seems to have left with the king in April 1172. In 1173, following Strongbow's military service on behalf of the king in Normandy, Henry II consented to his return to Ireland; Raymond went with him and undertook a series of plundering expeditions in the vicinity of Lismore and Waterford. About 1173 he left for Wales: according to Gerald, this was on learning of the death of his father; but according to the so-called <span class="italic">Song of Dermot and the Earl</span> it was because Strongbow had refused him marriage to his sister, Basilia, widow of Robert de Quincy (<i>d</i>. 1173), who had been Strongbow's constable in Leinster. Gerald claimed that, as a result of Anglo-Norman military reverses in 1174 under Strongbow's uncle, Hervey de Montmorency (whom Gerald portrayed as Raymond's jealous rival for leadership of Strongbow's troops), Strongbow was obliged to seek Raymond's return, now promising him Basilia in marriage. Raymond landed at Wexford, with additional forces (including Meiler fitz Henry), and his marriage to Basilia took place shortly afterwards, with Raymond being enfeoffed by Strongbow with lands in Fotharta U&iacute; Nuall&aacute;in and U&iacute; Dr&oacute;na (Carlow), and U&iacute; Dega and Glascarrig (Wexford).<br>
<br>About October 1175 an Anglo-Norman expedition under Raymond le Gros's leadership captured the city of Limerick from Domnall &Oacute; Briain, king of Thomond. Gerald of Wales depicted Hervey de Montmorency accusing Raymond to Henry II of seeking to seize control not only of Limerick but of all Ireland on his own behalf, and of acting as the leader of a band of mercenaries who fought in the manner of Brabantine soldiers. Henry dispatched messengers to recall Raymond, who was on the point of departure for England, when it emerged that the Anglo-Norman garrison in Limerick was being besieged by Domnall &Oacute; Briain. It was decided that Raymond should go to its relief. Following the retaking of Limerick, Diarmait Mac Carthaig, king of Desmond, sought Raymond's assistance against a revolt of his son, Cormac Liath&aacute;nach; Raymond hosted into Desmond in support of Diarmait Mac Carthaig and secured large quantities of booty. On learning of Strongbow's death in April 1176, Raymond decided that the Anglo-Norman garrison in Limerick should abandon the city; and the royal agents determined for the time being to leave him in charge of the Anglo-Norman forces in Ireland. Henry II sent William fitz Aldelin to Ireland, to whom Raymond surrendered the cities, castles, and hostages which he held. Gerald of Wales accused fitz Aldelin of depriving Raymond through motives of jealousy of lands which he held in U&iacute; F&aacute;el&aacute;in in north Leinster and in the vicinity of Wexford. Gerald, however, consistently magnified Raymond's military role, obscuring the distinction between the office of royal constable and that of constable of Strongbow's household, and between custodial and enfeoffed lands. About 1183 the royal officials, John the Constable and Richard de Pec, built a castle for Raymond le Gros in Fotharta U&iacute; Nuall&aacute;in, indicating that it was his main landholding. In 1185 Raymond witnessed the charter issued by John, lord of Ireland, at Dublin in favour of St Mary's Abbey. On the death of his maternal uncle, Robert fitz Stephen, some time after 1185, Raymond acquired his lands in the kingdom of Cork (Desmond).<br>
<br>It is unlikely that Raymond le Gros had died before 1189 since Gerald of Wales has no account of his death in the <span class="italic">Expugnatio Hibernica</span>, of about that year. He had no legitimate heirs. His widow, Basilia, subsequently married Geoffrey fitz Robert and confirmed land grants in Fotharta; a charter issued by Geoffrey and Basilia to St Thomas's Abbey, Dublin, witnessed by William Piro before his elevation to the see of Glendalough in 1192, indicates that Raymond was dead by that date.<br>
