<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Powell,  Cecil Frank</span>  (1903&#150;1969), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born in Tonbridge, Kent, on 5 December 1903, the elder child and only son of Frank Powell, gunsmith, of 99 High Street, Tonbridge, and his wife, Elizabeth Caroline Bisacre. His father, from a family long established as gunsmiths in Tonbridge, had been bankrupted by a lawsuit arising from a shooting accident, so family circumstances were severely straitened in Powell's childhood. Nevertheless, encouraged by his grandfather George Bisacre, a schoolmaster, who gave him second-hand (and rather ancient) scientific texts, and inspired by the engineering talents of two paternal uncles, one of whom had constructed the first successful motor car in the Tonbridge district, he contrived to have a garden-shed chemical laboratory while a schoolboy.<br>
<br>At eleven Powell won a scholarship to Sir A. Judd's Commercial School, Tonbridge, whence state and college open scholarships took him to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he obtained first-class honours in parts one (1924) and two (1925) of the natural sciences tripos, and was placed second in his year for physics. He followed this with research in Rutherford's Cavendish Laboratory, under the direction of C. T. R. Wilson. In 1928 he moved, as research assistant to Professor A. M. Tyndall, to the newly opened H. H. Wills Physics Laboratory of the University of Bristol. There he spent the rest of his career, becoming lecturer (1931), reader (1946), Melville Wills professor of physics (1948&#150;63), Henry Overton Wills professor of physics and director of the H. H. Wills Physics Laboratory (1964&#150;9), and a pro-vice-chancellor of the university (1964&#150;7). He was elected to the Royal Society in 1949 and received the Nobel prize for physics in 1950. He was elected president of the Association of Scientific Workers in 1954 and of the World Federation of Scientific Workers in 1957. He married, in 1932, Isobel Therese (1907&#150;1995), daughter of Johann Artner, an Austrian business executive with I. G. Farbenindustrie. They had two daughters. Isobel was to become an important member of his research team.<br>
<br>Powell's earliest research work, with C. T. R. Wilson, which aimed at improving the performance of cloud chambers, had an engineering spin-off in application to the discharge of steam through nozzles. With Tyndall, during Powell's first four years in Bristol, the nature of gaseous ions was greatly clarified. His research interests then diverged in two very different directions&#151;seismology and nuclear physics. In 1935 he went as seismologist on the joint Colonial Office and Royal Society expedition to Montserrat, West Indies. Another such expedition to Dominica was being planned in 1939, but was frustrated by the war, and at that point Powell's career as a seismologist ended.<br>
<br>Concurrently, Powell undertook the construction of a Cockcroft generator to produce a 700 keV proton beam, and the associated cloud chamber, evidence of his considerable skill and enjoyment in working with his hands. His high-voltage set came into service in 1939 but was dismantled in 1940 because space was needed for other war-related work. However, it was in use for long enough to launch him into what was to be his principal line of research. Before the cloud chamber was ready he recorded his proton beam in the emulsion of a photographic plate, tangentially exposed. Then he used the same technique to determine the energy spectrum of a neutron source by registering the tracks of &#145;knock-on&#146; protons in the emulsion, and at the same time he participated in experiments registering events produced by the cosmic rays in photographic plates stored on high mountains.<br>
<br>It was generally thought at the time that the registration of fast particle tracks in emulsion was only suitable for qualitative demonstrations and could give no results of worthwhile precision, but Powell persisted in following his belief that, with better microscopes, better used, with improved processing techniques, and with the development of new thicker and more silver-rich emulsions, the accuracy and sensitivity of the method could be greatly improved. He was correct, and was rewarded with an important harvest of new phenomena observed in the cosmic rays in the years following the war. The method had an intrinsic advantage over all others for the observation of particle transformations occurring after very short time intervals (because of the high magnification under which the tracks were seen). The resolution of the meson paradox in 1947, revealing that there was a strongly interacting &#960;-meson which transformed spontaneously into a weakly interacting and relatively long-lived &#956;-meson. won him his Nobel prize. These observations were made in balloon-borne stacks of photographic emulsion, a method which was to reveal a new world of transient &#145;fundamental&#146; particles during the next decade.<br>
<br>Powell built up a team of more than twenty researchers from all over the world, and collaborated with many others. An integral part of his group were the dozen or so female &#145;scanners&#146;, headed by his wife and known in the department as &#145;Cecil's beauty chorus&#146;. He treated all his team as equals and was punctilious in acknowledging co-workers. From his position thus established as a leader in European collaborative research Powell then played a leading role in the establishment of the Conseil Europ&eacute;en de Recherches Nucl&eacute;aires (CERN) at Geneva as fundamental particle research entered the era of giant accelerator machines too expensive for any one nation in Europe to develop. He was chairman of the scientific policy committee of CERN from 1961 to 1963. To the end of his life he continued to play an active part both in the science and in the forward planning of research on fundamental particles.<br>
<br>Powell's politics had been on the left, but in a speech in 1955 on the hydrogen bomb and the future of mankind, later published as a pamphlet by the London Co-operative Society, he said:<blockquote>We are in a situation of great difficulty and danger in which it is very important to create a serious and informed body of opinion, all over the world &hellip; [which] must, if it is to be effective, embrace people with conflicting opinions on almost all other issues but who can be united on this.</blockquote>This represented his political position from then onwards. He was importantly involved in the discussions leading up to the Russell&#150;Einstein declaration of 9 July 1955, of which he was one of the eleven original signatories, and in the setting up of the Pugwash series of conferences on science and world affairs, commencing on 7 July 1957. He was elected chairman in 1967 but had in fact been the working chairman from the beginning, as deputy to Bertrand Russell who, prevented by age from attendance, usually guided the conferences from a distance. All such duties Powell performed with great charm, tact, and literary style.<br>
<br>Of medium height, and cheerfully serious disposition, Powell's hobbies included landscape drawing and making furniture, preferably from a difficult wood like yew. He had a well-developed sense of humour and was a skilled raconteur: at parties he enjoyed being asked to recite &#145;The Barge&#146; or to tell some story about his inventive Uncle Horace. As chairman of an awkward confrontation he knew how to lower the temperature with a well-timed joke. He was one of Bristol University's leading statesmen at the time of student unrest in 1968, helping to allay suspicions of professors and students alike. He had a love for good English, and particularly liked to find an apposite quotation from the essays of Bacon. One of his greatest joys was an unplanned audience reaction when he gave a lecture on the cosmic rays at Oxford. After he had entered the Sheldonian Theatre with the vice-chancellor and bedells in robed procession, his innocent opening words, &#145;Coming from outer space&#146;, brought the house down.<br>
<br>The Royal Society awarded Powell the Hughes medal in 1949 (the year of his election as a fellow) and the royal medal in 1961; he gave the Bakerian lecture in 1957, and a tercentenary lecture in 1960. The Physical Society of London awarded him the Charles Vernon Boys prize in 1947, and (as the Institute of Physics and the Physical Society) the Guthrie medal and prize in 1969. He was elected a foreign member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in 1958 and received its Lomonosov gold medal in 1967, and was elected a foreign member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1966. He was an honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy (1959) and an ordinary member of the Leopoldina Academy, Halle (1964), and received honorary doctorates from the universities of Dublin (1950), Bordeaux (1952), Warsaw (1959), Berlin (1960), Padua (1965), and Moscow (1966). He was also an honorary fellow of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge (1966), and of the Institute of Physics and the Physical Society (1962). He was chairman of the nuclear physics board of the British Science Research Council from 1965 to 1968. In addition to many scientific papers and published lectures, Powell published, in 1947, with G. P. S. Occhialini, <span class="italic">Nuclear Physics in Photographs</span>, and, in 1959, with P. H. Fowler and D. H. Perkins, <span class="italic">The Study of Elementary Particles by the Photographic Method</span>.<br>
<br>On 9 August 1969, eight days after he retired from the Bristol chair, Powell died of a heart attack on an Italian mountainside, at Alpe Giumello, Commune di Casargo, Lago di Como. A commemorative plaque donated by the Clifton and Hotwells Improvement Society marks his place of residence from 1946 to 1954 at 1 Downside Road, Clifton, Bristol.<br>
