<span class="headword">Fitzwilliam, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1497), <span class="occ">lawyer and speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was born into a Lincolnshire gentry family, the son of Thomas Fitzwilliam of Mablethorpe (<i>d</i>. 1479) and his wife, Margaret Dymmok (<i>d</i>. 1463). He was educated at the Inner Temple, where he was twice reader in the 1460s. By then he was already launched on his professional career, having been appointed to the quorum of the Lindsey bench in 1458 and elected to parliament for Lincoln in the following year, perhaps because he was the city's recorder. His being returned again to parliament in 1467, this time for the Devon borough of Plympton Erle, whose representation was then in the hands of the crown, suggests that he had adapted easily to the political changes of the 1460s, as Lancaster gave way to York. But his Yorkist allegiance seems to have been less than wholehearted, for he and his father were implicated in the rebellion of 1470 against Edward IV of their Lincolnshire neighbours, the seventh Baron Welles and his son, and not until the mid-1470s did the younger Thomas recover his place in county affairs. When he did so, however, it was as a figure of importance. On 26 February 1478, the last day of a parliament in which he again sat for Lincoln, the crown granted Fitzwilliam a life annuity of 5 marks &#145;for his counsel&#146;, and on 12 November following his place in the king's service was confirmed by his appointment as one of the duchy of Lancaster's serjeants-at-law.<br>
<br>Further recognition of Fitzwilliam's legal talents came on 19 June 1483, when the common council of London elected him recorder of the city; perhaps it was at this time that he acquired a house in Stepney. His promotion came at a time of acute political dislocation, and he was soon called upon to play his part in a national crisis. On 24 June, according to Sir Thomas More, Henry Stafford, second duke of Buckingham, made a speech to an unenthusiastic audience in the London Guildhall supporting the claim to the throne of Richard, duke of Gloucester. Fitzwilliam, called upon to second it, so tempered &#145;his tale, that he shewed every thing as the dukes wordes and no part his owne&#146;  (More, 75). But however lukewarm he may have been in upholding Richard's claim, he became active in the affairs of the new reign and benefited from royal patronage. On 5 July 1483, as Richard III's coronation procession moved through Cheapside, Fitzwilliam, as recorder, presented &pound;1000 to the king and queen as the city's contribution to the costs of the occasion, and early in 1484 he was granted an annuity of 20 marks and a renewal of his lease of the duchy of Lancaster manor of Saltfleetby, near Mablethorpe, which he had held since 1467.<br>
<br>Such rewards seem to have been insufficient to retain Fitzwilliam's services, which were probably reluctantly given. He was among those present at Shoreditch on 3 September 1485 to welcome Henry Tudor to London after his victory at Bosworth, and thereafter became yet more active in government. On 25 October that year he was elected to represent London in the first parliament of the new reign, and was responsible for informing his fellow MPs how notice of the speaker's election was customarily given to the chancellor. He was knighted during the course of the parliament (in 1486), and when it ended received royal grants that largely confirmed the gains he had made under Richard III: he was given a seven-year lease of Saltfleetby and a &pound;10 annuity &#145;for his advice to the king&#146;, exchanging both in 1488 for a life interest in Saltfleetby at a nominal rent. The recorder of London had clearly found favour with Henry VII, which explains why on 14 January 1489, at the opening of the third parliament of the reign, the Commons elected Fitzwilliam as their speaker. Probably they were merely confirming a royal nomination. Although he had been returned for London on 2 December 1488, he secured election for Lincolnshire before parliament opened; he had probably received notice that the king intended him for the speakership, for which he required a county rather than a borough seat. On his election as speaker he was voted 10 marks by the chamber of London, and at the end of what proved to be a lengthy and fraught parliament of three sessions he received the customary reward of &pound;100 from the crown.<br>
<br>Following the 1489&#150;90 parliament Fitzwilliam's involvement in public affairs declined. He must already have been in his early sixties when he became speaker, and though he continued to be appointed to local commissions as late as July 1496, he last occurs as recorder of London in October 1494, and had been replaced in that office by Robert Sheffield, another Lincolnshire man, by the following September. He drew up a lengthy will on 25 June 1494, requesting burial in the Premonstratensian abbey of Hagnaby, a few miles from Mablethorpe, should he die in Lincolnshire or within 40 miles of that county. Like many other lawyers, he showed a lively concern for the health of his soul; in 1476 he had been licensed to found a chantry in Alford church, a few miles south-west of Mablethorpe, and in his will he directed that 1500 memorial masses be said for him within eight weeks of his death. He died on 4 March 1497, and was buried not in Hagnaby Abbey but in Mablethorpe church, where what is believed to be his tomb chest survives. With his wife, Margaret Harrington (<i>d</i>. 1498), he had at least three sons, John, George, and William. John predeceased him, and when Thomas died his heir was John's son, another Thomas. Neither his widow nor the younger Thomas long survived him, and in 1502 his estates passed to his second son, George.<br>
