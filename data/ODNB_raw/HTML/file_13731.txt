<span class="headword">Hope,  John</span>, fourth earl of Hopetoun  (1765&#150;1823), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, the son of John Hope, second earl (1704&#150;1781), and his second wife, Jean (<i>d</i>. 1767), daughter of Robert Oliphant of Rossie, Perthshire, was born at Hopetoun House, Abercorn parish, Linlithgowshire, on 17 August 1765. He was the elder half-brother of generals <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13712/', "Sir Alexander Hope")</script> and Charles Hope (<i>d</i>. 1825). Educated at home, he travelled on the continent with his brother Alexander and their tutor, Dr John Gillies, who later became the historiographer royal for Scotland.<br>
<br>Hope is reported to have served for a short time as a volunteer. He was appointed cornet in the 10th light dragoons on 28 May 1784. He then became a lieutenant in the 100th foot, and later in the 27th Inniskillings, a captain in the 17th light dragoons (later lancers) in 1789, major in the 1st Royals foot in 1792, and lieutenant-colonel of the 25th foot on 26 April 1793. A tory, he was elected MP for Linlithgowshire in 1790, and again in 1796.<br>
<br>When the Mediterranean and channel fleets under lords Hood and Howe put to sea in April&#150;July 1793 the 25th foot was one of the regiments that embarked so as to compensate for the shortfall in marines. Hope remained in headquarters at Plymouth until December 1794, by which time independent companies had been drafted into the regiment, increasing it to two battalions. On 9 February 1795 he sailed as commander of ten companies of the regiment for the West Indies. On reaching Grenada on 30 March he was invalided home. He returned to the West Indies in 1796 as adjutant-general under Sir Ralph Abercromby. He took part in the capture of the French and Spanish West Indies in 1796&#150;7, and was repeatedly praised by Abercromby and other senior officers. He returned home in 1797.<br>
<br>In August 1799 Hope was deputy adjutant-general of the advanced force sent to the Netherlands under Abercromby. However he received a severe wound in the ankle during the landing on The Helder, and was sent home. On 27 August 1799 he was promoted from the 25th foot to colonel of the North Lowland fencible infantry (raised in 1794 and disbanded in 1802). At the end of September he returned to the Netherlands as adjutant-general of the main body of the expeditionary force under the duke of York. He was present at the second battle of Bergen (2 October) and the battle of Castricum (6 October). He was also one of the officers assigned to arrange the convention of Alkmaar.<br>
<br>Hope was adjutant-general to Abercromby in the Mediterranean in 1800, and in the Egyptian expedition of 1801. At the battle of Abu Qir (20 and 21 March) Hope was severely wounded; Abercromby was killed. On his recovery he asked for the command of a brigade, and was appointed to one composed of two of the army's most distinguished regiments, the 28th foot and 42nd highlanders. His brigade joined the army outside Cairo, and he was sent by General Hutchinson to arrange the terms of surrender of the French garrison. He later did the same in Alexandria. Hope had married first, on 17 August 1798, his cousin, Elizabeth, fifth and youngest daughter of the Hon. Charles Hope-Vere of Craigiehall, and sister of John Hope (1739&#150;1785). She died childless on 20 March 1801. He married second on 9 February 1803, Louisa Dorothea (<i>d</i>. 1836), daughter of Sir John Wedderburn, bt. They had eleven children.<br>
<br>Hope became a major-general in 1803, commanded a brigade in the eastern district of England under Sir J. H. Craig during the invasion alarms of 1803&#150;5, and in 1805 was appointed lieutenant-governor of Portsmouth, resigning in the same year to join the expedition to Hanover under Lord Cathcart. He became a lieutenant-general in 1808, was deputy commander of the troops sent to Sweden under Sir John Moore, and in August 1808 he landed in Portugal. He was in command at Lisbon when the French evacuated the city, and had the difficult task of restraining the local population from exacting revenge upon their erstwhile occupier. He was present during the negotiations of the controversial convention of Cintra (24 August 1808).<br>
<br>When Moore advanced into Spain, Hope commanded one of the army's two divisions. Having crossed the River Tagus he was forced to make a circuitous 380-mile journey through Elvas, Badajoz, Talavera, and Escorial with all twenty-four of Moore's guns, his trains and his few cavalry. During this period Hope negotiated with representatives of the Spanish junta, but refused to take his troops into Madrid. He linked up with Moore near Salamanca on 4 December and confirmed that Napoleon was concentrating on Madrid and had no immediate intention of moving west. Hope then took part in the retreat to Corunna. He commanded the British left at the battle of Corunna (January 1809), and succeeded to overall command when Moore fell and Baird was wounded. He &#145;wisely decided to pursue the object for which the battle had been fought, a safe re-embarkation&#146;  (Fortescue, <span class="italic">Brit. army</span>, 6.390). It is said that he personally visited every street in the port, to ensure that no one was left behind. He received the thanks of parliament, and was made a KB.<br>
<br>Hope commanded the reserve in the Walcheren expedition of 1809. Landing at Ter Goes he took up a position from which the western Scheldt was covered for the duration of the operations. He realized after only a few days that the expedition's objectives were unattainable. In 1812 he became commander of the forces in Ireland. In 1813 he was appointed to succeed Sir Thomas Graham in the Peninsular army. Instructions were received that he was to be given the command of at least a division and placed next in seniority to Wellington, though not his second in command. Hope commanded the first division at the battle of Nivelle (10 November) and at the battles of the Nive (10&#150;13 December) in which he was wounded. Wellington wrote of him: &#145;I have long entertained the highest opinion of Sir John Hope, like everybody else, I suppose, but every day more convinces me of his worth. We shall lose him if he continues to expose himself as he did during the last three days. Indeed, his escape was wonderful. His coat and hat were shot through in many places, besides the wound in his leg. He places himself among the sharpshooters, without sheltering himself as they do&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dispatches of the Duke of Wellington</span>, 203).<br>
<br>In February 1814 Hope, with the left wing of the army, crossed the Adour. The operation to cross the river was beset with difficulties, and the French forces opposing the crossing were intimidated by the use of the Congreve rocket. Hope next blockaded the important fortress of Bayonne, an operation that lasted until the end of the war. In the final sortie of the French garrison on 14 April 1814, a futile gesture which caused needless bloodshed given that a truce had been agreed elsewhere, Hope had his horse shot under him, was wounded, and briefly taken prisoner. The surrender did not take place until 27 April &#145;thanks to an obdurate Bonapartist commander who demanded to see Soult's written orders&#146; first  (James, 236).<br>
<br>Hope's wounds prevented him from accepting command of the forces sent to America in 1814. After the war Hope was made a peer as Baron Niddry of Niddry Castle, Linlithgowshire. In 1816 he succeeded his elder half-brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13723/', "James Hope-Johnstone, third earl of Hopetoun")</script>, in the family title. He became a full general in 1819. He had been appointed colonel-commandant of a battalion of 60th Royal Americans in 1806; from this regiment he had transferred to the colonelcy of the 92nd Gordon Highlanders, and from the 92nd, in 1820, he was appointed colonel of the 42nd highlanders. Among his many offices were those of lord lieutenant of Linlithgowshire, governor of the Royal Bank of Scotland, and captain of the royal archers. In 1822 he was offered the post of lieutenant-general of the ordnance by Wellington, then master-general, but he declined it. Hopetoun's last public duty was to attend George IV, during the king's visit to Scotland in 1822, as captain of the royal archers and gold-stick for Scotland. He entertained the king at Hopetoun House during the visit.<br>
<br>The pupil and friend of Abercromby, the friend of Moore, and, in Wellington's words, &#145;the ablest man in the Peninsular army&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dispatches of the Duke of Wellington</span>, 7.22), Hopetoun also distinguished himself in civil life, in which his soldierly mien, polished bearing, high ideal of duty, and strong common sense rendered him generally popular. He died in Paris on 27 August 1823, and was buried in the family vault at Abercorn on 1 October.<br>
<br>The eldest of Hopetoun's nine sons succeeded him as fifth earl of Hopetoun. Others served in the navy and army. The youngest, Brigadier-General the Hon. Adrian Hope (1821&#150;1858), of the 60th rifles and 93rd highlanders, served until distinction in the Crimea, and commanded a brigade at the siege of Lucknow, where he was killed on 14 April 1858.<br>
