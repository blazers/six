<span class="headword">Manningham,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1575&#150;1622), <span class="occ">lawyer and diarist</span>, was the son of Robert Manningham (<i>d</i>. 1588) of Fen Drayton, Cambridgeshire, and his wife, Joan, daughter of John Fisher of Bedlow, Buckinghamshire. After his father's death Manningham was formally adopted and made the heir of Richard Manningham, a prosperous, childless London mercer and the younger brother of the diarist's grandfather. John Manningham entered Magdalene College, Cambridge, in 1592 and graduated BA in 1596. On 16 March 1598 he began to study law at the Middle Temple, and on 7 June 1605 he was called to the degree of utter barrister. About one month later, on 16 July 1605, he married Anne (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1656), the sister of his Middle Temple chambermate Edward Curle. They had eight children.<br>
<br>Through inheritance and family connections Manningham led a successful and comfortable life. He practised law and had a position at the court of wards and liveries, probably obtained through his wife's father William Curle, who was auditor in that office. From Richard Manningham, John inherited the manor house of Bradbourne in East Malling, Kent, and throughout his life he kept his chambers at the Middle Temple. There he was apparently on the verge of rising to the office of reader at the time of his death in 1622.<br>
<br>From January 1602, his third year at the Middle Temple, until April 1603 Manningham regularly wrote down material of various sorts in a duodecimo copybook: anecdotes, poems, epitaphs, gossip, Inner Temple customs, jokes and witticisms, recipes, inscriptions, reactions to important public events, legal lore, brief accounts of his family, as well as many summaries (some very long) of sermons. By itself this pot-pourri gives only the cloudiest picture of life at the Middle Temple and London; a social historian requires such documents as Chamberlain's letters, the autobiography of Simonds D'Ewes, and James Whitelocke's recollections to give Manningham's entries sharper focus. But, as such material is pitifully scanty, readers are grateful for his record of wit combats among his fellow students, his account of the professional wisdom he gained from the eminent lawyers with whom he dined and studied at the Temple, and for mention of important historical events. Every Sunday Manningham heard one, often two, sermons at locations all over London, and he devoted at least one-third of the copybook to detailed summaries of them, recording them in an unquestioning, meticulous manner. Manningham rarely expressed his personal views on this, as on most other topics; he was primarily a reporter who apparently found everything interesting.<br>
<br>Unquestionably the most valuable of the entries are those concerning Shakespeare. Manningham records that on 2 February 1602, at the Middle Temple Candlemas day feast, &#145;wee had a play called &#145;Twelve Night, or what you will&#146;&#146;. Few of Shakespeare's plays can be so precisely placed and dated. What is equally enlightening are Manningham's next words: &#145;much like the commedy of errores, or <span class="roman">Menechmi</span> in Plautus, but most like and neere to that in Italian called <span class="roman">Inganni</span>&#146;. Manningham, hardly an aesthete or even a regular theatregoer, instantly recalled an earlier play by Shakespeare, recognized the source in Plautus, and the similarity to a relatively recent Italian play. Moreover he was appreciative of the playwright's &#145;good practise&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, ed. Sorlien, 48) in concocting the plot against Malvolio. It is apparent from that brief paragraph that Shakespeare could rely on at least a portion of his oft-maligned audience to be appreciative of his best efforts.<br>
<br>Manningham's other mention of Shakespeare is in the fabliau-like story he heard from an older Templar, William Towse. It seems that the actor Richard Burbage, while playing Richard III, was overheard by Shakespeare making an assignation with a lady. Shakespeare usurped his place and was &#145;at his game&#146; when Burbage announced his arrival with the agreed &#145;Richard III&#146;. To him Shakespeare sent the triumphant message &#145;William the Conquerour was before Richard the 3&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, ed. Sorlien, 75). At a time when Shakespeare's sexual orientation is much discussed, it is worth noting that the only contemporary gossip on the subject makes him out to be an amiable woman-chaser. Unlike most such allusions this one is precisely contemporary and the source, William Towse, was not a town gossip but a prominent and active bencher deemed responsible enough to be chosen treasurer, the highest office at the Inner Temple, in 1608 and a serjeant-at-law in 1614. (E. K. Chambers, <span class="italic">William Shakespeare</span>, 2.212, following W. W. Greg, reads the name of Manningham's informant as &#145;Curle&#146;, but R. P. Sorlien argues forcefully that the manuscript reads &#145;Touse&#146;.)<br>
<br>There are silly and boring passages in Manningham's diaries, but he was also capable of Elizabethan eloquence, as in his description of the death of the queen that he heard from eyewitnesses: &#145;This morning about 3 at clocke hir Majestie departed this lyfe, mildly like a lambe, easily like a ripe apple from the tree&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, ed. Sorlien, 208). Similarly, Manningham captures the relief that was universally felt at the peaceful succession of King James:<blockquote>Noe tumult, noe contradiction, noe disorder in the city; every man went about his busines, as readylie, as peaceably, as securely, as though there had bin noe change, nor any newes ever heard of competitors. God be thanked, our king hath his right. (ibid., 209)</blockquote>Manningham was no Pepys, but he left invaluable documentation of an ordinary life in the legendary London of Donne, Bacon, and Shakespeare. Manningham died at Bradbourne Manor on 22 November 1622, and was buried at East Malling church.<br>
