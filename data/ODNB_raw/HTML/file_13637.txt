<span class="headword">Home,  Alexander</span>, first earl of Home  (<em>c.</em>1566&#150;1619), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13636/', "Alexander Home, fifth Lord Home (c.1525&#150;1575)")</script>, and his second wife, Lady Agnes Gray (<i>d</i>. 1583&times;6), daughter of Patrick, fourth Lord Gray, and widow of Robert Logan of Restalrig and Fastcastle, who later married Sir Thomas Lyon of Baldukie. Because of his involvement in rebel action on behalf of the exiled Mary, queen of Scots, the fifth Lord Home and Alexander, as master of Home, took the unusual step of choosing curators for their estates on 16 February 1571, but to no avail as the lands and title were forfeited in October 1573. The younger Alexander Home was at St Leonard's College, St Andrews, in 1578&#150;9, but did not take a degree. He was restored to his father's estates and title, as sixth Lord Home, by parliament on 25 July 1578 and was retoured heir to these lands on 18 August 1579. Probably as part of the restitution deal his ward and marriage had been granted on 6 August 1578 to William, Lord Ruthven, who acted with Home's tutor Andrew Home as curator for his estates until he was twenty-one. Andrew Ker of Faldonside had held the lease of most of the Home estates during the forfeiture and had resisted the temptation to asset-strip the properties because of his friendship with Home's father. Others who benefited from the fifth lord's downfall, including kinsmen and even the new sixth Lord Home's stepfather, were, however, less willing to return his property. Home took back the semi-ruinous Hume Castle by force and used the privy council to evict the others.<br>
<br>In 1581, although only fifteen, Home attended his first of many sittings of parliament and assumed his father's roles as warden of the Scottish east march, sheriff of Berwickshire, and bailiff of Lauderdale. In the following year the privy council ordered him to hold his first judiciary court. Home had shown early responsibility by arbitrating a feud between some of the Homes and the Niddries of Wauchope in 1580, yet he became embroiled in the infamous 1582&#150;3 Ruthven raid that kidnapped the young King James VI from the earl of Lennox's faction, probably owing to his being a ward of Lord Ruthven, now earl of Gowrie. Gowrie imposed his feudal rights to arrange the marriage of his ward. On 31 May 1582 Gowrie proffered either Lilias or Dorothy, his daughters. Home's aunt Mary Gray had refused Gowrie's hand in the 1560s and Home now rejected his daughters. On 9 January 1586 he married Christian (<i>d</i>. 1604), daughter of William Douglas of Lochleven (earl of Morton from 1588) and widow of Lawrence, master of Oliphant. Her tocher (dowry) was a mere thirty chalders of victual from the Oliphant estates and though Christian had children by her first marriage, she had none during her second union. This may have been linked to irreconcilable social and religious differences as Home would have children from his second marriage. According to court gossip in October 1595 there was &#145;appearance of a seperacon between my Lord Home and my Lady who hathe taken the platte and beste stuffe at Dunglass and caryed with her to fife to her lyving there&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 52/57/37).<br>
<br>In 1584 Home was warded in Tantallon Castle by order of the earl of Arran, chancellor of Scotland, for his part in various property disputes and feuds. Resentment at this led to Home's involvement with the return of the banished protestant lords in 1585, who subsequently toppled Arran's regime. By 1587 Home was in trouble again as he challenged to combat Lord Fleming, brother-in-law of Home's territorial rival Maitland of Thirlestane. However, the most damaging alliance for Home was his turbulent on-off friendship with the maverick earl of Bothwell. From 1583 to 1593 both their petty feuding and Home's reconciliations with the eventually outlawed earl alarmed the government. Home was warded several times and even ordered to remain within his Scottish east march during 1589&#150;90, when the king sailed to Denmark to collect his bride, Princess Anne. He foolishly joined Bothwell's rebel band in 1591, yet by July the lure of Bothwell's escheat and the advice of kinsmen made it politically expedient for Home to make his peace with the king. James also insisted that he sign a bond of friendship with Maitland to prevent further trouble in the borders. The Homes of Huttonhall, Broxmouth, North Berwick, and Wedderburn did not want Home to suffer the same fate as his father and probably instigated Home's self-imposed exile during 1591&#150;2 which kept him far from Bothwell's influence and Maitland's meddling. James welcomed Home upon his return and bestowed lands and honours on him for forsaking Bothwell's allegiance. These included the lands of Coldingham Priory and the offices of privy councillor, grand master stabler, gentleman of the bedchamber, and captain of the king's guard. He was, in addition, a lord of the articles at the parliaments of 1593, 1594, and 1612. Home signed James VI's declaration against Bothwell in 1593 and was a commissioner to hound Bothwell out of his bounds in 1594. He had an inconclusive sortie with the disgraced earl near Edinburgh in April 1594, but 1595 saw both Bothwell's departure into exile and the death of Maitland of Thirlestane. These events gave Home great power in the borders and at court, but his triumphs would be marred by his adherence to Roman Catholicism.<br>
<br>Until 1588 Home's religious affiliation had not given cause for concern. Church authorities were beginning to suspect Home, though, for not repairing churches and for keeping well-known Jesuit sympathizers such as Andrew Clark and Thomas Tyrie in his household, and tried to have him cast out of royal circles. James VI, however, refused to be dictated to by the kirk and Home avoided the wrath of the presbytery of Dunbar by going abroad during 1591&#150;2. The presbytery of Edinburgh ordered him to appear before them in January 1593 when he &#145;professed himself a Catholik Roman, but desired conference&#146;  (Calderwood, 5.221). That October he was provocatively excommunicated by the synod of Fife against the express wishes of the king. He appeared before the general assembly on 17 May 1594 and absolved himself from excommunication by promising to adhere to protestantism. When the riding of parliament took place that month it was very obvious to the crowd that the king had placed Home at his left hand, a position of great honour. Evidence of royal favour was apparent at the baptismal celebrations for Prince Henry in August 1594, when Home carried a diamond crown in the procession and sat near Queen Anne at the banquet, and where his Turkish-attired team won the tournament.<br>
<br>Even so, the sceptical presbytery of Edinburgh alerted the presbytery of Duns to watch Home. They cited his shortcomings and excommunicated him in 1598 for killing William Lauder, who had murdered an ally of Home's in front of his stepsister, Lady Marischal. James VI could not persuade the kirk to change its mind so Home left the country for another year-long exile, taking both his protestant kinsman Alexander Home of Huttonhall and Thomas Tyrie with him. Lady Home stayed at home and there is no indication that she was ever Catholic. Home was never far from church scrutiny as he modified payments to the church from the third of benefices of Coldingham Priory and Jedburgh Abbey, of which he had become commendator in 1597. In 1602 the general assembly deliberately planted a minister in his household, but this was to no avail for Tyrie was still in his household in 1604. In 1606 the kirk ordered Home to remain in Edinburgh as &#145;a suspected Papist&#146;  (Calderwood, 6.248, 608). He continued to provoke the authority of the kirk by non-payment of taxes in 1607, though he shrewdly took the 1608 oath of allegiance to keep all his offices.<br>
<br>Home's lifelong service to the crown proved to be his ultimate defence against the kirk. He was James VI's ambassador to Henri IV of France between April 1599 and May 1600, and for three months in the autumn of 1602. He had been to France on four occasions between 1591 and 1602, which prompted the derogatory comment that he was &#145;sore grieved with the French pokis and being every year occasioned to go beyond sea for his health&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1597&#150;1603</i>, p. 1017). He was praised for his diplomatic skills by Henri IV and received an audience with Queen Elizabeth I while travelling back to Scotland in 1602. She thanked him for his excellent border service as an exemplary warden of the generally peaceful Scottish east march who never failed to give good justice to his opposite English wardens. Home had salvaged Anglo-Scottish friendship after a disastrous day of truce in 1597 when, during a fracas, he gathered his kinsmen around the English commissioners to protect them, escorted them into Scotland for hospitality, and persuaded the worst Scottish middle march recalcitrants to hand themselves over to the English commissioners after this event.<br>
<br>After the union of the crowns Home was a natural candidate to be lieutenant and justiciar over all three Scottish marches. He was appointed on 7 July 1603 and set about his wide-ranging commission from August 1603, after he returned from accompanying James VI and I to London. He had no qualms about torturing and executing persistent thieves, which made him few friends outside his east march domain. The Maxwells and Armstrongs, for instance, attacked some of Home's property and tenants in retribution for his actions. Although his Catholicism lost him this office in 1607 he returned in 1618 to lead the Scottish commissioners in a new commission for the pacification of the so-called middle shires and remained active in border affairs until his death. Much of the credit for the eventual pacification of the marches belongs to Home and his deputies.<br>
<br>In 1603 James VI and I spent the first night of his journey to England at Home's house of Dunglass. Home was rewarded in 1605 with the new British title of earl of Home&#151;for reasons unknown he had turned down the Scottish earldom of March in 1600. As a mark of favour his ecclesiastical properties at Jedburgh and Canonbie were amalgamated into a temporal lordship in 1606, with Coldingham and various kirklands being officially added to the lordship in 1610. He was possibly made an English privy councillor at Theobalds in May 1603. Home remained an active member of the Scottish privy council, yet his overall political powers were in slow decline after 1603. He acknowledged that he had become a client of his kinsman the supremely ascendant earl of Dunbar and after Dunbar's death in 1611 sought the patronage of the earl of Salisbury. Salisbury's death in 1612 left him further removed from British court politics since he had no particular ties to the king's subsequent favourites, Somerset and Buckingham. The king still honoured Home during his return visit to Scotland in 1617 by spending his first night in Scotland at Dunglass, where Home's kinsman poet Alexander Home of Logie delivered an impressive welcome speech in Latin, after which Home lavishly entertained the king and his company.<br>
<br>As Home had no heirs at his first wife's death in 1604, he provided a tailzie of his titles to his closest kin, the Homes of Cowdenknowes. However, on 11 July 1605 he married Mary Sutton (1586&#150;1645), daughter of the ninth Lord Dudley. They had a happy marriage that produced two sons and two daughters. Home died in London on 5 April 1619, where he had gone to accompany his wife at the forthcoming funeral of Queen Anne. His body was brought back to Scotland and was buried in May at his family chapel in Dunglass collegiate church. He was succeeded by his eldest son, James, seventh Lord Home and second earl of Home. His widow remained in Edinburgh, building a magnificent house in the Canongate now known as Moray House.<br>
