<span class="headword">Murray,  Alexander Stuart</span>  (1841&#150;1904), <span class="occ">museum curator</span>, was born at Arbirlot, near Arbroath in Forfarshire, on 8 January 1841, the eldest son in a family of four sons and four daughters of George Murray (<i>b</i>. 1814), a tradesman, and his wife, Helen Margaret Sayles (<i>b</i>. 1819). His younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35162/', "George Robert Milne Murray (1858&#150;1911)")</script> was keeper of the department of botany at the British Museum from 1895 to 1905. After being educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, Murray attended Edinburgh University in 1863&#150;4, but did not graduate. He also attended Berlin University in 1865, where he studied philology and archaeology under August B&ouml;ckh, Emil H&uuml;bner, and August Wilhelm Zumpt; Henry Nettleship (1839&#150;1893) was a fellow student.<br>
<br>On 14 February 1867 Murray was appointed assistant in the department of Greek and Roman antiquities at the British Museum, under Charles T. Newton, then keeper. The Blacas and Castellani collections had just been purchased, and John Turtle Wood's excavations were in progress at Ephesus. Between 1867 and 1886 Murray worked energetically under Newton's direction, acquiring a close knowledge of the whole collection of Greek and Roman antiquities. In the first five years alone he entered in the museum's register over 5000 items from the Blacas and other collections and catalogued over 2000 bronzes. He was highly regarded by Newton (a notoriously strict judge of his subordinates), and contributed through his fluency in German to Newton's grasp of new archaeological research published in that language.<br>
<br>On 13 February 1886 Murray succeeded Newton as keeper of the department of Greek and Roman antiquities. The recent removal of the natural history collections to South Kensington, the completion of the new building known as the &#145;White wing&#146; at Bloomsbury, and other alterations had greatly increased the available space for the exhibition of antiquities. An additional gallery was allocated to the Elgin marbles, and a further reorganization of the galleries devoted to Greek and Roman antiquities became for many years Murray's main preoccupation. The objects were set out with greater consideration than before for effect and space, and at the same time all the fittings and labels were improved. Murray was always helpful to visitors to his department, and patiently answered the enquiries of correspondents.<br>
<br>For many years Murray made it a practice to visit the continent, especially Greece, Italy, Sicily, or Spain, gaining familiarity with important classical sites and foreign collections and with foreign archaeologists. The only occasions on which he took part in work in the field were in 1870, when he visited the site of Priene with Newton to copy Greek inscriptions, and in 1896, when he was temporarily in charge of the excavations at Enkomi (Salamis) in Cyprus. He subsequently wrote most of the Enkomi section of <span class="italic">The British Museum: Excavations in Cyprus</span> (1900).<br>
<br>Although Murray did not see through the press a departmental catalogue of his own, he was a careful reader and critic of all the publications of his assistants, and contributed introductions to several volumes by them. His text for <span class="italic">Terracotta Sarcophagi, Greek and Etruscan, in the British Museum</span> (1898) was vitiated by the later discovery that the &#145;Etruscan&#146; sarcophagus was a fake. Murray wrote widely on classical archaeology independently of his official work, and published among other works <span class="italic">A History of Greek Sculpture</span> (2 vols., 1880; 2nd edn, 1890), <span class="italic">The Sculptures of the Parthenon</span> (1903), based on lectures to the Royal Academy, and three other books on mythology and antiquities. He also contributed an excursus on the pottery of Cyprus to Luigi Palma di Cesnola's <span class="italic">Cyprus</span> (1877), and articles on a wide variety of topics to learned journals, to the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> and <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, and to the ninth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. His writings showed the breadth of his knowledge, and were full of observations on points of detail; but his contemporaries found his style difficult, and a century later his works were little read, apart from the Enkomi excavation report, which was reprinted in 1970. From 1879 all his work on early Greece was coloured by his reluctance to accept the early date for Mycenaean culture, which was gradually being established beyond controversy.<br>
<br>Murray was made LLD of Glasgow University in 1887. He was corresponding member of the Royal Prussian Academy and of the Acad&eacute;mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres of the French Institute, a member of the German Archaeological Institute, a fellow of both the Society of Antiquaries (1889) and the British Academy (1903), an honorary associate of the Royal Institute of British Archaeologists (1890) and a vice-president of the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies (1891).<br>
<br>Murray maintained through life his Scottish accent and his adherence to the presbyterian Church of Scotland. He was small in stature and somewhat quick-tempered&#151;on occasion outspoken to the point of offence&#151;but his underlying courtesy and warmth ensured his popularity. He was twice married: first on 21 December 1872 to Sarah Jane (Jenny) Handcock (<i>c</i>.1839&#150;1874), daughter of William Hill, a farmer, and second, on 5 April 1881, to Anne Murray Welsh (1836&#150;1922), youngest daughter of David and Jean Welsh, of Tillytoghills Farm, Fettercairn, Kincardineshire. There were no children by either marriage. Murray died of pneumonia at his official residence in the museum on 5 March 1904 and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery on 9 March 1904.<br>
