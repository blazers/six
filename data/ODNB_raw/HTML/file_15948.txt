<span class="headword">Lambton,  William</span>  (1753<span class="mult">x</span>69&#150;1823), <span class="occ">army officer and geodesist in India</span>, was born at Crosby Grange, near Northallerton, in the North Riding of Yorkshire. The date of his birth is a matter of some conjecture, and he seems to have been at some pains to keep both his birth and his parentage a mystery. Davison Ingledew gives his date of birth as 1756, Phillimore has 1753/1756, and Keay suggests some time in the 1760s. No parish registers have been found to answer the question conclusively, and Lambton's childhood remains obscure. It is assumed that his parents were of humble means. He is known to have had a sister, Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1827). He was educated at Borrowby, after which some neighbouring gentlemen and a clergyman entered him at the grammar school at Northallerton, where there was a foundation for four free scholars. He finished his education under the mathematician Dr Charles Hutton, though at which institute, if any, remains a mystery.<br>
<br>On 28 March 1781 Lambton was appointed ensign in Lord Fauconberg's foot, a &#145;provincial&#146; or home-service regiment. In 1782 he transferred with the rank of ensign to the 33rd (West Riding) regiment, later the 1st battalion duke of Wellington's regiment, and joined the regiment in New York. While serving with the 33rd he was, according to some reports, briefly taken prisoner at Yorktown. In 1783 he went with the 33rd to Nova Scotia and subsequently New Brunswick. On 9 May 1784 he was promoted lieutenant. The following year he was appointed barrack-master at Saint John, New Brunswick, by both the war office and the Board of Ordnance. Since it was a double appointment, his post of barrack-master carried a double salary, namely &pound;400 per annum. In New Brunswick Lambton helped divide and allot land to British loyalist refugees from the United States and was involved in surveying and delineating the boundary between the United States and Canada. While observing a solar eclipse in Canada he failed to attach a smoked glass lens to his telescope and suffered permanent damage to his left eye, which thereafter gave him a rather distracted and glazed expression. During the period he was surveying in New Brunswick a mountain was named Lambton's Mountain after or by him. This name appears on some early maps, but the peak later became known as Big Bald Mountain. In 1795 Lambton's regiment was ordered home, but he remained in Canada, apparently because family responsibilities would not allow him to relinquish his large salary.<br>
<br>The 33rd regiment was ordered to the East Indies in 1796, and Lambton was then obliged to choose between his civil and military positions. He chose to go to India with his regiment, which was then commanded by Arthur Wesley, later Wellesley. Lambton sailed for England and from there went with the regiment to the Cape in 1796, to Bengal in 1797, and subsequently to Madras in September 1798. He had not served with his regiment for twelve years and, though middle-aged, was still a lieutenant. Through a letter of introduction from his Canadian patron, Brooke Watson, to Sir Alured Clark, commander-in-chief in India, he soon secured the staff position of brigade major to the king's troops under Fort St George (1799). Two papers, on the &#145;Theory of walls&#146; and on the &#145;Maximum of mechanical power and the effects of machines in motion&#146;, were communicated by Lambton to the Asiatic Society about this time (<span class="italic">Asiatic Researches</span>, vol. 6). Both exhibit an impressive command of mathematics and astronomy, and this was noticed by Wesley, who became a useful patron, inviting Lambton to share his quarters in Madras. Lambton appears to have acquired his scientific knowledge through his own studies while in Canada.<br>
<br>Lambton served as brigade major to General David Baird in the expedition against Seringapatam, Tipu Sultan's stronghold, in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War. Lambton's ability to find directions by the stars saved his brigade during a night march in the course of the campaign, when Baird was mistakenly leading his troops south towards enemy lines rather than north to safety. Lambton corrected the mistake. After the storm and capture of Seringapatam on 4 May 1799, in which he played an active and very creditable part, Lambton accompanied his brigade in its march to secure the surrender of the hill forts in Mysore. His journal from August to December 1799 is among the Mornington papers (BL, Add. MS 13658). When the brigade was broken up Lambton was appointed brigade major of the troops on the Coromandel coast, antedated from 22 August 1799.<br>
<br>In 1799 Lambton presented a memorial to the governor of Madras in council, suggesting a trigonometrical survey connecting the Malabar and Coromandel coasts. Lambton stressed to the government the practical benefits which would flow from his geodetic survey: it would provide an extendable lattice into which more detailed but less geodetically accurate local or regional surveys could be fitted. No less pressing was his desire to &#145;accomplish a desideratum still more sublime, viz., to determine by actual measurement the magnitude and figure of the earth&#146;  (Phillimore, 2.250). It was this scientific end which finally secured approval for Lambton's scheme. The Madras governor, Edward Clive, engaged the support for the scheme of his uncle Nevil Maskelyne, the astronomer royal. Their backing won over an initially hostile James Rennell and secured moneys to fund and continue the survey, which, like all others, dramatically overran its budget. Colonel Colin Mackenzie had already secured permission to undertake a survey in Mysore. Mackenzie's survey had broad topographical aims, recording the historical, natural, and economic character of the area; Lambton's was strictly trigonometrical. The two surveys were authorized to proceed in co-operation with one another. Phillimore's account shows the two to have been on cordial terms and that they co-operated professionally. Edney, however, suggests that relations were far from cordial and that Mackenzie resented what he regarded as the undue favour shown to Lambton.<br>
<br>Lambton's survey proposals were approved on 6 February 1800, and he began work immediately. Between 1800 and 1802 he conducted a preliminary survey in Mysore, measuring a base-line at St Thomas's Mount, Madras, in 1802. His next task, between 1802 and 1803, was the measurement of a degree along the Coromandel coast. Between 1803 and 1806 he measured triangles across the peninsula from east to west and started the measurement of the central arc, then between 1806 and 1807 he took the triangulation down the south coast to Tanjore. From 1807 to 1810 he extended the central arc to Cape Comorin and undertook a general survey and the construction of a map of the southern part of the peninsula. Between 1811 and 1815 he extended the central arc through the ceded districts into Hyderabad, with a connection to the eastern coast at Guntur. In 1815 he measured his sixth base-line, at Bidar, extending his arc to this point. Lambton was exacting in the demands he made for instruments and punctilious in their use, modelling his instrumentation and practice on those of William Roy. His theodolite was by William Carey, once apprenticed to Jesse Ramsden, and modelled on that used by Roy. His chain was also modelled on Roy's. In 1817 he submitted his third report, which described his progress up to 1815. The composition of such reports, the making of astronomical observations, and particularly the computation to reduce errors made in field observations occupied more and more of his time, and he increasingly left fieldwork to his assistants.<br>
<br>Lambton became captain in the 33rd foot, without purchase, on 25 June 1806, and purchased his majority in the regiment on 1 March 1808. When the 33rd returned home from Madras in 1811, Lambton remained behind as superintendent of the Indian survey at the company's expense. He became lieutenant-colonel by brevet on 4 June 1814 and was placed on half pay in consequence of the reduction of the army on 25 December 1818. In June 1818 his survey was transferred from Madras to be under the control of the supreme government at Fort William and was named the great or grand trigonometrical survey (GTS) of India. Against the wishes of Colin Mackenzie, who since 1815 had been the first surveyor-general of India with authority over all the surveys in the three presidencies, and who had argued that the trigonometrical survey should also come under his authority, Lambton's GTS was thus answerable only to government and not to Mackenzie. Lambton was elected a corresponding member of the French Academy (1817) through the influence of his French former assistant John Warren, and a fellow of the Royal Society (1818) and of the Asiatic Society.<br>
<br>In 1818, his third report complete, Lambton proposed extending the arc northwards, and the government agreed Agra as an appropriate end point. With this in mind, in 1822 he began to move his headquarters from Hyderabad to Nagpur. But Lambton never reached Nagpur. He died of heart disease according to some reports, of pulmonary tuberculosis according to others, and of his doctor's treatment according to yet others, at Hinganghat, 50 miles south of Nagpur, on 20 or 26 January 1823 and was buried there at what later became the Christian cemetery. His fine instruments, library, and papers were disposed of hastily and against the express wishes of his assistants, notably George Everest, at a camp auction, and some autobiographical notes, numerous other private papers, and some of his instruments were lost. Everest, who had been appointed Lambton's chief assistant in 1817, describes him at that period as 6 feet tall, erect, well-formed, bony, and muscular. He was a fair-complexioned man, with blue eyes, and he seemed &#145;a tranquil and exceedingly good-humoured person, very fond of his joke, a great admirer of the fair sex, partial to singing glees and duets, and everything, in short, that promoted harmony and tended to make life pass easily&#146;  (Phillimore, 3.468).<br>
<br>Lambton died unmarried, but in his will he named two natural children, William Lambton (<i>b</i>. Pondicherry, 12 July 1809) and Eliza Lambton (<i>b</i>. Hyderabad, 6 August 1819), and their respective mothers, Kummerboo, an Indian Muslim woman, and Frances, a half-European, half-Indian woman. He had a second natural son, John William (<i>b</i>. 26 December 1820), whose mother may have been Frances, and who is thought to have died young. William and Eliza were bequeathed substantial legacies, their mothers nominal allowances. William also received his father's small theodolite and his silver case of mathematical instruments. The residue of his estate was bequeathed to the two sons of his sister Dorothy, then in Yorkshire. Lambton's will was disputed acrimoniously in chancery, with the two natural children claiming that their bequests had not been honoured, yet the one surviving residuary legatee was receiving moneys.<br>
<br>Lambton's great arc was, by the time of his death, nearly 10 degrees or over 700 miles long. It was longer than the European arc which Lambton so much admired, and a model of its time. It was Everest who completed the arc after Lambton's death, but the project was Lambton's, as was the dedication and skill which ensured the establishment of the GTS as the then foremost geodetic establishment in the world. Lambton's results reflected the prevailing limits on instrumentation, method, and scientific understanding of effects such as local attraction, and within fifty years were superseded by a retriangulation; but his achievement remained formidable and the foundation for the subsequent achievements of others.<br>
