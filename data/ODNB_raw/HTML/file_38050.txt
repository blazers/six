<span class="headword">Tauber <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Denemy]</span>,  Richard</span>  (1891&#150;1948), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born on 16 May 1891 in Linz, Austria. He was illegitimate and was baptized Richard Denemy after his mother's maiden name. His father, (Anton) Richard Tauber, was an actor, and his mother, Elisabeth Denemy (later Seiffert), played musical comedy roles. He studied at the conservatory in Frankfurt (1909&#150;11) and with Carl Beines in Freiburg, and made a youthful d&eacute;but in 1913 as Tamino in <span class="italic">The Magic Flute</span> at the Neues Stadt-Theater in Chemnitz, of which his father was director, with instant success. He was soon engaged on a five-year contract with the Dresden Opera, where he sang all the leading lyrical tenor parts. In 1915 he made his first appearance at the German Opera House, Berlin. From 1922 his career centred on Vienna, where he sang the classical repertory at the Staatsoper and operetta at the Theater an der Wien.<br>
<br>During the Mozart festivals in both Munich and Salzburg, Tauber became enormously popular as Tamino, Belmonte, and Don Ottavio. The famous Swedish Don Giovanni, John Forsell, declared that the young Tauber was the greatest Ottavio he had ever heard, and he was noted for the intense conviction with which he declaimed to his Donna Anna (in the German text then still generally in use, even at festivals) the solemn oath, &#145;Ich schw&ouml;re&#146;. Among his non-Mozartian roles those of Max in Weber's <span class="italic">Der Freisch&uuml;tz</span> and of Hans in the German version of Smetana's <span class="italic">The Bartered Bride</span> were especially successful.<br>
<br>Tauber's name and achievements became better known to the general public, however, in the sphere of lighter music: in operetta rather than in opera, and above all in the stage works of Franz Leh&aacute;r, in which he charmed thousands by his sympathetic tenor quality and by the grace and variety of his vocal inflections. The song &#145;You are my heart's delight&#146; from Leh&eacute;r's operetta <span class="italic">The Land of Smiles</span> (1929) was one of his most famous, and it was in this work that he first came to England in 1931. He also showed marked ability as a conductor with the London Philharmonic Orchestra and as a composer. His operetta <span class="italic">The Singing Dream</span> (1934) was a great success in Vienna, and his other works included the operetta <span class="italic">Old Chelsea</span> (1943) and an orchestral piece, <span class="italic">Sunshine Suite</span>. Except for a film version of Leoncavallo's <span class="italic">Pagliacci</span>, his film career was mainly an extension of his operetta activities.<br>
<br>It would not be quite true to claim that Tauber's wide experience of light music, and the strain of singing long parts, with numerous encores, throughout the week left no mark on either his style or his vocal chords, but he can be justly likened to two other similarly popular tenors, John McCormack and Tito Schipa, in his ability to return successfully to serious music until the end of his career. In 1938 and 1939 he appeared under Sir Thomas Beecham at Covent Garden in his three greatest Mozartian roles and in a German-language <span class="italic">Bartered Bride</span>, and after the war he insisted on taking part, with his old colleagues, the visiting Vienna State Opera, as Don Ottavio in a <span class="italic">Don Giovanni</span> at Covent Garden&#151;his final stage appearance in September 1947.<br>
<br>In appearance Tauber was not handsome, but genial. His first marriage, in 1927, to the operetta singer Carlotta Vanconti, was unsuccessful and led to protracted divorce proceedings, which were not finalized until 1936; in that year he married his second wife, the English stage and film actress, Diana Napier, and settled in England. He was naturalized British in 1940. After his death Diana Napier wrote (or collaborated in) three volumes of biography or memoirs. There were no children of either marriage. Tauber died from lung cancer on 8 January 1948 at the London Clinic, 20 Devonshire Place, London.<br>
