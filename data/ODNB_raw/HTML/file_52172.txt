<span class="headword">Eastfield, Sir  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1446), <span class="occ">merchant and mayor of London</span>, first appears in the records in 1419 as a mercer. He was probably the son of William Eastfield of Tickhill, Yorkshire, since in 1435 he acquired from Joan, widow of William Eastfield of Tickhill, the lands of her husband in Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, and Derbyshire. On 28 September 1420 he was appointed one of the collectors of tunnage and poundage at London (a position he held until at least 1427), and in the same year he was one of those nominated to hear differences which had arisen within the London Cutlers' Company. In 1422 he was elected sheriff of London, and already in that year was the object of complaints of harassment by Hanseatic merchants, which earned him a royal order to desist. In 1425 he became one of the wardens of the Mercers' Company, and in the following year was appointed one of the collectors of the wool subsidy at London. An alderman from 1423 until his death, by 1429, when he was elected mayor, he can be regarded as having reached the summit of London society. Eastfield was married twice: Juliana, presumably his first wife, was living in October 1437; his second wife was Alice.<br>
<br>Eastfield's greatest prominence, however, resulted from his position as a stapler&#151;a wool exporter&#151;which brought him into connection with royal finance. On 20 December 1430 he was promised repayment from clerical subsidies as one of a group of staplers, he being the only one named, who had lent the crown &pound;2333 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. On 24 April 1431 he was promised repayment from clerical subsidies as one of a consortium of eight men who had lent the crown 4000 marks. In 1435, together with Hamo Sutton and Hugh Dyke, he was promised repayment of a loan of 8000 marks, with preference as an exporter over others. This was an important instance of the crown's trying to break through the restrictive arrangements of the staple, and presumably Eastfield's participation made him a favourite with court and exchequer. He was responsible for loans of &pound;1000 in 1440&#150;41, &pound;1000 in 1443, &pound;500 in 1444&#150;5, and &pound;4800 in 1445. He was in fact the biggest individual lender to the crown during the 1440s. He was appointed one of the collectors of the tax imposed on landed property in January 1436. Less is known about him in the period 1436&#150;9, but he then leapt back into prominence, to be regarded in his later years as someone to be favoured: member of parliament for London in 1439 and again in 1441, he was knighted in 1439. He was granted &pound;40 a year from the issues of London and Middlesex in March 1443, and &pound;10 a year from Lincolnshire in May 1444. In July 1443 he received a licence to hunt in the royal parks in Essex and Middlesex. In 1442 and 1444 he was mentioned as mayor of the staple of Westminster. Between 1442 and 1444 he was one of the royal emissaries who negotiated with representatives of Holland, Zeeland, and Friesland over trade disputes. In 1445 there is mention of a necklace which the king had bought from him.<br>
<br>Eastfield died shortly before 13 May 1446; both his wives were deceased by July 1444. His will mentions a daughter Margaret, married to John Bohun. It also contains very considerable bequests to the London poor, to several religious orders, and to the repair of the bridge at Wallingford, and also a bequest of &pound;100 towards the maintenance of London highways. It shows him concerned to contribute to water conduits, especially at Aldermanbury, and in this respect he was remembered by Stow, particularly for piping water into the city from as far away as Paddington. He was also an important patron of the church of St Mary Aldermanbury, partially rebuilding it, adding a steeple, and founding a chantry at the altar of St George. He also gave a chalice to the church, and was himself buried there. The &#145;chapelayn for Maister Estfelde&#146; was mentioned in the acts of court of the Mercers' Company as late as 1525.<br>
