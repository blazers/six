<span class="headword">Ogilvie,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Iota]</span>  (1797&#150;1867), <span class="occ">lexicographer</span>, born on 17 April 1797 in the parish of Marnoch, Banffshire, was the son of William Ogilvie, crofter, and his wife, Ann Leslie, daughter of a farmer in a neighbouring parish. He received some elementary education at home, and attended the parish school for two quarters. Ogilvie then worked as a ploughman until he was twenty-one. In 1818, following an accident, one of his legs had to be amputated above the knee. Afterwards he taught successively in two subscription schools in the Banffshire parishes of Fordyce and Gamrie. At the same time, by intensive study and with the help of a neighbouring schoolmaster, he prepared for university, and in October 1824 entered Marischal College, Aberdeen. Having added to his income by private tuition he graduated MA on 14 April 1828. He remained in Aberdeen as a private tutor until 13 May 1831, when he was appointed mathematical master in Gordon's Hospital, an important educational establishment in the city. On 15 November 1842 Ogilvie married Susan Smart (<i>d</i>. 1853), daughter of a farmer near Stonehaven, Kincardineshire. Marischal College conferred on him the honorary degree of LLD on 15 January 1848. He retained his mastership until July 1859.<br>
<br>To the short-lived <span class="italic">Aberdeen Magazine</span> (1831&#150;2) Ogilvie contributed, under the signature Iota, ten spirited and amusing imitations of Horace in the Scottish dialect. In 1836 he worked on Blackie &amp; Son's annotated edition of Thomas Stackhouse's <span class="italic">History of the Bible</span>. Messrs Blackie engaged him in 1838 to revise and enlarge Webster's <span class="italic">English Dictionary</span>, the result being <span class="italic">The Imperial Dictionary, English, Technical, and Scientific</span>, issued in parts from 1847 onwards, and published complete in 1850, with a supplement in 1855. In 1863 Ogilvie issued an abridgement of the dictionary under the title <span class="italic">Comprehensive English Dictionary, Explanatory, Pronouncing, and Etymological</span>, with the pronunciation supplied by Richard Cull. In 1865 appeared the <span class="italic">Students' English Dictionary, Etymological, Pronouncing, and Explanatory</span>, in which etymology and definitions received special attention. Two features of all three dictionaries were their attention to science and technology and their engravings, the <span class="italic">Imperial</span> claiming to be the first after Bailey's to use pictorial illustrations. A modern evaluation regards it as &#145;a hugely competent work, very well-suited to its times, and one which enjoyed much success in subsequent editions. It marks the flowering of the encyclopaedic dictionary in Britain&#146;  (<span class="italic">International Encyclopedia of Lexicography</span>). Ogilvie's last work was a condensation of the <span class="italic">Students' English Dictionary</span> for use in schools (1867). An unfinished revision of <span class="italic">The Imperial Dictionary</span> was issued in 1882&#150;3 by Charles Annandale.<br>
<br>In his later years Ogilvie suffered a partial loss of sight, and after his retirement was almost blind. He died of typhoid fever at Aberdeen on 21 November 1867. His wife predeceased him on 20 May 1853, leaving two daughters and a son.<br>
