<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Calthorpe, Sir  Somerset Arthur Gough</span>  (1864&#150;1937), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in London on 23 December 1864, the second son of Lieutenant-General Somerset John Gough Calthorpe, seventh Baron Calthorpe (1831&#150;1912) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/106104/', "Calthorpe family")</script>], and his wife, Eliza Maria (<i>d</i>. 1919), daughter of Captain Frederick Chamier RN, and widow of Captain Frederick Crewe. He entered the navy as a cadet on the training ship <i>Britannia</i> in 1878 and was promoted to lieutenant in 1886. In 1895 Calthorpe served in naval brigades landed for punitive expeditions on first the west and later the east coast of Africa and was specially promoted to commander for his services on 1 January 1896. In 1900 Calthorpe married Annie Euphemia (<i>d</i>. 1952), daughter of Robert Dunsmuir of Victoria, British Columbia. They had no children.<br>
<br>Calthorpe was promoted to captain in 1902 and was naval attach&eacute; to Russia, Norway, and Sweden from 1902 to 1905, a period including the Russo-Japanese War, during which he concentrated on Russia. Calthorpe returned to command the armoured cruiser <i>Roxburgh</i> and later the battleship <i>Hindustan</i>. He was captain of the fleet and commodore first class to Admiral Sir William May in the Home Fleet (1909&#150;10), and was promoted rear-admiral in 1911. He was then rear-admiral in the 1st battle squadron (1912&#150;13), with his flag in the dreadnought <i>St Vincent</i>, and in 1912 was also an assessor on the wrecks commission inquiry into the loss of the <i>Titanic</i> and a member of the Board of Trade committee investigating methods of stowing, launching, and propelling ships' boats.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the First World War Calthorpe was rear- and then vice-admiral commanding the 2nd cruiser squadron (1914&#150;16), with his flag in the armoured cruiser <i>Shannon</i>. He left the Grand Fleet in 1916 shortly before the battle of Jutland to become second sea lord. In December 1916 he was appointed admiral commanding coastguard and reserves. Calthorpe had until this date a worthy but certainly not a spectacular career and both inside and outside the navy there was a certain amount of surprise when in August 1917 he was named commander-in-chief of British forces in the Mediterranean. He has been described as &#145;conscientious and hard-working, a good all-round officer who held no aces&#146;  (Marder, 2.13). Moreover, his past experience as an attach&eacute; and his Mediterranean command undoubtedly benefited from his fluency in French, the result of spending part of his boyhood in France.<br>
<br>The British had actually left command in the Mediterranean to the French at the beginning of the war anticipating that the decisive naval battle would be fought in northern waters. This proved to be an untenable situation after the German submarine campaign began in earnest. There were simply too many British interests in the Mediterranean to leave it to the French and Italians, whose anti-submarine resources and methods proved woefully inadequate. The British of necessity shouldered the greater portion of the anti-submarine war in the Mediterranean and in 1917 the position of British Mediterranean commander-in-chief was revived, subject to the overall authority of the French commander-in-chief, at the time Vice-Admiral Gauchet. The latter, however, was preoccupied with the French battle fleet at Corfu guarding the entrance of the Adriatic against a sortie by the Austrian fleet. His control was increasingly more theoretical than real. Calthorpe's command was essentially shore based, its most important feature presiding over an inter-allied commission in Malta established to co-ordinate the campaign against submarines. The British with the greatest resources and shipping interests played the leading role although allied co-operation was less than perfect, the French and Italians having a tendency to follow their own interests. Nevertheless an elaborate convoy organization was gradually established and losses to submarines were brought down to acceptable levels, although always painful. Calthorpe, relatively modest and unassuming and reportedly a bit unsure of himself at first, had difficulty establishing his authority over the various British commands extending from the Aegean to Gibraltar as the local commanders-in-chief had become used to a good deal of independence. But Calthorpe gradually grew tougher and more assertive. In late 1917 he nearly made a major error of judgement suggesting he did not really understand the dynamics of the convoy system. Discouraged by persistently high losses, he considered strengthening the Otranto barrage at the expense of convoy escorts. This would have been a waste of resources for the barrage was ineffective, but fortunately these proposals were blocked by convoy advocates at the Admiralty.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1918 the collapse of Russia created the danger that the Germans would gain possession of the Russian Black sea Fleet and French battleships were shifted to the Aegean giving a French admiral local command. This situation was unacceptable to the British government once Turkey seemed on the verge of collapse in the autumn of 1918 and Calthorpe was ordered to proceed to the Aegean and take personal command, reinforced by two dreadnoughts detached from the Grand Fleet. Consequently it was Calthorpe who, rigidly excluding the French from the proceedings, negotiated the armistice with the Turks signed at Mudros on 30 October. On 12 November Calthorpe, flying his flag in the dreadnought <i>Superb</i>, led the allied fleets through the Dardanelles to anchor off Constantinople the next day. Calthorpe was now, in addition to his naval duties, appointed British high commissioner at Constantinople responsible to the Foreign Office rather than the Admiralty. In this dual capacity for nine months he faced an incredibly complicated situation that included the Russian civil war and allied intervention in the Black Sea, allied rivalries over the remains of the Ottoman empire and the resurgence of Turkish nationalism. He was now at the height of his powers and proved to be a tough and shrewd negotiator who earned the appreciation of the Foreign Office by the time he relinquished his command in July 1919. The Foreign Office praised his clear political and economic reports on provinces outside of the allied occupation and his good relations with his allied colleagues.<br>
<br>Calthorpe was commander-in-chief, Portsmouth, from 1920 to 1923, and was first and principal aide-de-camp to George V from 1924 to 1925. He was also the first British naval representative on the permanent armaments commission of the League of Nations. Calthorpe, promoted to admiral of the fleet in 1925, was placed on the retired list in 1930. He was awarded a number of British and foreign decorations; he was appointed KCB (1916), GCMG (1918), and GCB (1922). He died on 27 July 1937 at his home, Woodlands Vale, Ryde, Isle of Wight.<br>
<br>Calthorpe was fated never to command a squadron or fleet in action. Nevertheless, when thrust into a position of great responsibility he performed far better than anticipated, particularly in confronting the diplomatic and political issues that went with his command.<br>
