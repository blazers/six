<span class="headword">Cort,  Henry Francis  de</span>  (1742&#150;1810), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born at Antwerp, and first studied painting under W. Herreyns. On 16 May 1769 he entered the studio of the landscape painter Hendrik Joseph Antonissen, and on 16 May 1770 he was admitted a master in the guild of St Luke at Antwerp. His chief works were topographical paintings of towns and landscapes; in some of these he was assisted by his fellow pupil Ommeganek, who painted the figures for him. Leaving Antwerp he proceeded to Paris, entered the academy there, and was elected a fellow in 1781. There he painted some views of Chantilly, and was appointed painter to the prince de Cond&eacute;. In 1788 he returned to Antwerp, and took an active part in reorganizing the school of painting there, acting as secretary to the newly constituted academy. He contributed six pictures to the first exhibition of the new academy held in 1789. Shortly after this he arrived in England, with some of his pictures, and in 1790 exhibited seven pictures at the Royal Academy. During the following twelve years he contributed numerous landscapes to the Royal Academy, particularly of the west of England. A total of sixty-three paintings were exhibited. In 1806 he contributed three landscapes to the first exhibition of the British Institution. Although his status does not seem to have been very high, his landscapes were much valued by private collectors, being agreeably coloured and treated in the Italian manner, very much in vogue at the time. His sepia drawings were also much admired. G. H. Harlow was one of his pupils. He died in London on 28 June 1810, and was buried in St Pancras old cemetery.<br>
