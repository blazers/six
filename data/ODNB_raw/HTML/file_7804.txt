<span class="headword">Donaldson,  Joseph</span>  (1794&#150;1830), <span class="occ">soldier and surgeon</span>, was born in Glasgow, where his father was employed by a mercantile house. With some school companions he ran away to sea and made a voyage to the West Indies, which disenchanted him of a sea life, and he returned home and was sent back to school by his father. Early in 1809 he again ran away, and without communicating with his friends enlisted in the old 94th (Scotch, or Scots, brigade). He accompanied the regiment to Jersey, then to Spain, where it took part in the desperate defence of Fort Matagorda during the siege of Cadiz, and afterwards was with Picton's division in the principal battles and sieges in the Peninsula from 1811 to 1814. After the peace in 1814 the Scots brigade was stationed in Ireland, where it was disbanded in 1818, except for the 94th, which survived. In the meantime Donaldson married a young Irish girl, alluded to in some of his writings under the name of Mary MacCarthy; they had ten children.<br>
<br>Early in 1815 Donaldson was discharged as sergeant, at the age of twenty-one, at the expiration of his limited-service engagement. Returning to Glasgow with his wife, he made a little money by the publication of his <span class="italic">Scenes and Sketches in Ireland</span>. His hopes of obtaining employment in civil life having utterly failed, Donaldson went to London with his family, enlisted in the East India Company's service, and was employed as a recruiting-sergeant, at first in London and afterwards in Glasgow. Disliking this, he got himself transferred to the district staff, and was employed as head clerk in the Glasgow district staff office for some years, during which time he published his <span class="italic">Recollections of an Eventful Life, Chiefly Passed in the Army</span> and <span class="italic">The War in the Peninsula</span>.<br>
<br>While in London, Donaldson had found time to study anatomy and surgery, studies which he continued at Glasgow University. Having qualified as a surgeon, he took his discharge in 1827, and set up in medical practice at Oban in Argyll, where he remained until 1829, though with little success. He left his wife and children in Glasgow, and, hoping to improve his medical prospects, went to London and afterwards to Paris, where he died of pulmonary disease in October 1830, at the age of thirty-six. He was reported to have been a frequent anonymous contributor to the press. His three books, which give a vivid picture of soldier life in the Peninsula and in Ireland, were republished in 1855 as <span class="italic">Recollections of the Eventful Life of a Soldier</span> for the benefit of his widow and a surviving daughter, then in distressed circumstances in Glasgow.<br>
