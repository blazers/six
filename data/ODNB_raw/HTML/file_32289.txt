<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Carlile,  Wilson</span>  (1847&#150;1942), <span class="occ">founder of the Church Army</span>, was born on 14 January 1847 at Brixton, the eldest of the twelve children of Edward Carlile, a merchant in the City of London, where his father had settled, and whose forebears had for some generations been prominent in the civic and business life of Paisley. Wilson Carlile's mother was Maria Louisa, second daughter of Benjamin Wilson, a Yorkshireman who had come to London as a silk mercer and became master of the Haberdashers' Company. He was a second cousin of Sir R. W. Carlyle and A. J. Carlyle. Carlile's education was hampered by a spinal weakness from which he suffered throughout his long life and which prevented him from taking an active part in sports or exercises. After attending a private school at Brixton he entered his maternal grandfather's business at the age of thirteen, but shortly afterwards went for a year to school at Lille, where he became fluent in French. Of this he made good use during the Franco-Prussian War, when he travelled widely in France in order to take advantage of the unsettled state of the silk market. Later he learnt to speak German with equal facility and acquired a good knowledge of Italian. When Carlile came of age the business became his property and by 1873 he had laid the foundations of a small fortune when a slump ruined him.<br>
<br>A serious illness supervened and turned Carlile's thoughts to religion, in which his interest hitherto had been no more than conventional. His parents, who had been devout Congregationalists, had recently joined the Church of England in which, on recovery, Carlile was confirmed after a brief attraction to the (Plymouth) Brethren. He was now in partnership with his father, giving his spare time to mission work in the parish of Holy Trinity, Richmond, where his family had settled. Having great musical ability he also acted as deputy organist to Ira D. Sankey during the great Moody and Sankey missions of 1875, and this brought him in touch with the leading evangelists of the day. In 1878 Carlile gave up his business in order to be trained for holy orders at St John's College, Highbury. He was ordained deacon in 1880 and priest in 1881, being appointed in the former year curate at St Mary Abbots Church, Kensington. The happy association of ten or twelve curates of widely different views under Edward Carr Glyn, later bishop of Peterborough, greatly influenced Carlile when he founded the Church Army as a strictly non-party society within the Church of England. He was profoundly concerned by the lack of contact between the church and the working classes, and by the absence of opportunities for working-class Anglicans to play an active part in the church's life and mission. He began open-air meetings in which the help of working men and women was enlisted, and which eventually caused so much obstruction to traffic that in June 1882 he was asked to give them up. Indoor meetings, held in the parish school and making use of magic-lantern slides, also attracted working people.<br>
<br>In 1882 Carlile resigned his curacy and founded the Church Army which (like the Salvation Army begun four years earlier), in its early days in the slums of Westminster, met with great violence. Two or three times Carlile was gravely injured, yet not infrequently his roughest opponents came to be his greatest helpers. Opposition came also from within the church, where many disliked his unconventional methods. But the movement grew, and the success which soon came was due in no small degree to Carlile's wise decision to devolve many responsible duties to his workers. In 1884 a Church Army training college was established at Oxford, in which working men, without cost to themselves, were trained to be full-time evangelists; in 1887 a similar college for women workers was opened in west London, where for many years women were trained by Carlile's sister, Marie Louise Carlile. Under an order of convocation made in 1897 the male students were admitted, on the successful conclusion of their training, by the bishop of London to the &#145;office of Evangelist in the Church of God&#146; and by this specially created office the Church Army workers obtained an official status, which was extended to women in 1921. During the war of 1914&#150;18 the Church Army was engaged in extensive work with British troops in the various theatres of conflict.<br>
<br>Carlile based his organization on the unit of the parish, in which there was a &#145;corps&#146; of Church Army members who, under the guidance of Church Army officers, were required to bear private and public testimony to their faith. During a serious illness in 1926 Carlile conceived the idea that every parish, including those without any trained Church Army officer, should organize its members into corps or news teams, and this method received official support after his death. By building up the largest lay society within the Church of England Carlile not only greatly increased opportunities for the laity to participate in the work of the church but also stimulated similar efforts inside the church, independent of the Church Army (for example, in the increasing role given to lay readers). His influence on the evangelistic side of the Church of England was therefore very great. His social work was equally influential. In 1889 he established Church Army homes for ex-prisoners, tramps, and others on the margins of society, and two or three times each winter week he would spend the night on the Thames Embankment; sometimes up to 2000 homeless men and women would gather for Church Army food and shelter. This and other aspects of his social work were criticized by committed socialists on the grounds that they were only palliatives. The fact remains that Carlile's efforts not only alleviated a great amount of misery but did much to rouse the social conscience by publicizing the plight of those suffering desperate poverty, homelessness, and unemployment to middle-class Anglicans who lived in the comfort of the suburbs. By practical help, and not by platform eloquence, he drew public attention, for instance, to the problem of overcrowding in the 1920s. As a result of his appeals for gifts of money or loans at low interest nearly 1000 houses were built for large families with small incomes by the Church Army Housing Ltd, one of the precursors of the housing association movement.<br>
<br>In collaboration with his eldest son, Victor, Carlile wrote <span class="italic">The Continental Outcast</span> (1906), an account of a tour of labour colonies and other establishments in Denmark, Belgium, Holland, and Germany. He also composed a simple choral communion service which was widely used. In 1891 he was presented to the rectory of St Mary-at-Hill, an empty City church which he filled to overflowing before he retired in 1926, retaining a connection as honorary curate. Meanwhile the success of the work of the Church Army brought him honours from both church and state. In 1906 he was appointed a prebendary of St Paul's Cathedral; he received an honorary DD in 1915 from the University of Oxford and in 1926 from the University of Toronto. In 1926 he was appointed CH. In 1870 Carlile had married Flora (<i>d</i>. 1925), daughter of Thomas Vickers, lawyer, of Brixton; they had five sons. His grandson, the Revd E. Wilson Carlile, became chief secretary of the Church Army in 1949. Wilson Carlile died at his home, Kingsbury, Coley Avenue, Woking, on 26 September 1942; his funeral on 2 October was held at St Paul's Cathedral.<br>
