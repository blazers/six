<span class="headword">Macadam,  Elizabeth</span>  (1871&#150;1948), <span class="occ">social worker</span>, was born on 10 October 1871, in the village of Chryston outside Glasgow, to the Revd Thomas Macadam, a minister of the Free Church of Scotland, and his wife, Elizabeth Whyte. Her girlhood was spent partly in Canada, where her father was first minister of St Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Strathroy, Ontario, and then professor of political philosophy at Morrin College, a small Presbyterian college in Quebec City. She was educated at Strathroy high school and attended classes at Morrin College. Their mother having died and their father having retired to Toronto, Elizabeth and her sister Margaret returned to Scotland as young women, and lived for a time in the household of their maternal uncle, the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36886/', "Revd Alexander Whyte")</script>, then minister of St George's Free Church in Edinburgh.<br>
<br>It is not known how Elizabeth Macadam came to decide upon a career in social work, or to move to London, but in 1898, having acquired some experience of kindergarten work in Germany and having lived for a time at the women's settlement in Canning Town, she was awarded one of the newly endowed Pfeiffer scholarships to train in social work at the Women's University Settlement in Southwark. She remained at the settlement for four years, taking part in district visiting and other programmes developed by the settlement, and running an evening school for about a hundred &#145;rough&#146; adolescent boys and girls, for which work she was paid a salary by the local school board.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Macadam's chance to make an original contribution to the development of social work as a practice and a profession came in 1902, when she was hired to take over the wardenship of the Victoria Women's Settlement in Liverpool, a position she held until 1910. Assisted by Emily Oliver Jones, who had also trained at the Women's University Settlement, and by Eleanor Rathbone, she not only improved the settlement's organization and finances but also altered its philosophy and direction. First, she began to transform the settlement into, in her words, &#145;a laboratory for experiments in social reform&#146;&#151;and indeed the dispensaries, clinics, clubs, and classes for disabled children pioneered by the settlement both stimulated demand for and served as the core of later statutory municipal services. Second, her horror of the &#145;uncertain, hap-hazard efforts&#146; of private benevolence led her to place great importance on the development of social work as a profession. In 1904 the settlement launched a training programme for social workers that combined lectures on poverty, child welfare, and civic administration with a course of practical work undertaken in collaboration with municipal and voluntary associations. In 1910 Liverpool University absorbed this programme and appointed Elizabeth Macadam as the first lecturer on the methods and practice of social work; by the outbreak of the First World War, this course had more than a hundred students.<br>
<br>Having established a modest but solid reputation as an innovator in the field of social work, Elizabeth Macadam was asked by the wartime Ministry of Munitions to help devise training courses for welfare workers; she also served on the women's advisory committee to the liquor traffic control board. This work took her increasingly to London, and at the end of the war she and Eleanor Rathbone (who had become a close friend and companion) bought a house there together. From 1919 Elizabeth Macadam acted as secretary to a new Joint Universities Council for Social Science, which had been established to co-ordinate the training of social workers. She also wrote several significant works on the development of this new field, publishing an authoritative study of the evolution of training for social work in 1925 (<span class="italic">The Equipment of the Social Worker</span>), an intelligent survey of the complex and evolving relations between state and voluntary efforts in 1934 (<span class="italic">The New Philanthropy</span>), and a revised edition of the first book in 1945.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Macadam assumed that the end of the First World War would inaugurate a new partnership between the state and the voluntary sector, and that trained social workers like herself would be called upon to help plan the work of reconstruction. Yet new opportunities were slow to develop, and during the last twenty-five years of her life she spent much of her time supporting Eleanor Rathbone's expanding and complex political career. Macadam's public commitments increasingly came to mirror those of Rathbone: thus, after Rathbone became president of the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship (NUSEC) in 1919, Macadam became a NUSEC officer and an editor of its paper, the <span class="italic">Woman's Leader</span>; likewise, Macadam helped to run the campaign for family endowment (family allowances) which Rathbone spearheaded. Rathbone was the stronger intellect of the two and was often in the public eye, yet archival records show that the two friends collaborated closely; certainly some portion of Rathbone's considerable public achievement was aided by Macadam's steady support and careful organization of both Rathbone's parliamentary campaigns and their joint life. This relationship is hard to capture, for both women were reserved about their private lives and maintained officially separate public careers. Yet their personalities, dissimilar as they were, were complementary, and the two were extremely close. Elizabeth&#151;practical, organized, demanding, and even somewhat bossy&#151;kept the more abstracted and emotionally diffident Eleanor on track, and was probably the only person with whom Eleanor felt entirely comfortable. The two friends continued to share a house in London until Rathbone's sudden death in January 1946. Having never ceased to regard herself as a Scotswoman, Elizabeth Macadam returned to Edinburgh for the last two years of her life. She died of cancer at her home, 7 Nile Grove, on 25 October 1948.<br>
