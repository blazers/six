<span class="headword">Bracken,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1697, <em>d.</em> 1764), <span class="occ">writer on farriery and surgeon</span>, was baptized on 31 October 1697 at St Mary, Lancaster, the son of Henry Bracken, a local innkeeper who held a number of minor offices with the Lancaster corporation. After a grammar-school education at Lancaster he was apprenticed to Dr Thomas Worthington, a Wigan physician. At the end of his apprenticeship about 1717, Bracken went to London and spent a few months as a pupil of St Thomas's Hospital but was disappointed with the lack of cadavers. He next went to Paris to the H&ocirc;tel Dieu where he found plenty of opportunity for dissection and was able to attend midwifery cases through the intercession of the English ambassador, the earl of Stair. On 29 August 1730 he matriculated at the University of Leiden, where he attended Boerhaave's lectures for eighteen months, though this was in a non-graduate capacity. After an unsuccessful attempt to establish himself in London, Bracken set himself up as a physician, surgeon, and man-midwife in Lancaster. Bracken married Ann Hopkins in January 1720 and may have been the Henry Bracken who married Susannah X. Bracken about 1725.<br>
<br>Having already written on both human and equine medicine, Bracken published his most famous and best-selling work, <span class="italic">Farriery Improved, or, A Compleat Treatise upon the Art of Farriery</span> (1737), which was reissued in two volumes the next year. Its popularity sprang from Bracken's robust language and common-sense solutions, which were grounded as much in his firsthand knowledge of the general care and feeding of horses, as in his application of Newtonian medicine to their treatment. The work ran to twelve editions. Bracken also published several other popular works on farriery, a number of medical articles, and substantial monographs on midwifery and the stone.<br>
<br>Bracken experienced mixed fortunes in his public and private life. Between 1726 and 1731 he held a variety of offices for the Lancaster corporation, such as auditor, chamberlain, and bailiff, but was politically marginalized for most of the next two decades. During the 1730s he was also engaged in a protracted dispute with Peter Kennedy MD, the author of a treatise on the eye. During the Jacobite rising of 1745 Bracken sent information on Stuart sympathizers to General Wade  (TNA: PRO, SP 36/76, fols. 157<i>r</i>&#150;158<i>v</i>), but in January 1746 was himself imprisoned in Lancaster Castle, probably by tories angered by his apparent support for the Stuarts following the Jacobites' arrival in the town. His imprisonment was short-lived. He was discharged without trial, and it appears there were no grounds for his arrest. Personal tragedy followed. Bracken, who had already lost three infant daughters, now lost his only son to fever&#151;contracted when he had visited his father in prison. Bracken recovered from his setbacks and was elected mayor of Lancaster in 1748 and again in 1758. He died at Lancaster on 13 November 1764.<br>
