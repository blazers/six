<span class="headword">Stanhope,  Edward</span>  (1840&#150;1893), <span class="occ">politician</span>, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26256/', "Philip Henry Stanhope, fifth Earl Stanhope (1805&#150;1875)")</script>, the historian, and his wife, Emily Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1873), second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15472/', "Sir Edward Kerrison, bt")</script>, was born at his father's house in Grosvenor Place, London, on 24 September 1840. After some tuition at a private school in Brighton, he entered Harrow School, under the headmastership of Dr Vaughan, in September 1852. At Harrow he won the Neeld medal for mathematics in 1859. Though of slight physique, he more than held his own in athletic sports and games. Stanhope was a member of the celebrated cricket eleven of 1859, when Harrow defeated Eton College by an innings. He was a first-rate rugby football player, shot extremely well, and was fond of fishing. Stanhope left Harrow at midsummer 1859, and went up to Christ Church, Oxford, in the following October. Pursuing his natural bent towards mathematics, he obtained a first class in mathematical moderations in Michaelmas term 1861. Being destined for the bar, he went in for a pass in classics in Easter term 1862, and the examiners paid him the compliment of an &#145;honorary fourth&#146;. Despite his fourth class the following November he was elected to a fellowship at All Souls. With his brother he visited the United States, both North and South, during the civil war. He then began his legal studies in London, and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple on 1 May 1865. He joined the home circuit, but his practice was mainly at the parliamentary bar, where his clear elocution and power of lucid statement soon established his reputation. In 1868 he was appointed an assistant to the royal commission on agricultural employment, with the remit of especially inquiring into the employment of children, young persons, and women in agriculture. His report of 1869 exposed the conditions of cottage life in Dorset and provoked protests from the landed interest.<br>
<br>On 18 May 1870 Stanhope married Lucy Constance, youngest daughter of the Revd Thomas Egerton and niece of the first Baron Egerton of Tatton; they had no children.<br>
<br>Stanhope's ability impressed his father's first cousin, James Banks Stanhope (1821&#150;1904), a bachelor, who made him his heir, installed him in his house, Revesby Abbey, near Boston, and promoted his political career, supporting him for the normally safe tory seat of Mid-Lincolnshire at the general election in 1874, for which he was returned unopposed. He held the seat, which became the Horncastle division in 1885, until his death, unopposed except in 1886 and 1892. Stanhope did not have to be an assiduous MP and &#145;might as well have been a borough member, for all that he seemed to care about agricultural politics&#146;  (Olney, 238). Even so, he was quickly recognized as a coming man in the still understaffed tory party. He seconded the queen's speech address in 1875 with a notable oration, likened by Lord Randolph Churchill to a &#145;recitation from Gibbon&#146;; he was, Derby thought, &#145;able, popular, and deserves promotion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 248). On 18 November 1875 he was made parliamentary secretary to the Board of Trade, an office of immediate importance because of Samuel Plimsoll's crusade against the scandalous conditions in the merchant navy. Stanhope was placed in charge of the <span class="roman">Merchant Shipping Bill</span> of 1876 (replacing the temporary act of 1875), made a strong speech on the second reading (17 February 1876), and oversaw the act's administration.<br>
<br>On 6 April 1878 Stanhope was promoted to under-secretary of the India Office, serving under Gathorne Hardy at a time of great and unusual public interest in India. Hardy came to rely on Stanhope to defend the government in the Commons. He became an authority on Indian finance and twice presented the Indian budget, in 1878 and 1879, on the second occasion meeting the deficit in part by a significant expansion of Indian employment in the Indian Civil Service. On 9 December 1878 he defended the government in the important censure debate on the Afghan fiasco. Out of office in 1880, Stanhope was soon drawn into the internecine warfare within the tory party. He supported Northcote against the &#145;Fourth Party&#146; and began a long and rather acrimonious, nagging, tussle with Churchill. He was also a member of the central committee, and was given special responsibility for improving tory organization in the counties.<br>
<br>In Lord Salisbury's minority government of 1885&#150;6 Stanhope was initially vice-president of the committee of education with, unusually, a seat in the cabinet, and then, from 19 August, president of the Board of Trade. In the Salisbury government formed in August 1886, he was colonial secretary. In a brief space of time Stanhope had reached high office and was an important member of the government with the prospect of major office in the near future (he might have been foreign secretary in 1886, but for the opposition of Churchill). He at once made his mark, summoning the first colonial conference, which met in April 1887. He was also active in the Imperial Federation League (with his cousin Lord Rosebery), and became its president in September 1892. His time at the Colonial Office was brief, however, for in the reshuffle consequent on Lord Randolph Churchill's resignation in December 1886, Stanhope became, in January 1887, war secretary&#151;at a moment of crisis, for some anticipated war with France.<br>
<br>Though Stanhope was largely ignorant of military affairs and though these were an area of considerable potential danger to the government, Salisbury's style of leadership left him largely on his own at the War Office. This was especially daunting given the omnipresence of the energetically reactionary duke of Cambridge, the commander-in-chief, and the supposed reformer, Sir Garnet Wolseley, the adjutant-general. Stanhope in time found both difficult and his differences with each spilled out into criticism of him by the military members in the Commons in a series of rows, with information leaked by both Cambridge and Wolseley. St John Brodrick later observed of Stanhope's attempts to reform the War Office, &#145;under the circumstances it is a matter of wonder that Stanhope should have accomplished what he did&#146;  (Beckett, 298). The <span class="roman">Imperial Defence Act</span> of 1888 greatly improved coaling stations and military ports. The removal of the surveyor-general of the ordnance improved the muddle left by Cardwell's ambivalent structure within the War Office, and the Army Service Corps and other changes of supply laid the basis for the future. But the changes led to parliamentary concern and the appointment of the Hartington royal commission, which in 1891 recommended reconstruction of the War Office on the retirement of the commander-in-chief. Stanhope, however, did not seriously try to obtain Cambridge's retirement, which was finally achieved by his Liberal successor, Campbell-Bannerman. The Stanhope memorandum of 8 December 1888 set out the army's priorities and provided &#145;more direction in the last third of the nineteenth century than at any period in British military history&#146;  (Beckett, 299). Stanhope reformed the general officers' list and the system of promotion to general. He had the army camps at Aldershot, Shorncliffe, Strensall, and the Curragh rebuilt, and port garrisons were much improved. The Stanhope lines at Aldershot testified to this achievement for much of the next century, as did the Stanhope storehouses, part of the defences of London. He persuaded the major railway companies to participate in a scheme to employ reserve and discharged soldiers. He established the Wantage committee in April 1891 on imperial military arrangements, though he has been criticized for opposing its radical recommendations. His period at the War Office was not popular with his party, which, despite his caution over the Wantage report, thought him unduly iconoclastic and disliked many of the details of his reforms (such as the passing over for promotion of some generals in the reform of the list and his refusal to reopen the question of purchase of commissions). Stanhope's reforming zeal brought overstrain, exhaustion, and severe gout; he only managed to attend parliamentary discussions of the estimates in 1891 by dosing himself with colchium and he had to spend much of the spring of 1892 at the baths at Aix-les-Bains  (Beckett, 301). Stanhope went out of office with the Salisbury government in July 1892 a tired and sick man. The War Office and his health had ended Stanhope's reputation as a focus of leadership within the tory party and an antithesis to the Cecil faction. Despite his poor health, in the 1892 parliament he was elected chairman of the low-church group, speaking as such on establishmentarian issues in the <span class="roman">Parish Councils Bill</span> of 1893, and he was chairman of Lincolnshire county council, playing a leading part in the establishment of Woodhall spa.<br>
<br>Stanhope was a short man, with one shoulder markedly higher than the other. He was reserved, but an effective Commons debater. He enjoyed the estate at Revesby, making it available to his nephews and nieces (having no children of his own), and was a reforming farmer. He made a large collection of prints and caricatures of Pitt the younger which he thought would be his sole claim to posthumous fame. He was, from 1882, like his father a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery. In December 1893 he went to Chevening, his brother's house near Sevenoaks in Kent, to rest. He there suffered a very severe attack of gout and, after a partial rally, died from a heart attack on 21 December 1893. He was buried at Revesby Abbey. His wife survived him, dying on 24 October 1907.<br>
