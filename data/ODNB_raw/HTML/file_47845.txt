<span class="headword">Cattell,  (Fanny) Maud</span>  (1857&#150;1947), <span class="occ">nurse</span>, was born on 23 April 1857 at Sheldon, Warwickshire, the second of the ten children of John Cattell (<i>bap</i>. 1828, <i>d</i>. 1921), farmer, and his wife, Fanny Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1832, <i>d</i>. 1908), daughter of William Pate, farmer, of Haddenham, Cambridgeshire, and his wife, Mary. Known as Maud, she was probably educated at home by a governess. She learned housekeeping and cookery, and nursed family and friends, including her sister Emma Maria (1862&#150;1932), who fell off a donkey, permanently injuring her leg.<br>
<br>In September 1886, aged twenty-nine, Cattell joined the Anglican evangelical Mildmay Mission and was trained as a deaconess by Mrs Pennefather at Mildmay Park, London. After several months at the Caledonian Road Mission, she went to the old Mildmay Mission Hospital, Turville Street, Bethnal Green. She was sent to train at the Middlesex Hospital for a year from September 1888 to take charge of a ward, and was considered &#145;excellent in every way and a most efficient nurse&#146;  (Middlesex Hospital, register of lady probationers, 1878&#150;1905, 32). She returned to the old Mildmay Hospital, which was replaced in November 1892 by a new one with fifty beds, in Austin Street, Bethnal Green. She served as sister of the women's ward briefly, before becoming &#145;helper&#146;, and &#145;second in the staff&#146; to the matron, Miss Goodwyn, whom she succeeded in November 1896, retaining this post until her retirement in 1919.<br>
<br>An able administrator and meticulous record-keeper, Cattell was responsible, under the medical superintendent, for her nurses and for the day-to-day running of the hospital, which provided patient services for the surrounding impoverished areas, and trained nurses for missionary work. It depended on charity and Maud recognized the importance of careful financial management. In her last years there she witnessed the decline of the Mildmay Mission through shortage of income. Only the mission's two hospitals survived, managed independently of the Mildmay Trust.<br>
<br>Maud's final years proved the most difficult. Staff shortages caused by the war effort were followed by problems with the drains, which closed the hospital in 1916. She helped to negotiate medical cover with the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital, to enable its partial reopening in 1917, and sought suitable hospitals to continue probationer training. During an air raid in 1917 the hospital received thirty-six casualties caused by the bombing. The closure of the trustees' offices in Mildmay Park in 1917 created extra administrative work. Cattell undertook the cooking, when there was no cook, for two months in 1918. When the war ended the hospital returned to full working order. Cattell felt that it needed a &#145;younger woman&#146; to carry on the work  (Mildmay Mission Hospital, council minute book, MM/A/2/1, 43). She stayed on to train Dora Woodhouse, who took up her duties on 12 August 1919.<br>
<br>Maud had an imposing and dignified presence. She was fairly tall and always slim, walking straight and upright. Her hair was originally dark, and she had a round face. As she got older, she wore glasses.<blockquote>During her thirty three years of service &hellip; she worked unremittingly for the good of all, and to the many who were privileged to serve under her she was not only &#145;Matron&#146;, but &#145;Mother&#146; and friend. Her loving consideration for everyone under her care was a marked characteristic and the verse which constantly comes to mind in reference to her is, &#145;I am among you as he that serveth.&#146; &hellip; She passed on to her nurses the habit of care over detail. For many years she [kept] &hellip; the accounts of the Hospital &hellip; most beautifully. It is impossible to estimate how much the Hospital owes to her guidance and to the faithful Christian witness of her life. (<span class="italic">Mildmay Mission Hospital Magazine</span>, 1)</blockquote>In retirement Maud lived at Sheldon with her father and her sisters Clara and Emma. Latterly her married sister Hannah May Kemp (1866&#150;1955) cared for her. She died on 25 June 1947 at home, at South Bank, Sheldon, Birmingham, and was buried at St Giles's Church, Sheldon, three days later.<br>
<br>Maud was assisted by her sister <a name="cosubject_71104"></a><span class="headword">Clara Jane Cattell</span>  (1860&#150;1923), who trained at the Brownlow Hill Infirmary, Liverpool, from 1883 to 1886. She worked abroad as a private nurse, mainly in Switzerland, becoming a registered nurse in 1890, when she joined the Mission Hospital, and became a deaconess. She was sister of the men's ward from November 1892 until 1907, when she left to care for her parents. Tougher than Maud, she &#145;gave herself unreservedly and whole heartedly to the task of nursing, teaching, and soul-winning in the wards with marked success&#146;  (Mildmay Mission Hospital, annual report, 1907, 7). She died on 23 January 1923 at Sheldon, and was buried there three days later.<br>
