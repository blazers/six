<span class="headword">Rastell,  William</span>  (1508&#150;1565), <span class="occ">printer and legal writer</span>, was born in Coventry, a younger son of the printer and adventurer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23149/', "John Rastell (c.1475&#150;1536)")</script> and Elizabeth (1482&#150;1537), sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19191/', "Sir Thomas More")</script>. According to Wood, he went to Oxford University in 1525, aged about seventeen, though this seems unlikely since he was already working in his father's printing business. Rastell became a prominent member of Thomas More's circle. He set up his own press in 1529, and was More's principal publisher, venturing also into drama, for instance with John Heywood's <span class="italic">The Play of Love</span>. His main contribution as a law printer was the first edition of the register of writs (<span class="italic">Registrum omnium brevium</span>) in 1531; and he produced in 1534 an omnibus student handbook combining, in small print, the <span class="italic">Natura brevium</span>, the old and new tenures, the book for justices of the peace, <span class="italic">Novae narrationes</span>, <span class="italic">Returna brevium</span>, and <span class="italic">Carta feodi</span>, described in the preface as &#145;compacte into one volume, ryght studyously corrected&#146;.<br>
<br>Rastell ceased printing in 1534, having by then turned to legal studies. Admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1532, no doubt with More's support, he was called to the bar in 1539 and to the bench of the inn in 1546. He gave his first reading in the autumn of 1547 on the statute <span class="italic">Quia emptores</span> (1290). Soon after being elected as treasurer of the inn, in 1549, he quit the country on 21 December for religious reasons and remained in Louvain until the accession of Mary I. While in Louvain, in July 1553, his young wife, Winifred, the daughter of Sir Thomas More's adopted daughter, Margaret Giggs, and the physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5603/', "John Clement")</script>, whom he had married in 1544, died of a fever. Rastell may have spent part of his time in exile composing the table to Fitzherbert's <span class="italic">Natura brevium</span>, which was included in the new edition of 1553 and all subsequent editions.<br>
<br>Rastell returned to England in 1553, and served for three years in parliament as member for Hindon, Ripon, and Canterbury respectively. In 1555, patronized by Cardinal Pole, he was created a serjeant-at-law, and the following year became standing counsel to the city of Canterbury. The Canterbury connection was William Roper, a fellow bencher of Lincoln's Inn, and his second patron as a serjeant, who was the husband of Sir Thomas More's daughter Margaret. According to Plowden, Rastell had a home in Kent. During the 1550s Rastell completed an edition of More's collected English works, which was published in 1557, with a dedication to the queen. It is a valuable resource, including material that would otherwise have been lost.<br>
<br>Rastell's appointment as a justice of the queen's bench on 27 October 1558, three weeks before the queen's death, was renewed the following month by Elizabeth I, but he was unable to reconcile himself to the new religious settlement and on 3 January 1563 he again fled to Louvain. An inventory of the books seized from his study in Serjeants' Inn included a selection of classical authors. Rastell lived in Louvain until his death on 27 August 1565, when he was buried in the church of St Pierre beside his wife, Winifred. During this second exile Rastell is said to have written a life of More. Only a fragment of it, mostly concerning John Fisher, has survived for certain; though a Latin account of More's condemnation (&#145;Ordo condemnationis Mori&#146;) has also been attributed to him. Rastell had no children, and by his will (registered in Antwerp) left his property in North Mimms, Hertfordshire, and his gold locket with More's portrait, to his nephew, the Jesuit <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13180/', "Ellis Heywood")</script>.<br>
<br>Rastell made two significant contributions to legal literature, both of which were developments of his interest in reference materials which began when he was printing law books in his youth. Perhaps inspired by his father's <span class="italic">Magnum abbreviamentum statutorum Anglie</span> (1528), William Rastell published in 1557 a more ambitious <span class="italic">Collection of All the Statutes</span>, containing texts of all the public legislation still in force, abridged under alphabetical headings, with tables and catchwords. As in the 1528 abridgement, he left the old statutes in their original language, &#145;for feare of misse interpretation&#146;. The <span class="italic">Collection</span> was such a valuable reference tool that it enjoyed an enormous success, and was reprinted at the end of almost every session of parliament until the 1620s, when it was overtaken by Pulton and the precursors of the <span class="italic">Statutes at Large</span>. Rastell's other compilation, the <span class="italic">Colleccion of Entrees</span>, was the best source of precedents of pleading and court-forms printed in the sixteenth century. It combined precedents from the manuscript collections of his grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19183/', "Sir John More (d. 1530)")</script>, of Edward Stubbe (<i>d</i>. 1533), chief protonotary of the common pleas, whose son married Rastell's niece, and of John Lucas (<i>d</i>. 1525), secondary of the king's bench under William Roper, adding a few of his own. The book was compiled in Louvain (&#145;out of England, and lacking conference with learned men&#146;), where the preface was written on 28 March 1564, and was published posthumously in 1566, with new editions in 1574, 1596, and 1670. Rastell also published a chronological <span class="italic">Table</span> of the monarchs of England (1558), reprinted several times down to the reign of Charles I.<br>
