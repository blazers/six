<span class="headword">Phillimore, Sir  John</span>  (1781&#150;1840), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, third son of Joseph Phillimore, vicar of Orton on the Hill in Leicestershire, and his wife, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Machin), and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22137/', "Joseph Phillimore (1775&#150;1855)")</script>, was born on 18 January 1781. He entered the navy in the spring of 1795, on the frigate <i>Nymphe</i> with Captain George Murray (1759&#150;1819), and was present in the action off Lorient on 23 June 1795. In 1796 he followed Murray to the <i>Colossus</i>, and was on her in the battle of Cape St Vincent and when she was wrecked among the Isles of Scilly in December 1798. Phillimore was again with Murray on the <i>Edgar</i> in the Baltic, but was sent to the <i>London</i>, Sir Hyde Parker's flagship, to pass his examination, and was on her when the battle of Copenhagen was fought. Acting as signal-midshipman, he made the celebrated signal to Nelson to discontinue the action. The first lieutenant of the <i>Edgar</i> was killed in the battle and Phillimore was promoted to the vacancy on 4 April 1801. He was afterwards on the <i>London</i>, the <i>Spartiate</i>, and the sloop <i>Gannet</i>, and was made commander on 10 May 1804.<br>
<br>In October 1805 he was appointed to the armed ship <i>Cormorant</i> in the North Sea, and in September 1806 was moved to the brig <i>Belette</i> on the Downs station and off Boulogne under Commodore Owen. In the spring of 1807 he convoyed three store ships to the Baltic for the relief of Colberg, then besieged by the French. The <i>Belette</i> afterwards joined the fleet under Admiral Gambier at Copenhagen, and, as a mark of the admiral's approval of Phillimore's services, was sent to England with the dispatches. Accordingly, Phillimore was promoted captain on 13 October 1807 but remained in command of the <i>Belette</i>, which returned to the Baltic, and in February 1808 brought Lord Hutchinson to England from G&ouml;tenborg. For some months in 1809 Phillimore commanded the <i>Marlborough</i> in the Scheldt, and in June 1810 he was appointed to the <i>Diadem</i> (64 guns), which was employed as a troopship with a reduced armament. The Navy Board therefore gave orders for her to be on the establishment of a 32 gun frigate, with an insufficient supply of stores. Phillimore's protests were in vain, until, after pointing out that the paint was barely half what was required, he begged to be informed which side they would like to have painted, the starboard or larboard. In the course of this correspondence Phillimore, having noticed that the commissioners signed themselves&#151;as was the custom for a superior office&#151;his &#145;affectionate friends&#146;, signed himself their &#145;affectionate friend&#146;, for which he was promptly reprimanded. Phillimore acknowledged the response, and signed himself &#145;no longer your affectionate friend&#146;.<br>
<br>For the next three years the <i>Diadem</i> was engaged in carrying troops or prisoners to or from the Peninsula, and in May 1813 Phillimore was appointed to the <i>Eurotas</i>, a 46 gun frigate carrying light 24-pounders on the main deck. She was attached to the fleet off Brest, and on 25 February 1814 fell in with the French frigate <i>Clorinde</i> of nominally equal force. The action was one of the most evenly balanced and stubborn of the war. By nightfall the <i>Eurotas</i> was dismasted; the <i>Clorinde</i> had part of her foremast standing and drifted away. She was not, however, lost from sight. Phillimore had been most dangerously wounded and was below, but, by the exertions of the first lieutenant, when morning came the <i>Eurotas</i> was jury-rigged and going 5&frac12; knots towards the enemy, which was still in the same state as on the previous evening. It was a remarkable piece of seamanship, and should have led to a brilliant success; but, unfortunately for Phillimore, the British frigate <i>Dryad</i> and the sloop <i>Achates</i> came in sight, and on their closing on the <i>Clorinde</i> she surrendered to an evident superiority of force. On 4 June 1815 Phillimore was nominated CB. His wounds rendered him for some years incapable of active service, but in April 1820 he accepted command of the yacht <i>William and Mary</i> at the disposal of the lord lieutenant of Ireland, Earl Talbot, by whom he was knighted on 12 December 1821. In March 1823 Phillimore was appointed to the frigate <i>Thetis</i> on a roving commission to Mexico and the West Indies, the coast of Africa, South America, and the Mediterranean.<br>
<br>On one of Phillimore's short visits to England during this time his attention was called to the account in William James's <span class="italic">Naval History</span>&#151;then newly published&#151;of the action between the <i>Eurotas</i> and <i>Clorinde</i>, which he believed reflected injuriously on the discipline and efficiency of the <i>Eurotas</i>. He went to London and, armed with a stout cane, called on James and thrashed him, in compensation for which he afterwards paid &pound;100.<br>
<br>In August 1824 the <i>Thetis</i> put into St Michael's in the Azores for supplies for the sick, and the British residents requested Phillimore to have their burial-ground consecrated. Phillimore agreed and ordered the chaplain to consecrate it the next day. The chaplain demurred, and explained that only a bishop could do this. Thereupon Phillimore gave him an acting order as bishop of St Michael's, and the ground was consecrated. In the following year the <i>Thetis</i> went up the Mediterranean, carrying the British ambassador to Naples, and on the homeward voyage put into Gibraltar, just in time to establish a claim to the jurisdiction of the port, in its widest sense. Seventeen British merchant ships, blown from their anchors in a violent gale, had been driven on shore at the head of the bay, on Spanish territory, and were claimed by the Spanish commandant at Algeciras as coming under his authority. This claim Phillimore refused to allow, and leading in the <i>Thetis</i>'s boats, manned and armed, drove off the Spanish troops who had fired on the salving party. For this service in salving the cargoes Phillimore was thanked by the merchants of Gibraltar, and afterwards by Lloyds; but its principal importance was as a precedent for the senior officer at Gibraltar.<br>
<br>It was during this commission of the <i>Thetis</i> that Phillimore, with the consent of the Admiralty, reduced the rum ration from half a pint to one gill, paying the men savings-price for the other gill. The good effects of this reduction, which was in the first instance voluntary on the part of the men, were so evident that it was permanently adopted by the Admiralty in July 1824. To Phillimore were also due other changes for the comfort and improvement of the seamen, among them the payment of a monthly advance, which was adopted on board the <i>Thetis</i>. Captain Andrew Drew, who served with him, wrote that Phillimore was constantly trying to ameliorate the condition of his fellow creatures, especially British seamen, and that he was &#145;a kind protector to those over whom he was placed in authority&#146; but &#145;less agreeable to those under whom he served&#146;  (<span class="italic">Colburn's United Service Magazine</span>, pt 2, 1850, 289). The <i>Thetis</i> was paid off in November 1826, and Phillimore had no further service. In September 1831 he was appointed a naval aide-de-camp to William IV, and retained the appointment under Victoria.<br>
<br>On 17 February 1830 Phillimore married Catherine Harriet, daughter of Rear-Admiral Raigersfeld; they had four daughters and two sons, of whom the younger, Henry Bouchier, died an admiral in 1893. They settled in a cottage on the Thames near Maidenhead. The wound that Phillimore had received in the action with the <i>Clorinde</i> had never ceased to trouble him, and he eventually died of the effects of it at The Ray, near Maidenhead, on 21 March 1840. He was buried in Bray churchyard; his wife, who survived him by a few months, was buried beside him. Phillimore was a brave and professional officer who rose on his merits, having little influence and no obvious support. He was greatly interested in the conditions of service for seamen, but his insubordination, and the premeditated assault on William James, revealed a darker side to his character.<br>
