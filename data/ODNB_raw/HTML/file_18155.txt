<span class="headword">Marshall,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1745, <em>d.</em> 1818), <span class="occ">agricultural writer and land agent</span>, was baptized on 28 July 1745 at Sinnington, North Riding, Yorkshire. The younger son of a yeoman farmer, according to his own account he could trace his blood through the veins of agriculturists for upwards of four hundred years. At the age of fifteen, however, he was apprenticed in the linen trade in London, and after forsaking this for insurance he spent some years engaged in commercial activities in the West Indies.<br>
<br>In 1771, after returning to London, a sudden and severe illness made Marshall decide to take up farming. He had already been in the habit of spending his leisure hours in studying agriculture, and a legacy of &pound;500 received on the death of his father in 1772 helped him to pursue his new career. In 1774 he undertook the management of a farm of 300 acres at Addiscombe, near Croydon in Surrey. Marshall's first work was written there in 1778 and entitled <span class="italic">Minutes of agriculture made on a farm of three hundred acres of various soils near Croydon &hellip; published as a sketch of the actual business of a farm</span>. Marshall swam against the tide of opinion in advocating the use of oxen instead of horses, and believed in keeping his farmworkers under strict control.<br>
<br>In 1778 Marshall's partner, who held the lease of the Addiscombe land, became bankrupt, and Marshall was obliged to leave. He published <span class="italic">Experiments and Observations Concerning Agriculture and the Weather</span> in the following year, and he put forward his long-advocated plan for the establishment of government-supported agricultural colleges. An approach to the Society of Arts for funds to enable him to reside in six or seven different agricultural districts and record their farming practices was rebuffed. This reverse he blamed on Arthur Young (1741&#150;1820), who was becoming the best-known agricultural authority of the day, and whose method of collecting information by visiting leading landowners and farmers on lengthy tours Marshall had attacked.<br>
<br>In 1780 Marshall accepted an appointment as agent to Sir Harbord Harbord of Gunton, Norfolk, a minor figure in the promotion of agricultural improvement, but left this post after only two years following a disagreement with his employer. He returned to Yorkshire before visiting Gloucestershire in 1783. In all his country visits Marshall compiled notes with a view to achieving his aim of publishing a series of volumes on regional farming practices. In 1783 he contributed to Dodsley's <span class="italic">Annual Register</span> for 1783 a pioneering study of the black canker caterpillar, responsible for destroying turnips in Norfolk.<br>
<br>Then, in 1784, Marshall became agent to Samuel Pipe-Wolferstan, agreeing to manage land at Statfold, near Tamworth, and to act also as adviser on landscaping the estate. But after a series of quarrels with Pipe-Wolferstan, arising in part from Marshall's independent and irascible temperament, he left Statfold in 1786. For some years he then resided in London during the winters and examined farming in a variety of regions during the summers. His stay at Statfold had proved fruitful, however, in providing him with a new career in landscape gardening, and it was there that he had completed his book entitled <span class="italic">Planting and Ornamental Gardening</span> (1785).<br>
<br>In 1787 Marshall published the first of his major studies of the farming practices of six different regions of England, <span class="italic">The Rural Economy of Norfolk</span>; this was followed by studies on Yorkshire (1788), Gloucestershire (1789), the midland counties (1790), the west of England (1796), and the southern counties (1798). To a second edition of the last he added in 1799 a <span class="italic">Sketch of the Vale of London</span>. Many of these works were translated into French and published in Paris in 1803.<br>
<br>In his <span class="roman">Rural Economy of the midland counties</span> Marshall proposed the establishment of a board of agriculture, a suggestion which the influential Sir John Sinclair (1754&#150;1835) persuaded Pitt to adopt in 1793. Marshall was greatly angered that his old rival, Arthur Young, was chosen for the post of secretary to the board, rather than himself. However, the board adopted his plan of provisional surveys, though on a county rather than his favoured regional basis, and his own work, <span class="italic">Central Highlands</span>, appeared under the board's auspices. After this Marshall took no further part in the board's publications, preferring to continue with his own <span class="roman">Rural Economy</span> series; in addition he published <span class="italic">On Planting and Rural Ornament</span> (1796), and <span class="italic">On the Appropriation and Inclosure of Commonable and Intermixed Lands</span> (1801). Marshall was highly critical of the procedures and consequences of the current modes of enclosure, and advocated a general enclosure act to regulate the matter. The <span class="roman">General Enclosure Act</span> of 1801, however, proved a half-measure which did not meet his views. He next wrote an important work on estate management, <span class="italic">On the Landed Property of England</span>, which appeared in 1804. It was some consolation for his disappointments over the board of agriculture that in 1792 he had been appointed reviewer of agricultural books for the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>; in 1796 he had also become agricultural reporter for the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>Marshall had been assisted in the preparation of his <span class="roman">Rural Economy</span> series by his visits in 1791 to Sussex as a guest of the earl of Egremont, and to Devon and Cornwall as adviser to Sir Francis Drake on the improvement of his estate at Buckland Abbey. In 1792 Marshall visited the Scottish highlands as adviser on estate management and garden landscaping to the earl of Breadalbane at Taymouth in Perthshire, and from this visit resulted his <span class="italic">General View of the Agriculture of the Central Highlands of Scotland</span> (1794).<br>
<br>Marshall did not marry until 1807, when already in his sixties. His bride was a distant cousin, Elizabeth Hodgson, a woman of considerable property, of Middleton, near Pickering, in the North Riding. Marshall now went to Middleton to live, and he remained there until after his wife's death in 1816. He then moved to Beck Isle House at Pickering, where he had inherited various pieces of land following the death in 1811 of his brother John, a successful local farmer. At Pickering, Marshall built a large schoolroom on to one end of Beck Isle House, a first stage in his plan for founding an agricultural college. Its design was one he had first advocated forty years before, and had also elaborated on in <span class="italic">Proposals for a Rural Institute or College of Agriculture</span> (1799). But on 18 September 1818, before his college could become a reality, Marshall died at Beck Isle House. His estate was sworn for probate at &pound;6600. His monument in Pickering church stated that &#145;he was indefatigable in the study of rural economy&#146;, and that &#145;he was an excellent mechanic, and had a considerable knowledge of most branches of science, particularly of philology, botany, and chemistry&#146;. Marshall had been the first to form a collection of words peculiar to the Yorkshire dialect. The vocabulary appended to the <span class="italic">Rural Economy of Yorkshire</span> contains about eleven hundred words, and his <span class="italic">Yorkshire Words</span> was reprinted by the English Dialect Society.<br>
<br>In 1808 Marshall had begun his tremendous self-imposed labour of compiling and commenting on abstracts from the board of agriculture's county reports, rearranged on a regional basis, a project which filled his declining years. It gave him much scope for attacking the inadequacies of the board's authors and their views, and he lived to see it completed; the fifth and final volume of <span class="italic">The Review and Abstracts of the County Reports to the Board of Agriculture</span> appeared in 1817. The whole was republished in 1818, the year of his death. &#145;The registry of the existing practices of England, at the commencement of the nineteenth century&#146;, he wrote&#151;the &#145;leading object&#146; of his life for forty years&#151;&#145;IS NOW FINISHED&#146;  (Horn, 39).<br>
<br>Modern agricultural historians have generally held that Marshall's works on English farming are superior to those of his rival, Arthur Young, as they are more systematically arranged and based on a more thorough knowledge of a district by personal residence there. Unlike Young, Marshall was cautious about experimentation, preferring rather to advocate the best practices approved by experienced farmers. On the other hand, he lacked Young's pithy and more readable style, and acquired fewer close contacts with the leading farming figures of the time. Marshall's career, indeed, suffered in some degree from his native bluntness and acid tongue, his pride, and his sensibility to slights. Nevertheless, from the independence of his views arose his remarkably early support for agricultural education, and his belief in the necessity of studying agriculture on a regional basis, both of which were ideas well before their time. A portrait of him in the National Library of Scotland, Edinburgh, is reproduced in Pamela Horn's work, <span class="italic">William Marshall (1745&#150;1818) and the Georgian Countryside</span> (1982).<br>
