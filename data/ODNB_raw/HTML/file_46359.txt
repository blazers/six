<span class="headword">England,  George</span>  (1811/12&#150;1878), <span class="occ">engineer and locomotive builder</span>, was born in Newcastle upon Tyne. He was probably the George England baptized on 28 July 1811 in Newcastle, son of George England and Mary Whinney. Both were presumably English. George England trained at John Penn's Deptford boilerworks and shipyards. He patented the traversing screw jack (patent no. 8058, 1839), which enabled a derailed locomotive not only to be lifted but also to be moved laterally so that it could be lowered back onto the rails.<br>
<br>About 1839 England established Hatcham Iron Works in Pomeroy Street, New Cross, London. Here he manufactured patent jacks and other tools, and towards the end of the 1840s he started to build locomotives, specializing in light locomotives of the type originated by W. Bridges Adams. George England's locomotive <i>Little England</i> was awarded a prize medal at the Great Exhibition of 1851, and his works then became busy constructing locomotives for railways in Britain&#151;for collieries and contractors&#151;and for export to India and Australia. He is best-known for having built in 1863 the first locomotives for the Ffestiniog Railway (FR), with its exceptionally narrow gauge of under 2 ft. These two tiny machines were very successful: with them C. E. Spooner, the railway's engineer, was able to replace horses by locomotives and then to introduce passenger trains&#151;the first in Britain&#151;on a gauge substantially less than the standard 4 ft 8&frac12; in.<br>
<br>England built four more similar locomotives for the FR, two of them to an enlarged design. Then in 1868 he commenced construction for the FR of a double-bogie, double-boiler locomotive of the type patented by Robert Fairlie. This locomotive, <i>Little Wonder</i>, was the first wholly successful &#145;double Fairlie&#146;: warranted by England to be as powerful as two of the small locomotives, it proved almost as powerful as three. Demonstrations of it as it hauled immensely long trains up grade through sinuous curves were a vital influence in worldwide adoption of economical narrow gauges.<br>
<br>England was elected a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1853, and he became a director of the Crystal Palace Company about 1857. He was twice married: to whom and when for the first time is not known, but by 1843 he was living with Sarah Hannar, whom he eventually married after his first wife died. On 6 July 1843 he and Sarah Hannar had a daughter, Eliza Ann; there was an older daughter, Mary, and subsequently a son, George.<br>
<br>In appearance, England was tubby, even jovial; in character, he became increasingly irascible and contentious as he grew older. In 1858 he was fined for assaulting and beating an apprentice. In 1862 he indicted Robert Fairlie, who had eloped with Eliza Ann, for perjury, on the grounds that Fairlie had not, as claimed, received her father's consent to their marriage. When England was obliged to reveal his own marital history the case collapsed. The next general meeting of the Crystal Palace Company consisted largely of uproar as England, following these revelations, was forced to resign his directorship.<br>
<br>Increasingly tyrannical behaviour towards employees at Hatcham led in 1865 to a disastrous strike. Much business was lost. England himself retired from ill health in 1869; the works was taken on lease by Fairlie, George England junior, and J. S. Fraser, under whom <i>Little Wonder</i> was completed. England junior died a few months later and locomotive building ceased.<br>
<br>George England died at Cannes, France, on 2 March 1878; his estate was left to George William Linghorn, born 17 July 1871, who adopted and became known by the name of George England. Five locomotives built by George England survive: <i>Shannon</i>, on long-term loan to Didcot Railway Centre from the National Railway Museum, and <i>Princess</i>, <i>Prince</i>, <i>Palmerston</i>, and <i>Welsh Pony</i>, on the Ffestiniog Railway.<br>
