<span class="headword">Brough,  John Cargill</span>  (1834&#150;1872), <span class="occ">science journalist</span>, was born at Pontypool on 11 February 1834, the youngest son of Barnabas Brough (<i>d</i>. 1854), a brewer and wine merchant, and his wife, Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whiteside. His brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3579/', "William Brough")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3577/', "Brough, Robert Barnabas")</script>], <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3577/', "Robert Barnabas Brough")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32100/', "Lionel Brough")</script>, became well known in literary and dramatic circles, their sense of humour being clearly inherited from their father, who also wrote for the music-halls. In 1839&#150;40 his father gave evidence for the crown at the trial of the Chartist leader John Frost. As a result the family was ostracized and in 1843 moved first to Manchester, where Brough attended the grammar school, and then to London, where his father found work on the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> and Brough joined him as an office boy. In 1852 he became a clerk in the audit office of the South Western Railway Company, and began to study science at evening classes in the company's mechanics' institute, of which he became secretary and librarian. Here he also learned the art of popular lecturing.<br>
<br>In 1857, following his marriage to Mary Elizabeth Kidd of Clapham on 24 September 1856, Brough resigned his clerkship to devote himself to freelance journalism, joining his bohemian brothers in the Savage Club and the Grub Street circle described in G. L. M. Strauss's <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span> (1882). In 1859 he published a children's book, <span class="italic">Fairy Tales of Science</span>. In 1864 he edited and wrote technical articles for Arnold Cooley's <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia of Practical Receipts</span>, and contributed to Strauss's <span class="italic">English Workshops</span>. In 1860 he had become editor of <span class="italic">The Ironmonger</span> and of the <span class="italic">Chemist and Druggist</span>. He transformed the latter from a monthly trade journal into a chemical and pharmaceutical journal respected by the scientific community. Brough's growing interest in chemistry inspired him to launch the weekly <span class="italic">Laboratory</span> in April 1867 in direct competition with W. Crookes's <span class="italic">Chemical News</span>. It was not a commercial success and closed after six months, but its skilful mix of news, comment, and original scientific communications made it a model for Norman Lockyer's <span class="italic">Nature</span> two years later.<br>
<br>In 1864 Brough was elected to the Chemical Society, where he became renowned for his sociability and sense of humour. He was the principal poetaster of a group of convivial chemists, the B Club, and with others compiled the comic brochure <span class="italic">Exeter Change</span> for the British Association meeting at Exeter in 1869. In 1870 he joined the comedian Thomas Archer in writing the drawing-room comedy <span class="italic">An Eligible Situation</span>. For some months in 1869&#150;70 he was a sub-editor for <span class="italic">Nature</span>, but rheumatic fever forced his resignation, as well as the abandonment of his two editorships. In 1870, through the kindness of friends, he was appointed lecturer, librarian, and superintendent of the London Institution in Finsbury Circus. His wife died in childbirth in 1867. Brough died of a &#145;disease of the heart&#146; at Esher on 7 September 1872, leaving his three children, one of whom was the mining engineer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32099/', "Bennett Hooper Brough")</script>, and an adopted orphan nephew and niece destitute. He was buried at Norwood cemetery on 12 September. It was a mark of the affection and high regard in which he was held by his peers that an international appeal to secure the children's education raised &pound;2000. Likened by his contemporaries to Charles Lamb, Brough possessed a shrewd intellect, untapped scientific abilities, and a gentle sense of humour that endeared him to scientific and literary friends alike.<br>
