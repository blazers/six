<span class="headword">Sadie,  Stanley John</span>  (1930&#150;2005), <span class="occ">musicologist and music critic</span>, was born on 30 October 1930 at 57 Forty Avenue, Wembley, the only son of David Sadie, a silk manufacturer's agent, and his wife, Deborah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Simons; he had one older sister. He was of Jewish descent. He was educated at St Paul's School, London, and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he read music under Thurston Dart, Charles Cudworth, and Patrick Hadley; he graduated BA MusB in 1953, and PhD in 1958. His thesis was on eighteenth-century British chamber music, a subject about which little had hitherto been discovered. As a schoolboy he had played the clarinet in the RAF central band; he went on to become an accomplished and active bassoonist. On 10 December 1953, at the New West End Synagogue, Paddington, he married Ad&egrave;le Bloom, formerly Simmons (1931&#150;1978), a hospital committee clerk, and daughter of David Simmons, commercial traveller. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Sadie taught at Trinity College of Music, London, from 1957 to 1965, and in 1964 joined <span class="italic">The Times</span> as a music critic, reviewing regularly for the paper until 1981. In 1966 he was appointed assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Musical Times</span>, two years later becoming its editor, a post he held until 1986. For forty years, from the mid-1960s, he also reviewed regularly for <span class="italic">The Gramophone</span> and made many broadcasts for the BBC. He wrote numerous programme articles and notes to accompany recordings.<br>
<br>Sadie's years with <span class="italic">The Times</span> coincided with a period of rich diversity in British musical life: performances of contemporary and new music were widespread and, at the same time, there was a growing interest in early music and the re-creation of historical styles of performance (a subject that fascinated him). He was a percipient and lively critic of a range of music-making and, though he expressed his views very directly, his notices were fair. When he became editor of the <span class="italic">Musical Times</span> it was the most widely read music journal in Britain and the only one of musical record. Under his editorship it published articles by leading scholars as well as a range of reviews of publications and performances; Sadie himself contributed numerous reviews, especially of opera (to which he was especially drawn throughout his life). In all his writings his prose was elegant and unpretentious, and revealing of his sharp and sometimes scathing wit. His trenchant views could lead to rifts with colleagues.<br>
<br>In 1970 Sadie began work on a sixth edition of <span class="italic">Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians</span>, published in 1980 as <span class="italic">The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</span>, in twenty volumes. His combination of encyclopaedic knowledge and experience of music's practicalities made him the obvious choice as editor of the new edition of the dictionary, his greatest achievement. Not only was it on an unprecedented scale, but it embraced topics new to musicology (including world music, ethnomusicology, ancient music, sources, analysis, popular music) and was written by an international team of specialists. No longer was the dictionary directed at the informed amateur. It set new standards of musical writing, scholarship, and bibliography.<br>
<br>This ground-breaking work of musical lexicography generated several other reference works with which Sadie was involved, notably <span class="italic">The New Grove Dictionary of Musical Instruments</span> (3 vols., 1984), <span class="italic">The New Grove Dictionary of American Music</span> (with H. Wiley Hitchcock; 4 vols., 1986), <span class="italic">The Grove Concise Dictionary of Music</span> (1988), <span class="italic">The New Grove Dictionary of Opera</span> (4 vols., 1992), and <span class="italic">The New Grove Book of Operas</span> (1996). Sadie was later co-editor, with John Tyrrell, of the seventh edition of the main dictionary (29 vols., 2001). In 2000, however, the publishers (Macmillan Holtzbrinck) suddenly stipulated that the dictionary be published later that year. Sadie protested that this would be impossible without compromising editorial standards; he was dismissed. (As it happened, the new deadline was still not met.) He was involved with the texts of these works at every level; he was a skilful editor who enjoyed teaching the art to his large team of young colleagues, in whom he inspired great loyalty; he launched the careers of numerous scholars, writers, and editors.<br>
<br>Sadie's writings and performing editions focused on the music of his two great loves: Mozart and Handel. He published a monograph on Mozart in 1956, another in 1966, an edition of Mozart's piano sonatas (1981), a revised edition of Emily Anderson's edition of Mozart's letters (1985), a book on Mozart's symphonies (1986), and a volume of essays on Mozart (1996). In spite of his lengthy final illness he completed the first of a projected two-volume study of Mozart, <span class="italic">Mozart: the Early Years, 1756&#150;1791</span> (2006). His books on Handel were published in 1962, 1966, and 1972, and in 1987 he co-edited (with Anthony Hicks) the <span class="italic">Handel Tercentenary Collection</span>. From 1976 he was editor of Dent's <span class="roman">Master Musicians</span> series. He also published books of a less specialist nature, notably <span class="italic">The Cambridge Guide to Music</span> (with Alison Latham; 1985), and he edited a set of eight volumes, <span class="italic">Man and Music</span> (1989&#150;93), which were conceived alongside a series of television programmes, presented by Bamber Gascoigne and Alan Bennett among others.<br>
<br>On 18 July 1978, following the death of his first wife, Sadie married Julie Anne Vertrees, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McCormack (<i>b</i>. 1948), an American musicologist, bass-viol player, and cellist, and daughter of Walter Stewart McCormack, dentist. They had a son and a daughter, and lived initially in Hampstead. During their marriage they were involved in several joint projects, including <span class="italic">The New Grove Dictionary of Women Composers</span> (with Rhian Samuel; 1994). In 1993 Sadie founded the Handel House Trust, to create a museum and recital room in Handel's London house in Brook Street; his wife was also instrumental in establishing the Handel House Museum. Through this venture Sadie and his wife developed a wider interest in composers' memorials and birthplaces. They made some forty trips to Europe, gathering information for a projected guide. (It was on one of these journeys, in Ukraine in 1999, that they were involved in a car accident in which Sadie was badly injured.) <span class="italic">Calling on the Composer</span> was published posthumously in 2005.<br>
<br>Sadie was at the centre of British musical life for nearly fifty years. He occupied a unique place: he was a distinguished scholar, but he possessed that rare gift of being able to communicate his knowledge and enthusiasms to the general reader and listener. He devoted passionate energy to his numerous projects, and usually worked long into the night. But he nevertheless had a strong sense of family and clear views on topical issues that affected everyday life. He listed his recreations in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> as &#145;watching cricket, drinking (mainly wine and coffee), bridge, travel, reading&#146;. In 1982 he was made a CBE. He was president of the Royal Musical Association (1989&#150;94) and of the International Musicological Society (1992&#150;7). He received several honorary doctorates.<br>
<br>Sadie and his wife moved to Cossington, Somerset, in 2000. There they established a series of chamber concerts. His last year was marked by a debilitating deterioration of his health; a diagnosis of motor neurone disease was made just a week before he died, of bronchopneumonia, at his home, The Manor, Cossington, on 21 March 2005. He was survived by his wife and five children. There was a private funeral in Cossington, followed by a woodland burial in the Quantock hills. A memorial service was held at Cossington on 4 April, and a memorial concert at the Royal Academy of Music on 1 November. Sadie lived long enough to see the publication a month before his death of a volume of essays in his honour, <span class="italic">Words about Mozart</span> (edited by Dorothea Link). In 2005 he was posthumously awarded the Handel prize by the city of Halle.<br>
