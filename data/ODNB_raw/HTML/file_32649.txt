<span class="headword">Crowe,  Eyre</span>  (1824&#150;1910), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 3 October 1824 at 141 Sloane Street, London, the eldest of the six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6823/', "Eyre Evans Crowe (1799&#150;1868)")</script>, author and journalist, and his first wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1853), daughter of Joseph Archer of Newtown Mount Kennedy, co. Wicklow, and his wife, Hester. His younger brother was the journalist and art historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6824/', "Sir Joseph Archer Crowe (1825&#150;1896)")</script>. His childhood was spent largely in Paris, where his father was correspondent for the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>. He was educated at home by his father and was taught drawing by William Darley and one M. Brasseur. In 1839 he enrolled at the celebrated atelier of Paul Delaroche, where he associated with many rising artists, including Jean-L&eacute;on G&eacute;r&ocirc;me, with whom he formed a lasting friendship. Both were among the pupils who accompanied Delaroche to Rome after the atelier closed in 1843.<br>
<br>In the following year Crowe rejoined his family, now settled in London. His early work was rejected by the Royal Academy and he registered at the Academy Schools for further study. In 1846 he made his d&eacute;but at the academy with <span class="italic">Master Prynne Searching Archbishop Laud's Pockets in the Tower</span>. This impressed W. M. Thackeray, a close family friend, who employed Crowe to transfer his sketches for <span class="italic">Notes of a Journey from Cornhill to Grand Cairo</span> (1846) to woodblocks and to conduct research for his commentary on Louis Marvy's <span class="italic">Sketches after English Landscape Painters</span> (1850).<br>
<br>When his father ceased to be editor of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> and returned to Paris in 1852, the indigent Crowe was engaged by Thackeray as his secretary and as drawing-master for his daughters. After preparing <span class="italic">The History of Henry Esmond Esquire</span> for publication Crowe was persuaded to accompany the author on a six-month (November 1852 to April 1853) lecture tour of the United States as his &#145;factotum and amanuensis&#146;  (Crowe, <span class="italic">With Thackeray in America</span>, 1). He did not always prove competent in this capacity but Thackeray appreciated his company as &#145;the kindest and most affectionate henchman ever man had&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Private Papers</span>, 3.184). Crowe's American sketches, some of which appeared in the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, show a strong interest in the appearance and condition of the black community, later expressed in the painting <span class="italic">Slaves Waiting for Sale, Richmond, Virginia</span> (exh. RA, 1861; Heinz Collection).<br>
<br>After his return to England Crowe gradually achieved success as a painter of genre and historical subjects, often reflecting an extensive knowledge of eighteenth-century literature, for example <span class="italic">The Penance of Dr Johnson</span> (exh. RA, 1869; Dr Johnson's House). His <span class="italic">Defoe in the Pillory</span> (exh. RA, 1862) won the silver medal of the Society for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts. Modern criticism has paid greater attention to his unsentimental excursions into social realism, such as the depictions of foundrymen in <span class="italic">The Foundry</span> (exh. as <span class="italic">Shinglers</span> RA, 1869; Milwaukee School of Engineering) and women millworkers in <span class="italic">The Dinner Hour, Wigan</span> (exh. RA, 1874; Manchester City Galleries). From 1859 he acted as occasional examiner and inspector of the government schools of art. He was commissioned by the South Kensington Museum to design mosaics of William Hogarth (1867) and Sir Christopher Wren (1869) for the south courts and to paint the lunette <span class="italic">Modelling from Life</span> (1869) for the National Competition Gallery. He exhibited annually at the Royal Academy from 1857 to 1908, was elected an associate in 1876, and lived to become its oldest member, but never attained the rank of academician.<br>
<br>Crowe was a sociable bachelor, from 1861 frequenting the Reform Club, which owns his painting <span class="italic">John Bright at the Reform Club, 1883</span>. He was also welcomed by the St John's Wood clique of artists as an &#145;honorary member&#146; whose &#145;hearty laugh was &hellip; more exhilarating than champagne&#146;  (Leslie, 194&#150;6). However, his nature grew more retiring as he outlived contemporaries and his artistic reputation. Having published two illustrated memoirs of his mentor, <span class="italic">With Thackeray in America</span> (1893) and <span class="italic">Thackeray's Haunts and Homes</span> (1897), he was himself remembered by Henry James as:<blockquote>a Thackerayan figure, but much as if the master's hand had stamped him with the outline and the value, with life and sweetness and patience&#151;shown, as after the long futility, seated in a quiet wait, very long too, for the end. (H. James, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1956, 53)</blockquote>Crowe died, unmarried, of heart failure on 12 December 1910 at his home, 88 Hallam Street, Portland Place, London, following a hernia operation; he was buried on 15 December at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
