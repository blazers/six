<span class="headword">Coppock,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1719, <em>d.</em> 1746), <span class="occ">Jacobite chaplain</span>, was born in Old Millgate, Manchester, and baptized on 13 December 1719. He was the third of four children of John Coppock, a tailor, and his wife, Esther, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ogden, both from Manchester. In the 1730s he attended the local grammar school and in 1739 went on to Brasenose College, Oxford. After graduating BA in October 1742 he started an adventurous career which eventually led him to the scaffold in October 1746. Two propaganda pamphlets, published after his death, offer colourful stories of Coppock's progress as a Jacobite villain from a career as a quack doctor in Oxford to the execution site at Harraby Hill, Carlisle. Although most of the stories are of questionable reliability, it is almost certain that in November 1744 Coppock forged a testimony in order to obtain a curacy in Kent. The forgery was discovered nine months later and he had to return to his paternal home.<br>
<br>In November 1745 Coppock joined the Jacobite army, quickly becoming both the chaplain and the quartermaster of the Manchester regiment. On the way back north he stayed behind with his regiment at Carlisle, where he was captured and imprisoned. He gained some prominence as the &#145;rebel bishop of Carlisle&#146; in the Hanoverian press, which exploited the fictitious story of his nomination by the Stuart pretender. After ten months in prison at Lancaster and Carlisle he was condemned for high treason in September 1746.<blockquote>It is observed, that he behaved very insolently on his trial; that when he was going from the bar, after having been found guilty, he said openly to the other rebel prisoners, &#145;Never mind it, my boys, for if our Saviour was here, these fellows would condemn him&#146;. (<span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span>)</blockquote>He wrote numerous petitions and also tried to escape twice, but in the end was hanged and quartered with eight other Jacobites in Carlisle on 18 October 1746. Afterwards his head was displayed at the English gate.<br>
