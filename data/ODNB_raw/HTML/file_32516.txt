<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Colvin, Sir  Auckland</span>  (1838&#150;1908), <span class="occ">administrator in India and Egypt</span>, was born at Calcutta on 8 March 1838, the third son of the ten children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6013/', "John Russell Colvin (1807&#150;1857)")</script>, lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces, and his wife, Emma Sophia, daughter of Wetenhall Sneyd, vicar of Newchurch, Isle of Wight. Three of his brothers, Bazett Wetenhall Colvin, Elliott Graham Colvin, and <a href="#cosubject_32519">Sir Walter Mytton Colvin [<i>see below</i>]</a>, all had distinguished careers in India, and a fourth, Clement Sneyd CSI, was secretary of the public works department of the India Office in London. His grandfather John Colvin was a merchant in Calcutta.<br>
<br>Educated at Eton College from 1850, Colvin went to the East India College, Haileybury, in 1854, and returned to India to begin an administrative career on 17 January 1858. He married on 4 August 1859 Charlotte Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1865), daughter of Lieutenant-General Charles Herbert CB, and had a son, who died in infancy, and three daughters. Initially posted to the North-Western Provinces (later the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh), where his father had been governor, he held administrative posts in various districts until becoming under-secretary in the home department of the government of India in 1864&#150;5. From 1866 to 1870 he was assistant settlement officer in Etawa and Allahabad districts, working on the revision of the land revenue assessment. In 1870 he was appointed secretary to the board of revenue of the government of the North-Western Provinces. From 1875 to 1878 he held various posts in the government of India as commissioner for excise and inland customs, although he was returned briefly to district work as a collector in 1877 following a disagreement with the lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces, Sir George Couper.<br>
<br>Colvin's career began to take on a wider significance when he was transferred to Egypt in January 1878, initially as head of the cadastral survey. He resigned from this post the next year when Khedive Isma&#145;il, the titular head of the Egyptian government, attempted to exclude all Europeans from his administration, but was appointed commissioner of the debt in May 1879 and succeeded Evelyn Baring (later Lord Cromer) as controller-general in June 1880. These posts gave him responsibility for the management of the Egyptian government's debts to its foreign creditors, payment of which absorbed about two-thirds of government revenues each year.<br>
<br>Colvin now became identified with the interests of British and French bondholders, and he used his influence through official channels, and through his access to the press as the Egyptian correspondent of the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, to stress the responsibilities of the British government to the interests of private investors. In a perceptive memorandum written for the British government in December 1881, for example, Colvin argued that liberal nationalists should be encouraged to take over the internal administration of Egypt, but that the European powers must recognize openly their own material interests in financial administration. During the political upheavals of 1880 to 1882, as the nationalist movement led by Urabi Pasha and backed by the local military and landed &eacute;lites gathered support for opposition to European financial control, Colvin and Sir Edward Malet, the British consul, saw their position under increasing threat. The reports of these men on the spot helped to fan fears (possibly exaggerated) of anarchy and an anti-European military revolt, which prompted the British occupation of Egypt following riots in Alexandria in June 1882. After the British occupation Colvin became financial adviser to the khedive. He was created KCMG in 1881.<br>
<br>Colvin returned to India as finance member of the viceroy's council in August 1883, again succeeding Evelyn Baring in office. Here he faced familiar financial problems, as the rising costs of the British military establishment and an unstable and weakening rupee rate of exchange put severe pressure on the revenues of British India. Colvin found that military demands, especially for the strengthening of the defences of the north-west frontier region against a possible invasion by Russia and the pacification of Burma, were hard to control, while the exchange costs of the depreciation of the silver rupee against gold meant that the government of India had to raise increased taxation to meet its fixed sterling expenditure in England on the home charges for military costs, pensions, and debt servicing. Colvin argued strongly for the British government to take action to stabilize the world price of silver, arguing that this posed a bigger threat to the raj than did the Russian army, but with no effect; instead, he was forced to impose politically sensitive new forms of taxation, including a reimposition of income tax and a 25 per cent increase in the salt excise.<br>
<br>As in Egypt, Colvin's political judgements in India were sophisticated. In 1883 he played a major role in diffusing the &#145;white mutiny&#146; which broke out over the proposals of the <span class="roman">Criminal Jurisdiction Bill (Ilbert Bill)</span> to increase the powers of Indian judges to try European civilians, arranging a compromise that allowed such defendants the right to claim a jury, at least half of whom were to be Europeans. The opposition to the <span class="roman">Ilbert Bill</span>, often expressed in racist, anti-Indian language, was widely seen as an attack on the liberal policies of the viceroy, Lord Ripon, who was closely identified with political and administrative reforms that increased Indian participation in the machinery of government. On Ripon's retirement in December 1884 Colvin defended his reputation in an article in <span class="italic">The Pioneer</span> (an English-language newspaper published in Allahabad) that drew attention to the limited vision and small-mindedness of the bulk of the expatriate community.<br>
<br>Colvin was appointed lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces in 1887. Here, as at Calcutta, he identified a clear link between the financial stability and political legitimacy of British rule in India. Increased taxation required increased representation, and Colvin urged that what he called &#145;leading native gentlemen&#146; should be associated with government policy through municipal self-government and provincial legislatures. To this end, he built up links between his administration and the large landowners of Oudh, founding Colvin Talukdars College to educate the sons of landed aristocrats; he also lent his support to the emerging strand of loyalist Muslim opinion centred around Saiyid Ahmad Khan, whom he had first supported as a young district officer in the 1860s. By contrast, Colvin campaigned vigorously, in the press and elsewhere, against the liberal nationalism of the Indian National Congress, and published an open correspondence with one of its founders, A. O. Hume, in <span class="italic">The Pioneer</span>. He was particularly critical of the levelling effect of the new franchise rules for local self-government in 1883, which gave access to municipal councils to professional and commercial men whose elevation he thought threatened the position of the established social and political order.<br>
<br>Colvin was created a CIE in October 1883 and was gazetted a KCSI in May 1892, six months before retirement. In England he settled at Earl Soham Lodge, Framlingham, Suffolk. From 1896 onwards he was chairman of the Burma Railways, the Egyptian Delta Railway, and the Khedival Mail Steamship Company, and was on a number of other company boards. He wrote <span class="italic">John Russell Colvin</span> (1895), the life of his father, for the <span class="roman">Rulers of India</span> series, and an account of Egyptian affairs in <span class="italic">The Making of Modern Egypt</span> (1906), which is not revealing of his own part in events and was quickly overshadowed by the rival polemics of William Scawen Blunt's <span class="italic">The Secret History of the English Occupation of Egypt</span> (1907) and Lord Cromer's <span class="italic">Modern Egypt</span> (1908). Colvin died at Suffolk House, Maple Road, Surbiton, Surrey, the residence of his eldest daughter, on 24 March 1908, and was buried at Earl Soham.<br>

<a name="cosubject_32519"></a><span class="headword">Sir Walter Mytton Colvin</span>  (1847&#150;1908), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, Sir Auckland's youngest brother, was born at Moulmein, Burma, on 13 September 1847 and was educated at Rugby School and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1871, went out to Allahabad the following year, and there built up a large practice as a criminal lawyer. He married in 1873 Annie, daughter of Wigram E. Money, and had a family of three daughters. He served for several terms as a nominated member of the legislative council of the North-Western Provinces, and was a prominent member of the government of India police commission of 1902&#150;3. He was knighted in 1904 and died at Allahabad on 16 December 1908, where he was buried.<br>
