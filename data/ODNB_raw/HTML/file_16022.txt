<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Langley,  Batty</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1696, <em>d.</em> 1751), <span class="occ">writer on architecture</span>, was baptized at the parish church of Twickenham, Middlesex, on 14 September 1696, the son of Daniel and Elizabeth Langley. Having been trained in his father's profession as a gardener, he moved into surveying and landscape gardening and was one of the earliest popularizers of the new irregular style advocated by Stephen Switzer in his <span class="italic">Ichnographia rustica</span> (1718). Langley published a few designs for irregular gardens in his <span class="italic">Practical Geometry</span> (1726), but his most important work on the subject was <span class="italic">New Principles of Gardening</span> (1728). This contained a variety of garden plans in what he called the &#145;arti-natural&#146; style, replete with twisted serpentine paths or meanders that prefigure Hogarth's &#145;line of beauty&#146; and signalled the emergence of the rococo style in England. Instead of pursuing the subject he knew best, however, he turned to architecture, which was more in demand but in which he had no practical experience and very limited ability.<br>
<br>In 1729 Langley left Twickenham for London; there he had temporary premises at Palladio's Head near Exeter Change in the Strand, from which he published <span class="italic">A Sure Guide to Builders</span> (1729). He and his second wife were residing in the parish of St John's, Smith Square, in 1732; by 1734 they had moved to Parliament Stairs, Westminster, and in 1738 they joined his younger brother <a href="#cosubject_16029">Thomas [<i>see below</i>]</a> and other members of the family at Meard's Court, Dean Street, Soho. While at Parliament Stairs, Batty started a school offering lessons in drawing, geometry, architecture, mensuration, mechanics, and garden design, advertised in <span class="italic">Ancient Masonry</span> (1736); the school continued on firmer footing at Meard's Court, where Batty Langley was assisted by Thomas. He also manufactured and sold a great variety of artificial stone ornaments for buildings, interiors, and gardens at his warehouse, the Hercules' Head, opposite St Paul's Wharf, adjoining the Falcon Stairs on the Bankside in Southwark (advertised in the <span class="italic">Daily Journal</span>, 10 March 1731). One of these, a medallion of Sir Isaac Newton, was presented by Langley to Sir Hans Sloane and is now in the British Museum.<br>
<br>Although Langley published advertisements (the first, dated 10 September 1736, in his <span class="italic">Ancient Masonry</span>) offering to make &#145;Designs for Buildings, Gardens, Parks, etc. in the most grand Taste&#146; and to design and build &#145;Grottos, Cascades, Caves, Temples, Pavilions, and other Rural Buildings of Pleasure&#146;  (B. Langley, <span class="italic">Ancient Masonry</span>, 1736), he had very little success as a practising architect. His only recorded buildings were &#145;a curious grotesque temple <i>in a taste entirely new</i>, finely decorated within with busts of King William II, George I, and five gentlemen of the Club of Liberty&#146;  (J. P. Malcolm, <span class="italic">Londinium redivicum</span>, 4, 1807, 172), built in 1734 or 1735 for Nathaniel Blackerby, deputy grand master of the grand lodge of freemasons, whose house adjoined his in Parliament Stairs, and a brewhouse for the duke of Kent at Wrest, Bedfordshire, in 1735. He competed unsuccessfully for the Mansion House in 1735 and the new bridge across the Thames at Westminster in 1736&#150;7. Both schemes were engraved and the latter was published with a descriptive text: it aroused a heated public controversy to which Langley contributed three more pamphlets, <span class="italic">A Reply to Mr John James's Review of the Several Pamphlets and Schemes</span> (1737), <span class="italic">A Survey of Westminster Bridge, as 'tis now Sinking into Ruin</span> (1748), and <span class="italic">Observations on a Pamphlet Lately Published &hellip; by Charles Marquand</span> (1749).<br>
<br>Langley's ineffectual entry into the arena of new public building in London was a direct outcome of his examination of James Ralph's <span class="italic">Critical Review of the Publick Buildings &hellip; in and about London and Westminster</span> (1734), which he published in the <span class="italic">Grub Street Journal</span> from July 1734 to March 1735. Shielded by the pseudonym Hiram, Langley viciously attacked the foreign, Palladian taste imposed by Lord Burlington, praising Gothic architecture (or native Saxon, as he preferred to call it) and the works of Hawksmoor, who was married to the daughter of his patron, Nathaniel Blackerby.<br>
<br>These xenophobic views are clearly related to Langley's freemasonic determination (and obligation) to improve the status of British craftsmen, and ultimately the country's architecture, by providing them with the information they needed on geometry and the classical orders&#151;the fundamentals of architecture&#151;in an easily understandable and affordable form. His output was prodigious, ranging from the largest architectural book of the period, <span class="italic">Ancient Masonry</span>, an unwieldy folio compendium containing over 450 plates, and issued in parts from 1733 to 1736, to the condensed vicesimo-quarto <span class="italic">The Workman's Golden Rule</span> (1750).<br>
<br>Langley's best-known work, <span class="italic">Ancient Architecture, Restored, and Improved</span>, was first published in 1741&#150;2 and reprinted in 1747 under the more explicit title <span class="italic">Gothic architecture, improved by rules and proportions, in many grand designs of columns, doors, windows, chimney-pieces &hellip; umbrellos, temples, pavilions &amp;c</span>. It was a significant departure from the mass of instructive builders' manuals which Langley churned out. An exceptional and original work, it was a pioneering attempt to give Gothic architecture the classical respectability of orders, motivated, as usual, by his interest in English freemasonry and handsomely engraved by his brother Thomas. Its novelty and light-hearted inventiveness, although scoffed at by amateur gothicists such as Horace Walpole and Thomas Gray, were just what many country squires wanted, prompting other architectural writers&#151;William Halfpenny, T. C. Overton, and William Pain in particular&#151;to follow Langley's lead. Among the several works executed from his published designs are doorways at Great Fulford, Devon, and the Ludlow police station; fireplaces at Shobdon church, Herefordshire, and Tissington Hall, Derbyshire; the Gothic temple at Bramham Park, Yorkshire; and the &#145;show&#146; front of the gate at Castletown, co. Kildare.<br>
<br>Langley was married twice: first, on 5 February 1719, to a Twickenham girl, Anne Smith, at St Anne's Church, Soho. They had four children before her death in June 1726. With his second wife, Catherine, he had ten more children: the first, John, was born in October 1732 and was followed by four sons, to whom he gave the masonic names Euclid, Vitruvius, Archimedes, and Hiram. He died at his house in Meard's Court, Soho on 3 March 1751.<br>
<br>His brother <a name="cosubject_16029"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Langley</span>  (1702&#150;1751?), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born at Twickenham in March 1702. He was employed as a sub-turnkey at Newgate prison in 1724, when Batty published his <span class="italic">Accurate Description of Newgate</span>, but was evidently trained as a gardener and contributed a few pedestrian plans for kitchen gardens to his brother's <span class="italic">New Principles of Gardening</span> (1728). He was also responsible for drawing the plates for this book, which include, apart from Batty's designs, copies of ruinscapes by Joachim von Sandrart from the brothers' remarkably large and wide-ranging collection of prints and books. By 1738 he was teaching drawing and engraving at Batty's academy in Meard's Court. His best and earliest known engravings were for <span class="italic">Ancient Architecture</span> (1741&#150;2). This was followed in 1746 by <span class="italic">The Plan and Elevations of Windsor Castle</span>, drawn by Batty. Most of his engraved work was for his brother's books; only two independent subjects are recorded, both of St Thomas's Church, Salisbury, after drawings by John Lyons. Michael Bryan's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Painters and Engravers</span> (1895 edn) gives the date of his death as 1751, but this is uncorroborated.<br>
