<span class="headword">William</span>, fifth earl of Mar  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1281), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of Duncan, fourth earl of Mar (<i>d</i>. 1242&times;4), and grandson of Morgrund, second earl of Mar (<i>d</i>. before 1183). He probably succeeded his father in 1243: Duncan was alive at an unspecified date in 1242, but William appears as earl, witnessing a charter of Alexander II, in February 1244. He also witnessed the agreement between Henry III of England and Alexander II in the same year. His right of succession was contested by Alan Durward (<i>d</i>. 1275), who asserted that William's father and grandfather were both of illegitimate birth and that he ought to succeed as lawful heir. But apparently the case was arranged on the footing of an agreement which had been made in the 1220s with Thomas Durward, father of Alan, who received a large accession of territory in Mar; the earldom remained with William.<br>
<br>Mar was one of those who accused the Durward faction of treachery at Christmas 1251, leading to their fall from power. In 1252 he was appointed chamberlain of Scotland, which office he held until 1255. In that year, owing to political dissensions, he was removed from the government and received a safe conduct from Henry III to visit the English court. In 1259 he was a party to the treaty between some of the Scots and Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (<i>d</i>. 1282), not to make peace with Henry III without one another's consent, notwithstanding Henry's agreement in the previous year to support him, along with the others in the newly emerging Scottish government, so long as they acted righteously. Despite the Scottish chronicles' condemnation of the Comyn regime, Mar remained active in government as Alexander III assumed personal control. He had again become chamberlain by 1264, and continued in the office until 1267. He was also sheriff of Dunbartonshire, and in the summer of 1264, following the battle of Largs in 1263, he was sent by Alexander III with a military force against the chiefs of the Western Isles who had supported Hakon IV, king of Norway. Bower claims that, in dispute with the bishop of Moray in 1268, Earl William was excommunicated, but he was nevertheless sent as an ambassador from Alexander III to Henry III, in a vain attempt to gain the honour of Huntingdon, in 1270.<br>
<br>Mar married Elizabeth, daughter of William Comyn, earl of Buchan; they had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18020/', "Donald")</script>, who succeeded as sixth earl, and possibly another, named Duncan. After Elizabeth's death in 1267 he married Muriel, daughter of Malise, earl of Strathearn, and granddaughter and one of the heirs of Robert Muschamp. She died in 1291, leaving no children. Mar probably died in 1281, since, although he was apparently alive at Michaelmas, his son Donald was styled earl in July.<br>
