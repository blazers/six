<span class="headword">O'Bryen,  Edward</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1753, <em>d.</em> 1808), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, details of whose parents and upbringing are unknown, served for nearly five years in the <i>Aeolus</i> (36 guns) in the Mediterranean, and for more than three years in the East Indies, in the <i>Prudent</i> (64 guns). He passed his examination on 9 August 1775, being then, according to his certificate, more than twenty-one. He was promoted lieutenant on 11 April 1778 and commanded the galley <i>Ferret</i>, part of Admiral Lord Howe's fleet in the encounter with d'Estaing at the battle of 11 August off Narragansett Bay. On 13 November he became a lieutenant in the <i>Ostrich</i> (16 guns) and six months later, 2 June 1779, he became second lieutenant in the <i>Ambuscade</i> (36 guns), attached to the Channel Fleet. On 1 March 1781 he was appointed first lieutenant to the <i>Actaeon</i> (44 guns), serving on the Jamaica station, and on 17 March 1783 he was promoted commander of the sloop <i>Jamaica</i> (16 guns). He was promoted to post rank on 14 June and on 6 August assumed command of the <i>Resistance</i> (44 guns) which he brought home and paid off in 1784.<br>
<br>During the peace O'Bryen was unemployed and it was not until 1 April 1795 that he was appointed captain of the <i>Southampton</i> (32 guns), before moving in June to command the <i>Windsor Castle</i> (90 guns), Rear-Admiral Robert Man's flagship, under Admiral William Hotham. The French put into Cadiz and were watched there by Man until 29 July 1796, when he left to rejoin Admiral John Jervis at San Fiorenzo. But Man neglected to bring essential stores from Gibraltar and Jervis sent him back there to remedy this. As Man returned he was sighted by a Spanish squadron and chased into Gibraltar. He called a council of his captains who decided to return to England. This &#145;extraordinary decision&#146;  (Laird Clowes, 4.287) reduced the Mediterranean Fleet by one third and left Jervis in a highly vulnerable position. When Man arrived home in the <i>Windsor Castle</i> he was censured, ordered to strike his flag, and not employed afloat again.<br>
<br>O'Bryen's association with this decision and the danger in which it placed Britain may explain why he was unemployed until 20 February 1797 when he was appointed to the <i>Nassau</i> (64 guns). He took command on 28 April 1797 when the <i>Nassau</i> was flying the flag of Vice-Admiral Richard Onslow at Yarmouth and formed part of the North Sea Fleet under Admiral Adam Duncan. Her crew, whose pay was nineteen months in arrears, were already mutinous and an attempt by O'Bryen to punish the insolent behaviour of one man by dismissing him from the ship was thwarted by the crew's resistance. The situation steadily deteriorated. The Nore mutineers sent delegates urging the North Sea Fleet to join them and on 26 May, when the <i>Nassau</i> was ordered to sail to join Duncan, she refused. Two days later the crew determined to hang the boatswain and a seaman for opposing them. When O'Bryen's arguments had no effect, he &#145;hove his hanger overboard and said if they were going to hang an officer he should be the first or heave himself overboard&#146;  (Lloyd, 289), but the crew would not allow this and the arguments continued until O'Bryen &#145;left them distracted&#146;  (ibid.) and seemed intent on suicide. When the <i>Nassau</i> ultimately followed other mutinous ships to Sheerness on 31 May, O'Bryen left her and though invited by the crew to return he refused to do so until the red flag had been hauled down. O'Bryen returned to the ship on 14 June &#145;on which the ship's company discovered the strongest inclination of regard and affection&#146;  (ibid., 295).<br>
<br>Onslow had shifted his flag to the <i>Adamant</i> (50 guns) after 26 May and on 25 July transferred to the <i>Monarch</i> (74 guns). O'Bryen, who had been appointed his flag captain on 4 July, took a distinguished part in the battle of Camperdown on 11 October 1797. Leading the larboard division, the <i>Monarch</i> approached the Dutch line and when O'Bryen reported he could see no gap to pass through Onslow replied &#145;the <i>Monarch</i> will make a passage&#146;  (R. D. Franks, &#145;Admiral Sir Richard Onslow&#146;, <span class="italic">Mariner's Mirror</span>, 67, 1981, 335), and insisted no shot be fired until the Dutch vice-admiral was separated from the vessel astern of him. The <i>Monarch</i> passed between the Dutch ships <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Haarlem</i>, firing into each and then concentrating on Rear-Admiral Reyntjes's <i>Jupiter</i>. The Dutch frigate <i>Monnikendam</i> gallantly but vainly threw herself between the two only to receive the full blast of <i>Monarch's</i> second broadside. Onslow's concentration brought nine British ships against five Dutch, four of which surrendered within the next hour. The <i>Monarch</i>'s casualties, 36 killed, 100 wounded, her hull riddled with shot, are evidence that she bore the brunt of heavy fighting. O'Bryen himself refuted a later insinuation, made to George III, that Onslow was lucky to have him as his captain  (Stirling, 1.55). But O'Bryen must have been very busy in the months following the battle, when Onslow took command of the North Sea Fleet, until Duncan rejoined in August 1798. The <i>Monarch</i> returned to Yarmouth for repairs but was in the North Sea again in early October meeting heavy gales before being relieved in December.<br>
<br>O'Bryen does not appear to have been employed between 1798 and the end of the war. He is said to have commanded the <i>Kent</i> (74 guns) in the Mediterranean between 1801 and 1803, but was invalided in May of that year. He had no further service, retiring to his house at Cattisfield, Hampshire. He was married to Mary Alsop of London, who died some time in the spring of 1807, at Cattisfield, after a lingering illness, leaving a daughter, Mary. In April 1808 O'Bryen married Mrs Martha Charlotte Bradby of Cattisfield; they had no children, but an earlier liaison had left an illegitimate son, John Cavendish, to whom O'Bryen left 20 guineas in his will.<br>
<br>Although O'Bryen was employed during the war with the American colonies, his slow promotion and unemployment between 1783 and 1795 illustrates a lack of influential patronage. However, his reputation as a brave and professional officer finally brought appointment, though on a station, the North Sea, not noted for prize money. The mutiny on the <i>Nassau</i> was the result of long-standing grievances and the crew expressed their respect and affection for him. But to be associated with failure or mutiny, however blameless, was to have a black mark against one's name, no less significant for being invisible. Thereafter ill health prevented the possibility of a more exciting career in the Napoleonic wars. Promoted rear-admiral of the blue on 9 November 1805 and of the white on 28 April 1808, O'Bryen died on 18 December 1808 at Cattisfield. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
