<span class="headword">Ogilvie,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1635), <span class="occ">abbot of W&uuml;rzburg</span>, was probably from north-east Scotland, for he used the arms of the Ogilvies of Deskford, Banffshire. Nothing is known of his parentage or early life, but the description &#145;senex&#146; on his tombstone suggests he was probably born no later than 1575. Converted to Catholicism, he entered the Scots Benedictine monastery at W&uuml;rzburg, Germany, probably in 1598, at which time the mutual relationship of the three Scots monasteries in Regensburg, W&uuml;rzburg, and Erfurt was not defined. Ogilvie, elected abbot of Erfurt in the winter of 1611&#150;12, was administrator of Regensburg the following winter and in 1613 returned to W&uuml;rzburg.<br>
<br>On 22 January 1615 Ogilvie was elected abbot of W&uuml;rzburg. From the start he was subject only to the bishop. His firm and efficient rule led to growth in numbers and prestige, helped greatly by the recent discovery of the grave of St Macarius, its reputedly saintly founder, whose relics became the focus of growing devotion and visits by pilgrims. Prestige was also increased by associates of the Jesuit martyr John Ogilvie entering as novices. The arrival in particular of John Mayne (Silvanus in religion) led to plans for the Scots monks to undertake mission work in Scotland. When Mayne procrastinated William Ogilvie was, in 1629, put in charge of the enterprise by Rome.<br>
<br>Ogilvie began his abbacy with six resident monks. By 1625 there were twelve and he built a residential block and a gatehouse. Four young monks matriculated at W&uuml;rzburg University, then in 1628 Ogilvie was elected its rector magnificus. The bishop made him judge in an ecclesiastical court and in 1627&#150;8 appointed him administrator of Schwarzach Abbey nearby.<br>
<br>The Thirty Years' War was raging and Swedish protestant forces came to W&uuml;rzburg in October 1631. This was Ogilvie's finest hour. As the notables fled he remained and was the town's delegate to treat with the Swedes. Exactly three years later he played a notable part in the recapture of the town. Both during and after the Swedish occupation he was an official for regulating church affairs. Within a year, however, on 17 September 1635, he died.<br>
<br>The wars caused enormous destruction in south Germany. The Scots monks were scattered; Ogilvie's achievements were largely destroyed. It was, however, his monastic recruits, notably Alexander Baillie, who administered all three abbeys after the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle and helped to rebuild their fortunes. W&uuml;rzburg monks continued to work in Scotland. Ogilvie, the greatest of the W&uuml;rzburg abbots, was described on his tombstone in the abbey church as &#145;de Franconia bene meritus&#146; (&#145;deserving of Franconia's gratitude&#146;).<br>
