<span class="headword">Houldsworth, Sir  William Henry</span>, first baronet  (1834&#150;1917), <span class="occ">cotton industrialist and politician</span>, was born on 20 August 1834 at Ardwick, Manchester, the fourth son of Henry Houldsworth (1797&#150;1868), cotton spinner, and his first wife, Helen, daughter of James Hamilton of Glasgow and his wife, Ann. He was educated at Mr Jackson's school, Broughton, and in 1852 matriculated at St Andrews University. On 20 August 1862 Houldsworth married Elisabeth Graham Crum (<i>d</i>. 1923), daughter of Walter Crum FRS, calico printer; they had three daughters and two surviving sons.<br>
<br>Houldsworth's early business life was spent in the family's fine-cotton spinning mills in central Manchester. Then, having taken over the firm, he conducted an unusual experiment in community building: he erected two new mills in 1865 and 1872 at Reddish, near Stockport, around which were added over the next twenty years some houses and a school, together with a working men's club, a parsonage, and a church (the work of Alfred Waterhouse and a reflection of Houldsworth's deeply felt high-church sentiments). As a community Houldsworth's scheme was at best a limited success, but his firm now led Manchester's fine-spinning trade, employing more than 1000 workers and owning some 296,000 spindles.<br>
<br>Entrepreneurial prominence proved a vital asset to Houldsworth's political ambitions. For, although abandoning his father's dissenting Liberalism, he followed other Anglican cotton masters in seeking to create a working-class base for toryism in Manchester. As president of its Conservative Association, he did much to reorganize the party locally. He stood for parliament unsuccessfully in 1880 before winning a Manchester seat at a by-election in 1883; thereafter he held Manchester North-West from 1885 until 1906. Although his advocacy of a democratic national organization proved fruitless, his contribution to the growing tory ascendancy in Lancashire was suitably recognized by a baronetcy in 1887.<br>
<br>Within parliament Houldsworth proved a capable advocate of local and national concerns, the chief of which became monetary reform. For, believing that the bimetallic standard offered the most eligible remedy for the widely perceived &#145;depression&#146; in British industry in the 1880s, Houldsworth participated in a vigorous nationwide campaign, energizing the Manchester Bimetallic League (based on the old Anti-Corn Law model), speaking volubly, and writing expertly on this exotic theme. In 1892 he was the most avid bimetallist among the British delegation to the Brussels International Monetary Conference. Houldsworth also represented Britain at the Berlin Labour Conference of 1890 and, as one of the most widely respected businessmen within the Conservative Party, he was often spoken of as a potential minister of commerce. Interestingly, after 1903 Houldsworth became one of the minority of cotton magnates ready to lend his name to Chamberlain's tariff reform campaign; this entailed bitter local controversy and his own retirement from active politics in 1906. Closely involved with the National Conservative Temperance Union and the Church of England Temperance Society, Houldsworth also pursued the cause of sobriety with a vigour unusual in the tory party.<br>
<br>Politics had not in any way diminished Houldsworth's business enthusiasm. Beyond his cotton interests, he reorganized the affairs of his family's Scottish ironworks and coalmines in the early twentieth century. But above all, in 1898 he led what resulted in the most successful early merger in the English cotton industry, from which the Fine Spinners and Doublers Association was formed and of which his own firm was the largest founder member. Even if the creative energies lay elsewhere, Houldsworth's masterly business diplomacy contributed much to the success of this business venture, which on his retirement as chairman in 1908 was Britain's largest manufacturing company with more than 30,000 employees.<br>
<br>Popular, shrewd, kindly, and energetic, Houldsworth also served on the Lancashire county council, the Manchester chamber of commerce, the Manchester diocesan board of education, and the court of Manchester University, which made him an honorary LLD. He was granted the freedom of the city of Manchester in 1905. In his later years he moved from his Cheshire home at Norbury Booth's Hall to his Coodham estate near Kilmarnock in Scotland, where he had erected a fine chapel, embellished with windows by F. J. Shields. Here he continued to enjoy organ playing as well as golf, fishing, and shooting. Houldsworth's Lancashire links were now largely severed, as his sons had turned towards Scottish acres and Highland regiments.<br>
<br>Houldsworth died on 18 April 1917 at Coodham, and he was interred three days later in the burial-ground on the estate. He was also commemorated by a clock tower within the Houldsworth conservation area set up in Stockport in the 1980s.<br>
