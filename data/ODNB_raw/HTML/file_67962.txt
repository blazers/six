<span class="headword">Haward,  Charles</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1668&#150;1689), <span class="occ">musical instrument maker</span>, was part of a family of harpsichord, spinet, and virginal makers living and working in the City of London. Nothing is known of his parents, or of his early life, but his earliest surviving instrument, a single-manual harpsichord, is signed and dated &#145;Carolus Haward 1683&#146;, while the latest is a wing spinet signed &#145;Carolus Haward fecit 1689&#146;. The one harpsichord noted above plus seven wing spinets have survived, and a further four surviving spinets are probably from his workshop. He lived in Aldgate Street, London, as is evidenced by a well-known excerpt from the diary of Samuel Pepys for 4 April 1668:<blockquote>Up betimes, and by coach to White-hall, took Aldgate street in my way, and there called upon one Hayward that makes virginalls, and did there like of a little Espinettes and will have him finish them for me: for I had a mind to a small Harpsicon, but this takes up less room and will do my business as to finding out of Chords&#151;and I am very well pleased that I have found it.</blockquote>It seems that Pepys called again on Haward on 13 July 1668, and on 15 July he took delivery of the spinet: the cost was &pound;5. In 1672 Haward was referred to by Thomas Salmon in his <span class="italic">Vindication of an Essay to the Advancement of Music</span> (1672) in the statement: &#145;A curious pair of Phanatical Harpsichords made by that Arch Heretick Charles Haward&#146;  (p. 68). The exact meaning of a pair of &#145;Phanatical Harpsichords&#146; is unclear, as is the reason for Salmon's description of Haward as an &#145;Arch Heretick&#146;.<br>
<br>However, the esteem in which Haward's work was held can be judged from the fact that Queen Anne was said to have highly prized a virginal by him&#151;but the loose way in which the terms &#145;spinet&#146; and &#145;virginal&#146; were applied to the smaller domestic instruments in the seventeenth century makes it unclear whether the instrument was a wing-shaped spinet as bought by Pepys, or the rectangular coffer-shaped instrument built in England in the period 1641&#150;84, of which only nineteen survive.<br>
<br>A transcript from the lord chamberlain's accounts relating to music and musicians records a payment in 1674 of &pound;6 10<i>s</i>. &#145;for mending the harpsichords and pedalls in the Great Hall in the Privy Lodgings and for the private musick, for 2 whole years&#146;, and in the next year &pound;2 was paid to &#145;Mr. Haward, the virginall-maker, for mending the harpsichords&#146;  (Lafontaine). The mention of &#145;pedalls&#146; may indicate that it is John Haward (<i>fl</i>. 1649&#150;1667) to whom the payment was made, for Thomas Mace, <span class="italic">Musick's Monument</span> (1676) has a long and interesting section (pages 235&#150;6) on &#145;the Pedal&#146; (for changing the registration of a harpsichord) &#145;contriv'd &hellip; by one Mr. <i>John Hayward</i> of London&#146;. So far as is known, Charles Haward did not make such pedals. This John Haward was almost certainly a relative of Charles Haward, as was also probably a third member of the family, Thomas Haward (<i>fl</i>. 1656&#150;1663).<br>
