<span class="headword">Whish, Sir  William Sampson</span>  (1787&#150;1853), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, was the son of Richard Whish (<i>d</i>. 1810), rector of West Walton, Norfolk, and vicar of Wickford, Essex, and his wife, Philippa, daughter of William Sandys. He was born at Northwold, Norfolk, on 27 February 1787. He received a commission as lieutenant in the Bengal artillery on 21 August 1804, and arrived in India in December. He was promoted captain on 13 May 1807, and commanded the rocket troop of horse artillery of the centre division of the grand army under the marquess of Hastings in the Pindari and Anglo-Maratha wars at the end of 1817 and beginning of 1818. He afterwards took the troop to Meerut, where, on 26 July 1820, he was appointed to act as brigade major. He was promoted major on 19 July 1821.<br>
<br>Whish married, in 1809, a daughter of George Dixon, and his eldest son, G. Palmer Whish, general of the Bengal staff corps, served with his father at Gujrat. Another son, Henry Edward Whish, major-general of the Bengal staff corps, served with his father at the siege of Multan, and was in the Indian mutiny campaign.<br>
<br>Whish commanded the 1st brigade of horse artillery in the army assembled at Agra, under Lord Combermere, in December 1825, for the siege of Bharatpur. The place was captured by assault on 18 January 1826, and Whish was mentioned in dispatches and promoted lieutenant-colonel for distinguished service in the field from 19 January. On 23 December 1826 he was appointed to command the Karnal and Sirhind division of artillery. He received the CB, military division, in 1838; was appointed a colonel commandant of artillery, with rank of brigadier-general and with a seat on the military board, on 21 December; and in February 1839 he succeeded Major-General Faithful in command of the presidency division of artillery at Dum-Dum. He was promoted major-general on 23 November 1841, and went on furlough to England until the end of 1847.<br>
<br>Whish was appointed to the command at Lahore of the Punjab division on 23 January 1848. In August he was given the command of the Multan field force, 8000 strong, to operate against Mulraj, the Muslim governor of Multan province, and towards the end of the month took up a position in front of Multan. The siege commenced on 7 September, but, owing to the defection of Sher Singh a week later, Whish withdrew his forces to Tibi, and a period of inaction followed, which enabled Mulraj to improve his defences and to increase his garrison in Multan. At the beginning of November Mulraj prepared batteries which threatened Whish's camp, and on 7 November a successful action resulted in the destruction of Mulraj's advanced batteries and the capture of five guns. On 21 December Whish was reinforced by a column from Bombay, and on Christmas day was able to occupy his old position before Multan. On 27 December the enemy were driven from the suburbs, and the siege recommenced on 28 December. The city was captured on 2 January 1849, and the siege of the citadel pressed forward. On 22 January Mulraj surrendered the citadel rather than face an assault.<br>
<br>Leaving a strong garrison in Multan, Whish marched to join Lord Gough, capturing the fort of Chiniot on 9 February, on which day the advanced portion of his force reached Ramnagar. Anticipating Lord Gough's orders, Whish secured the fords of the Chenab at Wazirabad, and on 21 February commanded the 1st division of Lord Gough's army at the battle of Gujrat. He received the thanks of the governor-general, of the court of directors of the East India Company, and of both houses of parliament. He was made KCB, military division, and was transferred to the command of the Bengal division of the army in March. In October 1851 he was appointed to the Cis-Jhelum division, but before assuming command went on furlough, &#145;driven home by extreme ill health&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 437). He was promoted lieutenant-general on 11 November 1851. Having come from Cheltenham for medical treatment, he died at Claridge's Hotel, Brook Street, London, on 25 February 1853.<br>
