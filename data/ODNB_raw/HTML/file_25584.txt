<span class="headword">Simpson, Sir  James Young</span>, first baronet  (1811&#150;1870), <span class="occ">physician and obstetrician</span>, born on 7 June 1811 at Bathgate, Linlithgowshire, was the seventh son and youngest of eight children of the village bakers, David Simpson (1760&#150;1830) and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1820), daughter of John Jarvey. Both his mother, who was of Huguenot descent, and his father came from families long established as small farmers in east central Scotland.<br>
<br>Simpson's mother died when he was nine and his sister, Mary, played a substantial role in his upbringing. He attended the local parish school, where he was taught by a Mr Taylor, who had a reputation as an exceptional teacher. Simpson was soon identified as a promising scholar and his father and brothers committed themselves to providing him with the financial support necessary for a college education. Simpson enrolled as an arts student at Edinburgh University in 1825, aged fourteen, and began his medical studies two years later. He supplemented the official medical course by attending extramural classes, notably those in surgery offered by Robert Liston. Simpson became a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1830 and graduated MD in 1832. The quality of his MD thesis (on inflammation) attracted the attention of John Thomson, professor of pathology, who appointed Simpson as his assistant. Simpson was elected senior president of the Royal Medical Society of Edinburgh in 1835, in which year he also embarked upon a European tour, visiting the Paris hospitals. In 1836, while teaching pathology, Simpson secured an appointment to the City Lying-in Hospital in Edinburgh and began to practise midwifery on his own behalf. He undertook research into the diseases of the placenta, and in 1839 began to give extramural lectures on obstetrics. Later that same year he was appointed to Edinburgh University's chair of midwifery. From then on his practice grew rapidly, both in obstetrics and in general medicine.<br>
<br>Since his days as a medical student Simpson had been greatly concerned with the problem of surgical pain. Following earlier experiments in the United States, the first trial of ether as a surgical anaesthetic in a major British centre was undertaken by Robert Liston in University College Hospital, London, on 21 December 1846. Simpson was fired with enthusiasm by Liston's success. On 19 January 1847 he tried ether in a labour complicated by a deformation of the pelvis. Immediately convinced of the utility of anaesthesia he enthusiastically advocated its general adoption. He was using ether routinely within his obstetric practice by the end of 1847, employing an inhaler of his own design. Ether, however, had several disadvantages as an anaesthetic, particularly in domiciliary practice, and Simpson sought to find a substitute. David Waldie, chemist to the Liverpool Apothecaries' Company, suggested that the properties of chloroform might be worth investigating. On 4 November 1847 Simpson and his assistants, George Keith and James Matthews Duncan, tried inhaling a sample, probably supplied by the Edinburgh pharmaceutical company Duncan and Flockhart. In a very short time they collapsed, unconscious, dramatically displaying the substance's efficacy as an anaesthetic. Chloroform was first employed on an obstetric case on 8 November and its first public trial in surgery was successfully undertaken, by Professor James Miller, on 10 November in the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. On 20 November 1847, a preliminary report was published in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>.<br>
<br>As the leading advocate of obstetric anaesthesia Simpson met with much opposition and prejudice. Whereas the incorporation of anaesthesia within operative obstetrical procedures was relatively uncontroversial, Simpson's extension of its use to alleviate the pains of normal labour excited considerable criticism. A number of medical, clerical, and lay commentators took the view that parturition pains were either salutary or divinely sanctioned or both. But Simpson's advocacy prevailed and anaesthesia, generally with chloroform, quickly became standard obstetric practice. However, though in many ways more convenient than ether, chloroform had its own dangers, and there were deaths from overdosage or adverse reactions before safer anaesthetic agents were found. Nevertheless, credit must go to Simpson for establishing that the relief of pain should be central to an obstetrician's professional concerns.<br>
<br>The introduction of chloroform anaesthesia made Simpson internationally famous. He also made a considerable number of other major contributions, including several technical advances in the practice of obstetrics. He improved the technique of version&#151;manual turning of the foetus&#151;in cases of deformed pelvis; he refined the design of the obstetric forceps; and he pioneered the development of the vacuum extractor. Despite his interest in technological aids Simpson's obstetric practice was significantly, and influentially, more patient and less interventionist than that of many of his colleagues. He was a vigorous champion of breastfeeding and understood the importance of what was later termed as &#145;bonding&#146; between mother and baby.<br>
<br>Simpson's introduction of a better uterine sound and his invention of the sponge tent technique to produce dilation of the cervix greatly improved the scope of gynaecological diagnosis, even if it required the introduction of aseptic methods for the full potential of these innovations to be realized. Simpson encouraged the development of the operation of ovariotomy and of the surgical repair of vaginal fistula. A study on hermaphroditism was a detailed and influential exposition of a complex subject. Simpson believed that the hermaphrodite was the only true representative of a species:<blockquote>the natural characters of any species of animal are certainly not to be sought for solely either in the system of the male or in that of the female; but &hellip; they are to be found in those properties which are common to both sexes, and which we have seen combined together by nature upon the bodies of an unnatural hermaphrodite, or evolved from the interference of art upon the castrated male or spayed female. (Moscucci, 21)</blockquote>Simpson's innovation of acupressure, a technique for controlling arterial haemorrhage after surgery by pinning the ends of the damaged vessels against the underlying tissue, failed to attain the success he predicted. Nevertheless, his book on the subject, <span class="italic">Acupressure</span> (1864), constituted a major study of wound healing and of the effects of the occlusion of blood vessels. Throughout his career, Simpson was a prolific author of clinical and scientific papers, and for a time he was the proprietor and principal editor of the <span class="italic">Monthly Journal of Medical Sciences</span>.<br>
<br>Some of the most important work of the later part of Simpson's career concerned the complex problems of hospital infection and surgical sepsis. In 1850 Simpson argued that puerperal fever and surgical fever were identical and that both were contagious. He believed that victims of puerperal fever had been &#145;inoculated with a materia morbi &hellip; and this materia morbi is liable to be inoculated by the fingers of the attendant&#146;  (J. Y. Simpson, 414), in a manner analogous to smallpox inoculation. This was still an unpopular idea as late as the 1860s. Simpson advocated that the preventive methods which obstetricians had developed against puerperal fever, which principally entailed careful cleansing of hands and instruments, should be adopted by surgeons against wound sepsis.<br>
<br>Simpson also held post-operative surgical infection to be closely related to defects in the design, ventilation, and management of large hospitals, coining the term &#145;hospitalism&#146; to describe the morbid conditions so caused. He collected a mass of statistical data to substantiate this relationship, noting in particular that the frequency of death after amputation was highest in large hospitals and lowest where the operation had taken place at home or in a cottage hospital. He also remarked upon a similar pattern in puerperal fever, the incidence of which was much higher in large lying-in hospitals. Simpson put forward a number of innovative ideas on hospital design, maintaining that alterations in layout and management, in particular the housing of patients in small isolated units, could improve the hospital environment to such an extent that the incidence of septic disorders would be greatly diminished. He first articulated this position in 1849 and his views were influential upon many later commentators on hospital conditions, including Florence Nightingale.<br>
<br>Despite his support for a theory of contagion, Simpson, like many of his contemporaries, opposed the Listerian reforms and the Pasteurian germ theory of disease. He held that the answer to surgical sepsis lay not in carbolic wound dressings (which in any case were not, as he pointedly noted, original to Lister) but in the improved design and management of hospitals. He also felt that Lister's sterile catgut ligature was an unnecessary innovation since his own invention of acupressure provided, in his opinion, a better and safer means of controlling post-operative bleeding.<br>
<br>Simpson was formidable in debate and controversy. His sustained opposition to homoeopathy, which he regarded as mere quackery and self-delusion, is noteworthy. He was a major advocate of the importance of science for medical education and practice and was closely involved in the mid-century campaign for medical reform legislation. He was also engaged in the medical planning for the Crimean War and was particularly interested in Isambard Kingdom Brunel's prefabricated pavilion hospital, aspects of which coincided with some of his own principles of hospital design. Less creditably perhaps, Simpson played a full and active role in the internecine quarrelling between the professors which was so characteristic of the Edinburgh medical faculty at this time. The mutual antipathy between Simpson and James Syme, professor of clinical surgery, was particularly bitter and long-lasting. Professional rivalry between the two professors occasioned many disputes, springing largely from what Syme perceived as Simpson's encroachments into what should be considered the rightful sphere of the surgeon. Simpson's proposed innovation of acupressure, for example, received withering criticism from Syme.<br>
<br>An inspiring and vigorous personality Simpson was a most successful lecturer and practitioner. He was always ready to attend the poor, often neglecting to collect a fee. Liberal in his social attitudes he advanced the cause of foreign students in Edinburgh and supported the medical education of women. Emily Blackwell, younger sister of Elizabeth, worked for a time as one of his assistants. He was also a supporter of the anti-slavery movement. His Edinburgh house was a meeting place for people from many walks of life, and a hospitable lodging for many medical visitors to the city. He enjoyed conviviality and believed in the health-giving virtues of red wine. He was a devout adherent of the Free Church of Scotland, but would not sign the Westminster confession of faith, because of its literal interpretation of the book of <span class="roman">Genesis</span>.<br>
<br>In 1847 Simpson was appointed one of the queen's physicians for Scotland; and he became a foreign associate of the Academy of Medicine, Paris, the members insisting on his election against the appointing commission which had omitted his name. In 1850, at the remarkably young age of thirty-nine, he was elected president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. In 1856 he was awarded the Monthyon prize by the French Academy of Sciences, for &#145;most important benefits done to humanity&#146;. He received the order of St Olaf from the king of Sweden, and was made an honorary member of nearly every major medical society in Europe and America. In 1866 he was awarded an honorary DCL degree by Oxford University, and in the same year he received a baronetcy, the first given to a doctor practising in Scotland. In 1868 he was awarded the freedom of the city of Edinburgh. A man of wide interests Simpson also devoted much time and energy to archaeological and literary studies. He published work on antiquarian subjects, including leprosy and syphilis in fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Scotland. In 1861 he was elected professor of antiquities by the Royal Scottish Academy.<br>
<br>Simpson married, on 26 December 1839, his cousin Jessie (<i>d</i>. 1870), daughter of Walter Grindlay of Liverpool. Five of their nine children died before him. Having suffered from angina pectoris for a few months, Simpson himself died on 6 May 1870 at his house, Strathavan, 52 Queen Street, Edinburgh. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son Walter Grindlay (1843&#150;1898). Simpson's family declined the offer of a grave in Westminster Abbey, and he was buried on 13 May in Warriston cemetery, Edinburgh; the city accorded him a public funeral, which was a major civic occasion. His wife survived him by only a few weeks. A statue was erected to him in Princes Street, but the Simpson Memorial Maternity Hospital, built at the expense of his friends, was his principal monument in Edinburgh. He was also honoured by the placing of a bust in Westminster Abbey, on which it is recorded that to Simpson's &#145;genius and benevolence the world owes the blessings derived from the use of chloroform for the relief of suffering&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
