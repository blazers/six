<span class="headword">Owen,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1598), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Condover, Shropshire, the eldest son of Richard Owen, a merchant and alderman of Shrewsbury, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1562), daughter of Thomas Ottley of Shrewsbury. He graduated BA from the University of Oxford on 17 April 1559, as a member of either Broadgates Hall or Christ Church. He was admitted in 1562 to Lincoln's Inn, where he was called to the bar in 1570 and made a bencher in 1579.<br>
<br>By 1572 Owen married Sarah (<i>d</i>. in or before 1594), daughter of Humphrey Baskerville. The couple had five sons, including <a href="#cosubject_21029">Sir Roger Owen [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and five daughters. Owen was JP for Shropshire from about 1583 and for most other counties from about 1595. He was Lent reader in 1583, and served Lincoln's Inn as treasurer between 1588 and 1589. In 1589 he was created serjeant-at-law, and he was made queen's serjeant on 25 January 1593. On 21 January 1594 he was made a judge of the court of common pleas. He was rumoured to be a candidate for the vacant mastership of the court of wards in 1598, but died before any steps could be taken to fill the position. Owen married for a second time in 1594 or 1595, becoming third husband to Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilkes (1547&#150;1613) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20984/', "Owen, Alice")</script>], the third child of Thomas Wilkes of London and widow of William Elkin (1523&#150;1593) of London. They had no children. Owen was a man of wide culture, his library at his death containing books in French, Italian, and Spanish as well as the more technical works of common law. Owen was without doubt a capable technical lawyer, but he was above all a man of very sound and reliable judgement, &#145;a noted counsellor, and much resorted to for advice&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.673). From a relatively early stage of his career he was frequently called upon by the privy council to carry out a variety of commissions, and he was employed by William Cecil, Baron Burghley, in the attempts to arrange a marriage between his granddaughter and William Somerset, Baron Herbert. He attempted, perhaps for a time successfully, to defuse a serious contretemps between the courts of king's bench and common pleas; and as recorder of Shrewsbury (1588&#150;92) he permitted the continued observance of popular customs opposed by the more puritanical faction in the town.<br>
<br>Owen maintained strong connections with Shrewsbury throughout his life, serving the borough in various ways and representing it in 1584 in parliament, where he was active on a range of committees, including those concerning common informers (9 December 1584) and delays of executions (5 March 1585). He purchased land in the vicinity, and was responsible for the building of Condover Hall, described as the finest Elizabethan stone manor house in Shropshire. Although his professional life required him to live in London, it was Condover that he regarded as his main residence at the end of his life. He was a member of the queen's council in the marches of Wales from 1590, though he does not appear to have taken an especially active part in its business. Owen made his will on 9 December 1598, leaving the bulk of his property to his heir, but with substantial provision for his other children. He also made bequests to the poor of Shrewsbury, Condover, and Westminster, while his wife got much of his household goods. He died on 21 December 1598 and, despite his direction that his funeral be simple, was buried in Westminster Abbey. His widow later founded a school in Islington, Middlesex, and was a notably charitable benefactress.<br>
<br>Owen's son <a name="cosubject_21029"></a><span class="headword">Sir Roger Owen</span>  (1572/3&#150;1617), <span class="occ">landowner and lawyer</span>, was seventeen at the time of his matriculation at Christ Church on 30 October 1590. He was educated at Shrewsbury School from 1583, entered Lincoln's Inn in 1589, and graduated BA from Christ Church on 5 February 1592. He was called to the bar in 1597. Owen's local consequence was reflected in his appointment to the quorum of the peace from 1601 to 1614. He was returned as MP for Shrewsbury in 1601, 1605, 1610, and 1614, was a member of the council in the marches of Wales from 1602 to 1607, was sheriff of Shropshire from 1603 to 1604, and was knighted on 30 May 1604. He was a notable parliamentarian, who spoke against the <span class="roman">Pluralities Bill</span> on 16 November 1601 and opposed James VI and I's efforts to levy impositions by his own will, being one of the MPs deputed on 21 May 1610 to confer with the House of Lords on the issue. This led to his loss of royal favour, and he was removed from the commission of the peace when the 1614 parliament was prorogued. Owen continued his association with Lincoln's Inn, becoming a bencher in 1611, treasurer in 1612 (to 1613), and barrister in 1613. He married Ursula (<i>bap</i>. 1587), only child of William Elkin, of London, and his wife, Alice (Owen's stepmother). They had two daughters. Owen died intestate in London on 29 May 1617 and was buried at Condover on 5 June, being succeeded by his brother Sir William Owen.<br>
