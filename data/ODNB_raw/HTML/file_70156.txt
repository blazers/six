<span class="headword">Lerner,  Meyer</span>  (1857&#150;1930), <span class="occ">rabbi</span>, was born in Czestochowa, Poland, on 10 March 1857, the son of Mordechai Lerner, a leather merchant. At the age of nine he was sent to the <i>yeshivah</i> (Talmudic college) of Biala. Between the ages of thirteen and sixteen he studied in Eisenstadt, near Vienna, under Rabbi Salomon Kutner, to whom he had been recommended by his uncle Rabbi Abraham Jener, the <i>av bet din</i> (senior judge of the Jewish ecclesiastical court) of Cracow. Rabbi Kutner in turn recommended the promising student to Rabbi Ezriel Hildesheimer of the Adas Yisroel Synagogue in Berlin, who had been his predecessor at Eisenstadt and was one of the foremost exponents of neo-Orthodoxy in Europe. While remaining strictly Orthodox, Hildesheimer and his school were imbued with the scholarly spirit of the German <span class="italic">Wissenschaft des Judentums</span> that set a high value on a secular as well as a religious education. Hildesheimer became Lerner's patron, paying for private instruction in Greek and Latin and transferring him to the Orthodox rabbinical seminary that he had founded in Berlin. At the Hildesheimer Seminar, Lerner continued his studies under Rabbi David Zvi Hoffmann, and his <i>semicha</i> (rabbinical ordination) was conferred by Hildesheimer himself.<br>
<br>At twenty-one Lerner matriculated at Berlin University, where he studied philosophy and oriental languages. His treatise <span class="italic">Bereshit Rabba</span> (Midrashic commentary on the book of <span class="roman">Genesis</span>) was awarded a prize in 1879, and three years later he gained his doctorate at the University of Leipzig. In 1886 Lerner married Henriette, a daughter of Rabbi Hirsch Plato of Cologne and a granddaughter of the outstanding exponent of German neo-Orthodoxy Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch.<br>
<br>Lerner was appointed rabbi of Wintzenheim, near Colmar in Alsace, in 1884 and remained there for six years. In January 1890 he was one of four shortlisted candidates for chief minister of the London Federation of Synagogues, a post especially created and underwritten by Samuel Montagu, banker and Liberal MP for Whitechapel. Montagu had founded the federation in 1887 as an umbrella body for the multitude of independent synagogues and prayer circles (<i>hevrot</i>) that had grown up among Jewish immigrants in the East End of London. A semi-public preaching competition was held at the Jewish Workingmen's Club, Great Alie Street, east London, from which Lerner emerged as the winner by thirty votes to six. Lerner took up residence at 46 Great Prescott Street, Aldgate, and concerned himself with the religious needs of his Yiddish-speaking neighbours. He founded the Sabbath Observance Society to assist Jews to keep the Jewish sabbath (from sunset on Friday to nightfall on Saturday), notwithstanding the considerable economic pressures dictating otherwise. In the autumn of 1892, together with Montagu, Lerner successfully intervened to save 100 Jewish tailors from losing their jobs in a non-Jewish firm because they refused to work on the Jewish festival of <i>Succot</i> (Tabernacles). Part of his job was to preach against the &#145;Jewish Socialists, Atheists and Nihilists&#146; who were regarded by the Anglo-Jewish establishment as a deleterious influence on East End Jewry.<br>
<br>Lerner was taken aback at the poor standard of Jewish education in England. In 1890&#150;92 he carried out a thorough investigation into the state of Hebrew education. His report found both the traditional system of religious study in the <i>heder</i> (private schoolroom) and the education on offer in state board schools, and even in the Jews' Free School, to be wanting. He proposed sweeping reform of the system and advocated the use of English as the language of instruction rather than Yiddish. Lerner's initiatives met with a disappointing response but sowed the seeds for the later formation of the Jewish Religious Education Board.<br>
<br>The chief minister of the federation came into conflict with Chief Rabbi Hermann Adler to whom he was supposed to defer. Under pressure from &#145;progressive&#146; elements, Adler was willing to introduce some English and certain modifications into the liturgy of congregations within the establishment United Synagogue. In May 1894 Lerner quit Britain to become rabbi of Altona and Schleswig-Holstein, a position he retained until 1926.<br>
<br>Lerner was a rabbinic scholar of considerable stature, a fact that was little appreciated in England. He published in Hebrew and German. His writings included studies of commentaries on the <span class="roman">Torah</span> and the <span class="roman">Mishnah</span> as well as rabbinical responsa on contemporary issues in Jewish law, for instance the Jewish prohibition of cremation. His most important work was his two-volume <span class="italic">Torat haMishnah</span> (1915, 1928), which dealt with the origin of the oral tradition in Jewish law.<br>
<br>Sympathetic to Zionism, Lerner took an active interest in the Hovevei Tsion &#145;Lovers of Zion&#146; societies in London. In 1905 he set up the Moriah society that sought &#145;to restore the ancient ruins, and the national and religious culture of the Jews&#146;. However, he found himself at odds with both the secular majority and the <i>mizrakhi</i> religious wing of the Zionist movement. In 1930 Moriah merged with the non-Zionist strictly Orthodox political party Agudat Yisrael.<br>
<br>Rabbi Lerner died in Altona, Germany, in early July 1930. His death received only a brief mention in the London <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>.<br>
