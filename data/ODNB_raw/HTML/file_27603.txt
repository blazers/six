<span class="headword">Towneley,  Francis</span>  (1709&#150;1746), <span class="occ">Jacobite army officer</span>, was born on 8 June 1709 at Towneley Hall, Lancashire, the fifth and youngest son of Charles Towneley (1658&#150;1712) and Ursula, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fermor, who married in 1685. Towneley's family were Roman Catholics with a strong attachment to the Jacobite cause. His uncle Richard took part in the rising of 1715. As was common in recusant families Francis, as a younger son, sought his fortune abroad. In August 1721 he was admitted to Douai College, though further details of his education are unknown. Six years later he returned to France and in 1728 he was commissioned into the French army as his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27604/', "John Towneley")</script> had been before him.<br>
<br>Towneley served with distinction at the siege of Phillipsburg in 1734 under the duke of Berwick and was ultimately promoted to a colonelcy by Louis XV. He returned to Britain about 1743 and would doubtless have married and settled but for the second Jacobite rising of 1745. Reviving his French rank he recruited some three hundred men in Manchester and formed them into a regiment of foot and joined Prince Charles's army (in which John Towneley was also serving) on its southward march to Derby and its almost immediate retreat in December. The Jacobites withdrew from Carlisle into Scotland on 21 December leaving Towneley, who had volunteered to act as rearguard, to hold the city with his regiment, now reduced to 117 men, and Captain John Hamilton, governor of the castle, in command of 275 Scots and eight Frenchmen.<br>
<br>On 22 December the duke of Cumberland came up and laid siege to the city. Towneley, well known for his soldierly language, declared that &#145;it would be better to die by the sword than fall into the hands of those damned Hanoverians&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, vol. 18, 339) and prepared to hold out to the last man. Cumberland requisitioned artillery from Whitehaven and on 27 December he began a bombardment of the castle. Three days later, in the face of relentless and overwhelming firepower, Hamilton capitulated, asking only that the garrison be accorded the status of prisoners of war. Cumberland, however, demanded unconditional surrender. At a heated council of war Towneley vehemently opposed such ignominious terms and, though he at last yielded, he did not sign the surrender. He and the officers of his regiment were indicted for high treason at the court house, St Margaret's Hill, Southwark, on 15 July 1746. Towneley disputed the court's jurisdiction, maintaining that since he held the French king's commission, not that of Prince Charles, he should be treated as a prisoner of war, not a traitor. His argument was dismissed and he was found guilty. Towneley was hanged, drawn, and quartered on 30 July 1746 on Kennington Common. His body was buried in the churchyard of St Pancras; his head was displayed at Temple Bar but was recovered and interred in the family crypt at Towneley Hall.<br>
