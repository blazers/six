<span class="headword">Penington,  Isaac</span>  (<em>c.</em>1584&#150;1661), <span class="occ">local politician and regicide</span>, was born in London, the eldest son of Robert Penington (1550&#150;1627), a London merchant with estates in Norfolk and Suffolk, and Judith Shetterden (1559&#150;1622), daughter of Isaac Shetterden of London. His younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/107143/', "Daniel Penington")</script> later married the pious laywoman, Elizabeth Risby [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/107134/', "Elizabeth Penington")</script>]. Their grandfather William Penington (<i>d</i>. 1592), originally from Henham, Essex, had also become a London resident and was buried at St Benet Gracechurch.<h2>
<a name="Marriagebusinessandpuritanism16131638"></a>Marriage, business and puritanism, 1613&#150;1638</h2>Gaining his freedom by patrimony in his father's company, the Fishmongers, Isaac Penington was admitted to the livery in 1613, joined its governing body in 1622, and was elected third warden in 1634&#150;6; he was to become prime warden in 1640&#150;42. On 7 February 1615 at Hackney he married his first wife, Abigail Allen (<i>b</i>. 1588), daughter of John Allen, a London merchant, with whom he had four sons and three daughters; three others died in infancy. His second wife, whom he married by licence dated 5 December 1629, was Mary Wilkinson (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1587), widow of Roger Wilkinson of St Dunstan-in-the-West, haberdasher, and daughter of Matthew Young, a London brewer; there were no children from this marriage.<br>
<br>Penington began his commercial life as a substantial cloth trader in the Levant Company. He also had a moderate investment in the East India Company, which he had sold by the end of 1635, and an interest in the French wine trade. Yet he did not serve on any of the governing bodies of the great trading companies until the transformed circumstances of 1644, when he became governor of the Levant Company. Penington's second marriage extended his commercial interests to include a family partnership in a Whitefriars brewery. In addition, from 1626 he acted as a financial agent for his second cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21842/', "Captain John Penington")</script>, who was later knighted and became an admiral of the fleet and gentleman of the privy chamber. However, pursuit of his cousin's affairs brought problems, Penington's &#145;not having been used to dance attendance on great men's secretaries&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1625&#150;6</i>, 305). Although he succeeded to his father's Norfolk and Suffolk estates in 1627, when he was sufficiently wealthy he chose to purchase a country residence, The Grange, at Chalfont St Peter in Buckinghamshire, some time before 1635. In London he was living in the parish of St Katharine Cree in 1629 but by 1633 had moved to St Stephen, Coleman Street, a parish with a strong puritan reputation. As a member of the general vestry in St Stephen's, he took part in the 1633 election of the future Independent leader, John Goodwin, as vicar. Penington also became a member of the committee for parish business in 1634, and served as collector for the poor in 1636 and an auditor for churchwardens' accounts in 1638, but he never held the office of churchwarden.<br>
<br>Penington's political and religious views and activities from the mid-1620s onwards bore most of the hallmarks of a puritan agenda. Writing to his cousin John in 1626, he expressed the view that there was &#145;little hope of any good unless the King and parliament agree&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1625&#150;6</i>, 305). He favoured giving help to embattled protestants in continental Europe and waging war against Spain. Lodgings and a meeting-place in Whitefriars were also provided for puritan divines visiting London by Penington and his equally zealous second wife. In 1636 his attempt to establish a Sunday afternoon lectureship in his country parish of Chalfont St Peter led to a violent clash with the vicar during which Penington was said to have attacked Laud, claiming that &#145;since this same pragmatical bishop kept his visitation there is a great gap opened for the increase of popery and spreading of Arminianism&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1635&#150;6</i>, 556&#150;7). Penington complained to his cousin in 1637 that it was no longer safe for him to report the latest news from London and that same year his brewery was closed down by the authorities, ostensibly because of smoke pollution, but with a suspicion of vindictiveness.<br>
<br>Penington's election as a London sheriff in 1638, after several other nominees had refused to serve, was his first experience of senior City office and he had never been returned a common councillor. Although one contemporary claimed that Penington lived &#145;like a prince&#146; during his shrievalty  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1638&#150;9</i>, 59), he himself later complained that the office had caused him considerable hardship. In January 1639 he was chosen alderman for Bridge Without, the only City ward denied the power to elect its own alderman or return common councillors. By 1640, therefore, he had had only recent experience of senior office and, although wealthy enough to be listed in May 1640 among the eight most prosperous citizens in his Coleman Street ward, he fell short of qualifying for membership of the City's mercantile &eacute;lite.<h2>
<a name="TheCityandtheCommonsMPandlordmayor"></a>The City and the Commons: MP and lord mayor</h2>Elected a London MP to the Short Parliament in March 1640, Penington combined a leading position among the City's godly citizens with entry into the counsels of the future parliamentarian leadership. He was also to develop close links with the Scottish commissioners sent down to London, with whom he shared a burning ambition to see an end of episcopacy in all three kingdoms. After the parliament's early dissolution Penington was one of seven London aldermen who refused to list inhabitants in their respective wards in preparation for a forced loan, yet seemingly he escaped punishment. Returned again a London MP in the Long Parliament, by the time of Pride's Purge he was to have served on 123 parliamentary committees, especially those concerned with religious reforms. Within the first week of the new parliament Penington joined Matthew Cradock, a fellow City MP, in backing a London petition condemning Laudian innovations and the fortification of the Tower. Shortly afterwards Penington could be seen playing a leading role in the organization and presentation of the first London root and branch petition (11 December 1640) and exactly one year later he was lending his support to the second London petition. His enthusiasm for godly reformation in the early 1640s put him at the forefront of the campaign to purge London pulpits of &#145;scandalous&#146; and &#145;malignant&#146; clergy to make way for godly and politically reliable divines, as in the case of Robert Chestlin, the rector of St Matthew's, Friday Street, and his replacement, Henry Burton, the puritan dissident. Penington's reforming zeal was also apparent in his introduction in February 1641 of a bill to abolish &#145;superstition and idolatry&#146; from churches, including Laudian altars and rails, which finally received Commons sanction in their order of the following September. However, Penington's impatience to see the end of episcopacy and the full implementation of godly reformation sometimes caused problems for the more measured and circumspect parliamentary leadership.<br>
<br>During the early months of the Long Parliament Penington established himself as a vital intermediary between the Commons and City wealth in the negotiation of loans to pay for the English and Scottish armies, and he attempted to use this financial leverage to exert political pressure on parliament. The threat to withhold City loan money was deployed by Penington in January 1641, in an attempt (albeit an unsuccessful one) to reverse the reprieve of the Jesuit John Goodman, and in the following April to hasten Strafford's execution. Again Penington's militancy in deploying this tactic was probably unwelcome to the parliamentary leadership and may have been counter-productive. Furthermore, his ability to raise City money was not unqualified and he could find himself promising more than he could deliver, as in March 1641. Penington also forged a valuable political alliance with John Venn, a fellow City militant and, after a by-election in June 1641, MP. Both men were adept in drumming up popular support in London for radical causes in the early 1640s and were suspected (with more grounds in Venn's case) of orchestrating mass demonstrations outside parliament to intimidate MPs during the debate on the grand remonstrance. Penington also offered to provide the Commons with a guard of London citizens in November 1641 and the five members who fled the attempted coup in January 1642 may have taken refuge in his City home.<h2>
<a name="Lordmayorandafter16421647"></a>Lord mayor and after, 1642&#150;1647</h2>Penington was elected lord mayor in August 1642, despite his lack of seniority, after the removal of the royalist Mayor Gurney. He had already been appointed colonel of the White regiment of the London trained bands and in September 1642 he joined fellow radicals on the strategically important City militia committee. In the following July he was to be appointed lieutenant of the Tower of London in which capacity he was to accompany Laud to his execution in January 1645. As his grip on the City tightened he was able to deliver its resources for the parliamentarian cause, working closely with Pym and supported by a committed minority of citizens and clergy. Penington was responsible for several financial initiatives to support the war effort, such as the suggestion in June 1642 of weekly voluntary contributions in the City. His vigorous support for the war led him to clash in the initial stages with those Londoners working for an early peace and he made one of his rare appearances in the Commons since his election to the mayoralty to denounce the peace proposals as royalist-inspired. The king responded by condemning the &#145;pretended lord mayor&#146; Penington as the &#145;principal author of those calamities&#146; and grouping him with Venn and two other citizens as traitors who would never be pardoned  (Rushworth, 5.111). His militancy undiminished, Penington and his equally committed wife rallied citizens to construct fortifications around London. He later became associated with the militant City remonstrance of Easter 1643, with its bold claims for parliamentary supremacy, and with radical initiatives, centred on the Salters' Hall subcommittee and the committee for the general rising, to raise independent military forces in London to intensify the war.<br>
<br>Penington continued to act as an intermediary between parliament and the City, and to assist in the raising of money and men for the war effort, after his replacement as lord mayor in October 1643 by the much more moderate Sir John Wollaston. The divisions that appeared in godly ranks after the decision to impose presbyterianism on England found Penington largely in the presbyterian camp. Having chosen the presbyterian Thomas Case to be his chaplain during his mayoralty, he took the covenant in November 1643 and was later to serve as an elder. Furthermore, in May 1645 he helped secure the removal of the Independent John Goodwin from St Stephen, Coleman Street, in favour of the presbyterian William Taylor and subsequently joined with other local zealots in assisting Taylor with the vetting of communicants. Yet Penington's preferred religious settlement was probably one which retained the parochial structure (which Goodwin was undermining) yet vested ultimate ecclesiastical authority in parliament and was content to tolerate gathered churches. In 1649 he was to assist in the reinstatement of Goodwin in St Stephen's.<h2>
<a name="Regicideanddecliningyears16471661"></a>Regicide and declining years, 1647&#150;1661</h2>Despite his moderate presbyterian inclinations Penington, like his ally Venn, became a leading political Independent. During the attempted counter-revolution of 1647 Penington was purged from the London militia committee, only to be restored to it after the army's intervention. Although no supporter of the Leveller party, after the defeat of the mutiny at Ware he expressed concern that parliament should not over-react or forget their record as faithful parliamentarians. After the second civil war he and Venn played a key role in ensuring that royalists and political presbyterians were not returned in the common-council elections of 1648. Penington was appointed to the high court of justice for the king's trial and attended eight of its twenty-two sittings. Although present when sentence was passed, he did not sign the death warrant, but he later assisted Mayor Andrews in proclaiming the abolition of kingship in the City [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. Penington served on the council of state in 1649&#150;51 and 1651&#150;2 and was nominated for one of the London seats in the first protectorate parliament but failed to attend the election. Personal economic difficulties increasingly claimed his attention after 1655. He had been involved in lengthy proceedings before the committee for advance of money since 1645 over a claim that he had retained at least &pound;3000 from the estate of his cousin, the recently deceased Sir John Penington. After 1655, without his protection as an MP, his creditors were able to sue him and he was forced to appeal twice to the protector and his council to prevent his imprisonment and the confiscation of his lands. His financial difficulties were so severe by 1657 that he was forced to resign his aldermanry. Adding to his problems in the 1650s, his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21841/', "Isaac Penington junior (1616&#150;1679)")</script> became a Quaker, as did two other children, while another son became a Catholic priest. At the Restoration Penington voluntarily surrendered himself, hoping to take advantage of the royal offer of indemnity in view of the fact that he had not signed Charles's death warrant. His remaining lands were seized and he was imprisoned for life in the Tower, where he died during the night of 16 December 1661. Penington's corpse was delivered over to his relatives on 19 December but there is no record of his burial place. His second wife survived him.<br>
