<span class="headword">MacDonnell,  Alexander</span>, third earl of Antrim  (1615&#150;1699), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17461/', "Randal MacDonnell, Viscount Dunluce and first earl of Antrim (d. 1636)")</script>, and Alice O'Neill (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1664), and heir to his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17462/', "Randal MacDonnell, first marquess of Antrim (1609&#150;1683)")</script>. Reared at Dunluce Castle in co. Antrim and fluent in both Irish and English, he apparently received no formal education though he spent three years (1636&#150;9) touring France, Germany, and Italy. On his father's death in 1636 he inherited the barony and castle of Glenarm which, in return for &#145;a certain sum of money yearly for his maintenance&#146;, he handed over to his elder brother  (<span class="italic">Fifth Report</span>, HMC, 6).<br>
<br>With the outbreak of the Irish rising in 1641 MacDonnell, who initially took no part in the insurrection, hurried first to Edinburgh and later to London in search of further instructions about how best to proceed. The following year he threw in his lot with the Irish confederates and raised a regiment for the Catholic cause (hence he became known as Colonel Alexander). In 1644 he helped to recruit troops for his brother's expeditionary force to Scotland and in 1645, again acting on his brother's behalf, promised to send 1200 men to Flanders in return for arms and munitions. However, as the 1640s progressed he became increasingly embroiled in confederate politics and, after 1644, was regularly returned to the general assembly and sat as the representative for Ulster on its executive body, the supreme council. He was considered a moderate and served as a member of the committee of treaty, whose job it was to broker a lasting peace with the king. Though he initially supported the papal nuncio Rinuccini's censure of the first Ormond peace (1646), he later threw in his lot (unlike his brother) with the peace party and in 1649 became a commissioner of trust mediating between Ormond and the disbanded confederates. After 1651 he served in the army of Ulster under the bishop of Clogher until Sir Theophilus Jones captured him.<br>
<br>MacDonnell spent the early 1650s imprisoned in the Tower of London before returning to Ireland. Despite the fact that his co. Antrim estates had been confiscated and he had been granted&#151;in lieu of them&#151;7000 acres in co. Galway, he appears to have spent the remainder of the 1650s at Glenarm struggling to pay off his brother's debts (for which he stood jointly liable). In 1665 the <span class="roman">Act of Settlement and Explanation</span> finally restored him to his lands (35,345 statute acres) in the barony of Glenarm and the same year he married Elizabeth Annesley (<i>d</i>. 1669), daughter of the staunchly protestant statesman Arthur, first earl of Anglesey (the marriage portion of &pound;3000 was used to help pay off some of his brother's debts). The union proved disastrous. According to one account Elizabeth &#145;was most arrogantly rude with her husband, and he, of a pleasant humour, would onely and usually return in his Irish language, &#147;how can it be otherwise with a man that has maryed the daughter of the devil&#148;&#146;  (Hill, 361). Elizabeth died in 1669 and later, aged sixty-five, MacDonnell married Helena (<i>d</i>. 1710), daughter of Sir John Burke of Derrymaclaughney and a granddaughter of the sixth earl of Clanricarde, with whom he had a daughter, Mary, and a son and heir, Randal (later fourth earl of Antrim).<br>
<br>On the death of his elder brother in 1683 MacDonnell became third earl of Antrim, inheriting an estate that Richard Dobbs described as &#145;impaired, mangled, and engaged in debts, mortgages, grants and otherwise&#146;  (Hill, 377). During the brief reign of James II he enjoyed prominence as a privy councillor and lord lieutenant of co. Antrim and during the &#145;Wars of the Three Kings&#146; he sided with the Catholic monarch. Late in 1688 the king ordered him to garrison his troops in Londonderry, but the sight of Antrim's redshanks (many of them over 6 feet tall) so terrified the inhabitants of the city that thirteen young apprentices shut the gates. In fact this &#145;vast swarm of Highland and Irish Roman Catholics&#146; was commanded by MacDonnell's illegitimate son Daniel (who, after Limerick, served in France) and not the aged MacDonnell who did, however, take his seat in the 1689 parliament  (R. Simpson, <span class="italic">The Annals of Derry</span>, 1847, facs. edn, 1987). In 1689 he was outlawed in England but his confiscated estates were finally restored to him in 1697 under the terms of the second article of Limerick. For much of the 1690s he acted as the London agent for the remaining Catholic Irish landowners. MacDonnell died on 11 June 1699 near the capital and was buried at Holywell, Flintshire, Wales. Though he lived most of his life under the shadow of his brother, he was an interesting and important figure in his own right and serves as an excellent example of a seventeenth-century Irish Catholic who survived the vicissitudes of two major civil wars with his lands intact.<br>
