<span class="headword">Pynson,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1449&#150;1529/30), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was Norman by birth, as attested by a patent in the Rolls Chapel (now lost) describing him as &#145;in partibus Normand. oriund&#146;. Citing this same patent, Joseph Ames claims that Pynson became a naturalized English citizen about 1493  (Ames, 2.iii). The earliest known reference to Pynson is in 1464, when he appears among a list of students enrolled at the University of Paris  (Duff, 55). By 1482 he was working in London, first as a glover  (Plomer, &#145;Richard Pynson&#146;), then, by 1490, as a bookseller, in which year he commissioned Guillaume Le Talleur in Rouen to print two books, both legal texts, for sale in England. In the plea rolls of 1496 Pynson is described as a &#145;pouchemaker&#146; and &#145;bokeprynter&#146; in the parish of St Clement Danes  (Plomer, &#145;Some notices&#146;). Pynson was also a bookbinder; bindings featuring a panel stamp with his device have survived.<br>
<br>It is not known where Pynson learned the art of printing. Over the years scholars have variously speculated that he was apprenticed to Guillaume Le Talleur in Rouen, Jean du Pr&eacute; in Paris, John Lettou and William de Machlinia in London, or William Caxton in Westminster. The fact that printer's waste from Machlinia's shop has been found in Pynson's bindings suggests he may have taken over his predecessor's equipment, stock, and possibly clientele. Pynson's first dated publication, a grammatical text, appeared on 13 November 1492. However, typographical evidence suggests that among his earliest surviving publications are two yearbooks.<br>
<br>Pynson moved from St Clement Danes, and by 10 July 1502 was established in his premises at &#145;the sign of the George&#146; on the north side of Fleet Street, west of the church of St Dunstan-in-the-West. This location, within the Temple Bar, served him well, for legal printing was always to be a mainstay of his trade, and here he remained until his death. Among his early patrons were the lord privy seal, Bishop Richard Fox, who entrusted his edition of the <span class="italic">Sarum processionale</span> to Pynson's press in 1501, and Archbishop John Morton and Henry VII, both of whom commissioned from Pynson lavish missals in 1500 and 1504, respectively.<br>
<br>Pynson's experience in legal printing, as well as his connections at court, made him well qualified to be king's printer, a post which he held from as early as 6 January 1506, when he first styles himself <i>regius impressor</i>. He had already received several government commissions, including <span class="italic">Ordenaunces of Warre</span> in 1492 and, in 1500, <span class="italic">Traduction &amp; Mariage of the Princesse</span>, issued in preparation for Prince Arthur's marriage to Katherine of Aragon. Henry VII had created the post of king's printer in 1504 apparently to coincide with the last parliament of his reign. The crown's first appointee, William Faques, printed the statutes for that parliament as well as the first extant printed proclamation, regarding coinage. The earliest opportunity Pynson had, in his official capacity, to print the original edition of the sessional statutes came with the opening parliament of Henry VIII's reign, in 1510. However, it was not until 1512, when Pynson&#151;always the shrewd businessman&#151;secured the exclusive right to print all statutes and proclamations, that the king's printer became the true precursor of HMSO.<br>
<br>In view of the political agenda for 1512&#150;13, it seems likely that Thomas Wolsey had a hand in consolidating and strengthening the role of king's printer. Wolsey was at this time promoting a war between the holy league and France. Pynson, at Wolsey's instigation, produced a number of publications to justify this &#145;holy war&#146;, including a papal bull declaring Louis XII of France an enemy of the church. Henry VIII and Wolsey continued to use Pynson's office to advance the crown's interests, whether in times of war or peace. Their most sophisticated press campaign centred on religious orthodoxy and Henry's bid for the title &#145;defender of the faith&#146;. The carefully planned offensive against Martin Luther began in 1521 with the <span class="italic">Assertio septem sacramentorum</span>, composed in part by Henry VIII.<br>
<br>Little is known of Pynson's character. He was involved in numerous legal wrangles, either suing or being sued for broken contracts and debts, but this was common in the book trade  (Plomer, &#145;Some notices&#146;). Certainly, he was a pious and respected member of the community. He belonged to the Corpus Christi Guild at Coventry  (A. W. Reed, <span class="italic">Early Tudor Drama</span>, 1926, 8); he was elected churchwarden of St Dunstan-in-the-West; and he was the first printer known to have received commissions from the city of London, in 1517. Through his links with churchmen sympathetic to evangelical humanism, such as John Colet and Christopher Urswick, Pynson published reforming texts, including a Latin sermon by Savonarola. The sermon was one of three books from Pynson's press in 1509 to feature roman type, marking its first appearance in England. But it is in the&#151;sometimes haphazard&#151;development of printing as an instrument of state policy that Pynson's importance lies.<br>
<br>By 17 December 1529, the close of the parliament of 21 Henry VIII, Richard Pynson was either dead or incapacitated. His will, dated 17 November 1529, was probated on 23 February 1530. John Rastell stepped in to print the statutes for that session, and by 15 February 1530 Thomas Berthelet had been appointed king's printer. Pynson was survived by his daughter, Margaret Warde; his son Richard had died in September 1520. Pynson's first wife, whose name is not known, had been dead for nearly thirty years; in his will, Pynson asked to be buried beside her in the churchyard of St Clement Danes. He had buried another wife, Joan, in St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street, in 1528. Margaret's third husband, John Hawkins, finished the last book off Pynson's press on 18 July 1530. Robert Redman, Pynson's chief rival in the publication of legal texts, eventually took over his printing house and materials.<br>
