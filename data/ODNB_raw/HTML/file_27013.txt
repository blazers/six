<span class="headword">Tayler,  John James</span>  (1797&#150;1869), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister and college head</span>, was born on 15 August 1797 at Church Row, Newington Butts, in Surrey, the elder son of John Tayler (1765&#150;1831), a nonconformist minister, and Elizabeth, the daughter of John Kenning of Walthamstow. When John James Tayler was five years old the family moved from London to Nottingham, where his father took the prestigious post of minister of High Pavement Chapel. In addition to his ministerial work John Tayler started a school in his own home, where his son was a pupil until the age of seventeen. It was here that John James acquired his command of the English language as well as a comprehensive knowledge of Latin and German.<br>
<br>In 1814 John James Tayler was sent to train for the Unitarian ministry at Manchester College, York, under the principalship of Charles Wellbeloved (1769&#150;1858). A letter written by Tayler at this time records that he was studying Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, and mathematics, all in the same week. His days at Manchester College were happy ones, but at the close of his second year he left York and spent the following two years at the University of Glasgow reading for a BA degree. After gaining the degree in 1819 he returned straight away to Manchester College as a temporary assistant tutor in classics, while his former tutor John Kenrick (1788&#150;1877) was in Germany studying with Schleiermacher.<br>
<br>The year spent as a tutor changed the course of Tayler's life. He had previously hoped to study medicine and combine the duties of a minister with those of a doctor. However, the financial difficulties of a long medical training, combined with his increasing interest in theology, caused him to abandon the idea. Thus in 1820, at the age of twenty-three, he accepted an invitation to become the minister of Mosley Street Chapel (later Upper Brook Street), Manchester. On 16 January 1825 he married Hannah, the daughter of Timothy Smith of Icknield; none of their children survived him.<br>
<br>Like his contemporaries, the members of the Oxford Movement, Tayler was also influenced by Romanticism. From his published correspondence, which is a little cameo of Victorian intellectual life, it can be seen that as a student of Glasgow he was avidly reading Scott, and on one of his early visits to the Lake District he joined Wordsworth for tea and the two men went for a long walk together later in the week. Further influence of the Romantic movement on Tayler can be seen by the fact that in 1839 Sir Charles Barry, the architect of the new houses of parliament, was commissioned, amid controversy, but with Tayler's approval, to build the new Upper Brook Street Chapel in a splendid Gothic style. This move away from the rectangular and octagonal chapels which were light, airy, and conducive to rationalism, towards Gothic-style churches with stained-glass windows, choir pews, and high altars which were never used, was a reflection of the moving of Unitarian thought from an excessive reliance upon rationalism, as propounded by Joseph Priestley, towards a more spiritual and romantic religion in which devotion to Christ was central. Tayler achieved this revolution within Unitarianism partly through his joint editorship of the influential <span class="italic">Prospective Review</span> and partly through his control of Manchester College, which was the sole institution for the training of Unitarian ministers.<br>
<br>During the year 1834&#150;5, as D. F. Strauss was publishing his <span class="italic">Life of Jesus</span>, Tayler, who had suffered from nervous exhaustion, spent a year in Germany to recover, and used the opportunity to study continental theology. Thereafter he remained a keen student of German religious thought and was always an admirer of the German way of life. He was greatly impressed by the works of F. D. E. Schleiermacher and at G&ouml;ttingen attended, at eight o'clock every morning, the lectures of Professor J. K. L. Gieseler on church history. Gieseler's systematic approach to his subject influenced Tayler's own study of church history. Contact between English and German religious thought in the nineteenth century was wider than is sometimes portrayed, but Tayler was one of the more interesting links in this chain. He spoke German and regularly conducted services in German while he was in London. After visiting Germany for the first time in 1834 he corresponded with several leading German professors. Tayler also formed a close friendship with Baron Christian Bunsen, and studied his works several years before they were made famous by Rowland Williams in <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span> (1860).<br>
<br>In 1840 Manchester College moved back to Manchester from York, with an enlarged staff and with a determination to become a small university. Tayler was appointed professor of ecclesiastical history, with James Martineau (1805&#150;1900) as professor of philosophy and Francis Newman (1805&#150;1897) as professor of classics. Tayler continued his ministry at Upper Brook Street, holding the two posts in tandem until 1853, when the college moved to London and he was appointed principal of the new institution, a post he held until his death in 1869. Tayler fought vigorously for church unity within a wider state church, on the grounds that such a unity would not duplicate resources but would encourage a highly trained ministry, strengthen the parochial system, and enable Christians to unite in social action. He strongly advocated this position in his publication <span class="italic">A Catholic Christian Church, the Want of our Time</span> (1867).<br>
<br>In London, Tayler took his place in the intellectual society of the capital. He was a close friend of Henry Crabb Robinson (1775&#150;1867), and was the most regular attender at Crabb Robinson's famous dinner parties. Charles Lyell (1769&#150;1849), the geologist, corresponded with him and called to consult him concerning his own research. Tayler's literary output in this period numbered some fifty major books and papers, including <span class="italic">A Retrospective of Religious Life of England</span> (1845) and <span class="italic">English Nonconformity: its Principle and Justification</span> (1859), as well as a large number of written sermons and an extensive private correspondence.<br>
<br>Tayler died at his home, The Limes, Rosslyn, Hampstead, on 28 May 1869. A quiet, thoughtful, and good man, his portraits in the senior common room and the library at Manchester College portray him with a kindly face. In his tribute to Tayler, his old friend James Martineau called him &#145;the English Schleiermacher&#146; and added, &#145;No one could look at him and say that the power of Christianity is spent&#146;  (Martineau and Beard).<br>
