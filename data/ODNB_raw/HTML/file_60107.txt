<span class="headword">Broadhurst, Sir  Harry</span>  (1905&#150;1995), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born on 28 October 1905 at 4 Warrant Officers' Quarters, Blackdown Barracks, Frimley, Surrey, the son of Colour Sergeant Henry Broadhurst, South Lancashire regiment, and his wife, Amelia Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Patterson.<br>
<br>Educated at Portsmouth grammar school (1915&#150;22), Harry Broadhurst was initially an articled pupil to a surveyor. He also served in the Territorial Army, with the Hampshire heavy brigade, from May 1925 to October 1926 when he was seconded to the RAF on appointment to a short service commission. He did his flying training with 11 squadron, gaining his wings in August 1927 and continuing to serve with the squadron, which was sent to India in 1928. Equipped with Wapitis and then Harts, it had a peace-keeping role on the north-west frontier.<br>
<br>On 19 October 1929 he married Doris Kathleen French at St Thomas's Cathedral, Bombay, and in the 1931 birthday honours was mentioned in dispatches. Later that year he was posted back to the UK, to join 41 fighter squadron, newly equipped with Bristol Bulldogs. He came top in the annual air firing competitions and at the 1932&#150;3 Hendon air displays performed solo aerobatics.<br>
<br>During 1933 Broadhurst started training as a flying-boat pilot, but was removed from the course and sent to another Bulldog squadron, 19. Ten months later he was posted overseas again&#151;to 4 flying training school, Isma&#145;iliyyah, Egypt, as chief ground instructor from November 1936 (having been awarded a permanent commission) to July 1937. By now a squadron leader, he had been awarded the AFC in the 1937 new year honours. Then for four months he served at headquarters 2 bomber group, and in 1938 completed the staff college course. At the end of that year he was posted to command 111 fighter squadron, which had been the first to be equipped with Hawker Hurricanes.<br>
<br>Broadhurst, who was known as Broady, earned his reputation as a fighter leader early in the Second World War, at squadron, group, and station level. Awarded the DFC in January 1940, he was on the staff of 11 group, served with the British expeditionary force air component in France, then successively commanded Coltishall, Wittering, and Hornchurch during the battle of Britain. From March 1941, when he was mentioned in dispatches, to July when he was awarded the DSO (with bar in December), to September 1942 when he received a bar to his DFC, his outstanding courage, leadership, and skill were recognized.<br>
<br>In October 1942 Broadhurst was posted to air headquarters, western desert, initially as senior air staff officer with the acting rank of air vice-marshal. Then on 1 February 1943, when the Eighth Army was about to enter Tunisia, he succeeded Air Vice-Marshal &#145;Maori&#146; Coningham in command of the desert air force. When the Eighth Army was halted at the Mareth line in March 1943 it was Broadhurst's brilliant handling of his fighter bombers in low-level attacks which broke axis resistance and earned him the epithet &#145;another commander in the Coningham manner: bold, original, creative&#146;.<br>
<br>Broadhurst continued as air officer commanding the desert air force during the allied invasions of Sicily and Italy, then was posted back to the UK to participate in planning for operation Overlord, the landings in Normandy. As air officer commanding 83 group he set up his headquarters there four days after D-day (6 June), side by side with that of his army opposite number, Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey, who commanded the British Second Army.<br>
<br>Broadhurst's squadrons of ground-attack fighters, equipped with the formidable rocket-firing Typhoons, played a crucial role in supporting the Second Army's advance; and when the Luftwaffe introduced Me 262 jet fighters with their speed and height advantages, he countered them by means of standing patrols near their airfields. In April 1944 he was honoured by the Americans with the Legion of Merit, and in August was made CB; then in July 1945 he became &#145;Sir Harry&#146; with the KBE, and in the 1946 new year honours was mentioned in dispatches. His first marriage having been dissolved in 1945, he married on 13 May 1946 Jean Elizabeth Townley (1914&#150;2001).<br>
<br>Broadhurst's wartime reputation as a successful air commander led to increasingly senior appointments during the cold war period: as air officer administration, Fighter Command (1945&#150;6) and air officer commanding, 61 (eastern reserve) group (1946&#150;8). In 1949 he took the Imperial Defence College course and the following year was posted to the British air forces of occupation (BAFO) as senior air staff officer. This appointment continued into 1952 when BAFO was renamed second Tactical Air Force&#151;of which, after a spell as assistant chief of the air staff (operations), he was made commander-in-chief in December 1953.<br>
<br>Broadhurst returned to the UK in January 1956 to be air officer commanding-in-chief, Bomber Command, which was re-equipping with V-bombers and atomic weapons, assuming command shortly before the Avro Vulcan entered service. In one of these delta-winged aircraft he led Tasman flight, a most successful visit to Australia and New Zealand, in September 1956. While returning to London's Heathrow airport for a VIP reception on 1 October, Broadhurst was flying as co-pilot when, in poor visibility, the Vulcan struck the ground about 700 yards short of the runway. Its undercarriage was torn off and its trailing-edge control surfaces damaged. The captain, Squadron Leader D. R. Howard, applied full power: the aircraft climbed steeply but he found it to be uncontrollable so gave the order to eject. He and Broadhurst did so; the Vulcan stalled and crashed, killing the three rear-crew members and an Avro technical representative.<br>
<br>Broadhurst re-energized Bomber Command, bringing it into the jet age and introducing a fighter-type mentality: he served there until May 1959 when he took up his last appointment, as commander, allied air forces, central Europe. An air chief marshal from February 1957, he was placed on the retired list in March 1961, then joined A. V. Roe &amp; Co. Ltd&#151;makers of the Vulcan and the Blue Steel stand-off bomb&#151;as managing director. He was also a director of Hawker Siddeley Aviation (1961&#150;76), and a director of the Hawker Siddeley Group (1968&#150;76), and president of the Society of British Aerospace Companies (1974&#150;5). He finally retired in 1976, his buccaneering spirit finding an outlet in sailing his 7 ton Bermuda cutter from Chichester harbour near his home at Birdham, Sussex.<br>
<br>Broadhurst personified the fighting spirit of the RAF, serving with distinction in the battle of Britain, the Mediterranean campaigns, the liberation of Europe, and in high commands during the cold war. He died at Westhampnett Nursing Home, Chichester, on 29 August 1995 in his ninetieth year. His second wife, Jean Elizabeth, survived him by six years: she died in a Chichester nursing home on 21 October 2001.<br>
