<span class="headword">Brunton,  John</span>  (1741&#150;1822), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born in Norwich on 10 November 1741, the son of John Brunton, a soap maker, said to have come from a Scottish family tracing its descent from James II of Scotland. Young John Brunton went to Norwich grammar school before serving his apprenticeship to a wholesale grocer in the city. He then married Elizabeth Friend (1744&#150;1826), daughter of a Norwich merchant, and with her settled and started a family in London, where he engaged in business as a grocer and tea dealer in Drury Lane.<br>
<br>However, according to <span class="italic">The Secret History of the Green Rooms</span> &#145;the Drama had long floated in his imagination&#146;  (2.176) and he conceived the idea of converting his propensity for &#145;what he had hitherto considered an amusement&#146;  (ibid.) into a livelihood. His chance came in 1774, when, at the suggestion of his friend Joseph Younger, actor and prompter at Covent Garden, he appeared first at Younger's own benefit on 11 April, in the title role of John Hoole's tragedy <span class="italic">Cyrus</span>, then at the benefit of Mr and Mrs Kniveton on 3 May, in the role of Hamlet. A year later&#151;at the age of thirty-three and neither tall nor very handsome, but with an intelligent eye and resonant voice&#151;he was playing leading parts at the Theatre Royal, Norwich.<br>
<br>He opened in late March 1775 with three consecutive performances as Hamlet, and in the following weeks he proceeded to build up a repertory of parts as diverse as Romeo and Richard III, Achmet in John Brown's <span class="italic">Barbarossa</span>, and Belville in Hugh Kelly's <span class="italic">The School for Wives</span>. The public, no doubt predisposed to applaud a fellow citizen, gave him a great reception, esteeming him, according to <span class="italic">The Thespian Dictionary</span> (1805), &#145;the best actor that had ever appeared on that stage&#146;. John Bernard, who had been in the company with Brunton, described him as &#145;our leading tragedian and one of the best Shylocks &hellip; I ever saw&#146;  (Bernard, 121). In accomplishing so much so quickly, in spite of his inexperience, Brunton quite possibly had help from the manager, Richard Griffiths, who had a gift for coaching young actors, as Bernard recalled in acknowledging his own debt to him. &#145;Mr Griffiths&#146;, he wrote, &#145;exerted himself in that peculiar element in which he had ability, the opening to me a knowledge of the mechanism of my performance, as the means of my attaining a good style&#146;  (ibid.). That the actors themselves do not seem to have resented the sudden incursion of Brunton into their midst may have been at least partly a tribute to his genial temperament and generosity of disposition.<br>
<br>After five years on the Norwich circuit (which varied, but typically included Colchester, Ipswich, Bury St Edmunds, Yarmouth, and King's Lynn) Brunton tried his fortune again in London, in a single performance of <span class="italic">Richard III</span> on 1 July 1780. The audience was cordial enough but the press was grudging, conceding his natural attributes but finding him lacking in technique. He spent the rest of the summer at Bristol before joining the Bath company in September, at the beginning of their 1780&#150;81 season. Characteristically he took his family with him and during the next five years, while himself acting both at Bath and in Bristol, chiefly in supporting roles, he also began to introduce his older offspring to the stage. Elizabeth, John, and Harriet, now ten, seven, and five years old, all took their first bow in 1782 but it was on his eldest daughter, Anne, born in London in 1769, that Brunton's hopes were centred. With his instruction and encouragement she made a brilliant d&eacute;but in April 1785 as Euphrasia in Arthur Murphy's <span class="italic">The Grecian Daughter</span>, Brunton playing her father, Evander. In October they were offered a brief engagement together at Covent Garden, where Anne had a promising reception, her father a cool one. They returned to Norwich, where Anne played for a while before spreading her wings in the theatrical firmament.<br>
<br>Brunton resumed his place as leading actor in what had become one of the most important theatres in the provinces. Things had changed in his absence. Griffiths had retired because of ill health in 1780 and the new manager, Giles Linnett Barrett, was also lessee. On 24 May 1788 the <span class="italic">Norwich Mercury</span> announced:<blockquote>Mr Barrett, with the consent of the Proprietors, has disposed of the remaining five years of his lease, as Manager of our Theatre, to Mr Brunton, father of the celebrated actress of that name &hellip; From the well-known abilities of Mr Brunton, the public may naturally expect to be highly gratified in their theatrical amusements, under his direction.</blockquote>Brunton was an excellent manager, shrewd and reliable in business, popular with the public, considerate to his actors, and liberal in support of the Norwich Theatrical Fund for Retired Actors; generous, in fact, to anyone in need, from a rival manager in dire straits to a small school threatened with closure. He was also good company and at home in Norwich society. Under him the theatre had the most distinguished and prosperous decade in its history. However, towards the end of his third term as lessee it became clear that maintenance of the theatre buildings was not a high priority with him, and in January 1799 the proprietors decided, by sixteen votes to eleven, to grant the patent, not to him but to William Wilkins, architect, who had submitted detailed proposals for a complete structural overhaul of the Norwich house. Still immensely popular, Brunton retired gracefully from the scene at the end of May 1800.<br>
<br>Meanwhile two more of Brunton's children had sought the limelight. Elizabeth (1771&#150;1799) had had an affecting d&eacute;but in 1790 at her now famous sister Anne's benefit at Covent Garden. Later she acted at Norwich but she died in 1799, a year after her marriage there to Peter Columbine. John (though intended for the law) had made the theatre his career and in 1792 he had married an actress, Anna Ross (<i>b</i>. 1773); both acted at Norwich under Brunton. Harriet (1778&#150;1859) had not taken to the stage but had married Francis Noverre (1773&#150;1840), son of Augustin Noverre and nephew of the famous Chevalier Jean Georges Noverre. It was now the turn of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6633/', "Louisa Brunton (1782x5&#150;1860)")</script> to follow her sisters to Covent Garden, as she did on 5 October 1803, charming the audience with her beauty.<br>
<br>In 1804 Brunton became manager of the Brighton (Duke Street) Theatre, the fortunes of which he improved, securing for it the active patronage of the prince of Wales (later George IV) and the title of Theatre Royal. When, in 1805 and 1806, Louisa came from Covent Garden to play for her father, the prince of Wales attended her benefits in both seasons. Among other noble patrons was William, first earl of Craven (1770&#150;1825), and on 12 December 1807 at his house in Charles Street, Berkeley Square, he took Louisa from her father's hand in marriage. By April of that year the Duke Street theatre had been demolished and replaced by a new one in New Road, with Brunton as first lessee, this time with his son John, who also played Laertes to Charles Kemble's Hamlet at the opening on 6 June. Two more young Bruntons acted at Brighton, Kitty and Thomas, but the youngest of the family, Richard (1787&times;9&#150;1846), was to take a different path, serving in the army through the Peninsular War, at Waterloo, and in India, and becoming lieutenant-colonel of the 13th light dragoons.<br>
<br>Brunton continued at Brighton until 1811, at some time after which he and his wife moved to Hamstead Marshall, in Berkshire, close to the Craven family seat at Hamstead Park. There he died, after an illness of only three days, on 18 December 1822. In its report the <span class="italic">Norwich Mercury</span> (28 Dec 1822) described him as &#145;alike distinguished by his own talents and those of his family&#146;. As manager he had had &#145;a degree of success no former patentee had obtained&#146;. As actor, it said:<blockquote>[he] was of the school of Garrick. He was natural, easy and graceful; and his manner in certain parts was powerful and affecting. His <i>Iago</i>, <i>Shylock</i> and <i>Old Dornton</i> are still remembered by many in the district, as perhaps the most perfect representations they have ever seen of these difficult characters. In the walks of private life few men were so amiable. His conversation was particularly animated, and informed by sense, vivacity and anecdote.</blockquote>His wife, Elizabeth, lived on until 14 May 1826. She had been married to Brunton for over fifty years and borne fourteen children but had not followed his example in taking to the stage.<br>
