<span class="headword">Taylor,  Stephen James Lake</span>, Baron Taylor  (1910&#150;1988), <span class="occ">physician and politician</span>, was born (before the arrival of the doctor) on 30 December 1910 at Mepos, Marlow Common, a studio in Great Marlow, Buckinghamshire, the son of John Reginald Taylor (1878&#150;1948), civil engineer, and his wife, Beatrice Violet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lake (<i>d</i>. 1969), daughter of William Alfred Lake. As his father regularly worked in India, and his wife generally accompanied him, Taylor was brought up mainly by an aunt and grandparents. There were early medical influences, as there were many doctors in his family.<br>
<br>After preparatory school, where he surprised the staff by declaring that he was a socialist, Taylor went to Stowe School and thence to St Thomas's Hospital, beginning a lifelong relationship with the hospital and medical school. He qualified in 1934 and then worked briefly in general practice and at a junior level in anaesthetics and general medicine. In 1936 he became senior resident medical officer at the largely female Royal Free Hospital. He &#145;applied for the job quite deliberately because I felt I needed to learn about women&#146;  (Taylor, 38), and met his future wife (May Doris) Charity Clifford [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69273/', "Taylor, (May Doris) Charity, Lady Taylor (1914&#150;1998)")</script>], a house officer, a formidable character, and later a renowned prison governor and administrator. Subsequently he held junior psychiatric posts at the Bethlem Royal Hospital and the Maudsley Hospital, and in 1938 he published <span class="italic">The Suburban Neurosis</span> (1938), a study of loneliness and associated psychiatric problems among suburban housewives. In 1939 he spent six months as an assistant editor at <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>. His experience, like that of many young doctors, was wide and peripatetic, if lacking in depth.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War, Taylor joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as a neuropsychiatrist. On 3 October 1939 he married Charity Clifford; they had three children, Jeremy Stephen (<i>b</i>. 1940), Elizabeth Trilby Charity (<i>b</i>. 1943), and Charles Richard Herbert (<i>b</i>. 1950). In 1941 his personal connections facilitated a move to the Ministry of Information, where he was head of the home intelligence division and set up and directed the wartime social survey, which reflected his interest in post-war planning and social medicine. While in the ministry, he found time to organize, edit, and publish a comprehensive plan for a future health service that reflected the views of younger doctors, in contrast to plans being developed by older voices in the local authorities, the British Medical Association, civil servants, political parties, and the Nuffield Provincial Hospitals Trust. (He had already, at the end of 1939, written a contentious article for <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> in which he saw the wartime emergency hospital service as a sound foundation for the future.) In December 1944 he produced a policy statement for the Labour Party and soon, as one of the few doctors then committed to the idea of a national health service, he was helping with its manifesto. He resigned from the ministry and stood for Labour in Barnet in the 1945 general election, was elected, and spent the next five years in parliament, from 1947 to 1950 as parliamentary private secretary to Herbert Morrison. Morrison and Aneurin Bevan disagreed about the role of local authorities in the National Health Service, Taylor taking Bevan's side.<br>
<br>Not by nature a political animal, when he lost his seat in 1950 and was short of money Taylor found employment at the Nuffield Provincial Hospitals Trust, and was appointed a member of the Harlow New Town Development Corporation (1950&#150;64 and 1966&#150;7). He also served as medical director of Harlow Industrial Health Service (1955&#150;64 and 1965&#150;7). In Harlow he fought for health centres, a concept going back to the Dawson report (the interim report of the consultative council on medical and allied services) in 1920, but not generally accepted. He worked to develop group practice centres with dental and nursing support in association with the Nuffield Provincial Hospitals Trust. His friendship with Richard Costain, the builder who was established both in Lambeth and Harlow, also led him into the field of first aid and industrial medicine, as consultant in occupational health to Richard Costain Ltd (1951&#150;64 and 1966&#150;7). No other first-generation new town was so concerned with the medical welfare of its citizens.<br>
<br>Arguably Taylor's greatest contribution was to the development of general practice. Criticism of it was rife in the 1950s, especially in the Collings report (&#145;General practice in England today&#146;, by J. S. Collings), funded by Nuffield and published in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> in 1950. Anger about this among GPs led Nuffield to commission Taylor to write his own assessment. This he did on the basis of visits to practices regarded as of high quality by other GPs. <span class="italic">Good General Practice</span>, published in 1954, was an excellent guide to improvement and reinforced the influence of the young College of General Practitioners. His book was submitted in evidence to the Cohen committee on general practice, whose report (in 1954) stimulated developments in group practice at a critical time. Taylor himself aided the development of one of the earliest teaching general practices in London at his old medical school, St Thomas's.<br>
<br>Taylor was made a life peer, as Baron Taylor, in 1958. When Labour returned to power in 1964, he led for the party on health service issues in the Lords, and was parliamentary under-secretary of state for Commonwealth relations and the colonies. He resigned after eighteen months, returning to his work in Harlow. He remained a Labour peer until 1981 (when he became a cross-bencher) but, disenchanted with party politics, he increasingly turned his attention elsewhere. Having first become involved in Canadian affairs in 1962, when he was asked to help and successfully negotiated an agreement during a strike of doctors in the province of Saskatchewan, in 1967 he accepted an invitation to become president and vice-chancellor of the Memorial University of Newfoundland, where he remained until 1973 and helped to establish a medical school.<br>
<br>Taylor was a polymath with a sense of fun, a clear speaker who was interested in everything, and absolutely frank. A perennial optimist, his socialist ideals were tempered with pragmatism. He was helpful and supportive to those who looked for assistance. His forays into widely differing branches of health care, politics, and planning were often the result of serendipity and his wide network of friends and colleagues. His career was neither coherent nor usual, nor was his autobiography (<span class="italic">A Natural History of Everyday Life</span>, 1988). However, his accomplishments show how productive an unorthodox path can be. He died on 1 February 1988 at Wrexham Maelor Hospital (near his home in Glynceiriog, Denbighshire), following a heart attack. He was survived by his wife, Charity, and their three children.<br>
