<span class="headword">Beecham,  (Helen) Audrey</span>  (1915&#150;1989), <span class="occ">poet and eccentric</span>, was born at Weaverham, Cheshire, on 21 July 1915, the eldest of five children and only daughter of Henry (Harry) Beecham (1888&#150;1947) and his wife, Ethel Anne Baxter (<i>d</i>. 1951). Her great-grandfather, Thomas Beecham, founded the family fortune with his celebrated pills; Sir Thomas Beecham, the conductor, was her uncle. Harry Beecham liked to style himself &#145;landed proprietor, Lympne Castle&#146;, but he soon ran through his share of the family fortune, and Audrey and her brothers were educated at various schools up and down the country. Finally she attended Wycombe Abbey School, from where in 1934 she won a scholarship in politics, philosophy, and economics to Somerville College, Oxford. She took a second-class degree in 1937. Having been brought up in comparative luxury, when she went to Oxford she was already used to riding horseback, driving cars, indulging her passion for dogs, and also to getting her own way. She was inevitably a rebellious and adventurous undergraduate, taking off in the long vacation of 1936 to run guns for the anarchists in the Spanish Civil War. Her experience there confirmed her in anarchism and anti-communism for the rest of her life. When she left Oxford in 1937 she lived briefly in Paris as one of the group surrounding Henry Miller, Ana&iuml;s Nin, and Lawrence Durrell. She quickly lost touch with Miller, but continued to admire Ana&iuml;s Nin for her beauty and sophistication, and corresponded with Durrell for many years.<br>
<br>Audrey Beecham returned to Oxford and divided her time between Oxford's and London's bohemians. In Oxford she was a friend of &#145;Colonel&#146; Kolkhorst and of Maurice Bowra, to whom she was briefly engaged. Though this engagement inevitably came to nothing they remained close friends, and Bowra left her his excellent cellar in his will. She was also one of the circle surrounding Enid Starkie and Dan Davin. Meanwhile, although from 1940 she was working somewhat desultorily as a senior research assistant at the Agricultural Economics Research Institute, she was often in London. There she began to cultivate a serious reputation for her poetry, encouraged by her uncle, Sir Thomas Beecham, and by M. J. T. Tambimuttu, the editor and patron of aspiring poets. Through him she met Antonia White, who became a close friend, Dylan Thomas, and Joe Ackerley. Her own published poetry, <span class="italic">The Coast of Barbary</span> (1957) and <span class="italic">Different Weather</span> (1979), was well received, and though traditional in form was praised by critics as various as John Wain, Edwin Muir, Kathleen Raine, and Al Alvarez for its authenticity and strength.<br>
<br>Beecham became restless in her job in Oxford, and to the astonishment of many friends she applied in 1950 for the post of warden of Nightingale Hall, the women's residence at the University of Nottingham. She was appointed there in December 1950, also taking the post of lecturer in economic history. She had been received into the Church of England and remained a convinced high-Anglican for the rest of her life, although she never lost her fascination with witchcraft and folklore. She treasured her great-grandfather's shepherd's crook, elaborately carved with a lengthy rebus, and she believed herself capable of casting spells and affecting friends and enemies by them. She shocked several audiences by suggesting in lectures on her family history that old Thomas Beecham had murdered his first wife, and was astonished by their horrified reaction. When challenged by friends for supporting her application to Nottingham, Lord David Cecil remarked &#145;There's no martinet like a reformed rake&#146;. But she was never a martinet, and she was much loved by her students and colleagues there until her retirement in 1980. She retained, however, many of her obsessions and eccentricities. Chief among these was her addiction to conspiracy theory. She was convinced that some of her Nottingham colleagues&#151;many of them well-known academics&#151;were &#145;moles&#146;. Some of her suspicions were entirely unfounded, but others were justified, one at least dramatically.<br>
<br>In 1980 Audrey Beecham returned to Oxford, to her house at 26 Park Town. Her last years were darkened by the chronic asthma which eventually killed her: unable to drive or cycle, she hated walking, and this curtailment of her activities depressed her. But she kept up her interest in her neighbours and friends. On one occasion she asked a friend to drive her to the shops, and on their return instructed her to drive slowly round the crescent of Park Town and look cautiously at the last house on the north side. &#145;What do you see?&#146; she asked. The friend said it looked very much as if there were sandbags and a plastic curtain on the first-floor window. When they returned to her house, Audrey said that the inhabitants were Libyan trainee pilots and that she believed they were preparing for an attack on the house. She insisted on ringing the police, who took down details noncommittally. Three days later the local paper reported that the Libyan pilots had been expelled from the country, accused of sabotage at the Oxford airfield training centre. They had departed overnight from their Park Town hideout, an outcome that gave her much satisfaction. In spite of all this, she remained completely loyal to friends who had been at one time or another connected with the Communist Party, for loyalty and friendship were among her priorities, and in her last years, when she could seldom go out alone, she cherished their company and conversation. An earlier strain of pugnacity in her temper (she prided herself on her mastery of martial arts and on her claim to have knocked out Dylan Thomas cold when he made unwelcome advances to her) grew less as she aged, and though she remained easily irritated her humour and curiosity about life and people increased. She died at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford on 31 January 1989.<br>
<br>Audrey Beecham was mischievous, but entirely without malice. Generous and affectionate, she retained a quality of innocence that was entirely disarming. She was devoted to horses and dogs (especially a generation of dachshunds who shared her house) and to children, with whose view of life she was always entirely in sympathy. Her many friends, colleagues, and students not only remembered her for her eccentricities but loved her for her charm and her warmly sympathetic spirit.<br>
