<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Campbell,  Frederick Archibald Vaughan</span>, third Earl Cawdor  (1847&#150;1911), <span class="occ">politician and railway administrator</span>, was born on 13 February 1847 at St Leonard's Hill, Windsor, the eldest child of John Frederick Vaughan Campbell, second Earl Cawdor (1817&#150;1898) and his first wife, Sarah, daughter of the Hon. Henry Compton-Cavendish. He had two brothers and four sisters. The elder of his brothers, Ronald George Elidor, Coldstream Guards, was killed in a skirmish with Zulu near Isandlwana in March 1879. Until he inherited the earldom he was known as Viscount Emlyn. His family was descended from a cadet branch of the ducal house of Argyll which had in the early nineteenth century acquired the extensive west Wales estates of the Vaughan family, earls of Carbery. The family seats were Golden Grove, Carmarthenshire; Stackpole Court, Pembrokeshire; and Cawdor Castle, Nairn.<br>
<br>Emlyn was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. He sat in parliament as Conservative MP for Carmarthenshire from 1874 to 1885. Between 1885 and 1898, when he succeeded his father, as third Earl Cawdor, he made several unsuccessful attempts to return to the Commons (West Carmarthenshire, 1885; South Manchester, 1892; Wiltshire, Cricklade division, 1898). In parliament he was active on Welsh topics, most notably as a member of the Aberdare committee (1880&#150;81), set up by Gladstone to examine the state of intermediate and higher education in Wales. The committee's work was recognized in the establishment of university colleges in Cardiff (1883) and Bangor (1884), and in the ground-breaking <span class="roman">Welsh Intermediate Education Act</span> of 1889. Outside parliament, Emlyn was an ecclesiastical commissioner for England (1880), and a magistrate and deputy lieutenant for Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire as well as for Inverness-shire. He was lord lieutenant of Pembrokeshire in 1896. He commanded the Carmarthenshire militia and became its honorary colonel. He joined the Royal Agricultural Society in 1863, served on its council from 1882, and was its president in 1901; he was a member of the Carlton Club and the Travellers' Club.<br>
<br>In 1868 Emlyn married Edith Georgiana Turnor, of Stoke Rochford, Lincolnshire. They had thirteen children, ten of whom survived their father.<h2>
<a name="Railwaydirector"></a>Railway director</h2>In 1890 Emlyn became a director of the Great Western Railway and a year later deputy chairman. From July 1895 to March 1905 he was chairman, and in this role presided over a significant period of growth and restructuring in the company's activities. The radical change from broad to standard gauge, undertaken by his predecessor, F. G. Saunders, made possible the numerous reforming measures introduced during his tenure of office, measures whose aim was to maximize growth as well as efficiency; most significant was the laying of new lines, including a direct route to south Wales in 1903. The improvements destroyed the legend of the GWR as the &#145;Great Way Round&#146;.<br>
<br>Cawdor's success as chairman of the GWR owed less to any extensive experience of the railway business than to innate management qualities. He was quick to spot a good idea, and imaginative and determined in pursuing its implementation. He was a persuasive advocate and a good manager of people. In 1903 Joseph Chamberlain referred to his reputation as &#145;the best chairman now living&#146;. Such qualities had helped the GWR to become increasingly competitive and profitable by 1905. They had also led Cawdor to be considered for the post of war minister in the Conservative government of A. J. Balfour in 1903. In the event he was not called on, but in March 1905 he was offered and accepted the post of first lord of the Admiralty in succession to Lord Selborne.<br>
<br>The explanation for the appointment of Cawdor, an aristocratic businessman who had not sat in the Commons for twenty years and who had never held government, let alone cabinet, office, lies only partly in the lack of administrative talent in the Balfour ministry. It reflects also an Edwardian interest in bringing &#145;non-political&#146; businessmen and methods to bear on national problems. Thus, confronted after the South African War by the imperative need for rationalizing and cutting the cost of the empire's defences, Balfour looked outside parliamentary circles for reformist talent.<h2>
<a name="AttheAdmiralty"></a>At the Admiralty</h2>Although as a landed aristocrat and a former MP Cawdor was scarcely a technocratic outsider, his low political profile and managerial acumen made him an imaginative choice. So too did his complete lack of a background in naval matters. In the event his tenure as first lord lasted just nine months (March&#150;December 1905), a period marred by poor health and frequent absences. His stewardship of the Admiralty won him contemporary plaudits. His <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary compared him with Charles Middleton, Baron Barham, a hundred years earlier. He too had gone to the Admiralty with no previous experience of government, had had a comparably brief tenure (May 1805 &#150; February 1806), and had nevertheless left a mark on the navy. As had been the case at the GWR, however, Cawdor's achievement was less a matter of launching constructive ideas of his own than of developing and supporting those of others. He arrived at the Admiralty as the naval &#145;revolution&#146; launched by Lord Selborne and Admiral Sir John Fisher in 1902 was reaching its height. 1905 saw the redistribution of the fleet on home waters, the scrapping of 147 obsolete vessels, and the adoption of the dreadnought design of capital ship. Fisher's gospel of the synergy of economy and efficiency found a receptive audience in the former railway chairman. Cawdor backed Fisher's policy and secured his extension in the office of first sea lord to 1910. During five years of intense and frequently bitter debate over Fisher's reforms from 1905 to 1910, Cawdor never wavered in his support, even though at times highly critical of Fisher's excesses and even though his stance won him enemies in his own party.<br>
<br>On 30 November 1905 a &#145;statement of admiralty policy&#146; was issued, immediately known as the &#145;Cawdor memorandum&#146;, which committed the Admiralty to the future construction of four dreadnoughts a year. It was to become the focal point of the party-political debate over the navy in the years 1906&#150;9, with the Liberal government seeking to justify, and the Unionist opposition to prevent, its abandonment. Cawdor played a crucial role in prosecuting the Unionist attack, both in the annual set-piece parliamentary debates over the navy estimates and on public platforms, particularly in 1909&#150;10 when the navy became a prominent election issue. He proved himself an effective debater in public, while in private he worked closely and amicably with Balfour to formulate opposition policy and tactics.<h2>
<a name="Unionistpolitics"></a>Unionist politics</h2>Although Cawdor was primarily associated with naval questions after 1906, he also made an important contribution to Unionist education policy and constitutional reform. On both issues he represented the opposition in inter-party conferences convened to resolve a political impasse caused by the rejection of Liberal legislation by the Unionist-dominated House of Lords&#151;on education in December 1906 and on the Lords' veto in June 1910. Cawdor's role on the former occasion reflected his background on the subject (namely the Aberdare committee), as much as his prominence on the Unionist benches. In 1910, however, his role alongside Balfour, Lord Lansdowne, and Austen Chamberlain as Unionist representative in the constitutional conference, reflected not only an identification with the cause of Lords' reform, but also the fact that he had by that time achieved a leading role in the party. By 1910 he was <i>de facto</i> if not formal deputy to Lansdowne, leader of the Unionists in the upper house, a considerable achievement for a man whose ministerial career had spanned a mere nine months. Even if account is taken of the fact that the Edwardian House of Lords was a far less testing arena than the Commons, Cawdor's rise was impressive. It occasioned little critical or sceptical contemporary comment, a sign of both his widely acknowledged abilities and a disarming personality.<h2>
<a name="Death"></a>Death</h2>Cawdor died at 9 John Street, Mayfair, on 8 February 1911, aged sixty-three, of pneumonia following a short illness. He was buried in Stackpole church, Pembrokeshire. A memorial service at Holy Trinity, Brompton, was attended by the prime minister, Asquith, and many politicians and peers. &#145;Few men of his generation enjoyed so general an esteem&#146;, observed Sir Almeric Fitzroy. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Hugh Frederick Vaughan, Viscount Emlyn.<br>
