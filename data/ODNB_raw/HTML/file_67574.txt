<span class="headword">Gibb,  Robert</span>  (1845&#150;1932), <span class="occ">historical genre and portrait painter</span>, was born in a small cottage in James Street, Lauriston, near Falkirk, on 28 October 1845, the fifth son of David Gibb, journeyman joiner, and his wife, Christian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Morrison. The landscape painter William Gibb (1839&#150;1929) was his brother. He began his schooling in Edinburgh where he demonstrated early skills with the pencil, and, like his brother's, his early training was as a lithographer. Drawing classes at the Board of Manufacturers School were followed by the life school of the Royal Scottish Academy. In 1867, aged twenty-five, he exhibited an Arran landscape at the Royal Scottish Academy, the first of 143 works by him exhibited there during his lifetime. It was not landscapes that established his reputation, but his figure studies in historic settings; some of his earliest attempts focused on events in the early history of Scotland. In 1874 he exhibited <span class="italic">Columba in Sight of Iona</span>, followed two years later by <span class="italic">The Death of Columba</span>.<br>
<br>Gibb's early interest in illustrating Scottish history and portraits of eminent men gave way to a focus on military subjects, particularly depicting Scottish soldiers in battle, into which he channelled his intense patriotism. In 1878 his first major military picture, <span class="italic">Comrades</span>, was shown at the Royal Scottish Academy (copy, Black Watch Museum). Gibb had been studying the life of Napoleon and had made a sketch of the retreat from Moscow. On seeing a group of three soldiers in the foreground, one of whom had fallen in the snow, a colleague suggested that this vignette would make a suitable composition in its own right and <span class="italic">Comrades</span> was the result. A young soldier whispers his last message to a colleague who comforts him amid the snows of the Crimea, both guarded by a stalwart highlander. The work brought him associate membership of the Royal Scottish Academy. The following year Gibb exhibited a finished picture, <span class="italic">The Retreat from Moscow</span> (priv. coll.). It was completed in Paris, where the artist had gone to familiarize himself with French soldiers and Napoleonic uniforms. It took the foreground scene from <span class="italic">Comrades</span>, transposing the Scots with Frenchmen. Behind, a column of struggling troops trudge wearily through the snow. A similar picture to <span class="italic">Comrades</span> was <span class="italic">Schoolmates</span>, his major painting of 1884, depicting two highland officers in the heat of battle, one falling into the arms of the other.<br>
<br>Perhaps Gibb's greatest work appeared in 1881. <span class="italic">The Thin Red Line</span> (exh. Royal Scot. Acad., 1881; National War Museum, Edinburgh Castle) was inspired by Gibb's reading of Alexander Kinglake's book <span class="italic">The Invasion of the Crimea</span>, and the account of the 93rd highlanders at Balaklava on 25 October 1854. The artist had taken a walking holiday in the Peak District of Derbyshire, and while out walking by the River Wye near Haddon Hall glanced up to a slight rise and imagined he saw a line of highlanders &#145;all plaided and plumed in their tartan array&#146;  (Gilbert, 28). He hastened back to his lodgings where he sketched the image. This would form the theme of one of the finest military paintings of the nineteenth century. The picture represents a line of the 93rd Sutherland Highlanders stretching along a slight rise as Russian cavalry approach. When exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy it &#145;created so much sensation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Magazine of Art</span>, 1881, xxii) and earned full membership of the academy for the artist in February 1882. It was shown at the Royal Academy the following year and thereafter became the property of Archibald Ramsden. After the death of Ramsden it was sold at Christies on 1 February 1917 to the whisky blender Sir Thomas Dewar for &pound;882, although representatives of the regiment also bid for it.<br>
<br>Kinglake's history also provided the theme for <span class="italic">Alma: Advance of the 42nd Highlanders</span> (exh. Royal Scot. Acad., 1889; Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum). The author described how Sir Colin Campbell rode up to the regiment and shouted &#145;Forward, 42nd!&#146; Information for the piece came from details provided by Colonel Sir Peter Arthur Halkett, who carried the queen's colour at the battle on 25 September 1854. It depicted Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Duncan Alexander Cameron, who commanded the 42nd, and Campbell on horseback urging on another &#145;thin red line&#146; up the heights above the Alma River towards the distant enemy, although Gibb did include one wounded and two dead Russians for dramatic effect.<br>
<br>The final picture of Gibb's great Crimean trilogy was <span class="italic">&#145;Saving the Colours&#146;: the Guards at Inkerman</span> (exh. Royal Scot. Acad., 1900; Naval and Military Club, London), although his 1885 canvas <span class="italic">Letters from Home</span> (now destroyed) is also set in the Crimea, with two officers in a tent. Painted in a temporary studio constructed on the slopes of the Pentland Hills to the south of Edinburgh, <span class="italic">Saving the Colours</span> was begun in 1894 and took four years to complete. While Gibb was working in the makeshift studio soldiers from the Edinburgh garrison were brought to the site to serve as models. It is probable that the location was also the setting for his Alma piece. The canvas portrayed Lieutenant H. W. Verschoyle holding proudly aloft the tattered flag of his regiment while the duke of Cambridge is visible in the right background welcoming the guards.<br>
<br>Throughout the last decade of the nineteenth century Gibb continued to paint portraits of eminent Scots, particularly clerics, academics, and of explorers like Sir Henry M. Stanley (1885; Livingstone Memorial, Blantyre), but his reputation was established with his battle paintings. In 1895 he became keeper of the National Gallery in Edinburgh, a post he held for twelve years, but he continued to paint actively and returned to the theme of war with <span class="italic">Hougoumont, 1815</span> (exh. Royal Scot. Acad., 1903; National War Museum), which turned out to be his last retrospective military scene. The success of the battle of Waterloo turned upon the closing of the gates of Hougoumont, a small ch&acirc;teau situated on the battlefield. Officers and men of the Coldstream and Scots guards are depicted in the act of closing the gate against the onrushing enemy.<br>
<br>In 1908 Gibb became his majesty's painter and limner for Scotland, the fifth to hold the position since 1823. He turned his attention to contemporary military events, his first such picture being <span class="italic">Dargai, October 20, 1897</span> (exh. Royal Scot. Acad., 1909; priv. coll.), representing the Gordon Highlanders in battle on the north-west frontier of India. As with his earlier military pieces he was eager to be as accurate as possible and was able to obtain photographs of a number of the officers present, five complete sets of uniforms, and photographs of the heights taken by the Royal Engineers  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 13 Feb 1932). He painted two scenes from the First World War, <span class="italic">Communion at the Front</span> (exh. Royal Scot. Acad., 1917) and <span class="italic">Backs to the Wall, 1918</span> (exh. Royal Scot. Acad., 1929; Arbroath Museum).<br>
<br>While his earlier paintings, such as the <span class="italic">Death of Marmion</span> (exh. 1873), were Romantic in style Gibb's fame lies principally with <span class="italic">The Thin Red Line</span>. He was considered by one art historian the only British military painter who could &#145;be compared with the military painters of France &hellip; the sense of reality he conveys is almost equally great&#146;  (Caw, 267). This was aided by the fact that he preferred to paint outdoors, which would provide accurate light. Indeed, he was &#145;among the first of Scottish landscape painters to approach nature as a conscientious student as well as a delineator of scenery&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scottish Art Review</span>, 1885, 211). His pictures avoided &#145;the sentimentality which so often destroys confidence in pictures of the kind&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12 Feb 1932).<br>
<br>Gibb married, on 3 June 1885, Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1851/2), second daughter of John Shennan, builder and dean of guild in Edinburgh. They had no children. Gibb died at his home, 2 Bruntsfield Crescent, Edinburgh, on 11 February 1932 and was buried in Warriston cemetery, his coffin born by six soldiers of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders accompanied by regimental pipers.<br>
