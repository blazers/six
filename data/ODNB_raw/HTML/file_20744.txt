<span class="headword">Ua Lochlainn,  Domnall</span> <span class="st"> [Domhnall O'Lochlainn]</span>  (1048&#150;1121), <span class="occ">king of Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain</span>, was the son of Ardgar Mac Lochlainn, who led a major plundering expedition into Connacht in 1062, died as king of Ailech in 1064 at Telach &Oacute;c (Tullaghoge in Tyrone), and was buried at Armagh in the mausoleum of the kings. Domnall first married B&eacute;binn (<i>d</i>. 1110), daughter of Cenn&eacute;tig Ua Briain (a member of the U&iacute; Briain of Munster, who had briefly been king of Telach &Oacute;c, the inauguration site of Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain, from 1078 but was killed in battle in 1084). His second wife was Benmide, daughter of Conchobar Ua M&aacute;el Shechlainn, king of Mide. From 1083 Domnall Ua Lochlainn was king of Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain (or king of Ailech, after the fortress at Greenan in Donegal), and he inaugurated his kingship in that year by undertaking a <i>crech r&iacute;g</i>, or royal prey, in Conaille (modern co. Louth) and distributing stipends to the men of Fernmag. He aimed throughout his career to secure the dominance of his lineage within Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain, to assert lordship in the north of Ireland over the kingdom of Ulaid on his eastern frontier and over Cen&eacute;l Conaill to the west, and to challenge Muirchertach Ua Briain for the high-kingship of Ireland. In order to make such a challenge to the Munster king, he needed not only to achieve a clear hegemony in the north but also to subdue, or ally with, the kings of Connacht and Mide: that is, he needed to rally the whole of Leth Cuinn, the northern half of Ireland, against Munster. He sometimes came close to attaining his ambition, but his power was, in the end, too fragile.<br>
<br>Domnall Ua Lochlainn early demonstrated the scale of his ambitions by leading an army into Connacht in 1088, securing the submission of Ruaidr&iacute; Ua Conchobair, king of the province, who then hosted with him to Munster to challenge Muirchertach Ua Briain; Limerick and other fortresses were burnt and the Ua Briain residence at Kincora (in Clare) was razed. Two years later he even secured hostages from Ua Briain himself and from Domnaill Ua M&aacute;el Shechlainn, king of Mide, as well as from Ua Conchobair. This was the high point of his reign, the moment at which he seemed to be the new high-king; but he never established himself in that position. In the very next year, 1091, he had to deal with opposition from a neighbouring king: he slew Donnsl&eacute;ibe Ua hEochada, king of Ulaid, in a military encounter at Belach Goirt in Iubair (Gortinure in Londonderry). The site of the engagement shows that the king of the Ulaid was the aggressor.<br>
<br>After this early success there were several distinct phases to Ua Lochlainn's reign. First, from 1094 to 1103 he was engaged in a war of invasion and counter-invasion, in which Ua Briain held, perhaps increasingly, the upper hand. The Munster-led army invaded the north, while Ua Lochlainn never, in this period, repeated his invasion of Munster of 1090; instead, he was obliged to resort to extreme acts of violence to try to retain control over the Ulaid and Cen&eacute;l Conaill, blinding &Aacute;ed Ua Canann&aacute;in, king of Cen&eacute;l Conaill, in 1093 and cutting down the tree under which the kings of Ulster were traditionally inaugurated in 1099. That his challenge to Ua Briain survived owed something to the traditional Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain alliance with Armagh; in 1097 an invasion by Ua Briain was halted at Fid Conaill in Louth and a truce negotiated by the head of the church of Armagh, Domnall mac Amalgada; another invasion in 1099 ended in a further truce arranged by Domnall; in 1100 he also negotiated a settlement between Ua Lochlainn and the captive king of the Ulaid.<br>
<br>A major crisis for Ua Lochlainn came in 1103 after Ua Briain had invaded the north in 1101, on which occasion he had avenged Ua Lochlainn's 1090 destruction of Kincora by pillaging Ailech, after which yet another year's truce was arranged by the head of the church of Armagh in 1102. The situation was complicated by the appearance of Magnus, king of Norway, in the Irish Sea and an alliance between Magnus and Ua Briain, also in 1102. The next year the Ulaid revolted against Ua Lochlainn; Ua Briain brought an army north to give them aid, basing himself at Mag Coba (in west Down). After an inconclusive stand-off at Armagh, in August Ua Briain divided his forces, keeping some in Mag Coba, and leading others on a raid into D&aacute;l nAraidi (local opponents of the Ulaid); this raid was expensive in casualties, and Ua Lochlainn meanwhile attacked and defeated the detachments left in Mag Coba, compelling Ua Briain to withdraw. Magnus landed in Down, where he was killed in a skirmish, also in August. Ua Briain's grand combination of the forces of Munster, Leinster (including Osraige), together, probably, with Magnus of Norway, had ended in defeat.<br>
<br>After 1103 there was a phase in which Ua Lochlainn's control of the north was now reasonably secure. Ua Briain, however, still controlled Mide and was thus the leading king in Ireland. In the period 1111&#150;13, however, there were further difficulties with the Ulaid, leading to Ua Lochlainn dividing the province between different rulers; at the same period he appears to have placed his son Niall in the kingship of Cen&eacute;l Conaill. In 1114 Ua Briain fell ill, and Ua Lochlainn could then pursue his ambitions in the southern half of Ireland, in abeyance since 1088. His control on the north was now much more secure than it had been at the beginning of his reign. Moreover, Ua Lochlainn had also negotiated an alliance with Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, king of Connacht: Ua Lochlainn's daughter, M&oacute;r (<i>d</i>. 1122), is named as Ua Conchobair's wife, while another daughter, Derbfhorgaill (<i>d</i>. 1151), bore Ua Conchobair three sons, Domnall, &Aacute;ed, and Cathal.<br>
<br>Yet, in the final years of his life, after the death of Muirchertach Ua Briain in 1119, Ua Lochlainn's place as chief challenger to the power of Munster was taken by Ua Conchobair. In 1120 Ua Lochlainn mounted an expedition to assist Murchad Ua M&aacute;el Shechlainn, king of Mide &#145;against Connacht&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annals of Loch C&eacute;</span>, s.a. 1120). Domnall Ua Lochlainn died aged seventy-three on 9 February 1121 at Derry, where he was buried. He is styled &#145;high-king of Ireland&#146; in his obituary notice in the annals of Ulster (compiled at Armagh and consequently favourable to Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain). His patronage of Armagh is illustrated by the endowment of a shrine for St Patrick's bell, which bears the inscription &#145;Or[oit] do Domhnall U Lachlaind lasin dernad in clocsa&#146; (&#145;a prayer for Domnall Ua Lochlainn by whom this bell was made&#146;).<br>
<br>Domnall Ua Lochlainn's second wife, Benmide, was the mother of Niall, killed in 1119, aged twenty-eight, by the Cen&eacute;l M&oacute;en (a branch of Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain located around Lifford in Donegal). A son, Muirchertach, was killed &#145;unjustly&#146;, according to the annals of Ulster, in 1114. Domnall's son Conchobar, who directly succeeded him, was slain by the men of Mag n&Iacute;tha in 1136. Another son, Magnus, was slain in 1128 or 1129.<br>
