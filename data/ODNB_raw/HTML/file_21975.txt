<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Perne,  Andrew</span>  (1519?&#150;1589), <span class="occ">dean of Ely and college head</span>, came from a family of minor Norfolk gentry with lands around Pudding Norton and was born in the village of East Bilney, the son of John Perne. He retained strong but troubled connections with what in Elizabethan times he was to call &#145;that great disordered diocese&#146; of Norwich  (Inner Temple Library, MS Petyt 538/47, fol. 494). He entered St John's College, Cambridge, and took his BA in 1539 and his MA in 1540, with the BTh following in 1547 and the DTh in 1552. In 1540 he was elected a fellow of St John's, but shortly afterwards migrated to Queens', where he served successively as bursar, dean, and vice-president, learning those managerial and political skills which he was to apply so effectively in a Cambridge career which included no fewer than five terms as vice-chancellor. He secured a number of parochial livings in Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, became a prebendary of Westminster in 1552, and dean of Ely in 1557. Perne was a fixture in Cambridge for more than fifty years, and seems to have regarded his deanery, which he may have visited only on the occasion of the annual audit and for somewhat meagre hospitality, as a sinecure (which technically it was). Unfortunately the good things which Perne did for his university have figured less prominently in his posthumous reputation than the ambidexterity with which he responded to the drastic religious changes and reversals of successive Tudor regimes and reformations.<br>
<br>As early as 1549, Perne had abandoned belief in transubstantiation. Evidently he was regarded by the protestant Edwardian ascendancy as one of themselves and was made one of six royal chaplains who were to divide their time between preaching at court and in the country. Although he began by opposing him, it seems likely that Perne, along with the future Archbishop Edmund Grindal, grew close to the famous Strasbourg reformer Martin Bucer who occupied the regius chair of divinity, and to whom he would, posthumously, play Judas. At the first convocation of Mary's reign, Perne again spoke against transubstantiation, earning a rebuke from the prolocutor to which the future Bishop John Aylmer responded with a defence of free speech. But Perne soon made his peace with the Marian regime, subscribing to articles which included a very explicit endorsement of the Catholic doctrine of the eucharist. He was the preferred candidate of Bishop Stephen Gardiner for the mastership of Peterhouse, to which he was elected in 1554. As vice-chancellor he served on a royal commission to inquire into heresy in Cambridge, but was not involved in any cases which led to burning at the stake, at least not the burning of any living persons. More notoriously, he was implicated as vice-chancellor in the macabre proceedings in which, in order to lift an interdict from the university church, the bones of Bucer and his colleague, the Hebraist Paul Fagius, were exhumed and burnt in Cambridge market, following an oration in which Perne had denounced the great reformer and his doctrine, a speech which the martyrologist John Foxe described as &#145;a shameful railing&#146;  (Foxe, <span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>). According to Foxe, Perne in private deeply regretted his unconscientious conduct on this occasion. What is more certain is that Perne owned Foxe's <span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span> in the 1576 edition, and that there is a hole burnt in the middle of the page which tells this story. In 1560, with Elizabeth on the throne, the university passed a grace restoring Bucer and Fagius to their degrees and other honours. The presiding vice-chancellor was again Perne.<br>
<br>In 1564 Elizabeth made a celebrated visit to Cambridge. Although Grindal, now bishop of London, was one of a small committee in charge of the arrangements, he was unable to prevent the choice of Perne to preach before the queen in King's College chapel. He told William Cecil that he hoped that Perne would not be well received, &#145;his apostacy being so notorious&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 35831, fol. 184). However, the sermon, on obedience to the higher powers, was a success. But later in the week Perne allowed himself, uncharacteristically, to be wrong-footed. In a theological disputation before the queen on the proposition that scripture carried more authority than tradition, Perne, who argued for tradition, was provoked by an outspoken attack on the Roman church as &#145;a shameless whore&#146; by his opponent, Matthew Hutton, master of Pembroke College and regius professor, not only to assert the subordination of scripture to the church, but to insist that although it was not faultless, the Church of Rome was the most enduring of churches, from which the Church of England derived the essence of its doctrine and liturgy, not a meretricious whore but &#145;apostolica et matrix ecclesia&#146; (&#145;an apostolic church and our mother&#146;; Collinson, McKitterick, and Leedham-Green, 9). Perne's library reveals the reading which informed these views: great folios of the fathers, extensively annotated, Thomas Aquinas and other scholastics perhaps not so closely read. Perne had to explain himself to Archbishop Matthew Parker, and not even the queen was best pleased. Perne was removed from the list of court preachers, and, apparently, from the number of those thought fit for a bishopric, which is no doubt why, although Archbishop John Whitgift recommended him for a mitre in 1584, he remained master of Peterhouse for the rest of his days.<br>
<br>In a constructive exchange of views with John Feckenham, formerly abbot of Westminster, Perne suggested that Feckenham could hardly find fault with the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> without condemning his own mass book and other Catholic liturgies, since these were its sources. Was Perne a crypto-Catholic, a church papist? The Jesuit John Gerard alleged as much. Perne was rector of the Cambridgeshire parish of Balsham, where many of the leading men adhered to the mysterious and eclectic sect of the Family of Love. It appears that Perne knew all about their familism but did nothing, may even have felt at one with the familist strategy of keeping to themselves their true beliefs. In a letter to the lord chancellor, Sir Christopher Hatton, he advised a policy of pure equity, not respecting &#145;this or that profession, protestant, papist or puritan&#146;  (Westminster Abbey muniments, MS Book 15, fol. 86<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Perne's ecumenical latitude kept the peace in Peterhouse, where it became a legend that in his time, Peterhouse men who became Catholic martyrs were hurried to the scaffold by Peterhouse judges after interrogation by Peterhouse inquisitors. The great &#145;parliament man&#146; Thomas Norton, too much of a hot protestant to be religiously sympathetic, believed that there was &#145;not a better master for the helping of his house&#146; than Perne  (BL, Add. MS 48023, fol. 47). Not until the First World War would enrolments match the Perne years. The university was harder to manage, especially in the mid-1560s and early 1570s, when direct action by the younger dons against the supposedly &#145;popish&#146; ceremonies retained in the Elizabethan church was followed by the presbyterian, anti-episcopal ideology advanced by Thomas Cartwright and his many supporters. Perne, together with his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Whitgift, initially a hot protestant whom he had protected in Mary's reign and whom he seems to have turned into a conformist, was the principal architect of new university statutes (they would remain in force until 1853) which restored discipline and replaced a kind of academic democracy with an oligarchy of the heads of houses resembling the constitution of Venice, a republic in which Perne himself regularly served as doge.<br>
<br>As such, Perne was a fierce and effective defender of the interests of the university against all comers, especially the town and the county. Perne's membership of the commission of the peace for Cambridgeshire proved to be a short-lived experiment. On one occasion he rather pointedly sent copies of the charter and statutes of the university to its chancellor, Lord Burghley, as a reminder of its privileges. But his relationship with Burghley was usually constructive, if formal, and twenty-four of the thirty letters from Perne which are known to survive were addressed to him. Perne was discretion itself, remembered even by his bitter enemy Gabriel Harvey for his &#145;grave and most eloquent silence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Gabriel Harvey</span>, 2.302). When Perne read in his great folio edition of St Ambrose about uncharitable parsimony, he wrote in the margin &#145;R. Eliz.&#146;, but for his own eyes only. When Archbishop Parker on his deathbed proposed to write to the queen accusing Burghley and his brother-in-law Sir Nicholas Bacon of robbing the church, Perne advised against it. Among his other good deeds, it seems to have been Perne who devised the project which secured the solvency of Oxbridge colleges at a time of price inflation: an act of parliament requiring that in all leases of college property one third of the rent should be paid in kind, the so-called corn rent. Cambridge also had Perne to thank for the scheme later implemented as Hobson's Conduit, which brought water down from Trumpington to cleanse the fetid King's Ditch. He was dedicated to building up the university library, and was a predatory observer of the book market and a cultivator of potential donors. Perne was a reader, not a writer, and he published nothing. But he took care of <span class="roman">Ecclesiastes</span> and the <span class="roman">Song of Songs</span> for the version known as the <span class="roman">Bishops' Bible</span>.<br>
<br>In his last years, Perne was often at Lambeth as Whitgift's guest, and it was there that he died on 26 April 1589, suddenly, but not too soon to avoid the cruel fate of satirical vilification in the anti-episcopal Marprelate tracts, which not only dubbed him Old Andrew Turncoat but hinted at a homosexual relationship with the archbishop. This might not have happened if he had not, somewhat earlier, made enemies of Gabriel Harvey, who in 1593 would blacken his character as &#145;hypocrisy incarnate&#146; in <span class="italic">Pierces Supererogation</span>, and of Harvey's friend Edmund Spenser who put him into the <span class="italic">Shepheardes Calender</span> as the worldly-wise Palinode. Thomas Nashe rallied to Perne's defence, no doubt on the grounds that my enemy's enemy is my friend.<br>
<br>Perne had died a wealthy bachelor, and in his will (in which he took his leave of &#145;this slippery earth&#146;&#151;Collinson, McKitterick, and Leedham-Green, 93) he generously remembered his brothers, brothers-in-law, nephews, and other more remote kin, as well as his college. He was buried in Lambeth parish church, where a monument was erected to his memory by his nephew, Richard Perne. But a more abiding monument is his library, much of it still preserved in Peterhouse. This was one of the largest private libraries of its day, the collection of a man of wide and diverse interests, who was perhaps more interested in medicine, cartography, and civil engineering than in theology, and of a connoisseur who valued the beauty of books and who set them off with a little museum of &#145;curiosities&#146; to be shown to visiting VIPs. His panel portrait, also in Peterhouse, has been restored to reveal the inscription, in Greek, of what he called his &#145;posy&#146;, <span class="roman">Ephesians</span> 4: 15, &#145;Speaking the truth in love&#146;.<br>
