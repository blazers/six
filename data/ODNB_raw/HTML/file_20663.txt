<span class="headword">Okely,  Francis</span>  (1719&#150;1794), <span class="occ">Moravian minister and translator of mystical writings</span>, was born at Bedford on 27 March 1719, the first child of Francis Okely (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1733), wig maker, and Ann (1691&#150;1766), the daughter of John Battison. His mother came from a respectable Northamptonshire family, but his father died in a debtors' prison. His mother subsequently became a milliner and shopkeeper in Bedford. As a young man Okely made a small but significant contribution to the evangelical awakening, but his inner life was troubled, and he soon revealed the lack of consistency characteristic of his middle years.<br>
<br>Okely's evangelicalism first made itself felt in 1736 when, on leaving Charterhouse School, London, he awoke similar sentiments in his mother. At St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1739, he formed a small religious society. Ann Okely became a central figure around which the Moravian community at Bedford developed, and Okely and his student friends were also to be drawn into the Moravian church. In his own case, his brother John was a crucial influence. This, however, was not before Okely was rebaptized in 1740 at Blunham, near Bedford, and became a Baptist minister. Expelled from the Baptists two years later, Okely is said to have told his followers that he had &#145;now found the people of God&#146; in the Moravians  (Welch, 210). Extended visits to Moravian centres in Germany followed; he was received into the church in 1743 and ordained in January 1747. In the same month he proposed to Elizabeth Collins (1725&#150;1801), and they subsequently married on 3 February 1747 at Herrnhaag, Germany.<br>
<br>Okely returned to England during 1747 and laboured as a minister mainly at Bedford and Bristol. While he was minister at Dukinfield (1755&#150;6), near Manchester, the poet John Byrom became an influential acquaintance. In May 1755 Elizabeth Okely was ordained deaconess of the Moravian church at Bethelsdorf, Germany. In 1757 an inner crisis caused Okely to &#145;retreat&#146; to Bedford. &#145;I cannot preach because I have not faith&#146;, he explained to John Wesley a year later, after a brief foray with him to Ireland  (<span class="italic">Letters of &hellip; John Wesley</span>, 4.34). Two interviews with William Law in 1760, however, led to intensive study of his works and those by Jakob Boehme (1575&#150;1623), the Lutheran theosophist. This marked a new beginning, and Okely retained the greatest respect for these two mystics.<br>
<br>Two attempts by Okely to find &#145;useful&#146; employment failed. He was refused Anglican ordination in 1763, which meant that the offer by Lord Dartmouth of the curacy of Olney, Buckinghamshire, was closed, and, later, a post at the countess of Huntingdon's college was also denied him. His conduct in seeking a living in other churches dismayed the tolerant Moravians, but he had run out of options and needed to provide for his family's education. Okely emerged from this crisis in 1767 as an untypical Moravian and he moved to Northampton, where he cared for a small society and assisted in the development of others nearby. Three years later he led ceremonies, endorsed by the presence of Moravian dignitaries and a large crowd, that opened the chapel in the town.<br>
<br>A fervent advocate of the spiritual way and of unity among Christians, Okely's extempore preaching attracted a select following. William Bull and John Ryland (1753&#150;1825) were among the dissenting ministers in the neighbourhood with whom he established a warm relationship. Okely was a bibliophile and master of German; at Northampton, where he spent the rest of his life, he applied the fruits of his &#145;long and dear-bought experience&#146; to writing edifying works and making extracts in manuscript from authors he deemed &#145;truly spiritual&#146;  (Okely, <span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Jacob Behmen</span> [Boehme], 4.vi). His translations from the writings of Boehme and John Englebrecht (1599&#150;1642) of Brunswick are among his most substantial publications. His fondness for mystics extended to Tauler, the fourteenth-century Dominican, whose <span class="italic">Evangelical Conversion</span> he translated, and to St John of the Cross (1542&#150;1591), whose life he described as &#145;amazing light in the Midst of Popish Darkness&#146;  (F. Okely to W. Bull, 26 Nov 1782, Bull MS 3097, 65).<br>
<br>Okely's constant wish to assist others towards finding faith was realized when the young William Carey, later the pioneer of Baptist missions overseas, read his versification from Law's writings in <span class="italic">Seasonally Alarming and &hellip; Exhilarating Truths</span> (1774). His <span class="italic">Dawnings of the Everlasting Gospel-Light</span> (1775), a collection of letters written in the early 1740s, gives a useful insight into what Okely and other young Englishmen then found particularly appealing in Moravian evangelicalism.<br>
<br>In early May 1794 Okely preached at Bedford for the last time. He was seized with a paralytic stroke and died there on 9 May. He was buried on 15 May at the Moravian burial-ground in Bedford. His widow survived him until her death on 29 December 1801. Of their children, their second son, William (1762&#150;1830), a physician at Northampton, later became a Moravian minister. William's grandson, William Sebastian Okely, was the first Cambridge MA who was not a member of the established church  (Venn, <span class="italic">Alum. Cant.</span>).<br>
