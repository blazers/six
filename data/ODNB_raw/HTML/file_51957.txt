<span class="headword">Beale, Dame  Doris Winifred</span>  (1889&#150;1971), <span class="occ">nurse</span>, was born on 9 August 1889 at 42 London Road, Sydenham, London, the daughter of George Beale, master draper, and his wife, Annie Maria, formerly King. Doris was educated at Prendergast School, Lewisham, and on leaving school she worked as a clerk before eventually embarking on nurse training at the Royal London Hospital. She was appointed a probationer at the London Hospital on 11 October 1912, and attended the usual six-week preliminary training course at Tradegar House, Bow. Her training certificate was awarded on 16 December 1916 and she passed with honours. The training record proclaimed that &#145;she gave the impression that she had the latent capacity for ward management and for taking more responsibilities&#146;  (Royal London Hospital, archives LH/N/4/4). Doris was promoted to holiday sister on 26 November 1914, and, in the register of sisters and nurses held at the Royal London archives, she is described as one who &#145;fully justified her promotion as holiday sister&#146;  (ibid.). Clearly the London Hospital wished to retain the services of Doris Beale, and the matron, Eva Luckes, offered her an appointment as sister of a children's ward. However, for some time Doris had harboured ambitions to join the Queen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service. Eva Luckes, recognizing that these ambitions were dearly held, gave Doris her full support.<br>
<br>Thus on 7 February 1917 Doris left the London Hospital to join the Queen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service. As a nursing sister she worked in the following locations: Royal Naval Hospital (RNH) Plymouth (1917), RNH Haslar (1918), RNH Gibraltar (1919), RNH Chatham (1923), RNH Malta (1925), and RNH Chatham (1927). As sister-in-charge Doris worked at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, from 1930 until 1933, when she became the superintending sister at RNH Chatham. On 10 March 1937 she was promoted to the rank of matron, and served first at RNH Haslar and later at RNH Plymouth.<br>
<br>On 14 July 1941 Doris became matron-in-chief, and was based at RNH Haslar until 19 September 1941, when she was moved to RNH Chatham. Here she remained for just over a year. She moved to the medical department of the Admiralty on 10 November 1942, and finally retired from naval service on 13 July 1944. Her main contribution to nursing lay in her commitment to the training of nurses and in her leadership skills. During her years of naval service Doris was awarded the Royal Red Cross, second class, in 1937 and the Royal Red Cross, first class, and bar in 1944; she was made a dame of the British empire on 6 June 1944.<br>
<br>After retiring from naval service Doris became a prominent member of the joint war organization of the British Red Cross and the order of St John. Between August 1944 and September 1946 she worked as deputy matron-in-chief of their trained nurses department. Her untiring efforts on behalf of the British Red Cross were recognized in 1951, when she was awarded the Florence Nightingale medal by the international committee of the Red Cross.<br>
<br>Doris Beale's energy was also valued by the governing body of Prendergast School, Lewisham. She displayed a keen interest in the fortunes of her old school, and acted as governor from 1945 to 1964. She was also a member of the United Nursing Services Club, and her recreations included gardening and travel. Throughout her life Doris demonstrated tireless compassion for the sick and wounded, and invaluable leadership skills for her junior nurses. A slim, elegant, and attractive woman, Doris was greatly respected by her friends and colleagues. She died suddenly and peacefully at her home, 84 London Road, Forest Hill, London, on 14 January 1971. Her body was cremated following a service at St Paul's, Forest Hill, two days later. She was unmarried.<br>
