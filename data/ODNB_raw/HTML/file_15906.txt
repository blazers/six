<span class="headword">Lalor,  James Fintan</span>  (1807&#150;1849), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist</span>, was born on 10 March 1807 at Tenakill, Queen's county, the eldest of eleven children of Patrick Lalor (1781&#150;1856) of Tenakill and his wife, Anne Dillon (<i>d</i>. 1835). Patrick was a gentleman farmer and middleman who took a prominent part in the anti-tithe movement of the 1830s and was MP for his county, 1832&#150;5. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15908/', "Peter Lalor")</script> was a younger son. James Fintan was set apart by physical deformity and ill health. He was educated at home until at the age of seventeen he spent a year (1825&#150;6) in Carlow College. His lack of formal education was compensated for by the fierce energy and independence of his mind. In due course he rejected the mainstream O'Connellite movement in which his father and brothers were prominent. His search for an alternative led him into friendly correspondence with Sir Robert Peel in 1843. But long before this he had identified radical change in the landholding system as the great answer to Irish problems.<br>
<br>In January 1847 Lalor secured a place among the contributors to <span class="italic">The Nation</span>, and wrote a series of letters that were remarkable for their passionate rhetoric. He advocated a scheme for a strike against rent, which, in spite of the strong disapproval of Charles Gavan Duffy, he induced John Mitchel to adopt. On 18 September 1847 he summoned a meeting of tenant farmers at Holycross, co. Tipperary, to found a tenant association on the footing of a &#145;live and thrive&#146; rent, but his want of practical ability and his fierce self-opinionatedness caused the failure of the meeting. His resolutions were carried, but the association was abortive.<br>
<br>The events of 1848 drew Lalor, as so many others, towards political revolution. On 26 May of that year John Mitchel was transported and the <span class="italic">United Irishman</span> suppressed. Thereupon John Martin arranged for the publication of the <span class="italic">Irish Felon</span>, successor to the <span class="italic">United Irishman</span>. The first number was dated 24 June 1848, and Lalor was the chief contributor. After Martin's arrest in July, Lalor practically edited the newspaper. It came to an end on 22 July with its fifth number. Lalor was arrested on 28 July. He was imprisoned under the <span class="roman">Habeas Corpus Suspension Act</span>, but his health having become impaired, he was released in November 1848.<br>
<br>Lalor was one of the leaders in a revolutionary conspiracy, largely involving artisans in the towns of Leinster and Munster, which flourished for much of 1849 before petering out after a failed attempt at rebellion in September. He was at work on plans for a new newspaper when he fell ill and died, unmarried, at his lodgings in Great Britain Street, Dublin, on 27 December 1849. A large procession followed his funeral to Glasnevin cemetery three days later. Half a century on his ideas, seldom fully comprehended, became grist to the mill of another generation of Irish nationalists. For James Connolly he provided the rare and welcome precedent of a nationalist with an appreciation of socio-economic structure. To Patrick Pearse he was, along with Tone, Davis, and Mitchel, one of the evangelists of Irish nationalism.<br>
