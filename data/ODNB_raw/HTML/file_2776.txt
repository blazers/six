<span class="headword">Bohun,  Humphrey (VI)  de</span>, third earl of Hereford and eighth earl of Essex  (<em>c.</em>1249&#150;1298), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of Humphrey (V) de Bohun (<i>d</i>. 1265) and Eleanor, daughter and coheir of William (V) de Briouze (<i>d</i>. 1230) and his wife, Eva, one of the daughters and coheirs of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18127/', "William (II) Marshal")</script>. Humphrey inherited his titles and paternal lands, centred in Essex and Wiltshire, directly from his grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2775/', "Humphrey (IV) de Bohun")</script>, on the latter's death in 1275. Through his mother Humphrey (VI) gained a significant stake in the march of Wales, consequently playing a leading role in the Welsh wars as well as in the politics of Edward I's reign.<br>
<br>Humphrey (VI) de Bohun's father was wounded and captured at the battle of Evesham in 1264 and died in captivity the following year. His son was only sixteen, so the Briouze lands were taken into royal custody. Henry III granted the marcher lordship of Brecon to Gilbert de Clare, earl of Gloucester, along with the heir's marriage. Bohun inherited his mother's lands when he came of age in 1270, and promised Gloucester &pound;1000 for his marriage, but Brecon was controlled by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, who had conquered much of the Welsh marches in 1262&#150;3. Indeed, Bohun had earlier joined his father in the struggle against Llywelyn.<br>
<br>During the 1270s Humphrey de Bohun fought to regain his inheritance, attacking Llywelyn's men in Brecon. By 1275 the venture had largely succeeded, and in 1276 Bohun was among those lords in the king's council who gave judgment against Llywelyn. He served with Edward I in Wales in 1276 and again in 1277, and, when the campaign ended, he received protection from the king to go on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela.<br>
<br>Bohun fought in Wales throughout the 1280s, when his relations with neighbouring lords degenerated into private warfare. In 1284 Edward awarded possession of Iscennen, which bordered on Brecon, and which Bohun felt belonged to him by right of conquest, to John Giffard. Bohun raided on Giffard's lands and men, but a royal court supported Giffard, and Edward confirmed his grant of Iscennen to Giffard in 1289. Irritation between Bohun and the earl of Gloucester had also been building. The latter claimed that Bohun had not fully paid his marriage fine, while Bohun chafed at being ordered to serve under Gloucester in 1282, as well as at Gloucester's appointment as captain of the army in Brecon in 1287. More dangerous was Gloucester's construction of a castle at Morlais, on the border between the lordships of Brecon and Glamorgan. Bohun was in an awkward position. His Welsh holdings were not as substantial as those of other lords were, he had never fully subdued the Welsh in Brecon, and now he was confronted by two assertive neighbours interested in enlarging their territories. In 1289&#150;90 Bohun appealed to the king for aid against Gloucester, thereby breaking with marcher custom, but Gloucester seized the initiative and raided Brecon in February 1290, justifying his attack by citing those same customs. After two more raids and counter-attacks Edward asserted his authority and ordered the antagonists to appear before a royal tribunal. The final sentences, handed down in parliament in January 1292, condemned both to prison and declared Glamorgan and Brecon forfeit, though Bohun gained his freedom with a fine of 1000 marks and recovered Brecon on 15 July.<br>
<br>Bohun was punctilious in upholding the dignity of his position. In 1277 he proffered the military service that he owed as hereditary constable of England, and throughout the subsequent campaigns in Wales he consistently served without pay. His request in 1282 for his wartime profits as constable prompted a search of exchequer records to ascertain the extent of his rights. In the previous year, when summoned to answer a complaint about unjust distresses, he asserted that the king's statutes had no place in his lands and refused to appear, at which the king marvelled greatly. Bohun's claim to the custody of the manors of the bishop of St David's in Brecon resulted in armed conflict during a vacancy in 1280, and was pointedly overruled by the king in parliament in 1293. Four years later Edward sent royal commissioners to hear complaints by the men of Brecon against Bohun and to take them into the king's peace, directly undermining the earl's lordship.<br>
<br>Bohun's sensitivity about his rights, and the rebuffs that he received at Edward's hands, explain why he became such a staunch opponent of the king during the crisis of 1297. Edward's wartime demands had produced widespread resentment. When in parliament in February 1297, he asked the magnates to serve with him in Gascony, Roger (IV) Bigod, earl of Norfolk and marshal of England, refused. Edward went ahead and summoned an army, but when it was to be mustered, both the constable and the marshal refused to perform their duties. In July, at a meeting between the king's representatives and the barons near London, Bohun gave a lengthy speech summarizing the causes of complaint and demanding remedy. This formed the basis of the <span class="roman">Remonstrances</span>, the written articles submitted by the barons. Edward also tried desperately to raise money, but Bohun and Bigod appeared at the exchequer in August with an armed force to prevent the collection of any taxes. The danger passed when the Scots invaded England and Edward made concessions to the opposition in the documents known as the <span class="italic">De tallagio</span> and the <span class="italic">Confirmatio cartarum</span>. Both Bohun and Bigod received pardons, and then marched off to Scotland to defend the realm.<br>
<br>Bohun married Maud, daughter of Enguerrand de Fiennes, in 1275. Their son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2777/', "Humphrey (VII) de Bohun (d. 1322)")</script> inherited the family estates on his father's death. Humphrey (VI) died at Pleshey on 31 December 1298, and was buried at Walden Priory, Essex. The Bohuns had long been patrons of Walden, and Humphrey (VI) de Bohun was remembered there as one who &#145;did much good to our monastery&#146;  (Dugdale, <span class="italic">Monasticon</span>, 4.141). His benefactions included licensing the monks to accept lands given or sold to them by his tenants.<br>
