<span class="headword">Allen,  Charles</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1685&#150;1687), <span class="occ">writer on dentistry</span>, published while living in Stonegate, York, the earliest known book in English devoted exclusively to treatment of the teeth: <span class="italic">The operator for the teeth, shewing how to preserve the teeth and gums from all the accidents they are subject to</span> (1685). Two copies are known, one in the library of York Minster, the other in the College of Dentistry of New York University. A second edition of the book appeared in 1686 in Dublin, where Allen was currently lodging at Essex Street. This version contains some modification to the original text, with <span class="italic">Particular Directions for Children's Teeth and Use of the Polican, Never Published before</span>. A &#145;polican&#146; or &#145;pelican&#146; was a contemporary extraction instrument. The book was bound together with a treatise by an &#145;unknown hand&#146; (continuously paginated with Allen's), entitled <span class="italic">A physical discourse, wherein the reasons of the beating of the pulse, or pulsation of the arteries, together with those of the circulation of the blood, are mechanically explained; which was never done before</span>. Only five copies of this 1686 edition have currently been located.<br>
<br>In 1687 the main text of the Dublin edition of Allen's work was reprinted for sale in London but with a new title page: <span class="italic">Curious observations in that difficult part of chirurgery, relating to the teeth. Shewing how to preserve the teeth and gums from all accidents they are subject to</span>. Fourteen copies of this London edition are known. That any copies at all survived is due partly to the fact that they were collected as examples of seventeenth-century printing in Dublin, London, and York. It was not until B. W. Weinberger acquired a copy of the 1687 edition, in 1923, that the significance of Allen's book for the history of dental treatment in Britain was appreciated and that further copies were sought out. Different editions have subsequently been found, variously listed in a number of bibliographies published between 1824 and 1905.<br>
<br>Little is known about Charles Allen except what can be deduced from his book. He refers to an unidentified &#145;master&#146;, but never calls himself a barber surgeon. In March 1686 Allen presented a copy of his <span class="italic">Operator for the Teeth</span> to the Dublin Philosophical Society but no definite connection can be shown between Allen and either that city or York; his presence in either place may have been purely for the purpose of having his book printed. The book reveals a high degree of literacy, if not very wide reading. The text of approximately forty pages is addressed to the general reader and deals, <i>inter alia</i>, with the anatomy of the teeth, and with gum diseases, oral hygiene, toothache remedies, decay, and extraction. Allen speaks of filling cavities and replacing missing teeth with artificial or transplanted substitutes, but he is sparing in the detail he gives of techniques and materials. Some of his suggestions are decidedly fanciful and seem unlikely to have been the product of practical experience. Allen claimed to have invented a number of instruments which would be described in the next edition. No such work has yet been found.<br>
