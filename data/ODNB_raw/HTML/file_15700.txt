<span class="headword">Knapton,  George</span>  (1698&#150;1778), <span class="occ">painter and art connoisseur</span>, was born in London, the son or nephew of the bookseller and publisher James Knapton (<i>d</i>. 1736). Between 1715 and 1722 he studied under Jonathan Richardson the elder, whose writings on art were published by James Knapton, and in 1720 he was a subscriber to the St Martin's Lane Academy in London. In 1723, with Arthur Pond, he became a founder member of the Roman Club. Two years later they went to Rome, where they engaged in the business of sending back to England plaster casts from the antique. Pond returned to England in 1727 but Knapton stayed seven years in Italy. In a letter to his brother <a href="#cosubject_15699">Charles Knapton [<i>see below</i>]</a> he described the new excavations at Herculaneum (and his account was later published by the Royal Society, in 1740), and he visited Venice before returning home in 1732. While in Italy he would have met many British travellers, among them Sir Francis Dashwood (second baronet) and Lord Middlesex (later second duke of Dorset) who became the principal movers of the Society of Dilettanti in London. At the first meeting of the society in 1736 Knapton was made its painter, thereby becoming the only dilettante not distinguished by rank or wealth.<br>
<br>Italy had &#145;opend the eyes of his understanding&#146; and &#145;finding he coud not make any extraordinary matter&#146; of painting in oil  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 3.62, 109), Knapton, together with Pond and William Hoare, turned to pastel. They had doubtless been inspired in Venice by the pastels of Rosalba Carriera, whose influence is much apparent in Knapton's surviving pastels at Chatsworth, Derbyshire. By 1736 he had drawn the young Horace Walpole (work untraced). In 1741 Francis Cotes became his pupil and by the end of the decade he had received several commissions from Frederick, prince of Wales, for pastels of his children, sometimes emblematically portrayed according to the prince's &#145;directions &amp; commands&#146;  (Millar, 1.189); three examples remain in the Royal Collection at Windsor and Buckingham Palace. Knapton may also have been involved, with his brother Charles, Pond, and Gravelot, in finding and copying older portraits to be engraved by Jacobus Houbraken in Amsterdam and published by Knapton's kinsmen, the brothers John and Paul Knapton, between 1743 and 1752 as illustrations for Thomas Birch's <span class="italic">Lives and Characters of Eighty Illustrious Persons of Great Britain</span>.<br>
<br>Knapton meanwhile had maintained his ambition to practise in oils. In 1741 the Society of Dilettanti decreed that members should each sit to him in fancy dress and by 1749 he had painted twenty-one competent but curiously irreverent half-lengths (Society of Dilettanti, London). In 1743 Vertue placed him &#145;in the first class&#146; of painters  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 3.117) and the following year Walpole found him painting Lady Carteret (work untraced) &#145;with corn like the Goddess of Plenty, and a mild dove in her arms like Mrs Venus&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 18.467). Most of his surviving portraits in oil date between 1741 and 1751. They include <span class="italic">The 3rd Earl of Burlington</span> (1743, Chatsworth, Derbyshire), <span class="italic">John Spencer and his Son</span> (1745, Althorp, Northamptonshire), the attractive <span class="italic">Lucy Ebberton</span> (<i>c</i>.1750, Dulwich Picture Gallery, London; engraved by J. McArdell), and the very large <span class="italic">Family of Frederick, Prince of Wales</span> (1751, Marlborough House, London). In 1750 Vertue commented on Knapton's &#145;great improvement in oyl paintings&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 3.154), mentioning with particular approval a large group (untraced) of the duke of Bedford and his family. Two full-size copies by Knapton after Van Dyck remain at Woburn Abbey, Bedfordshire. Further portraits are known only through engravings, the earliest dated plates being those of the Italian singers John Carestini (1735) and Lisabetta Du Parc (1737), and the last Sir George Vandeput (1750).<br>
<br>By 1750 Knapton was also recognized as &#145;the most skillfull judge or Connoiesseur of Pictures&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 3.154). In 1746 he had made an inventory of the pictures at Althorp for Lord Spencer and in 1750 the prince of Wales asked him, together with George Vertue, to inspect the pictures in the Royal Collection. In May 1765, on the death of Stephen Slaughter, Knapton succeeded as surveyor and keeper of the king's pictures. Connoisseurship had replaced painting; his last dated painting is from 1755 (<span class="italic">Dr Samuel Wathen and his Family</span>, City of Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery) and he resigned as painter to the Dilettanti in 1763.<br>
<br>Knapton died, apparently unmarried, in 1778; Walpole thought he was dying in January, but he lived on until December, when he was buried in Kensington. Throughout his life he had maintained a professional dignity, according to the ideals of his master Richardson, as both gentleman painter and connoisseur. His technical ability as an artist was not outstanding, but his success was always facilitated by social connection. In 1732 Vertue had suggested that his association with the Knapton publishing house brought him both &#145;acquaintance &amp; employment&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 3.62) and in 1736 membership of the Dilettanti considerably enlarged his circle. He was much favoured by Lord Spencer and the dukes of Bedford and Devonshire before finally attracting royal patronage.<br>
<br>George Knapton's brother <a name="cosubject_15699"></a><span class="headword">Charles Knapton</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1742) was a <span class="occ">landscape painter and engraver</span> whose work was closely associated with the Knapton publishing business. He copied portraits (see above) and old master drawings (particularly those of Guercino), assisting Arthur Pond in preparing <span class="italic">Prints in Imitation of Drawings</span>, published in 1735&#150;6. With his wife, Elizabeth, whom he had married before 1728, he marketed a series of caricature heads etched by Pond and engravings of Italian landscapes chosen by Pond. After his death in the autumn of 1742 his wife became the mistress and business associate of Pond (<i>d</i>. 1758), whom she survived.<br>
