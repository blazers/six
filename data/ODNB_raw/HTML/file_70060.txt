<span class="headword">Hay,  Andrew</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1593), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was the son of William Hay, fourth laird of Talla, and his wife, Janet Spottiswood; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12716/', "George Hay")</script>, minister of Eddleston and Rathven, was his brother. Andrew Hay was a university graduate, possibly of Glasgow, and also studied at Paris, where he learned Greek. In 1556 he was a canon of Glasgow Cathedral, holding the prebend of Renfrew&#151;a vicar-pensioner served the parish. Two years later he was himself rector and parson there. In 1559 Hay conformed to the Reformation and then became parson and minister of Hamilton. From no later than 1564 he was also commissary of Hamilton and Dunserf. He was assisted by a reader, William Jackson, who may have been a chaplain in Glasgow Cathedral before 1555. Following the murder of David Riccio, Queen Mary's secretary, on 9 March 1566, Hay was accused of involvement in the crime, and in July he was warded within the burgh of Dunbar and 2 miles around. He was released on the queen's orders on 29 January 1567.<br>
<br>Hay became very active in the administration of the kirk. On the reconstitution of the chapter of Glasgow Cathedral in 1572 he was appointed dean, and early in that year was one of the commissioners who negotiated the convention of Leith, settling the administrative structure of the kirk. He attended almost every general assembly, served on a number of committees, and from 1578 to 1590 acted as one of the assessors to the moderator. He was himself moderator of the assemblies of March 1573 and August 1580. Between 1569 and 1587 Hay was often named to deputations appointed to present petitions from the assembly to, variously, the regent, the privy council, and the king, and from 1569 until 1588 successive assemblies appointed him the commissioner to visit kirks in Clydesdale, Renfrew, and Lennox. On 6 March 1589 the privy council made him a commissioner for the maintenance of the true religion in Clydesdale.<br>
<br>In 1569 Hay became rector of Glasgow University, then in a state of advanced decay; he held the position until 1586. In 1573 he was closely involved in the process whereby the town council of Glasgow not only conveyed former ecclesiastical revenues to the university, thereby stabilizing the latter's finances, but also substantially rewrote the university's constitution. A year later he encouraged Andrew Melville to come to Glasgow as principal of the university, to whose library he himself gave books. In 1580 he tried in vain to oppose Melville's departure from Glasgow for St Mary's College, St Andrews. In the meantime he collaborated with Melville in the production of the second <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span> (1578). Closely involved throughout, he was one of the members of the assembly to whom the preparation of a draft text was entrusted, his responsibility being the section dealing with the kirk's ministry. Like Melville he favoured a presbyterian structure of church government; he was described as one &#145;wha lyked never those bischopries and wha specialie was the ernest suttar for Mr Andro Melvill&#146;  (Kirk, 55). Hay showed his hostility to bishops during the efforts made by successive governments between 1581 and 1585 to install Robert Montgomerie in the see of Glasgow. In 1582 Hay protested to the privy council in the name of the kirk, and so prominent was he in the opposition to the new bishop that in May 1584 he was denounced as a rebel and warded north of the Tay.<br>
<br>In 1586 Hay resigned as rector of Glasgow University. For the rest of his life he was seldom involved in church affairs beyond the bounds of his parish. He was censured in 1592 for shortcomings which included failing to execute discipline at Renfrew and not preaching on Sunday afternoons (which may have been due to old age). No later than 1566 he had married Janet Wallace of Craigie, almost certainly the daughter of the John Wallace who was prominent among the godly lairds of Ayrshire in 1559&#150;60 and who married Margaret Cunningham, daughter of the staunchly protestant fourth earl of Glencairn. Three of their sons became ministers, John at Renfrew, succeeding his father, Theodore at Peebles, and Andrew at Erskine; another son, David, became commissary clerk of Glasgow. Andrew Hay died in 1593.<br>
