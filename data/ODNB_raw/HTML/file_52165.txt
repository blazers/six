<span class="headword">Chiriton,  Walter</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1340&#150;1358), <span class="occ">merchant and financier</span>, was probably a member of a family of small landowners in Warwickshire, bearing a name derived from Cherrington in that county&#151;he held a life interest in the manor of Weston by Cherrington for a while in the 1340s. He attained national prominence, however, as a wool merchant involved in international trade. In 1340 he is recorded as a merchant who had bought substantial quantities of the king's wool (that is, wool which had come into the king's possession as a result of parliamentary grant), and who was exporting it to Flanders. In July 1341 and afterwards he was described as &#145;king's merchant&#146;, though also as &#145;merchant of London&#146;. In January 1342 he was required to appear before the council, and order was given that his lands should be seized, on the ground that he had not paid for wool delivered to him. The king appears to have relented in March. In July 1343 he and William Melchebourne were attorneys for merchants who had been granted the farm of the customs from midsummer of that year until Michaelmas 1346; deeds relating to the affairs of that group were sealed at his house in London in 1344. In August 1344 he was in a consortium which had lent the king &pound;5000. In the early 1340s, therefore, Chiriton had become deeply involved&#151;as a wool exporter, a farmer, and a lender&#151;in the crown's effort to use the wool export trade as a source of war finance.<br>
<br>In May 1346 Chiriton was raised to still greater prominence by his appointment, with Thomas Swanland, as farmer of the customs for three years, with the obligation to provide the king with &pound;50,000 per annum. This turned out, however, to be a disastrous enterprise, largely because of two external events over which the farmers had no control. The first was the siege of Calais which involved very large expenditure by the crown. It was claimed that Chiriton advanced 100,000 marks for that purpose. The second was the black death, whose ravages between the autumn of 1348 and the spring of 1349 led to a temporary interruption of the wool export, and therefore a cessation of the payments of customs which supplied the farmers. Full details of the finances of these years are not available, but it is known that Chiriton paid the king at least &pound;126,000 during his tenure of the farm and had to borrow more than &pound;53,000. Other merchants advanced money to Chiriton to help him over difficult periods, including Tideman Lemberg (<i>d</i>. 1386) of Dortmund, Henry Goldbeter of York, who advanced &pound;20,000, and a group of merchants of Bruges, who lent &pound;5333. 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. at the ruinous rate of 60 per cent interest per annum. There were various other attempts to relieve necessity. Chiriton and Wesenham handled a forced loan of 20,000 sacks of wool in 1347, and in 1347&#150;8 the export of wool by other merchants was halted to provide the farmers with favourable circumstances for recovering money by their export. In May 1348 they attempted to put off the evil day by prolonging the farm until 1351. In 1349, however, Chiriton and his associates were finally bankrupted.<br>
<br>The affairs of Chiriton and Swanland were entrusted to a group led by John Malwayn. They were imprisoned in June 1349 and their landed property seized by the king. Various trials concerned with alleged debts of the farmers, and with the latter's own attempts to recover money, took place in the early 1350s. Occasional mentions of Chiriton in the chancery enrolments continue until 1358, but then cease. Chiriton's misfortune was, however, remembered by London merchants, since it was cited in the parliament of 1382, together with the experiences of William de la Pole (<i>d</i>. 1366), John Wesenham, and John Malwayn, as a reason for refusing a request by the crown for a loan.<br>
