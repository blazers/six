<span class="headword">Bradford,  John</span>  (1750&#150;1805), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and Independent minister</span>, was born at Hereford, the son of John Bradford, a clothier. He was brought up as an Anglican and educated at Hereford grammar school before proceeding to Wadham College, Oxford, whence he matriculated on 25 June 1767 and graduated BA in 1771. After leaving Oxford, Bradford became curate at Frelsham in Berkshire. He later confessed that he began his curacy as an avowed Arian but experienced a conversion to Trinitarianism and became decidedly Calvinistic in his religious convictions. While still an Anglican clergyman he agreed to preach in several chapels belonging to the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion, but this was frowned on by the church authorities and in 1780 he was dismissed from his living at Frelsham.<br>
<br>Bradford then joined the countess's connexion and for several years supplied various chapels in south Wales and the west midlands including Bridge Street, Walsall, and Virgin's End (later Mayers Green), West Bromwich. His most unusual supply was preaching at the old playhouse in Birmingham, which had been purchased by the countess for use as a chapel. There Bradford preached from a pulpit positioned at the front of the stage. His preaching proved very popular and the entire theatre was sometimes crammed with an appreciative audience. However, the desire for a settled ministry led him to leave the connexion and accept in 1786 charge of the independent congregation at the newly opened Paradise Chapel in Bartholomew Street, Birmingham. While there he published (1792) <span class="italic">A Collection of Hymns</span>, some of which were written by himself. This collection of 280 hymns, avowedly antinomian, proved popular at the time but very few of these hymns are in common usage today. His other notable literary work, also published in 1792, was his <span class="italic">Notes to Bunyan's &#145;Pilgrim's Progress&#146;</span>, extracts from which later appeared as footnotes in volume 3 of George Offor's edition of Bunyan's works.<br>
<br>Bradford, who had married about 1779 and had a family of twelve children, remained at Bartholomew Street until 1797, when financial circumstances forced him to accept the more lucrative position of minister at the City Chapel in Grub Street, London. There he &#145;ministered with great acceptation till his death&#146; on 16 July 1805  (Jones, 15). He was buried in Bunhill Fields, London.<br>
