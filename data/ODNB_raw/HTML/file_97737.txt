<span class="headword">Finlay,  Ian Hamilton</span>  (1925&#150;2006), <span class="occ">poet, artist, and gardener</span>, was born in Nassau, Bahamas, on 28 October 1925, the son of James Hamilton Finlay and his wife, Annie Whitelaw, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pettigrew. According to his son James Finlay was a bootlegger who smuggled rum into the United States during prohibition. When he was six Finlay was sent back to boarding school in Scotland. His education there lasted only until he was thirteen, when he was evacuated to Orkney on the outbreak of the Second World War. He briefly attended Glasgow College of Art before being called up for military service in 1943. He served in the Royal Army Service Corps until 1947, spending part of the time in Germany. He was married, in 1945, to Marion Fletcher.<br>
<br>After demobilization Finlay returned to Orkney to earn his living as a shepherd and agricultural labourer. While there he began to write short stories and plays, some of which, in the 1950s, appeared in the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> and were produced on BBC radio. His first book, <span class="italic">The Sea-Bed and Other Stories</span>, was published in 1958 by Castle Wynd, a small press in Edinburgh, and consisted of forty-eight stapled pages. His first collection of poems, <span class="italic">The Dancers Inherit the Party</span>, was published in 1960 but, significantly, was the product of an American small press run by a Scottish exile, Gael Turnbull, from Ventura, California. Turnbull's <span class="italic">Migrant</span> magazine was founded in 1958 and had published poems by Finlay in its last two issues in 1960 before transforming itself into a publisher of new collections of poetry. Finlay's book was one of the earliest on its list and he thus became a recognized figure in the avant garde of American poetry&#151;his influence acknowledged by poets like Robert Creeley and Lorine Niedecker&#151;before he gained recognition in Scotland. What appealed to these American writers was the deliberate simplicity of Finlay's work, with its roots in folk tradition. The combination of popular culture and avant-garde experimentalism produced, in 1961, Finlay's groundbreaking collection of poems in contemporary Glasgow vernacular, <span class="italic">Glasgow Beasts, an a Burd, Haw, an Inseks, an, aw, a Fush</span>, which paved the way for some of the most experimental Scottish writing of the next two decades.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Glasgow Beasts, an a Burd</span> was the first production of the Wild Hawthorn Press, which Finlay founded with Jessie McGuffie in 1964 on the model of Turnbull's Migrant Press. Becoming his own publisher was indicative of the ways in which Finlay sought to control the environment of his art. The Wild Hawthorn Press launched, in the following year, the magazine <span class="italic">Poor. Old. Tired. Horse.</span> (a title taken from the poem &#145;Please&#146; by Robert Creeley), of which twenty-five numbers were produced by 1968. Edwin Morgan summarized it as a magazine in which &#145;well-crafted thing-y poetry was preferred to expressionist or confessional &#147;depth&#148;&#146;, and observed that while it did &#145;publish concrete poetry, semiotic poetry, and sound-poetry&#146; it also included poets who &#145;dealt with the larger socio-political issues: Mayakovsky, J&oacute;zsef, Neruda, G&uuml;nter Grass&#146;. The result, Morgan suggested, was &#145;an eclecticism that two decades later seems to belong so much to the spirit of the sixties as to have gained more unity and harmony than it appeared to possess at the time&#146;  (E. Morgan, &#145;Early Finlay&#146;, in Finlay, ed., <span class="italic">Wood Notes Wild</span>, 20&#150;21). It was Morgan who had directed Finlay to a letter about &#145;concrete poetry&#146; by E. M. de Melo e Castro in the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>, where Finlay discovered that &#145;it was just what in my little na&iuml;ve, home-made, Scottish way, I had been thinking about&#146;  (Finlay, afterword, 98). Finlay published his first concrete poetry in <span class="italic">Rapel</span> in 1963 and contributed to the first international concrete poetry festival in Brighton in 1967. His role as a pioneer was acknowledged when he and Morgan were nominated as the Scottish representatives on the committee of the international concrete poetry movement. By the late 1960s, however, he was already moving towards a broader conceptual art in which language was situated in a specific environment, as in the series of boat names and numbers printed on wood and wrapped in fishing nets he produced in the late 1960s. One of these, <span class="italic">Starlit Waters</span>, inspired a campaign against the Tate Gallery when the latter acquired it in 1976.<br>
<br>In 1964 Finlay married Sue MacDonald-Lockhart and in 1966 they moved into an abandoned croft at Stonypath in Lanarkshire, with their two children, Alec and Ailie. They began to develop the land round the croft as a garden that would provide the setting for Finlay's works. The joint work of Finlay and his wife in creating the garden was to become typical of how Finlay's work was produced, being made in collaboration with typographers, sculptors, architects, potters, glassmakers, and others, who produced the objects required by this &#145;environmental&#146; art. As the garden developed the Wild Hawthorn Press continued to publish postcards, pamphlets, and booklets in which Finlay experimented with language and design in ways that would often prefigure the motifs inscribed on the plaques, the plinths, the sundials, and the sculptures around which the garden was built. &#145;What you compose with is neither here nor there&#146;, Finlay commented, &#145;you compose with words, or you compose with stone, plants and trees, or you compose with events&#146;  (&#145;The death of piety&#146;).<br>
<br>Growing recognition of Finlay's achievement came with exhibitions in Sunderland in 1970, at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in 1972, at the National Maritime Museum in 1974, and at the Serpentine Gallery in London in 1977. One room of the exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery was described as &#145;a small temple opening upon a garden&#146;  (Abrioux, 7, quoting the exhibition catalogue), an image that was being created in reality at Stonypath by the transformation of an old cowshed into a gallery that, in the light of Finlay's increasing concern with classical Greece, would later be declared to be a temple. Stonypath itself would be renamed Little Sparta to signify its resistance to Edinburgh as the Athens of the North. Commissions from the Max Planck Institute Garden in Stuttgart in 1975 and from the Kr&ouml;ller-M&uuml;ller Museum in Holland in 1980, followed by others from the Schweizergarten in Vienna, the Maritime Village in Swansea, and the Villa Celle in Italy, confirmed Finlay's growing international reputation both as a poet&#150;artist and as a garden designer.<br>
<br>Increasing prominence, however, also meant increasing conflict with the cultural establishment. As early as 1962 Finlay had been involved in an acrimonious exchange of letters in <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> with Scotland's leading poet, Hugh MacDiarmid (who had been best man at Finlay's first wedding). Challenged by Edwin Morgan with ignoring the new developments in Scottish literature represented by Wild Hawthorn Press publications, MacDiarmid queried whether &#145;progress to any desirable end will be achieved under the impetus of a group of teddyboy poetasters who have in any case written little enough in justification of their own attitude&#146; (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 18 May 1962; Bold, 811&#150;14). In return Finlay and Jessie McGuffie accused MacDiarmid of being a Stalinist trying to ignore the thaw represented by younger writers. Rumours of an attack by a Wild Hawthorn zeppelin on the International Writers' Conference held as part of the Edinburgh Festival in 1962, and of a protest march, proved to be the prologue to a long-running confrontation between Finlay and arts institutions, often involving the use of art as a &#145;mythological&#146; mode of attack, a confrontation that culminated in 1984 in what Finlay described as &#145;the Little Spartan War&#146;. In 1978 Finlay had withdrawn his Serpentine exhibition from a Scottish Arts Council space, declaring the absence of the artworks to be more meaningful than their presence. As a consequence the Arts Council broke off all communication with Finlay, which in turn resulted in Strathclyde region revoking relief on the local tax that had been granted to Finlay's gallery, since it was no longer in receipt of Arts Council funding. When the cowshed was declared to be a temple in 1980 Finlay argued that it was therefore entitled to the exemption from taxation allowed to religious buildings, a status that Strathclyde region refused to accept. A raid by a sheriff officer appointed by the courts to seize assets as a form of payment was repulsed (in a well-prepared publicity event, with television and newspaper reporters in attendance) in February 1983 by a group of Finlay's supporters whom he had dubbed the Saint-Just vigilantes, after a leading figure in the French Revolution. A month later a second raid resulted in the removal of a number of works, some of which did not actually belong to the Finlays, but only succeeded in raising public awareness of Finlay's art when the events were transformed into a touring exhibition of &#145;Heroic Ephemera from the Little Spartan War&#146;.<br>
<br>The naming of this confrontation as the Little Spartan War was emblematic of Finlay's concern with the iconography of war (a bird table in the garden is in the shape of an aircraft carrier). The iconography of the French Revolution&#151;particularly the guillotine and the decapitated head&#151;also came to play a central role as Finlay explored the revolution's relation to classical models. The attention that Finlay's &#145;classicism&#146; received in France, with several exhibitions taking place in 1987, led to his being commissioned by the French ministry of culture to design a garden commemorating the French Revolution for the bicentenary celebrations in 1989. In 1984, however, an exhibition entitled &#145;The Third Reich Revisited&#146; had merged imagery from Nazi Germany with contemporary Edinburgh and, in particular, with the Arts Council office in Charlotte Square, the object of several assaults by the Saint-Just vigilantes. In Paris a campaign began against Finlay because of his use of what were perceived to be Nazi emblems (such as the double &#145;S&#146; associated with the Nazi SS in one of his inscriptions), a campaign fuelled by the publication of extracts from Finlay's letters to one of his collaborators, Jonathan Hirschfeld, which were represented as being antisemitic. Finlay brought and won a case for libel against a Paris magazine and radio station, but he was awarded derisory damages of one franc, and by the time the case was concluded the commission for the bicentenary garden had already been cancelled by the French government. The stress of this episode fell substantially on Sue Finlay who, because Finlay suffered from a form of agoraphobia and rarely left his garden, undertook most of the organization of exhibitions. After it the couple separated.<br>
<br>By the 1990s Finlay's work was appearing in major exhibitions in North and South America and across Europe, but it was only in 1991 that he received his first commission for a garden in the UK, at Stockwood Park Nurseries, Luton. The garden at Stonypath was, however, increasingly acknowledged as one of the major artistic achievements of the second half of the twentieth century, and Finlay was awarded honorary degrees by the University of Aberdeen (1987), Heriot-Watt University (1993), and the University of Glasgow (2001), and was made an honorary professor at Dundee from 1999. He was appointed CBE in 2002 and was presented with the Scottish horticultural medal by the Royal Caledonian Horticultural Society the same year. In 2003 he was awarded a &pound;30,000 creative Scotland award by the Scottish Arts Council. On his seventieth birthday a trust was established to safeguard the future of the garden, which was declared in December 2004, by a poll of Scottish artists and gallery directors, to be the most important single work of Scottish art. Finlay had suffered a stroke in 1999, a side-effect of which was his release from agoraphobia, so that in the following years he was able to attend some of the events at which he was honoured. He died at Strachan House Care Home, Craigcrook Road, Edinburgh, of renal cancer, on 27 March 2006, and was survived by his two children.<br>
