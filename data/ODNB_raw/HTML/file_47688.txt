<span class="headword">Marks,  Geoffrey</span>  (1864&#150;1938), <span class="occ">actuary and insurance company manager</span>, was born on 15 November 1864 at Beddington, near Mitcham, Surrey, the third of five sons of John George Marks, sherry shipper of Croydon, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Walker. He was educated at Whitgift Grammar School, Croydon, where he was head boy and captain of rugby and cricket. His love of sport continued throughout his life: he became captain and scrum-half of Croydon rugby club, and was an amateur boxer and a golfer with a handicap of one. He kept wicket for Middlesex in 1894&#150;5, which probably accounted for his curiously gnarled hands.<br>
<br>Marks left school in 1882 and joined Scottish Amicable Life. In 1885 he moved to Mutual Life, and he became a fellow of the Institute of Actuaries in 1890. In 1893, aged only twenty-nine, he was appointed by Mutual Life as actuary and manager. In 1896, on the merger of his office with National Life, he was appointed actuary and manager of the new company, the National Mutual Life Assurance Society, a position he held for the next thirty-six years. He was a member of the board of directors between 1925 and 1935, though he retired as general manager in 1932.<br>
<br>Marks stamped his authority on National Mutual Life. He reduced costs, expanded business cautiously, and paid particular attention to fund management so that the company paid higher bonuses than any other life office before the First World War. Between 1918 and 1921 Marks secured the election of a number of economists as directors. These included O. T. Falk, John Maynard Keynes (elected chairman in 1922), and Walter Layton, who were to change radically the face of British life-assurance investments. Following Keynes's emphasis on a positive investment policy, assets were rapidly moved out of traditional fixed interest securities into the volatile but expanding field of industrial equities. Most other assurance offices only belatedly followed suit. As a result National Mutual achieved record profits at a time when life assurance was generally stagnating. Marks supervised this innovative investment strategy, and proved a strong enough personality to exercise some control over the charismatic Keynes.<br>
<br>Marks's talents were much in demand outside the company, so that he became one of the best-known of insurance men. He was chairman of the Life Offices' Association (1914&#150;16), president of the Institute of Actuaries (1918&#150;20), chairman of the British Insurance Association (1926&#150;8), and chairman of the Joint Board on Unemployment Insurance (1921&#150;37). He served on two royal commissions, on decimal coinage (1918&#150;19) and on income tax (1919&#150;20), and held a wide range of other positions, including finance officer to the metropolitan special constabulary (1914&#150;16), member of the Insurance Offices' advisory committee on the mobilization of dollar securities, chairman of Miss Holman's Home and Club for Disabled Officers, council member of the Royal Patriotic Fund Corporation (1918&#150;20), governor of the Prince of Wales General Hospital, Tottenham, and, in his later years, governor of Whitgift School. For his wartime services, particularly as personal assistant to the controller of the navy and army canteen board (1917&#150;19), he was made a CBE in 1920.<br>
<br>Marks was a rather formidable character&#151;stern, impatient, quick-tempered. He was forceful in debate and valued precision in language. He was generous in friendship and to those in whom he had confidence. He married Alys Mary Bridges, who died in 1930; and, lacking children of his own, he took a keen interest in the careers of his junior staff. An omnivorous reader, and something of an aesthete and epicure, he was a connoisseur of wine and his dinner parties were perfect exercises in gastronomy. He had a satirical sense of humour and was a flamboyant, colourful dresser.<br>
<br>Marks died on 25 August 1938 at his home, Nately Lodge, Newnham Road, Nately Scures, near Basingstoke, of exhaustion, a duodenal ulcer, and cerebral thrombosis. He was cremated on 29 August 1938 at Golders Green crematorium, Middlesex.<br>
