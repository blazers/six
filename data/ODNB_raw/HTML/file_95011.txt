<span class="headword">Collier <span class="st"> [Collyer]</span>,  Richard</span>  (1480<span class="mult">x</span>85?&#150;1533), <span class="occ">mercer and benefactor</span>, was born at Horsham, Sussex. The identity of his parents is unknown. He was closely related to the Caryll family of the neighbouring parish of Warnham, but the precise nature of that kinship remains unclear.<br>
<br>Collier is first recorded as a member of the Mercers' Company in 1511, but his precedence suggests that he is to be identified with William Bromwell's apprentice recorded as William Colier, who became free in 1506 and was therefore probably born early in the 1480s; certainly Bromwell, who traded in English saffron as well as operating at the Antwerp marts, is later to be found associated with Richard Collier. Between 1508 and 1510 Collier was the company's tenant of the most valuable portion of the Crown Seld on the south side of Cheapside, and in 1518 he purchased The Sun, a tenement west of St Mary-le-Bow churchyard. Shortly after 1510 he married Helen, the daughter of the mercer William Usher, and received her portion of about &pound;100; on the death of Helen's sister Cecily the couple became entitled to a further &pound;50. Helen herself died before the sum could be claimed, and Collier's reaction was to sue Usher's executors in the mayor's court for his late wife's share. Perhaps by 1520 he married again, to Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1563), daughter of Thomas Dallam, who had served as warden of the Skinners' Company in 1497.<br>
<br>Collier made conventional if unspectacular progress in the Mercers' Company. In 1513, for instance, he was among the eight master bachelors chosen to assist in presenting the newly elected lord mayor at the Tower, and in 1528 he was nominated third warden. The tasks allotted to him suggest a practical turn of mind. In 1525, with William Bromwell, he was chosen to assess the repairs required at one of the company's properties, and in the same year served on a committee appointed to regulate the use of the beam, scales, and weights employed by the mercers for weighing silks in their hall at St Thomas of Acon. Although he could be strict with his apprentices, there is evidence for his trustworthiness and generosity. In 1523, for instance, he stepped in to secure the inheritance of his former apprentice John Ashley.<br>
<br>Of Collier's business little can be established. When in 1521 Wolsey required provisions and men for a royal voyage to Newfoundland, Collier was one of ninety-three mercers who subscribed. Perhaps more significantly, he signed alongside Robert Pakington, who was to play a part in the transmission of his educational legacy. In May 1520 Collier supplied crimson velvet worth &pound;62 for the queen's use at the Field of Cloth of Gold, but his name is not to be found in the customs accounts; possibly his trade was largely an inland one. He may also have diversified into moneylending: shortly before his death he was suing for the recovery of a loan of &pound;100.<br>
<br>Although Collier continued to live in St Mary-le-Bow, where in 1523 he was assessed for the subsidy at &pound;413 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., in 1520 he made a major purchase, paying &pound;100 for The Key, an extensive holding on the south side of Cheapside, almost opposite Mercers' Hall, in the parish of St Pancras, Soper Lane. He improved the property, buying out two quitrents in 1521 and in 1524 acquiring an element owned by Richard Lacon of Bruges. He also acquired the Brook Shed, which lay between The Key and Soper Lane. Robert Pakington's son later claimed that his father had been a major shareholder in these developments, and in 1523 both Robert and his brother John Pakington, solicitor to the Mercers, were living in St Pancras.<br>
<br>By 1532 Collier was a merchant of great substance, owning two houses in Cheapside, as well as property in Hoxton, Kent, Surrey, and Sussex. He had rebuilt a considerable frontage of Cheapside including The Key, and was living there with his wife and two young children, George and Dorothy. A decade later the site contained a great shop &#145;garnished about with warebenches and covered with canvas&#146;, a warehouse, a counting-house over a hall, a &#145;fyshehouse&#146;, a summer parlour, a great parlour and chamber next to the street, both with carved wainscot portals  (Mercers' Company archives, register of leases 1, fols. 245&#150;7). It was here that Collier, having been absent from Mercers' Hall for over two years, made his will on 23 January 1533. After bequeathing his soul to God, the Virgin, and &#145;all the holy company of heaven&#146;, and bestowing &pound;15 on obits for himself at St Pancras and at Horsham for his parents, he left &pound;100 for mending the roads between Horsham, Crawley, and Reigate, &pound;30 to provide herring for the poor of Horsham in Lent, and money to buy coal for the poor of St Pancras and St Mary-le-Bow. With perhaps characteristic realism, he ensured that the herring would be fairly distributed by allowing the churchwardens to take 40<i>d</i>. for their labours from the annual sum of &pound;3. He left his real property, conventionally enough, to his wife and then in trust for his children. But if both George and Dorothy died under age, then the Cheapside houses were to pass to the Mercers' Company for the establishment of a free school in Horsham. The overseers of the will were Collier's cousin John Caryll, the future attorney of the duchy of Lancaster, and Robert Pakington's brother Humphrey, another mercer. Collier probably died in February, at The Key, and the will was proved on 12 March 1533. His place of burial is not recorded.<br>
<br>Contingent as the provisions of Richard Collier's will were, they led eventually to the foundation that perpetuates his name. Before November 1535 his widow married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/96818/', "Robert Pakington")</script>, whose business affairs were closely entwined with those of her late husband. An interest in The Key was vested in Pakington in trust for George and Dorothy, &#145;only to keep the children of the said Richard Collier in a stay that they should not know in their youth what they had in a certain lest they would haply take over-great courage in the same&#146;  (TNA: PRO, C 1/1050/2&#150;5). Pakington was presumably living at The Key on 13 November 1536 when, on leaving home for mass at St Thomas of Acon at 4 a.m., he was shot dead near the end of Soper Lane. A committed evangelical who acted as Cromwell's agent in the Low Countries, he was probably assassinated by religious conservatives.<br>
<br>On 21 August 1539 Katherine Pakington married Michael Dormer, a mercer and alderman whose wealth greatly exceeded that of her two former husbands. They chose to live at The Key, and the death of both Collier children about the time of the marriage must have been as unwelcome to Dormer as it was distressing to his wife. The Mercers began to take an interest in the building, and put Katherine under pressure to honour the reversionary clause in Collier's will. She was also besieged by her stepson Thomas Pakington, whose chancery suit claimed that his father had put up the purchase money. The company laid the whole affair before the lord mayor and the court of aldermen, which seems to have brought the Dormers to terms. It was agreed that they should at once carry out the provisions of the will, but that they might retain their London house as the company's tenants. In August 1540 Dormer paid &pound;8 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. for a house and garden near Horsham church for Collier's projected school; it was to remain its home until 1893. Dormer died in 1546 and Katherine in 1563.<br>
<br>Collier's foundation provided for sixty scholars, to be selected by a local committee headed by the vicar of Horsham. Education was to be free, but the scholars were to pray for the souls of the founder and his wife, &#145;with De Profundis every day at the departing of the said school&#146;&#151;a clause demonstrating that although he associated with evangelicals, Collier himself remained conservative in religion  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/24). Poor Horsham boys and those from surrounding parishes were to be preferred, since &#145;gentlemen and other men be in better ability than poor men be&#146;. But no one from the parish of Horsham was to be refused who was likely to learn. A master and an usher, to be paid respectively &pound;10 and 10 marks (&pound;6 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.) a year, would be chosen by the Horsham committee and presented to the Mercers for appointment. The company was also to have the management of the endowment.<br>
<br>Initially the school prospered, and its constitution exempted it from the attentions of the chantry commissioners in 1546, although the Mercers refused their request to produce Collier's will. But a rebuilding of the school in 1660 was partly intended to provide boarding accommodation for fee-paying boys, since Collier's insistence on a free school, combined with the Mercers' refusal to use surplus income for the benefit of Horsham&#151;in 1802 the company spent &pound;100 on the school out of a rental of &pound;438&#151;made his conception increasingly unrealistic. The result, confirmed by a chancery decree of 1813, was that Collier's foundation effectively became an elementary school. For the rest of the nineteenth century the school's fortunes fluctuated. A new building was erected in 1841, but controversy was always apt to resurface, especially over the founder's intentions. In 1889, however, a compromise was effected, and a scheme under the <span class="roman">Endowed Schools Acts</span> was ratified by order in council on 15 October. Renamed Horsham grammar school, the school came gradually under the control of public authorities, and became a voluntary maintained grammar school in 1944. In 1976 it became a sixth-form college with the title Collyer's, and admitted its first girls; the first female principal was appointed in 2004.<br>
<br>In planning an educational foundation Richard Collier was following the example of other great London merchants who had similarly benefited the towns of their birth. Where his foundation differed most from those of his contemporaries was in the emphasis he placed on ability to learn irrespective of social position, something that bolsters the impression given by his other bequests, and indeed by all his recorded activities, that his was a down-to-earth approach to salvation. He could not have foreseen that his insistence on a free education would lead his foundation into the doldrums for well over a century; but then he had no doubt hoped that the educational component of his will, depending as it did on the failure of his line, would never come to pass.<br>
