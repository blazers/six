<span class="headword">Kear,  Janet</span>  (1933&#150;2004), <span class="occ">ornithologist and conservationist</span>, was born on 13 January 1933 at 26 Mount Park Road, Ealing, Middlesex, the younger daughter of Harold Kear, trade association clerk (later chartered secretary), and his wife, Constance May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Betteridge. She had an older sister, Barbara, and brother, David (who became director of the New Zealand Geological Survey and director-general of the New Zealand government's Department of Scientific and Industrial Research), and, following the death of her mother in 1934, two younger half-siblings, Martin and Mary. She was educated at Walthamstow Hall in Sevenoaks, Kent, and in her teenage years attended Casper Junior College in Wyoming, USA. After returning to Britain to complete her education, she graduated from King's College, London, in 1956 and then moved to Girton College, Cambridge, where she studied the feeding behaviour of finches under the supervision of Robert A. Hinde, gaining her PhD in 1959. Shortly afterwards she took up a post as a research scientist at the Wildfowl Trust, later renamed the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT), the organization founded by Peter Scott. She worked closely with Scott in the project to protect the endangered Hawaiian goose (the nene), which included reintroducing captive-bred birds to the wild. Thereafter she held a number of posts at the WWT, with the organization providing the base for her research and conservation work for the rest of her long and illustrious career.<br>
<br>During the 1960s and early 1970s Kear focused on scientific research, publishing papers on a range of subjects including bird behaviour and development, and the regulation of avian breeding cycles. She pioneered work on the potential for conflict between goose grazing and agriculture at a time when the birds were increasingly moving onto arable land. She also developed a keen interest in assessing the health of captive waterbirds, with a view to improving husbandry techniques, and was the WWT's avicultural co-ordinator from 1974 to 1977. On 2 January 1964 she married Geoffrey Vernon Townsend Matthews (<i>b</i>. 1923), the WWT's director of research and conservation, and son of Geoffrey Tom Matthews, veterinary surgeon. There were no children of the marriage, which was dissolved in 1978.<br>
<br>In 1977 Kear was appointed curator of the WWT centre at Martin Mere in Lancashire, where she combined, to great effect, her knowledge and enthusiasm for wildlife with the conservation opportunities that running Martin Mere provided. Under her leadership it became one of the United Kingdom's leading wetland reserves and a major visitor attraction. Shortly after arriving at Martin Mere she met her second husband, John Victor Negus Turner (<i>b</i>. 1939), an electrical engineer and a keen amateur ornithologist who was undertaking volunteer work at the centre; they married in New Zealand in 1993. Their legendary hospitality was received by people from all walks of life; local dignitaries, businessmen, students, and fellow ornithologists were all welcomed and inspired to contribute in different ways to wildfowl and wetland conservation.<br>
<br>Despite the substantial administrative workload associated with running Martin Mere, and subsequently with her role as the WWT's director of centres from 1991 until her retirement in 1993, Janet Kear succeeded in maintaining her research interests and keen awareness of ornithological issues. She considered that her main contribution outside the WWT was for the British Ornithologists' Union, acting as council member from 1980 to 1988, vice-president from 1989 to 1991, and president from 1991 to 1995. For many years she edited its journal <span class="italic">Ibis</span> (1980&#150;88), then the WWT's journal <span class="italic">Wildfowl</span> (1989&#150;2001), and was on the editorial board of the Zoological Society of London's <span class="italic">International Zoo Yearbook</span>. Highly generous with her time, she acted for a number of other organizations, serving on the Council for the Study of Animal Behaviour, the Avicultural Society, the British Trust for Ornithology, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust, and the Nature Conservancy Council. Her substantial international reputation led to her chairing the Endangered Waterfowl Group of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (1976&#150;87) and acting on the committee of successive international ornithological congresses (1982&#150;98). She was vice-president at the meeting in Durban in 1998. Her work was recognized with a number of awards. She was appointed a fellow of Liverpool University (1978&#150;92), an honorary fellow of Manchester Metropolitan University (1983), and an honorary fellow of the American Ornithologists' Union (1998), and received an honorary doctorate (with the title of professor) of Liverpool John Moores University (1990). She was also awarded the British Ornithologists' Union's medal (1998), and was appointed OBE in 1993 for services to conservation.<br>
<br>A prolific author, Janet Kear wrote over ninety published papers and a number of books including <span class="italic">The Mute Swan</span> (1989), <span class="italic">Man and Wildfowl</span> (1990), and <span class="italic">Ducks of the World</span> (1991). She co-edited (with N. Duplaix-Hall) the proceedings of the first international Flamingo symposium, entitled <span class="italic">Flamingos</span> (1975), and co-authored (with A. J. Berger) <span class="italic">The Hawaiian Goose: an Experiment in Conservation</span> (1980) and (with E. Hosking) <span class="italic">Eric Hosking's Wildfowl</span> (1985). She also wrote a major part of <span class="italic">The Swans</span> (1972), edited by Peter Scott and the Wildfowl Trust. Following her retirement from the WWT, she and her husband moved from Martin Mere to their country cottage at King's Nympton, Devon, where she continued to devote time and energy to her committee work (including serving as president of the Devon Bird Watching and Preservation Society, and as council member for the WWT), as well as to public speaking (notably the Bernard Tucker memorial lecture to the Oxford Ornithological and Ashmolean Natural History societies in 2002) and to writing. She had just completed her seminal work, <span class="italic">Ducks, Geese and Swans</span> (2005), when she was diagnosed with a brain tumour in September 2004. With contributions from seventy-three waterbird specialists from across the world, the book was a fitting and enduring memorial to a lifetime devoted to the study and conservation of wildfowl. A biography of St Werburgh (a seventh-century Mercian princess who had an affinity with geese), which she was writing with her sister Mary, remained unfinished at the time of her death. She died at South Molton Community Hospital, Devon, on 24 November 2004, of glioblastoma, and was survived by her husband, John.<br>
<br>Janet Kear was remarkable for her pioneering studies of birds (particularly wildfowl), for her contributions to waterbird conservation, and for inspiring a generation of researchers and aviculturalists. She particularly appreciated the importance of encouraging the next generation, and was tireless in helping those aspiring to careers in animal husbandry, research, and conservation. Many leading ornithologists and conservationists attributed their choice of career, or its subsequent development, to her enthusiasm for the subject and efforts that she made on their behalf.<br>
