<span class="headword">Waddington,  Mary King</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Mary Alsop King]</span>  (1845/6&#150;1923), <span class="occ">observer of British society</span>, was born in New York, the youngest of the four daughters and one son of Charles King (1789&#150;1867), president of Columbia College, New York, and his second wife, Henrietta Liston Low. She had seven half-brothers and half-sisters. Her grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68612/', "Rufus King")</script>, the second US minister to the court of St James (1796&#150;1806). She was educated in America, and travelled with her family in Europe after the civil war. Following the death of her father, in 1871 she went with her mother and sisters to live in France, where on 10 November 1874 she married, as his second wife, <a name="cosubject_54295"></a><span class="headword">William Henry Waddington</span>  (1826&#150;1894)<span class="occ"></span>. They had a son, Francis. Waddington's grandfather was an English cotton manufacturer and banker who had become a French citizen. Waddington, born on 11 December 1826 at St R&eacute;my sur Avre, Eure-et-Loir, was the son of Thomas Waddington (1792&#150;1869) and Janet Mackintosh Colin Chisholm (<i>d</i>. 1890), and was educated at Rugby School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he rowed for the university in the boat race in 1849. On returning to France, Waddington took up a political career, was elected to the national assembly, and in 1873 became minister of public instruction. In 1876 he was elected a senator, resuming the same portfolio. In December 1877 he became minister of foreign affairs, in which capacity he attended the congress of Berlin in 1878. He served as prime minister in 1879, and, having declined ambassadorial appointment in 1880, in May 1883 he attended the coronation of Alexander III in Moscow as ambassador-extraordinary. On his return to France he was appointed ambassador to the court of St James, which appointment he held for ten years. Waddington was a keen student of numismatics and published widely on the subject; his collection of coins is in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, Paris. Mary Gladstone, visiting Paris in 1879, described Waddington as &#145;very English in appearance and manner, reticent but not the kind of reticence that implies volumes, in fact rather dull&#146;, but she liked his wife, &#145;a lively, sensible American&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mary Gladstone</span>, 176).<br>
<br>Mary King Waddington stands out among the many diplomatic wives who spent time in Britain on account of the vivid letters she wrote to her sisters, selections of which she published as <span class="italic">Letters of a Diplomat's Wife</span> (1903). The value of her account lies in the freshness of her eye: the routines and rituals of upper-class London society were new to her and her correspondents, and she provides a wealth of detail that English writers, familiar with the social round, took for granted. She had found the immense ceremonial and rigid etiquette of the Russian coronation fascinating, &#145;like some old mediaeval picture&#146;, and contrasted it with the simplicity of Queen Victoria's court. The twice-republican Mary Waddington thought Victoria &#145;a wonderful woman and a wonderful Queen&#146;  (Waddington, 372), but continued to be amused at the way the English considered London &#145;the great centre of the world&#146;, and that life there &#145;spoils one for everything else&#146;  (Waddington, 389). The Waddingtons returned to Paris in April 1893, where William died on 13 January 1894. Mary Waddington returned to England in 1900, when she was at Cowes and had a final interview with the queen. On this occasion, she also called on the former Empress Eug&eacute;nie, who was living out her long exile in England: they had never met before, as William Waddington &#145;was in such violent opposition always to the Empire&#146;  (Waddington, 393).<br>
<br>Madame Waddington published her letters from Russia and Britain in 1903, and followed it with <span class="italic">Italian Letters of a Diplomat's Wife</span> (1905), and <span class="italic">Chateau and Country Life in France</span> (1908). In 1914 she published her recollections of <span class="italic">My First Years as a Frenchwoman</span>. <span class="italic">My War Diary</span>, an account of the first months of the First World War in France, was published by Scribners in New York in 1917 and by John Murray in London in 1918. She died at Osmoy, Seine-Maritime, in France on 30 June 1923 and was buried at Neuch&acirc;tel-en-Bray.<br>
