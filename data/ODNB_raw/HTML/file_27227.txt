<span class="headword">Thomas,  John</span>  (1821&#150;1892), <span class="occ">Congregational minister</span>, the son of Owen Thomas (1785&#150;1831), stonecutter, and his wife, Mary, was born in Thomas Street, Holyhead, on 3 February 1821. He had three sisters and four brothers, of whom <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27236/', "Owen Thomas (1812&#150;1891)")</script> was one. The family moved to Bangor in 1827. With the death of his father on 8 October 1831 the family suffered extreme poverty and John was put out to work, first as a shop assistant then as a shoemaker. His early education was meagre. In September 1838 he left the Calvinistic Methodist church of his childhood and joined the Congregational church at Bangor under the ministry of Dr Arthur Jones (1776&#150;1860), who encouraged him to start preaching. From February to June 1838 he kept a school at Prestatyn, and from October 1839 to spring 1840 one at Penmorfa, Caernarvonshire. He spent a few weeks as a student at the school of John Jones (1798&#150;1840) at Marton, Shropshire, and six months in 1841 at the academy conducted by Dr William Davies (1805&#150;1859) at Ffrwd-f&acirc;l, Carmarthenshire. Thomas in later life bewailed his lack of an effective education.<br>
<br>Thomas was ordained minister of the Congregational church at Bwlchnewydd, Carmarthenshire, on 15 June 1842, but moved to Addoldy, Glyn-nedd, Glamorgan, being inducted there on 18 April 1850. On 14 May 1854 he was inducted minister of the Tabernacle Welsh Congregational Church, Liverpool, and remained there until his death. On 23 January 1843 he married Eliza, the widow of Owen Owens, his predecessor at Bwlchnewydd. She died on 1 August 1888, aged seventy-six. She had five children from her first marriage and four from her second.<br>
<br>Thomas was a man of immense energy. He first attracted public attention as a temperance advocate when no more than eighteen years of age. He soon attained the front rank as a preacher, delivering a vast number of sermons over the years in every part of Wales. As a militant dissenter, he organized the campaign to celebrate the bicentenary of the Ejection of 1662. His plan was to erect a new Congregational college that would absorb the three colleges that served the denomination in Wales. The new building, on the site of the existing Brecon College, was opened in September 1869 as Brecon Memorial College, but the other two colleges refused his &#145;one college&#146; plan. This brought him into conflict with the formidable principal of Bala College, Michael D. Jones (1822&#150;1898), the pioneer of modern Welsh nationalism. It developed into an intensely acrimonious controversy which convulsed the churches until 1890. One of the points at issue was Thomas's policy (opposed by Jones) of seeking to create a more organized and centralized form of Congregationalism. During the controversy Thomas displayed his abilities as a campaign organizer and as a leader who was adept at concealing an unbending determination behind a veil of Victorian courtesy. He was the prime mover in the formation of the Union of Welsh Independents in 1871 and was its chairman in 1878. He was chairman of the Congregational Union of England and Wales in 1885.<br>
<br>Thomas was also an able journalist and author. He edited two monthly magazines, <span class="italic">Y Gwerinwr</span> in 1855 and 1856, and <span class="italic">Yr Anibynnwr</span> from 1857 to 1861. His most influential literary platform, however, was the weekly newspaper <span class="italic">Y Tyst</span>, which he edited jointly with William Rees (1802&#150;1883) until 1872, and on his own until his death. After the general election of 1868 he took an enthusiastic interest in Liberal politics, and was one of the leading advocates of disestablishment. He published sermons, biographies, novels, and a massive five-volume history of the Welsh Congregational churches, in co-operation with Thomas Rees (1815&#150;1885).<br>
<br>John Thomas died at Old Colwyn on 14 July 1892 and was buried at Anfield cemetery, Liverpool.<br>
