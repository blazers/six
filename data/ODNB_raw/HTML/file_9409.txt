<span class="headword">Fiennes <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Sackville]</span>,  Anne</span>, Lady Dacre  (<em>d.</em> 1595), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24447/', "Sir Richard Sackville (d. 1566)")</script>, administrator, of Ashburnham and Buckhurst, Sussex, and his wife, Winifred (<i>d</i>. 1586), daughter of Sir John Brydges of London, and his wife, Agnes. Nothing is known of her education but it was probably by private tuition, followed by a period of service as gentlewoman in the household of one of her father's colleagues and social equals. Her paternal grandmother was a cousin of Anne Boleyn. Her father's wealth provided Anne with a substantial dowry and by November 1558 she was married to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9410/', "Gregory Fiennes, tenth Baron Dacre (1539&#150;1594)")</script>, courtier and landowner, second, but only surviving, son of Thomas Fiennes, ninth Baron Dacre, and his wife, Mary. A daughter, who was living in 1565, died young and there are no other known children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Following the death of her father in 1566 Lady Dacre's mother became the second wife of William Paulet, first marquess of Winchester. Her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24450/', "Sir Thomas Sackville")</script>, who was raised to the peerage as first Baron Buckhurst in 1567, was a trusted servant of Elizabeth I. Lady Dacre and her husband were close to the court and enjoyed the convenience of a house in Westminster. She appears from the evidence of the state papers and her will to have been a determined and exacting woman, who was also somewhat imperious. Her husband by contrast was a considerably weaker character, who was dominated initially by his mother and later by his wife. At one time Lady Dacre fell out with her brother and there were legal disputes with her husband's family over their concern to prevent the alienation of Fiennes lands. On the death of her mother in 1586 the couple came into possession of Sir Thomas More's former house at Chelsea, which had been granted to Winchester after More's execution. It was at Chelsea that Lord Dacre died on 25 September 1594. They appear to have been a close couple, despite the strains imposed by their failure to produce an heir. Lady Dacre wrote her will the following December, when she was already ill, and also died at Chelsea, on 14 May 1595. She directed that she should be buried alongside her husband in the More chapel, Chelsea, &#145;without all earthlie pompe but with some privat freindes and nott to be ripped [embalmed]&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/86, sig. 41). An elaborate tomb was subsequently erected.<br>
<br>Lady Dacre's will is a long and detailed document, which reveals a good deal about her character and how she wished to present herself to posterity. It begins with a lengthy exposition of her religious faith using a formulary favoured by protestants, followed by demonstrations of her loyalty to the crown in the form of a gift of a jewel worth &pound;300 to the queen and of &#145;my Jewell of the Quenes Maiesties picture&#146; to Buckhurst. Her concern for the poor and her wish to leave a lasting monument to herself and her husband is revealed in the detailed instructions for the endowment of an almshouse for twenty paupers and twenty poor children at Tothill Field adjacent to their Westminster house. Her concern for her servants and the importance of her friends to this childless woman are shown by numerous individual legacies, which amount in value to over &pound;3000. The prominence of members of the queen's household among the legatees demonstrates her closeness to the court. Her house in Chelsea was bequeathed to William Cecil, first Baron Burghley, for life and then to his younger son Sir Robert Cecil and &#145;my deere freinde&#146; his wife, Elizabeth, and their heirs. The bequest of her house in Hayes, Kent, to &#145;my lovinge freinde&#146; Edward Fenner, justice of the king's bench, alongside bequests to Sir Thomas Egerton, master of the rolls, and Thomas Owen, justice of the common pleas, is suggestive of the importance litigation and consequently legal advice had played in her life. The Westminster house was bequeathed to her nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24449/', "Robert Sackville, second Baron Buckhurst and second earl of Dorset")</script>, with the manor of Barwick, Sussex and a house there. The continued friction with her husband's family is revealed by the lack of personal bequests to them. Only her husband's niece, who had married the son of Lady Dacre's friend Lady Waller, was to derive any benefit from the will in the form of lands in Middlesex, provided her father Sampson Lennard paid &pound;2000 and did not challenge the will.<br>
