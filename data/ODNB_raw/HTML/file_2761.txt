<span class="headword">Boehm,  Anthony William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Anton Wilhelm B&ouml;hme]</span>  (1673&#150;1722), <span class="occ">Lutheran minister and religious writer</span>, was born on 1 June 1673 at &Ouml;sdorf in the county of Waldeck, Germany, the fifth son of Anton B&ouml;hme (1623/4&#150;1679), pastor, and Anna Catharina Oynhausen (1640/41&#150;1717). Educated at the newly founded University of Halle from 1693 to 1698 Boehm was the leading representative in England of Halle pietism, a &#145;new Reformation&#146; within the Lutheran church of Germany, which sought to revive the practice of Christianity through inward and personal spiritual renewal. In Halle, Boehm was influenced by August Hermann Francke, the organizational mastermind and charismatic promoter of Halle pietism. A brief stint as a court tutor in Arolsen, Germany, ended in controversy because of Boehm's uncompromising pietist beliefs. He then moved to London to establish a school for German children; however, his frail, asthmatic constitution curtailed his ability to teach and he lived for years in poverty. His fortunes changed in 1705 when Prince George of Denmark invited him to become his court chaplain at the German Lutheran chapel at St James's, where he remained until his death.<br>
<br>Boehm's legacy is threefold. First, as the prince's chaplain he carried on an active pastoral ministry even though he was never ordained. His primary role was preaching and Prince George held it in such esteem that he appointed a second chaplain to administer the sacraments. Boehm made weekly visits to the prisons and became a significant figure in their reform. His introduction to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK) resulted from a shared interest in prison reform. Known for his concern for the destitute he was eulogized as &#145;a Hearty Friend to the Poor at Home&#146; by the secretary of the SPCK  (Newman). However, his dominant pastoral concern as a pietist was for the salvation of individual souls. Not only was Boehm engaged in the pastoral care of Germans in London but he also reached out to the thousands of German Palatine emigrants who arrived in London between 1708 and 1710, seeking passage to the New World. By procuring large shipments of bibles and devotional writings he hoped primarily to care for their spiritual well-being. Indeed Boehm and future Lutheran chaplains adopted an unofficial mothering role toward their &#145;daughter&#146; churches in the colonies, thereby influencing the rise of American Lutheranism.<br>
<br>Second, Boehm was remembered for his involvement in the SPCK. A newly founded voluntary society, its main <i>modus operandi</i> was education, made evident by its co-ordination of the fledgeling charity school movement and by its distribution of Christian publications. After taking a tour of charity schools Boehm decided to translate and publish Francke's account of the rise of the orphanage in Halle. <span class="italic">Pietas Hallensis</span> appeared in 1705, helping to further the charity school movement and to encourage the SPCK. On 7 September 1710 the society, following Boehm's proposal, decided to lend its support to the East India mission. Principally at Boehm's instigation the SPCK became increasingly entwined in international operations that overshadowed its domestic interests for the next thirty years. Most unusually, in the East India mission an Anglican society supported a royal Danish mission in sending German Lutheran pietist missionaries from Halle to southern India. As a non-Anglican SPCK member Boehm prodded the SPCK to sustain its participation. At one point he found himself mediating in a brewing conflict within the society (initiated by Archbishop Thomas Tenison) over the use of non-episcopally ordained missionaries in an Anglican-supported enterprise. The society considered him the &#145;grand cement&#146; that held together this remarkable effort in pragmatic ecumenism  (Henry Newman to William Wake, Middle Temple, 28 May 1722, Christ Church Library, Oxford, Wake MS 24.121). The worldwide focus of the society intensified in 1720; Boehm was the mainspring in persuading the SPCK to take on its most ambitious publishing venture to date, the preparation of an Arabic psalter, <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, and catechism.<br>
<br>Finally, Boehm's legacy is seen in his publishing activity. From 1709 to 1721 he kept the East India mission before the English public with updated editions of <span class="italic">Propagation of the Gospel in the East</span>. Among his English translations of German works, he translated and edited various works by Francke, including two Latin pieces by which he hoped to contribute to theological study in England. The most influential of Francke's works was <span class="italic">Nicodemus, or, A Treatise Against the Fear of Man</span>, which John Wesley later abridged and published. The most important author to Boehm, however, was Johann Arndt, whose <span class="italic">True Christianity</span>, in the early seventeenth century, revived an emphasis on piety lost since the Reformation. Boehm placed high hopes on his translations into both Latin and English of <span class="italic">True Christianity</span>; this work best represented his own desire to spread a common, non-sectarian Christianity that would rise above party differences. Many of Boehm's own works were also published, including sermons, catechisms, and his major treatise <span class="italic">Enchiridion precum</span> (1715), which consisted of prayers and extracts in over fifty categories. Most of his published sermons were collected in <span class="italic">Several Discourses and Tracts for Promoting the Common Interest of True Christianity</span> (1717). From 1705 scarcely a year passed in which Boehm did not publish at least one work. Through his literary output he influenced many Anglicans, nonconformists, and evangelicals; he was one of the few &#145;respectable&#146; non-Anglican writers who promoted neglected Reformation ideals in the period between puritanism and the evangelical revival. Boehm died, unmarried, on 27 May 1722 in Greenwich, at the country home of his friend Dr Frederick Slare. Isaac Watts wrote of him: &#145;I fear there are but few such Men in the Ministry, British or German, Episcopal or Presbyterian, etc. I am sorry the World and the Church has sustained so heavy a Stroke&#146;  (Isaac Watts to [J. C. Jacobi], Rambach, 40). Boehm was buried at Greenwich on 30 May 1722.<br>
