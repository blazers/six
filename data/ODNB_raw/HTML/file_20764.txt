<span class="headword">O'Neil,  Henry Nelson</span>  (1817&#150;1880), <span class="occ">historical genre painter</span>, was born on 7 January 1817 in St Petersburg, Russia, of British parents. Of his early life nothing is known, except that at the age of six, in 1823, O'Neil went to England with his family. By 1836 he was enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools and there O'Neil met Alfred Elmore, who became a close friend. In the late 1830s they were founding members of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/64214', "Clique")</script>, a sketching club, together with Richard Dadd, Augustus Egg, William Powell Frith, and John Phillip. All were diligent students with differing views on art, who wished to depict modern subjects with a strong emotional element, as a rebellion against the authority of the Royal Academy. They sought to paint better and met every week to draw on a theme, later discussing, comparing, and judging their sketches. O'Neil, in particular, wanted his work to appeal to the viewers' emotions. In 1838 he exhibited his first pictures: at the Royal Academy <span class="italic">A Student</span> and at the Society of British Artists in Suffolk Street <span class="italic">A Jewish Doctor</span>, but his work did not receive much notice until after his return from a trip to Italy with Elmore in 1840. O'Neil exhibited fourteen paintings at the Suffolk Street gallery from 1838 until 1843, and thirty-four pictures at the British Institution from 1839 until 1861. All his major works were shown at the Royal Academy, including more than ninety paintings between 1838 and 1879.<br>
<br>The two works for which O'Neil is best-known were <span class="italic">Eastward Ho! August 1857</span> (exh. RA, 1858; priv. coll.) and <span class="italic">Home Again, 1858</span> (exh. RA, 1859; priv. coll.). The subject of <span class="italic">Eastward Ho!</span> was the Indian mutiny of August 1857, when the greatest number of British troops departed for India to suppress the mutiny of the Bengal army. When the Royal Academy exhibition opened in May 1858, news of the massacres and reprisals still dominated the news. The picture's appeal to patriotic fervour and its focus on the domestic side of military life ensured that it was an immediate success: the picture drew huge crowds, exceeded only by those looking at W. P. Frith's <span class="italic">Derby Day</span>. The success of O'Neil's embarkation painting led to its sequel in the following year, <span class="italic">Home Again, 1858</span>, where several of the same figures are shown receiving the returning soldiers, a picture that was only slightly less successful in drawing the crowds. Both paintings are examples of the depiction of current events as narratives that are particularly moving because of their implied themes of separation and family loss. Both pictures, like others of O'Neil's paintings, were engraved and widely distributed, and gained great popularity. These two paintings were so much sought after that O'Neil painted several versions in varying sizes, as well as copies of details of some of the main figures. On the basis of their success O'Neil was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1860, although he never became a Royal Academician. His pictorial pageants also include <span class="italic">The Landing of her Royal Highness the Princess Alexandra at Gravesend, 7th March 1863</span> (exh. RA, 1864; NPG).<br>
<br>In the 1860s O'Neil also began to produce portraits, scenes of famous artists, and landscapes. He also played the violin, and wrote on art. O'Neil's published works include <span class="italic">Modern Art in England and France</span> (1869) and <span class="italic">The Age of Stucco: a Satire in Three Cantos</span> (1871). He also published the lectures on painting he gave at the Royal Academy. The quality of his art declined in later years. He was a member of the Garrick Club and counted among his friends Elmore, Frith, Frederic Leighton, John Everett Millais, and the novelists Charles Reade and Anthony Trollope. O'Neil died at his home&#151;7 Victoria Road, Kensington, London&#151;on 13 March 1880, leaving a widow, Claudia Anne Greatorex. He was buried at Kensal Green. The contents of his studio were sold by Christie, Manson, and Wood on 18 June 1880. Anthony Trollope in an obituary describes him as &#145;one who was simple, just, and affectionate as a child&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>).<br>
