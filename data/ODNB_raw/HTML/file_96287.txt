<span class="headword">Servants of Samuel Pepys</span>  (<em>act. </em>1658&#150;1703) <span class="occ"></span>are mostly known through their appearances in the private diary kept by their employer between 1660 and 1669. The fact that they are presented there in a light controlled by the many-sided egotism of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21906/', "Samuel Pepys's")</script> personality does not prevent his record of his own, and his household's, day-by-day existence from illuminating the lives and occupations of a number of predominantly young people, whose activities seem usually to have been typical of those of male and female servants in early modern London, but which are seldom preserved for posterity with such vividness of detail. From 1656 until her death in November 1669 Pepys shared the management of his household with his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/77209/', "Elizabeth Pepys")</script>. Thereafter until the end of his life he had the assistance of his mistress, Mary Skinner. The fact that there were numerous domestic concerns that were customarily directed by the householder's wife or partner inevitably means that Pepys observed or recorded them as an outsider. On the other hand, he had at least some personal experience of domestic service, and knew what it was like to be at the disposal of others. In his early twenties he had occupied a position in the London household of his cousin Edward Montagu, later first earl of Sandwich, that seems to have been somewhere between that of a minor officer and a favoured servant, but was probably closer to the latter&#151;in 1655 he had received a letter from Montagu addressed &#145;For my servant Samuel Pepys at my lodgings in Whitehall&#146;  (Wheatley, 35). It was probably an experience that taught him the rudiments of household management, a skill that tended to prevail over his sympathies during his later life.<h2>
<a name="Anexemplaryservant"></a>An exemplary servant</h2>It has been estimated that some 13 per cent of the population of late seventeenth-century London consisted of servants, among whom women outnumbered men in the ratio of approximately 4:1. Pepys began to tap this labour supply in 1658, when he and his wife first occupied a home of their own, renting a house in Axe Yard, off King Street, in Whitehall. With them was their servant <a name="cosubject_96283"></a><span class="headword">Jane Birch <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Edwards; <em>other married name </em>Penny]</span></span>  (<em>b. </em>1643/4, <em>d.</em> after 1703)<span class="occ"></span>, who was then aged fourteen and who remained intermittently in Pepys's employment until he died. Except in its length, there was much in her service that was typical of women servants in this period. After Samuel was appointed clerk of the acts of the navy on 13 July 1660 she accompanied him and Elizabeth to the new home that they occupied in the Navy Office complex in Seething Lane, near the Tower of London. Jane stayed there with them until 26 August 1661, when she returned &#145;into the country&#146; to her mother, showing that she was not a native Londoner, but had presumably come to the capital in search of employment. Since on 1 January 1660 Pepys recorded himself as &#145;esteemed rich, but endeed very poor&#146;, Jane could have hoped only for a fairly minimal wage, probably between &pound;2 and &pound;3 per annum (two years later she was able to insist on the latter sum). In the early days of her employment Jane was a maid of all work&#151;cleaning, cooking, and mending. She was on good terms with Elizabeth, who on 23 January 1660 even dressed her hair, making her look &#145;very pretty&#146;&#151;possibly an unfortunate development, since Jane became apt to catch Samuel's constantly roving eye. On 1 August 1662 he recorded having &#145;a mind to my own wench&#146;, but then and later he prudently resisted temptation, &#145;for fear she should prove honest and refuse and then tell my wife&#146;; on 16 September 1668 he was less restrained, however, fondling her in ways which &#145;ella did give way to more then usual heretofore, so as I have a design to try more what I can bring it to&#146;. Though matters seem to have gone no further, it was not entirely without reason that on the following 7 February Elizabeth became jealous of the maid&#151;&#145;she did believe me false to her with Jane&#146;&#151;and probably just as well that Jane left the Pepys household to get married in March 1669.<br>
<br>As Pepys rose in the world he became able to afford a larger and more specialized household. From 25 March 1662 Jane, who had now returned to London, was employed as cook&#150;maid on &pound;3 per annum (&#145;she would not serve under&#146;), and in that capacity produced such delicacies as &#145;a good dish of stewed beef of Jane's own dressing&#146;, a masterpiece served up on 11 May 1662. In December she was promoted to chambermaid, making her responsible for her mistress's clothes, but on the 26th she quarrelled with Elizabeth, who complained of &#145;some sawcy words&#146; from Jane, while on the 31st Samuel recorded her as &#145;growing proud and negligent&#146; and decided to part with her again. She left in February 1663, she and Pepys both weeping at her departure. Elizabeth's relations with her servants were always liable to be problematic. Her husband seems to have been usually able to relax in the company of his domestics: on 13 November 1663, for instance, he recorded complacently how after he had had his hair cut off and made into a periwig, he &#145;caused all my maids to look upon it and they conclude it to become me, though Jane was mightily troubled for my parting with my own hair and so was Besse&#146;. But Elizabeth had had no previous experience as an employer, and was apt to become friendly with her maids before remembering at intervals that she was supposed to be the lady of the house. The resulting alternation of familiarity and distance added to the problems of the Pepys household.<br>
<br>Jane returned again in March 1666 after Elizabeth had sought her out. She was again employed principally as a cook. To Samuel she was now &#145;our little old Jane&#146; (she was in fact about ten years younger than him), and despite his predatory impulses both he and Elizabeth clearly regarded her with affection. When her brother William died in July 1667 Samuel gave her money and wine for the funeral. And during all her years of working for the Pepyses she also benefited from the friendly companionship, and even love, of her fellow servants. In December 1662 she had wept at the departure of Sarah, whom she replaced as chambermaid. When she herself left shortly afterwards, her going was clearly regretted &#145;below stairs&#146;&#151;on 11 January 1664, nearly a year later, Elizabeth was irritated to overhear Samuel's clerk Will Hewer saying &#145;what a good maid my old maid Jane was and that she would never have her like again&#146;. And following her second return it was within the Pepys household that she found a husband.<h2>
<a name="Twoboys"></a>Two boys</h2>One of the essential adjuncts of Pepys's position at the Navy Office was a boy, who wore his livery (with a sword), walked in attendance upon him, and ran errands for him. One of the first of these was Jane's second brother, <a name="cosubject_96284"></a><span class="headword">Wayneman Birch</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1660&#150;1663)<span class="occ"></span>, described as &#145;a pretty well-looked boy&#146; when he entered Samuel's service on 22 September 1660, and whose identification with his master became such that on the following 14 February he was referred to as &#145;young Pepys&#146;. His employer found him engaging at first, but he soon developed a number of tiresome habits, mostly conventional manifestations of original sin, though he once contrived to explode some gunpowder in his pocket.<br>
<br>Samuel's response to Wayneman's misbehaviour was similarly conventional. Servants were regarded as members of their employer's &#145;family&#146; (an expression Pepys often used to describe his household), and were accordingly disciplined with methods appropriate to an age when the right of paternal authority to inflict physical chastisement went largely undisputed. On 1 January 1660 Samuel had been so exasperated by Jane's untidiness that he &#145;took a broom and basted her till she cried extremely&#146;, though he immediately regretted his unkindness. Wayneman was much more harshly treated, receiving repeated beatings, though these seem usually to have hurt Pepys much more than they did his servant&#151;on 28 February 1662 he recorded that &#145;the rods were so small that I fear that they did not much hurt to him, but only to my arme, which I am already, within a Quarter of an houre, not able to stir almost&#146;. When Jane begged for mercy for her brother during another of these whippings, on 18 April following, Pepys pleaded the need to correct the boy's faults, &#145;or else he would be undone&#146;, but Wayneman proved incorrigible. Pepys already had it in mind to turn him away at the end of 1662. Though he retained his place until the following summer, he was finally dismissed after being spotted playing with other boys in his best suit. He was last recorded in November 1663, being then sent to Barbados as an indentured servant.<br>
<br>By May 1664 Pepys was thinking of employing another boy, one who could wait on him and also work in the Navy Office. In August he engaged <a name="cosubject_96285"></a><span class="headword">Thomas <span class="st"> [Tom]</span> Edwards</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1681)<span class="occ"></span>, a boy in his teens who was in the process of leaving the Chapel Royal, where he had been a chorister. His musicality, which extended to playing the lute and theorbo as well as singing, appealed to Samuel, and he was also liked by Elizabeth, who on 3 February 1665 was found sitting with him &#145;in the dark, telling of stories&#146;, and whom Samuel thought inclined to spoil the boy. As Tom began to work as a clerk he made friends with his colleagues&#151;in 1667 he shared a Christmas dinner with three of them&#151;but his most important relationship developed closer to home, with Jane Birch. On 11 February 1668 Elizabeth told her husband how &#145;our Tom and Jane&#146; had admitted to having fallen in love and wishing to marry. Samuel was worried about his own position at the time, but gave a slightly grudging consent, undertaking &#145;to give her 50<i>l</i>. in money and do them all the good I can in my way.&#146;.<br>
<br>The prospect of Jane's marriage may have induced a spasm of jealousy in Pepys, prompting his advances later that year, and leading in turn to matching (and much better justified) outbreaks of jealousy on the part both of Elizabeth and of Tom himself, who on 19 August prompted a fit of hysterics in Jane, thanks to her fianc&eacute;'s being &#145;now cold in it&#146;. In this fraught atmosphere it was finally decided that Jane should leave at the following Easter, and that Tom should go with her, though assured of Pepys's continuing good will. Samuel declined to go to the wedding, which was organized by Elizabeth on 26 March 1669, but was as good as his word in providing the newly-weds with financial assistance&#151;he paid for their wedding dinner, and agreed to give them &pound;60, to which Elizabeth added &pound;20 more. He also maintained Tom's employment by the Navy Office, secured promotion for him, and in 1673 stood godfather for his first-born son. Edwards died in 1681, and his widow returned to work for Pepys. She was married again, to one George Penny, but soon lost this husband too. She retained the favour of her first employer, however, for in 1690 Pepys gave her a &pound;15 annuity, and confirmed it in his will, in which he also left Jane &pound;5 5<i>s</i>. to buy mourning clothes. It was a poignant end to a relationship that had extended over forty-five years.<h2>
<a name="Comingsandgoings"></a>Comings and goings</h2>Tom Edwards had been recommended to Pepys by the latter's friend the composer Captain Henry Cooke, while Wayneman Birch was presumably introduced by his sister. It is not known how Jane herself entered Pepys's employment, but the latter's diary has much to say of other servants in this respect. Most came with recommendations from neighbours, friends, or relations, who included the Navy Office's doorkeeper and waterman, Samuel's lawyer cousin Roger Pepys, his rival for naval promotion John Creed, and his friend and neighbour the linen draper William Batelier. A disastrous experiment conducted within his family briefly brought Samuel's plain and cross-grained sister <a name="cosubject_96286"></a><span class="headword">Paulina Pepys <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Jackson]</span></span>  (1640&#150;1689)<span class="occ"></span>, known as Pall, into his household. On 12 November 1660 Samuel and Elizabeth offered to &#145;have her not as a sister in any respect but as a servant&#146;, a suggestion received by Pall with tears of joy. She arrived on 2 January 1661, to be discouragingly greeted by her brother, who refused to let her sit down at table with him, &#145;that she may not expect it hereafter from me&#146;. But the distinction between sister and servant proved impossible to maintain. On a few occasions Pall was allowed to accompany Elizabeth on visits to her own relations, but otherwise she was kept at home, where by 23 June she had become increasingly &#145;proud and Idle&#146;, undermining the domestic discipline that Samuel was struggling to enforce. In July he resolved to send her to join their parents, now living in rural squalor in Huntingdonshire, and on 5 September she departed, with 20<i>s</i>. and an infinity of good advice, shedding as many tears as when she had arrived. In January 1663 Elizabeth suggested having her back as her attendant, but then changed her mind, while Samuel was resolutely opposed, on 23 April confiding in his father &#145;my distrust of Pall, both for her good nature and housewifery&#146;. Instead he applied himself to finding her a husband, finally achieving this in 1668.<br>
<br>Another agent was Elizabeth's brother Balthasar, or Balty, de St Michel, a man of eccentric personality and unreliable judgement, consistently distrusted by Samuel, who recorded that the cook&#150;maid Susan had arrived on Balty's recommendation on 10 December 1662, &#145;for which I like her never the better&#146;. On one occasion she produced a dinner so much better than expected that her employer gave her 6<i>d</i>., but she took to drink and was dismissed in May 1663. At least she lasted longer than Jinny, a &#145;little girl&#146; who had been maintained by St Bride's parish and was sent to his brother by Tom Pepys, himself acting on a recommendation from the churchwarden. Jinny arrived at noon on 20 August 1663, to be cleaned and put into new clothes by her employers, whereupon she ran away in them that night. Next day the beadle of St Bride's returned both girl and garments, for which the parish paid him 6<i>d</i>.; the fee doubtless also covered the whipping demanded by Pepys for the runaway, after she had been put back into her old clothes. It was in fact increasingly common for would-be employers to ask for references from potential servants, and the Pepyses often did so, to the extent that Samuel thought it worthy of note that Hannah, another cook&#150;maid, had been hired without one in March 1663. She proved a good cook but an unsatisfactory cleaner, and was finally dismissed in August for stealing, whereupon she departed in precisely fifteen minutes.<br>
<br>As Pepys's fortunes improved so his household grew. In 1660 he had employed a single maid, but by the end of 1666 he had four maids (one of them a companion for his wife) and a boy. There was a considerable demand, and competition, for good servants in Restoration London, and a well-qualified cook or chambermaid could move easily from one position to another. Sarah, dismissed by the Pepyses at the end of 1662, promptly moved in with the Penns next door, and stayed there until the following March, when she was turned away in a neighbourly gesture rare among the quarrelsome members of the Navy Office. And even then she seems to have remained on good terms with her former associates in the Pepys household, since in June 1665 she sent Will Hewer a lobster. Unsurprisingly, servants' wages rose. Jane Birch could insist on &pound;3 per annum in 1662, while a cook who arrived in March 1663 was able to demand &pound;4, but then her previous employer had been the duke of Albemarle&#151;the &#145;very tall mayd&#146; (probably another Jane) who required &pound;5 for the same office in May 1664 was faced down by Elizabeth, who still had to pay &pound;3 10<i>s</i>. for her services.<br>
<br>The proximity in which Samuel and Elizabeth lived to their servants made the diarist observant of their qualities, and though he was often critical he could be appreciative too. He wanted a peaceful and contented household, and recorded gratefully on 31 December 1664 that &#145;a pretty and loving quiet family I have as any man in England&#146;, but his resigned comment of 10 September 1663, as yet another good cook went&#151;&#145;we having no luck in maids nowadays&#146;&#151;seems more typical of his domestic fortunes. Some of these maids proved quarrelsome or light-fingered; others took to drink. Nell Payne, a waterman's daughter whom Pepys made persistent efforts to seduce, was dismissed on 5 August 1667 for having &#145;turned a mere gossip and gads abroad as soon as our backs are turned&#146;, and Bess, having been described at the end of 1663 by Samuel as &#145;our excellent good-natured cook&#150;maid&#146;, became so intolerably careless that on 10 November 1664 she had to be sacked as well, having &#145;no care nor memory of her business at all&#146;. In the case of Susan, a diminutive cook who showed an unexpected talent for lifting heavy weights, and whom Pepys characterized on 21 February 1664 as &#145;a most admirable slut and pleases us mightily&#146;, the fact that her departure in 1666 seems to have been caused by sickness cannot have made her employers feel any less put-upon.<h2>
<a name="CompanionsforElizabeth"></a>Companions for Elizabeth</h2>An additional factor that increasingly complicated the life of the Pepys household was the presence within it of a series of young women who were employed as companions for Elizabeth. Kept at home by her husband, by November 1662 she was complaining of feeling lonely, and persuaded him to employ a gentlewoman to attend upon her. The first candidate for this position was found by Balty, with predictably unfortunate results. <a name="cosubject_96287"></a><span class="headword">Winifred Gosnell</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1662&#150;1669)<span class="occ"></span> was all that could be hoped for in terms of accomplishments and social background&#151;she sang and danced well, and had an uncle who was a JP&#151;but turned out to have come with radically mistaken assumptions as to what her position might entail. She arrived on 5 November 1662, and on the 8th it transpired that Balty had led her to believe that she would &#145;go every day in the week to Court and plays, and that she should have liberty of going abroad as often as she pleased&#146;; Pepys, however, expected her to share, and thus relieve, his wife's relative seclusion. Consequently Gosnell left on the 9th, having stayed for just four nights, and by the following May was pursuing a modestly successful career on the stage.<br>
<br>Pepys had been excited at the prospect of Gosnell's arrival. The terms in which he recorded his impressions of his wife's subsequent companions show all too clearly how his own expectations were liable to confuse and confound Elizabeth's hopes and needs. He principally wanted good looks and musical skills, or at any rate aptitude, in these girls, together with a becoming modesty of demeanour and a willingness to stay at home with his wife. While there is no evidence that Elizabeth was particularly musical, she was well aware of her husband's susceptibility to female beauty (if not yet of how far this sometimes actually led him), and she hoped for at least a degree of social freedom as well as congenial domestic companionship.<br>
<br>Gosnell's successor <a name="cosubject_96288"></a><span class="headword">Mary Ashwell</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1662&#150;1664) also came on Balty's recommendation, followed up this time by extended discussions with the girl's family. On 29 December 1662 she was described as &#145;a young gentlewoman &hellip; of a good family and that can sing&#146;, on 14 March 1663, two days after her arrival, as &#145;a very pretty ingenuous girl&#146;. The daughter of an exchequer official, she had previously been a <span class="occ">teacher</span> in a girls' school in Chelsea, and during a Sunday walk on 26 April she impressed Pepys with her &#145;most prodigious memory&#146; of plays she had taken part in six or seven years earlier. With her youthful high spirits&#151;the word &#145;merry&#146; recurs frequently&#151;she got on well at first with Elizabeth, who was probably only a few years her senior. But as time passed Ashwell's presence began to seem unfortunate. On 19 April 1663 her &#145;very fine carriage&#146; led to Elizabeth's wishing to emulate it by taking dancing lessons, thereby triggering off one of Samuel's most memorable fits of jealousy. And about the same time Elizabeth started to show signs of a reciprocal jealousy directed at Samuel, who had been teaching Ashwell music. A rupture finally came in June, during a visit to Samuel's parents' house at Brampton, Huntingdonshire, when the two women exchanged &#145;high words&#146; and even blows. In August Ashwell went back to teaching, rather to the relief of Samuel, though he was pleased to see her when she paid a visit, &#145;as merry as ever&#146;, on 17 January 1664.<br>
<br>Nearly a year passed before a replacement for Ashwell was found. <a name="cosubject_96289"></a><span class="headword">Mary Mercer</span>  (<em>b. </em>1647)<span class="occ"></span>, described on 8 September 1664 as &#145;a decayed merchant's daughter&#146;, was suggested by Will Hewer, who had taken lodgings in her mother's house. She was less ebullient than her predecessor; at the end of 1664 Samuel referred to her as &#145;a pretty modest quiet maid&#146;, no doubt because she was prepared to undertake domestic tasks that included combing his hair and washing his ears. She danced well and had a good ear for music, though she did not improve it by practice. Above all she evidently had an attractive singing voice, and often sang with Samuel, a duet that Elizabeth sometimes made into a trio. On 22 June 1667 the sound of her singing with Tom Edwards moved Pepys to ecstasy&#151;&#145;making exceeding good music, to the joy of my heart that I should be the maister of it&#146;. In fact Mercer was by then no longer in Pepys's employment. As early as 19 September 1664 Elizabeth had been becoming suspicious of her husband's intentions towards the newcomer; though her fears may have been groundless at this stage, from the spring of 1666 Samuel seems to have made a habit of fondling Mercer's breasts while she dressed him in the morning. But it was not her husband's roving eye, or hands, that led to Mercer's dismissal, but the latter's understandable concern for her mother during the great fire in September. Returning to her home against orders on the 3rd, she was found there by Elizabeth and given notice, whereupon she departed. But although efforts to re-engage her were firmly rebuffed, she remained on friendly terms with the Pepyses. She went to the theatre and on outings with them, and continued to sing with Samuel, notwithstanding his continued advances. As late as April 1669 he recorded taking his hat off to her in the street.<br>
<br>It was probably no coincidence that Mercer's successor, recorded only as <a name="cosubject_96290"></a><span class="headword">Barker</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1665&#150;1667)<span class="occ"></span>, should have lacked the former's physical allure. She had been introduced to Pepys on 21 September 1665, when Samuel noted her as being &#145;a plain little girl&#146;. It is not surprising that when she moved in with the Pepyses a year later Elizabeth should have liked her more at first than her husband did, though on 18 October 1666 the latter was gratified to discover &#145;what a good pretty wench our Barker makes&#146;, once she was provided with expensive new clothes. She had a good singing voice, but proved exasperatingly slow to improve in the use of it, and there seems to have been relief on both sides when she was given notice on 12 May 1667, after Elizabeth had found Barker &#145;to have been abroad and tells her so many lies about it, that she struck her&#146;. She left next day, when Samuel recorded that Barker &#145;did always declare to her mistress and others that she had rather be put to drudgery and to wash the house then to live as she did, like a gentlewoman&#146;. Clearly she had found herself in a false position in more senses than one.<br>
<br>Elizabeth had no further companion until the end of September 1667, when a replacement for Barker was found by William Batelier. <a name="cosubject_96291"></a><span class="headword">Deborah <span class="st"> [Deb]</span> Willett <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Wells]</span></span>  (1650/51&#150;1678)<span class="occ"></span> was the daughter of a Bristol merchant who had been brought up in London by an aunt following the deaths of her parents. In 1667, when she was aged seventeen, she had just left a boarding school at Bow. Reviewing the situation on 24 September 1667, Pepys resolved to leave it to Elizabeth to choose her own attendant, though when he discovered on the 27th that the girl was &#145;mighty pretty&#146; he was sufficiently aware of his own weaknesses to record that he &#145;could be contented as to my own judgment, though not to my passion, that she might not come, lest I may be found too much minding her, to the discontent of my wife&#146;.<br>
<br>But come she did, bringing trouble with her. Demure and petite, at first Willett made a wholly favourable impression, and it was no fault of her own that she became the cause of violent discord between the Pepyses. Though she danced and played at cards, Deb (as Samuel was soon calling her, whereas her predecessors were usually only referred to by their surnames) seems to have had no musical talent. She went shopping with Elizabeth and accompanied her to the theatre, and attended the Pepyses both on a visit to Brampton and on an extended jaunt to the west country, during which her coming to Bristol brought joy to people who remembered her parents. But as a counterpoint to her domestic services to Elizabeth there developed the increasingly insistent theme of Samuel's sexual advances, beginning with a kiss in December, and continuing from the following March with ever more intimate fumblings and gropings, despite Deb's initial efforts to fend them off. Intermittent outbursts of ill temper by Elizabeth suggest that she had sensed the affair's development, but that it was never literally consummated was due only to her surprising Samuel and Deb in a close and passionate embrace on 25 October. After that it was quickly decided that Deb must leave, and on 14 November she went, having received &pound;10 as her wages for a year and a half-quarter. Yet despite his wife's fury, and his own awareness of the likely consequences of the affair for Deb, &#145;whom I fear I have undone by this&#146;, Samuel's obsession with her was now such that he persisted in seeing her, and in continuing their muted intimacies, until the middle of April 1669, only forbearing when she moved to Greenwich.<h2>
<a name="Afterthediary"></a>After the diary</h2>Pepys ceased to keep a diary on 31 May 1669, in his last entry referring to his &#145;amours to Deb&#146; as a thing of the past. Elizabeth died on 10 November in the same year, making it necessary for her husband to reorder his domestic arrangements, which he did in the following year by setting up Mary Skinner at their head. Not long afterwards Deb Willett re-entered his life, through her husband, Jeremiah Wells (1646&#150;1679), an Oxford-educated parson whom she had married at Chelmsford on 27 January 1670. Wells moved to Whitechapel shortly afterwards, and solicited Pepys's patronage, doubtless at the instigation of his young wife. Whether there was now or later any more direct contact between Deb and Samuel is unknown, but at any rate it seems reasonable to assume that a residual <i>tendresse</i> for his wife's last significant companion played a part in moving Pepys to generosity. He secured a naval chaplaincy for Wells in October 1671, and probably also helped him in 1676 to become curate of All Hallows Barking, the church at the south end of Seething Lane, very near where the Navy Office had recently stood. It is possible that Pepys had at first assisted Wells in the hope of thereby advancing his own previously frustrated relationship with Deb, and even of getting him out of the way by sending him to sea. By 1676, however, her health was probably failing. She had a daughter, also named Deborah, late in 1670, but no more children are recorded, and she died in the spring of 1678 and was buried in All Hallows on 30 March. Her husband, who subsequently remarried, remained on friendly terms with Pepys until he himself died on 23 August 1679.<br>
<br>Pepys's household had continued to grow during these years. It had already been reinforced in November 1668 by the arrival of a coachman, and it expanded further thereafter, despite two changes of address. A fire in 1673 led to the Navy Office moving to Derby House, south of the Strand, from where Pepys himself moved again in 1679 to York Buildings, a short distance down the river, where he stayed until he finally settled in Will Hewer's house at Clapham in 1701. During the 1670s a housekeeper and a butler arrived, to be joined by a black boy (sold in 1680), while in 1697 he recorded a staff at York Buildings made up of porter, housekeeper, coachman, cook, laundrymaid, housemaid, and two footmen. In his will Pepys left mourning clothes to seven former servants and dependants, headed by Jane Penny, suggesting grateful memories of past services. But there is also evidence that his household arrangements could be as problematic in the years after 1669 as they had been earlier, at one point life-threateningly so.<br>
<br>By the late 1670s Pepys's prominence in the administration of the navy had become such as to make him a target for opponents of Charles II's government, and on 22 May 1679, against the background of the growing anti-Catholic hysteria generated by the Popish Plot, he was arrested and committed to the Tower, accused of selling naval secrets to the French. In their efforts to build a case against Pepys his antagonists had the assistance of his former <span class="occ">butler</span>, <a name="cosubject_96292"></a><span class="headword">John James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1680), who had recently been dismissed after being caught in bed with the housekeeper. James now wanted vengeance. Once more Pepys had to admit to being unfortunate in his servants, but now he had to do so publicly, in the House of Commons, where his foes mocked his domestic difficulties. And there was worse to come, for James, having visited Holland and made plans to go to Spain, was persuaded instead to provide his former master's enemies with lurid stories of popish practices in York Buildings, and fed damaging material to whig pamphleteers, who worked it up into highly effective pamphlets purporting to expose corruption at the heart of government. But the religious feelings that lay at the heart of the political crisis now came to Pepys's rescue. By January 1680 James was a sick man. Increasingly fearful for the state of his soul, he approached Pepys and offered to make a retraction. Eventually, on 2 March, he made a formal statement admitting that he had lied, and although he then came under severe pressure to stick to his original fabrications, he held his ground until he succumbed to tuberculosis on the 20th.<br>
<br>A significant figure in James's allegations against Pepys was the <span class="occ">musician</span> <a name="cosubject_96293"></a><span class="headword">Cesare Morelli</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1673&#150;1687), who had actually surprised the butler <i>in flagrante</i>. His presence in Pepys's household provides further evidence for the latter's wealth and prosperity in the 1670s, as well as for his abiding passion for music. A native of Flanders but trained in Rome, Morelli spoke several languages, but was initially recommended to Pepys in April 1673 primarily as one &#145;who has a most admirable voice, and sings rarely to his theorbo, and that with great skill&#146;, prompting Pepys to offer him &pound;30 per annum, for which he expected to &#145;find in him a servant not of less real use by his languages, in reading, writing, translating, or other offices depending thereon, than satisfaction to myself in his excellent qualifications in music, in which my utmost luxury still lies, and is likely to remain so&#146;  (Tanner, 222&#150;3). He came to England in the spring of 1675, and though he appears to have undertaken some private music-teaching, became a member of Pepys's household. When Samuel's second brother John died in 1677 Morelli composed a lament, which he and Pepys sang together, and he also made copies or arrangements of other people's music. But though he provided a civilized embellishment to Pepys's life, in the late 1670s Morelli was also a dangerous one, for he was brought up and remained a Catholic, making his association with Pepys the source of potentially lethal ammunition for someone like John James, who wanted to avenge himself on both men, and did not scruple to claim that they had said mass together. Efforts to persuade Morelli to convert to protestantism failed, and he moved to Brentwood, pursued by allegations that he was a Jesuit. Pepys remained in touch with him&#151;in 1681 Morelli sent him some opera transcriptions and a cure for fever&#151;and continued to pay his salary, but Morelli did not return to London, and probably in 1682 he went abroad. In 1686 he wrote to Pepys asking for help in securing a position in James II's chapel, but nothing came of this, and the marriage to which he made apologetic reference in a letter of the following February probably helped to ensure that he stayed on the continent thereafter.<br>
<br>None of his other employees brought such perils on Pepys as did James and Morelli. But although his domestic life was relatively quiet after the crisis of 1679&#150;80 it was not always free of inconveniences, which sometimes appeared in a familiar guise. In 1689 he wrote to John Evelyn concerning his housekeeper Jane Fane (whom Evelyn had probably found for him). Pepys acknowledged her many good qualities, but added that &#145;with all these excellences she hath a height of spirit, captiousness of humour, and bitterness and noise of tongue, that of all womankind I have hitherto had to do withal, do render her conversation and comportment as a servant most insupportable&#146;  (Tanner, 273&#150;4). His words convey a distinct echo of the earlier diarist's hopes for a quiet life at home, and of his regrets when these went unfulfilled. In 1689 Pepys dismissed Mrs Fane, but he was subsequently persuaded to re-engage her, and in 1703 she appeared among the servants remembered in Pepys's will. Perhaps one reason for the tranquillity of his latter years was his ability now to temper his expectations of his domestics to a realistic understanding of their likely frailties and an appropriate gratitude for the services they rendered.<br>
