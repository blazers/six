<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Nichols,  Mary Sergeant Gove</span>  (1810&#150;1884), <span class="occ">campaigner for medical reform and women's rights</span>, was born at Goffstown, New Hampshire, USA, on 10 August 1810, the second daughter and third child of William A. Neal (<i>d</i>. 1845) and Rebecca R. Neal. Her paternal grandfather was Scottish, while her mother's family were Welsh. Mary Neal was largely self-educated; her voracious reading was influenced by her father's interests as a radical democrat and her mother's universalist sympathies; she reputedly memorized classical and medical authors from an early age. On 5 March 1831 Mary Neal married Hiram Gove. His surly and domineering character, combined with four stillbirths and her need for outside intellectual interests, brought the relationship to an end in 1842.<br>
<br>Mrs Gove then embarked upon a lively social and intellectual life. Jacksonian democracy, antipathetic towards &eacute;lites, privilege, monopoly, or restrictions on knowledge, proved a favourable climate for independent-minded women: popular education was expanding; Sylvester Graham was publicizing his theories on diet, health, and sex; Fanny Wright was endorsing &#145;free love&#146;; Dr William A. Alcott was expounding communitarian ideas; and enthusiastic religion was beginning to overtake staid orthodoxy. Mrs Gove started school teaching with boarders and lecturing to women on the lyceum circuit. Already unorthodox in reading medical materials, her interest in the subject was intensified by her own persistent ill health and her unhappy marriage, several family deaths, and her brother's career as a doctor. She began giving physiology lectures to Boston ladies in 1838: her runaway success led to tours of New England, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Ohio, and she became the first woman in America to speak in public on the subject of contraception. She also edited the Worcester <span class="italic">Health Journal and Advocate of Physiological Reform</span> from 1840. Here she reflected on the inadequacy of medical training and trained doctors for women, and also criticized over-dependence on drugs, bloodletting, constricting garments, and excessive childbearing. Her advocacy of women's property rights and freedom of expression sharpened as a result of her acrimonious divorce and her lengthy battle for custody of her child and her income. She wrote numerous articles, often anonymous because of her sex, advocating healthy, wholesome diet, fresh air, and abstinence from stimulating drinks.<br>
<br>In 1842&#150;3 Mrs Gove fell in love with an English teacher, Henry G. Wright, from James Pierrepoint Greaves's Ham House, near London. He introduced her to European hydrotherapy, and in her enthusiasm she launched the <span class="italic">Health Journal and Independent</span>, which lasted only one issue. In spite of this disappointment she studied techniques in a new water-cure centre in Brattleboro, Vermont, for several months in 1845 and then worked as a resident physician in a water-cure house in Lebanon, New York, before opening her own establishment in New York in May 1846. Women could neither train nor qualify as doctors, but she graduated from being a teacher to acting as a physician. She enjoyed great success as a pioneering woman treating her sisters and became an advocate of natural childbirth.<br>
<br>Mrs Gove campaigned both through practical example and through the press in the late 1840s. She contributed to <span class="italic">Godey's Lady's Book</span>, the <span class="italic">Democratic Review</span>, and the <span class="italic">Water-Cure Journal</span>, described her work in <span class="italic">Experience in Water-Cure</span> (1849), and wrote three novels, <span class="italic">Uncle John</span> (1846), <span class="italic">Agnes Morris</span> (1849), and <span class="italic">The Two Loves: Eros and Anteros</span> (1849). She continued her lectures on dress reform and economic independence, and her house became a centre of like-minded radicals like Albert Brisbane, the Fourierist, and Edgar Allan Poe. Amid these activities she met and eventually married, in a Swedenborgian ceremony on 29 July 1848, <a name="cosubject_58354"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Low Nichols</span>  (1815&#150;1901)<span class="occ"></span>.<br>
<br>Nichols, born in Orford, New Hampshire, USA, had studied medicine at Dartmouth before embarking on a career as a radical democratic journalist. On one occasion a libel suit got him several months in gaol in Buffalo. He had worked in William Lloyd Garrison's abolitionist office in Boston, in Lowell, and in New York before qualifying as a doctor. By 1850 Thomas Low Nichols had become a vice-president of the American Vegetarian Society, acted as secretary of the American Hygienic and Hydropathic Association, and appointed himself permanent secretary of the Society of Public Health. In 1851 the newly wedded couple set up their American Hydropathic Institute, the first water-cure medical school: students secured diplomas following a successful three-months' training course. In 1852 they moved to West Chester, New York, where they offered summer courses in water-cure techniques. The following year, under T. L. Nichols's name, they published the sensational best-seller, <span class="italic">Esoteric Anthropology</span> (1853): to Victorian America it was sexually explicit. Finding themselves too advanced for other reformers the Nicholses began their own <span class="italic">Journal of Health, Water-Cure and Human Progress</span> in 1853. The following year Mary attacked oppressive marriage bonds in her thinly disguised autobiographical novel, <span class="italic">Mary Lyndon</span> (1854). The Nicholses vigorously campaigned for the water-cure as the basic reform, a prelude to the regeneration of mankind. These developments coincided with their movement towards communitarianism: under the influence of Fourier, the Nicholses decided to found a school with the American anarchists Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews in the Modern Times Colony, Long Island. Delays and sensational publicity intervened and the experiment foundered.<br>
<br>The contemporary spiritualist craze now attracted Mary Nichols, who soon became a medium. In 1855 the Nicholses moved west to Cincinnati and established their Progressive Union in Yellow Springs, Ohio. A vegetarian water-cure community, it collapsed in 1857 when, following apparitions of St Ignatius of Loyola, the Nicholses and eight others became Roman Catholics. Self-denial, chastity, and Catholic community proved irresistible: the church provided an eternal medium of health education. The Nicholses travelled extensively through the mid-west, the south, and Texas preaching their gospel of health to priests and nuns. After returning to New York in 1861 they fled to Britain to avoid the American Civil War.<br>
<br>Welcomed to London by Cardinal Wiseman, the Nicholses embarked on a health campaign in Ireland. After establishing their literary credentials with the Howitts, Edmund Yates, Dickens, Robert Chambers, J. Garth Wilkinson, and others, they thrived. Mary Nichols was soon writing for periodicals&#151;<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>,<span class="italic">Temple Bar</span>, <span class="italic">Fraser's</span>, <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span>&#151;as well as producing two more novels, <span class="italic">Uncle Angus</span> (1864) and <span class="italic">Jerry</span> (1872). Thomas wrote a best-selling autobiography, <span class="italic">Forty Years of American Life</span> (1864), and numerous articles for <span class="italic">Chambers's Encyclopaedia</span>. A brief sojourn in Crosshill, Glasgow, during which they published the <span class="italic">Journal of Sanitary and Social Science</span> (1873), proved less successful. In the hydropathic boom they began a &#145;school of life&#146; at their new water-cure centre, Aldwyn Towers, in Malvern, in 1867. There they practised medicine (Mrs Nichols claiming to have healing powers) and spiritualism, produced their <span class="italic">Herald of Health</span> (1875), and made provision for the first mass in Malvern since the Reformation. Archbishop John McCloskey of New York and Cardinal Manning were visitors. The Nicholses eventually settled in Earls Court, London, where they continued to hold seances and to busy themselves in social reforms; they campaigned against capital punishment and military conscription, and ran anti-vaccination and anti-vivisection campaigns.<br>
<br>In 1875 Thomas Low Nichols began his Co-operative Sanitary Company, which marketed health products including Turkish baths, soap powders, &#145;foods of health&#146;, cereals, egg preservers, Count Rumford soup, tonic drinks, and water filters. His pioneering firm preceded those of J. H. Kellogg, T. R. Allinson, and other health-food enthusiasts in Britain. He also inaugurated vegetarian restaurants in London, providing simple recipes for cheap, wholesome food, hygienically prepared and well cooked. In their writings and lectures to all sorts and conditions, he and his wife ceaselessly promoted vegetarianism, dress reform, the creation of garden suburbs, and temperance, co-operating with and visiting like-minded Europeans.<br>
<br>In later life Mary Nichols was blind for five years until Dr Charles Bell of Nottingham operated on her two cataracts. Unfortunately breast cancer and a fractured femur then curbed her activity and eventually led to her death on 30 May 1884 in Brompton, London. She was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. Age, financial pressures, the death of his wife, and the unfortunate publicity in the &#145;Pimlico case&#146; made Nichols surrender the editorship of the <span class="italic">Herald of Health</span>. He moved to Sutton, Surrey, from where he continued his pamphlet publishing, and died quietly and forgotten at Chaumont-en-Vezin, in France, in 1901. Their one daughter died young.<br>
<br>The Nicholses were important transatlantic links in radical feminist, medical, and religious movements of the nineteenth century. They were propagandists of the platform, printed word, and varied, if ultimately unsuccessful, practical enterprises. Promoting health education, natural birth control, and social improvement, they were at once backward-looking and progressive: they sought a reinvigorated version of the older, simpler, puritanical, and close-knit New England communal lifestyle. Self-denial and self-restraint for the common good formed a providential code which was guaranteed, for the Nicholses, through spiritualism and, ultimately, the Catholic church. Wholesome education, food, and social and sexual relations were essential: only then could man be liberated from the &#145;artificial&#146; oppression of law or economic interests, and physical or spiritual contaminants. They believed that simplicity would allow the masses to look after themselves: complexity was invariably a creation of self-interested groups for their own ends. A healthy environment, pure foodstuffs, and basic necessities for all within a readily accountable democratic social order of mutual interests was their ideal.<br>
