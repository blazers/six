<span class="headword">Crowe, Sir  Eyre Alexander Barby Wichart</span>  (1864&#150;1925), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 30 July 1864 at Leipzig, the third of the seven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6824/', "Sir Joseph Archer Crowe (1825&#150;1896)")</script>, diplomatist and art historian, and his wife, Asta von Barby (1840&#150;1908), daughter of Gustav von Barby and Eveline von Ribbentrop, and stepdaughter of Otto von Holtzendorff, attorney-general to Duke Ernst II of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. He received his education at <i>Gymnasien</i> in D&uuml;sseldorf (1872&#150;80) and Berlin (1880&#150;82), and subsequently attended courses at both King's College and University College, London (1882&#150;5). He never took a degree, as his ambition from an early age was to obtain a place in the Foreign Office. He concentrated on preparing for the entrance examination and became fluent in French as well as English and German. He was appointed a junior clerk in May 1885.<br>
<br>Crowe's initial tasks in the Foreign Office were purely clerical and gave him little opportunity to take independent action or even to offer advice. Nevertheless he quickly made a reputation for himself by his efficiency and devotion to duty, so that by the mid-1890s he had been marked out for eventual promotion to the highest ranks. From 1885 to 1897 he lived in the Foreign Office as a resident clerk and devoted much of his spare time to a study of British diplomacy during the nineteenth century. During these years he developed firm views on the aims that he believed British foreign policy should pursue and which he thought recent governments had neglected. He became convinced that Britain should be more assertive in order to maintain her command of the sea, and should use her sea-power to preserve a balance of power in Europe. In his view, Britain should always be the guardian of the independence of other nations as well as her own, opposed to the domination of any one state. With no opportunity to influence the formulation of policy, Crowe found ways of bringing these opinions to a wider public. He collaborated with his brother-in-law, the journalist and military historian Henry Spencer Wilkinson, on the writing of <span class="italic">The Great Alternative</span>, published under Spencer Wilkinson's name in 1894, and he contributed a chapter to a <span class="italic">Memoir of Hubert Hervey</span> (ed. Earl Grey, 1899), a close friend recently killed in Africa. Crowe's chapter contained his own political views, which he had shared with Hervey. On 2 February 1903 he married his cousin Clema (<i>b</i>. 1869), daughter of Professor Carl Gerhardt, of Gamburg, Baden, and widow of Eberhardt von Bonin. They had four children, Asta (<i>b</i>. 1904), Eric (<i>b</i>. 1905), Una (<i>b</i>. 1906), and Sibyl (<i>b</i>. 1908).<br>
<br>Crowe was a strong critic of the organization of the Foreign Office, feeling that the talents of even its most senior members were wasted on purely clerical tasks, and that the foreign secretary was consequently deprived of the well-informed advice that he needed. The turning point in Crowe's career came in December 1904, when he was asked to supervise a major reorganization of the Foreign Office along the lines that he had been advocating. He quickly revealed exceptional powers of organization and negotiation. He elaborated a completely new scheme and persuaded the Treasury to accept the additional costs involved. By the end of 1905 he had arranged all the details and produced lengthy instructions on how his system should be operated. The reorganization involved the devolution of the clerical work of the Foreign Office to second division clerks, leaving the first division clerks and the under-secretaries free to devote themselves to advising the secretary of state. To make this possible there was a new system of registering and keeping papers in &#145;jackets&#146;, on which minutes could be written. The new system came into operation in January 1906, shortly after Sir Edward Grey became secretary of state.<br>
<br>Crowe was able to take full advantage of the new system, because its introduction coincided with his promotion by seniority to the rank of senior clerk. He was placed in charge of the western department of the Foreign Office, which dealt with Germany and the other states of western Europe. He quickly became very influential in the formulation and execution of Grey's foreign policy. His years as head of the western department coincided with a deterioration in Anglo-German relations, which he personally very much regretted. He advised Grey during the important negotiations for a possible Anglo-German naval and political agreement (1908&#150;12) and during the Agadir crisis of 1911. He was guided by his belief, expressed at first tentatively in his famous &#145;Memorandum on the present state of British relations with France and Germany&#146; of January 1907, but then much more positively in later minutes, that the German government was consciously aiming at a general political hegemony in Europe. He argued forcefully that Britain should act firmly to maintain the balance of power and to prevent any erosion of her maritime supremacy.<br>
<br>In January 1912 Crowe was promoted to be an assistant under-secretary, but continued to be responsible for the western department. Then, in September 1913, he was made responsible for both the western and the eastern departments, to co-ordinate British foreign policy throughout Europe and the Middle East. He was convinced that Germany was preparing for a war against the entente powers and that it was therefore essential to maintain the fragile triple entente. He urged on Grey that the preservation of the increasingly unpopular entente with Russia would only be possible if the British government was very firm with the Russians over imperial disputes, particularly in Persia.<br>
<br>When the final crisis came in July 1914, Crowe had absolutely no doubt that it was in the interests of Britain herself, and of the independence of Europe as a whole, that the government should enter the war on the side of France and Russia. For Crowe himself, half-German, educated in Germany, strongly Germanophile, and with a German wife, the outbreak of the First World War was a personal tragedy. The war also had a profound impact on Crowe's career. Grey had decided that the permanent under-secretary should be transferred to the Paris embassy in the autumn of 1914, so that Crowe could be promoted in his place. At the age of only fifty, this would have placed him at the head of the Foreign Office for the final fifteen years of his career. In the event his promotion was delayed by six years, and very nearly prevented, when all diplomatic transfers were postponed for the duration of hostilities.<br>
<br>From 1914 to 1918 Crowe's main task was the organization of the blockade of Germany, a task for which he was particularly well qualified. As head of the western department he had made a special study of these questions and had played a very important role in the negotiations concerning the implementation of the declaration of London (1909), intended as a codification of international law in regard to maritime warfare. He created a new contraband department in the Foreign Office, which soon became larger than the rest of the office combined. In 1916 it became the nucleus of a new ministry of blockade, with Lord Robert Cecil, the parliamentary under-secretary at the Foreign Office, as the cabinet minister in charge. In recognition of his outstanding contribution to the war effort Crowe was given the rank of permanent under-secretary in the ministry of blockade in April 1917. However, his role as director of the blockade brought his name to the attention of the general public, and he suffered from the wave of Germanophobia which swept the country. Critics of the government's blockade policy, notably Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst and other suffragettes, called attention to Crowe's German connections, alleged that he was secretly allowing the blockade to be undermined, blamed him for every failure in the war, and demanded his dismissal. Crowe was subjected to a sustained public attack, which lasted from the summer of 1915 until the end of the war. He was defended in parliament by both Grey and Cecil, but his promotion to be head of the Foreign Office was called into question. When the permanent under-secretary, Sir Arthur Nicolson, retired in June 1916 he was replaced not by Crowe, but by Lord Hardinge of Penshurst.<br>
<br>In January 1919 Crowe went to Paris as part of the British delegation to the peace conference. He quickly emerged as the most influential member of the Foreign Office team, and played a central role in the territorial negotiations leading to the five peace treaties. In September 1919, when only the German and Austrian treaties had been signed, he was given the vitally important position of British representative on the supreme council of the peace conference, which was chaired by Clemenceau, the French prime minister. Crowe and Clemenceau developed a personal friendship, and partly for this reason Crowe dominated the proceedings of the council until the German treaty was ratified and the peace conference came to an end in January 1920. Lord Curzon, the new foreign secretary, was amazed by Crowe's powers of negotiation and his profound knowledge of the issues involved. When Hardinge left the Foreign Office in November 1920, Curzon insisted that Crowe should be promoted permanent under-secretary.<br>
<br>Crowe remained head of the Foreign Office, serving under three foreign secretaries (Lord Curzon, Ramsay MacDonald, and Sir Austen Chamberlain), for the next four and a half years. He was keen that a balance of power should be restored in Europe, and that Germany should not be permanently weakened or crippled by excessive reparations. Vital to this balance was close co-operation between Britain and France, the only two powers capable of guaranteeing peace and stability in Europe after the war. Crowe advised Curzon that the only way to persuade France to co-operate with Britain and soften her attitude towards Germany was to offer a guarantee of her security on the Rhine against any future German attack. As Anglo-French relations deteriorated during 1921&#150;2 he continued to advocate this policy, but failed to convince either Curzon or Lloyd George. When the French and Belgians occupied the Ruhr in 1923 he argued that the occupation was illegal under the terms of the treaty of Versailles and that the repressive policy towards Germany was having disastrous consequences which threatened international peace. He drafted the note in which the government publicly condemned the Franco-Belgian action, and then played a major part in the negotiations which culminated in the Dawes plan of 1924. Before he died he had finally persuaded the new Conservative government to accept his proposal for a security pact with France. He formulated and drafted the guarantee of Germany's western frontiers which was later included in the Locarno pact. He exercised a dominant influence over Austen Chamberlain, with whom he developed a very close friendship. He was also an important influence on the foreign policy of Ramsay MacDonald. In October 1924, when he authorized the publication of the Zinoviev letter, he was distressed to discover that the prime minister had not intended the letter to be published. Nevertheless responsibility for the mistake lay with MacDonald, who had failed to make his intentions clear.<br>
<br>Crowe was over 6 feet tall, with blue eyes, a fair complexion, and thick, wavy, red hair. He suffered throughout his life from poor health, mainly the result of weak kidneys, made worse by constant overwork. He nearly died of kidney failure at the beginning of 1920 and continued working against medical advice. He was an exceptionally cultivated man, read very widely throughout his life, and had a great love of music. As a young man he played the piano to a high standard and composed both songs and piano pieces. His setting of Shelley's &#145;Arethusa&#146; was published in 1889. His interest in military defence led him to serve as an officer in the first volunteer battalion, City of London fusiliers, from 1890 to 1902, reaching the rank of captain in 1894. His powers of argument were revealed in February 1911 when he won a spectacular forensic victory in the Savarkar arbitration case at The Hague, for which he was appointed KCMG. He was made KCB in June 1917 and advanced to GCMG in January 1920. He died of kidney failure while still in office, on 28 April 1925, in Swanage, Dorset. He was buried on 1 May in nearby Studland.<br>
<br>Crowe was a great administrator and a master of Foreign Office procedure, whom Baldwin referred to, on hearing of his death, as &#145;the ablest public servant of the Crown&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Public perception of his views has changed during the twentieth century. Attacked during the war as a pro-German traitor, he was later denounced by many as a rabid Germanophobe after the publication of <span class="italic">British Documents on the Origins of the War, 1898&#150;1914</span> (1926&#150;38). His memorandum of January 1907, published in 1928, had a wide popular appeal and aroused great interest in the academic world as a set text for generations of students of international relations.<br>
