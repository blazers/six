<span class="headword">Sutton,  Denys Miller</span>  (1917&#150;1991), <span class="occ">art critic and journal editor</span>, was born on 10 August 1917 at Pyne House, 64 South Side, Clapham, London, the son of Edmund Miller Sutton, a jeweller's assistant, and Dulcie Laura Wheeler, an actress. He was educated at Uppingham School and Exeter College, Oxford, where he received a third class in English in 1939 and a BLitt. On 4 July 1940 he married Sonja Klibansky (<i>b</i>. 1915/16); they later had a daughter. In the same year he joined the Foreign Office research department, where he worked for five years, and in 1945 he served as secretary of the international commission for the restitution of cultural material. In the following year, he published an anthology, <span class="italic">Watteau's Les charmes de la vie</span>, and his first biography, <span class="italic">Matisse</span>. In 1948 he published <span class="italic">Picasso, Blue and Pink Periods</span> and became a fine arts specialist at UNESCO, resigning after a year because of political interference. The following year was spent enjoyably as a visiting lecturer at Yale University, with publications on <span class="italic">French Drawings of the 18th Century</span> and <span class="italic">American Painting</span>, followed by <span class="italic">Flemish Painting</span> in 1950. These were all popular treatments. After his first marriage was dissolved, he married Gertrud Koebke-Knudson in 1952; they had a son.<br>
<br>Sutton worked as an art critic for <span class="italic">Country Life</span> and the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, his articles for the latter being published as <span class="italic">Delights of a Dilettante</span> (1980); he was also a salesroom correspondent for the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>. He continued to write books, including <span class="italic">Artists in 17th Century Rome</span> with Denis Mahon (1955), and <span class="italic">Catalogue of the French, Spanish and German Schools in the Fitzwilliam Museum</span> with J. W. Goodison (1960), which were more academic works. His second marriage having ended in divorce, on 3 May 1960 he married his third and last wife Cynthia Leah Abrahams, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sassoon (<i>b</i>. 1925/6). Three impressive biographies followed: <span class="italic">Toulouse-Lautrec</span> in 1962 and <span class="italic">Titian</span> and <span class="italic">The Art of Whistler</span> in 1963.<br>
<br>Sutton became the editor of the arts magazine <span class="italic">Apollo</span> in March 1962 and remained in that position for a quarter of a century, renowned for his attention to detail and his encyclopaedic knowledge of his field. The magazine, founded in 1925, was thin and dullish, but Sutton immediately expanded it, made it more attractive, and widened its scope to cover a range of contemporary issues, from the destruction of the English country house to the possible threat of capital gains tax to works of art. This enthusiastic personal vision attracted many prominent art historians, including Kenneth Clark, Graham Reynolds, Peter Thornton, and Ralph Edwards. Sutton, himself a prolific and elegant writer, filled many issues virtually alone, turning out four numbers on &#145;aspects of British collecting&#146; and four on &#145;the world of Sacheverell Sitwell&#146;. Entire issues were also devoted to museums throughout the world and their collections, and many museums used these as guides before they produced their own. He also wrote another, more impressive book on Whistler (1966), edited the <span class="italic">Letters of Roger Fry</span> (1973), and published a biography of Sickert (1976).<br>
<br>In addition to his editing and writing, Sutton organized some twenty exhibitions, including those on Bonnard at the Royal Academy in 1966 and on France in the eighteenth century at the Royal Academy in 1968; for the latter he collected and catalogued, with Cynthia's help, more than 1000 works of art. Other impressive exhibitions under his direction were two in Columbus, Ohio: &#145;British Art&#146; in 1971 and &#145;Irish Art&#146; in 1974. He also organized seven exhibitions in Tokyo, including those on Constable (1985), Whistler (1987), and Sargent (1989).<br>
<br>Sutton was a dapper figure with a closely trimmed beard. He had a gregarious personality with strong opinions, an explosive temper (especially to those who did not meet his high standards), and a delightful sense of humour. Despite his busy schedule, he spent an inordinate amount of time telephoning friends and enjoying life, often at the theatre. He became wealthy and was an astute collector of art. His colleague Brinsley Ford recalled him rushing from the office to his daily swim at the Royal Automobile Club in Pall Mall before lunching at Wheeler's restaurant on three dozen oysters washed down with Muscadet or Sancerre. He also remembered Sutton for his eager pursuit of women, creating the office joke that this drove some of his secretaries to a local nursing home, nicknamed the Sutton sanatorium.<br>
<br>Sutton faced a crisis in his last years, after being stricken in 1975 with cancer of the throat. After an operation to remove his larynx he began the tenacious effort of learning to use breath control to create a whispering speech. He received exceptional support from Cynthia. Colleagues were awed by his optimism, courage, and energy in those dark days as he continued to produce his magazine for another twelve years. In 1985, two years after surrendering the reins, he was made a CBE, and a year later produced his last biography, <span class="italic">Degas: Man and Work</span> (1986). He died on 25 January 1991 at his home, 22 Chelsea Park Gardens, London. His wife survived him.<br>
