<span class="headword">Whiddon, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1576), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the eldest son of John Whiddon of Chagford, Devon, where his family had long been established. His mother, whose maiden name was Rugg, was also a native of Chagford. He was admitted to the Inner Temple, probably between 1510 and 1515, though his presence is not recorded before 1519, when he was fined for a moot-fail and was then put out of commons for misbehaviour. Already by 1520 he is mentioned as an attorney in the court of requests, and in the poll-tax assessment of 1523 he was reckoned to be worth &pound;40 in goods, the same as Thomas Audley and Nicholas Hare. He was elected autumn reader in 1528, but the reading was postponed until Lent 1529; it was well attended by future legal dignitaries, including Audley, Hare, and John Baldwin. From 1530 he was a justice of the peace for Devon.<br>
<br>Whiddon was twice married. His first wife was Anne, daughter of Sir William Hollis; they had a daughter. His second was Elizabeth, daughter and heir of William Shilston; they had a large family of six sons and seven daughters. Whiddon gave a second reading in 1536, and served as treasurer of his inn from 1538 to 1539. He was the most senior of the last general call of serjeants projected by Henry VIII; the writs abated on the demise of the crown, but Whiddon and the others were duly created in February 1547. In 1551, on the death of fellow Devonian John Harris, he was made one of the king's serjeants; and on 4 October 1553 he was appointed a justice of the queen's bench. In 1555 he became the secondary justice, and he was knighted the same year. He is reputed to have been the first judge to ride to Westminster Hall on a horse rather than a mule, as was the previous custom. His judicial appointment was renewed by Elizabeth I, and he remained in office until his death on 27 January 1576, which probably occurred at Chagford where he was buried and where there is a monumental inscription. His estates included several tin-workings in the Devon stannaries.<br>
