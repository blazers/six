<span class="headword">Oliver,  Daniel</span>  (1830&#150;1916), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born on 6 February 1830 at Newcastle upon Tyne, the first of the nine children of Daniel Oliver (1806&#150;1878), a grocer, and his wife, Ann (1804&#150;1878), daughter of Thomas and Ann Noble of Brockerby, near Carlisle. Since both his parents were members of the Society of Friends, Daniel attended the Friends' school at Wigton (1839&#150;44). Partly on account of shyness he did not flourish academically, but his early interest in natural history developed considerably and he played a leading role in a school society largely devoted to natural history. Returning to Newcastle in 1844 he worked in the family business but, finding this employment &#145;utterly distasteful&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Monitor</span>, 94), he paid increasing attention to natural history, publishing his first paper in <span class="italic">The Phytologist</span> in 1847. His enthusiasm for natural history was further encouraged by fellow members of the Tyneside Naturalists' Field Club, including John Hancock and Sir Walter Trevelyan, and by several local Quakers. In his early twenties he was elected to the Edinburgh Botanical Society (1851) and the Linnean Society (1853). He also joined the Askesian Society (founded 1853) at which a number of scientifically able young Quakers from the Newcastle area, including George Stewardson Brady, Henry Bowman Brady, Robert Calvert Clapham, and David Richardson, read and discussed scientific papers. For six years, beginning in the 1851&#150;2 session, Oliver lectured in botany at Durham medical school.<br>
<br>Oliver's career took a dramatic turn in 1858 when, after writing to Sir William Hooker about the possibility of joining a surveying expedition, he was invited to join the staff of the herbarium at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. In 1864 he was appointed keeper of the herbarium and library, a position he held until his retirement in 1890. During this period of over thirty years he worked tirelessly tending, studying, and classifying the botanical collections sent to Kew from all parts of the world. As one contemporary noted, &#145;Probably no one man ever knew so much as he of those aberrant types which puzzle the most experienced botanists&#146;  (Britten, 91). He published approximately fifty papers in scientific journals, mostly descriptions of new and interesting species that he curated at Kew. His main publications, which included the first three volumes of the <span class="italic">Flora of Tropical Africa</span> (8 vols., 1868&#150;1934) and the <span class="italic">First Book of Indian Botany</span> (1869), likewise contained an abundance of detailed botanical descriptions. He also wrote an official guide to the museum at Kew (1861) and a new and considerably extended edition of the <span class="italic">Guide to the Royal Botanic Gardens and Pleasure Grounds, Kew</span> (1868).<br>
<br>Soon after Oliver's arrival at Kew, Joseph Dalton Hooker, the assistant director, asked him to perform crossing experiments on Darwin's behalf. Darwin was clearly impressed by Oliver's abilities as an experimenter and by the wealth of information he possessed on botanical subjects. Soon they were both carrying out experiments on the physiological processes of the insectivorous plants such as <i>Drosera</i>, and regularly exchanging notes and specimens. When the chair of botany fell vacant at University College, London, Darwin strongly recommended Oliver for the post, praising &#145;the range of his knowledge of facts buried in all sorts of foreign publications&#146;, his &#145;philosophical caution&#146; as an experimenter, and the &#145;high philosophical order&#146; of his mind  (Darwin, 7.48). Oliver was appointed to the professorship in 1860, a position he held until his retirement in 1888.<br>
<br>Initially Oliver's main duty at University College was delivering annually a fifty-lecture course on general botany, principally to medical students. To enable him to spend much of the day at Kew, his class was scheduled during the summer months from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m., five days a week. In order to arrive in time, he arranged for the night-constable to rap at the window of his bedroom at 5 a.m. and an hour later a cab collected him from his home in Kew. Each lecture was illustrated by six specimens he brought with him and microscopes were used for demonstrations. Oliver's textbook, <span class="italic">Lessons in Elementary Botany</span> (1864), passed through many editions and is said to have sold some 70,000 copies. In 1880 the scope of botanical education at University College was extended with the opening of a botanical laboratory and the appointment of an assistant. From 1859 to 1874 Oliver also lectured to the staff at Kew and in the 1870s he delivered lectures for women at the South Kensington Museum.<br>
<br>Oliver was in close contact with most of the eminent botanists of his generation, including Darwin and Asa Gray, many of whom visited him at Kew. He was particularly close to John Gilbert Baker, a fellow Quaker, who was appointed his assistant at Kew in 1866 and became his near neighbour. When Oliver was elected to the Royal Society of London in 1863 his certificate was signed by Sir William Hooker, George Bentham, Charles Daubeny, George Busk, and three others. In 1884 Oliver received the society's royal medal for &#145;his Investigations in the Classification of Plants, and for the great services which he has rendered to Taxonomic Botany&#146;  (RS, council minutes, 6 November 1884). Other honours included the Linnean Society's gold medal (1892) and honorary degrees from the universities of Edinburgh and Aberdeen.<br>
<br>From 1861 Oliver was one of the editors of the newly constituted editorial board of the <span class="italic">Natural History Review</span> and compiled much bibliographical material for that journal. Like many systematists Oliver does not appear to have sided publicly either for or against Darwin's theory of evolution. One of his more sophisticated discussions was his informed criticism in 1862 of Oswald Heer's &#145;Atlantis hypothesis&#146; which postulated that Europe and America were joined during the Miocene epoch.<br>
<br>In 1861 Oliver married Hannah Hobson Wall (1833/4&#150;1919), daughter of James Wall of Sheffield. They had three surviving children, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35304/', "Francis Wall Oliver (1864&#150;1951)")</script> who succeeded his father at University College, becoming Quain professor of botany in 1890. Although Daniel Oliver had earlier been a rather strict Quaker, in his middle years he dispensed with the more rigid aspects of Quakerism, although always remaining true to its essential teachings. A man of broad cultural interests, following his retirement Oliver had time to read extensively, listen to music, and develop his artistic talents. He collected English watercolours, Pre-Raphaelite art, and botanical illustrations, counting several artists, Ruskin included, among his friends. Possessing a &#145;decidedly nervous temperament&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Monitor</span>, 95), possibly due to having suffered both a dog-bite and cholera during childhood, he had a tendency to retire from company. Oliver was not a charismatic lecturer and many contemporaries found him outwardly abrupt and somewhat forbidding. However, his many friends considered him an upright, modest man who was compassionate, companionable, well informed, and intellectually lively. He was blessed with good health which only deserted him during his short final illness. Following his death at his home, 10 Kew Gardens Road, on 21 December 1916, he was buried two days later in the burial-ground attached to Isleworth Friends' meeting-house.<br>
