<span class="headword">Farmer,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1651?, <em>d.</em> 1688), <span class="occ">violinist and composer</span>, seems to have come from a musical family. His father may have been the boy who was baptized on 26 November 1615 and apprenticed as musician on 20 November 1626 to Thomas Stevenson (and later Thomas Spencer) of the Drapers' Company, becoming a freeman in 1650. (Many music apprenticeships were arranged through such companies.) Farmer himself may perhaps be identified with the Thomas, son of Thomas and Mary Farmer, baptized at St Andrew's, Holborn, on 26 January 1651. Purcell's elegy &#145;on the death of Mr. Thomas Farmer&#146;&#151;&#145;Young Thirsis' fate ye hills and groves deplore&#146; (to words by Nahum Tate)&#151;suggests that the musician was a comparatively young man in 1688.<br>
<br>Farmer, who married a woman named Mary about 1670, comes to notice as a musician during the succeeding decade. At court he served as a violinist-extraordinary (without fee) from 1671 and was promoted to a paid place in the violin band at Michaelmas 1675 following the death of John Strong. At Michaelmas 1679 he gained a further place as violinist in the private musick, shared with Robert King. He received a MusB from Cambridge University in 1684.<br>
<br>Farmer was a house composer for the Duke's Theatre Company at Dorset Garden and wrote music for a number of plays: Edward Ravenscroft's <span class="italic">The Citizen Turned Gentleman</span> (July 1672), Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">The Cheats of Scapin</span> (December? 1676), Aphra Behn's <span class="italic">Sir Patient Fancy</span> (January 1678), Nahum Tate's <span class="italic">Brutus of Alba</span> (June? 1678), John Dryden's <span class="italic">Troilus and Cressida</span> (spring 1679), Nathaniel Lee's <span class="italic">Caesar Borgia</span> (May? 1679), Thomas D'Urfey's <span class="italic">The Virtuous Wife</span> (September 1679), Otway's <span class="italic">The Soldier's Fortune</span> (June? 1680), Lee's <span class="italic">The Princess of Cleve</span> (September? 1680), and Behn's <span class="italic">The Second Part of the Rover</span> (January 1681?); for the United Company, Drury Lane, he wrote music for Lee's <span class="italic">Constantine the Great</span> (November 1683). Virtually all his surviving work consists of songs and suites apparently compiled from his incidental music, although most cannot be associated with particular plays. It is described by modern scholars as competently written but dull and unenterprising.<br>
<br>At the accession of James II the court musical establishment was drastically reduced, but Farmer was reappointed. The warrant to swear him notes that he was &#145;at sea&#146;, showing that he had escaped alive from the wreck of the <i>Gloucester</i> on 6 May 1682. He served in the king's Catholic chapel (opened on Christmas day 1686). His <span class="italic">A Consort of Musick in Four Parts</span> was published in 1686 and advertised on 4 November as being available &#145;at his house in Martlet Court in Bowe street, Covent Garden&#146;. Farmer was buried at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 5 December 1688. He was survived by his wife.<br>
