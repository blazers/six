<span class="headword">Smith,  Abel</span>  (1788&#150;1859), <span class="occ">banker and politician</span>, was born on 7 July 1788, probably in Nottinghamshire, the eldest son of Samuel Smith (1745&#150;1834), banker and politician, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1835), daughter of Edmund Turnor, of Stoke Rochford and Panton Hall, Lincolnshire. Smith was one of four brothers; he also had nine sisters. In 1801 Smith moved with his family from Nottinghamshire to Hertfordshire when his father purchased the estate of Woodhall Park at Watton, near Hertford. He was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>Born into one of England's great banking families, Smith was destined to become perhaps the most respected banker of his generation. In 1810 he became a partner in the London banking house of Smith, Payne and Smith, which conducted business from no. 1 Lombard Street. In addition to this bank, founded in 1758, the Smith family also established banks at Nottingham (1658), Lincoln (1775), Hull (1784), and Derby (1806). In an era when the Bank of England held a monopoly of joint-stock banking, and private banks in both London and the provinces were predominantly single offices with no more than six partners, the interlocking partnerships forged by the Smiths were of especial significance. Smith became a partner in the Lincoln bank in 1829, though his interests and reputation were always closely tied to London.<br>
<br>Despite being a relative newcomer to London private banking, Smith, Payne and Smith weathered the financial storm of 1825&#150;6 (when eighty private banks failed in London and the country) better than most. In the following decades the bank went from strength to strength. The key role played by Smith was highlighted in a memoir in 1859, which noted that:<blockquote>during the last half century, the name of Abel Smith has been intimately associated with the banking business of London, and under his able management the house which his grandfather in connection with the late Mr. Payne, founded, attained to a position second to no private bank in the kingdom. No man, probably, in modern times has exercised a greater or a more deserved influence in financial circles than Mr. Smith. He was amongst the shrewdest and most far seeing of those who trade in money. (<span class="italic">Bankers' Magazine</span>, 205)</blockquote>Smith's experience of financial affairs was also widely recognized at Westminster, where he was a member of parliament for the boroughs of Midhurst and Wendover and, between 1835 and 1847, the county of Hertfordshire. A nephew of the first Lord Carrington, Smith was in politics a consistent conservative, voting against the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> in 1832. Though not a natural orator, he carried considerable authority when speaking with his customary brevity on the financial matters of the day. Together with Sir Robert Peel and George Grote, he was a member of the Commons select committee whose inquiry into banking led to the <span class="roman">Bank Charter Act</span> of 1844, which sought to stabilize the currency by fixing the volume of bank notes in circulation.<br>
<br>On 28 August 1822, Smith married his first wife, Lady Marianne Melville, daughter of the ninth earl of Leven and Melville. The marriage, which was childless, ended with her death on 22 March 1823. He married his second wife, Frances Anne (<i>d</i>. 1885), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4422/', "General Sir Harry Calvert")</script>, of Claydon Hall, Buckinghamshire, on 12 July 1826. They had four sons and six daughters. Following the death of his father in 1834, Smith inherited the family seat of Woodhall Park and devoted increasing amounts of time to the management of the estate. A JP for Hertfordshire, he maintained a strong interest in improving the social fabric of the locality, particularly through the endowment of livings and provision for the building and renovation of churches in the surrounding rural parishes. However, despite his many duties as a resident landlord, Smith continued to take an active role in the management of the London banking house until his death.<br>
<br>Smith died at Woodhall Park, Watton, Hertfordshire, on 23 February 1859. An obituary in the <span class="italic">Hertford Mercury</span> (26 February 1859) noted that &#145;as a landlord he was just and liberal; and as a resident among a population born and employed upon the land, he was not unminded of the obligation imposed upon the rich, of wisely and judiciously helping the poor&#146;. He was buried at Watton, Hertfordshire, on 2 March 1859. Smith died a man of immense wealth, with land and property in no fewer than eight counties, together with his property and banking interests in London and Lincoln. The entailed estate of Woodhall Park descended to his eldest son, Abel Smith (1829&#150;1898), while his shares in the banking establishments passed to his second son, Robert Smith (1833&#150;1894). Remaining property was divided variously between his four sons, with cash legacies granted to his daughters.<br>
