<span class="headword">Pelham,  George</span>  (1766&#150;1827), <span class="occ">bishop of Lincoln</span>, born on 13 October 1766, was the third son and seventh and youngest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21798/', "Thomas Pelham, first earl of Chichester (1728&#150;1805)")</script>, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Frankland (1734/5&#150;1813). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21791/', "Henry Thomas Pelham, third earl of Chichester (1804&#150;1886)")</script> was his nephew. He was at first in the English army, holding a commission in the guards, but soon changed his vocation to the church. After he had been trained by James Hurdis at the family seat of Stanmer, near Lewes, he was sent to Cambridge, matriculating from Clare College in 1784 and graduating MA in 1787. On 14 December 1792 he married Mary, third daughter of the Revd Sir Richard Nelson Rycroft (<i>d</i>. 1786) and his wife, Penelope, daughter of the Revd Richard Stonehewer. They had no children.<br>
<br>As the younger son of a leading whig family, Pelham was quickly promoted, and his political connections gratified a lust for lucrative office which quickly became notorious. He was ordained deacon and priest in 1789, and on 28 October 1790, when he was only twenty-four, was installed as prebendary of Middleton and canon residentiary in Chichester Cathedral; he held that preferment until his death. From 1790 to 1800 he was vicar of Laughton, Sussex. In 1792 the vicarage of Bexhill in Sussex was given to him by the bishop of the diocese; in 1800 he was appointed by his family to the vicarage of Hellingly. Both of these he also held until his death. From 17 November 1797 to 1803 he was prebendary of the eleventh stall at Winchester. Hurdis, who acknowledged many good qualities in his pupil, wrote to William Cowper, the poet, that young Pelham had &#145;just turned of five and twenty, and is already in possession of two livings&#146;  (Hurdis, xi).<br>
<br>Pelham was consecrated bishop of Bristol on 27 March 1803 in the chapel at Lambeth Palace, and at the same time received from the archbishop of Canterbury the degree of DCL. When the see of Norwich became vacant, he wrote (8 February 1805) from his house in Welbeck Street, London, to William Pitt, stating that he had heard &#145;from so many quarters&#146; of his nomination for that bishopric, that he could &#145;no longer refrain expressing his gratitude&#146;, as it would be &#145;a lasting obligation&#146;. A dry answer was immediately sent back by Pitt, that the report &#145;had arisen without his knowledge, and that he could not have the satisfaction of promoting his wishes&#146;  (P. H. Stanhope, <span class="italic">Life of &hellip; William Pitt</span>, 1861&#150;2, 4.253&#150;4). This was almost Pelham's only failure. In 1807 he was transferred to the diocese of Exeter, being installed on 28 September 1807, and holding with it the archdeaconry of Exeter and the treasurership of the cathedral, to which was annexed a residential stall. His desire for further preferment was realized in October 1820, when he was made bishop of Lincoln. Pelham was also clerk of the closet to the king. When raised to the episcopal bench he nearly went down on his knees to George III to be allowed to dispense with wearing his wig, but the king was unrelenting  (A. Hayward, <span class="italic">Biographical and Critical Essays</span>, 2, 1873, 40). He was a friend of the prince regent and a regular diner and party-goer at the Brighton Pavilion in 1818.<br>
<br>Pelham was the author of two sermons and a charge. He is described as urbane in his manners, punctual in the discharge of business, and impartial in the distribution of patronage. He became a byword for much that was wrong with the established church of his day. However, when he confirmed the young W. E. Gladstone at Eton on 1 February 1827, the latter noted: &#145;Bishop not dignified in appearance&#151;but went through the service apparently with great feeling and piety&#146;  (Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 1 Feb 1827). Pelham had, on 19 January 1827, caught a cold at the duke of York's funeral. He died of pleurisy at Connaught Place, London, on 7 February 1827 and was buried in the family vaults at Laughton in Sussex on 15 February. Mary Pelham's poor health was, fancifully, given by her husband as a reason why he should be preferred. She was said to be haughty in style, and in the palace at Exeter never rose from her seat to receive visitors. She died on 30 March 1837.<br>
