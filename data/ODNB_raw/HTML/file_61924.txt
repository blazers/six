<span class="headword">Chapman,  (Arthur) Percy Frank</span>  (1900&#150;1961), <span class="occ">cricketer</span>, was born at 21 Addington Road, Reading, on 3 September 1900, the son of Frank Emerson Chapman (<i>d</i>. 1941), headmaster of a preparatory school, Fritham House School, Lyndhurst, Hampshire, and his wife, Bertha Finch. He was educated at his father's school, at Oakham School (1910&#150;14), and at Uppingham School (1914&#150;19), where he was in the first eleven. He went up to Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1919. There he won three cricket blues (1920&#150;22), and made 118 against Essex on his d&eacute;but for the university. In his last year at Cambridge he scored 102 not out against Oxford University, and was selected at the end of the 1922 season for Archie MacLaren's MCC winter tour of Australia and New Zealand.<br>
<br>On his return from Australia in 1923 Chapman joined H. and G. Simonds of Hythe to learn the brewing business and, ultimately, to qualify for Kent. In the meantime he played for Berkshire in minor counties' cricket. Though he made a few appearances for Kent in 1924, it was while still a recognized Berkshire player that he was selected for the MCC tour of Australia, one of the few players to play for England while participating at that level of the game. He had a moderately successful test match series under Arthur Gilligan's captaincy, but Australia retained the Ashes. At the end of the tour, early in 1925, he married in Okawa, New Zealand, G. H. H. (Beety) Lowry, sister of his Cambridge contemporary the New Zealand cricketer Thomas Coleman Lowry, and daughter of T. H. Lowry, a farmer and racehorse owner. In the following season he qualified to play for Kent in the county championship; he subsequently represented the county as an amateur until his retirement in 1938, captaining the side from 1931 to 1936.<br>
<br>Chapman took over the captaincy of England, the youngest to hold the position in test history, for the last and, it transpired, decisive test match against Australia at the Oval in August 1926. England won and regained the Ashes; Chapman received a telegram of congratulation from the prime minister, Stanley Baldwin. As a captain he was sometimes criticized for his lack of subtlety and for not being a great tactician, but his record bears favourable comparison with those of his predecessors and successors. He captained England seventeen times, winning nine matches and losing only two. In the 1928&#150;9 tour of Australia, when England won the test series 4&#150;1 to retain the Ashes, his standing was as high as any captain's before or since. That tour was a notably happy one, on and off the field.<br>
<br>A superb cutter and driver, who enjoyed lofting the ball great distances into the deep field, Chapman could dominate a match by the sheer insolence of his left-handed batting, using power, intuition, and authority against the fiercest bowling attacks. When at the crease he customarily wore the Cambridge quidnunc cap of blue with vertical yellow stripes. During his first-class career he made 16,309 runs at an average of 31.97. An outstanding season for Kent in 1927, in which he averaged nearly 90, included an audacious 260 against Lancashire, the county champions, with thirty-seven boundaries, in three hours. He hit only one century for England, 121 against Australia at Lord's in 1930. That match involved the greatest players of the day and the finest performances in cricket. Despite his century, Chapman finished on the losing side, though he caught Bradman off a catch so magnificent&#151;even by his own standards&#151;that Sir James Barrie was moved to say to his companion Neville Cardus: &#145;What evidence is there that the ball is the same ball which left Bradman's bat?&#146;  (G. Howat, <span class="italic">Cricket's Second Golden Age</span>, 1989, 20). Chapman was surprisingly dropped for the fifth test that year, in which Australia regained the Ashes, when R. E. S. Wyatt replaced him as captain. In the winter of 1930&#150;31 he led MCC's side in South Africa. The South Africans won the rubber and this proved his last series as England captain and the end of his test match career.<br>
<br>Chapman helped restore confidence to English cricket in the 1920s, bringing to the game a natural greatness based on quick perception, technical assurance, and masterly judgement. Together with his charm and his tall, curly fair-haired good looks, he brought humour to a game in some danger of becoming &#145;narrow and parochial&#146;  (R. C. Robertson-Glasgow, <span class="italic">Crusoe on Cricket</span>, 1966, 143). His was a leadership which &#145;removed the chains of routine&#146;  (N. Cardus, <span class="italic">The Playfair Cardus</span>, 1963, 87); he was no dour disciplinarian, and he won or lost with good grace. He and his wife were society figures, but his taste for conviviality was his undoing. As alcohol claimed him, his figure, already tending to girth (he weighed 15 stone in 1930), became bloated and he went into a sad decline. His marriage was dissolved in 1942. After he retired he suffered from ill health brought on by his drink problem, and was eventually unable to watch the game at Canterbury or Lord's. Following a fracture incurred in a fall at his home, he died at Lord Mayor Treloar's Hospital, Alton, Hampshire, on 16 September 1961.<br>
