<span class="headword">Maitland, Sir  Peregrine</span>  (1777&#150;1854), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, was born at Longparish House, Hampshire, on 6 July 1777, the son of Thomas Maitland of Shrubs Hall, New Forest, and his wife, Jane, the daughter of General Edward Mathew of Felix Hall, Essex, and the granddaughter of Peregrine Bertie, second duke of Ancaster and Kesteven.<br>
<br>On 25 June 1792 Maitland was appointed ensign in the 1st foot-guards (Grenadier Guards). In this &eacute;lite regiment he served throughout the revolutionary and Napoleonic wars&#151;in Flanders in 1794, at Ostend in 1798, at Vigo and Corunna in 1809 (medal), at Walcheren, and at Cadiz. In 1803 he married for the first time. His bride, the Hon. Harriet Louisa Crofton, died in 1805. Maitland was second-in-command of the Grenadier Guards at Seville. After becoming their brevet colonel in 1812, he commanded them at the passage of the Bidassoa, at Nivelle, at the Nive in December 1813, and at Bayonne, Bidart, and the passage of the Adour. He was made a major-general in 1813. For his command of the 1st brigade of guards in 1815 at Quatre Bras and Waterloo and in the occupation of Paris he was created KCB. He crowned these achievements by his second marriage, at the duke of Wellington's headquarters in Paris, to Lady Sarah Lennox (<i>d</i>. 1873), the second daughter of the fourth duke of Richmond. His life by birth, marriage, and army experience had thus set in a groove of European military convention, tory piety, and an aristocratic detachment and superiority which would ill suit the rough-edged colonial societies and irregular warfare he would henceforth encounter as governor and army general in various parts of the empire.<br>
<br>When his father-in-law, Richmond, was appointed governor-in-chief of British North America, Maitland became lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada, on 3 June 1818. In appearance &#145;a tall, grave officer, always in military undress, his countenance ever wearing a mingled expression of sadness and benevolence&#146;  (Brode, 52), Maitland was content to retire frequently from the capital, York, to his beloved country residence of Stamford Park and leave much of the work of government to trusted subordinates such as the forceful attorney-general, J. B. Robinson. The latter headed a group of old loyalists who disapproved of the ultra-democratic tendencies represented by the &#145;reformer&#146; opposition of William Mackenzie, John Rolph, and others. Somewhat inaccurately labelled the &#145;family compact&#146;, Robinson's following fairly mirrored Maitland's own views on such controversial matters as alien naturalization and exclusive Anglican clergy reserves. Consequently, his decade of government in Upper Canada (1818&#150;28), while conservatively aligned, has been somewhat harshly seen as laying foundations for the subsequent uprising of 1837.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, Maitland was happier to take over the oligarchic system of Nova Scotia in October 1828. He moved on from there in 1834, and commanded the Madras army after October 1836 until his piety caused him to resign in late 1838, because the East India Company would not enforce the exemptions from compulsory native religious festivals granted to Christian Sepoys.<br>
<br>On 18 March 1844 Maitland became governor of the Cape of Good Hope. Here he made grave errors in severely modifying the treaty systems with frontier peoples and chiefdoms to the north-east and east of the colony. Both beyond the Orange and Great Fish rivers costly entanglements and hostilities followed. In particular, his new and arrogant version of Sir Andries Stockenstr&ouml;m's original eastern frontier treaties with the Ngqika Xhosa chiefs was biased towards imperial and colonial interests in that it imposed the main onus of maintaining the treaties on the paramount chief Sandile, his co-chiefs, and their hard-pressed people, but allowed intrusions of colonial patrols and posts into previously declared neutral territory. Overreacting to minor violations, Maitland was soon involved in transfrontier hostilities. In the Cape Frontier War of 1846&#150;7 the Xhosa enemy provided a major challenge in irregular bush-fighting, particularly in the form of attacks on wagon trains. On the whole this proved beyond the conventional military skills of the ageing governor&#151;who since 1846 had been a full general. Soon his critic, and the able architect of the original treaty system, Stockenstr&ouml;m, could point derisively to Maitland's &#145;ruined cavalry, crippled infantry, and disgusted border force&#146;  (Milton, 166). Although by attrition Maitland did eventually achieve stalemate on the frontier by the beginning of 1847, his recall and replacement by more ruthless and energetic men such as Sir Henry Pottinger and Sir Harry Smith were inevitable. Maitland had therefore helped to provoke a major frontier conflagration and had then failed to extinguish it adequately. From this d&eacute;b&acirc;cle his political and military reputation did not recover. On his retirement and return to England he did, however, become GCB in 1852. He died at his residence, Eaton Place West, London, on 30 May 1854. Lady Sarah Maitland died on 8 September 1873, and was survived by their three sons and three daughters.<br>
