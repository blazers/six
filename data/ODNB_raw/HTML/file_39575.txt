<span class="headword">McMahon, Sir  John</span>, first baronet  (<em>c.</em>1754&#150;1817), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in Ireland, the only son of John McMahon (<i>d</i>. 1789), butler to Robert Clements, first earl of Leitrim, and his first wife, who was a fellow servant. His father became comptroller of the port of Limerick and married in 1771 his second wife, Mary Stackpole, who was the daughter of James Stackpole, a merchant in Cork. They had two sons, William and Thomas, who both eventually became baronets thanks to their half-brother. McMahon's education was elementary: after three years in a Dublin school, he was allegedly a kitchen boy in Dublin at nine. As ensign in the 44th foot he went to North America in 1775, becoming barrack-master at Charles Town until 1782, then captain in the 48th foot. His military patron was Francis Rawdon, later second earl of Moira. On his return he married, about 1782, Elizabeth Ramsay (<i>d</i>. 1815) of Bath. Scandalmongers alleged that the duke of Clarence had admired her, but had been diverted by McMahon to Dorothy Jordan.<br>
<br>Outwardly unprepossessing, small, and pock-marked, McMahon made up for his appearance by obliging manners. Retiring on half pay in 1786, he joined the Whig Club and remained a member until 1792. In 1794 he served in Flanders, as lieutenant-colonel of the 87th foot, but returned home ill. Rather than serve in Ireland he left the army in 1796. Known as &#145;Colonel McMahon&#146; or &#145;Mac&#146;, he was useful to Moira as a political go-between with Fox in 1797, but he soon found a more significant role as public relations officer to the prince of Wales, who had deserted his wife. The prince made him his vice-treasurer in 1800, and a member of the duchy of Cornwall council in 1802. The duke of Northumberland bought him a seat in parliament, for which Moira provided his property qualification: he thus sat for Aldeburgh from 1802 to 1812. Late in 1803 he became secretary to the prince, keeper of his privy purse and seal, and duchy auditor. In the Commons he voted with the prince's friends, and when the whigs took office in 1806 became principal storekeeper of the ordnance for a year. Despite the prince's political neutrality he found no other office until February 1811, when he became unsalaried private secretary to the prince as regent.<br>
<br>In August the regent induced the premier to appoint McMahon paymaster of army widows' pensions, a sinecure ripe for abolition. Opposition motions against this were defeated on 9 January and 22 February 1812, when McMahon defended himself, but nevertheless he was voted out, on 23 February. In 1812 the regent provided for him in making him private secretary and keeper of the privy purse, with a privy councillorship granted on 20 March. He vacated Aldeburgh with hopes of another seat. The regent, however, resisted McMahon's attempts to reconcile him with the whigs. McMahon, overwhelmed by the task of countering adverse publicity for the regent, longed for retirement. His health was worsening and on 2 August 1815 his wife died, leaving him a considerable fortune in jewels. He had been receiver-general of the duchy for a year when, a disconsolate widower resorting to alcohol and opium, he resigned, obtaining a baronetcy on 7 August 1817. The regent avoided bidding him farewell in person but, through Sir William Knighton, McMahon's executor, secured McMahon's papers. Denied a British peerage, McMahon planned retirement to Falmouth, but died at Bath <i>en route</i>, on 12 September 1817. At his death he was worth &pound;90,000, and as he had no children his baronetcy passed to his younger half-brother, Colonel Thomas McMahon.<br>
