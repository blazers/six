<span class="headword">Davidson,  John  Morrison</span>  (1843&#150;1916), <span class="occ">radical and journalist</span>, was born in a roadside house in the parish of Old Deer, Aberdeenshire, the younger son of the unmarried Mary Warrender, farm labourer, and Thomas Davidson, farm labourer, of Hatton, Aberdeenshire. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40950/', "Thomas Davidson (1840&#150;1900)")</script> was his elder brother. He was sickly as a child and unable to walk to school until he was nine, when his education began at the parish school at Deer. He then went to the grammar school of Old Aberdeen. He won a Campbell bursary to Aberdeen University, at which he matriculated in 1860, attending the art class; he felt that he learned little, and he quarrelled with his professors. In 1863 he left the university without a degree and made an abortive attempt to join the Polish revolution. At about that time he married Rose Fowlie, a former schoolmate, with whom he had eleven children. After teaching in Glasgow and Edinburgh he read for the bar in Edinburgh; in 1874 he transferred to London and was called to the English bar from the Middle Temple on 17 November 1877. He had chambers at 6 Pump Court in the Middle Temple from 1878 to 1887, but then ceased to practise.<br>
<br>Davidson's real interest had always been in radical politics and journalism. In the 1860s he wrote for many Scottish newspapers, and was later the London editor of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Daily Review</span>. He was an uncompromising republican and democrat, and was secretary of the Advanced Liberal Association in Edinburgh, seceding from it as an opponent of all religious teaching in schools. He was corresponding secretary of the Edinburgh Republican Club from 1870.<br>
<br>In London Davidson was correspondent for the <span class="italic">Bradford Observer</span> and <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span>, and wrote for many other papers, including <span class="italic">Reynolds News</span>. He met Henry George and quarrelled with him about usury. In 1885 he stood for election for Greenock, at very short notice, as the candidate of the Scottish Land Restoration League, receiving sixty-five votes. His journalism was amplified by many pamphlets and books, which show him as an energetic and individualistic socialist, but always writing within the British radical tradition and with a strong emphasis on the Norman yoke and Saxon freedoms and institutions. He took Gerrard Winstanley as his model, as evidenced by his <span class="italic">Concerning four precursors of Henry George and the single tax, as also the land gospel according to Winstanley the Digger</span> (1899). Other characteristic works, from a large output, are <span class="italic">The New Book of Kings</span> (1884), <span class="italic">Scotia rediviva: Home Rule for Scotland</span> (1891?), <span class="italic">The Annals of Toil</span> (4 pts, 1899) (dedicated to Michael Davitt and Prince Kropotkin), and <span class="italic">The Book of Lords</span> (1884), which reflect a Saxon anti-feudalism. Less polemical is <span class="italic">Eminent Radicals in and out of Parliament</span> (1879). The biography of him by Autolycus in Davidson's <span class="italic">Politics for the People</span> is probably, in fact, his autobiography. Davidson was brought up as a Presbyterian but became an Arian, sometimes preaching in Unitarian churches. His anti-clericalism is recorded in <span class="italic">That Great Lying Church of England</span> (1906), and his ethicalism in <span class="italic">The Son of Man: Standard-Bearer of Humanity</span> (1906). Davidson died at 56 Marmora Road, Peckham, London, on 18 December 1916, a largely forgotten figure of the British radical tradition.<br>
