<span class="headword">Porden,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1755, <em>d.</em> 1822), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in Hull and baptized there on 29 January 1755, the son of Thomas Purden or Porden, a labourer, and grandson of Roger Pourden of York, described as an architect. In 1774 he became a pupil of James Wyatt, to whom he was apparently introduced by the poet William Mason. Porden later claimed to have been responsible for drawing Wyatt's attention to the beauties of Gothic architecture by taking him to York Minster, where he spent two months sketching details in 1777. In 1778 Porden exhibited a design for a Gothic church at the Royal Academy, and in the following year he was co-author, with the painters Robert Smirke and Robert Watson, of <span class="italic">The Exhibition, or, A Second Anticipation</span>, a satire on the Royal Academy and its professor of architecture, Thomas Sandby, which appeared under the pseudonym &#145;Roger Shanhagan, Gent&#146;. He may subsequently have spent some time in the office of his near contemporary Samuel Pepys Cockerell, and for some time after 1779 he acted as secretary or paymaster to John Baker-Holroyd, Lord Sheffield, who had recently raised the 22nd regiment of dragoons. The regiment was later reduced in size, and in 1784 Porden exhibited once again at the Royal Academy. That same year, on 16 October, he married Mary Plowman (<i>d</i>. 1819), with whom he had two daughters. In 1785, having returned to Wyatt's office probably as senior assistant, he &#145;superintended&#146; a festival in honour of the composer George Frideric Handel in Westminster Abbey, where Wyatt was surveyor; in or about the same year he was appointed surveyor to the London estate of Richard, first Earl Grosvenor. He also became surveyor to the vestry of St George, Hanover Square, London, in 1785, and from then onwards began to build up an independent practice.<br>
<br>Porden took some time to establish himself as an architect. His first known executed work was a row of houses in Phillimore Place, Kensington, built in 1787&#150;9 and since largely demolished. He subsequently gained some minor country-house commissions and exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy, but failed to be made an associate in 1797. His place in the history of English architecture rests mainly on two almost contemporary buildings: the stables (now called the Dome) and riding house of the Royal Pavilion at Brighton, built for George, prince of Wales (later George IV), in 1803&#150;8, and Eaton Hall, Cheshire, remodelled and greatly extended for Robert, second Earl Grosvenor, in 1803&#150;12 (but subsequently altered and demolished). Porden succeeded Henry Holland as the prince's architect in Brighton, and was first employed to make unexecuted designs for the external remodelling of the pavilion in the Chinese style. The new, circular stable block had a spectacular domed interior surrounded by stalls for forty-four horses, with a roof of timber and glass based on that of the Halle au Bl&eacute; in Paris (1782; burnt down in 1803). But stylistically Porden anticipated both S. P. Cockerell (at Sezincote, Gloucestershire) and John Nash (at the pavilion itself) by drawing on the architecture of Muslim India, recently publicized in <span class="italic">Views of Oriental Scenery</span> (1795&#150;1808), by Thomas and William Daniell, and in doing so he created one of the most striking examples of orientalism in English architecture. The rebuilding of Eaton Hall, by contrast, was carried out in the Gothic style, already much employed by Wyatt in his domestic work, and recommended by Porden in a letter to Lord Grosvenor on the ground that it was &#145;preferable [to classical architecture] on the score of preserving that distinction of Rank and Fortune, which it is the habit of the age to diminish&#146;  (Acloque and Cornforth, 304). With its profuse Perpendicular Gothic external detailing, lavish upholstered interiors, and cast-iron windows and pinnacles, Porden's Eaton Hall was one of the most ambitious and (with a cost of over &pound;100,000 by 1812) expensive houses of its age, and its construction marked an important step in the advance of the Gothic revival in domestic architecture.<br>
<br>Porden failed to capitalize on the fame of these buildings. At Brighton he designed a house for the prince's mistress Mrs Fitzherbert in 1804, but he was later superseded in the prince's favour by John Nash. In 1805 his Gothic design for Downing College, Cambridge, was turned down in favour of a Grecian one by William Wilkins, and an austere Grecian scheme of 1807 for Broomhall, Fife, was likewise set aside by Thomas Bruce, seventh earl of Elgin. Porden was employed by Lord Grosvenor to rebuild Grosvenor House, London (since demolished), in 1806&#150;8, but he was described as &#145;incurably dilatory&#146; in his work as estate surveyor  (<span class="italic">Survey of London</span>, 44), and by 1819 he had been dismissed from Eaton Hall, having quarrelled with both his patron and the craftsmen; the project was completed by the clerk of works, Benjamin Gummow. By then Porden had long ceased taking outside commissions, and in September 1821 his surveyorship of the Grosvenor estate also came to an end after further disagreements with Lord Grosvenor following the failure of a scheme to redevelop the north side of Berkeley Square. These reverses &#145;preyed on his spirits&#146;  (Redgrave, <span class="italic">Artists</span>, 338), and he died at 59 Berners Street, London, his home since 1796, on 14 September 1822. He was buried in St John's Wood chapel, London. His wife, Mary, had died on 23 December 1819, but his two daughters survived him. The elder married the architect Joseph Kay, a pupil of S. P. Cockerell who assisted Porden at Eaton Hall; the younger, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10088/', "Eleanor Porden")</script>, was a poet and married the Arctic explorer Sir John Franklin. His pupils included his nephew Charles Ferdinand Porden (1790&#150;1863) and P. F. Robinson (1776&#150;1858).<br>
