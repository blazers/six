<span class="headword">Powell,  Richard</span>  (1766&#150;1834), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at the end of 1766 and baptized on 11 May 1767, the son of Joseph Powell, gentleman, of Thame, Oxfordshire, and his wife, Francis, formerly Smith. He was educated at Thame grammar school and proceeded in 1781 to Winchester College. He matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford, on 19 January 1785, and in the same year he migrated to Merton College, where he graduated BA on 23 October 1788, MA on 31 October 1791, BM on 12 July 1792, and DM on 20 January 1795. He went on to study medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, having spent some time at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary; at Barts he was one of the founders of the Medical and Philosophical Society, afterwards named the Abernethian Society, which existed until about 1986.<br>
<br>Powell was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 30 September 1796, and in 1799 he delivered the Goulstonian lectures. They were published in 1800, under the title of <span class="italic">Observations on the Bile and its Diseases, and on the Oeconomy of the Liver</span>, and show careful observation and sound judgement. The method of clinical examination of the liver which he proposed was excellent; and he was the first English medical writer who demonstrated that gallstones may remain fixed in the neck of the gall bladder, or even obliterate its cavity, without well-marked symptoms or serious injury to the patient. Powell lectured at St Bartholomew's from 1796 and on the resignation of Dr Richard Budd he was, on 14 August 1801, elected physician to the hospital, an office which he retained until 1824. He was a censor at the Royal College of Physicians in 1798, 1807, 1820, and 1823; was Lumleian lecturer from 1811 to 1822; and delivered the Harveian oration in 1808. In the same year he was appointed secretary to the commission for regulating madhouses.<br>
<br>Powell had considerable chemical knowledge and published <span class="italic">Heads of Lectures on Chemistry</span> in 1796. He was one of the revisers of the <span class="italic">Pharmacopoeia Londinensis</span> in 1809, and he published a translation from Latin to English of that edition. On 13 April 1810 he read, at the Royal College of Physicians, <span class="italic">Observations upon the Comparative Prevalence of Insanity at Different Periods</span>, afterwards published in the sixth volume of <span class="italic">Medical Transactions of the Royal College of Physicians of London</span>. In the same volume he published <span class="italic">Observations on the Internal Use of Nitrate of Silver</span>, in which he recommended its use in chorea and in epilepsy, an opinion which he modified in a subsequent paper on further cases of the same diseases, read on 17 April 1815. On 20 December 1813 he had read <span class="italic">Observations upon some Cases of Paralytic Affection</span>  (<span class="italic">Medical Transactions</span>, vol. 5), in which simple facial palsy was described for the first time. Sir Charles Bell, in the course of his researches on the nervous system, afterwards redescribed and explained this affliction, but the credit of its first clinical description belongs to Powell, who also initiated a method of treatment by warm applications which was often efficacious. On 2 December 1814 Powell read &#145;Some cases illustrative of the pathology of the brain&#146;, a description of thirteen cases of interest, including that of one patient with tuberculous meningitis and of another with a pituitary tumour.<br>
<br>A fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, Powell gave some attention to the study of the history of St Bartholomew's Hospital; and on 27 November 1817 a communication by him was read to the society describing the most ancient charter preserved in the hospital (a grant from Rahere in 1137), and its seal. The whole text of this charter was printed in the nineteenth volume of <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>. Powell lived in London in Bedford Place for some years, and, after he retired from practice in 1824, in York Terrace, Regent's Park, where he died on 18 August 1834.<br>
