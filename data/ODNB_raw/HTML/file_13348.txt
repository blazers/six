<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hindmarsh,  Robert</span>  (1759&#150;1835), <span class="occ">Swedenborgian preacher</span>, was born in Alnwick, Northumberland, on 8 November 1759, the son of James Hindmarsh (1732&#150;1812) and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1775). His father was one of the schoolmasters at Wesley's school at Kingswood in the 1760s, and subsequently an itinerant preacher for Wesley. Hindmarsh was a student at this school and was converted during a revival in the school in 1768. Apprenticed to a Quaker printer in London, he was introduced to &#145;mystical&#146; literature and became a devotee of the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg, which he published when he became a printer in his own right. If his cheerful and purposeful character appears somewhat at odds with the image of the early Swedenborgians, his rational distaste for the Trinity attracted him to the new doctrines; his efficiency and his gift for languages made him very valuable to the &#145;new church&#146;. In 1783 he was appointed the secretary of two of the early Swedenborgian societies and he sat as an equal alongside an intellectual &eacute;lite in a society of talents. As former Methodists, he and his father wanted a chapel where they could worship God according to Swedenborgian theology, and his father became the first preacher when the New Jerusalem church was established. On 7 May 1782 Hindmarsh married Sarah Paramor (<i>d</i>. 1833) of Monckton, Thanet; they had five children.<br>
<br>Hindmarsh was certainly a high-profile figure in the early Swedenborgian group, promoting the doctrines even to Joseph Priestley in 1791, but he was also not frightened to follow the bolder ideas of some Swedenborgians about spiritual marriage and was expelled from membership of the chapel, although he was later encouraged to produce its magazine. He further soured of the society by 1793 when they rejected the episcopalian status sought by his father in favour of the more usual nonconformist congregational system of church government, at a time when such views were politically charged. He did little for the cause apart from attempting to found a new London congregation of the &#145;new church&#146; in 1799 and publishing translations of Swedenborg's works until 1810. During this period he was an active member of the stock exchange, but was then invited to serve as minister of a proprietary chapel of the New Jerusalem church in Salford, Lancashire. He withdrew again from active involvement in the denomination in 1824, spending his retirement in writing his history of the sect, a highly partisan interpretation which was not published until 1861, but has influenced all subsequent interpretations of the sect, despite his curious bias. He then caused an abiding controversy in that sect through his claim that he did not need ordination when he commenced his ministerial career in 1810 because he had been ordained &#145;by the divine auspices of heaven&#146; at the time of the first ordinations of the church in 1788. Hindmarsh died in his daughter's house in Gravesend on 2 January 1835, two years after his wife, and was buried in Milton-next-Gravesend. He is a striking blend of the sectarianism on the fringes of the evangelical revival. His career is controversial even to the church he founded, and his biographer pictures him &#145;with the sword in one hand and the trowel in the other&#146;  (Odhner).<br>
