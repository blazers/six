<span class="headword">West,  Temple</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1715, <em>d.</em> 1757), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, on 27 March 1715. He was the son of Richard West (1687?&#150;1716), archdeacon of Berkshire, and his wife, Maria (<i>d</i>. 1763), eldest daughter of the politician Sir Richard Temple and sister of Richard Temple, Viscount Cobham, and Hester, Countess Temple, wife of Richard Grenville, Earl Temple. These links bound him closely to the Grenville &#145;cousinhood&#146; that was growing in political power at this time. The author and translator <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29084/', "Gilbert West")</script> was his elder brother.<br>
<br>West entered the navy in September 1727 as a volunteer per order on board the <i>Revenge</i>, with Captain Conningsby Norbury, in the fleet at Gibraltar under Sir Charles Wager. In July 1728 he was moved into the <i>Canterbury</i> with Captain Edmund Hook, on the home station and in the Mediterranean, and as volunteer and midshipman continued in her for over three years. In 1733 he was in the <i>Dursley Galley</i> with Captain Thomas Smith. He passed his examination on 21 December 1733. Two months later, on 23 February 1734, he was promoted to be third lieutenant of the <i>Dorsetshire</i>, from which in May he was moved to the <i>Norfolk</i>. On 7 April 1736 he became second lieutenant on the <i>Gloucester</i>. On 14 May of the following year he was promoted to be commander of the sloop <i>Alderney</i>. On 6 June he married Frances Balchin (1710&#150;1793). In June 1738 West was posted to the frigate <i>Deal Castle</i>, which he commanded in the channel or on the coast of Portugal until February 1741, when he was moved to the <i>Sapphire</i>, and from her in April to the <i>Dartmouth</i>, one of the ships with Rear-Admiral Nicholas Haddock in the Mediterranean.<br>
<br>On 3 June 1743 Haddock's successor, Vice-Admiral Mathews, moved West into the sixty-gun ship <i>Warwick</i>, which he commanded in the action off Toulon on 11 February 1744. The <i>Stirling Castle</i>, followed by the <i>Warwick</i>, formed the head of the British line, and both ships kept aloof from the French, firing on them from a distance. The ships astern did the same, and thus in the van there was no close action. At the time there was no criticism of either West or Captain Cooper of the <i>Stirling Castle</i>, but West was called to give evidence to the House of Commons inquiry into the battle on 28 March 1745. Although he was in the van and the main subject of the inquiry was Vice-Admiral Lestock's failure to bring the rear division into close action, he did venture the opinion that all the officers he had spoken to, except Lestock's flag captain, blamed the vice-admiral for failing to intercept the rear of the Franco-Spanish line. A month after Lestock's court martial and acquittal in June 1745, West was dismayed to find that Lestock had charged him and Cooper with disobedience in failing to engage the enemy van closely. Both officers were brought to a court martial. After five days' hearings, West's court martial ended on 13 December 1745. Notwithstanding his defence, like Cooper's, that he had had to keep to windward of the French van to prevent it from tacking around the front of the British line and doubling the leading ships, he was found guilty of not keeping to the line of battle and was cashiered. Although he was certainly in breach of the fighting instructions and article eleven of the articles of war, his actions were probably correct under the circumstances of the battle. This and the powerful political support of the Grenvilles earned West and Cooper a reinstatement by order in council in 1746.<br>
<br>In 1747 West commanded the <i>Devonshire</i>, as flag captain to Rear-Admiral Peter Warren in the action off Cape Finisterre on 3 May. In 1748 he was commodore and commander-in-chief at the Nore. During the peace he remained on shore, and was for a short time (January 1753&#150;April 1754) MP for Buckingham, on the accession of his cousin, Richard Grenville, to the peerage as Earl Temple. He did not stand again in the general election of 1754. On 4 February 1755 he was promoted rear-admiral of the red, and during the summer commanded a small squadron in the Bay of Biscay. In the following spring, with his flag in the <i>Buckingham</i>, he went out to the Mediterranean as second in command, with Admiral John Byng. In the action near Minorca, on 20 May, he had command of the van, which did engage closely, and, being left unsupported, received a good deal of damage. He was afterwards summarily superseded and recalled to England, but no blame was attached to him and he was released while Byng was taken into custody to face a court martial.<br>
<br>The Grenville &#145;cousinhood&#146; were important supporters of William Pitt and when Pitt came to power with the duke of Devonshire on 15 November 1756, West was nominated a member of the Board of Admiralty, of which his cousin, Lord Temple, was the head. On 8 December he was promoted to be vice-admiral of the blue, and shortly afterwards he was appointed to command a squadron on particular service. He hoisted his flag in the <i>Magnanime</i>, but despite having given evidence against Byng at the admiral's court martial, he none the less refused to &#145;serve on terms which subject an officer to the treatment shown Admiral Byng&#146;. He accordingly struck his flag. He was dissuaded by Temple from resigning his seat on the Admiralty board, despite Byng's execution on 14 March 1757, until the Pitt&#150;Devonshire ministry was dismissed in early April 1757. With Pitt's return to power in July he resumed his seat on the Admiralty board, but only for a few weeks, dying on 9 August. He was buried at St John's, West Wickham, Kent, on 15 August 1757. He was survived by his wife, who died on 27 January 1793. His grandson, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29089/', "Sir John West")</script>, had a distinguished naval career, being made admiral of the fleet in 1858.<br>
