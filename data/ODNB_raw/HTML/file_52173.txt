<span class="headword">Exton,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1402), <span class="occ">mayor of London</span>, was a member of the fishmongers' guild, for whom, and for the other city victualling guilds, he was to be an active spokesman in the early 1380s. He had served, rather precociously, as MP for Middlesex in 1369. In 1382 he began the first of his eight terms as alderman for Billingsgate&#151;then, as later, the London ward most closely associated with the fish trade. John Northampton (<i>d</i>. 1398) was then in the middle of his tumultuous two-year mayoralty. Northampton's mildly populist programme&#151;demanding increased electoral influence for crafts rather than wards, and a reduction of food prices to encourage price competition&#151;was regarded as extreme and unsettling by the powerful grocers and fishmongers, and by other established interests. Exton, who gravitated naturally to the following of Northampton's leading opponent, the grocer Nicholas Brembre (<i>d</i>. 1388), quickly established himself as an ardent advocate of the fishmongers and related groups.<br>
<br>On 10 August 1382 pro-Northampton aldermen and others called for his resignation as alderman &#145;for opprobrious words used to the aforesaid mayor&#146;  (Sharpe, <span class="italic">Calendar of Letter-Books</span>, H, 196), and Exton, claiming a personal wish to be discharged of office, was in fact removed five days later. Yet in September 1382 he addressed parliament on behalf of the fishmongers, evidently arguing with some satiric force that if current measures on the sale of fish were approved, then any non-citizen should be able to sell any merchandise he chose in the city. During this period of heightened debate one group of fishmongers was hauled into court, one of their number reputedly having said that &#145;he and all the other fishmongers of London were bound to put their hands under the feet of Nicholas Extone for his good deeds and words on behalf of the mistery&#146;  (Sharpe, <span class="italic">Calendar of Letter-Books</span>, H, 203).<br>
<br>Exton's political fortunes improved with the election of Nicholas Brembre as mayor, an office he held from 1383 to 1386. He was among Brembre's supporters present at Northampton's conviction on 15 August 1384, and shortly thereafter was elected sheriff by the commonalty in 1384, and returned to his aldermanry in 1385. Elected mayor in his own right from 1386 to 1388, he continued to co-operate closely with his predecessor Brembre. In pursuance of Brembre's programme he arranged a meeting of the common council on 12 March 1387, with a selectively augmented membership, at which agreement was reached to burn the jubilee book of city ordinances, first compiled in 1377 (the jubilee of Edward III), and containing regulations for the victualling trades and other reformist material sponsored by John Northampton and others.<br>
<br>Certain equivocations may be seen in Exton's conduct as mayor during the difficult period in 1386&#150;8, when the lords appellant sought to limit Richard II's power. The king sought by varied means to secure London's support, and on 5 October 1387 Exton tried to induce the craft guilds to subscribe to a pro-Ricardian oath of loyalty. Knighton claims that he sought, unsuccessfully, to raise troops in London in defence of the king's prerogative. But Knighton also represents Exton as blocking an anti-parliamentary scheme by Richard in 1386, and as saving London from forcible entry in December 1387 by opening the city's gates to the lords appellant once their victory had become certain. During the Merciless Parliament of 1388 Brembre was condemned to death along with other Ricardian loyalists, with Exton evidently assenting to the view that his sometime ally had been guilty of the treasons with which he was charged. On 13 October 1388 the more moderate Nicholas Twyford (<i>d</i>. 1390/91) was elected mayor.<br>
<br>A strongly partisan figure, Exton nevertheless belonged to a ruling oligarchy whose shared interests often made it a force for stability in London's affairs, and especially in the city's dealings with the crown. Moreover, some of his offices, such as that of mayor of the staple of Westminster, helped to align him with interests outside the oligarchy, a consideration that may have helped him to weather a difficult period unscathed. He received royal preferment throughout the unsettled years from 1387 to 1389. At the Cambridge parliament of October 1388 he received a pardon for all treasons and felonies, and on the same occasion notification was made prohibiting citizens from spreading rumours that he had sought the derogation of city liberties. He sued successfully for moneys owed him by Nicholas Brembre, lost in forfeit, receiving from the king a Spanish sword and other items in pawn, and he later purchased many of Brembre's forfeited possessions. In 1392 he stood with a broad political cross-section of elected officials in bearing Richard II's wrath during the latter's celebrated &#145;quarrel with the city&#146;.<br>
<br>Exton appears to have lived in retirement during the last decade of his life. No children are recorded of either of his two marriages, to Katherine and (<i>c</i>.1382) to Johanna. In his will, made in 1393 but not proved until 20 February 1402, he left properties in the London parish of All Hallows Gracechurch to his brother John Curteys, and other rents to the rector, Henry Cokeham, for anniversaries and prayers.<br>
