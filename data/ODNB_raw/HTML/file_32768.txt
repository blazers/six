</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Deedes, Sir  Wyndham Henry</span>  (1883&#150;1956), <span class="occ">army officer, civil administrator, and social worker</span>, was born on 10 March 1883 at 19 Westbourne Place, Belgravia, London, the second son of Colonel Herbert George Deedes, assistant under-secretary of state for war, and his wife, Rose Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1940), daughter of Major-General Lousada Barrow of the Madras staff corps. The Deedes family had risen to the ranks of the landed gentry three hundred years before, making its fortune in the woollen trade near Dover. Deedes's own father had inherited two neighbouring properties in Kent, Sandling Park and Saltwood Castle, but had pursued a career in the army.<br>
<br>Deedes's childhood home was Saltwood, but he spent much time in London. He was educated at Eton College from the age of nine, but it was not a happy experience. A gentle, rather grave, little boy, he left school, in his own eyes, &#145;absolutely uneducated&#146; and joined the army almost at once. In February 1901 he received his commission in the King's Royal Rifle Corps and was soon bound for South Africa, where he impressed his commanding officer. He was a devout Anglican, and his care for the soldiers in his command and an interest in social issues were already evident. He even helped his men dig trenches.<br>
<br>Between 1903 and 1910 Deedes was successively stationed at Bermuda, Ireland (where he was aide-de-camp to his uncle, General Knox), England, and Malta. By 1906 he was a lieutenant. In February 1908 he was dispatched to Malta, there serving as aide-de-camp to the governor, Sir Harry Grant. A gifted linguist, he had already taught himself Dutch and German; and it was in Malta that he began to learn the language which would change his life: Turkish. He applied to join the gendarmerie in the British district of Macedonia, and he arrived in Constantinople in February 1910. There Deedes made the acquaintance of as many Turks as he could and perfected his knowledge of their language. At this time he also met the young Robert Graves. He was subsequently transferred, first to Smyrna, then to Tripoli, superintending an area stretching from the Mediterranean to the southern fringe of the Libyan desert: four times the size of France. Here he found the gendarmerie in a desperate state. They were only a handful. They had few clothes and no barracks. They had not been paid. Deedes himself had no money and no maps. He was only twenty-seven. But still he relished the challenge. By the time he left, in July 1911, and returned to Smyrna the gendarmerie was 1500 strong and impressively efficient.<br>
<br>At this time Deedes was profoundly influenced by reading the <span class="italic">Prevention of Destitution</span> (1911), by Sidney and Beatrice Webb, and he wrote to his mother from Smyrna that he could think of no better way to live than to spend himself in charity organization work. Nevertheless, he was placed on a government commission in the east of Anatolia, landing at Samsun in July 1913 and taking the works of John Stuart Mill, Thomas Huxley, and Charles Darwin with him into the Anatolian highlands. In 1913 he was seconded by the Foreign Office to the Turkish government to assist Talaat, minister of the interior. He went gladly, beginning to write articles on Turkey for the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>. He then became a civil inspector, a position granted by the sultan, and worked on a scheme to resettle refugees in Bursa. However, the outbreak of the First World War forced his return to Britain. Highly respected for his knowledge of Turkish, he was reunited with the intelligence department at the War Office, visiting the Turkish embassy frequently, and watching the effects of British diplomacy critically as Turkey swung into the German camp.<br>
<br>Deedes was still at the War Office when the Gallipoli campaign was first drafted and he was pessimistic about its prospects. Between February 1915 and January 1916 he served on the expedition as a staff captain. He was given his own section, I(B), with a brief to keep an eye open on guides, interpreters, and dubious characters, and also to hunt for spies. An outstanding officer who saw issues with a rare clarity, he had the courage to press, with a number of junior officers, for strategic change. When, after twelve futile months, withdrawal took place, I(B) played a valuable part in ensuring the secrecy, and the success, of the evacuation. Deedes himself was three times mentioned in dispatches and in January 1916 was awarded the DSO.<br>
<br>By now Deedes had been transferred to the intelligence service in Cairo and Alexandria. In Cairo he joined forces with those who were planning the Arab revolt, among them T. E. Lawrence, with whom he worked closely but apparently without any personal rapport. In 1916 he became a major; in 1917 brevet lieutenant-colonel. When General Allenby entered Jerusalem on 11 December Deedes was one of the party. Shortly afterwards he was stationed there to help administer the city, conciliate in disputes, work for displaced peoples, and orchestrate the efforts of relief agencies in the city. It was here he encountered, perhaps for the first time, the aspirations of the Zionist movement (with which he was later to identify) and in April 1918 he met Chaim Weizmann. In that year the two became firm friends, discussing ideals and collaborating in saving a Jewish settlement scheduled for eviction as a security hazard.<br>
<br>In 1918 Deedes was made temporary brigadier-general, one of the youngest in the army. In 1919 he was seconded to the Foreign Office for work in Egypt. His distinctive gifts for sympathetic but dispassionate diplomacy, and his rare linguistic expertise, had earned him a reputation in influential quarters. After the armistice with Turkey it was intended that he should join the allied commission at Constantinople. However, while on home leave after four and a half years spent abroad, he was approached to join the administration to run Palestine under the new British mandate. Despite a feeling of unworthiness, and still committed to the idea of doing social work, Deedes was persuaded by Herbert Samuel, the first high commissioner, to become chief secretary in the Palestine administration. Samuel later wrote in his memoirs that he had asked for Deedes in April 1920 not only because he was by profession a soldier of great administrative capacity, but because &#145;there was in him a strong strain of idealism which drew him powerfully to the Holy Land&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). However, Deedes undertook to serve for only two years. On arrival in Jerusalem in May 1920 he recruited an energetic staff of young men, Arabs as well as Jews, who established a model of collaboration and enterprise. He was deeply interested in both the Arab desire for freedom from foreign rule and the Jewish claim on Palestine as a national home.<br>
<br>Deedes believed in personal relations more than political and official relationships: essentially he was driven not by politics, but by his religion. He sought to reconcile Arab and Zionist aspirations, but opposed centralization and ventured into the provinces to see matters for himself. He grew popular and was warmly praised by Jews and Arabs alike. A leading Arab newspaper commented: &#145;Every element in the country, as far as we can observe, seems to think that he is their friend&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Both communities sensed that his was a distinctive and unusual presence among them and knew how to value it. His mother joined him in Jerusalem, creating a home in which people of different faiths and opinions could meet together and talk. But the situation was increasingly volatile. Deedes struggled to control the May Day riots in Jaffa in 1921, decisively allowing Jews to defend themselves, standing on a lorry, unarmed and virtually alone, and exhorting the crowds around him to disperse. He saved a Jewish settlement at Rehoboth from an assault by a crowd of ten thousand, not by deploying soldiers, but by instructing an aeroplane to dive low over their heads. <br>
<br>In 1921 Deedes was knighted. Early in 1923 he resigned. Some thought him worn down by administration. In reality he was troubled by the gulf which separated him as chief secretary from humble people: he had no interest in material advantages, and the trappings of office and authority seemed only a hindrance to spiritual life. He had always practised stern self-denial and cultivated the great grace of humility, and he argued that there were plenty of abler men to replace him. He transferred to the Highland light infantry in 1923 and retired with the rank of colonel and honorary rank of brigadier-general. In April 1923 he finally returned to live in England, refusing all official ceremonies, preferring to say his farewells quietly and personally.<br>
<br>At the age of forty Wyndham Deedes began a new career in social work. He moved into two rooms in University House, Bethnal Green, a poor suburb of London, much inhabited by immigrants. There he became absorbed in social work for several organizations, pursuing the solitary, devout life of a Christian ascetic. He worked assiduously for the National Council of Social Service and chaired its London council. He helped to establish a bookshop where public talks took place. He slept little, rose at 5.30, and dealt with correspondence before breakfast. Usually, he ate only a biscuit for lunch. Much of his income he gave away. He read a great deal, often theology, in the evenings, and also translated Turkish novels into English.<br>
<br>The world beyond Bethnal Green was not cast aside. Deedes broadcast once a week over the BBC, in Turkish which now seemed a little dated, though it had a rare elegance. He still travelled abroad, to promote Zionism in Europe and the United States. He made himself useful in the new representative bodies of the Church of England. Instinctively he strongly opposed national socialism and visited Germany twice on missions of protest or assistance. Deedes was often a guest of the Weizmanns, who lived in Kensington. He revisited Turkey towards the end of 1939 after a violent earthquake had occurred there. He was a founder of the Turkish Centre in Fitzhardinge Street in London. In 1943 he was instrumental in creating, in Bedford Square, the British Association for the Jewish National Home in Palestine; a year later he was chiefly responsible for acquiring the house in Manchester Square which became Palestine House. (On 30 September 1948 it became the legation of Israel.)<br>
<br>When war broke out again in September 1939 Deedes chose to serve in the civil defence. He became a conscientious chief air-raid warden for the borough. When bombed out of University House he moved into a neighbouring tenement. In 1941 his work assumed a more explicitly political character when he became Labour member of the London county council for North-East Bethnal Green, remaining such until 1946. He also became a member of the education committee.<br>
<br>A succession of operations&#151;three in 1946 alone&#151;diminished Deedes's physical powers and his stamina. His mother had died in 1940, and Saltwood Castle was sold. He was advised to leave London on health grounds, and in 1950 he returned to Hythe, near the family home of Saltwood, living simply in a single bed-sitting room in a boarding-house, often passing the night deep in meditation and noting his reflections, as he had for years, on little scraps of paper. Visitors were struck by the spiritual side of his nature. Eliahu Elath, the Israeli ambassador, who met him in 1950, noted that &#145;the strength which was so visibly deserting his body could, in some mysterious way, be transmuting itself into moral and spiritual vitality&#146;  (Elath, Bentwich, and May, 82). The creation of the state of Israel proved to be the fulfilment of his hopes, and Deedes reflected that perhaps he had been allowed to live only to see it happen. Sir Wyndham Deedes died on 2 September 1956 in St Bartholomew's Hospital, London.<br>
