<span class="headword">Speight,  John <span class="st"> [Johnny]</span></span>  (1920&#150;1998), <span class="occ">comedy writer</span>, was born on 2 June 1920 at 111 Dale Road, Canning Town, east London, the eldest of the three children (two sons and one daughter) of John Speight, a boiler scaler, and his wife, Johanna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sullivan. Educated locally at St Helen's Roman Catholic School, he left, aged fourteen, without any formal qualifications.<br>
<br>A succession of menial jobs followed at several East End factories along the Silvertown Way, but what enthusiasm Speight exhibited during this period was reserved for his fledgeling career as a jazz musician, playing drums in two minor London-based bands before forming his own outfit, Johnny Speight and His Hot Shots. When the Second World War intervened he joined the Royal Corps of Signals, serving as a cook, and then, following demobilization, he tried and failed to forge a full-time career as a drummer, and had to settle instead for spells as a milkman and an insurance salesman.<br>
<br>The idea of writing as a vocation came to Speight through his regular visits to Canning Town Public Library. John Steinbeck was an early influence, because Speight felt he wrote of real, believable worlds, but it was a novel by George Bernard Shaw, <span class="italic">Immaturity</span>, which had an impact that the stocky, stammering, but sharp-witted Speight likened to a &#145;divine revelation&#146;, acting as if &#145;a light had been turned on and every dark recess lit by sweet reason&#146;  (Speight). He proceeded to devour all things Shavian, as well as works by Strindberg, Chekhov, and Ibsen, and he joined the Unity Theatre, where he wrote several overtly left-wing plays which he later dismissed as &#145;a load of crap&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Speight's move into comedy came in the mid-1950s, when in a jazz club one of his sardonic remarks was overheard by Spike Milligan and Eric Sykes. With their encouragement he started developing more humorous material. After meeting Frankie Howerd, a great patron of comic writers, Speight committed himself to his new craft. His work was first heard on a 1955 BBC radio show entitled <span class="italic">Mr Ross&#151;and Mr Ray</span>, starring bandleaders Edmundo Ross and Ray Ellington, and at the end of that year he began contributing scripts to <span class="italic">The Frankie Howerd Show</span>.<br>
<br>Speight married a secretary from Dagenham, Constance Beatrice Barrett (<i>b</i>. 1929/30), the daughter of Edward Barrett, a bus conductor, on 3 April 1956. They had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Speight's writing career started to advance in 1957 when he began a nine-year engagement as principal scriptwriter of ITV's <span class="italic">The Arthur Haynes Show</span>. Haynes came to television without an established comic persona, so Speight created one for him: an aggressive, argumentative, know-all tramp by the name of Hobo Haynes. It was also during this period that Speight wrote several class-conscious plays for television, including <span class="italic">The Compartment</span> (1961), for which he won the first of his four Screen Writers' Guild awards, and <span class="italic">Playmates</span> (1962). On 22 July 1965 Speight's half-hour satire, <span class="italic">Till Death Us Do Part</span>, about a white, working-class, ill-educated, tory-voting East End bigot named Alf Ramsay (played by Warren Mitchell) and his stoical wife, saucy daughter, and left-wing Liverpudlian son-in-law, was broadcast on BBC1 as part of its <span class="italic">Comedy Playhouse</span> season. It struck a chord, and a series (the first of seven) was commissioned.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Till Death Us Do Part</span>, which ran from 1966 to 1975, brought social commentary to the genre of situation comedy. Each week Alf Garnett (the surname was changed in deference to England's football manager) would swear (although the BBC limited him to twenty &#145;bloodys&#146; per episode), and shout as he said the unsayable about liberal modern Britain's sacred cows. Some viewers failed to see Speight's satirical intention, but the writer remained unrepentant: &#145;I didn't create Alf Garnett&#146;, he protested. &#145;Society did. I just grassed on him&#146;  (Speight).<br>
<br>The show, which Speight described as &#145;the longest play I have written&#146;  (Speight), spawned two movies&#151;<span class="italic">Till Death Us Do Part</span> (1969) and <span class="italic">The Alf Garnett Saga</span> (1972)&#151;and served as the basis for milder versions in Holland, Germany, and, most notably, America, where <span class="italic">All in the Family</span> ran from 1971 to 1992. It made Speight a wealthy man, but he never came close to equalling its success. <span class="italic">Curry and Chips</span> (1969), a racial-conflict comedy co-written with Sykes and Milligan, was dropped by London Weekend Television after six episodes, while two other sitcoms, <span class="italic">Spooner's Patch</span> (1979&#150;82), set in a police station, and <span class="italic">The Nineteenth Hole</span> (1989), set in a golf club, failed to catch on. In 1985 Speight brought back the characters from <span class="italic">Till Death Us Do Part</span> for <span class="italic">In Sickness and in Health</span>, which ran for seven years without recapturing its old bite.<br>
<br>Johnny Speight died on 5 July 1998 of pancreatic cancer, at his home, Four Acres, Nottingham Road, South Heronsgate, Chorleywood, Hertfordshire. His achievement was in encouraging television comedy to develop sharper eyes, as well as a sharper tongue.<br>
