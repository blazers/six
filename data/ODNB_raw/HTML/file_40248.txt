<span class="headword">Strong <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Thorogood]</span>,  Rebecca</span>  (1843&#150;1944), <span class="occ">nurse</span>, was born on 23 August 1843 at the Blue Boar inn, High Street, Aldgate, London, the daughter of John Thorogood (1785&#150;1870), the innkeeper, and his wife, Mary Westell (1804&#150;1854). On 19 July 1863 Rebecca Thorogood married Andrew Robert Strong (1841&#150;1865), a mathematical instrument maker and son of Andrew Robert William Strong, a wholesale rag merchant. A daughter, Annie Ellen, was born in 1864 and a year later Rebecca was widowed. When her daughter was three Rebecca entered the Nightingale Training School, St Thomas's Hospital, London, and started her career as a nurse. As it was necessary for nurses to live in the nurses' home, both during training and when qualified, Strong's daughter was brought up by her family.<br>
<br>The Nightingale school, which had opened in 1860, was still in an experimental stage and after one year's practical work in the wards of St Thomas's, with some lectures, Strong was sent to Winchester Hospital and then to the new British army hospital at Netley, Southampton. In 1874, when her contract with the Nightingale school was completed, Strong applied and was appointed as matron of the Dundee Royal Infirmary. With the support of the managers she raised the standard of nursing and improved the nurses' working conditions. Her reputation reached Glasgow and, in 1879, she was appointed matron of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, the largest voluntary hospital in Scotland. Strong was shocked by the poor standard of nursing at Glasgow and insisted that all the ward sisters attend medical lectures and pass an examination. Strong had decided that nurses could no longer be properly trained on the wards alone; with recent developments in medicine they needed theoretical lectures if they were to carry out their duties intelligently. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34720/', "William Macewen (1848&#150;1924)")</script>, surgeon to the Royal Infirmary, had been one of the first to adopt Lister's antiseptic methods and was at the forefront of brain surgery. Although Macewen encouraged Strong to develop the nurses' education, he demanded a continuous supply of good nurses for his wards. Lack of sufficient accommodation limited the number of nurses available and when the infirmary managers repeatedly refused to provide more Strong resigned from her position in 1885.<br>
<br>For five years Strong ran her own private nursing home in Glasgow. During this time she and Macewen developed their ideas on the education of nurses. Then in 1891, Strong was asked to return to the Glasgow Royal Infirmary as matron, and thus they were given the opportunity to put their ideas into practice. The new training scheme started in 1893 and included several features which became standard for nurse training schemes in the twentieth century. It pioneered the block system by dividing the nurses' training into blocks of lectures, followed by blocks of practical ward work. It introduced compulsory theoretical instruction and examination before probationary nurses entered the wards. It set an educational standard for entry to training and it elevated nurses' education to the medical college, placing nurses on a par with medical students. Strong and Macewen both paid tribute to the contribution that the other had made to their achievements. The collaboration between them was rare and it advanced the development of brain surgery and the development of nurses' education.<br>
<br>Strong was a friend of Mrs Bedford Fenwick, the leader of the campaign for state registration, and they shared the view that nurses' education should be established at a university level, with postgraduate opportunities. They also shared ideas on the value of international contacts with professional women and Strong was an enthusiastic supporter of the International Council of Nurses, founded by Bedford Fenwick in 1899. She attended meetings of the council in Europe and North America until she was in her eighties. Strong was also a member of the various professional nursing organizations of the time, the Royal British Nurses' Association, and the Matrons Council, and was a vice-president of the National Council of Nurses of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1909 Strong and Macewen formed the Scottish Nurses Association and she later became president and represented the association on the committee of the Society for the State Registration of Nurses. The next ten years was a period of great professional development for nurses with the impact of the First World War, the establishment of the College of Nursing, and the passing of the <span class="roman">Nurses' Registration Acts</span>. Strong, like Bedford Fenwick, did not support the College of Nursing, and they were disappointed with the educational standards set by the new statutory bodies, the general nursing councils for England and Wales, Scotland, and Ireland.<br>
<br>Strong retired from the Glasgow Royal Infirmary in 1907 and moved to England to live with her sister. In 1912, following her sister's death, she returned to Scotland to live in St Fillans on the shores of Loch Earn, Perthshire. In 1886 her daughter had married the minister of the German protestant church in Glasgow, Adolf Geyer, and was settled there with five children. Strong did not approve of her son-in-law; she referred to him as &#145;that Austrian gypsy&#146; and did not speak to him for over thirty years. However, she contributed financially to the upkeep and education of her grandchildren.<br>
<br>In her retirement Strong supported initiatives which promoted nurses' educational and professional standards, among them the Scottish Nurses Club in Glasgow and the Glasgow Royal Infirmary Nurses' League. She was still very fit and enjoyed travelling and mountain climbing. She was appointed OBE in 1938, and at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary the work of Macewen and Strong was commemorated by the annual presentation of two medals to the best nurses. In Britain her reputation is less than in North America, where nurse education was developed in universities as early as the 1920s. In 1941 she moved to Chester to live with her great-nephew. Her hundredth birthday was celebrated in the nursing press, and the BBC broadcast a message from Strong to younger nurses. She died on 24 April 1944 at Heathfield, Vicars Cross, Christleton, Cheshire, and her funeral took place in Liverpool, where she was cremated.<br>
