<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Foot,  Hugh Mackintosh</span>, Baron Caradon  (1907&#150;1990), <span class="occ">colonial administrator and diplomatist</span>, was born on 8 October 1907 in Plymouth, the second son and second child in the family of five sons and two daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33189/', "Isaac Foot (1880&#150;1960)")</script>, solicitor and Liberal MP for Bodmin, Cornwall, and his wife Eva (1878&#150;1946), daughter of Dr Angus Mackintosh DPH of Fincastle, Perthshire. Isaac Foot's life centred on Liberal politics and Methodism. His children were brought up in a devout Christian home, over-brimming with books and the scholarship of radical philosophy. Hugh was the tallest and strongest of the children and the only one to win a scholarship to his school (the Quaker Leighton Park School in Reading). Unlike his father and three of his brothers, he did not enter the law, and whereas Dingle [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31115/', "Foot, Sir Dingle Mackintosh")</script>], John, Michael [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/102722/', "Foot, Michael Mackintosh")</script>], and Christopher studied at Oxford, Hugh went to St John's College, Cambridge, where he rowed and played cricket. Politics and public speaking were a busy part of his life and, following his father's radical Liberalism, he became president of the Liberal Club at Cambridge. Michael wrote of him later:<blockquote>He had acquired strange tastes and was ready to indulge in pastimes which the rest of us wouldn't be seen dead at&#151;such as rowing, playing polo, dressing up in Goering-like uniforms and enjoying it, and occasionally even&#151;at a pinch&#151;placing some trust in the word of Tory Prime Ministers.</blockquote>Four of the Foot brothers, including Hugh (1929), became presidents of their university unions. Hugh Foot obtained a second class (division one) in part one of the history tripos (1927), and a second class (division two) in part two of the law tripos (1929).<br>
<br>In 1929 Foot joined the colonial service and was posted to Palestine. He became an Arab linguist and learned about the stresses and strains of the Middle East, developing an understanding which was invaluable when in later years he worked at the United Nations. In 1936 he married, in Haifa, (Florence) Sylvia (1910&#150;1985), daughter of Arthur White Millar Tod OBE, director of the Steam Navigation Company of Baghdad. They had three sons, one of them the writer and journalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94036/', "Paul Mackintosh Foot (1937&#150;2004)")</script>, and a daughter. Foot was back in London in the Colonial Office in 1938&#150;9. On the outbreak of the Second World War he was appointed assistant British resident in Transjordan, where he stayed until 1942. In 1943 he became lieutenant-colonel in charge of military administration in Cyrenaica and later in the same year was sent as colonial secretary to Cyprus, which was dangerously near to German-occupied Greece, Rhodes, and Crete. In 1945 he went happily to Jamaica as colonial secretary and in 1947 he was posted to Nigeria as chief secretary. The preparatory work he did there contributed to Nigerian independence in 1962. He returned to Jamaica in 1951 as governor and captain-general. He was disappointed that plans for a federation of the West Indies were unsuccessful, Jamaica (which attained full independence in 1961) preferring to proceed alone.<br>
<br>Foot left the Caribbean in 1957 to become governor of the violent, riven island of Cyprus, which had changed dramatically since 1943. Greece and the Greek Cypriots wanted <i>enosis</i> (union), Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots desired partition, and the British government insisted on holding on to all of Cyprus. By 1960, after years of difficult diplomacy, independence was attained, with Britain retaining two sovereign bases on the island. The Conservative colonial secretary paid tribute in the House of Commons to Foot's &#145;unfailing imagination, courage and leadership&#146;. Cyprus was Foot's last colony. For over thirty years he had moved with authority in lands of daunting complexity and engineered their metamorphoses from colonies into free countries, working as a mediator rather than a ruler. He believed that the only way to teach people responsibility was to give it to them. Everywhere he respected the individual dignity of his subjects, never patronizing them, and never remote from their human condition.<br>
<br>Foot's next move to the United Nations was consistent with his experience and his passionate belief that the UN was the only alternative to the division and destruction of the world. In 1961 he became the British representative on the Trusteeship Council, with special responsibility for Africa. However, Foot could not support the Conservative government's policy on Rhodesia. Deeply troubled, he resigned in 1962, writing: &#145;I do not feel able to speak in the UN or elsewhere in defence of our position in this matter. I simply cannot do it&#146;. Foot was well aware that this might end his UN career. Yet his international reputation and popularity were such that he was invited by the UN to remain in charge of its own development programme.<br>
<br>After the Labour Party's victory in 1964 Harold Wilson appointed Foot minister of state at the Foreign Office, and ambassador to the UN (1964&#150;70). He was created a life peer as Baron Caradon (1964) and spoke on occasion forcefully in the House of Lords, particularly on the role of the UN charter in dealing with the world's dilemmas of violence and poverty. His efforts produced resolution 242 which formed the basis of the Egyptian&#150;Israeli peace treaty. In New York his energy and robust optimism could be demanding and sometimes colleagues and staff could not keep up with the speed of his thinking and vision of his arguments. He certainly tried to implement the ideals of the charter. From 1971 he was consultant to the UN Development Programme, a post from which he retired in 1975, but he continued to advise in the troubled places of the world. He had a rare adaptability to peoples and places, which he happily shared with his talented, dedicated wife.<br>
<br>Foot was appointed OBE (1939), CMG (1946), KCMG (1951), and GCMG (1957). He became an honorary fellow of St John's College, Cambridge, in 1960 and was sworn of the privy council in 1968. Foot was often regarded as a colonial governor who ran out of colonies. He rejoiced that every colony he governed became independent. He was at the axis of an old empire swinging through conciliation to freedom and independence, enfranchising more than 6 million people in twenty years. Caradon died on 5 September 1990 in Plymouth.<br>
