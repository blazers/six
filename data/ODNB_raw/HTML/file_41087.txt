<span class="headword">Hewer <span class="st"> [Ewers]</span>,  William</span>  (1642&#150;1715), <span class="occ">naval administrator</span>, was born in the parish of St Sepulchre, Holborn, on 17 November 1642, the eldest son of Thomas Hewer (<i>d</i>. 1665), stationer, and Anne Blackborne (<i>d</i>. after 1679), sister of Robert Blackborne, navy and admiralty secretary during the Commonwealth and subsequently secretary of the East India Company. It was at Blackborne's prompting that on 18 July 1660 the new clerk of the acts, Samuel Pepys, took on Hewer as his clerk in the Navy Office and as a domestic employee. The relationship with Pepys would mature into professional collaboration and lifelong friendship. In the early days Hewer was occasionally rebuked for small failings in dress and drink, but was soon the trusted aide and favoured companion of Pepys and his wife, Elizabeth. His private resources&#151;derived at first from his uncle but greatly augmented by his own efforts&#151;ensured his independence and from 1663 he set up in his own lodgings. He later gave Elizabeth an ornament worth &pound;40 when his official salary was only &pound;30 p.a. Pepys defended him against accusations of leaking office secrets and incivility to a bishop. In 1668 there was an awkward but inconclusive charge of corrupt dealing in naval supplies. In the same year Hewer competently mediated between Pepys and Elizabeth when their marriage was troubled. Hewer himself claimed preference for bachelorhood when Pepys offered him the hand of his sister Paulina; he remained true to his profession.<br>
<br>When Pepys moved to the Admiralty at midsummer 1673 he took Hewer with him as clerk; he became chief clerk in the following year. Hewer's private trading with the East India Company is recorded from 1669. By 1674 he was advancing finance for naval shipbuilding and by 1675 his fortune was reckoned at &pound;16,500. In August that year he accompanied Sir Anthony Deane to deliver yachts to the French court; during the Popish Plot it was alleged that on this visit he had passed naval secrets to his hosts. Hewer made a counter-accusation against the informant John Scott for betraying military information. Since 1677 Hewer had been deputy judge-advocate of the fleet and a member of the Royal Fishery Company. In 1680 he succeeded Pepys as treasurer of Tangier and in 1683&#150;4 took part in the mission to disband the colony. He and Pepys also paid a private visit to Spain. In 1684 Hewer became an assistant of the Clothworkers' Company, serving as master in 1686&#150;7. In 1685 he was elected MP for Yarmouth, Isle of Wight; his parliamentary activities (including membership of a dozen committees) earned him the recommendation of James II for return in 1688 for the parliament that never met. On 31 January 1686 he was named an inaugural member of the Shipwrights' Company of Rotherhithe. On 17 April he was appointed a special commissioner of the navy with responsibility for accounts. From 12 October 1688 he and Deane were retained to wind up the affairs of the 1686 Admiralty commission. He declined the king's suggestion, underwritten by Pepys, that he and Deane should continue the same work indefinitely as &#145;inspectors&#146; on the French model. The administrative framework was, he believed, already adequately in place. All that was needed was &#145;industry and knowledge&#146; in its operation  (Magd. Cam., Pepys Library, MS 1490, p. 384); Hewer had demonstrated his qualifications in both these respects. In 1687&#150;9 he sat on the commission of the peace for several counties. The revolution of 1688 ended his public career. He declined the oath to William and Mary, and was penally taxed. On 4 May 1689 he was arrested, together with Pepys and Deane, on suspicion of treason; he was released uncharged six weeks later. In November 1692 the public accounts committee exonerated him of mismanagement in the previous reign, and he continued to defend the work of the 1686 commission. He remained a successful businessman. In April 1689 his East India Company stock was &pound;3500; by 1702 he was worth &pound;24,000. He was deputy governor of the old company in 1704&#150;6 and 1708&#150;9, and a director of the successor body in 1709&#150;13. In 1701 he received a public pension for past service. On 15 August 1702 he was named a deputy lieutenant of Surrey.<br>
<br>In 1677 Hewer had moved to York Buildings, Westminster. Pepys came to live there in 1680 and from 1685 was householder, with Hewer his occasional guest. Hewer, meanwhile, had acquired an interest in a handsome house on the north side of Clapham Common, built in 1660 by Sir Denis Gauden, the navy victualler. Hewer secured the property in 1688 and filled it with &#145;Indys &amp; Chineze curiositys&#146;  (Evelyn, 5.427). Here Pepys came to live in his old age and to die in 1703. From then until 1724 Pepys's library was housed there. Hewer was Pepys's executor, and Pepys's heir later married the sister of Hewer's heir, Hewer Edgley Hewer. William Hewer, who had lived &#145;very handsomly and friendly to every body&#146;  (ibid., 5.111) and who had in particular assisted Pepys's wayward in-laws, was a benefactor to the school, church, and parish of Clapham. He died at his house there on 3 December 1715 and was buried in the church, where a memorial was erected.<br>
