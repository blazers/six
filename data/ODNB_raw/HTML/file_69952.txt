<span class="headword">Castilians in Edinburgh</span>  (<em>act. </em>1570&#150;1573), <span class="occ">armed political faction</span>, were supporters of Mary, queen of Scots, who held Edinburgh Castle (hence &#145;castilian&#146;) between 1570 and 1573 and for much of this period controlled the town as well.<br>
<br>The assassination of the regent, James Stewart, earl of Moray, in January 1570 sparked off a civil war between the supporters of the government carried on in the name of James VI, and those who supported the restoration of his mother, Mary, who had been deposed in 1567. Edinburgh remained in the hands of the Marians until October 1572, and its strategically important castle was not surrendered until the end of May 1573.<br>
<br>
<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15660/', "Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange (c.1520&#150;1573)")</script> was appointed commander of the castle by Moray in 1569, but transferred his allegiance to the queen's side, an action which particularly infuriated John Knox. The great reformer, who had been one of Kirkcaldy's colleagues and a fellow castilian in an earlier episode, the siege of St Andrews Castle in 1546&#150;7, prophesied that Kirkcaldy's reward for his treachery would be to &#145;hang from a gallows in the face of the sun&#146;  (<span class="italic">Knox's History</span>, 2.157). Kirkcaldy was a resolute and experienced soldier who after his capture at St Andrews in 1547 had served with considerable distinction in the armies of Henri II of France before returning to Scotland to support the reformers. Kirkcaldy's principal ally was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17838/', "William Maitland of Lethington (1525x30&#150;1573)")</script>, the former royal secretary, who, disapproving of Mary's deposition since he believed it would harm his efforts at closer links with England, had also changed sides. Under the threat of arrest by Moray's administration, he had welcomed Kirkcaldy's offer of protection and moved to Edinburgh Castle in September 1568. However, by November 1572 ill health greatly limited any contribution he might have made to the defence of the castle.<br>
<br>Other castilians included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17826/', "John Maitland of Thirlestane (1543&#150;1595)")</script>, the former secretary's younger brother, who supported Mary's cause throughout the civil war. Another was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13636/', "Alexander Home, fifth Lord Home (c.1525&#150;1575)")</script>, who had been badly wounded fighting as an ally of Moray at Langside in 1567, but who had transferred his allegiance to Mary in 1569. In the following year his main residence, Home Castle, was seized by the English, pursuing forces from the northern rising, and in 1571 Home joined the queen's followers in Edinburgh Castle. Another was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18550/', "Robert Melville of Murdocairnie, later first Lord Melville (1527/8&#150;1621)")</script>. Melville, a Fife laird with a strong protestant background, was, like Maitland, an example of how support for Mary often had little to do with religious belief. Melville's diplomatic career was already well established; he had been Mary's ambassador at Elizabeth's court in the aftermath of the Darnley murder.<br>
<br>A further prominent figure among the castilians was <a name="cosubject_77142"></a><span class="headword">Robert Crichton</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1585), <span class="occ">bishop of Dunkeld</span>. Crichton, the younger son of Sir Patrick Crichton of Cranstoun Riddel, had become coadjutor bishop of Dunkeld in March 1543, assisting his uncle, Bishop George Crichton, and had opposed the nomination of John Hamilton as his uncle's successor in the see in January 1544. He also resisted Donald Campbell, nominated as Hamilton's successor in March 1548, and was in office as bishop of Dunkeld by 12 April 1554. At the August 1560 parliament he had, with Hamilton, hesitated over the confession of faith, but had acknowledged the presence of abuses in the church. He did not oppose the confession, but was never reconciled to the kirk. His loyalty to Mary probably stemmed from a combination of his Roman Catholicism and his family's general support for the queen.<br>
<br>The castilians held the upper hand in Edinburgh for two years. They established an alternative administration to that of the regent, John Erskine, earl of Mar, and dismissed the Edinburgh town council. They were sustained by a financial system supervised by Kirkcaldy and two Edinburgh goldsmiths, <a name="cosubject_77143"></a><span class="headword">James Mossman</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1573)<span class="occ"></span> and his brother-in-law <a name="cosubject_77144"></a><span class="headword">James Cockie</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1573)<span class="occ"></span>. Both were well established, and Cockie had been deacon of the incorporation of goldsmiths of Edinburgh in 1563&#150;4 and 1564&#150;5. Mossman's large house on the High Street in Edinburgh has, since at least the nineteenth century, been misidentified as John Knox's house. Cockie had a network of aristocratic patrons, including the regent Mar for whom he crafted the &#145;Erskine ewer&#146;, an elaborate crystal vessel. Guaranteeing, arranging, and clearing loans was an established part of Mossman's business. Mossman and Cockie helped to keep the castilians afloat by advising in the evaluation of various items of royal jewellery which were pawned to sympathizers outside the castle. They probably also helped with the production of coins in Mary's name.<br>
<br>In June 1571 the castilians held their own parliament in the Tolbooth, the customary meeting place for Scottish parliaments. Maitland was able to boast to foreign courts that the Marian parliament consisted of the principal nobility of Scotland, while the regent's &#145;creeping parliament&#146; in Canongate, under regular bombardment from Edinburgh Castle, was representative of only a faction of lesser men. However, the creeping parliament began the forfeiture of the principal Marians, including William and John Maitland and their brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68145/', "Thomas Maitland (d. 1572)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17831/', "Maitland, Sir Richard, of Lethington")</script>], a process followed through in August by the regent's parliament at Stirling, where Crichton was among the forfeited, losing his see.<br>
<br>A truce between the two sides, negotiated in July 1572, was broken by the king's party, who used it to infiltrate Edinburgh and establish control of the town. When James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton, became regent in November 1572, only the castle remained in the queen's party's hands. Sir James Melville, Melville of Murdocairnie's brother, represented Morton at negotiations with the castilians, but Kirkcaldy was reluctant to yield the castle, even with a guarantee that the castilians' forfeited lands and possessions would be restored, without the restitution being extended to his allies in the rest of the country&#151;principally the followers of the Hamiltons and the earl of Huntly. In January 1573 Morton resumed the bombardment of the castle, then containing 160 officers and men. None the less it was not until the Hamilton and Huntly families were persuaded to return to the fold at the pacification of Perth in February that the regent could direct all his attention towards the castilians.<br>
<br>In April, Kirkcaldy and his followers were presented with their last opportunity for an honourable surrender. On their rejection of this offer Morton brought into action the English army and its artillery, which had arrived at Leith the previous month. The bombardment began on 17 May, and Elizabeth's ordnance gave the regent a decisive advantage: Kirkcaldy was forced to surrender on 28 May. Most of the garrison were allowed to go free, many of them being recruited shortly afterwards for service in Sweden. On the other hand Kirkcaldy, the Maitland brothers, Home, Melville of Murdocairnie, Crichton, and a few others were to be &#145;reserved and kept where the regent shall appoint&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 4.571), pending further discussions with Elizabeth. The latter, however, eventually agreed that Morton should have the final word on their fate.<br>
<br>Kirkcaldy of Grange, despite appeals for clemency, was hanged on 3 August, fulfilling Knox's prophecy. His brother Thomas, a prisoner since January 1573, was hanged on the same day, as were Mossman and Cockie. Mossman had been forfeited in April 1573 for assisting the rebels and for producing illegal currency. Most of the other leading castilians were given indefinite terms of imprisonment. Maitland of Thirlestane spent the next five years in various forms of confinement, but thereafter his fortunes greatly improved: once James VI assumed personal control of the kingdom he became royal secretary and subsequently chancellor. Home's life was spared only through the intercession of two of his kinsmen, the lairds of Cowdenknowes and Manderston, and he was not released from imprisonment until shortly before his death in 1575. Melville of Murdocairnie was reprieved at the instigation of Queen Elizabeth, but remained imprisoned for about a year. Crichton was committed for a period to Blackness Castle, and from December 1573 was bailed for &pound;10,000 into the keeping of Sir Walter Ker of Cessford in Edinburgh. From May 1576 he was allowed to live at Seton or another property of Lord Seton, or else remain in Edinburgh. After securing financial support from his successor at Dunkeld, James Paton, he was restored to the bishopric of Dunkeld on 22 August 1584. He died a few days before 26 March 1585, when the town council of Edinburgh agreed to the request of James VI that Crichton be buried in the church of St Giles.<br>
