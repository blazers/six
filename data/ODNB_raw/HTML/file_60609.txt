<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Man,  Felix Hans</span>  (1893&#150;1985), <span class="occ">photographer and art collector</span>, was born on 30 November 1893 in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany, as Hans Felix Sigismund Baumann, one of the five children of Karl Sigismund Ludwig Baumann (1853&#150;1914) and his wife, Johanne Jacobine Helene Hofmann (1863&#150;1915). His father, a banker like his grandfather, had been born in Riga, now in Latvia but then in imperial Russia. His father's usual language was German, and when this was banned he moved to southern Germany. In Riga he had been music critic for the <span class="italic">Rigaer Tageblatt</span> so Felix enjoyed a musical background. Years later this was to show in memorable reportage of performances by Stravinsky in 1929, Furtw&auml;ngler in 1930, and Toscanini at Bayreuth in 1930.<br>
<br>Baumann always remembered his first experience of photography as a small boy when the flash powder failed to ignite for his school photograph. At the age of eleven he owned a box camera and to economize on pocket money he learned to develop and print his own films. Dissatisfied with his photography and encouraged by his school drawing-masters he started to etch, draw, and paint. Except for a few snapshots taken in the First World War trenches, graphic art was to dominate his artistic life until he took up the camera again in 1927 or 1928. He changed his name about this time to avoid confusion with another photographer also called Hans Baumann.<br>
<br>In 1912 Baumann married Gertrude Jeckeln (1896&#150;1966). After the First World War he restarted his art studies in Munich. His autobiography is silent about the early 1920s, but in an interview he revealed that during the inflation period he had lived on his own smallholding growing vegetables. Dr Nachum Gidal, a photojournalist who had worked alongside him, recalled that Baumann had worked in a printing factory making lithographic plates which explains his complete command of the technical and artistic aspects of lithography, on which he became a world authority.<br>
<br>From 1927 Man was drawing illustrations for Ullstein's daily newspaper, <span class="italic">BZ am Mittag</span>. As it was published at midday, illustrations had to be prepared overnight. Man returned to photography to ensure speed and accuracy in his drawings, but soon realized that photographs alone earned him more money. He began contributing to more Ullstein papers, including <span class="italic">Tempo</span> and <span class="italic">Morgenpost</span>. In 1929 he met Simon Gutmann, the charismatic owner of the photographic agency Dephot (Deutscher PhotoDienst). Gutmann was one of the first to understand the nature of the &#145;picture story&#146; which was to revolutionize magazines worldwide. Man became Gutmann's chief photographer, a pioneering photojournalist: he, with others from this talented agency, provided hundreds of photo-stories for Ullstein's <span class="italic">Berliner Illustrierte Zeitung</span> and many other publications during 1929&#150;33. Through Dephot Man formed a long-lasting friendship with Stefan Lorant, a Hungarian Jew like Gutmann, who became editor of the <span class="italic">M&uuml;nchener Illustrierte Presse</span>.<br>
<br>In 1933 Man was working in Canada on a story for the <span class="italic">Berliner Illustrierte Zeitung</span> when the Nazis took over the Jewish-owned Ullstein Press; Lorant, already once imprisoned by the Nazis, left for England. Although not Jewish himself, Man did not relish becoming a compulsory member of the Nazi party and he too emigrated to England. Lorant persuaded the mighty Odhams Press to launch <span class="italic">Weekly Illustrated</span> and Man to photograph for it. Lorant found it impossible to work with the management and resigned after three months leaving the young assistant editor, Tom Hopkinson, in charge. Man left soon after to join the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, becoming one of the photographers producing picture stories under the name Lensman.<br>
<br>The dramatic change in Man's career came in 1938 when Lorant persuaded Hulton Press to start <span class="italic">Picture Post</span>. Man became a major contributor remaining even after Lorant, apprehensive of a Nazi invasion of Britain, left for America in 1940. Again the assistant editor took over; again he was Tom Hopkinson. Man was interned briefly in the Isle of Man in the early days of the Second World War and became a naturalized British subject in 1948. He estimated that over the years he produced between 150 and 200 picture stories. The exact number for <span class="italic">Weekly Illustrated</span> and <span class="italic">Picture Post</span> is difficult to ascertain as for years no photographer credits were ever printed and there is limited access to other sources such as publishers' payment records. An extensive but still only partial list appears in a National Book League and Goethe Institute booklet published in 1977.<br>
<br>Man held very strong views on how his pictures should be used, causing periodic disputes with managements. Between 1945 and 1948 he took few photographs, concentrating on his collection of artists' lithography. He wrote books and articles on lithography as well as editing the <span class="italic">Europaeische Graphik</span>, Munich, from 1963 to 1975. The climax of his collecting career came in 1971 when the Victoria and Albert Museum staged the exhibition &#145;Homage to Senefelder&#146; entirely from his collection (it is now in the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra). He married his long-term companion, the German-born Lieselotte Henderson-Begg, late in life, in 1973; there were no children of the marriage. He died on 30 January 1985 in Westminster Hospital, London, and was cremated at Golders Green. He was survived by his wife. Many of his photographs can be found in the Hulton Getty collection, among the <span class="italic">Picture Post</span> material.<br>
