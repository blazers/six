<span class="headword">Beauchamp,  William (V)</span>, first Baron Bergavenny  (<em>c.</em>1343&#150;1411), <span class="occ">soldier and landowner</span>, was the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53085/', "Thomas Beauchamp, eleventh earl of Warwick (1313/14&#150;1369)")</script>, and of Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1369), daughter of Roger Mortimer, first earl of March.<h2>
<a name="Earlymilitaryservice"></a>Early military service</h2>As a younger son Beauchamp was destined for the church and attended Oxford University from 1358 until 1361, receiving his first benefice, by papal dispensation, in 1358. It was probably in 1361, following the deaths in quick succession of two of his older brothers, that he re-entered the lay world. He was a knight by 1367 and in 1375 was made a knight of the Garter. In 1367 he fought at N&aacute;jera, on the Castilian campaign led by Edward, the Black Prince, and later that year he and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1841/', "Thomas Beauchamp (d. 1401)")</script>, now heir to the earldom, went on crusade to Prussia. In 1370 he fought in Gascony, in 1373 he participated in John of Gaunt's <i>chevauch&eacute;e</i> in France, and in 1381&#150;2 in Edmund, earl of Cambridge's expedition to Portugal, but, allegedly because of failure to pay him in full, he backed out of Despenser's &#145;crusade&#146; of 1383. In 1375 Edward III gave him a life annuity of 100 marks for his good service. He was also feed by his brother, who became earl of Warwick in 1369, but almost all this early service was performed in the retinue of John of Gaunt, from whom he received a fee of 100 marks in 1373. During the 1370s he was one of Gaunt's bannerets, but it seems Froissart is incorrect in stating that he went on Gaunt's Castilian expedition of 1386  (Froissart, 11.326).<h2>
<a name="Landedinterests"></a>Landed interests</h2>In 1369 Beauchamp was elevated far above the level of a younger son by the grant under his father's will of land to the value of 400 marks, mostly in the midlands. In 1372 his prospects were further enhanced: John Hastings, the last Hastings earl of Pembroke, then childless and at odds with his cousin and heir, Reynold, Lord Grey of Ruthin (<i>d</i>. 1440), willed almost all his lands in England and Wales to his cousin William Beauchamp. The exception was Pembroke, which was left to the king. Beauchamp in return was to bear Hastings's arms and try to obtain the recreation of the earldom. Hastings died in 1375 but he left an under-age son who survived until 1389. However, in 1378 Beauchamp was given custody of Pembroke itself during the heir's minority. He also had dealings in Somerset arising out of his sister's marriage to John, Lord Beauchamp of Hatch. All the same, his main commitment in England was to the interests of himself and his family in the west midlands. These had been enhanced in 1376 by the grant for life from his brother of the former Montfort of Beaudesert lands in Warwickshire. In 1386, moreover, he exchanged two Wiltshire properties left him by his father for Snitterfield, also in Warwickshire. In 1377 he was made keeper of the king's forest and park of Feckenham, Worcestershire, for life, and from 1380 he was on a number of commissions concerned with Feckenham. In 1383 he and his brother helped found the Guild of the Holy Trinity and St Mary at Warwick. Many of his associates were from west midland families linked to the earldom, and during the 1380s he assisted his brother in dealing with the extended conflict over Ladbroke Manor, Warwickshire.<h2>
<a name="RoyalserviceandLollardassociates"></a>Royal service and Lollard associates</h2>Beauchamp's history in the first part of Richard II's reign is interesting for a number of reasons. He was one of Richard's earliest chamber knights, appointed in 1377, probably because he had been councillor to the Black Prince (he was executor to the prince's widow in 1385), and was chamberlain of Richard's household from 1378 to 1380. During the early 1380s he received various grants, including a life grant of 200 marks a year in 1380/81 and the alien priory of Pembroke in 1383. It is through the royal household that he is to be found in the company of some of the &#145;Lollard knights&#146;, and he himself may well have had Lollard sympathies. He was certainly involved with several of these men and with other suspect associates like Sir Philip de la Vache. He had an appropriate background: Oxford cleric during Wyclif's time at the university, member of the royal household under Richard II, and service to Wyclif's protector, Gaunt. Among the more notable transactions involving Beauchamp and others from this group is a release of all actions by the wife of a London citizen against Geoffrey Chaucer for rape. However, the deed is a reminder that these men may have been not so much heretics as a close-knit group in Richard's household, some of them part of the highly educated literary coterie to which Chaucer belonged, where Beauchamp would not have been out of place.<h2>
<a name="RelationswithRichardIIandenhancementofstatus"></a>Relations with Richard II and enhancement of status</h2>Where Beauchamp stood in the turbulent politics of Richard II's reign is not entirely clear. As the brother of one of the leading lords appellant, he might be expected to have been an antagonist of the king, but he was also a member of Richard II's household, the object of hostility of both parliament and appellants in 1386&#150;8, albeit one of those not singled out for attack. If, apart from the Feckenham commissions, he was hardly used on government business in England, this was surely because he was on campaign for much of the time, and, from 1383 until 1389, captain of Calais. There he performed with some distinction both on land and at sea and was several times on diplomatic missions. As late as February 1387 Beauchamp and his brother were among the group given custody of the lands of the infant earl of Stafford. However, a hostile inquiry into alleged neglect and asset-stripping in Pembroke in 1386&#150;7 suggests that he had enemies at court. Although he was pardoned, the episode led to an informal arrangement by which he relinquished the lands to the heir. In 1387, as the political crisis deepened, Richard commanded Beauchamp to surrender the Calais captaincy. He not only refused but, according to Knighton  (Knighton, 406&#150;7), confiscated secret letters from Richard, carried by John Golafre, another chamber knight, requesting help from the king of France, and sent them to Richard's enemy, Thomas of Woodstock, duke of Gloucester. Later that year, Beauchamp refused to admit the disgraced favourite, Michael de la Pole, earl of Suffolk (<i>d</i>. 1389), who had fled to Calais in disguise, and returned him to England. He may well have remained in Calais as the crisis unfolded in 1387&#150;8 but he was awarded a three-year grant of land formerly belonging to Nicholas Brembre, one of the Merciless Parliament's victims.<br>
<br>Beauchamp's relations with the king in the 1390s are, if anything, more opaque, although this may simply reflect the complexity and unpredictability of high politics in these years. He lost the Pembroke custody in 1390, to the same John Golafre whose letters he had opened, and in 1389 he was again being pursued for waste, this time as farmer of the alien priory of Monks Kirby, Warwickshire. He was also involved in a number of recognizances in the early to mid-1390s, some on his own behalf, some on behalf of others, whose purposes are obscure but which risked the loss of massive sums. Some could relate to the alleged temporary imprisonment he suffered, for his disobedience in 1387, on returning to England. In 1394 he and his brother were among those who mainperned for the future good behaviour of Richard's great enemy, Warwick's fellow appellant, Richard (III) Fitzalan, earl of Arundel, on his release from the Tower of London. It was probably about this time, and certainly before 20 February 1396, that he married Arundel's daughter, Joan. While this might seem a rash political act for the brother of a former appellant, given Arundel's worsening relations with the king, it may have had more to do with safeguarding Beauchamp's interests in the Hastings inheritance; Arundel's second wife, married in 1390, was widow of the last Hastings and had a third of the family lands in dower. Indeed, Beauchamp continued to serve on royal commissions until 1395, he acted on several occasions for the courts of chivalry and, above all, between 1390 and 1392 he was able to secure a large part of the Hastings inheritance. Despite the claims of other Hastings heirs, which even Beauchamp's lawyers allegedly told him were hard to gainsay, he was able to divide the lands with Reynold, Lord Grey of Ruthin, the heir-general, to whom he paid 1000 marks for Abergavenny, while the king's acquiescence was secured by the bequest of Pembroke. As well as obtaining extensive lands over much of England, Beauchamp became Baron Bergavenny, and from 1392 he received a personal summons to parliament. He was now a nobleman of considerable means.<h2>
<a name="ServiceforHenryIVanddeath"></a>Service for Henry IV and death</h2>In 1397&#150;9, when Warwick, and others considered enemies by the king, became victims of Richard II's vengeance, Beauchamp again managed to avoid complete identification with his brother. He seems to have escaped almost entirely unscathed and he was even given some of the earl of Arundel's moveables in 1398. But he was present when Richard resigned the crown and close enough to Henry IV to gain access for Adam Usk to the imprisoned Richard II. Only a month after Henry's accession, Beauchamp was made justiciar of south Wales. As lord of Abergavenny, Beauchamp did not replicate the neglect he had shown in Pembroke. Indeed, he was twice besieged in Abergavenny during the Glyn D&#373;r revolt. The rebellion may have made the justiciarship too much for a man of his age and he was relieved of the office in 1401, although he was lieutenant in south Wales for six months in 1405 and apparently on active service. He and his wife obtained a number of grants from Henry IV, including the custody of the lands of his nephew, Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick (<i>d</i>. 1439), after his brother's death in 1401. From 1401 to 1409, to safeguard his own part in the Hastings lands, he assisted Grey's successful challenge to the use of the Hastings arms by Edward Hastings of Elsing.<br>
<br>Under Henry IV, Beauchamp acted for the first time as JP: in Hereford, as befitted the lord of Abergavenny, but also in Warwickshire and Worcestershire, where he remained an active force. As in the previous reign, his associates in these counties overlapped with those of the Warwick earldom and he seems to have had an amicable relationship with his nephew. However, when he made his will his decision to be buried in the Black Friars, Hereford, the Hastings mausoleum, shows how far he now identified himself with that inheritance, even though in 1385 he had granted advowsons to St Mary's, Warwick, the religious centre of the Warwick earldom. He died on 8 May 1411. His executors were his wife, her uncle, Thomas Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury (<i>d</i>. 1414), and her brother, Thomas Fitzalan, earl of Arundel (<i>d</i>. 1415). His will, made in 1408, is one of the earliest in English, perhaps another indication of &#145;Lollard&#146; tendencies, although it ordains a large number of masses.<h2>
<a name="JoanBeauchampsinheritance"></a>Joan Beauchamp's inheritance</h2>Beauchamp's wife, <a name="cosubject_50237"></a><span class="headword">Joan Beauchamp</span>, Lady Bergavenny  (1375&#150;1435), was daughter of the appellant <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9535/', "Richard (III) Fitzalan, earl of Arundel (d. 1397)")</script>, and his first wife, Elizabeth, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2778/', "William de Bohun, earl of Northampton (d. 1360)")</script>. At Beauchamp's death both his principal estates&#151;the lands from his father and the Hastings&#150;Bergavenny lands&#151;were held in tail male but, remarkably, both were left in entirety to Joan for her life. She enlarged her property further in 1420 with the primarily midland estate of the lords Botetourt, acquired from Hugh, Lord Burnell, husband of the Botetourt heiress. At her death Joan held lands over much of the midlands, East Anglia, and the south-east. Moreover, she and her two sisters were found heirs to part of the Arundel inheritance when their brother Thomas Fitzalan died in 1415, and in 1421 a council judgment authorized her to take &pound;80 a year from it. Joan contrived to remain unmarried and, with her unusually large widow's portion, became perhaps the most formidable woman in England over the next twenty years. As a woman her influence was local rather than national&#151;although she did appear before the council in 1421, as witness in the Berkeley inheritance dispute&#151;but it was exercised on a wide scale. She had already made sufficient impression in Abergavenny for Adam Usk to refer to her as a &#145;second Jezebel&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronicon Adae de Usk</span>, 63). However, she seems to have spent most of her time after William's death in the west midlands, in Leicestershire, where the Botetourt lands had given her a major centre at Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and in Hertfordshire and Essex, where, on the basis of the Hastings lands, and perhaps of her own ancestry, she seems to have taken over much of the Bohun following. Her closer associates came mostly from these regions. Remarkably, she held local office, as commissioner for loans in Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Gloucestershire, and Leicestershire, between 1426 and 1431.<h2>
<a name="ConflictswithWarwick"></a>Conflicts with Warwick</h2>It was in the west midlands that Joan Beauchamp had the greatest impact. Some of her energies were directed towards the defence of the Botetourt lands, a burden carried by her descendants for much of the rest of the century, caused by the number of claimants by heredity excluded by Joan's deal with Burnell. About 1418 she was at odds with the west midland esquire, Nicholas Burdet, a case of the meeting of two irresistible forces. But for much of the 1420s Joan's efforts were concentrated on her nephew, Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick (<i>d</i>. 1439). The reasons for this falling-out within a hitherto harmonious family seem to be these: Joan's growing pretensions in the midlands, Warwick's new alliance with Edmund, Lord Ferrers of Chartley, a power in the Birmingham region where the Botetourt lands were making Joan a major figure, and the conflict in Ireland between Lord Talbot and the earl of Ormond, respectively sons-in-law of Warwick and Joan. Although Joan stood godmother to Warwick's son in 1424, in 1425 her men were involved in an affray with the earl's men in which Talbot's brother was killed. Doubtless to Warwick's embarrassment, it took place at one of Joan's properties in the heart of his Warwickshire lands west of Warwick. In 1427, although the evidence is difficult to evaluate, she seems to have been stirring up opposition to both Ferrers and Warwick in eastern Warwickshire, where the earl's tenurial power was weak, but where she could exert influence from Leicestershire, perhaps in conjunction with other local nobles. Then in 1429 there was a minor confrontation with Ferrers, and in 1431, at Birmingham, a major one, involving sizeable forces led by Joan and Ferrers themselves. Warwick had been in France during much of this local turmoil and would have found it especially awkward because the Bergavenny clientage in Warwickshire and Worcestershire was still closely entwined with his own, but his return in 1428 enabled him eventually to get the better of Joan. Her own suits against Ferrers got nowhere, while she forfeited &pound;1000 pledged in an earlier recognizance to keep the peace. Thereafter she had to accept Warwick's rule in the west midlands, although she seems to have remained a force in Leicestershire.<h2>
<a name="Deathandlegacy"></a>Death and legacy</h2>Like that of her husband, Joan's will, made in January 1435, was in English and it has some &#145;Lollard&#146; characteristics. She died on 14 November 1435 and requested burial beside her husband in the Black Friars at Hereford, where, Lollard or not, she endowed a chantry. Their only son, Richard, earl of Worcester, had predeceased her in 1422, leaving a daughter as heir. Their daughter Elizabeth may have died unmarried but their other daughter, Joan (<i>d</i>. 1430), had married James Butler, fourth earl of Ormond (<i>d</i>. 1452), and it was this family that inherited the Botetourt lands, together with both the clientage and the litigation that went with them. The lands from the Warwick earldom and the Hastings&#150;Bergavenny lands passed by entail to Joan's nephew, the earl of Warwick. When the Warwick male line died out in 1446 they became causes of dispute, between Richard Neville, earl of Warwick, and his uncle, Edward, who had married Worcester's daughter (the Hastings&#150;Bergavenny lands), and among the Beauchamp of Warwick heirs (the Warwick lands).<br>
