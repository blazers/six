<span class="headword">Knox,  (Alfred) Dillwyn</span>  (1884&#150;1943), <span class="occ">classical scholar and cryptographer</span>, was born on 23 July 1884 in Oxford, the fourth of six children (four sons and two daughters) of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34354/', "Revd Edmund Arbuthnott Knox (1847&#150;1937)")</script>, a tutor at Merton College (later bishop of Manchester), and his first wife, Ellen Penelope (1854&#150;1892), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10167/', "Thomas Valpy French")</script>, bishop of Lahore. By any standards his family was remarkable, with the evangelical father and Dillwyn's three brothers: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31323/', "Edmund George Valpy Knox (Evoe)")</script>, for seventeen years editor of <span class="italic">Punch</span>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34359/', "Wilfred Lawrence Knox")</script>, an Anglo-Catholic priest, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34358/', "Ronald Arbuthnott Knox")</script>, Roman Catholic priest and translator of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Three years after the death of Ellen Knox in 1892 Edmund Knox remarried. Dilly, as he was called, went to Summer Fields School, Oxford, at the age of eleven and after a year was first in his election to Eton College. He went to King's College, Cambridge, in 1903 as a scholar. He obtained a first class in part one (1906) and a second (division one) in part two (1907) of the classical tripos. A friend of Lytton Strachey and J. Maynard Keynes, he was not an Apostle himself, although his name was put forward for election to the society. He was greatly influenced by Walter Headlam and inspired by his great love and knowledge of Greek literature.<br>
<br>When Knox became a fellow of King's in 1909, he inherited the then deceased Headlam's work on Herodas and applied himself to the fragmentary texts of the Herodas papyri in the British Museum. The inconsequential and bawdy mimes proved difficult to unravel but Knox was determined to succeed, exercising on them the scholarship combined with inspired guesswork which was to be his forte in his future career. Like his brothers, he was addicted to puzzles and a devotee of Charles L. Dodgson (Lewis Carroll). The sort of question he was apt to ask, &#145;Which way does a clock go round?&#146;, was pure Carroll.<br>
<br>Soon after the First World War broke out Knox was asked to join ID 25, the department of naval intelligence known as Room 40, as a cryptographer. By 1917 he had succeeded in breaking much of the German admirals' flag code, detecting, with his ear for metre, lines of poetry in the repeated bigrams of a message, which provided a crib. Instead of returning to Cambridge, he decided to continue working in Room 40, renamed the Government Code and Cypher School. On 21 July 1920 he married his former secretary, Olive Margaret Rickman (<i>b</i>. 1884), daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Roddam John Roddam; they had two sons. He finally managed to get the Headlam&#150;Knox Herodas published in 1922. Following German intervention in Spain he solved the Spanish military code and collaborated with the French on Italian naval codes used in Abyssinia.<br>
<br>Immediately before Hitler's invasion of Poland, Knox went with A. G. Denniston, the head of the Government Code and Cypher School, to a secret base at Pyry, where he was shown a reconstruction of the Enigma cipher machine, which was used by the Germans. The Polish replica moved the breaking of Enigma on from a theoretical exercise to a practical one and Knox always gave the Poles credit for the part they played. His own section, Intelligence Services Knox (ISK), which worked in &#145;the cottage&#146; at Bletchley Park, achieved some notable cryptographic successes, including breaking the Italian naval code which enabled the Matapan signals to be read in March 1941. Although absorbed to the point of stuffing his pipe with sandwiches when obsessed with puzzle-solving, it would be wrong to see Knox's code-breaking as a detached intellectual exercise. It was he who insisted that, in order not to compromise Ultra (the breaking of the German high command codes), there should be an immediate press release that aerial reconnaissance had made possible the important naval victory off Cape Matapan in southern Greece (1941). Although ill with cancer, he worked tirelessly on breaking the Abwehr (a German secret service) traffic. A typical short cut was the successful assumption that some indicators set up by the operators in the four machine windows were not random but girls' names or four-letter dirty German words.<br>
<br>Knox worked from his bed to the last, only getting up and dressing in order to receive the CMG (1943) from the palace emissary appropriately. He died on 27 February 1943 at his home, Courns Wood House, Hughenden, near High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire.<br>
