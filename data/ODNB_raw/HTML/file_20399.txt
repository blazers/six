</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Nugent,  Robert Craggs</span>, Earl Nugent  (1709&#150;1788), <span class="occ">politician and poet</span>, was born Robert Nugent, the only surviving son of Michael Nugent (<i>d</i>. 1739), landowner, of Carlanstown, co. Meath, and his wife, Mary, youngest daughter of Robert Barnewall, styled ninth Baron Trimleston of Ireland. Born into an old Roman Catholic gentry family he was educated at Fagan's academy in Dublin. As a young man he allegedly seduced his cousin Clare Nugent, who gave birth to an illegitimate son, Robert, in 1730. He fled to London that year to avoid marrying her and he always refused to recognize her child. When the latter subsequently became a debtor in the Fleet prison he published <span class="italic">The unnatural father, or, The persecuted son: a candid narrative of the most unparalleled sufferings of Robert Nugent jnr. by the means and procurement of his own father</span> (1755). Despite the embarrassment caused Nugent remained unmoved by the young man's plight.<h2>
<a name="Marriagesapostasyandfinancialsecurity"></a>Marriages, apostasy, and financial security</h2>Nugent became a tutor in the household of Justin Plunkett, fifth earl of Fingall, whose sister Lady Emilia (<i>d</i>. 1731) he married on 14 July 1730. She was the second daughter of Peter Plunkett, fourth earl of Fingall, and Frances Hales. She died in childbed on 16 August 1731, survived by their son, Edmund (<i>d</i>. 1771). Shortly afterwards Nugent abandoned Roman Catholicism to enter the Church of England. He had always lamented that his family estate in &#145;the wildest part of Ireland&#146; was &#145;great in bulk and small in revenue&#146;  (Jucker, 162) but even before he inherited it, on his father's death in 1739, he had greatly improved his finances through his second marriage, on 23 March 1737. His bride was the wealthy and twice widowed Anne (1697&#150;1756), daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6567/', "James Craggs (bap. 1657, d. 1721)")</script>, postmaster-general, and Elizabeth Richards (<i>c</i>.1662&#150;1712), and sister and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6568/', "James Craggs (1686&#150;1721)")</script>, secretary of state. Her only son, James (1715&#150;1769), from her first marriage, to John Newsham (1673&#150;1724) of Chadshunt, Warwickshire, unsurprisingly coveted the Craggs fortune and did everything in his power to prevent his mother's marriage to Nugent until she had settled &pound;50,000 on him. Her second husband, John Knight (1686?&#150;1733), had controlled one of the parliamentary seats at St Mawes, Cornwall, and owned a substantial estate at Gosfield, Essex, which he bequeathed to her following the death of their only son, John, in 1727. On his marriage to Anne, Nugent assumed the additional name of Craggs but a match that gave him wealth, landed estate, and parliamentary influence was not a personal success. Once it was obvious that the marriage was destined to remain childless Nugent made no attempt to remain faithful to his less than attractive wife and acted the part of &#145;a man of consideration, fortune and fashion, living in the highest company of the metropolis&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Wraxall</span>, 1.94). He also maintained a house at 11 North Parade, Bath, and amused himself by forming an extensive park at Gosfield, which in later years won high praise from Arthur Young. Poetry provided a further outlet when Alexander Pope, who was already well known to Anne, befriended him. Nugent's <span class="italic">Ode to William Pulteney</span> (1739), which described his religious conversion from &#145;error's poison'd springs&#146;, achieved great fame throughout the eighteenth century. However, Thomas Gray strongly doubted whether it was actually Nugent's own composition and the suspicion grew that he had paid David Mallett to write it. An initially admiring Horace Walpole thus recorded waspishly: &#145;Nugent had lost the reputation of a great poet, by writing works of his own&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Reign of George the Second</span>, 1.46).<h2>
<a name="Inparliament"></a>In parliament</h2>By the late 1730s Nugent had become embroiled in politics. Anne had introduced him to Lord Chesterfield, who encouraged both his hostility to Sir Robert Walpole and his election as MP for St Mawes at the general election of 1741. Horace Walpole soon noted that he was talking &#145;a prodigious deal of nonsense in behalf of English liberty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Horace Walpole</span>, 1.151). Contemporary correspondence is full of references to his frequent, sometimes chaotic, but often witty speeches. Shortly after his re-election for St Mawes in 1747 he was appointed comptroller of the household to Frederick, prince of Wales, who borrowed money in return for promising Nugent high office in his projected administrations. However, Nugent exasperated Frederick by clashing with Egmont over a possible accommodation with Pelham's ministry. This readiness to negotiate facilitated Nugent's reconciliation with government shortly after Frederick's death on 20 March 1751. The following May he supported the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span> and in June he successfully acted as an intermediary between Granville and Pelham, who both sought unsuccessfully to reward him with a lucrative office. Shortly afterwards he reintroduced a bill for the naturalization of foreign protestants, which he had first attempted in 1747. In Horace Walpole's characteristically partial appraisal of the occasion:<blockquote>The Irishman's style was floridly bombast; his impudence as great as if he had been honest &hellip; he affected unbounded good humour and it was unbounded but by much secret malice, which sometimes broke out in boisterous railing, oftener vented itself in still-born satires &hellip; Nugent's attachments were to Lord Granville; but all his flattery addressed to Mr. Pelham, whom he mimicked in candour, as he oftener resembled Lord Granville in ranting. (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Reign of George the Second</span>, 1.45&#150;6)</blockquote>Nugent also spoke in favour of the bill for the naturalization of the Jews in April 1753. However, he vigorously opposed the ministry over Hardwicke's marriage bill the next month, asking: &#145;Will you confine the great people to marry merely among one another and prevent them from getting a little wholesome blood which they so much want? Will you marry disease to distemper?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Buckinghamshire MSS</span>, 314).<br>
<br>As the general election of 1754 approached, Nugent's interest in questions concerning trade and navigation began to attract extra-parliamentary attention. In particular the Bristol merchants noted the sharp contrast between his championship of the out-ports and the silence of their existing representatives on such issues. They therefore invited him to contest the constituency. There was considerable prestige to be derived from sitting for the second city in the kingdom but Nugent demurred when the whigs requested a large contribution towards the likely costs of the election. With a safe borough of his own and a similar offer to stand at Liverpool he was able to drive a hard bargain. Before he consented the Bristol merchants agreed to indemnify him up to the sum of &pound;10,000, while Newcastle's ministry appointed him a lord of the Treasury on 6 April 1754. After a hard contest Nugent was elected head of the poll, whereupon he vacated St Mawes, where he had returned himself as an insurance policy. For the next twenty years he was &#145;intrusted with the nomination to every place and employment in the disposal of government within the city of Bristol&#146;  (Tucker, 16) and was careful to promote local citizens, in contrast to previous practice. Throughout the 1754 parliament he remained one of Newcastle's most stalwart supporters. He reiterated his belief in the duke's fundamentally honourable nature so frequently that on 12 May 1756 a nauseated Horace Walpole recorded that Nugent &#145;added his usual panegyric on the honesty of the Duke of Newcastle&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Reign of George the Second</span>, 2.193). Nugent remained at the Treasury until December 1759, in which month he was sworn of the privy council. In January 1760 he was promoted to the lucrative sinecure of joint vice-treasurer of Ireland.<h2>
<a name="Anewmarriageandnewallegiances"></a>A new marriage and new allegiances</h2>The late 1750s brought further changes to Nugent's personal life. He wasted little time when his unloved wife, Anne, died on 22 November 1756. On 2 January 1757 he carried off his third bride, the wealthy Elizabeth (1719/20&#150;1792), widow of Augustus Berkeley, fourth earl of Berkeley, and daughter of Henry Drax (1693?&#150;1755) of Ellerton Abbey, Yorkshire, and his wife, Elizabeth Ernle. Personal happiness, however, continued to elude him. Suspicion of his wife's alleged affairs led Nugent to disown Louisa, the second of their two daughters, and the couple ultimately lived apart for many years. Contemporaries were none the less so struck by Nugent's evident skill in marrying rich widows that Horace Walpole invented the word Nugentize to describe the phenomenon. Meanwhile the poet Richard Glover aptly recalled &#145;a jovial and voluptuous Irishman, who had left Popery for the Protestant religion, money, and widows&#146;  (Duppa, 47).<br>
<br>A financially inspired compromise ensured Nugent's unopposed return at Bristol in both 1761 and 1768. On the accession of George III he transferred his allegiance to Bute and Grenville, taking with him a small connection of quasi-followers, consisting of his son Edmund and three relatives through marriage: James Colleton (1709?&#150;1790), Thomas Drax (1721?&#150;1789), and Edward Eliot (1727&#150;1804). He soon found himself supporting contentious issues such as the cider excise and general warrants, while being lambasted as an unreliable, self-seeking time-server. As Lord George Sackville commented: &#145;Nobody can depend upon his attachment. His great aim is to keep his present employment, and upon the least appearance of ministerial jumbles he is in violent agitation till he has found a safe harbour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Stopford-Sackville MSS</span>, 1.95). On the formation of the Rockingham administration in July 1765 Nugent reluctantly resigned to pre-empt his likely dismissal. George Grenville was delighted to learn that they retained &#145;the same sentiments &hellip; with regard to &hellip; public opinions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Additional Grenville Papers</span>, 313) and together they opposed the ministry's repeal of the Stamp and Cider Acts and Dowdeswell's new window tax. On 7 February 1766 Nugent castigated &#145;those who call law option, and attempt to disrupt the legislative authority of this country&#146;  (&#145;Parliamentary diaries of Nathaniel Ryder&#146;, 290). Throughout his career Nugent strove to relieve Ireland of impediments to its trade. On 17 June 1766 he expressed his fear to Grenville that the <span class="roman">American Duties Act</span> would have an adverse effect, adding characteristically that this was &#145;the genuine production of the maiden and spotless Treasury. But I must not laugh; it hurts my bowels&#146;  (<span class="italic">Grenville Papers</span>, 3.249).<br>
<br>Yet only five months later Grenville suddenly found his friend's language &#145;so different&#146; and his opinions &#145;so contrary&#146;  (<span class="italic">Grenville Papers</span>, 3.382) that he could draw only one conclusion. Chatham had targeted Nugent as a former king's friend who might bolster his recently formed administration. On 4 December 1766 Nugent accordingly became first lord of trade, and on 19 January 1767 he was raised to the Irish peerage as Viscount Clare. On 27 February he &#145;spoke with encomium of Lord Chatham&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Reign of George the Third</span>, 2.299) in critical response to the manner in which the temporarily united opposition had just forced through a reduction in the land tax. Clare retained his post at the Board of Trade when Lord Hillsborough became American secretary in January 1768 but resigned it six months later, when he resumed that of joint vice-treasurer of Ireland. Thereafter he spoke on the government side on all the important questions of the period. In addition he occasionally addressed issues in a manner that revealed a surprisingly compassionate side to his nature. Thus on 2 March 1774 he intervened in a debate on a bill to prevent vexatious removals of the poor, in which he blamed the poor laws for the high number of executions in London. His Bristol seat was still generally thought to be safe in 1774, when he received influential support from the publication of Josiah Tucker's <span class="italic">Review of Lord Vis. Clare's Conduct as Representative of Bristol</span> (1774). However he withdrew his candidature at the close of the first day's poll. On 15 January 1775 his Bristol successor and political opponent, Edmund Burke, identified the key factor when he noted that any residual gratitude to Clare was &#145;not for his American politics, but for his attention to the local interests and commercial welfare of this city&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 3.96). Burke subsequently disparaged &#145;the disciples of Lord Clare&#146; as &#145;the worst sort of Tories, the Sunshine gentlemen of the last reign&#146;  (ibid., 207), and mockingly agreed when someone called &#145;the days of Lord Clare <i>Golden</i>; for to him (the member) they certainly were such&#146;  (ibid., 239).<h2>
<a name="Poetryandcharacter"></a>Poetry and character</h2>Throughout these years Clare maintained his interest in poetry. He eagerly sought the acquaintance of Oliver Goldsmith when the latter achieved distinction with <span class="italic">The Traveller</span> in 1764. Goldsmith subsequently visited him and a close friendship developed. When Clare sent him a gift of venison from Gosfield Park the kindness of a jovial Irish peer was immortalized in the posthumously published <span class="italic">The Haunch of Venison, a Poetical Epistle to Lord Clare</span> (1776). Clare continued to compose poetry, including the anonymous <span class="italic">Faith</span> (1774). His <span class="italic">Verses to the Queen</span> (1775), sent to accompany a new year's gift of some Irish manufactures, was reciprocated by the anonymous <span class="italic">The Genius of Ireland, a New Year's Gift to Lord Clare</span> (1775). More substantial royal recognition followed on 21 July 1776, when he was promoted Earl Nugent in the Irish peerage. Nathaniel Wraxall, who was visiting Gosfield at the time, recorded his impressions of the new earl:<blockquote>Of an athletic frame and a vigorous constitution, 'though very advanced in years, he was exempt from any infirmity, possessing a stentorian voice, with great animal spirits and vast powers of conversation. He was a man of very considerable natural abilities, though not of a very cultivated mind &hellip; He spoke fluently, as well as with energy and force, was accounted an able debater, and possessed a species of eloquence altogether unembarrassed by any false modesty or timidity. (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Wraxall</span>, 1.91)</blockquote>In addition he remained possessed of &#145;a coarse and often licentious wit, which no place nor company prevented him from indulging, and the effect of which was augmented by an Irish accent that never forsook him&#146;  (ibid., 93).<h2>
<a name="Abandonmentofpartyallegiance"></a>Abandonment of party allegiance</h2>Following his judicious retreat from Bristol, Clare returned himself for St Mawes at the general elections of 1774 and, as Earl Nugent, those of 1780 and 1784. His emphatic opposition to the economic reform movement led Lord George Gordon to call him &#145;the old rat of the constitution&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>), to which he responded by observing that a rat &#145;always cautiously avoided gnawing through the sides of the vessel: it never made a hole which would endanger the ship&#146;  (ibid.). He continued to speak frequently on American affairs. On 23 January 1775 he &#145;ridiculed the opinion of those who said we had a right to tax America yet ought not to exercise it&#146;  (Almon, 1.108). In late 1777, following news of the surrender of Saratoga, he outlined the enormous issues he saw at stake:<blockquote>The contest now was not whether America should be dependent on the British Parliament, but whether Great Britain or America should be independent. Both could not be so, for such would be the power of that vast continent across the Atlantic that was her independence established this island must expect to be made a dependent province. (ibid., 8.29&#150;30)</blockquote>Unlike some of his colleagues he was realistic and pragmatic enough to recognize a lost cause, even as early as 6 April 1780, and on 27 November 1781 he observed that &#145;it would be more advisable even to acknowledge their independency than to go on playing the same losing game against them&#146;  (Debrett, 5.41). News of the Yorktown disaster confirmed this conviction but he felt unable to vote against Lord North, with whom he resigned in March 1782.<br>
<br>Nugent's professed inclination was now to support measures, not men. Accordingly in 1783 he declined to be one of the sixteen founding knights of the Order of St Patrick and also refused Pitt's offer of &#145;an office of emolument&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 3.158). However, he seemed genuinely unable to grasp the deep antagonism between Pitt and Fox. On 29 January 1784 he praised both Pitt's ministry and Fox's abilities but reflected critically on &#145;the administration of a dictator&#146; who had been &#145;the author of the East India bill&#146;  (Debrett, 13.22&#150;4). On 20 February he urged a positive union between the two rivals. Recalling how Granville and Pelham had successfully resolved their differences over dinner and some fine wines, Nugent unrealistically offered his house for a similar purpose: &#145;They may even if they please get gloriously drunk. And I will answer for it, over the bottle their punctilios and distrust will vanish, while confidence will spring up where diffidence previously existed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Wraxall</span>, 3.305). In June 1784, only three months into the new parliament, Nugent took the Chiltern Hundreds and retired from politics.<br>
<br>In his final years Nugent returned to the Roman Catholic faith. He died at the house of General O'Donnel in Rutland Square, Dublin, on 14 October 1788 and was buried at Gosfield on 26 October. The bulk of his personal property, worth over &pound;200,000, and his interest at St Mawes went to his daughter Mary Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1812), who was created Baroness Nugent of Carlanstown in her own right on 26 December 1800. She had married George Grenville [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11490/', "Grenville, George Nugent-Temple, first marquess of Buckingham (1753&#150;1813)")</script>], by then marquess of Buckingham; he succeeded to the Nugent earldom, the real estate (which carried an annual rental of over &pound;14,000), and took the name Nugent.<br>
