<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Allen, Sir  George Oswald Browning <span class="st"> [Gubby]</span></span>  (1902&#150;1989), <span class="occ">cricketer and cricket administrator</span>, was born on 31 July 1902 in Sydney, Australia, the younger son and second of the three children of Sir Walter Macarthur Allen (1870&#150;1943) and his wife, Marguerite Julie (Pearl), daughter of Edward Lamb, of Sydney, minister of lands in Queensland. His sister married Sir William Dickson, marshal of the Royal Air Force. His brother died on active service in 1940. Although by birth a third-generation Australian&#151;his father's brother had played cricket for Australia against England at Sydney in 1887&#151;Allen was taken to England at the age of six, so that he could be educated there. In the event, his parents chose to settle in England, his father becoming commandant-in-chief of the metropolitan special constabulary, in which post he was appointed KBE in 1926.<br>
<br>It was not long before Gubby, as he came to be known, was resolutely English. After showing early promise as a cricketer at Summer Fields School, Oxford, he had three years in the Eton eleven (1919&#150;21) before winning a blue at Cambridge in 1922 and 1923. After two years at Trinity College, Cambridge, he left without a degree and became a stockbroker in the City of London. By 1923 he was making the occasional appearance for Middlesex and gaining a reputation as a genuinely fast bowler and no mean batsman. Of no more than medium build, Allen achieved his pace through timing, thrust, and a fine follow through. He made the most of an elastic strength, while managing, at the same time, to play the game with style. Between the late 1920s and the mid-1930s there was no English fast bowler, apart from Harold Larwood, capable of more dangerous spells.<br>
<br>Allen was essentially an amateur. Even when, in 1929, he took all ten Lancashire wickets for forty runs for Middlesex at Lord's, he had done some stockbroking in the City first and arrived on the ground too late to open the bowling. He never played first-class cricket regularly enough in England to score 1000 runs or take 100 wickets in a season. Not surprisingly, perhaps, it was in Australia, to which he went back as a member of the MCC sides of 1932&#150;3 and 1936&#150;7 and had plenty of bowling, that he was at his most consistent.<br>
<br>On the first of these tours Allen's refusal to resort to &#145;leg theory&#146; distanced him from his captain, Douglas Jardine. Despite that, he took twenty-one wickets in the five test matches. Four years later he took another seventeen test wickets at the same time as enduring, as England's captain, the mortification of seeing Australia recover from the loss of the first two test matches so effectively that they won the last three and, with them, the Ashes. On the tour of 1936&#150;7 a friendship developed between Allen and his opposite number, Donald Bradman, which was to last for over fifty years and to have a major influence within the corridors of cricketing power.<br>
<br>In the seventeen years which passed between the last of Allen's twenty-five test matches, at Melbourne in 1937, and his last first-class match, against Cambridge University at Fenner's in 1954, he played very little first-class cricket, even for Middlesex. This was partly because of the Second World War, during which he served, to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, in military intelligence (MI5) at the War Office, partly because of the time he gave to the City, and partly through choice. He did, however, accept an invitation to take a somewhat experimental MCC side to the West Indies in 1947&#150;8, a decision which he considered afterwards to have been a mistake. By then he was forty-four&#151;older than any England captain since W. G. Grace in 1899&#151;and he tore his hamstring (the first instance of many) on the outward voyage.<br>
<br>Elected to the MCC committee for the first time in 1935, at what was then an unusually young age, Allen became in time the <i>&eacute;minence grise</i>. As a cricket administrator of dominance and durability he ranks with the seventh Baron Hawke of Towton (1860&#150;1938), the fourth Baron Harris (1851&#150;1932), and Sir Pelham Warner (1873&#150;1963). For half a century there was scarcely an issue connected with the game in which he was not closely involved. He was chairman of the England selectors from 1955 to 1961, president of the MCC in 1963&#150;4, treasurer of the MCC from 1964 to 1976, a member of the Cricket Council from its formation in 1968 until 1982, a prime mover in founding the national coaching scheme, and co-author, with H. S. Altham, of the <span class="italic">MCC Cricket Coaching Book</span> (1952), the standard work of its kind.<br>
<br>Allen's other main sporting interest was golf, a game to which he applied himself diligently and which he played well enough to have, at his best, a handicap of four. His own account of a good round, stroke by stroke, was always something of a ceremony. As a source of cricketing reference he had no equal, and in the summers after his retirement from the City (he was a member of the stock exchange from 1933 to 1972) there was never much doubt where to find him: he would be in his customary place in the window of the committee room at Lord's.<br>
<br>Allen was appointed CBE in 1962 and knighted in 1986. He was awarded the Territorial Decoration of Ireland (1945) and the American Legion of Merit (1946) for his war services. Although he never allowed himself to be talked into marriage, he always enjoyed feminine company. Allen died on 29 November 1989 at his home, 4 Grove End Road, overlooking the Lord's pavilion in St John's Wood, London.<br>
