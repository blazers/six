<span class="headword">Shirley,  Walter</span>  (1725&#150;1786), <span class="occ">Methodist preacher and hymn writer</span>, the fourth son of the Hon. Laurence Shirley (1693&#150;1743) and Anne (<i>d</i>. 1782), daughter of Sir Walter Clarges, was born on 23 September 1725 and baptized at Doveridge, Derbyshire, on 7 October. His father was the youngest son of Robert, first Earl Ferrers, by his first wife, Elizabeth Washington. Little is known of Shirley's early life, which may possibly have been spent in Ireland, but he entered New College, Oxford, in 1742 and graduated in 1746. Almost immediately he was ordained and became rector of Loughrea, co. Galway. There he settled into the life of an Irish country parson. However, at some date before 1755 he encountered the Methodists, possibly during one of John Wesley's brief visits to Ireland, and was converted. In 1755, when on a visit to England, probably to see his brother Laurence Shirley, fourth Earl Ferrers, at Staunton Harold, he met Francis, tenth earl of Huntingdon, who provided him with an introduction to his mother (Shirley's first cousin), Selina, countess dowager of Huntingdon, whose efforts to aid the Calvinistic Methodists were just beginning. Family quarrels and legal disputes had disrupted the Shirley family and Lady Huntingdon welcomed the first member of her own family to follow her example and join the ranks of the Calvinistic Methodists.<br>
<br>Walter Shirley soon came to divide his time between Ireland, where he employed a series of evangelical curates to serve Loughrea, and England, where, with headquarters at Bath, he served the increasing number of chapels built or supported by Lady Huntingdon. Shirley was the first and probably the best of her agents in this work since his &#145;conciliatory temper&#146;  (E. P. Shirley, 199) enabled him to settle problems in the congregations and to soothe the countess's readiness to complain of their behaviour. She also consulted him about the affairs of the college which she founded in 1768 at Trefeca, near Brecon, to train evangelical ministers. In Ireland, Shirley met with increasing opposition, especially from his diocesan, who cancelled the licence of one of his curates, Richard De Courcy, and preached against Shirley from his own pulpit at Loughrea.<br>
<br>In 1770, after George Whitefield's death, Lady Huntingdon appointed Shirley to succeed him as one of her chaplains. Soon afterwards she entrusted him with the delicate task of trying to reconcile the differences between the Wesleyans and the Calvinists&#151;a duty formerly undertaken by Whitefield and Howell Harris. At his conference in 1770 John Wesley had again raised the question of justification by faith or works and implied that the Calvinists were antinomians. Lady Huntingdon proposed that Shirley should lead a delegation of ministers and laymen to the 1771 conference at Bristol either to meet with the members or to debate the subject afterwards. John Wesley reluctantly allowed the delegation to attend the last day of the conference and a statement was drawn up and signed by those present withdrawing the objectionable parts of the 1770 resolution. However, Wesley almost immediately insisted on publishing, against the author's own wishes, John Fletcher's manuscript &#145;Checks against antinomianism&#146;, which was written before the agreement. This revived the controversy and led to violent attacks by the Calvinists Toplady and Romaine on Wesley, despite all the efforts of Walter Shirley. It marked the end of all co-operation between the two parties.<br>
<br>Shirley's hymn writing and his part in the compilation of Lady Huntingdon's early hymnbooks is somewhat obscure. Julian lists only five hymns written by him, but it is clear from his letters to the countess that he played an important part in revising and improving the hymns and, in conjunction with Benjamin Milgrove of Bath, in providing suitable tunes. Shirley's only other publications were <span class="italic">Gospel Repentance</span> (1760), <span class="italic">Twelve Sermons</span>, with a poetical appendix (1761), and an account of the 1771 conference.<br>
<br>Walter Shirley married Henrietta Maria Phillips (<i>d</i>. 1792), daughter of John Phillips of Dublin, on 27 August 1766. They had two sons&#151;John and Walter, born at Loughrea on 26 September 1767 and 11 October 1768&#151;and three daughters&#151;Fanny and Henrietta, born at Bath on 6 May 1770 and 11 August 1772, and Ann-Augusta, born on 29 November 1775. Walter Shirley died in Dublin on 7 April 1786 and was buried in the city's St Mary's Church. He was survived by his wife, who died on 15 December 1792. His eldest son, John, predeceased him, leaving Walter Shirley junior as his executor. Unfortunately the family and legal disputes of the Shirleys meant that there was no family fortune, and attempts to improve Walter Shirley's income in his lifetime were unsuccessful. Lady Huntingdon gave him the advowson of Aldwincle All Saints, Northamptonshire, but the incumbent, Thomas Haweis, survived him by more than thirty years. Lord Dartmouth attempted to find an English living which he could exchange for Loughrea, but without success. As a result Walter junior spent much of his life as a penniless curate never far from bankruptcy.<br>
