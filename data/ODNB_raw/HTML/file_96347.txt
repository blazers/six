<span class="headword">Singuineau,  Francis Ethelbert Dominic <span class="st"> [Frank]</span></span>  (1913&#150;1992), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 4 August 1913 in Port of Spain, Trinidad, the son of Francis Albert Singuineau, provision merchant, and his wife, Ethel. He was raised by his mother and two aunts after his father died unexpectedly three months before he was born. He later said that:<blockquote>All the things I learnt, I learnt from women. I realised from a very early age, that I was very lucky in growing up in the presence of a superior, smarter, stronger race. I had a different vision of what life should be. (Lowenthal)</blockquote>Encouraged by his mother, he took an interest in drama and literature. He later described her as &#145;a marvellous person, a great organiser, she taught me never to think about myself. She taught me about life and love and charity&#146;  (ibid.). He was educated at a private school and then at St Mary's College, Port of Spain, where he developed a love of acting from a drama teacher. During the Second World War, he joined the staff of the Shell Company and took an active interest in amateur dramatics.<br>
<br>Singuineau left his job with Shell and moved to London soon after the end of the war, and gained early acting experience by working with the left-wing Unity Theatre and various repertory companies all over Britain in plays including <span class="italic">Deep Are the Roots</span> (1950) and <span class="italic">The Hasty Heart</span> (1953). He also made his pantomime d&eacute;but as Friday in <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> (1949). He made his London stage d&eacute;but in a production of Richard Wright's <span class="italic">Native Son</span> (Boltons Theatre, 1948), starring the Guyanese actor Robert Adams, and roles followed in No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">Ace of Clubs</span> (Cambridge Theatre, 1950) and Jean-Paul Sartre's <span class="italic">The Respectable Prostitute</span> (Q Theatre, Kew, 1954). His stage career continued into the 1980s with roles in John Steinbeck's <span class="italic">Of Mice and Men</span> (Leatherhead Theatre, 1967), Mustapha Matura's <span class="italic">As Time Goes By</span> (Royal Court, 1971), <span class="italic">Play Mas</span> (Royal Court, 1974), and <span class="italic">Playboy of the West Indies</span> (Tricycle Theatre, 1984), Christopher Hampton's <span class="italic">Savages</span> (Royal Court, 1973), and Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span> (Royal National Theatre, 1981).<br>
<br>Singuineau made his film d&eacute;but in <span class="italic">The Captain's Paradise</span> (1953) and went on to play numerous character roles over the next thirty years in a wide range of films. These included <span class="italic">Simba</span> (1955), <span class="italic">The Mummy</span> (1959), <span class="italic">The Nun's Story</span> (1959), <span class="italic">Peeping Tom</span> (1960), <span class="italic">Dr No</span> (1962), and three films directed by Bryan Forbes, <span class="italic">S&eacute;ance on a Wet Afternoon</span> (1964), <span class="italic">The Wrong Box</span> (1966), and <span class="italic">The Whisperers</span> (1967), in which he played the sympathetic doctor. In Jack Clayton's <span class="italic">The Pumpkin Eater</span> (1964) he made a brief but memorable appearance as the mysterious King of Israel. Later films in which he appeared included <span class="italic">Carry On Again, Doctor</span> (1969), Lindsay Anderson's <span class="italic">O Lucky Man!</span> (1973), <span class="italic">Live and Let Die</span> (1973), <span class="italic">Rollerball</span> (1975), <span class="italic">An American Werewolf in London</span> (1981), and, finally, <span class="italic">Biggles</span> (1986). He was also cast in a major role in <span class="italic">Pressure</span> (1975), directed by the Trinidadian Horace Ov&eacute;, believed to be the first feature film drama to be made by a black film-maker in Britain. Singuineau gave an outstanding performance as Lucas, the disillusioned shop owner whose old-fashioned values are despised by his son, Colin (Oscar James), who has become involved in the black power movement.<br>
<br>After his television d&eacute;but in 1953 Singuineau made many appearances, mostly in popular drama series like <span class="italic">Emergency Ward 10</span>, <span class="italic">Z Cars</span>, <span class="italic">Out of the Unknown</span>, and <span class="italic">Crown Court</span>. Three memorable plays were John Hopkins's <span class="italic">Fable</span>, screened in the BBC's <span class="roman">Wednesday Play</span> series (1965); <span class="italic">Armchair Theatre: the World in a Room</span> (1970), Emanuel Litvinoff's study of a mixed marriage; and Barry Reckord's <span class="italic">In the Beautiful Caribbean</span> (1972). He also appeared in hundreds of radio plays.<br>
<br>Described by John Tydeman as a &#145;gentle, charming, enthusiastic, tolerant, cultured, sometimes over-diffident, remarkable human being&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 22 Sept 1992), Singuineau was affectionately known by Britain's black actors as a father figure, always ready to offer help and advice. He had married, on 6 October 1954, Doreen Elsa Keogh (<i>b</i>. 1923/4), actress and daughter of John Keogh, publisher's representative; there were no children of the marriage, which ended soon after in divorce. Ill health forced Singuineau into retirement in the mid-1980s, and he died on 11 September 1992 at his home, 47 Loveday Road, Ealing, London, of heart failure.<br>
