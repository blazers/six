<span class="headword">Malleson,  George Bruce</span>  (1825&#150;1898), <span class="occ">army officer and military historian</span>, born in London on 8 May 1825, was the second son of John Malleson of Wimbledon and Lucy (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Nesbitt), whose father was colonial secretary in the Bahamas. He was educated at Wimbledon and at Winchester College, where he became a keen cricketer. Through Colonel Oliphant, a director of the East India Company, he was given a direct commission as ensign on 11 June 1842, and was posted to the 65th Bengal native infantry on 26 September. He obtained a lieutenancy in the 33rd Bengal native infantry on 28 September 1847. He was appointed to the commissariat department on 30 November 1852 and served in the Second Anglo-Burmese War. On 28 March 1856 he was appointed an assistant military auditor-general and was engaged in administrative duties at Calcutta during the mutiny. He wrote <span class="italic">The Mutiny of the Bengal Army</span>, published anonymously in 1857 and known as the &#145;red pamphlet&#146;. In this he identified Lord Dalhousie's administration, and especially the annexation of Oudh, as mainly responsible for the revolt. In 1856 Malleson married Marian Charlotte, only daughter of George Wynyard Battye of the Bengal civil service, and sister of three distinguished soldiers, Quintin, Wigram, and Frederick Battye, all of the Guides, and all killed in action. She survived her husband.<br>
<br>Malleson was promoted captain on 11 June 1857, major in the Bengal staff corps on 11 June 1862, lieutenant-colonel on 11 June 1868, and colonel in the army on 11 June 1873. He was appointed a sanitary commissioner for Bengal in 1866, and controller of the military finance department in 1868. In 1869 he was chosen by Lord Mayo to be the guardian of the young maharaja of Mysore; he held this post until 1877, when he retired on full pay with the honorary rank of major-general. He had been made CSI on 31 May 1872.<br>
<br>Malleson had been a frequent contributor to the <span class="italic">Calcutta Review</span> since 1857, and was also a correspondent of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. After he retired he devoted himself to writing, mainly military history, especially Indian. He had a broad grasp, great industry, and a vigorous and picturesque style, but was apt to be a strong partisan. He did much to draw attention to Russian expansion in central Asia and its potential threat to British rule in India. His many publications included <span class="italic">History of the Indian Mutiny</span> (3 vols., 1878&#150;80, in continuation of vols. 1 and 2 of J. W. Kaye's <span class="italic">A History of the Sepoy War in India, 1857&#150;1858</span>, 3 vols., 1864&#150;76), <span class="italic">History of Afghanistan</span> (1879), <span class="italic">The Decisive Battles of India</span> (1883), and <span class="italic">The Russo-Afghan question and the Invasion of India</span> (1885). Malleson died at his home, 27 West Cromwell Road, Kensington, London, on 1 March 1898.<br>
