<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Walpole,  Spencer Horatio</span>  (1806&#150;1898), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Epsom, Surrey, on 11 September 1806, the second son of Thomas Walpole (1755&#150;1840) of Stagbury Park, Epsom, British minister in Munich from 1784 to 1796, and his wife, Lady Margaret Perceval (1769&#150;1854), eighth and youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21912/', "John Perceval, second earl of Egmont")</script>, and his second wife, Catherine Compton, created Baroness Arden in 1770. His great-grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28595/', "Horatio Walpole, first Lord Walpole of Wolterton")</script>, brother of the prime minister; one grandfather, Thomas Walpole (1727&#150;1803), was a friend of Chatham; the other, Egmont, had led the parliamentary opposition to George II and the Pelhams; he owed his first name to his maternal uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21916/', "Spencer Perceval")</script>, the prime minister, and his second name indirectly to the Walpoles, directly to Nelson, the cousin and friend of his father. His elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28603/', "Sir Robert Walpole (1808&#150;1876)")</script>. At Ealing on 6 October 1835 he married his cousin, Spencer Perceval's fourth daughter, Isabella (1801&#150;1886), one of the beneficiaries of parliament's grant of &pound;50,000 to the family of the assassinated minister.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Walpole went to Eton College where he was prominent in the debating society and became head of the school. At election in 1823 he gave the speech which Lord Strafford had delivered on the scaffold; Canning, who was present and who had recited the same speech in 1787, congratulated him on the fervour and feeling he had shown. He was admitted pensioner at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 22 March 1824, had Whewell for his tutor, won the first declamation prize and the prize for the best essay on the character of William III, became an &#145;Apostle&#146;, was president of the union in the Michaelmas term of 1827, and graduated BA in 1828. But, from the published memoirs and correspondence of his notable contemporaries and fellow Apostles such as Maurice, Sterling, Monckton Milnes, Kemble, Donne, and Trench, it does not seem that he belonged to their inner circle of friends.<br>
<br>Walpole was admitted at Lincoln's Inn on 23 June 1827 and called to the bar on 10 June 1831. Like Spencer Perceval he practised in chancery, and with considerable success and profit. He was made QC on 2 July 1846 and bencher on 2 November. On 30 January 1846, at the height of the battle over repeal of the corn laws, he had been returned unopposed in a by-election as MP for Midhurst, where his cousin George James Perceval, sixth earl of Egmont, had the preponderant interest. In his acceptance speech he claimed that he would enter the Commons pledged to no party, while declaring his fixed opposition to reducing the taxes on corn &#145;by an atom&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 2 Feb 1846). When the Conservative Party split, he stayed with the protectionists. Since they were virtually without experienced leaders in the Commons, Walpole's ability as a speaker and capacity for business propelled him speedily into prominence and into the counsels of the party. He made a reactionary speech in the house on 8 February 1848 against removing Jewish disabilities, which was admired and published; in the following year he argued powerfully against the repeal of the <span class="roman">Navigation Acts</span>; and it seems that he was one of those regarded as possible alternatives to Disraeli as leader of the protectionists in the Commons in the confused period following Lord George Bentinck's resignation  (Vincent, 71). He did not aim so high, and continued to work and prosper at the bar, where he was &#145;a great power indeed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Law Magazine and Review</span>, 371).<h2>
<a name="Homesecretary"></a>Home secretary</h2>When Stanley tried to form a government in February 1851, Walpole was destined to be solicitor-general, though according to the <span class="italic">Stanley Journals</span>  (Vincent, 71) he was asked and agreed to take on the Home Office just before the attempt was abandoned. He now advocated dropping the party's demand for a return to agricultural protectionism. But he remained an unbending defender of the claims and privileges of the Church of England, declaring in a strong speech against &#145;papal aggression&#146; on 21 March 1851 that &#145;conscience is pleaded, but dominion is meant. Toleration is asked for, but empire is designed.&#146; The speech was published and &#145;put him up very high, and would enable Stanley to make him secretary of State&#146;  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 6.397). He went on to try to stiffen the <span class="roman">Ecclesiastical Titles Bill</span>, and on 2 June had many tory MPs whipped to support his amendments. On the day, however, he backed down, partly because of &#145;some legal difficulties, overlooked until that moment&#146;. This &#145;instant and irretrievable&#146; &#145;break-down&#146;, illustrating &#145;his self-acknowledged tendency to vacillation&#146;, infuriated his party (Vincent, 67; <span class="italic">Men of the time</span>). However, he was regarded as the obvious candidate for home secretary when Derby formed his first government in February 1852. It was generally understood that this meant the end of his active legal career and hence a great financial sacrifice. He made himself &#145;respected as an amiable and useful officer&#146; and piloted the crucial militia bill through the Commons; but at one stage he had provoked derision by proposing in the house, without prior consultation, to give all militiamen the vote, a plan which had to be &#145;withdrawn as abruptly as it had been proposed&#146;  (Vincent, 71). On 15 June he issued a proclamation forbidding the wearing of Catholic vestments and ornaments in public. Intended to calm anti-papal feeling, it was held to have contributed to the Stockport riots at the end of the month. It certainly enhanced his lifelong reputation &#145;as a zealous protestant prone to detect Jesuitism and kindred dangers in unsuspected quarters&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 23 May 1898). As a speaker he was described by Disraeli to the queen as showing on one occasion &#145;great taste and moderation&#146;  (Monypenny &amp; Buckle, 3.354), and on another as &#145;addressing the House with a spirit unusual with him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Queen Victoria</span>, 2.389), while Lord Henry Lennox called him &#145;the dear, the gentle Spencer&#146;  (Monypenny &amp; Buckle, 3.382). By the end of this ministry in December 1852 his public character was established. <span class="italic">Men of the time</span> (1853) described him as:<blockquote>one of the most sincere, as well as one of the most individually unobnoxious members of his party &hellip; As a lawyer, an essayist, a scholar, and a gentleman, Mr Walpole is respectable; but as a party debater, a wary manoeuvrer, a dexterous master of the prejudices and passions of a popular assembly, he is very deficient.</blockquote>He had acquired a reputation for integrity and lack of partisanship which, combined with his limited ambition and means, made it natural to think of him as a possible speaker from as early as June 1852, an idea which attracted him and which repeatedly surfaced both before and after Palmerston had John Evelyn Denison elected to the office in 1857.<h2>
<a name="Otherinterests"></a>Other interests</h2>While in opposition from the end of 1852 to early 1858 Walpole was a director of the Great Western Railway from 1853 and its chairman in 1855&#150;6, when he established a committee to investigate its debts, and he resumed his directorship between 1859 and 1866, taking the chairmanship again in 1862&#150;3. In 1853, at the instigation of the new chancellor of Oxford, Derby, he was awarded an honorary DCL at Oxford together with Disraeli, Malmesbury, and Stanley. He was active in the debates on the reform of the old universities. After a motion had been carried for admitting dissenters to them in June 1854, the Liberals, wrote Greville:<blockquote>imprudently pressed on another division in which they were beaten, though by a small majority, and this of course does away with a good deal of the effect of the first division. It seems it was Mr. Walpole who insisted on the second division, &hellip; and it was rather dexterously done. (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 7.167 and n.)</blockquote>His desire to maintain Anglican exclusiveness endeared him to the conservative majority of Cambridge dons, who encouraged him after the death of Goulburn to move from his constituency of Midhurst to represent the university, where he was elected after a disorderly contest on 11 February 1856, defeating the Liberal Denman. This was the only one of his thirteen elections which went to a poll, a subscription reimbursed him for the costs of fighting a petition to unseat him, and he retained the seat until he retired in 1882. He was one of the leading tories who, as against Disraeli, argued that they should &#145;support the Executive Government, because it is the Executive Government, wherever they can&#146; (in 1854) and &#145;give up &hellip; all mere struggles for place &amp; power, &amp; act on those Conservative principles of which we are or ought to be the exponents&#146;  (in 1857: Stewart, 290, 312). Before and during the Crimean War he was &#145;ultra-Peace&#146;  (Monypenny &amp; Buckle, 4.19), and in the political crisis of February 1855 he agreed with Derby that a government consisting only of Conservatives was hopeless. He continued to uphold the rights of the established church, arguing in a speech of 17 June 1856, which was published, that the national system of education in Ireland was obsolete and unfair and that schools of the Church of Ireland ought to be allowed to receive state grants even if they made the whole <span class="roman">Bible</span> available to their pupils. In these years, as throughout his parliamentary career, he resisted dissenting and radical attacks on church rates and put forward measures intended to settle the issue in a manner advantageous to the Church of England.<h2>
<a name="Homesecretaryagainandpartypolitics"></a>Home secretary again, and party politics</h2>When in February 1858 Derby formed his second ministry, Walpole returned to the Home Office, but only after making difficulties, complaining that on major issues such as parliamentary reform there was no party agreement. The cabinet's debates about its <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> were protracted. At one point Walpole and other dissidents sent Derby a &#145;Chancery brief, 87 folios&#146;  (Monypenny &amp; Buckle, 4.193) objecting particularly to the lowering of one of the county franchises to the same level as the borough franchise, and to the abolition of existing constituencies. Finally, with J. W. Henley, Walpole resigned at the end of February 1859.<blockquote>The House listened [to his rather bitter resignation speech] with an attention worthy of the gravity of the character of him who addressed it. A most elaborate, and carefully prepared essay was given to us. No smile lighted the face of any Member. After an hour &hellip; Mr W. uttered these words &hellip; &#145;How will you define the terms &#147;rotten&#148; and &#147;pocket&#148; borough?&#146; Quick as lightning Bernal Osborne said distinctly &#145;Midhurst&#146; &hellip; The effect was an instant and deafening roar through the whole House. (Fraser, 264&#150;5)</blockquote>Greville wrote on Christmas day 1859 that Walpole and Henley were now &#145;null&#146;  (8.276). In fact Walpole's resignation enhanced his general reputation, because, though universally known to be a poor man by comparison with most ministers, he had given up &pound;5000 a year as home secretary only a few weeks before he would have become eligible for a ministerial pension of &pound;2000 p.a. for life. Hence &#145;no man in the house is held &hellip; in higher honour than Mr Walpole&#146;  (Gurowich, 144n.). He had resisted attempts to send him to govern a colony. The absence of any but the shortest account of his life and career has no doubt had much to do with the neglect of his role: references to him seldom even get into indexes  (cf. Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>). But it is clear that he played a crucial though unusual part in the politics of this parliament. In the spring of 1859 he and Henley &#145;would have followed Gladstone if he had not joined [Palmerston's] government&#146;  (Morley, 2.31). During this ministry, recorded Trelawny, &#145;they sit just above the gangway on the 3rd bench, from which I infer their wish to be unamenable to D'Israelite discipline&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parliamentary Diaries</span>, 1.105), and Walpole seems to have acted as the unofficial leader in the Commons of those tories&#151;probably the majority of the party&#151;who preferred to allow Palmerston to remain in power rather than risk joining with the radicals or the Irish Catholic MPs, as Disraeli was tempted to do, to bring down the government. In spite or because of this semi-independent stance, Walpole was frequently consulted about party tactics by Derby and Disraeli throughout the years of Palmerston's second government (June 1859 &#150; October 1865). When Disraeli offered his resignation as leader in June 1860, declaring that &#145;the Tories &hellip; chalk the walls in the marketplace with my opprobrium&#146;  (Monypenny &amp; Buckle, 4.291), Walpole was among those mobilized to dissuade him. However, in May&#150;June 1861 he was only with difficulty induced to support Disraeli's line, which the party had adopted, against the repeal of the paper duties; Palmerston made him chairman of a Commons committee to consider the role of the Lords in financial matters, and Gladstone recalled that &#145;in the plan of uniting the financial proposals in one bill &hellip; Spencer Walpole gave honourable support&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gladstone</span>, ed. Brooke and Sorensen, 1.89) During this parliament Disraeli liked to boast that the Conservatives were now a church party for the first time since 1840. One reason for this was the determination of Walpole, a &#145;devoted&#146; church commissioner (1856&#150;8, 1862&#150;6) at a salary of &pound;1200 p.a. (Best, 431; Vincent, 193), to mobilize it against radical motions on such issues as church rate and clerical subscription. Early in 1862 he led the opposition to the government's revised code for primary education and secured numerous changes in it. At the end of the debates Lowe, the minister responsible, offered him:<blockquote>sincere acknowledgments of the manner in which he has conducted this controversy. He has had the good fortune &hellip; of having carried out substantially that which he proposed; and &hellip;, in the moment of triumph and victory, he has had the wisdom and moderation to stop short, and to leave to the enemy, almost lying under foot, the remainder to which he clung &hellip; It is a rare instance of candour, moderation, and good feeling. (Walpole, <span class="italic">Twenty-Five Years</span>, 1.513n.)</blockquote>Later in the same session, however, when on 3 June the Conservatives seemed poised to defeat the government on a motion demanding financial retrenchment, Palmerston made the issue a vote of confidence and, in Disraeli's words, &#145;my second in command [Walpole] lost his head and heart the moment the trumpets sounded for battle&#146; and withdrew the amendment  (Monypenny &amp; Buckle, 4.288). According to Stanley, &#145;Walpole's conduct is blamed by all parties&#146;, but was not simply due to his &#145;infirmity of purpose&#146;. The whigs had been courting him, making vague offers of the speakership.<blockquote>Personally, Walpole is poor, has a family, the pension is an object, and Mrs Walpole, &hellip; who with her father's narrowness of mind has much of his ambition, never ceases to urge him on. (This he has told me himself.) She is further stimulated by an extreme jealousy of Disraeli, as a Jew, and as having counselled the admission of Jews to parliament: a subject on which her feelings are fanatically strong.</blockquote>Stanley believed that Mrs Walpole had persuaded her husband to back down and that he had privately told Palmerston he would do so if the issue were made one of confidence  (Vincent, 186&#150;7). The general importance of Mrs Walpole's influence is supported by the story of Walpole's resignation in 1867 and by his remark to Hardy of 19 June 1858: &#145;I have consulted my Prime Minister here at home&#146;  (Gathorne-Hardy, 1.123). But Hardy's view of the episode of 1862 was different from Stanley's:<blockquote>Walpole has been put in a most unfortunate position, and I fear will feel Disraeli's taunts greatly. Still I am not sure that for the party he has not done good in withdrawing the amendment; for after Pam's declaration there would have been a good many defaulters, and so division within exposed. (ibid., 1.156)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Homesecretaryin18671868andpoliticalreform"></a>Home secretary in 1867&#150;1868 and political reform</h2>When planning a future cabinet, Derby agreed at the end of December 1863 &#145;that Walpole had behaved so ill that he deserved nothing&#146;  (Vincent, 203) but a month later was ready to appoint him to the &#145;Home Office long enough to serve for his pension, which object it seems he puts forward openly&#146;  (ibid., 206). After the election of 1865 and the death of Palmerston, his successor Russell's <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> provoked a split in the Liberal Party. On 8 March 1866 a meeting of Disraeli, Northcote, Cranborne, Heathcote, and Walpole agreed to work with the dissidents to defeat the bill. When this occurred in June and the government fell, Derby made overtures to some of them, but with almost no success, and so he formed his third Conservative cabinet at the beginning of July with Walpole again home secretary&#151;though there is some evidence that Derby tried to find an alternative. In the more technical business of the office Walpole had previously shown himself &#145;the most timid of politicians&#146; in the face of the opposition of vested interests to sanitary reform  (Lambert, 387). But in 1867 he brought in two bills which extended the coverage of the <span class="roman">Factory Acts</span> to many more trades and to workshops, thus affecting, he claimed, 1.4 million women and children. One writer believed that this was in his own eyes his most important achievement  (<span class="italic">VF</span>, 10 Feb 1872). By the time these measures had been passed, however, he had resigned office following &#145;the Capitulation of Hyde Park&#146;, the event for which alone he is generally remembered, especially because of its prominence in Carlyle's <span class="italic">Shooting Niagara</span> and Matthew Arnold's <span class="italic">Culture and Anarchy</span>.<br>
<br>The drama had two acts. The first took place just after the formation of the cabinet. Following the defeat of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> the Reform League called a meeting to revive the issue in Trafalgar Square for 2 July, which was first forbidden by the police and then permitted. The league then called for processions from all over London to converge on Hyde Park for a massive meeting on Monday 23 July. The government possessed a legal opinion, written in 1856 after an earlier confrontation over meetings in the park, stating that there was power to close the gates and exclude all citizens, whether aristocrats riding or poor men protesting, but no power to forbid just the meeting; and further, that, if the meeting became obstreperous, the police could only remove individuals as trespassers, with minimal force. Walpole concluded that the meeting must be permitted. The cabinet, however, would not accept this apparently weak course and, in order to stop the meeting, closed the park. The demonstration took place notwithstanding, the gates were broken down by the force of numbers, and the protesters occupied the park. Police and military were standing by. The president of the Reform League, Edmond Beales, and its council called on Walpole on Thursday 26 July and offered, if they were promised no military or police interference, to enter the park and urge the demonstrators to withdraw. Walpole accepted this proposal, on behalf of the government, provided that no violence occurred, and also agreed to give every facility for testing the law on the matter. He was then asked by a smaller deputation to allow a meeting the next Monday, to which he replied that he needed notice of that question. It was rumoured that he had burst into tears during the discussion. The league, however, called such a meeting, advertising it as &#145;by arrangement with the Government&#146;. Walpole denied that he had made any such arrangement, and Holyoake, one of the deputation, supported his denial, denying also that he had burst into tears. The discrepancy may be explained by Stanley's remark on 26 July: &#145;Walpole has acted sensibly enough throughout this matter: but his extraordinary manner, (when he spoke of the railings being broken, and a few police hurt, he was on the point of bursting into tears) creates an impression of weakness&#146;  (Vincent, 261). The meeting was held and, though it was orderly, Walpole was strongly criticized for having apparently confessed that the forces of law and order could not control the &#145;mob&#146; and for having effectively conceded the right to meet in the park. Derby spoke of &#145;this fiasco of Walpole's&#146;  (Monypenny &amp; Buckle, 4.452), but at the end of this act he survived in office.<br>
<br>In the session of 1867 the government proceeded in a zig-zag fashion towards drafting and passing a reform bill, Walpole showing greater flexibility than he had in 1858&#150;9 and accepting household suffrage. During the debates the Reform League decided to assert what they now saw as their right to meet in the park at a great meeting on 6 May. As in the previous year, Walpole explained to the cabinet the weakness of the government's legal position and favoured letting the meeting take place. The cabinet insisted on making some sort of a stand, and caused Walpole to issue a notice asserting that the meeting was illegal and urging people not to attend it, although they had decided to take no action to stop it. Beales went ahead, the meeting was held, the government and its forces let it occur, and there was no violence. The ministry was felt to have been humiliated. Disraeli had been especially anxious to avoid a confrontation with the league, and he was at least as much to blame for the withdrawal of the government as Walpole. Further, Walpole believed, as his son tells us, that Disraeli had been behind the main attack on his conduct in <span class="italic">The Times</span>  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Twenty-Five Years</span>, 2.199). But the matter was within the home secretary's province and he accepted responsibility. &#145;From his somewhat weak and vacillating manner there is a tendency to assume that it was his personal doing&#146;  (Vincent, 307). Derby did not want to drop him, recognizing that the cabinet was at fault and not wishing to make him a scapegoat. But Mrs Walpole made an apparently decisive intervention: she sent a letter to the prime minister saying that her husband was not fit to continue. Hardy, who liked and admired Walpole, recorded him saying &#145;he was so overdone that he really was not fit for his work, and would persist in going out&#146;  (Gathorne-Hardy, 1.215). He had by now qualified for a pension of &pound;2000 p.a. Kimberley wrote of his &#145;imbecility&#146; as &#145;almost beyond belief. The loss of a man so utterly incapable must be a gain to the Ministry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of John Wodehouse</span>, 202). But he remained a member of the cabinet without portfolio until Derby was replaced by Disraeli as prime minister in February 1868.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>For the rest of the parliament Walpole played a diminished role in the Commons, chairing the committee on the redistribution of seats and managing the <span class="roman">Public Schools Bill</span>. Thereafter, his interventions in the house were chiefly concerned with matters affecting Cambridge University and the British Museum, of which he was a trustee. He can be seen through documents in the university archives acting conscientiously on its behalf, as for example in trying to defeat a devious manoeuvre of Gladstone to establish a parliamentary commission on university property in 1871. Walpole's attitude was: &#145;When shall we have any quiet? Real study will never flourish in troubled waters&#146;  (Walpole to vice-chancellor, 27 Oct 1871). He had been made honorary LLD in 1860 and was high steward from 1887. It is singular that, on grounds of cost, he did not send either of his sons to university. His last years were a long decline and &#145;a period of oblivion&#146;  (Gathorne-Hardy, 2.367), until he died at his house at Ealing on 22 May 1898. His estate was valued at over &pound;38,000.<br>
<br>In one of the very rare descriptions we have of him, Ritchie declared that he must have been &#145;very good-looking&#146; in his youth, &#145;with his light, fresh complexion, well-chiselled features and clear blue eyes&#146;. &#145;He chiefly affects black, and might be taken for a country vicar of good family&#146;  (Ritchie, 46). More brutally, Bernal Osborne compared him to &#145;a high-stepping Undertaker's horse&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parliamentary Diaries</span>, 1.200). As a speaker he was described as weak, dull, prosy, pompous, solemn, but he was also lucid. &#145;His language is very musical and harmonious. When necessary, Mr. Walpole can make a good speech&#146;  (Ritchie, 46). &#145;Sir R. Peel is his model. Walpole is a goodnatured person in debate, but legal training crops out too much&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parliamentary Diaries</span>, 1.196). He was known for his gentleness and his personal kindness. That he was easy company is attested by his membership of the Club and Grillion's and his election as president both of the Literary Society and of Nobody's Club. He was FRS and FGS. He appears to have been deeply religious: his poem <span class="italic">The Saviour of Mankind</span> was privately printed in 1891. His only publications other than speeches were two articles on reform in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> for October 1859 and January 1860.<br>
<br>His elder son became <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36712/', "Sir Spencer Walpole (1839&#150;1907)")</script>. The younger, Sir Horatio George Walpole KCB, was assistant under-secretary of state for India from 1883 to 1907. A memoir by his granddaughter, Frances Holland, describes his life at Ealing Manor, in part of which he lived with his family while letting his Perceval sisters-in-law occupy the wing now called Pitshanger Manor at a nominal rent. Bought as a country retreat in 1844 for the sake of his elder son's supposedly weak constitution, by the end of his life it and its &#145;totally uninteresting garden&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Essays</span>, ix) were surrounded by suburbia. Walpole had taken a considerable part in supplying Ealing with amenities, especially schools and churches, and his funeral on 26 May 1898 at Ealing parish church was attended by representatives of many local bodies. The borough bought the house and grounds for &pound;40,000 from Sir Spencer after the death of the last Perceval, and the garden is now Walpole Park.<br>
