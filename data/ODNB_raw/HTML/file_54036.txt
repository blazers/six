<span class="headword">Clarke,  Edward Marmaduke</span>  (<em>c.</em>1806&#150;1859), <span class="occ">scientific instrument maker</span>, was born in Ireland. Little if anything is known about his parentage, early life and education, or family life. One source identifies him with the Edward Clarke who traded in partnership with Richard Spear, a prominent Dublin instrument maker, from 1815 to 1819 before setting up in his own right as an optician. This however would require a rather drastic reappraisal of Clarke's probable date of birth. He is thought to have taken an active role in the formation of the Dublin Mechanics' Institution in 1826. By the early 1830s Clarke was settled in London, working for the scientific instrument making company of Watkins and Hill, who were among the largest London dealers in philosophical apparatus, specializing among other things in electromagnetic apparatus. Clarke was employed by Watkins and Hill to investigate the possibility of producing locomotion by means of electricity, an area of increasing interest among London's practical electricians.<br>
<br>Not long after arriving in London Clarke set up an instrument making company in his own right. Within a few years he was embroiled in controversy with Francis Watkins (of Watkins and Hill) and in particular with his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, the American instrument maker Joseph Saxton, over the invention of the magneto-electric machine. In 1833 Saxton had developed such a machine, in which coils of wire fixed in front of the poles of a horseshoe magnet were rotated to produce an electric current. The machine was demonstrated at the Cambridge meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in June 1833 and later put on display at the Adelaide Gallery, as the National Gallery of Practical Science was known, where Saxton was employed as an instrument maker. Watkins had been instrumental in staving off charges that Saxton had been guilty of plagiarizing the machine from one developed by the French instrument maker Hippolyte Pixii. A few years later Clarke put his own version of the magneto-electric machine (or magnetic electrical machine as he described it) on the market, writing extensive descriptions in the scientific press to advertise his new product. Saxton publicly accused Clarke of piracy, alleging that his machine was simply a variation of Saxton's own invention and that no experiment could be conducted with it that could not equally well be carried out with Saxton's. In the spring of 1837 Clarke played a key role in the foundation of the short-lived Electrical Society of London. The society's first meeting was held at his shop on the Lowther Arcade near the Strand. The establishment of the society was inspired by the electrician and popular lecturer William Sturgeon, in whose recently founded <span class="italic">Annals of Electricity</span> Clarke had published a detailed account of his magnetic electrical machine. The society's meetings soon moved from Clarke's &#145;Laboratory of Science&#146; to the Adelaide Gallery, which also had its premises on the Lowther Arcade.<br>
<br>By the mid-1840s Clarke appears to have largely abandoned his scientific instrument business; he was in any case the proprietor of the Rodney Iron Works in Battersea by 1845. In the early 1850s he embarked upon another ambitious project. He was the projector and then the first proprietor of the Royal Panopticon of Science and Art in Leicester Square, which, having been granted a royal charter on 21 February 1850, opened to the public on 16 March 1854. A building in Saracenic style, designed by the architect T. Hayter Lewis, was constructed to house the new exhibition. The panopticon was based on two previous institutions established during the 1830s, the National Gallery of Practical Science and the Royal Polytechnic Institution. Both those institutions had been established with the aim of exhibiting the latest in science and invention to the public. Although the Adelaide Gallery had been converted into a casino in 1845, the Royal Polytechnic Institution was still a going concern in the 1850s. Clarke was the resident proprietor of the panopticon until his resignation in 1856. Shortly afterwards the panopticon itself closed down, and the building became the premises of the Alhambra Palace. Clarke died of apoplexy at 4 Birchin Lane, Cornhill, in the City of London, on 26 January 1859.<br>
