<span class="headword">Hill, Sir  Stephen John</span>  (1809&#150;1891), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, born on 10 June 1809, was the son of Major William Hill and his wife, Sarah. He entered the army in 1823, became lieutenant in 1825, and was promoted captain in 1842. On 30 November 1829 he married Sarah Ann, the daughter of William Vesey Munnings, chief justice of the Bahamas. In 1849 he commanded an expedition which proceeded 80 miles up the River Gambia. On 6 May he stormed and destroyed the fortified town of Bambacoo, and on the following day attacked and partially destroyed the fortified town of Keenung; he also fought a successful action on the plains of Quenella. He commanded a detachment of the 2nd and 3rd West India regiments in a successful attack by the British and French naval and land forces under Commodore Fanshawe on the pirates of the island of Basis, on the Jeba River, west Africa. For this service he received the thanks of the lords of the Admiralty and the brevet rank of major.<br>
<br>On 1 April 1851 Hill was appointed governor and commander-in-chief of the Gold Coast. The following year the protected chiefs consented to a poll tax on their people to defray the cost of administration, and a local force was raised for the defence of the colony under the name of the Gold Coast corps. On 6 November 1854 Hill was nominated lieutenant-governor of Sierra Leone, and on 21 November he was appointed colonel of the 2nd West India regiment. He remained there until 1859, undertaking two successful expeditions up the Great Scarcies River in January 1858 and February 1859. In July 1860, having been made CB, he returned as governor-in-chief. Ill health compelled him to return to England on 21 July 1862, when he left his son, Lieutenant-Colonel William Hill, as acting governor. His second term of administration was marked by the annexation of British Quiah in April 1861 and British Sherbro in November 1861.<br>
<br>On 9 February 1863 Hill assumed the office of captain-general and governor-in-chief of the Leeward and Caribbee Islands, where he remained until 1869. He was then moved to Newfoundland. The province's vote against confederation in that November was a source of annoyance to him, but he accepted the result. Acting always on the advice of his executive council, he was a trusted and popular governor. He married for the second time on 3 August 1871. His wife, who was to survive him, was Louisa Gordon, the daughter of John Sheil (<i>d</i>. 1847), chief justice of Antigua. In 1874 Hill was made KCMG, and he retired from active service in 1876. He died in London, at his home, 72 Sutherland Avenue, Maida Vale, on 20 October 1891.<br>
