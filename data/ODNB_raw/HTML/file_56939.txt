<span class="headword">Lee,  Margaret Lucy</span>  (1871&#150;1955), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born at Hartley Wintney, Hampshire, on 14 July 1871, the elder of the two daughters of Revd Thomas William Lee (1833/4&#150;1921) and his wife, Margaret Anne, daughter of Revd C. H. Lyon of Glen Ogil. Her father was headmaster of Hartford House, a preparatory school, but in 1875 became vicar of Leafield, near Witney, Oxfordshire. Lucy, as she was known at home, was taught to read by her mother, and by the age of six she had read much of <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>. She was then educated by governesses, from whom she gained a good knowledge of French and German. By the time she was twelve, the experience of taking a Sunday school class convinced her that teaching was her vocation. In 1888 she was sent to a fashionable girls' school in Warrington Crescent, London, where she formed a close relationship with one of the teachers, Miss Annie Sophia Batty (<i>d</i>. 1934). This developed into &#145;the most lasting intimate relationship of her life&#146;  (Lee, 11). She left Warrington Crescent in December 1889, determined to go to Oxford and then to return to assist Miss Batty in her teaching.<br>
<br>In 1890, overcoming her father's doubts about the value of higher education for women, Margaret Lee entered St Hugh's Hall, Oxford, a college particularly suitable for her, since it had been founded by Elizabeth Wordsworth specifically to cater for those (especially daughters of the clergy) who could not afford the fees at Lady Margaret Hall. She studied English literature under Professor A. S. Napier and philology under Professor Joseph Wright, gaining first-class honours in English in the Oxford University examination for women in 1892. This successful result appeased her father, who permitted her to remain at Oxford a further term, reading German and French and assisting Joseph Wright in preparing his grammatical works for the press. She also produced an edition, from a manuscript in the Bodleian Library, of <span class="italic">Narcissus: a Twelfe Night Merriment</span> (1893).<br>
<br>After teaching for two years with Miss Batty at Warrington Crescent, Miss Lee returned to Oxford in 1895 as vice-principal of St Hugh's, a post she held until 1896. In 1897 she became a lecturer in Middle English to the Association for Promoting the Education of Women in Oxford, which provided the bulk of teaching for women students. In 1898, at the invitation of Lilian Faithfull, she was appointed a part-time lecturer at King's College for Women, London, where her pupils included Edith Morley and Caroline Spurgeon. She resigned this in 1919. From 1915 until 1926 she also held a lectureship at University College, Reading. At Oxford, where she graduated MA by decree in October 1920 when degrees were opened to women, she was tutor in English to the Society of Oxford Students, comprising women students at Oxford living at home or lodging with families in the city, from 1913 to 1926. She never published original literary or philological work; teaching absorbed all her creative energies.<br>
<br>In addition to her work as a university lecturer, Margaret Lee founded with Miss Batty a private school at Oxford, originally intended for the daughters of dons. It grew rapidly and, after several moves, settled at 74 Banbury Road in 1918, when it became known as Wychwood School. The school (which was the subject of an article in <span class="italic">Queen</span> magazine, 3 September 1922) broke away from many of the conventions of contemporary girls' schools. A form of self-government was adopted, key decisions being made at weekly meetings of the school council, which included elected representatives of the pupils. Arts, crafts, and drama were encouraged. Former pupils at Wychwood recalled her Monday morning addresses to the school (which conveyed both practical sense and her enthusiasm for causes aimed at the betterment of mankind), her &#145;expressive bright blue eyes&#146;, and her taste for &#145;beflowered or beribboned&#146; hats  (Lee, 24&#150;5). She was a vegetarian and teetotaller. Remaining as co-principal of Wychwood School until 1954, she was a notable example of those late Victorian college-educated women who set out to improve the tradition of girls' private school education. Margaret Lee died, unmarried, at her home, 77 Banbury Road, Oxford, on 26 December 1955.<br>
