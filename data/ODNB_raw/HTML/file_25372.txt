<span class="headword">Sheridan,  Thomas <span class="st"> [Tom]</span></span>  (1775&#150;1817), <span class="occ">actor and soldier</span>, was born at Orchard Street, London, on 17 November 1775, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25367/', "Richard Brinsley Sheridan (1751&#150;1816)")</script> and his first wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25364/', "Elizabeth Ann (Eliza) Linley (1754&#150;1792)")</script>. His father described him at two months old in typically glowing terms to his maternal grandfather Thomas Linley as having &#145;talents for music and the most perfect integrity of mind&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.101). He sent the boy to Dr Samuel Parr (who had taught him and been kind to him when he was a pupil at Harrow) at the school Parr set up at Hatton in Warwickshire in 1786. Parr, at Richard Sheridan's request, broke the news to Tom that he was to go to Hotwells, Bristol, where his mother was dying.<br>
<br>After her death, while Tom was a great comfort to his father, he was also running wild at Sheridan's mansion in Isleworth, so Sheridan arranged that William Smyth, a recent graduate from Peterhouse and later professor of modern history at Cambridge, should tutor him. Smyth's <span class="italic">Memoir of Mr Sheridan</span> (1840) described Richard Sheridan as over-fussy about his son, citing his neurotic anxiety when the tutor allowed Tom to skate on ice he thought strong enough to support a wagon. Charles Grey told Sheridan he should have a glass case made for Tom.<br>
<br>Smyth records Tom's reaction to his father's telling him he was going to marry Hecca, as he called Hester Jane Ogle, a frisky girl of nineteen, making out in two hours' talking that it was the most sensible thing he could do: &#145;Was this not very clever of him? Well, my dear Mr S., you should have been tutor to him. I am incomparably the most rational of the two.&#146; Smyth describes Tom at Cambridge as the idol of the young men who pronounced him the cleverest man in the place. Cambridge was &#145;a great expense&#146; and the ruin of all Smyth's schemes for Tom's education.<br>
<br>The question of what Tom was to make of his life was bound up with his father's theatrical and political fortunes. The easy-going Tom was charming and intelligent, but lacked his father's driving ambition and hoped his father, with whom he got on well, would buy him a seat in parliament. Richard Sheridan did better: he got the prince of Wales to finance Tom's three electoral failures, at Liskeard and Stafford. The duke of York offered Tom a post as aide-de-camp, at the king's &#145;express commands&#146;, but his father told him to refuse this. Richard Sheridan was himself being courted by the king and his friend Henry Addington, prime minister since 1801, who wanted him in his administration. Fox and the prince both pressed Richard Sheridan to accept office if only to provide for Tom. On his father's advice Tom rejected the surveyorship of the duchy of Cornwall and the registrarship of the vice-admiralty court in Malta before accepting a cornetcy in the prince of Wales's own regiment, the 10th light dragoons, and becoming aide-de-camp to Lord Moira when he became commander-in-chief, Scotland, in 1803.<br>
<br>In Edinburgh, Tom's affair with Mrs Peter Campbell led to his being sued for and pleading guilty to criminal conversation. The case brought him into some ridicule, Mary Brotherton, the housekeeper, testifying that Tom in his uniform had been at the house when Mr Campbell was in London, leaving only at the housekeeper's threat to shoot him if he didn't leave at once. Campbell was awarded &pound;1500, which Sheridan paid, borrowing the large sum from the Drury Lane actors.<br>
<br>Tom then ran away with Caroline Henrietta Callander (1779&#150;1851) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25362/', "Sheridan, Caroline Henrietta")</script>], marrying her on 21 June 1805. Richard Sheridan pronounced his daughter-in-law lovely and engaging. Tom and she had four sons and three daughters. The eldest son, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, followed family tradition and ran away with Marcia Maria, daughter of Lieutenant-General Sir Colquhoun Grant, a considerable heiress; he sat in parliament from 1845 to 1868 (his son Algernon Thomas Brinsley Sheridan merely resided comfortably in his paternal grandfather's place, Frampton Court in Dorset). The three daughters also married well: the eldest became Lady Dufferin and later countess of Gifford; the second Caroline Norton and later Lady Stirling Maxwell; and the third Lady Seymour and later duchess of Somerset.<br>
<br>Richard Sheridan, appointed receiver-general of the duchy of Cornwall by the prince in 1804, tried in vain to get the prince to transfer the position to the newly married Tom. He had provided handsomely for his other son, Charles, but Tom's financial future still remained a problem. Finally Tom became muster-master general in Ireland in 1806, in which year Richard Sheridan gave him a quarter-share in the Drury Lane Theatre. Tom came back from Ireland to canvass Stafford unsuccessfully in 1806 and 1807. Tom, now sole manager of Drury Lane, negotiated skilfully with the lord chancellor to warn off potential rivals, the non-patent holders; at the same time he became joint proprietor and sole manager of the Lyceum Theatre. A good singer and comic actor, he had inherited the Linley family's musical talents and the Sheridans' literary skills. His poem on the loss of the <i>Saldanha</i> was praised; he wrote <span class="italic">Descriptions of Characters</span> (1808), &#145;a grand ballet of action&#146; staged in Drury Lane, and his melodrama <span class="italic">The Russian</span> first staged on 13 May 1813 ran for ten further performances.<br>
<br>That production, however, came after the disastrous fire of February 1808 destroyed Drury Lane. The prince provided &pound;1000 and the dukes of Bedford and Devon &pound;500 each to help Tom through the financial crisis. His health was growing worse: he had inherited the tuberculosis that killed his mother. A stay at Puerto de Santa Maria improved his breathing&#151;a debt of &pound;1400 was cancelled by his father's efforts on his return&#151;but the next year Sicily's climate did not ameliorate his condition.<br>
<br>Both Tom and his father had refused to receive any of the funds they were due until the new Drury Lane Theatre was built (both were excluded from any say in it), but in November 1811 Richard Sheridan told Tom that he would get &#145;&pound;12,000 clear&#146;, adding that this was &#145;the last sum of money in the shape of profit any man will ever get out of a THEATRE&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 3.134). In a letter to his uncle Charles Ward, Tom had earlier blamed his father for what was probably his own lack of independence and ambition, by saying that Richard Sheridan constantly pointed at the theatre as Tom's ultimate object; it was to be his, and so, he said, he had been excluded from all other pursuits.<br>
<br>By February 1812 Tom described himself as &#145;ill in health and spirits and as thin as a Highland crop of oats&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 3.177n.). He tried Madeira again, and then the duke of York obtained for him the post of colonial treasurer at the Cape of Good Hope, supposedly beneficial for lung complaints. (There was no atom of obligation to the prince or his ministers, his father told him cheerfully.) Taking their daughter Helen with them, Tom and his wife left their other children in the care of relatives and sailed for the Cape in 1813. There Tom died of consumption on 12 September 1817.<br>
