<span class="headword">Forbes family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1400&#150;<em>c.</em>1490), <span class="occ">nobility</span>, took its name from Forbes in Aberdeenshire. It had been long established there by the end of the fourteenth century, when it was represented by Sir John Forbes, who married Margaret Kennedy of Dunure. Sir John died in 1405 and was succeeded by his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_9810"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Forbes</span>, first Lord Forbes  (<em>d.</em> 1448)<span class="occ"></span>, who appears on 20 November 1406 as witness to a charter given by Robert Stewart, duke of Albany and governor of Scotland. Wyntoun names Forbes as one of the participants in a knightly tournament held in England in 1408; as serving his feudal superior, Alexander Stewart, earl of Mar, on the latter's expeditions abroad between 1406 and 1408, when he fought in the army of the duke of Burgundy; and as joining with Mar at the battle of Harlaw in 1411 against the lord of the Isles. On 16 October 1423 Forbes had a charter from Murdoch, duke of Albany, for the lands and barony of Forbes, situated in the sheriffdom of Aberdeen, on the boundary of the provincial earldom of Mar, thereby enhancing and underlining his position in the north-eastern political community. That he was anxious to maintain his new privileges is shown by the undertaking he received from his brother-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7926/', "William Douglas, second earl of Angus")</script>, on 4 November 1423, in which Angus promised that he would not sell or alienate any of his lands or possessions to the prejudice of his sister, Elizabeth Douglas (Forbes's wife), or their heirs.<br>
<br>Forbes's wider ambitions included royal service; in 1423 and 1424 he received letters of safe conduct from the English king to go to Durham to treat for the ransom of James I. Following the return of the king in 1424, Forbes served as a royal councillor, and when the king went north to Aberdeen in August 1426, he used Forbes, familiar with the politics of the area, as one of his advisers. Forbes's support was also courted by Robert Erskine, another influential member of the north-eastern nobility, who entertained aspirations to the earldom of Mar, while in May 1432 Forbes entered into an agreement with Alexander Lindsay, earl of Crawford, who, as sheriff of Aberdeen, was able to offer him the office of deputy sheriff.<br>
<br>In 1435, following the death of the earl of Mar in that year, Forbes was made bailie of Mar by the king, thus acquiring an office which rendered his support vital for those who sought influence in Mar; it was for this reason that, on 17 November 1435, Forbes made an indenture with Erskine, offering the latter help in recovering the earldom of Mar and Garioch in return for 100 marks or lands in Mar, subject to Erskine's success. In the event, the king claimed the earldom himself. However, in 1438, following the death of James I, the consequent turmoil was exploited by the politically ambitious nobility of the north-east, with Forbes, as deputy sheriff of Aberdeen, backing Robert Erskine's continued claim to the earldom of Mar in defiance of the government. In doing so Forbes demonstrated the extent to which he was giving his local interests precedence over royal service, in consequence of the unpopularity created by the royal annexation of Mar. On 26 June 1439 Forbes received a charter from Erskine, styling himself earl of Mar, for half of the lordship of Strathdee.<br>
<br>Recognition of Forbes's influence probably led to concerted efforts by the minority government to court his support, and the ultimate failure of Erskine to achieve his ambitions in Mar seems to have had no adverse affect on Forbes, who had been raised to the peerage as a lord of parliament by 1 July 1445, when he appears as Lord Forbes. On 4 July 1440 the house of Drumynour (in Strathbogie, Aberdeenshire) is first mentioned as the chief residence of the Forbes family, and the status afforded by its acquisition, and by the peerage title, argues that Forbes had come to enjoy the patronage of Chancellor William Crichton, seeking to advance a man whose local influence would facilitate the effective administration of the north-east during the royal minority. Before 1423, Forbes married Elizabeth, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7883/', "George Douglas, first earl of Angus")</script>, through whom their children were heirs of entail to the earldom of Angus. Forbes died in 1448 and was succeeded by his son, James.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_76828"></a><span class="headword">James Forbes</span>, second Lord Forbes  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1462), was granted a licence by James II on 4 May 1456 to fortify the tower of Drumynour, and he was one of the lords of session appointed to sit at Aberdeen in 1457. He married Egidia (<i>fl</i>. 1450), second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54240/', "William Keith, first Earl Marischal")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54235/', "Keith family")</script>], so linking the family to another important north-eastern family, recently elevated to the ranks of the higher nobility. He died before 30 July 1462, being succeeded by his son William, third Lord Forbes, who sat frequently in the parliaments which met between 1467 and 1488, and further consolidated the family's position, again in the arena of local as well as national politics, by marrying Christian Gordon, third daughter of Alexander, first earl of Huntly. He died before 5 July 1483.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_9811"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Forbes</span>, fourth Lord Forbes  (<em>d.</em> 1491)<span class="occ"></span>, succeeded his father and, on 5 July 1483, was ordered to pay 2000 marks to Margaret, Lady Dirleton, for failing to fulfil his agreement to marry her daughter. Instead, Forbes married Margaret Boyd, the daughter of Mary Stewart&#151;the king's sister&#151;and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3115/', "Thomas Boyd, earl of Arran")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54141/', "Boyd, family")</script>]; this royal connection may have been a factor in making Forbes one of James III's staunchest and most consistent supporters. He was present with the king at Aberdeen in April 1488 during the crucial latter stages of the king's confrontations with the rebels in that year. He accompanied James to Blackness early in May, and remained with him in Edinburgh between the 18th and the 28th, but seems almost certainly to have accompanied John Ramsay, Lord Bothwell, and the bishop of Moray in early June on a commission to enlist support for James III from fugitive Scots in Northumberland. The effort came too late, and the king was defeated and killed at Sauchieburn on 11 June 1488.<br>
<br>On 16 August 1488 Ross herald was sent north with a summons for treason to Lord Forbes. In the following spring, after he received further letters concerning the raising of a tax in the north-east, according to the sixteenth-century chronicler George Buchanan, Forbes rode through Aberdeen and the neighbouring towns carrying James III's bloodstained shirt on a spear, in an effort to incite revolt against the government. Forbes and the Earl Marischal had joined the leaders of the southern uprising against James IV in the castle of Dumbarton by September 1489, but after the defeat of the rebels in October, Forbes was pardoned. He took little further part in politics, and had died before 6 May 1491. He was succeeded by his brother Arthur, as fifth Lord Forbes.<br>
