<span class="headword">Lawrance,  Hannah</span>  (1795&#150;1875), <span class="occ">historian and journalist</span>, was born in 1795. She can be identified with Hannah, daughter of Thomas Lawrance, baptized at New Broad Street Independent Chapel, London, on 1 September 1795. Her mother, who had married Thomas Lawrance in 1793, was Hannah, daughter of John Stafford, minister of the New Broad Street Chapel. These family connections are confirmed by Hannah Lawrance's will, in which she left a large diamond ring to William Warlow Harry, minister of Knutsford, &#145;in remembrance of New Broad Street where my grandfather wore it for forty two years&#146;. It is probable that John Stafford Lawrance (baptized on 21 August 1794), Thomas George Lawrance (baptized on 22 November 1797), and Catherine Lawrance (baptized on 2 October 1812) were her siblings, but it seems likely that they died young, as her will only mentions cousins. The will suggests that she remained a lifelong Congregationalist, since she bequeathed &pound;50 to the Congregational Fund Board for the Relief of Poor Ministers, as well as leaving legacies to the London Missionary Society and the Home Missionary Society. Her other bequests included her books: a copy of Edward Blore's <span class="italic">Monumental Remains of Noble and Eminent Persons</span> is specifically mentioned, reflecting her historical interests, as is a stereoscope and slides, as well as a great deal of jewellery.<br>
<br>The early stages of Hannah Lawrance's writing career are not easy to trace. She has been tentatively identified as the author of <span class="italic">London in olden time, or, Tales intended to illustrate the manners and superstitions of its inhabitants, from the twelfth to the sixteenth century</span> (1825, 1827). Certainly it reflects her later historical interests and tendency to illustrate morals and manners through short historical tales. Two articles on &#145;The Anglo-Norman trouv&egrave;res&#146; in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> of 1836 have also been attributed to her, as have two articles on medieval French literature in <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> in 1844 and 1847. In 1838 she published the <span class="italic">Historical Memoirs of the Queens of England</span>, a predecessor of Agnes and Elizabeth Strickland's more sustained <span class="italic">Lives of the Queens of England</span> (1840&#150;48): indeed, the publication of Lawrance's <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> temporarily persuaded Agnes to abandon her work, and forced a revision of the proposed title of their publication. Lawrance's biographies of the English queens, though they dealt in much less detail than the Stricklands' <span class="italic">Lives</span> with each individual, were scholarly in approach and championed several maligned figures, including Eleanor of Aquitaine and Isabella of France. Christian Johnstone's review in <span class="italic">Tait's Magazine</span> (April 1838) praised them as superior in depth of research to other historical memoirs by women writers, adding that Lawrance had &#145;dug deeper in the tumulus of antiquity, than more accredited excavators of the other sex&#146;  (Johnstone, 263). In 1843 Lawrance published <span class="italic">The History of Woman in England, and her Influence on Society and Literature</span>, which was intended to be the first volume of a series. In this knowledgeable work she dwelt on a theme which she had already announced in the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>: the significant role of women in cultural developments, if only as patrons and facilitators. She also argued convincingly that Anglo-Saxon women had enjoyed greater social, political, and legal liberties than their later medieval and early modern successors.<br>
<br>Lawrance's lack of further publications on the history of women can be attributed to her commitment as a major contributor to the <span class="italic">British Quarterly Review</span>. Between 1847 and 1870 she contributed more than sixty articles to this periodical, a heavyweight vehicle for the nonconformist intelligentsia. Often highly readable and intelligent, they exhibit the width of her knowledge of English literature, art, and history, including topics as diverse as the education and employment of women, the Crystal Palace exhibitions, Elizabethan and Jacobean social life, Anglo-Norman poets, and African explorations. She was the regular art critic for the journal, producing workmanlike if uninspired accounts of the exhibitions (though an admirer of Ruskin, she usually found the works of the Pre-Raphaelites incomprehensible). More pioneering was her steady and well argued support for better education and wider employment opportunities for her own sex.<br>
<br>Hannah Lawrance also contributed several articles to <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>, and was a reviewer for <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>: possibly she wrote the rather critical 1840 review of the first volume of the Stricklands' <span class="italic">Lives of the Queens of England</span>, in which Lawrance herself is staunchly defended against the charge of stealing a march on her rivals. In 1844 she wrote two historical tales and one book review for <span class="italic">Hood's Magazine</span>. In 1852 she published a full-length historical novel, <span class="italic">The Treasure-Seeker's Daughter</span>. Set in London in 1620, it has a puritan heroine whose religious beliefs reflected Lawrance's own dissenting beliefs as a Congregationalist (the villain being, needless to say, a Catholic). It also reflected her fascination with court intrigues, seventeenth-century superstitions, and everyday life in Jacobean London. In 1854&#150;5 Lawrance contributed five articles to Charles Dickens's <span class="italic">Household Words</span>, depicting seventeenth- and eighteenth-century social life, again through the medium of short stories. She seems not to have mixed in London literary circles; from her works Elizabeth Barrett surmised that she was a &#145;deeper-minded woman&#146; than her rival Agnes Strickland and &#145;qualified to take, in literature, the higher place&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning &hellip; to Richard Hengist Horne</span>, ed. S. R. Townsend Mayer, 1877, 1.210). Lawrance died, unmarried, on 20 November 1875 at her home, 22 Albion Grove, Barnsbury Park, Middlesex.<br>
