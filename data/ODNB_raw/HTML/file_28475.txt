<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Walker, Sir  Edward</span>  (1612&#150;1677), <span class="occ">herald</span>, was born on 24 January 1612 at Roobers, Nether Stowey, Somerset, the second son of Edward Walker (<i>d</i>. 1635/6) of Roobers and Barbara, daughter of Edward Salkeld of Corby Castle, Cumberland.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandcivilwar"></a>Early years and civil war</h2>In 1633 Walker entered the service of Thomas Howard, earl of Arundel, earl marshal, who was attending Charles I's unpopular coronation as king of Scotland on 18 June 1633 in Edinburgh. On 24 May 1635 he was appointed Blanch Lyon pursuivant-extraordinary, thanks to his patron, by whose warrant of 27 August to the master of the wardrobe he acquired &#145;a coat of arms [tabard] embroidered with satin upon damask enriched with gold thread&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1635</i>, 355). In 1636 Walker attended Arundel on his lengthy but abortive mission to the ailing Holy Roman emperor, Ferdinand II, in Regensburg. In 1637 he was appointed Rouge Dragon pursuivant and in 1638 Chester herald. In 1639 he was secretary at war in Arundel's bloodless expedition against the Scots leading to the treaty of Berwick, for which he wrote the minutes. He also wrote a short life of his patron, which became the fourth book of Walker's <span class="italic">Historical Discourses</span>. On 23 April 1640 he was made paymaster to the garrison at Carlisle and the following year he was paid to disband it.<br>
<br>On 24 April 1642, shortly before the start of the civil war, Charles I sent Walker and another herald to demand the surrender of Kingston upon Hull and to proclaim Sir John Hotham a traitor in case of refusal. By autumn that year the king had constituted Walker his secretary at war. Following the battle of Edgehill in 1642 Walker remained with the king at Oxford (where he was created MA in 1642) until its siege and surrender in 1646. He was made secretary extraordinary of the privy council on 13 April 1644 and Norroy king of arms in the same year. He was sent to offer a pardon to Waller's army after the battle of Cropredy Bridge of 29 June 1644 and played a similar role on 12 August 1644 prior to the defeat of Essex at Lostwithiel. His account of the 1644 campaigns was an important source for the relevant section of Edward Hyde, earl of Clarendon's <span class="italic">History of the Rebellion</span>.<br>
<br>Walker became Garter king of arms in 1645, having been knighted on 2 February of that year in Oxford. One of his first tasks as Garter was to call on Prince Rupert in Oxford, with the chancellor and register of the order, with messages from the king about the prince's future installation as a knight of the Garter. Following the royalist defeat at Naseby (1645), the capture of the king by the Scots at Newark (1646), and the surrender of Oxford on 24 June 1646, Walker went briefly to France, where he saw at Le Mans the famous enamel memorial plate of Geoffrey Plantagenet, count of Anjou, said to be the earliest surviving example of a true coat of arms. Charles I having escaped in 1647 from Hampton Court to the Isle of Wight, Walker was permitted by parliament to act as his chief secretary at the abortive treaty of Newport. The documentary records of this treaty were published as a supplement to Walker's <span class="italic">Historical Discourses</span> but a fuller account by his secretary, Nicholas Oudart, is printed in Peck's <span class="italic">Desiderata curiosa</span>.<h2>
<a name="Royalserviceinexile"></a>Royal service in exile</h2>The execution of Charles I on 30 January 1649 did not end Walker's career in the royal service. That same year he was in The Hague with Charles II who appointed him clerk of the council in ordinary and receiver of the king's moneys. On 6 June the king sent him a list of debts to be settled immediately and Walker complied. Anxious to preserve his rights in troubled times he petitioned the king to confirm his right as Garter to carry the warrants and insignia to foreign princes and others who were elected to the Order of the Garter. The king, having referred the matter to three companions of the order, confirmed Garter's rights in his declaration at Breda on 28 May 1650. In the following month Walker accompanied Charles to Scotland and his name was included in a list (10 July 1650) of those ordered by the Scots parliament to be banished from the court and/or the country. He was still in Scotland during the battle of Dunbar on 3 September 1650 but on 4 October he was ordered to leave the court within twenty-four hours and he finally embarked for the Netherlands via Aberdeen in late October. From 30 October to 9 November 1650 he reported to Cottington from The Hague on the king's movements following Dunbar.<br>
<br>Walker had already invested Edward count palatine of the Rhine, first cousin of the king, as a knight of the Garter on 19 September 1649 at St Germain-en-Laye. He later invested three more companions at The Hague in 1653: Henry, duke of Gloucester, brother of Charles II; the prince of Taranto; and William Henry, prince of Orange (later William III). In 1654 he undertook a mission to Berlin to invest (on 3 April) Frederick William, elector of Brandenburg. Nevertheless, Walker was seldom satisfied and his endless complaints irritated his superiors. Secretary Nicholas in 1653 called him importunate, ambitious, and foolish, and in the same year Hyde described him as a correspondent not to be endured, and continued<blockquote>he has written impertinent letters either of expostulation or request, every week; he was troubled about Lane's appointment to be Clerk of the Council; next he asked for a letter to the Prince Elector, asking for Lord Stafford's liberty; and now he expostulates severely upon Sir W Ballentyne's being charged with the Garter for the Swedish Prince. (Ogle and others, 2.175)</blockquote>In the following year Hyde wrote to Nicholas &#145;Why should [you] wonder that a herald who is naturally made up of embroidery, should adorn his own services?&#146;  (ibid., 2.346). However both men sometimes found him useful, as on 5 May 1656 when Hyde recorded that he had heard from Walker in Amsterdam who suggested a scheme for getting money from Dutch Catholics by means of some priests. On 23 March 1657 Hyde wrote to Ormond that Walker, like Hyde himself, desired plenty and to live according to his quality as herald, but that it was no more in Hyde's power to help him than to restore him to his lodging in Windsor Castle. This refers to Garter's Tower in the lower ward which successive garters petitioned unsuccessfully to have repaired.<br>
<br>Walker was on good terms with Elias Ashmole but apparently disliked Sir William Dugdale, though after borrowing the latter's splendid <span class="italic">Monasticon Anglicanum</span> for three days in Amsterdam he wrote to him enthusiastically on 6 August 1655 saying &#145;I have almost made myself blind perusing it&#146; and offered to supply a plate by W. Hollar  (Hamper, 293). He was also a friend of the astrologer William Lilly and took an interest in horoscopes himself. The Ashmolean manuscripts contain much of this material including Walker's nativity &#145;Calculated and interpreted by Capt. G Wharton at Oxford 1645&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 179, 2.1&#150;9). However, he took exception to a book about Charles I published by Lilly in July 1651, <span class="italic">Monarchy and No Monarchy</span>, and admonished him in a letter from The Hague dated 24 May 1652 which became the fifth book of his <span class="italic">Historical Discourses</span>. In November 1655 Walker joined Charles II at Cologne and became once more secretary of the council and the following year secretary at war.<h2>
<a name="Restoration"></a>Restoration</h2>At the Restoration, Walker returned to his post as Garter displacing the intruded Edward Bysshe who, with parliamentary sanction, had been Garter from 1646 to 1660 and Clarenceux from 1650 to 1658. Sir William Le Neve, who had been appointed Clarenceux in 1635, was found insane in March 1661, and although Walker tried to get the post for himself Bysshe was appointed on 10 March 1661. He was frequently attacked by Walker, notably for having allegedly forged his own pedigree, but Walker's motives were partly selfish, namely to hinder the grant to Bysshe of a commission to carry out a heraldic visitation, or else to get himself included in it. In fact on 7 July 1663 Clarenceux (Bysshe) and Norroy (John Dugdale) received commissions in their own right to visit their respective provinces, thus resuming a practice which had been halted by the civil war. Walker's self interest had already led him, while still in exile in 1657, to draft a proposal for uniting the offices of Clarenceux and Norroy with that of Garter. He further angered his colleagues by making grants of arms without reference to the provincial kings (Clarenceux and Norroy) or to the earl marshal. On 6 May 1645 he had received a warrant from Charles I at Oxford authorizing him to grant augmentations (special marks of honour) to the arms of the king's faithful adherents, or to grant them new arms as he saw fit. On 3 September 1660 he obtained a further warrant confirming and amplifying that of 1645.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, away from the College of Arms, on 27 May 1660 Walker had invested with the Garter, on board ship, Sir Edward Montagu, who had just escorted Charles II back to England and in July of that year Walker, John Nicholas, and Sir George Lane were made clerks of the privy council in ordinary. Walker and Nicholas received a substantial pay rise on 18 April 1665. Walker also played an important part in the coronation of Charles II, which took place in Westminster Abbey during a thunderstorm on 23 April 1661. He wrote a detailed account of the event in fifty-two manuscript folios dated 25 May 1661, subsequently published in 1820 as <span class="italic">A Circumstantial Account of the Preparations for the Coronation</span>. Ashmole also wrote a brief narrative of the coronation and banquet as part of a book by John Ogilby but withdrew his name from the second and subsequent editions, possibly for fear of upsetting Walker.<h2>
<a name="DisputeswithintheCollegeofArms"></a>Disputes within the College of Arms</h2>In 1668 the College of Arms submitted to the commissioners draft orders for the regulation of the college based on those of 1568 but dealing in more detail with the control of unauthorized herald painters, certain duties of the kings of arms such as the recording of their grants of arms at the college, and the conduct of visitations and funerals. These were largely accepted by the commissioners but Walker and Bysshe both seemed to ignore the requirement to register their grants. Meanwhile in 1672 Charles II revived the office of hereditary earl marshal, which had been in commission since 1662, conferring it on Henry (Howard) earl of Norwich, later duke of Norfolk. The latter decided that the kings of arms needed stricter control and on 21 May 1673 he made an order requiring every grant to be made by all three kings jointly, following a warrant from the earl marshal, and recorded before it went to the grantee. He also laid down minimum fees, both Bysshe and Walker having been accused of making cheap grants surreptitiously. Next day the earl marshal directed a warrant to all three kings to make a grant to one Nevinson Fox. Walker considered the earl marshal had exceeded his powers and, perhaps unwisely, petitioned the privy council. The king referred the petition to the lord privy seal, whose lengthy opinion strongly supported the earl marshal, whereupon the king, on 16 June 1673, issued a declaration of the earl marshal's authority over the officers of arms. The loyal Ashmole tried to assist Walker by drafting a statement claiming that while Garter was subject to the earl marshal's authority as a member of the college he was not so as an officer of the Order of the Garter. The exercise was in vain, for on 22 January 1675 an order in council confirmed the validity of the king's declaration of 1673.<br>
<br>Fuller details of Walker's grievances against his colleagues and the earl marshal during the period 1673&#150;6 may be found in Ashmole manuscript 1133. He singled out for particular blame Andrew Hay, the earl marshal's secretary, and Thomas Lee, Chester herald. Lee was one of a triumvirate (with Francis Sandford and Henry St George) who disagreed with Walker over details of the plans to rebuild the College of Arms on the site of Derby House, destroyed in the great fire of 1666. Many similar disputes were chronicled in letters sent to Sir Joseph Williamson in Cologne by his clerk Henry Ball. Letters of June 1673 indicate that Bysshe was in disgrace over the inadequacy of his grant and visitation records and that Walker proposed to sell his place and retire. He did not in fact do so and he even obeyed the earl marshal's warrant for the grant of arms to Nevinson Fox. However, further disagreements followed and it is regrettable that these disputes clouded the final years of his distinguished career, to the prejudice of the office of Garter and of the College of Arms itself.<br>
<br>On 18 May 1675 Walker bought for &pound;1060 from the surviving trustee of Elizabeth, Lady Barnard, William Shakespeare's grandchild and heir, a house called New Place in Stratford upon Avon, which had been the poet's last home. However, he does not seem to have lived there but at Clopton in Warwickshire. He married at an unknown date Agnes (<i>d</i>. in or before 1676), daughter of John Reeve of Bookham, Surrey, and had an only child, Barbara, who married, in 1662, Sir John Clopton of Clopton; their eldest son, Edward, was baptized at the College of Arms in 1663. Walker died at Whitehall on 20 February 1677 and was buried in the Lady (or Clopton) Chapel in Stratford upon Avon church. His epitaph was composed by his successor William Dugdale. In his will he left the college the library of Sir William Le Neve, which he had purchased in 1663, having already presented it with a collection of original grants of arms in 1673. He also bequeathed to his successors as Garter two volumes of the arms of the nobility and two relating to the Order of the Garter. He was probably the first Garter to keep a continuous record of the order, and Dugdale was to continue the second of Walker's volumes.<br>
