<span class="headword">Crawford,  John <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>  (1775&#150;1831), <span class="occ">sailor and naval hero</span>, was born on 22 March 1775 at a house on Thornhill Bank in the east end of Sunderland, co. Durham, the son of a keelman. At an early age Crawford also worked on the keelboats that carried coal on the River Wear. As a youth he served an apprenticeship on board a brig called the <i>Peggy</i>, which sailed out of South Shields, co. Durham. He volunteered for the Royal Navy at the outbreak of the French wars and is listed on the muster roll of the <i>Venerable</i>, flagship of Admiral Adam Duncan.<br>
<br>On 11 October 1797 Crawford was on the <i>Venerable</i> during the naval engagement later known as the battle of Camperdown. The Dutch, then allied to the French, formed the opposition. At the height of battle the mainmast of Duncan's vessel was struck by enemy fire and the admiral's blue squadronal standard brought down. (At the time the disappearance of the flag caused confusion elsewhere in the fleet as &#145;striking&#146; the flag was usually a sign of surrender.) Either as a volunteer or under specific orders Crawford climbed the remnants of the mast with the standard and nailed it back where it was visible to the rest of the fleet. In the process he was hit in the mouth by a splinter and wounded. Crawford's act came at a crucial point in the battle, in which Duncan eventually proved victorious. In some quarters the restoration of the standard was seen as vital and the victory at Camperdown noted as marking the closure of the golden age of Dutch sea power.<br>
<br>On disembarking Crawford was greeted as a hero both locally and nationally. In his native town of Sunderland he was presented with a silver medal marked &#145;for gallant service&#146;. Before the end of the year he had been sketched in action and the resultant painting used as a basis for commemorative pottery. In Kings Lynn, Norfolk, a public house was renamed the Valiant Sailor in his honour. George III insisted on meeting him and Crawford received a pension of &pound;30 a year. According to colleagues interviewed in later life Crawford himself was nonplussed by the attention and adulation. &#145;Never mind&#151;that's nowt (nothing)&#146;, he is recorded as saying. The same witnesses spoke of him as a typical hard-living and hard-working &#145;tar&#146; of his day, generally quiet and unassuming yet generous to his closest friends. At the same time he was vociferous and active when he had taken a drink, and this led to numerous local tales of ribald activity.<br>
<br>Crawford remained on active service throughout the French wars (1793&#150;1815) with the exception of a break around the time of the brief peace from 1803 to 1804. He is noted in official records as both a rating and a gunner. After the <i>Venerable</i> he served on the <i>America</i>&#151;possibly for the remainder of his career in the Royal Navy.<br>
<br>While in the navy Crawford married Sarah Laidler Longstaff, who had been baptized at Monkwearmouth, co. Durham, on 20 August 1788, and was the daughter of Simon Longstaff of Monkwearmouth, shipbuilder, and Ann, his wife. The wedding took place on 5 November 1807 at St Nicholas's Church, Deptford, Kent (beside the River Thames). There were three sons and a daughter. The eldest, John, was born in Deptford in September 1810 and later worked as a waterman on both the Tyne and the Wear. The other sons (George and William) went to sea and are thought to have settled in Australia.<br>
<br>After the wars Crawford returned to Sunderland and resumed his work in the coal trade on the river. On 10 November 1831 he became the first male victim of the outbreak of cholera imported in a vessel from Riga, Latvia. He died in poverty at his home &#145;near the ferry landing&#146;. His silver medal was in pawn and his annual pensions dissipated on entertainment. A tree marked his burial plot in the churchyard of Sunderland parish church until 1888, when a gravestone was erected with money collected by public subscription. Two years later a statue was unveiled showing him nailing the colours to the mast. This now occupies a prominent position in Sunderland's Mowbray Park and was central to the Trafalgar bicentenary celebrations in October 2005.<br>
<br>Crawford's life is worthy of recall. He turned down the opportunity of fame and fortune on a number of occasions, most famously refusing to join in the Camperdown celebrations where a stand-in collected enough money to spend the rest of his life in comfort. He did, however, agree to walk in the procession at Horatio Nelson's funeral in January 1806, wearing his silver medal. A room in Sunderland Museum is dedicated to his memory and there are numerous displays of artefacts connected to him, including commemorative pottery and his medal.<br>
