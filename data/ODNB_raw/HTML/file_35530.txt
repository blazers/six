</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pinero, Sir  Arthur Wing</span>  (1855&#150;1934), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born on 24 May 1855 at 21 Dalby Terrace, Islington, London, the second of the three children of John Daniel Pinero (1798&#150;1871), a London solicitor, and his wife, Lucy Daines (1836&#150;1905). His parents were English, but his father's ancestors were Portuguese Jews (named Pinheiro), who had emigrated to London in the early eighteenth century.<br>
<br>His family's weak finances dictated Pinero's education: he attended Spafields Chapel charity school in Exmouth Street, Clerkenwell, London, until the age of ten, when he left to work in his father's law office. This valuable training demanded careful attention to detail, besides furnishing Pinero with a gallimaufry of clients to observe. His actual interests lay elsewhere, sparked by childhood visits to the old Sadler's Wells Theatre, and by witnessing Irving's performances at the Lyceum and those of the Bancrofts at the Prince of Wales's Theatre. He acquired some theatrical training in the elocution class of the Birkbeck Scientific and Literary Institution (now Birkbeck College) where he was enrolled from 1870 to 1874. His first dramatic role was in the college theatre, and he was subsequently appointed to act as &#145;reader&#146; to the elocution class. He and his classmates staged various productions and ventured on tours of Ilfracombe, Bristol (1873), Edinburgh, Leith, and Liverpool (1874).<br>
<br>This experience proved irresistibly seductive. On 4 May 1874 Pinero abandoned the legal profession and signed on for &pound;1 per week as a &#145;general utility&#146; man with R. H. Wyndham at Edinburgh's Theatre Royal. After immodestly gracing Birkbeck with a farewell performance of Hamlet, Pinero plunged into the rigours of provincial repertory on 22 June 1874 in a production of Wilkie Collins's <span class="italic">The Woman in White</span>. He gained rapid experience through supporting E. A. Sothern in <span class="italic">Our American Cousin</span>, and Charles Mathews in <span class="italic">A Game of Speculation</span>, as well as many other visiting stars.<br>
<br>After the Theatre Royal burnt down on 6 February 1875 Pinero secured a berth and more minor roles at the Royal Alexandra Theatre, Liverpool. Although only competent as an actor, he garnered some favourable notices, and fortune smiled when the Liverpool production of Collins's <span class="italic">Miss Gwilt</span> transferred to London's Globe Theatre. So, ironically, Pinero's return to the capital on 15 April 1876 saw him playing an elderly solicitor. He was then engaged by Mrs S. F. Bateman for the Lyceum company, and supported Irving on a provincial tour which included <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>. A Birmingham critic deemed Pinero's Claudius the worst the city had witnessed. Such withering verdicts aside, Pinero's five years with Irving at the Lyceum were incalculably rewarding, although they included 250 mind-numbing consecutive performances as Salarino in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> (1879&#150;80). Long runs were also the norm when the Bancrofts invited Pinero to join the Haymarket for 1881&#150;2. This thorough practical grounding yielded other dividends: numerous plays. Pinero had discovered his vocation.<br>
<br>His first effort was <span class="italic">&pound;200 a Year</span>, a one-act dashed off in an afternoon for F. H. Macklin's benefit performance (Globe, 6 October 1877). Although the play was unremarkable, Macklin rewarded Pinero with a set of gold studs and cuff links. More, rather undistinguished, plays followed quickly, but all exhibited Pinero's concern for the relationships between men and women of the English middle and upper classes, the realm of most of his nearly sixty plays. His first full-length work was <span class="italic">La com&egrave;te</span> (1878), followed by <span class="italic">Two can Play at that Game</span> (1878), a curtain-raiser for Irving at the Lyceum. The next year Pinero devised <span class="italic">Daisy's Escape</span>, in which he acted opposite his future wife, Myra Holme (1851/2&#150;1919). Born Myra Emily Moore, she was the daughter of Beaufoy Alfred Moore, a publican; when she met Pinero, she was married to an ailing captain, John Angus Hamilton. After his death and a protracted courtship Pinero and Myra were married on 19 April 1883. Their marriage was happy but childless; however, Myra brought to the marriage her two children, Myra (<i>b</i>. 1875?), and Angus (1876?&#150;1913), later a war correspondent. The marriage lasted until 1919, when Myra Pinero died, aged sixty-seven.<br>
<br>Pinero's first success, measured by its 308 performances, was <span class="italic">Hester's Mystery</span> (1880), written for J. L. Toole at the Folly. <span class="italic">Bygones</span> and <span class="italic">The Money Spinner</span>, also produced in 1880, were succeeded by <span class="italic">Imprudence</span> (1881), which launched Pinero's career as a director. (Over the years his directing became increasingly autocratic: actors were instructed about the slightest inflection and were not allowed to stray from the text, which Pinero could recite from memory.) In 1881 <span class="italic">The Squire</span> created a furore when Pinero was accused of plagiarizing Thomas Hardy's <span class="italic">Far from the Madding Crowd</span>.<br>
<br>The next four years (1881&#150;5) saw nine mostly forgettable plays: of these <span class="italic">The Iron-Master</span> (1884) and <span class="italic">Mayfair</span> (1885) are noteworthy as Pinero's rare attempts at adapting French plays, the common lot of many nineteenth-century dramatists. However, in 1885 Pinero's career really took off with <span class="italic">The Magistrate</span>, the first of his famous &#145;Court&#146; farces, named for the theatre where most of them were staged. In that play, as well as in <span class="italic">The Schoolmistress</span> (1886) and <span class="italic">Dandy Dick</span> (1887), Pinero attacked facets of Victorian society by creating credible though blinkered characters, trying to preserve their respectability while trapped in a relentless whirlpool of catastrophically illogical events. These farces, which totalled over 900 performances initially, remain among Pinero's best, wittiest work. <span class="italic">The Hobby-Horse</span> (1886), <span class="italic">The Cabinet Minister</span> (1890), and <span class="italic">The Amazons</span> (1893) failed to capitalize on that success because, though they were similar, their tone was more serious. However, the sentimentality of <span class="italic">Sweet Lavender</span> in 1888 touched audiences: it gave Edward Terry his best role, and racked up 684 performances, an achievement unmatched by the similar <span class="italic">The Weaker Sex</span> (1888) and <span class="italic">Lady Bountiful</span> (1891).<br>
<br>Pinero's desire to rehabilitate the native drama drew him to more serious social topics, especially the double standard of morality, applied unequally to men and women. His first such &#145;problem play&#146; was <span class="italic">The Profligate</span> (1889), in which a husband suffers the consequences of his licentious actions. In <span class="italic">The Second Mrs Tanqueray</span> (1893) Pinero focused on &#145;a woman with a past&#146;: the result was a sensational and financial success. The role of Paula Tanqueray established Mrs Patrick Campbell's career, and ensured Pinero's place in theatrical history. Although not as avant-garde as Ibsen's plays, <span class="italic">Tanqueray</span> confronted its fashionable St James's audiences with as forceful a social message as they could stomach. Their appetite for similar Pinero plays varied. Less successful at the box-office were <span class="italic">The Notorious Mrs Ebbsmith</span> (1895), <span class="italic">The Benefit of the Doubt</span> (1895), <span class="italic">The Thunderbolt</span> (1908), and <span class="italic">Mid-Channel</span> (1909). <span class="italic">Iris</span> (1901) and <span class="italic">Letty</span> (1903) did reasonably well, while <span class="italic">His House in Order</span> (1906) achieved 430 performances and netted over &pound;78,000.<br>
<br>During this middle period Pinero essayed other genres, again with mixed results. There were comedies of manners such as <span class="italic">The Times</span> (1891), <span class="italic">The Princess and the Butterfly</span> (1897), and the highly successful <span class="italic">The Gay Lord Quex</span> (1899). Pinero attempted a romantic musical, <span class="italic">The Beauty Stone</span> (1898), with J. C. Carr and Sir Arthur Sullivan. A fine and enduring achievement was Pinero's homage to T. W. Robertson's mid-century contribution to the theatre in <span class="italic">Trelawny of the &#145;Wells&#146;</span> (1898). Grimly comic and ghastly was <span class="italic">A Wife without a Smile</span> (1904).<br>
<br>Although writing and directing occupied most of Pinero's energies, he had other public-spirited interests. He frequently chaired committees, such as that which arranged the Ellen Terry jubilee celebrations in 1906. From 1893 to 1904 he was an honorary examiner in elocution for Birkbeck, and vice-president of its council from 1899 to 1921. He also served on the council of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art from 1906 to 1926. Honours also came his way. He was made a member of the Garrick Club (outside which he had stood as an awestruck boy), was awarded a knighthood in 1909 (for which Shaw mischievously claimed credit), and became a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1910.<br>
<br>Pinero's friendships were numerous, although he characteristically reserved his intimacy for a few chosen men, particularly the critic William Archer (who championed his work) and Henry Arthur Jones (a fellow labourer). He was close to George Alexander, manager of the St James's, although their strong-willed personalities clashed and disagreements ensued.<br>
<br>During the last third of his life Pinero's fame was gradually eclipsed. He continued writing plays, sometimes repeating past successful formulas: <span class="italic">The &#145;Mind the Paint&#146; Girl</span> (1912); <span class="italic">The Big Drum</span> (1915); <span class="italic">The Freaks</span> (1918); and <span class="italic">Child Man</span> (1930). However, he was not afraid to experiment, as the whimsy and fantasy of <span class="italic">The Widow of Wasdale Head</span> (1912) and <span class="italic">The Enchanted Cottage</span> (1922) attest. He even attempted a sort of cinematic treatment of the Jekyll-and-Hyde theme in <span class="italic">Dr Harmer's Holidays</span> (1931). But his day had passed, as the failure of his last staged work, <span class="italic">A Cold June</span> (1932), proved.<br>
<br>Indeed, after his wife's death in 1919 Pinero was often despondent, despite his stepdaughter's devoted attention. His own death came somewhat unexpectedly: he failed to survive an operation for a strangulated hernia and died on 23 November 1934 in Marylebone Nursing Home. A memorial service, attended by numerous theatrical figures, was held at St Marylebone parish church on 28 November 1934, after which Pinero's ashes were buried in his wife's grave in the churchyard of Chiddingfold, Surrey, close to their former country home.<br>
<br>Pinero's appearance was striking: he was virtually bald, had bushy ebony eyebrows and sharp features, and almost invariably wore gloves. His contribution to the English theatre was equally conspicuous, and, after an inevitable critical lull, still commands attention. He was a skilled craftsman, who realized what was acceptable to the fashionable audiences who flocked to see his work. Pinero's ideas lacked high intellectuality, although he remained a step ahead of his audiences, shocking them within acceptable bounds. His best farces, comedies of manners, and serious plays still hold the stage, and his accomplishments, while not radical, are undeniable.<br>
