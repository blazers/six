<span class="headword">Higgs,  Henry</span>  (1864&#150;1940), <span class="occ">civil servant and economist</span>, was born at 17 Fore Street, Torpoint, Antony, Cornwall, on 4 March 1864, the eleventh of thirteen children of Samuel Nicholas Higgs, master butcher, and his wife, Ann Pugh. His humble origins influenced his career choice, for he had to attain sufficient financial security to sustain his parents in their old age. He took full advantage of the meritocratic opportunities offered by a newly reformed civil service. Entering as a lower-division clerk in 1881 he passed the competition for class 1 in 1884, and for the next fifteen years served in the secretary's office of the General Post Office.<br>
<br>When he moved to the Treasury in 1899 Higgs attracted the attention of its permanent secretary, Sir Edward Hamilton, from whom he learnt the intricacies of Britain's public finances, which he in turn communicated in a series of publications (<span class="italic">The Financial System of the United Kingdom</span>, 1914; <span class="italic">National Economy</span>, 1917; <span class="italic">A Primer of National Finance</span>, 1919; <span class="italic">Financial Reform</span>, 1924). He became private secretary to a succession of ministers, culminating with Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman when prime minister between 1905 and 1908, when Higgs was made CB. On 16 July 1908 he married Winifred Sarah (1877/8&#150;1939), daughter of Thomas John South, landscape gardener, of Kew, with whom he had at least one child, a son. He also served as a special commissioner to Natal in 1902&#150;3 and as inspector-general of finance in Egypt between 1912 and 1915 before retiring from the Treasury in 1921 as principal clerk.<br>
<br>Upon securing his position within the established civil service in 1884 Higgs enrolled in University College, London, intending to pursue legal studies. He also studied at the University of Berlin. In 1890 he took his LLB and was called to the bar at the Middle Temple. It was none the less economics rather than the law which quickly captivated Higgs. He fell early under the influence of H. S. Foxwell, whose political economy lectures he attended in 1885&#150;7, and thereafter his energies were increasingly devoted to economics and to the burgeoning economics profession. Quickly adept at the subject, he won a scholarship in 1886 to continue his studies at University College, and the following year began lecturing in economics at Toynbee Hall. He was a fellow of University College, and Newmarch lecturer in statistics, and was lecturer in economics at the University of Wales (Bangor), 1925&#150;9. It was under Foxwell's influence that he then began his lifetime interest in the physiocrats, and in particular in Richard Cantillon, who was the subject of his first economics article (<span class="italic">Economic Journal</span>, 1891) and of his most significant contribution to the history of economic thought, his translation of Cantillon's <span class="italic">Essai sur la nature du commerce en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral</span> (1755; ed. H. Higgs, 1931).<br>
<br>Higgs is also regarded for his contribution to the British economics profession at an important early stage of its development. He was one of the founding members of the British Economic Association (later the Royal Economic Society), serving as the association's first secretary and, with F. Y. Edgeworth, as joint editor of its <span class="italic">Economic Journal</span> between 1892 and 1905. While he continued too long on the council of the Royal Economic Society, being still an active but unhelpful contributor to its meetings until his death (upon which see J. M. Keynes's bitter-sweet obituary for the <span class="italic">Economic Journal</span>), his early work for the association and its journal was invaluable in promoting the professionalization of economics. He displayed similar administrative and interpersonal skills in his re-editing of the <span class="italic">Palgrave Dictionary of Political Economy</span> (3 vols., 1923&#150;6) under impossible conditions of minimal change. He also completed various projects, initiated but abandoned by Foxwell, most notably the publication of W. S. Jevons's <span class="italic">The Principles of Economics</span> (1905) and <span class="italic">A Bibliography of Economics</span> (1935). He stood unsuccessfully as Liberal parliamentary candidate for Putney in 1922. He died in Brighton Municipal Hospital on 21 May 1940.<br>
