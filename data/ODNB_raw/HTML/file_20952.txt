<span class="headword">Oulton,  Walley Chamberlain</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1783&#150;1820), <span class="occ">playwright and theatre historian</span>, was born in Dublin, the son of Walley Oulton (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1737) and his wife, Catherine, the daughter of Dr Chamberlen Walker, who himself came from the Chamberlen family of physicians who had invented obstetrical forceps. His great-grandfather, also named Walley Oulton, had settled in Dublin early in the eighteenth century, and set up as a glover in Nicholas Street. It is said that Walley Chamberlain Oulton lost his father during infancy, and on his mother's remarriage was left in the care of his grandfather Dr Walker, from whom he received a classical education. Other sources, however, state that he was educated privately in Dublin under Dr Ball. In any event, his first play, <span class="italic">The Haunted Castle</span>, was performed at the Capel Street theatre in December 1783, and was quickly followed by several other pieces. According to Stephen Jones, &#145;intoxicated with this success, he neglected his studies, and came to London&#146;  (Baker), where he married Ann Elizabeth Churchill on 5 November 1787 at St Luke's, Chelsea. They had at least two daughters and two sons, John Oulton and Thomas Walker Oulton, the latter of whom was baptized on 23 May 1796.<br>
<br>In London Oulton was soon embroiled in controversy. His burletta <span class="italic">Hobson's Choice</span> was staged in 1787 by John Palmer at the Royalty Theatre in Wellclose Square. Palmer's enterprise was opposed by the powerful lobby of supporters of London's patent theatres, and Oulton's light-hearted satire of the prevailing theatrical conditions (his subtitle was <span class="italic">Thespis in Distress</span>) gave disproportionate offence. Believing himself <i>persona non grata</i> at Drury Lane and Covent Garden, Oulton concealed his authorship of his next play, <span class="italic">As it should be</span>, which was performed under the Colman management at the Haymarket in June 1789. The younger Colman continued to support Oulton after the deception was discovered, and it was at the Haymarket that many of his plays were first performed. As a dramatist he was modestly content to gratify popular taste in a career that lasted until 1817. He was not, however, prolific (twenty-five known pieces in thirty-four years), and it may have been financial considerations that drew him into acting. His first recorded appearance was as Pierre in Otway's <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span> at the Richmond Theatre on 18 September 1792, but he may have acted for Palmer at the Royalty as early as 1787 or 1788, as several of the Royalty playbills for those seasons are missing.<br>
<br>A minor playwright and a forgotten actor, Oulton was also a journalist and an industrious historian of the English theatre. The <span class="italic">Busy Body</span>, which he published three times a week during the first two months of 1787, was his attempt to establish himself as a periodical essayist in the tradition of Addison and Steele. Its twenty-five issues were collected for publication in book form in 1789. He also entered into controversy in 1795, with two pseudonymous pamphlets attacking the self-proclaimed prophet Richard Brothers and his disciple Nathaniel Halhed. Oulton's ill-judged defence of the authenticity of <span class="italic">Vortigern</span>, Samuel Ireland's Shakespeare forgery, appeared anonymously in 1796. The protection of anonymity did not last long, and Oulton shared the embarrassment of a gullible public, redeeming himself somewhat by the publication, also in 1796, of his two-volume updating of Benjamin Victor's <span class="italic">History of the Theatres of London</span>. It is as a theatre historian that he is best known, and his last major work, published in 1818, was a further updating of this <span class="italic">History</span> to 1817 in three volumes. His <span class="italic">Authentic memoirs of the green room (for 1799) containing the lives of all the performers of the theatres-royal</span> is not entirely reliable, but it was successful enough to merit expansion to two volumes in 1800 and to run to six further editions between 1801 and 1816. Oulton also edited, for publication in 1801, <span class="italic">Barker's Continuation of Egerton's Theatrical Remembrances, Baker's Biographia dramatica, etc.</span>, which had further editions in 1803 and 1814. His journeyman work included a shoddy edition of Shakespeare's poems (1804), anthologies of the writings of Kotzebue (1800) and Anna Seward (1813), a translation of Gessner's <span class="italic">Death of Abel</span> (1811), an English gazetteer (1805), and (his last known publication) a <span class="italic">Picture of Margate and its Vicinity</span> (1820). Nothing is known of Oulton after 1820, and no details of his private life have been preserved. Even in the memoirs of men who knew him, like George Colman the younger and James Boaden, his name is scarcely mentioned.<br>
