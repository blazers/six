<span class="headword">Hope,  Frederick William</span>  (1797&#150;1862), <span class="occ">entomologist and collector of insects and engravings</span>, was born on 3 January 1797 at 37 Upper Seymour Street, Portman Square, London, the second son of John Thomas Hope (1761&#150;1854) of Netley Hall, Shropshire, and Ellen Hester Mary, only child of Sir Thomas Edwardes, seventh baronet, rector of Frodesley, Shropshire, and Tilston, Cheshire. He was privately educated under the Revd Delafosse of Richmond, Surrey, and after entering Christ Church, Oxford, in 1817, graduated BA in 1820, and MA in 1823. He then took holy orders, becoming for a time curate of the family's living at Frodesley.<br>
<br>At Oxford, Hope became interested in natural science, especially entomology, and with his considerable means was able to accumulate a great collection of insects. He also collected prints, amassing 140,000 portraits, 70,000 topographical engravings, and more than 20,000 natural history engravings. On 6 June 1835, at Marylebone church, Middlesex, Hope married Ellen (1801&#150;1879), younger daughter of George Meredith of Nottingham Place, Marylebone; they had no children.<br>
<br>Hope travelled to France, Switzerland, Germany, and Holland but owing to his poor state of health was compelled at times to reside on the Mediterranean. From 1840 to 1862 he spent most of his time at Naples and Nice, bases which provided him with the opportunity to study fish and Crustacea. These studies formed the basis for his work <span class="italic">Catalogo dei crostacei Italiani e di molti altri del Mediterraneo</span> (1851).<br>
<br>In 1849 Hope executed a deed of gift giving his collections of fish, Crustacea, birds, shells, books, and 230,000 pictures to the University of Oxford. However, the original deed of gift was not accepted by convocation until April 1850, owing to almost continual, and at times frustrating, discussion between Hope and the university over the details. For many years afterwards both Hope and his wife (who shared his interest in natural history) continued to add entomological and other zoological specimens to the Oxford collections. In 1855, when construction of the new museum at Oxford was started (later the Oxford University Museum of Natural History), Hope was awarded the honorary degree of DCL by the university, no doubt in recognition of his generous donation.<br>
<br>Hope was also keen to establish a new chair of zoology at Oxford. Negotiations had begun by 1856, and in 1860 endowment for the Hope professorship of zoology was agreed. In January 1861 John Obadiah Westwood was nominated by Hope and appointed as first Hope professor of zoology; in turn the Hope department of zoology was founded. Furthermore in 1857, in line with Hope's recommendations, Westwood took up the curatorship of the Hope entomological specimens.<br>
<br>Hope's correspondence with naturalists was extensive, and his London residence was often used as their meeting-place. He often associated with Charles Darwin, with whom he would go &#145;entomologizing&#146;, and he contributed valuable information to the works of others, including Gravenhorst, Shuckard, and Sch&ouml;nberr. He was author of about sixty papers on entomology, chiefly in the Entomological Society's <span class="italic">Transactions</span>. Hope's major work was probably <span class="italic">The Coleopterist's Manual</span> (1837&#150;40); his entomological collection also formed the basis of Westwood's catalogues of Hemiptera (1837&#150;1842?), and lucanoid Coleoptera (1845).<br>
<br>Hope was early elected a fellow of the Linnean Society (1822) and the Royal Society (1834), and took an active part in founding the Zoological and Entomological societies (1826 and 1833, respectively). He served as treasurer, then vice-president (1833&#150;4, 1837&#150;8, and 1841&#150;3), of the Entomological Society, and was its president in 1835&#150;6, 1839&#150;40, and 1845&#150;6. He also received many awards and honours from a number of institutions both at home and abroad.<br>
<br>Hope died at his residence, 37 Upper Seymour Street, Portman Square in London, on 15 April 1862. In accordance with his wishes, his widow, Ellen, gave an additional endowment to the professorship which he had founded at Oxford, a stipend for the keeper of his collection of engravings, and further funding for maintaining and expanding the portrait and entomological collections. Hope's print collection later went to the university's Ashmolean Museum; in the late 1990s a vast number of his entomological specimens and archives could still be found in the Hope department at Oxford University's Museum of Natural History.<br>
