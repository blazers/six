<span class="headword">Meares,  John</span>  (1756?&#150;1809), <span class="occ">naval officer and entrepreneur</span>, is of unknown origins. Nothing is known of his early years until he entered the navy in 1771 on board the <i>Cruiser</i>, in the rating of &#145;captain's servant&#146;. After serving for nearly seven years, mostly in small ships, he passed his examination on 17 September 1778, when he was said to be more than twenty-two (passing certificate); the next day he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. After the peace of 1783 he entered the merchant service and obtained command of a ship for a voyage to India. At Calcutta he was inspired, like many others in India and Britain, by news of Cook's discoveries in the north Pacific and he formed a company for opening or developing a trade with north-west America. On 12 March 1786 he sailed in the ship <i>Nootka</i> of 200 tons, not knowing that two other expeditions were being mounted at the same time. On 25 September he arrived in Prince William Sound, where he wintered in extremely harsh conditions. Most of the crew of the <i>Nootka</i> were dead by the time George Dixon and Nathaniel Portlock arrived in the sound in the <i>Queen Charlotte</i> and the <i>King George</i> the following spring. As an officially sanctioned expedition sent from London, they were surprised to find Meares already on this coast, and they only offered to help him in his difficult situation if he undertook to leave at once. This later prompted a bitter dispute between the two parties which became known as the Dixon&#150;Meares controversy.<br>
<br>When Meares reached Macau in October 1787, he at once began to lay plans for a return to the coast of north-west America and a small group of interested entrepreneurs funded two ships for a voyage. In January 1788 he sailed for Nootka Sound in the ship <i>Felice</i>, arriving there in May. In June he was joined by the <i>Iphigenia</i>, with William Douglas as master; and after some traffic with the indigenous people, land was bought and a trading post was established. Having obtained a promise of free and exclusive trade, Meares sailed for China in the <i>Felice</i> in September, leaving the <i>Iphigenia</i> and her tender, the <i>North-west America</i>, with orders to winter in the Hawaiian Islands.<br>
<br>In Macau, Meares formed a consortium with a rival group of businessmen led by John Cadman Etches (whose partners ironically included George Dixon and Nathaniel Portlock). Meares, whose position was vulnerable as an interloping trader, believed that this merger under a joint trading account would allow him the official recognition that had previously been granted to Etches's organization, the King George's Sound Company. In 1789 Meares and his partners at Canton (Guangzhou) dispatched two ships, the <i>Argonaut</i> in April, and the <i>Princess Royal</i> in May, to join the <i>Iphigenia</i> in Nootka Sound. Their instructions from the consortium were to establish a permanent factory there. The <i>Iphigenia</i> was in the sound on 6 May when the Spanish frigate <i>Princesa</i> of twenty-six guns came in. On the 13th the <i>Princesa</i> was joined by the sixteen-gun corvette <i>San Carlos</i>; and on the 14th the Spaniards seized the <i>Iphigenia</i> and the <i>North-west America</i>, making Douglas and all his men prisoners. On their arrival later on, the <i>Argonaut</i> and <i>Princess Royal</i> were also seized, the grounds of the aggression being the allegation that the coast was in the possession of Spain, and that any foreign ships trading and establishing settlements there were violating Spanish rights. When fragmentary news of these events reached London, in January 1790, a demand for compensation and the return of British property was made to the Spanish. Only then, it was declared, would the larger issue of territorial rights be discussed. Simmering tension, however, became a deep international crisis when Meares entered on the scene.<br>
<br>As soon as news of the incident in Nootka Sound had reached Meares in China, he had returned to Britain, and in a memorial dated 30 April 1790 he laid the details of the case before the government. He presented ministers with a colourful and far from accurate account of what had happened the previous year and during his earlier voyages to the sound. In particular, there was great uncertainty as to whether or not the British had ever established permanent settlements which had then been taken into the possession of the Spanish crown. After the cabinet had assessed the information from Meares, a message from the king (drafted by Pitt) was laid before parliament on 5 May noting that two ships flying British flags (the other ships had been operating under Portuguese colours) had been taken by the Spanish and that Spain had established an exclusive right to trade on that coast. This provoked a great public uproar and a clamour for war against Spain. A fleet of forty ships was assembled, under the command of Lord Howe, which became known as &#145;the Spanish armament of 1790&#146;. In the face of this threat, the Spanish government eventually acceded to British demands in August, and the Anglo-Spanish Convention of 28 October 1790 saw the restoration of all land taken from British subjects and the opening of trade on the north-west coast of America to all nations. The political excitement created great interest in Meares's voyages and mercantile schemes, and encouraged him to publish a number of books and pamphlets relating to his travels and the exploration of the coast of north-west America, in addition to items associated with his dispute with George Dixon. As the crisis passed, however, Meares disappeared from public view. It does not appear that he had any further service in the navy; but on 26 February 1795 he was promoted to the rank of commander. He died in 1809.<br>
