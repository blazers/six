<span class="headword">Collins,  (Edward James) Mortimer</span>  (1827&#150;1876), <span class="occ">novelist and journalist</span>, was born on 29 June 1827 at Plymouth, Devon, the only child of Francis Collins, a solicitor and mathematician, and his wife, Maud Branscombe (<i>d</i>. 1873) of Devon. Francis Collins published a volume called <span class="italic">Spiritual Songs</span> (1824) and died in 1839.<br>
<br>Collins was educated at private schools, and while still a schoolboy contributed to papers. He was eager to become a journalist, but his mother encouraged him to accept a teaching post at Queen Elizabeth College, Guernsey, where he taught mathematics from 1849 until 1856. On 9 May 1850 he married Susan Crump (1807/8&#150;1867), daughter of John Hubbard and widow of the Revd J. H. Crump; they had one daughter, Mabel Collins.<br>
<br>While at Guernsey, Collins started the <span class="italic">Channel Islands Magazine</span> in 1853, which folded after three issues, and published his first collection of poetry, <span class="italic">Idyls and Rhymes</span>, in 1855. In 1856 he left Guernsey to concentrate on literature. He became a well-known journalist, at first working on the <span class="italic">Leamington Mercury</span> from 1856, moving to the <span class="italic">Plymouth Mail</span> three years later, and editing the <span class="italic">Nottingham Guardian</span> in 1861. While he adopted a worldly pose and was known as the &#145;King of the Bohemians&#146;, in his early years he was essentially conservative and a lover of old fashions in books and in his principles. He had strong religious sentiments and an aversion to positivists and freethinkers. In 1862 he bought a cottage at Knowl Hill, Berkshire, which was to become his permanent home. He edited <span class="italic">The Selected Works of Walter Scott</span> for the popular <span class="roman">Moxon Miniature Poets</span> series in 1865.<br>
<br>Collins published one of his better known novels, <span class="italic">Who is the Heir?</span>, in 1865, which ran to several editions and was reissued posthumously. He was appointed joint editor of the <span class="italic">London Globe</span> in 1866, the paper with which he was to be especially associated, though he was to write for many journals, including <span class="italic">Punch</span> and the <span class="italic">British Quarterly</span>, throughout his life. His wife, Susan, died on 5 August 1867, and on 4 May 1868 he married Frances Dunn Cotton (1841&#150;1886); the couple settled at Knowl Hill. In 1869 he suffered a debilitating attack of rheumatic fever, which weakened his heart. Two years later he produced a second collection of poems, <span class="italic">The Inn of Strange Meetings and other Poems</span>, which the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> described as &#145;full of rich and delicate humour&#146;  (Allibone, <span class="italic">Dict.</span>). In 1871 he also published <span class="italic">The Marquis and the Merchant</span>, considered his best novel, and a collection of essays, <span class="italic">The Secret of Long Life</span>, first issued anonymously. These essays went through five editions and became his most successful work.<br>
<br>Collins was a prolific writer, producing seventeen novels and several volumes of poetry as well as miscellaneous essays and articles during twenty years. His literary friendships included that of R. D. Blackmore, whose influence can be seen throughout his fiction, particularly in the melodramatic <span class="italic">Sweet Anne Page</span> (1868). Collins's novels were light romances, showing, in the words of the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, &#145;a tendency to display the more attractive side of life, but not to delve beneath the surface&#146;  (26 Aug 1876). It was also noted that &#145;his plots construct themselves, and his heroes run away with him&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Academy</span>, vol. 12, 182). His second wife, Frances, was not only his muse, as her brother gallantly suggests in his preface to the <span class="italic">Selected Works of Mortimer Collins</span> (1877): &#145;Those who know Mrs Collins will understand why Mortimer Collins' poetical faculties developed during the last decade of his life&#146;  (Cotton, Preface). Frances was also co-author of the novels <span class="italic">Frances</span> (1874), <span class="italic">Sweet and Twenty</span> (1875), and <span class="italic">The Village Comedy</span> (1876). Collins died of heart disease on 28 July 1876 at Nightingale Hall, Richmond, London, after a short illness. He was buried on 1 August at Petersham churchyard, Richmond. After his death his wife published several novels as well as a memoir of her husband.<br>
<br>Collins's daughter, Mabel (1851&#150;1927), married Keningale Cook in 1871, but they were separated about 1880 when he became mentally ill. She was also a novelist and wrote on women's suffrage, occultism, and antivivisection. Her autobiographical novel, <span class="italic">In the Flower of her Youth</span> (1883), contains a description of her childhood and a portrait of her father in the figure of &#145;Brough Warrington, the King of Bohemia&#146;.<br>
