</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Monson, Sir  (William Bonnar) Leslie</span>  (1912&#150;1993), <span class="occ">colonial official</span>, was born on 28 May 1912 at 2 Comely Bank Street, Edinburgh, the only son of John William Monson (1881/2&#150;1929), tax inspector, and his wife, Selina Leslie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stewart (<i>d</i>. 1958). His parents came originally from Ulster, but had settled in Edinburgh after their marriage. Monson's father died prematurely in 1929 before his son had completed his education. Fortunately, however, Monson was blessed with academic ability, and scholarships helped his progress through Edinburgh Academy and Hertford College, Oxford. He was dux at Edinburgh in 1930 with prizes in history, English, and classics (though under physical activity he could only record &#145;corporal in the OTC&#146;). At Oxford he gained a second class in classical moderations, followed by a first in modern history in 1934. The following year he passed into the administrative grade of the home civil service and was posted to the Dominions Office as an assistant principal. In 1938 he became private secretary to the permanent under-secretary, Sir Edward Harding. In 1939 he transferred to the much larger Colonial Office as a principal, securing promotion to assistant secretary in charge of the production and marketing department in 1944.<br>
<br>A chance to make a real mark came in 1947 with Monson's appointment as chief secretary to the west African council, based in Accra. This council comprised the secretary of state for the colonies and the governors of the British west African colonies, and their task was to co-ordinate British policy in west Africa. While based in Accra he married, on 2 October 1948, Helen Isobel, daughter of Roland Francis Browne, of Ceylon; she was at that time working for the British Council in west Africa (for which she was in 1949 made MBE). His quiet tact had previously been demonstrated by his promptly vacating a British Council house he had been lent which she claimed to be rightfully hers. His sensitivity to racial issues was demonstrated at this time when, producing <span class="italic">The Pirates of Penzance</span>, he arranged for the very modern major-general to have six white and six black daughters. District officers far up country were surprised but gratified to find that Monson, despite his wide-ranging task, knew of and encouraged their efforts to improve their districts. He was appointed CMG in 1950.<br>
<br>On returning to the Colonial Office in 1951 Monson was promoted to assistant under-secretary, initially supervising the work of the production, marketing, and research departments, and leading colonial delegations to international conferences on sugar, rubber, and tin. In 1959 he returned to geographical responsibilities. His supervision of the east and central African departments was later extended to cover Aden and southern Africa, and Monson attended the relevant independence conferences at Lancaster House. At the conference leading to Zambian independence Kenneth Kaunda came to have great respect for Monson, and may have asked that he should be Britain's first high commissioner in Lusaka. At any rate he was so appointed, serving there from 1964 to 1966. He was appointed CB in 1964 and advanced to KCMG in 1965. As later high commissioners were to find, good relations between Britain and Zambia were hard to maintain because of the bedevilling factor of the declaration of unilateral independence by Southern Rhodesia. There was also the particular problem of the unpredictability of Wilson's government. For example, President Kaunda would hear on the BBC that Wilson's government was to hold talks with the Rhodesian rebels many hours before Monson had been officially briefed about such a change of policy. Kaunda would then refuse to see Monson. At other times Kaunda would press Monson for news of Wilson's intentions which he was unable to supply. It was not long before security grilles had to be installed at the high commission.<br>
<br>On his return to London, Monson was advanced to deputy under-secretary in 1967, supervising the Commonwealth Office departments for sub-Saharan Africa. With the merger of the Commonwealth and Foreign offices in 1968 his responsibilities extended to all sub-Saharan departments from both offices. During this period the problem of oil sanctions against Rhodesia was prominent, and Monson and others were subsequently featured in the Bingham report on that subject, though without harm to Monson's career. His status as one of the most experienced and able members of the former Colonial Office was recognized in his next and last posting, in 1969, to supervise the remaining dependent territories (as the remnants of the colonial empire had been titled). There he was able to maintain continuity with the welfare outlook of his old department until his retirement in 1972.<br>
<br>After retirement Monson was asked to serve on a commission on the future of the Gilbert and Ellice islands (now Kiribatu and Tuvalu), requiring some journeys by canoe. In 1975 he was made a knight of St John and director of the overseas relations branch of St John Ambulance, liaising with more than forty overseas branches and introducing regional conferences. He gave up this post in 1981. Former colleagues and friends continued to visit the Monsons at their home in Blackheath thereafter.<br>
<br>In later life Monson acquired an avuncular aura: tall, moustached, pipe smoking, unthreatening in manner, and tactful but decisive. He was a man of considerable ability and humane in outlook, who played a significant but unobtrusive part in the largely peaceful transition of British colonies to independence. He died at his home, Golf House, Goffers Road, Blackheath, London, on 3 July 1993. He was survived by his wife. They had no children.<br>
