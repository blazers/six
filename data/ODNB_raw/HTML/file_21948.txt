<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Percy,  John</span>  (1817&#150;1889), <span class="occ">metallurgist</span>, was born at Nottingham on 23 March 1817, the third son of Henry Percy, a solicitor. He went to a private school at Southampton, and then returned to Nottingham, where he attended chemical lectures by a Mr Grisenthwaite at the local school of medicine. He wished to become a chemist, but yielded to his father's desire that he should graduate in medicine, and in April 1834 was taken by his brother Edmund to Paris to begin his medical studies. While in Paris he attended the lectures of Gay-Lussac and Th&eacute;nard on chemistry, and of A. de Jussieu on botany. In 1836 he went on a tour in Switzerland and the south of France, and compiled a large collection of mineralogical and botanical specimens. In the same year he went to Edinburgh, where he became a pupil of Sir Charles Bell and a friend of Edward Forbes. In 1838 he graduated MD in the university, and obtained a gold medal for a thesis on the presence of alcohol in the brain after poisoning by that substance.<br>
<br>In June 1839 Percy married Grace Mary (<i>d</i>. 1880), daughter of J. E. Piercy, of Warley Hall, Birmingham. In the same year he was elected physician to the Queen's Hospital, Birmingham, but, having private means, did not practise. The metallurgical works in the neighbourhood excited his interest in metallurgy. In 1846 he worked with David Forbes and William Hallowes Miller on crystallized slags. In 1847 he became a fellow of the Royal Society, and served on the council from 1857 to 1859. In 1848 he contributed a paper to the <span class="italic">Chemist</span> on a mode of extracting silver from its ores (depending on the solubility of the chloride in sodium thiosulphate), which led to the Von Patera process, used at Joachimsthal, and the Russell process, employed in the western states of America. In 1851 he was elected fellow of the Geological Society, and was appointed lecturer on metallurgy and metallurgist to the museum at the newly founded Metropolitan School of Science in London, under Sir Henry Thomas De la Beche; the post was later made a professorship.<br>
<br>The influence exerted by Percy, while holding this position, on English metallurgy was of the utmost importance. As he said in his inaugural address, metallurgy was then looked on as an empirical art, and &#145;experience without scientific knowledge [was thought] more trustworthy than the like experience with it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nature</span>, 206). He was an excellent lecturer and teacher, and most English metallurgists of his time were his pupils. Although the silver process was the only metallurgical one he actually invented, his work suggested many others; the important Thomas-Gilchrist process for making Bessemer steel from iron ores containing phosphorus was an outcome of his work and was discovered by his pupils. In 1851 he undertook to superintend the analysis of a large number of specimens of iron and steel collected by his friend, S. H. Blackwell, that were exhibited at the 1851 exhibition and later displayed at the geological museum in Jermyn Street. His results constituted the first serious attempt at a survey of iron ore deposits in Britain. They were included in the volume <span class="italic">Iron and Steel</span> (1864), part of his great <span class="italic">Treatise on Metallurgy</span>, of which the first volume was published in 1861. This treatise (1861&#150;80), which remained uncompleted, contains over 3500 pages of terse and exact description of metallurgical processes, of minute and scientific discussion of the chemical problems they involve, often based on the author's careful original research, and of suggestions for future investigation. The drawings of plants are remarkably exact. The book, which was translated into French and German, and became a classic, involved an immense amount of labour.<br>
<br>Percy was appointed lecturer on metallurgy to the artillery officers at Woolwich about 1864, and he retained this post until his death. He was appointed superintendent of ventilation of the houses of parliament on 6 February 1865. He was also a member of the secretary for war's commissions on the application of iron for defensive purposes (1861) and on Gibraltar shields (1867), and of the royal commissions on coal (1871) and the spontaneous combustion of coal in ships (1875). In 1876 he was awarded the Bessemer medal of the Iron and Steel Institute, of which he was an honorary member, serving as president during 1885 and 1886. In December 1879 the government decided to complete the removal of the Royal School of Mines from the Museum of Practical Geology in Jermyn Street to South Kensington. Objecting strongly to this course, Percy twice offered to rebuild the metallurgical laboratory in Jermyn Street, but his offer was refused and he resigned in December 1879. He circulated a pamphlet containing his views on the subject. He received the freedom of the Turners' Company in 1883. He was an honorary member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and in 1887 he was awarded a Miller prize. He received the Albert gold medal of the Society of Arts on his deathbed in 1889. He died at his home, 1 Gloucester Crescent, Hyde Park, London, on 19 June 1889.<br>
<br>Percy was very tall and spare, and had a strong physique and a commanding presence. He frequented the Athenaeum and Garrick clubs, and was of a genial, though at times brusque, temper. He took an interest in social and political questions, on which he wrote many trenchant letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span> under the signature &#145;Y&#146;, and he could not refrain from denouncing the home rule movement in his presidential address to the Iron and Steel Institute in 1886. A fair artist himself, he made a valuable collection of watercolour drawings and engravings which were sold in 1890. The manuscript catalogue of the watercolour drawings was bought by the British Museum. Percy's collection of metallurgical specimens was deposited in the museum at South Kensington. The Royal Society's catalogue of scientific papers lists twenty-one papers published by Percy singly, one in conjunction with W. H. Miller, and one with R. Smith.<br>
