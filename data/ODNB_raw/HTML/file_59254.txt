<span class="headword">Tylecote <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Phythian]</span>, Dame  Mabel</span>  (1896&#150;1987), <span class="occ">adult educationist</span>, was born on 4 February 1896 in Crumpsall, Manchester, the daughter of John Ernest Phythian (1858&#150;1935), a solicitor, journalist, and university extension lecturer, and his wife, Ada Prichard Crompton (<i>d</i>. 1931). She spent her childhood at Holmes Chapel in Cheshire, where she was taught by a relative, before attending Beachfield School in Wilmslow between the ages of ten and thirteen. John Phythian was a disciple of Ruskin and Morris and an active member of that distinctive Manchester &eacute;lite which sought to improve social and cultural opportunities for the poor. A member of Manchester city council (1892&#150;8), he was involved with the University Settlement, the Ancoats Art Museum, the Manchester and Salford Sanitary Association, and the Social Questions Union. Mabel Phythian's early awareness of social issues led her to follow her father's example and leave the Liberal Party for Labour at the age of eighteen. She joined the prestigious and influential Manchester University history department in 1915, graduating in 1919, and was recognized by T. F. Tout as a woman of &#145;first class calibre. She has keen interests, extensive knowledge, an unusual measure of enterprise and character and an exceptional amount of public spirit&#146;  (testimonial, 15 June 1922, Tylecote MSS).<br>
<br>Manchester University was then an exciting place for women, with a tradition in the women's department of political awareness and public service. Mabel Phythian was stimulated by the encouragement given to women by the staff and became secretary to the Women's Union as well as working with the developing Ashburne Hall for female students. An interest in academic women took her to Paris in 1921 for the international conference of the Federation of University Women. The 1920s were spent in academic study and teaching at the University of Wisconsin (1919&#150;20), Huddersfield Technical College humanities department (1920&#150;24), and as an assistant lecturer at Manchester University (1926&#150;30), during which time she gained her PhD. This research in what was to remain her first love, adult education, was later published as <span class="italic">The Mechanics' Institutes of Lancashire and Yorkshire before 1851</span> (1957). The fiftieth anniversary of the admission of women to Owens College fell in 1933 and she was invited to commemorate this by a book, <span class="italic">The Education of Women at Manchester University 1883 to 1933</span> (1941), which is a landmark in the study of women in higher education. It was her work as a Workers' Educational Association (WEA) lecturer, begun at this time, which symbolized that concern for social justice and adult education which was to characterize the rest of her life. A brief but influential break from academic life was taken from 1930 to 1932 when she was warden of the Elvington Settlement on the Kent coal field, where she demonstrated, in R. H. Tawney's words, &#145;human sympathies and insight&#146;  (R. H. Tawney, letter, 21 July 1930, Tylecote MSS).<br>
<br>In 1932 Mabel Phythian married, as his second wife, Frank Edward Tylecote (<i>d</i>. 1965), a Manchester councillor and professor of medicine at Manchester University (1929&#150;40). From 1935 to the 1950s Mabel Tylecote worked under the aegis of the Manchester University joint committee for adult education, serving as vice-president of the WEA from 1960 to 1968 and as chairwoman of the National Institute of Adult Education (1960&#150;63). As Manchester began the immense work of slum clearance and the creation of new working-class communities in the 1930s, stimulated by the gift of the Wythenshawe estate by Ernest Simon, she became a passionate advocate of community development that not only improved housing but enhanced the quality of life, a concern traceable back to her student days when she had been involved with the radical University Settlement in Ancoats. She was a founder of the Manchester and District New Estates Federation and became president of the National Federation of Community Associations in 1958. In the post-war years she supported the National Council for Civil Liberties and the National Council of Social Service, and was a member of the Pensions Appeal Tribunal from 1944 to 1950.<br>
<br>It was natural that Mabel Tylecote's academic interests, her socialism, and deep awareness of inequalities in society led to an interest in politics, but it was the depression and the appeasement of fascism which made her seek a parliamentary seat in 1938. Her political career at local and national level might be judged a failure, for she fought five parliamentary elections as a Labour candidate in three constituencies&#151;Fylde, Middleton and Prestwich, and Norwich South&#151;without success from 1938 to 1955, and although on Manchester city council from 1940 to 1951 and a member of Stockport council from 1956 to 1963 she was never a powerful political force. However, the significance of her participation should not be underestimated. Her national election campaigns in Lancashire and Norfolk were powerful expositions of Attleean socialism, which contributed to greater understanding of the party and the concept of politically directed social reform: &#145;We seek by the control of selfish interests, freedom to plan our inheritance, to create those conditions and build up those services which will give to our people at last dignified, free and happy lives&#146;  (Election pamphlet, July 1945, Tylecote MSS). Her self-confident, energetic personality did much to enhance the still insecure image of women in public life and her vigorous campaigns increased the Labour vote. In local government she was a powerful advocate of improved living conditions, provision for leisure, and greater access to education. As a very active co-opted member of the Manchester education committee from 1951 to 1977 she ensured a high profile for issues of access and support. Through years of austerity and continuing Conservatism she represented generous and enlightened reform. At a sensitive time politically she never wavered from an internationalist outlook, developing close links with German adult education after the war, advocating close cultural links with the Soviet Union, and making many contacts with adult education in Europe.<br>
<br>Mabel Tylecote was made DBE in 1966 for &#145;political and public services&#146;. She remained closely associated with her university, but extended support to the new polytechnic in Manchester and was an active member of court, council, and governing body. In 1973 the polytechnic awarded her an honorary fellowship (a building in its successor, the Manchester Metropolitan University, commemorates her). In 1978 she became an honorary LLD of the Victoria University. Through an extremely active life of public speaking (she was a lay preacher) and laborious committee work she acted as a bridge between the older philanthropic reform of her family tradition and the concept of the welfare state. A truer estimate of her contribution than election results was demonstrated in both the respect and affection which permeated the commiserations when she lost her council seat in 1951, that of Eric James being typical in its regret of &#145;the loss of someone with your knowledge and enthusiasms&#146;  (Tylecote MSS). She and her distinguished co-worker in Manchester, Lady Shena Simon, represent a key group of middle-class women, not yet given their due by historians of the women's movement, who continued the struggle after the better-known pioneers identified and recorded in her 1941 book had passed away.<br>
<br>Dame Mabel lived with her husband, son, and two stepchildren at Heaton Lodge, Stockport. Late in life she moved back to Manchester, where she died at her home, Alexandra House, 359 Wilbraham Road, Whalley Range, on 31 January 1987. She was cremated at Manchester crematorium.<br>
