<span class="headword">Frederick, Sir  Charles</span>  (1709&#150;1785), <span class="occ">politician and antiquary</span>, was born on 21 December 1709 in Madras, the third son of Sir Thomas Frederick (1681&#150;1730), at that time a member of the council of Fort St George, on the east coast of India, and of Mary Moncrieff (<i>c</i>.1689&#150;1767), his wife. He was educated at Westminster School and at New College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 19 March 1725; he entered the Middle Temple on 1 February 1728. Frederick was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1731 and of the Royal Society in 1733. In January 1736 he was chosen director of the Society of Antiquaries and served until 1738, when he resigned the office in order to travel abroad. With his elder brother John he travelled to Italy, and from Italy went as far east as Constantinople. He returned by way of Paris and was back in London by January 1741, when he again took up his post as director of the Society of Antiquaries. He declined re-election the following year after his election to parliament. Some of his reports on, and illustrations of, excavated antiquities remain with the society. His drawings of architectural antiquities survive in the three volumes, <span class="italic">Ancient Buildings &hellip; Drawn by Smart Lethuillier, Esq., &hellip; and by Charles Frederick, Esq.</span>, which came into the hands of Horace Walpole and are now in the British Library. He was something of an amateur architect as well, for he designed the monument to Lucy, Lady Lyttelton, in Hagley church, Worcestershire, and the monument to Thomas Miller, bishop of Waterford, in Highclere church, Hampshire.<br>
<br>Frederick was elected member of parliament for New Shoreham in 1741 and served until 1754, when he was elected for Queenborough, where the Ordnance office, for which he was by then working, had great influence. He sat for Queenborough until 1784, voting consistently for the government until 1782, when he followed North out of office, and confining his few interventions to matters relating to the Ordnance department. He was created knight of the Bath on 23 March 1761.<br>
<br>In 1746 Frederick was appointed comptroller of the royal laboratory at Woolwich and clerk of the deliveries, the most junior of the &#145;great officers&#146; who made up the membership of his majesty's honourable Board of Ordnance. There is some evidence that he owed his entry into the office to the patronage of the second duke of Montagu, a fellow member of the Society of Antiquaries and master-general of the Ordnance. As comptroller he was responsible for the firework display on 27 April 1749 in celebration of the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, for which Handel's &#145;Music for the Royal Fireworks&#146; was composed. He was appointed to the post of surveyor-general, the second most senior of the civilian members of the board, on 10 April 1750, a post he held, along with the comptrollership of the laboratory, until 1782. As surveyor he was responsible for the procurement of military supplies, and can loosely be described as the technical member of the board. Almost his first action was to report to the board in June 1750 the &#145;many unaccountable Irregularities with which the Small Gun Office hath heretofore abounded&#146;  (TNA: PRO, WO 55/1816, 7&#150;8) and under his direction &#145;A System and a Proposed Regulation for carrying on the Business for the future in the Surveyor General's Branch&#146; was approved in January 1751. It laid down the records that were to be kept and the checks that were to be carried out to ensure that equipment supplied was in accordance with the specification, before any bills submitted could be approved for payment. This system lasted in its essentials until methods were changed under pressure of the needs of the wars against France at the end of the century.<br>
<br>Frederick seems to have taken considerable interest in the design of small arms, and among other details personally approved the design of a new carbine for the officers of the Royal Artillery in 1750 as well as the pattern of firearms made especially for presentation to the Iroquois in North America in 1753. Unfortunately all the official letter-books of the surveyor-general's department have been lost, the only exception being one covering the years 1761&#150;7, in the New York Public Library, which seems to have been used intermittently when Frederick was away from the office. It shows him involved in the details of gun salutes in honour of the king's coronation, in equipping military expeditions, and in negotiating supplies to such foreign clients as Algiers and Portugal. The deliveries to Portugal that began in 1762 marked the beginning of more than 130 years' imitation by Portugal of British arms design. The only non-ordnance entries are a few relating to government or other official posts in his constituency of Queenborough, part of the care expected of any member of parliament.<br>
<br>On 18 August 1746 Frederick married Lucy Boscawen (1710&#150;1784), eldest daughter of Hugh Boscawen, first Viscount Falmouth, and his wife, Charlotte Godfrey. They had six children: four sons, three of whom, Charles, Thomas Lennox, and Edward Boscawen, survived their father, and two daughters, Augusta and Lucy. His principal residence in London was in Berkeley Square. He also had a villa in landscaped gardens on the banks of the Thames at Hammersmith, bought for him out of money left for the purpose in the will of his grandfather, Thomas Frederick, and for many years he rented a &#145;shooting-house&#146; near Boston in Lincolnshire.<br>
<br>When Frederick lost his post at the fall of Lord North's ministry in 1782, he petitioned for a pension, pleading extreme poverty. This was granted by the Fox&#150;North coalition, and he did not stand for parliament in 1784. He died at his villa in Hammersmith on 18 December 1785. His will ordered that he should be buried in the family vault in St Olave Jewry, London. An obituary appeared in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> of December 1785 and, by the terms of his will, his &#145;library and museum&#146; were sold by auction in July 1786, and his Hammersmith villa in May 1787.<br>
