<span class="headword">Davidson,  John</span>  (1857&#150;1909), <span class="occ">schoolteacher and writer</span>, was born on 11 April 1857 at Barrhead, Renfrewshire, the son of Alexander Davidson, a minister of the Evangelical Union, and his wife, Helen Davidson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Crockett. When he was nine the family moved to Greenock, Renfrewshire, where his father had been appointed to the ministry of the church in Nelson Street. Greenock, an industrial town and port on the Firth of Clyde, is undoubtedly the setting of Davidson's major autobiographical poem, &#145;A Ballad in Blank Verse of the Making of a Poet&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ballads and Songs</span>, 1894).<br>
<br>From 1870 to 1871 Davidson was employed in the chemical laboratory of Walker's, the Greenock sugar firm, and subsequently became an assistant in the office of the town's public analyst. Such employment contributed to the making of a poet whose subject matter would draw on science. In 1872 he returned to his old school at Greenock, Highlanders' Academy, as a pupil teacher. Intellectually restless, with no academic cast of mind, he spent only one year (1876&#150;7) as a student at Edinburgh University. He was subsequently a teacher of English at Alexander's charity school, Glasgow (1877&#150;8), Perth Academy (1878&#150;81), Kelvinside Academy, Glasgow (1881&#150;2), and Hutchinson's charity school, Paisley (1883&#150;4). After a year as a clerk in the Glasgow office of a thread firm, he returned to teaching at Morrison's academy, Crieff, Perthshire (1885&#150;8), where he protested at the rector's cruelty to the pupils; his short story &#145;The Schoolboy's Tragedy&#146; is an indictment of petty authoritarianism in Scottish education. Although in his play <span class="italic">Smith: a Tragic Farce</span> (1888) Davidson called schoolteaching &#145;mental boot-blacking&#146;, he was remembered as an inspirational instructor, particularly in his classes on poetry.<br>
<br>On 23 October 1885 Davidson married Margaret Cameron McArthur, daughter of John McArthur, dean of guild of Perth, and his wife, Menzies Grant McArthur, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McDonald. They had two sons, Alexander and Menzies. Davidson's last teaching post was at a private school in Greenock (1888&#150;9); this also marked the virtual end of his residence in Scotland, with the subsequent move to London and the south of England. He was to return to Scotland for brief writing retreats in the early 1900s, most notably to Blairlogie at the foot of the Ochil hills near Stirling, another part of Scotland much celebrated in his writing.<br>
<br>The bulk of Davidson's early work, composed while he was still in Scotland, is in the form of verse-drama: <span class="italic">Diabolus amans</span> (1885); <span class="italic">Bruce</span> (1886), a historical play based on the warrior-king of Scotland, Robert the Bruce; and <span class="italic">Smith: a Tragic Farce</span> (1888), concerning a Nietzschean-style &#145;Overman&#146; who despises the constraints of bourgeois mediocrity. In deploying drama Davidson allowed his characters to articulate ideas to which he could avoid making his own overt commitment; nevertheless, and although he rejected his father's Christianity, his quasi-autobiographical characters display an evangelical fervour in their quest for personal and intellectual fulfilment as against conventional pieties. Existential assertiveness animates the protagonists of &#145;Thirty Bob a Week&#146;, the monologue of a poor but proud clerk, and &#145;A Ballad of a Nun&#146;; these are two of the most notable (and in the latter case notorious) poems of Davidson's <i>annus mirabilis</i>, 1894.<br>
<br>Davidson's Victorian earnestness is offset by a pre-modernist, carnivalesque humour, seen in such novels as <span class="italic">The North Wall</span> (1885; reprinted in 1891 together with a selection of short stories in <span class="italic">The Great Men, and A Practical Novelist</span>), <span class="italic">Perfervid: the Career of Ninian Jamieson</span> (1890), and the play <span class="italic">Scaramouch in Naxos</span> (1890), which looks forward to twentieth-century reworkings of <i>commedia dell'arte</i>. <span class="italic">A Full and True Account of the Wonderful Mission of Earl Lavender</span> (1895) is a spirited spoof on 1890s high camp. He evolved a concept of irony which delighted in the coexistence of extreme opposites; accordingly, he could deny that he subscribed to any one-sided set of beliefs. For example, although influenced by Nietzsche, he disclaimed discipleship. Even so, it is missionary zeal rather than transcendent irony which characterizes such later work as the five blank verse <span class="italic">Testaments</span> published between 1901 and 1908, and the unfinished trilogy of plays, <span class="italic">God and Mammon</span> (1907&#150;8). Such deeply philosophical poetry expounds a scientific materialism and atheistic humanism: man is matter evolved to its highest form, and the individual of the species must assert his or her will.<br>
<br>For most of the period between 1890 and 1907 Davidson and his family lived in London where he worked as a journalist, contributing regularly to <span class="italic">The Speaker</span> and also to <span class="italic">The Star</span>, the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span>, and the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>. He was a publisher's reader for two houses: John Lane during the 1890s, and Grant Richards from 1907 to 1909. He became a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95480', "Rhymers' Club")</script> but maintained a typical aloofness; he was ambivalent in his attitude to nineties decadence, and his fellow poets (notably W. B. Yeats) regarded him as a serious, tough-minded Scot. Journalism, like teaching, he viewed as an economic necessity, distracting him from his vocation as a poet; however, it did provide him with raw material for his poetry, as in <span class="italic">Fleet Street Eclogues</span> (1893; 2nd ser., 1896). Financial, family, and professional problems led to a breakdown late in 1896, followed by two years' recuperation at Shoreham on the Sussex coast. In 1899 he received a grant from the Royal Literary Fund and in 1906 was awarded a civil-list pension. His last two years were spent in Penzance, Cornwall, where the family had moved in 1907 to escape the pressures of London; this did not stop him becoming ill and depressed. On 23 March 1909 he failed to return from his customary coastal walk. Six months later his body was recovered from the sea, at Mousehole harbour, near Penzance, and although the coroner returned a verdict of &#145;accidental death&#146;, Davidson's own final utterances had demonstrated an inclination towards suicide. On 21 September he was, according to his own wishes, buried at sea, 7 miles off Penzance.<br>
<br>Davidson influenced the careers of two of the greatest English-language poets of the twentieth century: T. S. Eliot acknowledged his discovery of Davidson's urban images, so crucial to the making of the poet of <span class="italic">The Waste Land</span>; C. M. Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid) responded to the scientific materialism and its paradoxically mystical possibilities. The standard edition of Davidson's verse is <span class="italic">The Poems of John Davidson</span>, edited by Andrew Turnbull in two volumes and published by the Scottish Academic Press in 1973. His fiction is far from negligible, and his essays reinforce his position as an early modernist; above all, however, it is his poetry which has secured his reputation.<br>
