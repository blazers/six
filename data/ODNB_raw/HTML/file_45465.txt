<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Turbervill,  Edith  Picton-</span>  (1872&#150;1960), <span class="occ">social reformer</span>, was born on 13 June 1872 at Lower House, Fownhope, Herefordshire, the daughter of Captain John Picton-Warlow (<i>b</i>. 1838), an officer in the Indian army, and his second wife, Eleanor Temple (<i>d</i>. 1887). She and her twin Beatrice were the third and fourth children of the eight sons and three daughters (including three sets of twins) born of this marriage; her father had also had two children from a previous marriage. Edith and several siblings spent their early years in Brighton in the care of a maiden aunt, but in 1883 her parents returned from India and after a brief spell in Bruges moved the family to the Vale of Glamorgan in Wales. There Edith passed a happy and vigorous country childhood, seemingly little marred by the death of her mother in 1887 and her father's remarriage two years later. Initially educated by governesses, she was sent to the Royal School in Bath in her late teens.<br>
<br>In 1892 John Picton-Warlow inherited the Ewenni Priory estate and took the name Picton-Turbervill. The family now entered a period of real affluence, and Edith led the life of a country squire's daughter, attending house parties and balls, and teaching Sunday school at the local church. On 13 June 1895, however, in the unlikely venue of an express train from London to Bridgend, she had a conversion experience, and from that date entered on a life of religious activism. She began by proselytizing to the navvies building the Vale of Glamorgan Railway, and then secured her father's consent to train for a year in mission work at a Mildmay school in London (a training that included &#145;practical work&#146; in the Shoreditch slums) and then to take a post with the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) in India. With the exception of a year's return to England following a bout of typhoid in 1905, Picton-Turbervill remained in India from 1900 until 1908, where she in turn lectured on English literature at a women's college in Calcutta, founded (with Mary Dobson) a settlement for university women in Kamballa, opened a holiday home for Indian girls in Simla, and (with Marjorie Hobbs) co-ordinated YWCA work in Bangalore. Picton-Turbervill enjoyed this mix of social service and evangelism, and left India only after a severe attack of malaria.<br>
<br>She returned to a country and to friends much preoccupied by questions of social reform, and in that atmosphere her own concerns widened. She continued to work for the YWCA, as the chairman of its foreign department in 1909 (and hence responsible for the training of workers sent all over the world) and its national vice-president from 1914 to 1920 and from 1922 to 1928, but she found her theological convictions changing. Believing that women could bring a new spirit of devotion and service to both religious and public life, she joined with Maude Royden to call on the Church of England to open the ministry to women, and published several essays and books&#151;including <span class="italic">Christ and Woman's Power</span> (1919), <span class="italic">Musings of a Lay Woman</span> (1919), and, with Canon Streeter, <span class="italic">Women and the Church</span> (1917)&#151;calling for a return to Christ-centred doctrine and for wider lay involvement within the church. She also became active in the non-militant wing of the women's suffrage movement, and while she worked to set up hostels, canteens, and clubs for women workers during the war (for which she was made an OBE in 1917), she was troubled by the government's bellicose attitude and in 1915 was one of the women who sought unsuccessfully to attend the International Women's Peace Conference at The Hague.<br>
<br>In January of 1919, having concluded that its programme was most in keeping with Christian ethics, Picton-Turbervill joined the Labour Party. Well known in reform-minded circles, she unsuccessfully contested North Islington in November 1922 and Stroud in October 1924, before being returned for The Wrekin in Shropshire in the general election of June 1929. One of only fourteen women MPs (nine of them Labour members) in the 1929&#150;31 parliament, Picton-Turbervill's influence as a back-bencher was limited, but she successfully sponsored a private member's bill outlawing the pronunciation of a sentence of death on a pregnant woman, served on the ecclesiastic committee of the Commons and the Lords and, perhaps equally important, insisted that women MPs (like their male colleagues) be provided with bathing facilities in the Commons. On friendly terms with Ramsay MacDonald, Picton-Turbervill abstained from the &#145;no confidence&#146; motion supported by Labour MPs on the formation of the National Government but declined to join the &#145;National Labour&#146; camp. Remaining in the party, she was defeated in a straight fight against a &#145;national&#146; candidate in October 1931.<br>
<br>In the thirties Picton-Turbervill withdrew from some of her earlier philanthropic involvements but remained active in women's international organizations, leading the British delegation at the International Alliance of Women congresses in Istanbul in 1935 and Copenhagen in 1939. In 1936 she was appointed by J. H. Thomas, then colonial secretary, to a three-member commission to investigate the much-discussed problem of indentured girl servants, known as <i>mui tsai</i>, in Hong Kong and Malaya. Fears that the <i>mui tsai</i> were essentially slaves had been expressed in the Commons on several occasions (including by Picton-Turbervill), and the testimony she heard in Hong Kong and Malaya did not allay them. Breaking with her malleable co-members, she wrote a minority report calling for the registration and inspection of all transferred children; more remarkably, she was able to bring the governor of Malaya, and ultimately the Colonial Office, around to her position, resulting in an expansion of child welfare services in both colonies. During the Second World War she worked for a time for the Ministry of Information.<br>
<br>Picton-Turbervill's life resists easy summary, for she was active in many arenas. Yet all of her commitments&#151;from feminism to labour politics&#151;stemmed from her religious beliefs. Espousing a &#145;Christ-centred&#146; faith, she remained critical of the church, calling for liturgical reform and for the ordination of women long before such positions had much support. And while her religiosity, her philanthropic concerns, her support for sexual purity campaigns, and even her singleness might appear to mark her out as a rather Victorian figure, she was in many respects forthright, pragmatic, and modern. Vigorous, tall (5 feet 10 inches), and physically active, she was very close to her twin sister, Beatrice (who for many years ran a girls' hostel), and maintained a wide circle of women friends, among them Frances Balfour, Chrystal Macmillan, Lilian Baylis, Cicely Hamilton, and Emily Kinnaird, with whom she for a time lived. Distressed by the propensity in the twenties and thirties to label such friendships as &#145;unwholesome&#146; or perverse, in her autobiography published in 1939 Picton-Turbervill insisted &#145;with a ring of challenge&#146; that women's loving friendships could be &#145;as deep, as beautiful, and as exhilarating as any human relationship&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life is Good</span>, 94). Having spent the last years of her life living near Cheltenham, Edith Picton-Turbervill died at Barnwood House Hospital, Barnwood, Gloucestershire, on 31 August 1960.<br>
