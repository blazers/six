<span class="headword">Osgodby,  Adam</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1316), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, came from Osgodby, near Selby in Yorkshire. Although his early career remains obscure, he is known to have acted as attorney for Stephen Mauley in 1286 and 1291, and for William Acon and Walter Percehaye during that period. From 1295 to 1316 he was keeper of the rolls of chancery, and probably owed his place in government to Edward I's long-serving clerk and sometime chancellor, William Hamilton (<i>d</i>. 1307). He was also closely associated with Robert Bardelby and the Airmyn brothers, especially William (<i>d</i>. 1336). From 1307 Osgodby was keeper of the Domus Conversorum, a house for converted Jews situated in Chancery Lane, which was customarily used to deposit chancery records and became a natural residence for chancery clerks visiting London. From 1310, while Walter Reynolds (<i>d</i>. 1327) was chancellor, Osgodby kept the household of the chancery, normally the chancellor's duty and right, and consequently received the usual yearly fee of &pound;500. He was always the first named of those clerks temporarily having custody of the great seal, a task with which he was charged in 1302 (from 23 to 30 September and from 30 October), 1310 (from May to July), and 1311 (from 27 August to 28 September). In the five or so years before his death he was sometimes in charge of the seal for more lengthy periods, from December 1311 to before 5 October 1312; from 17 to 22 April and from 13 June to 16 July 1313; from 31 March until 26 September 1314; and on two occasions in 1315 (2 June and from 14 to 25 November).<br>
<br>Osgodby probably also owed his early ecclesiastical advancement to Hamilton. He was a canon of York from 1289, and in 1293 he was installed as parson of Gargrave. In December 1300 he was granted free warren in all the demesne lands of his prebend of Ulfshelf in Yorkshire and in March 1303 he had wardship of the manor of Drax in the same county by demise of the executors of Edmund, earl of Cornwall (<i>d</i>. 1300). He continued to hold Drax for at least another seven years, since the heir of Philip Paynell was still a minor. In May 1306 he was appointed with Robert Bardelby, a fellow canon and chancery employee, as a proctor for the archbishop of York to attend the king's council. In September 1310 he voted at the election of the new dean of York, Master William Pickering. In 1311 Osgodby was inducted to the church of Bubwith, Yorkshire, on the presentation of Lady Isabella de Vescy, although there was some dispute about her right in this. He also held the prebend of Burford in Shropshire.<br>
<br>Osgodby was no stranger to litigation. An inquest held on 23 August 1304 found that he and his servants were hindered by Hugh Skilhare and others in the field of Winterburn, north of Gargrave, from taking tithes of a yearly value of 100<i>s</i>., which they later recovered in court Christian. In June 1308, as a mark of the special affection for his clerk and for good service to his father, Edward II issued letters to the pope and cardinals &#145;in as good and gracious a form as possible&#146; in order to benefit Osgodby's business in the papal court. Three years later, following a judgment pronounced against them in the court of York, the abbot and convent of Selby appealed to the court of Rome concerning their case against Adam Osgodby. Although the abbot secured a mandate preventing the sheriff from exercising Osgodby's writ of <i>capias</i> pending the business of the appeal, the latter was able to have the appeal declared null. In March 1314, at Osgodby's instance, the abbot and convent of Sawley (within whose patronage the living of Gargrave lay) received absolution from an eight-year sentence of excommunication, no doubt benefiting from the former's influence at court. Osgodby himself served in a judicial capacity, holding assizes in York in 1314. He received a further assize commission in September 1315.<br>
<br>Osgodby died in August 1316. His brother, Walter, succeeded to his estate, and Henry Cliffe (<i>d</i>. 1334), another chancery clerk, was executor of his will.<br>
