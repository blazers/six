<span class="headword">Sigfrid</span> <span class="st"> [St Sigfrid]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>mid-10th&#150;early 11th cent.), <span class="occ">missionary bishop</span>, eludes biography. No record of his activities survives before the late twelfth century, after which Icelandic saga literature and Swedish hagiography combined to produce conflicting accounts of his career. His place of origin in England is nowhere reliably identified in those sources. &#145;Sigefridus&#146;, a bishop, is remembered in an obit list in a thirteenth-century custumary from Glastonbury Abbey  (BL, Add. MS 17450, fol. 5<i>v</i>; under 5 April); in William of Malmesbury's <span class="italic">De antiquitate Glastonie ecclesie</span> (<i>c</i>.1130) &#145;Sigefridus&#146; is identified as <i>episcopus Norwegensis</i>  and a monk of Glastonbury, possibly during the time of King Edgar (<i>r</i>. 957&#150;75). Some have seen this bishop as the (unnamed) churchman who accompanied King H&aacute;kon Adalsteinsf&oacute;stri (H&aacute;kon Athelstan's Foster-Son) from England to Norway in the mid-tenth century. Others have associated him with the bishop named in the thirteenth-century sagas of &Oacute;l&aacute;f Tryggvason as the English companion of that Christianizing king (<i>r</i>. 995&#150;999/1000). A Bishop Siward, who returned to Ramsey Abbey from a period as a missionary in Scandinavia some time after 993 and before 1009, may have been the same man, although the name (probably originally Sigeweard) may invalidate the identification. &Oacute;l&aacute;f Tryggvason's bishop, known in Norwegian and Icelandic saga sources as J&oacute;n-Sigurd, is said to have turned his attention to Sweden after the death of his Norwegian patron, and to have converted and baptized King Olof Sk&ouml;tkonung (<i>r</i>. 995&#150;1022) and many Swedish heathens. He reputedly returned to Norway to assist King &Oacute;l&aacute;f Haraldsson (<i>r</i>. 1014&#150;30) to further the conversion there, after which he resumed his Swedish mission. His place of burial is claimed to be the cathedral of V&auml;xj&ouml;, in southern Sweden, of which see (along with Skara, in V&auml;sterg&ouml;tland) he was purportedly the founder.<br>
<br>No authority is known for the statement of the seventeenth-century Swedish Catholic writer Vastovius  (<span class="italic">Vitis aquilonia</span>, 32) that Sigfrid was canonized by the English pope Adrian IV in 1158, but in the thirteenth century his cult blossomed in Sweden and he was revered as the nation's apostle. Swedish hagiography identified him as an archbishop of York whom the English king, Milred, had sent to King Olof. If there was originally any basis of fact in the Swedish lives, it had clearly been lost or confused before this thirteenth-century flowering, as no contemporary Archbishop Sigfrid or King Milred is known (although a Sigeferth was bishop of Lindsey from <i>c</i>.996 to <i>c</i>.1004. The conversion histories fostered by the different Swedish dioceses sought not so much to preserve a historical account of Sigfrid's life and work as to claim for their churches Sweden's &#145;first&#146; saint and missionary, thereby establishing their primacy. His name stood for missionary endeavour <i>par excellence</i>, so much so that the credentials of contemporary churchmen came to be established by relationship with him: he is credited with a suspicious number of nephews. The date of his death is unknown, but he is commemorated on 15 February in medieval Scandinavian calendars. His apparent longevity and ubiquitousness (and, potentially, two obit dates), suggest that several Sigfrids were at work in the Scandinavian mission field, but the evidence does not allow separate identities and achievements to be distinguished.<br>
