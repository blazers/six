<span class="headword">Colefax <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Halsey]</span>,  Sibyl Sophie Julia</span>, Lady Colefax  (1874&#150;1950), <span class="occ">hostess and interior decorator</span>, was born on 4 December 1874, at The Poplars, Wimbledon Common, Surrey (the house of her uncle, Walter Bagehot). She was the third but only surviving daughter (and fifth and last child) of William Stirling Halsey (1831&#150;1902), and his unhappily married wife, Sophie Victoria (1840&#150;1926), daughter of James Wilson. Living mainly at Cawnpore until her father's retirement from the Bengal civil service in 1883, she was bright and imaginative but felt excluded and neglected. After schooling in Putney and Wimbledon she lived in genteel indigence as her mother's travelling companion, &#145;running after old ladies with their knitting&#146;  (Woolf, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 3.116). Conversations about books and art with John Lockwood Kipling initially showed this receptive, lonely young woman how her life might be enhanced and enriched. A visit in 1894 to Italy, where she befriended Bernard Berenson, gave further intellectual and emotional nourishment.<br>
<br>In July 1901 Sibyl married (Henry) Arthur Colefax (1866&#150;1936), barrister, the son of Joseph Samuel Colefax, a chartered accountant. They had two sons. Her husband, who was Unionist MP for South-West Manchester (January to December 1910) and took silk in 1912, specialized in Anglo-German patent and trade-mark law. He suffered a serious and permanent diminution of his practice in 1914, but was consoled with legal offices and was created KBE in 1920. A tolerant and good-humoured husband, he was described by Kenneth Clark as &#145;a heavy man with a very large face, who was thought by those who had never visited the provinces to be the biggest bore in England&#146;  (Clark, 212).<br>
<br>The Colefaxes had many political and legal friends, but were also connoisseurs of literature, music, drama, and the fine arts. Living first at 85 Onslow Square and later Old Buckhurst in Sussex, but famously from 1921 at Argyll House in Chelsea, Sibyl Colefax fulfilled her appetite for life and curiosity about people by creating a salon which represented the height of intelligent, discriminating pleasures. &#145;The Coalbox&#146;, as she was nicknamed, first won wider fame in London society by organizing a poetry reading in aid of charity (12 December 1917). &#145;Mrs. Colefax's star-climbing wagon&#146;, as her fellow organizer Robert Ross called it  (Ross, 318), was chaired by Edmund Gosse; T. S. Eliot, three Sitwells, and Aldous Huxley recited (Siegfried Sassoon and Robert Graves declined).<br>
<br>Sibyl Colefax was not one of those brittle society women who are no more than a smart address, or present a surface as hard and varnished as a front door. Her memory of books, pictures, and people was keen. She was kind, loyal, practical, and unmalicious. Though she could be devious or insincere, her charms and stratagems were enticing. She never competed with the wit of her guests or domineered. In drawing out the merits of her friends&#151;the clever young as well as veteran celebrities&#151;she gave apt praise rather than flattery. She had a hunter's instinct for capturing lions and a brave's ruthlessness in collecting scalps. The term &#145;colefaxismus&#146; was coined to describe those claiming special acquaintanceship with celebrities or inside knowledge of great events: she was notorious for exaggerating her intimacy with the famous dead like Henry James. Yet she loathed publicity. Her energy was formidable. While London still slept, she would write and address some sixty postcards and the telephone would start shrilling before the postman dared call. Her illegible letters were littered with relentlessly dropped names, and could be irresistible. &#145;Do dine Tuesday&#146;, she scrawled to J. C. Squire. &#145;Just ourselves and Pirandello&#146;  (Pryce-Jones, 66). Virginia Woolf described her in 1923 as &#145;painted and emphatic &hellip; broadcheeked, a little coarse, kindly, glass-eyed, affectionate to me almost, capable, apparently disinterested&#146;  (Woolf, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 2.275); later she likened her &#145;to a bunch of red cherries on a hard black straw hat&#146;  (Woolf, <span class="italic">Moments of Being</span>, 189). Lady Plunder in Edith Wharton's <span class="italic">The Gods Arrive</span> (1932) is modelled on her.<br>
<br>Sibyl Colefax was a well-informed and energetic traveller with cosmopolitan cultural interests: Val&eacute;ry made his London d&eacute;but under her auspices. Her son Peter went to work on Wall Street in 1926, and she lost her investments there (estimated at &pound;50,000) in 1929. To recuperate her finances, she began on a fee-paying basis to advise her friends on the interior arrangements of their houses. After several commissions, she inaugurated Sibyl Colefax Ltd in 1933. The reception rooms at Argyll House were compact, immaculate, and varnished: pale almond greens, greys, and opaque yellows provided discreet colouring. Her work for paying clients was, however, more theatrical and derivative. It was influenced by Edward Knoblock, an American dramatist who had cultivated an English taste for Regency Revival decorations and furnishings during the 1920s. Cecil Beaton pictured a typical room arranged by Lady Colefax: &#145;somewhat sparsely furnished, with a couple of delicate black and gold chairs, a settee, striped curtains, and a colour scheme of yellow and grey&#146;  (Beaton, 210). She worked initially in collaboration with the Bruton Street antique dealers Stair and Andrew, but in 1938 recruited a gifted young decorator, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40190/', "John Fowler")</script>, and the Mayfair interior decorating firm of Colefax and Fowler was formed. The combination of her contacts and his flair brought prosperity until the war. Sibyl Colefax was industrious, but an inefficient manager and inconsiderate employer. The enforcement, during the post-war period, of official austerity measures limited the firm's opportunities for profitable work, as did its senior partner's failing health. The Anglo-American millionaire Ronald Tree was consequently able to buy Colefax and Fowler as a gift for his wife, afterwards known as Nancy Lancaster, at the time of their divorce in 1947. The subsequent Colefax and Fowler style&#151;richly coloured chintzes, fringed and tasselled curtains, braided upholstery, bright colours, floral patterns&#151;was the antithesis of the earlier Colefax interiors.<br>
<br>After Arthur Colefax's sudden death of pneumonia in February 1936, Sibyl Colefax left Argyll House. Her last dinner party there, on 11 June 1936, was perhaps her finest. King Edward VIII attended with Wallis Simpson. Artur Rubinstein played three Chopin piano pieces; No&euml;l Coward sang. Guests included Lord Brownlow, Winston Churchill, Duff Cooper, Robert Vansittart, and Kenneth Clark with their wives, as well as Lord Berners and Robert Bruce Lockhart. She resumed entertaining at a small house in Westminster in May 1937. During the Second World War, she ran a canteen in Belgrave Square, and, despite dangerous operations and broken limbs, held regular dinners called &#145;ordinaries&#146; at the Dorchester Hotel, at which her guests paid their own expenses. Latterly some of her attractions waned but her dinner parties continued to draw guests. One of her last, on 21 February 1950, brought together Vivien Leigh, Lord Esher, Terence Rattigan, Beverley Nichols, Robert Lutyens, Osbert Lancaster, Edward Sackville-West, Viscountess Waverley, and Lady Jebb (there were no politicians in election week). Sibyl Colefax died of cancer of the lungs and left breast on 22 September 1950 at 19 Lord North Street, London. Her ashes are presumed to have been buried, as she had intended, in a wood near Old Buckhurst, Sussex. On the hall table her visitors' book lay open at the last dinner she had given.<br>
