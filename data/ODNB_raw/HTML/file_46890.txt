<span class="headword">Dreyfus,  Henry <span class="st"> [Henri]</span></span>  (1882&#150;1944), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, was born in January 1882 into a Jewish family in Switzerland; he was the son of Abraham Dreyfus. Trained as a chemist, he held a doctorate of the University of Basel. In 1912, in conjunction with his elder brother, Camille, and a silk dyer, Alexander Clavel, he set up in Basel a company for the manufacture of cellulose acetate and other chemicals. Cellulose acetate had been the subject of patents for various uses: as a base for cinematograph film; for paints and varnishes including &#145;dope&#146; used for treating the outer skin of early aircraft; and for spinning into artificial silk. Dreyfus was among those who took out such patents, though his were hotly contested and were rejected in Germany.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the First World War the sole sources of dope available to the allied powers were a firm in France and the Dreyfus plant in Switzerland, and in 1915 the British War Office accepted a tender from the latter for the supply of the chemical. In 1916 the Dreyfus brothers and Clavel went to Britain and, in association with some other businessmen, set up the British Cellulose and Chemical Manufacturing Co. Ltd. Work began on the erection, near Derby, of a factory to make cellulose acetate dope and related chemical products. With the aid of tax concessions and loans from the government, production finally started in 1917. So, too, did trouble for the company in the form of complaints about delays, about the government-sponsored monopoly which it had secured, and about some dubious share pushing and speculation.<br>
<br>Dreyfus's name first came into the public eye in Britain during 1918&#150;19, when a House of Commons select committee, followed by a special government tribunal, reported on the company in connection with what had come to be called the &#145;dope scandal&#146;. The name also elicited some antisemitic comments, notably, in August 1918, from G. K. Chesterton. But the adverse publicity died down and in 1920 the enterprise was launched as a public company with the stated intention of making artificial silk by the cellulose acetate process. In the following year it began to market the yarn under the name of Celanese and in 1923 the company changed its name to British Celanese Ltd. By 1927 Henry Dreyfus had become chairman and managing director. In the course of the 1920s and 1930s he built up the business into a remarkable example of a vertically integrated chemical and textile concern, undertaking the basic chemical processes, the spinning of yarn, weaving, knitting, and dyeing, and the manufacture of garments. A vigorous selling and advertising campaign ensured that Celanese became a household name in Britain in the 1930s, especially for women's underwear.<br>
<br>There seems little doubt that it was Dreyfus himself, as both businessman and technical expert, who gave to British Celanese the dynamic qualities which it exhibited at that time. But the price of that contribution was high. He was autocratic and difficult to work with, and his brash optimism, disregard of costs, and extravagant pursuit of goals caused financial chaos and a disastrous profit record. The need to repay government loans, together with the high development costs in the early 1920s, saddled it with a large proportion of preference capital and a heavy burden of debt. Despite a substantial rise in sales and in trading profits, preference dividends remained in arrears and no dividends were paid on the ordinary shares until 1944.<br>
<br>The personal qualities which Dreyfus brought to bear upon business life also included a pugnacious determination to defend his patents at all costs. But just as the Germans had rejected his original patents, so the validity of later patents which he took out was successfully questioned elsewhere. Undeterred, in 1931 he issued writs against Courtaulds, the dominant firm in rayon manufacture, alleging infringement of patents. Judgment was given against him in 1933; it was upheld by the Court of Appeal and then by the House of Lords in 1935. Still undeterred, Dreyfus persisted in further litigation, now alleging false evidence. Again he lost and prepared to go to appeal. By this time, 1937, an incensed body of shareholders, calling themselves the British Celanese Shareholders Union, had come into being. Dreyfus finally withdrew his appeal. Attempts to secure an understanding with Courtaulds came to nothing; merger negotiations were abandoned in 1940. British Celanese was finally taken over by Courtaulds in 1957.<br>
<br>On 3 March 1938 Dreyfus married Elizabeth Deborah Jenkinson (1908&#150;1984), only daughter of Captain John Banks Jenkinson of the rifle brigade, and twenty-six years his junior. He died of heart failure on 30 December 1944, at the Hyde Park Hotel, Knightsbridge, London. His estate passed to his brother, Camille.<br>
