<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wollheim,  Richard Arthur</span>  (1923&#150;2003), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was born in London on 5 May 1923, the second son of Eric Wollheim (1879&#150;1948), a theatrical impresario (and London agent for Diaghilev's ballets), and his wife, Constance, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Baker (1891&#150;1983). Although his father was of German Jewish descent, Wollheim was brought up as a Christian, later becoming, like his father, an atheist. His mother, of west-country origins, became a Gaiety showgirl and actress, but retired at the time of her marriage. He was educated at Westminster School, as a king's scholar, and at Balliol College, Oxford. His studies were interrupted by the Second World War; he joined the Inniskilling Fusiliers in 1942, participated in the Normandy landings, and was captured by the Germans in August 1944, but managed to escape within a few days. After the war he returned to Balliol and achieved first-class degrees in history (1946) and philosophy, politics, and economics (1948). He joined the philosophy department at University College, London, in 1949 under the auspices of A. J. Ayer, initially as an assistant lecturer. He was promoted lecturer in 1951, reader in 1960, and Grote professor of the philosophy of mind and logic and head of department in 1963. After retiring from University College in 1982 he moved to the United States, first as professor at Columbia University, from 1982 to 1985, and then as professor at the University of California, Berkeley, until 2002. He was also visiting professor in philosophy and the humanities at the University of California, Davis (1989&#150;96). On 15 August 1950 he married Anne Barbara Denise Toynbee (1920&#150;2004), the daughter of Colonel George Harcourt Powell, army officer, and the former wife of (Theodore) Philip Toynbee, writer. They had twin sons, Bruno and Rupert. The marriage was dissolved in 1967, and two years later he married Mary Day Lanier, a potter, and daughter of Robert S. Lanier, of New York. They had one daughter, Emilia.<br>
<br>Wollheim's first book was <span class="italic">F. H. Bradley</span> (1959); his choice of this neglected idealist philosopher may have seemed odd at the time, given the pre-eminence of logical positivism and ordinary language philosophy, but Bradley's moral philosophy, with its emphasis on moral psychology, must have struck a sympathetic chord with Wollheim's emerging views on the psychological development of the individual. Indeed the closing lines of <span class="italic">F. H. Bradley</span> intimate the tenor of future concerns:<blockquote>there are some [critics of Bradley] in whose eyes any attempt to relate an intellectual work to the elementary and emotional movements of the psyche is a way of degrading the intellect. On those who are so confident where the emotions end and the intellect begins, it is the pleasure and privilege of the emotions to take their revenge. (<span class="italic">F. H. Bradley</span>, 285)</blockquote>Wollheim was best-known for his writings on psychoanalysis and art, and his peculiar blend of the two disciplines owed something, as did his literary style, to the influence and friendship of Adrian Stokes. (Also, perhaps, to the fact that during the 1960s he entered into an eight-year Kleinian analysis.) Wollheim greatly admired Stokes's writings on art, a selection of which he edited, as <span class="italic">The Image in Form</span> (1972). With the publication of <span class="italic">Freud</span> in 1971 Wollheim was established as a formidable interpreter of psychoanalytic theory and, unusually for a non-practitioner, he received honours from the British Psychoanalytic Society (1982), the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Institute (1994), and the International Psychoanalytical Association (1991). Despite the deep influence of psychoanalytic theory on all his thinking, Wollheim did not advocate it, as Freud had, as a method for interpreting works of art. Stokes's writings suggested an alternative approach: less focus on the individual work of art and the kind of information discoverable by psychoanalytic processes, and more on a search for the roots of artistic form, for formal structures of art that might correlate or match more universal psychological structures of the person. Wollheim believed that the understanding of ourselves and the understanding of art depend on the same resources, including both individual and cultural history and an essential role for both the body and the material presence of art.<br>
<br>Wollheim's <span class="italic">Art and its Objects</span>, published in 1968, was instrumental in the renewal of analytical aesthetics. This brilliant book showed how a wide range of philosophical expertise and rigour could be brought to bear decisively on the problems and nature of art without sacrificing any sophistication and sensitivity to the arts. He was uncompromising in his attack on reductive tendencies, and admitted to having an impatience &#145;after a little while with any form of culture that turns its back on history, or complexity, or melancholy&#146;  (preface to <span class="italic">On Art and the Mind</span>, 1973). Pictorial representation and expression were central to his investigations, and in both cases he argued against attempts to anchor meaning exclusively in the object, or in the spectator's perception of it, or in the thoughts or biography of the artist. By the same token he rejected formalist criticism for impoverishing our understanding of artistic endeavour and the appreciation of art, and was critical of positivist trends in art history. He favoured an optimistic yet rigorous view of the possibilities of criticism, which he called retrieval, and likened to archaeology. The aim of criticism, he argued, should be to reconstruct the creative process in the light of our knowledge of history, tradition, and human nature, such understanding not being beyond the reach of imagination when necessary, so that we are able to experience the work of art in a way we would not otherwise achieve.<br>
<br>The publication in 1960 of E. H. Gombrich's <span class="italic">Art and Illusion</span> had reinvigorated philosophical and psychological interest in pictorial art. Wollheim, however, argued persuasively against the illusion theory (whereby a picture represents an object, event, or scene only if the spectator comes to believe, falsely, that he or she is seeing that thing). For all its ancient pedigree the illusion theory, even in Gombrich's sophisticated version, fails to account for our experience of pictorial art because it deprives the medium of a constitutive place in that experience, and distorts the facts of appreciation. Wollheim maintained that the distinctive feature of our experience of pictures is that it has a dual aspect: we are simultaneously aware, though not necessarily to the same degree, of the marked surface and of something (literally absent) in it. As he conceived it, pictorial seeing could range from seeing in the marked surface (minimally) one thing behind or in front of another, to seeing an object or event or scene. Our universal capacity for projection is invoked, but not without constraints: the spectator should respect the artist's intentions (liberally understood as including beliefs, desires, emotions, wishes, and so on) set within practice and tradition, while allowing also for the vicissitudes of the creative process. One advantage of this view of pictorial representation is that most abstract art is accommodated, as well as figurative painting.<br>
<br>For all its intuitive and phenomenological appeal Wollheim's &#145;twofold&#146; characterization of &#145;seeing-in&#146; remained controversial, as did his account of artistic expression, not least because of the indefiniteness of the notion of projection. But he did not give up his approach. This was characteristic of the man: he wanted to enlighten experience as much as to find incontrovertible arguments. Over the years he continued to implement his strategy, refining it and extracting maximum gains. A second edition of <span class="italic">Art and its Objects</span>, with six supplementary essays, was published in 1980, and many essays were collected in <span class="italic">On Art and the Mind</span> (1973) and <span class="italic">The Mind and its Depths</span> (1993). His remarkably integrated and fertile philosophy of art and criticism culminated in <span class="italic">Painting as an Art</span> (1987), a much elaborated version of the Mellon lectures he gave at the National Gallery, Washington, in 1984. This dense and difficult book, which rewards patient study, was Wollheim's second substantial contribution to the philosophy of art, bringing together his ideas on representation, expression, imagination, the role of the artist/spectator, and individual style, and, in the light of a rich psychology, presenting a number of intriguing studies of individual artists and works of art. His catholic tastes and delicate discriminations, his intellectual courage, versatility, and extensive knowledge of art history&#151;he delighted in the minutiae of dating and attribution&#151;were here amply demonstrated, even if at times his idiosyncratic prose, which he jealously guarded from editorial interventions, can seem arduous.<br>
<br>Wollheim gave many distinguished lecture series, generating, always with much revision and expansion, further books. His William James lectures in philosophy at Harvard in 1982 were published as <span class="italic">The Thread of Life</span> (1984). His Ernst Cassirer lectures at Yale in 1991 became his last philosophical book, <span class="italic">On the Emotions</span> (1999). He was a prolific writer, and in some ways he belonged to an earlier tradition of letters: unusually for a twentieth-century English-speaking philosopher, even one as cosmopolitan as he, he wrote essays and reviews for many non-philosophical periodicals including, during the 1950s and 1960s, the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, <span class="italic">The Nation</span>, <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, and <span class="italic">The Listener</span>, and, in the last two decades of his life, for the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>, the <span class="italic">London Review of Books</span>, the <span class="italic">New York Review of Books</span>, and <span class="italic">Modern Painters</span>. He especially loved to review exhibitions of artists about whom he was passionate&#151;Poussin, Titian and the Venetians, Monet, Picasso, for example&#151;devoting hours to the scrutiny of individual works, in the belief that irrelevant babble would gradually fall away from a spectator's thoughts, yielding a truer response and perception of them. In 1969 he published a novel, <span class="italic">A Family Romance</span>, and shortly before he died he completed a memoir of his childhood, <span class="italic">Germs</span>, published to great acclaim in 2004, in which he probed the innermost workings of a child's experience. There was nothing of the dilettante in him, his thinking on all subjects being driven by a systematic conception of human nature and the mind. He resisted the seductions of any kind of sectarianism, be it nationalist, religious, or racist, and all his life remained loyal to a socialism that was deeply felt. His intellectual passions frequently went against the trend of mainstream philosophy and yet he enviably succeeded in integrating them into lifelong philosophical projects.<br>
<br>Wollheim was indefatigable, and his powers of concentration marvellous: he did not seek out quiet, but preferred to work in a hubbub, especially in airport lounges and busy caf&eacute;s around the world. This may have been the after-effect of a lonely childhood, or perhaps the habitual exercise of a determined will&#151;he never would countenance feelings of tiredness, and loved to stay up late. He was sociable, humorous, and conversational, but a good listener, tolerant, curious, and very perceptive about people. He inspired affection and even fascination among his students and colleagues, who thrived in a liberal environment where differences were positively encouraged and hierarchies ignored. He was also very funny, not only as a raconteur but in his demeanour. His classes and lectures were often preceded by elaborate little comedies&#151;concerning the arrangement of furniture, lights, chalk, spectacles, doors, and windows, even the presence of newsprint about which he was phobic&#151;performances in which he seemed to relish his incompetence and eccentricities, enjoying the amusement he provoked, as if re-enacting childhood memories of the music hall. He died of cancer, after a short illness, at his home, 4 Gemini House, 180&#150;82 Bermondsey Street, Southwark, London, on 4 November 2003. He was survived by his wife, Mary Day, and his three children.<br>
