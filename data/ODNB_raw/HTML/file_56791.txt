<span class="headword">Sayers,  John Edward <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>  (1911&#150;1969), <span class="occ">newspaper editor and social commentator</span>, was born on 13 July 1911 in King Street, Birkenhead, the eldest of three children of John Sayers (1880&#150;1939), journalist, of 16 Cyprus Avenue, Belfast, and his wife, Elizabeth Lemon (1886&#150;1957).<br>
<br>Educated at Miss Corry's and Miss Brown's school, Cyprus Road, and then Methodist College, Belfast (1920&#150;30), Sayers became an apprentice reporter at the <span class="italic">Belfast Telegraph</span> in 1930, there joining his father and his uncle. All three would in time become editor, so ensuring a continuous familial succession from 1937 until 1969. Jack, as he was known, had risen to parliamentary reporter when the Second World War broke out and barely a month later he was serving on HMS <i>Courageous</i> when she was torpedoed in mid-Atlantic with the loss of 700 on 17 September 1939. As with many of his generation, the experience of war cast in stone the ideals that were to dominate his later career: patriotism and the values of empire, duty in the service of the community, and the moral responsibility of those in authority to pursue the cause of justice. At the same time his secondment (on 24 October 1939) to Churchill's private map room exposed him to the exotic world of the &#145;high ups&#146;. Here he observed his mercurial leader and met the great and good, from Churchillian cronies such as Lord Beaverbrook and Brendan Bracken to world leaders such as Roosevelt, Eisenhower (whom he once tried to lock out of the map room on grounds of security), de Gaulle, and even Chiang Kai-shek.<br>
<br>With the war over Sayers married, on 4 October 1945, a war widow, Daphne Mary Godby (1916&#150;1998), daughter of Roger Hardy Parnell, chartered accountant, and his wife Amy Sarah, at Holy Trinity, Brompton, rejoining the <span class="italic">Belfast Telegraph</span> a month later as political correspondent (with John Cole as his deputy). At the same time (January 1946) he began a radio career for the BBC on such programmes as <span class="italic">Ulster's Half Hour</span>, <span class="italic">Your Questions</span>, and the influential, often controversial <span class="italic">Ulster Commentary</span>. This, together with his freelance articles for the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, the <span class="italic">Observer</span>, and the <span class="italic">Round Table</span> (1948&#150;69), ensured that by the time he became editor-in-chief in 1961 Sayers had emerged as the foremost political commentator of his day.<br>
<br>Slightly swarthy and owlish as he peered through his glasses, he looked distinctly archaic for the 1960s in his neat, dark suits with a tight knot to his tie in a stiff white collar. Yet Jack Sayers was to prove one of the most remarkable editors Ulster had ever produced. Under him the <span class="italic">Belfast Telegraph</span> commanded a daily readership that approached two out of three households in the province, straddling the sectarian divide and offering for many, both protestant and Catholic, a common ground for debate amid the political turmoil of the 1960s. Convinced of the need for change in Ulster he determined through his paper to transform Ulster unionism into an inclusive, supra-class political movement. These ideas, emanating as they did from a traditional Unionist organ, won considerable support in the late 1950s and 1960s. And, with traditional unionism floundering in the wake of this articulate assault, Sayers quickly found himself the confidant of prime ministers, especially Terence O'Neill. Indeed, with O'Neill's conversion to liberalism always a little ambiguous, it was Jack Sayers who proved the most coherent exponent of &#145;O'Neillism&#146;. With his &#145;Viewpoint&#146; leaders in the <span class="italic">Telegraph</span> and most famously the &#145;I back O'Neill&#146; coupons in December 1968, he led the fight against the sectarian and unbending in the Unionist movement in what he saw as a &#145;classic struggle between forces of progress and reaction&#146;  (Gailey, 110).<br>
<br>None of this made Sayers any the less Unionist. Indeed he held that it was the failure after 1945 to incorporate the identities and aspirations of the minority that imperilled the union and led to the humiliation of direct rule. Such attitudes bred many enemies and the onset of the troubles and O'Neill's fall in 1969 saw Sayers overwhelmed by events and by his failure to recognize that Paisleyism also represented a genuine constituency and not just an antediluvian creed. Journalistically too, as one of the last of the great writing editors, he was finding himself outflanked in the end by the media of television and soundbites. With his health failing, he retired on 31 March 1969, and died in Belfast on 30 August at the Royal Victoria Hospital, after suffering a major heart attack; he was survived by his wife and two daughters, Diana and Sarah. As befitted an Ulster romantic, he was buried, four days later, at Carnlough in co. Antrim, where his planter ancestors had first settled in the seventeenth century.<br>
<br>Under his editorship he gathered together an unusually talented group of young journalists, including John Cole, W. D. Flackes, Martin Wallace, Eric Waugh, and Dennis Kennedy&#151;many of whom later made their names on television. And through them the <span class="italic">Belfast Telegraph</span> sustained and moulded a popular moderate consensus which, however fragile, remains a unique achievement in twentieth-century Ulster. With his constant emphasis on British standards and with the wide coverage given to all parties he contributed to the civil rights strategy of seeking justice within the system, which was so to unnerve unionism. It was therefore ironic, given his firm belief in the union, that the lasting consequence of his crusade was the permanent division of unionism in Ulster and the subsequent abolition of Stormont with all that that implied for unionism as a philosophy of government. On the other hand, it said much for his integrity that he did not shrink from embracing such conclusions in public. For he recognized that questions over the purpose of unionism and its relationship to the Catholic minority lay at the very heart of the Unionist dilemma.<br>
