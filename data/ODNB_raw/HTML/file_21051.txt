<span class="headword">Oxenden,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1651, <em>d.</em> 1703), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was baptized at Wingham, Kent, on 31 October 1651, the fourth (but third surviving) son of Sir Henry Oxenden, first baronet (1614&#150;1686), of Dene, Wingham, and his second wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1659), daughter of Sir William Meredith, first baronet, of Leeds Castle, Kent. His uncle was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21050/', "Sir George Oxenden")</script>, governor of Bombay, and the poet Henry Oxenden was a distant cousin. Oxenden was entered at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, as a scholar on 8 July 1667, and he graduated LLB in 1673, MA <i>per literas regias</i> in 1675, and LLD in 1679. On 14 July 1674 he was incorporated at Oxford. He was admitted to the court of arches on 10 July 1679, and on 12 July 1679 registered at Doctors' Commons.<br>
<br>A fellow of Trinity Hall from 1671, Oxenden regularly contributed to the compilations of Latin verse composed by members of the university to commemorate public events; the first of his seven offerings was on the occasion of Princess Anne's marriage in 1683, and the last following the death of William III and accession of Queen Anne in 1702. They included some congratulatory verses on the birth of the prince of Wales in 1688, which were to prove somewhat embarrassing in future years. Oxenden was elected regius professor of civil law in 1684, an appointment which prompted John Dolben, the archbishop of York, to say that he was &#145;as well read in Galen and Hippocrates as he is in Corpus J[uris] C[ivilis]&#146;  (<span class="italic">Downshire MSS</span>, 1.25). He became master of Trinity Hall on 11 November 1688 and remained so until his death. By 23 October 1689 he was president of Doctors' Commons. In that year he was also made vicar-general to the archbishop of Canterbury, dean of arches, and a judge of Admiralty; he retained all of these offices until his death. He served as vice-chancellor of Cambridge University in 1692&#150;3.<br>
<br>In 1693 Oxenden married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1704), daughter of Sir Basil Dixwell, first baronet, of Broome House, Kent, a maid of honour to Queen Mary, who ordered &pound;2000 to be given as a marriage portion in May 1693. Oxenden had first attempted to enter parliament for the university at a by-election in 1692, but he had withdrawn his candidature. He was successful at the 1695 general election. Evidence from division lists indicates that he was a court whig in politics, and he spoke and voted on the prosecution side in the debates on the attainder bill against the Jacobite plotter Sir John Fenwick. He did not stand in 1698 and was subsequently rebuffed by Sandwich and the university in later years.<br>
<br>Oxenden's most controversial case as a judge concerned the deprivation for simony of the high-flying bishop of St David's, Thomas Watson. His conduct on that occasion was described as more akin to that of an advocate than that of a judge. With less controversy he presided over the trial for piracy in May 1701 of Captain Kidd.<br>
<br>Oxenden died on 21 February 1703 at his house in Doctors' Commons, and was buried in Wingham church. His will referred to his estate &#145;great part out upon funds in the Exchequer and Bank of England&#146;. His wife died at Bath on 18 September 1704. His son Henry succeeded his uncle Sir Henry as fourth baronet in February 1709, and he in turn was succeeded in April 1720 as fifth baronet by Oxenden's second son, <a name="cosubject_21052"></a><span class="headword">Sir George Oxenden</span>  (1694&#150;1775)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born on 26 October 1694 and educated at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he was a fellow from 1716 to 1720. Sir George was &#145;an extremely handsome&#146; but profligate man, who served as MP for Sandwich (1720&#150;54) and, successively, as a lord of the Admiralty (1725&#150;7) and a Treasury lord (1727&#150;37). In May 1720 he married Elizabeth, the eldest daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8234/', "Edmund Dunch")</script>, seduced his sister-in-law, Bell Dunch, and was thought to be the father of the third earl of Orford. He died on 20 January 1775.<br>
