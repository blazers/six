<span class="headword">Tipper,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1680, <em>d.</em> 1713), <span class="occ">mathematician and almanac maker</span>, was born at Coventry. In 1699 he was elected master of Bablake Hospital school there at a salary of &pound;20, which he supplemented by teaching mathematics, surveying, dialling, accounting, and music to private pupils. Some boarded with him; others living within 10 miles of Coventry he visited on a weekly basis. By 1705 he was able to hire an assistant master. In 1704 Tipper launched the <span class="italic">Ladies' Diary</span>, a hybrid almanac and pioneering women's magazine. Early editions covered elementary astronomy, with data on the universe and notes on Halley's work on comets. There were also features on cooking and diet, medical recipes (from the writings of Robert Boyle), and advice on the care of small children. In lighter vein he wrote on the virtues of the female sex, mused on love (drawing on Rochester, Dryden, and Otway), and ran a serialized burlesque romance. His friend Humfrey Wanley the antiquary, a Coventry man by origin, acted as his London intermediary, giving advice on material, liaising with Halley, and procuring specialist books.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Ladies' Diary</span>, dedicated to Queen Anne and carrying her portrait each year, proved a success from the start. In 1706 Tipper introduced verse &#145;enigmas&#146; sent in by readers, which quickly became its most popular feature. He printed the names of those who set or solved them (some of them men) and offered small prizes. Though most of the early riddles were verbal, others were mathematical and these gradually became more challenging. An early prize was won by Henry Beighton, a future fellow of the Royal Society. There were soon so many correspondents that in 1711 Tipper launched a monthly journal of the same kind, <span class="italic">Delights for the Ingenious</span>, price 3<i>d</i>., though this soon fell victim to the new stamp tax.<br>
<br>Tipper's <span class="italic">Diary</span> printed meteorological data, but no prophecies; he had no interest in astrology. In 1710 he founded another annual title, <span class="italic">Great Britain's Diary</span>, which supplied useful notes for tradesmen. In addition he published <span class="italic">The Art of Reading</span> (1705), a manual (now lost) designed for parents and teachers, and planned an ambitious history of Coventry to be published by subscription, for which he issued a detailed prospectus in 1711. He did not live to complete it, but some of his work was incorporated in the 1730 edition of Sir William Dugdale's <span class="italic">Antiquities of Warwickshire</span>. Tipper died in 1713. After his death the <span class="italic">Ladies' Diary</span> was continued by a succession of able mathematicians and played a significant part in promoting the subject for over a century until it merged with the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Diary</span> in 1840.<br>
