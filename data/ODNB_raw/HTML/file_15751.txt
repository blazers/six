<span class="headword">Knipp,  Elizabeth <span class="st"> [Mary]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 1680<span class="mult">x</span>82), <span class="occ">actress and singer</span>, performed with the King's Company in London shortly after the Restoration. Nothing is known of her before then. Her first name may have been either Elizabeth (as she appears on a lord chancellor's warrant of 1672) or Mary (as she is named in a poem by Sir Charles Sedley). Her husband was Christopher Knipp, and they are probably the Christopher Knipp and Elizabeth Carpenter who were married at Knightsbridge Chapel in 1659. Their possible children appear in the parish registers of St Paul's, Covent Garden, St Clement Danes, and St Giles-in-the-Fields: Ursula (<i>bap</i>. 26 Dec 1663), &#145;Samuell Son of Christopher Nepp&#146; (<i>bur</i>. 16 July 1666), Catherine (<i>bur</i>. 20 July 1667), and Mary (<i>bap</i>. 7 June 1672). Mrs Knipp certainly lost an infant son at the time that Samuel was buried; she had a young daughter, &#145;mighty pretty and witty&#146;, alive in February 1667  (Pepys, 8.57).<br>
<br>Mrs Knipp is known primarily through the diary of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21906/', "Samuel Pepys")</script>. His first reference to her is on 6 December 1665, when he sees &#145;Knipp, who is pretty enough, but the most excellent, mad-hum[ou]red thing; and sings the noblest that ever I heard in my life&#146;  (Pepys, 6.321). He often praises her singing: he writes on 2 January 1667 that he saw Fletcher and Massinger's <span class="italic">The Custom of the Country</span>, &#145;wherein Knipp does the Widow well; but of all the plays that ever I did see, the worst, having neither plot, language, nor anything in the earth that is acceptable. Only, Knipp sings a little song admirably&#146;  (ibid., 8.3). She often danced, sang, or both between acts of plays.<br>
<br>Mrs Knipp's earliest role may have been Lusetta in Thomas Killigrew's <span class="italic">Thomaso</span>, in November 1664. In tragedy, Mrs Knipp played Alibech in Dryden's <span class="italic">The Indian Emperor</span> (1665) and Felicia in his <span class="italic">Tyrannic Love</span> (1669), and Aglave in Nathaniel Lee's <span class="italic">Sophonisba</span> (1675); in comedy, she played Otrante in Richard Rhodes's <span class="italic">Flora's Vagaries</span> (1667), and characters in three of Wycherley's comedies: Lady Fidget in <span class="italic">The Country Wife</span> (1675), Lady Flippant in <span class="italic">Love in a Wood</span> (1671), and Eliza in <span class="italic">The Plain Dealer</span> (1676). She consistently appears in cast lists as secondary, supporting characters.<br>
<br>Her singing and acting were avenues to a greater intimacy between Pepys and Knipp. On 2 January 1666, he writes of &#145;my dear Mrs. Knipp, with whom I sang; and in perfect pleasure I was to hear her sing, and especially her little Scotch song of <span class="italic">Barbary Allen</span>&#146;  (Pepys, 7.1). Several days later she signs her letter to him as Bab Allen; he responds as Dapper Dicky. The second of January was also their first recorded physical encounter: &#145;so I got into the coach where Mrs. Knipp was, and got her upon my knee (the coach being full) and played with her breasts and sung&#146;  (ibid., 7.2). Their first sexual intercourse may have been in April 1668. That he much admired her beauty is evident from an entry dated 17 August 1667: &#145;I was pleased to see &hellip; her come out in her night-gowne, with no locks on, but her bare face and hair only tied up in a knot behind; which is the comeliest dress that ever I saw her in to her advantage&#146;  (Pepys, 8.388&#150;9). He expresses disgust at the mean circumstances in which she lived and wrote that &#145;she lives a sad life with that ill-natured fellow her husband&#146;, who, he states, &#145;is a kind of Jocky&#146;, that is, a horse-trader  (ibid., 7.5; 9.391).<br>
<br>In October 1668, after jealousy and irritation, Mrs Pepys finally required Pepys to forgo seeing Mrs Knipp. Pepys promised, but then struggled with his vow and limited his visits to the King's Company theatre to avoid encountering the actress. After this, little is recorded about Mrs Knipp except for her stage performances. She was arrested for unidentified &#145;misdemeanors&#146; in February 1668 and again in April 1668. Her last recorded performance was as Mrs Dorothy in D'Urfey's <span class="italic">Trick for Trick</span> in March 1678. She probably joined the group of players who headed to Edinburgh in 1680. Pepys had recorded seeing Knipp with the actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11878/', "Joseph Haines (d. 1701)")</script> in May 1668, and a 1682 manuscript poem in the British Library by Haines states that she had died giving birth to their daughter there: &#145;To Madam Gwin, a Rhymeing Supplication&#146; states that Knipp is &#145;In Child birth from mee to Lizeum departed&#146;  (Cameron, &#145;Jo Haynes, <i>Infamis</i>&#146;, 63). No other evidence exists to indicate that she returned to London or that her acting career continued after 1682.<br>
