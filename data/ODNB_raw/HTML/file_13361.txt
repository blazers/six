<span class="headword">Hippisley, Sir  John Coxe</span>, first baronet  (1745/6&#150;1825), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in Bristol and baptized (a little belatedly) John Cox Hipsley at Christchurch, Bristol, on 17 February 1747. He was the elder and only surviving son of William Hipsley (<i>bap</i>. 1718, <i>d</i>. 1800), haberdasher, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1776), daughter of Robert Webb of Cromhall, Gloucestershire. He was educated at Bristol grammar school and Hertford College, Oxford, whence he matriculated in 1764. He proceeded to the Inner Temple in 1766 and was called to the bar in 1771; he later held the offices of master of the bench (1803), reader (1812), and treasurer (1813&#150;14). He was awarded an honorary DCL from Oxford in 1776, and MA from Cambridge in 1811.<br>
<br>An ambitious barrister, Hippisley became the lover of the Countess Percy, with the hope of becoming Lord Bute's son-in-law. When she eventually left him he pursued her ineffectively to Germany, whence, in dire straits, he hitched a ride to Rome in 1779. There he acted as <i>cicerone</i> to visiting grandees, but also sent confidential information to the government. He married in Rome on 1 February 1780 his first wife, Margaret (1754/5&#150;1799), second daughter of Sir John Stewart, third baronet (<i>d</i>. 1796), of Allanbank, Berwickshire, and Margaret Agnes Smith (<i>d</i>. 1807). They had three daughters and one son. He returned home in 1781, but soon departed to Madras to take up a position in the East India Company that had been secured for him through the influence of Lord Bute, and of William Windham, whom he had met in Rome. He served as company writer (1782), factor (1783), and paymaster at Tanjore (1786&#150;7) and returned to England in 1789 with a fortune of over &pound;100,000, having bought up company bills at discount. He now aspired to parliament and, assisted by Windham, he became recorder (1789), then member (1790) for Sudbury. The election contest cost &pound;6000: ironically he had rejected Bristol to avoid expense. In the 1790s he bought a country estate at Warfield Grove in Berkshire.<br>
<br>In parliament Hippisley acted as an opposition spokesman on India but illness forced him to relinquish this role to others in February 1791. On his recovery in April he denounced belligerent expansion, and pressed for payment of arrears to the native army, which was secured in June. In 1792 his complaints about Cornwallis's wartime recruitment of native allies stung the viceroy into characterizing Hippisley's fortune as ill-gotten. His bronchitis prevented his voice being heard at Westminster from 5 April 1792, but he none the less distanced himself from his more radical whig colleagues by instigating a Sudbury address against sedition, and urging government to prosecute radical publications. He returned to Rome in the hope of restoring his health, stopping <i>en route</i> at Paris for Louis XVI's trial in December 1792. His enthusiasm for Pope Pius VI's projected Holy Alliance against France spurred him to bring about Cardinal Erskine's mission to London, and to pester friends at home for official recognition of his role in 1793. He purveyed supplies for the British fleet from the Romagna and, following Windham into supporting Pitt's administration, he proceeded to lobby the new government. In August 1794 he petitioned for a baronetcy. He returned home the following summer endowed with the Roman senate's insignia, and reappeared at Westminster on 3 December to support anti-radical measures. Despite his efforts to secure new Italian markets for the depressed Sudbury wool trade, his prolonged absence from his constituency counted against him, and his erstwhile patron, Sir James Marriott, stood himself as a candidate and so, facing a contest at the approaching election, Hippisley withdrew. He received his baronetcy, through the duke of Portland's influence, on 30 April 1796.<br>
<br>Hippisley next busied himself by successfully negotiating the princess royal's marriage to the duke of W&uuml;rttemberg's heir, which attracted the king's notice. In 1799 he espoused the cause of Henry, Cardinal York, last of the royal Stuarts, and procured him a pension from George III. In 1800 he was sheriff of Berkshire, and was later vice-president of the West of England Agricultural Society. He was a founder member of the Royal Institution, a fellow of the Royal Society and of the Society of Antiquaries, and vice-president of the Literary Fund. He also promoted literary institutions in Bristol and Bath. As a governor of the Levantine Company he warned government about Napoleon's designs on India. In September 1799 his wife had died and he married, on 16 February 1801, Elizabeth Anne (1762/3&#150;1843), widow of Henry Hippisley Coxe MP, of Ston Easton, and only daughter of Thomas Horner of Mells Park and Elizabeth Paget. They had no children. Through his marriage he acquired enough property to consider standing for Somerset. A vacancy at Sudbury, however, obviated this and he was elected unopposed at his old constituency in 1802.<br>
<br>Although Hippisley joined Windham in opposition in 1804 he was neither reliable nor loquacious, except in championing the Irish petition for Catholic relief in 1805. He had first championed the Irish Catholic cause in 1799&#150;1800, which earned him the gratitude of the Irish Roman Catholic hierarchy, and led him to petition for an Irish peerage. In 1806 he published his plan for Catholic relief in his <span class="italic">Observations on the Roman Catholics of Ireland</span>, which was followed by <span class="italic">Additional Observations</span> (1806), and, until 1818, by a stream of speeches and correspondence on the question. Windham, in office under Grenville in 1806, could not achieve Hippisley's wish for an Irish peerage although Hippisley's annual income was then &pound;8000. Hippisley failed in his attempt to win office as governor of the Cape, as privy councillor, as a member of the Board of Trade, or even any appointment in India under the new viceroy, Lord Minto, in 1807. His only real gesture of support was his vote against Grenville's dismissal on the Catholic question on 9 April 1807. He afterwards voted with the opposition spasmodically. His annual speeches in favour of Irish Catholic relief were overlong and overelaborate; fearing popular prejudice he insisted on securities to guard against interference from Rome and to ensure a royal veto on Irish episcopal appointments. The whigs' failure to regain office dashed his hopes of entering the privy council and, after his re-election in 1812, a party agent advised Lord Grey that he surrender his seat, since Catholic relief monopolized his attention. On 11 May 1813 he exasperated its supporters by trying to halt the <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Bill</span> and substitute a committee on securities; he abstained at the division on 24 May, when the bill was defeated. Thereafter he obstructed all measures for Catholic relief that were not on his exact terms, which greatly perturbed Catholic opinion. In 1816 and 1817 he voted against Grattan's motions for Catholic relief on the grounds that there should be scrutiny of securities that existed elsewhere in Europe, a matter on which he claimed expertise. He deserted the opposition more generally, for example he supported the government's proposed penalties against seditious meetings on 10 March 1817.<br>
<br>Weary of politics, and having failed to persuade the regent to send him as emissary to W&uuml;rttemberg, Hippisley returned to Rome in 1818, whence he sent his dimittis to Sudbury before the 1818 election. In his final years he turned to the question of prison discipline, and publicly advocated the handcrank instead of the treadmill in a pamphlet of 1823; he was also an active magistrate in Somerset. He died in Grosvenor Street, London, on 3 May 1825 in his eightieth year and was buried in the crypt of the Inner Temple Church on 12 May. Monuments were erected to him in both Ston Easton and Inner Temple churches. He was survived by his wife and was succeeded by his son, John. Hippisley's unflagging, though wholly unsuccessful, quest for office led Joseph Jekyll to describe him in 1811 as &#145;Sir John Coxe Hippisley MP FRS SAS XYZ etc.&#146;  (Stokes and Thorne, 206).<br>
