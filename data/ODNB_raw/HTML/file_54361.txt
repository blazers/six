<span class="headword">Morse,  Hosea Ballou</span>  (1855&#150;1934), <span class="occ">customs official and historian of China</span>, was born on 18 July 1855 in South Brookfield, Queens county, Nova Scotia, the first of the four children of Albert David Morse (1832&#150;1900) and his wife, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mercey Dexter Park (<i>c</i>.1830&#150;<i>c</i>.1900). A fifth-generation Nova Scotian, whose earlier ancestors had emigrated from England to Massachusetts Bay in 1635, Hosea lived in South Brookfield and then in Halifax, before moving with his parents to Medford, Massachusetts, near Boston, in 1865.<br>
<br>As a young boy Morse had an active imagination, but he reportedly &#145;preferred books to play&#146;. His father, a struggling but determined shoe merchant, decided to send him to the prestigious Boston Latin school, which he attended from 1866 to 1870; Hosea excelled in his studies, particularly foreign languages. In 1869 both he and his father became naturalized United States citizens. The next year Hosea entered Harvard College, graduating with highest honours in 1874. At that time he accepted an offer from an influential Harvard alumnus to join the Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs Service under its renowned inspector-general Robert Hart.<br>
<br>From a lowly clerk during the mid-1870s, when he began learning Chinese with the assistance of a Chinese tutor, who worked with him each day for an hour before breakfast, Morse gradually rose in the ranks to become a full commissioner in 1898 and statistical secretary in the early 1900s. During this period he served in nearly a dozen places, from the vibrant metropolitan centres of Peking (Beijing), Tientsin (Tianjin), and Shanghai to such lonely backwater ports as Kiungchow (Qiongshan), Pakhoi (Beihai), and Lungchow (Longzhou). He married Annie (Nan) Josephine Welsford (1853&#150;1940) on 8 February 1881.<br>
<br>Like many other customs personnel in late nineteenth-century China, Morse undertook a number of non-customs assignments with Hart's encouragement. For example, he distributed relief during the great famine of 1876&#150;8, taught English in the Peking Interpreters' College during 1878&#150;9, served as a Chinese-language interpreter in Peking, Tientsin, and London from 1879 to 1882, superintended the exchange of prisoners after the Sino-French War of 1884&#150;5, and advised the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company from 1885 to 1887.<br>
<br>During the Sino-Japanese War of 1894&#150;5 Morse became deeply involved in delicate diplomatic negotiations, and in 1899 he handled the sensitive and dangerous opening of the port of Yochow (Yeuzhou) in Hunan province. After an offer from President William Howard Taft to become the United States minister to China (which Morse refused on grounds of poor health) and official retirement in 1909, he continued to assist the Chinese government. In 1920, for instance, he travelled to Brussels as an adviser to the Chinese delegation to the Economics and Financial Conference of the League of Nations, for which he received the order of the Excellent Crop.<br>
<br>Morse enjoyed a distinguished career as a historian following his departure from China in 1907. In the early stages of the First World War (1915)&#151;and after nearly a decade of residence in England&#151;he applied to become a British citizen again, moved by Great Britain's heroic war effort. In 1924 he received an honorary doctor of laws degree from Harvard University. Among Morse's most famous and influential works on China were <span class="italic">The Trade and Administration of the Chinese Empire</span> (1908), <span class="italic">The International Relations of the Chinese Empire</span> (3 vols., 1910&#150;18), and <span class="italic">The Chronicles of the East India Company Trading to China, 1635&#150;1834</span> (5 vols., 1926&#150;9). He also wrote a fascinating historical novel based on the military exploits of Frederick Townsend Ward and Charles G. Gordon during the Taiping uprising (1850&#150;64), entitled <span class="italic">In the Days of the Taipings</span> (1927).<br>
<br>On 13 February 1934 Morse died of pneumonia at his home, Arden, Grange Road, Camberley, Surrey, where he had lived since 1914. His remains were cremated and buried at Brookwood on 16 February. His devoted wife, Nan, died six years later. Although childless, they cared for the two children of Hosea's brother, Albert Morse (<i>b</i>. 1864), after the death of Albert's wife in 1893.<br>
