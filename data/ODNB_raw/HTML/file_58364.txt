<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Goodman,  Arnold Abraham</span>, Baron Goodman  (1913&#150;1995), <span class="occ">solicitor and public servant</span>, was born on 21 August 1913 at 26 Bodney Road, Hackney, London, the younger son of Joseph Goodman (1879/1880&#150;1940), master draper, and his wife, Bertha (1887&#150;1959), daughter of Joseph Mauerberger, businessman. His name was given on his birth certificate as Aby Goodman, but in 1931 his father re-registered him as Abraham; he adopted Arnold as a first name during the Second World War. Both parents were of Jewish descent; his mother came from a wealthy family with strong connections in South Africa, and her ambition and determination ensured that by the 1930s the family had moved out of the East End and into Hampstead. Food was the emotional currency of the young Goodman's household. He was born large, and his mother's relentless feeding at home made him very big for his age by the time he went to the Grocers' School in Hackney. This fat child learned to deflect bullies by being amiable and funny. As he grew up, there was always the demanding memory of his mother to push him on and always a passionate relationship with food. His sickly brother Theo, artistic and sensitive, was also an important influence. Goodman developed a sense of disappointment and frustration that he lacked real creative ability of his own. The values by which he lived were determined by this complex combination of feelings&#151;an obligation to please and gain approval, an immense sense of his own worth, and a genuine respect for creativity and the arts.<br>
<br>From the Grocer's School, Goodman proceeded to University College, London, where he formed a lifelong friendship with L. C. B. (Jim) Gower and graduated with second-class honours in law in 1933. After taking the LLM in 1935, and serving articles with the London firm of Rubinstein Nash (his mother being a friend of one of the partners' wives), he studied Roman law and Roman-Dutch law at Downing College, Cambridge, obtaining firsts in both parts of his degree. Abandoning thoughts of practising in South Africa, he joined the firm of Royalton Kisch, which specialized in conveyancing and local government work. As a young solicitor he scored a notable success in a case brought against Croydon borough council on behalf of parents whose daughter had contracted typhoid from drinking contaminated water. On the outbreak of the Second World War he enlisted with the Royal Artillery, joining an anti-aircraft battery in Enfield under the command of the archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler. After a spell as battery quartermaster sergeant&#151;according to Wheeler, &#145;the best &hellip; in the army&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 15 May 1995)&#151;he was transferred to the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, southern command. Demobilized in November 1945, with the rank of major, he returned to the law first with Royalton Kisch and then (from 1947) as a partner in Rubinstein Nash. Stanley Rubinstein was chairman of the Performing Right Society, and the firm had many clients from the worlds of the media, literature, and the arts. Goodman took many of these clients with him when in 1954 he founded his own practice, Goodman Derrick&#151;Derrick being Henry &#145;Mac&#146; Derrick (1916&#150;1964), a wartime colleague at southern command and a keen amateur organist. The firm expanded rapidly, specializing in particular in media, copyright, and libel law.<br>
<br>Goodman's introduction to political work came, like much else in his career, through a contact he had first made in the war: George Wigg, who introduced him to Wilson and the group of mainly left-wing MPs who surrounded Aneurin Bevan in the early 1950s. But it was not until 1957 that Goodman's breakthrough case took place. This was the controversial <span class="italic">Spectator</span> libel trial in which three leading Labour figures, Bevan, Richard Crossman, and Morgan Phillips, were accused of being drunk at an International Socialist Congress in Italy and may have perjured themselves while denying it. Goodman at least suspected the perjury but was certainly not told. The triumphant victory of the three under his guidance made national news. Following the trial he regularly represented MPs and worked for the party leader Hugh Gaitskell during the Vassall spy inquiry in 1962 and in a long-running case against <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>.<br>
<br>Goodman had charm, he was witty, and he could frequently persuade people to do what he or his clients wanted. When the charm failed, he would deploy an injured look or simply decline to understand the grounds for refusal. He was not an ideological or a campaigning lawyer but a highly effective advocate for his clients. He would have remained an interesting and successful solicitor, but in January 1963 Gaitskell died from a rare disease, and after a bitter leadership election Harold Wilson was elected leader of the Labour Party. Goodman was on the fringes of the Gaitskell set and therefore on the fringes of politics. Soon he was at the very heart. There is a certain irony in the way in which it was Goodman's expertise in media law that brought him to the attention of Wilson. The irony derives in part from Goodman's own ambiguous relationship with fame and publicity (he later became notorious for his own propensity to litigation), in part from the fact that one of his key roles for Wilson was to keep Labour affairs out of the media. Despite this it was as a media lawyer that Wilson first made use of Goodman, and it was for his power to intimidate journalists that Goodman proved extremely useful to many.<br>
<br>Wilson made Goodman. Without Wilson's patronage and need for consultation and a peculiar kind of friendship, Goodman would not have risen to the heights he did. After he became Wilson's lawyer, and especially after 1965 (when Wilson elevated him to the Lords, as Baron Goodman of the City of Westminster), his career made him a unique figure in post-war British history. It bothered Goodman as he grew older that his public stature was due to Wilson's patronage. His waspish references to Wilson in his memoirs reflected annoyance that he, in a sense, owed it all to the younger man from Huddersfield. It is hardly surprising that Wilson asked so much of him. With no family constraints and with a willingness to cancel meetings or break off dinners to do Wilson's bidding, Goodman became a close confidant. Throughout the government of 1964&#150;70 he visited Wilson every week or every other week and frequently sat opposite him in the chancellor of the exchequer's chair in the cabinet room, serving as a sounding board.<br>
<br>On Wilson's first day in number 10 he asked Goodman to chair a committee to explore the future of the London orchestras. It was the first of Goodman's many distinguished contributions to the arts. Shortly afterwards, Wilson asked him to be chairman of the Arts Council of Great Britain. It was his most successful job in public life, and one which he held until 1972 (when he was appointed CH in recognition of his services). He was a dynamic and effective chair, and his influence extended out from the arts to a range of organizations in which he played the role of fixer, usually as chairman. He was &eacute;litist and metropolitan in his view of arts policy; Jennie Lee, the arts minister until 1970, was interested in regional and popular culture. This led to occasional rows and delays in making decisions, but in the main the relationship was fruitful and successful.<br>
<br>In the ten years after 1965, when he was at the height of his powers, Goodman's influence was felt on the development of bodies as diverse as the charity Motability (which he founded), the Housing Corporation, English National Opera, the Royal Opera House, the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, the National Theatre, the British Council, the Institute of Jewish Affairs, and numerous committees of inquiry. In 1967 his friend David Astor persuaded him to become chairman of the trustees of <span class="italic">The Observer</span> (in which capacity he oversaw the sale of the newspaper in 1976), and he was an influential chairman of the Newspaper Publishers' Association from 1970 to 1976. In addition he ran his private practice, Goodman Derrick, which grew into a successful partnership based on libel and media law. He was later described by one friend and client as &#145;the greatest negotiator of the age&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 15 May 1995). His style of fixing was imaginative and resourceful. For example, he was asked to write an assessment of the potential cost of the new &#145;university of the air&#146;. He considered the amount that the cabinet was likely to accept and then cooked a response that made this look plausible. Wilson backed the scheme strongly and the Open University was created. In the Lords on 23 May 1974 Goodman said: &#145;When I see the figure I mentioned and the figure it is now costing I ought to blush with shame&#146;. He did not blush because it might not have been established except for his &#145;foolish miscalculation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5L</span>, 351, cols. 1649&#150;50).<br>
<br>Despite being the establishment's lawyer, Goodman did not accumulate vast wealth of his own. He did not take a salary from any of his public offices and often did not bill clients he counted as friends&#151;and there was no shortage of friends. Indeed Arnold's friends could crop up in the most useful places. In 1969 the public accounts committee investigated the Arts Council, of which Goodman was chairman. Harold Lever was the committee's chairman. The auditor-general suggested there might be some conflict of interest. He said to Lever: &#145;Do you think you ought to preside over this committee since I believe that Lord Goodman is rather a pal of yours?&#146;, to which Lever replied: &#145;A pal? No, he is not a pal of mine, he is a very dear friend&#146;  (Goodman, <span class="italic">Tell Them</span>, 282). The report cleared the council of any wrongdoing. This acquisition of friends was close to the root of Goodman's motivation in life. He spent forty-five years on the telephone. This relentless quest for work, this unstoppable giving of aid and advice, filled a void in his life that in most other people would be occupied by home, family, and children. Goodman liked being at the centre; he liked doors opening, people taking his calls, people knowing who he was&#151;and he liked people doing things because he asked them. As the Goodman wagon rolled, he expected people to do what he wanted. He was perplexed when one musician refused to do his bidding, unimpressed by Goodman's allusion to the needs of &#145;important people, titled people&#146;. In the world of access, social cachet, and influence, he was absolutely at sea with people for whom such things were meaningless or trivial. Work also served emotional needs for friendship and companionship, and introduced him to the series of widows who acted as his consorts from the late 1950s. The most important of these was Ann Fleming, widow of the James Bond creator, Ian, who used to stay in his Portland Place flat when visiting London. Fleming in turn introduced Goodman to new clients such as Evelyn Waugh:<blockquote>The only person who can save your trust is Lord Goodman &hellip; he admires your work, is clever and funny, he has done much for me and never sends a bill. He has saved me from the solicitors, found me a doctor &hellip; and can get tickets for the National Theatre. (Brivati, 96)</blockquote>Goodman also fell for Jennie Lee (Nye Bevan's widow) and was later close to Anthony Eden's widow, Clarissa. Although he was clearly besotted with Lee, and friends remember them kissing and cuddling, the evidence suggests that his sexuality was deeply repressed. What each of these formidable women had in common was a similarity to the most important female presence in his life&#151;his domineering mother, Bertha.<br>
<br>When Wilson lost power in 1970 Goodman took on a number of new public roles in addition to his main job at the Arts Council, and continued to build up his practice. He was also dispatched by Edward Heath to Rhodesia as a secret negotiator with Ian Smith (having performed a similar role for Wilson, in the run-up to the latter's talks aboard HMS <i>Fearless</i>), a task to which he was particularly unsuited. From 1964 to 1970 Goodman had seen Wilson most weeks for their late evening chat. When Wilson, a little unexpectedly, returned to number 10 in 1974, the same pattern of involvement in the prime minister's life was not re-established and the centre of the political world began to shift away from Goodman. Indeed, the corporatist establishment of the age of Harold Wilson was in terminal decline in the second half of the decade. The self-destruction of Jeremy Thorpe was emblematic of a new era. The part of Goodman that always felt ambivalent about being in the spotlight welcomed the change. Another part of him wanted to cling to the wreckage of his life at the centre of politics, but this was made more difficult because of the cooling of his relations with Wilson. The last two decades of his life witnessed a gradual decline in his health and his public standing, along with an increasing sense of isolation as old friends died and a new political establishment came to dominate.<br>
<br>Goodman's acceptance of the mastership of University College, Oxford, in 1976 contributed further to the cooling of his relations with Wilson. As Goodman later told the story, during Wilson's last days in office he asked Goodman to help him become master of University College. &#145;It was one of the most awkward moments of my life, since I had in my pocket at the time a letter from the Fellows of the College offering the job to me&#146;  (Brivati, 270). Goodman's tenure at University College was notably successful and happy for him. He continued to fix and run things, but on a much less exalted scale, replacing politicians with dons and students. He presided over a potentially fractious college body with great skill, and was especially successful at fund-raising. He also helped to put the Oxford Union on a sound financial footing. He retired as master in 1986, and in 1993 celebrated his eightieth birthday with a gala banquet at Lincoln's Inn hall and the publication of his largely unrevealing memoirs, <span class="italic">Tell Them I'm on My Way</span>.<br>
<br>Though never accountable for his actions to any electorate, Arnold Goodman was a man of influence and power from the time of the Profumo scandal in 1963 until the election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979. He was the fixer for the British establishment. He spent a large part of his life helping other people: lending money, finding jobs, saving marriages and companies, giving time to good causes, and pressuring his wealthy friends to donate to the charities that he chaired. Above all he was friend to a host of private people and a benefactor to many. The darker side of this remarkable life was that he used his influence to protect powerful people from the press, and sometimes the quick fixes he put in place caused more long-term harm than good. His last years were overshadowed by a lawsuit brought by the Portman family in 1993, and by allegations that he had systematically siphoned off funds from the family trust in order to provide loans to his friends, including senior Labour Party figures. The case was eventually settled in 1999 when Goodman Derrick paid &pound;500,000, though without admission of guilt, and the allegations remained unproven. Goodman died, unmarried, of bronchopneumonia at Newstead Home, Denewood Road, Highgate, London, on 12 May 1995. A memorial service was held at the Liberal Jewish Synagogue; he had been president of the Union of Liberal and Progressive Synagogues from 1987 until his death.<br>
