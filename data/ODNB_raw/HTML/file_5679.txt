<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clinton,  Edward  Fiennes de</span>, first earl of Lincoln  (1512&#150;1585), <span class="occ">military commander</span>, was the only son and heir of Thomas Fiennes de Clinton, eighth Baron Clinton and Saye (<i>c</i>.1490&#150;1517), and his wife, Joan, illegitimate daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22683/', "Sir Edward Poynings (1459&#150;1521)")</script>. Thomas, whose seat was at Folkestone Manor, served Henry VIII as a captain at Tournai in 1515. He succeeded his father as eighth baron the same year, but held the title for only two years: after his death on 7 August 1517 his five-year-old son's wardship was granted to Poynings. Edward, ninth Baron Clinton, was granted possession of his father's lands in November 1535, aged twenty-three. On 27 April 1536 he was summoned to parliament by a writ addressed to &#145;Edwardo Fenys de Clynton et Say&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Marriagesandmilitaryservice"></a>Marriages and military service</h2>In the early 1530s Edward acquired a Lincolnshire estate through marriage to Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Blount and widow of Gilbert, Lord Tailboys, who had settled his Lincolnshire estate upon her [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73234/', "Blount, Elizabeth (c.1500&#150;1539x)")</script>]. Clinton and Elizabeth had three daughters, one of whom, Bridget, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8366/', "Robert Dymoke (d. 1580)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42007/', "Dymoke family (per. c.1340&#150;c.1580)")</script>]. Elizabeth, a former mistress of Henry VIII, was also mother of the king's illegitimate son, Henry Fitzroy, duke of Richmond. Through the marriage Clinton appears to have won the king's favour. He attended Henry VIII at Boulogne and Calais in 1532, acted as a cup-bearer at the coronation of Anne Boleyn in 1533, and was present at Anne's trial in May 1536. Later that year, when most Lincolnshire gentlemen rebelled against the king in the Pilgrimage of Grace, Clinton raised 500 of his servants and tenants against them, joining forces with the royal army to suppress the rebels. Clinton was rewarded by the grant of the house and site of the dissolved monastery of Sempringham, Lincolnshire, which he made his principal residence, and, in addition, the houses and sites of the dissolved priories of Haverholme, Lincolnshire, Folkestone, Kent, and Flitcham, Norfolk. In June 1541 a further grant of lands was made to Clinton, but jointly with his second wife, Ursula (<i>d</i>. 1551), daughter of William, seventh Baron Stourton, and his first wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Edmund Dudley and sister of John Dudley, the future duke of Northumberland. Clinton had two daughters and three sons with Ursula. The eldest son was Henry (1540&#150;1616), later tenth Baron Clinton and second earl of Lincoln. In 1544 Clinton served in Hertford's Scottish expedition under the command of his wife's uncle, John Dudley, then Viscount Lisle and lord admiral. Clinton participated in the burning of Edinburgh and Leith, and was knighted on 11 May at Leith by Hertford. Shortly afterwards he accompanied Lisle to France; he arrived in Boulogne on 28 July with 900 men, and assisted in the siege of Boulogne, entering the town on 18 September.<h2>
<a name="ThereignofEdwardVI"></a>The reign of Edward VI</h2>After the accession of Edward VI, when the Hertford&#150;Lisle coalition dominated the regency council, Clinton's military association with the two, strengthened by his marriage to Lisle's niece, paid dividends. Under the &#145;unfulfilled gift clause&#146; of Henry VIII's will, Hertford (now Protector Somerset) directed to Clinton a grant of confiscated Howard lands in Lincolnshire worth about &pound;52 per annum. In June 1547 Somerset appointed Clinton admiral of the fleet that went on to co-operate with the land forces in the invasion of Scotland and in the decisive English victory over the Scots at the battle of Pinkie. Clinton was then given responsibility for the surrender of Broughty Castle and for supervising its fortification as an English garrison. He was again rewarded with a further grant of lands, mainly in Lincolnshire, worth &pound;61 5<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per annum. By April 1549 he was governor of Boulogne, defending the garrison until the treaty of Boulogne was signed on 24 March 1550 and then supervising the English withdrawal from the town. He was rewarded by his appointment on 4 May 1550 as a privy councillor and as lord high admiral of England for life, with an annuity of 200 marks. Clinton's living was deemed insufficient to maintain him in such high office and so, on 11 May, the privy council granted him an additional &pound;200 in land and made him a gentleman of the king's privy chamber. Clinton was also elected a knight of the Garter in April 1551 and was installed on 30 June. Later that year he was granted the former Howard estate at Tattershall, Lincolnshire, worth &pound;83 0<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. per annum, which he made his principal seat, with Sempringham as his second residence.<br>
<br>In October 1551 Clinton represented the king at the baptism of Henri II's son, &Eacute;douard Alexandre, duke of Angoul&ecirc;me, and received the formal ratification of the marriage treaty between Edward VI and Henri's daughter, Princess Elizabeth. On 15 April 1552, &#145;in consideration of his expenses in his late journey in France&#146;, he received a grant of lands worth &pound;70 per annum  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1550&#150;53</i>, 363). Ursula, Lady Clinton, had died in the previous year and in 1552 Clinton married for the third time. His new wife was Elizabeth (1528?&#150;1589) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9549/', "Clinton, Elizabeth Fiennes de")</script>], widow of Sir Anthony Browne and youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9555/', "Gerald Fitzgerald, ninth earl of Kildare")</script>. They had no children.<h2>
<a name="PhilipandMary"></a>Philip and Mary</h2>Despite his remarriage Clinton maintained his allegiance to his second wife's uncle, now duke of Northumberland. After Edward VI's death on 6 July 1553, Clinton seized the Tower in support of Northumberland's plot to exclude the Catholic Mary from the succession and to place Lady Jane Grey on the throne. Imprisoned after the plot failed, Clinton begged Queen Mary for forgiveness and was pardoned on 27 July, compounding for &pound;6000. The queen would not allow him to continue as lord admiral, but Clinton was a skilful politician and within a few months had won her trust. In January 1554, hearing that Sir Thomas Wyatt's Kentish rebels threatened the capital, Clinton and the earl of Pembroke promptly raised a force of 5000 or 6000, confronting the rebels at Temple Bar. Clinton was then appointed lieutenant-governor of London and its neighbourhood, with &#145;troops and ample powers&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1554</i>, 140). Two years later he was granted lands in Lincolnshire worth &pound;60 per annum in consideration of his service.<br>
<br>Clinton attended Philip of Spain on his arrival in England in July 1554 and was rewarded with a pension from Philip of 1000 crowns per annum. That autumn Mary sent Clinton to invest the duke of Savoy with the Order of the Garter, instructing him to visit Philip in Brussels on his return journey. In April 1556 Clinton was again Mary's envoy, travelling to Blois to congratulate Henri II on the truce of Vaucelles between France and Spain. The truce was short-lived. The following March Philip sought military assistance; Henri II's support of English rebels in France provoked a declaration of war against France on 7 June 1557. Pembroke and Clinton's expeditionary force was transported to France to assist in the duke of Savoy's siege of St Quentin: it reached the town after the turning point of the siege, but joined with Philip's forces in the final assault on 27 August.<br>
<br>After the surprise French attack on Calais, which fell in early January 1558, Philip tried to persuade the privy council to retake the town immediately. The council refused, but Clinton, with typical political skill, overtly supported Philip's plan. Proclaiming his confidence in Clinton, Philip advised Clinton's reappointment as lord high admiral. Duly reappointed on 12 February 1558, Clinton was also named to Mary's privy council because &#145;he is in favour with the Queen and knows more about military affairs than the others&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1554&#150;8</i>, 349&#150;50), and was appointed to the newly formed council of war. On 1 May the Spanish ambassador told Philip that &#145;I have always found the Admiral full of goodwill&#146;  (ibid., 378). Two weeks later he stressed the importance of the admiral's presence in council for the progress of the war: &#145;Although the Admiral is a double-dealer and principally concerned with his own interests, he has more authority than anyone else in these particular affairs, and feels more obligation towards your Majesty&#146;  (ibid., 385&#150;7). Clinton's task was made more difficult, however, by Mary Stuart's marriage to the French dauphin: the already demoralized council was aggrieved that while Philip was demanding English contributions to his war effort, he refused to sever his own relations with Scotland. The Spanish ambassador reported that the council had &#145;even reproached the Admiral for not having &hellip; told you how much feeling there is about it&#146;, but that &#145;the Admiral says he did not mention it &hellip; because he only likes to tell people things they will be glad to hear&#146;  (ibid., 394&#150;6).<br>
<br>Despite the council's misgivings, Clinton agreed to make the English fleet available throughout the summer to assist the Spanish campaign in France. In July 1558 a joint English and Flemish fleet attacked the Breton coast, aiming at Brest, but the 7000 men landed by Clinton met with unexpected resistance. Abandoning their attempt, the fleet returned to Portsmouth, where Clinton learned of French preparations to transport troops to Scotland. Sending Vice-Admiral Winter to intercept them on their voyage north, Clinton took the rest of the fleet to Normandy; he attempted a landing, but the fleet became fogbound, losing the advantage of surprise. The fleet returned to Portsmouth, bringing the unsuccessful summer campaign of 1558 to an end.<h2>
<a name="TheaccessionofElizabeth"></a>The accession of Elizabeth</h2>Within four days of Mary's death in November 1558, Clinton was appointed a member of Elizabeth's privy council. His wife, Elizabeth, had been brought up with the queen and became a member of her privy chamber, attending her between 1559 and 1585. Clinton further strengthened his position by remaining on good terms with both William Cecil and Lord Robert Dudley, siding with each at different times, depending upon the issue. In July 1559, with a renewed threat of French military intervention in Scotland after Fran&ccedil;ois II's accession to the French throne with Mary Stuart as queen, Clinton advocated early action. The queen and most councillors were uncertain but, when the French reached Leith, it was agreed to send a fleet to the Firth of Forth, with Clinton (as lord admiral) directing the operation. By early May 1560 the English had failed to end French resistance in Leith, and Clinton advocated additional forces to end the siege, passionately proclaiming his readiness to risk his own life in this venture. In early June, Clinton was at sea with the fleet, planning to intercept French reinforcements. There was no confrontation, since the French fleet was lost in a storm. The French war effort soon crumbled. Clinton again led the English fleet against the French in summer 1563, to relieve English troops besieged in Le Havre, but arrived two days after the garrison had surrendered.<br>
<br>On 24 November 1569 Clinton and Warwick were appointed lieutenants-general of the forces to suppress the rising of the northern earls. Clinton's troops set out from Lincoln on 1 December, marching north and uniting with the forces raised by Warwick and the earl of Sussex, lord president of the council of the north. When the royal army approached Darlington on 17 December the rebels fled to Scotland. Clinton was rewarded for his service when, on 4 May 1572, he was created earl of Lincoln in recognition of &#145;his service to Henry VIII, Edward VI and Queen Mary, and to the present Queen, particularly during the late rebellion in the North; and for his service as High Admiral both to the present Queen and Queen Mary&#146;. The following month Lincoln was sent to Paris to ratify the treaty of Blois, signed on 19 April and marking a new Anglo-French defensive alliance against Spain. This was the last major service that Lincoln (now aged sixty) performed, although he continued in the office of lord admiral and remained at court and a member of the privy council until his death.<br>
<br>In his will dated 11 July 1584 Lincoln bequeathed Tattershall Castle to his son and heir, Sir Henry Clinton, and Sempringham to his wife, Elizabeth, for life. Correctly anticipating that Elizabeth might have &#145;some trouble or disturbance&#146; from Henry over the will, Lincoln made detailed provisions against it. Henry contested the will, but in March 1587 it was confirmed by sentence. Lincoln died in London on 16 January 1585, aged seventy-two. He was buried in St George's Chapel, Windsor, where an ornate monument commemorates his life and the Lincoln chapel was named in his honour.<br>
