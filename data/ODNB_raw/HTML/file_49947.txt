<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Roskill, Sir  Ashton Wentworth</span>  (1902&#150;1991), <span class="occ">barrister and public servant</span>, was born on 1 January 1902 at 33A Montagu Square, London, the eldest of four sons of John Henry Roskill (1860&#150;1940), barrister, and his wife, Sybil Mary Wentworth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dilke (1879&#150;1931), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7644/', "Ashton Wentworth Dilke (1850&#150;1883)")</script>, traveller and Liberal MP for Newcastle upon Tyne, who was the younger brother of Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke, second baronet (1843&#150;1911), writer and politician. Roskill's three younger brothers were themselves to have remarkable careers. The second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31628/', "Stephen Wentworth Roskill (1903&#150;1982)")</script>, was the leading naval historian of the Second World War; the third son, Oliver Wentworth Roskill (1906&#150;1994), was one of the first industrial consultants; and the fourth son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63307/', "Eustace Wentworth Roskill, Baron Roskill of Newtown (1911&#150;1996)")</script>, was a lord of appeal in ordinary.<br>
<br>Roskill was educated at Winchester College and at Exeter College, Oxford, of which he was a scholar and where he achieved a first-class honours degree in modern history. He gained a certificate of honour in the bar examinations, and was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1925. He became a pupil of D. N. Pritt, a very clever and successful barrister who then had a substantial commercial practice. He became a member of Pritt's chambers, and gradually built up a respectable general practice. On 29 July 1932 he married Violet Hester Willoughby (Vidy) Waddington (1904/5&#150;1964), daughter of Charles Willoughby Waddington (1869&#150;1946), principal of Mayo College, Ajmer, India, from 1903 to 1916 and guardian to the maharaja of Jodhpur from 1919 to 1923. They had two children: John, who became a naval officer, and Susannah, who married John Stewart Hobhouse, Baron Hobhouse of Woodborough, a lord of appeal in ordinary.<br>
<br>Roskill's career at the bar was seriously interrupted by the outbreak of war, during which he served with MI5 from 1940 to 1945. His capacity for keeping secrets was proverbial, and he never revealed anything about his wartime work. His chambers in the Temple were bombed out. After the war he returned to his practice as a barrister and struggled to set up a new set of chambers. This was no easy task, especially at that time. He was appointed king's counsel in 1949; but his practice, though a commercial practice of high quality, was never of the size he deserved. He was perhaps at his best in the House of Lords and the privy council, scoring one or two notable victories there; his best known case was <span class="italic">The Wagon Mound</span> ([1961] A.C. 388), the leading authority on remoteness of damage in the law of torts.<br>
<br>Roskill was not appointed to the High Court bench, a reflection on the limited size of his practice rather than on his personal qualities of intellect and judgement which, in the opinion of many who knew him well, merited his judicial appointment. However, in 1965 he was appointed chairman of the Monopolies Commission (of which he had since 1960 been a part-time member), an office which he held for no less than ten years; and in 1967 he was knighted. This proved to be an excellent appointment. It is probable that in this capacity he rendered greater service to the public than he could have done as a judge. During his time as chairman he presided over panels of the commission which produced as many as forty-three reports, and he took responsibility for many other reports produced by panels chaired by his deputy chairman. The best-known of his reports was that on the drugs Librium and Valium, in which the commission recommended price cuts of 40 and 60 per cent respectively. His <span class="italic">Times</span> obituarist stated that &#145;Roskill presided over the commission with intelligence, shrewdness, charm, wit, tact and sympathy&#146;. Plainly he was also a strong chairman, frightened of no one; and, as in all his work, he was conscientious to a fault, determined to ensure that the commission produced reports which were both fair and thorough. With a very diverse group of individualists on the commission he skilfully employed his considerable social skills in keeping them on good terms with each other and with the staff, by whom he was as well liked as he was respected.<br>
<br>Roskill retired from his position as chairman of the commission in 1975, bequeathing a thriving organization to his successor. From 1968 to 1979 he was an effective and dedicated chairman of the Barristers' Benevolent Association. In 1980 he served as treasurer of the Inner Temple, giving his full time and energy to that post, which he regarded as a great honour. In the same year, through a remarkable coincidence, his brother Eustace was treasurer of the Middle Temple. In 1989 he was elected an honorary fellow of Exeter College, Oxford.<br>
<br>Roskill presented himself as a formidable man, well-built, with a composed expression and dark eyes bright with intelligence. He was cautious and circumspect; and he spoke deliberately and clearly, choosing his words carefully and phrasing them well. Yet there was always a twinkle in his eye which betrayed his irrepressible sense of fun. He was most kind and considerate; he was remembered as an exceptionally kind elder brother and colleague. He was intensely loyal, to his family, to his friends, and to the institutions with which he became identified, and did all he could to advance their interests. In 1931 he was seriously injured in a terrible fire which destroyed his family home in Montagu Square, London, and in which his mother died. Roskill had to jump from the parapet at the top of the house to save his life, and fell onto railings 50 feet below, breaking both his ankles and suffering other injuries. He was lucky to survive. Characteristically, this was an episode which he hardly ever referred to.<br>
<br>Roskill's first wife died in 1964. On 24 November the following year he married Phyllis Sydney (Phil) Borland (1909/10), daughter of Sydney Burney, an art dealer. Her previous marriage had been dissolved. She died in 1990, six months before Roskill, but not until Roskill had celebrated with her his second silver wedding. Roskill himself died at Newbury Dalecare, Stockcross, Newbury, Berkshire, on 23 June 1991, of bronchopneumonia. He was survived by the son and daughter of his first marriage. A memorial service was held at the Temple Church, London, on 16 October 1991.<br>
