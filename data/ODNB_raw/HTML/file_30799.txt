<span class="headword">Beadle, Sir  (Thomas) Hugh William</span>  (1905&#150;1980), <span class="occ">judge in Southern Rhodesia</span>, was born in Salisbury on 6 February 1905, the only son and eldest of three children of Arthur William Beadle, later secretary to the Southern Rhodesian treasury, and his wife, Christiana Maria Fischer. Educated at Salisbury Boys' School and Milton high school, Diocesan College, Rondebosch, and Cape Town University, Beadle, after his BA and LLB degrees, proceeded in 1928 as a Rhodes scholar to Queen's College, Oxford. He played rugby and tennis for his college, boxed for the university, flew in its air squadron, and graduated with a second-class BCL (1930). He later became an honorary fellow of Queen's College, although in 1968 there was an attempt to strip him of his fellowship.<br>
<br>After practising at the Bulawayo bar from 1930, Beadle was elected in 1939 as MP for Bulawayo North, a seat he held until 1950 for the United Party led by Godfrey Huggins. After a period of military service from 1939 to 1940 as temporary captain in west Africa, Beadle's limitless energies were harnessed by Huggins, whom Beadle served from 1940 to 1946 as parliamentary private secretary, acting also as deputy judge advocate-general. Beadle was appointed minister of internal affairs and justice in 1946, the year he took silk, and was appointed OBE. In 1948 he also took on the education and health ministry. In 1950 Beadle became resident high court judge in Bulawayo. He was created CMG in 1957.<br>
<br>Beadle was a learned, fair but also adventurous judge, restrictively interpreting the scope of the criminal law. Conservative politically, he yet rejected racialism, taking the opportunity in <i>Mehta v. City of Salisbury</i> (1961), a case involving exclusion from public swimming-baths on racial grounds, to reject South African case law, because of that country's racial policy. Africans, however, viewed Beadle more as the chairman of a tribunal which upheld the detention of nationalist politicians during the 1959 emergency.<br>
<br>In 1961 Beadle became chief justice of Southern Rhodesia and therefore legal adviser to the governor. Knighted in the same year, and privy councillor from 1964, Beadle presided from 1964 over the Southern Rhodesian appellate division, giving judgments generously interpreting the recently introduced Rhodesian declaration of rights. Particularly notable was his invalidation of an act of the legislative assembly seeking to avoid the necessity of declaring a new emergency by extending the period of preventive detention. Had a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) not occurred Beadle would have been remembered as a Commonwealth chief justice who upheld individual liberty.<br>
<br>Determined to avert UDI, Beadle incessantly initiated procedures for compromise. On UDI in 1965 he moved into the residence of the governor, Sir Humphrey Gibbs, advising him and British ministers, <i>inter alia</i>, on the crucial gubernatorial instruction that all those responsible for law and order should carry on with their normal tasks, an injunction assuring the regime of obedience by state servants and effectively giving it legitimating institutions without the embarrassment of replacing the judges. Beadle accompanied the governor to the talks held in November 1966 on HMS <i>Tiger</i>. He incurred the disapproval of Harold Wilson who thought him &#145;spineless&#146; for failing to help pressurize Ian Smith, the Rhodesian leader, into adhering to his undertaking that he would advise his cabinet to support the <i>Tiger</i> solution.<br>
<br>The judges had avoided pronouncing on the regime's validity until September 1966, when two of them upheld its detention of Daniel Madzimbamuto, a nationalist politician, on grounds of necessity. On appeal, in January 1968, Beadle temporized, holding the detention invalid on a technicality, asserting that the judges still sat under the 1961 constitution, denying the regime <i>de jure</i> status, and yet simultaneously holding that the regime was a <i>de facto</i> government which the Rhodesian courts must recognize.<br>
<br>In February and March 1968, in litigation about Africans sentenced to death before UDI for terrorist offences on facts that would have grounded murder charges, Beadle upheld the regime's power to carry out executions on the basis that a lawful government could have taken such action. Because Ian Smith's minister of law and order had told the court that he would not observe any judgment by the judicial committee of the privy council, Beadle refused leave to appeal to the judicial committee and declined to stay the execution. When the queen, acting on the Commonwealth secretary's advice, commuted the death sentences to life imprisonment, Beadle, arguing that Rhodesia was self-governing, refused to recognize her exercise of the prerogative of mercy. On Beadle's return to Government House, the governor asked him to pack his bags, and the regime began hanging Africans convicted before and after UDI. Two judges resigned, Beadle's reasoning having made it clear that the courts only sat and their decisions were only enforceable with the acquiescence of the regime.<br>
<br>Beadle unequivocally recognized UDI in September 1968, when he held that the Smith regime had attained <i>de jure</i> status as the lawful government of an independent state by reason of a successful revolution. He asserted it his duty to declare this the law, and to choose whether to continue in office under the 1965 UDI constitution, stating he was remaining as chief justice because the existing judges would best preserve the rights of citizens. Subsequently Beadle accepted office under Smith's 1969 constitution, which contained arrangements designed indefinitely to postpone African majority rule. After retirement in 1977, Beadle sat for three years as acting judge in trials under the special criminal procedure for serious &#145;terrorist&#146; cases, carrying the death penalty.<br>
<br>A short, stocky man of ruddy complexion with a toothbrush moustache, Beadle had a blunt manner, looking hard at all whom he encountered. His drive and enthusiasm were overwhelming, whether at work, in charitable activities, or as a courageous hunter and fisherman. He had a warm family life and many friends. In 1934 Beadle married Leonie, daughter of Cecil John Barry, farmer, of Barrydale, Cape Province; they had two daughters. His first wife died in 1953 and the following year he married Olive, daughter of Major Staley Jackson OBE, chief native commissioner, of Salisbury. After her death in a car accident in 1974 he married in 1976 Pleasance Johnson.<br>
<br>Assessment of Beadle depends on the evaluator's predilections. &#145;Devious&#146; to Harold Wilson, vicar of Bray to British officials, &#145;white supremacist&#146; to African nationalists, Beadle's own view was that he did his best for his country in a time of difficult choices. His self-confidence, optimism, and drive to get a solution led him to act as go-between, to ever new formulas for compromise, and to entanglement with the regime. Identifying his country's interests with preservation of the kind of Rhodesia he had spent his political career building, rather than with any need for transition to African majority rule, Beadle ultimately saw loyalty to the usurping regime as necessary to avoid radical political reconstruction. Beadle died in Johannesburg on 14 December 1980.<br>
