<span class="headword">Mayor,  Joseph Bickersteth</span>  (1828&#150;1916), <span class="occ">philosopher and classical scholar</span>, was born on 24 October 1828 at the Cape of Good Hope, as his parents were returning from Ceylon. He was the eighth of the twelve children of Robert Mayor (1791&#150;1846), missionary and cleric, and his wife, Charlotte (1792&#150;1870), daughter of Henry Bickersteth, surgeon apothecary of Kirkby Lonsdale, and his wife, Elizabeth. The family on the father's side was descended from the chief justice of the king's bench, Sir Matthew Hale (1609&#150;1676). The mother's brothers included Henry Bickersteth, master of the rolls and friend of Jeremy Bentham, and Edward Bickersteth, a missionary. Several of Mayor's brothers and sisters followed their parents into evangelicalism.<br>
<br>Mayor attended Rugby School under Thomas Arnold and later joined the school governors. In 1847 he entered St John's College, Cambridge, on a scholarship, joining his elder brothers Robert, a mathematician and author, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34967/', "John Eyton Bickersteth Mayor")</script>, classical scholar and vegetarian. By networking and diligence they all achieved high honours, fellowships, and brilliant careers: Robert became a master at Rugby and rector of Frating; and John Eyton became president of college, university librarian, professor of Latin, and FBA. Joseph was placed second in the first class in classics in 1851 behind his great friend, Trinity fellow and author Bishop Joseph B. Lightfoot. He proceeded MA in 1854, and was ordained deacon in 1859 and priest in 1860.<br>
<br>Mayor's network involved many of the best minds in mid-century Cambridge, including: George Downing Liveing, professor of chemistry; Edwin Abbott, philologist and author; Henry Roby, educational reformer, professor of jurisprudence and MP for Eccles; Fenton John Hort, author and Hulsean professor of divinity; Henry Sidgwick, philosopher; Sir John Seeley, who with Sidgwick established political science at Cambridge; and John Venn, logician and historian. He was drawn into a philosophical network, the precursor of the Moral Sciences Club, called the Grote Society after its leader, Professor John Grote, brother of the historian George Grote, whose adopted niece Alexandrina Jessie Grote (1831&#150;1927), daughter of Andrew Grote of the Indian Civil Service, Mayor married on 29 December 1863. Members included Sidgwick, Venn, John Rickards Mozley, W. Aldis Wright, and John Batteridge Pearson. Friendship, discussion, and judicious criticism, the hallmark of later Cambridge philosophy, were developed here and earlier in The Society, whose members included Leslie Stephen, Henry Fawcett, Sidgwick, and Roby. These networks lasted for life, with the exception of Stephen, who engineered the election of Fawcett over Joseph Mayor for the chair in political economy in 1862. The Mayors, Grote, Sidgwick, Venn, Roby, Hort, and Stephen were among the great Cambridge college and syllabus reformers of the period. They helped establish the moral sciences and became the subject's college tutors, with Mayor writing the famous &#145;The moral sciences&#146; in the <span class="italic">Student Guide to the University of Cambridge</span> (1862).<br>
<br>Mayor had to surrender his college living on marriage, and left Cambridge in 1862 to become a master at and then headmaster of Kensington School (1862&#150;8) before moving to Twickenham and then becoming professor of classical literature (1870&#150;79) and later professor of moral philosophy (1879&#150;83) at King's College, London. His major contribution to philosophy was his lifelong endeavour to publish the work of his mentor John Grote. He edited three of Grote's major philosophical works (1870, 1876, 1900), a collection of <span class="italic">Sermons</span> (1872), and eight articles, assisted by Sidgwick and Hort. Here, as in his own life, he displayed a conversational style, acute criticism, and care for the truth, shared with his network and revealed further in his <span class="italic">Sketch of Ancient Philosophy</span> (1881). Informed by German scholarship, he favoured idealist philosophy and opposed in particular positivism, materialism, scepticism, and the utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. Like Grote, he moved with the romantic current, but he favoured an eclectic moral philosophy, built an ethics around duty, and embellished the Stoic qualities and philosophy of Cicero, whose work <span class="italic">De natura deorum</span> he edited in three volumes (1880&#150;85). He published several classical books, including <span class="italic">Greek for Beginners</span> (1869), <span class="italic">Guide to the Choice of Classical Books</span> (3rd edn, 1885; suppl. 1896), and <span class="italic">Virgil's Messianic Eclogue</span> (1907) with R. S. Conway and W. Warde Fowler. His interest in philology and a desire to counter the corruption of language led to several books, including <span class="italic">Chapters on English Metre</span> (1896; rev. 2nd edn, 1901) and <span class="italic">A Handbook of Modern English Metre</span> (1903; rev. 2nd edn, 1912). His efforts to use critical and liberal Anglican scholarship for restoring credibility to Christianity led to <span class="italic">The Epistle of St James</span> (1892; rev. 3rd edn, 1910), <span class="italic">Clement of Alexandria: Seventh Book of the Stomaties</span> (1902), <span class="italic">Epistle of St. Jude and Second Epistle of St. Peter</span> (1907), <span class="italic">Selected Readings from the Psalms, with an Essay on the Growth of Revelation</span> (1908), <span class="italic">The World's Desire, and other Sermons</span> (1906), and a revealing sermon, <span class="italic">The End of the Century</span> (1901). He took a leading role in founding and running the <span class="italic">Classical Review</span> and was made FBA and honorary fellow at St John's in 1902.<br>
<br>Mayor was grave, serious, and strict as a tutor and parent, but like his friend William Whewell he used his charm, empathy, a sense of justice, reading sessions, and invitations to walk in the Lakes, to find men out and bring them into intellectual networks. He became the fellow editor at the founding of <span class="italic">The Eagle</span>. His children included a brilliant King's College scholar and Apostle, Robert John Grote (Robin) Mayor (1869&#150;1947), who was a pioneer of teacher training and a friend of Moore, Russell, Keynes, and McTaggart. Of his other three children, Henry Bickersteth Mayor (1870&#150;1948) was a master at Clifton College, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38312/', "Flora Macdonald Mayor (1872&#150;1932)")</script> went to Newnham College and wrote several novels, and Alice (1872&#150;1961) kept the family archive. A granddaughter, Teresa Georgina Rothschild, wife of Victor Rothschild, third Baron Rothschild, played a significant role in MI5. Of her three children who survived infancy, Amschel became a banker, Victoria a university lecturer, and Emma a fellow at King's College, Cambridge, and the wife of the economist and master of Trinity College, Cambridge, Amartya Sen. Little is written about the Mayor network though extensive archive material, notebooks, letters, and photographs of them all are now in the Mayor papers in the Wren Library, Trinity College, Cambridge. Mayor died at Kingston upon Thames on 29 November 1916.<br>
