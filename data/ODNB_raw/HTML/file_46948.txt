<span class="headword">Brotherton,  Edward Allen</span>, Baron Brotherton  (1856&#150;1930), <span class="occ">chemical manufacturer and philanthropist</span>, was born on 1 April 1856 at 2 Tiverton Place, Ardwick Green, Manchester, the eldest of three children of Theophilus Brotherton, a yarn agent, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> O'Donnell. His relatives included the educational reformer Edward Brotherton, and Joseph Brotherton, the first MP for Salford. At fourteen he made an abortive attempt to go to sea, returning after two days, when the ship put into Holyhead. He finally left school at the age of fifteen, and worked in a hardware store and as assistant in a chemical laboratory. During this period he also attended Henry Roscoe's evening classes in chemistry at Owens College, Manchester. At the age of nineteen, he obtained a post at a chemical works in Wakefield.<br>
<br>In 1878 Brotherton became a partner in the firm of Dyson Bros. and Brotherton, based in Wakefield, which manufactured ammonium sulphate. Its activities typified Brotherton's approach to business, which, he later suggested, had always been to seek to develop the economic rather than the technical side of the chemical industry. The firm was not technically innovative, aiming rather to exploit the large supplies of ammoniacal liquor produced in the coal-gas industry. It was served by an extensive transportation network, which moved the ammoniacal liquor from gasworks in the surrounding towns to Wakefield, where it was processed on a large scale. Brotherton was both fortunate in business and a shrewd judge of opportunities. During the 1870s Brunner, Mond &amp; Co. was established in Cheshire, manufacturing sodium carbonate by the Solvay process. This process required ammonia, and grew very rapidly late in the nineteenth century, as its product replaced Leblanc soda; Brotherton secured the contract to supply Brunner, Mond. He established other factories, on a similar basis to that at Wakefield, in several major conurbations. In 1881 Dyson Bros. and Brotherton became Brotherton &amp; Co. It exploited other opportunities for the sale of ammonia, supplying the textile industry and becoming associated, through a chance contact between Sir George Beilby and Brotherton, with the Cassel Cyanide Company. This firm extracted gold using potassium cyanide, in the production of which ammonia was employed. Brotherton &amp; Co., meanwhile, expanded into coal-tar distillation, and the treatment of its organic by-products. A range of primary and secondary coal-tar products was manufactured during the First World War&#151;pitch, creosote, naphthalene, anthracene, TNT, and picric acid (an important explosive). Brotherton also purchased the Mersey Chemical Co., which had been German-owned, and extended his interests into the production of both inorganic materials (sulphur dioxide and oleum) and synthetic dyestuffs. His combination of business acumen and relative technical conservatism was highly successful, and in 1902, when his business interests were amalgamated and Brotherton &amp; Co. became a limited company, it was said to be the largest private chemical company in the country. In 1924, on Beilby's death, Brotherton became chairman of Cassel.<br>
<br>Brotherton had many public interests outside his business. He was mayor of Wakefield (1902&#150;3) and Leeds (1913&#150;14), and sat as MP for Wakefield, as a coalition Unionist, from 1902 until 1910, and from 1918 until 1922. But it is as a benefactor of the University of Leeds that he is best remembered, through the university library, and a collection of manuscripts and books which carries his name. His bibliographic interests began in 1922, through the efforts of his niece by marriage, Dorothy Una Ratcliffe, to prevent the export to the USA of a medieval manuscript, the &#145;Towneley Mysteries&#146;, which contained a cycle of plays with Wakefield associations. Characteristically, Brotherton had the manuscript valued, and was unwilling to bid above the valuation when it came up for sale, so that his efforts were unsuccessful. Nevertheless the enterprise led him to begin a collection which eventually included 35,000 books, 400 manuscripts, 4000 deeds, and 30,000 letters, for the administration of which he employed a full-time librarian. Brotherton made a series of large donations to the University of Leeds. He endowed the chair of bacteriology in 1921, and in 1927 donated &pound;100,000 towards the cost of a new university library. One of his last public acts, in June 1930, was to lay the foundation stone of the new library, when he announced that he was leaving his collection of books and manuscripts in trust to the university. When he died, later in the year, his will revealed that he had bequeathed the institution a further &pound;100,000. The Brotherton Library, which was modelled internally on the British Museum reading-room, was completed in 1936. He made numerous other philanthropic donations, including &pound;100,000 for the relief of poverty in Wakefield, as well as contributing &pound;500,000 to the war loan fund.<br>
<br>Brotherton received many honours. In 1923 he was granted the honorary degree of LLD by the University of Leeds. He was honorary colonel of the 15th battalion, the West Yorkshire regiment (the &#145;Leeds Pals&#146;), which he had raised and equipped, and which was later wiped out on the Somme. He was created baronet in 1918 and Baron Brotherton of Wakefield in 1929. He received the Messel medal of the Society of Chemical Industry, of which he was a founder member, in 1930.<br>
<br>Brotherton was of medium height, with vivid blue eyes and a heavy moustache, which gave him a somewhat Elgarian appearance. He was rarely without a carnation as a buttonhole and grew the blooms himself. He was said to drive a hard bargain, and once claimed never to have had a credit balance at his bankers: he could not sleep if he had, and preferred his banker to have the sleepless nights. In 1882 Brotherton married Jane Brookes, the daughter of the artist and designer Warwick Brookes. She died in childbirth in 1883, the child surviving only briefly. He did not remarry, and it is perhaps unsurprising that his niece described him as a &#145;lonely, self-contained man&#146;. He chose as his heirs Charles Ratcliffe, his nephew, who later took the name Brotherton, and Dorothy Una Ratcliffe. He lived during his later years at Kirkham Hall, Yorkshire, and Roundhay Hall, Leeds, and died at Kirkham Hall on 21 October 1930. His burial, which was attended, at his stipulation, only by male members of his family, took place at Lawnswood cemetery, Leeds, on 24 October.<br>
