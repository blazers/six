<span class="headword">Frost,  Gualter <span class="st"> [Walter]</span></span>  (<em>bap. </em>1598, <em>d.</em> 1652), <span class="occ">political agent and government official</span>, came from a modest East Anglian background. He was baptized in Chevington, Suffolk, on 15 January 1598, the son of William Frost. He seems to have been trained as a land surveyor and had become manciple of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, by 1628, remaining there until 1639. He was involved in constructing Hobson's conduit, or &#145;the new river&#146;, which provided a water supply for his own college and Christ's College. In 1639&#150;40 he acted as a secret courier, disguised as a commercial traveller, for the English opposition leaders in their clandestine&#151;if not treasonable&#151;correspondence with the Scottish covenanters. One source connects him with Thomas Savile (first Viscount Savile of Castlebar), another, more reliably, with Robert Greville, second Lord Brooke. In 1642 he was acting as a commissary, or supply officer, at Chester, sending provisions for the Anglo-Scottish forces in Ireland. In 1642&#150;3 he apparently served as an intelligence officer under the Long Parliament's committee of safety.<br>
<br>Frost's promotion in 1644 to the important post of co-secretary to the new committee of both kingdoms may have been partly because he was already known to, and trusted by, its Scottish members, but it also suggests more direct patronage. Since Brooke was already dead and Savile discredited, Robert Rich, second earl of Warwick (an old member of Emmanuel), and William Fiennes, first Viscount Saye and Sele (whose eldest son had been there) appear as possible links. When the Scots dropped out, Frost moved with the committee to Derby House in 1647&#150;8, and after the establishment of the Commonwealth in 1649 he became secretary to the newly created council of state. He held this, the most senior post in the republican central executive, until his death. Presumably efficient and discreet as an administrative organizer and record keeper, his were less successful essays into political propaganda, on behalf of the regime against its radical critics, the Levellers.<br>
<br>It was important for the future of the English republic that Frost was succeeded not by his eldest son, who had become assistant secretary and treasurer for the council's contingencies, but by the candidate of Oliver St John and Oliver Cromwell, John Thurloe. Frost had married Phoebe Seffray in Chevington, Suffolk, in 1619. He died in London on 29 March 1652, leaving a large family and considerable debts. He showed some nepotistic, or rather patrimonial, skill in getting his sons placed in the public service; his failure to amass even a modest competence of wealth may be taken to argue either extreme probity or reckless extravagance, but more probably arose from having over-extended his credit in trying to send supplies to Ireland in 1642. The younger Walter, who seems to have succeeded his father in the service of the City of London as its official chronologer, remained on the council staff until 1660, as did one of his brothers; a third brother had died in its service earlier, and a fourth was appointed to the staff of the council in Ireland under Henry Cromwell. After being at the very centre of public affairs, the Frost family sank back into almost impenetrable obscurity.<br>
