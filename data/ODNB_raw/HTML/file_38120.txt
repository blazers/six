<span class="headword">Whitaker,  Laurence</span>  (1577/8&#150;1654), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was, according to Anthony Wood, &#145;a Somersetshire man born&#146;  (Wood, 1.300), but he bore arms associated with the Whitakers of Lancashire. He may have been the son of Lawrence Whitaker and his wife, Cicely, widow of Robert Beale of Peterborough, Northamptonshire. He matriculated from St John's College, Cambridge, in 1593, graduated BA in 1597 and MA in 1600, and was incorporated at Oxford in 1603. He wrote verses for <span class="italic">Crudities</span> and <span class="italic">Crambe</span> (1611), by Thomas Coryate, and was associated with the Mermaid literary club [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95279', "Patrons of the Mermaid tavern")</script>]. By 1611 he was secretary to Sir Edward Phelips, master of the rolls, who appointed him a clerk of the petty bag, a post he held until Phelips's death in 1614. He entered the Middle Temple in 1614 and went into the service of the earl of Somerset in the same year. His new patron was disgraced in 1615 and Whitaker may have suffered by association. From 1619 he was again in favour, securing a grant from James I of fee-farm rents in sixteen counties (1619&#150;24) and then an appointment as clerk extraordinary to the privy council in 1624; he remained in office until <i>c</i>.1642. Whitaker married, after 1613, Margaret (1577&#150;1636), daughter of Sir John Egerton of Egerton, Cheshire, and widow of Thomas Hall of London. They had no children.<br>
<br>Elected as MP for Peterborough in 1624, 1625, 1626, and 1628, Whitaker resided in Drury Lane (becoming a JP for Middlesex and Westminster) and Turnham Green, Chiswick, from 1624. In 1635 he missed out on promotion to the post of clerk to the privy council in ordinary, but a variety of commissions from the king and council provided many opportunities for him to pry into economic activities, maintain monopolies, and exact fees. Although a court agent, a consistent thread of his parliamentary career was his abiding anti-Catholicism and puritanism. Whitaker was a vestryman of St Giles-in-the-Fields from 1622 and supported a fund for building a new church. The threat from Catholics was constantly raised by him in parliamentary debate. In a speech on 25 June 1625 he linked the failures of foreign policies with the activities of domestic papists. On 6 June 1628 he raised the bogey of their &#145;flocking&#146; in the suburbs, claiming that in his neighbourhood of Covent Garden they outnumbered protestants by three to one and had set up an autonomous community  (Keeler, Cole, and Bidwell, 151). Again on 17 February 1629 he declaimed against this &#145;colony of papists&#146; that was &#145;too strong&#146; for &#145;we the ministers of justice&#146; to &#145;cast out&#146;  (Notestein and Relf, 219&#150;20). He opposed the Arminians and gave evidence (1628&#150;9) to the Lords as one who had heard the notorious sermon at St Giles by the king's chaplain, Roger Maynwaring. His zeal earned him the nickname Holy Lawrence. Yet on more overtly political issues he was moderate.<br>
<br>Whitaker's first wife having died on 1 February 1636, he married, by a licence of 6 February 1638, Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1671), daughter of Charles Hoskins of Holborn, Middlesex. In January 1641 he was returned as MP for Okehampton. The king thought he was as big a monopolist as those later expelled from the Long Parliament, but despite his earlier favour at court his puritan sympathies probably inclined him towards the parliamentary side and he soon turned away from the court. He signed the protestation in May, but was sent to the Tower for a week in July when his seizure of the papers of Sir John Eliot thirteen years earlier was brought up. Forgiven and rapidly advanced by the Commons' managers, he joined the important recess committee in September and chaired the inquisitorial information committee in January 1642. He continued to serve on commissions and committees, notably helping to draft the New Model Army ordinance in 1645, chairing the committee on church government in 1645&#150;6, and agreeing to try the king, although he did not sit on the trial commission in 1648. An MP who fled to the army in August 1647, a member of the Rump Parliament, and a dissentient from the crucial vote for further negotiations with the king in 1648&#150;9, he served the regime continuously in Middlesex and Westminster, supervising money raising and defence from 1643 to 1652 and &#145;judging scandal&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) in Suffolk in 1647. Whitaker kept a diary of proceedings in the house, mainly giving the sense of the Commons from 1642 to 1647, now in BL, Add. MS 31116.<br>
<br>Whitaker died on 15 April 1654 aged seventy-six and was buried in St Giles, where memorials to him and his first wife were erected. He left a modest fortune, chiefly property and rents, to his wife.<br>
