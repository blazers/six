<span class="headword">Overman family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1800&#150;1933), <span class="occ">farmers</span>, were tenants of the Holkham estate, Norfolk, by the 1790s, and remained active farmers in the county until the 1950s. The Holkham estate in north-west Norfolk was owned by the Coke family (created earls of Leicester in 1837), and consisted of about 40,000 acres of mainly light land which responded well to the &#145;improved&#146; farming methods that became more widely practised during the eighteenth century. It was the promotion of these methods and the encouragement of farmers such as the Overmans which made T. W. Coke (Coke of Norfolk) famous. The Overman family was one of about a dozen well-to-do families who stayed on the estate for more than 100 years, farming progressively and on a large scale.<br>
<br>A Mr Overman of Burnham Deepdale is described by Arthur Young in 1793 as &#145;a farmer remarkable for the neatness of his husbandry in general&#146;  (Young, 457). Young described Overman's experiments in drill cultivation and his enthusiasm for marling. Three years later Nathaniel Kent commented on Overman's entrepreneurial activities, describing how he kept a sloop &#145;constantly employed taking corn to London and bringing rape cake and manure from Holland, or London or Hull, wherever it could be procured at the best and cheapest rate&#146;  (Kent, 144).<br>
<br>The first member of the family about whom there is evidence is <a name="cosubject_59212"></a><span class="headword">Robert Overman</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1815?)<span class="occ"></span>, who became tenant of Crab Hall Farm, Burnham Sutton, in 1801. Little is known about him; he may even have been the Mr Overman already mentioned by Young and Kent. He was certainly an enthusiastic improver. His brother, F. W. Overman (who in 1814 took on a farm belonging to the duke of Norfolk), described how he marled his land to increase its productivity  (Overman, 234&#150;6). Robert had at least two sons, <a href="#cosubject_59213">John [i] Overman [<i>see below</i>]</a> and <a href="#cosubject_59218">Henry Jacob [i] Overman [<i>see below</i>]</a> who both became tenants of Holkham farms.<br>
<br>The elder son, <a name="cosubject_59213"></a><span class="headword">John [i] Overman</span>  (1789/90&#150;1856)<span class="occ"></span>, took over Crab Hall Farm in 1815, perhaps at his father's death, and the farm was described in glowing terms by the Holkham agent, Francis Blaikie, in 1816. The buildings were in perfect repair, the farm was in a &#145;<i>superior</i> state of cultivation&#146;, the new hedges were kept clean, and claying and marling were carried out with great spirit. The stock was well selected. In conclusion, Blaikie wrote, &#145;Mr Overman is a very deserving, industrious, attentive and persevering good tenant and may be styled a &#147;pattern farmer&#148;&#146;  (Blaikie, &#145;Report&#146;). John had at least two sons, John [ii], born about 1811<a href="#cosubject_59215"> [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and Robert Wright, born in 1814 or 1815<a href="#cosubject_59217"> [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_59218"></a><span class="headword">Henry Jacob [i] Overman</span>  (1793/4&#150;1859)<span class="occ"></span>, the younger son of Robert Overman, moved from the family farm to take over Manor Farm, Weasenham St Peter, also on the Holkham estate, in 1819. In 1843 he gave R. N. Bacon of the <span class="italic">Norwich Mercury</span> a copy of the rotation he had practised since 1820, for Bacon's book on Norfolk agriculture published in 1844. It shows that Overman was practising a typical Norfolk four-course system  (Bacon, 208&#150;10). His 700 acre farm contained a mixture of soils from light to heavy and he kept 800 southdown ewes, 30&#150;40 store cattle, and 30 cows. He was visited by James Caird in 1850, who was surprised to find a herd of dairy cows in Norfolk. Butter and cheese were made and sent to London. The Holkham agent, William Keary, visited the farm in 1851 and described it as a &#145;really good occupation&#146; in a &#145;high state of cultivation&#146;, and he was also surprised to find a herd of Ayrshire cows  (Caird, 170). Henry's wife, Mary Ann, was born in nearby Sharrington, and they had four children surviving in 1851, including <a href="#cosubject_59219">Henry Robert Overman [<i>see below</i>]</a>, their elder son.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_59217"></a><span class="headword">Robert Wright Overman</span>  (1814/15&#150;1874)<span class="occ"></span>, younger son of John Overman, was farming the Burnham Sutton farm when it was visited by William Keary in 1851, and was obviously continuing his father's tradition of good husbandry.<blockquote>It is almost impossible to speak too highly of the excellent cultivation and good management to be seen &hellip; Much might be said in praise of Mr Overman's management, both as to stock and everything else, but it must suffice to say that as a specimen of light land farming and clean cultivation, it stands unrivalled in west Norfolk and probably the kingdom. (Keary's description, Holkham MSS)</blockquote>In 1854 Robert Wright Overman left Burnham Sutton and moved to Egmere, still on the Holkham estate, where he stayed until 1872. The tenancy at Burnham was taken over in 1854 by his brother <a name="cosubject_59215"></a><span class="headword">John [ii] Overman</span>  (<em>c.</em>1811&#150;<em>c.</em>1900)<span class="occ"></span>, who remained there until his death about 1900. Either Robert or John was the Mr Overman, &#145;one of our princely and enlightened sort of farmers&#146;, who was described by the Revd Benjamin Armstrong of Dereham as taking &#145;forty of his men to have a day at the seaside&#146; (Lowestoft). He had shown them the oil-crushing machines and taken them for a sail. &#145;As he paid them their wages just the same I reckon the treat must have cost him about &pound;20. I told him how grateful the community should be to his right conduct and told the men how grateful they should be for so excellent a master&#146;  (Armstrong, 61&#150;2).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_59219"></a><span class="headword">Henry Robert Overman</span>  (1825/6&#150;1891)<span class="occ"></span> took over Manor Farm, Weasenham St Peter, from his father in 1859. By 1881 he was also farming 600 acres in the same parish rented from Viscount Townshend. In 1881 he was interviewed by the royal commission on agriculture, when he was still keeping Ayrshire cattle and producing butter. He also kept 40&#150;50 store cattle and a flock of about 500 Oxford Down sheep. His knowledge of stock meant that he was frequently a judge at Smithfield in London as well as at local county shows. He acknowledged the problems that agriculture was facing by the 1880s and the difficulties there were in finding tenants with capital to run farms  (&#145;Royal commission&#146;, 17.735). Nationally, Henry Robert Overman was a prominent member of the Royal Agricultural Society of England. Locally, he was a supporter of Joseph Arch, Liberal MP for north-west Norfolk, and a patron of the county school set up at North Elmham, Norfolk. However, he was never persuaded to become a county councillor. He died on 2 January 1891, and was buried at Weasenham St Peter.<br>
<br>His elder son, <a name="cosubject_59222"></a><span class="headword">Henry Jacob [ii] Overman</span>  (1862&#150;1933)<span class="occ"></span>, took over the farm from his father in 1891. By 1892, at a time when tenants were leaving the Holkham estates and replacements were difficult to find, he was able to add North Hall Farm and Kipton Ash Farm, both in Weasenham, to his holding, meaning that he was running an enterprise of at least 1806 acres there. His obituary in the <span class="italic">Eastern Daily Press</span> on 11 January 1933 stated that he farmed more than 3700 acres in Norfolk and 1000 in Northamptonshire in partnership with his brother. He also followed in his father's footsteps in taking a prominent role in farming affairs, giving evidence to the royal commission on agriculture in 1916. Described as the most versatile farmer in Norfolk, he was a member of the research committee of the Royal Agricultural Society of England and a protectionist, which led him to be deeply involved in the Agricultural Party set up briefly in 1931. He was nominated by the Central Association of Chambers of Agriculture to be the official representative at the Imperial Conference on wheat prices in Ottawa in 1932, but was not appointed.<br>
<br>Henry Jacob Overman was an active member of the Norfolk chamber of agriculture and its president in 1916. He was a member of the central wages board in 1917 and a long-serving chairman of the Norfolk farmers' union. He was on the committee of the Norfolk agricultural station in the 1920s. He died at Kipton House, Weasenham St Peter, Norfolk, on 9 January 1933.<br>
<br>Members of the Overman family, though tenants of the Holkham estate rather than owners, were significant agricultural innovators in Norfolk from at least the 1790s. Succeeding generations were prominent in the local or national farming community, and became renowned for their contribution to farming progress. In 1952 H. R. Overman was chairman of the Farmers' Club of London.<br>
