<span class="headword">Pecche,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1380), <span class="occ">merchant and mayor of London</span>, may have been the son of Bartholomew Pecche of London. Variously described as a fishmonger and draper, and dealing in wine and cloth, Pecche became very wealthy through his mercantile activities in London. He supplied drapery to the king's wardrobe, held the monopoly for sweet wine sales in London from 1373 to 1376, and had business dealings with the merchants of the Bardi family of Florence and the merchants of Lucca. He traded abroad, and also travelled overseas on pilgrimage in 1350 and again in 1367 to Rome. Pecche was a strong family man, who sought gentry status for his family in the countryside by purchasing property outside London from the 1350s onwards. The property which would become the family home for some 200 years was the manor of Lullingstone, Kent, which he purchased in 1360 from John Ruxley, grandson of Gregory of Ruxley, mayor of London during the reign of Edward I. At the time of his death he held land in Kent, Surrey, Middlesex, Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, Essex, Buckinghamshire, and London. His son and heir, William, was brought up as a member of the gentry, trained in the profession of arms, and lived at Lullingstone, not in London.<br>
<br>By the 1350s Pecche was an established member of the London merchant community and city patriciate. He was alderman of Walbrook ward from 1349 to 1376, sheriff in 1352, and mayor in 1361. In 1351 he was appointed by the city government to raise 20,000 marks from London for the French war. He advised the king at merchant assemblies in 1356 and 1358, represented the city in parliament in 1361, 1369, 1371, and 1372, and in 1370 was a city representative at a royal council. Pecche provided the crown with financial support by contributing to loans supplied by the city, as in 1340, 1346, and 1371; by making a number of personal loans to the exchequer in the 1350s, ranging from &pound;20 to &pound;100; and by acting with Richard Lyons in raising loans for the king from the London money market in the 1360s and 1370s. Pecche also held a number of royal appointments, notably as commissioner of the peace against a robber gang operating in the woods around London in 1353, while in 1358 he was appointed to inquire into the nature and value of the London property of the Augustinian friars, and in 1366 into that of Giovanni de la Mare, merchant of Genoa, who had fled from the realm in debt to the crown. He was commissioner of array in London, Kent, and Essex for men-at-arms and archers in 1358, and for mariners in 1360.<br>
<br>In 1376, however, Pecche was one of those Londoners impeached by the Good Parliament for financial corruption. This centred on his involvement with Richard Lyons and Adam Bury, London merchants and citizens, in the sweet wine monopoly of the city granted him by the crown in November 1373. Under the monopoly only three London taverns were permitted to sell sweet wines, and all of these had been leased from the city by Lyons during Bury's mayoralty in 1365. And when Pecche obtained the monopoly in 1373, Bury was again mayor. This association of Pecche, Lyons, and Bury came under scrutiny in the Good Parliament and all three were found guilty on various corruption charges; Pecche was found guilty of exploiting the monopoly and deprived of his aldermanic rank and freedom of the city. The judgment was reversed in February 1377 and he was pardoned by the crown in April; but he was never restored either to office or to favour in London. However, the impeachment of Pecche, Lyons, and Bury caused divisions within the city which subsequently led to a brief period of constitutional experiment.<br>
<br>John Pecche married twice. His first wife was Ellen, with whom he had a son, William, and two daughters, Katherine and Philippa. There may also have been another son, John, who was dead by 1360. William Pecche, who became a member of the Grocers' Company, had been knighted by May 1380, and in September 1380 married Joan, daughter of John Hadley, a grocer and alderman of London. Katherine Pecche married Thomas Holbeche, a draper who was a business partner of her father's, some time before 1347; when she died in 1349, her children, Alice and William, were entrusted to the guardianship of their grandfather, but both were dead by 1365. Philippa Pecche married her father's ward, John Constantyn, but the marriage was annulled in 1371. When John Constantyn died in 1379, their son, another John, was also placed in John Pecche's guardianship. John Pecche made his will on his deathbed, on 27 May 1380, and was buried in the parish church at Lullingstone. He was survived by his second wife, Mary, who afterwards married Sir William Moigne, a Huntingdonshire landowner.<br>
