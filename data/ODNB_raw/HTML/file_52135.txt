<span class="headword">Jeans <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hock]</span>,  Susanne <span class="st"> [Susi]</span></span>, Lady Jeans  (1911&#150;1993), <span class="occ">organist and musicologist</span>, was born on 25 January 1911 in Vienna, the eldest of the four children of Oskar Hock, the director of a paper mill in Bohemia, and his wife, Jekaterina, who came from a military family. She entered the Vienna Music Academy in 1925, studying the piano and theory with the composer Franz Schmidt, and in 1927 began to play the organ, taking lessons with Franz Sch&uuml;tz. Her interest in baroque organs began in 1929, when she heard the 1710 Silbermann organ in Freiburg Cathedral in Saxony, and was overwhelmed by the beauty of the sound and the clarity of the articulation. After gaining her diploma from the academy in 1931, she gave her first important organ recital in the Grosser Musikvereinssaal in Vienna in December 1931, giving the first performance of Franz Schmidt's prelude and fugue in G, before moving to Leipzig in 1932 to study at the Kirchenmusikalisches Institut with Karl Straube, cantor of the Thomaskirche. In 1933 Charles-Marie Widor, professor of organ at the Paris Conservatoire, invited her to study with him.<br>
<br>Hock made her first recital tour of England in 1934, returning in 1935, when she was a soloist at the Handel festival in Cambridge, playing German baroque music on the organ of St John's College. After an invitation in July 1935 to play at a party at Cleveland Lodge, Westhumble, near Dorking, the home of the mathematician and astronomer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34164/', "Sir James Hopwood Jeans (1877&#150;1946)")</script>, whose first wife had died in 1934, she married Jeans on 30 September 1935; they had two sons and one daughter. Sir James Jeans was a very good organist himself, possessing a large three-manual Romantic organ of 1924, and after their marriage he added a new organ room and installed a 1936 Eule organ for Susi, the first neo-baroque organ in England: the two organ rooms were soundproofed so that they could play without disturbing each other. She built up a collection of keyboard instruments, including an English chamber organ of 1796, a two-manual and pedal harpsichord (for a long time the only one in England), and a working model of a seventeenth-century water organ.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Cleveland Lodge was requisitioned and the family moved to Somerset; then in 1946 Susi Jeans's husband died. After this she resumed her solo career. While her authentic performances and broadcasts of English organ music of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were an important influence on organ building and playing in England, she did not confine herself to early music, and at the inauguration of the Royal Festival Hall organ in 1954 she played Max Reger's &#145;Was Gott tut, das ist wohlgetan&#146;. She also introduced English audiences to works by twentieth-century Austrian composers, including Franz Schmidt, Walter Pach, and Augustinus Kropfreiter. She had first performed in the United States in 1937, and she continued to make concert tours of North America, Australia, and Europe, also giving masterclasses and seminars; in 1967 she was organist in residence at the University of Colorado. She was elected an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Organists in 1966.<br>
<br>Jeans's short piece &#145;In praise of tremulants&#146; (<span class="italic">MT</span>, 1950) was the first of many articles she contributed to English and German scholarly journals, mainly concerning seventeenth- and eighteenth-century keyboard music and its performance and ornamentation; her topics ranged from the pedal clavichord to seventeenth-century musicians mentioned in the Sackville papers, seventeenth-century water-blown organs, the Easter psalms of Christ's Hospital, and the painted organ case in Gloucester Cathedral. Her editions of keyboard music include the complete keyboard works of the Exeter organist John Lugge (<i>c</i>.1587&#150;<i>c</i>.1647), on which she collaborated with John Steele, published in 1990; <span class="italic">Voluntary for Organ in C</span> by Benjamin Rogers (1613/14&#150;1698), published in 1962; and <span class="italic">Four Inventions</span> by H. N. Gerber (1702&#150;1775), published in 1974. In 1972 she lectured at Cornell University on Sir Isaac Newton's studies in music theory. She became increasingly worried about the state of the few old organs remaining in English churches and historic houses, and in 1969 founded the Organ Preservation Society, which saved many organs which would otherwise have been destroyed or altered; the organs were then repaired without altering the pipework or the action, in order to preserve their tone and voicing.<br>
<br>In 1954 Susi Jeans started the Mickleham and Westhumble festival, renamed the Boxhill festival in 1966: this took place in the music room at Cleveland Lodge every year until 1992, concentrating on works by neglected composers of the Renaissance and baroque periods and on newly discovered pieces by better-known composers. In 1978 she founded the annual Cleveland Lodge summer school for English organ music, which she directed. Before she died, she offered Cleveland Lodge to the Royal School of Church Music, although she had never been a church organist herself, and in 1996 the organization moved there. Her pupils included many who became leading organists, including Peter Hurford, David Lumsden, and George Guest.<br>
<br>Despite living in England for nearly sixty years, Susi Jeans never lost her strong Austrian accent. Tall and elegant (she had trained as a fashion model in Austria), she loved skiing and mountaineering, and climbed the Matterhorn twice. She died at Cleveland Lodge on 7 January 1993. Her funeral service was held at Mickleham parish church on 16 January. In 1993 the Lady Susi Jeans Centre for Organ Historiography was founded at the University of Reading.<br>
