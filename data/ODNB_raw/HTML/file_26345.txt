<span class="headword">Steele,  Joshua</span>  (<em>c.</em>1700&#150;1796), <span class="occ">plantation owner and writer on prosody</span>, was born at the start of the eighteenth century but where and to whom is not known. Although his later writings suggest that he was educated, it is not known where or when. He may have lived for a time in Ireland before spending most of his adult years in London.<br>
<br>About 1750 he married Sarah, the widow of Robert Osborne, an absentee owner of a substantial plantation on the Caribbean colony of Barbados. The couple had no children and when she died in 1757 Steele became the owner of a 1068 acre estate. In 1756 he was elected to the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce. Through his membership Steele, a specialist in the theory of music, promoted the study of speech as music. In 1775, besides writing two essays on musical instruments, he published <span class="italic">An essay towards establishing the melody and measure of speech, to be expressed and perpetuated by peculiar symbols</span>. Arguing that speech has melody and rhythm, Steele had developed a notational system for transcribing the phonetic features of English. Through this publication, reprinted four years later as <span class="italic">Prosodia rationalis</span>, he became a major contributor to prosody, the study of the pronunciation of words including tone, accent, pitch, stress, pauses, and volume.<br>
<br>Increasingly frustrated by the poor returns from his holding on Barbados, Steele sailed for the island in 1780. Repelled by the vicious treatment of slaves and the idleness of the poor white population on the island, he resolved to improve conditions for both. The owner of more than 300 slaves, he eschewed violence as a way to improve their productivity. Rather than permit beatings, he established a court of elder slaves to judge plantation offences. He also offered financial rewards. By 1789 Steele had begun to rent land to slaves and pay them wages. In 1781 he founded an organization similar to the London Society of Arts. Serving variously as president and vice-president, Steele led the society's effort to develop local industries for poor white people including the manufacture of cotton yarn, lace, stockings, fibre for making rope, and pottery. The society became less active after 1789, but there is no direct evidence to suggest that it was dissolved under pressure from Steele's opponents.<br>
<br>As he attempted to ameliorate work conditions on Barbados, Steele held a number of offices on the island: sheriff of his parish, a member of the council, and judge. Despite his rise in political influence his efforts to rehabilitate poor white people had little effect on their unemployment and few planters followed his lead in improving the lives of their slaves. Nevertheless, Steele earned an enduring reputation as a reformer who sought more humane treatment of exploited workers, black and white. He died in Barbados on 27 October 1796. William Dickson published Steele's letters to prominent slave-trade opponent Thomas Clarkson describing his reforms and estate management in an 1814 volume entitled <span class="italic">Mitigation of Slavery, in Two Parts</span>. Two mixed-race children named Catherine and Edward whom he sent to England to be educated survived Steele.<br>
