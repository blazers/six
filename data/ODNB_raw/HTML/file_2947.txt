<span class="headword">Boswell, Sir  Alexander</span>, first baronet  (1775&#150;1822), <span class="occ">poet and politician</span>, was born on 9 October 1775 at James's Court, Edinburgh, the first son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2950/', "James Boswell (1740&#150;1795)")</script>, the biographer of Samuel Johnson, and his wife, Margaret (1738?&#150;1789) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65003/', "Boswell, Margaret Montgomerie")</script>], daughter of David Montgomerie of Lainshaw, Ayrshire. When his father moved the family to London in 1786 Alexander briefly attended an academy in Soho Square with his younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2951/', "James Boswell (1778&#150;1822)")</script>; but problems of health and temperament led to his being privately tutored until he went to Eton College in 1789 soon after his mother's death. He entered Edinburgh University in 1792 but did not take a degree. He was nineteen when his father died in May 1795, leaving him a handsome inheritance in land and money. He went to Leipzig to continue his legal studies, but soon gave them up and, after visits to Dresden and Berlin, returned to Britain in 1796. On 23 November 1799 he married, in Edinburgh, Grisel (<i>d</i>. 1864), daughter of the late Thomas Cuming, a banker of the city. They had a son, James (1806&#150;1857), and two daughters, Janet Theresa (<i>d</i>. 1836), who married Sir William Francis Eliott of Stobs and Wells, seventh baronet, and Margaret Amelia (<i>d</i>. 1890), who married General Rawdon Vassal.<br>
<br>A tall, muscular man, fond of field sports, Boswell practised improving agriculture on his estates and was an active officer of the Ayrshire yeomanry, of which he became lieutenant-colonel in 1816. He had inherited a full measure of his father's literary proclivities. As a young man he composed a number of songs, including &#145;Jenny's Bawbee&#146; and &#145;Jenny Dang the Weaver&#146;, which were published anonymously in 1803 as <span class="italic">Songs Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect</span>. He also produced that year the poems <span class="italic">The Spirit of Tintoc</span> and <span class="italic">Epistle to the Edinburgh Reviewers</span>. His later poems, which were based on the traditional ballad style, included <span class="italic">Edinburgh, or, The Ancient Royalty</span> (1810), <span class="italic">Clan-Alpin's View</span> (1811), and <span class="italic">Sir Albon</span> (1811). From the Auchinleck archives he published <span class="italic">A Breefe Memoriall of the Lyfe and Death of Dr James Spottiswood, Bishop of Clogher in Ireland</span> (1811) and a reprint of John Knox's 1561 disputation with Quintin Kennedy, <span class="italic">Ane Oratione</span> (1812). He contributed to George Thomson's collections of Welsh (1809), Irish (1814), and Scottish (1817) songs. In 1815 he established a private press at Auchinleck, which printed his own poems, <span class="italic">The Tyrant's Fall</span> (1815), <span class="italic">Skeldon Haughs</span> (1816), and <span class="italic">The Woo' Creel</span> (1816). Among the works which he published as editor and printer were <span class="italic">Dialogus pius et festivus inter Deum (ut ferunt) et Evam</span>, <span class="italic">Dialogus inter Solomon et Marcolphum</span>, the 1598 edition of <span class="italic">Poems by Richard Barnfield</span>, and reprints of old poems, which were issued at intervals and subsequently grouped in volumes as <span class="italic">Frondes Caducae</span>. One of Sir Walter Scott's circle, he became a member of the Roxburghe Club in 1819. He campaigned for a monument to be erected to Robert Burns, whom he venerated, and on 25 January 1820 he laid the foundation-stone of the monument on the banks of the Doon.<br>
<br>In July 1816 Boswell obtained the seat in parliament which had eluded his father by buying one for Plympton Erle, Devon, at a rate of &pound;1000 a session, on the Treby interest. He came in again at the general elections of 1818 and 1820. A thoroughgoing tory who regarded the whigs as dangerous maniacs, he gave general support to Lord Liverpool's administration. In his maiden speech on 10 March 1817 he stated that Scottish landowners had no wish for parliamentary reform. He opposed reform of the royal burghs on 23 March and 6 May 1819, although on the first occasion he paid lip service to the notion of giving the inhabitants some control over municipal expenditure. In 1819 he introduced a short bill to repeal two old Scottish acts forbidding duelling, which reached the statute book on 3 July (59 Geo. III c. 70). Walter Scott recalled him as a &#145;proud&#146; and &#145;very high-spirited man&#146;, who &#145;thought that his father [had] lowered himself by his deferential suit to Johnson&#146;  (Croker, 2.32). In 1818 Boswell developed a grudge against ministers, especially Liverpool, for what he perceived as their failure to pay him due attention. In response to the circular requesting attendance for the emergency session of November 1819 he asked the home secretary, Lord Sidmouth, who had evidently been willing to court him, for permission to stay away in order to be ready to deal with any radical disturbances in Ayrshire. However, he was prevailed upon to attend to support the government's coercive legislation. In early 1820 he was conspicuous at the head of his yeomanry in quelling local disaffection, with a mixture of force and reason. Liverpool's well-publicized refusal of his request for a baronetcy in recognition of these services intensified his sense of grievance. Further aggravated by his increasing financial problems, created by rash land purchases and compounded by loss of rental income and heavy expenditure on his parliamentary seat and his yeomanry, Boswell decided to take the Chiltern Hundreds on 7 February 1821, the day after voting in defence of ministers' conduct towards Queen Caroline. Through Sidmouth's influence he obtained the coveted baronetcy on 16 August 1821 as reward for his &#145;loyalty&#146; in &#145;supporting his Majesty's ministers in difficult times&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 16.5713).<br>
<br>Henry Cockburn wrote of Boswell that he was<blockquote>able and literary; and when in the humour of being quiet, he was agreeable and kind. But in general he was boisterous and overbearing, and addicted to coarse personal ridicule. With many respectable friends, his natural place was at the head of a jovial board, where everybody laughed at his exhaustless spirits, but each trembled lest he should be the subject of the next story or song. (<span class="italic">Memorials &hellip; by Henry Cockburn</span>, 373)</blockquote>Boswell's relish for expressing his party rancour through vulgar personal abuse brought about his nemesis. In 1821 two scurrilous Scottish newspapers, <span class="italic">The Beacon</span> and <span class="italic">The Sentinel</span>, published a series of pasquinades vilifying the whig James Stuart of Dunearn as a bully and a coward. An unedifying squabble arose between <span class="italic">The Sentinel's</span> proprietors, Robert Alexander and William Borthwick, who was imprisoned for debt; and early in 1822 Stuart took advantage of this dispute to gain access to office documents which revealed Boswell as the author of the squibs. On his return to Edinburgh from London, where he had been taken by the sudden death of his brother, he was challenged by Stuart. He refused either to deny authorship or to apologize. They met at Auchtertool, near Kirkcaldy, Fife, on 26 March 1822. Boswell deliberately fired wide, but in trying to follow suit Stuart, who had never before handled a gun, sent his shot through Boswell's collar bone. He was removed to Balmuto, Fife, where he died the following day. He was buried at Auchinleck. Stuart was tried for murder on 10 June 1822 and unanimously acquitted. Boswell's financial affairs were found to be in great disarray, with liabilities of over &pound;72,000 set against assets of only &pound;10,000. He was succeeded by his son, on whose death without an heir in 1857 the baronetcy became extinct.<br>
