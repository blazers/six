<span class="headword">Barker, Sir  John</span>  (1840&#150;1914), <span class="occ">department store owner</span>, was born at Loose, Kent, on 6 April 1840, the son of Joseph Barker, a carpenter and brewer, and his wife, Ann Sells. He was educated privately and in 1853 began a three-year apprenticeship to a draper in Maidstone. Further experience in drapery shops followed in Folkestone and Dover until 1858, when he moved to London to join Messrs Spencer, Turner, and Boldero, a firm of furnishers and drapers in Marylebone.<br>
<br>After a few years in London, Barker was offered a position at William Whiteley's new emporium in Westbourne Grove. He proved a gifted salesman and was promoted to department manager with an annual salary of &pound;300. Within a year he succeeded in doubling sales at the store and his salary was similarly doubled. He had hoped for a partnership, but Whiteley was reluctant to relinquish sole control. He did, however, offer Barker &pound;1000 a year in compensation.<br>
<br>Meanwhile on 7 January 1865 Barker had married 28-year-old Sarah Waspe, daughter of William Waspe, &#145;gentleman&#146;, of Tuddenham, Suffolk, the ceremony being held at St Matthew's parish church, Bayswater. They had a daughter, Ann Sarah, and a son, John. The latter died young in a riding accident in 1914.<br>
<br>In 1870 Barker left Whiteleys to open a small drapery shop in Kensington High Street, and this was the germ from which sprang the famous department store Barkers of Kensington. His partner, James Whitehead, was already a wealthy merchant and provided capital and credit without interfering in the running of the business. As managing partner Barker drew an annual salary of &pound;250 and lived over the shop with his family. As part owner, he was now able to exploit the modes of retailing that had proved so successful at Whiteleys. By dealing directly with manufacturers and selling for cash he was able to keep prices down and realize a rapid turnover.<br>
<br>Barker had long envisaged a vast store that, unlike most shops of the day, would carry diverse stock. To this end he bought up new premises whenever he could and by 1880 was trading in fifteen shops in Kensington High Street and Ball Street, selling not only drapery goods but also groceries, furnishings, and ironmongery. In 1893 he acquired Whitehead's share in the business. The business now boasted sixty departments and a staff of 1400. Barker continued to expand and in 1907 acquired Ponting Brothers, a fashion store specializing in art needlework in Kensington High Street that was in liquidation. Business continued to boom and in 1908 Barker was awarded a baronetcy in Edward VII's birthday honours list.<br>
<br>John Barker's interests were not restricted to retailing. In the 1890s he had bought a 300-acre estate in Bishop's Stortford which he farmed using the latest methods. He was a breeder of livestock and was famed for his polo ponies and flock of Syrian sheep. He also embarked on a political career, and in 1889 was one of the first aldermen to be elected to the new London county council. He was president of Hammersmith Liberal Association, councillor for Chelsea Liberal Association, and founder president of Bishop's Stortford District Liberal Association. He contested Maidstone three times, in 1888, 1898, and 1900, and although elected on the third attempt was unseated on petition by the Conservatives. From 1906 to 1910 he sat as MP for Penrhyn and Falmouth. He was also a member of the Reform and National Liberal clubs, and after the South African War was a prominent supporter of the Territorial Movement.<br>
<br>John Barker died of cerebral thrombosis and heart failure on 16 December 1914 at his home, The Grange, Bishop's Stortford, leaving no heir.<br>
