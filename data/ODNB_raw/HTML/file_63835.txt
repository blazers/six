<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bigge, Sir  Lewis Amherst  Selby-</span>, first baronet  (1860&#150;1951), <span class="occ">civil servant and author</span>, was born on 3 April 1860 at Oakwood, Kent, the second son of Charles Selby Bigge (1834&#150;1889), landowner and JP, and his wife, Katharina (<i>d</i>. 1918), daughter of John Scott Ogle. He had two brothers. Educated at Winchester College until 1879, where his contemporaries included R. L. Morant and H. A. L. Fisher, he went on to hold a scholarship at Christ Church, Oxford, gaining firsts in classical moderations (1881) and in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1883). He was elected to a fellowship of University College, Oxford, in 1883 and tutored in philosophy, developing a particular interest in the work of the eighteenth-century British moralists. He considered Hume's <span class="italic">Treatise</span> as possibly the most important philosophical work in the English language and published indexed editions of Hume's works, as well as an anthology of the writings of the moralists, which are still highly regarded by philosophers.<br>
<br>On 15 September 1885 Selby-Bigge married Edith Lindsay (1864&#150;1939), daughter of John Robert Davison QC MP; they had a son and two daughters. After his marriage Selby-Bigge commenced studying law, and was called to the bar in 1891 by the Inner Temple. In 1894 he was appointed to the Charity Commission as an assistant commissioner where his somewhat cautious and conservative approach melded admirably with both the work and his colleagues. The transfer of the commission's educational work to the newly created Board of Education after 1900 led to his joining the board as a senior examiner and acting assistant secretary in the charitable trusts division in 1903.<br>
<br>Selby-Bigge's work prior to 1907 was devoted chiefly to resolution of the complicated legal and administrative problems affecting the nation's voluntary schools arising from the implementation of the 1902 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>. This entailed sensitive and delicate negotiations with a variety of denominational bodies and in them he was highly successful, an accomplishment which reflected both his professionalism and his constant delight in creating order out of chaos. His promotion to a principal assistant secretaryship in 1907 was recognition of his considerable administrative skills and he worked more closely with Sir Robert Morant, the permanent secretary, whom he found a challenging but inspirational mentor. Morant's transfer to the National Health Insurance Commission in 1911, because of the damaging affair of the Holmes circular and his conflicts with the elementary school teachers and local education authorities, resulted in Selby-Bigge's succeeding him at the board.<br>
<br>Faced with a muted response to his appointment, a generally hostile teaching world, and a new and untried president in J. A. Pease, as well a poor performance as a witness before the royal commission on the civil service, Selby-Bigge found his initial period as secretary both challenging and formative. His subsequent adoption of a more consultative and conciliatory approach enabled him both to heal existent schisms and to create the beneficial model of dual authority and partnership which came to characterize the relationship of the board, and its successors, with the local education authorities for much of the century. Essentially pragmatic rather than visionary in his approach to education administration and reform, he shared some of his predecessor's &eacute;litist views about the development of the nation's education system and tended to be sceptical about ill-planned or idealistic enthusiasms related to it. Although the events of the First World War reinforced the case for education reform, Selby-Bigge ensured that the board's pre-war views remained paramount through both his membership of Lord Haldane's education committee of 1916&#151;Haldane thought him &#145;a black-browed man, very jealous, and full of red tape and sealing wax&#146;  (Sherington, 179)&#151;and his close working relationship with H. A. L. Fisher (as president). If the passage of the 1918 <span class="roman">Education Act</span> was a triumph for Fisher its contents could also be considered a success for Selby-Bigge.<br>
<br>The creation of both a superannuation scheme and new (Burnham) salary scales for teachers, in 1918 and 1921 respectively, were other signal developments in which Selby-Bigge played a major role. Post-war economic exigencies, however, prevented or impeded the implementation of many of the reforms he valued and also coloured much of his remaining period in the board. None the less, his effective partnership with Fisher ensured that the board deflected or reduced many of the stringent economic cuts to the education system desired by an austere Treasury and the Geddes committee.<br>
<br>Selby-Bigge's seminal role in education developments between 1911 and 1925 has been seen by some as one which either hindered or endangered education reform. Christopher Addison felt he was too much the finicky don, inclined to split hairs and miss key opportunities, while J. Dover Wilson believed his conservative approach effectively betrayed the nation's future. Some historians, notably G. Sherington and B. Simon, have criticized him for continually attempting to reinforce the board's powers, whereas others have indicted him for the lack of development of technical education. One of his colleagues, however, claimed that he had made the Board of Education the headquarters of civilization  (<span class="italic">Times Educational Supplement</span>, 29 June 1951).<br>
<br>In his retirement Selby-Bigge maintained a keen interest in education, publishing several articles about English and Indian education as well as a seminal text on the Board of Education. He served on national and Indian advisory committees, was a co-opted member of East Sussex local education authority until 1946, a governor of Lewes County Boys' School for seventeen years, and a JP. He was appointed CB in 1905 and KCB in 1913; in 1919 he was created baronet; in 1946 he was appointed OBE. He died at his home, Kingston Manor, near Lewes, Sussex, on 24 May 1951, and was buried on 26 May at Kingston church. His son, John Amherst Selby-Bigge (1892&#150;1973), an artist, succeeded to the baronetcy.<br>
