<span class="headword">Thomas,  Herbert John</span>  (1892&#150;1947), <span class="occ">aircraft and aero-engine manufacturer</span>, was born at Fulham, London, on 20 February 1892, the son of Samuel Herbert Thomas, a commercial traveller, and his wife, Victoria Morgan. His education began in London, but when he was fourteen he entered Clifton College, Bristol, which he left in 1909. He took up flying immediately, in balloons and aeroplanes, obtained the Royal Aero Club pilot's certificate no. 51 in 1910, and for a while tested and raced the new Bristol Boxkite.<br>
<br>As the youngest nephew of the millionaire Bristol tramways entrepreneur, Sir George White, Thomas was soon involved in the business of the Bristol and Colonial Aeroplane Company, one of four founded simultaneously by White. At eighteen Thomas was sent to Paris to examine the designs and methods of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Zodiac. He brought back a sample machine from which five copies were made under licence, but as they would not fly the deal was cancelled, with Zodiac paying a penalty of 15,000 French francs. However, all was not lost, as a British empire licence was negotiated for the new 50 hp Gnome engine. Soon French technicians and pilots were crossing the channel to help design Bristol aircraft and to instruct in the company's new school at Larkhill, Salisbury Plain. By 1913, the company's 1910 capital of &pound;50,000 had risen to &pound;250,000 and it would be valued at &pound;553,000 in 1919. By the start of the First World War, Thomas was the works manager at Filton, near Bristol. Like almost all British manufacturers early in the war he had great difficulty in retaining skilled labour, but in August 1916 the company's facilities were declared a &#145;controlled establishment&#146; concurrently with the introduction of conscription; by 1918 the workforce numbered five thousand. In 1912 Thomas suffered a near-fatal head injury when the propeller flew off one of the company's new aircraft while the engine was being ground-tested.<br>
<br>By 1916, Thomas was a director of the company. In 1919, when RAF orders for the famous Bristol Fighter (the Brisfit) were cancelled, Thomas used his energy and imagination to keep the works alive with a nucleus of about two hundred workers. On the first day of May, when civil aviation became legal, he flew to Hounslow, near to the modern Heathrow, in a modified Brisfit known as the Tourer to meet with General J. E. B. Seely, the new under-secretary of state for air, to whom he shortly sold the aircraft. Thomas soon had contracts from Armstrong-Siddeley for automobile bodies and from the parent Bristol Tramways for both tram and omnibus bodies.<br>
<br>In 1920 Thomas married Vera Beatrice, daughter of Stephen Codrington, a veterinary surgeon; they had two sons. Also in 1920, the Treasury's demand for the payment of the wartime excess profits duty led to the dissolution of the Bristol and Colonial Aeroplane Company, among many others, and the transfer of its &pound;553,000 of assets to the new Bristol Aeroplane Company, capitalized at &pound;1 million with the same board and employees, but with the addition of Roy Fedden and his Cosmos Engineering Company. Fedden's engines, enormously successful, were licensed in France and other countries. He personally profited immensely from the agreed royalties, but the Bristol board never accepted him as an equal, and for this Thomas must bear some of the responsibility even though he and Fedden were good friends.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Thomas was the assistant managing director, largely connected with the works management in the production of over 11,000 Blenheims and Beaufighters, as well as Beauforts and well over 100,000 engines. He also saved the second Bulldog fighter demonstrator (1930&#150;35) from the scrapheap and donated it to the Science Museum, London.<br>
<br>A reserved man, like so many British businessmen, Thomas was credited with grace and charm. Not much of a public figure, he was a long-standing member of the Society of British Aircraft Constructors and its chairman in 1933&#150;5. Late in life he became sheriff of Bristol (1946) only to die from cancer on 20 May 1947 following surgery at Frenchay Park Hospital, Bristol. He was survived by his wife. His home was at Old Farm, Sodbury, Gloucestershire.<br>
