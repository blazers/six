<span class="headword">Warner,  William</span>  (1558/9&#150;1609), <span class="occ">poet and lawyer</span>, was born in London. His verse history, <span class="italic">Albion's England</span> (1586), confirms his father was a voyager who accompanied Richard Chancellor to Russia in 1553, and died on the way to Guiana under William Towerson in 1577  (book 11, chap. 62, ll. 1&#150;2; book 12, chap. 70, l. 30). There are no records to support Anthony Wood's claim that Warner studied at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, and he certainly did not take a degree there. Nevertheless, <span class="italic">Albion's England</span> includes a panegyric on the &#145;Primer-schooling&#146; university, which could be either Oxford or Cambridge  (book 15, chap. 99, ll. 1&#150;6). Having settled in London, Warner practised as an attorney in the court of common pleas. On 3 October 1599 he married the widow Anne Dale in Great Amwell, Hertfordshire; a son, William, was born at Ware in Hertfordshire on 18 February 1604  (Mahon, 8).<br>
<br>Warner's earliest publication was an episodic prose romance, <span class="italic">Pan his Syrinx, or Pipe, Compact of Seven Reedes</span> (1584); a second edition appeared in 1597. A translation of Plautus by &#145;W. W.&#146;, <span class="italic">Menaecmi: a Pleasant and Fine Conceited Com&aelig;die</span> (1595), has been attributed, probably mistakenly, to Warner. The author is more likely the committed innovator of English versification William Webbe, whose <span class="italic">Discourse of English Poetrie</span> (1586) includes a defence of Plautus.<br>
<br>Warner is best remembered for <span class="italic">Albion's England, or, Historicall Map of the same Island</span>, licensed to Thomas Cadman on 7 November 1586. A pirate edition had already been printed by Roger Ward; the sheets were seized on 17 October 1586. The long episodic poem narrates the history of Britain from the time of Noah until the Norman conquest, and contains a prose &#145;Breviat of the true Historie of &AElig;NEAS&#146;. In the editions which followed in the next twenty-six years, <span class="italic">Albion's England</span> expanded from four to sixteen books. A second edition in six books appeared in 1589, complete with a folding woodcut detailing the lineages of the houses of Lancaster and York. The third and fourth editions of 1592 and 1596/7, in nine and twelve books respectively, continued the history of England up to the reign of Elizabeth I. In the fifth edition of 1602, enlarged to thirteen books, Warner added a prose &#145;Epitome of the whole historie of England&#146;. Warner praised the new reign of James I in <span class="italic">A Continuance of Albion's England</span> (1606), and <span class="italic">Albion's England</span> appeared for the final time in 1612, after Warner's death.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Albion's England</span> records in fourteen-syllable couplets &#145;the gests of <i>Brutons</i> stout, and acts of English men&#146;  (book 1, chap. 1, l. 4). The text is an eclectic mixture of classical mythology and Christian legend, together with episodes from the English chronicles and theological debate. <span class="italic">Albion's England</span> was dedicated to the lord chamberlain, Sir Henry Carey, first Lord Hunsdon; the 1606 <span class="italic">Continuance</span>, however, was dedicated to Sir Edward Coke. After Henry Carey's death in 1596, Warner added a second dedication in the fourth edition to Henry's son Sir George Carey, second Lord Hunsdon.<br>
<br>Warner was a well-respected poet in his time. Many quotations from <span class="italic">Albion's England</span> appeared in Robert Allott's <span class="italic">England's Parnassus</span> (1600) and Warner's story of Henry II and Rosamund probably influenced Samuel Daniel's <span class="italic">Complaint of Rosamond</span> (1592). Michael Drayton drew on Warner for <span class="italic">Matilda</span> (1594), <span class="italic">Englands Heroicall Epistles</span> (1597), and <span class="italic">Poly-Olbion</span> (1612), acknowledging the debt in &#145;To my most Dearly Loved Friend Henry Reynolds&#146; (<span class="italic">The Works of Michael Drayton</span>, 1931&#150;41, 3.228). Francis Meres called Warner &#145;our English <i>Homer</i>&#146; in <span class="italic">Palladis tamia</span> (1598, 281), while Gabriel Harvey found in <span class="italic">Albion's England</span> &#145;many things &hellip; commendable, divers things notable, somethings excellent&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pierces Supererogation</span>, 1593, 191). John Weever included an epigram on Warner, the &#145;prince of Poets&#146;, in his <span class="italic">Epigrammes in the Oldest Cut, and Newest Fashion</span> (1599, sig. G1<i>r</i>). Thomas Nashe is perhaps more lukewarm in his preface to Robert Greene's <span class="italic">Menaphon</span> (1589), concluding that poetry &#145;hath not beene any whit disparaged by <i>William Warners</i> absolute <span class="italic">Albions</span>&#146;  (1610 edn, sig. B3<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Warner died on 9 March 1609 in the parish of Great Amwell, Hertfordshire, where he had &#145;dwelt awhile&#146; according to John Scott's poem <span class="italic">Amwell</span> (1776). He was buried at the church of St John the Baptist on 11 March 1609. His sudden death is recorded in the parish register by Thomas Hassel, vicar of Great Amwell:<blockquote>M<sup>r</sup> William Warner a man of good yeares and of honest reputation; by his profession an Atturnye at the common plese: author of <span class="italic">Albions England</span>, diynge suddanly in the night in his bedde without any former complaynt or sicknesse on Thursday night, beeinge the 9<sup>th</sup> daye of March; was buried the Saturday following, and lyeth in the church at the upper end under the stone of Gwallter Fader.</blockquote>
