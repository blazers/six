</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pepys,  Charles Christopher</span>, first earl of Cottenham  (1781&#150;1851), <span class="occ">lord chancellor</span>, was born on 29 April 1781 in Wimpole Street, Cavendish Square, London, the second of three sons (another was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21903/', "Henry Pepys")</script>) of Sir William Weller Pepys, first baronet (1740&#150;1825), a master in chancery (who was descended from John Pepys, great-grandfather of Samuel), and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1830), eldest daughter of the Rt Hon. William Dowdeswell.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandeducation"></a>Early life and education</h2>Pepys was educated at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he did not sit for the tripos but was content to graduate LLB in 1803. Contemporaries remembered him as a short,<blockquote>stout, sturdy, thickset boy, of blunt speech and cold disposition, aiming at no distinction, making few friends &hellip; None could say that he was clever; some of his schoolfellows pronounced him dull. His dark, searching eyes, massive forehead and expressive lips, refuted the charge.</blockquote>He never lost his &#145;air of independence and determination which indicated an inward consciousness of superiority&#146;  (Le Marchant, 59&#150;60).<h2>
<a name="Successatthebarandmarriage"></a>Success at the bar and marriage</h2>Pepys was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn on 26 January 1801 and was called to the bar on 23 November 1804, the same day as the future Viscount Melbourne. In 1837 he became treasurer of his inn. Like many of his distinguished contemporaries, he was a pupil of the famous special pleader, William Tidd. His fellow pupil, John Campbell, later Lord Campbell, described him as &#145;the greatest ornament of our [Tidd's] Bar&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of John, Lord Campbell</span>, 1.138). He decided to practise at the emerging chancery bar (he was among the first generation of chancery lawyers who did not go circuit), so, having taken chambers in 16 Old Square, Lincoln's Inn, he began his study of equity with Sir Samuel Romilly. The fact that his father was a master in chancery must have helped his practice. Within five years of his call, his father wrote to Hannah More: &#145;The success of my second son at the Chancery Bar has been most rapid, and highly gratifying to me&#146;  (Gaussen, 2.295). His professional success came from his total dedication to his equity practice and his disdain for society; in later life his only recreation was foreign travel. A chancery advocate did not have to be an Erskine or a Scarlett. Pepys had a clear mind, reasoned cogently, was rarely repetitious, and &#145;never forgot that he was addressing a single judge and that judge a professional man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Law Review</span>, 14, 1853, 354).<br>
<br>Pepys's practice at the bar prospered, enabling him on 30 June 1821 to marry Caroline Elizabeth (1802&#150;1868), the second daughter of William Wingfield KC, then chief justice of the Brecon circuit, and to become another master in chancery. On 24 August 1826 he received his silk gown from Lord Lyndhurst and became a bencher of his inn in November that year. Four years later he was appointed solicitor-general to Queen Adelaide, retaining that post until May 1832.<h2>
<a name="Theunobtrusivepolitician"></a>The unobtrusive politician</h2>Whiggism was in Pepys's blood; his maternal grandfather had been the chancellor of the exchequer in the Rockingham administration in 1765. Though he had shown little political ambition, in July 1831 he entered the House of Commons as the member for Higham Ferrers, a seat which he exchanged the following September for Lord Fitzwilliam's borough of Malton. In the house he rarely spoke, and then on purely legal questions; his first speech, on 31 October 1831, was on the <span class="roman">Bankruptcy Bill</span>. The whigs had a paucity of lawyers in the house, and their predicament became acute when Sir William Horne, who had become attorney-general on Sir Thomas Denman's appointment as lord chief justice in November 1832, proved to be a disastrous choice. In 1834 he was pushed out of office. Campbell succeeded him and, to the surprise of the profession, Pepys became solicitor-general on 22 February 1834, receiving the customary knighthood. As solicitor-general Pepys was not active in the house. He piloted the bill to establish the central criminal court and spoke in favour of the new <span class="roman">Poor Law Bill</span>. But he had no taste for debate and his most successful intervention was his speech moving the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the law of libel.<br>
<br>In September 1834 the master of the rolls, Sir John Leach, suddenly died. Campbell, to his mortification, was passed over in favour of Pepys who, at the instigation of Brougham (whom Pepys had impressed), became master of the rolls on 29 September and a privy councillor a few days later. Brougham wrote that Pepys's elevation &#145;was his own best title to the gratitude of the profession&#146;  (Brougham, 3.430).<h2>
<a name="Lordchancellor"></a>Lord chancellor</h2>The whigs returned to office in April 1835. The prime minister, Melbourne, resolved that Brougham should never again be his lord chancellor. The great seal was put into commission while the cabinet wrangled over an alternative to Brougham. The contest was between Henry Bickersteth and Pepys. On 17 January 1836 Pepys became lord chancellor of England, taking the title Baron Cottenham of Cottenham in the county of Cambridge. Greville described the promotion of this &#145;plain undistinguished man&#146; as &#145;one of the most curious instances of elevation that ever occurred&#146;  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 3.328). Pemberton Leigh, later Lord Kingsdown, recorded the comment that: &#145;Melbourne must have felt very much like a man who had parted with a brilliant capricious mistress and married his housekeeper&#146;  (Leigh, <span class="italic">Recollections</span>, 112; <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, 60). In 1841 the whigs were turned out of office. On their return in 1846 Cottenham became lord chancellor for the second time, again succeeding Lyndhurst.<br>
<br>Cottenham was unashamedly a party man, whose preference for whigs in his patronage appointments to the commissions of the peace and to the trusteeships of municipal charities infuriated the tories. But he failed his party in the Lords, as he had done in the Commons. A feeble debater, he was no match for Lyndhurst or Brougham. But Atlay thought that he &#145;was a much more useful member of the Cabinet than was generally suspected&#146;  (Atlay, 1.404), a judgement which Lord John Russell appeared to endorse, describing him as &#145;a direct man and a straightforward statesman&#146;  (Russell, 276).<h2>
<a name="Amutedlawreformer"></a>A muted law reformer</h2>On 28 April 1836 Cottenham introduced a bill for dividing and distributing the duties performed by the lord chancellor. The bill left the jurisdiction and procedure of the court of chancery untouched, although the equity business of the court of exchequer was transferred to it. Its head was to be a permanent judge, the lord chief justice of the court of chancery, who was to devote himself solely to judicial business. The office of lord chancellor was to remain. Its holder would keep the great seal and its traditional patronage, and preside over the House of Lords and the hearing of appeals to the House of Lords and the privy council.<br>
<br>It was predictable that the bill would be opposed by Lyndhurst, who depicted Cottenham's chancellor as a lawyer without a court. More disconcerting was the opposition of Bickersteth, now Lord Langdale and Cottenham's successor as master of the rolls, who strongly disapproved of its main provisions. Cottenham's defence of the bill was, in Campbell's words, &#145;tame, confused, and dissuasive&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of John, Lord Campbell</span>, 2.82). The bill was handsomely defeated and with its defeat died any further attempt by Cottenham radically to reform the court of chancery.<br>
<br>The fifty-one new orders in chancery in 1841, although making detailed reforms, were quite inadequate attempts to remedy the defects of equity procedure. Equally unsuccessful was Cottenham's attempt to implement the recommendations of the commission of inquiry into the bankruptcy and insolvency laws. But he did have some minor successes. For example, in 1838 he secured the enactment of a statute abolishing imprisonment for debt on mesne process; thereafter a person could not be arrested on the mere affidavit of another that he was owed &pound;20. In 1841 the statute which had prohibited the clergy from all dealings in trade was repealed; the earlier statute had been interpreted to mean that if a clergyman was a shareholder in a joint-stock company, the company was an illegal association and could not recover moneys due to it. And an act of 1847 enabled trustees who wished to be relieved of the responsibility of administering the trust to pay trust money into court.<h2>
<a name="Cottenhamasjudge"></a>Cottenham as judge</h2>Cottenham will not be remembered as a politician or as a law reformer. But as a judge he earned the praise, though not the love, of his contemporaries. Kingsdown said that he was &#145;one of the best judges I ever saw on the Bench&#146;  (Atlay, 1.402). Cottenham did not have Lyndhurst's brilliance of mind but his knowledge of equity was more profound. Among his decisions are <i>Tulk v. Moxhay</i> (1848), the corner-stone of the law of restrictive covenants, and <i>Saunders v. Vautier</i> (1841), which holds that all the beneficiaries of a trust, if of full age, may, if they so decide, determine the trust. The growth of the joint-stock company led to much litigation. Cottenham's decisions laid the foundations of modern company law. Prominent among them is <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i> (1843), which established that only the company, and not individual shareholders, can seek redress for the illegal acts of its directors.<br>
<br>Cottenham's judgments, which were meticulously prepared, are a model of what judgments should be. According to Le Marchant:<blockquote>The style of them, like the character of the man, was perfectly free from all affectation and display; whether written or spoken, they were always simple, terse and perspicuous; clear and condensed in their summary of the facts, and in their exposition of law, comprehensive and vigorous, but at the same time, cautious and precise. (Le Marchant, 64)</blockquote>Cottenham, unlike Eldon, made up his mind quickly and once made it was a Herculean task to persuade him to change it. &#145;His demeanour in Court was not without a certain dignity, but its prominent feature was an austerity, amounting sometimes to harshness, which maintained his authority rather than conciliated esteem&#146;  (ibid., 64). Impatient of empty and repetitious rhetoric, he listened patiently to cogent argument, rarely interrupting &#145;except for the purpose of bringing it to an issue, by showing that he had detected its weak point&#146;  (ibid., 65). However, during his second chancellorship he became increasingly inaudible, irritable, and intolerant.<br>
<br>Cottenham's relationship with his judicial colleagues was an uneasy one. Langdale's attack on his attempt to reform the court of chancery made a cool relationship even cooler. His dislike of the vice-chancellor, Sir James Knight Bruce, was long-standing. According to Lord Selborne, its source was their rivalry in Vice-Chancellor Shadwell's court, &#145;when that great lawyer, plain and dull of speech, had to endure what he regarded as daily affronts from his eloquent competitor&#146;  (Palmer, 1.375). Cottenham would not permit any deviation from the traditional practice of the court, even upholding one of the greater abuses of the master's office, &#145;hourly warrants&#146;, by which a fresh fee was payable every hour. In contrast, Knight Bruce was of a very different temper and had been allowed by an indulgent Lyndhurst to take procedural short cuts, freely granting amendments at the hearing of a cause. This practice infuriated Cottenham, who considered &#145;the system which he [had] to administer as the perfection of human wisdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of John, Lord Campbell</span>, 2.207), and led to many bitter exchanges at the expense of hapless litigants. Knight Bruce was convinced that Cottenham approached his judgments with &#145;a disposition to reverse them&#146;  (Palmer, 1.375). Cottenham was on no better terms with the other vice-chancellor, Sir James Wigram.<br>
<br>To his contemporaries Cottenham was a man conscious of his dignity, touchy, aloof, self-centred. But he was a loving husband and devoted to his fifteen children, twelve of whom survived him. Unlike his father he had no interest in literature. His conversation with his few intimates, &#145;often enlivened by a vein of dry humour&#146;, was &#145;on the topics of the day&#146;  (Le Marchant, 67). Cottenham cared little for society. He was a private man.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>During his second chancellorship, which began in 1846 and lasted almost four years, Cottenham's powers deteriorated. The burdens of office, combined with his conscientious devotion to his judicial duties, led to longer and longer delays in giving judgments, standing important cases over to the long vacation, and issuing &#145;directions for enquiries&#146; to the masters for further investigation of the facts. The arrears of the court built up. In November 1847 Cottenham broke a blood-vessel in his throat, and was thought to be dying. But in the new year he was back in the house and in court, though seldom appearing in the cabinet. A personal attack by a disgruntled attorney, William Dimes, clouded his last years. Dimes had unsuccessfully brought suit against the Grand Junction Canal and had been committed by Cottenham for contempt for breach of an injunction. Dimes was a determined man and in 1849 brought an action to set aside Cottenham's judgment on the ground that Cottenham, a shareholder in the company, had an interest in the outcome of the proceedings. In June 1852 the House of Lords upheld that claim.<br>
<br>In the year following Dimes's action Cottenham was absent from court more frequently. On 27 May 1850 he abruptly resigned, to be granted in the following month the titles of Viscount Crowhurst and earl of Cottenham; in 1845 and 1849 he had succeeded to the baronetcies held by his older brother and uncle. He was advised to winter abroad and, in the spring of 1851, felt well enough to return home from Malta. But in Pietra Santa, near Lucca, in Italy, he was taken ill; he died on his seventieth birthday, 29 April 1851, and was buried in Totteridge in Hertfordshire.<br>
