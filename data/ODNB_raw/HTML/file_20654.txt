<span class="headword">O'Kane,  Eachmarcach</span>  (1720&#150;1790), <span class="occ">harpist</span>, was born at Drogheda in 1720. He was of a northern family, and was taught to play the harp by Cornelius Lyons, harper to the earl of Antrim. Described as a very tall, strong, and athletic man, O'Kane's famed spirit of adventure sent him to Rome, where he played for the exiled Charles Edward Stuart, the Young Pretender. After visiting France he went on to Madrid, where a great number of Irish gentlemen living at the court praised him to the king. However, O'Kane achieved notoriety for his drunken and uproarious habits, and lost favour in the Spanish court. From Madrid he apparently walked to Bilbao, carrying his harp on his back. He did not seem to spend much time in Ireland, instead touring around Scotland, where he played mainly in Blair Atholl, Dunkeld, and the lowlands and isles. In 1775 Sir Alexander MacDonald in Skye gave him a silver harp key, long in the family, and originally left by another Irish harper, Ruaidhri Dall O'Cathain, or O'Kane. Boswell, in his <span class="italic">Tour to the Hebrides</span>, recounts the tale that O'Kane begged to have the harp key on the basis of his being a namesake of its donor, and that the MacDonald family agreed, being unaware of its true value. Arthur O'Neill, in his famous memoirs, describes how O'Kane sold the key and drank the money, leaving the MacDonalds to rue their loss. Of his musical ability, a contemporary (a Mr Dunn) states that &#145;he was &hellip; able (though blind) to play with accuracy and great effect the fine treble and bass parts of many of Corelli's correntos in concert with other music&#146;; this may have taken place at the series of concerts which Castrucci (Corelli's last pupil) organized in Dublin. O'Kane apparently died in 1790.<br>
