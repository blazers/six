<span class="headword">Bowman, Sir  James</span>, first baronet  (1898&#150;1978), <span class="occ">trade unionist and industrial administrator</span>, was born at Great Corby, near Carlisle, Cumberland, on 8 March 1898, the fifth of the seven children of Robert James Bowman (1861&#150;1948), blacksmith, and his wife, Mary Murray (1865&#150;1941). On leaving school, Bowman was presented with a watch inscribed &#145;for being never late and never absent&#146;. At the age of fifteen he started work at Ashington colliery. In the war of 1914&#150;18 he served in the Royal Marines. On returning to Ashington &#145;big pit&#146;, where he was a coal filler, he showed an active interest in trade unionism and became the first full-time official at the pit. On 10 March 1923 he married Jean, daughter of Henry Brooks, a miner, of Ashington, Northumberland.<br>
<br>Bowman's years of active lodge membership gave him a keen understanding of the working miner and fostered his gift for exposition and advocacy. He gained respect for his moderate views combined with a certain toughness. In 1935 he was elected general secretary of the Northumberland Miners' Association. He reached national level within the union in 1936, when he was elected to the executive committee of the Mineworkers' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB). In 1939 he was elected vice-president of the MFGB and he was re-elected, unopposed, until his resignation in 1949. Throughout the 1940s Bowman shared power within the MFGB with William Lawther, president, and Arthur Horner, general secretary. He played a major part in merging the federation, with its deep historical and traditional roots in the district unions, into the National Union of Mineworkers. He successfully urged a more cautious, step-by-step approach to reorganization than was demanded by the Yorkshire miners  (Arnot, 422).<br>
<br>In the period immediately after the Second World War Bowman was invited by Sir Stafford Cripps to advise on the reorganization of the German trade unions. In 1946 he was elected to the general council of the TUC and was appointed to serve on its international, economic, education, disputes, and organization committees. In 1947&#150;9 he was a member of the royal commission on the press and in May 1949 became a member of the committee on broadcasting chaired by Lord Beveridge. In January 1950, having resigned his former posts, he was appointed chairman of the Northern Division (Northumberland and Cumberland) of the National Coal Board (NCB) at the instigation of Hugh Gaitskell, then minister of fuel and power. Bowman had no doubts about the move; he believed passionately in nationalization, which he saw as the means to a more efficiently managed industry which would bring increased prosperity and security to those employed within it.<br>
<br>In 1955 Bowman was appointed deputy chairman of the NCB and in 1956, on the death of his predecessor, Sir Hubert Houldsworth, he was appointed chairman. He inherited a revised organization, following the acceptance by the board of the report of a committee chaired by Alexander Fleck, which had recommended a strengthening of functional departments and of the central authority of the board. As chairman he dealt mostly with general matters of policy and left supervision of the board's day-to-day business to the deputy chairman, Joseph Latham. An exception was Bowman's use of his trade union connections to maintain good industrial relations. He supported the introduction of new techniques, such as method study, and did much to secure increased mechanization of production methods. This was undoubtedly his most valuable and enduring legacy to the industry.<br>
<br>In 1957 the board faced a crisis as, with increased use of oil, the market for coal declined rapidly. Over the next three years 124 pits were closed and the number of industrial employees was reduced from 710,000 to 583,000. Although open-cast production was almost halved, undistributed coal stocks rose to 36 million tons. There was much criticism of the NCB during this difficult period. Bowman robustly answered it in a long article in <span class="italic">The Times</span> (11 December 1958). He pointed out that &#145;the Board did not aim during the years of scarcity to make the high level of profits which would certainly have been reasonable&#146;. There should be more understanding of the industry's position when the market changed. It was a tribute to Bowman's skill and his understanding of the mining community that, despite the criticism, these policies were effected without opposing industrial action. Meanwhile the pace of mechanization was maintained, with output per man-shift reaching a new record level.<br>
<br>On the expiry of his term of office in 1961 Bowman decided to retire because of ill health. He and his wife returned to Newcastle, which they had always regarded as home. He was succeeded, as chairman of the NCB, by Alfred Robens. In the final annual report of his five years as chairman tribute was paid to him: &#145;his tenure of office included some of the most difficult years since the industry was nationalised and his resolution and clear vision were an inspiration to everyone in the industry&#146;  (NCB annual report, 1960, iv).<br>
<br>Bowman was a powerfully built man of medium height, whose confident physical presence, recalling his early career as a miner, was allied to an ease of manner which enabled him to deal with equal success with trade unionists, mining engineers, civil servants, and politicians. He possessed an outgoing personality which was demonstrated in his strength as a public speaker, whether delivering a prepared set-piece or an impromptu tribute, and in his skill as a raconteur, where he was helped by an accent which retained attractive traces of his Cumbrian origin and Northumbrian upbringing.<br>
<br>Bowman was made a JP in 1935. He was appointed CBE in 1952 and knighted in 1957. In January 1961 he was created a baronet. In October 1958 he was made an honorary DCL of Durham University. Bowman died on 25 September 1978 at his home, Woodlands, Killingworth Drive, West Moor, Newcastle upon Tyne. He had one son, George (1923&#150;1990), who succeeded to the baronetcy, and one daughter.<br>
