<span class="headword">Scheerre <span class="st"> [Scheere, Skereueyn]</span>,  Herman</span> <span class="st"> [Herman of Cologne]</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1388&#150;<em>c.</em>1422), <span class="occ">manuscript artist</span>, was an illuminator of German or Flemish origin who worked in London <i>c</i>.1405&#150;<i>c</i>.1422. He is probably to be identified with the illuminator Herman of Cologne whose name occurs in the household accounts of Duke William of Gueldres about 1388&#150;9, and who was working for Philip the Bold, duke of Burgundy, in Dijon in 1401&#150;3. His name, in the various forms of Hermannus Scheere, Herman Skereueyn, or Herman, occurs in connection with the rent of a shop in Paternoster Row, London, some time before 1410, and as witness to two wills of Cologne men in London in 1407; it also appears in three illuminated manuscripts of London provenance from the period <i>c</i>.1405&#150;1422 (offices and prayers, BL, Add. MS 16998; the Bedford hours and psalter, BL, Add. MS 42131; the Chichele breviary, London, Lambeth Palace Library, MS 69). The illuminator has also been identified with the Herman of Cologne who was working in Paris for the French queen, Isabel of Bavaria, in 1419. Various manuscripts not signed with his name have been attributed to the artist both on grounds of style and from the occurrence of a motto in the decoration <i>Si quis amat non laborat</i> (&#145;He who loves does not labour&#146;). There is controversy over both the dating and the amount of illumination of these books which can be attributed to Scheerre and it has recently been suggested by Kathleen Scott that the motto was also used by his workshop and does not always imply his personal involvement.<br>
<br>If Herman Scheerre is indeed identical with Herman of Cologne, there is very little in his art which derives from Cologne painting, except perhaps some iconographic features. Closer parallels with his style of painting and iconographic types can be found in the work of illuminators of Bruges and Ypres. If Scheerre did originate from Cologne it seems his art was formulated mainly within a Flemish context, perhaps at Dijon when he was working for the duke of Burgundy in 1401&#150;2. He came to England <i>c</i>.1405 and remained there until at least 1419, perhaps as late as 1422. While in England he collaborated with other illuminators in London, particularly the leading figure Magister Johannes who, like Scheerre, seems to have been a foreigner, perhaps of Flemish origin. Scott has attempted to analyse more precisely the relative contributions of these two artists, and of the other artists employed in their workshops, in the approximately twenty books illuminated in their styles. The main books whose decoration is mostly by Scheerre himself are: the <i>c</i>.1405 book of hours (CUL, MS Ee.1.14); the book of offices and prayers of about 1405 to 1410 (BL, Add. MS 16998); the Nevill hours of about 1405&#150;10 (Berkeley Castle, trustees of the late earl of Berkeley); the <i>c</i>.1410 book of hours (Bodl. Oxf., MS Gough liturg. 6); the breviary done for Henry Chichele, perhaps when bishop of St David's (1408&#150;14), before he became archbishop of Canterbury in 1414 (London, Lambeth Palace Library, MS 69); the prayer book of Charles, duke of Orl&eacute;ans (who was imprisoned in London), perhaps of about 1415&#150;17 (Paris, Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, MS Lat. 1196); and, finally, the book of hours and psalter of John, duke of Bedford (BL, Add. MS 42131). His authorship of the annunciation with two donors of an unknown family, in the <i>c</i>.1410 Beaufort&#150;Beauchamp hours (BL, Royal MS 2 A.xviii, fol. 23<i>v</i>), is not accepted by all.<br>
<br>Herman Scheerre and Johannes were the leading illuminators of early fifteenth-century England and Scheerre's iconographic compositions and ornamental decoration continued to influence English artists up to the 1440s.<br>
