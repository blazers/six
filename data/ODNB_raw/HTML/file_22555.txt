<span class="headword">Portal, Sir  Gerald Herbert</span>  (1858&#150;1894), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35577/', "Melville Portal (1819&#150;1904)")</script> of Laverstoke, Hampshire, and Lady Charlotte Mary Elliot (<i>d</i>. 1899), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8662/', "Gilbert Elliot Murray Kynynmound, second earl of Minto")</script>, was born at Laverstoke on 13 March 1858, and educated at Eton College, where he played in the school cricket team. He entered the diplomatic service on 12 July 1879 and after the usual period of probation in the Foreign Office was sent to Rome on 29 July 1880. He became third secretary of legation on 22 July 1881.<br>
<br>In June 1882 Portal had the good fortune to be temporarily attached to the consulate-general at Cairo at a critical period in the history of British relations with Egypt. He was present at the bombardment of Alexandria, and for his services on that occasion received a medal with clasp and the khedive's star. He became a favourite with Sir Evelyn Baring (afterwards Lord Cromer), the British representative, and in April 1884 was confirmed as third secretary at Cairo. On 1 April 1885 he was promoted second secretary. For some weeks in the summers of 1886 and 1887 he took charge of the residency during Cromer's absence, and conducted its affairs with credit.<br>
<br>On 17 October 1887 Portal was ordered to attempt a reconciliation between the king of Abyssinia and the Italian government. On 21 October he left for Massawa. To succeed in such a mission was almost impossible, but he made every effort, and showed rare judgement and coolness in travelling through a disturbed country. He returned on 31 December, unsuccessful, but with a considerably enhanced reputation. He was made CB, and gave an account of the expedition in <span class="italic">My Mission to Abyssinia</span> (1888).<br>
<br>Returning to his duties at the Cairo agency, Portal was charg&eacute; d'affaires in the autumn of 1888. From 30 April to 14 November 1889 he acted as consul-general at Zanzibar, and on 10 March 1891 was permanently appointed to the agency there, under the scheme of the British protectorate, which was then inaugurated. To these duties he added those of consul-general for German East Africa on 2 June 1891, and for the British sphere in east Africa on 11 February 1892. He vigorously entered upon the duties of his new post, and reformed the administration. He was made KCMG on 4 August 1892. On 1 February 1890 he married Lady Alice Jos&eacute;phine, daughter of Montagu Arthur Bertie, seventh earl of Abingdon, and his first wife, Caroline Theresa (<i>d</i>. 1873). They had no children.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1892 the future of Uganda (its chartered company being effectively bankrupt) became the subject of an intense row within Gladstone's cabinet, with the Foreign Office mounting an energetic campaign for the annexation of Uganda. A compromise was reached, whereby Portal was requested to report on whether the country should remain under British control. Appointed commissioner for Uganda on 1 December, Portal toured the country, with his brother Captain Melville Raymond Portal (<i>b</i>. 1856) as chief military officer; his brother died on the journey, on 27 May 1893. Portal reached the coast again on 21 October 1893 and reached London in November. Strongly though covertly encouraged by Lord Rosebery, the foreign secretary, Portal, in his report, completed in December 1893, recommended against British evacuation, though drawing attention to the difficulties of settling Uganda. His report was less enthusiastic than Rosebery had hoped, and it may be that the latter rewrote parts of it; he certainly delayed its circulation. Portal was writing his account of his journey when he died, on 25 January 1894, at his home, 5B Mount Street, Grosvenor Square, London, of fever contracted in Uganda. His book, <span class="italic">The British Mission to Uganda</span>, was published posthumously later that year. Rosebery declared Uganda a protectorate in June 1894. Portal was handsome and athletic, and was a skilled publicist, adept at leaking news to the papers. The town of Fort Portal in western Uganda is named after him. In October 1897, his widow married Commandant Reynteins of Belgium; the couple had several children.<br>
