<span class="headword">Pygott,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1549), <span class="occ">composer and church musician</span>, is of unknown parentage and background. He spent more than thirty years in two of the foremost choral foundations of early Tudor England, first as master of Cardinal Wolsey's household chapel choir and later as a gentleman of Henry VIII's royal household chapel. He was in Wolsey's employment by January 1517, when a royal pardon for unauthorized possession of a crossbow and handgun describes him as a servant of the cardinal of York living in Westminster. His position in the household is not specified; presumably he was either a singer in the choir or already its director; an inventory of Wolsey's goods compiled during the 1520s mentions &#145;a fedderbedde bought for Pygoote maister of the children&#146; in December 1517. Wolsey's choir so prospered under Pygott's direction that it aroused the king's envy. In March 1518 Henry's secretary Richard Pace wrote requisitioning one of Wolsey's choristers on the grounds that the cardinal's choir was better than the king's. Shortly afterwards Pace thanked Wolsey for the chorister and remarked that &#145;Cornyshe [the master of the king's chapel] doies gretly laude &amp; prayse the chylde &hellip; and doies in lyke maner extolle mr pygote for the techynge of hym&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/16, fol. 206<i>v</i>). Pygott continued to direct the choir until it was disbanded on Wolsey's death in 1530; he and the singers accompanied their master on embassies to France in 1521 and 1527, and must also have been among his retinue at the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520.<br>
<br>Pygott's work with Wolsey's choir must have recommended him to the king; after the cardinal's demise he seems quickly to have found employment as a gentleman or singer in the royal household chapel. He first appears in this guise in an undated wages list assignable to about 1533&#150;4, but he may have been appointed earlier: in October 1532 he received a corrody in Coggeshall Priory surrendered by another gentleman, and in April 1533 he obtained a canonry in the collegiate church of St Editha at Tamworth, whose prebends were habitually awarded to members of the king's chapel. Other grants during the 1530s and 1540s show that he continued to enjoy royal favour.<br>
<br>By 1545 Pygott may have been contemplating retirement: in November the cathedral authorities at Wells were instructed to allow him to reside upon his prebend there, and in the lay subsidy roll of April 1546 the &pound;40 on which he was assessed is for the first time described as &#145;lands&#146; rather than &#145;fee&#146;. He seems, however, to have carried on living in London. His very informative will, dated 24 August 1549, details money gifts amounting to more than &pound;120 (including a legacy of &pound;2 to Thomas Tallis) and bequests of horses, clothes, and jewels. On 2 October he added a codicil mentioning &#145;the time of my sickness&#146;, and by 12 November, when the will was proved, he had died; payments to him from the court of augmentations ceased after November 1549. Thus he cannot be the Richard Pigot or Pigott to whom Princess Elizabeth made payments in December 1551 and January 1552.<br>
<br>Pygott's few extant compositions, most of which lack one or more voice parts, are polished, imaginative, and virtuosic enough to test even the first-rate choirs with which he worked. They include a <span class="italic">Missa veni sancte spiritus</span> for Whitsunday (one of the chief days in the royal court's liturgical calendar) and a huge and very elaborate setting of <span class="italic">Salve regina</span> (a Marian motive antiphon, used particularly during Lent). Single voices of several other works remain, among them an antiphon <span class="italic">Gaude pastore</span> to St Thomas of Canterbury, probably intended as a compliment to Wolsey. The only composition to survive complete is a devotional partsong <span class="italic">Quid petis O fili</span>, which continues a tradition established during Henry VII's reign. In <span class="italic">A Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke</span> (1597) Thomas Morley lists Pygott among the &#145;practicioners&#146; consulted, and prints an extract from an unidentified composition by him.<br>
