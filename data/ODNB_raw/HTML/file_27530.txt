<span class="headword">Tomson,  Laurence</span>  (1539&#150;1608), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was born in Northamptonshire. In 1553 he entered Magdalen College, Oxford; he graduated BA six years later. He was subsequently elected a fellow of the college and proceeded MA in 1564. The college granted him permission to pursue his studies abroad, and in May 1565 Tomson left Oxford to begin his travels in Europe. He may well have spent time studying in Geneva before joining the embassy of Sir Thomas Hoby dispatched in March 1566 to France, where presumably he remained until the ambassador's death in July. From France, Tomson travelled to Germany, and matriculated at the University of Heidelberg in March 1568. Aside from the fact that he resigned his fellowship from Magdalen in 1569, little is certainly known of his movements over the next three years. However, the epitaph on Tomson's monument at Chertsey in Surrey states that he also journeyed to Russia, Sweden, Denmark, and Italy. By November 1572 he was living under the protection of the puritan earl of Huntingdon in Leicester.<br>
<br>It is hardly surprising that Tomson, well educated, cosmopolitan, and with a command of twelve languages, soon found his way into the service of Sir Francis Walsingham. Probably early in 1575 he was appointed Walsingham's secretary, in which capacity he was to serve for the next fifteen years. He accompanied the minister and William Broke, tenth Lord Cobham, to the Netherlands in June 1578. His role in this embassy was solely secretarial and indeed he never received an ambassadorial appointment. Nevertheless he was actively involved in England's foreign affairs. As well as drafting foreign correspondence for Walsingham, he wrote a Latin treatise, presumably for his master, on the history of the trading disputes that existed between the Merchant Adventurers and the Hanseatic League, and in 1580 travelled to Boulogne to interview a papal agent regarding the activities of Esm&eacute; Stewart, duke of Lennox, in Scotland. In addition to his work as Walsingham's secretary and agent Tomson sat in parliament, first as MP for Melcombe Regis between 1578 and 1587, and latterly as the representative for Downton between 1588 and 1590. Upon Walsingham's death in 1590 he withdrew from public life to Laleham in Middlesex, where he died on 4 April 1608. He was survived by his wife, Jane, whom he had married before October 1579.<br>
<br>Tomson, whether scholar, civil servant, or politician, consistently displayed throughout his life a deep interest in and commitment to the puritan religion. It is likely that Laurence Humphrey, president of Magdalen and a well-known puritan himself, may have helped to shape the younger man's religious sympathies. In addition to Humphrey, Tomson's correspondents in the years after he left Oxford included the outspoken puritan leader Anthony Gilby; his name has also been associated with other dissidents, including Francis Hastings and Thomas Cartwright. In tandem with William Davison, Elizabeth's resident ambassador in the Low Countries, he supported Walter Travers, a puritan chaplain to the Merchant Adventurers, when the company sought to depose him. Before Davison returned to England in May 1579, Tomson gave him further help by supplying him with the names of two puritan ministers, whom he believed might be suitable to serve the English congregation in Antwerp. Among his activities as an MP Tomson sat on the committee appointed in 1584 to examine the quality of ministers chosen by John Whitgift and to consider the petitions of those so far excluded by the archbishop. The following year he attended a further committee concerned with revising the bill for the introduction of the Geneva prayer book. He also devoted considerable time to the translation of theological works. Best known are his translation from Latin of Beza's 1576 <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and his English translation, <span class="italic">The Sermons of Calvin on St Paul's Epistles to Timothie and Titus</span>. Yet for all Tomson's commitment to the puritan faith he was, to paraphrase Backus, more of a moderator than a pioneer. Although he possessed vociferous puritan friends, sat on government committees dealing with contentious religious issues, and translated other people's theological commentaries, it would seem that his considerable intelligence was equalled by his sense of caution.<br>
