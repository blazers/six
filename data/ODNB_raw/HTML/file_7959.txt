<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dowdeswell,  William</span>  (1721&#150;1775), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 12 March 1721, the first surviving son of William Dowdeswell (1682&#150;1728), landowner and politician, and his second wife, Amy Hammond (<i>d</i>. in or after 1728), daughter of Anthony Hammond of Somersham, Huntingdonshire. The Dowdeswell family had been settled at Bushley, near Tewkesbury, on the Gloucestershire and Worcestershire border, since Elizabethan times and purchased Pull Court in 1628. They amassed considerable property locally, giving them an important electoral interest in Tewkesbury, for which no fewer than nine Dowdeswells had sat since 1660, including William's father and grandfather. William inherited while a minor, following his father's early death on 5 September 1728.<h2>
<a name="Educationandentryintopolitics"></a>Education and entry into politics</h2>In 1730 Dowdeswell was sent to Westminster School, for which he developed a lasting affection that culminated in his position as a Busby trustee (1769&#150;75). He proceeded in 1737 to Christ Church, Oxford, where he contributed a set of Latin verses to the university collection of poems on the death of Queen Caroline in the following year. He does not appear to have taken an Oxford degree but in 1745 he went to the University of Leiden, where he associated, among others, with Charles Townshend, John Wilkes, Anthony Askew, and Alexander Carlyle. From the Netherlands he toured Italy, travelling through Sicily and Greece and returning to England by 1747. On 6 November 1747 he married Bridget (<i>d</i>. 1818), fifth and youngest daughter of Sir William Codrington, first baronet (<i>d</i>. 1738), of Dodington, Gloucestershire, and Elizabeth Bethell (<i>d</i>. 1761), and sister of Sir William Codrington, second baronet (1719&#150;1792). The couple had six sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7960/', "William Dowdeswell")</script>, army officer and art collector, and seven daughters, several of whom died young.<br>
<br>In 1747 Dowdeswell was returned as MP for Tewkesbury but he declined to stand for re-election in 1754, when certain constituents made their support conditional on a contribution of &pound;1500 towards the local roads. He resumed his parliamentary career in 1761 as MP for Worcestershire, which he represented until his death, and enjoyed great popularity as MP. In his early career he was often mistaken for a tory because he supported continued commemoration of Charles I's execution, but his politics were more complex. As a typical country gentleman he opposed government expenditure levels but he upset the tories with his comments during the proceedings on the Westminster election in 1751 and with his dislike of the militia. In December 1762 he voted against the peace preliminaries.<h2>
<a name="Oppositiontotheciderexcise"></a>Opposition to the cider excise</h2>Dowdeswell was catapulted to prominence by the cider tax controversy of 1763. Considerable resentment was provoked in the western counties when Sir Francis Dashwood's budget extended the excise duties to domestic cider in March 1763. James Harris, the parliamentary diarist, noted between 9 and 14 March that Dowdeswell &#145;was the chief opponent and had taken great pains&#146;, making &#145;by far the best figure on that side&#146;  (Harris) and unsuccessfully pressing a series of amendments. In the summer of 1763 Dowdeswell sought further support by composing <span class="italic">An Address to such of the Electors of Great Britain as are not Makers of Cyder and Perry</span>, in which he contended that this widening of an &#145;arbitrary&#146; excise system foreshadowed the eventual subjection of all freeborn Englishmen in a sinister Machiavellian &#145;plan for <i>power</i> not for revenue&#146;  (p. 8). He also supported the extra-parliamentary campaign to petition the legislature, instruct local MPs, and collect examples of excise grievances; he attended the Worcestershire county meeting on 29 August and guided discussions in the Tewkesbury common council on 13 September. On 18 November George Grenville, the new first lord of the Treasury, sought a compromise solution in discussions with Dowdeswell and other interested MPs but his apparent prevarication led Dowdeswell to conclude that the western members should seek a full repeal through their own efforts. On 24 January 1764, Harris records, Dowdeswell moved for a committee in a &#145;decent, temperate, and reasonable&#146; speech. On 31 January he:<blockquote>entered into a detail of the grievances of the excise laws upon ignorant countrymen, the enormity of the penalties, the trials without juries, the partiality of what he called revenue injustices, the dreaded consequences that were these laws extended commissioners of excise might nominate Members for the cider counties. (Harris)</blockquote>On 10 February he seconded an unsuccessful repeal motion, following which Grenville pushed through conciliatory modifications. Dowdeswell also voted against Grenville on Wilkes and general warrants but he supported the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span>. He criticized Grenville's spending plans in the budget debate on 27 March and was almost alone that day in warning prophetically against provoking the American colonies by new taxation.<h2>
<a name="Chancelloroftheexchequer"></a>Chancellor of the exchequer</h2>When Rockingham took office in July 1765 both Sir William Baker and Henry Seymour Conway declined the chancellorship of the exchequer. Rockingham therefore turned to Dowdeswell, who was sworn of the privy council on 10 July and accepted the exchequer three days later. The appointment surprised many contemporaries, since Dowdeswell had never sided unequivocally with the opposition, or belonged to the opposition Wildman's Club. However, his Commons performances had highlighted his self-made expertise on financial matters, his honest integrity, and his ability to deliver solid argument based on a clear command of the issues. Rockingham's desire to court popularity &#145;out of doors&#146; neatly complemented Dowdeswell's hostility towards the cider excise. Dowdeswell himself was under few illusions: &#145;I am called to the office I hold&#146;, he observed on 24 July:<blockquote>only because I am supposed to have some talents in the execution of it. In the business of that office I shall set myself down. If either inability, or the disposition of the times shall put me out of power to do good, I know what I then have to do. (Buccleuch MSS)</blockquote>On 17 September he still adhered to the outdated &#145;country&#146; belief that &#145;every man in office or out of it may vote with his opinion&#146;  (Dowdeswell MSS). By 12 October George Onslow was enthusiastically forecasting that &#145;he will be our great stay&#146; on the Treasury bench  (West MSS), and he was soon playing a major and respected role in all government business, particularly commercial affairs.<br>
<br>Though not formally a member of cabinet Dowdeswell was in regular attendance and Rockingham, who soon recognized the value of consulting him, invited him to many of the dinners at which public affairs were discussed. Dowdeswell assisted Conway in conducting the business of the house and, when the latter was taken gravely ill during March and April 1766, he led the government in the Commons. He was present at the crucial meetings on 19 and 21 January 1766 to discuss the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> repeal. His silence in the great debate of 21&#150;22 February gave Harris the impression that &#145;he was in his private sentiments rather for a modification than a repeal&#146;  (Harris) but on 24 February he spoke in favour of repeal. On 4 March he stressed the need for a declaratory act to prevent any impression that parliament had surrendered the right of taxation. Repeal of the 1763 cider duty was the predictable centrepiece of Dowdeswell's budget on 7 March, the removal of 103,000 private households from the excise administration being trumpeted as a restoration of liberty. The &#145;Apple Chancellor&#146;  (<span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span>, 8&#150;10 April 1766) now raised the existing retail cider duties by 6<i>s</i>. per hogshead and tightened legislation against fraud but provoked controversy with a new window tax. Such a record belies Horace Walpole's acid depiction of Dowdeswell as &#145;a duller version of Mr. Grenville, though without his malignity&#146;. He was allegedly:<blockquote>so suited to the drudgery of the office, as far as it depends on arithmetic, that he was fit for nothing else. Heavy, slow, methodical without clearness, a butt for ridicule, unversed in every graceful art, and a stranger to men and courts, he was only esteemed by the few to whom he was personally known. (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs &hellip; George III</span>, 2.219, 139)</blockquote>Equally cheap was Bishop Warburton's sarcastic observation of a visit from Lord Lyttelton to Dowdeswell: &#145;there &hellip; goes a man who cannot tell that two times two is four going to dine with a man who knows nothing else&#146;  (H. Thrale, <span class="italic">Thraliana</span>, ed. K. C. Balderston, 2 vols., 1942, 1.2).<h2>
<a name="RockinghamoppositionleaderintheCommons"></a>Rockingham opposition leader in the Commons</h2>When Chatham's administration was being formed in July 1766 Grafton, the new first lord of the Treasury, felt inclined to retain Dowdeswell at the exchequer &#145;for the general good, and very likely for my own private ease of mind&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of William Pitt</span>, 2.460). These prospects were ruined when Chatham learned from George III &#145;that Lord Rockingham's being quiet would much depend&#146; on such an arrangement and insisted on Dowdeswell's immediate dismissal  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of George III</span>, 1.380). Compensatory offers of a place as joint paymaster-general or first lord of trade followed but Dowdeswell refused them, to the surprise of many political commentators who were aware of his straitened financial circumstances. Burke later portrayed Dowdeswell's stance in terms of highly principled loyalty, in contrast to those careerists who abandoned Rockingham in order to remain in office, but the truth was more prosaic. In his last audience with the king, on 29 July 1766, Dowdeswell stressed his belief that he had discharged his office both to the royal satisfaction and &#145;with no small degree of public approbation&#146;, adding: &#145;It might be a misfortune sometimes to have been raised too high. Men could not after being much exalted stoop to certain offices, which they might have at first accepted&#146;  (Dowdeswell MSS). On 16 September 1766 Lord Harcourt recorded that Dowdeswell had returned to Worcestershire &#145;very much out of humour and indeed with reason after the treatment he has met with&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jenkinson Papers</span>, 430). Thereafter Dowdeswell distrusted Chatham and was drawn irrevocably towards Rockingham in a way that might not otherwise have occurred, becoming his close friend, faithful adviser, and trusted strategist. As the leader of the Rockingham group in the Commons his political life was thereafter essentially &#145;the history of the Rockingham party&#146;  (Brooke, &#145;Dowdeswell&#146;, 335). He was a conspicuous and respected figure in the house, preparing many of the key opposition motions and making some 500 speeches on all manner of subjects. Although these were generally dry, legalistic, and narrow his more flamboyant junior colleague Edmund Burke none the less wrote to Rockingham on 7 January 1773 that he was sure &#145;we cannot find a leader whom a man of honour and judgment would so soon choose to follow&#146;  (Rockingham MSS).<br>
<br>In February 1767 Dowdeswell sought to rally a confused and demoralized opposition by proposing a reduction in the land tax from 4<i>s</i>. to 3<i>s</i>. in the pound, arguing that &pound;1 million of debt could still be repaid. Critics noted that Dowdeswell had not acted in his own budget, but this opportunistic measure had a natural appeal for the independent country gentlemen and ensured successful <i>ad hoc</i> co-operation with the Bedfords and Grenvilles. Dowdeswell triumphantly carried the motion by 206 votes to 188 but Chatham's normal majority was not affected and in subsequent months Dowdeswell failed to exploit the ministry's divisions regarding the affairs of the East India Company. Renewed thoughts of a possible permanent opposition alliance none the less highlighted Dowdeswell's growing importance. On 8 July 1767 Rockingham urgently requested his presence &#145;because it is a very great ease and satisfaction to my own mind to have the assistance of your calm judgement within reach&#146;  (Rockingham MSS). Dowdeswell attended both of Rockingham's discussions with Bedford, on 20 and 21 July, about the outlines of a possible new administration but these reached deadlock over Rockingham's insistence on Conway as leader of the Commons. Bedford suggested Dowdeswell instead but the latter declined &#145;for many reasons which he then gave, and for many more which he kept in his own breast&#146;  (ibid.). Conway now invited the Rockinghams to join Chatham's administration, suggesting Dowdeswell as chancellor of the exchequer. The latter's memorandum of 23 and 24 July advised Rockingham to decline unless &#145;the King should send for him to give him powers from his own mouth without any of his ministers&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Dowdeswell's paper is a crucial summary of the principles that were subsequently to guide Rockingham. He attributed the current political instability to the court's malign use of secret influence, and insisted that only a broad and comprehensive ministry, dominated by a single party, could withstand this. Rockingham &#145;must consider himself as the former of an Administration and answerable for its success, and would therefore preserve in all offices of business a manifest superiority for his own friends&#146;  (Rockingham MSS). Gloomily Dowdeswell saw &#145;no fair prospect&#146; of forming such a grand coalition, in which case the wisest course of action was for the Rockinghams to &#145;finish with honour&#146;, &#145;to stand still and enjoy the reputation we have, not risk it for something new&#146;; maintaining their &#145;honour as individuals&#146; took precedence over any weakening as a party  (ibid.). This was a principled approach but Dowdeswell's implicit notion that Rockingham should himself make ministerial appointments would have severely curtailed the royal prerogative. The failure of the July 1767 negotiations condemned the Rockinghams to remain in opposition for the next fifteen years, although Dowdeswell's name was periodically mentioned in any speculations about ministerial changes.<h2>
<a name="AmericaandWilkes"></a>America and Wilkes</h2>On America, Dowdeswell displayed a pragmatic awareness of the colonies' great importance for British trade and manufactures, and in October 1766 he advised his successor, Charles Townshend, to help the East India Company to sell tea there and thereby reduce smuggling. On 17 May 1767 Dowdeswell none the less criticized the inadequacy of Townshend's proposals for coercive action against a recalcitrant New York and urged the quartering of soldiers in private houses. Despite this he became involved in a full-scale altercation with Grenville in late November 1767, when the latter attacked the apparent weakness of the Rockinghamite approach. On 14 August 1768 Dowdeswell sent Rockingham a lengthy appraisal of the American situation, apportioning blame for the Townshend duties crisis to Chatham's irresponsible &#145;folly&#146; in encouraging the colonists, their provocation by the &#145;obstinacy&#146; and &#145;threatening language&#146; of the Grenvilles, and Townshend's weak imposition of a &#145;foolish tax&#146; simply so that &#145;it might be collected in America&#146;  (Dowdeswell MSS). American opposition was now essentially to &#145;the general principle of raising <i>any</i> revenue in America&#146;, which constituted a clear challenge to parliamentary sovereignty: &#145;It must either be admitted, which is timidity, weakness, irresolution, and inconsistency; or it must be resisted, and the arms of this country must be exerted against her colonies&#146;  (ibid.). Only two courses of action were available:<blockquote>either, to fight to the last, in which case this country will be undone, or to treat with the contending party, depart from your own dignity, weaken your authority, and by giving up in time a part of your rights preserve the rest. (ibid.)</blockquote>Once British control was restored the offending duties should be repealed on grounds of economic distress to &#145;add good humour to submission&#146;  (ibid.). Parliament's right to taxation was not thereby denied but left in reserve for some future contingency when it might appear to both sides &#145;equitable as well as necessary to exert&#146;  (ibid.). &#145;Upon the whole&#146;, Dowdeswell argued, &#145;moderate measures are less dangerous, and if we come off at last with a loss those must answer for it who have wantonly and unnecessarily revived the question&#146;  (ibid.). His subsequent placatory approach was consistent with this honest and perceptive analysis; he argued on 8 November 1768 that the ministry should have come to the house before threatening to dissolve the colonial assemblies, and supported a call on 7 December for a general inquiry into the ministry's American decisions.<br>
<br>In 1769 Dowdeswell played a prominent role in debates on the Middlesex election controversy, pressing unsuccessfully on 5 February for a statement of the reasons for Wilkes's expulsion, questioning on 17 March whether it was prudent to have a Middlesex election every month, and seeking on 8 May to define the question as to whether Lutterell was duly elected. In early May he was involved in discussions with leaders in the City of London and attended a dinner at the Thatched House tavern to consider the petitioning movement. Dowdeswell's influence in Worcestershire, Herefordshire, and Gloucestershire was potentially important but he was sensitive to the need to proceed cautiously in a region where the gentry were suspicious of radicalism and repelled by Wilkes's dubious character. Although Dowdeswell subscribed to the eventual Gloucestershire petition and also signed in Wiltshire, his signature does not appear on the Herefordshire or Worcestershire documents and he did not even speak at a great meeting at Worcester Guildhall on 9 August. He composed a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Sentiments of an English Freeholder</span>, in which he argued for effective checks and balances to ensure ministerial accountability and to protect the freeholder's electoral property. He cautiously delayed publication until November 1769, pending scrutiny of the text by the lawyer Alexander Wedderburn.<br>
<br>The petitions were designed to bolster a renewed attack upon the ministry in January 1770. On 9 January Dowdeswell lamented what he perceived as a ubiquitous discontent, arguing that the petitions &#145;call loudly for the exertion of public virtue, to strike at the roots of that corruption, by which the State is reduced to the most deplorable conditions both at home and abroad&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 16, 1765&#150;71, 680). His subsequent motions were carefully crafted to cause embattled ministers the maximum difficulty. On 25 January his proposition that in election cases the house was bound to judge according to the law of the land was defeated by only 44 votes, by the device of a destructive amendment, and Grafton resigned the next day. On 31 January Dowdeswell's simple premise &#145;that, by the law of the land and usage of Parliament, no person, eligible by common right, can be incapacitated by vote or resolution of the House, but by Act of Parliament only&#146;  (ibid., 800) placed North in danger of immediate defeat but he circumvented it by resorting to a procedural motion to leave the chair.<h2>
<a name="Frustratedoppositionandillness"></a>Frustrated opposition and illness</h2>As North subsequently proceeded to strengthen his position Dowdeswell experienced endless and increasingly disheartening frustration. On 12 February 1770 his renewed proposal to disenfranchise the lower revenue officers, first attempted two years earlier, was defeated by 263 votes to 188. He also foreshadowed later economical reform by challenging ministers over the civil-list debt. During the following year he supported an abortive motion to repeal the American tea duty, criticized the government's handling of the Falkland Islands crisis, and defended the responsible reporting of parliamentary debates in the printers' case. When the lord mayor, Brass Crosby, and Alderman Richard Oliver were subsequently committed to the Tower Dowdeswell was among the leading whigs who visited them there. On 7 March 1771 his draft bill defining the role of juries in press libel cases was rejected. The vehement condemnation from Chatham, adamant on his own leadership on this issue, shattered any residual opposition unity, making Dowdeswell's task drearier still. On 2 April 1771, now deeply suspicious of any financial innovation, he castigated North's innocent <span class="roman">Lottery Bill</span> as &#145;an iniquitous project&#146; by which the crown might attack the independence of parliament  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 17, 1771&#150;4, 166). In March 1772 he led the opposition to the <span class="roman">Royal Marriage Bill</span> but declined to support moves to modify subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>. Faced with the futile prospect of a permanent, paralysed opposition Dowdeswell now supported Burke's idea of a partial secession from the Commons. However, during 1773 and 1774 he opposed government proposals concerning the East India Company, criticized both the <span class="roman">Boston Port Bill</span> and the <span class="roman">Massachusetts Bay Regulation Bill</span>, and again urged repeal of the tea duty. In what was to be his last major parliamentary utterance, on 19 April 1774, he accused ministers of &#145;struggling to obtain a most ridiculous superiority&#146; over the colonists  (ibid., 1198).<br>
<br>Dowdeswell's health now began to deteriorate, apparently from tuberculosis, and he wrote wearily to Rockingham on 8 June 1774: &#145;Impossibility of doing good in opposition and despair of being able to do it if we were again called into Administration, has long left me hopeless in politics&#146;  (Rockingham MSS). Seeking a cure he went to Bath and, later in the summer, he visited Bristol, but he burst a blood vessel. When the physicians recommended a change of climate he went to Nice, in November 1774, but he grew weaker and he died there on 6 February 1775. His body was brought back to England and buried in a vault in Bushley church on 9 April 1775. Shortly afterwards Bridget Dowdeswell asked Burke to compose the monumental inscription to her husband's memory that was erected at Bushley in 1777. Burke replied on 13 June 1775 with glowing affection, noting that in nine years of close political participation:<blockquote>we have scarcely ever had a difference in opinion &hellip; we never had a momentary coldness of affection; no disgust; no peevishness; no political or personal quarrels; no reconciliations. There never was a soul so remote as his from fraud, duplicity, or fear; so perfectly free from any of those little passions or from any of that capricious unevenness of temper which embitters friendships and perplexes business. (Dowdeswell MSS)</blockquote>Unsurprisingly Burke's lengthy epitaph was highly eulogistic, praising Dowdeswell's virtuous citizenship, financial knowledge, mastery of parliamentary procedure, and inflexible honesty in refusing all emoluments &#145;contrary to his engagements with his party&#146;  (Nash, 1.183). Dowdeswell's library was sold in 1775. Bridget Dowdeswell died at Sunbury, Middlesex, on 27 March 1818 and was placed in the same vault as her husband. Their sixth son, John Edmund Dowdeswell (1772&#150;1851), MP for Tewkesbury (1812&#150;32), who had a distinguished career as a master in chancery, wrote a manuscript memoir of his father's life, which was printed in John Wright's edition of Sir Henry Cavendish's debates.<br>
