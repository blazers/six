</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Caine, Sir  (Thomas Henry) Hall</span>  (1853&#150;1931), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 14 May 1853 at 130 Bridgewater Street, Runcorn, Cheshire, the eldest of the six children of John Caine (<i>bap</i>. 1821, <i>d</i>. 1904), blacksmith, and Sarah (1829&#150;1912), daughter of Ralph Hall of Liverpool and his wife, Mary. John Caine was born in the Isle of Man, and was working as a journeyman ship's smith in the Runcorn docks when his first child was born. Soon afterwards he took his family to the Toxteth area of Liverpool, where he lived for the rest of his life. Sarah Caine, a seamstress, was born in Whitehaven and went to Liverpool when her father, a stonemason, sought work there. Caine was educated at the Hope Street British Schools in Liverpool, becoming head boy in his final year. On leaving school in 1867, aged fourteen, with a talent for drawing, he was apprenticed to John Murray, an architect. He later maintained that he was an autodidact who owed his further education to the Liverpool Free Library, where he read voraciously. At the age of seventeen, after the death of his grandfather Ralph Hall in 1870, Caine suffered the first of the &#145;nervous collapses&#146; which were to plague him for most of his life. He threw up his apprenticeship and fled to the Isle of Man, where as a child he had spent holidays with his maternal grandmother. She had died in 1866, however, so he went to stay with his aunt Catherine Teare and her husband James, who was the schoolmaster at Maughold. He stayed for over a year, helping with the school and taking over at a salary of &pound;40 p.a. when his uncle died.<br>
<br>It was during this period that Caine encountered the writings of John Ruskin, who greatly influenced his political thinking. He returned to Liverpool and his architectural work in the spring of 1872, becoming an active member of the Ruskin Society. He later made Ruskin's acquaintance and visited him at Coniston. Caine also joined the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, where he met William Morris. He began to write regularly both for the Liverpool papers and for journals such as <span class="italic">The Builder</span>. As a theatre critic he met the actor Henry Irving. When Bram Stoker joined Irving as manager at the Lyceum Theatre, he and Caine became devoted friends. Stoker dedicated his vampire novel <span class="italic">Dracula</span> to Hall Caine, although the form, &#145;To Hommy-Beg&#146; (Manx for Little Tommy), kept it secret from the public for years.<br>
<br>Increasingly drawn to writing as a career, Caine resigned his job with John Murray and went to work for Bromleys, a firm of builders, as a draughtsman. At this time he helped to found the Liverpool Notes and Queries Society, which flourished. This and his journalistic work brought him to the notice of a number of influential people in Liverpool, and he began corresponding with several eminent literary men. A chance meeting on holiday in the Lake District introduced him to the poetry of Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Enthralled by Rossetti's work, he gave a lecture on it in January 1879, and when it was published he sent a copy to Rossetti, who replied in friendly manner. Much correspondence ensued before Caine was invited to Rossetti's Chelsea home in September 1880; in the following year he went to live there and remained until Rossetti's death in 1882. He idolized Rossetti and without doubt the poet was the most important influence on his life. Through Rossetti, Caine was introduced to the Pre-Raphaelite circle, and consequently to London literary and artistic society, making a number of good friends in the process, including Ford Madox Brown, William Sharp, Frederic Shields, and Theodore Watts (later Watts-Dunton), as well as Christina Rossetti.<br>
<br>In January 1882 Caine published an anthology, <span class="italic">Sonnets of Three Centuries</span>, and some months later produced <span class="italic">Recollections of Rossetti</span>, a tribute published in the same year. He remained in London, launched as an author and journalist. <span class="italic">Cobwebs of Criticism</span> appeared in 1883 and his first novel, <span class="italic">Shadow of a Crime</span>, in 1885, followed by <span class="italic">A Son of Hagar</span> (1886). He had hoped to be seen as a man of letters but the failure of his <span class="italic">Life of Coleridge</span> (1887) sent him back to fiction, and he produced his first commercial success with <span class="italic">The Deemster</span> (1887), a novel set on the Isle of Man in the eighteenth century, and centring on the redemption of a murderer condemned to exile in isolation for his crime. While the critics carped, Caine's readership grew, and the novel was adapted for the stage by Wilson Barrett as <span class="italic">Ben-my-chree</span>&#151;Manx for &#145;Girl of my heart&#146;.<br>
<br>In December 1882 Mary Alice Chandler (1869&#150;1932) went to live with him; she was thirteen, which was at that time the age of consent. Their elder son, Ralph, was born in Hampstead, London, in 1884 and they were married secretly in Edinburgh on 3 September 1886. The ceremony was the Scottish one, by declaration before witnesses. They were living in Bexleyheath, Kent, at the time; they moved to Keswick in Cumberland in 1888. A second son, Derwent, was born there in 1891.<br>
<br>For forty years Caine travelled widely, visiting the places where he was to set several of his romances, from Iceland to Egypt, London to Rome. In 1892 he went to Berlin and the Russian frontier on behalf of the London Russo-Jewish Committee to investigate Jewish persecution. In 1895 he made the first of many visits to the USA and also went to Canada, where he negotiated with the government on behalf of the Society of Authors and the Foreign Office over a new copyright law.<br>
<br>Caine continued to write, eventually producing fifteen romantic novels, and he became astonishingly popular and famous. He was a powerful story-teller, using his novels, mostly based on the eternal love triangle, to propound his political and social ideals. <span class="italic">The Bondman</span> (1890) launched the publishing firm of Heinemann. Set in the Isle of Man and Iceland, it was an involved story of love and revenge, and was adapted and staged at the Drury Lane Theatre, London, in 1906, with Mrs Patrick Campbell as Greeba; it was filmed by Herbert Wilcox in 1929. <span class="italic">The Manxman</span> (1894) was an immediate success, and is probably Caine's best-known book. It was dramatized in two forms, first by Wilson Barrett and later by the author himself. It was filmed by the London Film Company in 1916, and again, by Alfred Hitchcock, in 1929. In a letter to Caine, Edmund Gosse wrote that it was &#145;a contribution to literature and the most fastidious critic would give in exchange for it a wilderness of that deciduous trash which our publishers call fiction&#146;  (Hall Caine archive).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Christian</span> (1897) was the first novel in Britain to sell 1 million copies. The central characters of Glory Quayle and John Storm are among Caine's best creations, although his frank treatment of sexuality worried some readers and critics. The play was first staged in the USA, to great acclaim, but did less well in London. <span class="italic">The Eternal City</span> (1901), set in Rome, sold even better, and was dramatized twice, filmed in 1915, and remade in 1923. <span class="italic">The White Prophet</span> (1909), however, immersed Caine in political controversy, as it expressed sympathy with the position of the Egyptian nationalists. <span class="italic">The Woman thou Gavest me</span> (1913) retrieved his reputation while at the same time causing the biggest furore of any of his novels because of its open-minded treatment of marriage and divorce; it made a popular film after the First World War. It is clear that many of his novels were well-suited for dramatic and cinematic adaptation; their sometimes improbable plots none the less made for good drama, particularly when shorn of their didactic element. Caine himself also wrote a number of original stage plays and film scripts.<br>
<br>As a youth Caine was a communist but later became a Christian socialist. Votes for women, marriage law reform, and workers' rights were some of the causes he championed. A member of the House of Keys from 1901 to 1908, he advocated nationalization of the Isle of Man's trains, trams, and ferries as well as the land. He had long supported the Liberals in England, but declined an invitation from Lloyd George to stand for the Westminster parliament.<br>
<br>Caine had met the prince of Wales through Irving's Beefsteak Club and remained on friendly terms when the prince became Edward VII. In 1905 and 1908 he edited &#145;gift books&#146; for Queen Alexandra in aid of her charities but did not allow his name to appear other than as a contributor. In September 1914 he resumed his desk at the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> and wrote impassioned propaganda. He also edited <span class="italic">King Albert's Book</span> (Christmas 1914) to raise money for the <span class="italic">Telegraph's</span> Belgian fund, and a delighted King Albert created him an officer of the order of Leopold of Belgium. In 1918 the Belgian government presented him with his portrait painted by Alfred Jonniaux.<br>
<br>Caine returned to America in 1915 and 1916, speaking in the allied cause. In 1916 he joined Lord Robert Cecil at the Foreign Office to draft the document proposing a League of Nations after the war. The government invited him to write an epic propaganda film but the war ended before it was finished. In November 1917 he was offered a baronetcy but refused it, and soon afterwards he was made a KBE. Hating his forename, he insisted he should be known as Sir Hall, not Sir Thomas. Later he was made a Companion of Honour. His war work finished, he returned to fiction. <span class="italic">The Master of Man</span> (1921) was followed by <span class="italic">The Woman of Knockaloe</span> (1923), his last novel. Both were set in the Isle of Man, where he had made his home at Greeba Castle. For the centenary of Rossetti's birth he brought out a revised version of his <span class="italic">Recollections</span> (1928), dedicated to the memory of their friendship.<br>
<br>In appearance Caine was short, not more than 5 feet 4 inches tall, with red hair and beard and staring, slightly protuberant eyes. His hair receded while he was still young and with his pointed beard he bore a slight resemblance to the Stratford portrait of Shakespeare, a likeness he cultivated: if people did not remark on it he was apt to point it out. He could be charming though always serious but had a temper to match his hair. He had been born into the Church of England but his father joined the Myrtle Street Baptist Chapel when he was about seven years old. Caine, a deeply religious man who hoped to be remembered by his voluminous <span class="italic">Life of Christ</span> (published posthumously in 1937), returned to the Church of England as an adult. Hall Caine died at Greeba Castle on 31 August 1931, and was buried in Maughold churchyard, Isle of Man, on 4 September. His wife died six months later and was buried beside him. The handsome monument over their grave was designed by Archibald Knox.<br>
