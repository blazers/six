<span class="headword">Oakley,  Octavius</span>  (1800&#150;1867), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was born in Bermondsey, London, on 27 April 1800, the eighth child of a wealthy London wool merchant. Intended for a medical career, he was sent to the school of Dr Nicholas at Ealing, but when his father's business collapsed after the price of wool fell in 1815 he was placed instead with a cloth manufacturer near Leeds. He had shown in any case a marked distaste for medicine, and he displayed no greater liking for the wool trade, his real interest being art. Of &#145;somewhat elegant appearance, and comparatively slight in physique, the &#147;fine London chap&#148;&#146; struggled to gain acceptance in his new surroundings  (Roget, 2.269) and found solace in making pencil sketches of his acquaintances. As his skill increased he began to charge for his work, and when the sitters became numerous he set up as a professional artist. He later learned to work in watercolour, developing &#145;a vigorous and bold style of painting, amounting sometimes almost to coarseness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>).<br>
<br>Oakley's portraits of Yorkshire farmers gained wide repute, and when he moved to Derby, about 1825, he soon found aristocratic patrons. At Chatsworth, where he was invited to stay, he painted the duke of Devonshire and many of his distinguished guests. He also executed a watercolour portrait of Sir George Sitwell of Renishaw, great-grandfather of Sir Osbert Sitwell, who reproduced it in his memoir <span class="italic">Left Hand, Right Hand</span> (1945): &#145;finely drawn and composed &hellip; it shows Oakley as a worthy successor to Henry Edridge&#146;  (Hardie, 98). Between 1826 and 1832 Oakley exhibited seventeen portraits at the Royal Academy, including those of Lord Melbourne (1829) and the duke of Rutland (1831). In addition he painted landscapes and rustic figures, singly and in groups, and for a number of years he abandoned the position of a fashionable portrait painter to concentrate on Gipsy subjects, earning him the nickname Gipsy Oakley.<br>
<br>Before the move to Derby, Oakley had married Maria Moseley, with whom he had three daughters, the last born about 1832. Maria Oakley's premature death meant the breakup of the family home, and Oakley spent a brief time in London in 1836 before settling in a villa in Holly Walk, Leamington, from where he continued his Gipsy studies. He later married again, his second wife being Mary Ann Oakley (<i>d</i>. 1900). In or about 1841 he was persuaded by artist friends to move to London, and shortly afterwards, on 4 February 1842, he was elected an associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours; he became a full member on 10 June 1844. Oakley's &#145;clean, smooth and highly finished drawings&#146;  (Hardie, 268) became a familiar sight at Pall Mall East, where he exhibited 210 studies of rustic figures and landscapes, some of which were executed during visits to Guernsey and Sark in the Channel Islands. In the late 1840s he went with Paul Naftel to north Wales, where they sat at the feet of David Cox. In London he painted Italian organ boys, and he also resumed his portraiture, sending thirteen works to the Royal Academy between 1842 and 1860. Among them was <span class="italic">Mrs Octavius Oakley</span> (1860). He died at his home, 7 Chepstow Villas, Bayswater, on 1 March 1867, survived by his widow, and was buried in Highgate cemetery. His remaining works were sold at Christies on 11 and 12 March 1869. Examples of Oakley's works are held in the British Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum, London; Blackburn Art Gallery; Grundy Art Gallery, Liverpool; and Newport Art Gallery.<br>
<br>Each of Oakley's three daughters was a painter. The eldest, Agnes Oakley (1829&#150;1866), who was active from about 1854, painted flowers and still life and exhibited five watercolours at Suffolk Street, including <span class="italic">Study of Roses</span> and <span class="italic">Ptarmigan and Grey Men</span>. Maria Louisa Oakley, Mrs Mark Anthony Bourdin (1830&#150;1929), painted flowers and fruit and exhibited five watercolours at Suffolk Street, among them <span class="italic">Study in a Garden</span> and <span class="italic">Study of Camellias</span>. The youngest, Isabel Oakley [<i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/69049">Naftel,  Isabel</a>, <i>under</i> <a target="_top" href="/view/article/19719">Naftel,  Paul Jacob</a>], who was baptized in Derby on 20 July 1832, painted portraits, genre, landscapes, and flowers, and married the watercolour painter Paul Jacob Naftel (1817&#150;1891).<br>
