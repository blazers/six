<span class="headword">Tatham,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1749, <em>d.</em> 1834), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born at Milbeck, Dent, in the parish of Sedbergh, West Riding of Yorkshire, and baptized at Dent on 1 October 1749. When he went up to Oxford in 1769 his father, James Tatham of Sedbergh, was described as a plebeian, but when he dedicated his first theological book to him in 1780 Edward described him as a gentleman and explained he sought not an illustrious name but &#145;a more humble patron; yet one whom I esteem the highest honour to address&#146;  (E. Tatham, <span class="italic">Twelve Discourses</span>). He was educated at Sedbergh School by Dr Bateman, whose Greek scholarship he later praised highly. Although admitted to Magdalene College, Cambridge, on 11 May 1767, he did not take up residence and matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, on 21 June 1769. He graduated BA in 1772, and proceeded MA in 1776, BD in 1783, and DD in 1787. He was made a deacon in 1776 and ordained priest in 1778.<br>
<br>After a first curacy served at Banbury and an early publication proposing architectural improvements in Oxford, Tatham was elected on 27 December 1781 to one of the Yorkshire fellowships at Lincoln College, Oxford; he became rector of the college on 15 March 1792, and remained so until his death forty-two years later, enjoying during this period the rectory of Twyford, Buckinghamshire, and the right of residence at the rectory house at Combe, Oxfordshire, which went with the job. In 1801 he married Elizabeth Cook (<i>d</i>. 1847), the wealthy daughter of a Cheltenham builder, John Cook. Both her financial acumen and her temper matched Tatham's and public arguments between them were common; they had no children. They kept separate bank accounts and, when she died in 1847, Mrs Tatham left a large fortune to her sister. In 1829 Tatham was appointed rector of Whitchurch, Shropshire, but he continued to reside in Oxfordshire.<br>
<br>In 1789 Tatham gave the Bampton lectures and their publication as <span class="italic">The Chart and Scale of Truth by which to Find the Cause of Error</span>, (2 vols., 1790) constitutes his major work. This is the great exposition of the philosophy which informed his whole academic life and underlay the position he took in a series of controversies with his academic colleagues. In the lectures he mounted a major critique on Aristotelian logic, denouncing &#145;the falsehood and absurdity of the Aristotelian Dialectic&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chart and Scale of Truth</span>, 1.338). In its place he advocated the modern, inductive logic of Francis Bacon, whom he venerated as &#145;this great man, who has been justly styled the &#147;Father of Philosophers&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Letter to the &hellip; Dean of Christ Church</span>, 1807, 21). Aristotle he characterized as &#145;that uncircumcized and unbaptised Philistine of the Schools&#146;  (Tatham, <span class="italic">An Address to the Members of Convocation at Large, on the Proposed Statute on Examination</span>, 1807). When Cyril Jackson, dean of Christ Church, introduced a series of reforms at Oxford leading to a new public examination, Tatham was a fierce critic of the centrality of Aristotelian logic in the scheme and the neglect of modern, scientific studies: &#145;the youth of this University are still to bow the head and to bend the knee to the Old Pagan Idol of the Schools!!!&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Second Address to Convocation</span>, 1807, 4). He accused Oxford of neglecting the study of mathematics and natural science because Bacon and Newton had been Cambridge men, and he dared to suggest that in many respects Cambridge was the superior university. The Oxford syllabus set out in the new statute was &#145;<i>radically</i> and <i>fundamentally</i> bad; because the Discipline and Studies which it enjoins are not adapted to the Advancement of sound and useful science in the present age&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Fifth Address</span>, 1808, 3).<br>
<br>Politically Tatham was a keen ally of Burke. His <span class="italic">Letters to the Right Honourable Edmund Burke on Politics</span> are dated 2 April 1791 and welcomed Burke's <span class="italic">Reflections</span> before it was fashionable to do so. He mounted a staunch defence of the established constitution in church and state and the social hierarchy. He denounced dissenters in general and Joseph Priestley in particular, taking a side-swipe at William Paley as &#145;that unauthorized compiler&#146; along the way  (<span class="italic">Letters to Burke</span>, 47). When invited to join a celebration of the second anniversary of the French Revolution he published his acerbic refusal in a letter <span class="italic">To the Stewards of the Anniversary of the French Revolution</span>, of 23 June 1791. In the same year in his <span class="italic">Letters to Dissenters</span> Tatham defended the &#145;Church and King&#146; mob who wrecked Priestley's house in Birmingham. In 1810 he explained &#145;I like the Papists, I confess, better than the Dissenters &hellip; because they are friends to kingly government and because I think them less dangerous to the Constitution&#146;  (<span class="italic">A New Address to the Free and Independent Members of Convocation</span>, 1810, 25). But, like Burke, though an enemy to revolution, Tatham was not a complete reactionary: &#145;I am neither a Democrat, nor Aristocrat, but a friend of Monarchy under just restraint: a Representation in Parliament according to the Property of the Nation, and &hellip; a new regulation of the Poor Laws &hellip; might produce such a salutary change and renovation in the political economy and government of these kingdoms, without the shock of a Revolution&#146;  (<span class="italic">An Address to &hellip; Lord Grenville</span>, 1811, 34).<br>
<br>As an advocate of modern studies, Tatham took a keen interest in economics and wrote a number of tracts on war finances, the national debt, currency, and taxation. He strongly advocated the printing of more paper money to help the economy expand and, in 1820, supported Thomas Attwood's ideas on currency reform. He argued that money &#145;is become the most critical and important engine in every state&#146; and that lack of it had led to the French Revolution  (<span class="italic">On the Scarcity of Money</span>, 1819, 46). In 1811 he claimed to have been the inventor of income tax, having advocated such a tax on property in his <span class="italic">Third Letter to William Pitt</span> of 9 December 1797.<br>
<br>The positions which Tatham adopted were firmly based on consistent and clearly argued principles, but there is little doubt that he was a cantankerous man who enjoyed controversy. A Yorkshireman of humble origins who never lost his northern accent, he was disputing with the other fellows of Lincoln long before he was elected rector. As rector he engaged in quarrels with the other heads of houses, the Hebdomadal board and convocation. On a national level he entered fully into economic debates on taxation, currency, and the reform of the poor law. At home he argued with his wife and, after 1815 when he largely withdrew from Oxford to live at the rectory house at Combe as a pig farmer, he became embroiled in disputes with curates and parishioners. As he informed convocation in 1807, &#145;I am a plain man, blunt in my manner, and abrupt in my expression; incapable of disguising my sentiments, and apt to give them just as they arise upon every subject, whatever they may be&#146;  (<span class="italic">Address to the Members of Convocation</span>, 17).<br>
<br>Tatham died at Combe rectory on 24 April 1834 after suffering a paralytic stroke. He was buried in the vestry of All Saints' Church, Oxford. He had told Timothy Miller, parish clerk of All Saints', head porter of Lincoln, and one of his few friends, that he wished his tomb to be used as the vestry table and bread for the poor to be distributed from it each Sunday.<br>
