<span class="headword">Powys, Sir  Littleton</span>  (1647&#150;1732), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the eldest son of Thomas Powys (1618/19&#150;1672) of Henley, Shropshire, serjeant-at-law, and his first wife, Anne (<i>c</i>.1622&#150;1655), daughter of Sir Adam Littleton, first baronet, of Stoke St Milborough, Shropshire. He matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, on 25 November 1663, aged fifteen, was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 12 May 1664, and was called to the bar on 16 May 1671. On 3 December 1674 in the Temple Church he married Agnes Carter (<i>c</i>.1656&#150;1720) of St Dunstan-in-the-West, the sister of John Carter, grocer, of London.<br>
<br>Little is known about Powys before the revolution of 1688, in which he took an active part, reading the prince of Orange's declaration at Shrewsbury. His reward was an appointment on 22 July 1689 as second justice of Chester. He was created a serjeant-at-law in April 1692, and knighted later that year on 4 December. On 28 October 1695 he was appointed a baron of the exchequer and, despite rumours in September 1697 that he would be transferred to common pleas, he remained there until raised to king's bench on 26 January 1701. He was reappointed following Queen Anne's accession, and took part in most of the controversies before king's bench during the reign, most notably the Aylesbury case. He was reappointed on 20 November 1714 following the accession of George I, Lord Cowper advising that he should be kept on and his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22679/', "Sir Thomas Powys")</script> discarded: &#145;Sir Littleton, the elder brother, is a man of less abilities and consequence, but blameless&#146;  (Holmes and Speck, 64), whereas Thomas was more culpable in the actions of the previous tory ministry. Others were also unimpressed by Littleton's abilities, notably Dudley Ryder, who confided to his diary a distaste for Powys's methods. Powys was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1724. He surrendered his office on 26 October 1726, although he continued to draw his salary. He made his will, in his eighty-fifth year, in April 1731, when in pretty good health, &#145;gout excepted&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/651/116). He died between 13 and 16 March 1732 at Bitterley and was buried in Bitterley church, near to his country home at Henley Hall, Shropshire. He died childless, having invested most of his personal estate in the Bank of England and South Sea companies, at one point owning &pound;15,000 worth of bank stock.<br>
