<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pratt,  John  Tidd</span>  (1797&#150;1870), <span class="occ">barrister and civil servant</span>, was born in London on 13 December 1797, the second son of John Pratt, surgeon, of Kensington. He was admitted a student at the Inner Temple in 1819 and called to the bar in 1824. He married on 20 May 1821 Anne, daughter of Major Thomas Campbell.<br>
<br>In 1828 Tidd Pratt was appointed as consulting barrister to the national debt commissioners and an act of that year gave him the duty of certifying the rules of savings banks, which hitherto had simply been submitted to quarter sessions. The following year legislation added to his duties that of certifying the rules of friendly societies, along with the task of receiving their returns of sickness and mortality quinquennially. In subsequent years the certification of the rules of loan societies (1835), building societies (1836), and societies for the pursuit of literature, science, and the fine arts were also added to Tidd Pratt's responsibilities. Because of this widening of his duties, from 1846 he was remunerated by salary instead of through fees, and provision was made for the employment of clerks and the running of a permanent office. This enabled copies of registered rules, returns, and the like to be held centrally instead of being deposited only with local justices of the peace. By this time arrangements had to be made for the keeping of about 30,000 sets of rules and amendments. The scope of his duties continued to increase, the most important later addition being the registration of industrial and provident (or co-operative) societies from 1852.<br>
<br>The enormous expansion of Tidd Pratt's official functions reflected growing national needs, but the way in which these were met&#151;essentially the shape and form of a new government department&#151;was largely due to the personality, vigour, and influence of the man himself. He wrote extensively on the need for good management of thrift organizations. An act of 1855 required the registrar of friendly societies to submit an annual report to parliament, and this set of reports served to provide not only a mass of official statistics but also a good deal of advice on the prudent conduct of friendly and other societies. The need for the collection, analysis, and understanding of the statistical basis for reliable sickness and life insurance among working people was often little understood among friendly society members. Tidd Pratt did much to encourage improvement and the greater reliability of clubs as insurers. He campaigned against such social habits as the payment of liquid rent for the hire of club rooms at public houses&#151;in other words a club's agreeing to buy a quantity of beer in return for the use of a private room.<br>
<br>The conduct of burial societies, some of them very large, was a particular cause of concern to him, for, while they carried on their activities registered as friendly societies, they were often controlled by an &#145;irresponsible board over which the secretary usually reigns supreme&#146;. Tidd Pratt believed that such organizations were designed for the benefit of the managers and collectors, not for the members, and that special legislation was needed to control them. The affiliated orders, the Oddfellows, Foresters, and the like, which grew rapidly from the middle of the nineteenth century, felt that they had no friend in Tidd Pratt. Legislation did not in his time permit the registration of affiliated orders as such but treated each local lodge or court as the object of registration. This led to problems which he did little to try to ease and certainly he did not seek to have the law amended.<br>
<br>After Tidd Pratt's forty-one years of public service, his death in 1870 inevitably raised the question of the future shape and form of an office which had been so closely associated with one man's personality and attitudes. A royal commission was appointed which reported in 1874. Describing Tidd Pratt as &#145;minister of self-help to the whole of the industrious classes&#146;  (Royal Commission on Friendly Societies, <span class="italic">Fourth Report</span>, C 961, Appendix 1.22), it pointed out that by the middle years of the nineteenth century whether a man joined a savings bank, a friendly society, or a trade union, shopped at a co-operative store or bought his house through a building society, Tidd Pratt's certificate would follow him. The legislation based on the report built on and extended the work he had accomplished and formed the basis for the state's relationship with self-help organizations well into the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Tidd Pratt was the author of numerous legal manuals, and published on the law relating to savings banks (1828), friendly societies (1829), the poor (1833), and highways (1835). Active in London's cultural life, he was one of the founders of the Reform Club, a trustee of the Soane Museum, and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and of the Society of Antiquaries. The Institute of Actuaries made him an honorary fellow. He died at his home, 29 Abingdon Street, Westminster, on 9 January 1870. His wife died on 25 November 1875. Their eldest son, William Tidd Pratt (1823&#150;1867), a barrister, published on the law of friendly societies, building societies, and income tax. Another son, Charles Pallmer Tidd Pratt (1829&#150;1886), vicar of Bracknell, gave evidence to the 1874 commission. A daughter, Maria, married the theologian M. F. Sadler.<br>
