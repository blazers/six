<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Macray,  William Dunn</span>  (1826&#150;1916), <span class="occ">librarian, historian, and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 7 July 1826 in St Pancras, London, the third son of John Macray (1796&#150;1878) and his wife, Ann Downs. He was educated at Magdalen College School, Oxford, and matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1844, graduating in 1848.<br>
<br>John Macray was employed by Treuttel and W&uuml;rz in London and then J. H. Parker in Oxford. He was first librarian of the Taylor Institution in Oxford (1848&#150;71), and compiled and translated a number of volumes of European poetry. His son William Macray's association with the Bodleian Library began when he was only fourteen, on his appointment as a supernumerary under-assistant in July 1840. Five years later he joined the regular staff as an assistant and was in 1850 assigned to the manuscript collections, where he remained until his retirement in 1905, except for a period of eight years' work on the new general catalogue of printed books in the 1860s.<br>
<br>The work for which Macray is best known, his <span class="italic">Annals of the Bodleian Library</span>, was published early in his career, in 1868. Using the library's official records, the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century correspondence in its manuscript collections, and the diaries of Thomas Hearne, Macray covered the Bodleian's history to 1845. He escaped from the strait-jacket of a year-by-year chronicle by developing themes under the year they first occurred and then using cross-references from later years. He wrote an institutional history, enlivened by firsthand knowledge, which quickly achieved and has retained the status of indispensable manual. He produced a much enlarged second edition in 1890, taking the story to 1880. Macray's account of the forty years that he was on the staff is largely concerned with the growth of the library's collections. He rarely indulges in reminiscence and wisely stops short of E. W. B. Nicholson's troubled librarianship. His own annotated copy of the <span class="italic">Annals</span>, illustrated with photographs of many of his contemporaries, gives a more personal view of the Bodleian in the nineteenth century. Even there, little evidence survives of Macray's own involvement in the contests for the sub-librarianship in 1861 and 1865 and the librarianship in 1881&#150;2. His failure on each occasion must have been a severe disappointment.<br>
<br>Macray's long career in the Bodleian was distinguished by a succession of published catalogues and editions of manuscripts. His catalogues of the Rawlinson and Digby manuscripts, index to the Ashmole manuscripts, and calendar of the <span class="roman">Clarendon State Papers</span> remained in daily use over a century after their compilation, monuments to his industry, thoroughness, wide-ranging scholarship, and exemplary accuracy. In addition he edited over a dozen texts, ranging from monastic chronicles to Clarendon's <span class="italic">History of the Rebellion</span>. His expertise was used by the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts, for whom he produced a series of reports between 1888 and 1911, by the Public Record Office, on whose behalf he surveyed archives in Sweden and Denmark, and by Magdalen College, where he spent fourteen years calendaring the muniments. He was elected to a research fellowship at Magdalen in 1891 and thereafter published eight volumes to complete the college register. He contributed sixteen articles to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, including that on Sir Thomas Bodley.<br>
<br>Macray married Adelaide Ottilia Alberta Schmidt before 1858. They had five sons and two daughters; three of his children, like his wife, predeceased him. Macray was ordained in 1851, held various college chaplaincies, and was curate of St Mary Magdalen parish to 1867. In 1870 Magdalen College presented him to the rectory of Ducklington, 10 miles west of Oxford, where he took up residence, thereafter working half-time in the Bodleian. He served there, an exemplary parish priest, for forty-two years. The parish magazine, which he launched, included reports on church restorations, the school reading room and library, choir, bell-ringers, cricket club, penny bank, clothing club, and regular fund-raising and social events, in all of which Macray, loyally supported by his family, took an energetic, leading role. Macray died at his home, Greenlands, Bloxham, on 5 December 1916 and was buried at Ducklington. The surviving records reveal a genial and charitable man, held in affectionate regard by all who knew him.<br>
