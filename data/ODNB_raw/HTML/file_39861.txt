<span class="headword">Soames,  (Arthur) Christopher John</span>, Baron Soames  (1920&#150;1987), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 12 October 1920 in Penn, Buckinghamshire, the only son and youngest of three children of Captain Arthur Granville Soames OBE of the Coldstream Guards and Ashwell Manor, Penn, and his wife, Hope Mary Woodbyne, the daughter of Charles Woodbyne Parish. He was educated at Eton College and the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, and commissioned in 1939 as a second lieutenant in the Coldstream Guards. He served in the Middle East, Italy, and France during the Second World War, winning the Croix de Guerre (1942) while on attachment to the Free French brigade in the western desert, where his right leg was shattered by a mine explosion. In 1946 he was appointed assistant military attach&eacute; at the British embassy in Paris. In the following year he married Mary (1922&#150;2014), youngest daughter of Winston Churchill, former prime minister.<br>
<br>In 1950 Soames entered parliament as the Conservative member for Bedford. During Churchill's second premiership (1952&#150;5) Soames acted as his parliamentary private secretary. He did much to keep the government going, masking the seriousness of his father-in-law's illness, when Churchill suffered a stroke in 1953. He went through the ranks of junior ministerial office before becoming secretary of state for war in 1958 (when he was sworn of the privy council) and serving in the cabinet in 1960&#150;64 as minister of agriculture.<br>
<br>Having lost his seat in the 1966 election, Soames was an inspired choice by the government led by Harold Wilson as British ambassador to France (1968&#150;72). Soames took up his post at a difficult time, with President Charles de Gaulle continuing to obstruct British accession to the EC. His term in Paris began inauspiciously with the leaking by the Foreign Office of the contents of a private conversation between him and de Gaulle (&#145;l' affaire Soames&#146;). A year later de Gaulle was gone and Soames was able to establish a much warmer relationship with his successor, Georges Pompidou. This was the crucial period leading to the successful completion of negotiations for Britain's entry into the EC and Soames, himself a convinced European, played a major part in persuading the French government no longer to impede the negotiations. His excellent colloquial French, splendid hospitality, and ebullient personality endeared him to the Parisians.<br>
<br>Immediately following British entry into the EC Soames was the first British vice-president of the European Commission and commissioner for external affairs, from 1973 to January 1977. He was a most effective commissioner. He played a major role in international trade negotiations and in establishing British influence in Brussels.<br>
<br>After a brief return to private life Soames was invited to join Margaret Thatcher's government in 1979 as lord president of the council and leader of the House of Lords. Later that year he was given his most difficult task, being appointed governor of Southern Rhodesia to oversee the ceasefire and elections leading to the independence of Zimbabwe. When he set off from London the ceasefire had still not been agreed, much less brought into effect, and the prospects for the success of his mission were generally discounted by the press. Following the successful conclusion of the Lancaster House negotiations a ceasefire was implemented under the supervision of the largely British Commonwealth monitoring force. Soames had the greatest difficulty with the Rhodesian military commanders on the one hand and sections of the Patriotic Front on the other throughout the period leading up to the elections, which were held in February 1980. He had to exercise responsibility with no more real power than he could win by bargaining with the contending parties. He set out to establish a personal relationship with the black political leaders, assuring Robert Mugabe that, if he won the elections, Soames would take the lead in helping the new government establish itself in a still uncertain, tense, and dangerous situation. When Mugabe did win he invited Soames to continue to serve as governor. In the ensuing period major steps were taken towards bringing together and forming into a single military command elements of the Rhodesian forces and those of the Patriotic Front, which itself was split into two warring factions. Soames left Rhodesia having helped to bring an end to the war and to launch Zimbabwe as an independent nation, amid near-universal plaudits.<br>
<br>On his return to Britain he had to deal with matters far less congenial to him, including a civil service strike. He found himself out of sympathy with the new economic strategy being pursued by Thatcher and with her style of government. In 1981 he was dropped from the government. He remained thereafter very active in business, holding a number of important directorships until his death, including those of N. M. Rothschilds and the National Westminster Bank, and the chairmanship of ICL (UK).<br>
<br>Soames was a figure very much larger than life. His conversation could usually be heard in the next room. His convivial but forthright personality inspired strong loyalties among his friends and some resistance on the part of more sensitive souls. His hospitality and enjoyment of life were legendary. As ambassador in Paris, commissioner in Brussels, and governor of Rhodesia he put up performances which could scarcely have been matched by anyone else. His success in all these capacities owed much to his wife, Mary. They had three sons, one of whom, Nicholas, also became a Conservative MP and minister, and two daughters.<br>
<br>The academic distinctions Soames received included honorary doctorates from Oxford (1981) and St Andrews (1974). He was awarded the Robert Schuman prize in 1976. He was appointed CBE (1955) and GCMG and GCVO (1972), created a life peer as Baron Soames in 1978, and appointed CH in 1980. He also was awarded, on his departure from Paris, the cross of grand officer of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. He died from cancer on 16 September 1987, at his home in Odiham, Hampshire.<br>
