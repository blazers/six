<span class="headword">Wigner,  George William</span>  (1842&#150;1884), <span class="occ">analytical chemist</span>, was born on 19 October 1842 at Norfolk Street, King's Lynn, the eldest son of John Thomas Wigner, minister of the local Baptist church, and his wife, Harriett Louisa (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Ovenden). He was educated at Lynn grammar school before becoming a clerk in a private banking firm in London in 1859.<br>
<br>Wigner spent his leisure time studying chemistry, and, following a lecture he gave on the subject, was offered, in 1864, a post in the Deptford chemical works of Frank Hills. In 1867, in conjunction with the bullion brokers W. C. and R. G. Sillar, Wigner developed the ABC process of sewage treatment, which was patented in June 1868. Using a mixture of alum, blood, and clay, the patentees hoped to purify sewage and at the same time produce a powerful manure. In the same year that the patent was granted, Wigner became managing director of the Native Guano Company, set up to work the process. Despite the insinuation by the royal commission on river pollution in 1870 that the ABC process was fraudulent, it remained the most durable of chemical sewage treatment processes, and was still operating in the late 1880s.<br>
<br>In the early 1870s Wigner ceased to be active in the Native Guano Company, and in 1872 he began practice in Great Tower Street as a chemical analyst, specializing in commercial materials and foodstuffs. On 4 April in the same year he married Fanny Louisa (1850/51&#150;1884), daughter of William Harrison, wholesale grocer. In 1878 Wigner carried out a programme of analyses of the waters of seaside towns, sponsored by the <span class="italic">Sanitary Record</span>, and published as <span class="italic">Seaside water: an examination into the character of the water-supply at the watering places of England and Wales</span> (1878). Wigner's salutary warning that many places to which holiday makers were resorting for health were unhealthy brought forth hostile criticism from local medical men and partisan chemists.<br>
<br>Wigner was a promoter of the <span class="roman">Sale of Food and Drugs Act</span> of 1875 and principal founder of the Society of Public Analysts in the same year. He served as public analyst for Plumstead, Greenwich, and Deptford. Recognizing that prosecutions often failed due to disagreement over proper methodology, he was an early leader in the movement for standard methods. In 1876 Wigner and John Muter became proprietors as well as editors of <span class="italic">The Analyst</span>. Wigner's editorial criticism of some of his colleagues' methods strained the fellowship of the young society but strengthened the profession. As editor, as secretary of the society from its beginning until 1883, and as president during the last year of his life, Wigner made the society and the journal a clearing-house of information in the fight against adulteration, compiling annual reports from public analysts in Britain and America, reviewing trends in adulteration, and undertaking analytical and legal efforts against it. A definition of adulteration drafted by Wigner won a prize from the United States national board of health in 1880 and was incorporated into legislation passed by several states. In 1878 he proposed a point system that would sum the results of several tests and allow ready comparison of waters from different towns. Comparisons using a simplified version of the scale were published annually in <span class="italic">The Analyst</span> during the early 1880s.<br>
<br>Wigner was a fellow of the Chemical Society and of the Institute of Chemistry. Most of his approximately fifty scientific papers were contributions to <span class="italic">The Analyst</span> on many aspects of food and water chemistry. He died at his home, 82 Wickham Road, Brockley, of stricture of the &#339;sophagus on 17 October 1884, a few months after the death from rheumatic fever of his wife, and was buried in Brockley cemetery five days later. The couple were survived by their two small children.<br>
