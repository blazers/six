<span class="headword">Otterburn, Sir  Adam</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1548), <span class="occ">lawyer and diplomat</span>, was possibly descended from the family which produced such notable legal figures in the fifteenth century as Nicholas Otterburn, clerk register, and John Otterburn, official of Lothian. Nothing certain is known of his parents, although it is possible that Marion Brown, the widow of Thomas Otterburn, in whose favour he resigned lands in 1515, was his mother, and Thomas his father. His sister may have been the Janet Otterburn who married John Laing in 1528, though Otterburn had a daughter of the same name. He was married twice&#151;first to Janet Rhynd and then, before 1525, to Euphame Mowbray. With his second wife he had three sons: John, Robert, and Thomas. He also had three daughters: Margaret, Janet, and another whose name is unknown.<br>
<br>Having graduated MA, probably at a foreign university, Otterburn appeared in 1503 on the same witness list as James Henryson, king's advocate. Their relationship was a close one and in later years Otterburn maintained links with Henryson's widow and family. He was first nominated to appear as a procurator before the lords of council in 1505 and appeared regularly thereafter. Over the period 1504 to 1514 he was the fourth most popular procurator before the lords in terms of nominations by litigants. In 1514 he was constituted as procurator by more litigants than any other man of law, and his standing as a lawyer was such that in 1509 he acted on behalf of the king during the temporary absence of Henryson; in 1512 he succeeded Henryson as burgh clerk of Edinburgh, a post which he retained until about 1525.<br>
<br>On 5 January 1517 Otterburn was appointed a lord of council and thereafter was regularly on the council sederunt. He was also one of those appointed to act as receiver of Queen Margaret's rents in December 1518. In May 1523 he was authorized, in the absence of the justice-clerk, to subscribe all judicial deliverances in criminal cases provided he did so along with one of the regents. Despite becoming a member of the council, Otterburn&#151;as was common practice&#151;maintained his activity as an advocate both before the lords of council and in sheriff courts. He was also constituted one of the sheriffs-depute of Stirling by Lord Erskine in 1524.<br>
<br>As a burgess and common clerk of Edinburgh, Otterburn was heavily involved in burgh affairs. This was recognized on 27 November 1521 when he was promoted from ordinary burgess and admitted as honorary burgess and guild brother. In February 1518 the burgh community had vigorously supported his protest at an attempt by the provost, the first earl of Arran, to usurp his right of appointing a deputy clerk&#151;a stand for burgh independence that ended with triumphant shouts of &#145;Otterburn, Otterburn&#146;. Otterburn was himself provost of the burgh in 1521&#150;2, 1528&#150;32, 1543&#150;4, and 1547&#150;8, and also fulfilled the office occasionally at other times when the serving provost was absent, particularly during 1535&#150;6. As provost he was active in 1530 during an outbreak of plague in the burgh, imposing sanitary regulations. Otterburn also acted on the burgh's behalf in legal matters before the lords of council, before and after the foundation of the college of justice in 1532. He devoted some of his assets to engaging in trade, and appears to have imported cloth and other products.<br>
<br>Appointment as king's advocate in 1524 as successor to James Wishart, though boosting his precedence in the council sederunt, did not end Otterburn's career as an advocate working for private clients. There is evidence that he continued to acquire significant client income as well as his annual fee from the king. For instance, in 1527 the earl of Cassillis acknowledged that he was 300 merks in debt to Otterburn, while in July 1533, following arbitration, it was agreed between Otterburn and Andrew Murray of Blackbarony that the latter should pay Otterburn 200 merks over five years in return for counsel and labour concerning Murray's lands and leases during that period. Otterburn also enjoyed a considerable career as a diplomat from January 1521, when he was a member of a commission sent to meet Lord Dacre, the English warden of the marches, to discuss measures against border raids. Other border commissions followed in August 1525, late 1528 (leading to the treaty of Berwick), 1533, and 1534 and Otterburn also attended days of truce. His early political stance was that of a supporter of the eighteenth earl of Angus, and he argued that the election of Archibald Douglas of Kilspindie as provost of Edinburgh in 1519 was conform to law and that to remove him would damage the burgh's privileges. The antagonism between Arran and the burgh was reversed by a compromise reached in January 1521 and from this time Otterburn modified his position somewhat in regard to Arran's enemy, Angus. In the following January the duke of Albany laid siege to Angus's castle at Tantallon and Otterburn's farm at Auldhame was damaged, though he subsequently received compensation from the exchequer.<br>
<br>Otterburn had frequent contact with the English ambassador Thomas Magnus, particularly in regard to the possible marriage of James V to Princess Mary Tudor. In letters of November 1524 Magnus described him as &#145;very favourable and foreward in our causes&#146;, and as &#145;one of the wisest men in Edinburgh, well lerned and of good experience and practise&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 4.232, 236). Otterburn was sent to London in 1533 by the king bearing a letter of credence to Henry VIII describing James's &#145;singular traist and confidence&#146; in him as a man who had &#145;aye bene a sollistar of peace and concord to be betuix Us and our Realmes&#146;  (ibid., 664); while in England Otterburn was knighted, probably by Henry VIII. He returned to Scotland in May 1535 but was back in London the next year from March until June, discussing a proposed meeting between King James and King Henry. During this period, as in other periods of absence from the realm, Otterburn's role as king's advocate was taken up by interim substitutes appointed on a temporary basis.<br>
<br>Otterburn's first appearance in parliament, as representative of Edinburgh, came in 1523 when he was also elected one of the lords auditor of causes. He subsequently appeared on a regular basis as a commissioner to parliament for the burgh of Edinburgh, sometimes being appointed one of the lords of the articles. Service to crown, burgh, and private clients allowed Otterburn to build up considerable landed estates. By 1518 he held Auldhame, near Tantallon, of the archbishop of St Andrews. In 1527 he purchased the lands of Redhall in Edinburghshire from William, master of Glencairn. Two years later, as a reward for his services as ambassador, he was granted the lands of Orchardfield, near Kirknewton, Edinburghshire. Prior to 1536 he apprised (obtained infeftment in, as secured creditor, following failure to repay a debt) the lands of Dirleton.<br>
<br>In 1538, because of his reported ability as a poet, Otterburn was involved in writing the speech in French which welcomed Mary of Guise to Edinburgh (though neither this speech nor any of his poetry has survived). Then in September of that year he was suddenly dismissed from office for communicating with the exiled earl of Angus. In the words of the English ambassador Sir Ralph Sadler, he was &#145;suspected to be over good an Englishe man&#146;  (Inglis, 68&#150;9). He had not been in favour of the forfeiture of Angus in 1528 and he was rumoured to have been in contact with the exiled earl while he was in London in 1536. Warded in Dumbarton Castle for four months, he was released and exiled to Fife during the king's pleasure and fined &pound;2000 before regaining his liberty towards the end of 1539. The Edinburgh burgess Nicol Cairncross gave caution for payment of &pound;1000 of the fine to the treasurer, James Kirkcaldy of Grange. This fine led to financial difficulties that troubled Otterburn for the rest of his life. Despite his frequent contact with England, he did not favour the reformed religion and enjoyed close contacts with Cardinal David Beaton.<br>
<br>Otterburn was politically rehabilitated to some extent because of his skill in diplomacy. In 1542 he was sent to London, but the circumstances of this mission are unclear. On 16 February 1543 he resumed his place as a lord of session. He strongly opposed the proposal that the infant Queen Mary should marry Prince Edward of England, and the issue appears to have caused a shift in his view of foreign policy towards a closer understanding with France. Sir Ralph Sadler later attributed the remark to Otterburn that &#145;if your lad were a las, and our las were a lad, would you then be so earnest in the mateir?&#146;  (Clifford, 3, 326). During 1543 Otterburn was re-elected provost of Edinburgh, and English reports firmly portray him as a supporter of the pro-French Cardinal Beaton. However, he was again dismissed as provost following the successful attack on Edinburgh by the earl of Hertford in May 1544. He may have been imprisoned towards the end of the year for his continuing association with the Douglases, who were declared guilty of treason by Governor Arran, but after a reconciliation in the following February Otterburn was again sitting as a lord of session in April 1545.<br>
<br>Following Beaton's murder on 29 May 1546 Otterburn was part of an embassy sent to England in August to discuss an offer by Henry to include Scotland in the recent treaty of Campe. He did not return until August 1547. In July 1548 he was attacked in Edinburgh by John Muir of Annestoun and John Murray of Annestounheid; &#145;sore hurt on the head&#146;, he died there on 6 July  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1509&#150;89</i>, 90). The motive is unknown but may have related to his pro-French political position.<br>
