<span class="headword">Waterhouse,  George Robert</span>  (1810&#150;1888), <span class="occ">zoologist</span>, was born on 6 March 1810 at Somers Town, London, the son of James Edward Waterhouse, a solicitor's clerk and amateur lepidopterist, and his wife, Mary Newman. Waterhouse loathed his education at a school in Koekelberg, near Brussels (1821&#150;4), and returned to England to be articled to an architect. He practised between 1831 and 1835, designing the Hampstead garden of the publisher Charles Knight. However, the capture of a pair of poplar hawkmoths while a schoolboy had fired him for a different career; the draughtsman turned to illustrating insect structure, and he became a gifted entomologist. Self-taught, like so many, he transformed an avocation into an occupation. He was among the founders (and was honorary curator) of the Entomological Society in 1833, an informal enthusiasts' club. Partly he financed his career move by writing on insects, fish, and mammals for Knight's <span class="italic">Penny Cyclopedia</span>. In 1834 he married Elizabeth Ann Griesbach, sister of fellow Entomological Society officer the Revd A. W. Griesbach. The couple had three sons and three daughters. Appointment to a museum curatorship at the Royal Institution at Liverpool in 1835 brought some security. However, Waterhouse returned to London the following year; when John Gould, the superintendent of the ornithological collections of the Zoological Society of London's museum, went on half pay, Waterhouse was appointed the museum's first curator in 1836 at &pound;120 per annum. Newly located in John Hunter's Leicester Square house, the Zoological Society's museum was wealthy at first, with an annual budget of &pound;1000 and bulging shelves. Within a year Waterhouse had completed his <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Mammalia</span> (1838), which listed all 665 mammals, though its publication was delayed because of his nomenclatural disagreements with the society's quinarians.<br>
<br>Waterhouse was a prolific describer of the world's Coleoptera (beetles), rodents, and marsupials, publishing 120 papers between 1833 and 1866. The species he enumerated told of Britain's imperial march: from scarab beetles to Australian butterflies, African giant rats to Indian squirrels. He first described the Australian numbat <i>Myrmecobius</i> in 1836. That year HMS <i>Beagle</i> returned, and Waterhouse examined Darwin's South American mice, recognizing nineteen new species and one new genus in February 1837. His findings&#151;which came just as Gould was diagnosing Darwin's supposedly disparate Gal&aacute;pagos birds as representative species of finch&#151;helped to convince Darwin that representative species were common, and that islands could evolve new races. Waterhouse contributed the volume <span class="italic">Mammalia</span> to Darwin's five-part <span class="italic">Zoology of the Voyage of HMS Beagle</span> in 1839. He also described Darwin's insects, again showing that the Gal&aacute;pagos species were largely unique to each island. Classification was then part of zoology's <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>, but Waterhouse's quinarian arrangement of mammals in 1843 had Darwin insisting (in a rare admission of his private views) that true classification should reflect &#145;descent from common stocks&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 2.376).<br>
<br>In 1843 the Zoological Society ended Waterhouse's appointment, evidently as an economy measure, and he became an assistant in the mineralogical branch of the department of natural history at the British Museum. His <span class="italic">Natural History of the Mammalia</span> (1846&#150;8) stopped at two volumes (on marsupials and rodents) when the publisher Bailli&egrave;re was affected by the revolution in France. Waterhouse was president of the Entomological Society in 1849&#150;50, and vice-president of the Zoological Society in 1862&#150;3. His brother F. G. Waterhouse, who lived in South Australia from 1852, sent Waterhouse canisters of live Coleoptera, enabling him to become an expert on the Australian Curculionidae (weevils), and to monograph the family Amycterinae. His <span class="italic">Catalogue of British Coleoptera</span> (1858) cleared up the synonymy of many species.<br>
<br>In 1851 Waterhouse succeeded Charles K&ouml;nig as keeper of the mineralogical branch, which was shortly renamed the mineralogical and geological branch. It became the department of geology and mineralogy in 1856, with Waterhouse its keeper; on its division into two departments in 1857, Waterhouse became keeper of geology. Richard Owen, the new superintendent of the natural history department, dispatched Waterhouse to Germany in 1862 to assess Karl H&auml;berlein's Solenhofen fossils, especially the reptilian bird <i>Archaeopteryx</i> (or &#145;Gryphosaurus&#146; as Owen was set to call it, and as it appears in the trustees' minutes). Waterhouse negotiated the British Museum's purchase of 107 fossils and 53 counterparts of Solenhofen reptiles and fish, including <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, for &pound;450 in November 1862. He bought a further 1595 fossils from H&auml;berlein in 1863. He added numerous collections from the mid-1860s, when he purchased J. S. Bowerbank's Mesozoic invertebrates, until 1880, when he acquired 50,000 non-British fossils from the Museum of Practical Geology. As a keeper and erstwhile architect, Waterhouse helped to design the galleries of the new Natural History Museum in South Kensington, but he blocked moves (suggested by T. H. Huxley) to build a lecture theatre and research galleries. Waterhouse retired in 1880, a year before the museum opened. He nevertheless saw his son Charles Owen Waterhouse (whose godfathers were Charles Darwin and Richard Owen) continue as an assistant in the zoology department. Waterhouse never entirely recovered from a stroke in 1885 and he died at his home, Curton Lodge, Werter Road, Putney, on 21 January 1888.<br>
