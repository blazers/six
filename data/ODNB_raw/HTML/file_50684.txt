<span class="headword">Symonds,  Emily Morse</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>George Paston]</span>  (1860&#150;1936), <span class="occ">novelist and playwright</span>, was born on 4 September 1860 at St Mary in the Marsh, Norwich, Norfolk, the daughter of the Revd Henry Symonds, minor canon and precentor of Norwich Cathedral, and his wife, Emily Hannah Evans. Her first cousin was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26888/', "John Addington Symonds")</script>; she did not admire his work. After her father's death she and her mother moved to London, where they lived at 7 Thurloe Square, Kensington, and travelled for several months each year.<br>
<br>Symonds's first published work&#151;under the pseudonym of George Paston, which she used all her life&#151;was a study of the Murray publishing house: <span class="italic">At John Murray's: Records of a Literary Circle</span> (1892). She then turned to fiction, producing a number of novels with feminist themes. <span class="italic">A Modern Amazon</span> (1894) examines marriage, but it also looks at the position of working women:<blockquote>Of late years employers have made the startling discovery that women of birth and education may be adapted for other uses than those of household ornament and domestic pet; that they may be converted, in fact, into sober, industrious, and very useful drudges. (p. 3)</blockquote>
<span class="italic">A Study in Prejudices</span> (1895) is a pointed examination of double sexual standards. The heroine of <span class="italic">The Career of Candida</span> (1896) is brought up as a boy and moves to London to teach gymnastics and fencing, the more interesting aspect of a novel which also shows her dutifully returning to her weak husband after he is disabled. <span class="italic">A Writer of Books</span> (1898), strong on women writers in Grub Street, firmly makes the point, in the final chapter, that &#145;In the life of the modern woman, blessed with an almost inexhaustible supply of strings, love is no less episodical than in the life of a man&#146;  (p. 341). <span class="italic">A Bread and Butter Miss</span> (1895) and <span class="italic">A Fair Deceiver</span> (1898) have more conventional romantic plots, though they still feature spirited women.<br>
<br>Arnold Bennett, who knew Symonds in the 1890s, claimed that she was &#145;on the whole the most advanced and intellectually-fearless woman I have met&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journals</span>, 17). But she thought little of most modern fiction and maintained a strong interest in previous centuries, turning to biography and writing lives of George Romney (1903), Benjamin Haydon (1905), Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (1907), and Pope (1909), in addition to other studies of the Georgian period. Her dramas, beginning with <span class="italic">The Pharisee's Wife</span> (Duke of York's Theatre, 1904), privileged women's roles above men's parts. In the subsequent decade some of her plays dealt with suffrage and feminist issues, including <span class="italic">Feed the Brute</span> (1909) and <span class="italic">Nobody's Daughter</span> (1910), which ran to 185 performances. Later dramatic works, such as <span class="italic">Double or Quits</span> (1919) and <span class="italic">Clothes and the Woman</span> (1922), were much more light-hearted, owing a good deal to the French comedies which she also translated.<br>
<br>In addition to book-length publications and plays, Symonds produced a good deal of literary journalism. She was extremely reticent about her own work: despite her productivity, she had what her <span class="italic">Times</span> obituarist termed &#145;an almost fanatical dislike of self-advertisement&#146;  (12 Sept 1936, 14). This obituary, a remarkably strong anti-feminist polemic, claims that her outmoded stress on women's issues was responsible for her rapid decline in popularity. Symonds died, unmarried, of heart failure at 7 Pelham Place, Kensington, London, on 11 September 1936.<br>
