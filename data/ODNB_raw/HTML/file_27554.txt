<span class="headword">Topham,  Thomas</span>  (1710&#150;1749), <span class="occ">strong man and publican</span>, was born in London; all that is known about his parents is that his father was a carpenter. In 1734, having just completed his apprenticeship in carpentry, Thomas determined to become a publican and began his new career as the landlord of the Red Lion inn near old St Luke's Hospital, London. It seems likely that this change of career was prompted by an awareness of the commercial potential of his feats of strength. These had first come to public attention when, despite lying on his back with his feet against the dwarf wall that divided Upper and Lower Moorfields in London, he had succeeded in winning a tug-of-war against a horse. It was certainly the case that within a very short time of becoming a publican Topham was conducting commercial exhibitions of his feats, notably at Stationers' Hall on 10 July 1734. A woodcut of the event shows him lying extended between two chairs, with a glass of wine in his right hand, and five gentlemen standing on top of his body.<br>
<br>Topham embarked on numerous provincial tours, as well as exhibiting feats of strength in Ireland and Scotland. During these tours he was often lauded. For instance, at Macclesfield in Cheshire the corporation were so impressed by his feats that they gave him a purse of gold coins and made him a free burgess. On 3 April 1737, as part of an exhibition to which he charged 1<i>s</i>. admission per head, Topham rolled up a pewter dish of 7 lb &#145;as a man rolls up a sheet of paper&#146;  (Wilson, 8). This astonishing achievement was witnessed by many influential people, including the natural philosopher Jean Theophilus Desaguliers, who had their names inscribed on the dish, which was donated to the British Museum. Later during the exhibition, while lying on two chairs with four people standing on his body, Topham, using just one hand, lifted the 27 stone vicar of All Saints' Church up&#151;a truly amazing feat. At the end of this exhibition Topham sang &#145;Mad Tom&#146;, though his voice was described as &#145;more terrible than sweet&#146;  (Pinks, 78).<br>
<br>During his long periods of absence Topham's publican business failed, and although over the next eight years he took on the leases of at least three other London pubs, the Golden Lion and Duke's Head in Islington, and the Bell and Dragon in Shoreditch, all proved commercial failures. This appears surprising because he would sometimes stage public performances of feats of strength, charging 1<i>s</i>. admission. His most celebrated performance was on 28 May 1741 at the Apple Tree inn (opposite Coldbath Fields prison), a London pub that he might have been running, though this is unclear. The event was a celebration of Admiral Edward Vernon's election to parliament on an anti-Walpole ticket. Standing on a wooden stage Topham on this occasion raised three hogsheads of water weighing 1836 pounds, via a strong rope and tackle that passed over his shoulders.<br>
<br>Topham appears to have been convivial, joining both the freemasons and the Strong Man Lodge, but despite his &#145;good nature&#146;  (Nelson, 130) much of his life was very unhappy. The chief cause of this was his perpetually unfaithful wife, though this anguish was amplified by his many business difficulties. He seems to have been rather simple and suffered two serious accidents through behaving stupidly. In the first, a failure to assess the dangers of a feat involving two horses led to his knees' becoming damaged, leaving him with a slight limp. In the second, as a joke, he began to tug away scaffolding (much to the anxiety of the builders on top), and a large post struck him on the head. He was also easily duped and lost a bet to an archer in a Finsbury pub when he failed to realize that the only way to hold a bow in order to draw an arrow two thirds of its length was to point it towards his ear not his breast. Tales of such na&iuml;vety lend credibility to Topham's feats of strength; although he was only 5 ft 10 in., and it was well established that skilful conmen, such as those functioning in Germany, could accomplish some of the stunts that he performed, even the most sceptical contemporaries were convinced that his achievements were &#145;genuine&#146;  (Fairholt, 49).<br>
<br>In 1745 Topham became master of the Shoreditch pub the Bell and Dragon and supplemented his income by performing exhibitions of strength for public amusement. Unfortunately, his generally mild disposition was excited to frenzy by his unfaithful wife and in early August 1749 he stabbed both her and himself. Topham's wife, whose name is unknown, survived the assault, but after languishing for a few days he died at the Bell and Dragon, and was buried in the church of St Leonard, Shoreditch, on 10 August 1749.<br>
