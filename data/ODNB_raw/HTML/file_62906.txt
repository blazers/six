<span class="headword">Lloyd, Sir  Herbert</span>, first baronet  (1720&#150;1769), <span class="occ">politician and landowner</span>, born on 22 July 1720 at Peterwell, Lampeter, Cardiganshire, was the third of five surviving children of Walter Lloyd (1678?&#150;1747) and his wife, Elizabeth Evans (<i>d</i>. 1743), daughter of Daniel Evans of Peterwell, a wealthy landowner. His father, a whig supporter, was appointed the local law officer of the crown after the Hanoverian succession, and served as MP for Cardiganshire from 1734 to 1742. Educated initially at home, Lloyd studied at Jesus College, Oxford (1738&#150;40), and proceeded to the Inner Temple. He was called to the bar in 1742. He married in 1742 Elizabeth Bragge of Essex, who died the following year. In 1745 he married Ann (1702&#150;1778), daughter of William Powell of Nanteos, Cardiganshire, and widow of Richard Stedman of Great Abbey, Strata Florida. They took up residence at Foelallt, Llanddewibrefi. Although an Anglican Lloyd had some early sympathy with the Methodists and was friendly with Howel Harris, one of the founders of Welsh Methodism. On the death of his brother John, MP for Cardiganshire, in 1755, he inherited the Peterwell and Llechwedd Dderi estates. Together with Foelallt, this made him a substantial landowner.<br>
<br>Herbert Lloyd became notorious for his irascible nature and oppressive behaviour. Appointed a JP at an early age, he soon acquired a reputation for harshness. Lloyd's intemperate behaviour led to his being struck out of the commission of the peace in 1755, and his treatment of Ann, his second wife, caused her to leave him. He is associated with falsely accusing Si&ocirc;n Philip, a freeholder, of stealing his prized black ram and of securing his execution at Cardigan in order to acquire his land. He harboured political ambitions but was persuaded by the Newcastle administration to stand aside, in favour of another, in the contest to succeed his brother as MP in 1755. At that time his rival, Wilmot Vaugham, wrote to Newcastle that &#145;The views of the present Mr Lloyd of Peterwell are so very extensive, his principles so little fixed, and his whole character so unstable&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1754&#150;90</span>, 47). However, Lloyd was finally elected to parliament in 1761 as member for the Cardigan Boroughs. He sought to ingratiate himself with the prime minister, the duke of Newcastle, and with his successor, the earl of Bute, and was granted a baronetcy in January 1763. The title served to increase his unpopularity among the Cardiganshire gentry and they began to refer to him as the Vulture Knight.<br>
<br>Lloyd's parliamentary career was inauspicious, but he was one of those members who favoured the ending of the Seven Years' War. Lloyd approved of the expulsion of John Wilkes from parliament in 1764; but he was listed by the marquess of Rockingham as &#145;doubtful&#146; in July 1765. On 22 February 1766 he voted against the administration's bill to repeal the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span>. He nevertheless seems to have supported the administration of William Pitt the elder. Having alienated his local political allies due to his erratic behaviour, Lloyd declined to contest the 1768 election. Following the death of the successful member, however, Lloyd again offered himself as a candidate in the by-election held in January 1769, but was defeated. He challenged the result, but unsuccessfully petitioned the committee of privileges and elections to have it overturned. Having spent vast sums of money on his mansion at Peterwell, and with his political career now in ruins, he faced increasing financial problems. Allied to this, his excesses over the years had greatly affected his health. He frequently visited the gaming tables in London in vain attempts to recoup his losses. During one of these visits, shortly before his death, Lloyd bigamously married a Mrs Bacon of Bishop Auckland. There were also regular visits to take the waters at Bath.<br>
<br>On one of these journeys Sir Herbert was taken ill and died <i>en route</i> for Bath on 20 August 1769. His body was returned to Peterwell and he was interred with due pomp at midnight on 3 September 1769 in the family vault at St Peter's Church, Lampeter. It appears that he died of natural causes and there is no foundation to the tradition that he committed suicide in London. As Lloyd had no children, Peterwell passed to his nephew, John Adams of Whitland. The estate had been heavily mortgaged to the sum of &pound;54,000 and it was sold on 24 September 1781 to Albany Wallis, a London lawyer.<br>
