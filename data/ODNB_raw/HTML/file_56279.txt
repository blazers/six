<span class="headword">M&uuml;ller,  (Frances) Henrietta</span>  (1845/6&#150;1906), <span class="occ">women's rights activist and theosophist</span>, was born in Valpara&iacute;so, Chile, daughter of William M&uuml;ller, a German emigr&eacute; businessman and JP for Hertfordshire, and his wife, Maria Henrietta M&uuml;ller. She grew up in Chile with little formal schooling but was evidently well-educated; she spoke six languages and travelled widely in Europe and America. In 1873 she entered Girton College, Cambridge, taking a third in the moral science tripos in 1877.<br>
<br>Inspired by recent efforts by feminists, including Girton's founder mistress, Emily Davies, to enable women to enter public life, M&uuml;ller devoted herself to social and political causes concerned with the advancement of women. While still at Cambridge she became involved with Emma Paterson's efforts to set up trade unions among women and helped to found the Women's Printing Society. Upon leaving Cambridge in 1878, a woman of independent means with no need to earn her living, she stood for the Lambeth division for election to the London school board; an investment of &pound;12,000 and the efforts of many female assistants ensured that she was returned top of the poll. She remained a member until 1885, independent of political party and renowned for her close relations with teachers, which enabled her to carry out small but significant practical reforms. On discovering, for example, that the girls had to sew a number of stitches to the inch which exceeded that of the finest work sold in London shops she had the number reduced to save their eyesight.<br>
<br>In 1882 M&uuml;ller presided at the meeting which planned the first hall of residence for women in Bloomsbury. In 1883 she succeeded in getting the London school board to employ women clerks, cannily pointing out that this would save money since women were paid less than men. In fact she was in favour of equal pay for the sexes and shortly afterwards proposed that female junior teachers, who earned two-thirds the wage of men in equivalent jobs, should be paid the same. She lost, equal pay for teachers not being fully implemented until 1961.<br>
<br>A poor-law guardian herself, M&uuml;ller founded the Society for Promoting the Return of Women as Poor Law Guardians about 1883 and was its first secretary. In &#145;The work of women as poor law guardians&#146; in the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span> of April 1885 she argued that such work was eminently suited to women because their sphere was the home, and poor-law work was simply &#145;domestic economy on a larger scale&#146;. Similar reasoning&#151;women's suitability for work with the young&#151;underlay her article about the work of the London school board in the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span> of January 1888. &#145;The future of single women&#146;  (<span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>, 65, Jan 1884) suggested that spinsters, possessing women's superior qualities of insight and self-control yet free from men's demands in marriage, should undertake the task of protecting the rights of women and children. &#145;What woman is fitted for&#146;  (<span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>, 71, Jan 1887) was an attack on contemporary marriage which, M&uuml;ller claimed, stunted women's humanity.<br>
<br>During the 1880s M&uuml;ller was a member of the executive of the National Vigilance Association (NVA) which, in campaigning against the sexual exploitation of women and girls, supported government moves to close down brothels. M&uuml;ller, however, was concerned that this could leave prostitutes open to harassment and destitution, a view shared by the Personal Rights Association, to which she also belonged. In 1888 M&uuml;ller resigned from the NVA over this point and because the NVA attempted to prosecute birth-control pamphlets as &#145;vicious literature&#146;. M&uuml;ller herself favoured contraception to free women from continual child bearing until men learned self-control. Recognizing that contraception might give men even freer access to women's bodies, she argued that women must control its use.<br>
<br>At a time when the criminal justice system was entirely in men's hands, M&uuml;ller campaigned for women police, magistrates, and jurors. On one occasion she resisted an order for all women to leave the court during an incest case, observing that the young victim needed &#145;one or two of her own sex in court to give her their moral support&#146;  (Jeffreys, 62). She supported the temperance movement because she perceived a connection between men's drinking and domestic violence and impoverishment. She was on the executive of the National Society for Women's Suffrage and a tax resister.<br>
<br>In 1885 M&uuml;ller joined the Men and Women's Club, a London circle of freethinkers founded by Karl Pearson. Unusually for a mixed gathering, the group discussed such issues as prostitution, (hetero)sexuality, marriage, birth control, and women's emancipation. M&uuml;ller contributed to several debates but resigned in 1888. She accused the men of laying down the moral parameters of the debate and refusing to examine their own motives and behaviours, particularly with respect to sexual licence. In the same year she founded the <span class="italic">Women's Penny Paper</span>, adopting the editorial pen-name Helena B. Temple. Claimed to be the only paper in the world conducted, printed, and published entirely by women, the <span class="italic">Women's Penny Paper</span> covered a range of issues of interest to women. It has been described by David Doughan and Denise Sanchez as exhibiting an &#145;uncompromising feminism&#146;, unequalled by any other journal of the period  (Burton, 303).<br>
<br>Throughout the 1880s M&uuml;ller's heart was in the &#145;woman's movement&#146;. Around 1890, however, she &#145;gradually withdrew from civic efforts&#146; and embarked upon a spiritual quest. She joined the Theosophical Society about 1891, drawn by its ideas of universal brotherhood and complementary male and female aspects to the spirit. In 1892 she travelled to India on a lecture tour on behalf of the Theosophists. The original plan was that she would accompany Annie Besant, but Besant cancelled at the last minute, so M&uuml;ller went alone. Both Besant and M&uuml;ller attended the Parliament on Religions in Chicago in September 1893, where M&uuml;ller addressed the Theosophical Congress. Touring Ceylon and India in November 1893, this time with Besant, M&uuml;ller's lectures drew crowds of Indian women, mostly in purdah, who had come to see &#145;the renowned woman-suffragist&#146;  (Nethercot, <span class="italic">Last Four Lives</span>, 17). For the first time, the Indian section of the Theosophical Society allowed Indian women to attend its convention, where M&uuml;ller was also present. Many articles on Indian women appeared in the <span class="italic">Women's Penny Paper</span> before it ceased publication in 1893.<br>
<br>At the Parliament of Religions in 1893 M&uuml;ller met Swami Vivekananda, who in 1897 founded the Ramakrishna mission. This combined India's traditional spiritual disciplines with western-style philanthropy, and it is to this mission that M&uuml;ller transferred her energies. She edited <span class="italic">The Yoga of Christ, or, The Science of the Soul</span> (1894) and Vivekananda's <span class="italic">From Columba to Almora</span> (1897). M. S. Kilgour writes in her obituary in the <span class="italic">Girton Review</span> (Lent term, 1906) that &#145;She spent many years in India, during part of this time living as a native among the natives in the hills. Wherever she went she sought to study not only the religion of the people, but the position held by women &hellip; and in some of the most secluded parts of India she had a measure of encouragement among the natives, and was able to secure in some degree better treatment for the women.&#146; In 1895 she adopted a young Bengali man, hoping he would study law and become a politician dedicated to reform.<br>
<br>M&uuml;ller subsequently lived in China and America, maintaining a permanent address at the Westminster Palace Hotel in London. She died on 4 January 1906 in Washington, DC. Her will of 1897 left personal effects worth &pound;12,750 to her sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56261/', "Eva McLaren")</script>; there was no mention of the adopted son. In 1912 Eva McLaren gave &pound;500 in memory of her sister to Girton College, to which M&uuml;ller had in her lifetime given furniture and drawings by John Varley.<br>
<br>As a feminist, M&uuml;ller's writings reveal a characteristic mixture of Victorian sexual essentialism and hard-hitting analysis of male power. This approach fed tactically into dominant ideologies but brought M&uuml;ller up against fierce opposition: she was accused of being a &#145;man-hater&#146;. Her campaigns, ideas, and subsequent withdrawal into spirituality have many parallels among later feminists, and her disappearance from historical record is typical for a woman whose life contained hard lessons for the men and women of her own and later generations.<br>
