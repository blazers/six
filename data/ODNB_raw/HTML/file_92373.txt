<span class="headword">Foster <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Brown]</span>,  Audrey Pellew  Hylton-</span>, Baroness Hylton-Foster  (1908&#150;2002), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 19 May 1908 in Simla, India, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32105/', "Douglas Clifton Brown, later Viscount Ruffside (1879&#150;1958)")</script>, politician, and his wife, Violet Cicely Kathleen (<i>d</i>. 1969), only daughter of Frederick Eustace Arbuthnott Wollaston, of Shenton Hall, Leicestershire. At the time of her birth her father was an officer in the 1st King's dragoon guards. He became Conservative MP for Hexham in 1918, and served as speaker of the House of Commons from 1943 to 1951. Audrey Clifton Brown was educated at St George's, Ascot, but was expelled from there during the First World War after being found in a cupboard spying on one of her teachers, whom she suspected of being a German agent. She completed her education at Ivy House, Wimbledon. On 22 December 1931 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34087/', "Harry Braustyn Hylton Hylton-Foster (1905&#150;1965)")</script>. At the time of their marriage he was working as a barrister. He was later Conservative MP for York (1950&#150;59) and the Cities of London and Westminster (1959&#150;65), was knighted in 1954, and served as speaker of the House of Commons from 1959 until his death in 1965. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Audrey Hylton-Foster worked as a nurse at St Luke's Hospital, Chelsea. She stayed with her parents at Speaker's House after the war while convalescing from measles. During this time she began working for the British Red Cross and found a lifetime vocation. She became director of the Chelsea division in 1950, then president and chairman of the London branch from 1960 to 1983 (and patron thereafter). By the time she retired as chairman she had cycled thousands of miles around London on her Red Cross duties.<br>
<br>Audrey Hylton-Foster was a loyal political wife and frequently listened to debates in the House of Commons while her husband was in the chair, but she showed no signs of political ambition while he was alive. Indeed in 1960 she was quoted as saying that she could not understand why women became MPs. &#145;I cannot think why they do it&#146;, she was reported as saying. &#145;Women don't have enough education to become politicians&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, 11 April 1960). The Labour MP Emrys Hughes raised the matter in the Commons as a breach of parliamentary privilege, and an embarrassed Speaker Hylton-Foster had to rule on his wife's conduct. He decided no breach had occurred, and she subsequently claimed that she had been misquoted.<br>
<br>On retirement speakers of the House of Commons are traditionally granted a peerage, and it was to Harold Wilson's credit that Audrey Hylton-Foster was sent to the Lords (as Baroness Hylton-Foster of the City of Westminster) in place of her husband, who died unexpectedly while still in office. She sat as a cross-bencher, and spoke occasionally on matters relating to healthcare and voluntary organizations. In 1974 she became convenor of the cross-bench peers, succeeding Lord Strang, who had acted as &#145;co-ordinator&#146; of the cross-bench peers. She held this post until 1995, during which time the cross-bench peers grew enormously in number and influence. Baroness Hylton-Foster was extremely effective in welding them into a formidable force, in winning time and facilities for them, and in mastering the rules of the House of Lords in order to defend their interests. As a result the cross-benchers were courted both by the established parties and by pressure groups, and at times held the balance in the second chamber. She was immensely proud of the traditions of the House of Lords and its role in the democratic process, and would refer to members of the House of Commons as &#145;rowdy people&#146;. She expected high standards of parliamentary behaviour from her own flock, and those who offended (for example by whispering in the chamber, or other forms of petty rule-breaking) would be upbraided for what she called &#145;naughtiness&#146;. Her fellow cross-benchers often referred to her (behind her back) as their &#145;headmistress&#146;, but like all good headmistresses she was held in respect and affection.<br>
<br>Small, increasingly deaf in old age, and apparently meek, Audrey Hylton-Foster nevertheless possessed a steely resolve and abundant energy. She continued to climb the forty-six stairs to her office into her late eighties, and even after her retirement as convenor of the cross-bench peers she continued to attend debates. She was an avid stamp collector (as was her husband), but her two greatest passions were for fishing (usually in Scotland) and gardening; she and her husband created a beautiful garden at their home, the Coach House, Tanhurst Lane, Leith Hill, Holmbury St Mary, Dorking, Surrey, and it was typical that when she took leave of absence from the House of Lords at the age of ninety-two she chose shrubs and trees for this garden as a gift from her cross-bench friends. She died at home on 31 October 2002, of heart failure. A memorial service was held in the chapel of St Mary Undercroft in the Palace of Westminster on 3 April 2003.<br>
