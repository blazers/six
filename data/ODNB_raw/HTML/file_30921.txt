<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Trench,  Anthony  Chenevix-</span>  (1919&#150;1979), <span class="occ">headmaster</span>, was born at Kasauli in the Punjab, India, on 10 May 1919, the youngest of four sons (there were no daughters) of Charles Godfrey Chenevix-Trench (1877&#150;1964), revenue commissioner in the Indian Civil Service, and his wife, Margaret May (1888&#150;1981), daughter of John Holmes Blakesley, engineer, of The Avenue, Kew Gardens, London.<br>
<br>The Chenevix-Trenches were of French Huguenot stock who settled in Ireland at the end of the seventeenth century from where they achieved considerable renown in ecclesiastical and military circles; none more so than Richard Trench who was appointed archbishop of Dublin in 1864. It was Anthony's father who broke with family tradition by opting for the Indian Civil Service, becoming a much revered figure among the inhabitants of Udaipur. His love of learning and sense of duty duly left their mark upon his children. Introduced to Herodotus at the age of six, Anthony Chenevix-Trench developed a great love for the classics, already evident at Highfield School in Liphook, Hampshire, where he was a pupil from 1927 to 1932. His ability to construct Greek sentences earned him the envy of his fellow pupil Ludovic Kennedy, the writer and broadcaster.<br>
<br>In March 1932, three months before his thirteenth birthday, Chenevix-Trench followed in the footsteps of all three of his brothers by winning a scholarship to Shrewsbury School. Here he continued his effortless rise, gaining a scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford, aged sixteen. He was, according to his esteemed classics master, Jimmy Street, the best pupil he ever taught during his forty-four years at the school. He proceeded to Christ Church in 1937 and the plaudits continued. He gained a first class in classical honour moderations (1939) before the outbreak of the Second World War.<br>
<br>In September 1939 Chenevix-Trench joined the Royal Artillery and was seconded to the 4th mountain battery, frontier force, Indian artillery 22nd mountain regiment. As a senior subaltern he struck up an excellent relationship with his Indian troops, facilitated by his quick mastery of Urdu, and distinguished himself in the retreat through Malaya against the advancing Japanese armies. One of 85,000 imperial troops to surrender at Singapore in February 1942 he was sent to work on the infamous Burma Railway in 1943. There, in the most brutal and degrading conditions imaginable, he proved a fount of inspiration to his fellow captives, translating A. E. Housman's <span class="italic">Shropshire Lad</span> into Latin and entertaining them with a series of talks on Greek literature.<br>
<br>On his release in 1945 Chenevix-Trench returned to Oxford and was runner-up in the Craven and Ireland scholarships in 1946 before obtaining a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1947), with alpha marks in every paper. In January 1948 he accepted an invitation to return to Shrewsbury and in no time established a reputation as a brilliantly inspiring teacher, instilling in his pupils a true appreciation of the ancient civilizations. During the vintage year of 1950&#150;51 ten members of the Shrewsbury classical sixth gained open awards to Oxford or Cambridge.<br>
<br>In 1951 Chenevix-Trench's old tutor, R. H. Dundas, inveigled him back to Christ Church as a classics don but, finding the experience of tutoring undergraduates a more remote and arid one than teaching slightly younger students, he lasted only a year. The housemastership of School House, Shrewsbury, unexpectedly became open and for Chenevix-Trench the opportunity of returning to his old house took precedence over a chance to become headmaster of Charterhouse. At Shrewsbury between 1952 and 1955 his gregarious informality, his deep understanding of boys, and his compassion for those in trouble won him many admirers, although the goodwill was tempered by his unhealthy addiction to corporal punishment, a trait later exposed by one of his former pupils, Paul Foot, in the satirical magazine <span class="italic">Private Eye</span>. Why such an essentially humane person should on occasions abuse this standard punishment for the time has never been properly explained. What is irrefutable is that his continued dependence on beating when its legitimacy was increasingly being called into question severely undermined his credibility; a point all too readily illustrated by the furore caused by the publication in 1994 of <span class="italic">Eton Renewed</span>, a modern history of the college, which partially attributed Chenevix-Trench's demise there in 1970 to his predilection for beating.<br>
<br>It was during his time at Shrewsbury that Chenevix-Trench married in 1953 Elizabeth Chalmers (1925&#150;1991), a teacher, eldest daughter of Captain Stewart Dykes Spicer RN. A kind, hospitable person, she willingly supported him both at Shrewsbury and during his subsequent three headmasterships, enabling him to keep open house for all comers. They had twin daughters, and two sons.<br>
<br>In 1955 Chenevix-Trench finally succumbed to the overtures of governing bodies up and down the country by becoming headmaster of Bradfield College, Berkshire, and there now followed the most fulfilling years of his career as he flourished in this arcadian idyll. Eschewing the traditional role of the headmaster as a distant autocrat, he continued to place the interests of the pupils first, teaching, tutoring, and befriending them whenever possible. His enthusiasm, his personal support, combined with his overriding commitment to high academic standards, galvanized the school into raising its sights and acquiring unprecedented prestige in educational circles.<br>
<br>It was against this background of achievement at Bradfield, alongside his membership of the Robbins committee which in 1963 advocated the expansion of higher education, that Chenevix-Trench was appointed headmaster of Eton College as successor to Robert Birley in January 1964 with a view to pouring new wine into old bottles. For the Eton which Chenevix-Trench inherited had changed little in the twentieth century and now, in a less deferential age, the need to transform an &eacute;lite based on birth to one based on merit was paramount. That much was done to accomplish this at Eton during the next seven years is a measure of his influence. On arrival he oversaw a major review of the curriculum, bringing it into the mainstream of GCE, A and O-level studies and achieving unprecedented success in open scholarships at Oxford and Cambridge. At the same time the arts were encouraged, the facilities upgraded, chapel reformed, social services begun, discipline relaxed, and horizons broadened. &#145;This is the modern Eton&#146;, enthused the <span class="italic">Eton Chronicle</span>, the influential college weekly periodical, in June 1970: &#145;A school which utilises its facilities to encourage self expression while by no means neglecting its duties as a trainer of the mind and preparer for national exams.&#146; Other independent bodies returned similar verdicts. A BBC documentary in 1965 portrayed the college in a fairly flattering light and the press was supportive of his innovatory agenda.<br>
<br>Despite these undoubted successes Chenevix-Trench's leadership attracted substantial criticism, particularly from those within the college hierarchy who felt that he lacked the <i>gravitas</i> expected in an Eton headmaster. Apart from his diminutive stature (Eton headmasters, notwithstanding the renowned Dr John Keate, are traditionally imposing figures) and his dishevelled appearance, they particularly objected to his administrative laxity, and reluctance to follow a consistent line on discipline. On top of this his lack of physical stamina, the legacy of his wartime experiences, his weakness for alcohol, and his penchant for beating were further causes for concern. In March 1969 he was informed by the provost, Lord Caccia, that the academic year ending in July 1970 would be his last. His dismissal was well handled but the damage to his self-esteem was considerable.<br>
<br>In September 1971 Chenevix-Trench became headmaster of Fettes College, Edinburgh, a school of similar size to Bradfield. Back in more familiar surroundings he was in his element and won much support for his reforms which helped usher in a more tranquil period in the school's history after the turbulence of the 1960s. Numbers increased from 420 to 530; girls in the sixth form, first introduced in 1970, became an established component; and a junior school was opened in 1973. It was only during his final years when he was dogged by ill health that his liberal tendencies (beating aside) became something of a liability. He died at his home, The Lodge, Fettes College, 2 Carrington Road, Edinburgh, on 21 June 1979, weeks before his retirement, from a severe internal haemorrhage in his intestine, related to nutritional deprivations in his wartime captivity. His remains were cremated at Warriston crematorium, Edinburgh, on 25 June.<br>
