<span class="headword">Thrupp,  Frederick</span>  (1812&#150;1895), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 20 June 1812 at Paddington Green, Middlesex, the youngest son of Joseph Thrupp (<i>d</i>. 1821), a coachmaker, and his second wife, Mary Pillow (<i>d</i>. 1845). The family had been settled for many years near Worcester, but Joseph Thrupp moved to London about 1765, and from 1774 managed a coach factory in George Street, near Grosvenor Square. Frederick went to the Revd W. Greenlaw's school at Blackheath, Kent, and then attended Henry Sass's academy in Bloomsbury. In 1829 he won a silver medal from the Society of Arts for a chalk drawing from a bust, and on 14 June 1830 he was admitted to the Royal Academy Schools. Thrupp first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1832, when he showed <span class="italic">The Prodigal Returned</span>, and thereafter he exhibited there regularly until 1880. He also showed at the British Institution between 1837 and 1862.<br>
<br>On 15 February 1837 Thrupp started for Rome, accompanied by James Uwins, nephew of the painter Thomas Uwins, and arrived there on 17 March. He soon involved himself in the international community of artists in the city: he made the acquaintance of the Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen and formed lasting friendships with the British sculptors William Theed (1804&#150;1891) and R. J. Wyatt and the painters Joseph Severn, Penry Williams, and Edward Lear. He also received advice and encouragement from the sculptor John Gibson, who is said to have admired his statue <span class="italic">Ferdinand</span> (1837) and who obtained several commissions for him.<br>
<br>Thrupp returned to London in October 1842 and bought a house at 232 New Road, where he built a large gallery and studio. He remained at the family home, 15 Paddington Green, until his mother's death in 1845, after which he moved with two of his sisters to New Road. In 1844 he showed two works at the exhibition held in Westminster Hall to choose sculptors to design statuary for the new houses of parliament: three years later he received commissions for two figures of Robert, earl of Oxford, and Robert Fitzwalter for the chamber of the House of Lords, which he executed in electroplated zinc. In 1846 he had been commissioned to produce the marble statue of Sir Fowell Buxton in Westminster Abbey. Thrupp's success, however, was marred by rumours of favouritism following the competition held for the monument, as one of the judges was the sculptor's close friend, the painter George Richmond. His most prestigious public commission was the Wordsworth memorial (marble; 1854), also for Westminster Abbey. His design was chosen from a field of forty-two competing entries, though this decision too courted controversy, for according to the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> his model was removed from the competition &#145;as soon as the decision was declared, without the other competitors having had an opportunity of seeing it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 13, 1851, 222). In 1855 he executed a marble figure, <span class="italic">Timon of Athens</span>, one of a series of statues illustrating national history and literature installed in Mansion House, London. His church monuments included those to Jane, Lady Coleridge (marble; 1879), at St Mary's Church, Ottery St Mary, Devon, and the effigy of Canon Hugh Pearson (marble; 1883) at Sonning church, Berkshire.<br>
<br>Thrupp made a speciality of sculpture in relief, the subjects of which he often conceived in series or cycles following Renaissance models. His pair of bronze doors with ten panels illustrating <span class="italic">The Pilgrim's Progress</span> (exh. RA, 1868) was purchased by the ninth duke of Bedford and in 1876 presented to the Bunyan Chapel in Bedford. Another pair of doors with bronze panels illustrating George Herbert's poems (exh. RA, 1878) is in the Divinity School in Cambridge.<br>
<br>Many of Thrupp's ideal works reflect his deeply held Christian beliefs, including <span class="italic">A Magdalene</span> (exh. RA, 1841), <span class="italic">The Good Shepherd</span> (marble, 1861, Torre Abbey, Devon), and <span class="italic">St John Blessing Little Children</span> (exh. RA, 1875). Others treat themes from classical mythology, for example, <span class="italic">Arethusa</span> and <span class="italic">Hebe and the Eagle</span>, and English literature, as in <span class="italic">Ariel</span>. Although many of these were never made in permanent form (marble or bronze), their appearance is known from the large collection of the sculptor's plaster models, terracotta maquettes, and drawings which are now preserved at Torre Abbey, Torquay, Devon. These preliminary designs are a rare survival, and they show that Thrupp was a skilful draughtsman and modeller of form with an eclectic and often highly original approach to his subject matter. His drawings and clay sketches from life and his studies of animals are particularly sensitive and well observed.<br>
<br>Late in life, on 11 July 1885, Thrupp married Sarah Harriet Ann Frances (1845&#150;1916), the eldest daughter of John Thurgar of Norwich and Algiers. He spent the winter of 1885&#150;6 in Algiers and in the following year stayed at San Remo, Italy, and visited the Pyrenees. In 1889 he visited Antwerp, Brussels, and Cologne. In 1887 he had left London and moved to Torquay. He had a house in Upton, Devon, and frequented the art school at the Vivian Institute. The years 1892&#150;4 were spent in negotiations for the ultimate disposal of the works from his studio. He loaned a large part of his studio collection to the corporation of Winchester in 1894 and on 8 November a Thrupp gallery was opened in the eighteenth-century Abbey House.<br>
<br>Failing eyesight, followed by paralysis agitans in 1893, compelled Thrupp to abandon active work. He died of influenza and pneumonia at Thurlow, Torquay, on 21 March 1895 and was buried on 26 March in Torquay cemetery. He bequeathed to his wife all his property, including his remaining works, which, in accordance with his wishes, were presented to the city of Winchester. In 1911, however, the works were returned to the sculptor's widow, who presented the collection, in two instalments in 1911 and 1916, to Torquay corporation. The collection was subsequently stored and parts of it displayed in various locations in the town (including the Free Library and the Marine Spa) until it was transferred to Torre Abbey in 1930&#150;32.<br>
<br>In addition to his work as a sculptor, Thrupp designed and engraved an edition (1879) of Milton's <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> and illustrated in lithography Coleridge's <span class="italic">The Ancient Mariner</span> and Byron's <span class="italic">The Prisoner of Chillon</span>. He was the author of <span class="italic">The Angelic Nature</span> (1879) and <span class="italic">The Antient Mariner and the Modern Sportsman</span> (1881), two essays in which he discussed his Christian beliefs in relation to art, poetry, and cruel sports.<br>
<br>Frederick Thrupp's half-sister <a name="cosubject_27396"></a><span class="headword">Dorothea Ann Thrupp</span>  (1779&#150;1847), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 20 June 1779 in London, the eldest daughter of Joseph Thrupp and his first wife, Mary Burgon (<i>d</i>. 1795). She contributed under the signature Iota to juvenile magazines edited by Caroline Fry. She wrote several hymns; one, &#145;A Little Ship on the Sea&#146;, was a great favourite with children. She also published some manuals, including <span class="italic">Songs by the Way</span> and <span class="italic">Thoughts for the Day</span> (1836&#150;7), and translations from Pascal and F&eacute;nelon. She died at Hamilton Place, St John's Wood, London, in November 1847.<br>
