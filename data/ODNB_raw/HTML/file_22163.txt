<span class="headword">Phillips,  John</span>  (1800&#150;1874), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born on 25 December 1800 at Marden, Wiltshire, the second of the four children of John Phillips (1769&#150;1808), excise officer, and his wife, Elizabeth (1772&#150;1808), daughter of John Smith, blacksmith, of Churchill, Oxfordshire. Orphaned at the age of seven, Phillips was brought up by his uncle, William Smith (1769&#150;1839), later dubbed the &#145;father of English geology&#146;. From 1809 to 1814 Phillips attended Holt Spa School, Wiltshire. In 1814 Smith sent Phillips to study for a year with Benjamin Richardson, rector of Farleigh Hungerford, Wiltshire, who expanded the boy's interest in science. The next year Phillips went to London where he helped his uncle in geological work and trained under him as a land surveyor. From 1817 to 1819 he accompanied Smith on surveying expeditions, but in 1819 Smith was imprisoned for debt and relinquished his London home. After this disaster Smith and Phillips wandered for four years from 1820 in the north of England, where they combined surveying with work on Smith's county geological maps including that of Yorkshire (1821).<br>
<br>In 1824 the Yorkshire Philosophical Society invited Smith to give a course of lectures on geology in York. Having assisted his uncle, Phillips shared subsequent courses with him elsewhere and launched himself as a solo lecturer. Phillips was so adept in arranging the fossils in the Yorkshire Museum that in 1825 he was appointed its keeper and made York his home. Now separated from Smith, Phillips established himself as a successful lecturer and, with <span class="italic">Geology of the Yorkshire Coast</span> (1829), in which he showed himself as a creative and not slavish pupil of his uncle, as the leading expert on the subject. As the right-hand man of William Vernon Harcourt, the key figure in the Yorkshire Philosophical Society, Phillips took a leading part in 1831 in organizing at York the first meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Next year he was appointed its assistant secretary, an office he held for thirty years. As administrator of the association's meetings and editor of its <span class="italic">Reports</span> he made many contacts usually denied to the isolated provincial. Encouraged by London savants, Phillips stormed the capital: elected FRS in 1834, he assumed the chair of geology at King's College, London, that year, lectured extensively, contributed to the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Metropolitana</span>, the <span class="italic">Penny Cyclopaedia</span>, and Lardner's <span class="italic">Cabinet Cyclopaedia</span>, and brought out with Longman three editions of his <span class="italic">Guide to Geology</span> in the 1830s. In 1836 Phillips increased his reputation with his monograph on the Carboniferous limestone of Yorkshire in which he escaped from the limitations of fossil-labelling of strata, as practised by his uncle and Roderick Murchison, by taking preliminary steps towards a statistical palaeontology based on the number and distribution of fossil species.<br>
<br>While his career in London and York was prospering, Phillips worked voluntarily for the Geological Survey from 1836 to 1838, when he began to be paid on a temporary contract to draw and describe for the survey the fossils of Cornwall, Devon, and west Somerset. The resulting monograph, <span class="italic">Palaeozoic Fossils</span> (1841), also his chief contribution to the Devonian controversy, denounced the notion that there were well-defined geological systems such as the Devonian so dear to Murchison, revealed a more developed statistical palaeontology, and proposed that there were three great periods of past life on earth called the Palaeozoic, the Mesozoic, and the Cainozoic, terms still used over 150 years later. It led to Phillips's being employed as palaeontologist to the survey, full-time for two-thirds of the year, in 1841. He resigned his London chair in 1839 and his York keepership in 1840. Late in 1843 Phillips was appointed to the new chair of geology and mineralogy at Trinity College, Dublin. In anticipation of his becoming the first director of the new Irish branch of the geological survey, in 1844 Edward Forbes succeeded him as palaeontologist to the survey, but when its director, De la Beche, failed to implement the Irish scheme, Phillips resigned in 1845 from his Dublin chair and had to accept demotion in the survey. Though he received the accolade of the Wollaston medal of the Geological Society of London in 1845 and showed his continuing originality in his survey memoir on the Malvern hills (1848), which combined statistical palaeontology with notions about the flexing, fracturing, and mingling of strata, he resigned from the survey in 1849.<br>
<br>After four years based in York, in 1853 Phillips was called to Oxford to be deputy reader in geology. In 1856 he was made reader in geology and in 1860 professor. He was also keeper of the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, in 1854&#150;70 and from 1857 to his death keeper of the new University Museum, which he helped to plan and arrange. An experienced curator, a fluent lecturer, an excellent organizer, an accomplished textbook writer, a distinguished researcher whose view of geology was exceptionally wide, and a savant whose interests embraced meteorology, astronomy, terrestrial magnetism, and instruments, he soon became the unifying president of science in the university and the leading spirit in the Ashmolean Society. A keen lunar astronomer from 1852, Phillips catalysed the first stage of the founding of the university observatory in 1875. His general cultivation and engaging manners did much to reduce the suspicion of science in Oxford. Nationally he was prominent as president of the Geological Society 1858&#150;60 and as president of the British Association in 1865. Though devastated by the death of his sister Ann (1803&#150;1862), his housekeeper from 1829, the veteran bachelor published, when seventy, his highly regarded monograph <span class="italic">The Geology of Oxford and the Thames Valley</span> (1871). A devout Anglican, Phillips opposed Darwinian evolution. In his <span class="italic">Life on Earth</span> (1860) he reaffirmed his belief in divine design, the reality of species, the relative novelty of humans, and a reverential reading of the book of geological strata. Convinced that Darwin had exaggerated the incompleteness of the fossil record, Phillips believed that its discontinuities were explicable only in terms of separate creations which were transcendental and inscrutable acts of God. He was happy to help William Thomson attack Darwin's views on the age of the earth and unhappy with Lyell's advocacy of the antiquity of man.<br>
<br>The occasion of his death showed that Phillips, a scientific Dick Whittington, had achieved the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of distinction: he fell downstairs at All Souls College, Oxford, after dinner and died the next day, 24 April 1874. The epitome of the assiduous and triumphant provincial of humble birth, Phillips was buried in style. On 29 April a procession of 150 mourners accompanied his coffin from the University Museum to Oxford railway station. After lying overnight in the Yorkshire Museum, Phillips was buried in York, as he wished, on 30 April 1874, with the Great Peter bell of the minster tolling in tribute for ninety minutes.<br>
