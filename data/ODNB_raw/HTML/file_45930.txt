<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Barberi,  Domenico Giovanni Luigi</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Dominic of the Mother of God]</span>  (1792&#150;1849), <span class="occ">Passionist priest</span>, was born at Pallanzana, near Viterbo, then in the Papal States, on 22 June 1792. He was the youngest of the eight children, five boys and three girls, of Giuseppe Barberi (<i>d</i>. 1798), a small farmer, and Maria Antonia (<i>d</i>. 1803) <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pacelli. After the death of his mother he was brought up at Merlano by his uncle Bartolomeo Pacelli, who intended him to become a farmer and his heir, and to marry.<br>
<br>At the age of twenty Barberi decided to join the Congregation of Discalced Clerks of the Most Holy Cross and Passion, an order founded by St Paul of the Cross in the 1720s in devotion to the sufferings of Christ. In 1814, while he was a lay postulant at Sant' Angelo at Vetralla, a retreat house of the congregation, he received what he believed to be a divine call to undertake missionary work in England. Barberi was without formal education, but his superior noted his knowledge of the <span class="roman">Vulgate</span>, and he was clothed not as a lay novice but as a cleric at Santa Maria di Pugliano near Paliano on 14 November 1814. He made his vows on 15 November 1815 and was ordained priest on 1 March 1818. In 1821 he was appointed lector of scholastic philosophy at Vetralla. From 1826 he taught theology and philosophy at the Passionist house in Rome. Much of his writing dates from this period; his unpublished works in the Passionist archives run to 180 titles and 100 volumes, including sermons, devotional works, a tract against the revolutionaries of 1831, and an entire course of philosophy in 1557 pages.<br>
<br>In 1830 Barberi was asked to teach the Cornish convert ordinand Sir Harry Trelawney, who was visiting Italy, to say mass. Two other English converts to Catholicism, the Hon. George Spencer, who later became a Passionist, and the Leicestershire squire Ambrose Phillipps De Lisle, who founded Mount St Bernard's Cistercian monastery, refired Barberi's dream of converting England; De Lisle, who was equally struck by meeting Barberi for the first time in 1828, later translated and published Barberi's <span class="italic">Lament of England</span> (1831), a threnody on the lost glories of the Catholic church in England in the style of <span class="roman">Jeremiah</span>. Barberi was appointed rector of a new foundation at Lucca in 1831, and in 1833 the general chapter of the order referred to its next meeting his plea for an English foundation; he was elected provincial for three years of the Passionist southern province of the Sorrowful Virgin. He became first consultor in 1836, and gave heroic service in Ceprano in the Campagna during the cholera epidemic of 1837, when he also completed a commentary on the <span class="roman">Song of Solomon</span>.<br>
<br>In 1838 De Lisle and Spencer began among the French clergy a campaign of prayer for the conversion of England. In 1839 the Passionist general chapter accepted for &#145;an opportune time&#146; a memorial drawn up by Monsignor Charles Acton and presented by Barberi asking for an English Passionist foundation. Barberi was elected provincial again in 1839, but was then chosen to head a new Belgian foundation in the Ch&acirc;teau d'&Egrave;re; on 26 May 1840 he left Italy for ever.<br>
<br>Barberi first landed in England on 27 November 1840, after being offered Aston Hall, Staffordshire, by Bishop Walsh of the central district through his assistant Nicholas Wiseman, president of Oscott. Leaving the Belgian community in 1841, Barberi moved on 17 February 1842 into Aston Hall. A church was opened in nearby Stone in 1844, in the teeth of protestant opposition: Barberi was no beauty, short and stocky, with bushy eyebrows and piercing eyes, and his Passionist habit, with its emblem of a heart and cross, was a provocation in itself. Many Catholics were also repelled by this holy fool. His preaching in Britain, on scores of missions and retreats, his principal activity apart from his work as superior, combined fluency and wit with a poor command of English pronunciation, which both edified and amused, though the story that he told a convent of nuns: &#145;without face it is impossible to be shaved&#146; is probably apocryphal. He also urged a congregation to become saints, &#145;but not canonized ones: it costs too much&#146;  (Wilson, 345). In 1841 he published &#145;To the professors of the University of Oxford&#146; in response to a letter in <span class="italic">L'Univers</span> from John Dobr&eacute;e Dalgairns, whom in 1845 he received into the church. He had no direct forewarning of the most famous action of his life: on 8 October 1845, dripping wet from a coach journey from Aston on his way to Belgium, he received John Henry Newman's submission to Rome at Littlemore. He admitted Newman to the church the next day.<br>
<br>At the request of the convert William Leigh, Barberi made another foundation in 1846 at Northfield House, Woodchester, where the new church was designed by Charles Hansom; the Dominicans succeeded the Passionists in 1850. The first London foundation of the order was established at Poplar House, Hampstead, in 1848. Barberi died of a heart attack at the Railway tavern, Reading, on 27 August 1849. His body was buried at Aston, but was taken to Cotton Hall in 1855 and later in the same year to his last foundation, St Anne's, Sutton, where it remained incorrupt until 1886. Spencer was buried beside him.<br>
<br>A mystic who experienced visions and had a wide reputation for sanctity, Barberi's life and its central enthusiasm, the conversion of England, touched the major figures of the early Victorian Catholic revival in England as well as many unknown Catholics in Staffordshire, London, and elsewhere. His posthumously published writings include <span class="italic">La divina paraninfa</span> (1860), <span class="italic">L'Anima fedele guidata da Jesu</span> (1877), <span class="italic">Excellence de Marie</span> (translated into French by Canon Francis Labis, 1899), <span class="italic">Il gemito della Colomba</span> (1954), and <span class="italic">Autobiography</span> (1959). He was beatified on 27 October 1963.<br>
