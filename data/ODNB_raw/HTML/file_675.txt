<span class="headword">Arnold,  Benedict</span>  (1741&#150;1801), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 14 January 1741 in the river town of Norwich, Connecticut, the elder of two surviving children of six born to Benedict Arnold (<i>d</i>. 1761), a cooper and merchant, and Hannah Waterman King, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hannah Waterman (1706&#150;1759), widow of Absalom King, a merchant. Much of the frequently cited evidence for Arnold's childhood is suspect, having been created after his notorious treason in 1780. His great-great-grandfather Benedict Arnold had succeeded Roger Williams as governor of the Rhode Island colony, but the Arnold family had struggled economically in the eighteenth century. By marrying the widow of a successful Norwich merchant his father had done fairly well until, following the deaths of two young daughters within a few weeks in 1753, he succumbed to alcoholism, and the family fortunes declined rapidly. From 1752 to 1755 Arnold attended grammar school at nearby Canterbury. After the deaths of his mother in 1759 and his father in 1761, the young Benedict was dependent on charitable cousins, who accepted him as an apprentice in the apothecary trade and aided him in establishing a business in the coastal town of New Haven in 1762. He was not tall, but strongly built.<br>
<br>In New Haven, Arnold succeeded as a merchant sea captain, trading mainly in horses and other livestock with Canada and the West Indies. In 1766 he emerged in local politics when he led the New Haven Sons of Liberty against a former crewman who had informed against him for smuggling. At least twice during voyages he fought duels, and at home he earned a reputation as a free-spending roughneck. On 27 February 1767 he married Margaret Mansfield (1745&#150;1775), daughter of the New Haven sheriff; they had three sons. Soon after his marriage he moved his sister Hannah from Norwich to look after his new family. Peggy Arnold, about whom little is known, was ensconced in a handsome waterfront house but seems to have been dominated by her resident sister-in-law. Soon her husband, who was away trading in the West Indies, was being denounced for whoring as well as smuggling.<br>
<br>In 1774, as the imperial crisis peaked, Arnold was elected captain of an &eacute;lite company of New Haven militia. At the news of war in Massachusetts, he seized powder and shot from the town magazine and marched his men without orders to Boston. In his travels to Canada, Arnold had seen the weakness of the British forts on Lake Champlain at Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and he soon persuaded the Massachusetts committee of safety to order him, with the rank of colonel, to capture the forts and bring their badly needed cannon to Boston. Although empowered to lead 400 men, Arnold had no troops when he met two rival parties. One was from Connecticut, and another was a large contingent of &#145;Green Mountain boys&#146; led by Ethan Allen; they had similar plans.<br>
<br>Arnold and Allen managed to co-operate in capturing the weakly defended Ticonderoga and its sister fort at Crown Point, but Arnold was soon embroiled in disputes with agents of both the Massachusetts and Connecticut colonies. After learning that his wife had died aged thirty, he returned to Boston. The new commander of American forces, George Washington, accepted his offer to command a force in the proposed attack on Canada. In eleven weeks Arnold led more than a thousand men from Boston up the Kennebec River, through the Maine wilderness, and down the fast-flowing Chaudi&egrave;re to the St Lawrence, opposite the city of Quebec. Arriving exhausted, famished, and in rags, they had lost a third of their number on the march and had covered more than 500 miles. Help from sympathetic Canadians restored them, and they joined the main force under a former British officer, Richard Montgomery, who had advanced down Lake Champlain and taken Montreal. With a combined force barely larger than the garrison of Quebec under the British governor Guy Carleton, who declined their summons to surrender, Montgomery and Arnold attacked the city at night in a snowstorm at the end of December. The attack failed, Montgomery was killed, and Arnold was wounded in the left leg. From that point the American invasion disintegrated until melting ice in the river allowed a British fleet with reinforcements to arrive in early May 1776. Meanwhile, the American congress in Philadelphia had promoted Arnold brigadier-general, though he was no longer in command of the American army in Canada. As British troops, Canadian militia, and their Indian allies, aided by an epidemic of smallpox, swept the American remnants southwards, Arnold resumed an active role. Determined to stop Carleton's advance up the Champlain corridor, he worked furiously through the summer to build a small fleet of vessels at Ticonderoga. Early in October, Arnold's fleet met the much larger and more heavily armed British flotilla at Valcour Island, at the northern end of the lake. Defeated, Arnold managed to slip away with several American vessels after nightfall and in a running fight to reach shelter at Crown Point.<br>
<br>Arnold's first two campaigns were military failures, but they may well have delayed a British attempt to attack the rebellion from Canada until 1777, buying a vital year to avert total defeat to the south, where the war under Washington for the most part had gone badly. But Arnold's aggressive, contentious behaviour had made enemies, whose accusations, mostly false or exaggerated, had reached congress. In Connecticut on his way to Philadelphia to answer various charges, he led a militia force against a damaging British raid on the American base at Danbury. His horse shot from under him, Arnold barely escaped with his life. Informed of his latest heroism, congress promoted him major-general and brushed aside the charges, but Arnold, with Washington's support, still pressed for a restoration of the seniority he had lost by belated promotion.<br>
<br>The American congress, sensitive to its authority over the army, rebuffed Arnold's clumsy attempts to lobby the delegates, and ordered him back to the field. Disgusted, Arnold submitted his resignation just as Washington was asking that he be sent to the northern army, which faced a major British attack from Canada. Arnold's exact role in the Saratoga campaign of 1777, which ended with the capitulation of a British field army and a Franco-American alliance, is disputed among historians, but ample evidence shows that it was important, perhaps vital, to American victory. In August, soon after his arrival at Albany, Arnold led a large detachment in driving off a secondary force of British regulars, loyalists, and Indians attacking from the west, down the Mohawk valley. Returned to the main army, he goaded its commander, Horatio Gates, into a more active defence by leading attacks on advancing British forces, under Lieutenant-General John Burgoyne, near Saratoga. In the last of these he suffered a severe wound in the left leg, shattered under his fallen horse. While Gates claimed all credit for the British defeat, Arnold languished in an Albany hospital, often in great pain and rebuffing medical advice to amputate his wounded leg; he acquired a permanent limp. Burgoyne himself blamed his defeat on Arnold, and many military historians have agreed.<br>
<br>Arnold's next posting led directly to personal disaster. As military governor of Philadelphia, recently under British occupation, Arnold faced many temptations and succumbed to most. In a city sharply divided by politics, where most of the leading families had collaborated with the British occupation, Arnold led an active social life, courting and on 8 April 1779 marrying the beautiful young Margaret (Peggy) Shippen (1760&#150;1804), from one of these families: they had four sons and one daughter. He used his position to make money, and was infuriated when his enemies accused him of corruption. Support from Washington seemed to be wavering, and in May 1779 Arnold secretly sent a message to the British commander, Henry Clinton, in New York, offering his services under the codename Monk to end the war.<br>
<br>In fact a majority in congress had protected Arnold from the vindictive Pennsylvania government by referring the charges against him to Washington for trial by court martial. But Arnold, embittered by his crippling and still painful wound, and by what he regarded as mistreatment at the hands of politicians, could see only his many grievances. For more than a year he supplied information to Clinton and negotiated for a large reward should he find some way to give vital help to the British cause. His chance came in late summer 1780 when Washington agreed to his request to command at West Point, where the Hudson River, 50 miles north of Manhattan, cuts through the mountainous highlands. The fortifications at and below West Point anchored Washington's position, shadowing the British base in New York city and restricting naval movement up the Hudson. Arnold, once in command, proposed to deliver West Point and its garrison to a British attack. His price, accepted by Clinton, was &pound;20,000 for success, and half that amount in case of failure. In 1780, shortly after joining the British, Arnold published an apologia claiming that he had never supported independence, only the redress of colonial grievances, and that he could not continue to support the American cause after the alliance with France, the enemy of the protestant faith. The evidence did not support his claims.<br>
<br>Major John Andr&eacute;, a popular young officer on Clinton's staff, had been Arnold's contact from the outset, and it was Andr&eacute;, thinly disguised as Mr John Anderson, who travelled to meet Arnold in late September 1780. Returning to New York, Andr&eacute; was captured by American militia, who sent papers found on him to local commanders; the commanders, unsuspecting, informed Arnold, giving him time to flee on board a British warship in the Hudson. Andr&eacute;, captured in civilian clothes, was tried by American court martial as a spy and hanged. Arnold was awarded &pound;6315 and a pension of &pound;360 per annum and was made a British brigadier-general.<br>
<br>Arnold's treason, along with military defeats in the South, shocked supporters of the faltering American cause. Later in 1780 Arnold led a British raid into the Chesapeake, where he routed the Virginia militia and burnt ships, tobacco, and munitions as well as forcing Governor Thomas Jefferson to flee his capital. In the next year he raided eastern Connecticut, near his birthplace, sacking and burning the port town of New London and letting his men massacre the garrison of its fort in one of the ugliest incidents of the war. Mrs Arnold, who feigned innocence of his plot, had soon joined him within British lines, but the Arnolds were generally shunned by both British and loyalist society. After the British surrender at Yorktown in October 1781, they sailed for England at the end of the year.<br>
<br>The last twenty years of Arnold's life saw frantic activity and constant frustration. Although paid more than &pound;6000 for his defection, with small pensions for his wife and children and commissions for his sons, he pressed frequently for increased compensation from the crown. Responding to his pleas, Sir Henry Clinton approached the younger Pitt on Arnold's behalf, but without result. Arnold plunged most of his capital into a commercial venture in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, but this ended in loss by fire in July 1788&#151;the insurers, suspecting he had caused the fire, refused to pay&#151;and numerous lawsuits dragging on into 1790. In 1791 he returned to England. In July 1792 he fought a duel with the earl of Lauderdale, who in the House of Lords, criticizing the duke of Richmond, had referred to Arnold's &#145;apostasy&#146;. With the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, Arnold sailed directly into the West Indian danger zone, arriving in Guadeloupe in 1794 just as Sir Charles Grey was fighting off a French republican attempt to regain control of the island. Captured by the French and threatened with execution, Arnold escaped in a boat to Grey, whose staff he joined as a volunteer, though Grey declined his offer to serve as senior brigadier-general. Arnold returned to England ill and financially hard-pressed. His final venture, in privateering, failed like all the others. His family impoverished, his reputation ruined, depressed, and his once powerful physique shattered by asthma, gout, and dropsy, he died at his residence in Gloucester Place, Portman Square, London, on 14 June 1801, and was buried on 21 June in the crypt of St Mary's, Battersea. He left two sons by his first marriage (a third, Benedict, had died in 1796), four sons and a daughter by his second, an illegitimate son (John Sage) in Canada, and to his widow an estate consisting mainly of debts.<br>
<br>Vain, arrogant, and tactless, Arnold was also a brave and inspiring military leader. He was one of many who changed sides during the war, but to Americans, his name has since 1780 been synonymous with treason. Yet had he died at Saratoga in 1777, Arnold might stand next to Washington in the pantheon of American heroes of the war of independence.<br>
