<span class="headword">Young,  John</span>  (1514&#150;1581/2), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was a native of Yorkshire. He was elected fellow of St John's College, Cambridge, in 1536, having graduated BA in 1535. He proceeded MA in 1539 and BTh in 1546 and was nominated a fellow of Trinity College in the same year. In June 1549 he took part on the Catholic side in the disputations before Ridley at Cambridge. In 1550 he enjoyed a prominent role in public disputations with Martin Bucer and commenced a series of lectures on the first epistle of <span class="roman">Timothy</span>, during which he is said to have scorned Bucer and his views. A quarrel ensued between the two men and Young expressed alarm that he was being held up as an opponent of the authorized homily on good works. In 1551 he was accused in February before the privy council of preaching against the religious proceedings of Edward VI; on 25 November and 3 December he took part in the disputations on the sacraments at the houses of William Cecil and Richard Morison, still defending the Catholic tenets. However, it is possible that Young also translated some of Cranmer's polemic into Latin for the benefit of an international audience.<br>
<br>With the accession of Mary I, Young's support of the Catholic faith was recognized. He was created a doctor of theology at Cambridge in 1553 and incorporated at Oxford in the following year. He was appointed master of Pembroke College, Cambridge, on Ridley's deprivation, and instituted canon of Ely on 12 April 1554. He was vice-chancellor of Cambridge in 1553&#150;5, and in 1555 or 1556 he became regius professor of divinity. As vice-chancellor Young delivered a series of lectures entitled &#145;Ennarationes Joelis prophetae&#146;, dedicated to Cardinal Pole, which are extant in the Bodleian Library. He disputed with Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer at Oxford in 1554, and extracts from his &#145;socratical interrogations&#146; are reproduced by Foxe. Young took an active role in restoring his university to the Catholic faith. At the accession of Elizabeth I he was deprived of his mastership and committed to prison in Wood Street, London, for refusing to take the oath of supremacy. Before 1574 he was transferred to the Marshalsea prison, from where on 13 June that year he was temporarily released on the surety of his brother, Gregory Young. On 28 July 1577 he was transferred to the custody of the dean of Canterbury and on 18 February 1578 he was committed to the queen's bench prison. In 1580 he was moved to Wisbech Castle, where he made his will on the 20 April 1581; it was proved on 6 June 1582. Bequests included &#145;a Mapp of the whole worlde&#146; to his brother Gregory, and &pound;10 and his books to &#145;his man&#146; Henry Crosse.<br>
<br>Referred to by his enemies not as &#145;Jungus&#146; but as &#145;Fungus&#146;  (Porter, 63), Young is said to have been &#145;litigious, vain and inconstant&#146;  (Cooper, <span class="italic">Ath. Cantab.</span>, 1.428) but there is little evidence to support this view. It has been suggested that he was not on amicable terms with the fellows of Pembroke, but this is not supported by the warm commendations he received in letters sent by the fellows to Edmund Grindal inviting Grindal to become master following Young's deprivation. His talent and scholarship have not been disputed. His <span class="italic">De schismate, sive, De ecclesiasticae unitatis divisione liber unus</span> was published in eight volumes in Louvain in 1573, and Douai in 1603. A portrait of Young belongs to Cambridge University.<br>
