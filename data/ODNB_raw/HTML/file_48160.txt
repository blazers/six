<span class="headword">Rylands, Sir  (William) Peter</span>, baronet  (1868&#150;1948), <span class="occ">wire manufacturer</span>, was born at Bewsey House, Warrington, Lancashire, on 23 October 1868, third and youngest son of the politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24417/', "Peter Rylands (1820&#150;1887)")</script> of Massey Hall, Grappenhall, Thelwall, near Warrington, and his second wife, Caroline Wright (1841&#150;1920), daughter of William Reynolds of Penketh House, Warrington, and Pinhoe, Devon. He was educated at Charterhouse School (1881&#150;7) and at Trinity College, Cambridge (1887&#150;90), and in 1891 visited Mashonaland in Africa to hunt big game. He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple, London, in 1894, and in that year he married Nora Mary (1865&#150;1946), daughter of David de Angelis, a Parisian with business interests in the Bradford wool trade; they had no children. Rylands practised on the northern circuit and in 1895 edited <span class="italic">Thomas Terrell on the Law and Practice Relating to Letters Patent for Inventions</span>.<br>
<br>On his thirtieth birthday, following the death of his uncle John Rylands (1814&#150;1898), Peter Rylands, as he was always known, became managing director of the family wire business of Rylands Bros. He was an intelligent, broad-minded, well-read, and adaptable businessman whose company faced a complicated market structure as well as strong German competition and obstructive trade unionism. He gave a full analysis of its business in evidence to the tariff commission on 1 June 1904: his testimony is that of a clear, persuasive speaker with considerable mental agility. In 1898 he also joined the board of the Pearson and Knowles Coal and Iron Company of Warrington and Wigan, in which his family had a large interest. It was proof of his belief in the necessity of large-scale amalgamated enterprise to maintain competitiveness that Rylands Bros. was bought in 1906&#150;7 by Pearson Knowles. He ran Rylands Bros. as the wire department of Pearson Knowles, and was concerned in the erection of the group's new Partington steelworks in 1910&#150;13.<br>
<br>Rylands deplored the absence of business experience in British political leadership, and he advocated trade associations, manufacturing combinations, and tariff protection to prevent the diffusion of effort and wasting of resources. He was president of the Iron and Steel Wire Manufacturers' Association from 1900, and in 1912 was one of the promoters of the Employers' Parliamentary Association to lobby for the Lancashire business interest. He was a founder member of the Federation of British Industries (FBI) in 1916 and was a crucial figure in establishing it as a national institution, though he was not forgiven by some Lancashire leaders for his part in the absorption of the Employers' Parliamentary Association by the Birmingham-led FBI. He was chairman of the FBI's labour committee in 1917&#150;18, of its overseas trade and consular committee in 1918&#150;22, and president of the FBI for an unprecedented two-year stint in 1920&#150;22. He was dexterous in seeking united expressions of business opinion on public issues, and was much involved in other forms of industrial politics. He was appointed to the government's tariff advisory committee in 1923 and to its committee on industry and trade of 1925&#150;30 chaired by Sir Arthur Balfour. He was also president of the Iron and Steel Institute (1926&#150;7) and the Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers (1930&#150;31). He was not a mercenary man, but regarded money as a means of production rather than as an ultimate personal aim. His taste for paradox and philosophical speculation alarmed some of his cruder business colleagues. His opinions were independent and tenacious, but his outlook was moderate and constructive, and he disliked sectionalism of any kind.<br>
<br>In 1920 Rylands Bros. and Pearson Knowles were bought by the Newcastle armourers Armstrong Whitworth. Armstrong's overbearing chairman, Sir Glynn West, excluded Rylands from the head board and managed these acquisitions so badly that by 1926 the Armstrong companies were insolvent. After intervention by the Bank of England, Pearson Knowles and Rylands Bros. were merged in 1930 in the new Lancashire Steel Corporation, of which Rylands became a director. He was nevertheless sceptical of the benefits of the &#145;rationalization&#146; movement promoted by the Bank of England to rescue Britain's declining staple industries.<br>
<br>Like his father and namesake Rylands was prominent in his district. He was a magistrate in Lancashire from 1905 and in Cheshire from 1906, and was high sheriff of Cheshire in 1935&#150;6. He abandoned his father's political allegiances and was sometime chairman of the Warrington Conservative Association, though it is hard to imagine him at ease among diehards. Among many voluntary local offices he was president of the Warrington chamber of commerce and life governor and benefactor of Warrington Infirmary. Even in his social and sporting interests Rylands proved his talent as an initiator. He was the founder and first master of several masonic lodges, and founder secretary of Lymm Golf Club near his home. Keen on shooting and fishing, he was characteristically deliberative at croquet. In appearance he was quiet, dapper, and shrewd; for his portrait (<i>c</i>.1921) for the FBI he wore a pince-nez and spotted bow-tie.<br>
<br>Rylands was knighted in 1921 and received a baronetcy in 1939. He died of heart failure on 22 October 1948 at his home, Massey Hall, Grappenhall, Thelwall. This was the eve of his eightieth birthday, which would also have been the fiftieth anniversary of his becoming managing director of Rylands Bros.; he had spent his last day at his office in Warrington finalizing arrangements for a celebratory party, but died at home. His baronetcy became extinct, and he was buried on 27 October at All Saints', Thelwall.<br>
