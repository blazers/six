<span class="headword">Hesketh,  Richard</span>  (1553&#150;1593), <span class="occ">merchant and conspirator</span>, was born on 24 or 25 July 1553, according to a horoscope drawn up by John Dee. He was the fourth son of Gabriel Hesketh (<i>d</i>. 1573), a landowner of Aughton New Hall, Lancashire, and his first wife, Jane, daughter of Sir Henry Halsall of Halsall. His eldest brother, Bartholomew, inherited his father's substantial estates. A Roman Catholic, Bartholomew was questioned by the privy council in 1581 for sheltering the Jesuit Edmund Campion. The second brother, Thomas Hesketh, was a duchy of Lancaster attorney and escheator at Lancaster, and rose rapidly within the duchy and at Westminster for the vigour with which he enforced the Elizabethan religious settlement in Lancashire. Both brothers were frequently listed among the guests of Henry Stanley, fourth earl of Derby, at nearby Lathom House, where the earl and his council played a prominent role in the government of the north-west of England.<br>
<br>Richard Hesketh was apprenticed to Hugh Fayreclough, and in 1578 became a freeman of the Clothworkers' Company in the city of London. He seems to have been a merchant involved in the export of cloth, and in 1581 he was mentioned by John Dee in his diary as his friend and Antwerp agent who diligently searched for books and carried Dee's correspondence to his many contacts in Antwerp. Richard Hesketh probably shared the views of Dee and this Antwerp circle, including an interest in alchemy, hermetism, and religious toleration as practised by the Family of Love.<br>
<br>About 1586 Richard Hesketh married Isabel Shaw and became involved in litigation on behalf of Isabel and her children from her two previous marriages to Thomas Richardson and Roger Ambrose over her considerable inherited wealth and Ambrose Hall, contested in the duchy chamber, Star Chamber, and before the privy council. In October 1589 Richard Hesketh was involved in the affray at Lea Hall, near Preston, in which Thomas Hoghton and Richard Baldwin were killed; for his part in this riot Hesketh was forced into exile for three years. He travelled through Germany to Prague, then centre of the Holy Roman empire, where a group of English exiles led by Edward Kelly then enjoyed the patronage of the emperor Rudolf II, who shared Kelly's delight in alchemy and made him an <i>eques auratus</i>. In May 1591, however, Kelly fell out of favour; he was imprisoned and his circle threatened. Hesketh and others were offered the protection of the English Jesuit Thomas Stephenson, then resident in the College of the Clementinum in Prague.<br>
<br>In 1592 Hesketh was on the payroll of the regiment of Sir William Stanley in Flanders, then fighting in the service of Spain. Listed among the <i>entretenidos</i> or staff officers of the regiment, he was involved in the intelligence side of the regiment's work and must be the agent described in the letter of Emanuel D'Andrada to Lord Burghley. Both Colonel Stanley and Cardinal Allen were then promoting the claims of Henry Stanley, fourth earl of Derby, to the English crown. Richard Hesketh was briefed by Colonel Stanley that they had the support of the pope and the king of Spain for this claim, and by Thomas Worthington, chaplain to his company, who had experience of working in a hostile England. In the summer of 1593 Hesketh returned to England via Prague and Hamburg to merge with returning merchants. In Canterbury he was joined by Richard Baylye, also an experienced <i>entretenido</i> in Stanley's regiment, who posed as Hesketh's servant in London and on his return to Lancashire.<br>
<br>About 25 September 1593 Hesketh arrived at Lathom House, supposedly to show his passports to the earl of Derby in his capacity of lord lieutenant; unfortunately this was the day of the earl's death. Hesketh found the opportunity to propose that Ferdinando Stanley, the new fifth earl, should lead a revolt to claim the English crown before the death of the queen, and begin negotiations by sending a representative to Flanders. Ferdinando arranged to meet ten days later at Brereton Hall in Cheshire, and Hesketh was to join his entourage <i>en route</i> for the court at Windsor. It soon became apparent, however, that Hesketh was not accompanying his lord as his courtier but as his prisoner. Hesketh was held at Ditton House near Windsor Castle and interrogated there by William Wade, clerk to the privy council. By 15 October a confession was extracted, seemingly without torture, Hesketh claiming that his sole motivation was to further the interests of his lord. As there was plague in London his trial for treason was speedily carried out by the attorney-general, Sir Thomas Egerton, on 24 November at St Albans. From the scaffold on 29 November 1593 Hesketh is said to have bitterly renounced those who had sent him on the mission, and to have denied that he was ever a Catholic.<br>
<br>Four months after the execution of Richard Hesketh the apparently healthy earl of Derby died at Lathom. Ferdinando himself believed he had been bewitched, while others believed he had been poisoned as a revenge for his part in Hesketh's execution. Ferdinando had claimed that Thomas Hesketh, with the powers of the duchy of Lancaster, had strenuously opposed his rule. Ferdinando's sudden death now brought about a disputed inheritance which did enormous damage to the earldom that Richard Hesketh had sought to promote. Although later earls of Derby regained many of the lost estates and titles, they never regained the dominance they once held in the region, which now came more directly under the control of central government.<br>
