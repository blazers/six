<span class="headword">Davids,  Thomas William  Rhys</span>  (1843&#150;1922), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, was born at Colchester on 12 May 1843, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7212/', "Thomas William Davids (1816&#150;1884)")</script>, ecclesiastical historian and Congregational minister at Colchester, and his wife, Louisa Winter. He was educated at Brighton School, Colchester, before a period of private tuition. He then went to New College, Finchley Road, London, from 1860 to about 1861, and finally studied Sanskrit under A. F. Stenzler at Breslau University until 1863. He went to Ceylon in 1864 and joined its civil service in 1866. In Ceylon he studied the Pali language and early Buddhism under native teachers. Here he found his vocation. He published articles on local inscriptions, and in 1870 became a member of the Archaeological Commission. In August 1871 he was appointed assistant government agent at Anuradhapura, but soon fell out with his superior and after less than a year was forced to leave. Though his offence amounted to little worse than slovenly bookkeeping, he was dismissed from the service (after appeal) in 1873. He returned to England in 1874. He was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1877 but practised little.<br>
<br>Rhys Davids's first major publication was <span class="italic">Ancient Coins and Measures of Ceylon</span> (1877); but it is as a scholar of Pali and of early Buddhism that he is remembered. In 1877 he wrote <span class="italic">Buddhism</span> for the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. This can claim to be the first book in English on Buddhism to meet modern scholarly standards. Reprinted more than twenty times, it has been influential, not least for its implied analogies between Theravada Buddhism and protestantism on the one hand as against Mahayana Buddhism and &#145;popery&#146; on the other. In 1880 the publication of Victor Fausb&ouml;ll's <span class="italic">J&#257;takas</span> in Pali led Rhys Davids to contemplate a translation, but he abandoned this idea (after a notable first volume&#151;<span class="italic">Buddhist Birth Stories</span>, 1880) in order to produce, for the series of <span class="roman">Sacred Books of the East</span> (published by the Clarendon Press), <span class="italic">Buddhist suttas from the Pali</span> (1881), which was followed by three volumes of translations (in collaboration with Hermann Oldenberg) of <span class="italic">Vinaya texts</span> (1881&#150;5) and <span class="italic">Questions of King Milinda</span> (1890&#150;94). These translations have stood the test of time. Rhys Davids married in 1894 Caroline Augusta (<i>d</i>. 1942), daughter of John Foley, vicar of Wadhurst, Sussex; they had one son, killed in action during the First World War, and two daughters. Caroline Rhys Davids herself wrote many books on Buddhism.<br>
<br>In 1881 Rhys Davids founded the Pali Text Society on the model of the Early English Text Society. It soon became the world's foremost publisher of Pali texts, translations of those texts, and auxiliary works. At the end of the twentieth century it was still publishing the journal of Pali studies which he founded, and kept about 300 volumes in print. Rhys Davids himself edited, with Joseph Estlin Carpenter, the text of the <span class="italic">D&#299;gha Nik&#257;ya</span> (3 vols., 1899&#150;1910) and volume 1 of the commentary thereon. He also began a translation, finished by his wife, of the same text (3 vols., 1899&#150;1921); its title, <span class="italic">Dialogues of the Buddha</span>, recalled Plato's Socratic dialogues, with which he believed the <span class="italic">D&#299;gha Nik&#257;ya</span> to rank. His introductions to the individual dialogues are notable for their cultural sensitivity, while his translations, though not wholly free from error, are perhaps as fluent and appropriate as any yet made of Buddhist scriptures.<br>
<br>Of Rhys Davids's books about Buddhism not already mentioned, the chief are <span class="italic">The Origin and Growth of Religion as Illustrated by &hellip; the History of Indian Buddhism</span> (Hibbert lectures, 1881), <span class="italic">Buddhist India</span> (1903), and (his own favourite) <span class="italic">Early Buddhism</span> (1908). He contributed many articles to Hastings's <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics</span>, and the chapter on early Buddhism to volume 1 of the <span class="italic">Cambridge History of India</span>. He began his Hibbert lectures by condemning the tendency of western scholarship to examine other religions merely with a view to discovering where they agreed with Christianity; and in his conclusion he compared the western discovery of oriental civilizations to the discovery that the earth is not the centre of the universe. As a historian of religion he was an evolutionist and owed much to E. B. Tylor. His interpretation of Buddhism stressed its rational and humanistic aspects.<br>
<br>Rhys Davids was honorary professor of Pali and Buddhist literature at University College, London, from 1882 to 1912. From 1904 to 1915 he was professor of comparative religion at the University of Manchester; the post was the only one of its kind in Britain, perhaps (as he claimed) in the world. He was secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland from 1888 to 1904, and was an original fellow of the British Academy, which he helped to found. In 1894 he was granted a civil-list pension of &pound;200 a year.<br>
<br>In 1902 Rhys Davids suggested an international project to produce a Pali&#150;English dictionary. When the First World War finally put paid to this plan, he decided to launch a provisional dictionary himself. Leaving Manchester, he secured William Stede as a full-time co-editor, and issued the first volume in 1921, and the second in 1922, the year of his death. The final instalment was published by Stede in 1925. Without Rhys Davids's energy this result could not have been achieved. He died at his home, Middleshaws, at Chipstead, Surrey, on 27 December 1922.<br>
<br>Rhys Davids was a lifelong Liberal. He combined enthusiasm with a keen sense of humour, and was at his best when discussing religion, politics, and the historical evolution of ideas. He delighted in placing his materials and ideas at the disposal of his friends.<br>
