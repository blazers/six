<span class="headword">Baldwin,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1563), <span class="occ">author and printer</span>, has left few biographical traces, although uncorroborated evidence&#151;including claims that he himself lodged in the 1587 edition of <span class="italic">Mirror for Magistrates</span>&#151;suggests that he was from Wales. Records survive concerning a Shropshireman named William Baldwin, whose service in the household of Mary I may correspond with Baldwin's involvement in the production of court revels. Baldwin may have supplicated the regents of Oxford University in 1533 for a degree and entered service as a schoolmaster but this too cannot be confirmed.<br>
<br>Nothing certain is known about Baldwin's life until 1547, when he entered into employment with Edward Whitchurch, a London printer with protestant leanings, whom he served as corrector. Whitchurch published Baldwin's <span class="italic">Treatise of Moral Philosophy</span> (1547) and <span class="italic">Canticles or Balades of Salomon</span> (1549). A collection of classical and humanistic adages and sententiae, the former text is tinged with Erasmianism. It attempts on the one hand to introduce classical learning to a readership dedicated to self-education, and on the other to harmonize classical philosophy with Christian belief. A very popular text, the <span class="italic">Treatise</span> underwent frequent revision and expansion by the compiler and others; it had been reissued twenty-four times by 1620. Baldwin's <span class="italic">Canticles</span>, dedicated to the young Edward VI, is a metrical translation of the <span class="roman">Song of Solomon</span>. In Solomon's wise aphorisms Baldwin found a Christian analogue to classical philosophy considered in the <span class="italic">Treatise</span>, further strengthening his humanist project by popularizing an important collection of scriptural poetry.<br>
<br>Anti-papal propaganda infuses Baldwin's translation of <span class="italic">Wonderful News of the Death of Paul III</span> (1552), from a Latin original by Matthias Flacius Illyricus. It exploits the scriptural figure of spiritual fornication, familiar from <span class="roman">Hosea</span> and other prophetic texts, to satirize the alleged depravity of Roman Catholicism. The pamphlet purports to report on the damnation of the late pope, whose infractions, which include sodomy, incest, and poisoning, are inscribed on stone pillars in hell. The translation qualifies eirenic humanistic concerns with a vitriolic protestant attack on the structure and teachings of the Church of Rome.<br>
<br>By late 1552 Baldwin had composed his <span class="italic">Marvelous History Entitled Beware the Cat, Concerning Diverse Wonderful and Incredible Matters</span> but it was not published until 1570, after the accession of Queen Elizabeth. Baldwin's &#145;Argument&#146; sets the story within the context of the Christmas revels of 1552, when the author assisted George Ferrers, master of the revels, with the annual festivities at the royal court. The work is structured as a dialogue among Ferrers, his &#145;astronomer&#146; (Master Wilmot), &#145;divine&#146; (Streamer), Baldwin's rather na&iuml;ve narrative persona, and others concerning whether or not animals are capable of speech and rationality in the manner of human beings.<br>
<br>In the manner of humanistic satires the work constitutes a virtuoso array of diverse literary forms: beast fable and dream vision coexist with medical treatise, proverb, and hymn. Through Streamer's outrageous insistence that animals can reason, superstitions of all kinds are held up for examination and ridicule. But if the didactic purpose of <span class="italic">Beware the Cat</span> betrays the influence of Erasmian humanism, parodic inversion and scepticism concerning human rationality are reminiscent of carnivalesque tradition in England and in Europe. In the manner of satires attributed to Luke Shepherd, Thomas More's <span class="italic">Utopia</span>, and Fran&ccedil;ois Rabelais's <span class="italic">Gargantua and Pantagruel</span>, Baldwin's satire dramatizes a topsy-turvy travesty of sanctioned forms of social order that highlights the arbitrariness and transitory nature of norms that govern everyday life.<br>
<br>Baldwin's next literary endeavour, his edition of <span class="italic">A Mirror for Magistrates</span>, continues in the vein of anti-Catholic polemic. For that reason the first edition (<i>c</i>.1554) appears to have been suppressed during the reign of Mary I, and it survives only in the form of two duplicate leaves from the tale of Owen Glendower and five title-pages. The text remained unpublished until Thomas Marsh printed it in 1559, soon after Elizabeth's accession. A collection of visionary poems by Baldwin, Ferrers, Thomas Churchyard, Thomas Phaer, Thomas Chaloner, and Thomas Sackville, the <span class="italic">Mirror for Magistrates</span> exemplifies misconduct by public officials and warns them of vices to be avoided. Enjoying great popularity, the text went through seven more editions by 1610. It influenced tragedies composed by Christopher Marlowe, William Shakespeare, and others. Baldwin's only other extant literary effort is <span class="italic">The Funerals of King Edward the Sixth</span>, a funeral elegy on the late monarch printed in 1560, again by Marsh.<br>
<br>During his literary career Baldwin continued to work at Whitchurch's printing shop and played an occasional role in the production of revels at the royal court. Accounts and correspondence of the master of the revels, Thomas Cawarden, indicate that Baldwin may have had a hand in &#145;a comedy concerning the way of life&#146; and perhaps in a morality play but this cannot be confirmed.<br>
<br>Baldwin wrote in the 1563 <span class="italic">Mirror</span> that he had been &#145;called to an other trade of lyfe&#146; in 1559, and he is probably the William Baldwin who was ordained deacon by Archbishop Grindal in that year; Thomas Churchyard describes him as a minister in the 1587 <span class="italic">Mirror</span>, and Wood noted that he gave up printing for the church. Baldwin was appointed vicar of Tortington, Sussex, in 1559&#150;60 and rector of St Michael-le-Querne, London, in 1561; he died some time before 1 November 1563. Stowe's <span class="italic">Historical Memoranda</span> gives an account of a Baldwin preaching at Paul's Cross in September 1563, who died a week later of the plague. This was probably the writer.<br>
<br>Baldwin is remembered not only as an anti-Catholic satirist but also as a literary innovator whose works influenced writers as historically distant and as thematically diverse as Thomas Nashe, Edmund Spenser, and Alexander Pope.<br>
