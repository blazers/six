<span class="headword">H&aacute;lfdan <span class="st"> [Healfdene]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 877), <span class="occ">king of the Danes</span>, was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49261/', "&#205;varr inn Beinlausi")</script> (&Iacute;varr the Boneless). The tradition that both were the sons of Ragnarr Lodbr&oacute;k (Ragnarr Hairy Breeches) is unreliable. H&aacute;lfdan and his brother were among the leaders of the &#145;great army&#146; that arrived in England from Denmark in 865. After wintering in East Anglia from autumn 865, the army moved to York, which it took on 1 November 866. A Northumbrian attempt to retake the city was repelled and the Northumbrian kings Osberht and &AElig;lle killed on 21 March 867. The vikings established Ecgberht as their puppet king in the north before moving, in the autumn of 867, to Nottingham in Mercia. The army returned to York in 868, staying for a year before crossing Mercia to Thetford in East Anglia. At this point they engaged the East Angles, killing their king, Edmund (<i>d</i>. 869). Unlike his brother &Iacute;varr, who left England at this time, H&aacute;lfdan was not implicated in this deed by later tradition. H&aacute;lfdan's army left East Anglia in the autumn or early winter of 870, and invaded Wessex, establishing their base at Reading. The <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, which for this period is a near contemporary West Saxon source, gives a detailed narrative of the ensuing campaign. The vikings fought nine general engagements against the West Saxons, who were led by their king, &AElig;thelred I, who died in April 871, and his brother and successor, Alfred. The most important of these took place on the Berkshire downs, then called Ashdown, in the early months of 871. H&aacute;lfdan makes his first appearance in a written source in the chronicle's report of that battle, in which the viking army was drawn up in two divisions: one, opposed by Alfred, was led by <i>jarls</i>, the other, which &AElig;thelred engaged, was under the command of &#145;the heathen kings Bagsecg and Healfdene&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 871). Bagsecg was slain in the battle. The outcome of Ashdown, and ultimately of all the engagements of 871, was indecisive, despite the arrival at some point of a &#145;great summer army&#146;, probably led by Guthrum, which reinforced H&aacute;lfdan's host. In the autumn of 871 the combined army left Reading and wintered in London. Coins minted there at the time bear the name H&aacute;lfdan, indicating his status as the army's most prominent leader. From London, in the early autumn of 872, the army was drawn to Northumbria by a revolt against the Danish-appointed puppet king Ecgberht, before it settled for the winter in Mercia, at Torksey on the Trent. The vikings remained there for a year after the Mercians had bought peace from them, until late in 873 they moved to Repton; they drove the Mercian king, Burgred, from his kingdom, establishing in his place Ceolwulf (<i>fl</i>. 874&#150;879), who gave them hostages and swore oaths that Mercia should be at their disposal whenever they wanted it. In the following year the viking army divided into two. While Guthrum occupied Cambridge, from where he invaded Wessex again in 875, H&aacute;lfdan took his contingent north to a base on the Tyne from which he attacked the Picts and Strathclyde Britons. His army then settled in Northumbria from autumn 875, where they &#145;proceeded to plough and to support themselves&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 876). The area occupied seems to have been broadly the old kingdom of Deira, centred on York; the northern part of Northumbria, Bernicia, remained in the hands of English rulers.<br>
<br>H&aacute;lfdan himself does not seem to have settled with his followers. The annals of Ulster's record for the year 875 includes the notice that &#145;Oist&iacute;n son of Amla&iacute;b, king of the Norsemen, was deceitfully killed by Albann&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ann. Ulster</span>, s.a. 874). Albann was almost certainly H&aacute;lfdan, his victim the son of &Oacute;l&aacute;f the White, who had partnered H&aacute;lfdan's brother &Iacute;varr in widespread campaigning in Ireland in the 850s and early 860s. H&aacute;lfdan may, therefore, have been attempting to reclaim the inheritance of his brother, who had died in Ireland in 873. If so, the killing of Oist&iacute;n (Eysteinn) was not decisive. H&aacute;lfdan may have returned to Northumbria to complete the settlement of his warriors, but he appeared again in Ireland in 877. The annals of Ulster record a skirmish at Strangford Lough in that year, between the <i>Finngenti</i> and the <i>Dubgennti</i>, meaning literally the &#145;Fair Heathens&#146; and the &#145;Dark Heathens&#146;, and referring to the Norwegians and the Danes respectively. H&aacute;lfdan, the king of the Danes, was slain there.<br>
