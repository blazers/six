<span class="headword">Thomson,  William</span>  (1802&#150;1852), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 3 July 1802 in Edinburgh, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27316/', "John Thomson (1765&#150;1846)")</script>, surgeon (subsequently professor of surgery at the College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, professor of military surgery at Edinburgh University, and professor of pathology at Edinburgh University), and his first wife, Margaret Crawford Gordon (<i>d</i>. 1804). From the high school in Edinburgh, Thomson matriculated as a medical student at Edinburgh University in the session 1818&#150;19 and studied medicine there and at the Edinburgh extramural school until 1821. He spent the session 1821&#150;2 at Glasgow University studying medicine and philosophy.<br>
<br>By the beginning of the 1820s the pathological discoveries being made in France had attracted the attention of British medical men. Thomson's father, who resigned his post as professor of military surgery at Edinburgh in 1822, had become interested in the study of pathological anatomy. At his father's behest Thomson and another Edinburgh medical practitioner, Robert Carswell, spent the best part of the years 1822 to 1824 in France, initially in Paris and subsequently in Lyons, studying French methods in pathology and surgery. The information gleaned from this was used by John Thomson in his subsequent lectures on pathology.<br>
<br>After returning from Paris, Thomson became a fellow of the College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1825. In 1826 he was elected one of the surgeons of the New Town Dispensary in Edinburgh. From 1826 to 1828 he gave lectures on the institutes of medicine. In December 1827 he married Eliza, daughter of Ninian Hill, a solicitor. They had six children. From 1828 to 1841 Thomson worked closely with his father, lecturing initially on the practice of medicine, and in 1830 taking over his father's course on the practice of physic.<br>
<br>In 1831 Thomson was awarded the MD of Marischal College, Aberdeen, by examination, and two years later, in 1833, was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. In that same year he acted as a delegate from the College of Surgeons of Edinburgh to parliament during its consideration of amendments to the 1815 <span class="roman">Apothecaries Act</span>. In 1834 he was again a delegate to parliament, this time as part of a deputation from the Edinburgh colleges of physicians and surgeons and Edinburgh University, which was monitoring and giving evidence to a select committee on medical education and privileges. He was also involved in professional and public affairs in Edinburgh outside the colleges, being for a time secretary of the Medico-Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh, as well as holding the office of secretary to the Edinburgh School of Art. Thomson was appointed physician to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary in 1841, but held this office for only a short time. Later that year he was appointed professor of the practice of medicine at Glasgow University.<br>
<br>As well as his medical duties Thomson undertook a heavy administrative workload during his time as professor, although he had no private practice. He again accepted appointment as physician to the Royal Infirmary from 1843 to 1846, and from 1848 to 1851, since the tenure of high medical office within the university was no guarantee of the right to have beds at the Royal Infirmary. He was by virtue of his professorship a director of the Royal Infirmary. In the university he was also clerk to the faculty (a general administrative body, not to be confused with the faculty of medicine) for a number of years in the 1840s. In this capacity he was closely involved with the selection of records for the <span class="italic">Munimenta alme universitatis Glasguensis</span>, edited by Cosmo Innes and published in 1854. Thomson was also a director of the lunatic asylum at Gartnavel, where he acted as physician during the winter of 1848&#150;9, while there was a vacancy in the post of physician superintendent. During that period there was an outbreak of cholera in the asylum which resulted in the deaths of more than forty patients.<br>
<br>Thomson made a number of contributions to the medical literature, and was particularly well regarded by his contemporaries for his ability to cut to the heart of the matter in his writing. His only book was <span class="italic">A Practical Treatise on Diseases of the Liver</span>, published in Edinburgh in 1841. Thomson was cultured in his manners, which were described as being &#145;dignified and polished&#146;  (Cowan, 204). He was not considered a great success as a teacher because of his inability to organize the material on which he was lecturing, although he was very warmly disposed to his students and interested in their careers and well-being.<br>
<br>Towards the end of the 1840s Thomson's health, which had never been good, began to fail. At the beginning of the 1850s he began to have symptoms of heart disease. This gradually worsened, and during the first week of May 1852 he suffered shortness of breath and chest pains. On 10 May he travelled to Edinburgh to consult medical colleagues on his symptoms, but he died suddenly on the morning of 12 May 1852. He was survived by his wife.<br>
