<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Burgers,  Thomas Fran&ccedil;ois</span>  (1834&#150;1881), <span class="occ">president of the South African Republic</span>, was born on 15 April 1834 in Langfontein, Camdeboo, in the Graaff-Reinet district of Cape Colony, the youngest son of Barend Jacobus Burger or Burgers (1775&#150;1845), a minister, and Elisabeth Magdalena Theron (1792&#150;1867). He received his initial education at Graaff-Reinet, then went to Utrecht in the Netherlands to study for the ministry. It was while he was there, between 1853 and 1858, that he met Mary Bryson (1836&#150;1929), a Scot, whom he married in 1858 and with whom he was to have ten children.<br>
<br>After being admitted as a minister in the Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk (Dutch Reformed church) in Cape Town, Burgers became dominee at Hanover in the rural Karoo in 1859. The radical theology he had acquired in Utrecht from Professor Opzoomer and others soon revealed itself. He rejected much of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> as improbable, and did not believe in the bodily resurrection of Christ. In 1862 he was accused of rationalism and heterodoxy by his church, found guilty of deviation from its confession, and suspended as a minister. A strong-willed man, Burgers appealed to the Cape supreme court, which set aside the suspension in 1865. He was then able to return to his ministry. Two years later the supreme court's decision was upheld by the British privy council, the Cape's highest court of appeal.<br>
<br>Three brief sketches which Burgers wrote after a visit to the Transvaal were published first in the Cape Town journal <span class="italic">Volksblad</span> (1871) and then as <span class="italic">Schetsen uit de Transvaal</span> (1872). He found the Nederduits Hervormde Kerk in the Transvaal more congenial than his own branch of the Dutch Reformed church, and he impressed the white population of the Transvaal as one who would stand up to the British, then apparently seeking to encroach on Transvaal territory from Griqualand West. After President Brand of the Orange Free State had recommended Burgers as a man who would help extricate the Transvalers from their many difficulties, he was persuaded to run for president. Burgers was duly elected by a majority of 2964 votes, and sworn in on 1 July 1872. From the beginning he was opposed by the most conservative white burghers (citizens) of the Transvaal, led by Paul Kruger.<br>
<br>Burgers proved an idealistic but impractical president who failed to understand the people he ruled. Very seriously ill in 1874, he nevertheless worked hard to try to reduce the republic's isolation, and above all tried to launch a railway scheme to build a line from Pretoria to Delagoa Bay, a line which he believed would be the country's salvation. He sought to resist the interference of the British high commissioner, Sir Henry Barkly, who detested him, and he ignored the Keate award, which failed to grant the Transvalers the land they claimed in the south-west. On a fourteen-month visit to Europe he met Lord Carnarvon, the colonial secretary, but was not persuaded to support the idea of a British-led federation. His goal was to put the Transvaal back on its feet, then lead it into a federation with the Orange Free State which would be the core of a future united South Africa with its own flag. He achieved very little in practice besides founding a newspaper in Pretoria in 1873 and establishing a museum, library, and botanical gardens. This last, in central Pretoria, is still known as Burgers Park.<br>
<br>Burgers's efforts for the Transvaal did not win him support there; instead the white burghers increasingly opposed him. They misleadingly claimed that his <span class="roman">Education Act</span> would remove the <span class="roman">Bible</span> from schools. When he sought to change the country's flag and coat of arms, in 1874, his attempt was reversed while he was absent. Tensions continued to grow as the burghers accused him of tactless behaviour. Burgers was often away from Pretoria and became increasingly isolated. His final failure came in 1876 when he led his burghers against the forces of Sekukuni of the Pedi, whose people were encroaching on land which the white Transvalers regarded as their own. For this war he drained the state's coffers, and this forced him to introduce a most unpopular war tax. The men who accompanied him in the field drifted away, and his campaign therefore failed.<br>
<br>Burgers's various failures as a leader gave Theophilus Shepstone, sent by Carnarvon to annex the Transvaal, the opportunity to claim that a majority of white Transvalers were in favour of British annexation. All Burgers could do was issue a note of protest when Shepstone proclaimed the annexation in April 1877. The following month he left for Cape Town, his political career at an end. He was then given a pension by the British from the Transvaal treasury on condition that he did not enter the territory. The Transvaal burghers accused him of treason for accepting it; he in turn blamed them for failing to reconcile themselves to British rule. He died poor, &#145;of a broken heart&#146;  (Appelgryn, 255), on 9 December 1881 at Richmond, Cape Colony, where he had been living, and was buried there. His remains were reinterred in the old cemetery, Pretoria, after the eventual opening of the Delagoa Bay Railway, his great dream, in 1895.<br>
