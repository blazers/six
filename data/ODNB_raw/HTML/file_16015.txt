<span class="headword">Langham,  Simon</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1376), <span class="occ">administrator, archbishop of Canterbury, and cardinal</span>, was born at Langham in Rutland, the son of Thomas Langham&#151;his spectacular career as an ecclesiastic and royal minister contrasts markedly with his modest beginnings. He became a monk of St Peter's, Westminster, some time before 1339, and in 1346 was his abbey's proctor at the Benedictine triennial chapter in Northampton. That same year he began his studies at Oxford, but returned to Westminster in 1348, possibly with the coming of the black death, without completing his degree. If he studied theology in his years at Oxford, he was one of only four abbots of Westminster to have done so. On 10 April 1349, at the height of the plague epidemic in England, he was appointed prior and, several weeks later, on 27 May, was elected abbot of Westminster. The ravages of the plague were challenge enough for the new abbot, but Langham also had to face a crushing debt left by his predecessor and a monastic community grown slack in discipline. As abbot from 1349 to 1362 Langham worked hard to correct both defects. He managed the abbey's estates shrewdly, reviving and expanding a previous policy of leasing lands and purchasing new properties. He succeeded not only in paying off the debts, but also in bringing the abbey into a period of renewed prosperity. He oversaw new building projects, completed the cloister in the new perpendicular style, and was himself a generous benefactor to the abbey, establishing chantries and giving from his own accumulated wealth as abbot and, later, as archbishop. He is deservedly called Westminster's second founder.<br>
<br>Langham improved monastic discipline in his community much as he managed its estates, with sound judgement and pragmatism. The mid-fifteenth-century Westminster chronicler John Flete called him a reformer of the first rank, a wise counsellor, and an eloquent preacher. But John Reading (<i>d</i>. 1368/9), who lived under Langham, held a different opinion of the man, and thought him overbearing and ambitious. However much such opinions differ, there is little doubt that Langham was an excellent administrator. Edward III knew as much when he appointed him treasurer on 23 November 1360, the first religious to occupy such a high post in the royal administration in nearly a century. Meanwhile, Langham continued his duties as abbot while struggling to reduce his master's sizeable war debt. His successes were rewarded with rapid advancement. In 1361 the cathedral chapters at both London and Ely elected him bishop, but Langham chose the latter on account of its ties with the Benedictine community. The pope provided him to Ely on 22 January 1362, and Bishop William Edington (<i>d</i>. 1366) consecrated him bishop on 20 March at St Paul's. On 21 February 1363, Edward made him chancellor, an office Langham held until September 1367. As chancellor he promoted royal policy to legislation, including tighter restrictions on appeals to the papal court in the revised <span class="roman">Statute of <i>Praemunire</i></span> (1365). He opened parliament regularly, and in 1363 broke with tradition by delivering the chancellor's formal address in English.<br>
<br>Langham was not only an experienced and able administrator, he cultivated like talents in other men. He was a mentor to William Wykeham (<i>d</i>. 1404) and appointed him keeper of the privy seal in 1363. Adam Easton (<i>d</i>. 1397) was to be a member of his household in later years. Pleased with Langham's achievements, Edward nominated him as archbishop of Canterbury in 1366 and the pope provided him to the see on 24 July. He was the last monk to hold this office and might have made a lasting impression on the province had his reign been longer. Still, Langham's register shows a man busy with administration and pastoral care in challenging times. He enforced new papal restrictions on pluralism, and corrected abuses in his visitations of deaneries and religious houses. He attempted to curb religious dissent by ordering John Ball (<i>d</i>. 1381) to cease preaching in 1367, and, in the following year, intervened in a bitter dispute between the Oxford theologians Uthred Boldon (<i>d</i>. 1396) and William Jordon, issuing thirty articles of his own on matters of justification, grace, and the salvation of non-believers. His own spirituality emerges in the pages of his register with three hymns written in honour of St Catherine. But Langham was archbishop for only two years; on 22 September 1368 Urban V created him cardinal-priest of St Sixtus, and Langham indicated his willingness to accept the promotion before consulting the king. While Langham may have thought himself more useful to the king as a potentially influential member of the papal court, Edward regarded the move as one of divided loyalty and compromised service to the crown. Langham's situation changed quickly: Edward seized the Canterbury temporalities before the archbishop could resign them (which he did on 28 November), leaving Langham in relative poverty, and delaying his departure for Avignon until 28 February 1369.<br>
<br>Langham's desire to serve church and kingdom as a peacemaker was given real opportunity in 1370 with the election of Gregory XI. For several years thereafter the &#145;cardinal of Canterbury&#146;, as Langham was styled at Avignon, was engaged in several diplomatic missions. Though he was frustrated by the intransigence of the French and English kings, he managed to arrange a peace between Edward and the count of Flanders in 1372. But what diplomatic successes he enjoyed went unrecognized both in England, where many of his friends regarded him as too pro-papal, and in Avignon, where the French majority of cardinals questioned his loyalty. The latter's mistrust was confirmed on one famous occasion when Langham, in the presence of the English king, removed his hat in deference. The pope was less concerned by the incident, and promoted him to cardinal-bishop of Palestrina in 1373, but the elevation did little to improve Langham's real status either at the papal court or in England. His diplomatic services were no longer required and, in spite of his benefices which included archdeaconries in Wells and York and the prebends of Brompton in Lincoln and Wistow in York, Langham was less wealthy as a cardinal than he had been as an archbishop.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, Langham managed to remember his brethren at Westminster in the form of generous endowments. Between 1368 and his death in 1376 Langham had a chantry established in the abbey for his own soul and the souls of his family worth 1000 marks, earning 40 marks annually in rents; he also left his community a residuary estate worth nearly &pound;1000, along with a valuable, indeed notable, library, vestments, and plate, and donated a further &pound;400 to the fabric fund. In 1374, with Canterbury vacant and the chapter sympathetic toward Langham's candidacy, the cardinal entertained hopes of returning to England in his former capacity. But the chapter looked elsewhere, as neither king nor pope would have approved the election. In 1376, when it was certain that Gregory would go back to Rome, Langham sought and obtained papal permission to retire to England, but he died at Avignon on 22 July, possibly from a paralysing stroke. He was buried at the Carthusian church near Avignon. In 1379 his remains were transferred to the splendid tomb built by Henry Yevele and Stephen Lote in St Benedict's Chapel, Westminster Abbey. He is the only archbishop buried in the abbey.<br>
