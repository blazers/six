<span class="headword">Holland,  Hezekiah</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1638&#150;1660), <span class="occ">clergyman</span>, was a native of Ireland who described himself as Anglo-Irish, and was almost certainly the Ezekias Holland who graduated BA at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1638. In a preface dated 10 July 1649 he made clear that he was new to England, &#145;a stranger, (a kind of a banished man) out of Ireland&#146;, explaining that &#145;five years ago I came out of that Kingdom into this&#146;  (Holland, <span class="italic">Looking Glasse</span>, 3, 7). It seems, then, that he had arrived in England about 1644. Following the sequestration of its vicar, Robert Smith, in March 1645, Holland was approved by parliament as the minister of Sutton Valence, Kent, and the preface cited above introduced a selection of his sermons preached there. In 1650 he published <span class="italic">An Exposition &hellip; of the most Choice Commentaries upon the Revelation of Saint John</span> (including those of St Augustine, Heinrich Bullinger, Thomas Brightman, and especially David Parens), which he had first delivered in his parish church. In Kent the General Baptists were building up a substantial following and it soon became necessary to engage in controversy with one of their most prominent Kentish leaders, George Hammon of Biddenden. For Hammon had &#145;gotten into great repute with those who know not how to contradict you&#146;, as his opponent admitted in the preface of his <span class="italic">Adam's Condition in Paradise Discovered</span>, signed from Sutton Valence on 3 February 1656. Since each side considered the other to be antichristian the controversy generated much acrimony. It seems from a work issued by Hammon in 1660 that Holland was still preaching at Sutton Valence in that year. After this time, however, nothing is known of him.<br>
