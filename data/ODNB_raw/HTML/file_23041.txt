<span class="headword">Raleigh,  Alexander</span>  (1817&#150;1880), <span class="occ">Congregational minister</span>, was born at The Flock, a farm near Castle Douglas, Kirkcudbrightshire, on 3 January 1817. He was the fourth son and the fifth of the nine children born to Thomas and Isabella Raleigh. His parents were members of the Reformed Presbyterian church which maintained the ideals of the covenanter Richard Cameron. Alexander attended the high school at Castle Douglas, and in 1832 was apprenticed to a draper there; he continued in that trade in Liverpool after the family moved there in 1835. He joined the Congregational Crescent Chapel of which John Kelly (1801&#150;1876) was minister, entered Blackburn Academy in March 1840, and moved to Manchester when the Lancashire Independent College took over the students of Blackburn Academy in 1843.<br>
<br>On 6 November 1844 Raleigh accepted a call to be minister of Greenock Congregational Church and was ordained there on 5 April 1845. Ill health compelled him to resign on 10 July 1848, but after a period of rest he began to minister to the church at Masborough Chapel, Rotherham, on 24 August 1850. On 10 August 1851, at Edinburgh, Raleigh married Mary Darling, only daughter of James Gifford of that city; they had four daughters and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35656/', "Sir Walter Alexander Raleigh (1861&#150;1922)")</script>. Raleigh subsequently moved to West George Street Congregational Church, Glasgow, and began his ministry there on 1 July 1855 in succession to Dr Ralph Wardlaw (1779&#150;1853). He supervised the move to a new church at Elgin Place, opened in August 1856. Ill health still afflicted him and in December 1856 he moved south to Hare Court Chapel, Canonbury, London. His last move was to Kensington Congregational Church in 1875.<br>
<br>Alexander Raleigh was an attractive character, unassuming, tactful, and generous in his dealings with others. His rich, musical voice and polished sentences made him a powerful pulpit orator whose services were in constant demand. In May 1861 he preached the annual sermon of the London Missionary Society and was appointed one of the Merchants' lecturers. He was an exceptionally successful minister. The high regard in which he was held was shown by his being elected chairman of the Congregational Union of England and Wales on two occasions, in 1868 and 1879. In 1865 he represented the Congregational Union at the National Council of American Congregational Churches at Boston, together with Dr Robert Vaughan (1895&#150;1868) and Dr George Smith (1803&#150;1870), and his eirenic spirit did much to overcome the American hostility to Vaughan, who had been critical of the north during the civil war.<br>
<br>Some eighteen titles were published under Raleigh's name, most of them sermons. The most popular were <span class="italic">Quiet Resting Places</span> (1863), <span class="italic">The Book of Esther</span> (1880) (a series of meditations), and <span class="italic">Thoughts for the Weary and Sorrowful</span> (ed. Mary Raleigh, 3rd edn, 1886). A few of his publications were lectures and addresses, including <span class="italic">Questions and Duties of the Time</span>, his chairman's address at the Congregational Union meeting on 13 October 1868. Raleigh died at his home at 27 Ladbroke Grove, London, on 19 April 1880 and he was buried at Abney Park cemetery. His wife survived him and edited a life of Raleigh (1881) and collections of his sermons.<br>
