<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Somerset,  Henry</span>, first duke of Beaufort  (1629&#150;1700), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was born at Raglan Castle, Monmouthshire, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26006/', "Edward Somerset, sixth earl and second marquess of Worcester (d. 1667)")</script>, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1635), daughter of Sir William Dormer. His grandfather thought Lord Herbert, as he was styled, &#145;the only hope&#146; of his Roman Catholic family, and sent him to France and Italy in 1644 with his tutor John Clarke  (Badminton muniments, P4/3). He returned in 1650 to find Raglan destroyed, the Somerset estate sequestrated by parliament, and his inheritance wasted largely as a result of wartime loans to the king. He spent the next twenty years trying to restore his family's fortune. In 1651 he negotiated a settlement with Cromwell, confirming the latter's ownership of many south Wales properties in return for the right to compound. Hostile observers later suggested that he became &#145;a great Favourite&#146; with the lord protector and &#145;had 2,000<i>l</i>. <i>per. Ann.</i> given him, and Lodgings assign'd him at <i>Whitehall</i>&#146;  (Rogers, 79&#150;80).<br>
<br>In 1655 Herbert acquired by devise from his cousin Elizabeth, daughter and heir of Thomas Somerset, Viscount Somerset of Cashel, an estate at Badminton, Gloucestershire. Here he took up residence when, on 17 August 1657, he married, before a Clerkenwell JP, Mary [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40544/', "Somerset, Mary (bap. 1630, d. 1715)")</script>], eldest daughter of the royalist martyr <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4583/', "Arthur Capel, Lord Capel of Hadham")</script>, and widow of Henry Seymour, Lord Beauchamp. His marriage enhanced his standing among royalists such as Sir Edward Hyde, who later resided at Worcester House in London. It also confirmed his conversion to the protestant faith. Only later did he stand accused of crypto-Catholicism by Monmouthshire natives who could not forget that his grandfather had established a Jesuit mission at Raglan and that his father had tried to raise an Irish Catholic army for Charles I. Herbert's father's wartime activities and his wife Mary's active royalism led to his arrest during the Gloucestershire plot. He spent two months in the Tower before being released on 1 November 1659. He sat in the Convention Parliament and was chosen one of the twelve commissioners from the Commons to attend Charles II at Breda (7 May 1660).<br>
<br>After the Restoration, Herbert was MP for Monmouthshire from 1660 to 3 April 1667, when he succeeded his father as third marquess of Worcester. In 1660 the king appointed him to serve as constable of St Briavels Castle, warden of the Forest of Dean (18 June), and lord lieutenant of Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, and Monmouthshire (30 July). He spent the next several years seeking out potential rebels and undermining plots against the government. In 1662 he saw to the demolition of the walls and fortifications at Gloucester. The following year he persuaded the king of the importance of maintaining a garrison at Chepstow Castle, describing it as &#145;the key&#146; to south Wales and as &#145;a bridle to the ill-affected who abound in those parts&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1663&#150;4</i>, 359). He even paid many of the costs himself. Not surprisingly, Monmouthshire residents claimed that he used it as a private army. When Sir Trevor Williams was returned for parliament in 1667, &#145;six files of musketeers were sent to Monmouth to awe the town&#146;, according to a report by local MPs fourteen years later. They claimed that soldiers who had guarded the marquess's property rights in Wentwood Forest in 1678 had been &#145;employed to rob the country of their wood&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1672 Worcester was appointed lord president of the council in the marches of Wales, privy councillor (17 April), and knight of the Garter (29 May). He took his responsibilities seriously, attending nearly half of the privy council meetings during Charles II's reign. His opposition to the <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span> led the Commons to call for the abolition of the council in the marches and to petition the king for his removal from office in January 1681. Instead, Charles II advanced him to the title of duke of Beaufort (2 December 1682), reminding contemporaries that he was descended, albeit illegitimately, from King Edward III through John de Beaufort, eldest son of John of Gaunt. Beaufort was also given public recognition by Nahum Tate in his second part of <span class="italic">Absalom and Achitophel</span> (1682) in which he was characterized as Bezaliel, designer of the Tabernacle (<span class="roman">Exodus</span> 31:3)<blockquote>
<div>To Aid the Crown and State his greatest Zeal,<br>
</div>
<div>His Second Care that Service to Conceal.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Beaufort played a leading part in the tory reaction of the 1680s, reforming the county and borough magistracies, remodelling militia commands, and encouraging the surrender of corporate charters in Wales and the border counties. To this end, in 1684 he took a month-long ducal progress through Wales which was chronicled by Thomas Dineley in <span class="italic">Notitia Cambro-Britannica: a Voyage of North and South Wales</span> (printed eventually in 1864). The progress was marked by considerable pageantry, and onlookers marvelled at the &#145;splendour of the great man's equippage&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 70013, fol. 209). Lord Keeper Guilford, who visited Badminton in the early 1680s, noted the:<blockquote>princely way of living, which that noble duke used, above any other, except crowned heads, that I have had notice of in Europe; and, in some respects greater than most of them, to whom he might have been an example. (North, 1.169&#150;73)</blockquote>During the 1670s Badminton had been rebuilt in the fashionable Palladian style, with formal gardens and landscaped walks that imitated Louis XIV's Versailles. Here, Mary Somerset created a celebrated botanical garden with plants from Africa, Japan, the East Indies, and the Americas.<br>
<br>Beaufort supported the prince of Denmark as chief mourner at the funeral of Charles II (14 February 1685) and he bore the queen's crown at the coronation of James II (23 April). He was appointed gentleman of the bedchamber (16 May) and colonel of the 11th regiment of foot (20 June). In June he defended Bristol against the duke of Monmouth, raising twenty-one companies of foot and four troops of horse. He praised his Welsh troops as &#145;another complexion than that of theirs in Somersetshire, and being better disciplined, and more soldier-like than militias usually are&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 15892, fol. 214). James II spoke of his service with &#145;the greatest kindness&#146; and honoured him with a visit to Badminton on 24 September 1685, but he could not command his continued loyalty  (Badminton muniments, FmE 4/1/19). When the Chepstow Castle garrison was disbanded at the end of 1685 the duke wrote angrily of the &#145;great rejoicing it will cause among the factions, that have so often bragged they have got me out from my command there&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 15892, fol. 241). In 1688 Beaufort surrendered Bristol to troops led by the earl of Shrewsbury and Sir John Guise, claiming that the city was &#145;incapable of defense&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 41805, fols. 156&#150;7). He tried instead to keep Gloucestershire safe from invading forces, particularly as William, prince of Orange, had threatened to &#145;lay Badminton in ashes&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 130, fol. 307). Meanwhile, Beaufort's eldest surviving son and heir, Charles Somerset (1660&#150;1698), furnished himself with horses at his father's house in London and joined William at Exeter.<br>
<br>Beaufort was &#145;received very coldly&#146; when he tried to transfer his loyalties to William  (Singer, 2.227&#150;8). He took the oaths in March 1689 but refused to declare William and Mary his &#145;right and lawful&#146; sovereigns. He was removed from his lieutenancies in 1689 and thereafter retired from public life. On 7 September 1690 he entertained the king with a &#145;noble, but not satisfactory&#146; reception at Badminton  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Ailesbury</span>, 1.268). His refusal to sign the Association caused him to be suspected of conspiratorial activities, and government officials searched his house at Chelsea in 1696. In July 1698 his son died as a result of a coach accident in Wales, leaving Beaufort's fourteen-year-old grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26010/', "Henry Somerset (1684&#150;1714)")</script> heir to the Somerset estate. Beaufort himself died at Badminton on 21 January 1700 and was buried in the Beaufort chapel in St George's Chapel, Windsor; in 1878 his enormous baroque funeral monument was removed to Badminton. He was survived by his wife, Mary, who died in 1715. Apart from Henry, who had died young, and Charles, they had three younger sons and four daughters, of whom the second, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1733), had married, in 1685, James, duke of Ormond; the third, Henrietta (<i>d</i>. 1715), had married first, in 1686, Henry, Lord O'Brien, and second, Henry, earl of Suffolk; while the fourth, Anne [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6474/', "Coventry, Anne, countess of Coventry")</script>], had married, on 4 May 1691, Thomas, earl of Coventry.<br>
