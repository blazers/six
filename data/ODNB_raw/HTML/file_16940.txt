<span class="headword">Logan,  James</span>  (1797&#150;1872), <span class="occ">writer on Scottish Gaelic culture</span>, was born in Aberdeen on 13 March 1797, the son of a merchant there. He was educated at the local grammar school and afterwards at Marischal College. A fractured skull sustained while attending a highland games prevented him from following his intended career in law. From about 1821 it appears that he lived mainly in London, working as a writer and journalist, notably as a contributor to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. He served briefly as secretary of the Highland Society of London, and worked as a transcriber of the British Museum catalogue from 1838 to 1840. His failure to hold any formal post for long was owed apparently to his &#145;impatience of restraint&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), and he returned to freelance work, being supported during his later years by highland friends in London. At different times he is supposed to have enjoyed the patronage of Prince Albert and the fourth earl of Aberdeen. After suffering financial losses from bad investments, he sought assistance from the Royal Literary Fund and was nominated to a place among the poor brothers at the Charterhouse, London. Rusticated from the Charterhouse in 1864 for &#145;being habitually intoxicated&#146;, he was expelled for drunkenness in 1869  (Cross, 80).<br>
<br>In the mid-1820s Logan made extensive walking tours of the highlands and islands, which led to his most significant work, <span class="italic">The Scottish Gael</span>, which first appeared in 1831 (2 vols.). The book, which was dedicated to William IV, encompassed a wide range of topics, from archaeology to early nineteenth-century Gaelic literature, and included chapters on war, arms, dress, hunting, food, poetry and music, and religion. Many of its archaeological and historical conclusions are no longer acceptable, and he relies overmuch on the Ossianica of James Macpherson, but the work contains a lot of valuable commentary on highland mores and traditional lore, and here he shows a fairly good knowledge of Gaelic. <span class="italic">The Scottish Gael</span> was reissued with a memoir of the author and notes by Alexander Stewart in 1876.<br>
<br>Following the enthusiastic reception of his 1831 book Logan was asked by John Mackenzie to write an introduction to his <span class="italic">Beauties of Gaelic Poetry</span> (1841), in which he summarized and occasionally expanded upon points made in his earlier work. He supplied the text for <span class="italic">The Clans of the Scottish Highlands</span> (2 vols., 1845&#150;7), which consisted of original, if somewhat stereotyped, sketches of highland chiefs by R. R. McIan, and a &#145;Description and historical memoranda of character, mode of life, etc. etc.&#146; by Logan. This work won contemporary praise for the verisimilitude of the tartans.<br>
<br>Logan died at 66 Whitfield Street, St Pancras, London, on 29 March 1872. Undoubtedly many of his conclusions need to be modified or challenged in the light of more modern Celtic scholarship, but his positive contribution to a more sympathetic and informed attitude to Gaelic history and culture deserves to be recognized.<br>
