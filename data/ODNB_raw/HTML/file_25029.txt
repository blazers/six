<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Seemann,  Berthold Carl</span>  (1825&#150;1871), <span class="occ">botanist and traveller</span>, was born on 28 February 1825 at Hanover, the son of a clarinettist at the Court Theatre, and his wife, Caroline. From October 1835 until September 1838 he was educated at the <i>Lyceum</i> at Hanover, then under Georg Friedrich Grotefend, the philologist, from whose son he received his first botanical teaching. At Easter 1839 Seemann became an apprentice gardener at the royal kitchen garden at Linden but apparently found little satisfaction in his work. From 1842 until March 1845 he served as assistant to the master gardener, Wendland, at the royal hill garden.<br>
<br>Seemann's first botanical paper was written when he was just seventeen. In 1844 he moved to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and worked under John Smith, the curator, in order to train himself as a plant collector. In 1846 Sir William Jackson Hooker procured Seemann's appointment as naturalist to HMS <i>Herald</i>, then engaged on a hydrographical survey of the Pacific. Seemann left England in August 1846 to join the <i>Herald</i> in Panama. Finding that the ship had not returned from Vancouver he explored the isthmus, finding many new plants, besides hieroglyphics at Veraguas, which he described in a paper read before the Archaeological Institute. He joined the <i>Herald</i> on 17 January 1847, and remained with her until June 1851. Almost all the west coast of America was explored, and three cruises were made into Arctic seas. In Peru and Ecuador, Seemann travelled with Bedford Pim from Payta, Peru, through the desert and over the Andes to Guayaquil, Ecuador; in Mexico he went from Mazatl&aacute;n over the Sierra Madre to Durango and Chihuahua, narrowly escaping hostile Comanches and Apaches.<br>
<br>In 1848 the <i>Herald</i> was ordered to the Bering Strait to search for the Arctic explorer Sir John Franklin. Herald Island was discovered, and a higher latitude than any previously attained in that region was reached, while Seemann collected many plants and anthropological specimens relating to the Inuit, visited Kamtchatka and the Sandwich Islands several times, and finally returned home by Hong Kong, Singapore, the Cape, St Helena, and Ascension Island. <span class="italic">The Botany of the Voyage</span>, which was published between 1852 and 1857, with analyses by Hooker and 100 plates by W. H. Fitch, comprises the floras of Panama, north-west Mexico, &#145;West Esquimaux-land&#146; (Alaska), and Hong Kong. Seemann's <span class="italic">Narrative of the Voyage</span> was published in two volumes in English in 1853, the same year that he was made doctor of philosophy of G&ouml;ttingen, and was elected a member of the Imperial Academy Naturae Curiosorum (later the Leopoldine Academy) under the cognomen &#145;Bonpland&#146;. Also in 1853 he began, in conjunction with his brother Wilhelm, to edit a German journal of botany entitled <span class="italic">Bonplandia</span>, of which ten volumes were published at Hanover between 1853 and 1862. Finding himself increasingly Anglicized, he gave up the issue of this journal, and in 1863 began the publication of the <span class="italic">Journal of Botany, British and Foreign</span>, in the editing of which, from 1869, he was assisted by Henry Trimen and John Gilbert Baker. In 1857 he went to Montreal, representing the Linnean Society at the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and took the opportunity to visit the United States.<br>
<br>In early 1860 Seemann was commissioned by the Colonial Office, with Colonel Smythe, to report on the Fiji Islands, before the British government accepted their cession. In Fiji he made the ascent of Mount Voma and Mbuke Levu. His report was published in 1862 as <span class="italic">Viti: an Account of a Government Mission to the Vitian or Fijian Islands</span>. The appendix contained a catalogue of previously described plants of the islands, and some new species were described in <span class="italic">Bonplandia</span>. In the same year he contributed an essay, &#145;Fiji and its inhabitants&#146;, to Francis Galton's <span class="italic">Vacation Tourists</span>. In 1865 he began at his own expense the issue of a <span class="italic">Flora Vitiensis</span>, in ten parts with 100 plates, mostly by Fitch. Of this, nine parts, mainly written by himself, were published before his death. It was about this time that Seemann married an Englishwoman; she died about 1870. They had one daughter, Hildegarde Carolina Seemann, who survived him.<br>
<br>Partly in order to fund the publication of his <span class="italic">Flora Vitiensis</span>, in 1864 Seemann accepted a commission from the firm of Alexander Mendel at Amsterdam to report on the resources of Venezuela. There, near the Tocuyo River, he discovered a valuable bed of anthracite. From March to August 1866, and during 1867, he accompanied Bedford Pim to Nicaragua for the Central American Association. Seemann's letters to the <span class="italic">Athenaeum</span> and to the <span class="italic">Panama Star and Herald</span> were reprinted in 1869 as <span class="italic">Dottings on the Roadside in Panama, Nicaragua, and Mosquito</span>. One result of these journeys was the purchase by English entrepreneurs of the Javali goldmine, Chontales, Nicaragua, of which Seemann was appointed managing director. He had also the management of a large sugar estate near Panama.<br>
<br>Seemann became a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1852, and was a vice-president of the Anthropological Society and a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. In botany he made a special study of the genus <i>Camellia</i> (which includes the tea plant), of which he published a synopsis in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Linnean Society</span> (1859), and of the family Araliaceae (which includes ivy), his account of which was reprinted from the <span class="italic">Journal of Botany</span> in 1868. He introduced into cultivation the cannibal tomato, once eaten with human flesh in the Fiji Islands, the candle-tree (<i>Parmentiera cerifera</i>), and several handsome species of palm. E. Regel dedicated to him the genus <i>Seemannia</i>, gesneriads, perennial plants native to the Andes.<br>
<br>Seemann was a versatile and prolific writer. Besides the works already mentioned, he was the author of several scientific treatises, the most important of which were perhaps his <span class="italic">Die Volksnamen der amerikanischen Pflanzen</span> (1851), <span class="italic">Popular History of the Palms</span> (1856), and <span class="italic">The British Ferns at One View</span> (1860), a coloured chart. He also wrote numerous articles in periodicals in English, German, and other languages. The Royal Society <span class="italic">Catalogue</span> lists ninety-eight of those relating to science alone. He was also a composer of music, and was author of three short German plays: <span class="italic">Wahl macht Qual</span>, <span class="italic">Der Wohlth&auml;ter wider Willen</span>, and <span class="italic">Die gelben Rosen</span>, all published in 1867 at Hanover where they enjoyed some popularity.<br>
<br>In 1871, at Javali in Nicaragua, Seemann's health failed, and after three weeks' illness he died there of fever with possible cardiac complications on 10 October 1871. He was buried the following day close to his house at the mine.<br>
