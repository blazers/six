<span class="headword">MacDonald,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Iain Lom]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1624&#150;<em>c.</em>1710), <span class="occ">Scottish Gaelic poet</span>, the son of Donald MacDonald (<i>d</i>. 1646?), was apparently descended from Iain Alainn, who succeeded to the chiefship of the MacDonalds of Keppoch <i>c</i>.1497&#150;8. He has a high reputation as a political and clan poet, commenting on the affairs of the Keppoch MacDonalds and on the turbulent political events of a long period from the mid-1640s to the union of the parliaments in 1707. Tradition reports that he went to the Scots College at Valladolid in Spain to prepare for the priesthood, but left after disagreement. The range of his interests and references would seem to support the idea that he had some extended educational opportunities. At various points he is found using English and Scottish words and phrases in the body of his verse.<br>
<br>Among Iain Lom's earliest poems there is one on the battle of Inverlochy, during the Montrose wars, when the MacDonalds inflicted a humiliating defeat on the Campbells in 1645. Lom gloats over the Campbells' craven retreat, as he sees it. He is said to have given valuable advice, from his knowledge of the terrain, to Alasdair MacColla in the run-up to the battle. It was probably in the following year (1646) that he composed a lament for the young Keppoch chief who was killed in a skirmish at Sr&ograve;n a' Chlachain near Killin in Perthshire. The poet's father was also killed in this skirmish, but protocol required the main emphasis to be on the chief's death. There are three other laments composed by Iain Lom in this decade: for Alasdair MacColla in 1647, for the marquess of Huntly in 1649, and for the marquess of Montrose in 1650.<br>
<br>Gaelic poets continued throughout the seventeenth century to have official or semi-official status within clans, whether they were trained poets using the classical Gaelic language or vernacular poets who had looser attachments to patrons, and in this context much of Iain Lom's poetry is connected with the public activities of his clan, their allies, and their enemies. A series of poems deals with the murder of the young chief of Keppoch and his brother in 1663, and the successful campaign to avenge these murders. There are poems in praise of allies, such as Maclean of Duart and the MacDonalds of Sleat and of Glengarry, and some elegies for chiefs of these septs or clans. As part of this continuing commentary there are poems about specific battles, for example that of Tom a' Phubaill (<i>c</i>.1680) and Killiecrankie (1689), and a poem on the massacre of Glencoe (1692).<br>
<br>The latest poem ascribed to Iain Lom is one on the union of the parliaments in 1707. Some doubt has been cast on this ascription, but it shows the sharp, witty, satirical style in which Iain Lom excelled. The poet clearly accepted that bribery had played a part in this transaction, as appears from his reference to Lord Dupplin:<blockquote>
<div>Lord Dupplin, without delay<br>
</div>
<div>the vent to your throat opened,<br>
</div>
<div>a turbulence rose in your heart<br>
</div>
<div>when you heard the gold coming;<br>
</div>
<div>you swallowed the hiccoughs of avarice,<br>
</div>
<div>your lungs inflated and swelled,<br>
</div>
<div>control over your gullet was relaxed,<br>
</div>
<div>and the traces of your arse were unloosed.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>This is not simply a case of an old man's outspokenness, for we see him in 1649 reproaching the future Charles II for his &#145;sorry slumber&#146; and listlessness. In 1660 he was to celebrate this king's coronation, and it is said that he enjoyed a royal pension for a short time. He died about 1710, and is thought to have been buried in the graveyard of Cill Choiril at Brae Lochaber.<br>
<br>Iain Lom's surviving verse, running to about 3000 lines, provides a valuable commentary on political events and arguments. Characteristically, he employs vivid and figurative language across a wide tonal range from gentle adulation to fierce invective. His uncompromising, usually satiric, vision of these events also reveals a sharp, intellectual mind.<br>
