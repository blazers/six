<span class="headword">Hobart, Sir  Miles</span>  (1598/9&#150;1632), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the son of Miles Hobart of London and his third wife, Elizabeth. He was descended from William Hobart, brother of Henry VII's attorney-general Sir James Hobart. He matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford, on 30 June 1615, aged sixteen, and was admitted to Gray's Inn the following year. Knighted at Salisbury on 8 September 1623, when he was described as of Halford, Buckinghamshire, he sat for Marlow in the same county in the parliament of 1628&#150;9.<br>
<br>There is no history of Hobart's having refused to pay the forced loan in 1626&#150;8, but by 1629 he had become one of the group of activists led by Sir John Eliot and John Selden who staged a demonstration in the House of Commons on 2 March 1629. Their aim was to condemn religious change and unparliamentary taxation while preventing the dissolution or adjournment of parliament. During the tumultuous proceedings, as Eliot attempted to read a declaration stating their position while John Holles and Benjamin Valentine held the speaker down in his chair, Hobart locked the door of the house (the serjeant-at-arms having refused to do so) and pocketed the key. This was a significant act which committed Hobart visibly to the protest. It prevented the speaker or indeed any other member from leaving the chamber and the usher of the black rod from entering. The pretension of the house to adjourn itself at the conclusion of the protest was predicated on Hobart's action.<br>
<br>Hobart was one of nine members of the Commons arrested and interrogated after the session and whose recalcitrance encouraged the king's decision to dissolve the parliament. Hobart refused to give an account of his actions but did not deny having locked the door of the house. On 2 April he was sent close prisoner to the king's bench prison, and on 6 May he and five other of the prisoners sued for writs of habeas corpus, seeking bail. The petition of right (1628) could bear on the case and the cause of imprisonment notified by the crown was contempt and sedition. Hobart was also subject to the Star Chamber information filed by Sir Robert Heath, the attorney-general, which proceedings, answered by an appeal to parliamentary privilege, were later allowed to lapse. In May and June 1629 the habeas corpus arguments were heard in court and Hobart sensibly relied on Sir Edward Littleton's brief for Selden. On 23 June the prisoners were due to appear in court to be bailed, but the king subverted the authority of the law by placing them in the Tower of London where they languished throughout the summer. King Charles, in confronting a significant political and constitutional threat, sought to have the prisoners submit to his authority and legitimize his use of arbitrary imprisonment against them. The prisoners took out further writs for the first day of the Michaelmas term, and most refused a bond of good behaviour when brought before the judges in camera. In court on 5 October they again refused the bond&#151;which would have amounted to an admission of guilt&#151;and were remanded to prison. Hobart applied in vain for an alleviation of the conditions of his imprisonment. He was not tried with Eliot, Holles, and Valentine, the ringleaders in the parliamentary demonstration, but nevertheless chose to remain in prison for a further two years.<br>
<br>In 1631, at a time of plague, Hobart eventually gave the required sureties and was released. He died in a coaching accident in London on 29 June 1632 and was buried at Great Marlow on 4 July. On 18 January 1647 parliament voted &pound;500 to erect a monument to him there. Hobart was not a prominent parliamentary speaker and is famed for his actions more than his words. He leaves the impression of a practical and principled individual who showed solidarity with his parliamentary associates in the face of royal wrath. The events in which Hobart participated in 1629&#150;30 give him an enduring place in English history: they influenced Charles I in his eventual rejection of parliament and European war as well as revealing his inclination to arbitrary rule.<br>
