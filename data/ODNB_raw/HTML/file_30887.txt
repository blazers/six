<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Butlin, Sir  William Heygate Edmund Colborne <span class="st"> [Billy]</span></span>  (1899&#150;1980), <span class="occ">fairground proprietor and founder of holiday camps</span>, was born in Cape Town, Cape Colony, where his parents had emigrated, on 29 September 1899, the elder child of William Butlin and Bertha Hill (<i>d</i>. 1933). His parents came from contrasting social backgrounds: his father, scion of west-country clergymen, was genteel and preferred playing tennis to running the cycle-importing business which was supposed to support them, while his mother, daughter of a baker turned fairground showman, was left holding the reins of the business as well as the babies. She brought Billy (as he was always known) and his brother back to England, and took up the itinerant life of a gingerbread seller at west-country fairs. Butlin lodged with his aunt until his brother died of infantile paralysis, whereupon he joined his mother with her horse and caravan. His schooling, which had begun only when he was eight, therefore became intermittent. Bertha then married again and emigrated to Canada with her second husband, Charlie Rowbotham, a Bristol gas fitter, fostering out Billy until they sent for him in 1912.<br>
<br>In Toronto, Butlin started work as a messenger boy, but, realizing that he had an aptitude for art, he studied at night school and graduated to drawing advertisements for Eatons department store. The outbreak of war saw him become one of the Canadian army's youngest (and smallest) soldiers serving in France, where he survived the lousy life of the trenches as a stretcher-bearer. After demobilization, he returned to Eatons to draw, but was lured by memories of the outdoor life of a travelling showman. In 1921 he worked his passage back to England and received a warm welcome from his mother's family on their west-country fair circuit.<br>
<br>Butlin's uncles set him up with a hoopla stall and, from such small beginnings, within thirteen years he rose to become &#145;one of the most successful showmen in Europe&#146;  (Butlin and Dacre, 30). He displayed great business acumen, aiming for quick returns and a memorable image to attract custom. His trade mark of an enormous embroidered B on a white jacket dates from this period. His readiness to innovate was demonstrated in 1922 when he took his (distinctively decorated) stall to the Christmas circus established by Bertram Mills at London's Olympia. Here he met prosperous showmen wintering away from the seaside resorts, and over the next few years he realized that they were benefiting from the new motor charabanc trade which was beginning to damage the vitality of the rural fairs at which Butlin made his summer living. From these contacts he learned about a resort in seemingly remote Lincolnshire, and by early 1927 had visited Skegness, assessed its potential, and established an amusement park there&#151;with hoopla stalls, a helter-skelter, a haunted house, and an electric car track. Butlin observed the public's fondness for birds and animals, and quickly followed the amusement park with a zoo, and another park at nearby Mablethorpe. He was no longer a travelling showman, though he continued to live in a caravan (a luxury one) next to his mother, whom he had brought back to Britain in 1925.<br>
<br>In 1928 Butlin introduced the American-made Dodgems to Skegness. More importantly, he secured the sole European agency for their sale. This was &#145;a major turning point&#146; in his life, for with that success he &#145;came into the really big money&#146;  (Butlin and Dacre, 89). By the mid-1930s he had a chain of fairgrounds around the coast and complementary winter amusement centres in London, though the trade was sometimes rough, and Butlin carried a cut-throat razor in his top pocket. He also ran the Christmas fairs at Kelvin Hall, Glasgow, and Waverley Hall, Edinburgh, as well as at Olympia. Until her death in 1933 Butlin's finances and several of his ventures were managed by his remarkable mother&#151;&#145;always dressed in black alpaca, with a bunch of keys dangling from a gold chain around her waist &hellip; [giving] the impression of being a woman not to be trifled with&#146;  (Butlin and Dacre, 100).<br>
<br>Thus Bertha helped Butlin to accumulate the necessary savings towards, but did not live to see the inception of, the venture which made him a national figure&#151;his first holiday camp, opened at Skegness, at Easter 1936. The idea had grown from Butlin's observation of families on sodden seaside holidays sheltering from the rain in amusement parks, forbidden by landladies to return between mealtimes to their boarding-houses. He contrasted this with the happy holiday atmosphere he had enjoyed in 1914 at a lakeside camp provided by Eatons for its employees, and dreamed that he could create a similar camp in Britain, but with provision against the variable British climate.<br>
<br>The idea of summer holiday camps was not new in Britain, as Butlin acknowledged. His scheme had been preceded by numerous private, philanthropic, and self-help ventures. However, although Butlins was aiming at lower- and middle-income groups at this time, he was offering a &#145;Luxury Holiday Camp&#146;&#151;with electric lighting, and 250 bathrooms for 1000 people. His plans included a theatre, a gymnasium, a swimming-pool, and many other indoor and outdoor sports facilities, all set in landscaped grounds. Such facilities necessitated economies of scale, and large numbers made the desirable camaraderie of a camp initially difficult to achieve, but Butlin's inspired innovation of organized jollity supplied by his &#145;Redcoats&#146; broke down the campers' reserve. Many became regular visitors, encouraged by winter campers' reunions, the first of which was held at Olympia on new year's eve 1936. They were not deterred by criticisms of the &#145;Wakey-wakey, rise and shine&#146; atmosphere, which to outsiders seemed like regimentation, but which was regarded by campers as a &#145;matey&#146; necessity in the organization of their holiday. Moreover, Butlins was unique in making special arrangements for children, allowing husband and wife unparalleled freedom together. The camp was expanded to 2000 beds in the second year, and Butlin instituted Sunday night celebrity concerts by variety theatre and radio stars to entertain and attract them. In his third year he made another brilliant stroke, which gave him mayoral endorsements and publicity throughout England&#151;a regionalized beauty contest with a final at the Skegness carnival.<br>
<br>Butlin's success should also be seen in context. England was recovering from the depression, the <span class="roman">Holidays with Pay Bill</span> was under discussion, and, at &pound;3 in high season, he was offering a week's holiday at a new standard for the price of a good week's wage. Butlin lobbied actively for the bill which was passed in 1938. Despite enormous difficulties in the building of the Skegness camp (successfully hidden from his creditors), Butlin achieved his dream, and Butlins Ltd was floated in order to finance further expansion. A second camp was opened at Clacton in 1938, the advertising for which (like that of Skegness) was half funded by the London and North-Eastern Railway, on whose lines the camps lay. Butlin's genius for public relations was displayed again, as he successfully invited prominent figures like Amy Johnson, Victor Sylvester, Len Hutton, and Gracie Fields&#151;to the delight of the campers. In 1938 Butlin also staged the Empire Exhibition at Glasgow. The man who had arrived in 1921 with &pound;5 was now worth tens of thousands.<br>
<br>The Second World War interrupted Butlin's progress. His camps were sequestered for military purposes: Skegness, for instance, was renamed HMS <i>Royal Arthur</i> by the Royal Navy (and subsequently claimed by Lord Haw-Haw to have been sunk with all hands!). Nevertheless, Butlin was able to finish building his half-completed third camp, at Filey, for the RAF, and tendered successfully to build two more for the navy, at Pwllheli and Ayr&#151;entering into a risky but valuable contract to buy these three back when the war ended, at three-fifths of their building costs.<br>
<br>During the rest of the war Butlin fulfilled a number of roles. For Lord Beaverbrook at the Ministry of Supply he sorted out problems of morale in the hostels occupied by women workers in the munitions industry, particularly by providing relaxation facilities&#151;so that &#145;hostels&#146; became &#145;residential clubs&#146;. In 1943 he brought his fairground rides out of retirement to promote &#145;Holidays at Home&#146; weeks for workers trapped by wartime travel restrictions. In 1944 he was appointed MBE for his hostel work, and embarked on his final wartime task, as honorary adviser to the twenty-first army group regarding leave centres in Europe following the allied invasion. Butlin successfully established nine &#145;21 Clubs&#146;, where servicemen could relax with carefully vetted young women, in the Low Countries and Germany.<br>
<br>The return of peace meant Butlin could resume his career as holiday camp caterer. He activated the buy-back clause on Filey, Pwllheli, and Ayr, and thus, with Skegness and Clacton, was well placed to cater for the huge pent-up demand for holidays. Butlin opened Filey, his showplace, with typically flamboyant strokes. Tommy Handley and the <span class="italic">ITMA</span> cast appeared under the slogan &#145;Stars You Have Heard&#151;But Seldom Seen&#146;. Music lovers were attracted by an extravagant production of <span class="italic">La Boh&egrave;me</span> imported from Naples, and Shakespearian aficionados by the Bristol Old Vic Company. Such ventures helped to counter criticisms of standardization and mass-produced entertainment, and there are indications that large numbers of campers in the 1940s were middle-class. Holidays with pay were now well-nigh universal, but taking an entire family on holiday was still a pricey business, and, with tariffs increased to nearly &pound;1 a day, many working-class families did not find it easy. Nevertheless, Butlin claimed 1.6 million people visited his camps in the late 1940s.<br>
<br>By 1947 Butlin was a millionaire. In 1948, however, he overextended himself, and nearly suffered disaster. Together with A. C. Critchley he set up Butlins (Bahamas) Ltd to create a luxurious holiday village to tempt American tourists. Problems with labour and local politicians, sterling crises, and Critchley's failure to raise a promised reserve of City money, all topped off by the effect of the Korean War on American investors, together conspired to drive the company into liquidation. Butlin himself was &#145;virtually broke&#146;  (Butlin and Dacre, 194). Moreover, he had neglected his British operations. The result was an attempt by City investors to oust him from control of Butlins. He was not a man to back down in the face of difficulties, however, and by mobilizing the small shareholders on his side he kept control of the company.<br>
<br>During the 1950s Butlin reasserted himself in the public eye by sponsoring or taking part in various events such as the cross-channel swim, and the John o' Groats to Land's End walk. His promotion of ballroom dance festivals brought considerable business to his camps as well as contributing to the popularity of the pastime. He maintained that his secret was to give people what he liked, which because he was an ordinary person meant that he gave his customers what they liked. He listened to what they said and learned from it. He bought several chains of hotels, and then opened three more camps, at Bognor Regis in 1960, Minehead in 1962, and Barry Island in 1966, thus establishing a camp within 200 miles of every major centre of population. In 1961 the company's stated aim was to cater for &#145;the middle income group&#146;  (Ward and Hardy, 110), though it also chased the growing youth market, and isolated parts of the camps were given over to big parties of teenagers. A seal of respectability was provided by the visit of the queen to Pwllheli in 1963, and in 1964 &#145;Mr Happiness&#146; was knighted.<br>
<br>Butlin told his associates that his aims in life were &#145;money, power, and women&#146; (<span class="italic"><span class="roman">&#145;Billy Butlin&#146;,</span> Secret Lives</span>, Channel 4, 26 Nov 1997). He was a short, stocky man, of enormous drive, with an engaging grin and an engrossing personality. However, in his dealings with his staff, bonhomie was sometimes overlaid by a cold autocracy. He demanded total commitment to the business although this had harmed his own private life. On 29 March 1927 he had married Dorothy Mabel (Dolly), daughter of John Cheriton, fish-and-chip shop proprietor, of Tiverton. Their marriage (which produced a daughter) deteriorated as Butlin spent all his time building up his business. By 1938 Dolly's &#145;sister&#146; Norah Faith (in reality her niece) was acting as his housekeeper and hostess, and then as mother to three children, including Bobby, his successor at Butlins (actually Norah's son from an earlier marriage, whom Billy adopted). Dolly refused him a divorce, but her death in 1958 allowed him to marry Norah on 21 September the following year. The marriage was principally for the sake of their children, for Norah's relationship with Butlin had deteriorated as early as the 1940s, for similar reasons to Dolly's. Butlin soon found solace, however, with Sheila, the nineteen-year-old daughter of Walter Devine, a multiple grocer of Liverpool, who appreciated how far business was always Butlin's priority after he quickly installed her as chief receptionist at his London office. He had two children with her, this time being less of an absentee father, and following his divorce from Norah in 1975 married her in September 1976.<br>
<br>By now Butlin had retired to Jersey. Public tastes and competitors' strategies had begun to change by the mid-1960s; package holidays abroad and self-catering holiday camps at home began to diminish the camps' profitability. In 1968 a cash-flow crisis in the face of a tax demand prompted Butlin suddenly to hand over the company to his son Bobby. Butlin chafed at his non-involvement in the business, and resented changes instituted by Bobby; however, father and son came together to fight off a take-over bid from Phonographic Equipment, a firm which supplied gambling machines, which both regarded as unsuitable to Butlins' family image. By 1972 the company was back in profit, and in a friendly take-over (possibly engineered by Butlin himself) it was sold to the Rank Organization for &pound;43 million.<br>
<br>Butlin devoted time to gardening on a grand scale at Blair Adam House, his Jersey home, and to enjoying his aviary of 1200 budgerigars; but he was incapable of fully retiring, and built up new business interests on Jersey, including several hotels and a holiday village, as well as playing the stock market. He also became more deeply involved in charity work, particularly through the Variety Club of Great Britain (on which he had been a formative influence during the 1950s) and the Grand Order of Water Rats; altogether he donated at least &pound;5 million, chiefly to underprivileged children. His choice of charities was typical of the showman, although his friends and family also recalled his shy and unostentatious side. He died of stomach cancer at Blair Adam House, Jersey, on 12 June 1980, and was buried in St John's cemetery, Jersey.<br>
