<span class="headword">Ker,  Robert</span>, first earl of Ancram  (1578&#150;1654), <span class="occ">courtier and politician</span>, was the eldest son of William Ker of Ancram (<i>d</i>. 1590) and Margaret, daughter of Alexander Dundas of Fingask. His father was assassinated in 1590 and his mother subsequently married Sir George Douglas of Mordington. In 1604 Ker was appointed groom of the bedchamber in the household established for Prince Henry and Princess Elizabeth, and by 1607 he had been knighted, and had married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1620), daughter of Sir John Murray of Blackbarony. Early in 1607 he went abroad &#145;for doing my lawfull affaires and bissiness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.8&#150;9). He was in Paris in March 1608, and after his return to Britain again gained office at court, as a gentleman of the privy chamber and captain of the king's guard in Scotland. Following the death of Prince Henry in November 1612 he became a gentleman of the bedchamber to Prince Charles and resigned his captaincy of the Scottish guard so that he could attend the prince regularly. In 1616 he was granted a pension of &pound;2400 Scots (&pound;200 sterling) from Scottish revenues. A duel with Charles Maxwell of Terregles in February 1620 briefly interrupted his career at court. Ker killed his opponent in the duel, fought near Newmarket, and was banished on being found guilty of manslaughter, but there was agreement that his opponent (who had previously twice killed opponents in duels) had been at fault. He was, therefore, pardoned in October and returned to his duties at court. His first wife having died, in 1621 Ker married Anne Portman, eldest daughter of William Stanley, sixth earl of Derby, and widow of Sir Henry Portman.<br>
<br>In January 1623 Prince Charles set out for Spain, accompanied by the duke of Buckingham, to woo the Spanish infanta, and in April Ker and other courtiers left to join them in Spain, returning with the prince in November. Grants to him by the prince indicate his regard. In December 1622 he was paid &pound;1000 sterling, and in April 1623 King James authorized pensions for him and his wife: the latter, worth &pound;500 sterling a year, brought an agonized comment from the English treasurer about &#145;the King's favours to his servants being without end&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.xvi).<br>
<br>Ker's career at court continued to prosper after his master, Charles, acceded to the throne in 1625, and Ker sat in the English parliament for Aylesbury in 1625 and for Preston in 1628&#150;9. The marriage of his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15468/', "William Kerr")</script>, to the countess of Lothian led to William's being created earl of Lothian, and Ker busied himself in ensuring that his son could live up to the new rank. Ker was evidently made a baronet in 1631, and was admitted to the Scottish privy council on 23 June 1631, but he saw his future as continuing to lie primarily in England and transferred Ancram and other lands in Scotland to his son. He accompanied King Charles on his visit to Scotland in 1633, as master of the privy purse, and in the coronation honours was created earl of Ancram on 24 June. This was the pinnacle of his career. In 1639 he evidently lost the keepership of the privy purse. Some attributed this to his &#145;long and evident infirmity&#146;, others to retaliation for the support his son Lothian was giving to the Scottish covenanters in resisting the religious policies of Charles I  (ibid., 1.xx). Ancram kept his post as a gentleman of the bedchamber until about 1644, but age had probably prevented him remaining with the king after the outbreak of civil war in 1642 and letters in 1643 were addressed to him in London. The pension granted him many years before was now paid irregularly, and by 1647 he was having to seek protection from debtors.<br>
<br>The execution of the king in January 1649 led Ancram to reflect that &#145;I am creeping down the hill, or rather upp the hill from this world to a better&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.xxii). The execution and the abolition of monarchy were probably joined by financial considerations, as his pension was no longer paid at all, in persuading him to leave London, and in November 1649 he was staying at his son's house of Newbattle; but he found no safe refuge there, as his arrival at Dordrecht in the Netherlands in September 1650 evidently reflects his reaction to Cromwell's invasion of Scotland. Ancram settled in Amsterdam, and his last years were ones of struggling to subsist. &#145;I am now leirn'd to be &#147;penny wyse&#148;, though I was formerly &#147;pound foole&#148;&#146;  (ibid., 1.xxiv). After being visited by two of his grandsons he wrote to Lothian, their father, &#145;there is nobody more dear than you and yours are to your most loving father&#146;  (ibid., 1.xxv). This, written on 9 December 1654, was his last letter, and he died, in Amsterdam, with &#145;satisfaction to himself&#146; and &#145;the great content and admiration&#146; of those who were with him, on 18 December  (NA Scot., GD40/XII/42). A year before he had been &#145;striving, by God's assistance, to be ready to die&#146;, and had desired a quiet burial, without pomp or fuss  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.xxv). In the event his Dutch creditors prevented his body being buried at all, and even after some of his debts were paid he was still unburied in May 1655, when Cromwell intervened to demand that the funeral be allowed to take place. When he was finally interred is unknown.<br>
<br>Ancram spent his life as a courtier, and showed no sign of trying to gain political influence or use his position to advance any faction except personal and family interests. Beyond family and court, his main interests were literary. He corresponded with the poets William Drummond of Hawthornden and John Donne, and looked after Donne's papers while he was abroad. When Samuel Daniel died in 1619 he left his papers to Ancram. Having heard psalms sung in French and Dutch translations, Ancram himself in the early 1620s translated some of the psalms into English to be sung to the same tunes. Thus three parts of &#145;the Reformed Church&#146; separated by language through &#145;the curse which [God] inflicted on mankynd at Babell&#146; could, he hoped, worship God &#145;with one hart and voice &hellip; howsoever they differed in speech&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.2.488). But Ancram modestly did this work for recreation, and his psalms remained unpublished until 1875. A sonnet in praise of a solitary life was inspired by a sleepless night in the bedchamber at court in 1624, but declaring his poems &#145;few and evil&#146; he merely sent his &#145;starved rhime&#146; to his friend Drummond.<br>
