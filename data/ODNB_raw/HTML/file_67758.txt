<span class="headword">Corey <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Mitchell]</span>,  Katherine</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1635), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born Katherine Mitchell to parents whose names are as yet unknown, and was already a widow when in 1662 she married John Cory or Corey (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1637); he was perhaps the dramatist John Corye whose <span class="italic">The Generous Enemies</span> was performed by the King's Company about June 1671. It has been suggested that the John Corey baptized at St Clement Danes in 1668, probably their son, was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6312/', "John Corey")</script>, later an actor and playwright. She was one of the first actresses on the English stage, appearing for the first time in theatrical records in the roster of the King's Company in 1661&#150;2. In a lawsuit of March 1689 she claimed that she was &#145;the first, and is the last of all the Actresses that were constituted by King Charles the Second at His Restauration&#146;, though cases have been made for awarding the title of &#145;first English actress&#146; to others  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 3.495). Her first recorded role (as Mrs Coary) was Julia in John Ford's <span class="italic">Love's Sacrifice</span> (before August 1664), though she may have been the Mrs Covey listed for the production of John Wilson's <span class="italic">The Cheats</span> performed in 1663.<br>
<br>Mrs Corey played mostly comic roles, specializing in older women and widows. One of her most famous was Widow Blackacre in William Wycherley's <span class="italic">The Plain Dealer</span>, a role she originated in 1676. She also played Margery Pinchwife's maid, Lucy, in <span class="italic">The Country Wife</span> (1675), and in 1677 Sysigambis in Nathaniel Lee's <span class="italic">The Rival Queens</span> and Octavia, the scorned wife of Antony, in Dryden's <span class="italic">All for Love</span>. With other actors from the King's Company she may have performed in Edinburgh in 1679, staying perhaps until 1682. After the union of the two London companies in that year she played Mopsophil in Behn's <span class="italic">The Emperour of the Moon</span> (1687), Teresia in Thomas D'Urfey's adaptation of George Chapman's <span class="italic">Bussy D'Ambois</span> (1691), and Mrs Teazall in Thomas Southerne's <span class="italic">The Wives' Excuse</span> (1691). Her salary peaked at the good sum of 30<i>s</i>. per week, as admitted by the 1694 &#145;reply of the patentees&#146; over the playhouse rebellion of that time. The reply notes that the actress Elinor Leigh receives that amount, &#145;being as much as ever Mrs Cory had who was Extraordinarily well received by the Audience&#146;  (Milhous, <span class="italic">Thomas Betterton</span>, 245).<br>
<br>One interesting story about Corey may indicate her court connections as well as her brand of comedy. While performing Sempronia in Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Catiline's Conspiracy</span> in late 1668 or early 1669, she apparently impersonated the court intriguer Lady Harvey, which caused offence. Lady Harvey had her imprisoned, though one of the king's mistresses, Lady Castlemaine, as Samuel Pepys notes, &#145;made the King to release her, and to order her to act it again worse than ever the other day&#146; while the king was in attendance. Results show the hazards of being an early performer: &#145;my Lady Harvy provided people to hiss her and fling oranges at her. But it seems the heat is come to a great heighth, and real troubles at Court about it&#146;  (Pepys, 9.415).<br>
<br>The only other trouble relating to Corey and her career occurred in 1689: apparently Henry Killigrew had tried to set up a new company under the new monarchs William and Mary and had invited Corey to be a member, along with other popular comedians such as Anthony Leigh and James Nokes. Because of their insurrection, all the players involved were discharged from the company. All were subsequently readmitted, except for Corey, who petitioned to the lord chamberlain in March. He readmitted her, &#145;like the rest of the rebels&#146;, to the company on 11 March  (Milhous, <span class="italic">Thomas Betterton</span>, 53). Her last performance seems to have been as Morossa in Anthony Rivers's <span class="italic">The Traytor</span> (1692), and her disappearance from cast lists after that date indicates that she probably retired after the 1691/2 theatrical season. No death date is known, and very little information exists about Corey beyond these professional details. In sum her career seems to have been one of success. Never the tragedy heroine or the flirtatious ing&eacute;nue, Corey built a solid, long, popular career in strong comic supporting roles.<br>
