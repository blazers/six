<span class="headword">Railton,  Herbert</span>  (1857&#150;1910), <span class="occ">illustrator</span>, was born on 21 November 1857 at Brownlow House, Pleasington, near Blackburn, Lancashire, the fourth child in the Roman Catholic family of John Railton, an iron- and brass-founder and a JP. He was the eldest of his father's three children from his second marriage, to Eliza Ann Alexander, and was educated at Mechelen, Belgium, and at Ampleforth College in Yorkshire. He was then apprenticed to the Blackburn architect W. S. Varley, where he showed great promise as a draughtsman; in 1883 he had drawings published in a local guidebook. Realizing where his vocation lay, in 1885 he went to London, where he shared a studio with Louis Wain and John Jellicoe. Railton and Jellicoe jointly illustrated theatrical scenes for the <span class="italic">Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News</span>, Jellicoe drawing the figures with Railton providing the scenery. This combination of talents found further outlet in reprints of the novels of Anne Manning, published between 1897 and 1899.<br>
<br>Railton became increasingly prominent in the &#145;black and white school&#146; which flourished as a result of the introduction of photomechanical processes of reproduction into the commercial periodicals market: indeed, the crucial replacement of wood-engraving by the line-block (which allowed the draughtsman to reproduce his own lines on the page) occurred in 1886 in the <span class="italic">English Illustrated Magazine</span>, a journal which employed Railton extensively. Railton's illustration reflected his initial training, the architectural exterior being his speciality. Castles, cathedrals, great houses, and high streets came in profusion from his pen, although he was versatile enough to enjoy success with Macmillan's jubilee edition of <span class="italic">The Pickwick Papers</span> (1901). Railton also drew for <span class="italic">Good Words</span>, <span class="italic">The Graphic</span>, the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, <span class="italic">The Portfolio</span>, and the <span class="italic">Magazine of Art</span>. At the height of his career he was earning considerable sums, although he was frequently short of money. Some of the series of articles which he illustrated later appeared as monographs: W. J. Loftie's <span class="italic">Westminster Abbey</span> (1890), <span class="italic">The Inns of Court</span> (1893), and <span class="italic">Windsor</span> (1896) had first appeared in <span class="italic">The Portfolio</span>, and W. O. Tristram's <span class="italic">Coaching Days and Coaching Ways</span>, which he illustrated jointly with Hugh Thomson for the <span class="italic">English Illustrated Magazine</span>, was published in 1888 in book form by Macmillan with great success.<br>
<br>In 1887 Railton was fortunate enough to meet the fledgeling publisher J. M. Dent and was engaged to illustrate the <span class="roman">Temple Library</span> series. On 19 September 1891 he married the artist Frances (Fanny) Janetta Edney with whom he collaborated on Dent's elaborate gift books. Coloured lithographs in C. W. Stubbs's <span class="italic">Cambridge and its Story</span> (1903), Cecil Headlam's <span class="italic">Oxford and its Story</span> (1904), and W. O. Smeaton's <span class="italic">Edinburgh and its Story</span> (1904) were tinted by Mrs Railton, whose own drawings for <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> (1901) reveal a delicacy of line. Herbert's lithographs, together with pen drawings from the texts, were reproduced in black and white in Dent's <span class="roman">Mediaeval Towns</span> series, for which he illustrated Bruges, Chartres, and London. Other work for Dent included the <span class="roman">Temple Edition</span> of the novels of Walter Scott (1897) and Boswell's <span class="italic">Life of Johnson</span> (1901). For the publisher Isbister he illustrated ten titles in the <span class="roman">English Cathedrals</span> series (1897&#150;9). At this time he was also engaged on two de luxe editions for Freemantle, Gilbert White's <span class="italic">Natural History of Selborne</span> (1900) and Leigh Hunt's <span class="italic">The Old Court Suburb</span> (1902). Among other substantial projects were J. W. Brown's <span class="italic">The Builders of Florence</span> (1907) and W. O. Tristram's <span class="italic">Moated Houses</span> (1910), both published by Methuen.<br>
<br>Joseph Pennell claimed that Railton was influenced by the styles of Martin Rico y Ortega (1833&#150;1908) and Daniel Urrabieta y Vierge (1851&#150;1904), Spanish masters of pen drawing, but he rapidly developed his own, distinctive broken-line technique which enthused many followers, few of whom reached his standard. Because his style did not vary, critics found him boring, but the combination of picturesque subject matter and delicate penwork greatly appealed to the general public. According to the critic and novelist Frank Swinnerton, Railton was fond of a drink and drew better in a &#145;state of expansiveness&#146;. During his final illness he was without money and asked J. M. Dent to help his wife and child. He died from pneumonia on 10 March 1910 in St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, and was buried in Kensal Green Roman Catholic cemetery. He was survived by his wife and daughter. Examples of his work, including a self-portrait, are held in Blackburn Art Gallery.<br>
