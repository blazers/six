<span class="headword">Shute,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1660), <span class="occ">merchant and local politician</span>, was a resident of St Lawrence Jewry in or before 1629. In that year his infant son was baptized there, the first of three of his children whose baptisms were recorded in the parish register, but nothing is known about the family or geographical origins of Shute or his wife, Mary. In the early 1630s Shute served as a sidesman and collector for the poor in St Lawrence Jewry. A member of the Haberdashers' Company, he was apparently not as prosperous in his early career as he later became. In a London assessment of 1638 he was rated with the middling sort, and a political detractor ridiculed him in 1643 as &#145;that broken citizen, out at elbowes, called Satten Shute&#146;  (&#145;Letter from Mercurius Civicus&#146;, 4.596).<br>
<br>Some time before 1640 Shute seems to have become a factor for Maurice Thompson (or Thomson), an interloping colonial trader and one of the most notable London merchants of the era. Thereafter Shute became highly visible among the new colonial merchants who gained commercial and political ascendancy in London during the civil war years: in 1642 he became a commissioner for the &#145;additional sea adventure&#146; to Ireland, an enterprise in which numerous investors undertook to raise a military expedition in return for lands confiscated from Irish rebels; and the following year he became collector of tonnage and poundage for the port of London. In 1647 Shute and Thompson were part of a syndicate that sought to replace the existing customs commission, and in 1648 they were involved in a contract for provisioning the army in Ireland. By the late 1640s the geographical scope of Shute's commercial interests had extended to Brazil, to the East Indies (as an interloper), and possibly to the Guinea&#150;West Indies slave trade. In 1648 one of several ships of which he was part owner was lost to the Dutch off the coast of Brazil with a cargo valued at &pound;30,000.<br>
<br>Shute emerged as a militant London puritan spokesman in the early 1640s. In September 1640 he and Thompson presented a petition, which they had promoted in the City, to Charles I at York. Reportedly bearing 10,000 signatures, it demanded a meeting of parliament and an end to the regime's fiscal and religious innovations. When relations between the king and the leadership of the Commons collapsed in January 1642, Shute was named to the London militia committee, and he also served as treasurer of the parliamentary committee of safety. He worked with Lord Mayor Isaac Penington to assist John Pym and the Commons leaders in organizing their war effort.<br>
<br>With Sir David Watkins, Randall Mainwaring, and others, Shute presented petitions to the Commons in November and December 1642 that condemned efforts at reconciliation with the king and deplored the inadequate organization of the parliamentarian army. The petitioners offered to raise a London cavalry troop and Shute became active in raising funds for it. The petitioners also proposed two innovations for financing the war. The first of these was the system of weekly assessments in London that was quickly adopted by parliament and extended throughout the country; Shute served as a treasurer for the weekly assessments in London. The second proposal, which encouraged the imposition of reparations on active royalists, was not fully adopted until 1644. Shute was eventually appointed to the commission for compounding with royalists who were delinquent in paying their fines.<br>
<br>The culmination of Shute's petitioning activities came on 30 March 1643 when he and his associates presented a further &#145;petition and remonstrance&#146; to common council and to parliament. Their offer to raise and finance volunteer troops was accepted by parliament, and the committee established at Salters' Hall to superintend this endeavour superseded Shute's earlier military fund-raising. The language of the remonstrance reflected the advanced constitutional position occupied by Shute and his friends. Anticipating some of the Leveller programme, it asserted that &#145;originally the Supreme power&#146; was &#145;in the whole people&#146; and that annual parliaments should exercise that power in trust, without royal restraint, for the peace and safety of the kingdom  (<span class="italic">Remonstrans Redivivus</span>, 4).<br>
<br>Shute was less active after 1643, having been reprimanded by the Commons in December 1642 for his intemperate denunciation of a London peace petition. He was a member of the vestry for the parish of St Katharine Cree in 1644&#150;6, and in 1645&#150;8 he was a trier in the London classis of the reformed national church. However, Shute's association with London Independent clergy such as Jeremiah Burroughs, John Goodwin, and Hugh Peters during the petitions of 1642&#150;3 suggests that his identification with the national establishment was weakening. He was an author of the 1647 <span class="italic">Declaration by Congregational Societies in, and about the City of London</span>, which sought to distance religious Independency from the Levellers.<br>
<br>After the New Model Army's intervention in London in 1648 Shute was returned to the common council for the ward of Langbourn in 1649 and 1650. He was a prominent civic friend of the army leadership and served on new commissions for the London militia and assessments and for the navy and customs. He supported the revolution in city politics that transferred power from the lord mayor and aldermen to the common council, and he was a member of a civic delegation to the Rump Parliament that demanded that Charles I be held accountable for warring against the nation. He was twice nominated for the court of aldermen in 1649 and was nominated again in 1651, but he was not elected. He sat on a court that tried prominent royalists in 1649, and was appointed to the high courts of justice of the Commonwealth and protectorate in 1650, 1653, and 1654. He was one of the signatories of another declaration of the London independent churches in 1651. In 1653 Shute and two partners made an unsuccessful proposal to take over the foreign post for England, Scotland, and Ireland.<br>
<br>Shute was apparently still in England in 1658, but he died in 1660, between 2 August, when he made his will, and 25 October, when it was proved, &#145;in parts beyond the seas&#146;. He had perhaps emigrated or fled after the Restoration  (Blagg, 544).<br>
