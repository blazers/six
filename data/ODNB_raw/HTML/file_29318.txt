<span class="headword">Whitelocke <span class="st"> [Whitlock]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1520&#150;1584), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born at Wokingham, Berkshire, the eldest son of Richard Whitelocke, holder of the manor of Beaches in Wokingham; his mother was said to be a member of the Grove family from Fingest, Buckinghamshire. After attending Eton College, he was admitted to King's College, Cambridge, in 1537 and graduated BA in 1542, proceeding MA in 1545 and BTh in 1553. He was a fellow of the college between 1540 and 1560, and, as vice-provost, was presented in December 1558 to the vicarage of Prescot in Lancashire; in July 1560 he was admitted to the rectory of Greenford, Middlesex, on the presentation of Sir Edward Thornton. He was collated in March 1561 by Bishop Thomas Bentham to the prebend of Curborough in Lichfield Cathedral, &#145;in which church&#146;, according to his uncle Sir James Whitelocke, &#145;he lived for the latter part of his time altogeather&#146;  (Bruce, 3).<br>
<br>One of the few clergymen of the period to make a significant contribution to antiquarian studies, Whitelocke completed the first draft of a history of the cathedral church of Lichfield in 1569. His &#145;Chronicon Lichefeldensis ecclesie&#146;, which was compiled at the request of a fellow canon who was curious about the history of the cathedral, went through several drafts. It was mainly a condensed version of the final section, on the bishops of Lichfield, of the Lichfield chronicle written by Alan Ashbourne between 1323 and 1334. Whitelocke made several additions to Ashbourne's account of the holders of the see, and added a further series of brief biographies of the bishops, concluding with the consecration of Bishop Bentham in 1560. To compile his history he used material in the cathedral library, including another chronicle written by John Aston, a contemporary of Ashbourne. The new material which he added on Lichfield traditions, such as the site of a Mercian burial-ground, reflects Whitelocke's antiquarian interests. His episcopal biographies also contain material from the registers of the archbishops of Canterbury, which he might have owed to his friendship with his fellow antiquarian John Twyne, to whom Whitelocke was said to have given information about the dispersal of John Bale's library.<br>
<br>Whitelocke took the extracts from Ashbourne's chronicle from the copy presented to the cathedral by Thomas Chesterfield in the mid-fifteenth century. Henry Wharton, who published several accounts of the history of the cathedral in his <span class="italic">Anglia sacra</span> (1691), not only wrongly ascribed extracts from the original Lichfield chronicle to Thomas Chesterfield, but also incorrectly ascribed to Whitelocke another compendium, the &#145;Historia ecclesiae Lichfeldensis&#146; written in 1575 by an anonymous author, who was possibly Lawrence Nowell, dean of Lichfield between 1560 and 1576. Four versions of Whitelocke's &#145;Chronicon&#146; survive, all of them dedicated to his fellow canons; in December 1583 he presented an abridgement of the first draft to another antiquarian friend, the lawyer Francis Thynne. Whitelocke died in Lichfield, unmarried, early in 1584.<br>
