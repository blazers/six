<span class="headword">Dowie,  John Alexander</span>  (1847&#150;1907), <span class="occ">faith healer and leader of a religious group</span>, was born in Leith Street Terrace, Edinburgh, on 25 May 1847, the son of John Dowie, a breeches maker, and his wife, Ann Macfarlan. At a school in Arthur Street, Edinburgh, he gained a silver medal at the age of fourteen (1861). His parents emigrated to Adelaide, South Australia, in 1860 and Dowie soon followed them. In 1868 Dowie, who had been working for a grocery wholesaler, returned to Scotland, and, with a view to entering the Congregational ministry, attended Edinburgh University for two sessions, 1869&#150;71. His first place of ministry was the Congregational church at Alma, near Adelaide, from where he soon moved to the charge of Manly church, Sydney, and later to a church at Newton, a suburb of Sydney. On 26 May 1876 he married his cousin Jane Dowie in Adelaide. At this period he was well known as a social reformer, a temperance advocate, and a pleader for free, compulsory, and undenominational education. In 1878 he declared himself against a paid ministry and resigned his charge. Two lectures, which he delivered in the Victoria Theatre, Sydney, in 1879, entitled &#145;The drama, the press, and the pulpit&#146;, attracted attention and were published. By 1880 he was regarded as eccentric, and was subjected to ridicule in the press. He began to be involved in injudicious financial loans and schemes. After a period at the Sackville Street Tabernacle, Collingwood, in 1882&#151;which led to a rupture with the congregation described in <span class="italic">Sin in the Camp</span> (1882)&#151;Dowie built a new tabernacle in Johnston Street, Fitzroy. Disputes about its ownership led to his imprisonment. At these tabernacles, Dowie developed a ministry of faith healing. He claimed that over a period of ten years he laid hands on 18,000 sick people and healed most of them. He made expeditions to New Zealand, San Francisco (1888), and Nebraska (1890), and in July 1890 made Chicago his headquarters, though extending his travels to Canada. In May 1893 he opened Zion's Tabernacle, at Chicago, as a centre for the Divine Healing Association.<br>
<br>Dowie's move for the independent organization of a new religious community in November 1895 led to trouble in the law courts. About 100 charges were brought against him, but none succeeded. On 22 January 1896 he established the Christian Catholic Church in Zion, with a hierarchy of overseers, evangelists, deacons, and deaconesses. On 22 February Dowie was made general overseer; his wife, Jane, was the only woman overseer. The wives of overseers were usually made elders; no unmarried man could be more than deacon. Zion City, on Lake Michigan, 42 miles north of Chicago, was chosen as the site for the community on 22 February 1899; on 1 January 1900, 6500 acres of land were secured, the title deeds being held by Dowie as proprietor and general overseer. If Dowie is to be believed, his following had by 29 April 1900 increased from 500 to 50,000; his critics say that he never had more than half that number. The site of Zion Temple was consecrated on 14 July 1900. Dowie now announced himself as &#145;Elijah the restorer&#146;, otherwise &#145;the prophet Elijah&#146; and &#145;the third Elijah&#146;.<br>
<br>The gates of Zion City were opened on 15 July 1901; by 2 August the first residence was ready. The religious organization of the community, completed on 7 April 1902, was supplemented on 21 September by the formation of a body of picked men, known as the &#145;Zion restoration host&#146;. The city was ostentatiously planned with winter and summer residences for its inhabitants. Dowie distinguished himself by a showy costume of oriental appearance. On 18 September 1904 he consecrated himself First Apostle, with authority to elect eleven others; the title of the body was enlarged to Christian Catholic Apostolic Church in Zion, and its purpose, frankly avowed by Dowie, was &#145;to smash every other church in existence&#146;. Its members were bound to minute particulars of personal and ceremonial observance, alcohol and tobacco being prohibited. The leading motive was evidently the establishment of a sheer autocracy, wielded by Dowie. The publications of this body, including their journal, <span class="italic">Leaves of Healing</span>, were translated into German and French, some of them into Danish, Norwegian, and Dutch, and some even into Chinese and Japanese. Dowie twice visited England, where a congregation of disciples had been formed in London. In 1903 he was not well received in London and Manchester; in 1904 some disrespectful allusions to Edward VII, uttered in Australia, caused an uproar at the Zionist tabernacle in Euston Road, London.<br>
<br>In April 1906, while Dowie was in Mexico for his health, there was a revolt in Zion led by his chief follower, Wilbur G. Voliva. Dowie was charged with having advocated polygamy in private, and was deposed by the officers of his church, who, with the agreement of his wife and son, put Deacon Granger in possession not only of the church property but even of Dowie's private belongings. Dowie began a suit in the United States district court for reinstatement, estimating the value of the property at &pound;2 million. The court decided that, as the property had been made by contributions to Dowie in his representative capacity, it passed to his successor in the office of general overseer. In the course of the suit it was stated that Dowie's account in Zion City Bank was overdrawn more than $480,000, that he had been drawing for his personal use at the rate of $84,000 a year, and had lost $1.2 million on Wall Street in the slump of 1903&#150;4. Dowie was now a broken man. He was afflicted with partial paralysis, and with strange illusions as to the importance of his intervention in international politics. He died on 9 March 1907 at Shiloh House, Zion City, Illinois.<br>
<br>Dowie was an attractive personality, a man of fine build, though obese and bow-legged, with brilliant, sparkling eyes and a flowing white beard; a turban covered his baldness, and his ostentatious dress was tasteful and picturesque. He did not shine as a speaker, being long-winded and dull. After his death a rival fanatic, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, &#145;the promised Messiah&#146;, published a pamphlet (n.d., but written in April 1907), in which the fate of Dowie was interpreted as a &#145;divine judgment&#146; on his opposition to Islam.<br>
