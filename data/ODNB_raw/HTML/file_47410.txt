<span class="headword">Best,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1570), <span class="occ">bishop of Carlisle</span>, was supposedly born in Yorkshire of unknown parentage. He was probably of Halifax, referred to in his widow's will, and home to another early protestant of the same surname. Nothing is known of his schooling. A man of his name was a monk of Selby who in 1535 displeased the archbishop of York by his preaching, &#145;railing and jesting&#146; at the hypocrisy of fasting. His preaching licence was revoked until he were &#145;waxed sadder&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 9, no. 742). Best was certainly at King Henry VIII College, Oxford, in 1538&#150;9, when his preaching was again criticized, this time by a chaplain of the college, and he was found eating meat in Lent at the house of an Oxford bookseller, accompanied by three others of his college, including one of his own students. Little is known of his movements for the next twenty years, but he appears to have pursued his studies during this period. Bachelor of grammar at Oxford in 1534, he had apparently become MA of an unknown university by 1559, and a BTh by 1561. Oxford made him a DTh <i>in absentia</i> in 1566.<br>
<br>About 1550 Best married Elizabeth Somner (the date may be inferred from the fact of two of the four children in his widow's will of 1574 being then still under age). Her antecedents are as obscure as his own, but the fact that her poverty led to her being allowed to retain the episcopal residence of Rose Castle between her husband's death and his successor's appointment suggests that neither he nor she came from families with any private means. In 1553 Best was briefly canon of Wells and prebendary of Wedmore, but was deprived by Mary in 1554 for marriage. Not found among the Marian exiles, he may be identified with the Master Best who was one of four preachers occasionally smuggled into Lancashire to minister to a Manchester protestant conventicle, suggesting a likely membership of the protestant underground in Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Best at last emerged from obscurity after the accession of Elizabeth. A select preacher in the north in 1559, he was rector of Romaldkirk, usually held <i>in commendam</i> with the see of Carlisle, on 4 August 1559, and was restored to his Wells prebend with the rectory of Street with Walton, Somerset. He was not consecrated as bishop of Carlisle until 2 March 1561, the long vacancy after the deprivation of Bishop Oglethorpe in June 1559 being usually ascribed to the difficulty of finding anyone willing to accept the see. Even Bernard Gilpin, the Apostle of the North, refused his cousin Edwin Sandys's encouragement.<br>
<br>Gilpin may have been wise. The problems Best faced at Carlisle were enough to make anyone wax sadder. His clergy were obstinately unreformed, the laity little better. Even in his initial cautious optimism he wrote to Cecil in July 1561 of the over-mightiness of Lord Dacre, describing the clergy under his influence as the &#145;wicked imps of Antichrist&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/18/21). Six months later he complained that the rulers and justices &#145;winked at all things&#146;, and, owing to the supremacy of Dacre and Clifford in his diocese, he could himself achieve nothing  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/21/13). Rumours and expectations of a French invasion further impeded reform. Moreover, the bishop lacked the support from his dean and chapter, which made the reforming task of Pilkington at Durham so much easier. Sir Thomas Smith, restored in 1560 to the deanery of which he had been deprived by Mary, was an absentee government servant who was ambassador to France for much of the 1560s, and there was no love lost between him and his bishop. Writing to Cecil in 1565, Smith spoke caustically of &#145;that busy bishop of Carlisle&#146;, who had made turmoil among the prebendaries, and wished Best had as much goodwill as tongue  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1564&#150;5</i>, no. 980 (7)). In fact Smith misjudged the situation. He was relying on his vice-dean to bring the house out of trouble, whereas Best's investigation showed that the near bankruptcy of the chapter was caused by illegal and simoniac leases in which the vice-dean was the ringleader. Best was aware by 1563 of the &#145;evil doings of the prebendaries&#146; in Smith's absence  (Lansdowne MS 6, fol. 125), and won the support of Edmund Grindal, bishop of London and a native of the diocese, in his attempts to control and reform his corrupt chapter, which he described as consisting of &#145;ignorant priests or old unlearned monks&#146;  (Lansdowne MS 6, fol. 86).<br>
<br>Grindal accordingly supported Best's efforts to replace the prebendaries who died with committed reformers, men willing to tackle the Augean stables of the chapter as well as to undertake wider preaching responsibilities in the diocese. Even so, the saga of the chapter leases occupied much of the decade of Best's episcopate. In August 1567 he asked for an extension of his commendam of Romaldkirk to finance the needs of the church in Carlisle.<br>
<br>Best's episcopal register reflects problems he faced in his efforts to reform his wider diocese. The first two pages deal with the deprivation of Hugh Hodgson, provost of Queen's, Oxford, of the rectory of Skelton; as Hodgson was then sheltered by Lord Dacre, and the living given to a Dacre scion who was a Marian ordinand, Best's intention was frustrated. If he was able to see a protestant of his choice preaching to the German miners at Crosthwaite, his register reveals all too clearly the general shortage of suitable ordinands, and the failure or refusal of too many to present candidates with truly protestant credentials.<br>
<br>Best had few illusions about the leanings of most of the gentry. The covering letter to his report of 1564 on the JPs complains about the dead hand laid by the Clifford family on its hereditary shrievalty of Westmorland, of papists passing unapprehended and preaching in remote chapels, of JPs making a pretence only of favouring reform, and of tenants at risk of losing their farms if they declared their protestantism. The death of the fourth Lord Dacre in 1566, leaving only an infant heir, was a turning point; within two years there was a protestant rector at the Dacre stronghold of Greystoke and protestant converts in the parish. In December 1569, moreover, Best himself successfully resisted a last threat from the Dacres. Left as JP in charge of Carlisle in the absence of the warden of the west march during the northern rising, he was advised of a plan being made by the younger Dacres to capture the castle and assassinate him. Best strongly reinforced the garrison and faced the Dacres down when they arrived with a retinue and demanded an audience; by his firm stand in a tense situation he ended the possibility that they would reverse the new order in church and state.<br>
<br>Best was also shrewd in his assessment of the shortcomings of the other leading families in his diocese. If in 1561 he had thought Lord Wharton &#145;very well loved&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/18/21), by 1564 he knew him to be &#145;evil of religion&#146;. Others were &#145;verie unfytt&#146; or &#145;to be admoneshedd&#146;. It was the lesser gentry and new men whom he found &#145;good and meat to contynue &hellip; in Relligion good and wyttye men&#146;  (Bateson, 50&#150;51). Here he was able to find some support for the reform of his diocese.<br>
<br>In this last decade of his life Best emerged from obscurity to show himself a dogged and determined protestant, tackling with some success the task of bringing a conservative and reluctant diocese into line with Elizabeth's religious settlement. He died at Carlisle on 22 May 1570, and was buried in Carlisle Cathedral. Though he may have undervalued his own achievement, the delight of his successor, Richard Barnes, at the state of Carlisle diocese provides Best with an appropriate epitaph.<blockquote>Praise be to the Lord, who even in this utmost corner &hellip; has mightily prospered his gospel &hellip; there is not one within this little diocese that openly repines against religion, refuses &hellip; to come to church, or that shuns sermons, or openly speaks against the established religion. (TNA: PRO, SP 15/20/84)</blockquote>And on another occasion Barnes wrote: &#145;I find these Cumberland and Westmorland commonality far more conformable pliable and tractable than ere I found the better sort in Yorkshire&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/74/22).<br>
