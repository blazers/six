<span class="headword">Wigram, Sir  Robert</span>, first baronet  (1744&#150;1830), <span class="occ">merchant and shipbuilder</span>, was born on 30 January 1744 in Wexford, Ireland, son of John Wigram (<i>d</i>. 1746) of Wexford, merchant and master of the privateer <i>Boyne</i>, and his wife and cousin Mary, daughter of Robert Clifford of Wexford. His father drowned at sea when he was two, and he was brought up in Wexford by his maternal uncle, a doctor, before going to London in 1762. After two years' apprenticeship to a Dr Allen of Dulwich he qualified as a surgeon in 1764, joined the East India Company as a surgeon's mate, and sailed to India. He worked as a ship's surgeon until 1772, when he had to stop practising: an eye infection he developed in China had permanently damaged his eyesight. In 1772 he married Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1786), daughter of John Broadhurst of Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, a Unitarian, and under her influence he became a Unitarian. They had four sons and two daughters. In 1787 he married Eleanor [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55217/', "Wigram, Eleanor, Lady Wigram (1767&#150;1841)")</script>], widow of Captain Agnew and daughter of John Watts of Southampton, secretary to the victualling office, and they went on to have thirteen sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Wigram opened a drug business in 1774 at 4 White Lion Court, Cornhill, London, and became one of the leading drug importers in the country, putting into practice his knowledge of the trade of India and China. He moved the business nearby to 3 Crosby Square, Bishopsgate, in 1782, and bought Walthamstow House in Essex.<br>
<br>As his fortune grew Wigram began to buy shares in East India Company ships. The first was the <i>General Goddard</i>, in 1788, and in 1790 he bought the <i>True Briton</i>, built by the Wellses of Rotherhithe. As well as owning several ships Wigram became one of the leading ship's husbands in the port of London. At the same time he was acquiring land, part of the Orchard House estate, belonging to the East India Company, on the Thames near Blackwall Yard. He was also a partner in Reid's Brewery, which supplied beer to the Indiamen, and in Huddart's Rope Works, at Limehouse. Wigram was a leader of the group of shipowners who pressed the government to establish the East India Dock Company in 1803 and build docks at Blackwall, on the Thames, for East India Company ships; he was also one of the original subscribers to the company. A member of the committee for constructing the docks, he chaired the East India Dock Company from 1810 and became a director in 1815, at the time when he was buying the freehold of several parts of the Orchard House estate.<br>
<br>Wigram was elected MP for Fowey in 1802 and held this seat until 1806, when he became MP for Wexford. He was a strong supporter of William Pitt and was rewarded with a baronetcy in 1805, for which he himself had applied, mentioning the expense to which he had gone as lieutenant-colonel of the 6th Loyal London volunteers and in fitting out ships for the navy. He left parliament in 1807.<br>
<br>In 1805 Wigram bought a large share in Blackwall Yard from John Perry and the Wells brothers. The first shipyard to be built on the left bank of the Thames, Blackwall Yard was originally created by the East India Company for the building and repair of its ships, but it was sold in 1650 and developed in the eighteenth century into one of the largest shipyards on the Thames. During the Napoleonic wars it was the place of embarkation for regiments going overseas, and ships were built there for the navy: in 1813 alone, ten frigates were built there. Part of the yard was sold to the East India Company in 1803 for the new docks, which opened in 1806. When Perry retired in 1810, the Wells brothers sold the property to Wigram, with John Wells retaining a quarter share, but with no active role, until he sold it to Wigram in 1813. Wigram ran the yard with the help of two of his sons, Money and Loftus. He retired from active control at Blackwall Yard in 1819 and sold the yard to Money and Loftus Wigram, and George Green, the son-in-law of John Perry, former owner of the yard. The firm became Wigrams and Green, and in 1821 it launched the first steam vessel to be built at Blackwall Yard. Sir Robert Wigram died at Walthamstow, Essex, on 6 November 1830.<br>
<br>Wigram was a man of great energy. According to the diarist Joseph Farington, occupation was essential to him, and he &#145;should be miserable if in a morning he should not awake with his head full of ideas of business for the day&#146;  (<span class="italic">Farington Diary</span>, ed. Greig, 6 Oct 1811). Several of his sons were successful, including his eldest son, Sir Robert Wigram (knighted in 1818), a director of the Bank of England and an MP for many years; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29377/', "George Vicesimus Wigram (1805&#150;1879)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29379/', "Wigram, Joseph Cotton")</script>], a writer and a member of the Plymouth Brethren; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29378/', "Sir James Wigram (1793&#150;1866)")</script>, barrister and author of legal works; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29379/', "Joseph Cotton Wigram (1798&#150;1867)")</script>, bishop of Rochester.<br>
