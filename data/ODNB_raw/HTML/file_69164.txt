<span class="headword">Manson,  (Thomas) Mortimer Yule</span>  (1904&#150;1996), <span class="occ">journalist and musician</span>, was born on 9 February 1904 at Lerwick, Shetland, the third son and fourth and youngest child of Thomas Manson (1859&#150;1941), a journalist, printer, and musician, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cruttwell (1865&#150;1954), a piano teacher and choral singer. Both parents were important influences on Manson, the Benjamin of the family, as he once referred to himself. Their house often swarmed with musical people and other local celebrities. Manson was educated at a small private school in Lerwick and then at the Anderson Educational Institute there. He shone in most subjects, and was devoted to art in particular. He eventually studied English and history at Edinburgh University, and prepared to become a teacher. But his return to Shetland in winter 1929&#150;30 coincided with his eldest brother's departure for South Africa, and Manson took his place in the family printing works in Mounthooly Street, Lerwick. He succeeded his father as editor of the <span class="italic">Shetland News</span> in 1941, and ran the paper until its demise twenty-three years later. He was conscientious as editor, as in everything else. However, there was an old-fashioned air about the <span class="italic">News</span>, and its political stance&#151;it had come into existence as Shetland's Conservative organ&#151;did not always commend it to Shetland's largely Liberal population. The Liberal <span class="italic">Shetland Times</span> gradually ousted it. Manson's subsequent career, as a jobbing printer, was not prosperous either. When he retired, in 1977, he relaxed for the first time for years. <br>
<br>During the 1980s Manson took up an entirely new career. For a few years after his retirement he had reported council meetings for Radio Shetland. In May 1982 he stood for election in the Clickimin ward of Lerwick, knocking personally on each door. He was duly elected. An independent councillor, in every sense, he took the work seriously, especially his position as chairman of the leisure and recreation committee. He liked to be busy: shortly after he left the council, in his eighties, he visited the employment exchange in search of a job. <br>
<br>Manson was also a scholar. In the 1930s he was the founder of <span class="italic">Manson's Guide to Shetland</span>, a pocket-sized book for discerning tourists. He read up on current archaeological and historical work, and expounded it in his earnest way. An exacting critic, Bruce Dickins, described the <span class="italic">Guide</span> as an &#145;excellent piece of work by a good scholar&#146;  (<span class="italic">Old-Lore Miscellany</span>, 10, 1935&#150;46, 290). Manson was also a staunch contributor of historical and political articles to the <span class="italic">New Shetlander</span> and <span class="italic">Shetland Life</span> magazines. His essay on Shetland's Spanish Armada shipwreck, written for a Festschrift for his friend Ronald Cant in 1974, was a characteristic piece of work. Ten years later another friend, Barbara Crawford, edited Manson's own Festschrift&#151;this time called a <i>hei&eth;ursrit</i>, the equivalent Faroese word&#151;entitled <span class="italic">Essays in Shetland History</span> (1984). <br>
<br>Dear to Manson's heart was the fostering of contact between Shetland and the Scandinavian countries. In 1933 he accompanied a group of Shetland footballers to T&oacute;rshavn in the Faroes, re-creating a link that had long been in abeyance. For the rest of his life he did his best to foster relationships between the two groups of islands. He played a key part in organizing the first Viking Congress, a meeting of Scandinavianists in Lerwick. A measure of his conscientiousness in everything he did is the fact that at one point he sent a telegram concerning an aspect of the congress at four o'clock in the morning. The congress, held in 1950, was a great success, the first of many. A year later Aberdeen University awarded Manson an honorary degree of doctor of laws for his achievement. <br>
<br>Manson's chief love, however, was music. When he was thirteen he joined the Boy Scouts flute band and became besotted with that instrument. Almost self-taught, he was in demand to play it in the local orchestra, since Lerwick lacked flautists at that time. Eventually he taught local scholars and trained and led the Boys' Brigade flute band. When young flautists began to take their place in the orchestra, in the 1970s, Manson took up the violin. He was conductor of the brass band from 1959 to 1964, treasurer of the Lerwick Orchestral Society from 1937, and secretary from 1947 to 1989. <br>
<br>Manson was active in numerous other ways. His campaigns to preserve the old flagstones on Lerwick's Commercial Street, and to restrain industrial depletion of sand at St Ninian's Isle, conducted stubbornly, became legendary. He was a devoted scouter. A tory for most of his life, he left the fold when the party began to look towards Europe, in 1962, and defiantly printed &#145;A Commonwealth newspaper&#146; on the masthead of the <span class="italic">Shetland News</span>. <br>
<br>Mortimer Manson was shy, and sometimes a little gruff. Courteous and dutiful, he felt distressed if he thought that he had let someone down. His halting voice and sweet personality made a vivid and lasting impression on people both in Shetland and further afield. He died, unmarried, on 23 January 1996.<br>
