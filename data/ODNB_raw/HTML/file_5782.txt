<span class="headword">Cockerell,  Frederick Pepys</span>  (1833&#150;1878), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in March 1833 at 87 Eaton Square, London, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5781/', "Charles Robert Cockerell (1788&#150;1863)")</script>, architect, and his wife, Anna Rennie (1803&#150;1872). He was educated at Winchester College from 1845 to 1848, and at King's College, London, where he remained for nearly two years from 1848 in the department of applied science. He was taught architecture and drawing by his father and by John E. Goodchild, his father's chief clerk and close friend. Powerfully influenced by his father's admiration for French architecture, he became, in an age of increasing nationalism, an essentially European figure in the cultural tradition of the eighteenth-century grand tour.<br>
<br>After a sketching tour in northern France in 1850, Cockerell travelled in France in 1851, spending two formative months in Paris in 1853 as a pupil of Caristie, who introduced him to Viollet-le-Duc, Visconti, and Douillard. In 1854 he became a pupil of Philip C. Hardwick RA, before leaving his office in 1855 for an extensive study tour of the chief cities of Italy. On returning in 1856, he began to work in his father's office on the Liverpool and London Insurance Office and on decorative details for St George's Hall, Liverpool. In 1856 he entered the competition for the government offices, in 1863 for the Albert memorial, and in 1866 for the National Gallery.<br>
<br>His father's belief that sculpture was the voice of architecture was reflected in Cockerell's own works, such as the memorial column at Castle Howard, surmounted by an inventive Ionic capital bearing a tripod of terracotta and wrought iron by Charles Kelsey, who also worked on St George's Hall, Liverpool. Of his London buildings, Cockerell's Freemasons' Hall (1861) had a heavy classical fa&ccedil;ade rich with symbolic sculpture by W. G. Nicholl, who carved the pedimental sculpture at St George's Hall, Liverpool. His gallery of the Society of Painters in Water Colours boasted much figure sculpture by Signor Fabbrucci, a Florentine sculptor settled in Chelsea.<br>
<br>After beginning his career as a country-house architect with houses such as Lythe Hill, Surrey (1868), in the still fashionable neo-Tudor style, Cockerell became in the 1870s a pioneer of the Queen Anne movement. This combined Gothic revival asymmetry in planning and composition with details from English and Dutch architecture of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Examples of his work in this style include Crawley Court, Hampshire (1877; dem.), for A. S. Kennard, a London banker, and Woodcote Hall, Shropshire (1876), for C. C. Cotes MP. These houses were well related to their sites, as was Blessingbourne, Fivemiletown, co. Tyrone (1870&#150;74), for Hugh de Fellenberg Montgomery, built of hard sandstone quarried on the hills of the estate, laid in random courses. With its Jacobean flavour, turrets, and symmetrical garden front, it was furnished with wallpaper by William Morris and tiles by William De Morgan. Cockerell's most remarkable country house was the concrete-built Down Hall, Essex (1871&#150;3), with Charles Drake, a pioneer in concrete construction, as his consultant. The decorative panels and friezes were ornamented with sgraffito by J. Wormleighton of South Kensington from cartoons by Cockerell. Inside, the 40-foot-square hall was inspired by a Pompeiian atrium.<br>
<br>In 1867 Cockerell married Mary Mulock, daughter of Thomas Homan Mulock of Bellair, King's county, with whom he had six children. He was elected an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 1860, a fellow in 1864, and honorary secretary in 1871, and was a member of the Foreign Architectural Book Society, an exclusive private club within the RIBA. He was a trustee of Sir John Soane's Museum and a member of the Athenaeum. On the day of his sudden death, at 66 rue Fran&ccedil;ois, Paris, on 4 November 1878, he was due to attend a dinner party at the home of Duc, architect of the Palais de Justice. His funeral procession in Paris was followed by the distinguished French architects Duc, Lefuel, Hardy, Pelechet, Daumet, and Vaudremer. He was buried at Auteuil cemetery, Paris. At the time of his death he was living at 18 Manchester Square, London. A genial, charming, and handsome man, knowledgeable in literature and the arts, his premature death was widely regretted.<br>
