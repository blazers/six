<span class="headword">Ackerley,  Joe Randolph</span>  (1896&#150;1967), <span class="occ">writer and literary editor</span>, was born on 4 November 1896 at 4 Warmington Road, Herne Hill, south London, the younger son and second of the three children of Alfred Roger Ackerley (1863&#150;1929), fruit importer, of London, and his mistress, Janetta Katherine Aylward (1864&#150;1946), an actress. His parents married in 1919. He was educated at Rossall School, Fleetwood, Lancashire, and at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he obtained a third class in English in 1921, having abandoned law after a short time. His education had been interrupted by the First World War, in which he served on the western front as an officer in the 8th battalion of the East Surrey regiment. Twice wounded, he was captured in May 1917 and subsequently exchanged into internment at M&uuml;rren in Switzerland. These experiences, and the death in action of his elder brother, Peter, resulted in a pronounced strain of melancholy in his character.<br>
<br>In 1922 Ackerley received an appreciative letter from E. M. Forster about his long meditative poem &#145;Ghosts&#146;. This led to an enduring friendship, the closest of Ackerley's life. It was at Forster's suggestion that Ackerley spent five months in India as companion-secretary to the eccentric maharaja of Chhatarpur.<br>
<br>The anthology <span class="italic">Poems by Four Authors</span> (1923) contained ten poems Ackerley had written while an undergraduate, and in 1925 the play based upon his experiences as an internee, <span class="italic">The Prisoners of War</span>, was produced in London. Its &#145;difficult&#146; themes (the war and homosexuality) made it a <i>succ&egrave;s d'estime</i>, but although he was hailed as a coming dramatist, he never completed another play.<br>
<br>In 1928 Ackerley became an assistant producer in the talks department of the BBC. Through Forster he had acquired a wide circle of literary acquaintances, many of whom he recruited to make broadcasts on the radio. In 1932 he edited <span class="italic">Escapers All</span>, derived from a series of talks given by men who had escaped from prisoner-of-war camps. That same year he also published <span class="italic">Hindoo Holiday</span>, based on his Indian diaries. In spite of many excisions on the grounds of libel and obscenity, the book's sly humour and brilliant character-drawing ensured excellent sales and consolidated his reputation.<br>
<br>In 1935 Ackerley became literary editor of <span class="italic">The Listener</span>, a post he held for twenty-four years. He wanted the magazine to be &#145;in the vanguard of contemporary thought, the forefront of the battle&#146; and commissioned reviews, articles, stories, and poems which reflected this. &#145;I think that people <i>ought</i> to be upset&#146;, he wrote; &#145;I think that life is so important and, in its workings, so upsetting that nobody should be spared&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 115). This was a policy which led to many disagreements with his timid employers, and he waged a vigorous guerrilla campaign against the prudery and philistinism of the BBC hierarchy. His integrity, charm, tact, and an insistence upon the highest standards led to his being widely considered the finest literary editor of his generation.<br>
<br>Ackerley flouted convention both in and out of the office. Strikingly good-looking and energetically homosexual, he conducted a long but conspicuously unsuccessful search among working-class men for &#145;the Ideal Friend&#146;. His father's life had also been sexually unorthodox, for he had kept a second mistress and fathered three daughters whose existence was discovered by Ackerley only after his father's death. Ackerley's crusade to tell the truth, however uncomfortable and inconvenient that might be, arose from his belief that his relationship with his father had been compromised by their inability to confide in each other.<br>
<br>In 1956 Ackerley published <span class="italic">My Dog Tulip</span>, a shockingly frank and funny portrait of his Alsatian bitch, Queenie. The story of how he acquired her from a petty criminal and gradually transferred his love from man to dog is told in his novel <span class="italic">We Think the World of You</span> (1960), which won the W. H. Smith award. Although unconsummated, this relationship was undoubtedly the most satisfactory of his life and resulted in his passionate advocacy of animal rights.<br>
<br>In retirement Ackerley revised what was to be his masterpiece, a &#145;family memoir&#146; begun in the 1930s which was eventually published as <span class="italic">My Father and Myself</span> (1968). He lived in considerable squalor and acrimony in a small flat at 17 Star and Garter Mansions, 6 Lower Richmond Road, Putney, London, with his &#145;three bitches&#146;: Queenie, his ageing Aunt Bunny, and his emotionally unstable sister, Nancy. After the death of Queenie in 1961 he became increasingly morose. Although disenchanted with the human world, he turned his misanthropic gloom to good account in witty and self-deprecatory letters. He died from a coronary thrombosis on 4 June 1967 at his home in Putney and was cremated at Putney Vale crematorium.<br>
