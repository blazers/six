<span class="headword">Comyn,  John</span>, seventh earl of Buchan  (<em>c.</em>1250&#150;1308), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6042/', "Alexander Comyn, earl of Buchan (d. 1289)")</script>, and Elizabeth, third daughter of Roger de Quincy, earl of Winchester (<i>d</i>. 1264). He probably succeeded to the title in 1289, aged about forty. Earl John's territorial interests are reflected by his service as sheriff of Banffshire in 1289 and of Wigtownshire in 1290. He played a prominent role during the interregnum, holding a number of royal castles before they were handed over to King Edward and the Competitors in 1291 and petitioning King Edward in 1292 not to renege on the promises made at Birgham. At some point thereafter, Earl John resigned all or part of his lands in Galloway to his cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1209/', "John, king of Scots")</script>, in return for lands in north-east Scotland.<br>
<br>As relations between England and Scotland deteriorated, Buchan played a major role in the patriotic government, leading the Scottish force which raided south of the border in the spring of 1296. King Edward duly confiscated his manor of Whitwick in Leicester. After the collapse of Scottish resistance at the battle of Dunbar, Earl John was present at King John's enforced abdication in July 1296, himself submitting at the same time. Although initially required to live in England south of the Trent, he was sent back to north-east Scotland in June 1297 in order to halt the activities of Andrew Murray (<i>d</i>. 1297), with the help of the bishop of Aberdeen and Gartnait, son of the earl of Mar. They made only a pretence of action, and Buchan soon came out actively on the patriotic side, perhaps taking part, albeit ineffectively, in the battle of Falkirk in 1298.<br>
<br>Having taken his place once more at the heart of Scottish government, Earl John attended a meeting at Peebles in August 1299, where disagreement broke out between members of the pro-Comyn and pro-Bruce factions, prompting <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6046/', "John Comyn the younger (d. 1306)")</script> to seize the earl of Carrick, and Buchan himself to attack William Lamberton, bishop of St Andrews. The Scots settled their differences, however, when news came that Buchan's younger brother, Sir Alexander Comyn, was ravaging the north of the country with Lachlan Mac Ruairidh, a freebooting north-western magnate.<br>
<br>In February 1300 Earl John, as justiciar of Scotland, heard cases pertaining to his office in Aberdeen, despite the fact that his brother, Sir Alexander, later claimed that he had also held the area, but for King Edward. A few months later Buchan had gone south, missing a parliament held at Rutherglen in May 1300 because he was &#145;away in Galloway to treat with the Gallovidians&#146;, many of whom tended to side with the English even against their overlord, King John, who was also lord of Galloway. The parliament was postponed until 17 December so that Earl John could attend  (Sayles, 245&#150;50). Later that same year, he led a Scottish force which was compelled to flee from the English army at the River Cree. In 1301, however, Buchan and Sir John Soulis, stationed at Loudoun in Ayrshire, were more successful in preventing King Edward's force, at Glasgow, from joining up with his son's army in west Ayrshire.<br>
<br>At some point thereafter, Buchan went to France; when he returned in 1304 he submitted to Edward, along with most of the rest of the Scottish magnates. Under the statesmanlike settlement of Scotland in 1305, Earl John was appointed to serve on the council of the new lieutenant of Scotland, John of Brittany. However, this settlement was disrupted in 1306 by Robert Bruce's rebellion. The murder of John Comyn the younger forced Buchan into the English camp against King Robert. In late 1307 Robert went up to the north-east with the express intention of destroying Comyn power in the area, and Buchan's forces were routed at Inverurie in 1308. The king then ravaged the area in the so-called &#145;herschip&#146; of Buchan. Although the earl was afterwards appointed Edward II's joint warden of the western marches (Annandale, Carrick, and Galloway), his days of active service in Scotland were over and he died in England between 11 August and 31 December 1308.<br>
<br>Although he was rarely successful in military activities, which perhaps explains why he was never a guardian, Buchan had administrative abilities which served the patriotic government well. But his marriage to Isabel Macduff [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54144/', "Buchan, Isabel (b. c.1270, d. after 1313)")</script>], daughter of Colban, earl of Fife, produced no children and ended unhappily when she deserted him in 1306 in order to place the crown on King Robert's head, as was her family's right. Isabel, captured in the Bruce camp after the battle of Methven, was then imprisoned by King Edward in a cage in Berwick Castle. She was released in 1313 into the custody of Henry de Beaumont, who had married Buchan's niece and coheir, Alicia. Alicia was the daughter of Sir Alexander Comyn; though her husband called himself earl of Buchan, there is no evidence that he ever gained entry to the Buchan lands in Scotland, which eventually became a Stewart earldom.<br>
