<span class="headword">Oman, Sir  Charles William Chadwick</span>  (1860&#150;1946), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 12 January 1860 at Mozaffarpur, India, the only child of Charles Philip Austin Oman (1825&#150;1876), indigo planter, and his wife, Anne (1832&#150;1907), daughter of William Chadwick, railway constructor. The family returned to England almost immediately, and by 1866 had settled in Cheltenham. Charles was sent to public school at Winchester, where he held a scholarship. As an only child, he was anyway solitary, and at 6 feet tall, he stood out awkwardly among his peers, both of which traits led to difficulties. He seems to have taken to academic studies as something of a refuge from bullying and sports, although even then he was conscious that his classical scholarship fell somewhat short of the purest linguistic and philosophical standards. He therefore specialized in ancient history, with modern history as its natural auxiliary, although in the course of his career that relationship would gradually be reversed. In both fields he excelled, winning first place in the scholarship election to New College, Oxford (1878), and then taking a first in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1882) and in modern history (1883). Yet he did not fit into the liberal and modernist senior common room at New College, and was not appointed to the fellowship there that he had hoped for. He felt the rejection keenly, but quickly bounced back by winning a still more prestigious fellowship at All Souls, Oxford, to which he devoted the remainder of his life. He divided his time between teaching, writing, and a variety of university activities such as the union, the Non Placet Society, the Kriegspiel Club, the Phantasmagorical Society (an early exercise in the classification of paranormal events), and frequent attendance at church services and sermons, preferably high Anglican. On 16 December 1905 he became Chichele professor of modern history, having been the deputy since 1900. Also in All Souls he was instrumental in setting up the Chichele chair of military history in 1909, and was active as the Codrington's librarian for some thirty years.<br>
<br>Oman worked as a member of only the second generation of professional British historians, and so there were still great swathes of general history that stood in need of elementary school and undergraduate textbooks, or &#145;manuals&#146; as he called them. His production of such works was as prolific as it was influential. His most successful included <span class="italic">A History of Greece from the Earliest Times to the Macedonian Conquest</span> (1890), <span class="italic">The Byzantine Empire</span> (1892), <span class="italic">Europe, 476&#150;918</span> (1893), <span class="italic">A History of England</span> (1895), <span class="italic">England and the Hundred Years' War</span> (1898), <span class="italic">England in the Nineteenth Century</span> (1899), and <span class="italic">Seven Roman Statesmen of the Later Republic</span> (1902). If he had written nothing beyond these, his reputation would already have been secure. However, it was in what he called his &#145;research&#146; books, which included <span class="italic">Warwick the Kingmaker</span> (1891), <span class="italic">The Great Revolt of 1381</span> (1906), and his military histories, that he felt most free to pursue his many and diverse personal interests.<br>
<br>Unlike a more meticulous or plodding type of scholar, Oman flitted freely from one arcane subject to another with a rapidity that would suggest shallowness, but which he was normally able to sustain by the liveliness and force of his scrutiny. He was apparently as much at home describing the politics of the Roman senate for his manuals as the design of medieval castles for the Great Western Railway, or of wallpapers and silverware for the Victoria and Albert Museum. Having collected Roman coins as a boy, he had a lifelong interest in numismatics, which he saw as an essential archaeological underpinning for all historical studies, and he would eventually serve as president of both the Royal Numismatic Society and the Royal Archaeological Institute. Still more formative was his early exposure to military history, first through his father's memories of life under siege during the Indian mutiny, then through attending military parades, visiting battlefields, and reading such works as Napier's <span class="italic">History of the War in the Peninsula</span>. He was already making his mark in military studies as early as his seminal Lothian prize-winning essay, &#145;The art of war in the middle ages&#146; (1884). This was expanded into a book in 1885, with further developments and revisions in 1898 and (in two volumes) 1924. It held the field with few serious competitors until the 1960s, and was later complemented by an article, &#145;The art of war in the fifteenth century&#146; (1936), and a particularly valuable book, <span class="italic">A History of the Art of War in the Sixteenth Century</span> (1937). However, Oman's greatest achievement was to supersede Sir William Napier with his own <span class="italic">History of the Peninsular War</span> (7 vols., 1902&#150;30), together with many associated essays&#151;notably those collected as <span class="italic">Wellington's Army</span> (1913) and <span class="italic">Studies in the Napoleonic Wars</span> (1929). His <span class="italic">History of the Peninsular War</span> is unlikely ever to be displaced as the fullest basic military narrative of that conflict, even though a few of the facts and many of the opinions may be revised in the light of more recent research. Its first volume is excessively compressed and prejudiced; but the remaining six volumes show Oman as a mature post-Victorian historian, diligent in his researches, robust in his nationalist convictions, and lucidly assured in his exposition. The work conveys a great sense of clarity and completeness, notably by its full account of the Spanish operations, which had been skimmed over by Napier, and by its innovative compilation of statistics for manpower and casualties. However, it is perhaps unsurprising that the scholarly apparatus lags sadly behind the most advanced practice of his day, since Oman's militant conservatism gave him a strong aversion to all new-fangled &#145;theories&#146; or &#145;philosophies&#146; of historiography. He was content to remain a middlebrow historian of &#145;kings and battles&#146;, but as such he was unsurpassed.<br>
<br>Outside All Souls Oman's long, lanky, white-haired figure, his &#145;rogue-elephant look&#146;  (Rowse, 49), and his ever discursive conversation quickly became well known, if not notorious, in many different locales. He helped to organize historical pageants and war games, and he loved to travel, especially to Scotland, Italy, and Paris. For long he was active in Oxford University politics, firmly opposing innovation, and from 1919 to 1935 he sat as a Conservative burgess for the University of Oxford in the House of Commons, where he was nicknamed &#145;Stone Age Man&#146;  (ibid., 52). During the First World War he worked for the press bureau and the Foreign Office, for which he was knighted (KBE) in 1920. This experience also led him to conduct a most exhaustive study, &#145;The German losses on the Somme, July&#150;December 1916&#146;, which was published in 1927  (G. S. Clarke [Lord Sydenham] and others, <span class="italic">The World Crisis, by Winston Churchill: a Criticism</span>). This showed that the British official historian had set the enemy's losses too high, while W. S. Churchill had set them too low. Oman was elected FBA in 1905, served as president of the Royal Historical Society, and advised on the library of the Imperial War Museum. He became an honorary fellow of New College in 1936, and received honorary degrees of DCL (Oxford, 1926) and LLD (Edinburgh, 1911; Cambridge, 1927).<br>
<br>In 1892 Oman married Mary Mabel (1866&#150;1950), the sixth and youngest child of General Robert Maclagan RE. They had three children: Dulce Roberta (1894&#150;1971), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71516/', "Carola Mary Anima Oman (1897&#150;1978)")</script>, later a noted biographer, and Charles Chichele (1901&#150;1982, later a noted antiquary), who all knew him first as C.O. and then, after he had secured his chair, as the Prof. From 1892 to 1897 they occupied a central Oxford house in Beaumont Street next to the Ashmolean Museum and then lived at 39 St Giles, before moving in 1908 into the grandeur of Frewin Hall, off the Cornmarket. Sir Charles Oman died at Frewin Hall on 23 June 1946.<br>
