<span class="headword">Pomeroy <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Legge]</span>,  Florence Wallace</span>, Viscountess Harberton  (1843/4&#150;1911), <span class="occ">dress reform campaigner</span>, was the daughter of William Wallace Legge (<i>d</i>. 1868) of Malone House, Antrim, a wealthy landowner, and his wife, Eleanor Wilkie, daughter of Thomas Forster Adderstone of Northumberland. She married James Spencer Pomeroy (1836&#150;1912) on 2 April 1861. He became sixth Viscount and Baron Harberton of Carbery in 1862, inheriting an estate in co. Kildare worth nearly &pound;4000 per year. She eventually inherited her family's fortune. The couple rented Lyston Court, Ross, Hereford, as well as houses in the Kensington area, and, in later years, around Malvern. They had four children: Aline Florence, Hilda Evelyn, Ernest Arthur George, and Ralph Legge.<br>
<br>Lady Harberton's dress reform campaign began after Aline's death in 1880. An article in <span class="italic">The Queen</span> described her divided skirts, shown to the National Health Society in 1882. She may have helped Mrs E. M. King to form the Rational Dress Society (Association) in 1881, and she became president in 1883. Its &#145;Requirements of a perfect dress&#146; prefaced its inaugural exhibition catalogue:<blockquote>1. Freedom of Movement. 2. Absence of pressure over any part of the body. 3. Not more weight than is necessary for warmth, and both weight and warmth evenly distributed. 4. Grace and beauty combined with comfort and convenience. 5. Not departing too conspicuously from the ordinary dress of the time.</blockquote>These were the basic tenets of many dress reformers, a small but vocal minority, until mainstream clothing became more suitable for modern life.In 1884 the Rational Dress Society, &#145;under the presidency of Viscountess Harberton&#146;, sent outdoor and evening dresses with divided skirts to the International Health Exhibition. Lady Harberton's booklet, <span class="italic">Reasons for Reform in Dress</span>, accompanied the display. Lady Harberton frequently contributed to the society's <span class="italic">Gazette</span>, published from April 1888 until at least July 1889. The third issue advertised &#145;The Harberton&#146; divided petticoats, and noted that &#145;in answer to numerous enquiries our readers will be glad to learn that Lady Harberton purposes holding a drawing-room meeting shortly&#146;. A rare photograph from this period shows the viscountess in flat shoes, voluminous knickerbockers, a long fashionable jacket, a soft blouse, and an impressive hat. In 1893, according to the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, members of Lady Harberton's &#145;Short Skirt League&#146; pledged to wear walking dresses at least 5 inches above the ground.<br>
<br>In 1898 Lady Harberton became honorary treasurer of the newly formed Rational Dress League. Its publication described her &#145;At home&#146;, at 108 Cromwell Road, attended by thirty to forty members in &#145;rationals&#146;, and a dinner in Reading when she forgot to toast the queen before giving the word to &#145;light up&#146;, much to the delight of the press.<br>
<br>Lady Harberton's greatest moment came in 1899. While out with the Cyclists' Touring Club, in customary dress, she was refused service in the coffee room of the Hautboy Hotel in Ockham, Surrey. The club sued the landlady, one Mrs Sprague, who was found not guilty, since Lady Harberton had declined the offer of a meal in the bar-parlour. The press revelled in Lady Harberton's testimony that she regularly walked up Regent Street in divided skirts, and the episode did much to raise awareness of dress reform. It became a standard case on the rights of travellers, and veteran cycle enthusiasts still meet in her memory at the Hautboy.<br>
<br>Eccentric, self-confident, dedicated, and rich, Lady Harberton spent years wearing odd clothes and setting up societies doomed to failure. Yet her cause was good and her views, so vigorously expounded at every opportunity, were shared by many forward-thinking people. Her basic belief, that female clothing devalued women, was expounded in the <span class="italic">Rational Dress Gazette</span> for June 1898. She concluded, &#145;No one is free who is unable at least to have the unrestricted use of her own limbs, and woman's present appearance is the perpetual expression of this fact, and of her abject acquiescence in a humiliating position&#146;.<br>
<br>In her last years Viscountess Harberton was a keen suffragist. She died at the age of sixty-seven, at 21 Onslow Square, London, on 30 April 1911, and was buried at Brookwood cemetery, Woking. At that time votes for women were some years away, but Paul Poiret was already designing clothes which heralded the transformation of women's dress and owed not a little to the long campaigns of the dress reformers.<br>
