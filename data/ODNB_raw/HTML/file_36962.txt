<span class="headword">Wilson,  John Cook</span>  (1849&#150;1915), <span class="occ">philosopher and classical scholar</span>, was born on 6 June 1849 at Mount Horton, Nottingham, the only son of the three children of the Revd James Wilson (1814&#150;1902), a Methodist minister, and his wife, Hannah (1818&#150;1902), daughter of John Cook, of Newcastle under Lyme. He was educated at Shireland Hall, near Birmingham, Derby grammar school, and Balliol College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 27 January 1868, having been drawn there by the reputation of T. H. Green as well as by an exhibition scholarship. He gained first-class honours in classics and mathematics, both in moderations and in the final examinations. He graduated in 1873 and was elected to a fellowship at Oriel College in 1874. He also won the chancellor's Latin essay prize in 1873, and the Conington prize in 1882. After graduating he continued his studies at G&ouml;ttingen, Germany. He became proficient in German but developed no great love of the literature or philosophy.<br>
<br>While in Germany, Wilson met Charlotte, daughter of A. D. Schneider, of Gifhorn, Hanover, whom he married in 1876. She died in January 1914 after a long illness, the strain of which also took its toll on the health of her husband. They had one son, who after graduating emigrated to South Africa. After holding a tutorship at Oriel, Wilson was elected Wykeham professor of logic in 1889, and a fellow of New College in 1901. He retained the chair until his death and, with the exception of his brief stay in Germany, he spent all his adult life in Oxford.<br>
<br>Wilson's talent as a philosopher was rare. He was at once a good mathematician and a good scholar. An intensive study in his earlier years of the great philosophers, and especially of Plato and Aristotle, gave him an unrivalled background for his own enquiries. He had a great feeling for facts. His mind was independent, cautious, and intensely critical. There was every reason to believe that he would publish the most outstanding work of his generation. Yet he published little during his lifetime beyond a number of well regarded papers on the text, interpretation, and doctrine of Plato and Aristotle. His most famous work, <span class="italic">Statement and Inference</span> (2 vols., 1926), was published posthumously, and is a compilation of lectures and papers in various stages of completion, exhibiting very little coherence or consistency. His failure to publish may be attributable to the multiplicity of his interests, which were a continual source of distraction. A chance statement to which he objected would set him researching, and once this process had begun, no one could say when it would stop, for, to him, all critical problems were equally fascinating. He had a passion for detail, and a hatred of error. He considered writing on philosophy, when young, mere presumption, and cleverness a snare.<br>
<br>Wilson was greatly influenced by the reaction in Germany against the idealism of Kant and Hegel, and took a special interest in the work of Hermann Lotze, whose lectures he had attended while in Germany. Wilson's intellectual development thereafter was characterized by a reaction against the philosophers to whom he had been initially attracted, the British idealists Green, Bernard Bosanquet, and F. H. Bradley, but he also moved away from the quasi-idealism of Lotze. This distancing instilled in him a peculiar reticence to commit himself in print to any philosophical conclusions until he was absolutely certain that his views would not subsequently alter. This proved to be an insurmountable obstacle to publication. It was not surprising, therefore, that he threw his energies mainly into teaching, as the best means of developing his own thought.<br>
<br>Although somewhat pugnacious in his style of argument, Wilson lacked none of the tender compassionate humane qualities, and his warmth of personality was capable of inspiring admiration and loyalty in students from all walks of life. Among them was Cecil Rhodes, who delayed his departure to South Africa in order to attend a farewell dinner at Oriel in honour of his teacher. His talents as a teacher and critical thinker were widely acknowledged, and some of his devoted followers&#151;H. A. Prichard, W. D. Ross, and H. W. B. Joseph&#151;became pre-eminent Oxford &#145;realists&#146;. Even pupils who rejected Wilson's philosophical &#145;realism&#146; were profoundly moved by his presence. R. G. Collingwood remarks in his <span class="italic">Autobiography</span> that he was &#145;an inspiring teacher, whose enthusiasm for philosophical thought I still remember with admiration and gratitude&#146;  (Collingwood, 19). His lectures, though not unrelieved by humour, were apt to seem abstract and rather dry. His real powers stood out in informal discussions. There he cast aside reserve, and his audience could watch his mind at work. His acuteness seemed a revelation, and there was infection in his conviction that the truth was a matter of high importance.<br>
<br>The starting point of Wilson's views lay in his unwavering conviction of the truth of mathematics. The possibility of knowledge cannot be defined, proved, or justified, but it can be exemplified. For him mathematics was objective knowledge which needed no defence or justification. In mathematics we <i>know</i>. Hence the scepticism inherent in the philosophy of those who followed the metageometricians was wholly alien to him. So also was the position represented in F. H. Bradley's <span class="italic">Appearance and Reality</span> (1893). Reflection on our experience, he held, doubtless gives rise to puzzles in plenty, but where contradictions are alleged to be involved in our fundamental notions of the world, the cause lies in some fallacy, usually simple and often merely verbal, in which we have been involved. Wilson's attitude to ordinary language and &#145;linguistic analysis&#146;  (<span class="italic">Statement and Inference</span>, 2.759) is similar to that of J. L. Austin. Although he did not give the same authority to ordinary language as Austin, Wilson nevertheless thought that it could give support to philosophical conclusions. Like G. E. Moore, his Cambridge &#145;realist&#146; counterpart, Wilson had a great deal of time for claims to knowledge based on common sense. He was at the same time contemptuous of Bertrand Russell's logic. He never tired of insisting on the impossibility of general criteria, whether of knowledge, of beauty, or of morality. The key to particular problems lay in consideration of their particular subject matter. Yet the knowability of single facts by themselves, and the existence of irresolvable differences, were compatible with the unity of reality; they only showed that reality had not that unity which some philosophers expected it to have. Further, as Wilson came more and more to maintain, much that is ultimate in our experience is in itself intelligible to us, and our difficulties about such realities only arise because we treat them as if they were, or try to express them in terms of, or to explain them by, something else. In particular he became convinced that this was true of knowledge itself, and that for that reason the teaching of the idealists, which for long he had accepted, was based on a fallacy. In opposition to the idealist view that logic is about thought, he argued that statements express different types of thought&#151;opinion, supposition, inference&#151;and that it was absurd to conflate them in the idea of judgement.<br>
<br>Wilson was an energetic man who combined a passion for cycling with an interest in war games and military matters by becoming the head of the university volunteer cyclist corps, from which he retired with the honorary rank of major in 1904. He was awarded the volunteer long service medal in 1905. During the last year of his life he was a regular writer in the correspondence columns of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, offering advice on military matters, including the establishment of an army cyclist corps to fight in Belgium. He was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws at St Andrews University, and was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1907. He died of cardiac failure and pernicious anaemia at his home, 12 Fyfield Road, Oxford, on 11 August 1915 and was buried three days later in Islip churchyard, near Oxford.<br>
