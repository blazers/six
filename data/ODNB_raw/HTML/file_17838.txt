<span class="headword">Maitland,  William, of Lethington</span>  (1525<span class="mult">x</span>30&#150;1573), <span class="occ">courtier and diplomat</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17831/', "Sir Richard Maitland of Lethington (1496&#150;1586)")</script>, courtier, judge, and writer, and Mary or Mariota Cranstoun (<i>d</i>. 1586), daughter of Sir Thomas Cranstoun of Corsbie. His younger brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17826/', "John Maitland")</script>, later chancellor and first Lord Maitland of Thirlestane (1543&#150;1595), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68145/', "Thomas Maitland (c.1548&#150;1572)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17831/', "Maitland, Sir Richard, of Lethington")</script>]; his sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68146/', "Mary Maitland (d. 1596)")</script> was also involved with the worlds of letters and the court. Much has been made of the notion of Maitland as representative of the rise of the &#145;middling sort&#146; in Scottish society, and the lairds and the legal profession in particular, and there is certainly much in this, but he was not low born. The Maitlands enjoyed a place in Gavin Douglas's <span class="italic">The Palice of Honour</span>, and numerous marriages into noble families. Maitland's father proudly described himself as a daughter's son of the house of Seton. It is true though that in the mid-sixteenth century the Maitland family were a rising force and were yet to achieve their greatest days.<h2>
<a name="Educationandtheologicalbackground"></a>Education and theological background</h2>Maitland was probably educated at Haddington grammar school before entering St Leonard's College at St Andrews University in 1540. He moved on to the University of Paris in 1542. Over fifty Scots entered the university along with Maitland on 16 December 1542, including Quintin Kennedy, the Catholic apologist, William Kirkcaldy of Grange's younger brother Thomas, Maitland's cousin George Seton, the future fifth Lord Seton, Robert Pitcairn, and William Roberton, the future Edinburgh schoolmaster who would cause the reformers so much trouble. Maitland was no doubt helped by the fact that his kinsman William Cranstoun, a staunch Catholic and future principal of St Salvator's College, was elected Scotus rector of Paris in 1542. Given the acknowledged strength of the &#145;auld Parisiane kyndnes&#146;  (A. Ross, &#145;Reformation and repression&#146;, <span class="italic">Essays on the Scottish Reformation, 1513&#150;1625</span>, ed. D. McRoberts, 1962, 409) between the students which later often transcended sectarian differences, the importance of Maitland's years in Paris from a personal as well as an academic point of view should not be underestimated. Maitland may very well have drunk from the protestant well of St Leonard's along with so many others but his protestantism was of a very different brew from that of John Knox. Maitland had absorbed an Erasmian view of human nature at St Andrews and Paris, and seems to have shared his father's tolerant approach to religion. He may not have been present in his father's house in 1546 when George Wishart preached but he certainly shared his father's civility towards those of different religious views. Knox apparently persuaded Maitland of the sinfulness of the mass at a meeting of the Edinburgh privy kirk in 1555, but that was not an accurate portent for the future of their relationship, which would witness some very acrimonious confrontations.<br>
<br>For a layman, Maitland was remarkably well equipped theologically. Not many were brave enough to threaten Knox with the discipline of his own kirk session for the latter's denunciation of Maitland as an atheist and the allegation that he had dismissed heaven and hell as &#145;thingis devised to fray bairnis&#146;  (Bannatyne, 281&#150;2). Maitland traded scriptural chapter and verse with Knox and was conversant with the teachings of Calvin, Luther, Bucer, Musculus, and Melanchthon. Philosophically, he rejected the &#145;untractable discipline of the stoickes&#146;, preferring instead to be &#145;a student in that schole where it is taught that wyse men myndes must be ledde by probable reasons which the disciples of Plato and Aristotle have embraced&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 52/19/5). The same preference for flexible reasoning was evident in Maitland's regard for the practicality of the Roman jurisconsults and their awareness that &#145;the causes, tymes, places, persons, occasions and other circymstances wolde vary the whole decision&#146;  (ibid.). As well as being well acquainted with the classics, Maitland was comfortable with the new learning, as his friendship with the Italian protestant and humanist Pietro Bizzarri shows. Regrettably no record of Maitland's library survives.<h2>
<a name="Earlyofficialcareer"></a>Early official career</h2>Maitland's movements during 1542&#150;50 are unknown. Before 10 November 1553 he married Janet (<i>d</i>. before 1560), daughter of William Menteith of Kerse; they had at least one daughter, Marion. The crucial development in his career was his appointment in 1554 as assistant secretary to David Panter. Maitland certainly had powerful friends at court for he was apparently sponsored by Gilbert Kennedy, third earl of Cassillis, and, more significantly as far as Maitland's future career was concerned, Lord James Stewart. This was the first example of the two men working together in close harmony and provides the origin of the partnership that was to be such a feature of the next decade in Scotland's history.<br>
<br>Maitland did not waste his opportunity to establish himself in credit with the queen dowager, Mary of Guise, regent for her daughter Queen Mary, whom he impressed as a partner at cards as well as in his secretarial role. He gained much valuable experience of the royal administration and international diplomacy. In 1557 he was involved with Mary of Guise's attempt to support the French war against Spain through an abortive siege of Wark Castle in Northumberland. Equally illustrative of his high profile in the regent's administration at this time was his proposed embassy to England and France in February 1558 to mediate a peace. While the anger of Mary I of England at the recent loss of Calais ensured that the mission got no further than London, Maitland no doubt made many useful contacts at this time which he was able to exploit to the full after the death of the English queen that November transformed the political landscape completely. He did not attend the marriage of Queen Mary and the dauphin, Fran&ccedil;ois, in April 1558, but was probably grateful to keep the most conspicuous absentee from the wedding, the mother of the bride, company, particularly in view of the fact that four of the commissioners failed to return alive.<br>
<br>It can have been no major surprise when Maitland was appointed Panter's successor as royal secretary on 4 December 1558, but he was conspicuous as the only Scottish member of an executive increasingly dominated by the French. By virtue of his access to the highest political circles of the Scottish, English, and French courts, Maitland was in the perfect position to act as a double agent at the expense of Mary of Guise and to the benefit of the newly formed congregation.<h2>
<a name="Thecongregation"></a>The congregation</h2>Maitland did not openly defect to the congregation until October 1559, almost two years after the first bond of the congregation, but he had begun to serve their interests as well as those of Mary of Guise long before. In March 1559 he was sent as envoy to London and Paris on behalf of Mary of Guise. He completed his ostensible mission successfully, and returned to Scotland in May with the ratifications of the concluded peace between Fran&ccedil;ois and Mary and Elizabeth and his reputation with the regent enhanced. However, his covert agenda was far more significant, as this mission laid the basis for eventual English intervention in Scotland. He played the role of double agent superbly, even winning praise from George Buchanan for managing to deceive the cardinal of Lorraine, &#145;then esteemed the first diplomatist in Europe&#146;  (<span class="italic">Vernacular Writings</span>, 44). Philip II of Spain was similarly duped, receiving news that Maitland ruled Mary of Guise &#145;body and soul&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1558&#150;67</i>, 38). In England, Maitland built on the relationship developed at the border conference of January 1559 between James Hamilton, duke of Ch&acirc;telherault, and Sir Henry Percy, and established a working relationship with the two most influential people in England, Sir William Cecil and the new queen, Elizabeth. His relationship with Cecil developed in such a way that he described it in filial terms, and the diplomatic community came to regard him &#145;as a sort of Scotch Cecil&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1558&#150;67</i>, 492). Maitland's presence at the signing of the treaty of Cateau Cambr&eacute;sis between France and the Habsburgs in April 1559 enhanced his European perspective of the Scottish crisis, aware that their struggle mirrored that between the French crown and its Huguenot inclined provinces. He could also pose as being in possession of the darkest French secrets and intent towards England.<br>
<br>Maitland defected to the congregation when their fortunes were at an all time low, but he was immediately used to good effect. From December 1559 to February 1560 he led an embassy to London which led directly to the treaty of Berwick. Knox was for once guilty of understatement when he referred to Maitland as his replacement as manager of the civil affairs of the congregation as &#145;a man of better judgement and greater experience&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1558&#150;9</i>, 69). The congregation were certainly in need of an improved public profile in England, having already been judged &#145;cold, slow and negligent&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 1.226&#150;8) while the unfortunate timing of Knox's <span class="italic">First Blast of the Trumpet</span> rendered his name &#145;of all others most odious here&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1558&#150;9</i>, 73). During this embassy Maitland provided Cecil with the cogent arguments needed to convince an uncertain English privy council and a parsimonious Elizabeth of the necessity of intervention in Scotland. He countered the perception of the congregation as rebels, and appealed to English self-interest by reminding them of the danger they faced from France. He played on the desirability of a godly and political union between the two realms and also dangled the interesting carrot of the congregation's help in Ireland through the good offices of Archibald Campbell, fourth earl of Argyll, an offer that was actually written into the eventual treaty in February 1560.<br>
<br>The treaty of Berwick, despite securing English military intervention, did not guarantee victory for the congregation and indeed the months between it and the treaty of Edinburgh in July 1560 were among the most precarious in Maitland's career. England's military intervention was disastrously incompetent, as the farcical siege of Leith demonstrated all too embarrassingly, and the congregation achieved victory largely through a series of fortuitous events beyond their or England's control. Most significant of these was the death of Mary of Guise and the all-consuming French domestic strife triggered by the tumult of Amboise. Even the successful treaty of Edinburgh which secured the withdrawal of French and English troops from Scotland would not have been signed if Elizabeth's letter to Cecil ordering him to break off negotiations had arrived sooner. Nevertheless the victory of the congregation was a triumph for Maitland and his ally Lord James Stewart, and won him great credit in England, &#145;for sustaining the whole burden of foresight&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 1.364). Not only had he been instrumental in securing English aid but he had also, in the panic-stricken four months between Berwick and Edinburgh, kept a broadly based coalition together, attracting to it the Catholic leader of the north-east, George Gordon, fourth earl of Huntly, and the staunchly protestant but recently politically neutral James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton.<br>
<br>Maitland was chosen as harangue maker, or speaker, at the Reformation parliament of August 1560, a role he was to perform in parliament on three other occasions. He was probably responsible for the disappointment of Knox by preventing what would later emerge as the first <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span> being discussed by the parliament, apparently later dismissing it as a &#145;devout imagination&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Knox</span>, 2.26&#150;7). The Scottish confession of faith was adopted but it was not, as Knox lamented, a &#145;perfect reformation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Knox</span>, 1.338), an accurate portent for the difficult infancy endured by the new kirk. As well as abolishing papal authority and the mass, the parliament supported the proposal of cementing the English alliance by the marriage of Ch&acirc;telherault's son James Hamilton, third earl of Arran, to Elizabeth. This had the twin benefits of securing the alignment with England and preserving the fragile coalition of the congregation. It was Maitland's misfortune to have to handle the proposal which, while he was in sympathy with it, he knew was unlikely to succeed. Predictably, the reception from Elizabeth was negative, but the international situation was once again transformed by the death of Fran&ccedil;ois II of France in December, which Maitland and the other envoys heard about while in England.<h2>
<a name="SecretarytoMary"></a>Secretary to Mary</h2>From January 1561 Maitland and Stewart were preparing the ground for Mary's return to Scotland. They rejected out of hand the solution to the crisis favoured by Elizabeth, the Hamiltons, and Knox of Mary's marriage to the recently rejected Arran, and put forward their own strategy. Maitland admitted that the prospect of Mary's return created a very difficult personal dilemma for him: &#145;always in France I am taken for a better Englishman than most&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 1.506&#150;7), which, given his recent record, was understandable. After Stewart's successful embassy to France, Mary admonished Maitland sharply and re-employed him on her own terms. It was a measure of Mary's political acumen that Maitland and Stewart (earl of Moray from 1562) were at the helm of her new regime when Mary began her personal rule in August 1561. Maitland and Stewart had promised Mary that they would win for her recognition of her claim to succeed Elizabeth on the English throne, in return for the maintenance of the religious <i>status quo</i> in Scotland. It was a policy which fitted in perfectly with Maitland's ambition for a union of the Scottish and English crowns.<br>
<br>Maitland played a key role in the successful early years of Mary's personal reign. Certainly from 1561 to 1565 he was at the centre not only of her government but of her court too. Apart from his necessary absence on high profile embassies to England and France, he was always present in the privy council and was a constant companion on her progresses throughout the realm. He was indefatigable in restraining the demands of the kirk, and an earnest advocate of Mary's right to hear mass and of the controversial thirds of benefices financial settlement. Astutely, he ensured that substance was not given to protestant discontent by ensuring that Mary rejected the invitation to send Scottish representatives to the Council of Trent in 1562. He played a military as well as his more customary political role in the defeat of the earl of Huntly at Corrichie that year, and was very much to the fore in the glittering atmosphere of the court, whether employing his intellectual gifts, displaying his skill at hawking, hunting, and running at the ring, or participating in court masques. &#145;Maitland serves me right well&#146;, Mary reported to the duke of Guise in January 1562, and he and his family's fortunes rose accordingly  (<span class="italic">Letter from Mary</span>, 28). In 1561 Maitland was appointed an extraordinary lord of session, and in 1562 his father was appointed keeper of the privy Seal.<br>
<br>Most significant were Maitland's diplomatic endeavours on behalf of Mary's claim to the English succession. Within two weeks of Mary's arrival in Scotland he was dispatched to England in pursuit of this objective in exchange for the ratification of a modified treaty of Edinburgh. It was this embassy that saw the first mooting of the proposed interview between the two queens which was to provide the basis for Maitland's next embassy to England in May 1562&#151;his sixth embassy to the Elizabethan court in just three years. An indication of the level of the mutual confidence felt by the queen and the secretary at this point was seen in Maitland's four-month embassy to France and London in 1563. In England he once again demanded parliamentary recognition of Mary's claims to the English throne, but more significant at this time were his intensive negotiations in the highest international political circles for Mary's marriage. The prospect of Don Carlos of Spain, the Archduke Charles of Austria, Charles IX of France, Lord Robert Dudley, and intriguingly her kinsman Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, were all raised.<br>
<br>This mission arguably represents the peak of Maitland's credit with Mary. She rewarded him with the abbey of Haddington, making him, according to Thomas Randolph, worth &#145;3000 marks sterling in Lothian only&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 2.28). Maitland applied pressure on the English by displaying his easy access to the French court and his excellent relationship with the Spanish ambassador, La Quadra. Worryingly for the English, he was also seen as a man who could deliver, securing the release from French prison of Sir Henry Killigrew which English diplomatic efforts had failed to achieve. Despite the collapse of meaningful attempts to obtain a Catholic prince as Mary's husband, by mid-1563 Maitland was able to convince the English that it was still an option, encouraging Elizabeth to propose first Lord Robert Dudley as an English spouse for Mary, and then request that Mary rescind the exile of Matthew Stewart, fourth earl of Lennox, whose son Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, was another strong candidate for Mary's hand, possessing the next best claim to the English throne. The option kept the goal of a union of the crowns alive. Despite Maitland's performance as speaker in the parliament of 1564 and his boastful introduction of the Lennox restitution: &#145;Justlie it may be affirmed, Scotland in na manis age that presentlie levis wes in greater tranquilitie&#146;  (Cameron, 1.41&#150;4), Mary's subsequent marriage to Darnley and the rupture it caused in the amity was a disaster for Maitland and the policy he had advocated since Mary's return. Unlike Moray, Maitland had remained cool-headed after the collapse of the Dudley marriage project in March 1565. He happily accepted his mission to Elizabeth that same month to seek her consent for Mary's marriage to Darnley and to continue the prosecution of her claim to the succession. His belief that Mary was still only applying pressure on Elizabeth is shown by his reaction, on 8 May, when, <i>en route</i> for Scotland, he received a new commission. Maitland was instructed to return to London and announce Mary's decision to marry Darnley, regardless of Elizabeth's objections, and then to pass into France and announce the news there. Maitland was completely dumbfounded by Mary's new tactics and could not conceal his anger. He ignored his instructions and returned to court.<h2>
<a name="Marysmarriageandfall"></a>Mary's marriage and fall</h2>Despite his defiance of Mary's commands, wisely, Maitland distanced himself from the chaseabout rebellion of Moray and Ch&acirc;telherault in August and September 1565, but certainly sympathized with their anger. According to Randolph, Maitland and other ostensible supporters of the queen &#145;did only espy thayr moment and mayke fair wether untyll it come to the pinch&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 2.162). Mary's brilliant handling of the rebellion ensured that Maitland sided with his queen, but his credit with her would never be the same again. An accurate measure of this was his temporary realignment with Knox and the desperate general assembly of winter 1565 which sent mournful letters to their European brethren lamenting the parlous state of the realm. It was this alienation and despair that led to Maitland's involvement in the murder of David Riccio in March 1566. Maitland's advice to Cecil, just weeks before the murder, of the need to &#145;chop at the veray root&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 2.255) has unsurprisingly been interpreted as suggesting that he was prominent in the conspiracy. Maitland had lost much personal prestige by Riccio's rise to favour. His involvement in the murder signalled his willingness to rebel against Mary and her increasingly pro-Roman Catholic policy, of which Maitland and his fellow conspirators had lost control.<br>
<br>Maitland was not officially dismissed from his position as secretary for his part in the Riccio murder, but he was heavily forfeited, losing Haddington Abbey back to James Hepburn, fourth earl of Bothwell. In the most obscure period of his career he was absent from court for the next six months. He was given permission to travel into Flanders but not France or England, but he remained in Scotland. He was warded in Caithness, received the hospitality of John Stewart, fourth earl of Atholl, in Dunkeld and Callendar, and resided in Colin Campbell of Glenorchy's stronghold of the Balloch before his eventual rehabilitation.<br>
<br>The conciliatory policies Mary followed after the Riccio murder facilitated the return of the chaseabout rebels and these were continued after the safe delivery of her son in June 1566. Moray, Argyll, and Atholl lobbied against Bothwell and Darnley for Maitland's return to court and in September 1566 Mary gave way. Her personal reconciliation of Bothwell and Maitland was sealed by Maitland's restoration to the abbey of Haddington. The clear policy of reconciliation was also apparent in what was feared to be Mary's death-bed speech at Jedburgh in October 1566 which Maitland reported. Maitland was also a main figure at the so-called Craigmillar conference, where the Darnley problem was discussed and Darnley's murder allegedly plotted, and which certainly paved the way for the royal baptism. He was present at the spectacular baptismal celebrations of Mary's son Charles James in December 1566 at the Chapel Royal, Stirling. His own return to the inner sanctum of Mary's court was confirmed by his marriage at the same venue just days later, on 6 January 1567, to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70082/', "Mary Fleming (1542&#150;c.1600)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69949/', "Queen's Maries")</script>], daughter of Malcolm Fleming, third Lord Fleming (<i>c</i>.1494&#150;1547), and Janet Stewart (<i>c</i>.1510&#150;1560&times;63), illegitimate daughter of James IV; her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9701/', "John Fleming, fifth Lord Fleming")</script>, was one of Mary's most loyal courtiers. Mary Fleming, raised a Catholic in France, was memorably described by Kirkcaldy of Grange to be as fit a wife for Maitland as Kirkcaldy himself was to be pope. None the less, the marriage was based on affection, and they had a son, James, and daughter, Margaret, who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15456/', "Robert Ker, later first earl of Roxburghe")</script>, in 1587.<br>
<br>It is hugely unlikely that Maitland was unaware of the plot to murder Darnley. He penned within hours of the deed, on 10 February 1567, the official explanation of the murder sent to Catherine de' Medici, signed by the privy council, including Bothwell, Huntly, Argyll, and Archbishop Hamilton. Even by his own chameleon-like standards, 1567 proved the most tortuous year of Maitland's life. The sheer complexity of his allegiance is revealed by the fact that he fulfils Gordon Donaldson's criteria (as set forth in <span class="italic">All the Queen's Men</span>) for committed membership of both the king's and queen's parties in the civil war. He was present at the court of session on 12 May where Mary declared that in marrying Bothwell she was a free agent, was a witness to the marriage contract of 14 May, and was one of the privy councillors present from 17 to 22 May. His king's party credentials are equally impressive; he witnessed the coronation of James VI in Stirling and supported Moray on 22 August when Moray accepted the regency. Only Maitland appears on all these lists.<h2>
<a name="EstablishingtheMorayregency"></a>Establishing the Moray regency</h2>Maitland's hand was seen very much at work in the creation of the Moray regency. In August 1567, when Mary was imprisoned but before Moray had accepted the regency, Vincenzo Laureo, papal nuncio to Scotland in 1566, argued that what had helped Moray most was &#145;the crafty counsel of the Secretary Lethington, a man believed to be so astute and unprincipled that in all the late treasons he is thought to have thrown the stone without seeming to move his hand&#146;  (Pollen, 402). Such an interpretation is certainly tenable. After he had assumed leadership of the queen's party in 1570, Maitland issued an apology for his role in Mary's downfall. He even boasted that the king's party could not have done it without him: &#145;ye and farther without me they had nather the knowledge, wisdome, nor moyen to performe the same&#146;  (Calderwood, 3.85&#150;6).<br>
<br>Maitland's customary performance on Moray's behalf as speaker of the parliament in December 1567 was not an accurate portent for the future of the Moray&#150;Maitland relationship, which was soon to collapse, nor of his relations with the kirk. In an ironic tribute to the tolerance of Mary's regime Maitland offered the parliament a timely history lesson, once again stressing the wider European dimension in which Scotland's affairs were cast. Maitland argued that the bloodless triumph of protestantism within the space of eight or nine years was:<blockquote>a peculiar benefit only to the realm of Scotland that the true religion has obtained a free course universally through the whole realm and yet not a Scotchman's blood shed. With what nation had God dealt so mercifully? &hellip; Germany, France, Flanders, Denmark, you will find the lives of thousands spent before they could purchase the least part of that liberty whereunto we have attained, as it were sleeping upon down coddes. (TNA: PRO, SP 52/14/51)</blockquote>This was doubly ironic because it paved the way for the radical, Calvinist flavoured legislation Maitland had done much to resist in 1560 and heralded the high point of the kirk's relationship with the state.<br>
<br>Maitland's continued affection for Mary had been suspected during her captivity in Lochleven. A source not well disposed to Maitland strengthens this view. It was alleged that Mary received from Maitland at this time a gold token enamelled with Aesop's fable of the lion enclosed in a net being freed by a mouse, with the Italian legend engraved upon it: &#145;A chi basta l'animo non mancan le forze&#146; (&#145;he who has spirit enough will not want force&#146;; Nau, 58&#150;9). Mary's escape from Lochleven in May 1568 caught Maitland unawares and the mistaken strategy of the Hamiltons prevented a proper realignment of the queen's party. Mary apparently tried to contact Maitland but failed, and Maitland was found in Moray's camp before Langside. However, even Maitland at this point was struggling to hide his true colours and immediately after the battle of Langside (13 May 1568) was openly referred to by Moray as the &#145;necessary evil&#146;  (ibid., 100). It was on these grounds that he was included by Moray in the party that travelled to York, Westminster, and finally Hampton Court for the Anglo-Scottish conference that became the shambles of a trial of Mary. Moray believed that Maitland would cause less trouble under the watchful eye of the English than he would unattended in Scotland. The trouble he was to cause in England showed the suspicions of the regent to be well founded. The months in England exposed the divergent policies of Maitland and Moray and this was most clearly revealed by the proposal that Mary marry Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk. If Maitland was not the project's actual architect, then he was a principal supporter. It fulfilled all his conditions for Mary's restitution and the ultimate union of the realms, Maitland's long-term goal.<br>
<br>The inconclusive trial, and Moray's return to Scotland, buoyed by a &pound;5000 English subsidy, brought the rift between Maitland and Moray completely out in the open. Maitland's continued support of the Norfolk marriage project was shown in July 1569 at a convention in Perth. He defied the regent and voted in favour of the motion allowing Mary to divorce Bothwell. This was lost by forty votes to nine, conclusive proof of the changed agenda from Carberry when the professed intention of the confederates was the separation of Mary from Bothwell. Maitland facetiously congratulated the assembly on their concern for Mary's domestic happiness.<h2>
<a name="Maitlandthequeensman"></a>Maitland the queen's man</h2>Maitland could now be numbered among the ranks of the queen's men and was arrested by Moray on 2 September on the charge of Darnley's murder. Maitland's future looked bleak given the intense enmity he faced from Moray and his allies at this time, but he foiled his enemies in spectacular style, escaping from custody through the good offices of Kirkcaldy of Grange to the sanctuary of Edinburgh Castle. Maitland wrote to his &#145;friends, actual and potential&#146;  (Lee, 269) urging them to attend his trial. Such was the extent of the support he was able to mobilize in Edinburgh that Moray was angrily forced to prorogue Maitland's day of law on 21 November 1569. Moray had been publicly undermined by a popular show of support for Maitland and his pro-Marian policies and matters were to decline further for the beleaguered regent. Moray's arrest of Thomas Percy, seventh earl of Northumberland, following the failed northern rebellion in England fuelled popular discontent which Maitland could exploit. Moray's assassination on 23 January 1570 represented the nadir for the fortunes of the king's party in the civil war against the growing momentum of the queen's party with Maitland increasingly at the helm: &#145;The son's party daily decays, the mother's daily increases&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 3.126).<br>
<br>Maitland took the day of Moray's funeral to complete in perfectly stage-managed style his political rehabilitation, insisting on a fully public trial on the charge of the Darnley murder. Public trial and acquittal was followed by a successful return to the privy council. It was from this point that the king's party depicted Maitland as their chief enemy and directed most of their propaganda against him. He was despised as &#145;the saule and without whom they can do no more than the wheliis can do without the extrie&#146;  (Bannatyne, 15). While the propaganda efforts of both sides differed little in the conservative emphasis on the commonweal and the defence of the realm which had been such a feature of Reformation crisis propaganda, it contrasted sharply in its intensity, volume, and bitterness. One piece of civil war propaganda that is of especial significance to Maitland is Buchanan's <span class="italic">Chameleon</span>. This has had a great impact on Maitland's historical reputation, with its central accusation that Maitland was capable of any type of conduct apart from bravery and loyalty. These virtues are symbolized by red and white, the only colours the chameleon is incapable of disguising itself in. The other is the less well known, anonymously written &#145;Dialog of the twa wyfies&#146; (TNA: PRO, SP 52/17/77) which was received by Sir William Cecil in April 1570. This depicted Maitland as an atheist who dismissed religion as &#145;bot ane bogill to bairnis&#146;  (ibid.) and also gives the earliest known and most detailed contemporary exposition of the popular Scottish interpretation of the political principles of Machiavelli. Maitland was depicted as the Machiavellian &#145;scole master&#146; imbuing the &#145;glaikit cumpane&#146; of the queen's party &#145;as they herd every day and convene as bairns to the scole up in ye secreataris house&#146; with the principles of Machiavelli  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Maitland's pre-eminent position at the helm of the queen's party is usually attributed to his political and diplomatic abilities. He was certainly able, as his rivals feared, &#145;to lay a plaster over the wound of variance&#146; that lay at the heart of the queen's party  (Bannatyne, 38). Those same contemporary rivals were also more aware than subsequent historians have been of Maitland's vast personal influence over so many influential figures over the civil war. Maitland had built up an extensive network of support based upon a combination of kindred and personal ties during his career and from which many of the leading figures of the queen's party were drawn. His marriage to Mary Fleming had added Atholl and Fleming to his list of influential brothers-in-law, and opened up an important Hamilton connection to add to the useful connections his own Maitland family could claim. He was described as &#145;Athol's head of wit&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 52/17/77) and was decisive in winning Atholl over to the queen's side and in helping to mend the complex Atholl&#150;Argyll feud through his friendship with Colin Campbell of Glenorchy. This helped to create a united Campbell&#150;Stewart front. Maitland's brothers John and Thomas were active in support of the queen, while George, fifth Lord Seton, was his cousin. His friendship with Kirkcaldy of Grange dated back to the congregation and, with his two brothers, to Paris in 1542. To this can be added the loyal Melvilles. Alexander, fifth Lord Home, was described by Maitland as &#145;one of the dearest friends I have&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 52/18/59), while George Hackett, conservator of the staple at Veere, a fellow student of Maitland's at St Andrews in 1540, provided a vital focus for efforts to obtain Spanish help.<br>
<br>However bullish Maitland was about the prospects of success for the queen's party, he was always aware that success was ultimately dependent on outside aid, be it from Elizabeth or France or Spain. Despite strenuous efforts, he was unable to convince Elizabeth of the righteousness of Mary's plight and endured the enmity of England during the successive regencies of the earls of Lennox, Mar, and Morton. Nor was he able to secure the substantial foreign aid necessary to offset Elizabeth's preference and ultimately crucial military and financial support for the king's party.<br>
<br>While the civil war was never a sectarian conflict, as the allegiance of the participants shows, the queen's party's continuous but unsuccessful attempts to gain overseas aid&#151;necessarily from Catholic powers&#151;were to reap a most destructive harvest. Following the Ridolfi plot in 1571, English parliamentarians called for Mary's head in 1572. Her restoration was from that point more unlikely than ever. Similarly, the fall-out from the St Bartholomew's day massacre in Paris in August 1572 did the cause of the queen's party no good at all. Yet the reason the queen's party and Maitland's fate was not resolved sooner was Elizabeth's irresolution. The magnificent show of strength the queen's party boasted in April 1570 was swept aside by England's decisive and devastating military intervention in the same month under Thomas Radcliffe, third earl of Sussex. After scattering the Marian triumvirate of Huntly, Argyll, and Ch&acirc;telherault, despite their territorial strength across northern, central, and western Scotland and the support of &#145;xxxii erles and lordes in parlement&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 3.216), and the expulsion of the queen's party from Edinburgh in May 1570, Sussex could not believe Elizabeth's refusal to let him finish the job. There is no doubt Elizabeth's hesitancy kept the queen's party alive at this time.<br>
<br>In August 1571 Maitland described Sussex's military intervention as the turning point in the retrogressive fortunes of the queen's party, lamenting &#145;in what terms we then stood, since which time for no labours could be made that number could never be assembled again&#146;  (Duncan, 56&#150;67). During his year-long absence from the capital Maitland lobbied hard on Mary's behalf to no avail. Despite, on his return to the capital in May 1571, being able to inflict the indignity of the creeping parliament on to the king's party, it was an empty triumph as Maitland knew. He and his brothers felt the pain of the heavy forfeitures of the rival parliament more keenly despite the latter's ceremonial indignity. Hope, however, remained while Elizabeth prevaricated. The last chance the queen's party had to seize the domestic initiative was the botched raid on Stirling in September 1571. Instead of resulting in the capture of the leading lights of the king's party, this led only to the death of Lennox, which, as Maitland laconically admitted, aided the king's party as much as the queen's. Worse was to follow with the subsequent English reaction to the discovery of the Ridolfi plot. Maitland tried to bolster Mary's spirits by reminding her of the advantage their hold of Edinburgh Castle was, being &#145;aye able to cast the balance&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 4.376) but Maitland, in declining health, was clutching at straws. The ruthlessness of Morton, following the undynamic Mar regency, coupled with the arrival of English military force, sealed the fate of Maitland and his supporters in the castle. Following the pacification of Perth in February 1573, Maitland and the castle stood alone in support of Mary. The bombardment began on 21 May 1573 and on 29 May, Maitland and Kirkcaldy surrendered.<br>
<br>Maitland, crippled by ill health, died in mysterious circumstances in prison in Leith on 9 June 1573. It was alleged that he &#145;imitated the auld Romanes&#146;  (Melville, 256) and committed suicide to avoid the humiliation of the gallows alongside Kirkcaldy. What is certain is that the realistic hopes of Mary's restitution died with him. Morton's vindictiveness towards Maitland continued after his death, ignoring pleas for a decent burial from Maitland's family so &#145;that the vermin from it came creeping out under the door of the house&#146;  (Calderwood, 3.285).<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>There is an irony in the fact that the name Maitland, in its earlier twelfth-century form Maltalent, translates as evil genius, because many of Maitland's contemporaries vituperatively held him to be just that. He was Bannatyne's Michael Wylie, Buchanan's Chameleon, and Knox's atheist. Yet the amount of time his enemies spent defaming his character is testament to his impressive contemporary reputation. He was regarded by Elizabeth I as &#145;the flower of the wits of Scotland&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 52/19/8). Even his enemies testified to his academic brilliance, and Robert Sempill, who denounced him as a &#145;scurvy scholar of Machiavelli's lair&#146;, grudgingly respected his ability to:<blockquote>
<div>both quhissill and cloik,<br>
</div>
<div>And his mouth full of meil.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Satirical Poems of the &hellip; Reformation</span>, 1.131)</blockquote>John Spottiswoode refers to him as &#145;a man of deep wit, great experience and one whose counsels were held at that time for oracles&#146;  (Spottiswoode, 2.193).<br>
<br>Maitland cuts a brilliant, colourful, controversial and even romantic figure. In the midst of his romance with Mary Fleming he declared love to be the &#145;most singular remedy for all diseases in all persons&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 52/10/21). He was certainly Machiavellian in the sense that, to him, the end justified the means, and he consistently manipulated religion for political ends, but despite the charges of Buchanan he was capable of both bravery and loyalty. During his doomed defence of Edinburgh Castle he rejected generous offers to abandon Mary and secure his own safety. While it is going too far to agree with the view that he alone in Scotland thought in terms that were neither religious nor personal, it is undeniable that he stayed true to his vision of the ultimate union of the realms.<br>
