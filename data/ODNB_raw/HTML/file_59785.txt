<span class="headword">Brown,  (Arthur) Godfrey Kilner</span>  (1915&#150;1995), <span class="occ">athlete and schoolmaster</span>, was born on 21 February 1915 in Bankura, Bengal, India, the fourth child and third son of the Revd Arthur E. Brown, principal of Bankura College, Bengal, and his wife, Gertrude Parsons. His parents met at Cambridge, where his father took a first in mathematics before embarking on missionary work in India and passing on his enthusiasm for athletics to his children, of whom Godfrey was the best of a very talented family. Godfrey Brown was an exceptionally versatile runner from his days at Warwick School, and ran all distances from 100 to 880 yards. He went to Peterhouse, Cambridge, to read history in 1935 and won a blue in his first year. He made his first international appearance against Germany the same year at Munich, then returned to Berlin the following year in the British Olympic team. Like most of the athletes, he was too preoccupied with his event to take much interest in the wider political and racial aspects of the 1936 games. &#145;Keeping politics out of sport&#146; was at the core of the amateur credo of which he was a prime exponent.<br>
<br>Not doing much in the way of training was another tenet of the English amateur. Brown, however, did rather more than most, and worked out his own routine of &#145;miles and miles of slow jogging&#146; for an hour and a half a day, relying on the Olympic heats to bring him to top form for the 400 metres final. Despite drawing the difficult outside lane, he ran a marvellous race: he almost beat Archie Williams of the United States to the gold medal, set a new European record, and knocked a full second off his best previous time. In fact, his time was even better than he knew, since he lost by only 0.02 of a second and not 0.2, as officially reported, &#145;so as not to injure the vanity of the hand time-keepers&#146;, as Norris McWhirter discovered much later.<br>
<br>Brown was a shy, reserved figure, &#145;never an aggressively competitive person but he had a quiet determination&#146;, as his sister recalled. &#145;Although he never spoke of it&#146;, she continued, &#145;I always felt he was very disappointed with himself for not winning the Gold Medal&#146;  (private information). His greatest moment, however, followed hard upon his greatest disappointment. Brown was chosen to run the final leg of the 4 &times; 400 metres relay against strong American and German teams. Alongside Brown the British team consisted of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/105114/', "Freddie Wolff")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/105113/', "Roberts, William")</script>], <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/105113/', "Bill Roberts")</script>, a powerful quarter-miler who had just missed a bronze in the 400 metres individual event, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/102161/', "Godfrey Rampling")</script>, an army officer and relay silver medallist from the 1932 Olympics. Preparation for the race was wonderfully unscientific. Duncanson and Collins recall Rampling saying, &#145;Look here chaps, we really ought to practise some baton-changing&#146;, but adding &#145;we soon got bored and packed it in&#146;  (Duncanson and Collins, 33). Brown, however, was less casual. He had watched the Americans and was convinced the British team had the talent to win. Wolff ran an indifferent first leg but Rampling ran a great second lap, making up the deficit and giving Roberts a slight lead which he extended, leaving Brown to bring home the title in style by a margin of about 15 metres.<br>
<br>It was Britain's only track gold medal of the games and brought Brown to the attention of the general public. He was still only twenty-one and ran successfully in 1937 and in 1938, clocking a personal best for the 880 yards in America in 1937 and remaining unbeaten in 1938. By then he had left Cambridge and started a career as a schoolmaster. Lack of time for training told in his relatively poor form in 1939. Extreme short-sightedness&#151;he always ran with glasses&#151;meant he spent the war as a schoolmaster and he never recovered his pre-war form. On 15 April 1939 he married Mary Denholm Armstrong (1915/16&#150;1993), the daughter of a railway manager, with whom he had four children, three daughters and a son. He kept up his links with athletics through summer coaching schemes, acted as an official at meetings, and even built a cinder running track with the help of a few volunteers at Cheltenham College, where he taught from 1943 to 1950. From 1950 until 1978 he was headmaster of Worcester Royal Grammar School, where he taught sixth-form history and set up a development fund which enabled a major building programme to be completed, including a new science wing. Despite poor sight he was a good rugby player and cricketer and was active within the local community, prominent in getting the Swan Theatre built in Worcester, and playing the French horn in the local orchestra.<br>
<br>Brown always set great store by his family's remarkable athletic achievements. His sister Audrey Brown [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/96973/', "Court, Audrey Kathleen (1913&#150;2005)")</script>] won a silver medal in the 100 metres relay in the 1936 Olympics, while his elder brother Ralph, later Sir Ralph Kilner Brown (1909&#150;2003) was an <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92495', "Amateur Athletic Association")</script> champion hurdler (and a future High Court judge). But for injury, Ralph would have joined his brother and sister at Berlin in 1936 in a unique triumph for &#145;muscular Christianity&#146; and for the Achilles club, of which the brothers were both members.<br>
<br>Brown retired to Clifton upon Teme, Worcestershire, and then to Sussex. His wife died in 1993 and he died two years later, on 4 February 1995, shortly before his eightieth birthday, in Crawley Hospital, Sussex.<br>
