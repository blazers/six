</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bellenger,  Frederick John</span>  (1894&#150;1968), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at 46 Bishops Road, Bethnal Green, east London, on 23 July 1894, the son of Eugene Bernard Bellenger, dairyman, and his wife, Isabella Annette Henner. After an elementary education he worked in a tea warehouse, was a post office messenger boy, and had a range of commercial jobs. He volunteered for military service in 1914, went to the western front the following year as a gunner in the Royal Artillery, was twice wounded, and was commissioned second lieutenant in 1917. While serving in the army of occupation in Cologne, he met and in 1922 married Marion Theresa, daughter of Karl Stollwerck, one of the largest chocolate manufacturers in Germany. They had five sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Bellenger's marriage meant economic security. He worked as a surveyor and estate agent in west London and was active in East Fulham Conservative Association. In 1922 and again in 1925 he was elected to Fulham borough council as a Municipal Reformer (that is Conservative) for Barons Court ward. He did not stand again in 1928 and shortly afterwards joined the Labour Party. His reason for this shift is unclear. He never showed any evidence of a decisive political conversion. In June 1930 he became the prospective Labour candidate for South West Bethnal Green but abandoned the candidacy a year later on health grounds. He was not tempted to support the National Government, and in the early 1930s served as honorary secretary of the Labour Candidates' Association. In November 1933 he was selected as Labour candidate for the north Nottinghamshire constituency of Bassetlaw. His selection could have been facilitated by his willingness to finance the local party: in the 1930s he paid &pound;190 a year, one-third of the local party's annual income.<br>
<br>The seat had traditionally been Conservative but its politics were gradually transformed by the eastward expansion of the Nottinghamshire coalfield. Bassetlaw's first Labour member in 1929 had been the party leader's son, Malcolm MacDonald; he had retained the seat easily in 1931 as a supporter of the National Government. Four years later, in November 1935, after a close contest, Bellenger won the seat from MacDonald, and held it until his death. Bellenger's victory was based on the near monolithic support of the mining villages.<br>
<br>Once in the Commons Bellenger rarely articulated the concerns of his most loyal constituents. One exception came in the spring of 1937 when a long-running dispute at Harworth colliery heralded the end of the decade-long split between the Nottinghamshire Miners' Association and the breakaway Nottinghamshire Miners' Industrial Union (the &#145;Spencer Union&#146;). Bellenger dutifully presented the Nottinghamshire Miners' Association's case in the Commons, but his distance from the harshness of coalfield life was apparent. His electoral position became impregnable but his affluence and army officer style distanced him from many supporters. He could evoke a degree of deference but others found him aloof, relating to party members with the expectations of a commanding officer.<br>
<br>Bellenger's parliamentary career began inauspiciously when an early dinner with Hugh Dalton produced a dismissive verdict by that political talent spotter&#151;&#145;talked disconnected rot in a tiresome way&#146;  (20 Nov 1935, <span class="italic">Politica diary</span>, 194). Dalton's verdict arguably highlighted a lack of political judgement on Bellenger's part, an assessment that would become more widely held. Yet in the late 1930s Bellenger was a highly visible MP, not least in his criticism of Neville Chamberlain and the Munich agreement. Less ostentatiously Bellenger disagreed with the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) in its opposition to compulsory military training in the spring of 1939 and abstained on two votes of principle.<br>
<br>As a member of the officers' emergency reserve, Bellenger was called to the colours in October 1939. A captain in the Royal Artillery from February 1940, he went to France in April 1940 as a staff officer. He returned briefly to Westminster early in May and spoke in the debate that precipitated the fall of the Chamberlain government. With the retreat of the British expeditionary force he spent two days and nights on the Dunkirk beaches, helping to organize the evacuation and living off scraps of chocolate and bottles of French wine. Two months later he resigned his commission to concentrate on his parliamentary work.<br>
<br>Although he supported Labour participation in the Churchill coalition, Bellenger became a back-bench critic, arguing for a more efficient prosecution of the war. He was one of the eight Labour MPs to support the no confidence motion moved by Sir John Wardlaw-Milne in July 1942, and later rebelled on several issues including opposition to British policy in liberated Greece in December 1944. Although such dissent could align him with members of the Labour left, his own position remained firmly on the party's right. His standing within the PLP remained modest, but he acquired prominence as a journalist. From February 1941, he wrote a weekly column for the <span class="italic">Sunday Pictorial</span> initially under the byline &#145;The Voice of the Army&#146;, and later &#145;Voice of the Services&#146;. He became identified as the &#145;soldier's friend&#146;, a source of advice on problems and grievances.<br>
<br>Bellenger's reputation for expertise on military matters ensured a ministerial post in the post-war Labour government. Few Labour MPs were interested in the subject, and new MPs with recent military experience were not considered. He became financial secretary at the War Office, with Jack Lawson, a Durham miners' MP, as secretary of state. Lawson was amiable and administratively passive. Bellenger succeeded him as secretary of state at the beginning of October 1946. His promotion was part of a wider reconstruction that took A. V. Alexander to a new post as minister of defence. As a consequence Bellenger was not in the cabinet but was appointed to the privy council.<br>
<br>Bellenger's wartime column might have led some generals to dismiss him as a &#145;stunt journalist&#146;, but as secretary of state he rapidly gained the approval of Bernard Montgomery. &#145;He leaves me alone, signs everything put to him and is clearly anxious to please&#146;  (Montgomery to Sir John Grigg, 31 Oct 1946, Scott, 77). Bellenger's ministerial outlook was immediately apparent in his response to a crisis inherited from his predecessor&#151;the sentences imposed in September 1946 on 243 airborne division mutineers at the Muar camp in Malaya. The action had been in response to appalling living conditions; their plight aroused considerable sympathy within the labour movement. Although the sentences were quashed on legal grounds, Bellenger's robust defence of military discipline eroded the image of the &#145;soldier's friend&#146;.<br>
<br>Bellenger also acquiesced in military demands for manpower. Such compliance produced criticism from Labour back-benchers associated with the Keep Left group. When the army estimates were debated in March 1947 Bellenger had a rough passage; his critics were forceful and often knowledgeable. A few weeks later he was involved in the passage of legislation to introduce peacetime conscription, a measure that produced widespread disquiet in the PLP. In the ministerial reshuffle of October 1947, which followed a period of difficulties for the Attlee government, Bellenger was replaced by Shinwell (whose removal from the Ministry of Fuel and Power had become a political necessity). Bellenger's demotion was the result of his limitations as a minister, the complexities of a reshuffle, and his lack of a political base within the PLP.<br>
<br>As a senior back-bencher Bellenger spoke frequently in the Commons and at PLP meetings. He was an early supporter of Hugh Gaitskell's claims for the Labour leadership, a thorough champion of the Anglo-American alliance, a firm anti-Communist, and a strong advocate of German rearmament. The last reflected both his support for the western alliance and his commitment to Anglo-German friendship. He became sceptical about Labour's attachment to public ownership and saw strikes as unnecessary. Yet in other respects he was far removed from Gaitskellite liberalism. He opposed attempts to reform laws governing sexual behaviour. As decolonization gathered pace, he became increasingly sympathetic to Rhodesia's white settlers, a position unaffected by the declaration of independence by Ian Smith's government in November 1965. Within the PLP Bellenger was seen increasingly as an anachronism. The Bassetlaw party, concerned at his distance from party policy on steel nationalization and Rhodesia, insisted that the 1966 election should be his last. He died at his London home, 198 Old Brompton Road, Kensington, on 11 May 1968.<br>
<br>Bellenger's limited political impact owed something to his style; he was not an inspirational speaker. More significantly his unusual background meant that he did not fit any of the dominant Labour Party identities. He was distant from and could be hostile to trade union practices. He lacked a socialist pedigree, and especially in his later years barely referred to socialism, nor was he at one with the university-educated progressive intellectuals who were influential within the post-war Labour Party. A man of the right, he was close neither to Bassetlaw's moderate miners, nor latterly to the self-conscious modernizers around Hugh Gaitskell.<br>
