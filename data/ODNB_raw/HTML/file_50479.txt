<span class="headword">Simpson,  John</span>  (1808/9&#150;1864), <span class="occ">caterer</span>, is of unknown parentage; the John Simpson first mentioned as proprietor of the Three Tuns, Billingsgate, from 1828 to 1844, may be either the subject or his father. It is likewise not known whether he was related to the John Simpson who in 1723 opened his &#145;Fish Ordinary&#146;, an unpretentious eating house in Bell Alley, Billingsgate, in the City of London. This Simpson sold up and retired, but came back into the restaurant trade shortly afterwards when he acquired the Queen's Arms in Bird-in-Hand Court, Cheapside. Renamed Simpson's, the restaurant flourished into the twentieth century.<br>
<br>In 1848 John Simpson moved to Westminster to join Samuel Reiss who in 1828 had opened his &#145;cigar divan&#146; (a lounge where gentlemen could gather to smoke cigars) on the site of the old Fountain Tavern at 103 Strand. Under Simpson's management, the divan was enlarged, with a restaurant and tavern, and renamed as Simpson's Grand Divan Tavern. This establishment also prospered; in the 1851 census the Cigar Divan at 103 Strand was home to the tavern keeper and sixteen staff, while the manager and five staff lived at 101&#150;2 Strand. The restaurant was, according to the Baedeker guide for 1866, a &#145;large well-appointed establishment&#146;.<br>
<br>Four years earlier Simpson had sold out to Edmund William Calthie, and on 4 February 1865 a prospectus was issued for a company to be called Simpson's (Ltd) with capital of &pound;100,000 to purchase and extend the business of Simpson's Divan Tavern. The prospectus stated that the opening of the nearby Charing Cross station had brought a great increase in trade, that Simpson and his partners had retired wealthy men, that the new directors had bought the lease of 101&#150;3 Strand and the goodwill, and that they would retain Calthie as manager.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Simpson's wife, but their son, Thomas Simpson, was born in Wandsworth, Surrey, in 1837 and by the time of the 1861 census was farming 600 acres near St Albans, Hertfordshire. John Simpson died aged fifty-five on 22 January 1864. According to the death notice placed in the <span class="italic">Watford Observer</span>  (30 Jan 1864, 1f) he was &#145;of Langley Lodge, Langley, Herts. (late of the Divan Tavern, Strand)&#146;, and died at the Essex Arms Inn, Watford, but according to probate of his will, he was of East Barnet, Hertfordshire, and died at the Clarendon Hotel, Watford. Simpson's restaurant was purchased for the Savoy Group by Richard D'Oyly Carte in 1898 and refurbished five years later. It reopened in 1904 and, as &#145;Simpsons-in-the-Strand&#146;, continues to attract a fashionable clientele.<br>
