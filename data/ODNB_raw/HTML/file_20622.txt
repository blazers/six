<span class="headword">Ogston,  Francis</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1803, <em>d.</em> 1887), <span class="occ">expert in forensic medicine</span>, baptized in Aberdeen on 23 July 1803, was the third son of Alexander Ogston, the founder of a large soap factory in Aberdeen, and his wife, Helen Milne. He was educated at the grammar school and at Marischal College, Aberdeen, completing his medical course at Edinburgh University, where he graduated MD in 1824. Subsequently he travelled and studied on the continent. Having settled at Aberdeen, he soon acquired a large practice. In 1827 he began to teach chemistry privately.<br>
<br>In 1831 Ogston was appointed Aberdeen city police surgeon and began his long association with the city and university of Aberdeen. In 1839 he was appointed the first lecturer on medical jurisprudence at Marischal College. The appointment, coming in the wake of proposed reforms to university syllabuses, echoed the foundation of a regius chair of medical jurisprudence and public health at the University of Glasgow in 1839. The Aberdeen lectureship was elevated to a chair of medical jurisprudence and medical logic in 1857. The chair was endowed by Dr Alexander Henderson of Caskieburn, who stipulated that two-fifths of the course should be devoted to medical logic and that Ogston should be the chair's first incumbent. In an age when medical testimony was often suspect, Henderson's objective was to equip Aberdeen medical graduates with sound principles of reasoning when giving evidence in court. On 17 June 1841 Ogston married Amelia Cadenhead (<i>d</i>. 1852), daughter of Alexander Cadenhead, procurator fiscal for Aberdeen. They had at least two sons and a daughter. Ogston's brother-in-law, George Cadenhead, became procurator fiscal on his father's death in 1854 and remained in post until 1886 on his appointment as Aberdeen county procurator fiscal.<br>
<br>In 1860, when Marischal College was united to King's College to form the University of Aberdeen, under the <span class="roman">Universities (Scotland) Act</span> 1858, Ogston's appointment was maintained, and he continued to occupy the chair of medical jurisprudence until his retirement in 1883. Ogston frequently gave evidence in the judiciary courts and the lucidity of his medical reports drew praise even from the formidable Lord Deas. Ogston's lectures, <span class="italic">Lectures on Medical Jurisprudence</span>, edited by his son Frank, were published in 1878. The lectures drew heavily on continental and English writers but contained clear examples of Scottish procedures and local case histories. An example of Ogston's grim humour is evident in his repetition of Marie Devergie's instructions on exhumation: 1. Never to proceed to the operation fasting, and to be sure first to take a dram.<br>
<br>In 1862 Aberdeen appointed Ogston as its first medical officer of health under the terms of the 1862 <span class="roman">Aberdeen Police Act</span>. He remained medical officer of health for Aberdeen until 1881. Ogston continued the established practice of Scottish medical dynasties and employed his two sons Alexander and Frank as assistants in both his university and city appointments. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38344/', "Alexander Ogston")</script> went on to become professor of surgery at Aberdeen, and Frank, after failing to succeed his father in 1883, became professor of public health and forensic medicine at Otago University, New Zealand. Thus, in Aberdeen, the offices of police surgeon, professor of forensic medicine, crown witness, medical officer of health, and procurator fiscal were bound together by close familial ties for half a century.<br>
<br>Ogston was chosen dean of the faculty of medicine in Aberdeen, and was twice representative of the senatus at the university court. In 1883 he retired from the chair of medical jurisprudence. Two years afterwards the university conferred on him the honorary degree of LLD. He died suddenly at his home, 13 Albyn Terrace, Aberdeen, on 25 September 1887.<br>
