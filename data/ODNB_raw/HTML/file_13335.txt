<span class="headword">Hincks,  Edward</span>  (1792&#150;1866), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, eldest of the seven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13338/', "Thomas Dix Hincks (1767&#150;1857)")</script> and his wife, Anne Boult (1767&#150;1835), was born at Princess Street, Cork, on 19 August 1792. His younger brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13339/', "William Hincks")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13336/', "Francis Hincks")</script>. The family moved to Windmill Hill (later St Patrick's Hill) about 1797. After education by his father and some time at Midleton School from 1800, he proceeded on 2 November 1807 to Trinity College, Dublin, where he was elected a scholar on 18 June 1810 and graduated BA with the gold medal on 11 February 1812. He was elected a junior fellow on 14 June 1813. He was ordained deacon in 1815 and priest in 1817, taking his MA in the same year. After acting for various periods as deputy librarian, he later published a <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Egyptian Manuscripts in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin</span> (1843). In September 1819 Hincks was named rector of Ardtrea, leaving Dublin possibly because of differences with the provost. On 6 February 1823 in Lurgan church he married Jane Dorothea Boyd (1792&#150;1870); they had four daughters. Hincks became BD in July 1823 and DD in 1829. In October 1825 he was appointed rector of Killyleagh, co. Down, where he lived until his death. His hopes of advancement in the church remained unfulfilled, probably because of his liberal views.<br>
<br>Despite the seclusion of his country rectory, Hincks established a reputation of the first order among the pioneers of decipherment, with articles published mainly in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy</span>. His earlier contributions were chiefly on the subject of Egyptian hieroglyphs, and Hincks was the first to employ the true method for their transliteration. From 1846 his studies were directed to cuneiform, as was shown by his papers on Babylonian, Assyrian, old Persian, and Elamite inscriptions, and the Urartian inscriptions from Van. The analytical powers displayed in these essays were very considerable. Hincks enjoyed the distinction of the discovery of the true nature of the Babylonian cuneiform syllabic system, showing greater perception than Sir Henry Creswicke Rawlinson (1810&#150;1895) in his work on the same subject at Baghdad. Many other discoveries may be noted among his numerous articles. He was one of those chosen in 1857 in a public demonstration of the accuracy of cuneiform decipherment and was awarded the Prussian order of merit in 1863. But Hincks was disappointed at the lack of public recognition of his achievements in Britain, and his failure to obtain a more financially secure position to allow him to devote more time to his studies. He died suddenly at Killyleagh rectory on 3 December 1866 while reading in bed, possibly from a heart attack or stroke, and was buried in the old parish graveyard there.<br>
