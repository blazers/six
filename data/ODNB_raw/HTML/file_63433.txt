<span class="headword">Maclean <span class="st"> [Macklier, Makel&eacute;er]</span>,  John <span class="st"> [Hans; </span></span> <span class="st"> styled Sir John Maclean, baronet]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1666), <span class="occ">merchant in Sweden</span>, was born in Scotland in the early 1600s, the son of Hector Maclean, laird of Duart, and his wife, Isabella Acheson, daughter of Sir Archibald Acheson of Gosford. Known as Iain Dubh in his youth, little is known of Maclean's early life, though he is sometimes described as having been in Stuart naval service and sometimes as a merchant and trader in Germany. In 1623&#150;4 he was a royal supplier to Queen Maria Eleanora in Stockholm, where his trading partner James had been a burgess since 1609. He married James's wife's sister, Anna Gubbertz (<i>d</i>. 1653), in 1629 and had fifteen children with her, though only ten survived to adulthood. First recorded in G&ouml;teborg in 1628, he became a burgess there the following year. His main trade was in iron bars and timber, but included shipbuilding materials, salt, herrings, spirits, and English coal. His success allowed him to build up a small fleet of his own. He represented G&ouml;teborg in the 1632 Swedish parliament, and from 1635 to 1650 he served as a town councillor, taking an active role in ecclesiastical, educational, customs, and building activities. He entertained the Swedish regent, Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna, and the state marshal, Jakob de la Gardie, on their visit to G&ouml;teborg in 1639.<br>
<br>During the bishops' wars in Scotland, Maclean supplied the covenanters with ships and weapons from Sweden. He also funded the Irish &#145;wild geese&#146; who settled in G&ouml;teborg in 1640&#150;47 to receive military training from the Ulfsparre family. From 1643 to 1645 he played a vital role in defending G&ouml;teborg from Danish attack by supplying the Swedish crown with food and clothing on credit and by furnishing warships and privateers. He organized and funded a reconnaissance mission to Copenhagen in 1644. He also called on the personal fleet of his friend the Walloon financier Louis de Geer, to protect G&ouml;teborg harbour from the Danes. Maclean's business success continued as he and his associates established a rope and sail factory in G&ouml;teborg on 20 May 1646. He again represented G&ouml;teborg at the parliament in 1649. He was ennobled under the name of Macklier (sometimes written Makel&eacute;er) on 20 May 1649 and formally introduced into the Swedish house of nobility in 1652. When the Stuart envoy Colonel John Cochrane was sent to Scandinavia in 1649 to obtain military support for Charles II, Maclean provided James Graham, marquess of Montrose, with ships and weapons at his own expense, though two shipments appear to have been intercepted by the English Commonwealth fleet. The exiled Charles II created him a baronet on 13 April 1650, though no patent was ever issued; this honour was perhaps in lieu of the 1350 riksdaler Charles owed him and which Maclean never received. His involvement with Montrose may be explained by the marriage of his eldest son, Jacob (Jakob), to Cochrane's daughter Catherine.<br>
<br>In 1653 Maclean married, as his second wife, Lilian Hamilton (<i>d</i>. 1658). He met the Cromwellian ambassador Bulstrode Whitelocke several times during Whitelocke's embassy to Sweden in 1653&#150;4, presumably in the capacity of a civic official for G&ouml;teborg. In 1658 he received three royal donations of land in Halland, Sweden. That year he was married for the third time; his wife was Anna Gordon (<i>d</i>. 1677), daughter of another Scot in Sweden, Colonel Thomas Thomson, and his wife, Catherine Murray, and widow of Johan Gordon, colonel in the Swedish army. In 1660 he received the title of &#145;commissary&#146;. He still sought the repayment of his money and goods lost in Montrose's campaign and sent Charles II a bill for &pound;9112 at 8 per cent to be paid over the following decade, but to no avail. His sons had varied careers. The eldest, Jacob (1632&#150;1663), became a gentleman-in-waiting to Charles II and a colonel in the Stuart army. Johan (1636&#150;1696) became the president of the court of justice in G&ouml;teborg, while Gustav (1641&#150;1701) and Peter (1644&#150;1697) both became colonels in the Swedish army. David (1646&#150;1708) became the first Baron Maclean in Sweden, serving as an assistant to the Swedish ambassador to Britain in 1674, and becoming a colonel and governor in the Swedish army. John Maclean died in G&ouml;teborg on 7 July 1666 and was buried in the German church there on 16 August.<br>
