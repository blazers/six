<span class="headword">Cranford,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1645), <span class="occ">composer</span>, is of unknown origins. He is known as a proficient, minor musician of the pre-Commonwealth period, though little is recorded about his life. He was active as a composer at least from the second decade of the seventeenth century and appears to have been based in London throughout his career. On the death of Prince Henry in 1612 he wrote an elegy for six voices, &#145;Weep, Brittaynes, weep&#146;, and he contributed the psalm tune &#145;Ely&#146; to Thomas Ravenscroft's <span class="italic">The Whole Booke of Psalmes</span> of 1621. At this time he was probably associated with St Paul's Cathedral; certainly by 1624 he was a lay vicar there, and he continued to hold that post until the 1640s. Little of Cranford's church music survives, and much of this is incompletely preserved. His verse anthems include the simple &#145;O Lord, make thy servant Charles&#146;, which dates probably from the early years of Charles I's reign. The text of one of his anthems was included at the Restoration in James Clifford's <span class="italic">The Divine Services and Anthems</span> (1663).<br>
<br>Cranford's secular music consists mainly of catches and instrumental works. The former, of which John Hawkins thought highly, include &#145;Boy come back&#146;, which appears in some of John Playford's anthologies with a companion piece, &#145;Boy go down&#146;, by Simon Ives, a fellow singer at St Paul's. Another catch, &#145;Let's live good honest lives&#146;, was later adapted by Henry Purcell (Hawkins claimed that Purcell added the words). Although he held no position at court, Cranford wrote much music for viol consort; the twenty surviving examples include fantasias, dances, and variations, most of them composed in or before the 1630s. Later writers have noted in these works a distinctive harmonic style and interesting textural effects, and in these respects his consort music has much in common with that of one of the major composers in the field, William Lawes. Cranford died probably about 1645, in which year his name was not recorded with those of other vicars-choral at St Paul's.<br>
