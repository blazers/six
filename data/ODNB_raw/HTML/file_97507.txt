<span class="headword">Williams,  Ursula Moray</span>  (1911&#150;2006), <span class="occ">children's writer and illustrator</span>, was born on 19 April 1911 at Cherrycroft, Bell Hill, Petersfield, Hampshire, the younger of identical twins of Arthur Moray Williams (1878&#150;1959), a classics tutor at Bedales School and amateur archaeologist, and his wife, Mabel Lizzie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Unwin (1874&#150;<i>c</i>.1954), a Froebel-trained teacher and sister of the publisher Stanley Unwin. Her paternal grandfather was John Alfred Williams, vicar of Alderminster, Warwickshire, and grandson of another John Alfred Williams, who had built up a fortune in Birmingham pin manufacturing. Her father liked to be known as Mr Moray Williams and gave each of his children the middle name Moray, but this was never formally part of their surname. After the First World War the family moved to Southampton, where her father took up a full-time post with the Red Cross. Living in part of a large, crumbling, eccentric mansion, Williams and her identical twin sister Barbara (<i>d</i>. 1975) spent a happy childhood full of reading, storytelling, imaginative games, ponies, and writing their own books for family consumption. They were educated mainly at home, first by their devoutly religious mother and later with governesses, before spending a year at a girls' school near Lake Annecy, France, at the age of seventeen, and then moving on together to Winchester College of Art. While Barbara went on to the Royal College of Art, later achieving distinction as the wood engraver and sculptor Barbara &Aacute;rnason, Ursula stayed only a year at Winchester before deciding that writing was, for her, more than a childhood interest and could develop into her chosen career. Her parents supported her to stay at home and write, and her uncle Stanley Unwin encouraged her early ambitions and later steered her towards a good agent.<br>
<br>Williams's books often drew on her girlhood experiences; her first book, <span class="italic">Jean&#150;Pierre</span> (1931), about a little boy and his pet goat, was published when she was just twenty. She provided her own pen and ink illustrations for almost half her books; some were illustrated by her sister, but with Barbara's marriage and move to Iceland, long-distance collaboration became more difficult, and over time Williams worked with many other well-known illustrators, including Edward Ardizzone, Shirley Hughes, Faith Jaques, and Eileen Soper.<br>
<br>On 28 September 1935 Williams married Conrad Southey (known as Peter) John, a thirty-year-old aircraft manufacturer, later contracts manager, and great-grandson of the poet Robert Southey. While pregnant with the first of their four sons she wrote <span class="italic">Adventures of the Little Wooden Horse</span> (1938). A long episodic story about a wooden horse in search of his master through many ups and downs, its &#145;read-aloud&#146; style owed something to her enjoyment of being read to as a child, and perhaps the storytelling she herself had done as a Brownie Guide leader. Charmingly illustrated by Joyce Lankester Brisley (better known as the author and illustrator of the Milly-Molly-Mandy stories), the book was an immediate publishing success. Arrangements with nannies left afternoons free for work, so that Williams was able to combine writing and motherhood, and she was one of relatively few children's writers to be published throughout the Second World War, despite the paper shortage. She wrote mostly under her maiden name, although as Ursula John she had written <span class="italic">The Adventures of Boss and Dingbat</span> (1937), with photographs by Peter John, and also under that name was a contributor to <span class="italic">The Robin</span> magazine and annual in the 1950s and early 1960s.<br>
<br>A recurring theme of Williams's writing is the &#145;sentient toy&#146; that identifies with human needs and emotions. Thus the Little Wooden Horse has an indomitable spirit through many adventures, as well as kindness and persistence, and the clockwork doll&#150;child Marta (in <span class="italic">The Toymaker's Daughter</span>, 1968) longs to experience what it is to be human. Williams's writing unselfconsciously recalled the fairytales and imaginative games she enjoyed in childhood. In an interview with Elaine Moss in 1971 she mentioned the toy hobby horses she and her sister owned when young; and how much she had adored the story of Pinocchio. Moss then went on to speculate: &#145;had it ever occurred to her that her childhood passion for Pinocchio might have been partly responsible for the creation of the little wooden horse? Clearly it hadn't&#146;  (Moss, 55). Many children's writers of the 1950s and 1960s owed something to this earlier, much-loved episodic toy fantasy; those who developed new &#145;read-aloud&#146; expressions of the &#145;sentient toy&#146; theme included Joan G. Robinson (the Teddy Robinson series, 1953 onwards), Modwena Sedgwick (the Galldora stories, about a rag doll, from 1960), and Rumer Godden (in various doll stories).<br>
<br>Williams was modest about her work, and never achieved a literary award. However, some of her best-loved books, including <span class="italic">Adventures of the Little Wooden Horse</span> and <span class="italic">Gobbolino the Witch's Cat</span> (1942), about a reluctant witch's accomplice seeking a more domestic life, were enjoyed by several generations and remained in print more than half a century later, testimonies to the pleasure her work, full of adventure, loyalty, fun, and kindness, gave to many. Her productive writing career covered some seventy years, and after her husband died in 1974 she continued with writing, gardening, giving talks to schools, and involvement in local life in the village of Beckford, in Worcestershire, where she had lived since 1945, serving as a magistrate on the Evesham juvenile bench for many years. She died at Tewkesbury Nursing Home, Bushley, Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, on 17 October 2006, and was survived by three of her four sons.<br>
