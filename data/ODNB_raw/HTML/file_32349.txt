<span class="headword">Chamberlain,  Houston Stewart</span>  (1855&#150;1927), <span class="occ">racialist writer</span>, was born on 9 September 1855 in Southsea, the last of the four children (one daughter and three sons) of Rear-Admiral William Charles Chamberlain (1818&#150;1878), and his first wife, Eliza Jane (1825?&#150;1856?), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11944/', "Captain Basil Hall RN")</script> and granddaughter of Sir James Hall. His brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49731/', "Basil Hall Chamberlain")</script>, and he was nephew of Field Marshal Sir Neville Bowles Chamberlain, of General Sir Crawford Trotter Chamberlain, and of Major-General Thomas Hardy Chamberlain. Much of his early childhood was spent in Versailles, where he briefly attended the Lyc&eacute;e Imp&eacute;rial. From 1867 to 1869 Chamberlain went through a miserable period at Cheltenham College, and thereafter he saw as little as possible of England. In the years 1870&#150;74 he was privately tutored by Otto Kuntze, a Prussian, during extensive travels and sojourns in France, Switzerland, and Italy. By the mid-1870s it was clear that nervous disabilities (which proved to be a lifelong affliction) would render him unfit for the military career otherwise almost dictated by his pedigree. On 9 April 1878 Chamberlain married Anna Horst, daughter of a Breslau lawyer, and then proceeded to study natural sciences at the University of Geneva (1879&#150;84). Henceforth he survived on private family funds and through literary earnings, especially as author of works celebrating many aspects of Teutonic achievement. He lived in Dresden from 1885 to 1889 and began to produce articles about the Wagnerian cultural legacy. He then moved to Vienna, where he wrote not only his book on <span class="italic">Das Drama Richard Wagners</span> (1892) and a life of the composer (1896), but also a biological study of <span class="italic">Recherches sur la s&egrave;ve ascendante</span> (1897). During the latter part of this decade Chamberlain accepted a commission from the Munich publishing house of Bruckmann to prepare a historical work which, as the century reached its close, would take stock of the condition of civilization. It was this, <span class="italic">Die Grundlagen des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts</span> (2 vols., 1899), which made him famous.<br>
<br>The book, as Geoffrey Field observes, &#145;turned Chamberlain almost overnight into the prophet of race for educated laymen in Central Europe&#146;. It was breathtaking in its range of scholarship, but also crude in its political intent. The treatise focused principally on Europe from classical times to the French Revolution, yet was never continued into that more detailed study of the nineteenth century itself which the author had originally envisaged. Chamberlain presented modern civilization as having been shaped largely by five influences: the aesthetics and philosophy of Greece; the statecraft of Rome; the world-redeeming revelation of Christ; the alien and destructive influence of the Jew; and the regenerative power of <i>der Germane</i>, the hero of the Aryan&#150;Teutonic races. These last, though initially deemed to embrace also the Celts and Slavs, become in the <span class="italic">Grundlagen</span> ever more emphatically equated with their most illustrious branch&#151;that of <i>die Deutsche</i>, or Teutons in the narrower Tacitean sense of the term. The fulfilment of their racial destiny could not properly begin until the world-historical event of Christ's birth had converted the Graeco-Roman legacy into a form that they could exploit. Thus the Messiah who erupts into these pages is not merely non-Jewish, but also a haughty figure more akin to a Bismarckian Junker than to the conventional paragon of humility. This is a God well fitted to inspire the Teuton in his subsequent struggle against the Jew, fought for the survival both of Christian civilization and of racial virtue.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Grundlagen</span> places particular stress on the protestant Reformation, as a decisive Germanic act of liberation from the vacuous universalism of Catholic Rome. Even more strikingly, the Renaissance too is portrayed as a flowering of Teutonic genius, with artists such as Leonardo and Michelangelo being brought inside the fold of the great race. This exemplifies the way in which Chamberlain's &#145;method&#146; depends on the opportunistic mixing of external physical qualities and inner spiritual ones, and thus on the process of validation by reference to &#145;intuition&#146; whenever &#145;science&#146; might seem to fail. Through such means he sought to present the most recent half-millennium of European history as a tale of progress. Yet he did so without implying that there was anything inevitable about this achievement. The Teutonic advances had been registered only in the face of an unrelenting Semitic peril. Therefore contemporaries must recognize the continuing challenge of <i>Volkwerdung</i>&#151;not as a state of fulfilment already entirely attained, but as an ongoing struggle of racial <i>becoming</i>. This was something that Wilhelm II, among others, was pleased to hear. In a letter of 31 December 1901 he told Chamberlain that &#145;it was God who sent your book to the German people&#146;. The Kaiser treated the imperial family to readings therefrom, and also organized subsidies for a popularly priced edition. By 1914 German sales had exceeded 100,000. Meanwhile, the first Baron Redesdale (A. B. F. Mitford) had produced an enthusiastic introduction for the English translation, issued as <span class="italic">The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century</span> (2 vols., 1911). It is perhaps particularly curious that, when the book received a predictably mixed reception in Britain, no one penned a warmer welcome than George Bernard Shaw.<br>
<br>In 1906 Chamberlain separated from his first wife. On his divorce two years later, he entered on 26 December 1908 into a similarly childless marriage with Eva Wagner, the composer's only daughter. He settled now at Bayreuth, &#145;the home of my soul&#146;. There he wrote many further works, including <span class="italic">Goethe</span> (1912) and an intellectual autobiography called <span class="italic">Lebenswege meines Denkens</span> (1919). At the outbreak of the First World War he had also embarked on producing polemical essays against his native land. While German soldiers were able to admire these in a &#145;Trench Edition&#146;, the British turned the venture to their own propagandist purposes by publishing in 1916 an English translation tellingly titled <span class="italic">The Ravings of a Renegade</span>. Having been awarded the non-combatant's Iron Cross in 1915, Chamberlain at last took German citizenship in the following year. After the fall of the Wilhelmine regime he continued to correspond with the exiled Kaiser. Yet Chamberlain also began to forge ever closer links with the emergent Nazi movement. He celebrated his first meeting with its leader at Bayreuth in September 1923 by declaring in an open letter to Hitler in October: &#145;That in the hour of her deepest need Germany gives birth to a Hitler proves her vitality.&#146; Two years later, on the seventieth birthday of the ailing author, the Nazis' official journal returned the compliment, praising the <span class="italic">Grundlagen</span> as &#145;the gospel of the Volkish movement&#146;.<br>
<br>Chamberlain's final illness has been rather speculatively diagnosed as a form of multiple sclerosis. Certainly it was a condition of protracted weakening that took progressively heavier toll upon his energies from 1916 onward. He died in Bayreuth on 9 January 1927. His burial there, at the shrine of Wagnerism, was attended by Prince August Wilhelm, a son of the former Kaiser. However, far more significant for the posthumous cult of the author's reputation was Hitler's presence at the ceremony. A few months later Alfred Rosenberg, the principal &#145;philosopher&#146; of Nazism, would publish a volume whose title hailed Chamberlain as the &#145;pioneer and founder of a German future&#146;. As one of the earliest and most prominent intellectual promoters of the Hitlerite cause, this English renegade could hardly have been more deserving of such an ultimately damning panegyric.<br>
