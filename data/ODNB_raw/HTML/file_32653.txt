<span class="headword">Crum,  Walter Ewing</span>  (1865&#150;1944), <span class="occ">Coptic scholar</span>, was born on 22 July 1865 at Capelrig, Renfrewshire, the eldest son of Alexander Crum (1828&#150;1893), manufacturer and Liberal member of parliament for Renfrewshire (1880&#150;85), and his wife, Margaret Stewart (Nina), eldest daughter of Alexander Ewing, bishop of Argyll and the Isles.<br>
<br>Crum was educated at a Brighton preparatory school (from 1873), Eton College (1879&#150;84), and Balliol College, Oxford (1884&#150;8), gaining a second class in modern history. Failure to obtain a first was generally attributed to the amount of time he spent practising the violin; at one time he hoped to take it up professionally, but his instructor advised against this. Instead, he turned his attention to Egyptology, for he had become interested in the Egyptian monuments he saw on family holidays in Paris. On graduating, therefore, he proceeded first to Paris, to study Egyptology under Gaston Maspero and William Groff, and then to Munich. In 1890 he went to Berlin, on the advice of F. Ll. Griffith, to study under Adolf Erman, whose close friend he became, and Georg Steindorff. Steindorff introduced him to Coptic, which soon became his main preoccupation.<br>
<br>Crum remained in Berlin until 1892, when he applied for a post in the department of Egyptian and Assyrian antiquities at the British Museum. He came first in the examination but was rejected on medical grounds. Since his family's wealth was sufficient to support him, he made no further attempt to obtain an official post. The same year saw his first publications on Coptic, including the chapter on Coptic papyri in W. M. Flinders Petrie's <span class="italic">Medum</span>, and the first of his bibliographies of Coptic studies and Christian Egypt, which were a highly valued feature of the annual <span class="italic">Archaeological Report</span> of the Egypt Exploration Fund (later Society) until 1909. His first independent volume, <span class="italic">Coptic Manuscripts Brought from the Fayyum</span>, appeared in 1893. From that year until 1910 he assisted Petrie with the teaching of Ancient Egyptian and Coptic at University College, London; among his pupils was Sir Herbert Thompson (1859&#150;1944), who became his closest friend. During this period Crum came to feel the acute need for a new Coptic dictionary that would take account of the advances made in Coptic studies since the previous dictionary (Peyron's <span class="italic">Lexicon Copticum</span> of 1835), and especially of the quantities of new texts being found in Egypt at the time, which were mostly unpublished. He was beginning to make systematic preparations for this project when a major upheaval occurred in his domestic affairs.<br>
<br>In 1896 Crum had married Ella, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36089/', "Sir Edward Henry Sieveking")</script>, physician to Queen Victoria and the prince of Wales, but the marriage was unhappy and they had no children. At University College, however, Crum met Margaret (Madge) Hart-Davis (1876&#150;1953), who was studying Egyptology at the time, and they fell in love. When their relationship became known, in 1910, they were ostracized by the college, but Ella Crum, a Roman Catholic, refused to divorce him. He and Hart-Davis decided to elope abroad, and settled in Austria, first in Graz and later in Vienna. The two remained together for the rest of Crum's life, and she changed her surname to Crum by deed poll, but they could never marry, since Ella Crum outlived her husband.<br>
<br>In Austria the couple devoted themselves to the first stages of work on the dictionary. Crum travelled to museums and libraries all over Europe collecting material, while still finding time to edit the texts from the Theban monastery of Epiphanius brought to him in 1911 by the American Egyptologist H. E. Winlock. When war broke out in 1914 the Crums were still in Austria, but Winlock persuaded the American state department to take up their case, and they were eventually allowed to leave.<br>
<br>During the war Crum gave up half his income to charities and volunteered for work in the War Office. Afterwards he settled in Westbury-on-Trym, near Bristol, moving to Bath in 1927, where he was later joined by Thompson, who came to assist with the dictionary. This was eventually compiled from more than 240,000 slips. An earlier contract with the Berlin Academy having lapsed in the war, Crum reached an agreement with Oxford University Press in 1927 to share the cost of publication. It appeared in six parts (1929&#150;39) and at once took rank as the definitive dictionary of the Coptic language.<br>
<br>This was Crum's <i>magnum opus</i>, but by no means his only important work; he was also responsible for editing a huge number of previously unpublished Coptic texts. The two largest of his text editions were the catalogues of the Coptic manuscripts in the British Museum (1905) and in the John Rylands Library, Manchester (1909), both very substantial works. Other notable titles are one volume of the Cairo Museum catalogue, <span class="italic">Coptic Monuments</span> (1902); <span class="italic">Coptic Ostraca</span> (1902); and the first volume of <span class="italic">Koptische Rechtsurkunden des achten Jahrhunderts</span> (1912). He also contributed numerous articles to journals on Coptic and (until 1898) other Egyptological topics. A full bibliography is given in <span class="italic">Coptic Studies in Honor of Walter Ewing Crum</span> (1950), vii&#150;xi (revised from <span class="italic">Journal of Egyptian Archaeology</span>, 25, 1939, 134&#150;8). His achievements were recognized by honorary degrees of PhD (Berlin, 1910) and DLitt (Oxford, 1937); he was elected FBA in 1931. He had a flair for languages, speaking and writing French and German with ease, and knowing many other European languages, as well as Syriac, Ethiopic, and Arabic. Crum's approach to his work, despite its quantity, was always methodical and conscientious, resulting in a very high standard of accuracy. It may be noted that when he discovered that the production costs of the dictionary would be less than expected, he voluntarily repaid subventions towards them from academic bodies. He was always ready to give assistance to other scholars, and little was published on the subject without recourse to him. He could be expansive or highly strung, but was always courteous, modest, and kind. His appearance was tall and strikingly handsome, and some of his friends dubbed him &#145;our Coptic Apollo&#146;.<br>
<br>After the completion of the dictionary, Crum's energy began to fail. He spent much of his last days acting as next of kin for Thompson in the latter's final illness, and died of a sudden heart attack at his home, 19 Bathwick Hill, Bath, on 18 May 1944, shortly after learning that Thompson had no hope of recovery.<br>
