<span class="headword">Kyrle,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em> the Man of Ross]</span>  (1637&#150;1724), <span class="occ">philanthropist and landscape designer</span>, was born on 22 May 1637 at the White House, in the parish of Dymock, Gloucestershire, the eldest son of three children of Walter Kyrle (<i>d</i>. 1660) of Ross, Herefordshire, barrister, JP, and MP for Leominster in 1640, and his wife, Alice Mallet (<i>d</i>. 1663), daughter and heir of John Mallet of Berkeley, Gloucestershire. The family of Kyrle or Crull had been settled in the vicinity of Ross-on-Wye since the thirteenth century. Kyrle was educated at Gloucester and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 20 July 1654. He was admitted a student of the Middle Temple in 1657, but retired to Ross without being called to the bar. He inherited an estate worth &pound;500 per annum but added to this considerably during his lifetime, eventually assembling a mixture of freehold and copyhold property scattered throughout Herefordshire and west Gloucestershire. He was also the owner of New Mill, the principal corn mill in Ross, and he derived &pound;100 per annum from the fallage of timber in Dymock Wood. Kyrle never married but lived with his kinswoman Judith Bubb, who was his &#145;active assistant&#146; in good works and, in his own words, &#145;a very good and fine girl and a great scholar&#146;  (Davies Herefordshire Collection, AB/50, fol. 234). He spent all his life in Ross, living in a three-storied framed house adjoining the market place, which was said to have been built by his father in 1620. In politics he was a staunch loyalist and had a monogram cut into the wall of the new market hall which read &#145;Love Charles to the Heart&#146;. The only local office he held was high sheriff in 1683. He declined the office of JP.<br>
<br>Kyrle owes his fame largely to the eulogy of him in Alexander Pope's third &#145;Moral Epistle&#146;, published in 1732, eight years after his death. During his lifetime he had already earned the title of the Man of Ross or, according to Thomas Hearne, the Great Man of Ross. Kyrle never officially practised as a lawyer, but he seems to have regularly acted for his neighbours in litigious matters. For instance, in 1674 he settled a dispute about the distribution of local taxes between the borough of Ross and its rural parish. In an informal way Kyrle appears to have acted for the absentee lord of the manor of Ross, Lord Weymouth. He was called upon to arbitrate in a dispute over the traditional dole for the poor of the town, paid out of the tolls of the market place. A deed of 1690 indicates that he insisted that the keeper of the market pay the poor people of Rudhall's Hospital 56<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. a year. He also left &pound;40 in his will to the recently founded Blue Coat School. The eulogist literature which proliferated around the Man of Ross during the next two centuries claims many other virtuous acts. He provided portions for poor brides, ensured the poor had decent funerals, enabled debtors to re-establish themselves in trade, paid the fees of poor apprentices, and provided simple medicines for the sick.<br>
<br>It was this pattern of philanthropy on Kyrle's part which came to the attention of Pope, perhaps on one of his several visits to Holme Lacy House, a few miles from Ross, but most of his information came from his publisher, Jacob Tonson, who lived near Ledbury. He was looking for an exemplary character &#145;to distinguish real and solid worth from showish or plausible expense, and virtue fro' vanity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Alexander Pope</span>, 3.290&#150;91). Not all contemporaries were as impressed as Pope was with Kyrle's good character. Thomas Hearne was informed by Matthew Gibson, the rector of Abbey Dore, that his wife, Kyrle's niece, regarded the Man of Ross as the &#145;vainest man living&#146; who &#145;always hated his relations&#146;  (Money-Kyrle, 227). In the late eighteenth century Thomas Dudley Fosbroke and Charles Heath, both local writers, were able to confirm Pope's claims using the reminiscences of, among others, Mrs Clarke of Hill Court and the sexton of Ross church, William Dobbs.<br>
<br>Pope was also attracted to Kyrle because of his delight in horticulture, architecture, and urban improvement. Beyond Ross churchyard, on the sandstone cliff above the Wye, Kyrle acquired from Lord Weymouth, on a lease of 500 years, the Clevefield, which he planted and laid out as an ornamental promenade. The Prospect, as the town end of the walk became known, was also enhanced by a fountain supplied by water pumped up from the Wye, which, via a reservoir, also fed public cocks in the town. It was surrounded by walls with three classical gateways, two of which survive today. It was made accessible to the public.<br>
<br>Below the Prospect the causeway towards Wilton Bridge was also planted, while round the churchyard Kyrle established his favourite tree&#151;the elm. His hands-on approach to gardening was regarded as something of an oddity, but Pope applauded this man who consulted &#145;the Genius of the Place&#146; and engaged in extensive gardening where good sense rather than fashion was the guiding principle. Indeed, a later writer commented that Kyrle had &#145;a taste for what is now termed the picturesque&#146;  (<span class="italic">Saturday Magazine</span>, 165), creating in a precocious manner a landscape essential for the role that Ross was to play in the late eighteenth century as a centre for the Wye tour.<br>
<br>Kyrle was said by Fosbroke to be &#145;skilled in Architecture, (and a great patron of workmen)&#146;  (Fosbroke, 10). In 1721 he supervised the replacement of the top of the spire of Ross church and designed some new pinnacles. The vicarages of Foy and Much Marcle in Herefordshire were &#145;rebuilt or altered under his direction&#146;  (ibid., 152), and Hill Court, close to Ross, rebuilt by Richard and Joseph Clarke about 1700, has also been attributed to him. Nearly a century later, the elderly Mrs Clarke remembered that Kyrle had frequently been a guest of the Clarkes, and in the garden there is a gateway very close in style to those on the Prospect.<br>
<br>Kyrle died in Ross on 7 November 1724 in his eighty-eighth year and, following an extended period of mourning, he was buried on 20 November. In his will he asked to be buried in the chancel of Ross church, at the feet of the late rector, Dr Whiting, his friend and the founder of the town's Blue Coat School. The grave was marked with a simple stone inscribed with the initials J. K. Pope noticed that he lacked a memorial, but in a letter to Tonson assumed this was a deliberate act of self-effacement. In 1749 an inscribed stone was provided which commemorated Kyrle and his heir Vandrewort Kyrle. But this was far from satisfactory for the Wye tourists, who demanded something more impressive. This was satisfied in 1776 with the erection of a pyramidical tablet in variegated marble with a bust in relief, paid for by the will of Lady Constantia Dupplin.<br>
<br>Kyrle's landscaping continued to be admired, although Heath referred to vandalism caused by &#145;idle people&#146; in 1799. Few agreed with William Gilpin, who found the walks &#145;amusing&#146; but decided, according to his strict criteria, the view was &#145;not picturesque&#146;  (Gilpin, 14). Several prints of the period show the elms, burgeoning woods, and summerhouse, which terminated the walk, but the tourists wanted more, and Kyrle's own garden behind his house, now the King's Arms, became a place of pilgrimage.<br>
<br>Public access to the Prospect continued until 1837, when the landlord of the newly built Royal Hotel annexed the walks, demolished one of the gates, and planted part of the area with cabbages. This event became a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> in Ross in the 1840s and a riot occurred in 1848. Eventually, about 1860, the lease was recovered and the Prospect was given in perpetuity to the inhabitants of the town. In the nineteenth century another generation of pious philanthropists rediscovered Kyrle, and the story of his life was often repeated in campaigning magazines such as <span class="italic">The Sketch</span> and the <span class="italic">Saturday Magazine</span>. In 1877 the Kyrle Society was founded by Miranda and Octavia Hill to promote gardening among the industrious classes.<br>
