<span class="headword">Thomas,  Thomas</span>  (1553&#150;1588), <span class="occ">printer and lexicographer</span>, was born, according to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, in the city of London on 25 December 1553, the son of Thomas Thomas, &#145;gentleman&#146;. He was educated at Eton College between 1565 and 1571, and on 24 August 1571 entered King's College, Cambridge, as a scholar. Three years later, in accordance with custom, he was elected a fellow. He graduated BA in 1575 and MA in 1579. Probably in 1581 he resigned his fellowship, and it seems that by March 1583 he had married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1610), widow of John Sheres (<i>d</i>. 1581), a wealthy local bookbinder for whom Thomas had acted as an executor. Their daughter, Joan (<i>b</i>. 1583), survived him; a son, John (<i>b</i>. 1585), died in infancy. At King's, Thomas's contemporaries had included Richard Day, son of the printer John Day, and it was perhaps through him that Thomas developed an interest in printing.<br>
<br>Thomas was appointed university printer on 3 May 1583. In autumn 1583, in a house in Regent Walk (the street that ran east&#150;west between the west front of the university church and the Schools) he established the first printing house in Cambridge since John Siberch had printed his last work there in the 1520s. Thomas's first book, probably never completed, was a part of Pliny's <span class="italic">Historia naturalis</span> (1583) intended for the use of university students: only a fragment of this survives, and there is no evidence that it was ever published. His press was established in the teeth of opposition from the London Stationers' Company, who saw him as a rival to their monopolies and who seized his press within a month of his appointment in an effort to prevent him. It was regained only after the intervention of Lord Burghley, chancellor of the university. Thomas's (and the university's) claim to the right to print rested on letters patent granted to the university in 1534 by Henry VIII enabling the university to print <i>omnimodi libri</i>; though repeatedly challenged in courts of law these letters patent were upheld in succeeding generations.<br>
<br>Thomas was known for his puritan views, and was referred to in one of the Martin Marprelate tracts as &#145;that puritan Cambridge printer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oh Read Over D. John Bridges, for it is a Worthy Worke</span>, 1588, 6). He concentrated his printing and publishing on two principal areas: educational texts primarily for the local market, and protestant theology. One of his first works was an edition of Ramus's <span class="italic">Dialectica</span> by William Temple (1584); in 1585 he printed a translation of Ramus's Latin grammar; and in 1587 Plato's <span class="italic">Menexenus</span> in Greek. In theology, his tastes were for the Heidelberg reformers, but his major author and staunch supporter was William Whitaker, regius professor at Cambridge.<br>
<br>Thomas printed his own selection of Ovid for the use of students in 1584, and had presumably been working at this for a while before he resigned his college fellowship. In 1587 he published the first edition of his Latin dictionary, dedicated to Lord Burghley and based on the work of Guillaume Morel and Thomas Cooper. By 1631 Thomas's dictionary had passed through thirteen editions as the standard intermediate dictionary of its time. He continued the binding business inherited through his wife, though there is no evidence that he was himself a binder. Thomas died in Cambridge early in August 1588, and was buried on the 9th in Great St Mary's. His widow inherited the business, and on 6 February 1589 his stepdaughter Alice married John Legate, a printer from London who thus succeeded to his business and equipment. Thomas's will dated 28 July 1588 and proved on 12 October 1588 left his property mostly to his wife and daughter. The post-mortem inventory, with a detailed record of his equipment and stock-in-trade, reveals that he owned a single press, and about 2700 lb of type, with other materials: his estate as a whole was valued at &pound;580.<br>
