<span class="headword">Somer,  Paul <span class="st"> [Pauwels]</span>  van</span> <span class="st"> [Paul Vansommer]</span>  (1577/8&#150;1621/2), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was probably born in Antwerp, perhaps the son of Lambert van Someren. In 1604 the artist and author Karel van Mander wrote about two brothers from Antwerp, Bernaert and Pauwels van Somer, who were at that time working as artists in Amsterdam. Bernaert, a portraitist who had spent some years in Italy, was married to the daughter of the painter Aert Mijtens. Pauwels, or Paul, was still a bachelor and &#145;excellent in all aspects of art, in invention as well as portraiture&#146;  (Mander, 1.458). Paul was recorded in Leiden in September 1612, when his age was given as thirty-four, and again in April 1614. In 1615 he passed through The Hague and in 1616 he was in Brussels where, according to J. de Maere and M. Wabbes, he was commissioned by the Brabant audit office to paint a portrait of the archdukes, Albert and Isabella. By December the same year he had settled in London. Although his working life in England was to last only five years, he seems to have been working for court patrons almost from the outset. His signed portrait of the lord chamberlain, <span class="italic">William Herbert, Third Earl of Pembroke</span> (Royal Collection), is dated 1617, and this or another similar portrait of Herbert by van Somer was engraved by Simon van de Passe  (Hind, 265). Also dated 1617 is van Somer's important full-length portrait of Queen Anne of Denmark (Royal Collection), which presumably postdates July of that year, when the classical gateway at Oatlands Palace, shown in the background, was completed. In this work he reinvented the queen's visual image in terms of the more advanced Netherlandish technique and with a complex iconographical programme.<br>
<br>The date 1618 is inscribed on van Somer's full-length portrait of James I (Royal Collection) with the royal regalia on a table at his side. This, like the image of the queen, offered a fresh presentation of the monarch, and various copies and versions of it survive. On his visit to London in 1618, the English agent in Brussels, William Trumbull, discussed the commission of some portraits with Edward Norgate, who acted as an intermediary for him with van Somer. Van Somer queried the measurements requested for these full-lengths, for which he said he was usually paid &pound;25 or &pound;30, and which appear to have been portraits of the king and the queen  (<span class="italic">Downshire MSS</span>, 447, 601). In July 1619 Lady Anne Clifford wrote that her five-year-old daughter Margaret &#145;began to sit to Mr Vansommer for her Picture&#146; at their residence in Kent, Knole  (<span class="italic">Diaries of Lady Anne Clifford</span>, 78&#150;9); on 30 August her husband, Richard, third earl of Dorset, &#145;sat much to have his picture drawn by Van somer, &amp; one picture was drawn for me&#146;  (ibid.). None of these pictures is known to survive. In the same year van Somer signed the paired canvases <span class="italic">Second Earl of Devonshire and his Son</span> and the <span class="italic">Countess of Devonshire and her Daughter</span> (both North Carolina Museum of Art, Raleigh), and in 1620 the head and shoulders portrait of <span class="italic">Thomas Windsor, Sixth Baron Windsor</span> (1591&#150;1642) (priv. coll.).<br>
<br>In March 1619 van Somer attended Anne of Denmark's funeral as her &#145;picture maker&#146;, and his documented portrait of her former attendant Elizabeth Talbot, countess of Kent (Tate collection), attired in black, was probably painted about this time. The eighteenth-century engraver and writer George Vertue recorded seeing van Somer's signed and dated portrait of Robert Kerr, earl of Ancram of 1619, now lost. Van Somer was also documented as working for the earl of Rutland, and between 1619 and 1621 there are records of official payments to him for images of James I, Anne of Denmark, Prince Charles, and a posthumous copy of a portrait of Prince Henry. These include a warrant issued on 4 February 1620 for a payment of &pound;170 to him for pictures made for &#145;the late Queen&#146;.<br>
<br>In London, van Somer lived in St Martin's Lane, as did two other Netherlandish painters employed by the Jacobean court, Daniel Mytens (his kinsman, through his brother's marriage) and Abraham van Blyenberch. James I's Swiss physician, Dr Turquet de Mayerne, who was deeply interested in artists' materials and techniques, questioned all three of them. The opening page of his manuscript &#145;Pictorja sculptorja &amp; quae subalternarum artium&#146;  (BL, Sloane MS 2052) is dated 1620, and names van Somer as one of his initial sources. Van Somer told de Mayerne about the handling of various blue pigments, the properties of lavender and other oils, how to make a drying oil (by bleaching it in the spring sunshine), and how to create an &#145;incomparable varnish&#146;. A recently rediscovered portrait of Dr Mayerne in classical attire (NPG) has been attributed by Karen Hearn to van Somer.<br>
<br>Van Somer was buried in St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 5 January 1622. Payments for his last royal portraits were subsequently made to his widow, Cornelia. A portrait of van Somer was engraved by Simon van de Passe in 1622  (Hind, pl. 160b).<br>
<br>Eighteenth- and nineteenth-century connoisseurs, particularly Vertue, tended to attribute to van Somer almost any early seventeenth-century English portrait that contained Netherlandish elements, especially if full-length. As a result, his name continues to be linked to works by other, now unidentified, hands. In reality, the short duration of his career in England means that his <i>&#339;uvre</i> there must necessarily have been fairly small. No work painted by van Somer prior to his arrival in London has yet been identified.<br>
