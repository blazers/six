<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Everett,  Kenny</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Maurice James Christopher Cole]</span>  (1944&#150;1995), <span class="occ">broadcaster and comedian</span>, was born on 25 December 1944 at 14 Hereford Road, Seaforth, Liverpool, the son of Thomas Cole, Mersey tugboat mate and later tugboat captain, and his wife, Elizabeth Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Haugh. He was educated at St Bede's secondary modern school, Liverpool. While growing up he was inspired by radio comedy, especially wacky programmes such as <span class="italic">The Goon Show</span>, and developed a talent for mimicry. On leaving school he worked in a bakery, where he cleaned sausage-roll trays for three months, before joining an advertising agency and, two years later, moving on to the advertisement department of a shipping publication, the <span class="italic">Journal of Commerce</span>. Longing to break into radio, he bought two tape recorders and started to make his own programmes of music and comic monologues, drawing on the style of BBC Light Programme host John Jackson, who skilfully edited clips from comedy albums. After he sent a tape to the BBC &#145;The Maurice Cole Quarter of an Hour Show&#146; was broadcast on the Home Service programme <span class="italic">Midweek</span>, with the young hopeful being interviewed by its presenter, Ronald Fletcher. However, Cole failed to impress producer Derek Chinnery at a subsequent audition, and he returned to Liverpool. Hoping that the independent pirate stations might be more sympathetic to his irreverent style, he sent the same tape to the original Radio London and was immediately taken on as a disc jockey, at &pound;15 a week. Radio Luxemburg and offshore pirates such as Radio Caroline and Radio London were giving young people who had grown up since the Second World War the pop music they wanted, in sharp contrast to the BBC's stuffier approach.<br>
<br>Like other pirate radio disc jockeys at Radio London such as Ed Stewart, Dave Cash, and Pete Brady, who all later joined BBC Radio 1, Cole had to change his name for legal reasons. As a result he became Kenny Everett, after an American film comedy star named Edward Everett Horton, and began a controversial broadcasting career that combined inventive brilliance with unremitting disrespect, which frequently landed him in trouble. His time at Radio London was short as a result of his sacking for criticizing the sponsor of the station's evangelist programme, <span class="italic">The World Tomorrow</span>. However, after a short time at Radio Luxemburg, he once again sought to work for the BBC, at a time when it was planning the launch of Radio 1, Britain's first land-based pop station, and the government was outlawing the pirates through the <span class="roman">Marine Offences Act</span>. In May 1967 he was heard reviewing the Beatles' classic album <span class="italic">Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</span> for the BBC's Light Programme, which four months later was turned into the new Radio 1 and Radio 2. Everett, who along with other former pirate disc jockeys joined Radio 1, presented the Wednesday edition of <span class="italic">Midday Spin</span> before hosting his own Sunday-morning show, and in 1968 landed a 45 minute weekday evening programme, <span class="italic">Foreverett</span>. When that finished after five months, he presented a Saturday-morning programme. However, he upset his bosses again when in 1970 he made a quip about the transport minister John Peyton's wife, Mary, who had just passed her driving test&#151;&#145;probably slipping the examiner a fiver&#146;, he jested. He was sacked but two years later was asked to return to the BBC to present a Saturday-morning show for Radio 1, which was safely recorded at his studio in Wales the previous day, ensuring that nothing offensive would slip into the programme. In 1969 he married Lee Middleton, with whom he co-authored <span class="italic">The Lee and Kenny Everett Cookery Book</span> (1976). There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Everett was let out of the BBC's straitjacket when he joined Capital Radio in London, which started broadcasting as the first independent pop music station in Britain, in October 1973. He landed the plum job of presenting the breakfast show and revived his Radio London partnership of the 1960s with Dave Cash by teaming up with him again in <span class="italic">The Kenny and Cash Show</span>, an early treat for listeners to the new commercial station. Eighteen months after joining Capital he took an overdose of Mandrax, which he used as a sleeping pill, although he admitted in his autobiography, <span class="italic">The Custard Stops at Hatfield</span> (1982), that he had been taking drugs and drinking since the 1960s. He moved to weekend shows on Capital until his departure from the station in 1980. During his time there he created the serial <span class="italic">Captain Kremmen</span>, whose hero waged intergalactic battles with the man-eating Krells. This space cowboy was inspired by Everett's childhood memories of comic-book superheroes such as Dan Dare and Flash Gordon.<br>
<br>Everett's next step was into television. He had previously co-presented the 1968 series <span class="italic">Nice Time</span> with Jonathan Routh and Germaine Greer and hosted his own programme, <span class="italic">The Kenny Everett Explosion</span>, in 1970, as well as being the voice behind the prizes in Bob Monkhouse's noughts-and-crosses game show, <span class="italic">Celebrity Squares</span>. But he made his biggest impression to date in <span class="italic">The Kenny Everett Video Show</span> (1978&#150;80) on ITV, featuring electronic trickery and madcap sketches in which he unleashed such characters as leather-clad biker Sid Snot and fastidious hair stylist Marcel Wave, as well as a cartoon-strip serial of Captain Kremmen. They were accompanied by Arlene Phillips's scantily clad, raunchy dance troupe Hot Gossip, and the buxom Miss Whiplash, played by Cleo Rocos. The programme won international awards and Everett's voice helped another television game show to success, with the launch in 1979 of <span class="italic">Blankety Blank</span>, hosted by Terry Wogan. After another ITV show, <span class="italic">The Kenny Everett Video Cassette</span> (1981), the zany star switched channels to the BBC for <span class="italic">The Kenny Everett Television Show</span>, subsequently retitled <span class="italic">The Kenny Everett Show</span> (1982&#150;8). Although the programme lost the bite of the original ITV series&#151;the equivalent of switching from Radio 1 to Radio 2&#151;Everett still attracted audiences of up to 15 million with a repertoire of characters that now included the skinhead yob Gizzard Puke, Beau D'Iddley of the foreign legion, and drag starlet Cupid Stunt, complete with latex boobs. Everett insisted throughout that it was &#145;all done in the best possible taste&#146;, a line from the mouth of Cupid, who would cross her legs with a total lack of discretion. Another new creation in the BBC series was the &#145;Bee Gees&#146;, with Everett playing all three pop star brothers as well as the interviewer asking them questions, which were answered with lines from their songs: &#145;How do you sell so many records?&#146;&#151;&#145;Because we're living in a world of fools&#146;.<br>
<br>Lending his support to the Conservative Party during the 1983 British general election campaign, Everett caused uproar with his call of &#145;Let's bomb Russia!&#146; as he took to the stage at a Young Conservatives' rally. This error of judgement, followed by a threat to kick away Labour Party leader Michael Foot's walking stick, led to widespread criticism and his own vow to keep out of politics in future. One new experience for him was acting in a feature film, playing a tin-legged, schizoid scientist investigating a sinister manor house in the spoof horror picture <span class="italic">Blood Bath at the House of Death</span> (1983). When Everett's television series finally finished, his screen profile diminished, although he hosted the science-based quiz <span class="italic">Brainstorm</span> (1988) and the daytime quiz show <span class="italic">Gibberish</span>. By then he had once more returned to and left BBC radio. Presenting a Radio 2 show, he was again sacked in 1984, this time for telling an offensive joke about the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. Four years later he experienced another revival when he joined the newly launched Capital Gold, playing classic pop hits on the London station that also hired former Radio 1 disc jockeys Tony Blackburn and David Hamilton. Everett savoured his six years with the station and enjoyed his longest run in a daily radio show. In 1991 he also took to the West End stage as the Billiard Marker in composer Mike Batt's short-lived musical <span class="italic">The Hunting of the Snark</span>, based on Lewis Carroll's nonsense poem and performed at the Prince Edward Theatre. In 1994 Everett's contribution to broadcasting was recognized with a gold award from the Sony Radio Awards judges, who noted that his comic talent and wacky style had &#145;consistently bewitched audiences&#146;.<br>
<br>Everett left Capital in 1994 after being diagnosed with AIDS, having known that he was HIV-positive since 1989. His marriage to Lee Middleton was dissolved in 1984 and he subsequently lived with a former Soviet Red Army soldier, Nikolay Grishanovich, who died of AIDS in 1991. Everett died of AIDS-related bronchopneumonia on 4 April 1995 at his home, 91 Lexham Gardens, Kensington, London, and was cremated following a funeral service at the church of the Immaculate Conception, Mayfair, on 10 April.<br>
