<span class="headword">Simpson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Spearing]</span>,  Evelyn Mary</span>  (1885&#150;1963), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was born on 2 September 1885 at 2 Park Terrace, Cambridge, the daughter of James Spearing, solicitor, and his wife, Fanny Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clayton. She was educated at the Perse School, Cambridge, where she was remembered as one &#145;whose learning already created awe in those around her&#146;  (<span class="italic">Newnham College Roll Letter</span>, 1964), and at Newnham College, Cambridge (1905&#150;9), gaining a first in medieval and modern languages in 1908. After teaching at Bedford College, London University (1909&#150;11), in 1911 she became a fellow of Newnham, the title &#145;fellow&#146; being associated at Newnham at that time specifically with research.<br>
<br>In 1912 Spearing published <span class="italic">The Elizabethan Translations of Seneca's Tragedies</span> and her work on <span class="italic">Studley's Translations of Seneca's Agamemnon and Medea</span> appeared in Louvain in 1913. She interrupted her research on Elizabethan drama&#151;the second volume of her endeavours was lost when the Louvain University Press was destroyed&#151;to work as a nurse, first during 1914&#150;15 at a Red Cross hospital in Cambridge for wounded Belgian soldiers and subsequently, from the autumn of 1915, at military hospitals in France. In 1917&#150;18 she worked as a general service superintendent at Eaton Hall Military Hospital, Chester.<br>
<br>It was an act of considerable courage for a pioneering woman university teacher and scholar to interrupt an academic career in Cambridge to work as a Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) nurse in the difficult conditions prevailing in France in 1915. In her account of her experiences, <span class="italic">From Cambridge to Camiers under the Red Cross</span>, published in 1917, Evelyn Spearing shows a profound and tender compassion for the ordinary wounded combatants in her care. In 1918 she was mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>Spearing was appointed tutor in English literature at St Hugh's College, Oxford, in 1919. On 16 August 1921 she married the English scholar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36105/', "Percy Simpson (1865&#150;1962)")</script>, fellow of Oriel College from 1921 to 1936 and latterly Goldsmiths' reader in English at Oxford University. The following year she became the first woman to be awarded the DPhil degree at Oxford and in 1924 she published a study of the prose works of John Donne based on her doctoral thesis. Her marriage, however, marked the end of her tutorship at St Hugh's but the beginning of a long-standing editorial collaboration, described as &#145;one of the most remarkable partnerships in the history of scholarship&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12 Sept 1963). Percy Simpson was some twenty years older than his wife and for many years had been engaged, with C. H. Herford (1853&#150;1931), on the Oxford edition of Jonson's works, the first two volumes of which were to appear in 1925. Following Herford's death Evelyn Simpson worked with her husband on the remaining volumes of text and accompanying commentary, the whole edition of eleven volumes being completed in 1952. The Jonson edition stands as a lasting monument to the Simpsons' meticulous research and editorial skills; it &#145;remains one of the great editions of its age. Its commentary is a masterpiece of wide, profound, and exact scholarship&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>While the great work on Jonson was nearing completion, Evelyn Simpson's work on Donne's sermons, commissioned by the University of California at Berkeley, though it had been interrupted by research for the Jonson edition, was also taking shape, the first volume appearing in 1953. She too suffered the loss of a co-editor with the death of George Reuben Potter (1895&#150;1954) and continued as sole editor, completing the ten-volume work in some nine years.<br>
<br>Evelyn and Percy Simpson had two children: a son, Edward Spearing Simpson (<i>b</i>. 1923), who died in an accident on Mont Blanc in 1953, and a daughter, Mary, born in 1924. Percy Simpson died at the age of ninety-seven in 1962, and Evelyn's death followed less than a year later; she died, of heart failure following pneumonia, at Sun Court Nursing Home, Sheringham, Norfolk, on 7 September 1963, aged seventy-eight, and was buried at Old Headington cemetery, Oxford.<br>
