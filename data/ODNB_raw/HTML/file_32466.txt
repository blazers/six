<span class="headword">Cobb,  Gerard Francis</span>  (1838&#150;1904), <span class="occ">composer and writer</span>, was born at Nettlestead, Kent, on 15 October 1838, the younger son of William Francis Cobb, rector of Nettlestead, and his wife, Mary Blackburn. Educated at Marlborough College from 1849 to 1857, he matriculated in 1857 from Trinity College, Cambridge, where he won a scholarship in 1860. He graduated BA in 1861 with first-class honours in both the classical and the moral science tripos. Having been interested in music from an early age, Cobb then went to Dresden for a short time to study music. He was elected a fellow of Trinity in 1863, took his MA the next year, and in 1869 was appointed junior bursar, a post which he held with some success for twenty-five years.<br>
<br>In sympathy with the Tractarian movement, Cobb at one time contemplated, but finally declined, holy orders. He actively advocated reunion between the Roman and Anglican churches, and in 1867 published an elaborate treatise, <span class="italic">The Kiss of Peace, or, England and Rome at one on the Doctrine of the Holy Eucharist</span>. Two short tracts, <span class="italic">A Few Words on Reunion</span> and <span class="italic">Separation not Schism</span>, appeared in 1869.<br>
<br>Cobb was president of the Cambridge University Musical Society from 1874 to 1883, and as chairman of the University Board of Musical Studies from 1877 to 1892 gave Sir George Macfarren valuable help in the reform of that faculty. He married Elizabeth Lucy, daughter of John Welchman Whateley of Birmingham, and widow of Stephen Parkinson, tutor of St John's College, Cambridge, in 1893, and resigned his offices at Trinity College (although he continued to reside in Cambridge) to devote himself mainly to musical composition and the encouragement of musical study, which had already engaged much of his interest. He was a prolific composer of songs, and wrote much church music, including a setting of <span class="roman">Psalm 42</span> for the festival of the North Eastern Choir Association at Ripon Cathedral in 1892, seven services (including the morning, communion, and evening service in C major for men's voices, commissioned by St George's Chapel, Windsor), and anthems. His most ambitious work was <span class="italic">A Song of Trafalgar</span>, a ballad for chorus and orchestra, op. 41 (1900), though his most popular compositions were settings of twenty of Rudyard Kipling's <span class="italic">Barrack-Room Ballads</span> (1892&#150;7), which were published collectively in 1904, and the songs &#145;The Last Salute&#146; (1897), &#145;Love among the Roses&#146;, and &#145;A Spanish Lament&#146; (1886). He also published a piano quintet in C, op. 22 (1892), and a piano quartet (1898).<br>
<br>Cobb was an enthusiastic cyclist, and was the first president of the National Cyclists' Union (originally the Bicycle Union) in 1878 and president of the Cambridge University cycling club. For the International Health Exhibition in 1884 he contributed a chapter on cycling to the handbook on athletics. He was active in the municipal life of Cambridge, and addressed to the district council in 1878 a pamphlet on road paving, in which he urged improvement of the roads.<br>
<br>Cobb died at his home, The Hermitage, Newnham, Cambridgeshire, on 31 March 1904, and was cremated at Woking. He was survived by his wife.<br>
