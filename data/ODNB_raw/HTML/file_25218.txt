<span class="headword">Sharp,  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1709, <em>d.</em> 1778), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, son of Henry Sharp, brazier, and his wife, Hannah <i>n&eacute;e</i> Puller of London, was baptized at St Peter's, Cornhill, London, on 17 June 1709. The fortunate apprentice of William Cheselden, senior surgeon at St Thomas's Hospital, he was indentured in 1724 for a fee of &pound;300 paid by Elizabeth Sale, a widowed aunt living at Hertford. Her father, Sharp's maternal grandfather, was Isaac Puller MP, a former mayor of Hertford. Nothing is known of Sharp's early schooling. During his apprenticeship he met S.-F. Morand, a French surgeon dispatched to study Cheselden's lithotomy technique, and in 1729 or 1730 he became Morand's pupil in Paris. In 1732 he obtained the diploma of the Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company and in 1733 he was elected surgeon to Guy's Hospital. In the same year Cheselden published his monumental <span class="italic">Osteographia, or, The Anatomy of the Bones</span>, towards which Sharp assisted; a vignette on the title-page shows Cheselden drawing with two apprentices said to be John Belchier and Sharp; no other certain likeness is known. Sharp rapidly acquired an extensive practice, and in 1739 published <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Operations of Surgery</span>, illustrated with fourteen plates of instruments; it was the first monograph in English on the subject and achieved eleven editions, and translations into French, Portuguese, Dutch, Spanish, and Italian. In July 1740 Sharp married Eleanor Baynes of Hatton Garden, daughter of Richard Baynes, alderman of York; they had three daughters and a son who took the name Samuel Sharpe Pocklington on marriage.<br>
<br>In 1746 Sharp relinquished to William Hunter the &#145;course of anatomical lectures, to which were added the operations of surgery, with the application of bandages&#146;, delivered in Covent Garden on winter afternoons to naval surgeons. In 1749 Sharp became a fellow of the Royal Society of London and on a second visit to Paris was elected a foreign member of the Royal Academy of Surgery. Two papers in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> concerned cataract extraction and in 1751 he couched the composer G. F. Handel, being as unsuccessful as two later practitioners. In 1750 he published <span class="italic">A Critical Enquiry into the Present State of Surgery</span>, which achieved four editions, and translations into French, Dutch, Spanish, German, and Italian. This influential work focused on controversial surgical issues including hernia, cerebral concussion, lithotomy, tonsillectomy, and amputation.<br>
<br>Sharp resigned from Guy's Hospital in 1757 on the grounds of ill health, probably asthma, but he continued in private practice until 1765, when he set out on a winter tour through Italy. The results were published in his forthright <span class="italic">Letters from Italy</span>, of 1766; these included an account of a visit to Geneva to see Voltaire again, Sharp having met him previously in London and Paris. Of his letters, Dr Johnson thought &#145;there was a great deal of matter in them&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 755). The publication of a second edition in 1767 produced Giuseppe Baretti's <span class="italic">Account of the Manners and Customs of Italy</span>, an acrid criticism of Sharp's views. It was answered by Sharp in <span class="italic">A view of the customs, manners, drama, &amp;c., of Italy, as they are described in the &#145;Frusta litteraria&#146;</span>, of Baretti in which, happily for Sharp, were recorded similar censures to the <span class="italic">Letters from Italy</span>.<br>
<br>Sharp proved an innovative surgical practitioner and communicator as the many editions of his books in seven European languages indicate. Nineteenth-century surgeons admired his forthrightness and skills. Louis B&eacute;gin, a French practitioner, assessed Sharp in 1825 as<blockquote>one of those surgeons whose works show in the highest degree the impress of an observing mind, hostile to all authority and routine. There are few diseases on which he did not put forward new ideas, few operations whose instruments or procedures he did not improve. His writings contain many things in few pages, and we find in them both an originality and an independence of thought which charm the reader and always secure his attention. (Kirkup, 1)</blockquote>James Paget said he<blockquote>was a thoroughly informed surgeon, well read, observant, judicious, a lover of simplicity, wisely doubtful. I think, too, he must have been an eminently safe man, who might be relied on for knowing or doing whatever, in his time, could be known or done for the good of his patients. (Paget, 53)</blockquote>In England Sharp was the immediate link between Cheselden and both Percivall Pott and John Hunter. Sharp cultivated anatomical and operative precision, introducing numerous improvements in techniques and instruments. In place of the usual chair for amputation, he advised a table and specified the table's height, both for this and for herniotomy and lithotomy. He promoted the cylindrical, as opposed to the conical, cranial trephine saw and modified its controlling handle; he designed a cataract knife and made cogent observations on the manufacture of scalpels and suture needles. Indeed, in the reconstruction of surgical perceptions of this period, Samuel Sharp's contributions remain unique and invaluable sources.<br>
<br>In 1766 Sharp retired to Bath, where he died at his home in the Circus on 24 March 1778 after a lingering illness; he was buried in Bath Abbey.<br>
