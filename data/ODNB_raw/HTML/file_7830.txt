<span class="headword">Dorin,  Joseph Alexander</span>  (1802&#150;1872), <span class="occ">East India Company servant</span>, born at Edmonton, Middlesex, on 15 September 1802, was the son of Joseph Dorin, merchant, and his wife, Charlotte. He was educated at Henley School, and obtained a nomination to the Bengal branch of the East India Company's service, of which his elder brother William was already a member. At East India College, Haileybury, he was first prizeman of his year, and on his arrival in India in 1821 was made assistant to the accountant-general. During the whole of his career he was attached to the financial branch. On 12 April 1823 he married Anna Patton (1806&#150;1863) in St John's Cathedral, Calcutta; they had two sons, Henry and James.<br>
<br>On his return from furlough in 1842 Dorin was entrusted by Lord Ellenborough, the governor-general, with the reorganization of Indian finance. He became the first financial secretary under the new arrangements in 1843. Praised by the authorities for his handling of the finances during the Anglo-Sikh wars, in 1851 he became one of the four members of Lord Dalhousie's council, in effect the executive of the government of India. He is credited with effecting a reduction in the rate of interest on the Indian debt, but in 1855 miscalculations of revenue and expenditures made it necessary to contract a new loan at the old rate. This occasioned a severe fall in Indian securities, and the government was harshly criticized.<br>
<br>While Dorin was a member of the executive council, two momentous events took place, the annexation of the kingdom of Oudh and the great uprising in north India known as the Indian mutiny. As senior member, Dorin attracted both praise and blame for decisions taken by the government in the two events. The widely circulated &#145;Red pamphlet&#146; on the uprising of 1857, by G. B. Malleson, described him as utterly deficient in knowledge of India, and claimed that nowhere but in British India would he have had anything other than the most subordinate position. He was defended by another writer who argued that, while it was true that in his thirty years in India he had never been more than 16 miles from Calcutta, he was in constant touch with other officials who did know India. In regard to Oudh, its king had signed a treaty in 1837 giving the government of India the right to intervene if it considered his rule oppressive. The treaty had never been ratified by London, but Dorin argued that the king of Oudh need not be told this, for the government had the right to do what it felt was good for the country, which in this case was annexation and ending the kingdom's existence. There is some indication that Dalhousie did not wholly accept this reasoning, but it was Dorin's views that were finally accepted by the East India Company directors. In regard to the uprising, as a member of the supreme council, Dorin, like Dalhousie, at first did not believe the reports of widespread unrest in the army and among elements in the general population. In the end, however, even before the news of the decisive army mutiny on 12 May at Meerut reached Calcutta, he proposed such harsh punishment for mutinous soldiers that all the other members of the council dissented. During this time Dorin supported the governor-general in two very unpopular measures: one was the severe press censorship known as the <span class="roman">Gagging Acts</span>, and the other a bill prohibiting Indians from owning arms.<br>
<br>Dorin remained a member of the supreme council until 1858. On his return to England he was proposed for membership of the Council of India, the advisory group to the secretary of state for India, but he was not appointed. He spent the rest of his life in retirement, but under somewhat peculiar circumstances. When he returned to India in 1842 he had left his wife in Chepstow because of her ill health, but during much of the rest of his service in Calcutta, he had a companion, a widow, Margaret Christiana Twentyman, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kelly (<i>b</i>. 1831), who returned with him to England when he retired. She lived with him in London as Mrs Dorington, with their two sons, Charles and William Dorington. After the death in 1863 of his first wife&#151;whom he had apparently continued to visit&#151;he married Margaret Christiana in 1864. He died at Place Street, St Lawrence Dene, Isle of Wight, on 22 December 1872, and was buried in the churchyard at St Rhadagund's, St Lawrence. His attempts to provide for his illegitimate sons in his will were overturned after a series of bitter lawsuits brought by the only surviving child of Dorin's elder legitimate son. The case of <i>Dorin v. Dorin</i> and others was a leading case in civil law until the <span class="roman">Legitimacy Act</span> of 1925.<br>
<br>The judgement made of Dorin by the historian Sir John Kaye, that he held high office under successive governors-general because he agreed with them, &#145;which saved trouble and gained favour&#146;, is perhaps not too far from the mark, but while he was not one of the famed &#145;Rulers of India&#146;, he was representative of those who, possessing only average abilities and no great knowledge of India, held the fabric of the British empire in India together.<br>
