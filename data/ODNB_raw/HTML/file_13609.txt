<span class="headword">Holt,  Francis Ludlow</span>  (1779&#150;1844), <span class="occ">legal writer</span>, was born at Watford, Hertfordshire, the son of the Revd Ludlow Holt, author of some sermons published in 1780&#150;81, and his wife, Jane. He was elected a king's scholar of Westminster School in 1794, matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1798, and was admitted to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1807. He did not graduate at either university. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple on 27 January 1809. In the early part of his professional career he went on the northern circuit, but after a few years he resigned the circuit practice altogether, confining himself thereafter to an extensive chamber practice. He became a king's counsel (on Henry Brougham's recommendation) and bencher of the Inner Temple in 1831, and treasurer of that inn in 1840. He was for some time an exchequer-bill loan commissioner. He succeeded Sir Giffin Wilson as vice-chancellor of the county palatine of Lancaster in 1826 and held the post until his death. He married a niece of John Bell, proprietor of <span class="italic">Bell's Weekly Messenger</span>, of which he was for many years the principal editor.<br>
<br>Holt was the author of several law treatises and also produced a set of <i>nisi prius</i> reports between 1815 and 1817. He was the author of <span class="italic">The Law of Libel</span>, one of the first treatises on its subject, written at a time when the libel laws were under much criticism for hindering the freedom of the press. His work merely summarized the existing law in a superficial way, however, and was seen by critics of the law, such as James Mill, as work of a tory lawyer. It was largely superseded by that of Thomas Starkie. His other main treatise was <span class="italic">A System of the Shipping and Navigation Laws of Great Britain</span>, published in 1820. Although it was comprehensive and well-written, it was superseded by the work of Charles Abbott, later Lord Tenterden. He also wrote a treatise on the bankruptcy laws, and on <span class="italic">The Law and Usage of Parliament, in Cases of Privilege and Contempt</span> (1810). In addition to his legal writings Holt wrote some plays, publishing in 1804 a comedy, <span class="italic">The Land We Live In</span>. Though successful as a literary work (reaching a third edition by 1805), it was unsuitable to the stage, the author having sacrificed plot to dialogue; it was performed at Drury Lane on one night in 1805. Holt died at his residence, 13 Earl's Terrace, Kensington, on 29 September 1844.<br>
