<span class="headword">Maude,  Thomas</span>  (1718&#150;1798), <span class="occ">poet and essayist</span>, was born in Downing Street, London, in May 1718; he retained this family property and lived in it during visits to the capital throughout his life. A member of an established Yorkshire family, he may be the Thomas Maude, son of Edmund Maude, who was baptized at Otley, Yorkshire, on 8 May 1718. Maude entered the medical profession and in 1755 was appointed naval surgeon on board the <i>Barfleur</i>. During this time he made the acquaintance of another surgeon&#150;writer, Edward Ives. Maude performed duties in the squadron of Admiral John Byng, executed for neglect of duty in 1757. In 1765 Maude took up the position of steward of the Yorkshire estates of Harry Powlett, sixth duke of Bolton; Maude had given evidence for the duke when, as a young naval officer in 1755, he had been court-martialled.<br>
<br>Maude combined his responsibilities with a career as a poet, achieving local and some metropolitan fame. His best-known poem was <span class="italic">Wensleydale</span> (1772), a celebration of the picturesqueness of that particular Yorkshire dale; by 1816 the poem had reached a fourth edition. Maude's other long poems were in a similar vein: in conscious repetition, the subject matter of <span class="italic">Verbeia</span> (1782) was Wharfedale and <span class="italic">Viator</span> (1782) offered a description of a journey from London to Scarborough by way of York. Maude's poetry enabled him to demonstrate his fondness for the Yorkshire dales and his historical and topographical knowledge, but it was conventional and unmemorable. His last collection of verse was <span class="italic">The Invitation</span> (1791), although he later published a volume of essays, <span class="italic">The Reaper</span> (1797).<br>
<br>An amiable man, Maude formed friendships with other scholarly figures of the day, including the mathematician George Gargrave, and William Paley who often visited Maude at the duke's seat, Bolton Hall, in Wensley. After the death of the duke (whom inevitably Maude had eulogized in private verses), Maude moved to his own property, Burley Hall, near Otley. Maude married Cordelia Charlton at St Mary Magdalen, Old Fish Street, London, on 6 August 1746; they had a son and two daughters. He died at his home in December 1798 and was buried in Wensley churchyard in January 1799. Lines from Goldsmith's <span class="italic">Deserted Village</span> were inscribed on his tomb.<br>
