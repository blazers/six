<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pratt,  Josiah</span>  (1768&#150;1844), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, second son of Josiah Pratt, a Birmingham manufacturer, was born at Birmingham on 21 December 1768. His parents were pious evangelicals. With his two younger brothers, Isaac and Henry, Josiah was educated at Barr House School, 6 miles from Birmingham. When he was twelve years old his father took him into his business, but his religious impressions deepened, and at the age of seventeen he obtained his father's permission to enter holy orders. After some private tuition, he matriculated on 28 June 1789 from St Edmund Hall, Oxford, at that time the only stronghold of evangelicalism at the university. His college tutor was Isaac Crouch, a leading evangelical, with whom he formed a lifelong friendship. He graduated BA and was ordained deacon in 1792, and became assistant curate to William Jesse, rector of Dowles, near Bewdley on the borders of Shropshire and Worcestershire. He remained at Dowles until 1795, when, on receiving priest's orders, he became assistant minister under Richard Cecil, the evangelical minister of St John's Chapel, Bedford Row, London.<br>
<br>On 7 September 1797 Pratt married Elizabeth, eldest daughter of John Jowett of Newington, and settled in London, at 22 Doughty Street. There he received pupils, among them being Daniel Wilson, afterwards bishop of Calcutta, with whom he maintained a close friendship. In 1799, at a meeting of the Eclectic Society, which met in the vestry of St John's Chapel, he argued that a periodical publication would signally serve the interests of religion. A pilot edition, the first number of the <span class="italic">Christian Observer</span>, appeared in January 1802 under his editorship. In about six weeks he resigned the editorship to Zachary Macaulay.<br>
<br>Pratt had also taken part in those meetings of the Eclectic (18 March and 12 April 1799) at which the Church Missionary Society was formulated. On 8 December 1802 he was elected secretary of the missionary society in succession to Thomas Scott. He filled the office, which became the chief occupation of his life, for more than twenty-one years, and displayed a rare tact and business capacity in the performance of his duties. From 1813 to 1815 he travelled through England, successfully pleading the cause of the society. He also took a leading part in the establishment in London of the seminary at Islington for the training of missionaries, which was projected in 1822 and opened by him in 1825. At last, on 23 April 1824, he resigned his arduous post to Edward Bickersteth, the assistant secretary. Bickersteth was also an evangelical, and Pratt believed that the society should be kept in evangelical hands. Pratt devised, and for some time conducted, the <span class="italic">Missionary Register</span>, of which the first number appeared in January 1813.<br>
<br>Pratt likewise helped to form the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1804; he was one of the original committee, and was its first Church of England secretary, but he soon retired in favour of John Owen (1766&#150;1822). In 1811 he was elected a life-governor, and in 1812 he helped to frame the rules for the organization of auxiliary and branch societies, and of <span class="roman">Bible</span> associations.<br>
<br>In 1804 Pratt ceased to be assistant to Richard Cecil, and became a lecturer at St Mary Woolnoth, in Lombard Street. Here John Newton, another evangelical leader, whose health was failing, was rector. Next year he became Newton's regular assistant curate. In 1804 he also undertook two other lectureships: the evening lecture at Spitalfields church, and the Lady Campden lecture at St Lawrence Jewry. In 1810 he was made by Hastings Wheler, the proprietor, incumbent of the chapel of Sir George Wheler, or &#145;Wheler Chapel&#146;, in Spital Square, which had been shut up for some time. For sixteen years he enjoyed this humble preferment. He established in connection with it the Spitalfields Benevolent Society, and among his hearers were Samuel Hoare of Hampstead, friend of the Wordsworths, and Thomas Fowell Buxton. At Pratt's suggestion Buxton left the Society of Friends, and was baptized into the Church of England.<br>
<br>Pratt's interest in church affairs abroad was always keen. He worked actively in promoting an ecclesiastical establishment in India, stimulating Dr Claudius Buchanan to renew his efforts and urging the Church Missionary Society to give practical aid when Dr Thomas Fanshaw Middleton was appointed bishop of Calcutta. At a time when there was considerable controversy over the powers of bishops in relation to the Colonial Missionary Society, Pratt defended episcopacy even though, unlike some of his fellow evangelicals, he did not believe that it was absolutely necessary. In 1820 Pratt corresponded with two American bishops (Dr Griswold and Dr White), and warmly welcomed Dr Philander Chase, bishop of Ohio, on his visit to England; and it was largely through his efforts that an American missionary society was established. He similarly took the warmest interest in the mission of his brother-in-law, William Jowett (1787&#150;1855), to Malta and the Levant, and may be regarded as founder, in conjunction with Dr Buchanan, of the Malta mission.<br>
<br>In 1826, when Pratt was fifty-eight, he at last became a beneficed clergyman. The parishioners of St Stephen's, Coleman Street, who had the privilege of electing their own vicar, had chosen him as early as 1823. But legal difficulties had arisen, and were not overcome for three years. Pratt retained his lectureship at St Mary Woolnoth until 1831. He established various Christian and benevolent institutions in St Stephen's parish, showed his opposition to the Oxford Movement, and took part in the formation of the Church Pastoral Aid Society. To the last Pratt remained a prominent leader of the evangelicals. Alexander Knox described a meeting with him at Hannah More's, and called him &#145;a serious, well-bred, well-informed gentleman, an intimate friend of Mrs. More's and Mr. Wilberforce's&#146;. By the word &#145;serious&#146; Knox disclaims meaning &#145;disconsolate or gloomy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remains of Alexander Knox</span>, 4.68).<br>
<br>In spite of his many and varied occupations, Pratt found time for literary work. In 1797 he issued <span class="roman">A Prospectus, with Specimens, of a New Polyglot Bible for the Use of English Students</span>, a scheme for popularizing the labours of Brian Walton. The <span class="italic">British Critic</span> attacked him for presuming to trespass on that scholar's province. Pratt published his <span class="italic">Vindication</span>; but the scheme fell through. He edited the works of Bishop Hall (10 vols., 1808), of Bishop Hopkins (4 vols., 1809), Cecil's <span class="italic">Remains</span> (1810), and Cecil's <span class="italic">Works</span> (4 vols., 1811). He also published <span class="italic">A Collection of Psalms and Hymns</span>, 750 in number, for the use of his parishioners in public worship, of which no fewer than 52,000 copies were sold.<br>
<br>Pratt died in London on 10 October 1844, and was buried in &#145;the vicars' vault&#146; in the church of St Stephen, Coleman Street. He had two sons; Josiah was his successor at St Stephen's, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22704/', "John Henry Pratt")</script> became a chaplain to the East India Company.<br>
