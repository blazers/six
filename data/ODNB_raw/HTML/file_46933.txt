<span class="headword">Rose,  Herbert Jennings</span>  (1883&#150;1961), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born at Orillia, Ontario, Canada, on 5 May 1883, son of Revd Samuel Peter Rose DD (<i>b</i>. 1853), a Methodist minister, and his wife, Jean Andrews. He was educated first by private tuition, then at the Collegiate Institute, Ottawa, and at McGill University, Montreal, where he graduated with first-class honours in classics in 1904. Then, appointed from the province of Quebec as one of the first Rhodes scholars, he left Canada in 1904 to study at Balliol College, Oxford. Success there (Ireland and Craven scholar, 1905; chancellor's Latin essayist, 1907, and firsts in classical moderations and <i>literae humaniores</i>) led to his appointment at Exeter College as fellow and lecturer in 1907; he held these posts until 1911. In that year he married Elsie Plimsoll (<i>d</i>. 1939), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22384/', "Samuel Plimsoll MP")</script> (&#145;the sailors' friend&#146;), and the sister of a Balliol contemporary. They had four sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Rose returned to McGill University as associate professor of classics for four years (1911&#150;15); then served in the war with the Canadian overseas forces as a private in Princess Patricia's Canadian light infantry, 1915&#150;19. He was professor of Latin at Aberystwyth from 1919 to 1927, when he was appointed professor of Greek at the University of St Andrews. He remained at St Andrews until his retirement in 1953. He was honoured as FBA (1934), honorary fellow of Exeter College (1944), and honorary LLD, St Andrews (1954); he was appointed foreign member of the Royal Society of Letters, Lund, and of the Royal Netherlands Academy; he was invited to give the Sather lectures in California (1939) and the first Eitrem lectures in Oslo (1955). As a pioneer in the scholarly study of folklore, he became in 1932 president both of the Folklore Society and of the Scottish Anthropological Society.<br>
<br>Rose published a great deal. His greatest contribution to scholarship is perhaps his <span class="italic">Hygini fabulae</span> (1934); but he is best remembered for his <span class="italic">Handbook of Greek Mythology</span> (1928). Among other works were handbooks of Greek literature (1934) and Latin literature (1936), books on Greek religion (1948) and Roman religion (1949), <span class="italic">A Commentary on the Surviving Plays of Aeschylus</span> (1, 1957; 2, 1958), and articles in various encyclopaedias, including <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> (14th and 15th edns). In addition, he translated works from Italian, Dutch, German, and Swedish. He had an encyclopaedic mind, a prodigious apparently photographic memory, and a great gift for languages. His forte was the orderly arrangement and lucid exposition of multifarious information, and his work on Greek mythology, though now somewhat slighted, remains a useful reference resource.<br>
<br>Rose was a large man with a powerful personality, well-known in the local community, where he served in the Home Guard during the Second World War. To the end of his life he pedalled from his home to the beach for a daily swim in the North Sea. Indoor pursuits were chess and music. In a letter from Aberystwyth before taking up appointment at St Andrews, he wrote that he expected to have &#145;agreeable colleagues, interesting work, a very fair salary, and opportunity for a good row or two&#146;  (Rose MSS, St Andrews University). He did not shirk &#145;rows&#146;, and his book reviews, like his conversation, could be acerbic. He died at his home, 16 Queens Gardens, St Andrews, on 31 July 1961, and his funeral took place in the college chapel of the University of St Andrews on 3 August 1961.<br>
