<span class="headword">Mather,  Alexander</span>  (1733&#150;1800), <span class="occ">Wesleyan Methodist preacher</span>, was born in February 1733 at Brechin in Forfarshire. His parents, of whom little is known, instructed him &#145;early in the principles of religion&#146; and consequently he was &#145;an utter stranger to the vices common among men&#146;. When he was &#145;about ten years old&#146;, on hearing his schoolteacher pray, he &#145;was struck with strong convictions&#146; and gained &#145;a desire to be a Christian&#146;  (Mather, 91). In 1745 &#145;out of a childish frolic&#146; he fought at the battle of Culloden for the Pretender, and in an attempt to evade the English authorities he spent a brief period living with an uncle near Perth. Although caught and arrested, he was soon released, and commenced work with his father as a baker.<br>
<br>In May 1752 Mather &#145;determined to go abroad&#146; and stayed at Perth for several months, during which time he began to attend the Scottish Episcopal church. In June 1752 he travelled to London, where, after a short time working in different households, he gained employment with Thomas Marriott, a baker in Norton Folgate. He was married on 14 February 1753, although his wife's name is unknown. Due to his strict sabbatarian views he persuaded his employer and other local bakers to cease working on Sunday. At the request of Marriott he began to attend meetings at the Foundery, John Wesley's headquarters in London. He heard Wesley preach for the first time on 14 April 1754, at West Street Chapel, and consequently experienced an evangelical conversion, all his &#145;sorrow, and fear, and anguish of spirit, being changed into a solid peace&#146;  (Mather, 99). He soon became a bandleader, the leader of a class, and a preacher. Having &#145;not eight hours sleep in a week&#146;  (Mather, 148), he would preach in the evening, work most of the night, and preach again at five in the morning. In 1757, due to the &#145;searching preaching of Thomas Walsh&#146;, Mather professed the experience of Christian perfection, claiming &#145;uninterrupted communion with God, whether sleeping or waking&#146;  (ibid., 203). Later in August of that year he was appointed as an itinerant preacher.<br>
<br>As a preacher Mather faced fierce opposition and violence at various places, including Darlaston, Birmingham, and Monmouth. At Wolverhampton the chapel in which he preached was pulled down and his effigy burnt, while at Boston he was so severely molested by the mob that, as he stated, &#145;it was a full year, before I quite recovered the hurts which I then received&#146;  (Mather, 151). In 1761, assisted by his wife, his preaching brought about a significant holiness revival at Wednesbury. Three years later, at the request of Wesley, he visited Wales to &#145;regulate the Societies there&#146;  (ibid., 157). A successful and tireless preacher, Mather became a close friend of Wesley. In 1788 he, with Thomas Rankin and Henry Moore, was ordained superintendent by Wesley for the English work. In 1792 he was elected president of the Methodist conference. His high-church principles were revealed in his criticisms of Alexander Kilham in <span class="italic">An Affectionate Address to the Members of the Methodist Society, in Leeds, and Elsewhere</span>, published jointly with John Pawson in 1794. Mather sat on all conference committees until 1797 and served as district chairman on five occasions from 1791 to 1796.<br>
<br>Mather died at York on 22 August 1800. In character many saw him as &#145;a man of strict integrity, of exemplary conduct, and of great zeal&#146;  (Benson, 552). Abel Stevens, in recognition of his contribution to the establishment of the Methodist connection, described him as &#145;a main pillar of the Wesleyan edifice&#146;  (Stevens, 2.354).<br>
