<span class="headword">Dillon, Sir  William Henry</span>  (1780&#150;1857), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, the illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7658/', "John Talbot Dillon (1734&#150;1806)")</script> and Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Collins, was born in Birmingham on 8 August 1780. He claimed paternal descent from Logon Delome, son of O'Neill, monarch of Ireland. Entering the navy in May 1790, he served as a midshipman under Captain Gambier in the <i>Defence</i>, and was stunned by a splinter in Lord Howe's battle of 1 June 1794 in the north Atlantic. He was present in Lord Bridport's action off the &Icirc;le de Groix on 23 June 1795, and at the capture of St Lucia in May 1796, when he carried a flag of truce to take possession of Pigeon Island. Promoted lieutenant on 29 April 1797, he was serving in the <i>Glenmore</i> in 1798 when he co-operated with the army at Wexford during the rebellion. Here he arrested the Irish chief Skallian. As senior lieutenant of the <i>Africaine</i>, he was sent with a flag of truce from Lord Keith to the Dutch commodore Valterbach, at Helvoetsluys, where he was made prisoner in breach of the truce, on 20 July 1803. He was then handed over to the French, and detained in captivity until September 1807. In the meantime (8 April 1805) he had been made a commander, and after his release he took command of an old, worn-out sloop, the <i>Childers</i>, carrying only fourteen 12-pounder carronades and sixty-five men. On 14 March 1808, on the coast of Norway, the <i>Childers</i> drove off a Danish brig of twenty guns and one hundred and sixty men after a long action. Dillon was severely wounded, and his bravery was acknowledged by the Patriotic Fund at Lloyd's by the presentation of a sword valued at 100 guineas. After obtaining his post commission (21 March 1808) he served at Walcheren, on the coasts of Portugal and Spain, at Newfoundland, in China and India, and finally, between 1835 and 1838, in the Mediterranean, in command of the <i>Russell</i> (74 guns), when he rendered great service to the Spanish legitimist cause. He was made naval equerry to the duke of Sussex, and obtained flag rank on 9 November 1846. He was nominated KCH on 13 January 1835, was knighted by his long-time friend William IV at St James's Palace, on 24 June of the same year, and in 1839 received the good-service pension. He became vice-admiral of the blue on 5 March 1853, and of the red in 1857. Dillon was a short, lightly built man, an accomplished linguist and a pronounced tory in politics. He was married three times, but had no children. His first wife, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Roberts, the widow of a man named Voller, he married on 22 September 1808; they separated in November 1813. In September 1832 he married Isabella (<i>d</i>. 2 Nov 1842), daughter of John Willan of Hatton Garden, London, and on 6 June 1843 Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1887), eldest daughter of J. T. Pettigrew of Savile Row, London. Dillon died at Monaco on 9 September 1857, leaving in manuscript an account of his professional career, with a description of the many scenes in which he had been engaged. This was subsequently (1953&#150;6) published by the Navy Records Society.<br>
