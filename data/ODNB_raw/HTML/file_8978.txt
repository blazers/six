<span class="headword">Evans,  Robert Wilson</span>  (1789&#150;1866), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, second son of John Evans (1756&#150;1846), a surgeon of Llwyn-y-groes, near Oswestry, and his wife, Jane Wilson, was born at the Council House, Shrewsbury, on 30 August 1789. He was educated under Samuel Butler at Shrewsbury School, and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1807. There he became seventh wrangler and second chancellor's medallist, proceeding BA in 1811, MA in 1814, and BD in 1842. He was elected a fellow in 1813 and classical tutor of his college in 1814, becoming a colleague of George Peacock, afterwards dean of Ely. Ordained in 1815 he was presented to the Trinity College living of Aysgarth, Yorkshire, in 1825, where he resided in the long vacations, acquiring experience of parochial ministry. This inspired the religious tale <span class="italic">The Rectory of Valehead</span> (1830; 15th edn, 1852), his most popular work.<br>
<br>Although a scholarly man, contributing five volumes to the <span class="roman">Theological Library</span> series, Evans preferred parish work to university teaching, and resigned his tutorship in 1836 when his former headmaster, Samuel Butler, bishop of Lichfield, made him his examining chaplain and collated him to the vicarage of Tarvin, Cheshire. His ministry there and his addresses to ordinands provided the material for his <span class="italic">The Bishopric of Souls</span> (1842; 5th edn, 1877), a handbook describing the various aspects of a clergyman's work. Highly regarded by J. B. Lightfoot, Evans's book now stands as a vivid account of the methods and aims of the early Victorian clergy in rural parishes (see O. Chadwick, <span class="italic">The Victorian Church</span>, part 2, 1972, 171&#150;4). In 1842 he accepted the Trinity College living of Heversham, Westmorland, in the Lake District, which was congenial to one who had a deep attachment to the countryside. One of his first acts was to build a new vicarage house on the shoulders of Heversham Head, a spot from which he could command an extensive view of the Westmorland scenery. From 1856 to 1865 he was archdeacon of Westmorland. He maintained his literary output, contributing to the <span class="italic">Christian Remembrancer</span> as well as publishing parochial sermons, charges to the clergy, and hymns. Evans died, unmarried, at Heversham vicarage on 10 March 1866. In 1869 his friends endowed in his memory the Evans prize at Cambridge, awarded to those students who distinguished themselves in the theological examination.<br>
