<span class="headword">Clarke,  William</span>  (1798&#150;1856), <span class="occ">cricketer</span>, was born on 24 December 1798 at Bunker's Hill, Nottingham, the son of William Clarke, a bricklayer. Clarke too became a bricklayer, but by the 1830s he had become landlord of The Bell inn, Nottingham. In December 1837, three months after the death of his first wife, Jane, he married Mrs Chapman, who ran the Trent Bridge inn. The following year Clarke opened the Trent Bridge cricket ground, subsequently the home of Nottinghamshire cricket and a notable test match venue. Clarke shocked the public by enclosing the ground, charging a 6<i>d</i>. entrance fee, and offering handsome financial rewards to attract the best opposition. In 1845 he wagered &pound;200 to encourage an &#145;England&#146; side to play a fourteen-man team from Nottinghamshire.<br>
<br>As a batsman Clarke was never in the front rank, being handicapped by the loss of an eye as the result of an accident while playing fives. However, as an underarm lob bowler he excelled. He was, moreover, a man of foresight and business acumen. He recognized in the late 1840s that cricket's local and fragmented popularity could be enhanced nationally through a professional touring eleven. His greatest contribution came with his creation on 31 August 1846 of the All England eleven. This peripatetic professional team comprised the day's best players and was inundated with requests for fixtures. By the early 1850s it was travelling the country playing more than thirty games each season, usually on unequal terms against teams of eighteen or twenty-two local players bolstered by outside professional bowlers. These games often attracted large, festive, and fashionable crowds.<br>
<br>In his own time Clarke was usually called &#145;our general&#146;. Felix (Nicholas Wanostrocht) in his &#145;The doings of the eleven&#146; described him as &#145;painstaking&#146; and &#145;waggish&#146;, but to others he appeared autocratic, and this led to the establishment of rival teams. William Caffyn in <span class="italic">Seventy-one not out</span> agreed Clarke was &#145;a bit of a despot&#146; but added he remained &#145;a great sportsman&#146;. In June 1856 the now stout Clarke took a wicket with the last ball he bowled for the All England eleven. Aged fifty-seven, he had been playing cricket for forty-one seasons. On 25 August 1856, after six weeks in bed, he died of paraplegia at his home, Priory Lodge, Wandsworth Road, London. He was buried in Norwood cemetery. The importance of his role in establishing cricket as a major sport was acknowledged in 1892, when the weekly <span class="italic">Cricket</span> described him as a &#145;missionary&#146; for the game.<br>
