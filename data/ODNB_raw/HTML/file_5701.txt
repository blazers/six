<span class="headword">Clopton,  Walter</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1400), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was probably a member of a family established at Clapton, near Crewkerne in Somerset, and which also held lands elsewhere in Somerset and in Dorset. Little is known about his early career, but he was appointed a king's serjeant in 1376. A patent was issued for his appointment as one of the justices of the king's bench on 27 November 1377, but for reasons that are not clear the appointment did not take effect, and he continued as a king's serjeant until 1388. He served as a justice of assize and gaol delivery on the south-western circuit between 1377 and 1380, and on the home circuit between 1382 and 1387. He was on the commission of the peace in the south-western counties in the early 1380s, and he also served as a commissioner of array in Somerset in 1377 and 1380. He had links with William, earl of Salisbury, acting as one of his feoffees in 1381 and 1382. In these years he acquired more property in Somerset and Dorset&#151;a life tenancy of the manor of Shepton Beauchamp (Somerset) and the manor of Kingston Russell (Dorset); he also held land at Long Sutton (Somerset) and Bromley (Dorset). By grant of Margaret, countess of Devon (<i>d</i>. 1391), he was tenant of the manor of Corston, Somerset, for her life, and in 1385 he acted as a feoffee for her grandson, Edward, earl of Devon. By the 1390s he was sufficiently wealthy to make a loan to the king of 500 marks in August 1396, and he was required to contribute a further 500 marks to Richard II's forced loan in October 1397.<br>
<br>In the political crisis of November&#150;December 1387 the chief justice of the king's bench, Sir Robert Tresilian, was appealed of treasons by the lords appellant, and on 31 January 1388 Clopton was appointed chief justice in his place. He was created knight-banneret in the following April. He presided over the impeachment in the Merciless Parliament (February&#150;June 1388) of four of Richard's closest associates, Simon Burley, John Beauchamp of Holt, James Berners, and John Salisbury, and pronounced sentence of death on them. Despite Clopton's part in the condemnation of his friends, Richard II reappointed him as chief justice of the king's bench when he resumed power in May 1389. During the 1390s Clopton's gaol delivery work was increasingly concentrated on Newgate prison, but he was still appointed from time to time as a justice of the peace and commissioner of gaol delivery in his native west country. As chief justice of the king's bench he was regularly summoned to parliament, and served as a trier of petitions in every parliament until his death. In the parliament of September 1397 the earl of Arundel was arraigned on a charge of treason for his part in the opposition of the lords appellant to Richard II between 1386 and 1388. Arundel pleaded a royal pardon, but was told that the pardon had been obtained by deceit and was null and void. The king then ordered Clopton to warn the earl of the penalty he faced if he could make no better plea, and Clopton went on to inform Arundel that if he had nothing else to say he would be convicted and attainted. The earl's conviction and execution duly followed.<br>
<br>When the second session of this parliament opened at Shrewsbury on 28 January 1398, its first business was to annul the proceedings of the Merciless Parliament of 1388 and to reaffirm the validity of the judges' answers of 1387, which Clopton's predecessor, Tresilian, had helped to formulate and which had constituted one of the counts against him at his trial in 1388. William Thirning, chief justice of the common pleas, was asked his opinion of the answers, and replied that declaration of new treasons was a matter for parliament, but if he had been a lord or peer of parliament and had been asked his opinion he would have replied in the same manner. Clopton, when asked his opinion, offered the same tactful if evasive reply. Clopton was evidently confirmed in office at the accession of Henry IV (though the confirmation was not enrolled), and in the first parliament of the new reign (October&#150;November 1399) he was involved in the inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death of the duke of Gloucester at Calais in September 1397. On 17 October John Hall was brought before parliament and interrogated by Clopton about a statement he had made admitting his complicity in Gloucester's murder. Hall was condemned to death and executed the same day, but there remains much doubt about the truthfulness of his confession. On the following day (18 October) Clopton was required to cross-examine his fellow judge Sir William Rickhill about the latter's part in obtaining the duke of Gloucester's confession. Rickhill maintained that when he was ordered to go to Calais he believed that the duke was already dead, and that in interviewing him and receiving his confession he was doing no more than the king and the captain of Calais, Thomas (I) Mowbray, had required of him. He was duly exonerated.<br>
<br>Clopton died on 21 October 1400. He and his wife, Edith, had no surviving heirs, and his brother Robert, aged over fifty, was named as his heir. He was succeeded as chief justice of the king's bench by Sir William Gascoigne.<br>
