<span class="headword">Webb,  John</span>  (1776&#150;1869), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and antiquary</span>, the eldest son of William Webb (1738&#150;1791) of Castle Street, London, a member of the family of Webb of Odstock, Wiltshire, and his wife, Ann (1747/8&#150;1849), the daughter and coheir of James Sise, medical officer to the Aldgate dispensary, was born on 28 March 1776. His father, who was of independent means, was an able linguist, mathematician, and political writer. John Webb was admitted to St Paul's School, London, on 28 July 1785, and was captain of the school in 1794&#150;5. In 1795 he proceeded to Wadham College, Oxford, as Pauline exhibitioner; he graduated BA on 21 March 1798 and proceeded MA on 3 November 1802. He married Sarah Harding (1776&#150;1849), niece of Judd Harding of Solihull, Warwickshire; they had two children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28930/', "Thomas William Webb")</script> and Sarah, who died in infancy.<br>
<br>In 1800 Webb was ordained to the curacy of Ravenstone in Leicestershire. He was subsequently curate of Ripple, Worcestershire, and of Ross, Herefordshire, and lecturer of St Martin's, with the chapelry of St Bartholomew, Birmingham. He became perpetual curate of Waterfall in Staffordshire in September 1801; he was a minor canon of the cathedral of Worcester, with the rectory of St Clement's in that city, from February 1811. In January 1812 he became rector of Tretire with Michaelchurch, Herefordshire (in the gift of Guy's Hospital); in 1857 he rebuilt the church of Tretire at his own cost. From January 1822 he was a minor canon of the cathedral of Gloucester, and vicar of St John's, Cardiff (in the gift of the dean and chapter of Gloucester), which he held with Tretire until Christmas of 1863.<br>
<br>Webb was a keen antiquary; he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1819. Learned in Latin and Norman-French, he was a talented palaeographer. He contributed several papers to <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, and also published works on Gloucester Abbey and Cathedral. He edited <span class="italic">A Roll of the Household Expenses of Richard de Swinfield</span> (2 parts, 1853&#150;4), which was probably his most significant work. At his death he left unfinished an edition of the <span class="italic">Military Memoir of Colonel John Birch</span> for the Camden Society; it was completed by his son and published in 1873. <span class="italic">Memorials of the Civil War &hellip; as it Affected Herefordshire</span>, which he also left unfinished, was published in 1879 by his son.<br>
<br>Webb also wrote poetry; some verses by him in the manner of Henry Howard, earl of Surrey, imitated the Tudor poet's style so convincingly that G. F. Nott included them in his seminal edition of Surrey's poetry. Also interested in music, Webb adapted &Eacute;tienne-Nicholas M&eacute;hul's oratorio <span class="italic">Joseph</span> and part of Haydn's <span class="italic">Seasons</span> for the Birmingham musical festival. He wrote the words for the oratorio <span class="italic">David</span>, composed by his friend Chevalier Newkomm and first performed in 1834 at the Birmingham musical festival. He prepared a similar foundation for a libretto of Mendelssohn's projected but unaccomplished oratorio <span class="italic">The Hebrew Mother</span>. Webb died at Hardwick vicarage near Hay, Herefordshire, his son's residence, on 18 February 1869.<br>
