<span class="headword">Lancaster,  Thomas William</span>  (1787&#150;1859), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and writer</span>, born at Fulham, Middlesex, on 24 August 1787, was the son of the Revd Thomas Lancaster of Wimbledon, Surrey. He matriculated from Oriel College, Oxford, on 26 January 1804, and graduated BA (with a second class in <i>literae humaniores</i>) in 1807, and MA in 1810. In 1808 he was elected to a Michel scholarship at Queen's College, and in the following year to a fellowship on the same foundation. After being ordained deacon in 1810 and priest in 1812, he became in the latter year curate of Banbury, Oxfordshire, and vicar of Banbury in 1815. He resigned his fellowship at Queen's on his marriage in 1816 to Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Walford (1775/6&#150;1860), of Banbury. They had no children.<br>
<br>Lancaster's relations with his parishioners were not happy, and although he retained the living of Banbury for over thirty-three years, he lived in Oxford for about half that time. In 1849 the bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, persuaded him to exchange Banbury for the rectory of Over Worton, a small village near Woodstock. He did not find the new living more congenial than the old, and continued to live in Oxford, where he frequented the Bodleian Library. In 1831 he preached the Bampton lectures, taking for his subject the popular evidence of Christianity. He was appointed a select preacher to the university in 1832, and a public examiner in 1832&#150;3. From 1840 to 1849 he acted, with little success, as undermaster (<i>ostiarius</i>, or usher) of Magdalen College School, and was for a time chaplain to the dowager countess of Guilford.<br>
<br>Lancaster was one of the old-fashioned &#145;high and dry&#146; school, opposing the broad church and the Tractarians with equal fervour from the university pulpit. Besides his Bampton lectures, Lancaster published quite widely, engaging in the theological pamphlet wars of the 1830s but also writing works such as <span class="italic">The Harmony of the Law and the Gospel</span> (1825), <span class="italic">A Treatise on Confirmation</span> (1830), an edition (1834) of Aristotle's <span class="italic">Nicomachean Ethics</span> widely used in its day, and <span class="italic">Vindiciae symbolicae</span> (1848), a treatise on creeds and articles. Lancaster had partly prepared for press a collection of his sermons when he died, on 12 December 1859, at his lodgings in High Street, Oxford. He was buried in Holywell cemetery, and his sermons were published by subscription (1860). His wife died on 8 February 1860, aged eighty-four.<br>
