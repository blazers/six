</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boyer,  Abel</span>  (1667?&#150;1729), <span class="occ">lexicographer and journalist</span>, was most probably born on 24 June 1667, at Castres in the upper Languedoc, the son of Pierre Boyer, one of the two chief magistrates or consuls of Castres, and Catherine Campdomerc (<i>b</i>. 1651), the eighth child of the marriage of Eleazar Campdomerc and Sara De Terson. As magistrate, his father had suffered suspension from office and was fined for his commitment to protestantism. It was from Pierre Campdomerc, his maternal uncle, that Abel Boyer apparently got his first rudiments of learning.<h2>
<a name="Education"></a>Education</h2>In 1683 or 1684 Boyer embarked upon the first formal educational training for which there is evidence. He entered the nearby protestant academy of Puylaurens (formerly Montauban), as his uncle had done before him. He enrolled as a student of theology, apparently aiming to follow a family tradition and become a minister in the Huguenot church. Among the alumni of Montauban was Pierre Bayle, a close friend of one Andr&eacute; Terson, a member of Boyer's mother's family. However, Boyer's studies at Puylaurens were curtailed in March 1685 when the academy was suppressed by royal decision. Some time after the revocation of the edict of Nantes in October, Boyer fled France for the Netherlands.<br>
<br>In 1687 poverty may have obliged Boyer to serve briefly in the army of the Dutch republic, as did many other Huguenots at the time. The experience, if it took place, may have contributed to his later close technical interest in things military which, he claimed in 1696, was based partly on what he had seen of some of the battlefields of Flanders. However, he soon resumed his interrupted studies at the University of Franeker in Friesland. According to Pierre Bayle, who had declined in 1684 the offer of the chair of philosophy at Franeker, Boyer attended courses in philosophy and theology, and also in mathematics and fortification&#151;then regarded not only as connected studies, but as regular parts of the education of a gentleman.<br>
<br>When Boyer left the Netherlands some time after 11 July 1689, he took with him to England a letter of introduction from Bayle to Bishop Burnet, recently consecrated as the bishop of Salisbury and well known to Bayle as a scholar with a passionate concern for the plight of the Huguenots. In October 1690 Boyer is recorded as having received a payment of 15<i>s</i>. out of the Royal Bounty Fund as a student in divinity, and it seems reasonable to give credence to the claim of Boyer's first contemporary obituarists&#151;his widow, Mary, and a cousin&#151;that his first employment in England was writing and preparing for publication in 1691 Dr Thomas Smith's edition of William Camden's letters. In July 1691 Boyer was established in the family of Sir Benjamin Bathurst, comptroller of the household of the prince and princess of Denmark, and was then, or soon after, appointed French and Latin tutor to Bathurst's eldest son, Allen.<h2>
<a name="Fromtutortoauthor"></a>From tutor to author</h2>Boyer's own first published work, <span class="italic">The compleat French master for ladies and gentlemen: being a new method, to learn with ease and delight the French tongue</span> (1694), was, as its subtitle suggests, French without tears, a genre of literary production then much in vogue, and it enjoyed immediate and lasting popular favour throughout the eighteenth century in Britain, Europe, and North America. In the hope of courtly preferment as French teacher in the household of the duke of Gloucester (the son of Prince George of Denmark and Princess Anne), it was dedicated to the duke and, according to Boyer's preface to the eighth edition of 1721, had been encouraged by Anne herself. At the time of Boyer's death the work had gone through ten editions.<br>
<br>In 1695 Boyer published his <span class="italic">Character of the Virtues and Views of the Age</span>, with a fulsome preface to &#145;the much honoured Allen Bathurst&#146;. The following year he published <span class="italic">A Geographical and Historical Description of those Parts of Europe which are the Seat of War</span>, which was dedicated to the duke of Ormond, one of the Denmarks' circle of friends. In the second half of 1698 Boyer appeared as a translator in the publication of <span class="italic">Ductor historicus</span>, a historical work by the French priest and theologian Pierre Le Lorrain de Vallemont. In dedicating this work to John, Lord Churchill, Boyer acknowledged the Churchill family's repeated encouragements in his endeavours to serve the public.<br>
<br>In 1699 Boyer published his <span class="italic">Royal Dictionary</span>, which he had begun in 1694 or thereabouts, and which was dedicated to the duke of Gloucester, with, as Boyer claimed, the knowledge, favour, and encouragement of Princess Anne. The work was something of an innovation in England in announcing a particular and unusual view of language as a changing, living thing. It did this by citing recent and living writers as sources or authorities, and by attempting to convey the variety of meanings of a word according to word usage as found in their works.<br>
<br>Apart from giving Boyer entrance into English intellectual and social circles, the <span class="italic">Royal Dictionary</span> also made him a European man of letters. Immediately upon its publication, and well into the second half of the eighteenth century, the work was published&#151;and pirated&#151;across Europe. However, the record of European publication, though impressive, is dwarfed by the reception in England. Nineteen editions each of the <span class="italic">Royal Dictionary</span> and the <span class="italic">Royal Dictionary Abridged</span> were published in London between 1699 and 1797. The <span class="italic">Royal Dictionary</span> found a place in the libraries of scholars, public figures (including Dr Johnson), politicians, and clerics; increasingly, however, it found its main use in the classroom. But for Boyer himself the most important consequence of the <span class="italic">Royal Dictionary</span> seems to have been the encouragement it gave him, perhaps above all financially, to abandon tutoring and to make a living as a writer: not a year went by between 1699 and his death in 1729 without publication.<h2>
<a name="Annalisthistorianpropagandistmanofletters"></a>Annalist, historian, propagandist, man of letters</h2>In 1700 two publications came from Boyer's pen: a translation of Racine's <span class="italic">Iphig&eacute;nie</span>, entitled <span class="italic">Achilles</span>, which saw a few performances at Drury Lane, and an aid to the learning of French by English speakers, and of English by foreigners, entitled <span class="italic">The Wise and Ingenious Companion, French and English</span>. In 1701 there was a return to military history in <span class="italic">The Draughts of the most Remarkable Fortified Towns of Europe</span>, and in 1702&#150;3 he published in three volumes <span class="italic">The History of King William the Third</span>, the first complete published account of William's life and reign. In <span class="italic">A Geographical and Historical Description</span> Boyer had described William as &#145;our Glorious Monarch&#146;  (p. 1). The possessive pronoun is significant: Boyer wrote of England as if he were an Englishman, though he remained proud of his French roots.<br>
<br>Boyer had intended originally to carry his <span class="italic">William III</span> as far as the coronation of Queen Anne. He made good that promise with <span class="italic">The History of the Reign of Queen Anne Digested into Annals</span> (1703&#150;13), concerned more with British than with continental affairs, and Boyer took particular pride in his coverage of parliamentary affairs, including parliamentary debates. In the same year as he began the <span class="italic">Annals</span> he started, or was already engaged in, a manuscript newsletter service, and by 1714 he was well known as a newsletter writer, willing to write a letter every post for a guinea a month. In 1704 he also became something of an intelligence agent, employed, and possibly paid, by Robert Harley, then secretary of state for the northern department.<br>
<br>In July 1705, in response to a plea from Abel Roper, the publisher of Boyer's <span class="italic">William III</span> and of his <span class="italic">Annals</span>, Boyer agreed to write for the thrice-weekly newspaper the <span class="italic">Post Boy</span>, as the author of its foreign coverage. Boyer later claimed that he had turned around the fortunes of the paper within a year. Good fortune also came his way in 1706 when he achieved naturalization at his second attempt. However, in August 1709 he fell out with Roper, and in a pre-emptive coup Boyer took over the newspaper himself; he continued to write for it under that title and under the title the <span class="italic">True Post Boy</span> until April 1710.<br>
<br>In 1710 Boyer hoped to renew the patronage that Robert Harley had conferred upon him in 1704, and dedicated to him his <span class="italic">Annals</span> for that year. The &#145;small place&#146; for which he petitioned was that of gazetteer, editor of the only officially authorized government newspaper, the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, the office having become vacant probably in August upon the resignation of its holder, Richard Steele  (R. P. Bond, 71, n. 57). Unfortunately, in his concern to prove his loyalty to Harley, Boyer crossed swords with Jonathan Swift: although the appointment of gazetteer fell to Henry St John, the secretary of state for northern affairs, it was to Swift that St John deferred in all matters of the press.<br>
<br>Boyer first attacked Swift in the March issue of a new periodical, the <span class="italic">Political State of Great Britain</span>, which Boyer had begun in January 1711. The journal&#151;which provided a register of monthly occurrences across Britain, America, and Europe, abstracted pamphlets and books, offered observations on trade and public finance, and reported regularly on current parliamentary debates&#151;was Boyer's enduring historical monument, and he compiled it until his death. It was also the main vehicle for Boyer's lifelong feud with Swift. In September 1711 the feud approached its climax, with the publication by Boyer of <span class="italic">An Account of the State and Progress of the Present Negotiation of Peace</span>, a reply to Swift's <span class="italic">New Journey to Paris</span>. The next month, at Swift's prompting, St John charged Boyer with seditious libel, and required him to provide a recognizance of &pound;200 as surety for his appearance at the court of queen's bench to answer the charge against him. However, as a result of intercession by Harley, now earl of Oxford and first lord of the Treasury, Boyer was discharged at the end of the Michaelmas term; in respect of the gazetteership, however, he was disappointed, passed over twice, in both cases in favour of creatures of Swift.<br>
<br>Stung, Boyer now sought to position himself as an ardent supporter of the Hanoverian succession. Initially he continued to attack the proposed peace between Britain and France in the <span class="italic">Political State</span>. He claimed to be acting as an impartial reporter of the arguments on both sides, but gave the whigs the best of the argument, congratulating them on having won not only the argument but also the overwhelming support of the political nation. Boyer was freer to express a personal opinion as a pamphleteer than as the compiler of a periodical that laid claim to be a paper of record. In summer 1713 he translated a learned, wide-ranging, and widely circulated attack on the folly of the peace, written originally in French by another Huguenot refugee, Jean Dumont, entitled <span class="italic">Les soupirs de l'Europe etc., or, The groans of Europe at the prospect of the present posture of affairs</span>; this was followed by a translation of a work by Andr&eacute;-Fran&ccedil;ois Deslandes, entitled <span class="italic">A Philological Essay, or, Reflections on the Death of Free-Thinkers</span>.<br>
<br>Having in these publications acted as a conduit of French culture, Boyer engaged in cultural traffic in the opposite direction, providing the first French translation of Addison's <span class="italic">Cato</span> in 1713. Whether or not Addison's <span class="italic">Cato</span> and Boyer's translation of it can be considered political acts is unclear, but what is certain is that most of Boyer's publications of the following year were deliberately political, designed to restore connections with those (like the Marlboroughs) who had assisted him in the past, to distance himself still further from Oxford and Bolingbroke, and to demonstrate his own zeal for the Hanoverian succession. In the <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life and Negotiations of Sir William Temple</span> (1714) Boyer made of Temple's life as diplomat and servant of the crown a tract for his own times. The work branded Oxford and Bolingbroke as Jacobites, just as they had abandoned negotiations with the Pretender (James Stuart) and were facing the difficult task of establishing their loyalty to the Hanoverian succession. This was made more difficult with Boyer's publication on 1 July 1714 of letters from Anne to Sophia, the dowager electress of Hanover, to the elector of Hanover (later George I), and to the duke of Cambridge (later George II). These gave an unwelcome public airing to the divisions between the Hanoverian court and Anne and her government, and cast doubt upon the professions of private and public zeal for the Hanoverian succession by Bolingbroke and Oxford. Two days later Bolingbroke issued a warrant for Boyer's arrest: he was bound over in a recognizance of &pound;100 and ordered to present himself at the court of queen's bench on the first day of the next term. However, the action was overtaken by events: on 27 July Oxford was dismissed, on 1 August Anne died and was succeeded peacefully by George I, on 31 August Bolingbroke was dismissed, and on 29 November Boyer was discharged.<br>
<br>Boyer expected some return for his services and sufferings for the Hanoverian cause, and his impatience at the delay in this was evident in an advertisement of April 1716 heralding the publication of his <span class="italic">Compleat and Impartial History of the Impeachments of the Last Ministry</span>. However, neither the advertisement nor the work itself won Boyer the gazetteership he still seems to have coveted most: once again, he was passed over. None the less, one favour soon came his way from James Stanhope, shortly to become secretary of state for northern affairs. In November or December 1716 Boyer published a defence of the ministry's northern policies, <span class="italic">The Interest of Great Britain</span>, which was written, according to Boyer, at the particular request of Stanhope, with materials provided by the minister. In his dedication to Stanhope, Boyer saluted him as a patron nonpareil, but there is no evidence that Stanhope did anything more for Boyer.<br>
<br>Boyer continued to serve Stanhope and also to hound Oxford; Oxford, awaiting his trial for treason in the Tower and nurturing his antipathy towards whig journalists, awarded the palm of his opprobrium to Boyer as &#145;the greatest scoundrel in the world that understands neither French nor English&#146;  (BL, Portland loan, 29/38/6). A week before Oxford was due to come to trial, in June 1717, Boyer, accused of being the author of <span class="italic">Minutes of the Negociations of Mons</span>, denied the charge and instead proclaimed the tract a forgery of a kind that pointed unmistakably to Daniel Defoe as its author. Defoe responded at once with a <i>tu quoque</i> decrying Boyer as &#145;the scum of Hackney Scribblers&#146;, a mercenary plagiarist who clumsily cobbled together the works of others, cheated his booksellers, and practised openly almost all abominable vices; Defoe even attempted to publish a newspaper advertisement describing Boyer, now fifty and still apparently unmarried, as a sodomite  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 5.537). Boyer ostentatiously disdained from replying, though he continued to snipe at Defoe in the <span class="italic">Political State</span> long afterwards.<br>
<br>In August 1718 Boyer published anonymously <span class="italic">Animadversions and Observations</span>, a lengthy and closely argued defence of the government's financial policies in reply to an attack on them from the disaffected whig Archibald Hutcheson. Though concerned primarily with the detail of financial policy and with praising the excellent financial judgement of ministers, without &#145;any Design to make my Court to any Body&#146;, Boyer ranged beyond finance to applaud the government's foreign policy, revisiting ground he had covered in <span class="italic">The Interest of Great Britain</span> in 1716, and to clear the crown of blame for the party quarrels which had accompanied the accession of George I  (p. 88). He also took up the defence of his fellow Huguenot refugees in England, praising their large contribution to public funds in perilous times, to the growth of manufacture and of trade, and to raising Britain to an unprecedented peak of prosperity and contentment. In contrast, the only other separate publication by Boyer in that year was far removed from high politics, though it showed him once again in cantankerous dispute with a fellow writer: he accused John Ozell, with the latter's new translation of Fenelon's <span class="italic">T&eacute;l&eacute;maque</span>, of plagiarizing a 1699 version of which Boyer had been a translator.<br>
<br>However, the spat with Ozell contributed to a much more serious confrontation with the government in April and May 1722. Having been alerted in a letter from Edmund Curll, the publisher of Ozell's translation of <span class="italic">T&eacute;l&eacute;maque</span>, to the publication in the March issue of the <span class="italic">Political State</span> of a libel against Walpole, the government apprehended Boyer and obliged him to enter a recognizance for the huge sum of &pound;500. Salt was further added to the wound as the author of the libel was Archibald Hutcheson, though Boyer claimed that he had provided abstracts in order to expose its author to the detestation he deserved. The threat of punishment and the large pecuniary penalty were evidently seen as sufficient to ensure better behaviour in future, as no further legal action was taken. Boyer occasionally took a more critical line, even crossing swords with a former hero, Bishop Benjamin Hoadly (with whom he had sided during the Bangorian controversy of 1717), in Hoadly's capacity as government propagandist, and by 1729 he was taking up a somewhat isolationist position in respect of Europe.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>Towards the end of 1722 Boyer produced what he regarded as his greatest work, <span class="italic">The History of the Life and Reign of Queen Anne</span>, essentially a reformed version of the <span class="italic">Annals</span> and the early volumes of the <span class="italic">Political State</span>. In the following year Boyer was able to complete the work in his new home he had built for himself in Five Field Row near Chelsea College, in a fashionable and then distinctly whiggish suburb of London; he had lived previously&#151;since 1708 at least&#151;at a property which had doubled as a shop in Queen's Court, King Street, near Covent Garden. Chelsea was also noted for its good air, which could have been a consideration for a sickly man. By January 1729 Boyer complained of having been housebound for more than a year and &#145;under the disadvantage of a crazy Constitution, broken with Age, constant Labour, and a Compilation of a stubborn Gout and Rheumatism, and the remains of a long fit of Ague and Fever&#146;  (<span class="italic">Political State</span>, 37, 1729, preface).<br>
<br>Poor health and general decrepitude were not Boyer's only difficulties. In February 1729 he was threatened with arrest by the House of Commons for having breached parliamentary privilege by publishing abstracts of the <span class="italic">Votes</span> in the <span class="italic">Political State</span>. Boyer huffed and puffed, but heeded the warning, immediately ceasing to report current proceedings in parliament, summarizing them only after the end of the parliamentary session. This was Boyer's last brush with authority, but he continued pen in hand, living only long enough to see into print a revised and enlarged edition of his <span class="italic">Royal Dictionary</span>, a further edition of his <span class="italic">Theory and Practice of Architecture</span>, which he had first published in 1703, and the tenth edition of his <span class="italic">Compleat French-Master</span>. He also completed <span class="italic">The Grand Theatre of Honour, Nobility, and Chivalry</span>, in French and English, taking the history no further than the tenth century on the grounds that he wished not to offend the niceties of certain reigning princes, and planned a second volume to cover parts of Europe omitted in the first. However, he died on 16 November 1729, presumably at his home in Chelsea, a month before <span class="italic">The Grand Theatre</span> was published.<br>
<br>Boyer retained to his end a sense of double identity; in the month before he died he described himself as &#145;Gallo-Britannus&#146;  (<span class="italic">Political State</span>, 37, 1729, 298). This was reflected in his will, made in December 1727. It reveals the existence of a daughter (said to be about three years old in 1729) named Pierre Catherine, presumably in memory of his parents. The bulk of his estate was left to her, with instructions that his executors&#151;his wife and his cousin, the latter certainly a French Huguenot by origin&#151;should turn everything into money and invest it in the Bank of England. As an institution that owed much to Huguenot expertise and investment, and that was distinctly whiggish from its start and thereafter, it was a fitting resting place for the fiscal remains of someone of Boyer's origins and loyalties. He was buried in Chelsea Old Church yard on 19 November 1729.<br>
