<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sewall,  Samuel</span>  (1652&#150;1730), <span class="occ">judge and diarist in America</span>, was born on 28 March 1652 at Bishop Stoke, Hampshire, the second child of Henry Sewall (<i>c</i>.1615&#150;1700) and Jane (1627&#150;1701), daughter of Stephen and Alice (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Archer) Dummer. The Sewall and Dummer families had earlier emigrated to Newbury, Massachusetts, in 1634&#150;5 and 1638 respectively. Out of &#145;dislike to the English Hierarchy&#146; Samuel's paternal grandfather had sent his only child ahead of him to New England, &#145;with Net Cattel and Provisions sutable for a new Plantation&#146;. Henry and Jane were married in 1646, but the following winter, &#145;the Climat being not agreeable&#146; to Jane's parents, the young couple returned with them to England  (Thomas, xxix&#150;xxx). Henry Sewall travelled to New England in 1659, two years after his father's death, to secure his estate. Although he had planned to return home to his pastorate at North Baddesley, Hampshire, the Restoration made it prudent for him to remain in Newbury and send for his wife and five children, who arrived in 1661. Jane bore three more children in Newbury.<br>
<br>Samuel Sewall attended Romsey grammar school in Hampshire, and shortly after his arrival in Newbury became a student of Thomas Parker, who prepared him to enter Harvard College in 1667. Sewall graduated BA in 1671, became a resident fellow and tutor in 1673, and graduated MA in 1674; he was later an overseer of the college. On 28 February 1676 he married Hannah (1658&#150;1717), the only living child of John Hull, the wealthy and influential merchant, silversmith, and mint-master of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Now Sewall put aside any plans for the ministry, and began to learn &#145;the manner of the Merchants&#146;  (Thomas, 1.18). The couple lived in the Hulls' Boston home. Sewall became a member of the Third (South) Church in 1677, just before the birth of the first of his fourteen children, of whom only six lived to maturity.<br>
<br>Sewall became a freeman of the colony in 1678, and the following year joined the ancient and honorable artillery company, receiving the rank of captain in 1701. He managed the Boston printing press from 1681 to 1684. With John Hull's death in 1683 Sewall took over his father-in-law's merchant business and property interests, and assumed many of his civic and political roles. At the end of 1683 he became a (non-resident) deputy to the general court from Westfield, and was elected to Hull's place as captain of the south company of militia, though he resigned the command on religious grounds in 1686 because of an order to put the cross in the militia's colours. Each year from 1684 to 1686 he was elected to the seat Hull left vacant on the court of assistants.<br>
<br>Matters related to the abrogation of the Massachusetts Bay charter in 1684 and the establishment of the royal government in 1686 caused Sewall to travel to England in November 1688. The journal he kept during his year-long trip describes his attendance to his family's property interests, visits to relatives, sightseeing, and efforts to support Increase Mather, minister of Boston's Second (North) Church, in his appeals for the restoration of the colony's privileges. Thus Sewall was absent from New England during the revolt against Governor Edmund Andros, which was an extension of the revolution of 1688, and the provisional re-establishment of the old government in the spring of 1689. When Sewall returned, he resumed his place on the court of assistants. He was named to the governor's council under the new province charter of 1691, and re-elected annually until his retirement in 1725. In May 1692 he was appointed commissioner of oyer and terminer for the Salem witchcraft proceedings. In December that year, despite the disfavour into which the witchcraft court had fallen, Sewall was made a justice of the superior court of judicature, and he became chief justice in 1718, a position he retained until his resignation in 1728. Alone among the witchcraft judges Sewall publicly recanted, standing in the South Church on 14 January 1697, a fast day, while the minister read on his behalf a bill in which he assumed the &#145;Blame and Shame&#146; for his part in the trials  (Thomas, 1.366&#150;7). From 1699 to his death he was a commissioner (and for much of the time secretary and treasurer) of the Company for the Propagation of the Gospel in New England and Parts Adjacent. His published writings include an anti-slavery tract, <span class="italic">The Selling of Joseph: a Memorial</span> (1700), and other religious works and poetry. He was judge of probate for Suffolk County from 1715 to 1728, and held numerous municipal offices.<br>
<br>The diary Sewall kept from December 1673 to October 1729 is a rich source of social history and his most enduring legacy. Sewall reveals himself to have been an affectionate and engaged father. The birth, illness, and death of his children moved him profoundly. He tells of his son Samuel's difficulties as a student and apprentice, and of his troubled marriage to Rebeckah, daughter of Governor Joseph Dudley; daughter Elizabeth's religious fears; daughter Hannah's life as an invalid; son Joseph's rise to the ministry of the South Church; daughter Mary's death in childbed; and daughter Judith's marriage to William Cooper, minister of the Brattle Street Church. Though Sewall was deeply religious and constant to puritan ways (he abhorred periwigs and Christmas-keeping), his diary entries extend far beyond spiritual soul-searching, providing a remarkable record of his everyday interactions with notable and ordinary New Englanders. He rode the arduous court circuit until he was seventy-six; watched with the sick and bore the dead to their graves; and took into his home several children, including an American Indian boy, whom he prepared for Harvard.<br>
<br>Sewall's wife, Hannah, died on 19 October 1717. His often dispiriting pursuit of eligible widows thereafter is candidly documented in his diary. He married Abigail Woodmansey Tilley, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Melyen (<i>c</i>.1666&#150;1720) on 29 October 1719, but she died within months. On 29 March 1722 he married Mary Gibbs, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Shrimpton (1667&#150;1746), who survived him. Samuel Sewall died on 1 January 1730 and was buried in the Hull&#150;Sewall tomb in Boston's Granary burying-ground.<br>
