<span class="headword">Lushington,  Edmund Law</span>  (1811&#150;1893), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born on 10 January 1811 at Prestwich, Lancashire, the son of Edmund Henry Lushington (1766&#150;1839), chief commissioner of the colonial board of audit and master of the crown office, and his second wife, Sophia (<i>c</i>.1780&#150;1841), daughter of Thomas Philips of Sedgeley, near Manchester. He spent his childhood at Hanwell, Middlesex, and was educated at Charterhouse School (1823&#150;8) where he became head of the school while still young and not very robust and found the exacting duties of captain somewhat irksome. Thackeray was one of his contemporaries there and was also with him for a time at Cambridge. Entering Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1828, Lushington was two years Tennyson's junior and with him, Arthur Hallam, Trench, and others, was associated in the select club of twelve called the Apostles (commemorated in <span class="italic">In Memoriam</span>, lxxxvii). He was made a scholar in 1830.<br>
<br>In 1832 Lushington was senior classic and senior chancellor's medallist. The year was a specially brilliant one, Henry Alford, Richard Shilleto, and William Hepworth Thompson, afterwards master of Trinity, also being in the list. In <span class="italic">The Virginians</span> (vol. 1, chap. 41) Thackeray makes a covert though sufficiently obvious allusion to the brilliant scholarship of Thompson and Lushington. Lushington was elected a fellow in 1834 and became an assistant tutor in 1835.<br>
<br>In 1838 Lushington succeeded Sir Daniel Keyte Sandford as professor of Greek at Glasgow, gaining the appointment over Robert Lowe (Lord Sherbrooke), after Archibald Campbell Tait, subsequently archbishop of Canterbury, had withdrawn his candidature. On 14 October 1842 Lushington married Cecilia Tennyson, sister of Alfred, Lord Tennyson. The marriage ceremony was performed by Charles Tennyson Turner, Lushington's marriage with his sister being celebrated by Tennyson in the epilogue to <span class="italic">In Memoriam</span>.<br>
<br>Lushington's colleague as professor of humanity was William Ramsay. C. J. Fordyce, a more recent occupant of Ramsay's chair, described them as &#145;a pair of professors who not only outshone all their predecessors but vastly outshone their contemporaries in the other [Scottish] universities&#146;. Their pupils included a number of men who later became prominent classical scholars: W. Y. Sellar, L. Campbell, D. B. Monro, and J. Frazer. Nevertheless, Lushington's abilities were not as well suited as Ramsay's to the teaching of large elementary classes which constituted much of their work. His wife disliked Glasgow and preferred to remain in England during the university term. In 1875 he resigned his chair, the university conferring on him the honorary degree of LLD. He settled at Park House, Maidstone, the residence described in the prologue to <span class="italic">The Princess</span>, which is dedicated to his brother Henry. In 1884 he was elected lord rector of Glasgow University, and the principal, John Caird, welcomed him with a fitting eulogy when he delivered the customary rectorial address. He died at Park House on 13 July 1893. He was survived by his wife and his daughter Cecilia.<br>
<br>Although believed to have written anonymously for some of the reviews, Lushington made few acknowledged contributions to literature. He translated into Greek Tennyson's <span class="italic">Oenone</span> and <span class="italic">Crossing the Bar</span>, the version of the latter giving the poet especial satisfaction. He contributed interesting reminiscences to volume 1 of H. Tennyson's memoir of his father, Lord Tennyson. He collaborated with Sir Alexander Grant in editing in 1866 (2nd edn, 1875) the <span class="italic">Philosophical Works</span> of James Frederick Ferrier, prefixing to the volume of <span class="italic">Philosophical Remains</span> a thoughtful memoir and appreciation. He published the Glasgow rectorial address in 1885.<br>
