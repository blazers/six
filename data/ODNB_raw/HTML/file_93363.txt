<span class="headword">Veno, Sir  William Henry</span>  (1866&#150;1933), <span class="occ">patent medicine entrepreneur</span>, was born William Reynard Varney in Castle Douglas, Renfrewshire, on 22 December 1866, the son of William Varney, a gamekeeper, and his wife, Grace Susan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Paterson. He was educated in Newton Stewart and then worked as a shop assistant before running away to sea. Frustrated by the lack of suitable British outlets for his organizing talents, he emigrated to the United States about 1887.<br>
<br>Varney established a business in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for the manufacture of a cough medicine, publicizing it by lecture tours on health and disease through much of America and by holding consultations with patients. In 1896, having married Mary (<i>d</i>. in or after 1947), daughter of James Pearson of nearby Philipsburg, he changed his name to William Henry Veno (and by deed poll in Britain in 1910). Doubtless emulating James Crossley Eno of fruit salt fame, he felt that Veno's Lightning Cough Cure had a seductive ring to it. The following year he sold up and returned to Britain, founding the Veno Drug Company at Manchester in 1898. After initial periodic tours around northern England to lecture and see patients, Veno soon relied on advertising to push his cough cure. By 1908 he was successful enough to register a limited company of that name with a &pound;40,000 capital, of which &pound;35,000 represented goodwill. A year later the British Medical Association's analysts found that, in addition to a sugary base, the medicine contained 8 per cent glycerine and small quantities of alcohol, chloroform, and resin  (<span class="italic">Secret Remedies</span>, 16).<br>
<br>Veno enjoyed family share control of his enterprise and paid no dividends until 1922. After adding Dr Cassell's tablets for headaches and Germolene ointment to the cough cure, he mechanized his production along American lines, making his Manchester factory the most self-contained site on either side of the Atlantic, with only the basic ingredients being bought in. It had carton-making and printing departments, and the medicine bottles came from a glass manufacturing company which Veno owned. On the technical side, there were an engineering workshop and laboratory, the chief chemist being a skilled engineer who had designed the mixing and filling machinery, and had created a dust-free atmosphere in which no product was touched by hand.<br>
<br>Veno was also active in civic life and, having become president of the Manchester Press Club and chairman of the local Conservative Association, he was knighted in 1920 for his public services. Widely respected for his untiring drive and business grit, he was also an enthusiastic art collector and interested in the theatre and cinema; after a health scare he generously supported a cancer research charity. By 1923/4 Veno Drug's sales had reached &pound;670,000, earning profits of &pound;125,000. In 1925 he sold the company for a reported &pound;500,000 to the property tycoon Philip Hill, on behalf of the newly created Beecham Estates and Pills Ltd which Hill controlled and was eager to expand by acquiring similar medicinal businesses. Although not yet sixty, Veno may have been concerned about future death duties should he die in harness. He subsequently lamented that selling out had been one of the worst mistakes of his life. Indeed, his remaining eight years demonstrate how his quite exceptional talents as a technological innovator and factory organizer deserted him when he sought business ventures to enhance his fortune, said to be as high as &pound;1 million. He became associated with two of the period's most notorious speculators, James White and Clarence Hatry, losing &pound;100,000 through the former's downfall and suicide in 1927, and a similar amount when the latter's financial empire collapsed two years later.<br>
<br>Veno's more straightforward investments in Britain and the United States were likewise badly hit by the economic slump from 1929 onwards, while other ventures at home were unwisely chosen. He put large sums into modest businesses that were competing against very powerful rivals; he was, for example, director of a small artificial silk company which, in the shops and the law courts, clashed with the synthetic fibre giant Courtaulds. In 1933, seeking to recapture the excitement and challenge of running his own business, he prepared to launch a new medicine for treating stomach complaints in what was an already overcrowded market. By then, Veno's debts were rapidly overwhelming him, and he was required to put up his imposing mansion, The Woodlands, in Dunham Massey, near Altrincham, for sale by private treaty. But before any agreement was made, he shot himself on 6 March 1933 at his home, according to the coroner during a fit of impulsive insanity. His wife, three sons, and two daughters survived him. He left &pound;181,885 gross, but nil personalty.<br>
