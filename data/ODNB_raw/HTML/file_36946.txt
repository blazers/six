<span class="headword">Wilson, Sir  Arthur Knyvet</span>, third baronet  (1842&#150;1921), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in Swaffham, Norfolk, on 4 March 1842. He was the third son of Commander (later Rear-Admiral) George Knyvet Wilson RN (1798&#150;1866), and his wife, Agnes Mary, daughter of the Revd William Yonge (<i>d</i>. 2 Dec 1845), aged ninety-two, vicar of Swaffham, 1799&#150;1845. Wilson attended Eton College from 1852 to 1855; he entered the navy in 1855, and was immediately employed on active service in the Black Sea during the later stages of the Crimean War. Subsequently he joined his relative Captain Henry Keppel on board the <i>Raleigh</i>, destined for the China station. After the <i>Raleigh</i> was wrecked Wilson transferred to the flagship <i>Calcutta</i> and served with distinction through the Second Opium War, notably at the capture of Canton (Guangzhou) in 1858. After service in the Pacific, Wilson passed his examinations for lieutenant in 1863, but with seniority back-dated to December 1861, for his outstanding results. In 1867 he joined a naval mission to Japan, under Commander Richard Tracey, and helped to lay the foundations of a new service. On his return he spent a year on the cadet training ship <i>Britannia</i>, before serving as the junior member of a committee appointed to examine the capabilities of the Whitehead, or locomotive, torpedo in 1870. He then served afloat for six years, his professional skill, enthusiasm, and resource coming to the attention of several senior officers, notably Sir Astley Cooper Key (first sea lord, 1879&#150;85). Having been promoted commander in September 1873, Wilson joined a new <i>Raleigh</i> (Captain George Tryon), in the detached squadron from 1874 to 1876. In 1876 he was appointed commander of the <i>Vernon</i>, a hulk in Portsmouth harbour recently established as a torpedo school. For the next three years Wilson devoted his great talent and energy to the use of torpedoes and mines, particularly mine counter-measures, a vital task for a sea-control navy that expected to operate in hostile coastal waters. He was promoted captain in April 1880.<br>
<br>After Wilson had revised the torpedo manual Admiral Key appointed him to the pioneer torpedo depot ship <i>Hecla</i> in 1881. He was present at the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882 and, with John Fisher, played a major part in operations on shore. Two years later he landed with a machine gun detachment at Trinkitat in the Sudan, during the campaign against Mahdists, and won the Victoria Cross (21 May 1884) for his gallantry at the battle of al-Teb on 29 February 1884. When one corner of the infantry square broke Wilson held off the Mahdists with his sword and, when that broke, his fists, until relieved. After a spell commanding the <i>Raleigh</i> on the Cape station, and serving under John Fisher as assistant director of torpedoes, Wilson was appointed to the <i>Vernon</i> in 1889, which had now become a separate command. He developed the submerged torpedo tube, the twin torpedo launcher for torpedo boats, and net-cutters to deal with the protective nets then deployed against torpedoes.<br>
<br>Wilson commanded the battleship <i>Sans Pareil</i> in the Mediterranean Fleet from 1892 to 1895, being present on 22 June 1893, when the <i>Victoria</i> was rammed and sunk with the loss of his old captain, Sir George Tryon. Wilson had not approved of Tryon's radical ideas on tactics, and had been annoyed when Tryon poached his commander, John Jellicoe, for the flagship. After serving as temporary flag captain to Sir Michael Culme-Seymour, Wilson, as senior captain, worked on cruiser scouting systems and exercised independent command. He was promoted rear-admiral in June 1895, and after conducting important exercises with the new destroyers, served at the Admiralty from 1897 to 1901 as controller of the navy and third sea lord. In 1901, entirely opposed to the first lord's policy on the contentious issue of boilers, he was offered command of the channel squadron, and was promoted vice-admiral. He retained command of ever larger Channel or Home fleets until 1907. These fleets were schools for tactical and evolutionary exercise; he insisted on war readiness, exercises in confined waters and fog, and lengthy periods at sea. His mastery of strategic and tactical manoeuvres reflected long experience, and the mental agility and mathematical skills he had acquired early in his career.<br>
<br>Wilson laid the foundations of the fleet handling systems used in both world wars; his success in the 1901 annual manoeuvres established the system of cruising in columns and deploying into line just before battle that was used by his disciple Jellicoe at Jutland. In 1903 he conducted the world's first anti-submarine exercises, developing many of the counter-measures used in the world wars, including those involving depth charges and nets. His refusal to come into harbour for Christmas earned him the sobriquet Old 'ard 'eart from the lower deck. Regarded by many, including John Fisher, as the pre-eminent fleet commander of the era, Wilson was an arch centralizer, who allowed his subordinates no latitude. He imposed the highest standards of seamanship, but expected his captains and junior flag officers to obey without question. Even as first sea lord he could not resist using the new wireless telegraph to control the movements of a fleet from Whitehall during the 1910 manoeuvres. Before he hauled down his flag in March 1907 Wilson received the GCVO (1906), the GCB (1906), and promotion to admiral of the fleet. In November 1907, building on experiments he had conducted in 1906 with his gunnery lieutenant, Frederick Dreyer, he directed the trials of Arthur Pollen's innovative computerized fire control system, which he rejected as imperfect, too complicated, and too expensive. Although it came at a time when he had retired, his promotion to admiral of the fleet kept him on the active list until 1912.<br>
<br>In January 1910 Wilson was appointed first sea lord in an attempt to heal the divisions within the service created by John Fisher's controversial regime. He took the post with reluctance. The complex political demands of the Admiralty were not congenial to a man bred for the quarter-deck, and long used to having the final word. He found Whitehall a severe trial, lacking the interpersonal skills, political sensitivity, and sheer pleasure in strife that marked his predecessor. While he pushed through important work on the war orders, minesweeping, and other technical issues he lacked the breadth of vision to stamp his personality and opinions on the service. Never happy in his new position, Wilson was exposed as unsuitable by his disastrous performance at a meeting of the committee of imperial defence on 23 August 1911. The global blue-water strategic ideas that Wilson expressed at the meeting were based on long experience, and offered the only programme whereby Britain could hope to exert any influence on European politics at a time when the other powers all possessed million-man armies. However, his poor performance in debate gave the upper hand to a more articulate, if devious, Henry Wilson and the army general staff. This led to the effective adoption of a &#145;continental&#146; military strategy by the Asquith ministry, in defiance of experience, logic, and the national interest. After this failure the first lord (Reginald McKenna) and Sir Arthur Wilson had to be removed. McKenna was replaced by Churchill, who was sent to the Admiralty to introduce a naval staff, push through other reforms, and ensure co-operation with the army. Wilson's position had become impossible, and Churchill dismissed him in December 1911. Although he had the support of several naval officers on the board, Wilson had to go. He left office with little regret; having taken it up without enthusiasm he saw his early retirement as a blessing. Once again he retired to his sister's house in Swaffham. He was awarded the OM in 1912, but declined a peerage. He remained involved with the service, for he had had no other interest in his life, being unmarried and strikingly austere in his personal habits. In late October 1914 Churchill summoned him back to the Admiralty to assist his old colleague, Fisher, who was once again first sea lord. Despite the antagonism of 1911 he accepted the offer, on condition he should have no official position, or salary. Despite his disinterested gesture he inevitably became enmeshed in the vicious political struggle between Churchill and Fisher, being placed on the list of people to be removed from the Admiralty if Fisher was to continue. Wilson's urging of offensive schemes in the North Sea, notably the capture of Heligoland, have been derided by many commentators, but the principles were correct, and with attention to the operational details they were worthwhile measures. When Fisher resigned in late May 1915 Wilson agreed to replace him, but only if Churchill continued in office; in the interval he acted as first sea lord, until Sir Henry Jackson took office. Thereafter Wilson devoted his time to staff duties, notably technical developments concerning submarines and anti-submarine warfare, areas in which he made an important contribution. He remained active until August 1918, when he went back to Beech Cottage, Swaffham, Norfolk. Having declined a baronetcy in 1912, in October 1919 he succeeded his brother as third baronet, a title his uncle had earned in 1857 at the capture of Delhi. After the war Wilson devoted himself to local work for returning former servicemen and other worthy causes, remaining active until a few days before his death from pneumonia at Beech Cottage, Swaffham, on 25 May 1921, still unmarried. He was buried in Swaffham church.<br>
<br>Arthur Wilson was a great seaman, and a masterly tactician. He, more than any other officer, symbolized the navy in the first decade of the century. His stern, full-bearded face was the popular image of an admiral. His early contribution to the development of the torpedo from a curious device to a serious weapon demonstrated his capacity for sustained technical effort, while his conduct under fire was astonishing, even in an age obsessed with the need for officers to remain &#145;cool&#146;. Unimpressed by outward show, titles, and possessions he lived and died a servant of the Royal Navy and the nation. While much of this can be attributed to his austere character, the twin influences of the navy and the church in his formative years had a powerful bearing on his development. His term as first sea lord brought an unfortunate end to a great career; it was a post that he was ill-suited to fill, exposing as it did his political na&iuml;vety, inability to delegate or compromise, and limited administrative ability. He deserves to be remembered in his prime, commanding the great fleets of the Edwardian era, the fleets that upheld British pre-eminence at sea, and secured the world's greatest empire.<br>
