<span class="headword">Kelly,  Mary Elfreda</span>  (1888&#150;1951), <span class="occ">founder of the Village Drama Society</span>, was born on 25 March 1888 at Salcombe vicarage, Devon, the second of the four children of the Revd Maitland Kelly (1842&#150;1929), from 1900 squire of Kelly, Devon, and his second wife, Elfreda Blanche Carey (<i>d</i>. 1891). After her mother's death Ella Carey, her aunt, acted as housekeeper and mother to the younger children. Mary spent a happy childhood at Kelly House&#151;&#145;filled with sunshine, green grass and blue skies&#146;  (Kelly, 183)&#151;as one of the &#145;Little Ones&#146;, who looked upon their six stepsiblings more or less as adults. Educated at home by a governess until the age of sixteen, Mary then attended school at The Halsteads, East Sheen. It is believed that at some time during the 1920s she attended art school. During the First World War she worked as a cook in a VAD hospital in Exeter and then at the War Office as a clerk. She loved London, where her intellect was stimulated. After the war she returned home to Kelly House, where in 1918 she founded the Village Drama Society (VDS).<br>
<br>Mary Kelly began the VDS at home, where there had been family theatricals since Victorian days. A little bored as a pampered young gentrywoman, yet also conscious of the democratic upheaval that came in the wake of the war, she now endeavoured to include local people in such activities. She developed plans for a Kelly Dramatic Society, which should include all the people in the parish, of whatever class or age. But there was a specific potential that she wanted to develop. The Revd Hugh Maitland and his wife had mounted a modest annual missionary festival in the parsonage garden. After the Maitlands left in 1905, the young Margaret and Dorothea Kelly continued it, moving it to Kelly House grounds and introducing a small pageant.<br>
<br>On 15 January 1919 Mary Kelly called a meeting to announce her plans. While some of the tenant farmers and their families were immediately enthusiastic, others were much less so. But the squire's social writ&#151;the Kelly estate comprised the whole parish: all the farmers were tenants&#151;ensured that the whole village pulled together. Quite soon, the dramatic society established itself as something of a community.<br>
<br>Mary Kelly wrote a <span class="roman">Bible</span> story play, <span class="italic">Joseph</span>, which was performed on Ascension day 1919. Impressed by the emergence of talent from unexpected places, she went on to write and mount such plays each Ascensiontide, eventually moving the performances into the tithe barn. Maitland Kelly directed that a stage be built there. Emphatically Christian as well as communal in emphasis, the annual event&#151;which included a special service and a feast&#151;raised &pound;100 per annum for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel medical mission that Mary's sister Ursula and her husband, Frank Drewe, had established at Holy Cross, Pondoland, in southern Africa.<br>
<br>Mary Kelly's religious plays&#151;she wrote others&#151;were written around the village players, to suit their own characteristics. They adhered to their Devon dialect. An ethos of simple dignity was maintained. Gradually the Kelly play became famous, especially for its simplicity and the sincerity of the players. Leonard and Dorothy Elmhirst, who arrived at Dartington in 1925, were friends and regular visitors, bringing a crowd with them.<br>
<br>The idea of the Village Drama Society was to encourage similar experimentation in other villages. Visits by the Kelly players indeed encouraged other societies to form, and Mary was soon busy fielding requests for advice. Kelly being remote, she moved to Camberwell in the 1920s&#151;but returned to Kelly to produce the Ascensiontide play for seven or eight years. The society grew rapidly and Mary travelled the country speaking at Women's Institute meetings arguing for better drama&#151;but a mixed reception eventually made her decide to sever links with the institute. The VDS affiliated to the British Drama League (founded 1919), becoming absorbed by it in 1932. Mary continued to work for the league, and by 1939 over 600 village societies had formed.<br>
<br>Mary wrote and produced pageants at Selborne (1926), Rillington (1927), Bradstone (1929), Launceston (1931), Bude, and Exeter Cathedral (&#145;The Pitifull Queene&#146;, 1932). The Selborne play dramatized parts of Gilbert White's <span class="italic">Antiquities</span> and letters, to evoke and construct an easeful, gentrified village summer. &#145;The Pitifull Queene&#146; dealt with Henrietta Maria. Her major emphasis elsewhere is on the life of common folk, sometimes, as at the opening of the Rillington drama, achieving a domestic focus centred on women and children. The Launceston pageant sharply dramatized the distinct cultural and racial identity of the Cornish. Bradstone is the tiny hamlet neighbouring Kelly. As the squire's daughter, Mary could for this event forgo the business of financial guarantees that beset most pageant makers. Her father had a grandstand built. The bishop of Exeter attended.<br>
<br>Mary handled the pageant form distinctively and well. In <span class="italic">How to Make a Pageant</span> (1936) she drew on her own experiences and her witnessing of similar events in other countries to argue for its reform. By then an outmoded cultural form, characterized by apathy, embarrassment, and at best a vague sense of nationhood, the pageant had, she argued, the potential to show &#145;the slow unfolding and growth of ideal which history reveals&#146;, &#145;the conflict between the individual and the mass&#146;, so that &#145;the raw crowds [of performers] will lose all self-consciousness and be lifted together into a strongly felt and sincerely acted emotion&#146;  (pp. 6&#150;9). The coexistence in the ostensibly &#145;non-political&#146; Kelly of royalist sentiment on the one hand and enthusiastically progressive&#151;to some extent democratic&#151;impulses on the other was not unusual in the inter-war period.<br>
<br>Mary Kelly's early success with village drama depended on much more than her class and her father's power. It rested on her good nature and her enthusiasm. Roy Johns (<i>b</i>. 1913), who got involved aged six along with his tenant-farmer father, Abel, and played for the Kelly Drama Society into the 1950s, recalled both her intellect and her &#145;wonderful sense of humour&#146;. She involved herself fully in the village and insisted that any member might chair a meeting of the society. This outgoing woman, who could readily drop into dialect, was so well liked that &#145;people couldn't refuse her&#146;. Plump, homely, and physically comfortable, she laughed easily, her laughter moving both her whole body and then others to laughter.<br>
<br>Between the wars Kelly House filled again with children, as nephews and nieces from two families moved back from Africa. Mary loved and understood the younger generation, and took especial care of her godson Michael. His wife, Margery, who arrived at Kelly in 1937 recalled Mary as lively, full of fun, artistic, and a rebel: &#145;There was a rather outrageous occasion when she used face powder! Ye Gods!&#146;  (private information). To all the younger generation at Kelly she was fun and a great friend. Her stepsister Margaret praised the way she continued working despite ill health, and overcame all obstacles; but also noted that she did not suffer fools gladly. Of her various publications&#151;including plays and pageants, <span class="italic">On English Costume</span> (1932), and <span class="italic">Group Play Making</span> (1948)&#151;the most significant are <span class="italic">How to Make a Pageant</span> (1936) and <span class="italic">Village Theatre</span> (1939). &#145;The book of the Kellys&#146; (1954) is an unpublished family history researched by Mary and completed by her stepsister Margaret.<br>
<br>When war broke out in 1939, Mary Kelly moved back to the south-west to live in Exeter and to work for the drama and music committee of the Devon education department, visiting schools in the county. However, following two major operations, she retired and moved to South Africa later in 1939 to join her great friend Joanna Elder at Kokstad, East Griqualand. There she painted and helped both Africans and Europeans with their drama. On 9 June 1949 she was appointed OBE for her services to the British Drama League. Her life was again full of interest; but she fell ill and was hospitalized with dysentery, and while convalescing died suddenly on 5 November 1951 at Ikopo, Natal. At her memorial service in 1951 Ian Kelway, who succeeded Mary as Devon county drama adviser, declared that it was she &#145;who began again to give back to the ordinary village people what was their birthright&#146; by reviving village drama  (private information).<br>
