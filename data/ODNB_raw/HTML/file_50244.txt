<span class="headword">Phelip,  William</span>, Baron Bardolf  (1383/4&#150;1441), <span class="occ">nobleman and soldier</span>, was the son and heir of Sir William Phelip of Dennington, Suffolk (<i>d</i>. 1407) and his wife, Juliana, daughter of Sir Robert Erpingham of Erpingham, Norfolk. His early political career was shaped by his close association with his maternal uncle, Sir Thomas Erpingham, a leading figure at court and in East Anglia after 1399. Phelip entered the service of Thomas Beaufort, duke of Exeter, with whom Erpingham was closely connected, and who was the leading magnate in East Anglia from 1405 when he was granted the Norfolk estates forfeited by Thomas, Lord Bardolf, because of his involvement in the Scrope rebellion. It was presumably through Beaufort's influence that Phelip married Joan (1390&#150;1447), younger daughter and coheir of Lord Bardolf, by June 1408.<br>
<br>Their connections with Erpingham and Beaufort led Phelip and his younger brother John into royal service under Henry IV, and both rose to greater prominence under Henry V. Both fought in the French campaign of 1415; John Phelip died at Harfleur, but William went on to serve at Agincourt. He spent the years from 1417 to 1422 mostly in France, and served as captain of Harfleur from July 1421 to November 1422. He had been knighted in 1413, and became a knight of the Garter in 1418. From October 1421 until November 1422 he also held office as treasurer of Henry V's household. This eminence in central government continued under Henry VI; Phelip was appointed to the royal council in May 1432, and became chamberlain of the king's household in November of that year, appointments that he held until his death.<br>
<br>Phelip's influence in East Anglia was also increasing. He was MP for Suffolk in both parliaments of 1414; he became a regular member of the peace commission in Suffolk from 1423, and in Norfolk from 1429, and served on a wide variety of other local commissions. The childless deaths of Beaufort in 1426 and Erpingham in 1428 offered Phelip the opportunity, as Erpingham's heir and Beaufort's chief executor, to take their place at the head of the broad political connection that had developed under their leadership in East Anglia since 1399. However, the farm of the Bardolf estates which Beaufort had held was secured in 1431 not by Phelip but by William de la Pole, earl of Suffolk (1396&#150;1450), who was seeking to establish his own regional lordship after his return from France in 1430.<br>
<br>Phelip had, with Erpingham, held the custody of Suffolk's lands during his minority from 1415 to 1418, but there is little evidence of further association between Phelip and Suffolk in a local context in the years immediately after the earl's return to England. Their respective authorities seem to have developed in parallel until 1437, when a series of manoeuvres resulted in an accommodation which allowed their regional interests to be assimilated into a single political connection. In November 1437 Suffolk surrendered his farm of the Bardolf lands in Norfolk so that a hereditary grant could finally be made to Phelip; two days later Phelip surrendered the lordship of Swaffham in Norfolk, the farm of which he had recently acquired, so that it could be granted to Suffolk. Phelip had therefore succeeded in recovering his wife's inheritance, in recognition of which he was thereafter styled Baron Bardolf, while Suffolk's regional authority had been safeguarded. Accommodation was again reached between Suffolk and Phelip in the reorganization of the duchy of Lancaster administration in the same year; the earl became chief steward of the north parts of the duchy, and Phelip was granted the equivalent office in the south.<br>
<br>Phelip died on 6 June 1441, and was buried at Dennington, as was his wife, who died six years later. Their only child, Elizabeth, wife of John Beaumont, Viscount Beaumont, died shortly after her father (certainly by October 1441). Her heir was her son William, during whose minority Beaumont had custody of the estates.<br>
