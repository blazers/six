<span class="headword">Prence,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1600&#150;1673), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born about 1600, the son of Thomas Prence (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1630), carriage maker, of Lechlade, Gloucestershire. The younger Thomas Prence emigrated to New Plymouth in 1621 aboard the <i>Fortune</i> and resided in the colony towns of Plymouth, Duxbury, and Eastham. While the New World offered immigrants unusual opportunities for improving their lot, few rose as high from undistinguished origins as did Prence. Within six years of his arrival he was chosen as one of eight &#145;undertakers&#146; responsible for discharging the colony's debt in exchange for exclusive rights to American Indian trade. He later joined William Bradford and others in a lucrative partnership in a trading post on Maine's Kennebec River. In 1632 he joined the colony's government through election as an assistant, and he served as either assistant or governor of the colony every year thereafter until his death.<br>
<br>Undoubtedly Prence's marriages to daughters of leading settlers propelled his own rise to prominence. S. E. Morison declared that Prence showed a &#145;genius for marrying&#146; well  (Morison, 172). On 5 August 1624 he married Patience Brewster (<i>d</i>. 1634), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3376/', "William Brewster")</script>, Plymouth's ruling elder and the most learned man in the colony. Thomas and Patience had four children, Rebecca, Thomas, Hannah, and Mercy. Patience died in 1634, and on 1 April 1635 he married Mary Collier (<i>d</i>. in or before 1644), daughter of wealthy settler William Collier. Their children were Jane and Mary. There has been some confusion about his remaining marriages and children, but in 1904 Ella Florence Elliot determined that Prence had married not three but four times and that his last two wives were Apphia Quick, the divorced wife of Samuel Freeman, and Mary Howes (<i>d</i>. 1695), the widow of Thomas Howes. It remains unclear whether Prence's youngest daughters, Judith, Elizabeth, and Sarah, were the children of his second or third marriages.<br>
<br>No record exists of any formal education for Prence, a deficit he felt keenly. Cotton Mather declared that &#145;the want and worth of <i>Acquired Parts</i> was a thing so sensible unto [Prence], that <i>Plymouth</i> perhaps never had a greater <i>Maecenas</i> of <i>Learning</i> in it&#146;  (Mather, 2.2.209). Like his first father-in-law, he amassed a sizeable library, valued at over &pound;214 at probate. In addition, he left funds to be used for grammar schools to teach &#145;humane learning, and good literature&#146;  (ibid., n.).<br>
<br>As governor, an office he filled in 1634, 1638, and from 1657 to 1672, Prence tightened laws restricting Quaker worship and backed legislation mandating town financial support of Congregational ministers. These actions may account for the characterization of him as &#145;a terror to evil doers&#146; by a contemporary  (Morison, 172). He showed similar severity in dealing with a threatened Indian uprising in 1671. He ordered confiscation of all Indian arms and imposed a fine of &pound;100 on the Wampanoag sachem Philip (Metacom), a humiliation and hardship that, some historians believe, contributed significantly to the sachem's instigation of King Philip's War four years later. In addition to his service as governor and assistant, he was a commissioner for the United Colonies of New England in 1645, 1650, 1653&#150;8, 1661&#150;3, and 1670&#150;72. He died in New Plymouth on 29 March 1673, and was buried there on 8 April, leaving an estate of &pound;422, in addition to over 300 acres of land throughout Plymouth Colony.<br>
