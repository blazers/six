<span class="headword">Anderton,  William</span>  (1663&#150;1693), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was born at Wakefield, Yorkshire, on 29 September 1663, the son of William Anderton (<i>d</i>. 1671), a clothier (who claimed kinship with the Lancashire gentry Andertons), and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>fl</i>. 1660&#150;1693), daughter of Maximilian Topham; he was baptized at All Saints' Church in Wakefield on 14 October. He had a brother and at least two sisters. The parents, strong Anglicans, intended him for the church, but his father's early death (after which his mother married Thomas Ross) greatly reduced the family fortunes. After education at Wakefield grammar school, Anderton had himself bound apprentice on 9 February 1680 to the London printer Thomas Snowden, also from Wakefield. However, after the nonconformist Snowden had persistently beaten him for his loyalty to Anglicanism, the remainder of his indentures was transferred to the more congenial Miles Flesher or Fletcher. Freed in 1687, Anderton became a first-class journeyman printer, and married. He and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1725?), had three daughters.<br>
<br>Anderton's enemy Robert &#145;Hog&#146; Stephens, messenger of the press, claimed at Anderton's later trial that Anderton had had a Jacobite press from 1691, and mentioned having earlier seized his equipment: Anderton was presumably therefore the Thomas Topham alias William Anderson whose press Stephens seized in Shoreditch in early June 1692. Anderton (evidently financed by others) then set up a press, where two journeymen assisted him, in a secret room at Scudamore's, a carpenter in St James's Street, Westminster, while posing as a lapidary called Williams&#151;Jacobite printing was then audaciously concentrating in London's &#145;Court End&#146;. David Douglas, formerly glovemaker to James II's queen, set up another in Peter Street, Westminster, employing four printers. Charles Leslie transferred the production of his <span class="italic">Answer</span> to Dr William King, the most important factual Jacobite propaganda piece of the decade, from the main Jacobite printer, John Redmayne, to these two presses: Anderton's share included the detailed appendices.<br>
<br>However, the government's alarm at the increase in effective Jacobite pamphleteering led to a crackdown that autumn. The chief victim, Mrs Anne Merryweather, main intermediary between Redmayne and his distributors, was convicted at the Old Bailey sessions in January 1693 for high treason but was reprieved.<br>
<br>After Leslie's <span class="italic">Answer</span> appeared early in 1693, the new whig secretary of state, Sir John Trenchard, launched a more intensive attack on the Jacobite printing organization. Leslie himself was arrested but escaped; he might otherwise have suffered rather than Anderton. Stephens, with Stationers' Company assistance, arrested Anderton, despite his wife's and mother's protests, on 2 May 1693 in Scudamore's house. Copies of thirty-two pamphlets, including Leslie's <span class="italic">Answer</span>, were seized. Because one anonymous pamphlet virulently attacking William III's generalship and courage, <span class="italic">Remarks upon the Present Confederacy</span> (perhaps by the nonjuror John Pitts), was used in Anderton's subsequent indictment, the printer has often groundlessly been called its author. Many of the pamphlets had been brought from other printers for easier mixed distribution, particularly Charlwood Lawton's <span class="italic">A French Conquest neither Desirable nor Practicable</span> from Douglas's press (which was seized on 1 June).<br>
<br>Anderton was at first committed only for misdemeanour, but ministerial attitudes hardened after copies of James II's new <span class="italic">Declaration</span>, promising major concessions, were scattered through London on 21&#150;22 May, and they realized that Lawton's pamphlet had been its precursor. Anderton was indicted for high treason for printing the <span class="italic">Remarks</span> and <span class="italic">French Conquest</span>.<br>
<br>Anderton was tried at the Old Bailey on 3 June 1693 before Lord Chief Justice Sir George Treby and other judges. His legal arguments, drawn up by a pro-Jacobite lawyer, Daniel Thornbury, were that printing, as a post-medieval invention, could not be treason under Edward III's statute (ignoring the precedent provided by the 1664 case of the printer John Twyn); as a mechanical activity, could not prove the necessary malicious intent; and was allotted lesser punishments by recent statutes. Since the factual evidence, though strong, was circumstantial, Stephens invented insults by Anderton against the king; and Snowden and another hostile dissenting printer testified falsely that the same printing type had been used in both pamphlets. Treby and another judge led, and finally bullied, the jury into convicting Anderton. Further legal arguments were dismissed, and Anderton was condemned on 8 June. Luttrell's report that he offered to confess was presumably merely a sop to public unease. Trenchard, issuing many more warrants, wrote that examples were needed; and Mrs Anderton's and others' appeals to the queen and council were rebuffed. Anderton was executed on 16 June 1693 at Tyburn, dying as a nonjuring Anglican. Samuel Grascome, nonjuring cleric and, as a Jacobite pamphleteer, an employer, may have attended on him. Quartering the body was remitted, and Anderton was buried the same day in St Bartholomew-the-Less churchyard, Smithfield. He left a paper for publication, arguing that the injustice at his trial epitomized the general oppressions of William's regime. Grascome's accusatory pamphlet <span class="italic">An Appeal of Murther</span> gave the only detailed report of the trial. The government offensive petered out that autumn.<br>
<br>Of four persons condemned for treason for printing or publishing in William's reign, all in 1692&#150;3, Anderton alone, ironically, had not been involved with James's <span class="italic">Declarations</span>. Not, as sometimes claimed, the only person convicted for high treason purely for printing, he was the only printer executed for it between Twyn in 1664 and (under a later law) John Matthews in 1719.<br>
