<span class="headword">Tod,  James</span>  (1782&#150;1835), <span class="occ">army and political officer in India</span>, born at Islington on 19 March 1782 and baptized there on 5 May, was the son of James Tod (<i>b</i>. 1745), and his wife, Mary, the daughter of Andrew Heatly, a Scot who settled at Rhode Island. He was educated in Scotland. In 1798 his uncle, Patrick Heatly, procured him an East Indian cadetship, and, after training at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, he went (March 1799) to Bengal, arriving on 26 August; he was posted to the 2nd European regiment (ensign's commission dated 9 January 1800). After volunteering for service with Lord Wellesley's projected expedition to the Moluccas, he served for a short time with the marines on board the <i>Mornington</i>. Appointed on 29 May 1800 lieutenant in the 14th Bengal infantry, he went up country; in 1801, when stationed at Delhi, he was ordered to survey an old canal in the neighbourhood. In 1805 he was attached to the escort sent with his friend Graeme Mercer, envoy and resident at Sindhia's court. While travelling with the maharaja's camp, and afterwards from 1812 to 1817 when it remained at Gwalior, he was constantly surveying or collecting topographical information. In 1815 he submitted a map to the governor-general (Lord Hastings), in which for the first time the term &#145;central India&#146; was applied to the Indian states later under the central India agency. Rajputana was also included in the area of his researches. He wrote:<blockquote>Though I never penetrated personally further into the heart of the Indian desert than Mundore &hellip; my parties of discovery have traversed it in every direction, adding to their journals of routes living testimonies of their accuracy, and bringing to me natives of every <i>t'hul</i> from Bhutnair to Omurkote and from Aboo to Arore. The journals of all these routes, with others from Central and Western India, form eleven moderate-sized folio volumes. (Tod, <span class="italic">Annals of Rajasthan</span>, 2, 1832, 289)</blockquote>Most of Tod's extra salary was spent in paying his Indian explorers. In October 1813 he was promoted captain, with command of the resident's escort; and in October 1815 the resident, Richard Strachey, nominated him second assistant.<br>
<br>When Lord Hastings, in 1817, began operations against the Pindaris, Tod's local knowledge became invaluable. He had already sent in reports on the Pindaris and plans of a campaign, and on volunteering for service was sent to Rowtah in Haraoti, where he organized and superintended an intelligence department, which in the governor-general's opinion contributed significantly to the success of the campaign. He also induced the regent of Kotah to capture and surrender to the British officers the wives and children of the leading Pindari chiefs.<br>
<br>In 1818, after the chiefs of Rajputana had accepted the protective alliance offered to them, Tod was appointed by the governor-general political agent in the western Rajput states, and was so successful in his efforts to restore peace and confidence that within less than a year some 300 deserted towns and villages were repeopled, trade revived, and, in spite of the abolition of transit duties and the reduction of frontier customs, the state revenue had reached an unprecedented amount. During the next five years Tod earned the respect of the chiefs and people, and was able to rescue more than one princely family, including that of the ranas of Udaipur, from the destitution to which they had been reduced by Maratha raiders. Bishop Heber, who travelled through Rajputana in February 1825, was told that the country had never known prosperity until Tod came, and that everyone, rich or poor, except thieves or Pindaris, loved him. According to Heber, because Tod so favoured Indian princes, the Calcutta government suspected him of corruption, and consequently limited his powers and associated other officers with him until he was disgusted and resigned; but the government later came to believe its suspicions were groundless. However, ill health was the reason given for Tod's retirement in June 1822, though it did not prevent his journeying to Bombay by the circuitous route described in <span class="italic">Travels in Western India</span>, published after his death.<br>
<br>Tod left Bombay for England in February 1823, and never returned. The rest of his life was mostly spent in arranging and publishing the immense mass of materials accumulated during his Indian career. He also acted for a time as librarian to the Royal Asiatic Society, before which he read several papers on his favourite subjects. According to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, &#145;to him also belongs the praise of having initiated the study of Indo-Grecian antiquities&#146;  (204). On 1 May 1824 he was promoted major, on 2 June 1826 lieutenant-colonel, being retransferred to the 2nd European infantry, and on 28 June 1825 he retired from the service. On 16 November 1826 he married Julia (1808/9&#150;1850), third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5725/', "Henry Clutterbuck MD")</script>, a London physician, and they had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Thenceforth Tod lived much on the continent, and in 1827 visited Comte de Boigne, Sindhia's old general, at Chamb&eacute;ry. Tod published archaeological papers in the Royal Asiatic Society's <span class="italic">Transactions</span>; a paper on the politics of western India, appended to the report of the House of Commons committee on Indian affairs, 1833; <span class="italic">Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan</span> (1829&#150;32); and <span class="italic">Travels in Western India</span> (1839), with an anonymous memoir of Tod.<br>
<br>In September 1835 Tod bought a house in Regent's Park, London, and on 16 November, his wedding anniversary, while transacting business at his banker's, Robarts &amp; Co., in Lombard Street, had an apoplectic stroke from which he never recovered. He died at Regent's Park on 18 November 1835, aged fifty-three, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
