</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wharton, Sir  George</span>, first baronet  (1617&#150;1681), <span class="occ">astrologer and royalist</span>, was born on 4 April 1617 at Strickland, near Kirkby Kendal in Westmorland, the son of George Wharton, a blacksmith and small farmer. He was descended, as Anthony Wood notes, &#145;from an antient and genteel family&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4, col. 6), probably the Whartons of Kirkby Thore. His father died while Wharton was still a small child and he inherited an estate of about &pound;50 a year; he was brought up by two uncles, William and Cuthbert Wharton. He spent some time at Oxford in 1633 studying mathematics and astronomy, but finding logic and philosophy of little appeal returned home without matriculating. By 1641 he had moved to Bishop Auckland, near Durham, where he appears to have had relatives. He published his first almanac for that year, with help from William Milbourne, curate of nearby Brancepeth, and perhaps also from the parson&#150;astrologer John Vaux of St Helen Auckland. It appeared under the pseudonym Naworth, which he adopted to prevent the common people accounting him a conjuror.<br>
<br>Wharton's first two almanacs were bland productions, partly because the censors suppressed his prophecies about the Scots. On the outbreak of the civil war he moved to Oxford, where he was appointed a gentleman clerk of the ordnance office. In this capacity he saw action at the battles of Edgehill and Brainford in 1642. In his spare time he pursued his mathematical studies at Queen's College, and according to Wood might have been made MA had he not neglected the opportunity. In 1645 he made the acquaintance of Elias Ashmole, recently appointed to the ordnance office, who was to become a close friend and protector. Other friends included the natural philosopher Richard Rawlinson, fellow of Queen's, the physician Charles Scarburgh, and Edward Sherburne of the ordnance office, and he was clearly on the fringe of the scientific circle then flourishing in Oxford. It may also have been during these years that he married Anne Butler, with whom he had four sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Wharton quickly emerged as the foremost royalist astrologer, producing polemical almanacs at Oxford with the king's blessing. These drew him into fierce battles with his parliamentarian rivals, John Booker and William Lilly. In the edition for 1644, composed in October 1643, he denied that the recent conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter heralded the overthrow of monarchy and damned Booker for hinting at the fall of the &#145;man of three letters&#146;, which some had interpreted as &#145;rex&#146;, or King Charles. Wharton retorted that &#145;Pym&#146; fitted equally well, and predicted the parliamentary leader John Pym's speedy death&#151;a prophecy fulfilled even before the almanac appeared in print. Booker replied in <span class="italic">Mercurius Coelicus</span> (1644), dismissing &#145;No-worth&#146; as a &#145;court parasite&#146; with sinister popish and Irish connections. Wharton penned an abusive reply, <span class="italic">Mercurio-Coelico mastix</span>, within six hours of reading Booker's squib, and published it with an annotated reprint of <span class="italic">Mercurius Coelicus</span>. For the following year, 1645, he issued two almanacs, one as Naworth, the other under his own name with a fierce assault on the &#145;impudent and senseless&#146; writings of Lilly, which Lilly later admitted hurt him deeply. In May 1645 Wharton published <span class="italic">An Astrologicall Judgement on his Majesties Present March</span>, predicting that Charles would be victorious in his new military campaign. Lilly's <span class="italic">Starry Messenger</span> (1645) gave a diametrically opposite reading and contained a &#145;Postscript&#146; rebutting Wharton's prediction. Naseby gave the victory to Lilly.<br>
<br>On 8 March 1645 Wharton was commissioned a captain of horse, raising his troop by selling his estate in Westmorland. He fought in a number of actions before sharing in the crushing defeat under Sir Jacob Astley at Stow in March 1646, where he was wounded. There was no almanac for 1646, probably because he was too busy fighting. His credibility had also suffered, and one pamphleteer later claimed he had been driven out of Oxford before its surrender in July 1646. There does seem a personal edge to Wharton's bitter remark in 1647 that every honourable man at court had found himself &#145;despised &hellip; by the Parasiticall Faction&#146;  (<span class="italic">No Merline, nor Mercurie but a New Almanacke</span>, sig. B3). After the fall of Oxford he found refuge with a royalist squire in Yorkshire, before making his way to London later in the year. There he published on his own account a defiant almanac for 1647. It contained an entire section devoted to vitriolic abuse of Lilly, whom he challenged to submit their differences for adjudication by Charles Scarburgh, Jonas Moore, and Vincent Wing. He renewed the attack in <span class="italic">Merlini Anglici errata</span> (1647), a medley of astrological, political, and personal abuse. Wharton's belligerent royalism was unshaken by the king's defeat. He mocked Booker's <span class="italic">Bloody Irish Almanack</span> (1646), which predicted the impending devastation of Ireland, by celebrating the Irish Catholics' continuing success. In his remarkable <span class="italic">Bellum Hybernicale</span>, published in December 1646, he openly justified the rebellion of 1641 on the grounds of the Irish people's long history of repression, and suggested that the English and Scots were at least equally to blame for the massacres. This pamphlet, with his almanac for 1648, prompted the House of Commons on 25 September 1647 to order his arrest, though he evaded capture for a further six months.<br>
<br>Following the civil war Wharton lived on the meagre earnings from his pamphleteering and help from Ashmole and other friends. In the late summer of 1647 he was struck down by plague, and, though he survived, a pseudonymous pamphleteer described finding him poverty-stricken and unkempt, &#145;all greasy and beastly&#146;  (Col. Th.&#151;, 12). On regaining his health he embarked on a precarious new career editing royalist newspapers. <span class="italic">Mercurius Elencticus</span>, a weekly launched on 5 November 1647, combined cavalier propaganda with attacks on old astrological rivals, and developed to become one of the leading cavalier titles. Wharton used it to attack Independents and levellers, and on the execution of the king he boldly proclaimed his son as Charles II. It survived until November 1649 before falling victim to the fierce new censorship law. During this period Wharton also continued to publish his almanacs. Rather optimistically he agreed to write an uncontroversial almanac for 1648 for the Company of Stationers. Some of them passed a draft to Booker, however, who as licenser decided to suppress it. Wharton, furious, responded by publishing an unauthorized edition in which he abused the company, predicted the king's recovery, and proclaimed Laud a martyr. After months on the run he was at last betrayed, and arrested in bed on 13 March 1648. His books and papers were confiscated, and after being grilled by a parliamentary committee he was left to rot in Newgate, where he remained until contriving an escape on 26 August. Remarkably, he was able to publish a new almanac for 1649, drafted in prison and completed four days after his escape, which he dedicated defiantly to Charles I.<br>
<br>Wharton was deeply shocked by the king's execution in January 1649. He gave an emotional account in his newspaper, while his almanac for 1650 lashed out at the parliamentary leaders as &#145;the most prodigious Monsters that ever the Earth groaned under&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hemeroscopeion</span>, 1650, 19), and threatened them with execution and hell-fire. This attack led to his rearrest in November 1649. Examined before the council of state on suspicion of treason and committed to the Gatehouse, he expected to be hanged, the fate that John Bradshaw, head of the court established to try leading royalists, apparently intended for him. He owed his life, unexpectedly, to his old enemy Lilly, who at Ashmole's request interceded with the council of state through his friend Sir Bulstrode Whitelocke and secured Wharton's release on 2 February 1650, on Wharton's promise to write no more against the state. His release prompted rumours that he had betrayed his cavalier friends, a charge he vigorously denied. His almanac for 1651, published by the Company of Stationers, supplied his own version of events and acknowledged Lilly's help.<br>
<br>Free but destitute, Wharton was saved when Ashmole generously offered him the use of his house at Bradfield in Berkshire. Wharton helped with estate matters, but spent most of his time pursuing his studies. At Ashmole's suggestion he translated and published a work on chiromancy by Johannes Rothman, claiming it as the first such work ever to appear in England. He embarked too on a translation of Ptolemy's astrological writings, though this was never completed. He continued to publish almanacs, often sailing very close to the wind. He was arrested again briefly in September 1651, when Ashmole stood bail for him. In his almanac for 1653 (published in the autumn of 1652) he boldly predicted that the new republic was sick and about to die. The council of state responded on 1 November 1652 by ordering his arrest once more. Thereafter he dropped political predictions, though he still found other ways to signal his political views.<br>
<br>Wharton's almanac for 1654 caused different problems. He had quarrelled with the Company of Stationers over its refusal to pay a &pound;20 fee still due for his 1653 almanac, so he sold his copy for the 1654 edition privately, flouting the company's monopoly. On 20 September 1653 the company secured a warrant to seize and destroy the whole impression as seditious; it seized 5000 copies and produced its own counterfeit edition. Wharton thereupon sued in the Guildhall for his unpaid fee. His suit was checked when he refused to take the engagement, but on resuming it the company hastily settled out of court. Wharton produced another independent almanac for 1655 and returned to the quarrel in <span class="italic">Apotelesma</span> (1655), which denounced the greedy &#145;Monopolizing Stationers&#146;. The later 1650s saw an uneasy truce between Wharton and the company, whose name did not appear on his title-pages. In <span class="italic">Apotelesma</span> he also hit out at the government once more, predicting the imminent downfall of those &#145;ruling by Tyranny and Oppression, new Conquerors and Usurpers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Apotelesma</span>, 26). Not surprisingly, he was among the cavaliers rounded up in 1655. Arrested at Bradfield on 16 June he was sent prisoner to Windsor Castle, where he remained until the following spring. He compiled his almanac for 1656 in prison, dubbing it his &#145;Windsor Recreations&#146;. Wharton continued to smear the regime by innuendo. Sheltering behind the proposal to make Cromwell king he felt free to commend monarchy, using carefully drafted verses undoubtedly meant as Stuart propaganda. He came under suspicion once more over the royalist assassination plot for which Dr John Hewitt was executed in June 1658. After the fall of the protectorate he at once ridiculed the Cromwellians, and he attempted to annex the phrase the &#145;Good Old Cause&#146; for the cavaliers.<br>
<br>From the early 1650s Wharton gave less prominence to predictions, offering instead essays on historical computation, the nature of comets, and astrological methodology. The &#145;Chronology&#146; or table of events, always a key feature of his titles, he used to provide a partisan record of events since 1640. From 1657 it became a separate section as &#145;Gesta Britannorum&#146;, extended back to 1600 and explicitly designed to recall the miseries and follies of recent times. Wharton always insisted that he wrote only for educated and loyal readers. In the 1650s many of his almanacs, unusually, carried dedications to friends and patrons, among them John Robinson, later lord mayor and lieutenant of the Tower, his kinsman Thomas Wharton, physician and anatomist, and William Backhouse, both friends of Ashmole with astrological and alchemical interests. Wharton showed his own interest in the occult sciences by transcribing the fifteenth-century alchemist George Ripley's <span class="italic">Cantalena</span>, at Ashmole's request, and by his preface to Richard Saunders's work on physiognomy and chiromancy, his notes on Hermes Trismegistus, and an exposition of the &#145;Cabal of the Twelve Houses Astrologicall&#146;, printed in his almanac for 1659 with an admiring comment from William Oughtred. Noah Bridges, an authority on cipher and shorthand, was another friend.<br>
<br>Wharton continued to write almanacs after the Restoration, dedicating his edition for 1661 to the new king. In September 1660 he was also made licenser for almanacs, turning the tables on his former rivals, though the post lapsed under the <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span> of 1662. In 1661 his almanac verses were reprinted as <span class="italic">Select and Choice Poems</span>. His almanacs did not offer astrological predictions, except of the weather, and the &#145;Gesta&#146; replaced the traditional &#145;Prognostication&#146;. They remained highly partisan, however, and the final edition (for 1666) contained a jingoistic diatribe against the Dutch.<br>
<br>Wharton's life after the Restoration gradually led him away from journalism. In 1660 he was reappointed as gentleman clerk in the ordnance office, with lodgings in the Tower, and he appears to have been an effective public servant. On the death of William Legg, lieutenant of the ordnance, he was appointed in November 1670 to a newly created post as treasurer and paymaster of the ordnance, with a salary of &pound;400 and funds of &pound;200,000 to cover the ordnance needs of the army and navy. The office brought him considerable wealth. As a reward for his services and sufferings under two kings Wharton was created a baronet on 19 December 1677, an honour first mooted as early as 1663.<br>
<br>Though he published nothing in his later years, Wharton continued to pursue a variety of mathematical interests. His circle included Jonas Moore, Edward Sherburne, Robert Hooke, Richard Towneley, and Lord Brouncker. In 1675 his son and heir, Polycarpus, married Sherburne's niece. In 1680 the tory astrologer John Gadbury, an old acquaintance, begged his help when facing trial for complicity in the Popish Plot and Wharton, though ailing and crippled by gout, promptly wrote to the king on his behalf. Wharton died on 12 August 1681 at his house in Enfield, Middlesex, his family residence since at least the late 1660s. He was buried in the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula, in the Tower, on 25 August. Many of his publications, including sections from the almanacs, were reissued by Gadbury in <span class="italic">The Works of that most Excellent Philosopher and Astronomer, Sir George Wharton</span>, in 1683. All the evidence confirms Wood's portrait of him as a staunch cavalier, &#145;a boon companion, a witty droll and waggish poet&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4, col. 6).<br>
