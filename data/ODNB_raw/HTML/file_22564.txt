<span class="headword">Porter,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1621, <em>d.</em> 1683), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was baptized on 7 November 1621 at Hatfield, Hertfordshire, the eldest of five sons born to the courtier <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22562/', "Endymion Porter (1587&#150;1649)")</script> and his wife, Olive or Olivia (<i>d</i>. 1663), daughter of John Boteler, Baron Boteler of Brantfield. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22579/', "Thomas Porter")</script> was his brother. Some time in or before 1646 Porter married Diana, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11101/', "George Goring, first earl of Norwich")</script> (and sister of the royalist general <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11100/', "George Goring")</script>) and widow of Thomas Covert of Slaugham, Sussex. They had three sons and five daughters, including George, Aubrey, Edwin, Anne, and Olivia (who were mentioned in his will), and Mary (who married Philip Smyth, fourth Viscount Strangford). Porter, like his father, supported the king with enthusiasm at the start of the civil war in 1642. He was major-general of royalist cavalry on 21 March 1644, when he helped Prince Rupert and Lord Loughborough to relieve Newark. Next day he rode to Lincoln to strengthen the town's defences and then combined with John Belasyse in an unsuccessful attack on Bradford, deserting him at a crucial moment (25 March).<br>
<br>As Lord Goring's commissary-general of horse, Porter fought on the left wing in the duke of Newcastle's army at the battle of Marston Moor on 2 July, in which he was both wounded and captured. Imprisoned in the Tower, he was eventually exchanged by parliament on 2 December for Major Kerr, after lengthy negotiations. He was then appointed lieutenant-general of horse in Goring's army in the west of England, but failed to distinguish himself in the battle of Langport (10 July 1645). Goring, based on Ilminster, had sent Porter with three brigades towards Taunton as a decoy to distract the advancing New Model Army. Porter, however, allowed himself to be surprised and routed when he was &#145;in his utmost debauches with some of his officers&#146;  (Bulstrode, 136&#150;7) and his men were &#145;asleep, some a swimming and the rest carelessly walking in the fields&#146;  (Carte, 131). Goring, whose army was subsequently defeated at Langport, angrily observed that Porter deserved &#145;to be pistolled for his negligence or cowardice&#146;. On another occasion, he had commented that &#145;his brother-in-law was the best company, but the worst officer that ever served the king&#146;  (Bulstrode, 136&#150;7).<br>
<br>Many felt at the time that this dissolute man exercised an influence over Goring which damaged the royalist cause, encouraging the latter's predisposition to drunkenness and debauchery. By October 1645 Porter was also suspected of treachery, rumours circulating that he planned to defect to parliament and had regularly been in communication with the enemy. This speculation was proved to be correct when, in November, he obtained a pass from Sir Thomas Fairfax for safe passage to London. Although his estates were confiscated and he was subsequently fined &pound;1000 as composition by the Goldsmith's Hall committee (28 February 1646), this fine was eventually remitted by parliament, which also pardoned him for his delinquency on 23 March.<br>
<br>Porter was both irritable and quarrelsome by nature. In November 1644 he apologized to Rupert for his disagreeable and impetuous reaction to the prospect of serving under Colonel Hunke; and in October 1645 after reneging on a promise to support Colonel Tuke's promotion he immediately challenged him to a duel. In a subsequent letter Tuke accused Porter of having &#145;little or no religion, in turning the bible and all sacred things into ridicule in his great and constant debaucheries, with many other vices not fit to be named&#146;  (Bulstrode, 144). In May 1646 the speaker was forced to intervene in a dispute between Porter and Captain Sackville, and in June 1654 Cromwell's council issued a warrant to end a quarrel between Porter and the earl of Oxford. Having involved himself in 1659 in plots to restore Charles II, Porter was eventually appointed to the office of gentleman of the privy chamber to the queen consort, Catherine of Braganza, on 31 May 1665. When his will was drawn up on 3 October 1683, shortly before he died, he was living in the parish of St Giles-in-the-Fields in Middlesex. His bequests, based on his estates in Lincolnshire and property in Allfarthing in Surrey, included for his daughter Anne a &pound;2000 dowry on the day of her marriage and &#145;for my wretched daughter, Olivia Porter, who hath so unpardonably dishonoured her family by her prostitution, one shilling as a character of her infamy&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/375, sig. 46).<br>
