<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stanhope,  Philip Dormer</span>, fourth earl of Chesterfield  (1694&#150;1773), <span class="occ">politician and diplomatist</span>, was born on 22 September 1694 in the parish of St James's, Westminster, the son of Philip Stanhope, third earl of Chesterfield (1673&#150;1726), and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Savile (<i>c</i>.1674&#150;1708), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24735/', "George Savile, first marquess of Halifax")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Familyandearlylife"></a>Family and early life</h2>Philip Dormer Stanhope came from a long-established and well-connected family with estates in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. One ancestor, Sir Richard Stanhope, represented the county of Nottinghamshire in parliament in the reign of Henry IV; another, Sir Michael Stanhope, was a brother-in-law of Protector Somerset, and shared the latter's fate in 1552. Sir Michael's great-grandson, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26252/', "Sir Philip Stanhope")</script>, was created Baron Stanhope in 1616 and advanced to the earldom of Chesterfield in 1628. The family was staunchly royalist. The first earl died in 1656 after prison; his eldest son, Philip, was killed in 1645 defending Shelford. The second earl took up arms in 1688 but refused the oath to William of Orange as king. His first wife was a daughter of the tenth earl of Northumberland; his second of the first duke of Ormond; his third (and grandmother of the fourth earl) was the daughter of Charles Dormer, second earl of Carnarvon. Philip Dormer Stanhope's mother was the daughter of Lord Halifax (the Trimmer) and the recipient of his celebrated <span class="italic">Advice to a Daughter</span>. There were several other branches of the Stanhope family, one of which became earls of Harrington. James Stanhope, the leading minister when Philip Dormer Stanhope entered the House of Commons in 1715, and later Earl Stanhope, was another cousin. The duke of Newcastle was a distant but useful relative. Along with these formidable advantages went some personal defects. Stanhope was short, if not squat, with a large head and bad teeth: &#145;a stunted giant&#146;  (Hervey, 1.72) was one description. Lady Cowper thought his voice &#145;a shrill scream&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 145). There is little doubt that his obsessive concern for deportment and appearance was an attempt to compensate for these physical disadvantages, just as the advice to his son not to acquire a nickname such as Muttering Stanhope reflects his own resentment at being dubbed &#145;Little Lord Stanhope&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 4.1448). At the end of his life he wrote: &#145;I have wished myself taller a thousand times, but to no purpose, for all the Stanhopes are but a size above dwarfs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Unpublished Letters</span>, no. III). He claimed that he lacked both ambition and avarice. That may be doubted. Although he shared many noblemen's distaste for routine administration and could, like most disgraced politicians, muse on the charms of retirement, he filled several important posts and was eager to make a mark, in politics and society, and as a patron of the arts. The ambition he showed for his son and his godson could hardly have been surpassed within the bounds of normal psychology. A noble disdain for money was the affectation of many wealthy gentlemen of the period: it did not prevent him from making a lucrative marriage in which passion, it was said, played a minor role.<br>
<br>Stanhope was brought up mainly by his grandmother Lady Halifax. He was tutored privately and then sent to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he led an agreeable life as a fellow commoner; however, he had no great affection for the university, which he called later &#145;an illiberal seminary&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 4.1685). When he left Cambridge, he told his son in 1751, &#145;I was an absolute pedant &hellip; convinced that the classics contained everything that was either necessary, useful or ornamental to men&#146;  (ibid., 4.1760). While he was on the grand tour, in The Hague and Paris, the death of Queen Anne brought in the Hanoverians and the whigs, and Stanhope hastened home to begin his political career. Having been introduced at court by James Stanhope, he was appointed a gentleman of the bedchamber to George, prince of Wales, and was returned to parliament, just under age, on 3 May 1715 for St Germans, a nomination borough hired by the government. &#145;From the day I was elected till the day that I spoke&#146;, he wrote in 1754, &#145;I thought nor dreamed of nothing but speaking&#146;  (ibid., 5.2102). In his maiden speech on 5 August 1715 he demanded, perhaps imprudently, that an example should be made of Ormond, the tory leader, for betraying the nation. The melodramatic story that he was forced to flee abroad after his speech may be doubted: the house was indulgent to under-age speakers, and the comfortable whig majority was unlikely to be savage to one of their own number who stood in need of six weeks. He was joined in parliament by his brothers William (1727), John (1727), and Charles (1730). His later advice to his son reflects his feelings on setting out: &#145;you will be of the House of Commons as soon as you are of age; and you must first make a figure there, if you would make a figure, or a fortune, in your country&#146;  (ibid., 4.1455).<h2>
<a name="Earlyparliamentaryanddiplomaticcareer"></a>Early parliamentary and diplomatic career</h2>The well-publicized quarrel between George I and his son caused difficulties for the prince's followers, especially those connected with James Stanhope, who stayed in office. Philip Dormer Stanhope's political behaviour, like that of his leaders, became contorted. He voted for the <span class="roman">Septennial Bill</span> in 1716, a basic whig measure, but, following the rift between the courts in 1717, pursued a zig-zag course, in part a product of his own independent attitude. He voted with the tories against the repeal of the <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts</span>, having then, as he later remarked, more faith in the Church of England than he had subsequently, yet he supported Stanhope's <span class="roman">Peerage Bill</span> in 1719, and a year later was said to be in difficulties with the prince over the South Sea question. A letter to an unnamed friend about this time suggests that he was anxious for some place, perhaps diplomatic, since his father was not generous. The reconciliation between the prince and the king in 1720 made life easier. In 1722 Stanhope was re-elected, this time for Lostwithiel, a borough under government command, and at the beginning of the session, as a mark of distinction, was asked to move the election of the speaker. In 1723 he was made captain of the yeomen of the guards but did not stand for re-election to parliament. This was presumably at his own choice, since the member returned in his place was a government supporter: perhaps it was because his father was already in poor health. But he was a difficult subordinate, refusing appointment to the newly founded Order of the Bath in 1725 on the grounds that it was a mere trifle, and he lost his captaincy as a result. That autumn he spent miserably at the family seat, Bretby, in Derbyshire, waiting for his father to die. He did not pretend any great show of grief and hated the country. To Henrietta Howard, the mistress of the prince, he wrote:<blockquote>since my father had his fits, he has continued entirely senseless &hellip; how long he will continue so, I cannot tell; but this I am sure of, that if it be much longer I shall be the maddest of the two, this place being the seat of horror and despair &hellip; were I inclined to a religious melancholy, I should fancy myself in Hell. (<span class="italic">Letters to and from Henrietta</span>, 1.197)</blockquote>In letters to his son he denied that affection between parents and children was natural, insisting that it must be fostered by kindness and consideration. In January 1726 his father's death transported him, as fourth earl of Chesterfield, to the House of Lords, which was better suited to his prepared oratory. He left behind him in the Commons a member who had persistently jeered at him by mimicking his somewhat florid gestures.<br>
<br>In June 1727 Chesterfield moved the formal address on the accession of George II, and the new king insisted that some provision be made for him. His gift for languages, together with his experience in the Netherlands, where he had some relatives, suggested a diplomatic appointment: he was made ambassador to The Hague, and took his brother John with him as secretary. At the same time he was sworn of the privy council. His main concern at The Hague was to help conclude the peace treaty with Spain, under discussion at the congress of Soissons. His cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26257/', "William Stanhope")</script> conducted the negotiations with Madrid and at the conclusion of the treaty of Seville was made Lord Harrington and secretary of state. But, in a diplomatic bouleversement, the British decided to ally with the emperor in the second treaty of Vienna, and Chesterfield was much engaged in securing the adherence of the Dutch. At first he enjoyed the activity and splendour of his new post and his wealth enabled him to entertain lavishly, but he soon tired of Dutch society, and by 1730 he was asking when his successor could be appointed. He conducted with some skill the preliminary negotiations for the marriage of the princess royal to the prince of Orange, which eventually took place in 1734. For Chesterfield the most important consequence of his mission was his liaison with Elizabeth de Bouchet, which produced in March 1732 his son Philip, to whom the later <span class="italic">Letters to his Son</span> were addressed, and on whom Chesterfield pinned so many hopes. In August 1728 he asked Charles, third Viscount Townshend, to obtain him the Garter, arguing that it would help his diplomatic status, but he had to wait until May 1730. Townshend's retirement at that time had no effect upon Chesterfield's progress, and in June 1730 he was made lord steward, with the understanding that he would assume the duties when his mission to the Netherlands was satisfactorily completed. In the event he did not have to perform the steward's duties for long. Not until February 1732 was he able to return home, and the following year Sir Robert Walpole's <span class="roman">Excise Bill</span> produced a major political crisis. Chesterfield's hostility to the measure was well known. In the Commons his three brothers voted against the bill, and doubt whether he could get it through the Lords was an important factor in persuading Walpole to abandon the measure. On 13 April, by way of example and to demonstrate that he retained the king's favour, Walpole had Chesterfield dismissed from his stewardship and Lord Clinton, another potential rebel, from his lordship of the bedchamber. Hervey quotes a dignified protest to the king from Chesterfield, claiming eighteen years of uninterrupted attachment, and explaining that &#145;I declared at all events against a measure that would so inevitably lessen the affections of Your Majesty's subjects to you &hellip; I thought of it as the whole nation did&#146; (Hervey, 1.172&#150;3; <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2.265&#150;6). Chesterfield joined Scarbrough, Bathurst, Cobham, and Carteret, with Bolingbroke in the background, in a most formidable and talented opposition. In May he helped to inflict a snap defeat on the government, demanding a report on the accounts of the South Sea Company. Walpole's response was to strengthen his debating team in the Lords by sending Hervey and Hardwicke there. Cobham and Bolton were dismissed their regiments <i>in terrorem</i>, and Chesterfield spoke strongly for a bill to prevent the removal of army officers for political offences; he lost by 100 votes to 62.<br>
<br>The first disappointment for the opposition was that, though they made gains at the general election in May 1734, they were not sufficient to unseat Walpole. Bolingbroke, always volatile, gave up the struggle and retired to France. This placed an extra burden on Chesterfield, particularly in the vigorous newspaper and pamphlet warfare. Early in 1734 three of his essays, including &#145;An army in waxwork&#146;, appeared in <span class="italic">Fog's Journal</span> and did much to cheer the opposition. His marriage in September 1733 also had political implications. He was already on cool terms with Queen Caroline because of his friendship and correspondence with Lady Suffolk, the mistress of George II. Chesterfield's bride was the forty-year-old <a href="#cosubject_24835">Petronilla Melusina von der Schulenburg [<i>see below</i>]</a>, the daughter of George I by his mistress the duchess of Kendal. In 1722 she had been created countess of Walsingham in her own right, though after the marriage she was known as Lady Chesterfield. Among the many advantages the marriage offered was that the duchess was Chesterfield's next-door neighbour in newly built Grosvenor Square: another was that the countess was reported to have a marriage portion of &pound;50,000, a pension for life of &pound;3000 per annum, and further expectations on the death of her mother. Chesterfield's windfall went towards completing his magnificent house in South Audley Street, which was given its grand opening in 1752. According to Horace Walpole, George II was extremely reluctant when the duchess died in 1743 to pay over Lady Chesterfield's inheritance, and had to be prompted by the threat of legal action. Hervey provided a glimpse of Chesterfield's new existence in October 1733: &#145;Lord Chesterfield has not stirred from Twitenham since the declaration of his marriage. He talks, Lady Chesterfield kisses, and the Duchess of Kendal spins all day long &hellip; he has no resources to dissipate his boredom&#146;  (Holland Fox-Strangeways, 179). Although Chesterfield treated his wife with courtesy and consideration, and she in return took a kind interest in the progress of his illegitimate son Philip, rumours were soon circulating crediting Chesterfield with extramarital affairs, including one with Lady Frances Shirley.<br>
<br>The main strategy of the opposition was to unite the still formidable tory party with the whig dissidents in order to bring about Walpole's downfall. Chesterfield developed in the Lords into one of the house's most effective speakers, shedding much of his earlier elaboration and adopting a more direct and relaxed debating style. Both Hervey, who often followed him in debate, and Horace Walpole, unsympathetic to him, paid tribute to his brilliance on occasion. Chesterfield did not allow himself to be inhibited by consistency. On 6 March 1733, before his dismissal, he had defended the army estimates, ridiculing the idea that the army might be a threat to liberty; on 28 March 1734 he denounced a motion to augment the army in the light of the War of the Polish Succession as &#145;the most extraordinary demand that was ever made on any Parliament in this kingdom &hellip; adieu for ever to the liberties of Great Britain&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 8.1236, 9.531&#150;8). In May 1737 his speech against Walpole's <span class="roman">Playhouse Bill</span>, to establish the licensing of plays by the lord chamberlain, won immense applause: &#145;the only way to prevent being ridiculed or censured is to avoid all ridiculous or wicked measures &hellip; I shall always be extremely cautious and fearful of making the least encroachment upon liberty&#146;  (ibid., 10.328&#150;42). The decision of the prince of Wales in 1737 to move into opposition made it much easier to defy the charge that Chesterfield and his friends were crypto-Jacobites, and Chesterfield became a regular visitor to the prince's London headquarters at Norfolk House. But their most likely chance of ousting Walpole was that Britain might become involved in war, for which neither his talents nor his policy were well suited. In May 1738, in a debate on &#145;the depredations of the Spaniards&#146;, Chesterfield complained of the &#145;scandalous insults&#146; offered to the nation, and demanded satisfaction by force of arms if necessary  (ibid., 10.776&#150;83). Walpole's response was to try to reach agreement with Spain, and in January 1739 a convention was signed. Chesterfield, in the presence of the prince of Wales for support, attacked the convention on 1 March in a speech &#145;prodigiously applauded as very fine, and very artful&#146;. The settlement was &#145;the most inglorious, the most pernicious that this nation ever made &hellip; we must now fight them before we can expect any justice or satisfaction from them&#146;  (ibid., 10.1091&#150;1246). Walpole carried the day by 95 votes to 74, an ominously slight majority. Mrs Delany, who attended the debate, thought that Chesterfield &#145;spoke most exquisitely well &hellip; I never was so well entertained in my life as with his speaking&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography &hellip; Mrs Delany</span>, 1st ser., 2.45). War came in October 1739, but for a time Walpole held on. Admiral Edward Vernon's great victory at Portobello in November 1739, though in the event a flash in the pan, convinced many that a glorious war was about to begin.<br>
<br>By the time the next general election was due in 1741 there were signs that Walpole's grip was faltering. His last great parliamentary triumph was in February 1741, when an injudicious motion begging the king to dismiss him split the opposition. The tories, disliking the threat to the royal prerogative, abstained, leaving Walpole victorious in the Commons by 290 votes to 106 and in the Lords by 108 to 59. Chesterfield did not speak in the debate, being &#145;too weak&#146;, though he signed the protest: he was far from well and increasingly gloomy about the chances of ousting Walpole  (<span class="italic">Egmont Diary</span>, 3.192). He had no great opinion of his allies John Carteret and William Pulteney. Assured by Pulteney in November 1740 that Walpole was rocking, Chesterfield &#145;only laughed at this, and told him I was quite weary of hearing the same story for seven years together&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2.433). He returned to active service on 9 April 1741 with a speech opposing a vote of credit on the grounds that the government would only use it to bribe the electorate. His weak support he blamed on Carteret and the prince. Soon after the general election in May 1741 he set out on a continental trip in search of health, telling Marchmont that, &#145;unless the prospect here mends extremely, I shall not be in haste to return&#146;  (ibid., 2.450). Although first impressions suggested that Walpole's majority had been further eroded, Chesterfield remained pessimistic, convinced that his allies would ruin everything: &#145;we ought to have meetings to concert measures some time before the meeting of the Parliament&#146; he wrote from Spa to George Dodington in September:<blockquote>but that, I likewise know, will not happen. I have been these seven years endeavouring to bring it about, and have not been able; fox-hunting, gardening, planting, or indifference having always kept our people in the country, till the very day before the meeting of the Parliament. (ibid., 2.469&#150;70)</blockquote>From Spa he went to Paris and thence to Avignon, where he paid his respects to the aged duke of Ormond. Horace Walpole believed that Chesterfield was on a secret mission to persuade Ormond to instruct the Jacobites to join forces to bring Walpole down. This is rather unlikely. Despite his contempt for Hanover and its natives, Chesterfield had little sympathy for the Jacobites, in part because he disliked Catholicism so much, and a journey of more than 1000 miles was scarcely necessary to obtain endorsement of so elementary a tactic. He spent three days with Bolingbroke, whom he admired extravagantly, but complained that he talked of nothing but metaphysics.<br>
<br>Chesterfield returned with reluctance in November 1741, having found the French climate good for his health, still convinced that the opposition faced &#145;a melancholy and ignominious scene&#146; in parliament  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2.477). The pre-Christmas session was not decisive. Despite his gloom, Chesterfield took the floor at once, opposing the address: &#145;I see many motives for censure, none for approbation, all for distrust&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 12.223&#150;6, 232&#150;42). Horace Walpole, aware that his father was fighting for his political life, called Chesterfield's speech &#145;very fine&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 17.230). But when the struggle recommenced after Christmas it became clear that Walpole's days were numbered. Pulteney's motion for a committee of inquiry into the war was defeated by only 253 votes to 250; in a debate on the absence of officers from Minorca, in which Chesterfield took part, the court survived by 69 votes to 57. At the beginning of February, Walpole resigned and was created earl of Orford.<h2>
<a name="PoliticalcareerafterWalpole"></a>Political career after Walpole</h2>The triumphant opposition split at once. Negotiations were conducted mainly by Pulteney, who did not take office but accepted an earldom. Sir Spencer Compton (Lord Wilmington) was put in as nominal first minister and Carteret joined Newcastle as secretary of state. The tories did not receive any employment, and neither did Chesterfield: &#145;I have been offered none&#146;, he wrote to a friend, &#145;I have asked for none, and I will accept of none till I see a little clearer into matters than I do at present; I have opposed measures not men&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2.490). He continued in opposition and in April spoke in favour of a place bill which the new ministers were attempting to smother. The following month, disclaiming any personal animosity against the fallen minister, he urged acceptance of a bill to indemnify witnesses against him, arguing that &#145;rejecting this bill is passing one of impunity for all future ministers &hellip; when the nation cries for an enquiry, will you lie under the imputation of obstructing it?&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 12.643&#150;714). When the new ministers carried its rejection by 109 votes to 57, Chesterfield signed the protest. Despite his talk of &#145;measures not men&#146;, under the veneer of urbanity Chesterfield harboured some unpleasant and vengeful feelings. With such limited support he could hope to do little more than be a nuisance to ministers. He concentrated on the Hanoverian issue and early in 1743 published <span class="italic">The Case of the Hanover Forces in the Pay of Great Britain</span>, which provoked considerable controversy, allowing him to contribute a <span class="italic">Vindication</span> and a <span class="italic">Farther Vindication</span>. He added a number of essays in <span class="italic">Old England</span> under the pseudonym Jeffery Broadbottom, criticizing the valour of the Hanoverian troops and the honours paid them and calling for some form of national government. In the House of Lords his attacks on George II were less and less veiled. He was first into action on the address of thanks in November 1742, complaining that it was an excuse to offer up incense to the monarch, and deploring its &#145;style and servility&#146;  (ibid., 12.843&#150;7). On 1 February 1743, in a debate on the hiring of Hanoverian troops, he remarked offensively that Britain, &#145;after having exalted the Elector of Hanover from a state of obscurity to the crown, is condemned to hire the troops of Hanover to fight their own cause&#146;  (ibid., 12.1065&#150;8, 1134&#150;45). Even on domestic issues he could cause embarrassment. The <span class="roman">Gin Bill</span> of February 1743 was intended to deal with the increasing scourge by replacing prohibition, which could not be enforced, by a system of licensing and control. Chesterfield attacked it with &#145;reason, wit and ridicule&#146;: &#145;it ought to be called a bill for encouraging the consumption of such liquors, by enabling all the poor in the kingdom to get drunk as often as they please&#146;  (ibid., 12.1191&#150;1440). The revenue raised by the promotion of vice would no doubt find its way to Hanover. Ministers carried the day by 82 votes to 54, and Chesterfield confessed that he was disconcerted to find so many bishops supporting him&#151;not his usual predicament. Debating victories lifted morale, but the real hopes of the opposition were indications of growing tension within the government between Carteret and Pulteney (now the earl of Bath) on the one hand and the Pelhams and Hardwicke on the other.<br>
<br>During the recess of 1743 Chesterfield had a private meeting with Henry Pelham (who had replaced Wilmington as first minister) which did not reach agreement but was not acrimonious. Chesterfield accordingly remained in opposition. To George Dodington he wrote once again urging a meeting before parliament assembled: &#145;though my former ill-success makes me almost despair, it shall not however hinder me from trying to prevail with people to know what they are to do, before they do it&#146;  (Owen, 197). The main issue was still foreign policy, Carteret's domain. George II had distinguished himself at the battle of Dettingen in June 1743, but the commander-in-chief, Lord Stair, had resigned, it was said in disgust at the favour showed to the Hanoverian regiments. The debate on the address on 1 December 1743 became single combat between Chesterfield and Carteret. Chesterfield did not divide against, but was at his irritating best:<blockquote>some questions might naturally arise to a sceptic in politics, or to a man whose confidence in the administration was less than mine&#151;it might be asked upon what success we are about to congratulate His Majesty, what armies have been routed, what provinces have been conquered &hellip; what ambassadors are arrived to sue for peace &hellip; I shall not oppose a panegyric on His Majesty's conduct and behaviour [though] His Majesty's behaviour might deserve praise, while his conduct incurred censure. (ibid., 13.100&#150;35)</blockquote>Chesterfield hoped Britain was not about to plunge into a formal declaration of war against France. Carteret retorted that he would not be intimidated by Chesterfield's menaces, or by &#145;those scattered remarks which I consider as preludes to a formal attack&#146;  (ibid.). As for the difference Chesterfield had perceived between the king's conduct and behaviour, &#145;I confess myself unable to understand: His Majesty's behaviour in the field was intrepid, and his conduct in general wise&#146;  (ibid.). Chesterfield and his ally in the lower house, William Pitt, were building up massive resentment in George II, to whom Hanover and his &#145;German minister&#146; Carteret were equally dear. On 27 April 1744 he spoke at length in opposition to a bill to make it treason to correspond with the Pretender's sons, arguing that there were few Jacobites in England and the danger slight.<h2>
<a name="TheNetherlandsandIreland"></a>The Netherlands and Ireland</h2>The French declaration of war in March 1744 made the resolution of the cabinet's disunity imperative. In October 1744 the death of Lady Marlborough brought Chesterfield a bequest of &pound;20,000 for his services to opposition, but ironically made it easier for him to take office. The possibility of a national government or &#145;broad-bottom&#146; administration was increasingly canvassed. Carteret was forced to resign in November 1744, and in the grand reshuffle Chesterfield joined the cabinet as lord lieutenant of Ireland. The explanation he gave Marchmont was, as usual, laconic and unheroic: &#145;it had business enough to keep a man awake and not enough to hinder him from sleeping&#146;  (Rose, 1.183). Unlike a secretaryship, it did not demand constant attendance upon the king. Several tories were also brought in&#151;Lord Gower as lord privy seal and Sir John Hynde Cotton as treasurer&#151;though no place could be found for Pitt, whose insults to Hanover had been even more venomous than Chesterfield's. Since Chesterfield's own vituperation had been directed largely at their former colleague and rival Carteret, he was at first on cordial terms with the Pelhams. Stephen Poyntz noted in January 1745 that, among the newcomers to the ministry, &#145;the most open and hearty, and he in whom Mr Pelham places the chief confidence, is my old friend Lord Chesterfield&#146;  (<span class="italic">Buckinghamshire MSS</span>, 110).<br>
<br>Before he could take up his Irish duties, Chesterfield was sent on a diplomatic mission to The Hague to persuade the Dutch to enter the war against France. The king's audience before his departure in January was terse to the point of brusqueness, but the mission was a total success. The Dutch agreed to put 60,000 men into the field and to accept the duke of Cumberland&#151;the king's youngest son&#151;as commander-in-chief: in exchange their naval contribution was reduced and they were assured of further mercenary support. It was hardly Chesterfield's fault that Dutch performance proved inadequate, and that the French victory at Fontenoy in May destroyed allied plans before he had reached home.<br>
<br>Chesterfield's stay in Ireland was very brief and very successful&#151;perhaps the two things were related. He arrived in Dublin on 31 August 1745. Since Prince Charles Edward had landed in Scotland the previous month, Chesterfield's main aim was to ensure that the Jacobite invasion of England would not be accompanied by insurrection in Ireland. On arrival he took brisk military measures, raising new regiments among the protestants of the north. William Lecky considered his viceroyalty brilliant and &#145;eminently successful&#146;. The external threat helped to create protestant solidarity, and in his farewell speech to the Dublin parliament on 11 April 1746 Chesterfield was able to refer to &#145;the almost unprecedented temper and unanimity with which you have carried on the public business&#146;  (<span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works</span>, 1.270). His own wealth, augmented by that of the duchess of Kendal, enabled him to entertain well at the castle. He had no great opinion of Irish landlords, who drank too much and treated the poor &#145;worse than negroes&#146;. Convinced that repression was more likely to provoke rebellion than prevent it, he refused to take action to close Catholic churches or to hound Catholic priests, and when he left he was able to claim that &#145;not one man of them stirred during the whole rebellion&#146;. Troops were sent from Ireland to reinforce the defences of England. It was probably his greatest service to the Hanoverian succession and helped to soften George II's rancour. Newcastle congratulated Chesterfield on the extraordinary reception one of his letters had had in the closet: &#145;<i>Chesterfield is in the right: it is the wisest letter that ever was wrote</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Private Correspondence</span>, 73&#150;4). His relaxed attitude towards possible disaffection in Ireland was in sharp contrast to his vindictiveness towards the Scottish rebels: &#145;some particular acts of vigour and severity are absolutely necessary, and it is not a time for favour or lenity &hellip; the Commander-in-Chief should be ordered to give no quarter&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 3.671&#150;2).<br>
<br>Chesterfield's absence in Dublin meant that he was not directly involved in the showdown between the Pelhams and the king which took place in February 1746. The ministers had long decided that so public a demonstration of the king's dislike was too damaging to accept, and had resolved to stage a mass resignation as soon as the Jacobite danger had passed. The king's response was to try to sponsor a ministry headed by Bath and Carteret, now Earl Granville, but they could obtain no support: wits complained that no gentleman could walk the streets of London without the danger of being importuned to join the cabinet. The Pelhams came back on their own terms, which included a post for William Pitt. With their policy, Chesterfield was in full agreement&#151;indeed he was one of the chief instigators&#151;since he believed that the block on patronage which the king's hostility implied made government almost impossible. &#145;You must mark out Lord Granville by exterminating without quarter all who belong to him&#146;, he had written  (<span class="italic">Private Correspondence</span>, 45).<br>
<br>Chesterfield returned to England in April 1746 and was immediately struck down with a severe illness. This was one reason for declining in July the offer of yet another diplomatic mission to The Hague: in addition, he had little confidence that the Dutch could be persuaded to improve their war effort. In August he wrote to Newcastle that, &#145;after a long and painful struggle, it is now decided that you should have for some time longer, your most faithful friend&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 3.770). But, despite their victory over the king, ministers were still at odds. Harrington, the first to tender his resignation, had borne the brunt of the king's resentment and was being steadily undermined by his fellow secretary Newcastle. In October 1746 he resigned and was replaced as secretary of state for the north by Chesterfield.<h2>
<a name="Secretaryofstateandlaterpoliticalcareer"></a>Secretary of state and later political career</h2>The period of one year and four months which brought Chesterfield's political career to a close was in marked contrast to his triumph in Ireland, and was almost certainly an error of judgement. It is doubtful whether his health was strong enough, not so much for the routine of office, but for the constant in-fighting and manoeuvring in the cabinet. He should have realized more clearly that Newcastle's enthusiasm would disappear at speed and be replaced by his normal jealousy. Indeed, it appears that Chesterfield was bounced into the post on 28 October, when Harrington suddenly resigned, allowing himself to be talked into it by flattery and the last twinges of political ambition. From the outset the signals were not encouraging. <span class="italic">An Expostulatory Letter to a Certain Right Honourable Person on his Late Promotion</span> forecast that he would not enjoy his new position. The king remarked to Newcastle that, if the new appointment did not work, they could get rid of him, to which Newcastle replied that Chesterfield had already made the same point. To his son, Chesterfield wrote in November that the post was &#145;in some degree inflicted upon me&#146;, and that he doubted whether he was really fit for a position which &#145;requires more strength of body and mind than I have&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 3.830).<br>
<br>For a time, interest in his new post carried Chesterfield, while Newcastle's attention was partly diverted by planning for the general election of July 1747, which ministers won comfortably. Thereafter, difficulties developed. Patronage disputes formed an obbligato to most ministries, since success in carrying recommendations not only built one's political foundation but announced to the world one's standing and prospects. The major question remained foreign policy. Chesterfield's low opinion of the efficiency of the Dutch republic persuaded him of the need for peace on whatever reasonable terms could be obtained, while Newcastle still hoped that the war could be brought to a successful conclusion. French diplomatic advances led to a peace conference at Breda, to which the young Lord Sandwich was sent. Attached at first to Chesterfield, he soon perceived that Newcastle was a better long-term bet and transferred his allegiance. When Chesterfield managed to appoint his friend Solomon Dayrolles as resident at The Hague, Sandwich regarded him as a spy. By the summer of 1747 complaints were creeping into Chesterfield's letters to Dayrolles, and by the autumn a kind of sullen resignation had taken over. In June Chesterfield reported wryly that &#145;many people think that <i>my Brother</i> [Newcastle] will wear out my patience, as indeed he has most people's, but &hellip; I may hold out longer than people think&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 3.942). In July he wrote that Newcastle had, he believed, promised Sandwich the secretaryship in succession, and the following month that Sandwich had &#145;for some time made his option between the duke of Newcastle and myself&#146;  (ibid., 3.991). In September he would &#145;continue in public life, while I can do it with honour, and when I cannot, I shall enjoy private life with pleasure&#146;  (ibid., 3.1014). In October he told Dayrolles how disagreeable it was &#145;to tug at the oar with one who cannot row, and yet will be paddling so as to hinder you from rowing&#146;  (ibid., 3.1043), and that he did not know how much longer he could bear it. By January 1748 he had had enough. It was well known, he wrote, that he was no more than a <i>commis</i>&#151;as for business, &#145;I have now gone through every part of it, without liking it at all the better for being acquainted with it. Like many other things, it is most admired by those who know it the least&#146;  (ibid., 3.1088). On 6 February he resigned, assuring the king that he would continue to support the government, and explaining to Dayrolles that he would now be able to enjoy &#145;philosophical quiet&#146;  (ibid., 3.1097). From Bath, to which he had at once travelled to repair his shattered health, he wrote, with an air of detachment but surprising na&iuml;vety for a man in his mid-fifties:<blockquote>I have been behind the scenes, both of pleasure and business. I have seen all the coarse pulleys and dirty ropes, which exhibit and move all the gaudy machines; and I have seen and smelt the tallow candles which illuminate the whole decoration, to the astonishment and admiration of the ignorant audience. (ibid., 3.1109)</blockquote>He was allowed one final triumph. Within a fortnight the imminent collapse of the Dutch war effort, as he had often predicted, made peace inescapable. &#145;Chesterfield told me six months ago, it would be so&#146;  (ibid., 3.1122), he reported the king as saying, and Newcastle confessed that the outcome of the power struggle might have been very different had the news of the Dutch collapse come through a few days sooner. To Sandwich Newcastle wrote that the reports of Dutch bankruptcy &#145;go much further than Lord Chesterfield's gloomiest forecasts, which I used to put down to prejudice, passion and personal pique and resentment&#146;  (Lodge, 316).<br>
<br>In a letter from Bath to David Mallet, Chesterfield pondered the explanations that would be offered for his resignation. A brisk, if brief, pamphlet war broke out, with <span class="italic">An Apology for a Late Resignation</span> putting Chesterfield's case, <span class="italic">An Answer</span> confuting it, and <span class="italic">An Impartial Review</span> suggesting middle ground. Within a month, however, Chesterfield wrote that &#145;new matter has shoved me off the coffee-house tables&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 3.1118&#150;19). His career was by no means a complete failure, and, in view of his poor health, it was creditable how much he did achieve. As a diplomat he was highly successful and as viceroy&#151;not the easiest of posts&#151;outstanding. His wealth offered always a very agreeable alternative existence&#151;he resumed gambling at White's as soon as he resigned&#151;free from the drudgery, anxieties, and irritations of political life. He lacked the drive and determination of a Walpole, Pelham, North, or Pitt, younger sons or men of little personal wealth, who needed office to make their way in the world. In this sense he choked on the silver spoon with which he was born. In addition he made two simple mistakes, which he shared with Bolingbroke and Carteret, two other clever men. He overestimated how much cleverer he was than others&#151;writing to Bolingbroke of the tediousness of dealing with second-rate minds&#151;and he overestimated the importance of sheer cleverness in political life as against other assets. He might have remembered a maxim of Rochefoucault, whom he liked to recommend, that real cleverness takes the trouble to disguise itself. Chesterfield's did not, and, considering the emphasis he placed in the <span class="italic">Letters to his Son</span> on the art of making friends, it is ironic that he made so many enemies. He had neither a large parliamentary following nor a fund of goodwill on which to draw in a crisis. On the news of his retirement, Lady Westmorland said, unkindly but not unfairly: &#145;I apprehend this occurrence to be of very little importance to the world, for as his going in produced no good effects, his going out can produce no bad ones&#146;  (<span class="italic">Eighth Report</span>, 569a).<br>
<br>It would have surprised Chesterfield when he retired to know that he had twenty-five years of life ahead of him. His health had frequently been very bad, with unpleasant giddy spells and rheumatic pains as well as the remorseless onset of deafness. He referred to his &#145;shattered carcase&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 4.1244), and as early as 1741 wrote to his Dutch friend Baron Torck: &#145;I have been so ill all this winter that I thought the play was going to end&#146;  (ibid., 2.444&#150;5). But he did not totally abandon politics. He continued to attend the House of Lords, and in 1751 he was responsible for the calendar reform which brought Britain into line with the continent. He took trouble with his speech on that occasion, describing it with some pride to his son. In 1753 he disliked the repeal of the <span class="roman">Jewish Naturalization Act</span>, regarding it as a surrender to intolerance and bigotry. There were occasional suggestions or rumours that he might return to office, but he had little desire left. On 24 May 1755 he moved the adjournment to prevent &#145;an indecent, ungenerous and malignant&#146; motion by Lord Poulet being debated, which begged the king not to visit Hanover. &#145;People are impatient to see what great employment I am to have&#146;, commented Chesterfield: &#145;I have nothing to fear, I have nothing to ask, and there is nothing that I will or can have &hellip; public life and I, we are parted forever&#146;  (ibid., 5.2143). His last speech in the House of Lords was on 10 December 1755, when he defended the subsidy treaties in an oration of nearly an hour. However, the effort, he wrote, &#145;very near annihilated me&#146;  (ibid., 5.2170), and he was carried home before the debate was concluded. In January 1756 Mrs Delany reported that he had had a stroke, brought on by gambling. In 1757 he was brought into action once more to reconcile Newcastle and Pitt, but he acted as broker and took no office for himself in that most successful of wartime coalitions.<h2>
<a name="Letterstohisson1774"></a>Letters to his son (1774)</h2>The overwhelming concern of Chesterfield's later life was plotting and monitoring the career of his son Philip: &#145;his success in the world&#146;, he wrote in 1751, &#145;is now the only object I have in it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 4.1735). The <span class="italic">Letters</span> brought more lasting fame, as well as censure, than all his political achievements. They have been greatly admired. Shellabarger called them &#145;one of the world's permanent books &hellip; an exquisite flower of civilisation&#146;. That may seem excessive for writings which were never conceived as a book, which were published after the author's death, probably against his wishes, and which were, by their very nature, repetitive, unrevised, and miscellaneous. From 1761 he added the letters to his godson, Sturdy, his eventual successor as fifth earl. When the two did not provide him with enough opportunity to offer sage advice, he wrote to young Lord Huntingdon, son of the religious reformer Selina: &#145;I consider him my adopted son&#146;, he told the marquise de Monconseil  (ibid., 4.1583).<br>
<br>The series of 448 letters to his son began when the boy was five and continued until within four weeks of his death in 1768 at the age of thirty-six. In one sense they were compensation for the university education Philip did not receive and were intended to provide the essential foundation for a career in politics or diplomacy. At their peak, from 1748 to 1752, the long and earnest homilies were landing on Philip's table at the rate of one a fortnight. They constitute one of the heaviest intellectual bombardments ever attempted: &#145;you chiefly employ, or rather wholly engross my thoughts&#146;, the boy was told  (ibid., 5.1943&#150;4). There was no escape, since Philip was asked for comments and replies and was warned that he would be questioned about his understanding of them. The subject matter was adjusted as Philip grew. When he was eleven, at Westminster School, he was asked: &#145;are you sufficiently upon your guard against awkward attitudes &hellip; and disgusting habits, such as scratching yourself, putting your fingers in your mouth, nose and ears?&#146;  (ibid., 4.1516). Later they dealt with questions of dress and deportment&#151;how to enter and leave a room with ease, to be polite to servants, to smile often and never laugh, to avoid drink, gluttony, and gambling, to flatter vicariously and bait one's hook, to avoid low company, to choose a wife with discretion, and to make friends and avoid making enemies&#151;what Chesterfield called &#145;the necessary arts of the world&#146;  (ibid., 5.1997).<br>
<br>Although the <span class="italic">Letters</span> were not intended for publication, when they appeared one year after Chesterfield's death they attracted widespread comment. George III was reported to have said that, &#145;for my part, I like more streight forward work&#146;  (<span class="italic">Early Journals and Letters of Fanny Burney</span>, 2.33n). Samuel Johnson's brutal dismissal of them as teaching &#145;the morals of a whore and the manners of a dancing master&#146; was to be expected from a man of painful seriousness and deep religion, yet he added that, if the &#145;immorality&#146; were removed, they would make &#145;a very pretty book&#146;, which &#145;should be put into the hands of every young gentleman&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.266, 3.53). Horace Walpole, who, with Edward Gibbon, had declined to edit them, though finding the repetition endless and tiresome, conceded that &#145;to my great surprise they seem really written from the heart&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 28.146&#150;7). Later comments reflect the changing values of their own day. The nineteenth century deplored the lack of zeal in religion, the twentieth century Chesterfield's unflattering views on women. Macaulay thought the <span class="italic">Letters</span> were &#145;trash&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Thomas Babington Macaulay</span>, 2.288&#150;9), and Lord Mahon warned his readers not to be corrupted by them. Colin Franklin in 1993 thought that, on women and marriage, Chesterfield was &#145;at his most atrocious&#146;  (Franklin, 12).<br>
<br>Concentration on the contents of the <span class="italic">Letters</span>, many of which were, after all, intended as a training in diplomacy, runs the risk of neglecting their tone and the effect which they produced. It would be foolish to deny that they were well intentioned, that Chesterfield mixed praise and encouragement with reproach, or that, as Walpole put it, he had a difficult cub to lick into shape. But, in addition to the heavy didacticism, not uncommon in eighteenth-century fathers writing to their sons abroad, there is a note of menace, which could hardly fail to have had a stultifying, if not paralysing, effect. As an illegitimate son, Philip Stanhope had no claim on the earl and was totally at his mercy, as his father reminded him: &#145;remember, that I am under no further obligation than to give you the necessary means of subsisting &hellip; if once we quarrel, I will never forgive&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 3.1070). If Philip should cease to deserve his affection, &#145;you may expect every possible mark of my resentment&#146;  (ibid., 3.1320). The battering was remorseless. &#145;I shall ask you questions about this letter&#146;  (ibid., 2.376), Chesterfield wrote (on chronology) to his seven-year-old son. &#145;If you should disappoint me, I would not advise you to expect much from me&#146;  (ibid., 3.752), and, again, &#145;I shall expect perfection &hellip; or you and I shall not be very well together. I shall dissect and analyse you with a microscope&#146;  (ibid., 3.974). Even compliments contained threats: &#145;I begin to believe that I shall be proud of you &hellip; Those expectations of mine seem so well grounded, that my disappointment, and consequently my anger, will be so much the greater if they fail&#146;  (ibid., 4.1198&#150;9). The unlucky youth was reminded how fortunate he was to have so painstaking an instructor: &#145;you should be sensible of your good fortune in having one who interests himself enough in you to inquire into your faults in order to inform you of them&#146;  (ibid., 3.1171). Chesterfield wished he could be invisible so that he might hear and judge the boy's &#145;natural and unguarded conversation at breakfast&#146;  (ibid., 4.1365): &#145;Remember that I shall know everything you say or do at Paris exactly as if by the force of magic&#146;  (ibid., 4.1608). To welcome Philip back from his protracted grand tour in 1751, his father wrote: &#145;You must therefore expect the most critical <i>examen</i> that ever anybody underwent. I shall discover your least, as well as your greatest defects, and I shall very freely tell you of them&#146;  (ibid., 4.1696).<br>
<br>The result was predictable. The boy grew up shy, deceitful, graceless, and awkward&#151;&#145;a meer pedantic booby&#146;, in Fanny Burney's opinion  (<span class="italic">Early Journals</span>, 2.63). Lord Charlemont, in a detailed account, made the best case for Chesterfield, arguing that the <span class="italic">Letters</span> had been a desperate attempt to cure &#145;a total want of good breeding&#146;, yet one wonders whether the remedy was not the cause. Stanhope grew up &#145;a perfect Tony Lumpkin &hellip; all the anxious father's pains were thrown away on the utterly incurable son&#146;  (<span class="italic">Charlemont MSS</span>, 1.324&#150;30). Chesterfield brought him into parliament in 1754 for the nomination borough of Liskeard: Philip broke down in his maiden speech and never spoke again. With considerable difficulty, in 1757 Chesterfield got him appointed resident at Hamburg, which he left in 1759, though he retained the post for another four years; in 1764 he became resident in Dresden and gave up his seat in parliament. When Philip died in 1768 at the age of thirty-six, Chesterfield discovered that he had been secretly married for ten years, significantly to the illegitimate daughter of an Irish gentleman, and had two sons, Charles and Philip. His widow, Eugenia Stanhope, arranged for the publication of the <span class="italic">Letters</span> the year after Chesterfield's death.<br>
<br>In the 236 letters to his godson <a href="#cosubject_26254">Philip Stanhope, known as Sturdy [<i>see below</i>]</a>, the touch is lighter, partly because the boy had a father alive and was not completely in Chesterfield's power. Yet even there, menace was not absent. &#145;Though he loves me&#146;, the earl wrote to Philip's father in 1764, &#145;he fears me more than he does anybody in the world; and I endeavour to keep those two sentiments alive in him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 6.2580). The outcome was hardly more encouraging. Fanny Burney, who was at court with the fifth earl in the 1790s, wrote: &#145;how would that quintessence of high ton, the late Lord Chesterfield, blush to behold his successor; who, with much share of humour and of good humour also, has as little good breeding as any man I ever met with&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary and Letters</span>, 5.92). Although he was well received at court and obtained the Garter, his career was in no way remarkable. Even Lord Huntingdon, to whom Chesterfield addressed nearly fifty letters, turned out to be something of a disappointment.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearswritingsandreputation"></a>Final years, writings and reputation</h2>Chesterfield's health slowly degenerated. &#145;I feel a gradual decay&#146;, he wrote in April 1765, &#145;though a gentle one; and I think that I shall not tumble, but slide gently to the bottom of the hill of life. When that will be, I neither know nor care, for I am very weary&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 6.2651). In September 1765 he told the bishop of Waterford: &#145;I am neither well nor ill, and hobbling on to my journey's end&#146;  (ibid., 6.2667). He maintained an interest in politics. He disapproved strongly of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span>, sending his proxy to Newcastle to use for its repeal in 1766, and he commented on the imprudence of Pitt in exchanging the Commons for the House of Lords, &#145;that Hospital of Incurables&#146;  (ibid., 6.2752). His frequent visits to Bath patched him up from time to time: &#145;I could now outcrawl a snail&#146;, he wrote in 1769, &#145;or perhaps even a tortoise&#146;  (ibid., 6.2899). From 1772 he could no longer write, and he died, at Chesterfield House, Grosvenor Square, on 24 March 1773, leaving a long letter of advice to be delivered to his heir. He was buried on 10 April at Shelford, Nottinghamshire, one of the family estates, with little pomp or expense, as his will dictated. Maty, his first biographer, recorded that, polite to the end, his last words were: &#145;Give Dayrolles a chair&#146;  (<span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works</span>, 1.225).<br>
<br>Chesterfield's will, printed in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, aroused much comment. The bulk of his property went to Sturdy, then on the grand tour, but advised from the grave never to visit Italy, &#145;the foul sink of illiberal manners and vices&#146;. He was to forfeit &pound;5000 to the dean and chapter of Westminster should he keep hounds or racehorses, stay overnight at Newmarket, or lose more than &pound;500 in a gambling session. Philip's mother, Mme de Bouchet, was given &pound;500 &#145;as a small reparation for the injury I did her&#146;: she rejected it. Philip's sons, Charles and Philip, were to share &pound;310,000, with an annuity of &pound;100 each. There were bequests to servants, &#145;equals by Nature, and my inferiors only by the difference of our fortunes&#146;. Lady Chesterfield, who had much property of her own, received &pound;1000 per annum and the use of the London and Blackheath houses. Mrs Delany thought that she had been cheated and &#145;very ungratefully used&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography &hellip; Mrs Delany</span>, 2nd ser., 1.529, 2.32&#150;3), and Mrs Montagu noted that people were disgusted at the will. One feature of the will seems to have escaped comment: Chesterfield's reference to the Almighty as &#145;Eternal, Supreme, Intelligent&#146;, reflecting a rational deism, comes close to flattering God.<br>
<br>Chesterfield's <span class="italic">Letters</span> to his son Philip were published in 1774 by James Dodsley, who gave Eugenia, Philip's widow, 1500 guineas for the copyright. A half-hearted attempt by the executors to prevent publication finished in a settlement. The <span class="italic">Letters</span> were followed in March 1777 by the <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works</span>, published by the Dilly brothers Edward and Charles, edited by Matthew Maty, and completed by J. O. Justamond, which included a long biographical introduction and essays from <span class="italic">Old England</span> and <span class="italic">The World</span>. The following month there appeared seven of the <span class="italic">Characters</span>&#151;sketches of contemporaries such as Walpole, Hardwicke, Henry Fox, and Pitt&#151;and perhaps the best of Chesterfield's work. In 1778 the Dilly brothers printed sixteen characters. Thirty-six additional letters, communicated to him by Chesterfield's grandson Philip Stanhope, were published in 1787 by Dodsley. Lord Mahon edited the complete works in five volumes in 1845&#150;53, including four characters not previously printed. Meanwhile the letters to Chesterfield's godson were lying at Bretby until rescued and printed by Lord Carnarvon in 1890, with a substantial memoir of the author. The letters to Arthur Charles Stanhope, Sturdy's father, were first printed in 1817 and reissued as an appendix to Lord Carnarvon's second edition, and the letters to Lord Huntingdon, edited by A. F. Steuart, were published by the Medici Press in 1923. There followed in 1930 a volume of the correspondence between Chesterfield and Newcastle, edited by Sir Richard Lodge for the <span class="roman">Camden Series</span> of the Royal Historical Society. In 1932 Bonamy Dobr&eacute;e produced a six-volume collection of all the letters, the first volume of which contained a 225-page life of the earl, in a limited edition of 900 copies, published by Eyre and Spottiswoode. In the first volume Dobr&eacute;e included notes on the previous editions. Finally, in 1937, S. L. Gulick edited twenty-six more letters to the godson in <span class="italic">Some Unpublished Letters of Lord Chesterfield</span>, for the University of California Press. There have also been numerous selections, abridgements, pocket editions, and translations.<br>
<br>Of the miscellaneous writings sometimes attributed to Chesterfield by far the most successful was <span class="italic">The Oeconomy of Human Life</span>, published in November 1750. The formula was a common eighteenth-century one&#151;letters home by a foreigner, sometimes a Chinese or Persian, but this time an Indian&#151;permitting gentle satire. <span class="italic">The Oeconomy</span> was translated into a number of foreign languages and repeatedly reprinted. Chesterfield's part in it is not absolutely clear. In 1750, for example, the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> &#145;industriously attributed&#146; the work &#145;to a noble earl, distinguished by his genius and the elegance of his writings and speeches&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 20, 1750, 483) and Chesterfield's authorship was restated in <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> (Oct 1854). However, Dobr&eacute;e did not regard it as by Chesterfield, though he offered no comment. More recently scholars have predominantly rejected Chesterfield's hand and attribute the work to Robert Dodsley, who may have encouraged the earl's association to increase sales. A second part of <span class="italic">The Oeconomy</span>, which followed at once, was repudiated by Dodsley, and is assumed to be a pirate enterprise, probably by John Hill, a quack physician and occasional writer. Chesterfield's known miscellaneous writings were essays contributed to <span class="italic">The Craftsman</span>, to <span class="italic">Common Sense</span>, <span class="italic">Old England</span>, and <span class="italic">The World</span>. The poetic and satirical squibs, including one directed at Queen Caroline, though admired, do not have the cutting edge of those by Hervey or Charles Hanbury-Williams. Among the political pamphlets attributed to Chesterfield, either in full or in part, were <span class="italic">The Case of the Hanover Forces in the Pay of Great Britain &hellip; Examined</span> (1743), <span class="italic">The Interest of Hanover Steadily Pursued</span> (1743), <span class="italic">Vindication of a Late Pamphlet</span> (1743), and <span class="italic">An Apology for a Late Resignation</span> (1748). The <span class="italic">Characters</span>, never printed in his lifetime, were polished and shrewd descriptions of his contemporaries, and have been much used by historians. Written after Chesterfield's retirement from active service, they were free from vituperation, relaxed, and fair-minded.<br>
<br>Chesterfield's wit, celebrated in a number of collections and anthologies, has suffered from the passage of years. Hervey and Walpole insisted that it was prefabricated, and Johnson remarked that, though he had thought Chesterfield a lord among wits, he was only a wit among lords. Nevertheless, at its best it has a playful gentleness, almost whimsical in character. In 1748 he said of Field Marshal Wade's house in Cork Street, built for elegance rather than convenience, that, although one could not live in it, it would be worth buying the house opposite to look at it. His humour mellowed with age, becoming self-deprecating and rueful. His deafness was so acute, he wrote, that his great enjoyment was his garden, where he could converse with his fellow vegetables. His comment in 1768 on the death of the duke of Newcastle, so often his adversary, was far from unkind: &#145;my old kinsman and contemporary is at last dead, and for the first time quiet&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 6.2872). Of himself, he remarked: &#145;Tyrawley and I have been dead these two years, but we don't choose to have it known&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 2.211).<br>
<br>As a patron of literature and the arts, Chesterfield was not always fortunate. Though Lady Chesterfield was a keen supporter of the opera, the earl had little interest in music, and his deafness would in any case have made enjoyment difficult. He was a keen collector of books and his libraries were highly regarded: he advised his son to collect for use, and not for binding or appearance. He purchased paintings regularly and was in negotiation for two during his final month, winning the approval of Horace Walpole (no easy feat) for a nicely turned <i>bon mot</i>. His literary patronage was not conspicuously successful. Alexander Pope was too haughty and independent to admit to a patron, though he and Chesterfield were on close terms and Pope was included among the earl's <span class="italic">Characters</span>. His acquaintance with foreign savants such as Montesquieu and Voltaire was not one of patronage. Robert Dodsley and David Mallet were minor figures. Henry Jones, &#145;the bricklayer poet&#146;, repaid Chesterfield's very substantial help by trying to borrow money from his servants and was cast into outer darkness; for James Hammond, Chesterfield wrote a kind preface to his posthumous poems, but Johnson, in the <span class="italic">Lives of the Poets</span>, had the last word: &#145;of the prefacer, whoever he was, it may be reasonably suspected that he never read the poems&#146;. Horace Walpole dismissed Chesterfield in 1750 as &#145;the patron of bad authors and bad actors&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 20.142). Chesterfield's attempt to help Johnson by praising his <span class="italic">Dictionary</span> in <span class="italic">The World</span> misfired badly. He was scarcely to blame and was unlucky to have plumbed the deep well of Johnson's pride and bitterness:<blockquote>is not a Patron, my Lord, one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water, and, when he has reached ground, encumbers him with help? &hellip; Such treatment I did not expect, for I never had a patron before. (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.256&#150;67)</blockquote>But Chesterfield handled the matter with dignity and adroitness, and Johnson, in his later years, came close to recanting.<br>

<a name="cosubject_24835"></a><span class="headword">Petronilla Melusina Stanhope <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em> von der Schulenburg]</span></span>, <i>suo jure</i> countess of Walsingham, and countess of Chesterfield  (1693&#150;1778), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24834/', "Ehrengarde Melusina von der Schulenburg, duchess of Kendal (1667&#150;1743)")</script>, the mistress of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10538/', "George I")</script>. She was baptized as the child of Friedrich Achaz von der Schulenburg and his wife, Margrethe Gertrud, but her real father was George I (1660&#150;1727). Her paternity was never formally acknowledged and she passed as the duchess's niece. Her elder sister, Anne Louise, was born in 1692, and her younger, Gertrud, in 1701. She became maid of honour to Sophia, electress of Hanover, in 1711, and with her sisters travelled to England in 1714. She retained all her life a heavy German accent. In 1722 she was made a British citizen and created countess of Walsingham for life. After her marriage to Philip Dormer Stanhope, earl of Chesterfield on 5 September 1733, she was known as Lady Chesterfield. The countess and her husband led rather separate lives, but she accompanied him to Dublin when he became lord lieutenant and did the honours when he fell ill. There were no children of the marriage. Lady Chesterfield died on 16 September 1778 and was buried in the South Audley Street Chapel with her mother and sister Anne.<br>
<br>The earldom and estates passed to <a name="cosubject_26254"></a><span class="headword">Philip Stanhope</span>, fifth earl of Chesterfield  (1755&#150;1815), <span class="occ">politician</span>, who was born on 10 November 1755, the son of Arthur Charles Stanhope (<i>d</i>. 1770) of Mansfield Woodhouse (a great-great-grandson of the first earl) and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Headlam (<i>d</i>. 1764). He succeeded to his father's estates in March 1770 and to the earldom in March 1773. He married, first, on 20 August 1777, Anne (1759&#150;1798), the daughter of the Revd Thomas Thistlethwaite; she died on 20 October 1798, and on 2 May 1799 Chesterfield married Lady Henrietta Thynne (1762&#150;1813), the third daughter of the first marquess of Bath, who died at Chesterfield House, London, on 31 May 1813. He was felt to have acted harshly in 1777 when he refused to intervene to save his former tutor, William Dodd, from the gallows for forging a draft on him for &pound;4200. He spoke occasionally at first in the House of Lords, mainly on formal occasions, and supported Lord North and then William Pitt. No speeches by him are recorded after 1792. He was often at court and he and both his wives were on cordial terms with George III and Queen Charlotte. He held a number of undemanding posts, as lord lieutenant of Buckinghamshire (1781&#150;2); ambassador to Spain (1783&#150;7), which he never took up; master of the Royal Mint (1789&#150;90); joint postmaster-general (1790&#150;98); and master of the horse (1798&#150;1804). His appointment as ambassador in December 1783 was seen by Horace Walpole as evidence of the feebleness of Pitt's fledgeling ministry, and he dismissed the fifth earl as &#145;a worthless young man, universally despised&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 33.430, n. 2). Nevertheless, he was given the Garter in January 1805. A painting of 1810 by Weaver shows him as a short, corpulent man, incongruously wearing the sash of the Garter while inspecting a prize heifer in the stables. The eighteenth-century house at Bretby was allowed to fall into decay, and Chesterfield employed Wyatville to begin building a heavy castellated mansion, finished after his death by his only son, the sixth earl. He died at Bretby on 29 August 1815.<br>
