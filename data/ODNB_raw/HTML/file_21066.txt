<span class="headword">Pacifico,  David</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Don Pacifico]</span>  (1784?&#150;1854), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was a Sephardic Jew of Italian descent. Accounts of his early life, founded on his own conflicting statements, vary considerably. The child of parents married at the Bevis Marks Synagogue, London, in 1761, he variously gave his birthplace as Oran or Gibraltar, and once claimed Spanish nationality. While resident in Portugal, he allegedly suffered for his liberal sympathies at the hands of the legitimists. As compensation, the victorious liberals made him consul in Morocco and Portuguese by naturalization (1835). In 1837 he moved to Athens as consul-general, an appointment he lost in 1842. His duties, light in Greece, were combined with trade.<br>
<br>Pacifico achieved international notoriety in April 1847. To avoid offence to a visiting financier, a Paris Rothschild, the authorities banned the burning of Judas Iscariot in effigy from the Orthodox Easter celebrations. Popular resentment was visited on Pacifico, prominent in the small Jewish community. Police allowed the mob to sack his house. As a British subject, with the legation's support, he sought some &pound;32,000 compensation from an unresponsive Greek government. On instructions from Lord Palmerston interest at 10 per cent was added, with &pound;500 for physical violence and distress inflicted. While another claim of Pacifico's for land acquired by the state was accepted, Greek ministers ignored or evaded representations about his losses in the riot.<br>
<br>Britain eventually deployed her fleet in January 1850, giving Greece twenty-four hours to meet the demands in this and other outstanding cases. Underlying the Anglo-Greek dispute and Palmerston's high-handed action was the resistance of the Bavarian King Otto of Greece to the constitutionalism Palmerston preached. The ensuing blockade elicited protests from France and Russia; co-founders with Britain of the Greek kingdom, they objected to the British attitude. France, backed by the tsar, negotiated a settlement, but not before British tactics provoked the recall of her ambassador in London (May 1850). The British minister in Athens, Thomas Wyse, used force to compel acceptance on terms less favourable to Greece (28 April) than those agreed a few days earlier between Britain and France in London (19 April). Wyse pleaded the absence of instructions from Palmerston, who placated France by adhering, substantially, to the London convention (20 June). Under its provisions, the figure put on Pacifico's compensation, based on claims which Palmerston conceded were inflated, was drastically reduced.<br>
<br>The combined forces of the parliamentary opposition at Westminster attacked Palmerston's handling of the whole question. In a celebrated speech (25 June), he asserted Britain's right to ensure that her subjects everywhere enjoyed the security of Roman citizens in their day. Even such a man as Pacifico might say, as it were, &#145;Civis Romanus sum&#146;, and receive armed assistance  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 112, 1850, 444). Unenforceable against powerful countries, the declaration was one of equality with nations strong enough to overawe weaker states. It won a majority of forty-six in a full house, and delighted the public. Gladstone, who deplored British methods in Greece, thought the defence &#145;extraordinary and masterly&#146;  (Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 4.221). Palmerston condemned the racial prejudice evident in references to Pacifico, &#145;as if &hellip; because a man is of the Jewish persuasion, he is fair game for any outrage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 112, 1850, 387). In more senses than one, he gained a famous victory for contemporary liberalism. Nevertheless, Pacifico embarrassed his co-religionists. When he died at 15 Bury Street, London, on 12 April 1854 and was buried on 14 April at the Spanish and Portuguese Jews' burial-ground at Mile End Road, London, the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span> (21 April) merely noted the demise of &#145;this individual who &hellip; caused so much sensation in the political world&#146;.<br>
