</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blaquiere,  John</span>, first Baron de Blaquiere  (1732&#150;1812), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 15 May 1732, the fifth son of Jean de Blaquiere (1675/6&#150;1753), an &eacute;migr&eacute; Huguenot merchant of Greenwich, Kent, and Mary Elizabeth, daughter of Pierre de Varennes, a Huguenot bookseller of the Strand, Westminster. His contemporaries describe him variously. James Caulfeild, first earl of Charlemont, contemptuously dismisses him as &#145;a man of low birth, no property and weak genius&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 4.108n). According to John Lees, an astute commentator and former private secretary to the Irish viceroys, lords Townshend and Harcourt, he had a &#145;manly mind&#146;, but &#145;in other respects has all the vanity of a foolish boy of fifteen&#146;  (John Lees [to Auckland], 13 March [1798], Sneyd papers, PRONI, T/3229/2/29).<br>
<br>Blaquiere was employed in the counting-house of a London merchant before taking up a military career. He entered the army in an Irish regiment, becoming a major of the 18th dragoons in 1759, and a brevet lieutenant-colonel in 1762. In the following year he became a lieutenant-colonel in the 17th dragoons. In 1771 he was appointed secretary to Simon Harcourt, first Earl Harcourt, who was ambassador-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary to Paris. When Harcourt went to Ireland in 1772 as lord lieutenant, Blaquiere accompanied him as his chief secretary. In the same year he was sworn of the privy council. He retired from the army the following year because of his onerous official duties.<br>
<br>As Harcourt's &#145;ostensible Minister of the [Irish] House of Commons&#146;, Blaquiere was chiefly responsible for creating and maintaining a government majority in it  (Harcourt to Rochford, 6 March 1774, <span class="italic">Calendar of Home Office Papers, 1773&#150;1775</span>, 1899, 3.193). Indeed, W. Hunt states that he &#145;exercised an authority in the House of Commons which, combined with his tactical skill, was of the highest value on any critical occasion&#146;  (Hunt, xxvi). Remoteness from London often bedevilled the Irish administration's relations with the British government&#151;official dispatches did not always communicate sufficient detail to British ministers. Consequently Blaquiere found it necessary to travel to London to discuss policy on sensitive issues. For example, during the summer and autumn of 1773 he canvassed support for a controversial tax on absentee landlords. This special mission was to act as a precedent for many more of the kind. In January 1775 he was in London again, this time seeking approval for Henry Flood's appointment as joint vice-treasurer of Ireland&#151;a post traditionally bestowed on members of the British parliament. However, there were still difficulties, and on one occasion he complained to Harcourt that he had &#145;waited &hellip; three hours for the sake of three minutes conversation with Lord North [the British premier]&#146;  (Blaquiere to Harcourt, 25 Jan 1775, Harcourt, 9.296).<br>
<br>When Blaquiere left office in 1776, along with Harcourt, he continued to participate actively in Irish politics, and remained in residence in Ireland&#151;the only chief secretary, it was generally remarked, known to have done so when the pay of that office ceased. In reward for his services to the Irish administration he was invested in 1774 with the Order of the Bath, and created a baronet ten years later. He represented a number of constituencies in the Irish parliament until its legislative union with the parliament of Great Britain in 1800: Old Leighlin, co. Carlow (1773&#150;83); Carlingford, co. Louth (1783&#150;90); Charleville, co. Cork (1790&#150;97); and Newtownards, co. Down (1797&#150;1800).<br>
<br>Blaquiere was a regular speaker in the Irish House of Commons and made an important contribution to the debate on the regency issue in 1789, supporting the address calling on the prince of Wales to assume the regency of Ireland. Indeed, he won considerable praise from Charles Bingham, first earl of Lucan, who declared that &#145;Blaquiere deserves public thanks for cutting up the odious wretch [George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, first marquess of Buckingham, the Irish viceroy] as he did&#146;  (Lucan to Edmund Sexton Pery, 12 Feb 1789, <span class="italic">Buckinghamshire MSS</span>, 196). It was one of the few occasions in his political career that he did not follow the Irish administration's policy line. However, Buckingham was so unpopular on both sides of the Irish Sea that his opposition did not damage seriously his reputation as a stalwart government supporter.<br>
<br>Blaquiere was also at the centre of controversy when the issue of the legislative union was being contested. In return for his support he obtained an Irish peerage and became Baron de Blaquiere of Ardkill, co. Londonderry, on 30 July 1800. He had hoped to acquire a representative peerage, but the British government resisted strongly. However, Lord Castlereagh, then Irish chief secretary, was forced to offer him an alternative reward&#151;an Irish pension of &pound;1000 per annum for the lives of his wife and daughter, &pound;700 to be put on the pension list from March 1802, and &pound;300 from March 1803.<br>
<br>Although one of Blaquiere's first experiences on Irish soil was a duel, in 1773, with the reckless Beauchamp Bagenal, MP for co. Carlow, he enjoyed his time in Ireland. On 24 December 1775 he married Eleanor (1755/6&#150;1833), daughter and heir of Robert Dobson of Anne's Grove, co. Cork, and his wife, Maria, coheir of Alexander Tompkins of Prehen, co. Londonderry, who brought him the Ardkill estate. They had four sons and three daughters. Apart from the chief secretaryship he held other Irish offices. He was appointed alnager of Ireland and bailiff of the Phoenix Park in 1775, a trustee of the linen board in 1784, and a commissioner of the Dublin paving board in 1786. He earned a reputation for being a jobber and pluralist, but he was popular with his peers and took great pleasure in entertaining them. Jonah Barrington comments:<blockquote>to his jobbing is that capital [Dublin] indebted for its wide streets, paving, lighting, and convenient fountains. He made as much as he could of these works, it is true; but every farthing he acquired in Ireland he expended in it. (Barrington, 1.188)</blockquote>After the Union Blaquiere spent a good deal of his time in London. He represented the constituencies of Rye in Sussex (1801&#150;2) and Downton in Wiltshire (1803&#150;6) in the parliament of the United Kingdom. Initially he supported Addington's ministry, but later he wavered, favouring Pitt's return to power. He voted for the abolition of the slave trade, and opposed Catholic relief. Though well into his seventies, he continued to speak and vote regularly, and finished his parliamentary career in opposition to the ministry of all the talents. He was left without a seat at the dissolution in 1806. He died at Bray, co. Wicklow, aged eighty, on 27 August 1812.<br>
