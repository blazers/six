<span class="headword">Muir, Sir  Robert</span>  (1864&#150;1959), <span class="occ">pathologist</span>, was born at Balfron, Stirlingshire, on 5 July 1864, the second child and only son of the Revd Robert Muir (<i>d</i>. 1882), a Presbyterian minister of saintly character and decidedly liberal outlook, and his wife, Susan Cameron, daughter of William Duncan, a Dundee merchant. Soon after Muir's birth his father became minister of Allans Church, Hawick. One of Muir's four sisters wrote short stories, another was a classical scholar of Edinburgh University, and the youngest, Anne Davidson Muir, acquired fame in Scotland as a painter in watercolours, especially of flowers. In later life Muir, who never married, lived with two of his sisters.<br>
<br>Following a brilliant career at Hawick high school and at Teviot Grove Academy, Muir entered the University of Edinburgh in 1880 with the Sir Walter Scott bursary in classics and mathematics. He graduated MA in 1884 and MB, CM with first-class honours in 1888, after obtaining the Grierson bursary and the much coveted Vans Dunlop research scholarship. He also undertook coaching, for his father's death left him with considerable family responsibilities. Nevertheless he chose the rather precarious career of pathology, largely through the influence of William Smith Greenfield, Edinburgh's unrivalled pathologist and clinician. Muir acquired valuable experience as a clinician, bacteriologist, and what was later called haematologist as assistant to Greenfield (1892&#150;8) and lecturer on pathological bacteriology (1894&#150;8). He examined at the university and at the royal colleges of physicians and surgeons of Edinburgh and fostered closer personal contacts between staff and students, with whom he was a universal favourite. With James Ritchie, lecturer in pathology at Oxford, he wrote the <span class="italic">Manual of Bacteriology</span> (1897) which went through many editions.<br>
<br>In 1898 Muir was called to the new chair of pathology at St Andrews, held in Dundee, where his reputation as an original researcher and far-seeing administrator led to the offer of the chair of pathology at Glasgow, which he held from 1899 until 1936. There he gained world fame as a teacher, investigator, and writer, for in 1924 his <span class="italic">Textbook of Pathology</span> became a substantial success and long maintained a place among the leaders. Muir served on the university court at Glasgow, the Medical Research Council (1928&#150;32), the councils of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund and the British Empire Cancer Campaign, and on committees for the investigation of foot and mouth disease. During the First World War he held the rank of lieutenant-colonel and was in charge of the pathological and bacteriological routine of the 3rd and 4th Scottish general hospitals, and also acted as inspector of laboratories in Scotland. Elected FRS in 1911 he served on the council (1926&#150;7) and was awarded a royal medal for his work on immunity in 1929. He was knighted in 1934, and received numerous honorary degrees and fellowships; he was awarded the Lister medal for 1936.<br>
<br>Muir's discoveries fit so well into the mosaic of progress in pathology that it is difficult to realize now how fresh and original they seemed at the time of their announcement. His papers teem with unusual observations and offer many admirable lessons in planning and explaining experiments for the young pathologist. Muir was an unrivalled exponent on diseases of the blood cells, largely because he realized that much of their puzzling behaviour reflects the closely geared relationship between the bone marrow, where the red corpuscles and many of the white corpuscles are formed, and the sites of cell destruction. From these studies came fundamental knowledge about the processes during infection. Red cell destruction was linked up with iron metabolism, since these corpuscles are important iron carriers, and this led him to explain some of the anomalies of anaemia. This brought him to immunology, where he raised the status of the United Kingdom in world immunology. In his latter years he returned to the problems of cancer and in a brilliant series of papers devoted to cancer of the breast he clarified the relationship between the various types. His microscopical study of Paget's disease of the nipple is unsurpassed and has left no doubt about the serious nature of this misleading disease.<br>
<br>Muir was a shy, aloof man who gave praise rarely, never shirked an unpleasant duty, yet seldom made an enemy. Only his most intimate friends knew of the warm heart which was carefully concealed by a deliberately cultivated austerity. He knew instinctively when young people needed help and made it his business to see that it was forthcoming. His habit of absent-mindedly pocketing other people's matches, his fanatical devotion to golf, and his ill-concealed delight in deflating pompous colleagues endeared him to his juniors. Many good stories are told of him, some no doubt invented, for his Olympian reserve was fair game for boisterous Scottish students. They were devoted to the one and only &#145;Bobby&#146; and he in turn loved them all.<br>
<br>Muir retired in 1936 and spent the remainder of his life in Edinburgh where he quietly pursued his interest in botany and geology, fished a stream, or played his favourite golf and bridge. He flew to Australia to see his eldest sister when he was close upon ninety; he died peacefully at 25 Belgrave Crescent, Edinburgh, on 30 March 1959.<br>
