<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Syme, Sir  Ronald</span>  (1903&#150;1989), <span class="occ">Roman historian</span>, was born on 11 March 1903 in Eltham, a small market town in the province of Taranaki in the North Island of New Zealand. He was the elder son and eldest of three children of David Simpson Syme, solicitor, and his wife, Florence Mabel Selley. He was educated at Eltham primary school and Stratford district high school, where his interest in Latin was strongly encouraged by a first-class teacher, Miss Tooman. From 1918 to 1920 he attended New Plymouth Boys' High School, of which he was dux in 1919/20, winning a junior university scholarship. From 1921 to 1923 he was a student at Victoria University of Wellington, studying English, Latin, French, jurisprudence, and constitutional history. In the second year he added Greek; it is a very striking sign of his extraordinary linguistic aptitude, as demonstrated a few years later in Oxford, that it was only then that his formal study of Greek began. From 1922 to 1924, while still technically a student at Victoria, he was studying extramurally at the University of Auckland, to which he transferred formally in 1924. In 1923/4 he acted as assistant to the professor of classics, H. S. Dettmann. The story that in this role, after the professor took a headmastership, he set, sat, and marked his own papers for the BA in 1923 is unfortunately only a legend.<br>
<br>In 1924/5 Syme studied for an MA in classics at Auckland, winning first-class honours in Latin, a senior scholarship in Greek, Latin, and French, and a postgraduate scholarship in arts, which brought him in the autumn of 1925 to Oriel College, Oxford, to study <i>literae humaniores</i>, which then consisted of ancient history and philosophy. He was not to return to New Zealand until 1950, but remained profoundly attached to it, its mountain scenery, and memories of seeing Halley's comet in the clear New Zealand sky of 1910. His first and best-known book, <span class="italic">The Roman Revolution</span> (1939), was dedicated to his parents and his homeland (&#145;parentibus optimis patriaeque&#146;), and he kept his New Zealand citizenship throughout his life, speaking with unusual passion of the state-sponsored terrorism practised there by the French government in the matter of the sinking of a Greenpeace ship.<br>
<br>In Oxford Syme was deeply influenced by his tutor in ancient history, Marcus Niebuhr Tod, a specialist in the illumination of Greek history through the careful study of inscriptions, and famed for the delicacy and precision of his language, both spoken and written. Syme's own linguistic gifts were shown in the remarkable feat of his winning the Chancellor's prize for Latin prose and the Gaisford prize for Greek prose in 1926 (some five years after beginning Greek); these were followed by the Gaisford prize for Greek verse in 1927.<br>
<br>This quite outstanding talent had two consequences, the one merely of incidental interest, the other fundamental to his whole career. The former was a brilliant series of vignettes of Oxford life of the 1930s, in both Latin and Greek and in prose and verse, published in the <span class="italic">Oxford Magazine</span> (&#145;de coniuratione Bodleiana&#146;; or a memorable evocation in Homeric verse of a scene involving Provost L. R. Phelps at Oriel high table). More important was the fact that the areas of his attention, within Roman history, were always to be directed to those periods from which there survives contemporary literature in Latin. In his entire output Greek history is represented only by a single essay on Thucydides; and, with the exception of Strabo, the vast Greek historical literature of the Roman period did not engage his attention.<br>
<br>But first Syme had to take his degree, achieving a first (with rather modest marks in philosophy) in 1927; a typically elegant note from M. N. Tod informing him of the result is preserved in the extensive archive of Syme's papers which was at Wolfson College, Oxford, and is now held in the Bodleian Library. Tod continued to lend him his support, which led very quickly, in the fashion of the Oxford of those days, to his election as fellow and tutor in ancient history of Trinity College, Oxford, in 1929.<br>
<br>The decade which Syme spent at Trinity until the outbreak of the Second World War was his happiest and most creative period. Indeed it had already begun in 1928, a year after he took his finals, with an article on the legions under Domitian. That was a sign of one enduring preoccupation: military history, painstakingly reconstructed from literary sources and inscriptions, and set against the vast and varied landscapes of the Roman empire, from Spain to the Euphrates. With that went a deep engagement with European, especially German, scholarship. His command of both French and German was very considerable, but his knowledge of French was more typically deployed in an exhaustive acquaintance with modern novels. In German, however, there was not only a wide knowledge of literature, some of which&#151;like parts of Goethe's <span class="italic">Faust</span>&#151;he knew by heart, but also a profound relationship to the German scholarship of the previous few decades: not so much Theodor Mommsen, however, as W. Schulze's study of Roman names; the great article &#145;Legio&#146; by E. Ritterling in Pauly-Wissowa's <span class="italic">Realencyclopaedie</span>; Friedrich M&uuml;nzer on the history of Roman aristocratic families; perhaps (this is not so clear as might be supposed) Matthias Gelzer on the Roman nobility; and above all the two editions of the <span class="italic">Prosopographia imperii Romani</span> (1897 and 1933&#150;). Reading in the library was supplemented by many visits to Germany and the Balkans, when he also walked long distances to gain a detailed understanding of the landscape.<br>
<br>Military history was perhaps the most obvious product of Syme's studies until the end of the 1930s, culminating in his still unsurpassed article entitled &#145;Flavian wars and frontiers&#146; in the <span class="italic">Cambridge Ancient History</span>, vol. 10 (1936). But already other dominating themes of his work were developing. Among his papers later given to Wolfson College, there is a manuscript draft dated 1934 of a book entitled &#145;The provincial at Rome&#146;, to which he refers in the preface of his <span class="italic">Tacitus</span> (1958):<blockquote>It is suitable to confess in this place that the concluding section, &#145;The new Romans&#146; (Chapters XLIII&#150;XLV), owes something to a book begun many years ago, soon interrupted, and not yet terminated&#151;&#145;The provincial at Rome&#146;.</blockquote>It never was to be terminated, though <span class="italic">Colonial Elites</span> (1958) also owes much to it. But it is now clear how rapidly the main lines of his thought had developed, and how consistently he maintained them to the end of his life. The text of &#145;The provincial at Rome&#146;, scrupulously edited by Anthony Birley, has been published as <span class="italic">The Provincial at Rome</span> and <span class="italic">Rome and the Balkans, 80 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>&#150;<span class="smallcap">AD</span> 14</span> (1999).<br>
<br>An interest in the &#145;provincial&#146; coming to the centre from the periphery must, obviously, have owed much to Syme's background. But there are more general aspects to his use of prosopography, which he turned into a dominant mode in Roman history: the study of families over generations, the interplay of literary and epigraphical evidence; the structure of public careers; the possibility of filling the stage of Roman history not just with the Pompeys, Caesars, and Augustuses, but with a host of lesser mortals. All these themes came together, along with his reactions to the rise of the inter-war dictatorships and their gross misuse of language, to produce <span class="italic">The Roman Revolution</span>, finished in 1938 when he was thirty-five, and published in 1939. As a work of literature, and as an exercise in intellectual and stylistic control, it has no equal in the historiography of Rome, and few in that of any period or area.<br>
<br>The war then imposed a quite long hiatus, when Syme served in the Balkans, and was then professor of classical philology in Istanbul. He did indeed teach classics there; as to what other roles he played (as he certainly did), he never, to the end, gave the smallest hint. But one thing which he did was to give close attention to Strabo's account of Asia Minor. His work on this topic was published posthumously by Anthony Birley as <span class="italic">Anatolia: Studies in Strabo</span> (1995).<br>
<br>The post-war period saw Syme back in Oxford, where in 1949 he succeeded H. M. Last as Camden professor of ancient history, and fellow of Brasenose. It was very unfortunate that Last, a major figure but not to be compared with Syme in intellectual creativity, was there still as principal. Their profound disagreements, which the surviving correspondence shows to have been Last's fault, significantly soured his life at Brasenose and his attitude to it.<br>
<br>None the less it was in 1958 that Syme published the most original and creative of his works, the infinitely complex and fruitful two-volume work <span class="italic">Tacitus</span>, accompanied by <span class="italic">Colonial Elites</span>, and followed by his Sather lectures, <span class="italic">Sallust</span> (1964). A wider recognition came: in 1959 a knighthood, in 1976 the Order of Merit, as well as twenty honorary doctorates, and memberships of foreign academies. In 1956 (though no earlier) he made the first of many, ever more frequent, journeys across the Atlantic. All his life an extremely private person, Syme rarely developed close relations with colleagues, and tended to gain more pleasure from passing, if repeated, contacts with academic acquaintances made during his travels.<br>
<br>Before his retirement in 1970 Syme had developed a fascination, possibly excessive, with the late fourth-century collection of imperial biographies in Latin known as the <span class="italic">Historia Augusta</span>. In the same period, however, the generous initiative of the newly founded Wolfson College, Oxford, led to his election as a fellow and to his occupation of a fine penthouse apartment overlooking the River Cherwell, where he worked with great contentment, very productively, publishing <span class="italic">History in Ovid</span> (1978), <span class="italic">Some Arval Brethren</span> (1980), and a work of remarkable complexity, interest, and novelty, <span class="italic">The Augustan Aristocracy</span> (1986), at the age of eighty-three&#151;not to speak of over fifty papers published in the 1980s.<br>
<br>Always extremely sociable, provided that his essential reserve was respected, Syme never married, something which was not in the least a sign of aversion from the opposite sex, or even of an inability to form a long and deeply affectionate relationship. Never inclined to superfluous expenditure, on clothes or anything else, he none the less maintained to very near the end a brisk and military appearance, walking wherever possible, and at a pace which only very late began to slow to that of ordinary mortals. His reserve also softened somewhat in later years, when he found the support of younger scholars and their families, who regarded him with affection, without rivalry, and with no thought of obtrusion beyond what he wished. The cheerful, multinational society of Wolfson also offered him both stimulus and a more comfortable environment than he had ever enjoyed before, while respecting his privacy.<br>
<br>Late in August 1989, when already suffering from cancer, he collapsed in his room in Wolfson, and never fully regained consciousness, dying only four days before a party, to be held by the college, which would have celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of <span class="italic">The Roman Revolution</span>. This book, together with <span class="italic">Tacitus</span>, remains the main memorial to his unique contribution to Roman history; he is universally acknowledged as its greatest practitioner in the twentieth century. His particular qualities are not easy to summarize, and the true importance of his work can hardly yet be assessed. But his qualities included sheer intelligence, and a memory of legendary accuracy; great sensitivity to language, and vast reading; an intense engagement with the individual lives and family histories which can be brought out from behind the surface of Latin inscriptions and Roman literature; and a sense of style, which could lapse into idiosyncrasy. That style is shown at its best in the last paragraph of his <span class="italic">Tacitus</span>, which may also serve as his own epitaph:<blockquote>The irony is restrained and impressive. When Tacitus wrote, colonials and provincials from the Latin West occupied the place of the Caesars. There was only one higher pinnacle: literary renown. To that also the epoch of Trajan and Hadrian might confidently aspire. Men and dynasties pass, but style abides.</blockquote>He died on 4 September 1989 in the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford.<br>
