<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilson, Sir  Arnold Talbot</span>  (1884&#150;1940), <span class="occ">colonial administrator and politician</span>, was born on 18 July 1884 at Clifton, Bristol, the eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36960/', "James Maurice Wilson (1836&#150;1931)")</script>, headmaster and clergyman, and his second wife, Georgina Mary (<i>d</i>. 1926), the eldest daughter of Admiral John Thomas Talbot of Clifton. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36961/', "Sir (James) Steuart Wilson")</script> was his brother and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70137/', "Mona Wilson")</script>, his half-sister. He was educated at his father's school, Clifton College, and at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, from which he passed out first in his year, with the king's medal and the sword of honour. He was commissioned in 1903 and was soon posted to the 32nd Sikh pioneers. He was transferred to the Indian political department in 1909, and served in Persia, where he established a reputation as a strong, resilient, and resourceful officer. He was over 6 feet tall, with a broad frame and great physical stamina, an extraordinary memory, unusual skills as a linguist, and complete self-confidence. He was consul at Muhammarah in 1909&#150;11 and second assistant at Bushehr from 1912 to 1913. When surveying the districts of Lurestan and Fars, travelling in Persian dress, he was twice captured by local tribesmen but managed to escape. In consequence he was made CMG and awarded the Macgregor memorial medal of the united services of India in 1912. In 1913 he was made deputy British commissioner, and in 1914 commissioner, of the multi-national Turko-Persian Frontier Commission.<br>
<br>Wilson spent most of the First World War in Mesopotamia. In 1915 he became deputy chief political officer, under Sir Percy Cox, to the Indian expeditionary force occupying Basrah. At Nasiriyyah, as part of his wartime brief of reconnoitring enemy positions, he bravely and successfully swam a long distance along a canal under heavy Turkish fire, an exploit for which he was made DSO in 1916. However, this was also the year in which his military exploits came to an end. Cox formed a civil administration in Mesopotamia, and Wilson served as one of its leading figures. In March 1918, when Cox was transferred to Persia, Wilson took over as acting civil commissioner and political resident in the Persian Gulf. Now, with the ending of the war, the British took a firm administrative grip of Mesopotamia (soon to be called Iraq), which was divided into fourteen divisions, each under a political officer responsible to Wilson in Baghdad.<br>
<br>Initially Wilson won high praise. In 1919 he was appointed CSI and a knight of the order of St John of Jerusalem, while the following year, at the age of only thirty-five, he became KCIE. A man who never doubted the essential beneficence of the British empire, he seemed destined for a career as a distinguished pro-consul. In May 1920, however, a full-scale insurrection broke out in Iraq. Its causes were complex, including local fears that, despite past promises of liberating the Arabs, Britain was setting up its own form of colonial rule. Wilson said the insurrection was the result of &#145;anarchy plus fanaticism&#146;  (Pearce, 64); but the consensus, in the words of Gertrude Bell, the oriental secretary in Baghdad, was that &#145;we tried to govern too much&#146;. The chief culprit, she and others decided, was Wilson&#151;who had &#145;done as much harm as any individual could do&#146;  (Pearce, 67). Lacking flexibility, he had been too reluctant to devolve power upon local notables.<br>
<br>In August 1920, to allay unrest, Wilson advised setting up an Arab administration under Feisal, son of Sherif Hussein. This was the solution eventually accepted, but for the moment the British cabinet took no decision other than to send back Cox. When he arrived, in October, Wilson decided to resign rather than suffer an effective demotion. His career in government service was over. Perhaps he was too much the individualist, and the man of action, to spend his whole career as a colonial official. Instead he became resident director in Persia of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. On 29 July 1922 he married Rose Caroline (<i>b</i>. 1890/91), daughter of Charles Hensley Henson of Ellesmere in Shropshire and the widow of Robin C. Carver of the RAF. They had a son and a daughter. Wilson continued to work for the company from 1926 to 1932, after his return to Britain.<br>
<br>Wilson bought a house in Much Hadham in Hertfordshire and in June 1933 won a seat as a National Conservative at a by-election in the Hitchin division of Hertfordshire. He was re-elected in 1935. He was an extremely active MP who undertook typically strenuous walks in order to get to know his constituents. The diaries he kept were published as <span class="italic">Walks and Talks</span> (1934), <span class="italic">Thoughts and Talks</span> (1938), and <span class="italic">More Thoughts and Talks</span> (1939). His aim was &#145;to present a faithful though, of course, inevitably superficial impression, interspersed with occasional references of my own, of the hopes and fears, work and play of the inhabitants of a large constituency&#146;  (Wilson, <span class="italic">Walks and Talks</span>, vii). In fact there are few more thorough assessments of public opinion in the 1930s. <span class="italic">Walks and Talks Abroad</span> (1936) recorded conversations in Germany, Italy, and Spain from May 1934 to June 1936. Wilson was indeed a prolific author, having already written <span class="italic">The Persian Gulf</span> (1928); <span class="italic">Loyalties: Mesopotamia, 1914&#150;1917</span> (1930); <span class="italic">Mesopotamia, 1917&#150;1920: a Clash of Loyalties</span> (1931); <span class="italic">Persia</span> (1932); and <span class="italic">The Suez Canal</span> (1933). In addition he edited <span class="italic">The Nineteenth Century and after</span> in 1934&#150;8 and was joint author, with Professor Hermann Levy, of <span class="italic">Industrial Assurance</span> (1937), <span class="italic">Burial Reform and Funeral Costs</span> (1938), and <span class="italic">Workmen's Compensation</span>, 2 vols. (1939&#150;41).<br>
<br>Though an admirer of Stanley Baldwin, Wilson was no orthodox Conservative back-bencher. He believed that his task was &#145;to say unpopular things that needed saying&#146;  (Griffiths, 159) and urged the government to pass bold legislation. As well as favouring birth control and easier divorce, he called for a comprehensive state system of social insurance, including family allowances. He also served on several parliamentary committees. He was chairman of the Board of Trade advisory committee on cinema films and of the Home Office committee on structural precautions against air attack.<br>
<br>Yet Wilson admitted that, whereas his instincts led him to the left in domestic policy, they led him to the right in foreign affairs. He called for rearmament from 1934 but he was no Churchillian opponent of appeasement. He met Mussolini in 1935, and was soon arguing that Britain should stand aside from the dispute over Abyssinia. Certainly he was pro-Franco, writing in June 1938: &#145;I hope to God Franco wins in Spain, and the sooner the better&#146;  (Haxey, 214). Of Hitler, whom he met in Germany several times, he wrote in 1935, &#145;I believe him to be a great instrument of peace in the world&#146;  (Haxey, 24). In 1937 he judged that Hitler was destined to become &#145;a venerable and revered figure&#146;  (Wilson, 1938, 105). Yet Wilson, who was a devout Anglican, was also on several occasions critical of the Nazi regime. He defended the Jews in conversations with Germans and admitted that at Dachau &#145;there was in the atmosphere of the camp something at which my soul revolted&#146;  (Wilson, <span class="italic">Walks and Talks Abroad</span>, 83). He called for a much-needed moderation in German policies.<br>
<br>Concerned about the threats from the USSR and from Japan, Wilson admired Chamberlain's policy of appeasement, for which he judged that he earned &#145;the unstinted gratitude of the free States of Europe&#146;  (Keith-Shaw, ix). But Wilson was not for peace at any price, and was a patriot. On the outbreak of war he volunteered to serve in the RAF, despite being fifty-five. He became a pilot officer in October and, shortly afterwards, a rear-gunner with a bomber squadron. To his constituents he pledged himself, &#145;with my own body, with my own muscles, and my own experience, such as it is, to help to bring the war to a successful conclusion&#146;  (Marlowe, 369). In his last speech to the Commons, on 7 May 1940, he commended to the house the words carved on its cross benches: &#145;Numini de patriae adsto&#146; (&#145;I stand by God and my Country&#146;). He died on 31 May 1940 when his plane was shot down over France, and was buried at Eringher, near Dunkirk. He was survived by his wife.<br>
