<span class="headword">Faussett,  Thomas Godfrey  Godfrey-</span>  (1829&#150;1877), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born in Oxford, the sixth son of the Revd Dr Godfrey Faussett (<i>d</i>. 1853), professor of divinity at Oxford, from 1827 to 1853, prebendary of Worcester in 1827, and canon of Christ Church, Oxford, and his second wife, Sarah, daughter of Thomas Wethered of Marlow. He spent most of his childhood in Worcester. He matriculated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in 1848 and graduated BA in 1851. He proceeded MA in 1854, and from 1857 to 1864 was a fellow of the college. He was called to the bar in January 1863 at Lincoln's Inn, where he specialized in conveyancing. In 1864 he married Lucy Jane, daughter of Henry Woodcock of Bank House, near Wigan. In 1869 with other members of his family, he took the surname Godfrey-Faussett.<br>
<br>Godfrey-Faussett was a great-grandson of the Kentish antiquary Bryan Faussett, whose house at Heppington had remained in the family, and he clearly felt a strong attachment to Kent. He became a member of the Archaeological Institute, was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in March 1859, and around the same time, shortly after its foundation in 1857, became a member of council of the Kent Archaeological Society. He was honorary secretary of the Kent Archaeological Society from 1863 to 1873, when he was elected a vice-president, and was also on its editorial committee.<br>
<br>Godfrey-Faussett contributed the occasional article to the Archaeological Institute's <span class="italic">Archaeological Journal</span>, most notably &#145;On the present state of the law of treasure-trove&#146; (vol. 22, 1865) and &#145;Canterbury till Domesday&#146; (vol. 32, 1875). &#145;The Saxon cemetery at Bifrons&#146;, an account of an important excavation (vol. 10, 1876; concluded after his death in vol. 13, 1880), was his principal contribution to <span class="italic">Archaeologia Cantiana</span>, the journal of the Kent Archaeological Society. He wrote a new four-column article on &#145;Canterbury&#146; for the 9th edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, as well as penning numerous epigrams and squibs, in Latin and English, which amused his many friends and occasionally appeared in print. He is also credited with a number of miscellaneous articles, including the Latin translations of several well-known hymns, in <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>, the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, and the <span class="italic">Latin Year</span>.<br>
<br>After being appointed auditor to the dean and chapter of Canterbury Cathedral in 1866, Faussett moved from London to a house in the cathedral precincts. In 1871 he became district registrar of the probate court at Canterbury also, and continued to hold both posts until his death. For the last ten years of his life he suffered from a debilitating disease, and after 1873 held a pen only for the purpose of a signature. He died at his home on 26 February 1877, survived by his wife and an only child, Edward Godfrey, born in 1868. He was buried on 2 March at Nackington, Kent, and is commemorated by a stained-glass window in the chancel of Adisham church, in the 1869 restoration of which he had taken a keen interest. Although held back by ill health from making a greater contribution to Kentish history, Godfrey-Faussett nevertheless strove to perpetuate a family tradition, and wrote a lively memoir of his great-grandfather; this was printed in an appendix to Bryan Faussett's <span class="italic">Inventorium sepulchrale</span>, edited by Charles Roach Smith, which appeared in 1861.<br>
