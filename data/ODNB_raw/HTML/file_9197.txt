<span class="headword">Farrington, Sir  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1348&#150;1416/17), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, came from the cadet branch of a well-connected Lancashire gentry family. His long military career began in the household of Sir John Chandos, by whom he was knighted before the battle of N&aacute;jera in 1367. Farrington remained in the principality of Aquitaine after the death of Chandos in 1369 and, as seneschal of Saintonge and captain of Soubise, played a prominent part in the unsuccessful attempts to defend English possessions there during the early 1370s. After his commands in Aquitaine were overrun he retired to England and was soon regularly employed as a trusted military contractor by the crown: between March and July 1375 he patrolled the channel with a company of eighty men; in August 1376 he was sent with reinforcements for the garrisons of Brest and St Malo; and in 1378 he commanded a company of fifty men going to strengthen the Anglo-Navarrese force holding Cherbourg. Farrington served throughout the earl of Buckingham's campaign in Brittany in 1380&#150;81 and then played an active role in advancing the case for full-scale English intervention in Flanders. He was chosen as one of the four principal commanders of the army gathered by Henry Despenser, bishop of Norwich, in order to implement this policy and acted as marshal of Despenser's host. Following the failure of the expedition, however, Despenser and his captains had to answer for their conduct before parliament in October 1383. Farrington's admission that he had accepted money from the French for the surrender of Gravelines particularly incensed the Commons and he, alone of Despenser's captains, was found guilty of the more serious charge of treasonous misconduct and imprisoned to await the king's pleasure.<br>
<br>This set-back proved no more than temporary, but it marks a point of transition in Farrington's career, from active campaigning to military administration. Released from prison by December 1385, Farrington was clearly back in royal favour by January 1387, when he was sent on a mission to the court of Jo&atilde;o I, king of Portugal. Further diplomatic employment followed: Farrington was a member of the embassy dispatched to Rome in 1390 in order to protest against the effect of papal provisions, and he was sent to France in July 1392 to witness the prorogation of the existing Anglo-French truce on the king's behalf. Such services recommended him to Richard II, and in August 1394 Farrington was retained for life by the king at a fee of &pound;50 p.a. It was as a king's knight that he subsequently accompanied Richard on his Irish campaigns in 1394&#150;5 and 1399. During these years Sir William's career developed in two further directions. He served on the staff of the Calais garrison, rising to be lieutenant of the captain of Calais by 1399, and he became increasingly involved in the adjudication of disputed cases under the law of arms, hearing appeals from the judgments of the court of chivalry and acting, on occasion, as lieutenant to the marshal of England. The accession of Henry IV, who confirmed Farrington's annuity as a king's knight, made little difference to the range of duties Sir William was required to perform. Early in 1400 he was employed in the ineffective diplomatic exchanges aimed at securing French recognition of the new dynasty; in October 1403 he was entrusted with the responsibility of conveying the wine fleet from Bristol to Bordeaux; and his growing expertise in the law of arms was recognized in August 1409 by a commission granting him the power to exercise all the jurisdiction of the constable of England while overseas. But Farrington's principal responsibility during Henry's reign lay once again in the defence of Aquitaine. As constable of Bordeaux, a post he held between October 1401 and November 1413, and captain of the castle of Fronsac, Sir William played an important role in the administration and defence of the duchy during years of considerable French pressure.<br>
<br>Farrington's tenure of this post was not without controversy, for in November 1402 he was briefly imprisoned in his own castle of Bordeaux by the king's lieutenant in Aquitaine, Edward, duke of York. Such conflicts were a regular feature of his career: before his conviction for treasonable misconduct in 1383, Farrington's determined pursuit of the financial interest he enjoyed in the ransom of the count of Denia had already led to a spell of imprisonment in the Tower of London in 1377, while his tenure at Bordeaux was punctuated by several disputes over the revenues allegedly attached to the office of constable. If these incidents suggest a certain lack of scruple on Farrington's part, his long military experience, his versatility and evident effectiveness meant that he was never short of patrons and employers. In addition to his duties to the crown, Farrington was, at various times, in the service of Henry Percy, earl of Northumberland, Thomas (I) Mowbray, duke of Norfolk, and John Holland, duke of Exeter. His most enduring connection was, however, with William Montagu, earl of Salisbury. Montagu granted Farrington an annuity of &pound;40 in 1388 and later demised to him a life interest in the manor and advowson of Aston Clinton, Buckinghamshire. Farrington was named as both an executor and surveyor of the earl's will.<br>
<br>In his own will, drawn up at Swavesey, Cambridgeshire, in April 1416, Farrington requested burial in the London Charterhouse and named Roger Westwode, second baron of the exchequer, as his principal executor; the will was proved in February 1417. Nothing is known of Farrington's wife except her name, Joan; they were married by July 1407 and appear to have had no surviving children.<br>
