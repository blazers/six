<span class="headword">Randolph,  John</span>, third earl of Moray  (<em>d.</em> 1346), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23121/', "Thomas Randolph, first earl of Moray")</script>. The identity of his mother is not certain, but she may have been Isabella Stewart, a daughter of Sir John Stewart of Bonkill&#151;in 1329 John Stewart's grandson, also John, was described as Thomas Randolph's nephew. John Randolph's elder brother, another <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54305/', "Thomas Randolph")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23121/', "Randolph, Thomas, first earl of Moray")</script>], became second earl of Moray on the death of their father on 20 July 1332, but died at the battle of Dupplin Moor on 11 August that year. Succeeding his brother in the earldom, and also in the lordships of Annandale and Man, Moray immediately assumed an active military role in the conflict between the supporters of David II and those of Edward Balliol, the English-backed claimant to the Scottish crown. Moray played a leading part in a successful attack by Bruce partisans on Balliol at Annan in December 1332, which forced Balliol to flee the kingdom. On 19 July 1333 Moray was present at the disastrous defeat of pro-David II forces at the battle of Halidon Hill near Berwick, but managed to escape death or capture. The defeat, and the military ascendancy achieved in its aftermath by Balliol and Edward III, caused David's followers to reconsider the position of their young king. Some time in the winter of 1333&#150;4 Moray seems to have been entrusted with a mission to the French court to arrange for David's transfer there from his bolt-hole in Dumbarton Castle. He returned to Scotland in the spring of 1334 with ships and money from the French king to pay for the expenses involved in moving David II from Dumbarton, which was safely effected in May 1334.<br>
<br>On Moray's return he and Robert the Steward, David II's nephew and heir apparent, co-operated in attacks on Balliol supporters in Clydesdale, and by July 1334 they had become joint guardians. Moray's claim to exercise guardianship may have been partly justified by his own blood relationship to David II, for his grandmother was a sister of Robert I. The Steward apparently resented Moray's role as joint guardian, and the legacy of the personal animosity between the two men was to be an important feature of the politics of the kingdom throughout David II's reign.<br>
<br>On 27 September 1334 Moray forced the submission of David Strathbogie, titular earl of Atholl, one of the disinherited who had accompanied Edward Balliol to Scotland in 1332, and who had since been occupying Moray's own lordships of Lochaber and Badenoch. In April 1335 Strathbogie and Moray had a further falling out at a parliament held by the guardians at Dairsie in Fife. The Steward seems to have supported Strathbogie's position against Moray's, and an entry in the exchequer rolls indicates that the adherents of the two guardians were soon engaged in a struggle for control of the king's fermes and customs revenues from the burghs north of the Forth.<br>
<br>In July 1335 Edward III and Edward Balliol launched a renewed assault on David II's supporters in Scotland and swiftly established their campaign headquarters in Perth. In August Moray defeated a force under the command of Gui, count of Namur, who was bringing his troops to the assistance of Edward III, in a series of running battles in and around Edinburgh. Gui and his men surrendered to Moray, who agreed to free the count under the condition that he took no further active part in Edward III's campaign. While escorting Gui to the English border, Moray was himself surprised and captured by a force from the English border garrisons. By 13 August 1335 he was recorded as being a prisoner at York, and he was subsequently held in a number of English gaols, including Nottingham Castle, Windsor, Winchester, and the Tower of London. He remained a prisoner until February 1342, when he was ransomed by Edward III in exchange for William Montagu, earl of Salisbury, who had been captured by the French early in 1340.<br>
<br>In June 1341, not long before Moray's release, David II had returned to Scotland from France. The earl's close political relationship with the young king was immediately restored, and David is reputed to have served under his command in a raid on northern England about 1342 (the precise date of this expedition is difficult to determine). Moray's interest and prominence in Anglo-Scottish warfare rested partly on his status as lord of Annandale. The chief castle of the lordship, Lochmaben, was garrisoned by English forces, and much of Annandale remained subject to the authority of agents of the English crown. In domestic politics, the affinities and allies of Moray and the Steward continued their rivalry from the 1330s. In 1342 Sir Alexander Ramsay, an active figure in Anglo-Scottish warfare and an associate of Moray, was appointed sheriff of Teviotdale by David II. The previous holder of the office, one of Ramsay's local rivals, Sir William Douglas of Liddesdale, promptly seized Ramsay and allowed him to die in his custody. Douglas was saved from the king's revenge by the Steward, although the incident provoked a long and bitter feud between the followers of Douglas and Moray. The latter still played an important role in border warfare and accompanied the king during his invasion of northern England in October 1346. On 17 October Moray was killed while commanding one of the three Scottish divisions at the battle of Nevilles Cross near Durham.<br>
<br>Randolph married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54314/', "Euphemia (d. 1388/9)")</script>, daughter of Hugh Ross, fourth earl of Ross, but the marriage seems to have produced no children. On 2 May 1355 Euphemia, as countess of Moray, received a dispensation to marry Robert the Steward (the future Robert II). Although the earldom of Moray had been granted to John's father in a male entail, after 1346 the husband of John's sister Agnes, Patrick, earl of Dunbar, assumed the title of earl of Moray. David II reclaimed the earldom for the crown in 1367&#150;8; in 1372, however, David's successor, Robert II, granted the comital title to John Dunbar, the son of Sir Patrick Dunbar and John Randolph's younger sister Isabella. Title to the lordships of Annandale and Man passed to John Dunbar's elder brother, George, earl of March.<br>
