<span class="headword">Bolton, Sir  George Lewis French</span>  (1900&#150;1982), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 16 October 1900 at 1 Lawley Street, Lower Clapton, Hackney, east London, the son of William George Lewis Bolton, a shipping clerk, and his wife, Beatrice Louise, <i>n&eacute;e</i> French. He was educated at Leyton county high school before joining the London branch of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de Paris at the age of sixteen to be trained as an exchange dealer. He can be regarded as a leading influence behind the rebirth of London as the world's leading international financial centre from the 1950s.<br>
<br>Bolton's successful career as an exchange dealer was well-suited to his intellectually agile and highly individualistic character. After working with Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale he was employed by the merchant bank Helbert Wagg in 1920, where he remained for twelve years, developing an extensive foreign exchange business. This expertise brought him to the attention of the governor of the Bank of England, Montagu Norman. Following the pound's dramatic departure from the gold standard in 1931, the Bank of England had become involved in the management of the sterling exchange rate. Bolton joined the Bank of England in 1933, became deputy principal of the foreign exchange section in 1934, and served as principal between 1936 and 1941.<br>
<br>At the Bank of England, Bolton exercised a considerable influence on international monetary policy. During the late 1930s he undertook secret preparations for a structure of wartime exchange control plans, which were duly implemented following the outbreak of war. He was appointed adviser to the Bank of England on exchange and monetary policy in 1941, and following his appointment as external director of the bank in March 1948, Bolton exercised a personal ascendancy on most questions of external financial policy. Few officials could challenge his forceful and powerful arguments, even though they were sometimes erratic.<br>
<br>The problems of sterling, undermined by Britain's deteriorating economy, were a central concern. In a speech in 1956 Bolton predicted that the loss of international confidence in sterling would lead to &#145;a collapse of civilisation as we know it over a very large area of the world&#146;  (Fry, 43), but his solutions to the difficulties which beset the British currency in the post-war world were idiosyncratic. He was one of the chief proponents of a radical scheme (codenamed Robot) in 1952 for a floating rate of exchange for sterling and for the full convertibility of the currency subject to the funding of 80 per cent of the sterling balances held by non-dollar countries. After a bitter controversy, the ROBOT scheme was finally rejected by the prime minister, Winston Churchill. In retrospect, it is widely believed that if the scheme had been adopted it would have had politically and economically disastrous consequences for Britain.<br>
<br>In 1957 Bolton was persuaded to become chairman of the Bank of London and South America (Bolsa), the descendant of more than half a dozen British overseas banks which had established branches in Latin America in the nineteenth century. In the 1950s the bank's prospects did not look good in the face of growing economic nationalism, while its management lacked vigour, a situation which its main shareholder since the inter-war years, Lloyds Bank, showed little interest in improving.<br>
<br>Bolton's period as chairman of Bolsa between 1957 and 1970 was of major significance both for the bank and for London's financial community more generally. Bolton had finally become convinced that sterling's role as a world reserve currency was doomed, but he firmly believed that the City of London could none the less be reborn as a dynamic financial centre. He argued that the key to this rebirth was the removal of tight government restrictions, and the existence of a liberal regulatory framework which would enable London to flourish as a financial entrep&ocirc;t. He was one of the first to see the potential of London as a location for new global financial markets. On appointment as chairman of Bolsa he set up a foreign exchange department, with the dealers instructed to look for deposits in foreign currencies. Bolsa thereby became one of the first movers in the new eurodollar markets, whose location in London was to provide such a major impetus behind the City's renewal.<br>
<br>During the 1960s Bolton was extensively engaged in a series of schemes to reorganize Britain's overseas banking interests. In 1965 Mellon National Bank acquired a 15 per cent shareholding in Bolsa. Subsequently Bolton sought to build on the Mellon connection by uniting all the overseas banking operations of Lloyds and Barclays to create a global Anglo-American multinational bank which would have had branches spanning Latin America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. However it never proved possible to secure such a fusion in the face of vested interests.<br>
<br>Bolton's vision of an Anglo-American multinational bank reflected his attachment to the United States. He was disconcerted by, and distrustful of, the European Common Market, formed in 1958. He strongly opposed British membership, fearing that the Common Market would lead to a political union with a written constitution and a common currency and legal system, which he considered would be intolerable for Britain. In place of ties with continental Europe, Bolton favoured the formation of a north Atlantic free trade association including Britain, the United States, and Canada.<br>
<br>During the 1970s Bolton pursued a wide range of international business and other interests. In 1973 he became deputy chairman of Lonrho, the controversial British conglomerate active in Africa, and he served as chairman of the Commonwealth Development Finance Company (1968&#150;80) and Premier Consolidated Oilfields (1974&#150;6). He was chairman of the influential Bolton inquiry in 1971 on the financial problems facing small firms. In addition, he served as sheriff of London in 1952 and 1961, governor of the London School of Economics from 1961, and was a member of the council of Benenden Girls' School in Kent.<br>
<br>Bolton had an impressive physical appearance. He was well over 6 feet tall, had reddish hair, light blue eyes, a cheerful countenance, and a deep and seductive voice. Combined with his imagination, ebullience, and conviction, it was not surprising that his ideas often carried the day. He was a man of strong principles, which he pursued stubbornly and with candour, qualities which made him enemies as well as friends.<br>
<br>Bolton married, on 3 March 1928, in Bayswater, London, May, daughter of Charles Colley Howcroft, a designer; with her he had one son and two daughters. He was created KCMG in 1950, and received decorations from Argentina in 1960 and Chile in 1965. He died on 2 September 1982, at 61 St George's Square, Westminster, survived by his wife.<br>
