<span class="headword">Dolman,  Charles</span>  (1807&#150;1863), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic publisher</span>, was born at Monmouth on 20 September 1807. He was the only son of Charles Dolman, a surgeon, and his wife, Mary Frances, daughter of Thomas Booker, a Roman Catholic publisher in London. Dolman's father died in the year of his birth, leaving his son and his two daughters to be brought up by their mother, who remarried in 1818. Dolman was educated at Downside School, near Bath, from 1817 to 1821. Subsequently he studied architecture at Preston in Lancashire. Probably in the mid-1830s his mother's family, the Bookers, invited him to join their publishing establishment at 61 Bond Street, London. After the death of his uncle Joseph Booker in 1837, Dolman carried on the business with his aunt, Miss Mary Booker, and his cousin Thomas. On Mary Booker's death in 1840, Dolman and Thomas Booker went into partnership; soon after, the business became entirely Dolman's. On 12 January 1841 he married Frances, the daughter of James and Apollonia Coverdale of Ingatestone Hall in Essex; they had one son, Charles Vincent Dolman, later canon of Newport.<br>
<br>Dolman's early publishing career was dominated by his interest in the publication of Roman Catholic periodicals. From 1838 to 1844 he was the publisher of the <span class="italic">Dublin Review</span>, a quarterly journal founded by Nicholas Wiseman, M. J. Quinn, and Daniel O'Connell. The commencement of this publication was marked by financial problems and editorial disputes. Wiseman felt that Dolman wanted too much say in the management of the <span class="italic">Review</span>; Dolman was also criticized as inefficient, and accused of failing to advertise the <span class="italic">Review</span> properly. But Roman Catholic publishers generally had less capital and fewer trade openings than their protestant counterparts, difficulties Dolman's critics failed to appreciate. It soon became necessary to guarantee Dolman against losses of up to &pound;400, and in 1844 arguments over the management of the journal led to Dolman's departure.<br>
<br>From April 1838 Dolman had been the publisher of the <span class="italic">Catholic Magazine</span>, a periodical of a more apologetic nature than the <span class="italic">Review</span>. The <span class="italic">Magazine</span> aimed to promote fellow feeling between Catholic and protestant, and to make the Roman Catholic faith attractive to a wider audience. After the <span class="italic">Magazine</span> folded in 1844, Dolman continued this tradition with his own <span class="italic">Dolman's Magazine and Monthly Miscellany of Criticism</span>. Established in July 1845, it aimed to be &#145;all things to all men&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dolman's Magazine</span>, April 1846, 318). Like its predecessor it avoided dealing with the controversial issues of Irish politics. It quarrelled with both the <span class="italic">Dublin Review</span> and <span class="italic">The Tablet</span> over Frederick Faber's first volume in the series <span class="roman">Lives of the Modern Saints</span>, his admiring account of the masochistic excesses of Rosa of Lima. In August 1849 <span class="italic">Dolman's Magazine</span> was united with Thomas Booker's <span class="italic">Catholic Weekly</span> to form the <span class="italic">Weekly Register</span>. After 1850 Dolman ceased to have any connection with it.<br>
<br>From the late 1840s Dolman turned his attention away from journals, though he later engaged in one further publication of this kind: from January 1856 to December 1862, he published <span class="italic">The Lamp</span>, a Roman Catholic journal intended for the edification of the lower classes. He concentrated instead on the publication of de luxe editions of Catholic classics, such as Kenelm Digby's <span class="italic">Broadstone of Honour</span>. The most significant of these productions was the fifth edition of John Lingard's <span class="italic">The History of England</span>, published in 1850 with the author's corrections. The historian's opinion of his publisher shows that Dolman's disputes with the <span class="italic">Dublin Review</span> personnel should not be permitted to obscure the strength of his commitment to the defence and propagation of his religion: Lingard, with his lingering cisalpine sympathies, found Dolman &#145;too fond of puffing&#146;  (Lingard to E. Price, Feb 1848) and refused to write a combative preface to the edition, indicating the errors of Macaulay's <span class="italic">History</span>. The cost of Dolman's special editions exhausted his capital; in 1858 he tried to form his business into a limited liability company called the Catholic Bookselling and Publishing Company. However, the company failed, and, probably in 1862, he went to live in Paris, where he established a small business at 64 rue du Faubourg St Honor&eacute;. He died there on 31 December 1863; his wife survived him, dying on 2 March 1885 at Erith.<br>
