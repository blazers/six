<span class="headword">Hargreaves,  Alison Jane</span>  (1962&#150;1995), <span class="occ">mountaineer</span>, was born on 17 February 1962 at 67 Brisbane Road, Mickleover, Derbyshire, the younger daughter and second of three children of John Edward Hargreaves, a senior scientific officer at British Rail, and his wife, Joyce Winifred, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Carlile, a teacher. Her family moved to Belper, Derbyshire, in 1971, and often went hillwalking. She began rock climbing with school groups in 1975, and soon led &#145;very severe&#146; climbs. She broke her leg when another climber knocked her off a cliff in 1977, and the following year she began part-time work at an outdoors shop in Matlock Bath. On her eighteenth birthday she left home and moved to Meerbrook Lea, Whatstandwell, outside Matlock Bath, to live with James Herbert Ballard, son of Albert Ballard, a naval ordnance inspector. Jim Ballard, an extroverted Yorkshireman sixteen years her senior, had recently separated from his wife, Jean, and owned the outdoors store where Hargreaves worked. Hargreaves had previously applied to study geography at universities near climbing centres, but then scored too low on her A-levels to gain admission. She began producing climbing equipment for her own label and making rock climbs of increasing difficulty, both of which led to a modest reputation among the climbing <i>cognoscenti</i>.<br>
<br>After attending a &#145;meet&#146; for women climbers in 1982 Hargreaves began to consider herself a professional mountaineer. In 1986 she went to the Himalayas with Bill O'Connor to attempt Ama Dablam, and appeared in <span class="italic">Games Climbers Play</span>, a film. She joined an American expedition led by Jeff Lowe in 1987, when she and Mark Twight ascended a new route on the north-west face of Kantega (22,240 ft). Spending most of her time at home, however, she was isolated from the mainstream climbing community and suffered from low self-esteem. She also lacked the distinctive profile of other contemporary women climbers, such as the feminism of Jill Lawrence or the <i>savoir-faire</i> of Catherine Destivelle. She first attracted public attention by combining mountaineering and motherhood. After deciding to have children, she married Ballard at the register office in Belper on 23 April 1988. His divorce had been made final only months previously. Hargreaves (who retained her maiden name) then climbed the north face of the Eiger while five-and-a-half months pregnant. Although her ascent was the first by a British woman, it was her pregnancy that made it newsworthy. She told the ITV television programme &#145;Women of Today&#146; (27 July 1989) that her &#145;bump&#146; made it difficult to tie her boots at a bivouac; she confided to her diary that she felt the foetus kicking before and during the climb. She gave birth to a son, Tom, in October 1988, and a daughter, Kate, in March 1991. During this period she spent less time climbing in order to concentrate on raising the children.<br>
<br>Ballard's outdoors business had been struggling financially for years, and when it went bankrupt in 1993 their home was repossessed. They fled creditors and moved to the Alps to pursue a multi-year plan for Hargreaves to make solo climbs of north faces in the Alps and a solo ascent of Everest. Their only income was Hargreaves's &pound;600 a month sponsorship from an outdoor clothing manufacturer. Ballard and the children camped at the foot of each peak while Hargreaves became the first person to climb solo, in a single season, six classic north faces: Grandes Jorasses, Matterhorn, Eiger, Piz Badile, Petit Dru, and Cima Grande di Lavaredo. In her book, <span class="italic">A Hard Day's Summer</span> (1994), she claimed that the elapsed time climbing these faces was just twenty-four hours. Climbing snobs sneered that her achievements were exaggerated by taking easy routes on the Eiger and the Grandes Jorasses. To answer her critics, she became the first woman to climb solo the formidable Croz Spur of the Grandes Jorasses, in November 1993.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1994 Hargreaves attempted to climb Everest &#145;alone&#146; in affiliation with a British medical expedition while her family stayed at base camp in Nepal. She turned back at 27,600 ft to prevent frostbite. In 1993 Rebecca Stephens, a journalist, had become the first British woman to climb Everest, receiving the lucrative endorsements that still eluded Hargreaves. Hargreaves replaced Ballard as her agent with Richard Allen, a retired executive, and developed an ambitious new plan to climb the world's three highest peaks&#151;Everest, K2, and Kanchenjunga&#151;all in one year. In 1995 she returned to Everest without her family to attempt the north-eastern ridge from Tibet unsupported by porters and without supplemental oxygen. On 13 May she reached the summit and radioed a message to her children: &#145;To Tom and Kate, I am on the highest point in the world and I love you dearly&#146;  (BBC, 9 Feb 1996). After Everest she spent two weeks at home in the media spotlight, escaping only for a few days with the children, and bought a new home in the Great Glen beneath Ben Nevis in Scotland. A book contract paid off her debts and covered the cost of her next expedition, to K2.<br>
<br>After several unsuccessful attempts on K2 in July 1995 Hargreaves was minutes away from returning home when she resolved to try again. During a brief period of calm weather she reached the summit of K2 on 13 August; on the descent, a savage storm killed her and six other climbers, among them Americans, Spaniards, and a New Zealander. When their deaths were reported several days later, Ballard suggested to their children, then aged six and four, that they visit &#145;mum's last mountain&#146;. Their arduous trip to K2 in the autumn of 1995 resulted in a BBC television programme, &#145;Inside Story: Alison's Last Mountain&#146; (9 Feb 1996), and Ballard's book, <span class="italic">One and Two Halves to K2</span> (1996). Commentators debated whether the voyeuristic scenes of her grief-stricken children in bereavement counselling on the K2 trek were ghoulish or moving. A wider debate in the press centred on whether a mother should climb. Some considered Hargreaves self-centred or foolhardy for leaving her children for Everest and K2, while others noted that male climbers who died and were fathers were not subject to the same criticism. Her personal motives were at least as complex as the commentary. A biography by David Rose and Ed Douglas, based on extensive interviews and diaries she started in 1973, reported that her relationship with Ballard had been tempestuous and at times violent. She often considered leaving him, but was frequently indecisive: she even died intestate. She told friends and relatives that she planned to divorce Ballard but feared that courts would not give her custody of her children if she continued to climb. Since climbing was her only means of support, she could not stop until she attained financial security. She believed the ascent of Everest and K2 would provide this, and her diaries record the anguished conflict between her desire to be with the children and her obsession with climbing K2.<br>
<br>Hargreaves was petite, standing 5 feet 4 inches tall, with a wide, round face, wavy, dark blonde hair, and a warm smile. Friends admired her terpsichorean grace on rock, her stamina and organizational skill at high altitudes, and her devotion to her children. Tom and Kate built small memorial cairns in sight of K2, and the government of Pakistan erected a plaque in her honour in the Skardu valley. A memorial service was held at Belper in November 1995. She was posthumously awarded a doctorate by the University of Derby in 1996.<br>
