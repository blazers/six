<span class="headword">Ternan</span> <span class="st"> [St Ternan]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>6th&#150;7th cent.), <span class="occ">holy man</span>, was an obscure saint venerated mainly in north-east Scotland. His feast day, 12 June, is the same as that of the (equally obscure) Irish St Torann&aacute;n. The two may well be identical, since the Irish martyrologies describe him as living &#145;across the sea&#146;, linking him with <i>Alba</i>, Scotland, and specifically with Banchory-Ternan, while at least one Scottish source calls Ternan &#145;archbishop of Ireland&#146;. His dedications are mostly in Mearns (Kincardineshire) and Aberdeenshire, notably at Arbuthnott, Slains, and Banchory-Ternan, but with a scattering in the Western Isles as well. His bell and some corporeal relics were preserved at Banchory-Ternan until the Reformation.<br>
<br>The main source for legends concerning Ternan is the early sixteenth-century <span class="italic">Breviarium Aberdonense</span>. The lessons for his feast day locate his birthplace in Mearns (perhaps at Arbuthnott), and associate him with St Palladius (patron of Fordoun, a few miles west of Arbuthnott) and St Machar of Aberdeen. They also connect him with an otherwise unknown king or nobleman called Convecturius (perhaps from Gaelic <i>coinmedoir</i>, collector of tribute), a heathen whom he allegedly converted. Ternan's baptism by St Palladius (<i>fl</i>. 431) is told in the lessons for the latter's feast day, and is also mentioned by the chronicler John Fordun. However, he is also said to have studied under Pope Gregory the Great (<i>r</i>. 590&#150;604), to have been ordained by him, and then to have brought back to Scotland a bell given to him by the pope; this was the bell preserved at Banchory-Ternan. A fragmentary foundation legend of Laurencekirk (also in Mearns), preserved in a late eleventh-century Canterbury source, calls St Ternan <i>archipontifex Hiberniae</i>, knows that he is said to have resuscitated three dead men, and describes how he had a disputation with Archbishop Laurence, Augustine's successor at Canterbury, on the paschal question at or near Fordoun, in which he accepted Laurence's arguments.<br>
<br>None of this helps to establish Ternan as a historical figure separate from the Irish Torann&aacute;n; he is probably a legendary transposition of the latter, introduced into eastern Scotland after the Gaelic conquest of the Picts in the ninth century. His cult became important and popular, causing him to be associated with other saints with dedications in the same area.<br>
