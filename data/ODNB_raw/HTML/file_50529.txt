<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clover,  Joseph Thomas</span>  (1825&#150;1882), <span class="occ">anaesthetist and surgeon</span>, was born on 28 February 1825 at home, over his father's shop, at 6 Market Place, Aylsham, Norfolk, the third of the five children of John Wright Clover (1780&#150;1865), draper, and his second wife, Elizabeth Mary Anne Peterson (1791&#150;1883), property owner. He was educated at Grey Friars' Priory School, Norwich, and at the age of sixteen he was apprenticed to a local surgeon, Charles Mends Gibson, and enrolled as a dresser at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital. His apprenticeship was interrupted by ill health, almost certainly tuberculosis. In 1844 he proceeded to University College Hospital, London, where his fellow students included Joseph Lister and Henry Thompson. His claim, made many years later, that he was present on 21 December 1846 when Robert Liston amputated a leg under the first general anaesthetic to be given in England, though not supported by his diary, was confirmed by the fellow student who gave the ether, William Squire.<br>
<br>Clover qualified MRCS, LSA, in 1847, and in 1848 he was appointed to the onerous post of apothecary, renamed resident medical officer in 1851, at University College Hospital. Here he operated, administered anaesthetics by a method of his own devising, and taught students. He attained the fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons on 11 April 1850. In 1853 he entered private practice and moved with his parents to 44 Mortimer Street, renamed 3 Cavendish Place in 1860, where he lived for the rest of his life. Here, in his own workshop, he made the prototypes of his many inventions, most of which were produced commercially by Mayer and Meltzer and Coxeter &amp; Sons. Clover had become a skilled lithotritist, and went on to design improved blades and to invent a bladder syringe to facilitate the removal of the crushed fragments of stone. He also designed the Clover crutch, to hold the patient in the lithotomy position, and a gas cautery. But the greater part of his professional life was spent as an anaesthetist.<br>
<br>Appreciating the importance of knowing, and having control over, the concentration of chloroform vapour being inhaled by the patient, about 1860 Clover set about designing an inhaler free from the problems caused by cooling or breath-holding that were inherent in all contemporary vaporizers. The result was a more practical application of an idea first tested by John Snow, who had occasionally acted as anaesthetist for Clover. It consisted of a very large reservoir bag that was filled with a known concentration of vapour before the start of the operation. This established a safe maximum, which could be diluted by admitting air at the facepiece. The contents of such a bag would have lasted some fifteen minutes. By hanging this cumbrous device on his back to keep it out of the way of the surgeon, Clover initiated the fashion that required the well-turned-out Victorian anaesthetist to appear with pieces of apparatus suspended about his person. He exhibited the inhaler at the International Exhibition of 1862, and the official report described it as &#145;undoubtedly, the safest instrument which has yet been devised for the administration of chloroform, [which] would surely be generally adopted if it could be rendered a little less cumbersome. It is, however, admirably suited for hospital use &#146;  (Traer, 148&#150;9). The administration of chloroform by this apparatus became the approved method at St Mary's Hospital, the Great Northern, Guy's, and the Westminster. The quest for latent heat of vaporization continued throughout Clover's life. It resulted in his counter-current inhaler, and in vaporizers designed to be worn in the anaesthetist's axilla, and on the top of his head; this latter was rejected because of the discomfort caused by pressure on the scalp.<br>
<br>In 1863 the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society, disturbed by the number of chloroform deaths, set up a committee of inquiry. No practising anaesthetist was included among its members, but Clover, who was a fellow of the society, played a great part in its experimental investigations, which were carried out in the physiology laboratory of University College. It was widely thought that he drafted its report and was largely responsible for its recommendations  (&#145;Report of the committee appointed &hellip; to inquire into &hellip; chloroform&#146;, <span class="italic">Medico-Chirurgical Transactions</span>, 47, 1864, 323&#150;442). The investigation confirmed that 5 per cent chloroform vapour was the safe upper limit, and showed conclusively that when strong mixtures were inhaled the pulse became impalpable well before the heart ceased to beat. From this came the recommendation that the pulse should be monitored continuously. The photograph of Clover demonstrating the use of his chloroform bag shows him with a finger ostentatiously on the pulse, and he was always critical of any apparatus that did not allow the anaesthetist to keep one hand free for this purpose.<br>
<br>Clover's principal appointments were at University College, London, where he was lecturer on anaesthetics, and at the Dental Hospital. In October 1864 he was offered an attachment at the Westminster, but this, and his sessions at Guy's, lasted less than three years. Much of his private work was in dental anaesthetics. He was a very active member of the Odontological Society of Great Britain, to which several of his more important papers were read. Until the process of antisepsis allowed the body to be subjected to more extensive surgical interventions, it was in anaesthesia for dentistry that the advances were being made. Clover was much in demand by dentists. Unlike deaths in the anonymity of the hospital, a death in the dental chair was a death in the community, and dentists contrasted the pleasure of operating with Mr Clover, when they had not the slightest passing uneasiness, with their anxiety when the patient's own doctor volunteered to give the chloroform, when, as they said, they were often frightened out of their wits. Clover, with a few quiet words of explanation, was able to gain the confidence of the most nervous patient, and of the dentist too.<br>
<br>Clover prepared the official report when the use of nitrous oxide (&#145;laughing gas&#146;) was demonstrated at the Dental Hospital by T. W. Evans in 1868  (J. T. Clover, &#145;Anaesthesia in dentistry by protoxide of nitrogen&#146;, <span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 4 April 1868, 337&#150;8). He immediately recognized its advantages for dental anaesthesia and rapidly adapted his own apparatus for its use. But the apparatus for which Clover is best known is his portable regulating ether-inhaler, the subject of several modifications, and illustrated in every textbook of anaesthetics for the next fifty years  (J. T. Clover, &#145;Portable regulating ether-inhaler&#146;, <span class="italic">BMJ</span>, Jan 20 1877, 69&#150;70). Its portability made it very popular with the peripatetic jobbing anaesthetists of the period. Oddly, it was the one he least liked to use himself.<br>
<br>Clover kept a careful record of his cases. His continual search for safety led him to try, and to reject, other anaesthetic agents. Realizing that some deaths were caused by the inhalation of vomit, he campaigned against the surgical practice of dosing the patient with alcoholic stimulants before operation. He insisted that the patient fast for six hours before the anaesthetic, and preferred to anaesthetize before breakfast or at two o'clock in the afternoon.<br>
<br>Clover's other contributions to the instrumentation of the speciality were a nosepiece for dental anaesthetics, a spring-loaded dental prop, an oral airway, a device for the rapid performance of laryngotomy, and &#145;funnel-shaped india-rubber tubes for conveying the anaesthetic to the back of the mouth during operations on the jaw&#146;. These, together with a plenum vaporizer supplied by a foot-operated bellows, and a &#145;down-draught dilutor&#146;, which he was still developing at the time of his death, were shown at the 1881 congress  (J. T. Clover, &#145;On apparatus for giving anaesthetics with precision&#146;, <span class="italic">Transactions of the International Congress of Medicine</span>, 1881, 2.390&#150;92).<br>
<br>Clover worked with the leading surgeons of the day, and often with the urologist Sir Henry Thompson; among their patients was the deposed Napoleon III of France. Clover also anaesthetized Alexandra, princess of Wales, Princess Beatrice, Florence Nightingale, and Sir Erasmus Wilson. He enjoyed a rich social life, and made many friends. Among them were Tennyson, the Terrys, Holman Hunt, Burne-Jones, Ruskin, Coventry Patmore, Carl Rosa, and Brunel. He very likely participated in Sir Henry Thompson's celebrated dinner parties for eight, the &#145;octaves&#146;. In 1869 he married Mary Anne Hall (1839&#150;1929), artist and musician. Of their five children, three sons and a daughter survived to adult life.<br>
<br>Clover was indisputably the leading British anaesthetist of his day. He did not publish a textbook, but spread his ideas at meetings, through lectures and the journals, and by example. His well-received articles on anaesthetics, artificial respiration, and resuscitation, in Sir Richard Quain's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Medicine</span> (1882), appeared posthumously.<br>
<br>Clover died at 3 Cavendish Place, Cavendish Square, on 27 September 1882, of the tuberculosis that had troubled him for most of his life. Many tributes were paid to his professional and personal attributes. He is depicted as the supporter on the sinister side of the coat of arms of the Royal College of Anaesthetists, and a biennial Clover lecture is delivered in his memory. He was buried on 30 September in the Brompton cemetery in London.<br>
