<span class="headword">Lacy <span class="st"> [ de Lacy]</span>,  Maurice</span>  (1740&#150;1820), <span class="occ">army officer in Russia</span>, was born during the great frost of 1739&#150;40 in co. Limerick, one of two sons and four daughters of Patrick de Lacy (<i>d</i>. 1790) of Rathcahill and Templeglentan and his wife, Lady Mary Herbert (<i>d</i>. 1795). The de Lacys, an extensive and prominent Catholic family of Anglo-Norman ancestry, had suffered heavily in the Irish defeats of the seventeenth century. Nothing is known of Lacy's early life. His kinsmen included some of the leading immigrant Irish Catholic soldiers in Russia and the Habsburg empire and, as a young man, he took advantage of these connections to leave Ireland and enter the Russian service. He fought against the Turks and achieved general's rank. In 1792&#150;3 he revisited Ireland. In 1799 he participated with Prince Suvorov in the defeat of the French in the north of Italy.<br>
<br>In 1805 Lacy was sent to Naples to command an Anglo-Russian force against the French. Ostensibly intended to bolster the Bourbon kingdom's resistance to Napoleon, the real objective was to divert French resources from the north. After Lacy's preliminary reconnaissance in May a treaty of alliance between Russia and Naples was signed in September, and towards the end of November 11,000 Russian troops from Corfu and 6000 British from Malta, under Sir James Craig, disembarked in the Bay of Naples. Lacy had landed infirm after a rough voyage and was brought from the coast in a litter to comfortable quarters at the Angri palace, where his expenses were defrayed by King Ferdinand. Sir Henry Bunbury, the British quartermaster-general, alleged that Lacy lacked talent or knowledge but considered him a simple, kind-hearted old gentleman who, in his own words, was &#145;always for fighting&#146;  (Bunbury, 191). Although it was stated that he best expressed himself in Russian, he also had a knowledge of French and, of course, English, which he spoke with an Irish accent. He was known to don his nightcap during councils of war and sleep, leaving discussion to others. King Ferdinand, who had less faith in his Russian allies than Queen Caroline, thought him a comical figure when he appeared in full uniform at an audience at Portici and boasted that his sword would not return to its sheath until the king's enemies had been vanquished.<br>
<br>Having made Teano his headquarters Lacy deployed his forces in a defensive position on the north-west border, posting the British along the River Garigliano, the Russians to cover the narrow Mignano Pass, and the Neapolitans on the Abruzzi frontier. Napoleon's victory at Austerlitz in December and his subsequent armistice with the tsar removed the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of the Russian military presence in Naples. When news came that a French army under Mass&eacute;na, accompanied by Napoleon's brother Joseph, was preparing to invade the kingdom Lacy first spoke of retiring to Calabria but instead, as ordered by the tsar, in mid-January 1806 he evacuated his force from Baia and returned to Corfu. This was a bitter disappointment to the Neapolitans, who were left defenceless against the advancing French, the British having departed. In 1807 Napoleon, with the tsar's permission, wrote to Lacy from Tilsit, suggesting that he organize an Irish force against England but nothing came of this. Lacy played no prominent part in subsequent campaigns and took up the post of governor of Grodno, in Belorussia, where he possessed estates. He died there, unmarried, in January 1820, &#145;the last male descendent, direct, of the great Hugh de Lacy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sketch Pedigree</span>), leaving an estate valued at &pound;100,000.<br>
