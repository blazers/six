<span class="headword">Maule,  Harry</span>, styled fifth earl of Panmure  (1659&#150;1734), <span class="occ">Jacobite army officer and scholar</span>, was born on 18 October 1659, the sixth son of George Maule, second earl of Panmure (1619&#150;1671), and his wife, Lady Jean Campbell (1624/5&#150;1703), eldest daughter of John, earl of Loudoun, lord high chancellor of Scotland. His brothers included John, who was born in January 1650 and died young; George, third earl of Panmure (<i>c</i>.1650&#150;1686); and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18367/', "James Maule, fourth earl of Panmure (1658/9&#150;1723)")</script>. Although he does not appear to have had any formal education, his early and extensive travels in England and on the continent developed the keen interest in politics, religion, and scholarship for which he later became famous. In his home county of Forfarshire he acquired the lands of Kelly from his father and his brother James. He also bought additional lands of Arbirlot and Cuthlie from the archbishop of St Andrews so that he was able to obtain a charter for the whole estate of Kelly in 1687. In the tradition of the Maules he was a firm supporter of the Stuart dynasty and, as a consequence, he and his brother James were both fined considerable sums of money when they walked out of the Scottish parliament for refusing to recognize the convention of estates' decision to declare that James VII of Scotland had forfeited his crown (1689). In addition he was fined for refusing to recognize the authority of William and Mary by taking the oath of allegiance. His seat was declared vacant and eventually filled by Francis Mollison in 1694. He was also at this time a commissioner of supply for Forfarshire. On 7 March 1695 he married Mary Fleming (<i>d</i>. 1702), daughter of William, fifth earl of Wigtown; they had five children, three sons (including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64084/', "William Maule")</script>) and two daughters. Following Mary's death he married Anne Lindsay (<i>d</i>. 1729) in 1704. The couple had six children, all of whom died young except <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64085/', "John Maule (1706&#150;1781)")</script>, who was later to become one of the barons of the court of exchequer in Scotland. At the time of the union he was closely allied both personally and politically to his nephew the earl of Mar.<br>
<br>In 1715 Maule came out for the Jacobites at the battle of Sheriffmuir but, perhaps significantly, preferred to ride out with several other gentlemen volunteers rather than join the Forfarshire regiment raised by his brother James. John Sinclair, in his <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Insurrection in Scotland in 1715</span>, quotes Harry Maule as saying &#145;never were men so idly brought in for their lives and fortunes as we were&#146;  (Sinclair, 52). Whatever his private feelings, his involvement in the battle became both personal and heroic when he rescued his wounded brother from the bothy prison close to the battlefield in which he was being held by government troops. This stirring incident is commemorated in the Jacobite ballad on the battle: &#145;With brisk men about / Brave Harry retook / His brother, and laughed at them a' man&#146;. The Maules' involvement in this uprising led to the forfeiture of their titles and lands in Forfarshire and, in the case of the earl, continuous exile on the continent until his death in 1723. Harry was less persecuted by the government and enjoyed more freedom in Scotland during his lifetime, although he was not allowed to purchase the forfeited estates of his family when they were offered for sale by the government (he offered &pound;60,300 but the York Buildings Company &pound;60,400). While living in the Netherlands in 1718 he wrote to Mar expressing his view about his prospects of returning to Scotland: &#145;expecting but little satisfaction in Scotland &hellip; [I] cannot think of the insolent usage I might meet with from the man who has management there, who threatens extirpation and, I am told, regrets that Harry Maule was not forfaulted&#146;  (<span class="italic">Stuart Papers</span>, 7.507).<br>
<br>Only Jacobite sympathizers referred to Maule as the fifth earl of Panmure after the death of his brother. Denied political office he devoted his time to the study of feudal and canon law, and was seen in his old age as a kind of umpire between the different schisms of the Scottish Episcopal church that were developing during this period. His correspondence with James Greenshields, an Episcopalian clergyman of Edinburgh who had been thrown into prison for using the English prayer book, illustrates the depth of his religious knowledge. His scholarship and judgement, as revealed in the many personal, political, and religious letters that have survived, were fully recognized by his contemporaries. While living on the continent Harry and his eldest son, James, carried out extensive research into the history of the Maules, tracing back the family pedigree over 700 years, and in the process accumulated valuable manuscripts relating to the early history of Scotland. In 1874 John Stuart was commissioned by the earl of Dalhousie to edit this collection into two volumes entitled <span class="italic">Registrum de Panmure</span>. This magnificent work, of which only 150 copies were privately printed, is a lasting tribute to Maule's scholarship. A portrait of the author in armour, copied from the original, is reproduced in this work. His principal residence in Scotland was Kelly Castle in Forfarshire, although he also owned property in Edinburgh from 1711 near the Nether Bow. Maule's second wife died on 12 August 1729 and Maule himself died in Edinburgh on 23 June 1734. He was buried in the abbey church, Holyrood, on 25 June, an honour that reflects the high esteem he was eventually accorded.<br>
