<span class="headword">Drake, Sir  James</span>  (1907&#150;1989), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born on 27 July 1907 at 69 Prospect Terrace, Whalley Road, Altham, Burnley, the son of James Drake, a commercial clerk, and his wife, Ellen Hague. He was educated at Accrington grammar school (1918&#150;1924) and at the Victoria University of Manchester (1924&#150;7), where he graduated BSc in civil engineering, with first-class honours. He passed the professional exams of the Institution of Civil Engineers in April 1931, and was accepted as an associate in 1933 and as a full member in 1943. He married Kathleen Shaw (<i>b</i>. 1913/14), daughter of Richard Shaw Crossley, company director, on 6 July 1937; they had two daughters. He served Stockport county borough council (1927&#150;30), then Bootle county borough council (1930&#150;37), where he built a sports stadium and cycle track and an eighteen-hole golf course, and prepared plans for an arterial road 84 feet wide. He then moved on to work for Blackpool county borough council, first as deputy, and from 1938 as chief, engineer and surveyor, and constructed a number of municipal offices, housing estates, libraries, and schools. He designed sea defences costing &pound;950,000, an 18 mile sewerage system with three pumping stations costing &pound;750,000, and a 7 mile ring road and other road improvements costing &pound;670,000. He was also responsible for the construction of Britain's first multi-storey car park, with a bus station below, which anticipated modern multi-modal policy.<br>
<br>In the later 1930s many new road schemes were projected. In 1936 the Institution of Highway Engineers published a plan for 2826 miles of motorways and the first <span class="roman">Trunk Roads Act</span> (1936) brought central government into road building for the first time. Drake had viewed Germany's autobahns in 1937 for the County Surveyors' Society, which published its own plans for 1000 miles of motorway in Britain in the following year. At this time Drake became a persistent, often acerbic, advocate of motorways for access, speed, and safety. From the mid-1950s he was also a prime administrator of contracts in the field when post-war construction of houses and schools, and relief from rearmament for the Korean War, had progressed far enough to release exchequer money for the <span class="roman">Special Roads Act</span> (1949). As county surveyor and bridgemaster of Lancashire (1945&#150;72) Drake devised a road plan for the county, published in 1949, resting on measurement and projection of traffic flows, as the basis of the county's development plan. His document was seminal for the highway strategies of his county for more than thirty years and was the forerunner of national highway planning procedures. His deep Lancastrian knowledge kept the public inquiry to a single hearing, at which the sole objector did not appear. His method was to anticipate obstacles by sequential contracts for advance works: for example, for the lofty Thelwall Viaduct, 4114 feet long, which the M6 would later require.<br>
<br>From 1946 government plans incorporated a new north-south trunk route through Lancashire. So did Drake's plan, which he pressed on government from 1949 to 1955. Work began in 1956 on the Preston bypass with the county as the government's agent. This became the first section of Britain's motorway system, opened to traffic in 1958. His Lancaster bypass followed in 1960, along with the Stretford&#150;Eccles bypass which became part of the M63, including the Barton high-level bridge, 2425 feet long, over the Manchester Ship Canal; and the Warrington&#150;Preston section in 1963. Drake's planning envisaged linking Preston, Liverpool, Manchester, Blackpool, and eventually Hull by the M6, M61, and M62. He was involved in intense discussion in 1962&#150;4 between the Ministry of Transport, the Scottish development department, the Association of County Councils, and the County Surveyors' Society over the local and national economic benefits of motorways.<br>
<br>Detailed studies of the new rigid concrete road pavements built for the Grantham and Newark bypasses convinced Drake of the need to improve upon what the road research laboratory and the Cement and Concrete Association recommended. He headed a technical delegation to Switzerland comprising staff from Alfred McAlpine, Fairclough Construction, and Ribblesdale Cement to study Swiss construction and maintenance techniques and frost-resistance. In 1964&#150;5, as president of the County Surveyors' Society, he took a team of highway engineers to North America, and sent another to Europe, to gather information on motorway specifications, methods, costs, and productivity. A resultant conference of 800 delegates exchanged their findings and led to <span class="italic">Motorways</span>, edited by Drake and others, published in 1968. Drake's research trips led to major changes in the standard Ministry of Transport specification for rigid concrete pavements on motorways and the methods of building them from 1971. Other innovations he had tested and successfully introduced were the use of &#145;Bunter&#146;, a red sandstone from south Lancashire and north-east Cheshire substituted for the usual sand and gravel sub-base, and crushed limestone or &#145;crusher run&#146; to top it. The Lancashire motorways incorporating these features far exceeded their expected design lifetimes. In 1967&#150;8 Drake was seconded to the Ministry of Transport as director of the first road construction unit, for the north-west of England, constructing the M6 through the Lune valley and planning the M53 and M56 in Cheshire. In 1968 he returned to his Lancashire office, adding the duties of chief engineer of the Lancashire sub-unit of his former unit to complete construction of the M61 and part of the M62 and to prepare plans for the M55, the M58, and the M66 before retiring in 1972.<br>
<br>The author of many technical papers, Drake was elected fellow and member of the council of the Institution of Civil Engineers and a fellow and president of the Institution of Highway Engineers. In 1973 he was knighted (having been appointed CBE in 1962) and awarded an honorary DSc degree by Salford University and an honorary fellowship of Manchester Polytechnic. On retiring, he served as a director and later a consultant for the Fairclough construction group. He enjoyed playing golf at Royal Lytham St Anne's, near his home at 11 Clifton Court. Drake died on 1 February 1989 at the Victoria Hospital, Blackpool.<br>
