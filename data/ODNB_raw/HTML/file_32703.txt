<span class="headword">Dalziel family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1840&#150;1905), <span class="occ">wood-engravers</span>, established the firm known as the Dalziel brothers, one of the most important providers of illustrations for books and magazines of the mid-Victorian period. The prime source of information about the firm is given in <span class="italic">The Brothers Dalziel: a Record</span> (1901).<br>
<br>Alexander Dalziel (1781&#150;1832) and his wife, Elizabeth Hills (1785&#150;1853), were the parents of twelve children; seven of their eight sons were artists, four of whom worked in the family firm. Alexander Dalziel &#145;spent a great part of his time in horticultural pursuits, and in middle life took up art as a profession&#146;  (Dalziel and Dalziel, 1), and his talent was inherited by most of the couple's children. William (1805&#150;1873) was a heraldic and decorative painter; Robert (1810&#150;1842) was a portrait painter; Alexander John (1814&#150;1836) worked as a black and white artist; George (1815&#150;1902), Edward (1817&#150;1905), and Thomas (1823&#150;1906) were the core of the London firm; and John (1822&#150;1869) worked for the firm until poor health compelled his retirement in 1868 to Drigg, Cumberland. The youngest son, Davison Octavian (<i>b</i>. 1825), devoted himself to commerce. Of the daughters, Margaret Jane (1819&#150;1894) also worked for the firm. <a name="cosubject_32701"></a><span class="headword">George Dalziel</span>  (1815&#150;1902), <span class="occ">draughtsman and wood-engraver</span>, the founder and leader of the London firm, was born on 1 December 1815, at Wooler, Northumberland, and was educated at Newcastle upon Tyne. He went to London early in 1835 as pupil to the wood-engraver Charles Gray, with whom he remained for four years. He then set up independently, and in 1840 was joined by his brother Edward at 48 Albert Street, Mornington Crescent. Work came to them partly through association with more established wood-engravers. Through Ebenezer Landells, they engraved for the early numbers of <span class="italic">Punch</span> (started in 1841) and the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> (started in 1842), and were thus well placed to participate in the great flowering of the English pictorial press. Their Tyneside origins led them to engrave for the artist William Harvey, who hailed from Newcastle, and who introduced them to the publisher Charles Knight, another pioneer in the use of wood-engraved illustrations in popular works. Other publishers with whom they worked were Cadell of Edinburgh (on the <span class="roman">Abbotsford Edition</span> of Sir Walter Scott's novels), Joseph Cundall of Bond Street, and David Bogue. In 1850 they began an association with the publisher George Routledge, which was to underpin their later success. They were joined in their wood-engraving business by their sister Margaret in 1851, and by their brother John in 1852 and Thomas in 1860. Their business address changed to 4 Camden Street North, Camden Town (thus cited in Post Office directories from 1854). George married Mary Ann, the daughter of Josiah Rumball of Wisbech, in 1846, but they had no children.<br>
<br>The family's range of work was wide, and may be seen in the forty-nine volumes (now in the British Museum) in which they filed proofs of their engravings between 1839 and 1893. Illustrations for magazines, trade catalogues, and technical publications are here (the Dalziels supervised all the illustrations in the <span class="italic">Art Journal Illustrated Catalogue</span> of the Great Exhibition, 1851), as well as those for the artistic books for which they became famous. They became known as the largest firm of wood-engravers in London. Wood-engraving as a process involves intricate work by an individual engraver on a small block of wood. Inevitably, therefore, the organization of the craft of wood-engraving was small-scale; many wood-engravers were self-employed. The scope for making economies of scale was very limited. It was hardly possible to do more than allow engravers to specialize in, say, figures or foliage, so that blocks could be passed from engraver to engraver as necessary, slightly speeding up the process. In expanding their business from the original family co-operative, then, the Dalziels simply employed more engravers. They also took pupils (fondly remembered in the <span class="italic">Record</span>) and made a point of teaching them drawing as well as engraving. More venturesomely, in 1857 they set up their own printing shop, the Camden Press, which enabled them better to control their output and to initiate projects. To accommodate this they moved premises to 53 Camden High Street (renumbered 110 in 1863).<br>
<br>As is clear from their <span class="italic">Record</span>, the Dalziels prided themselves on the artistic illustrations they engraved and on the relationships they established with artists. At the start they engraved work by English caricaturists such as George Cruikshank, John Leech, Richard Doyle, and Kenny Meadows; by established artists such as William Harvey and Sir John Gilbert; and by artists influenced by German style, such as John Tenniel and F. R. Pickersgill. As they entered on &#145;the Golden Period of Illustration&#146; in the 1860s they became particularly associated with Pre-Raphaelite book illustration. If such a category really exists, it can be said to begin with the edition of Tennyson's <span class="italic">Poems</span>, published by Edward Moxon in 1857, which included illustrations by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Holman Hunt, and John Everett Millais, as well as by other artists who did not attempt the entranced, medievalizing scenes usually regarded as Pre-Raphaelite. The Dalziels engraved some of the blocks for the Moxon Tennyson. Their collaboration with Millais endured, and included his illustrations for Trollope's <span class="italic">Orley Farm</span> (1861), <span class="italic">Framley Parsonage</span> (1862), and <span class="italic">The Small House at Allington</span> (1864). The most notable collaboration with Millais was <span class="italic">The Parables of Our Lord</span>, a six-year project which was published in 1864. A similar but even more extended project was an illustrated <span class="roman">Bible</span>. The illustrations for this were never completely assembled, but sixty-two that were to hand were published in 1881 as <span class="italic">Dalziel's Bible Gallery</span>. This included work by Millais, Holman Hunt, Ford Madox Brown, E. J. Poynter, Lord Leighton, Edward Burne-Jones, Simeon Solomon, and Frederick Sandys, and can be seen as a Pre-Raphaelite work rather out of due time. The Dalziels also engraved work by Arthur Hughes, who might be seen as the children's Pre-Raphaelite.<br>
<br>Many of the books with engravings by the Dalziels were conceived primarily as illustrated books, and were commissioned, financed, and produced by the brothers, though they appeared over the names of other publishers. Most prominent among these were Routledge and their partners, Warne, who had a close relationship with the Dalziels, concentrating on the business side of publishing, and leaving the art direction to the engravers. The Dalziels' ventures (usually lavishly produced in gold-blocked, embossed cloth bindings, and called fine art gift books) often took the form of anthologies (of text by various writers and illustrations by various artists, the illustrations sometimes being reused in different contexts), which have been criticized as lacking a unified aesthetic. Among them were <span class="italic">The Home Affections Pourtrayed by the Poets</span> (ed. C. Mackay, 1858), <span class="italic">Summer Time in the Country</span> (ed. R. A. Willmott, 1858), <span class="italic">English Sacred Poetry</span> (ed. Willmott, 1862), <span class="italic">A Round of Days</span> (1866), <span class="italic">The Spirit of Praise</span> (1866), <span class="italic">Wayside Posies</span> (1867), <span class="italic">Golden Thoughts from Golden Fountains</span> (1867), <span class="italic">Touches of Nature</span> (1867), and <span class="italic">Picture Posies</span> (1874). There were also texts by a single author with illustrations from many hands, such as the poems of Wordsworth (1859) and Jean Ingelow (1867). Sometimes a single artist's vision of a whole work was conveyed, as in the edition of Shakespeare (1858&#150;61) illustrated by Sir John Gilbert, Bunyan's <span class="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</span> (1863) and Defoe's <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> (1864), both illustrated by J. D. Watson, and Cervantes' <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> (1866), illustrated by Arthur Boyd Houghton.<br>
<br>The Dalziels also contributed engravings of the work of their stable of artists to magazines, such as <span class="italic">Good Words</span> and the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span> (both begun in 1860) and the <span class="italic">Sunday Magazine</span> (begun 1865), which were important showcases for &#145;sixties&#146; illustration, and assisted in the emergence of several new artists with marked individual talents: Arthur Boyd Houghton, G. J. Pinwell, Frederick Sandys, M. J. Lawless, J. W. North, Fred Walker, and Frederick Barnard. Most of these contributed to another major project, the <span class="roman">Household Edition</span> of Dickens's works, published by Chapman and Hall (1871&#150;9). The Dalziels' publications in the 1860s became esteemed and collectable, and they exhibited wood-engravings at the Royal Academy in 1861&#150;3, 1866, 1869, and 1870.<br>
<br>Like all wood-engravers in the mid-Victorian period, the Dalziels practised facsimile engraving wherever possible: when an artist had provided an original drawing with clear black lines, the engravers reproduced those lines exactly. When artists introduced tone, with pencil or brushwork with Chinese white, the engravers' task was more difficult, and they developed various types of shading, which had their own appeal. If there was anything in common between the later illustrators, it was perhaps a tendency to produce designs which, while fully naturalistic, had a strong element of silhouette and pattern, and which were tight within their frames (almost as if they had been cropped down from larger, more expansive designs). Blocks engraved by the firm were signed &#145;DALZIEL&#146; in sloping script capitals.<br>
<br>The Dalziels became wealthy and prominent people, living in impressive villas in Hampstead and Primrose Hill. They seem to have conducted a sort of salon for their artists: George Du Maurier, when invited to a swell private party, said (rather disparagingly) that he &#145;would sooner far be invited to the gin and whisky parties of the brothers Dalziel &hellip; where the Queen's English is solemnly murdered every other Saturday, I believe&#146;  (<span class="italic">Young George Du Maurier &hellip; Letters, 1860&#150;67</span>, 1951, 150). In due course, however, the kind of illustration which the Dalziels promoted was superseded. More importantly, the rise of photomechanical engraving in the 1880s undermined the wood-engraving trade. In their later years, the Dalziels worked largely for comic magazines, some of which they owned, such as <span class="italic">Fun</span>, <span class="italic">Hood's Comic Annual</span>, and <span class="italic">Judy</span>. The style of illustration in many of the comic papers was not too far removed from the style of the sixties illustrators (as the work of Du Maurier in <span class="italic">Punch</span> demonstrates), but when the Dalziels brought out <span class="italic">Ally Sloper's Half-Holiday</span> in 1884 they were undoubtedly falling short of their previous standards. However, these papers did offer scope for the literary talent of George Dalziel, who enjoyed writing verses and stories for them. He published three volumes of poems. By 1893 the Dalziels were bankrupt, but the printing press carried on in business until 1905.<br>
<br>George Dalziel died on 4 August 1902 at Dalkeith, 107 Fellows Road, Hampstead, where he had lived since 1900, and was buried in Highgate cemetery. <a name="cosubject_32700"></a><span class="headword">Edward Dalziel</span>  (1817&#150;1905), <span class="occ">draughtsman and wood-engraver</span>, was the fifth son of Alexander and Elizabeth. He was born at Wooler, Northumberland, on 5 December 1817 and educated in Newcastle upon Tyne. Following his brother George to London in 1839, he joined him in his trade as wood-engraver and helped to create the firm. While George was the senior member of the firm, Edward was the driving force. &#145;The extension and development of our transactions and the carrying out of many of the fine art works which we published, is unquestionably due to my brother Edward&#146;, declared Thomas Dalziel  (White, 178). Edward trained as an artist at the life school at Clipstone Street Academy, where his fellow students included his close friend Charles Keene and John Tenniel, who was later to bring to the firm his illustrations for Lewis Carroll's <span class="italic">Alice in Wonderland</span> (1865) and <span class="italic">Through the Looking Glass</span> (1871). In his leisure time Edward painted in oils and watercolour, exhibiting at the British Institution in 1841, the Royal Academy in 1865 and 1866, and other galleries. The London addresses from which he sent in were 34 Edward Street, Hampstead Road, in 1841, and 10 St George's Square in the 1860s. In 1847 he married Jane Gurden (<i>d</i>. 1873), with whom he had five sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Dalziel contributed designs to some of the books illustrated by the firm, such as William Cullen Bryant's <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1857?), <span class="italic">Dalziels' Arabian Nights</span> (1864), and Robert Buchanan's <span class="italic">Ballad Stories of the Affections</span> (1866) and <span class="italic">North Coast</span> (1868). While competent, his designs are slightly stilted and laboured, an effect which is turned to advantage in his illustrations of chubby, doll-like children. He played the part of patron to the newer artists whom the firm launched: his private collection (sold at Christies on 19 June 1886) included substantial groups of work, many obtained &#145;direct from the artist&#146;, by Arthur Boyd Houghton, J. D. Watson, J. W. North, G. J. Pinwell, and Fred Walker. He recorded that his recreations were &#145;the love of art work&#146; and &#145;wandering about seeking all that would give a higher appreciation of the beauties of nature&#146;  (<span class="italic">Who's Who</span>). He died on 25 March 1905 at Dalkeith, 107 Fellows Road, Hampstead, where he had lived since 1900, and was buried in Highgate cemetery.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_32703"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Bolton Gilchrist Septimus Dalziel</span>  (1823&#150;1906), <span class="occ">painter and draughtsman</span>, was the seventh son of Alexander and Elizabeth. He was born at Wooler, Northumberland, on 9 May 1823 and educated in Newcastle upon Tyne. He was apprenticed to a copperplate engraver, but preferred to work as an illustrator, independently in London from 1843, and as part of the family firm from 1860 (though he began contributing to the books they illustrated from 1857). On 5 July 1856 he married Louisa, the daughter of Charles Gurden, a cook; they had five sons and three daughters and Louisa survived him.<br>
<br>Thomas was the most talented artist among the Dalziel brothers. His illustrations were more fluent and confident than those of Edward, but he tended to be influenced stylistically by other artists. In <span class="italic">The Poets of the Nineteenth Century</span> (ed. R. A. Willmott, 1857) and <span class="italic">The Home Affections Pourtrayed by the Poets</span> (ed. C. Mackay, 1858) his figure designs resemble those of John Gilbert or James Godwin, and his landscapes those of Birket Foster or Harrison Weir. In these illustrations the entire surface of his blocks was intricately worked over, but as bolder effects became more common in the firm's work his style became looser. For example, his landscapes in <span class="italic">A Round of Days</span> (1866) have more supple lines and more white space. His major work of illustration was for Bunyan's <span class="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</span> (published by Ward, Lock, and Tyler in 1865), for which he designed all the hundred small, strong engravings. Mostly placed among text and unframed, these put a premium on striking silhouette. His contributions to <span class="italic">Dalziels' Arabian Nights</span> (1865) are freely drawn and often composed with a poised and pleasing irregularity, rivalling those in the same volume (for which several artists supplied designs) by Arthur Boyd Houghton. Both Thomas and Houghton used Houghton's collection of oriental curios and costume when preparing these illustrations. Thomas was also a painter, exhibiting at the Royal Academy in the 1860s. Included in his son Herbert's studio sale (see below), and illustrated in the catalogue, were some fifteen of his highly finished watercolours of land- and seascapes, as well as many drawings. Thomas died on 17 March 1906 at Wooler House, Beltinge Road, in Herne Bay, where he had lived since 1893, and was buried in Highgate cemetery.<br>
<br>Edward Dalziel's sons kept the firm going into the second generation. Edward Gurden Dalziel (1849&#150;1888) was a painter, exhibiting often at the Royal Academy, and an illustrator, contributing designs to the <span class="roman">Household Edition</span> of Dickens's works (1871&#150;9) and to comic and other magazines. Gilbert (1853&#150;1930) learned wood-engraving with the firm, and studied art at South Kensington and the Slade School, but became more of a journalist than an artist; he worked on the family's comic papers and became the proprietor and editor of <span class="italic">Judy</span> and several other such publications. Unmarried, he recorded as his recreation &#145;the collection of art treasures and curios, especially India-proofs of the Dalziels' wood-engravings&#146;  (<span class="italic">Who's Who</span>). After the wood-engraving business went bankrupt in 1893, Edward's other two sons, Harvey Robert (<i>b</i>. 1855) and Charles Davison (<i>b</i>. 1857), carried on the Camden Press as Dalziel &amp; Co. until it closed in 1905.<br>
<br>Thomas Dalziel's sons Herbert (<i>b</i>. 1858) and Owen (<i>b</i>. 1860) were both painters, contributing frequently to Royal Academy exhibitions in the 1880s and 1890s. Many of Herbert's landscapes were illustrated in the catalogue of the sale of the contents of his studio at Sothebys, Belgravia, on 16 May 1978.<br>
