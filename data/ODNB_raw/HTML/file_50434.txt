<span class="headword">Boys,  Henry</span>  (1820&#150;1904), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 30 September 1820 at Upper Deal, Kent, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3143/', "Captain Edward Boys RN (1785&#150;1866)")</script>, superintendent of Deal dockyard from 1837 to 1841, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sayer. His younger brother Richard also joined the navy but was killed in action against pirates on the Moroccan coast in May 1846. Boys was educated at Ramsgate School before joining HMS <i>Edinburgh</i> in 1837. Her captain, William Wilmott Henderson, was a local political and naval friend of his father. <i>Edinburgh</i> was active on the coast of Syria in 1840; Boys was noted for his conduct at Beirut under heavy fire on 2 October. He was slightly wounded at the bombardment of Acre on 3 November. Between 1841 and 1845 he served in HMS <i>Illustrious</i>, flagship of the West Indies station. He impressed everyone he served under with his professionalism and personality, and with his father's active solicitation and the support of Captain Henderson he secured promotion: on 15 February 1846 he was commissioned as a lieutenant of the <i>Snake</i>, 16 guns, on the west African station. Edward Boys persuaded the liberal Admiralty board to recall his son. The <i>Snake</i> disappeared at sea after Boys left. He qualified in gunnery before returning to west Africa, in 1849, where he distinguished himself in the campaign to end the illegal Atlantic slave trade.<br>
<br>Back in Britain in 1851 Boys then followed his patron Henderson to the south-east coast of America station, Henderson's position as commander-in-chief guaranteeing Boys's promotion to commander, which occurred on 14 May 1853. Early in 1854 Boys was involved in an incident at the Falkland Islands, where Henderson had sent him, at the request of the governor, George Rennie, to deal with two American whalers who were poaching livestock. Boys apprehended them, but as they were put on trial at Port Stanley in March 1854, the <i>Express</i> was confronted by a larger American naval vessel, the <i>Germantoun</i>, which trained its guns on the courthouse and on Boys's brig. Boys stood his ground, the trial went ahead, and a dangerous incident passed. Henderson died in July 1854, but Boys remained on the Brazil station, almost dying of yellow fever. Again in Britain in 1856 he married, and on 17 October 1857 was promoted captain. In 1863 his old shipmate Captain Robert Hall, then private secretary to the first lord of the Admiralty, secured his appointment to HMS <i>Pelorus</i> destined for China; there he transferred into HMS <i>Barrosa</i> and he remained on station until 1866. During his absence his parents died. In July 1867 Boys took command of HMS <i>Warrior</i> for her second commission in the channel. In this fine ship he consolidated his reputation as an outstanding officer. He was involved in securing the queen from an alleged Fenian plot to kidnap her from the grounds of Osborne, and she visited the ship, a rare honour. In August 1868 <i>Warrior</i> and <i>Royal Oak</i> collided, but Boys was acquitted of responsibility. The following year he commanded three ships towing a huge floating dock from Madeira to Bermuda, and manoeuvred the dock into Bermuda harbour. He was then appointed captain of the gunnery training ship <i>Excellent</i>, the most important captain's command in the service. He remained five years, with many of the future leaders of the navy serving on his staff, including John Fisher, with whom he co-operated on the early development of torpedoes. In February 1872 Boys commanded the naval brigade sent to the thanksgiving service at St Paul's Cathedral, for the recovery from typhoid of the prince of Wales, the first occasion when the navy took the place of honour on a royal ceremonial occasion.<br>
<br>In May 1874 Boys followed his lifelong friend and immediate predecessor at <i>Excellent</i>, Arthur Hood, as director of naval ordnance. He was responsible for weapons during a period of rapid technical progress and applied his profound understanding of the sea and gunnery to the development of new systems. His regime, like that of Hood, was one of steady if unspectacular progress. In April 1875 he went to Malta on HMS <i>Devastation</i>, the first capital ship without sails, to report on her sea-keeping and massive 35 ton guns. Promoted rear-admiral on 30 July 1875 he worked closely with his friends, the controller Admiral Houston Stewart, the secretary Admiral Robert Hall, and the second sea lord Admiral Hood. In 1878 Boys took a sea command. Initially he commanded the Reserve Fleet, mobilized when the channel squadron went to the Mediterranean. Next he was second in command of a fleet under Admiral Cooper Key, preparing for service in the Baltic. Later he investigated the tragic explosion of a 12 inch Armstrong RML gun on the battleship <i>Thunderer</i>, establishing that the gun had been double-loaded, and ensuring the end of muzzle-loading guns in the Royal Navy.<br>
<br>Boys came ashore in mid-1879, served on committees concerned with port defences and small arms, and reported on gun trials. On 1 April 1881 he became vice-admiral. After promotion to full admiral on 1 June 1885 he retired. He became a director of the Nordenfelt Gun Company and the Barrow Shipbuilding Company until they were bought by Vickers. He was twice chairman of the Royal United Services Institution, and remained a vice-president until his death. He was also a governor of the Marine Society. He remained active until his final year, and died at Blackheath on 16 March 1904. Boys was a fine seaman, a careful innovator, and an effective leader. His early career was made by his father and local political friends, but his merits ensured his continued success as a captain and admiral. He was one of the modernizers of the navy.<br>
