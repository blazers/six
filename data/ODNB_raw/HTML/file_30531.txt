<span class="headword">Baillie,  Charles Wallace Alexander Napier Ross  Cochrane-</span>, second Baron Lamington  (1860&#150;1940), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born in London on 29 July 1860, the fourth child and only son of the politician and author <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5760/', "Alexander Dundas Ross Cochrane-Wishart-Baillie, first Baron Lamington (1816&#150;1890)")</script>, and his wife, Annabella Mary Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1917), elder daughter of Andrew Robert Drummond, of Cadlands, Hampshire. He was educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford (1877&#150;81), graduating BA. In 1885 he became assistant private secretary to Lord Salisbury, and after an unsuccessful candidature at North St Pancras in the same year, he entered parliament as Conservative member for that constituency in 1886. He spent only four years in the House of Commons, succeeding his father as Baron Lamington in 1890.<br>
<br>Lamington was an enthusiastic sportsman and traveller, and after visiting Central America he undertook a lengthy expedition through Indo-China in 1890&#150;91. Following the presentation of papers on this journey to the Royal Geographical Society of London, he was elected an honorary fellow of the society, and later appointed to its council (1908&#150;12) and was vice-president from 1912 to 1915. On 13 June 1895 he married Mary Haughton Hozier (<i>d</i>. 1944), lady of the bedchamber to the princess of Wales and youngest daughter of the first Baron Newlands. They had two children. On 10 October 1895 Lamington was appointed governor of Queensland, arriving in the colony in 1896 and serving until 1901. In November 1899 Lamington called upon Andrew Dawson to form a short-lived administration, which became the first Labour government anywhere in the world. But in his dispatches Lamington demonstrated his clear dislike of the growing strength of socialism in Australia and he feared that the federation of the country could lead to its dominance. Queensland was at the time afflicted by a seven-year drought. To gain an understanding of the hardship this was causing, and also to investigate the condition of the indigenous peoples, Lamington travelled widely in Queensland and New Guinea.<br>
<br>In 1901 Lamington returned to his Lanarkshire estates, and two years later was appointed administrator of Bombay. There he took a keen interest in the conditions of the people and social reform. He resigned as governor in 1907 as a result of the serious illness of his wife.<br>
<br>Lamington was active in the territorial movement. He was lieutenant-colonel of the Lanarkshire yeomanry, and an honorary colonel of the 6th battalion of the Scottish Rifles (Cameronians). He was also captain of the Royal Company of Archers, the king's bodyguard for Scotland. During the First World War he vigorously encouraged recruiting, and in 1919 he went to Syria as commissioner of the British relief unit. Lamington retained an interest in movements supporting the welfare of subject peoples and minorities within the empire, and a greater mutual understanding between West and East. He was a member of a range of organizations working in this field.<br>
<br>On 13 March 1940 Lord Lamington was present at a meeting of the Royal Central Asian Society at Caxton Hall. At this meeting a man in the audience rose and fired several shots at the occupants of the platform, killing Sir Michael O'Dwyer and wounding others: Lamington was shot in the arm.<br>
<br>Described as &#145;tall and straight, with an erect and soldierly carriage&#146; and as having a &#145;scientific mind and manner of thought&#146;  (<span class="italic">Queensland 1900</span>, 2), Lamington was appointed GCMG in 1900 and GCIE in 1903. He also had the singular honour of having a popular Australian dish named after him&#151;a small, rectangular, plain sponge cake, dipped in chocolate and rolled in desiccated coconut&#151;the &#145;lamington&#146;. Lamington died at Lamington House, Lanarkshire, on 16 September 1940.<br>
