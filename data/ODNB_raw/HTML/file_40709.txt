<span class="headword">Clark,  (Thomas) Edward</span>  (1888&#150;1962), <span class="occ">music administrator and conductor</span>, was born on 10 May 1888 at 125 Westmorland Road, Newcastle upon Tyne, one of three children of James Bowness Clark (1863/4&#150;1934), coal exporter and dedicated amateur musician, and his wife, Elizabeth Thirlaway (1858/9&#150;1939). The Clark home was a local centre of musical activity, with James for two decades the secretary of the Newcastle and Gateshead Choral Union; he donated a complete set of brass and woodwind instruments to the Newcastle Philharmonic Orchestra and later left his large collection of scores, music books, and concert programmes to the Newcastle City Library. After leaving school, Edward toured the continent, studying for a time in Paris (1907&#150;8), where he met the composers Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and Albert Roussel. His stimulating musical experiences were the basis of a formal presentation given upon his return to Newcastle, launching the mission that pervaded his entire career: to encourage British audiences &#145;to understand this music of to-day before it becomes the music of the day before yesterday&#146;  (T. E. Clark, <span class="italic">Paper on a Modern French Composer: Claude Debussy</span>, privately printed, 1908).<br>
<br>In 1909 Clark moved to Berlin and there took lessons from the conductor Oskar Fried while working as a correspondent for the <span class="italic">Musical Times</span>. In October 1910 he was introduced to the composers Arnold Schoenberg and Anton Webern, a meeting that changed the course of his professional life. After Schoenberg moved to Berlin a year later, Clark helped him to raise funds, studied with him (1911&#150;14), and was an active participant in his circle, attending concerts and social events with Webern, the composer Ferruccio Busoni, the pianist Eduard Steuermann, and others who lived in Berlin or visited Schoenberg there. Clark decided to remain in Germany, but his plans were thwarted when war was declared. He was interned at the Ruhleben racecourse near Berlin until 1917, when he was released through the auspices of the Red Cross.<br>
<br>After returning to England, Clark found conducting opportunities, assisting Ernest Ansermet and Adrian Boult with the London seasons of the Ballets Russes. On 10 August 1921 he married Frances Dorothy 
    (Dolly; <i>b</i>. 1893/4)
  , the daughter of a retired army officer, Arthur James Stephen. In the same year Clark devised, produced, and conducted a ground-breaking series of orchestral concerts in London, exploring new music by British and continental composers. However, these projects were financially unsuccessful, and, faced with family responsibilities once his son James was born in 1923, he joined the BBC in August 1924 and soon became musical director of the Newcastle station. Administrative shortcomings were noted from the start, but his imaginative ideas and interests in new music transformed the region's music broadcasts, invoking praise from the community as well as the attention of the music department in London. Although Dolly left him in summer 1925, Clark remained in Newcastle until the station orchestra was discontinued at the end of the following year.<br>
<br>In January 1927 Clark transferred to the BBC in London, where he became a programme builder and conducted studio broadcasts. Further administrative deficiencies led to a curtailing of his responsibilities, but his unusual musical interests and wide-ranging European contacts distinctively shaped the BBC's music programming of the inter-war years. In particular, the <span class="italic">BBC Concerts of Contemporary Music</span>, aired from 1926 to 1939, brought to British listeners the latest in art music, showcasing works by composers such as Schoenberg, Webern, Berg, Stravinsky, Bart&oacute;k, Kod&aacute;ly, Prokofiev, Hindemith, Krenek, Vaughan Williams, Bridge, Van Dieren, Busoni, and Falla, often performed by the composers themselves or their advocates. Clark contributed to the ingenious structuring of the new BBC Symphony Orchestra in 1929. He also served on the committee recommending British works to the jury of the International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM), and was the music director of the Arts Theatre Club in London. In 1936 Clark's integrity was questioned concerning the use of BBC funds during a business trip. He in turn was infuriated by alterations to programmes he had devised for the BBC Symphony Orchestra's spring tour, and resigned from the music department in March. Although he occasionally worked as a consultant programme builder, gave broadcast talks, and conducted for the BBC subsequently, he never again worked for the corporation as a full-time employee.<br>
<br>Indeed, Clark never again worked anywhere on a full-time basis. In 1938 he met the composer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31382/', "(Agnes) Elisabeth Lutyens (1906&#150;1983)")</script>, and they married on 9 May 1942. He continued his work as a freelance conductor, and once again served his home community during the war years, returning to Newcastle to found and conduct the North East Regional Orchestra. In winter 1945&#150;6 he used an inheritance from his brother to mount three concerts at the Wigmore Hall, London, featuring music by British and European composer colleagues. For the BBC Third Programme in 1948 he devised and presented an important series of eight programmes, <span class="italic">Turning Points in Twentieth-Century Music</span>, explaining and comparing works by Schoenberg, Bart&oacute;k, and Stravinsky. He devoted himself to the promotion of new music, serving as honorary secretary of the ISCM (1936&#150;1947), organizer of the London ISCM Festival (1946), ISCM president (1947&#150;52), chairman of the London Contemporary Music Centre (1947&#150;52), and music adviser to the Institute for Contemporary Arts (from its inception in 1948). He also conducted music that Lutyens composed for the BBC radio features department into the 1950s. However, in 1955 Clark brought a slander suit against the composer Benjamin Frankel, claiming that Frankel had falsely accused him of embezzling ISCM funds. After five days of testimony, in which the legal teams focused on a possible communist subplot, Clark lost the suit, but felt exonerated since the jury stated that his integrity was not in doubt. Nevertheless, he never regained his standing in the music community. He died suddenly of a coronary thrombosis at his home, 76A Belsize Park Gardens, Hampstead, London, on 30 April 1962, and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 4 May.<br>
<br>The lack of administrative skills that ultimately led to the notorious suit plagued Clark throughout his professional life and caused many to overlook the significance of his contribution: Clark's passion for new music, innovatory programming schemes, and positions in leading new music organizations, particularly the BBC during its formative years, had a profound impact in shaping British music-making of the twentieth century.<br>
