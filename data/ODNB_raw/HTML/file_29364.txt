<span class="headword">Wigan,  Horace</span>  (1815/16&#150;1885), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, was born in Blackheath, Kent, the son of James Wigan, a teacher of languages who at one time was secretary to the Dramatic Authors' Society. His older brother was the actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29363/', "Alfred Sydney Wigan")</script>. Evidence of his birthdate is contradictory but on his marriage, on 24 June 1844, to Emma Herbert (<i>b</i>. 1813/14), daughter of Henry Thompson, his age was recorded as twenty-eight. His occupation was given as schoolmaster. He was first seen in Dublin, on 1 August 1853, as Billy Lackaday in <span class="italic">Sweethearts and Wives</span>, and later replaced Webb as King Bruin in <span class="italic">Good Woman in the Wood</span>. After leaving Dublin he made, under the name Danvers, his first appearance in London, on 1 May 1854 at the Olympic, as Paddy Murphy in Lever's extravaganza <span class="italic">The Happy Man</span>. He was the original O'Rafferty in Tom Taylor's <span class="italic">A Blighted Being</span> on 17 October, but failed to win acceptance as a representative of Irishmen, and made no mark for four years. On 5 June 1858, under his own name, he was the first Smythers, a hairdresser, in Taylor's <span class="italic">Going to the Bad</span>, and on 2 December the first Smoothly Smirk in John Oxenford's <span class="italic">The Porter's Knot</span>. His next parts included Abder Khan in H. J. Byron's burlesque <span class="italic">Mazeppa</span>, Horatio Cocles Bric-&agrave;-brac in Taylor's <span class="italic">Payable on Demand</span>, and Mr Cunningham in Taylor's <span class="italic">Nine Points of the Law</span>. At the Strand on 26 September 1860 he produced an adaptation from the French entitled <span class="italic">Observation and Flirtation</span>. He was the original Solomon Probity in H. T. Craven's <span class="italic">The Chimney Corner</span> (21 February 1861). His own <span class="italic">Change for a Sovereign</span> was produced at the Strand on 14 March, and on 30 June he created the part of Symptom, an imaginary invalid, in his play from the French <span class="italic">A Charming Woman</span> (<span class="italic">&Agrave; trente ans</span>). His <span class="italic">Friends or Foes</span>, from Victorien Sardou's <span class="italic">Nos intimes</span>, was given at the St James's on 8 March 1862, and was the best of his adaptations. While still performing at the Olympic, he was the first Fusell in Watts Phillips's <span class="italic">Camilla's Husband</span> (14 November 1862) and the first Blush in <span class="italic">Taming a Truant</span>, his own adaptation of Sardou's <span class="italic">Papillone</span> (19 March 1863). His first distinct acting success was as the original Hawkshaw, a detective, in Taylor's <span class="italic">The Ticket-of-Leave Man</span> (27 June 1863).<br>
<br>On 1 November 1864 Wigan undertook the management of the Olympic, the only house in which he had been seen in London, and produced on the opening night Taylor's <span class="italic">The Hidden Hand</span> and two farces, Oxenford's <span class="italic">The Girl I Left behind me</span> and John Maddison Morton's <span class="italic">My Wife's Bonnet</span>&#151;all three adaptations. While manager he continued to act in a variety of parts, and in 1865 brought out his own play <span class="italic">Always Intended</span>. By 1866, however, he had resigned the Olympic to Benjamin Webster, though he remained acting manager. He was the first Percy Chaffington in Maddison Morton's <span class="italic">If I had a Thousand a Year</span> (21 October 1867) and Cornelius Tattenham in <span class="italic">From Grave to Gay</span>, by Ben Webster the younger (2 December 1867). In J. S. Coyne's <span class="italic">The Woman of the World</span> (<span class="italic">Les coulisses de la vie</span>) he created the part of the first Golden Bird (18 February 1868). Inspector Javert in <span class="italic">The Yellow Passport</span> (7 November), an adaptation of <span class="italic">Les mis&eacute;rables</span>, was another success. <span class="italic">The Life Chase</span>, an adaptation by Wigan and Oxenford of <span class="italic">Le drame de la rue de la Paix</span>, was produced at the Gaiety on 11 October 1869, and a melodrama by Wigan entitled <span class="italic">Rag Fair</span>, in which he played a cheapjack called Brightside, was given at the Victoria on 20 May 1872. At the Gaiety (14 December) he played the Doctor in <span class="italic">Awaking</span>, Campbell Clarke's version of <span class="italic">Marcel</span>, and in the Vaudeville's revival of <span class="italic">The Road to Ruin</span> he was Sulky (1 November 1873). In a performance of <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> at Drury Lane, for Webster's benefit, he was Rowley.<br>
<br>On 24 April 1875, as manager, Wigan opened the Holborn Theatre, renamed the Mirror, with a revival of <span class="italic">The Hidden Hand</span>, Maltby's <span class="italic">Make yourself at Home</span>, and James Kenney's <span class="italic">Maids of Honour</span>. On 29 May he was the original Inspector Walker in <span class="italic">The Detective</span> (<span class="italic">Le parricide</span>), adapted by Clement Scott and E. Manuel. However, his speculation was not successful. The theatre passed into other hands and, after frequent changes of name, was demolished. On Wigan's retirement from management a complimentary benefit was given him at Drury Lane. He died on 7 August 1885 at Woodbank, Sidcup, Kent, the house of his daughter Jane Emma Hernu.<br>
<br>Wigan was a quiet, stolid, undemonstrative actor, whose chief success was obtained in detective parts which called for no display of emotion. Rowley in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> suited him exactly, and showed the measure of his intelligence. He was a fair linguist and translated many pieces. Nicoll lists twenty-four plays and adaptations by him.<br>
