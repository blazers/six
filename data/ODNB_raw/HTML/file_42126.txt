<span class="headword">Acres,  Birt</span>  (1854?&#150;1918), <span class="occ">film-maker</span>, was born in Richmond, Virginia, USA, most probably on 23 July 1854, to British parents who had emigrated to America as prospective farmers. No record of his early life has been found; we know only that his father's name was John Acres, but he later told of being orphaned during the Civil War when the family farmstead, possibly in North Carolina, was burnt to the ground in 1865. He stayed with an aunt in Richmond, Virginia, who sent him to Paris about 1870 to finish his education. It was probably here that his interest in moving images was sparked; he later recalled experimenting with sequence photographs in a zoetrope. In 1875 he returned to his aunt, but soon set out to prove himself. He later told his children of adventures as a frontiersman on the North American plains, trapping and trading with the Rosebud Sioux tribe, who called him Red Pine.<br>
<br>In the 1880s Acres came to Britain, and from the early 1890s he contributed articles on photographic chemistry and optics to the <span class="italic">Photographic News Almanac</span>. In 1891, when he was living in Hackney and was employed as a photographer, he joined the London and Provincial Photographic Association. His prints and lantern slides often featured transient subjects: clouds, waves, and flowers opening. On 29 April 1891 he married Annie Elizabeth Cash (1863&#150;1955/6), daughter of Isaac Cash, business clerk. A son, Sidney Birt Acres, was born on 28 July 1892, and later two daughters, Winifred (1 December 1893) and Lulu (6 November 1896).<br>
<br>In the summer of 1892 Acres became manager of Elliott &amp; Sons photographic works at Barnet, Hertfordshire. Inspired by the work of Eadweard Muybridge, he returned to his experiments with sequence photographs. His <span class="italic">Story of a Cloud</span>, showing changing formations, was shown to the Photographic Society in 1892, using his patented device (patent no. 23670, 1893) for projecting a sequence of slides in quick succession, simulating movement. The device could also be used for photography. In 1893 he suffered a serious accident during a chemical experiment, but over the months his damaged eyesight recovered. Realizing the limitations of glass as a medium for sequence photography, he was by now experimenting with 2&frac34; inch celluloid roll film, manufactured for Eastman's snapshot cameras. His assistant Arthur Melbourne Cooper later described how they used an experimental motion picture film camera to shoot sequences of the opening of the Manchester Ship Canal in January 1894, and there is some evidence that Acres filmed the Henley regatta in July. But results on unperforated film were imperfect, and at that time no one had succeeded in motion picture film projection.<br>
<br>In 1895 Acres became a fellow of the Royal Photographic Society. Meanwhile a young English mechanic&#150;electrician, Robert William Paul, had discovered Edison's Kinetoscope arcade peepshow film machine, developed before screen projection of films could be achieved, and was making copies. Paul needed to produce his own films, and was introduced to Acres. Paul constructed a camera to Acres' design, which Acres tested in March 1895. Fragments of the successful test using 35 mm perforated film show their mutual friend Henry Short and Annie Acres outside the Acres' residence, Clovelly Cottage, Barnet. Acres made an agreement with Paul to supply films, and on 30 March 1895 filmed Britain's first news film, the <span class="italic">Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race</span>, and the Derby horse race on 29 May. By early June he had shot several one minute comic subjects in a purpose-built studio, including <span class="italic">The Arrest of a Pickpocket</span> and <span class="italic">The Comic Shoeblack</span>. Acres patented the mechanism (patent no. 10474, 1895) in May. He resigned from Elliott's and began an association with Stollwerck, a German chocolate company with an interest in arcade slot machines, and on 20 June filmed scenes at the opening of the Kiel Canal. Paul and Acres ended their agreement acrimoniously in July 1895.<br>
<br>Acres developed a projector, probably demonstrated to his family later that year, which was soon ready for a more public exhibition. On 10 January 1896 he gave a presentation to the Lyonsdown Photographic Association at Barnet, and on 24 January to the Royal Photographic Society in London&#151;the first film screenings in England. On 21 March 1896 he opened a commercial cinema venue at 2 Piccadilly Mansions, London, but a fire on 10 June closed the show. <span class="italic">Rough Sea at Dover</span>, filmed by Acres, was shown in New York in April. In that month he started the Northern Photographic Works at Barnet, but he sold the company the following year, retaining some shares. Meanwhile he was presenting his films at prestigious events including, at Marlborough House on 21 July 1896, the first royal command film performance. He filmed the disastrous launch of HMS <i>Albion</i> on the Thames on 21 June 1898, when a wooden structure occupied by spectators collapsed into the river and thirty-eight people died. That same month he patented a cinematograph system for amateurs&#151;the eponymous Birtac. The first narrow-gauge motion picture system, this ingenious apparatus for shooting and projection failed commercially.<br>
<br>By this time Acres's most important and acclaimed achievements were behind him, his activities mostly being devoted to the production of materials for the photographic and cinema trade. In 1901 he founded the Whetstone Photographic Works. Financially overstretched after commissioning a 42 foot yacht in 1906, his business failed later that year, and he became bankrupt in 1909. He died at the London Hospital, Whitechapel, on 27 December 1918, when appendicitis turned to peritonitis, and was buried in Walthamstow cemetery three days later. A very significant figure in the nascent film industry, Birt Acres's photographic skills and technical ingenuity were key elements in his successful shooting and projection of this country's first presentable motion picture films.<br>
