<span class="headword">Thackeray,  Thomas James <span class="st"> [Tom]</span></span>  (1796&#150;1877), <span class="occ">playwright, army officer, and agriculturist</span>, was born on 5 September 1796 in Madras, India, the elder son of Thomas Thackeray (1767&#150;1852) of Bath, a surgeon on the Madras establishment of the East India Company, and his first wife, Frances (Fanny) Ward (<i>d</i>. 1800), daughter of the Revd Henry Ward of Stevenage, Hertfordshire. He entered Eton College in January 1810, went up to St John's College, Cambridge, as a pensioner on 15 October 1814, and was awarded the degree of MB in 1820. After an interval he was commissioned, on 26 March 1824, as ensign in the 2nd Somerset militia. Eventually he rose to the rank of captain, on 10 January 1842, which rank he retained until his retirement on 11 August 1855. He lived for a time at Clench Wharton, Norfolk, but he was a fluent speaker of French and spent much of his adult life resident in Paris.<br>
<br>Thackeray began his writing career in the drama&#151;a not uncommon part-time occupation for army officers&#151;with <span class="italic">The Barber Baron</span> (Haymarket, 8 September 1828), a farce about a Strasbourg barber who wins a ch&acirc;teau by lottery. William Farren and John Reeve won praise as baron and comic porter, though an otherwise hostile <span class="italic">Times</span> was determined to consign to &#145;just oblivion &hellip; such a piece of unsuited and unmitigated dulness&#146;  (10 Sept 1828). It was published by Thomas Richardson in 1830, and was followed by an unpublished melodrama, <span class="italic">The Castle of Wolfenstein</span> (Olympic, November 1828), and <span class="italic">The Executioner</span> (Coburg, February 1829), published in <span class="italic">Richardson's New Minor Drama</span> (vol. 3, 1830). For the summer season at the Haymarket in 1830 Thackeray wrote <span class="italic">The Force of Nature</span> and (with Charles Shannon) the farce <span class="italic">My Wife, my Place</span>. He instinctively turned to foreign models for inspiration, especially in the former play, which, set in Paris, was considered &#145;striking and effective&#146; in situation  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 17 July 1830). A historical drama, <span class="italic">Gustavus of Sweden, or, The Masked Ball</span> was licensed in 1833, but his best success was probably <span class="italic">The Mountain Sylph</span> (1834), a largely versified &#145;romantic ballet opera&#146;, with music by John Barnett. This was almost Thackeray's last venture into drama in Britain, though <span class="italic">L'abbaye de Penmarc'h</span>, a three-act melodrama written jointly with Pierre Tournemine, was performed in Paris at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de la Porte St Antoine (2 February 1840) and published in that city.<br>
<br>Thackeray's intimate knowledge of the contrasts between the theatre in London and Paris made his advice invaluable to the growing number of dramatists who sought radical theatrical reform in Britain in the 1830s. His pamphlet <span class="italic">On Theatrical Emancipation, and the Rights of Dramatic Authors</span> (1832) showed the unequivocal superiority of conditions for French (and Belgian) authors compared to British, who, lacking copyright protection and fair remuneration, laboured under a state-sustained monopoly in London which restricted not only the number of theatres but also the class of drama that each was permitted to perform. Thackeray's evidence underpinned the case of the anti-monopoly agitators, whose ally in parliament, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, chaired the select committee (1832) inquiring into the state of the drama, the immediate result of which was reform of dramatic copyright in 1833.<br>
<br>Thackeray was also an agriculturist and published extensively on the subject, exclusively in French, from 1846 to the late 1850s. A history of the Royal Agricultural Society, England, appeared in 1848, but his special interests included drainage, barn construction, the use of farmyard dung and artificial fertilizers, and the benefits of deep ploughing. His large-scale <span class="italic">Registre du cultivateur, ou, Livre complet de tous ses comptes</span> (8 vols., Paris, 1850&#150;57) detailed the work of a farmer on a month-to-month basis.<br>
<br>Thackeray's other writings, on the army and firearms, were exclusively in English. This included a two-volume treatise on the military organization and administration of France (1856); but his best-known work was the manual for soldiers on the principles of rifle-firing over various distances (1854; 3rd edn, 1861), the foundation of which was a series of three lectures he delivered at the Guildhall, Bath, in 1853 (separately published, 1853).<br>
<br>Thackeray was a man of means, his father having left him well off. As described by Mrs William Bayne, &#145;[h]e was a most agreeable man of the world, and had a fair share of good looks&#146;  (Mrs R. Prynne and Mrs W. Bayne, xxx). He had a considerable circle of friends, including several authors, such as James Robinson Planch&eacute;, Thomas J. Serle, and Edward Bulwer-Lytton. However, in 1840 his involvement, as an agent of Bulwer's, in attempted burglary at the Paris dwelling of Bulwer's estranged wife to recover certain papers and also to suborn witnesses against her, astonished all who knew him, including his second cousin the novelist William Makepeace Thackeray, who commented: &#145;What the juice have Tom Thackeray and Lawson [his accomplice] been about?&#151;they are both gentlemen and I can't conceive what could bring them to meddle with such dirty work&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Private Papers</span>, 1.434). Lady Bulwer's double civil action against them in Paris aroused much public interest in that city and in London. Both defendants were acquitted, none of the prosecution evidence having been heard, on the grounds that Lady Bulwer could not sue for civil redress without her husband's permission, which not surprisingly he refused to give. The judgment was confirmed on appeal. The scandal was conceivably the cause of the apparent delay in Thackeray's promotion to captain.<br>
<br>Tom Thackeray was unmarried. He died in France at his home at 83 rue du Faubourg St Honor&eacute;, Paris, on 21 February 1877.<br>
