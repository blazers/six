<span class="headword">Radcliffe,  Robert</span>, first earl of Sussex  (1482/3&#150;1542), <span class="occ">soldier and courtier</span>, was the son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22984/', "John Ratcliffe, sixth Baron Fitzwalter (1452&#150;1496)")</script>, and his wife, Margaret. The sixth baron was attainted and executed in 1496 for his part in the Perkin Warbeck conspiracy and it was not until November 1505 that the attainder was reversed. His son was first summoned to parliament as Baron Fitzwalter on 28 November 1511, following an act of parliament in 1509 confirming his right to the title (1 Hen. VIII c. 19), but his rehabilitation had already been confirmed on 23 June 1509 when he was made a knight of the Bath, while on the following day he was lord sewer at Henry VIII's coronation.<br>
<br>Radcliffe prospered in the early years of Henry VIII's reign through friendship with and proximity to the young king. In 1513 he served in the vanguard of the army in France under the earl of Shrewsbury. In 1521 he served at sea, and in the following year campaigned under the earl of Surrey at Morlaix and in Picardy. In 1515 he took part in the ceremony at which Wolsey received his cardinal's hat; he was at the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520; on 7 May 1524 he was installed as a knight of the Garter; by February 1526 he was a member of the king's council. On 18 July 1525, at the creation of Henry Fitzroy as duke of Richmond, he was raised to the dignity of Viscount Fitzwalter.<br>
<br>Fitzwalter was above all a loyal servant of Henry VIII, and as such he supported the king's divorce from Katherine of Aragon. In June 1529, aged forty-six, he gave evidence concerning the latter's marriage to Prince Arthur and its consummation. It was his loyalty which led to his being created earl of Sussex on 8 December that year. On 7 May 1531 he became lieutenant of the Order of the Garter and on 31 May 1532 was appointed one of the chamberlains of the exchequer. He served as lord sewer at the coronation of Anne Boleyn and was appointed to carry the king's demands to Katherine of Aragon in December 1533. On 23 June 1537 he was granted the reversion of stewardship of the royal household, once held by his father and now by the fourth earl of Shrewsbury, but when Shrewsbury died the following year he was succeeded, apparently without letters patent, by the duke of Suffolk. This turn of events shows the limitations of Sussex's power, though he was compensated by being made chief steward of the duchy of Lancaster in the north on 5 December 1539, a position formerly held by Suffolk. He exchanged his new office for the duchy's southern stewardship on 17 November 1540 and held that until his death. He had previously played an important role in quelling the disturbances in the north of England in 1536&#150;7: he was appointed, along with the earl of Derby, to quell unrest in Lancashire and between February and April 1537 suppressed the abbeys of Whalley and Furness. On 9 May 1540 he was sent to Calais to head a commission to inquire into charges of misgovernment and sacramentarianism there, having already reached the pinnacle of his career in royal service when he was made lord great chamberlain of England for life on 3 May.<br>
<br>Despite this impressive <i>cursus honorum</i> Sussex seems to have been only a second-rate politician and statesman. In 1538 he was described as being &#145;of small power and little discretion and many words&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 13/2, no. 732). His military resources were small and he rarely attended meetings of the council. He had, however, close links with Thomas Howard, third duke of Norfolk, from whom he held the manor of Wrentham, Suffolk, for half a knight's fee. Cromwell, wary of his close links with Norfolk, may for that reason have prevented him from becoming lord steward. Conversely, his siding with Norfolk against Cromwell probably explains his elevation to the chamberlaincy and his dispatch to Calais in May 1540 following the chief minister's fall from power in the previous month.<br>
<br>Sussex married three times. His first wife was Lady Elizabeth Stafford, daughter of the second duke of Buckingham, whom he married before 1507 and with whom he had Henry, the second earl, George, who married a daughter of John, second Baron Marney, and Sir Humphrey Radcliffe of Elnestow, later MP for Bedfordshire. Elizabeth died some time before 11 May 1532, and by 1 September following Sussex married Lady Margaret Stanley, daughter of the second earl of Derby. A special dispensation was needed as the two were within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity. They had two daughters, Anne, who married Thomas, second Baron Wharton, and Jane (<i>d</i>. 1552), who married Anthony Browne, first Viscount Montagu. Margaret probably died in February 1534, and on 14 January 1537 her husband married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1557), daughter of Sir John Arundell of Lanherne, Cornwall [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/723/', "Arundell, Mary")</script>]. They had two children, of whom the eldest was baptized on 22 March 1538 but died in infancy; the couple's second son, John, was baptized at St Laurence Pountney on 31 December 1539, knighted in February 1547, and died on 9 November 1568. Sussex died on 26 or 27 November 1542 and was buried in the church of St Laurence Pountney, London, but his remains were later removed to Boreham, Essex. In 1545 his widow married Henry Fitzalan, twelfth earl of Arundel, and died childless on 20 October 1557. The claims once made for her literary attainments have proved to be unfounded; the translations of classical texts surviving among the royal manuscripts in the British Library, once attributed to her, are children's exercises written by her stepdaughter Mary, later duchess of Norfolk.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_22981"></a><span class="headword">Henry Radcliffe</span>, second earl of Sussex  (<em>c.</em>1507&#150;1557)<span class="occ"></span>, was aged about thirty-five when his father died. He combined service to the crown with a regional interest in East Anglia and a close affinity to the Howard family. He accompanied Henry VIII to Calais and Boulogne to meet the French king Fran&ccedil;ois I in 1532 and was made a knight of the Bath at the coronation of Anne Boleyn. In 1539 he was one of the commissioners given responsibility for the defence of the Norfolk coast and in the 1544 invasion of France commanded 100 footmen in the vanguard under Norfolk. He survived the disgrace of the Howards in 1547 and exercised his hereditary office of lord sewer at the coronation of Edward VI. In April 1551 he was made joint lord lieutenant of Norfolk, and was reappointed in May 1552 and May 1553.<br>
<br>Sussex gave important support to the coup which brought Princess Mary to the throne. At the time of Edward VI's death he was at Atleburgh in Suffolk. According to Robert Wingfield, the earl (who was conservative in religion) was immediately inclined to support the princess's claims, but was deterred by Lord Robert Dudley's telling him that Edward was still alive. He was persuaded to throw in his lot with Mary when his son Henry was captured by Sir John Huddleston with letters from his father to the council at Westminster. To protect his son Sussex now joined the princess at Kenninghall and raised a substantial body of men on her behalf. Presumably on the strength of his military experience he was made her commander-in-chief, &#145;the queen's lieutenant and, as the proverb goes, her mouth and chin&#146;  (MacCulloch, 261). On 17 May he was made a privy councillor, and in November he served as a commissioner at the trial of Lady Jane Grey. His rewards included the wardenship of the royal forests south of Trent and annuities worth about &pound;300. In 1554 he was elected a knight of the Garter, and in 1556 lord lieutenant of Norfolk and Suffolk. But although Sussex was active in pursuing heretics in Norfolk, he did not always support royal policy. He opposed Mary's marriage to Philip (but later accepted a Habsburg pension) and upheld the position of Princess Elizabeth as the queen's heir presumptive. One of the councillors who escorted Elizabeth to the Tower in 1554, he is reported to have wept and warned his colleagues, &#145;What will ye doe, my Lordes &hellip; She was a kinges daughter and is the queenes syster, and ye have no sufficient commyssyon so to do&#146;  (Loach, 92).<br>
<br>Sussex married twice. His first wife, married before 21 May 1524, was Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Howard, second duke of Norfolk. They had three sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22993/', "Thomas Radcliffe")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22982/', "Henry Radcliffe")</script>, successively third and fourth earls, and Robert who predeceased his father. One of Anne Boleyn's attendants when Henry VIII met Fran&ccedil;ois I at Calais in 1532, Elizabeth died on 18 September 1534, and by 21 November 1538 her husband had remarried. <a name="cosubject_75611"></a><span class="headword">Anne Radcliffe</span>, countess of Sussex  (<em>d.</em> 1579<span class="mult">x</span>82)<span class="occ"></span>, was the daughter of Sir Philip Calthorp, a Norfolk landowner, and his second wife, Jane Blennerhassett. She and Sussex had three children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22979/', "Egremont Radcliffe")</script>; Maud, who died young; and Frances, who married Sir Thomas Mildmay. But the relationship proved stormy, at least partly because of religious differences. Sussex's conservatism was not shared by his wife, who had a position in Queen Katherine Parr's household and shared the latter's evangelicalism&#151;she was one of the queen's ladies whom Anne Askew was pressed to incriminate in 1546. But there seem to have been other differences. In 1552 the countess was in the Tower, charged with sorcery, and when she fled abroad after Mary's accession her husband divorced her; in November 1553 a bill was introduced into parliament &#145;against the adulterous living of the late countess of Sussex&#146;  (Loach, 71). The bill did not pass, nor did another in 1555 which would have deprived her of her jointure unless she came back to England and underwent purgation before a bishop. But she may have returned, for in the following year she acted as intermediary between the French ambassador and Princess Elizabeth, when the latter was contemplating flight abroad. In April 1557 she was in the Fleet prison, but the bill which finally passed in 1558 was somewhat more generous over her jointure than the abortive previous ones had been.<br>
<br>By then Sussex was dead, having described Anne in his will as &#145;my unnaturall and unkynde devorsyd wiff&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 12/1.521 n. k). He died at Cannon Row, Westminster, on 17 February 1557 and was buried nine days later at St Laurence Pountney; but his remains, like those of his father, were later removed to Boreham. By 23 June 1559 his second countess had married Andrew Wyse, formerly vice-treasurer of Ireland, who was then in prison following his dismissal for maladministration in 1554. Her plea for his release may have been heeded, since Wyse returned to Ireland in 1564 as secretary to a commission of inquiry, and they had several children. He had died by 26 January 1568; his widow died between 22 August 1579 and 28 March 1582.<br>
