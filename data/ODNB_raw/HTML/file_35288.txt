<div class="para">
<span class="headword">O'Conor, Sir  Nicholas Roderick</span>  (1843&#150;1908), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, born at Dundermott, Ballymoe, co. Roscommon, on 3 July 1843, was the youngest of three sons of Patrick A. C. O'Conor, of Dundermott, and his wife, Jane, second daughter of Christopher Ffrench, of Frenchlawn, co. Roscommon. He was educated at Stonyhurst College, and afterwards at Munich under J. J. I. von D&ouml;llinger, and entered the diplomatic service in 1866. After some months of employment in the Foreign Office he was appointed attach&eacute; at Berlin, where he attained in 1870 the rank of third secretary. After service at Washington and Madrid he returned to Washington to be second secretary in 1874, and was transferred in 1875 to Brazil, where he was employed on special duty in the province of Rio Grande do Sul in November 1876. In October 1877 he was moved to Paris, where he had the advantage of serving for six years under Lord Lyons.<br>
<br>In December 1883 O'Conor was appointed secretary of legation at Peking (Beijing), and on the death of the minister, Sir Harry Parkes, in March 1885, he assumed charge of the legation for a period of fifteen months. He found himself almost immediately involved in somewhat awkward discussions with the Chinese and Korean governments with regard to the temporary occupation of Port Hamilton, a harbour formed by three islands at the entrance to the Gulf of Pecheli (Beizhili), of which the British admiral had taken possession as a coaling station, following the deterioration of Anglo-Russian relations over Afghanistan. The question was eventually settled, after the alarms about war with Russia had disappeared, by the withdrawal of the British occupation, the Chinese guaranteeing that no part of Korean territory, including Port Hamilton, would be occupied by any foreign power.<br>
<br>The annexation of Upper Burma to the British Indian empire, proclaimed by Lord Dufferin in 1886, gave rise to an equally embarrassing issue. The Chinese government viewed the annexation with great jealousy. The Burmese shared a frontier with China and with the Chinese vassal state of Tibet. China claimed indeterminate and rather obsolete rights of suzerainty over the Burmese, recognized by a decennial Burmese mission to China. After a tedious negotiation O'Conor succeeded in concluding an agreement on 24 July 1886, making provision for the delimitation of the frontier by a joint commission, for a future convention to settle the conditions of frontier trade, and agreeing to the continuance of the decennial Burmese mission, in return for a waiver of any right of interference with British authority and rule. Although this agreement was only the preliminary to a series of negotiations, it paved the way for a friendly solution. On its conclusion O'Conor, who had been made CMG in February 1886, was created CB.<br>
<br>After a brief tenure of the post of secretary of legation at Washington, in January 1887 O'Conor succeeded Frank Lascelles as agent and consul-general in Bulgaria. The principality was at the time in a critical situation. Prince Alexander, whose nerve had been shaken by his abduction, having failed to obtain the tsar's approval of his resumption of power, had abdicated in September 1886, and the government was left in the hands of three regents, of whom the principal was the former prime minister, Stambulov. For the next few months, in the face of manoeuvres on the part of Russia to prolong the interregnum or procure the selection of a nominee who would be a mere vassal of Russia, vigorous attempts were made by the regency to obtain a candidate of greater independence. On 7 July 1887 Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was elected, and Stambulov again became prime minister. O'Conor, who united great shrewdness with a blunt directness of speech which, although not generally regarded as a diplomatic trait, had the effect of inspiring confidence, exercised a steadying influence on the energetic premier. Excellent relations were maintained between them in the course of five years' residence. Among other results was the conclusion in 1889 of a provisional commercial agreement between Great Britain and Bulgaria.<br>
<br>In April 1892 O'Conor was again appointed to Peking, this time in the position of envoy to the emperor of China and to the king of Korea. A notable change in the etiquette towards foreign representatives was made by the court in his reception at Peking; he was formally received with the staff of the legation at the principal entrance by the court officials and conducted to a personal audience with the emperor in the Cheng Kuan Tien (Zhengguandian) Palace. In July 1894 the disputes between China and Japan over the introduction of reforms in the administration of Korea led to open war between the two countries, and O'Conor's responsibilities were heavy. The Chinese forces were routed by land and sea, and in April 1895 the veteran statesman Li Hung-chang (Li Hongzhang) concluded the treaty of Shimonoseki, by which China made substantial concessions to Japan, including the peninsula of Liaotung (Liaodong). O'Conor handled this and subsequent negotiations about Port Arthur in 1895 with considerable skill and was made KCB in May 1895.<br>
<br>In October 1895 O'Conor left China to become ambassador at St Petersburg. The following year he attended the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II. He received the grand cross of St Michael and St George and was sworn of the privy council in the same year. He was as popular at St Petersburg as at his previous posts, but towards the close of his residence British relations with Russia were seriously complicated by the course taken by the Russian government in obtaining from China a lease of Port Arthur and the Liaotung peninsula. The discussions, which at one time became somewhat acute, were carried on by O'Conor with his usual tact; but a dispute arose between him and Count Muravyov, the Russian minister for foreign affairs, as to an assurance which the latter had given but subsequently withdrawn that Port Arthur, as well as Talienwan (Dalianwan), should be completely open to international commerce. This incident, and the manner in which Count Muravyov endeavoured to explain it, made it on the whole fortunate that in July 1898 there was an opportunity for O'Conor to be transferred to Constantinople. He had been promoted GCB in 1897.<br>
<br>The last ten years of O'Conor's life, which were passed in Constantinople, were very laborious. He worked under great difficulties for the policy of administrative reform, which was strenuously pressed whenever possible by the British government. He succeeded, however, in winning to a considerable extent the personal goodwill and confidence of the sultan and of the ministers with whom he had to deal, and by persistent efforts cleared a large number of long outstanding claims and subordinate questions which had been a permanent burden to his predecessors. Among the more important questions which he succeeded in bringing to a settlement were those of the Turco-Egyptian boundary in the Sinai peninsula, and of the British frontier in the hinterland of Aden.<br>
<br>O'Conor had married, on 13 April 1887, Minna, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13741/', "James Robert Hope-Scott")</script> and his second wife, Lady Alexandrina Howard. They had three daughters. O'Conor had succeeded in May 1877 to his brother Patrick's estate of Dundermott, but was never able to live there. His health had never been strong since his residence in China, and in 1904 he returned to Britain for advice, and underwent a serious operation. The strain of work on his return to Turkey was too much for him, and he died at his post in the British embassy, Constantinople, on 19 March 1908. He was buried with every mark of affection and respect in the cemetery at Haydar Pasha, where a monument erected by his widow bears with the date the inscription &#145;Nicolaus Rodericus O'Conor, Britanni&aelig; Regis apud Ottomanorum Imperatorem Legatus, pie obiit&#146;. It was at that time unusual for a Roman Catholic Irishman to be appointed ambassador. O'Conor showed a safe pair of hands in several complex negotiations.<br>
