<span class="headword">Braithwaite, Sir  John Bevan</span>  (1884&#150;1973), <span class="occ">stockbroker</span>, was born on 22 November 1884 at Islington, London, the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46774/', "Joseph Bevan Braithwaite (1855&#150;1934)")</script>, a stockbroker, and his wife, Anna Sophia Gillett. Both parents belonged to long-established and well-connected Quaker families. John was educated at Leighton Park School, Reading, and at Owens College, Manchester (later Manchester University). He then followed his elder brother into the stockbroking firm of Foster and Braithwaite, of which their father was, from 1888 until 1922, the senior partner. He became a member of the stock exchange in 1907, and in the following year he was made a partner in the firm.<br>
<br>Braithwaite married in 1908 Martha Janette Baker (<i>d</i>. 1972), the daughter of Joseph Allen Baker (1852&#150;1918), an engineer, a member of the London county council from 1895 to 1906, and Liberal MP for Eastern Finsbury from 1905 until his death. The couple had two sons and a daughter, and lived for most of their married life in Hampstead Garden Suburb.<br>
<br>Soon after Braithwaite became a partner in Foster and Braithwaite, it became apparent that the firm was facing severe financial problems. Losses had been made as a result of the firm's activities in company promotion and in trading on the stock exchange on its own account. Deeply shocked by these discoveries, Braithwaite told his father that he considered such activities to be &#145;nothing less than dangerous gambling&#146; and inappropriate for a &#145;strong ancient &amp; honoured &amp; impregnable City House&#146;  (Reader, <span class="italic">A House in the City</span>, 126&#150;7). They had brought the firm, he said, close to &#145;the possibility of failure. &hellip; it has been before my mind like a nightmare day &amp; night more or less continually&#146;  (ibid., 127). The remedy he advocated was &#145;hard work &amp; self-denial&#146;  (ibid., 131), which in the event contributed to the salvation of Foster and Braithwaite and provided Braithwaite with his own guideline through life.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Braithwaite served with the Friends' Ambulance Unit. Afterwards he returned to the firm, where, in the 1920s, the new direction in which its policy took it, eschewing speculation, met with the approval of his &#145;somewhat austere cast of mind&#146;  (Reader, <span class="italic">A House in the City</span>, 133). In the inter-war years he began to take a greater interest and participate in the affairs of the stock exchange. In 1937 he was elected to its governing body, the committee for general purposes.<br>
<br>Braithwaite's view of the role and function of the stock exchange, shaped by his formative experiences with Foster and Braithwaite, gained wider support, particularly after the Second World War. He considered that the stock exchange could not continue to act as a private club but that it had a public duty, and therefore should be publicly accountable. When the new council of the stock exchange was formed in 1949, Braithwaite was elected as its chairman, a post he held for ten years. During that time it was largely due to him that the visitors' gallery was opened, that the stock exchange employed an advertising agency, and that, in 1950, a compensation fund for members' clients was established. In all of these he faced considerable opposition, but his powerful personality won the day. He was knighted in 1953.<br>
<br>Sir John continued to press for wider shareholding among the public. Not untypical of his views was a speech he made in 1956: &#145;If only some of the hundreds of millions that are poured down the drain each year on betting on horses, dogs and football could be attracted into investment in British industry, what a fine start could be made&#146;  (Reader, <span class="italic">A House in the City</span>, 173).<br>
<br>Braithwaite was a director of the London Electric Lighting Company (the firm with which his father had had a long connection) from 1934 to 1948, and its chairman from 1943 to 1948. He was a governor of the London School of Economics from 1953 to 1964. Although his influence had long been paramount at Foster and Braithwaite, he did not become its senior partner in name until 1963. He held the office until he retired in 1971. Braithwaite's retirement, and the time to indulge more fully his lifetime interests in literature, music, and photography, was short. He died at his home, 85 Hampstead Way, Hampstead Garden Suburb, London, on 5 April 1973.<br>
