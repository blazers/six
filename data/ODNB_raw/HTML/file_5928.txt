<span class="headword">Collingridge,  Peter</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Bernardine]</span>  (1757&#150;1829), <span class="occ">vicar apostolic of the western district</span>, was born on 10 March 1757 at Fritwell, Oxfordshire, the son of Peter Collingridge and his wife, Mary. He may have received his early education in England. What is certain is that he entered the Franciscan friary of St Bonaventure, Douai, where he received the habit on 26 June 1773. Record of his ordination was probably destroyed by the revolutionaries, although it is known that he was lecturing in both philosophy and theology even before he was ordained. In 1788 he was elected guardian of the friary.<br>
<br>After some twenty years in Douai, Collingridge returned to England to work at St George's Fields, Southwark. After a short spell in Coventry he was appointed to the Sardinian embassy chapel, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London. On 2 January 1807 he was named titular bishop of Thespiae and coadjutor to Bishop G. W. Sharrock, vicar apostolic of the western district, but his consecration did not take place until 11 October. Bishop Poynter performed the ceremony at St Edmund's College, Ware. Collingridge succeeded Sharrock on 17 October 1809 and moved the episcopal residence from Bath to the Benedictine convent at Cannington, near Taunton.<br>
<br>Emancipation was the major issue which divided the Catholic community and its leaders. The matter was urgent, and Collingridge felt that &#145;by not accepting even an imperfect emancipation, numbers of non-Catholics were being prevented from entering the Church&#146;  (Dockery, 89). Although a regular himself who had already welcomed the Benedictines to Downside, near Bath, and who had been the first of the vicars apostolic to allow the Jesuits to resume their work after their reinstatement in 1814, Collingridge was nevertheless said to be &#145;prepared to accept legislation for Emancipation which, as a condition, would have sacrificed the regular clergy&#146;  (Norman, 82). Popular suspicions were based on the perception that, unlike the seculars, their endeavours were under the direction of superiors who lived abroad. Collingridge aligned himself with Bishop W. Poynter of the London district against Bishop John Milner (midland district) in being prepared to accept the guarantees then on offer from the government. However, he was not prepared to accept emancipation at any price.<br>
<br>Bishop Collingridge was given the help of a coadjutor in 1823. Peter Augustine Baines, a former Benedictine and now titular bishop of Siga, was of an entirely different mould, whose ambition it was to put the Catholic community in the region &#145;on the map&#146; and to provide a supply of secular clergy for the growing industrial areas of the vicariate. Because he judged the religious orders to be ill-equipped for such a task, he approached Downside with a view to turning it into a seminary for seculars. In this serious error of judgement Collingridge acquiesced, and therefore some of the ensuing acrimony must be laid at his door.<br>
<br>Collingridge was a devout, forgiving man. Franciscan simplicity remained his way of life, even as far as begging hay for his horse. Such traits endeared him to his impoverished flock of some 5500 souls scattered throughout Wales and the west country. (At that time the chief centres of Catholic population were at Bristol, Bath, and Plymouth, with a strong enclave in and around the estate of Lord Arundell at Wardour in Wiltshire.)<br>
<br>Collingridge died on 3 March 1829 at the Benedictine convent at Cannington, Somerset, where he had lived, and was buried in the bishop's garden there. When the body was exhumed in 1914 prior to its reinterment at Downside, the curious formation of his skull as shown in a contemporary drawing was confirmed. The simplicity of his tomb in the north choir of the abbey church is in sharp contrast to the adjacent, more ornate, monument to his successor.<br>
