<span class="headword">Loving,  Henry</span>  (1790&#150;1850), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor in the West Indies</span>, was born a slave on Antigua and manumitted at the age of nine. He was probably the son of a white slave owner and a black slave. The rest of his early life is obscure, and he first came to prominence in 1814 when he founded the <span class="italic">Weekly Register</span> newspaper. The <span class="italic">Register</span> was one of the first newspapers in the British West Indies run by free coloureds, but as Loving later admitted it was for many years reluctant to discuss political matters in any real depth. This seems to have been due to the influence of Loving's partner, William Hill, a trained printer, who when asked to join the paper in 1815 evidently assumed responsibility for editorial decisions. He proceeded cautiously, probably anxious to avoid alienating the white oligarchy which controlled the colony.<br>
<br>After Hill's death in July 1827 the way was open for Loving to change the whole tenor of the paper. The time and circumstances were certainly propitious for such a move; the slave question was preoccupying the British government and by 1830 Antigua's other newspaper, the <span class="italic">Free Press</span>, was starting to argue for immediate abolition. Loving perhaps directed more energy to securing his political and civil rights as a free coloured, but he never neglected the plight of the slaves, and he seems to have possessed considerable influence over them. Although he had no direct connection with the plantation economy, he owned at least one domestic slave himself. He was married, with at least eight children, but the name of his wife is unknown.<br>
<br>In tightly controlled and racially stratified societies like Antigua, radicalism of this kind was fraught with danger. Dubbed a &#145;compound of mustard and malevolence&#146; by the pro-planter journalist James MacQueen, Loving suffered attacks which went beyond mere verbal abuse. In October 1828 the <span class="italic">Register</span>'s contract to print government notices was cancelled and a year later its editor was charged with libelling the whole community of Antigua. Loving conducted his own defence and eloquently exposed the absurdity of the charge, but his acquittal did not mark the end of his troubles. In May 1831 he was attacked and horsewhipped by a white man claiming that Loving had traduced the memory of his recently deceased brother in the <span class="italic">Register</span>. Loving pressed charges against his assailant, and the affair resulted in several serious disturbances which highlighted the island's acute racial divisions.<br>
<br>Shortly after this incident Loving travelled to England as the official representative of the Antigua free coloured corresponding committee, a group lobbying to gain full political and civil rights. While in England he addressed anti-slavery meetings and entered into a correspondence on the slave question with the under-secretary of state for the colonies, Lord Howick. Loving published this correspondence as a pamphlet, somewhat disingenuously claiming that he had been in direct contact with the secretary of state, Viscount Goderich. He also gave impressive testimony before the government select committee on the extinction of slavery throughout the British empire.<br>
<br>Loving returned to Antigua in June 1832, having been instrumental in obtaining the concession of civil rights to Antiguan free coloureds. He resumed the editorship of the <span class="italic">Register</span> but for less than a year; in May 1833 he announced his retirement from both the newspaper and from journalism. The battles he had been involved in may have taken a personal toll and comments he made later indicated a deep disillusionment with politics. He briefly ran a general store in St John's but in July 1834 the governor of the Leewards, Sir Evan Murray-MacGregor, appointed him superintendent of the Antigua police. Again controversy dogged him as the decision provoked an outcry from white people who were appalled at the prospect of a coloured man occupying such an important position. By March 1836 he was acting private secretary to Murray-MacGregor and in July of the following year was appointed as a stipendiary magistrate in Barbados, charged with ensuring the smooth working of the apprenticeship system. In March 1838 he took up the post of secretary and clerk to the crown on Montserrat, despite Murray-MacGregor's caution about accepting the post. The move proved a mistake; not only was his salary cut drastically but at one point he went for two years without receiving any pay at all. He attempted to solicit promotion from the Colonial Office but failed and eventually returned to Antigua. For two years before this he had suffered a debilitating illness, which robbed him of his mental powers. He probably died at St John's, Antigua, in 1850.<br>
