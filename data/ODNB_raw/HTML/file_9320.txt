</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ferguson,  James</span>  (1710&#150;1776), <span class="occ">lecturer on natural philosophy and inventor of scientific instruments</span>, was born on 25 April 1710 at Core of Mayen, Rothiemay, Banffshire, the second of at least six children of John Ferguson, a farmworker renting a smallholding, and his wife, Elspeth Lobban. Ferguson learned to read by listening to his father teach his elder brother the catechism. His father was &#145;agreeably surprised&#146;  (Henderson, 7), and taught him to write. Later he spent three months at Keith grammar school.<br>
<br>Ferguson's interest in mechanics began at about the age of seven or eight, when he saw his father use a lever to raise the decayed roof of their cottage. He worked out and wrote an account of the principle of mechanical advantage, and subsequently learned that his discovery was correct, though not original. This encouraged his quest for scientific knowledge. Working as a shepherd, he studied the stars at night and during the day made models of mills and spinning wheels. Aged about fourteen, he worked for a local farmer, James Glashan, who encouraged his interest in the stars. Ferguson charted the stars' apparent positions by holding a taut thread at arm's length and moving beads along until they obscured particular stars, and then laid the thread on paper and marked their positions. He learned that the world was round, and his employer showed him a map and gave him the time and implements to copy it. A local gentleman, Thomas Grant, was impressed, and offered Ferguson a position in his household where he could be taught by Alexander Cantley, the butler, a self-taught polymath. Unfortunately Cantley left, and Ferguson returned home. There he made a globe, the first he had ever seen, from a description in a book given to him by Cantley. Thereafter he followed various employments, educating himself wherever possible. He constructed his first clock out of wood, and made a watch using whalebone as the spring.<br>
<br>Aged about twenty-three, Ferguson worked for Sir James Dunbar of Durn and maintained his clocks. He painted two spheres on the gateway as terrestrial and celestial globes, with their poles pointed towards the celestial pole so that they could be used as sundials and indicate which parts of the earth were in daylight. He showed skill in copying some of Sir James's paintings, and William Baird, a relation of Sir James, invited him to use his library and taught him to paint with Indian ink. Ferguson's first portrait was a miniature of Baird (1733). Still in his early twenties, Ferguson then went to Edinburgh with Sir James's sister, Lady Dipple, for whom he had drawn embroidery patterns, to seek an apprenticeship with a professional artist in oils. He found that it would be too long and expensive to complete, so started to earn his living by limning, painting portraits in Indian ink.<br>
<br>After about two years Ferguson &#145;took a violent inclination to study anatomy, surgery and physic&#146;  (Henderson, 37). He went home intending to practise as a doctor, but often was not paid. About two years later he returned to limning, and on 31 May 1739 he married Isabella Wilson (1719&#150;1773). His interest in astronomy revived and he invented a cardboard instrument for showing the motions and positions of the sun and moon, including, after tedious calculation, the dates when the moon's path crossed the earth's orbital plane and hence the dates of solar and lunar eclipses. He called his instrument the astronomical rotula and sent a description to Professor Colin Maclaurin, who suggested a slight correction and volunteered to organize a subscription to enable it to be engraved and published. Maclaurin showed him an orrery, a working model of the earth&#150;moon system's orbit around the sun. Without seeing its mechanism Ferguson constructed his own model, and Maclaurin asked him to demonstrate and lecture on this to his students. This was the first of Ferguson's many lectures for which he was to become famous.<br>
<br>In May 1743 Ferguson went to London intending to become a mathematics teacher. When he revealed to his patron, the Rt Hon. Stephen Poyntz, that he was married and could not afford an apprenticeship, Poyntz commissioned miniatures of his own family so that he could recommend Ferguson as a limner. Thus he found as much work as he could manage. His thoughts returned to celestial mechanics, and he concluded that the moon's path is always concave to the sun. He devised a machine, which he called the <i>trajectorium lunare</i>, to show this, and demonstrated it to the Royal Society on 26 April 1744. He used his demonstration models at his advertised lectures at his lodgings, and his scientific reputation grew.<br>
<br>Ferguson's first published book was <span class="italic">The Use of a New Orrery, Made and Described by James Ferguson</span> (1746). Minor works followed. He continued to paint miniatures and design instruments, and he lectured widely throughout the country on natural philosophy. In October 1755 he bought copperplates and moulds for globes from John Senex, and established a business in the Strand. His first major book, <span class="italic">Astronomy Explained upon Sir Isaac Newton's Principles and Made Easy for Those Who Have Not Studied Mathematics</span> (1756), met with immediate success. The title epitomized his approach: in the preface to <span class="italic">Lectures on Select Subjects</span> (1760) he wrote &#145;I had a view &hellip; to avoid all superfluity, and to render everything as plain and intelligible as I thought the subject would admit of&#146;.<br>
<br>He sold his business to Benjamin Martin in 1757 and returned to writing and lecturing, and incorporated the various current astronomical events into his lectures. In 1761 George III granted him an annual pension of &pound;50.<br>
<br>In early 1763 Ferguson applied unsuccessfully to become clerk to the Royal Society, but later that year he was elected a fellow, with the remarkable exemption that on account of his singular merit and circumstances he should be excused the usual admission fee and the annual contribution of &pound;2 12<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. On 1 April 1764, from Liverpool, he observed the eclipse of the sun. To the Royal Society he described &#145;little tremulous bright specks&#146;  (&#145;Observations on the eclipse of the sun&#146;, <span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 54, 1764, 112), which he conjectured were due to valleys in the limb of the moon. This anticipated the identification of Baily's beads in 1836.<br>
<br>Ferguson's later works included <span class="italic">Tables and Tracts</span> (1767), <span class="italic">The Young Gentleman and Lady's Astronomy</span> (1768), <span class="italic">An Introduction to Electricity</span> (1770), and <span class="italic">Select Mechanical Exercises</span> (1773). His last major book was <span class="italic">The Art of Drawing in Perspective</span> (1775). His understanding of mathematics was rudimentary. A contemporary wrote &#145;He often told me that he could never demonstrate one proposition in <span class="italic">Euclid's Elements</span>; his constant method being to satisfy himself, as to the truth &hellip; with a measurement by scale and compasses&#146;  (Hutton, 1.509). His ability to simplify the apparently complex, combined with his remarkable skills as a draughtsman, made his books commercially viable until the middle of the nineteenth century. His works were so authoritative that several were used as sources for the first edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> (1771).<br>
<br>Although Ferguson was never a commercial clockmaker he designed, among others, a &#145;three-wheeled&#146; clock. This was a modification of Benjamin Franklin's own clock. Ferguson wrote of Franklin as someone &#145;whom I rejoice to call my friend&#146;  (Millburn, 193). Boswell records Ferguson as &#145;The self taught Philosopher&#146; when he and Dr Johnson met him in 1769  (ibid., 234); in 1776 they became neighbours in Bolt Court. Ferguson was described about 1774 as having &#145;a very sedate appearance, face and brow a little wrinkled; he wore a large full stuff wig, which gave him a venerable look, and made him appear older than he really was&#146;  (Henderson, 463).<br>
<br>Ferguson was said to be &#145;unhappy in his family connections&#146;  (Henderson, 462), and he legally separated from Isabella on 23 January 1773. Their first child, Agnes (<i>b</i>. 1745), was as a young woman described by a contemporary, John Nichols, as having &#145;elegance of her person &hellip; and &hellip; philosophical knowledge worthy of such a father&#146;  (Millburn, 153). She mysteriously disappeared when nearly eighteen. Spurious reports that she had run away with a nobleman and died in agony appeared in many publications, but these were never substantiated. Ferguson had three further children. His eldest son, James (<i>b</i>. 1748), was apprenticed to a scientific instrument maker, and Ferguson kept the wheelworks of his orreries secret for his benefit; unfortunately he died aged twenty-five. His other two sons, Murdoch (<i>b</i>. 1752) and John (<i>b</i>. 1759), received medical educations. Murdoch broke his first apprenticeship but eventually qualified as an army surgeon. John never completed his studies because his father's death left him with sufficient means so as not to have to work.<br>
<br>During his life Ferguson sent thousands of pounds to an Edinburgh lawyer, John Mackenzie, to be confidentially invested. This money probably came from thrift rather than a legacy as often claimed. On his death on 16 November 1776, at his home, 4 Bolt Court, Fleet Street, London, of &#145;gravel and other ailments&#146;  (Henderson, 448), many were surprised at the size of his estate. Contemporary reports put this at the then considerable sum of &pound;6000  (Millburn, 253). He was buried on 23 November, near his wife and son James, in the old Marylebone churchyard, Marylebone High Street, Westminster.<br>
