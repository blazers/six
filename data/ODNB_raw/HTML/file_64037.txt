<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bentine <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Bentin]</span>,  Michael</span>  (1922&#150;1996), <span class="occ">comedian</span>, was born on 26 January 1922, in Watford, Hertfordshire, the second of two sons of Adan (later Adam) Bentin, aeronautical engineer, and his wife, Florence (<i>d</i>. 1949), daughter of James Dawkins, a Southend Water Board official. His paternal grandfather was Don Antonio Bentin Palamerra, vice-president of Peru for eight years and president-elect on his death. He added the final &#145;e&#146; to his name when he went into show business after the war. When he was a child a botched tonsillectomy left him with a profound stammer that was not cured until he was sixteen and a schoolboy at Eton College. In the Second World War he was at first turned down by the RAF, despite repeated applications, because of his father's Peruvian nationality. He was playing Lorenzo in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> at the Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park, when he was arrested as a deserter; the RAF had accepted him at last but had failed to inform him. He was, he said later, &#145;the first British serviceman to be arrested in doublet and hose for 400 years&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 28 Nov 1996). He wanted to fly, but inoculation with a faulty serum nearly cost him his life and left him with poor eyesight. He spent the war as an intelligence officer and was deeply distressed when, as he saw it, the psychic gifts he had inherited from his father gave him hideous foreknowledge of those who would be killed as he briefed air crew on their missions; he saw their heads as skulls.<br>
<br>Part of Bentine's work as an intelligence officer with the RAF was to organize forward airfields as the allies advanced through France and into Germany. As such, he was one of the first British officers to enter Belsen. This affected him deeply. The Nazis, he concluded, were &#145;pure evil&#146;. After the war he had a minor breakdown and was unable to stop weeping for a time. Bentine left the RAF a junior officer, but more than fifty years later his memorial service in the actors' church, St Paul's, Covent Garden, was attended by three air marshals, and he was roared to his rest by the RAF red arrows aerobatics team streaming coloured smoke as they flew in formation over central London. He had helped to raise millions of pounds for the RAF Benevolent Fund.<br>
<br>After the war Bentine and his friend Tony Sherwood&#151;they called themselves Sherwood and Forrest&#151;played the Windmill Theatre, London, a temporary refuge for budding former service comedians. Sherwood left, and Bentine and his brother Philip were fooling around with a broken chair at home; Philip pretended it was a machine-gun and within minutes they had found a hundred uses for it. It became the basis of black-bearded Bentine's surreal solo act. Later, it gave him a star spot in the West End show, <span class="italic">Starlight Roof</span>. A plunger on his wild black hair enabled him to impersonate a trolley-bus, among other things. This led to four years' work in the West End, with an appearance at a royal command performance, and seasons at the London Palladium and in the London production of the <span class="italic">Folies Berg&egrave;re</span>.<br>
<br>Bentine was one of the founder members of <span class="italic">Crazy People</span> (later to become <span class="italic">The Goon Show</span>) on radio in 1951 [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95276', "Goons")</script>]. It was a show peopled by surrealist characters, and it quickly acquired a massive cult following and exercised enormous influence on subsequent radio and television comedy. Bentine played Osric Pureheart, inventor of the permanently submergible submarine and other unique artefacts. He pulled out of <span class="italic">The Goon Show</span> after two series (forty-three shows), because, he said, its original conception had changed. Bentine then made <span class="italic">The Bumblies</span>, a show that appealed both to children and to adults, for the BBC, and he later made other children's shows, including <span class="italic">Potty Time</span> and <span class="italic">Madabout</span>, for BBC television. After working in America and Australia for two and a half years he returned to Britain to launch a series of brilliant comic fantasies on television with <span class="italic">It's a Square World</span>, which ran from 1960 to 1964, and won the grand prix de la presse at Montreux in 1963 (the first BBC show to win an award at the Swiss television festival). In one episode he hired a Chinese junk, dressed his actors as a Chinese crew, and bombarded the houses of parliament with plastic cannon balls until parliament appeared to sink. &#145;Do any of you gentlemen speak English?&#146;, enquired an officer from a river police launch. At other times he fired the BBC television centre into space, raided it with whooping &#145;Red Indians&#146;, and pretended to torpedo it. After scorching a brick he was sent a memorandum by a BBC executive that said: &#145;Under no circumstances is the BBC Television Centre to be used for the purposes of entertainment&#146;. His effect on BBC staff can be measured by an incident about eighteen months after he had shot the last <span class="italic">Square World</span> episode. A gang wielding baseball bats and wearing balaclavas raided the BBC's pay office. As they made their getaway, preparing to batter their way through the barrier, one of the BBC guards opened it, gave them a cheery wave and shouted, &#145;When will it be on, Mr Bentine?&#146;<br>
<br>Bentine was a gifted restorer of Victorian paintings, a collector of jade, an amateur astronomer, and an expert on&#151;and with&#151;all kinds of weaponry, from sabres to sub-machine guns, though after the war he determined he would never shoot another living creature. In 1998, <span class="italic">Ghost Force</span>, Ken Connor's &#145;secret history of the SAS&#146;, disclosed that in the mid-1960s, Bentine, by then a combat firearms instructor on special consultation to the armed forces and the police, was invited to a shooting demonstration at Paddington Green police station. Connor described how he drew a .44 Magnum with a 12-inch barrel and began rapid fire. &#145;When the smoke cleared&#146;, Connor wrote, &#145;every single target had been blasted apart&#146;. The author went on to say that, &#145;As much as anyone, he deserves the credit for promoting the idea of a counter-terrorist force within the SAS&#146;  (Connor, 204&#150;5).<br>
<br>Bentine pioneered the use of hovercraft to open up areas of Peru that were unreachable even by waterways, and was made a comandador del merito for that and his work in organizing relief after Peru's devastating floods in 1970; he was appointed CBE by the queen in 1995. He represented Prince Charles at Peter Sellers's funeral. He wrote no fewer than three autobiographies: <span class="italic">The Long Banana Skin</span> (1975), <span class="italic">The Door Marked Summer</span> (1981), and <span class="italic">The Reluctant Jester</span> (1992). He also wrote five novels, four books describing his psychic experiences, and five children's books. Bentine was a compendium of seemingly contradictory ideas and decidedly odd notions, of recondite knowledge and technical skills. He had the insatiable curiosity and meticulous grasp of detail of a good research scientist and engineer; he also possessed an awareness of human folly that made him burn with anger at its cruelties and shake with laughter at its absurdities. It was this that put him at the cutting edge of radio and television comedy for more than two generations.<br>
<br>Bentine's first marriage, to Marie Barradell on 9 August 1941, ended in divorce on 20 January 1947. His second wife, Clementina Theresa Gadesden Stuart-McCall, was a ballet dancer. They married on 14 February 1948. Two daughters, Elaine, sole child of his first marriage, and Marylla, elder daughter of his second marriage, both died of cancer in the 1980s. His eldest son, Stuart, was killed in a light-aircraft crash in 1972. Bentine himself died from prostate cancer on 26 November 1996, in Walton on the Hill, Tadworth, Surrey. He was cremated at Leatherhead, Surrey. He was survived by his wife, Clementina, his son Richard, and his daughter Serena.<br>
