<span class="headword">Woodward,  Herbert Hall</span>  (1847&#150;1909), <span class="occ">composer and clergyman</span>, was born on 13 January 1847 at The Friars, near Liverpool, the fifth and youngest son of Robert Woodward (1801&#150;1882) and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1891), the youngest daughter of William Hall, of Ryall's Court, Ripple, Worcestershire. His father, a Liverpool merchant, purchased the Arley Castle estate, near Bewdley, in 1852. Both his parents' families had long been settled in Worcestershire. After attending Radley College, Woodward matriculated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in 1862. At Radley he studied music under Dr E. G. Monk and at Oxford under the Revd Dr Leighton Hayne; he graduated BMus in 1866 and BA in 1867. He then spent eighteen months at Cuddesdon Theological College, and, being ordained deacon in 1870 and priest in 1871 in the diocese of Oxford, became curate and precentor of Wantage. There he remained for eleven years, working as assistant priest under William John Butler, afterwards dean of Lincoln. He composed his communion service in E[flat], which appeared in many editions, for the church choir at Wantage.<br>
<br>In 1881 Woodward was appointed a minor canon of Worcester Cathedral, and in 1890 he became precentor, succeeding the Revd E. V. Hall. In the autumn of 1881 he composed the anthem &#145;The radiant morn&#146;, which first appeared in the <span class="italic">Musical Times</span> in June 1882 (pp. 329&#150;33), and became &#145;one of the best-known modern anthems in English church music&#146;  (<span class="italic">MT</span>, 46, 1905, 724). He formed at Worcester a successful preparatory boarding-school for the choirboys, of which he was warden for twenty-eight years, from 1881 until his death. He had a great influence on the services at the cathedral, and raised the standard of worship to a high level. Other works he published include communion services in D (1885) and A (1897), and numerous anthems including &#145;The sun shall be no more thy light by day&#146; (1887), &#145;Rejoice greatly&#146; (1889), &#145;Behold, the days come, saith the Lord&#146; (1895), &#145;The day thou gavest, Lord, is ended&#146; (1896), and &#145;Comes, at times, a stillness as of even&#146; (1908). A bachelor with private means, he was widely known for his generous philanthropy. He resided at College Yard, Worcester, but died at 45 Devonshire Street, Portland Place, London, after an operation, on 25 May 1909. He was commemorated at Worcester by the Woodward memorial wing of the choir-school buildings.<br>
