<span class="headword">Postlethwayt,  John</span>  (1650&#150;1713), <span class="occ">headmaster and orientalist</span>, was born on 8 October 1650, the fourth son of Matthew Postlethwayt (<i>d</i>. 1682) and his wife, Margaret Hunton. The family had long been settled at Bankside in Millom, Cumberland. After attending the neighbouring school of Whicham, John went to Merton College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 7 April 1671, graduating BA on 19 January 1675 and proceeding MA in 1678. When in 1688 the future Archbishop Tenison established the school later known by his name (and originally in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, of which he was then rector) Postlethwayt was appointed the first master. On 3 September 1697 Postlethwayt was appointed high master of St Paul's, in succession to Thomas Gale, having received testimonials from, among others, John Evelyn, Richard Bentley, and William Wake, as well as Tenison himself, who commended his learning, adding that his scholars were &#145;in awe of him &hellip; but he doth not terrify them&#146;  (Stow, 1.168).<br>
<br>Postlethwayt was renowned as an orientalist, introducing Arabic in addition to Hebrew at St Paul's. He helped to secure William III's patronage for the foundation of the lord almoner's lectureships in Arabic at Oxford and Cambridge, and two of his pupils (John Wallis and Benjamin Marshall) were the students first supported by this benefaction in 1699. His health failed in the last year of his life, but he continued to teach from his sickroom.<br>
<br>Postlethwayt died unmarried at St Paul's School on 26 September 1713, and was buried in St Augustine, Watling Street, London, on 30 September. In his funeral sermon John Hancock, rector of St Margaret, Lothbury, recalled Postlethwayt's skill in the learned languages and his delight in &#145;ingenious conversation&#146;  (Wilford, 511). By his will, dated 5 September 1713, he bequeathed the advowson of Denton rectory, Norfolk (which he had bought from the duke of Norfolk), to Merton College; he also left &pound;200 for the repair of the chancel at Denton, and a similar sum to augment the vicarage of his native Millom.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_22600"></a><span class="headword">Matthew Postlethwayt</span>  (1679&#150;1745), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was eldest son of George Postlethwayt (1639&#150;1710) (elder brother of the preceding) and his wife, Elizabeth. He was at St Paul's School under his uncle, proceeding to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he matriculated on 3 April 1699, and on 23 June was admitted scholar on Spencer's foundation. On 28 December 1702 he migrated to St John's, graduating BA from that college in 1703 and proceeding MA in 1706.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Postlethwayt had become curate of Whicham, Cumberland, in 1703, and of Needham, Norfolk, in 1704. In the latter year he married Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Rogerson, rector of Denton. On 22 December 1706 he was ordained priest in the diocese of Norwich. In 1708 he became vicar of Shottesham, Norfolk, and in 1714 succeeded his father-in-law in the rectory of Denton, on the presentation of a family friend, Robert Herne, according to the will of Postlethwayt's uncle, John. Thereafter John Postlethwayt left the perpetual advowson to the archbishops of Canterbury, who were to judge fellows or former fellows of Merton College  (CCC Cam., MS 587, fol. 326A<i>r</i>). In 1718 he rebuilt the rectory and, in execution of his uncle's other legacy, restored the chancel. During this period Postlethwayt published two sermons, <span class="italic">The Necessity of Understanding the Grounds and Principles of Religion</span> (1715) and <span class="italic">The moral impossibility of protestant subjects preserving their religious or civil liberties under popish princes</span> (1719).<br>
<br>In 1730 Elizabeth Postlethwayt died, leaving three children, John, Barbara, and Elizabeth. In the following year Postlethwayt married her cousin Matilda Gooch. On 13 July 1742 Matilda's brother Sir Thomas Gooch, bishop of Norwich, collated his brother-in-law to the archdeaconry of Norwich (which he resigned by 11 October 1744) and later in the same year to the rectory of Redenhall cum Harlston, Norfolk. Postlethwayt died at Denton rectory on 27 June 1745 and was buried at Denton; the inscription on his monument was written by his son-in-law Thomas Kerrich. His wife survived him until 1760.<br>
