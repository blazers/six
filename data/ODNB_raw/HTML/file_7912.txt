<span class="headword">Douglas,  Niel</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Britannicus]</span>  (1750&#150;1823), <span class="occ">poet and minister of the Relief church</span>, was educated at the University of Glasgow, and married Mary Anne Isabella Millar on 26 August 1787. As minister of the Relief church at Cupar, Fife, he published <span class="italic">Sermons on Important Subjects, with some Essays in Poetry</span> in 1789. Among the poems are two extremely loyal odes on the king's illness and recovery, to which their author referred nearly thirty years later when charged with disaffection to the royal family. Under the pseudonym of Britannicus, Douglas next published <span class="italic">A Monitory Address to Great Britain</span> in 1792, lamenting the degeneracy of the times and calling upon the king to abolish the anti-Christian practices of the slave trade, duelling, and church patronage. That same year he published <span class="italic">The African Slave Trade</span>, and the year after, <span class="italic">Thoughts on Modern Politics</span>, also concerned with the slave trade.<br>
<br>By 1793 Douglas had moved to Dundee, where he officiated as a minister of relief charge at Dudhope Crescent. The following year he brought out <span class="italic">The Lady's Scull</span>, a sermon in verse upon the text &#145;A place called the place of a skull&#146;. Another collection of sermons, <span class="italic">Britain's Guilt, Danger, and Duty</span>, appeared in 1795, and <span class="italic">Dialogues on the Lord's Supper</span> and <span class="italic">The Duty of Pastors</span> in 1796.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1797 Douglas, who was fluent in Gaelic, went on a mission to remote regions of Argyll, after first collecting some funds by preaching at Dundee and Glasgow <span class="italic">Messiah's Glorious Rest in the Latter Days</span>, published that year. On his return he described his experiences in a series of letters published as <span class="italic">A Journal of a Mission to Part of the Highlands of Scotland</span> in 1799. At this time he issued proposals for publishing the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> and <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in Gaelic, but abandoned the project through lack of encouragement. After resigning his charge at Dundee, Douglas moved in 1798 to Edinburgh, where he published <span class="italic">Lavinia</span>, based on the book of <span class="roman">Ruth</span>. He moved afterwards to Greenock, where he published <span class="italic">Leonidas</span> and <span class="italic">Sign of the Times</span> in 1805. That year Douglas settled in Stockwell Street, Glasgow, and in 1807 he published <span class="italic">The Messiah's Proper Deity</span>. About 1809 he seceded from the Relief church to set up on his own account as a &#145;preacher of restoration&#146;, or &#145;universalist preacher&#146;. As such he published <span class="italic">The Royal Penitent</span> in 1811, on the repentance of King David, then <span class="italic">King David's Psalms</span> in 1815. His sermons advocated peaceful political reform, and he was a delegate to the Convention of the Friends of the People in Edinburgh.<br>
<br>In 1817, while promulgating his restoration views in Glasgow, Douglas was indicted for sedition in drawing a parallel between George III and Nebuchadnezzar, the prince regent and Belshazzar, and representing the House of Commons as a den of thieves. He appeared before the high court of justiciary, Edinburgh, on 26 May, aged sixty-seven and, in his own words, &#145;loaded with infirmities&#146;. Cockburn, one of his four advocates, after referring to him as &#145;a poor, old, deaf, obstinate, doited body&#146;, says:<blockquote>The crown witnesses all gave their evidence in a way that showed they had smelt sedition because they were sent by their superiors to find it. The trial had scarcely begun before it became ridiculous, from the imputations thrown on the regent&#151;and the difficulty with which people refrained from laughing at the prosecutors, who were visibly ashamed of the scandal they had brought on their own master. (manuscript note on flyleaf of J. Dow, ed., <span class="italic">The Trial of the Rev. Niel Douglas</span>, BL)</blockquote>A unanimous verdict of acquittal was returned, and Douglas left the court loyally declaring, &#145;I have a high regard for his Majesty and for the Royal Family, and I pray that every Briton may have the same&#146;  (Dow, 50). He had prepared for the worst, as he published soon after the trial <span class="italic">An Address to the Judges and Jury in a Case of Alleged Sedition</span>, which was intended to be delivered before sentence was passed.<br>
<br>Douglas was not perceived as belonging to the Scottish establishment, and was described as a &#145;wavering nonconformist&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 3rd ser., 1, 1862, 92). <span class="italic">A Catechism with Proofs</span>, published in 1822, gives a statement of the religious views of Douglas and his church. &#145;The analogy&#146;, attributed to him, is found in <span class="italic">A Collection of Hymns</span> for universalists (1824). He also wrote numerous tracts, such as &#145;Causes of our public calamity&#146;, &#145;The Baptist&#146;, &#145;A word in season&#146;, and others.<br>
<br>Douglas died at Glasgow on 9 January 1823, aged seventy-three. His wife had died before him, and his only surviving son, Neil Douglas, was a constant source of trouble to him and narrowly escaped hanging (see his trial for &#145;falsehood, fraud, and wilful imposition&#146;, 12 July 1816, in the <span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span>, 78.552&#150;3).<br>
