<span class="headword">Percy,  Algernon</span>, tenth earl of Northumberland  (1602&#150;1668), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 29 September 1602 at Essex House, London, and baptized on 13 October at St Clement Danes in the City, the third but eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21939/', "Henry Percy, ninth earl of Northumberland (1564&#150;1632)")</script>, and Lady Dorothy Perrott (<i>d</i>. 1619), widow of Sir Thomas Perrott, and daughter of Walter Devereux, first earl of Essex. His parents married in 1594 and later quarrelled over the ninth earl's belief that his wife had not honoured the marriage contract. Moreover, the Devereux connection turned sour when Dorothy's brother Robert, the second earl of Essex, far from becoming an asset to the family, became a serious liability owing to his disobedience and later rebellion against Elizabeth I. The couple were eventually reconciled and Algernon had two sisters, Dorothy (1598&#150;1659), who married Robert Sidney, second earl of Leicester, and Lucy, later countess of Carlisle (1599&#150;1660) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12733/', "Hay, Lucy")</script>], and a brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21940/', "Henry Percy, Baron Percy of Alnwick (c.1604&#150;1659)")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducation"></a>Early years and education</h2>The ninth earl, a domineering father, controlled the education of Algernon even while imprisoned in the Tower of London from 1605 to 1621 for suspected complicity in the Gunpowder Plot. Algernon, who was styled Lord Percy until 1632, frequently visited his father, remaining with him for four or five days consecutively, as the ninth earl strove to limit his wife's influence. His letter to the twelve-year-old's tutor before he went up to St John's College, Cambridge, is characteristic. After explaining &#145;that many worthy spirits in this kingdom are lost by the neglect and ignorance of fathers&#146;, he proceeded to enumerate his son's defects, since his virtues soon would &#145;plead for themselves if he have any&#146;. These defects fell under the general heading of a pale and sallow complexion and &#145;abundance of moisture&#146;. He was a phlegmatic youth, more inclined to &#145;bashfulness&#146; than to lively spirits; in fact, he was unlikely to be &#145;passionate of anything&#146;. With this unpromising material, the tutor, Daniel Horsmanden, was to produce a sound Latin scholar with a little Greek who could use the terms of the arts, logic, and rhetoric. According to the ninth earl, Algernon would become an &#145;inward man&#146; with the attributes of a judge  (Syon MS P.I. 3x). In 1609 he had written an &#145;Advice&#146; to his son, instructing him in personal, family, and estate management  (Alnwick MS 322. 102). He had learned these lessons through bitter experience, and was at pains to ensure that his son, of whom he seemed not to have a high opinion, would be taught how to conduct his life.<br>
<br>In Easter term 1615 Algernon matriculated as a fellow-commoner from St John's College, Cambridge, and was admitted to the Middle Temple in London the following August. At Cambridge he was under the tuition of Edward Dowse and was created MA in 1616; in the same year he was created a knight of the Bath. He and Dowse embarked on a continental tour in 1618, and travelled in the Netherlands, Italy, and France. Algernon returned to England in 1624 and is said to have joined his father at court. In January 1629 he married Lady Anne (<i>bap</i>. 1612, <i>d</i>. 1637), the eldest daughter of William Cecil, second earl of Salisbury. The union was much against the wishes of his father, who blamed the first earl of Salisbury for his imprisonment in the Tower, declaring that the blood of Percy would not mix with the blood of Cecil &#145;if you poured it in a dish&#146;  (De Fonblanque, 2.370). The ninth earl did not, however, prevent the match, believing in his son's right to choose a wife. After his marriage Algernon visited the Percy estates in the north, the family having been prevented from living there since the time of the seventh earl in 1569. Anne died of smallpox on 6 December 1637, having had five daughters, of whom two survived into adulthood. Commenting on Algernon's loss, a friend said that passion had the least outward power on him of any man he knew.<h2>
<a name="Publiclifebeforethecivilwars"></a>Public life before the civil wars</h2>Percy sat as MP for Sussex in 1624&#150;5 and as member for Chichester in 1625&#150;6. He was summoned to the Lords in his father's barony as Lord Percy, taking his seat in March 1626, and was a leader of the anti-Buckingham faction within the house. In the following November he was appointed joint lord lieutenant of Cumberland, Northumberland, and Westmorland. Upon the death of his father in November 1632 he became the tenth earl of Northumberland.<br>
<br>The new earl felt the weight of Charles I's policy of &#145;thorough&#146;, having been obliged to pay off relief of &pound;7000 on an estate valued at &pound;12,750 at his accession. Nevertheless, he seized the opportunity to travel with Charles on his coronation trip to Scotland in 1633. Northumberland tried to attach himself to the court, but was fined in June 1634 for living in London against the king's general order of 1632. In fact his sister complained that he was so busy playing the courtier that he had little time left for his family. At the queen's urging, he was admitted to the Order of the Garter in 1635 after at least one earlier rejection. Clearly he was winning acceptance, finally to be rewarded with command of the ship money fleet in March 1636 and again in February 1637. As admiral of the ship money fleet, the king's most effective fighting force, he began to play a major role in Charles's government. Almost immediately he pressed for naval reforms, including &#145;girdling&#146; leaks, lowering high galleries, replacing rotten cordage, proper victualling procedures, and improved recruitment. Northumberland ran foul of the lords of the admiralty, having submitted his reforms directly to the king and privy council. The man primarily responsible for his admiralty appointment, Thomas, Viscount Wentworth, chided him:<blockquote>A very small belief might be persuaded that Commissioners of the Admiralty would not be well pleased with the prosecuting of abuses in the Navy, especially where the complaint went immediately to his Majesty without calling in upon them by the way. (Strafford, 2.43)</blockquote>The new admiral did succeed in ousting three Catholic officers, having pressed the oath of supremacy on the fleet early in his tenure. Though almost certainly not a puritan, he displayed an anti-Catholic bias throughout his life.Northumberland went to sea with the fleet in the summer of 1636. Its primary mission was to force the sale of licences on Dutch fishing boats in waters claimed by England. Surprised, many Dutch captains purchased the licences along with assurances of protection from Dunkirk pirates. If they refused, their nets were cut. Strongly pro-French, Northumberland was less enthusiastic about transporting Spanish money to the Netherlands in July. The summer campaign of 1637 was much less successful as the Dutch fished in convoys. Six ships of the fleet under the command of Captain Ramsborough did, however, succeed in avenging the raids of Sal&eacute; pirates, by successfully attacking their stronghold and rescuing 271 English sailors.<br>
<br>Though Northumberland had begun to make influential enemies at court such as Cottington and Windebank, he also had powerful friends, particularly Thomas Wentworth and Archbishop William Laud. Yielding to their persistent urging, Charles made Northumberland lord admiral on 13 April 1638, the first appointed since the assassination of Buckingham in 1628. It was intended that Northumberland would hold the office until the duke of York's majority. In the event, he held it until his commission was revoked by Charles in late June 1642. The earl became gravely ill from mid-April to July 1638. Recurrent illness hindered his exercise of the many powers conferred on him by Charles. The possibility also exists that he may have claimed illness to avoid abhorrent responsibilities. With his recovery in July, Northumberland was appointed one of the eight members of the important privy council subcommittee for Scotland. This committee was created to determine England's response to the Scots' rebellion against the prayer book. Wentworth, who was in Ireland, was not present for the initial meetings of the committee. However, in a letter of July 1639 he introduced his ideas through his close friend and client, Northumberland. This outlined the Straffordian policy that was to precipitate two wars with Scotland, necessitating the calling of the Long Parliament. Though he was the channel for Wentworth's ideas, Northumberland profoundly disagreed with his belligerent policy toward Scotland. The marcher lord heritage of the Percys had convinced him of the danger of war with the Scots, especially with an under-financed and ill-disciplined army. Moreover, should the Scots invade England, many of his estates in the north would be occupied. Wentworth was convinced that the English people would rally to the king in a war with the Scots; Northumberland was not. This disagreement finally drove a wedge between the two friends, especially as Wentworth had saddled Northumberland with responsibility for prosecuting the second bishops' war, advising the king to appoint him general of the forces in the north in January 1640. Another of Northumberland's illnesses prevented him from joining the army, so he was not directly involved in its defeat. His attitude towards the campaign, however, was entirely defeatist. He was one of two in the committee for Scotland who opposed the dissolution of the Short Parliament on 5 May 1640, for which he earned the disfavour of the king, widening the breach with Wentworth, now earl of Strafford. His disillusionment was expressed after the utter defeat of the ragtag army at Newburn in August: &#145;Never man hath been so used, as the King our master, in all the counsels that have been given him concerning this war by those persons whose judgments he only trusted for governing of these affairs&#146;  (Collins, 2.691). Northumberland had not been an effective general, having been more concerned with the unconstitutional application of martial law than with preparing the army to fight; but he can be credited with clear-sighted assessment of the folly of challenging the Scots with an unpaid army.<br>
<br>When the Long Parliament met in November 1640 Northumberland was one of the critics of royal policy. In fact he became the highest-ranked member of Charles's government to join parliament in the civil war. He refused the king's request to perjure himself in Strafford's trial, and his depositions both for the prosecution and the defence were damaging. He was ill when the Lords voted on the attainder, but there can be no doubt that he had rejected his friend and benefactor. In the hysteria of the time, he may even have feared prosecution as a Straffordian.<br>
<br>By the time of Strafford's trial Northumberland had shown signs of his intent to persevere with the king's opponents. In December 1640 he told his brother-in-law, the earl of Leicester, that he could secure from parliament the vacant lord lieutenancy of Ireland for him. He added that soon Charles would be obliged to listen to parliament. Shortly after Strafford's trial he persuaded his brother, Henry, to write a letter revealing a plot to use the army against parliament to rescue Strafford. Northumberland, urged by Pym, allowed Denzil Holles and John Hampden to copy the letter for publication. Clarendon refers to this incident as the first sign of Northumberland's defection.<h2>
<a name="Thecivilwars"></a>The civil wars</h2>In addition to his wealth and prestige as lord admiral, Northumberland's support was a key prize for parliament. In November 1641 he obeyed a parliamentary order to prepare four ships to take arms and ammunition to Ireland. In the same month he wrote that he favoured excluding bishops from the House of Lords, but would not commit himself on the grand remonstrance. In January 1642 he headed the list of lords who protested against the failure to censure the duke of Richmond for breach of privilege when he suggested that parliament be adjourned for six months. In February parliament made him lord lieutenant of Sussex, Northumberland, Pembrokeshire, and Anglesey; and in the same month he enthusiastically voted for the militia bill. Parliament's control of the navy was critical in the defeat of the royalists, and the lord admiral was the primary agent. Too late, on 28 June 1642, Charles revoked Northumberland's commission. Ever the man of honour, he laid it down on 1 July. Three days later, he was appointed to parliament's committee of safety.<br>
<br>Why did a man so favoured by Charles I rebel? According to Clarendon:<blockquote>Of those who were of the King's Council and who stayed and voted with the Parliament, the earl of Northumberland may well be reckoned the chief, in respect of the antiquity and splendor of his family, his great fortune and estate, and the general reputation he had amongst the greatest men, and his great interest by being High Admiral of England. (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 2.537)</blockquote>He then enumerates all Northumberland's offices and honours, concluding &#145;which was such a quick succession of bounties and favours as had rarely befallen any man who had not been attended with the envy of favourite&#146;  (ibid., 538). Great men had to make lacerating decisions in the early 1640s and Northumberland's was based primarily on constitutional principle, mixed with family tradition, and fear of being labelled a Straffordian.<br>
<br>In the manuscripts of Alnwick Castle there is a document entitled: &#145;Questions made at the holding of a court between the Lord Algernon Percy and Mr. Francis Powlton&#146;  (Alnwick MS 521, fols. 41&#150;77). This manuscript, intended for the instruction of the young Algernon, presents the constitutional position of the common lawyers. Asserting the antiquity of the balanced constitution, the dialogue argues strenuously against unfettered royal prerogative in favour of the rule of immemorial law and the requirement of parliament to represent the kingdom's interests. The subsequent behaviour of the earl of Northumberland before and during the civil wars certifies that he assimilated the lessons of this dialogue. Writing to his friend, the attorney-general John Bankes in June 1642, Northumberland said:<blockquote>we believe that those persons who are most powerful with the King do endeavour to bring Parliaments to such condition that they shall be instruments to execute the commands of the King, who were established for his greatest and most supreme council &hellip; but let us have our laws and liberties and privileges secured to us. (G. Bankes, <span class="italic">Story of Corfe Castle</span>, 1853, 122&#150;3)</blockquote>The Percy tradition of rebellion also had its effect. The sixth through to the eighth earls died violently in rebellion against the crown, and the ninth earl suffered a long imprisonment at the hands of James I. Furthermore, Northumberland was the nephew of the rebellious earl of Essex. Religion, on the other hand, was not a powerful factor in his decision. He was certainly anti-Catholic, but there is little evidence that religion had a powerful hold on him. Likewise, the Percy estates had prospered under the Stuarts once the ninth earl attended to their management. The tenth earl, having continued the tradition of sound management, had no reason to feel economically aggrieved under Charles's rule.<br>
<br>When the war went badly for parliament in 1642&#150;3, however, Northumberland wavered. He hoped that parliament would reward him with reappointment to the admiralty, but its choice, driven by the radicals in the Commons, was the earl of Warwick. Appalled by the reality of war at Edgehill and Turnham Green (where he was probably in arms), he became a leader of the peace party. Never bold, his abhorrence of fratricidal bloodshed was compounded by parliamentary defeats. D'Ewes reports that Northumberland's shift to the peace party was definite in March 1643. The earl led the parliamentary delegation at the Oxford peace negotiations in the following April, where Charles, negotiating from strength, yielded little. On 18 April, the day of his return from Oxford, he struck Henry Marten with a cane because Marten had intercepted and opened a letter from Northumberland's young wife, Lady Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1608&#150;1705), second daughter of Theophilus Howard, second earl of Suffolk, whom he had married on 1 October 1642. This was but one episode in the looming confrontation between the war and peace parties that culminated in physical threats to some lords outside parliament on 5 August, orchestrated by Lord Mayor Pennington in the hope of arresting Northumberland and other leaders of the peace party.<br>
<br>In June 1643 Northumberland was accused of complicity in the Waller plot, but D'Ewes reports that although Henry Marten pushed to prosecute him, Waller could not substantiate the charges. After the tumult of 5 August, having been unable to persuade his cousin, the third earl of Essex, to support further peace efforts, Northumberland retired to his Sussex estate, Petworth, while other peace lords defected to the royalist headquarters at Oxford. It is clear that he was tempted to follow them, but his nature counselled caution. What he waited on was the outcome of negotiations between parliament and the Scots. Always ambivalent toward Scotland, Northumberland preferred not to invite the Scots into England's war, while recognizing that the best hope for parliamentary victory lay with an alliance. The solemn league and covenant, signed in late September, paved the way for his return to active involvement in parliament. In fact, despite this absence, he was the most regular attendee of Lords' committees from August 1642 until the end of 1644. He took the covenant on 30 October 1643, having already been appointed to the Westminster assembly the previous June. On 18 February 1644 he became the first chairman of the committee of both kingdoms, faithfully participating throughout its life. Baillie may have put his finger on the key to Northumberland's co-operation when he wrote that the earl would be a supporter of the Scots on the committee now that they had occupied his lands in the north.<br>
<br>Northumberland definitely moved towards the war party in 1644, though he continued to spearhead peace efforts. According to Clarendon:<blockquote>the repulse he had formerly received at Oxford upon his addresses thither, and the fair escape he had made afterwards from the jealousy of the Parliament, had wrought so far upon him, that he resolved no more to depend upon the one or to provoke the other, and was willing to see the King's power and authority so much restrained that he might not be able to do him any harm. (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.495)</blockquote>In April 1645 he broke ranks with the peers, registering one of four Lords' votes for the self-denying ordinance. In the previous month he had signalled his intentions by protesting against the removal of forts and garrisons from Fairfax's command, as well as the inclusion of a clause in Fairfax's orders to protect the king's person. He was a strong supporter of the New Model Army, and in this he was no doubt influenced by his servant, Robert Scawen, who chaired parliament's army committee. On 18 March 1645 Northumberland was given charge of the king's two younger children, the duke of Gloucester and Princess Elizabeth; it was reported that the duke might be made king with the tenth earl as lord protector should Charles refuse further negotiations. This occurred after the failure of the treaty of Uxbridge in February, where Northumberland led the parliamentary delegation to a king whose position was weakening. The earl had managed the preparations for the treaty in both the Lords and the committee of both kingdoms. Failure at Uxbridge solidified Northumberland's alignment with the war party, now known as the Independents. His letters in 1645 and 1646 show an unusually high level of commitment to the parliamentary cause&#151;though there were limits, as his refusal to vote for the attainder of Laud in January had signalled.<br>
<br>Northumberland was particularly active in parliament as the first civil war drew to a close. He attended an unusually large number of committees in summer 1646, including the committee to analyse the king's letters taken at Naseby. In October he was appointed to the committee to draw up the ordinance for the sale of bishops' lands, having earlier been added to the committee of the revenue as a reward for his support of the self-denying ordinance and the New Model. He also pursued personal business intensely at this time in an attempt to recover his northern rents. The Percys were not popular with their northern tenants as a result of their long enforced absence and the harsh administration of the ninth earl. Moreover, most of the tenants were royalists. Until February 1647 most of the northern estates were occupied and sometimes looted by the Scots. Northumberland drew his servant, Hugh Potter, from his parliamentary duties (as MP for Plympton in Devon) in 1643 to look after his interests in the north. Two-thirds of the Percy revenues came from their northern estates, mostly in Yorkshire and Northumberland. However, with royalist and Scots occupation annual northern revenues of about &pound;10,000 sank to under &pound;3000 in 1643, recovering only slowly to &pound;8800 by 1646. Discouraged by the difficulty of collecting his northern rents, the tenth earl sold &pound;9000 worth of northern lands in 1647 and a further &pound;7000 in 1648. Additional complications were created by parliament's efforts to collect subsidies once the north came within its orbit, whipsawing tenants between taxes and rents. County committees obviously favoured tax over rent collection.<br>
<br>Northumberland took advantage of his good standing with parliament to submit a bill for &pound;42,000 in losses from the war, mostly arrears in rent; he was granted &pound;10,000. He also pushed unsuccessfully to have the full allowances paid for his custody of the king's children. After the fall of Oxford in July 1646 the duke of York was added to his charge, and the expenses for all three children greatly exceeded his reimbursements. In February 1648 he asked to be relieved of the king's children, declining responsibility should they escape. In fact the duke of York escaped in April and, after an investigation, the tenth earl was absolved of blame. At his suggestion, in May 1649 the duke of Gloucester and Princess Elizabeth were handed over to Northumberland's sister, the countess of Leicester.<br>
<br>In January 1647 Northumberland combined with Manchester and the presbyterian peers to draw up proposals that might be acceptable to the king. These were sent to the queen through the French ambassador, Bellievre. In February the earl was nominated to the important committee of Irish affairs. However, as parliament and its army fell out over pay and power, Northumberland sided with the army. He was among the group of nine peers who left parliament for the army after riots in and around Westminster in July, signing an engagement with the army for the restoration of the freedom of both houses on 4 August. The meeting between army officers and lords was held at Northumberland's Syon House and his servant, Scawen, as chair of the army committee, moderated the meeting. This was the apex of the tenth earl's courtship of the army. As one of the commissioners for the four bills, he then made one more effort in December 1647 to treat with the king, but Charles rejected the proposals.<h2>
<a name="Regicideandtheinterregnum"></a>Regicide and the interregnum</h2>The general hardening of antagonism towards Charles following the second civil war pushed Northumberland in the opposite direction. He opposed the vote of no further addresses to the king in January 1648, and it was said that no man at the time was so hard to understand as Northumberland. In September and October he was one of fifteen parliamentary commissioners at the Newport treaty, making the opening speech to the king. He, along with Holles and Pierrepoint, stayed into November in a desperate attempt to reach an acceptable accommodation with Charles, but their efforts proved fruitless. On 2 January 1649 Northumberland led the Lords' votes against the ordinance to try the king, as well as the proposition that it was treason for Charles to levy war against parliament. He had become a defender of the king against a Rump Parliament which desecrated his long-held commitment to a balanced constitution, declaring:<blockquote>The greatest part (at least twenty to one) of the People of England were not yet satisfied, whether the King levied war against the Houses, or the Houses against Him. And if the King did levy war first against the Houses, we have no Law to make it Treason in Him so to do. And for us to declare Treason by an Ordinance, when the matter of fact is not yet proved, nor any Law extant to judge it by, is very unreasonable. (C. Walker, <span class="italic">History of Independency</span>, 2, 1650, 55&#150;6)</blockquote>Northumberland withdrew from public life during the Commonwealth and protectorate. He took the engagement to be loyal to the Commonwealth, but he was not trusted by the military regime. Having been relieved of the charge of the king's children in May 1649, he no longer had official duties. His sister, the countess of Carlisle, had been examined and confined to the Tower in March for her involvement with the earl of Holland in the second civil war. One of Northumberland's prized possessions in the north, Wressel Castle, was destroyed in 1650, having earlier been protected from slighting. In the same year he successfully defended himself against an accusation of delinquency, preventing confiscation of his estates. Throughout the interregnum he was forced to defend himself against a claim from the City companies regarding a loan of &pound;50,000 to Charles I in 1640 for which he and several lords stood surety. In spring and summer 1655 he was under house arrest. Thurloe, whose spies had already intercepted at least one letter to Northumberland, believed that the earl had instructed Hugh Potter to prepare his northern tenants to assist in Penruddock's rising. As a result the tenth earl was reported to have had a three-hour interview with Cromwell. Towards the end of the protectorate Northumberland declined the invitations of both Oliver and Richard Cromwell to sit in the upper house of their parliaments. Expressing once again his cherished constitutional views, he told Richard that, &#145;till the government was such as his predecessors have served under, he could not in honour do it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Clarendon State Papers</span>, 2.432).<h2>
<a name="TheRestoration"></a>The Restoration</h2>the restoration of Charles II brought fresh hope to Northumberland. He thrust himself into the fluid politics of early 1660 by organizing the Suffolk House cabal, named after the house that came to him through his marriage with Elizabeth in 1642. Meeting in April, the cabal included Manchester, Holles, St John, and Pierrepoint. Northumberland had an earlier meeting with Monck at which he believed he had secured Monck's support. The plan of the cabal was to have those who sat in 1648 constitute the House of Lords and then impose on Charles II the conditions offered to his father at Newport. In so doing Northumberland could realize his constitutional convictions while assuming considerable political power. However, the cabal collapsed when Monck supported the Convention Parliament at the end of April. Charles II arrived in May and Northumberland rushed to secure his favour. He did, however, unsuccessfully support a general act of indemnity, opposing the questioning of those involved in the late king's execution, saying that<blockquote>though he had no part in the death of the King, he was against questioning those who had been concerned in that affair; that the example might be more useful to posterity and profitable to future kings, by deterring them from the like exorbitances. (<span class="italic">Ludlow's Memoirs</span>, ed. C. H. Firth, 2 1894, 267&#150;68)</blockquote>By again asserting his belief in limited monarchy, he did not endear himself to the new king and he was rewarded with mere trappings without any substance of power. Northumberland's condition was aggravated by a report that he attempted to have Hyde (later earl of Clarendon) excepted from an act of indemnity because he was thought to have recommended to Charles I that he should treat with Spain and not with parliament.<br>
<br>On 31 May 1660 Northumberland was sworn as a privy councillor and in August he was made lord lieutenant of Sussex, to be followed with the lord lieutenancy of Northumberland in September. He was diligent in his county responsibilities, organizing the militias, and in 1662 enforcing the Clarendon code. In April 1661 he was the lord high constable at the coronation of Charles II. However, the earl of Manchester was his only friend at court and, more importantly, Clarendon had good reason to oppose him. Northumberland requited him by voting for his impeachment in November 1667.<br>
<br>Having failed to secure power Northumberland spent most of his time at Petworth during the 1660s. He continued to discharge his lord lieutenancies, particularly in Sussex; for example, in January 1667 moving to disarm popish recusants while complaining that others were not equally diligent. In country retirement he retained his interest in the navy, compiling documents detailing its condition. He died on 13 October 1668 at Petworth, where he was buried in that month. He was succeeded by his only son of his second marriage, Jocelyn; who died aged twenty-six in 1670. The countess Elizabeth survived until March 1705. In the December following the tenth earl's death, Jocelyn received an impressive testimonial from a former royalist, Sir William Temple, describing Northumberland as a man of truly noble quality who acted with restraint, constancy, honesty, integrity, and compassion, but not familiarness; who did all this in spite of the disadvantage of living in a divided age. Jocelyn also received a touching letter from the duke of York praising the kindness that Northumberland had shown him during his period of custody.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>Clarendon, who knew Northumberland well, but was not unbiased, called him &#145;the proudest man alive&#146;, continuing &#145;If he had thought the King as much above him as he thought himself above other considerable men, he would have been a good subject &hellip; He was in all his deportment a very great man&#146;&#151;a person who behaved with dignity and independence more characteristic of a feudal baron than a seventeenth-century lord (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.495; 2.538). He was not a man of great abilities, but he enjoyed the reputation and influence of such a person.<blockquote>Though his notions were not large or deep, yet his temper, and reservedness in discourse, and his unrashness in speaking, got him the reputation of an able and a wise man; which he made evident in the excellent government of his family, where no man was more absolutely obeyed; and no man had ever fewer idle words to answer for; and in debates of importance he always expressed himself very pertinently. (ibid., 2.538)</blockquote>Clarendon's assessment in some ways echoes the ninth earl's characterization of young Algernon to his tutor, Daniel Horsmanden.<br>
<br>In the final analysis, the tenth earl was a man of high principle and dispassionate demeanour, more suited to lead in settled times than the tumult of civil war. As his older sister Dorothy remarked in 1637, he was cold to his friends, &#145;but there is more truth and fidelity in him than in 1000 Hollands and as many Henry Percys&#146;  (<span class="italic">De L'Isle and Dudley MSS</span>, 6.92).<br>
