<span class="headword">Holwell,  William</span>  (1725/6&#150;1798), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and writer</span>, was baptized on 11 May 1726 in Exeter Cathedral, the elder son of William Holwell (<i>bap</i>. 1699) of Exeter and his wife, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1783), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2507/', "Bishop Ofspring Blackall (d. 1716)")</script>. Holwell's father died early; his mother remarried on 26 December 1738.<br>
<br>On 26 June 1740 Holwell was nominated to a canoneer studentship at Christ Church, Oxford, by his stepfather Peter Foulkes (1676&#150;1747), canon of that house; he matriculated on 17 December 1741, aged fifteen, and took his BA in 1745 and MA in 1748. He became a lecturer, a tutor, censor, librarian, and catechist at Christ Church, and was university proctor in 1758; he took his BD in 1760. His pupil William Petty (1737&#150;1805), future earl of Shelburne, patronizingly called him &#145;a narrow-minded tutor&#146;, but &#145;not without learning&#146;  (Fitzmaurice, 17, 18). Holwell's learning was first published in editions of Aristotle's <span class="italic">Rhetoric</span> (1759) and of selected literary essays by Dionysius of Halicarnassus (1766).<br>
<br>Holwell was instituted as vicar of Thornbury, Gloucestershire, a Christ Church living, on 11 January 1762. By the early 1770s he was married to a woman named Martha; by 1775 he was a chaplain-in-ordinary to King George III; he became a prebendary of Exeter on 26 June 1776. Horace Walpole describes his encounter, in August 1774, with the obsequious Holwell and his lean wife, suckling a child, after he had mistaken the vicarage for the sexton's mean cottage, but Walpole probably improved the tale, for, according to Holwell's own account, the living in 1778 was more than &pound;150 and improvable; according to his successor in 1800 it was worth &pound;250; and Holwell was able, in his will of 12 December 1796, to dispose of over &pound;5300 together with evidently valuable household goods.<br>
<br>At Thornbury, Holwell became a compiler and popularizer, with a selection of &#145;beauties&#146; from Homer's <span class="italic">Iliad</span> (1775), a corresponding selection from Alexander Pope's Homer translation (1775), and a <span class="italic">Mythological Dictionary</span> (1793), extracted from Bryant's <span class="italic">New System &hellip; of Ancient Mythology</span> (1774&#150;6) and rearranged alphabetically for the benefit of &#145;the young beginner&#146;  (preface). Holwell later contributed to Ralph Bigland's <span class="italic">Historical &hellip; Collections</span> on Gloucestershire, and in 1789&#150;90 read and corrected proofs of John Wilkes's edition of Theophrastus's <span class="italic">Characters</span>. His letters to Wilkes unconvincingly imply that Holwell too was a radical. Holwell died on 13 February 1798 at Thornbury. He was survived by his wife and two children, Edward Ofspring Holwell (1773/4&#150;1832) and Charlotte Eleonora. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4757/', "William Holwell Carr (1758&#150;1830)")</script> was his nephew.<br>
