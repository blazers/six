<span class="headword">MacCarthy,  John George</span>  (1829&#150;1892), <span class="occ">land commissioner and author</span>, born at Cork in June 1829, was the son of John MacCarthy, merchant, of Cork, and his wife, Jane, daughter of George O'Driscoll, distiller, of Cork. He was educated at St Vincent's, a local private school. In 1851 MacCarthy made a continental tour and wrote his first book entitled <span class="italic">Letters on the Land Tenures of Europe</span>. He was admitted a solicitor in 1853, and continued to practise in Cork until 1881. In 1859 he married Maria Josephine, daughter of John Hanrahan of Mount Prospect, Cork, and they had a family of at least three sons.<br>
<br>MacCarthy was an early supporter of Isaac Butt's home rule efforts and had written, in 1871, <span class="italic">A Plea for Home Government of Ireland</span>. From 1874 to 1880 he represented Mallow in parliament as a home-ruler. While in parliament he devoted his attention to the Irish land question, and his mastery of the subject led to his appointment as an assistant commissioner under the <span class="roman">Land Act</span> of 1881. On the passing of the <span class="roman">Land Purchase Act</span> in 1885, MacCarthy was appointed one of the two commissioners selected to carry out that measure. He was a firm believer in the efficacy of peasant proprietorship, and administered the different <span class="roman">Land Purchase Acts</span> with justice and fairness.<br>
<br>MacCarthy was connected with many philanthropic institutions, notably the Cork Young Men's Society, of which he was for a long period president, and in recognition of services to the Roman Catholic church he was made a knight of the order of St Gregory by Pope Leo XIII. In addition to several legal pamphlets he was the author of historical works and a further book on the Irish land question. MacCarthy died at the Eastern Hotel, Drummond Street, London, on 7 September 1892, and was buried in Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin, on the 10th.<br>
