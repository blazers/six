<span class="headword">Benson,  Samuel Herbert</span>  (1854&#150;1914), <span class="occ">advertising agent</span>, was born on 14 August 1854 at 7 Somerset Street, Marylebone, Middlesex, the son of Samuel Miles Benson, solicitor, and his wife, Phillipa, daughter of James Bourne of Lincolnshire. Benson began training for the law but at sixteen changed his mind and passed the entrance examination for the Royal Navy. His active service took him to various points of conflict in west Africa, to Gallipoli, and to Suez during the campaign against Arabi Pasha in 1882. There he was severely bitten by a poisonous insect, had to be invalided home, and spent three years on crutches, employed as secretary to several Admiralty committees, before he decided to resign from the navy.<br>
<br>In 1882 Benson married Mary Ann Phillips, daughter of a naval paymaster; they had three sons and two daughters. In 1885 he set up the Express Courier Corps, an organization of messenger boys, but Post Office opposition compelled him to disband it. He then undertook a series of managerial posts: from 1886 with the Normal Company, fish processors, at Aberdeen; from 1889 with John Lawson Johnston at his Bovril works at Clerkenwell, London; then briefly in France. <br>
<br>When the owners of Bovril invited Benson to become their advertising agent he admitted to knowing no more of the subject than most businessmen, but he had the foresight to see the part that skilful advertising might play in business practice. He accepted the invitation, entering into his new profession with dignity and purpose, and, in a milieu where sharp practice and outright fraud were commonplace, he earned a reputation for integrity. From its inception in 1893, with the prestigious Bovril company on his books, his agency held the front rank. Among his more innovative schemes were his thirteen full-page advertisements depicting topical events of 1896&#150;7 such as the Jameson raid and the budget, in which he introduced, incidentally yet forcefully, three well-known branded goods. The &#145;Cocoa War&#146; which he orchestrated on behalf of Rowntrees was even more colourful, introducing free samples, exchangeable coupons, and London buses disguised as cocoa pods, causing a surge in demand which delighted Rowntrees. In 1899 he moved the agency to a new three-storey block in Tudor Street and in 1909 to its best-known home, Kingsway Hall, the first office building in the new thoroughfare of Kingsway.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1899 Benson organized the Advertisers' Exhibition at the Niagara Hall in London, with eye-catching electric signs and a phonograph player&#151;still very much a novelty. The inaugural lunch was attended by all the great Fleet Street newspaper magnates, advertisers, and their agents. Benson clashed memorably with Sir George Newnes of <span class="italic">Strand Magazine</span>, but his challenging assertion that newspapers and magazines would wither without advertising and not the other way round proved true. But the confrontation raised the old controversies over reliable circulation figures and commission charges.<br>
<br>Benson brought new ideas into the advertising world; his two booklets, <span class="italic">Wisdom in Advertising</span> (1901) and <span class="italic">Force in Advertising</span> (1904) were widely read by the industry's practitioners. From 1905 his biennial handbook, <span class="italic">Benson's Facts</span>, presented data on press and outdoor publicity. He believed that a study of the market should precede product development and that advertising campaigns should have definite objectives, rather than simply announce existing products. His attempt to set up an organization, the Association of Advertising Agents, failed, however, as there was no agreement on who might join or how to exclude the many charlatans who sullied the profession's name. Benson was thought to pay the best wages in London, rewarding his staff for loyalty and ability. Though somewhat remote and autocratic by nature, his temper often frayed by recurring pain in his injured leg, he took a personal interest in the welfare of his staff and assisted their families in time of trouble. Benson also found time in 1899 to be a founder of the war employment bureau, which provided work for the wives of reservists called up to fight in the South African War.<br>
<br>After being struck by a bus in Fleet Street in November 1913 Benson was found to be suffering from an incurable disease of the gall bladder, from which he died at his home, Beechgrove, Sydenham Hill, London, on 21 July 1914. He was buried on 24 July at All Saints' Church, Hertford. He was survived by his wife. His son, Philip de Gylpin Benson (1881&#150;1931), was the first president of the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (1927), but when he died there was no one in the family to succeed him and the firm passed into other hands, and later became part of Ogilvy Benson Mather.<br>
