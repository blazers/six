<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Herbert,  Henry Howard Molyneux</span>, fourth earl of Carnarvon  (1831&#150;1890), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in Grosvenor Square, London, on 24 June 1831, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13036/', "Henry John George Herbert, third earl of Carnarvon (1800&#150;1849)")</script>, and his wife, Henrietta Anne (1804&#150;1876), eldest daughter of Lord Henry Molyneux Howard, a brother of Bernard Edward Howard, twelfth duke of Norfolk. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33828/', "Auberon Herbert (1838&#150;1906)")</script> was his brother. Herbert, who bore the courtesy title Viscount Porchester until 1849, inherited many of his father's characteristics, being literary rather than practical, cultured, and with a remarkable facility for words. Both, too, shared a love of travel. From an early age, Porchester enjoyed family visits abroad. The last of these journeys, undertaken when he was eight years of age, was intended to include parts of Asia Minor; but at Constantinople, he was taken seriously ill with fever and the family was obliged to return urgently to England. At Athens on the homeward journey his sister contracted fever, and in Italy his governess and nurse both died.<br>
<br>Academically very able from an early age, Porchester entered Eton College in April 1844 conversant with the works of many Latin and Greek authors. His four years at the school were followed by study at Oxford, where he matriculated from Christ Church on 17 October 1849. His father died on 10 December 1849 and he succeeded to the earldom. At Oxford, where Carnarvon was awarded a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1852, Henry Mansel, later Waynflete professor of moral philosophy and dean of St Paul's, exercised a powerful intellectual influence on him. While at Oxford, Carnarvon formed a lifelong friendship with Lord Sandon, later third earl of Harrowby. Shortly after graduating, the two men made an adventurous journey to Asia Minor, reaching Babylon, then relatively little visited. From his observations in Damascus, Carnarvon later published <span class="italic">Recollections of the Druses and Notes on their Religion</span> (1860).<h2>
<a name="Earlypoliticallife"></a>Early political life</h2>Carnarvon had become interested in politics during his time at Oxford and was early marked out for a political career. He was asked by Aberdeen, then head of a coalition government, to move the address in answer to the queen's speech in the Lords on 31 January 1854. In his maiden speech, Carnarvon expounded his belief in a strong British empire, with the colonies living in harmony with their mother country. The Crimean War had broken out and the colonies had made financial contributions to the conduct of the campaign. On 1 March 1855 Carnarvon suggested in the Lords that the government should move a vote of thanks in recognition of their help. Shortly after the end of the war, he toured the battlefields in the Crimea with his old friend, Admiral Lord Lyons.<br>
<br>With the fall of the Palmerston government in February 1858, Lord Derby became prime minister. Carnarvon was offered, at the age of twenty-six, the office of under-secretary for the colonies. It was typical of his firm adherence to principles that he at first hesitated to accept because of the cabinet's refusal to continue with Palmerston's <span class="roman">Conspiracy Bill</span>. He gained valuable experience under first Lord Stanley and then Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton during the eighteen months of the Derby ministry, which fell in June 1859.<br>
<br>Out of office, Carnarvon devoted his time to travel and closely observing the political scene. He strongly disliked the new reform bill which was threatened by the incoming Palmerston government and he expressed his concerns over imperial defence after a visit to Malta. As a country gentleman and landowner, he attended to the estate at Highclere, the family home in Hampshire, and carried out his duties in the county. Carnarvon's first efforts at penal reform with offenders had begun in 1854 and he became chairman of the judicial committee of the Hampshire quarter sessions in 1860. His paper <span class="italic">Prison Discipline</span> (1864) formed the basis of a <span class="roman">Prisons Bill</span> which was enacted by parliament the following year. He was appointed high steward of Oxford University in 1859 and created DCL. On 5 September 1861 Carnarvon married Lady Evelyn Stanhope (<i>d</i>. 1875), only daughter of the sixth earl of Chesterfield, at Westminster Abbey. They had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33830/', "George Edward Stanhope Molyneux Herbert")</script>, who succeeded as fifth earl, and three daughters.<h2>
<a name="Colonialsecretary18661867"></a>Colonial secretary, 1866&#150;1867</h2>On the death of Palmerston, Lord Derby once more formed an administration, and Carnarvon was appointed colonial secretary in June 1866. One outstanding issue was the future of Canada. In 1858 Sir Edmund Head, governor-in-chief of British North America, had announced the policy of confederation to the Canadian parliament. No immediate action was taken though Carnarvon had followed developments in Canada while out of office. A formal meeting of North American delegates met in London in January 1867 under Carnarvon's chairmanship to discuss the <span class="roman">British North America Bill</span> which had been drafted. The main object was to unite Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick in one federal dominion under the crown with its own parliament, divided into upper and lower houses, with a seat of government, ultimately agreed, at Ottawa. The dominion of Canada came into existence on 1 July following the royal assent to the <span class="roman">British North America Bill</span>.<br>
<br>Carnarvon had early in office favoured federation to annexation. He was later to attempt the same solution in South Africa and in Ireland with less success. He had previously expounded his philosophy in a speech at a banquet for delegates from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in September 1867:<blockquote>Changes in the course of time may come, which may vary our relationship with our distant Colonies, but changes depend very much in their nature on the spirit in which they are conceived, and also the spirit in which they are met &hellip; Once in the history of England it so happened that we parted from some of our great Colonies with a bad spirit and in a misunderstanding, the evil effects of which were felt for many a long year &hellip; this has taught us a useful lesson, and we need not be ashamed to own it. It taught us that conciliation is better than coercion: that if we give our confidence, it will be repaid us a hundredfold. It taught us and it taught the Colonies also&#151;that their interests properly understood are not separate and distinct; but that the more prosperous the Colonies are, the greater will be the strength they confer on the Mother Country. (Hardinge, 1.300&#150;01)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Resignationoverthefranchise1867"></a>Resignation over the franchise, 1867</h2>In February 1867, a few days before Carnarvon introduced the second reading of the bill in the Lords, Lord Derby again raised the household suffrage question in cabinet. At first there was hostility towards the proposals though Disraeli, in charge of the bill in the Commons, made concessions. Carnarvon disliked the notion of the working classes' predominating among the electorate. Lord Cranborne (later the third marquess of Salisbury), then secretary for India, agreed with Carnarvon's misgivings on Disraeli's action and they determined to act in concert. At a cabinet on 23 February the business was hurried through, with Carnarvon objecting to important changes' being proposed only two days before the scheme was to be put to Conservative supporters. At a further meeting on 25 February only Carnarvon, Cranborne, and General Jonathan Peel, secretary for war, were not prepared to accept the reform plan. All three resigned at the cabinet meeting on 2 March. Carnarvon wrote in his journal, &#145;Lord Derby closed a red box with a heavy sigh and said, &#147;The Party is ruined&#148;, and Disraeli added rather cynically, &#147;Poor Tory Party&#148;&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 60899). Carnarvon made a personal explanation in the Lords on 4 March and handed in his seals of office to the queen four days later. The <span class="roman">Representation of the People Bill</span> became law on 15 August.<h2>
<a name="Outofoffice18671874"></a>Out of office, 1867&#150;1874</h2>Although he was often characterized as a high-churchman, Carnarvon's early contact with the Puseys and the Tractarian movement made him an intermediary between the conflicting schools of evangelical and high-church opinion.<br>
<br>When the relations between church and state in Ireland were being discussed in parliament in June 1868, Carnarvon told his friend Canon Liddon: &#145;I believe disestablishment to be inevitable, though I admit the conclusion possibly may not be so immediate as many suppose&#146;  (Hardinge, 2.2). In a speech in the Lords on the second reading of the <span class="roman">Irish Church Bill</span> on 26 June 1868, much to the delight of the Liberals, Carnarvon refused to assist in rejecting Gladstone's bill to suspend the creation of fresh interests in the Irish church  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 193, 1868, cols. 2&#150;16). With the general election in November 1868 and the return of a Liberal ministry, led by Gladstone, an <span class="roman">Irish Church Bill</span> was introduced in March 1869. Before the bill reached the Lords, a private meeting of Conservative peers was held at Lord Derby's house in St James's Square. Carnarvon, unlike the majority of the meeting, was unable to support opposition to the bill and once more expressed his personal views in a Lords debate on 14 June.<br>
<br>Having resigned from the government two years previously and subsequently accepted the principle of Irish disestablishment, Carnarvon was for a time unpopular with both his fellow peers and churchmen. Nor did he oppose the <span class="roman">Irish Land Bill</span> of 1870, believing that it would assist in the pacification of Ireland. However, the resignation of Lord Cairns as leader of the Conservatives in the Lords and the need to find a strong successor brought Carnarvon back into the picture. He acted as a negotiator with Salisbury and Stanley, neither of whom would accept the post while Disraeli led in the Commons. In a conversation with Gathorne Hardy, it was suggested that Carnarvon would be the best leader. He noted in his journal:<blockquote>I told him that the Party in the House of Lords had behaved to me with so much injustice and unkindness that though I had forgiven it I should not forget it and that &hellip; I was not inclined to take the lead. (journal, 22 Feb 1870, BL, Add. MS 60902)</blockquote>Finally, the duke of Richmond was persuaded to take the post.<br>
<br>A great personal blow to Carnarvon occurred shortly afterwards with the murder in Greece of his favourite cousin, Edward Herbert. Herbert, then secretary to the British legation in Athens, was captured by brigands, along with three companions, on an expedition to Marathon. The party were held to ransom for &pound;25,000 with amnesty and on receiving the news on 14 April, Carnarvon raised the money and telegraphed it to the Greek government. Unfortunately, the call for amnesty was refused, and, although the brigands were captured, the four men had been murdered on 21 April. The news shocked the nation, and Carnarvon, who was overwhelmed at the loss, heavily criticized the Greek government in the Lords for their action.<br>
<br>Early in 1872 Carnarvon suffered a serious breakdown and illness which was followed by a long convalescence. It was during this time that he wrote a book, published anonymously the following year, <span class="italic">The Shadows of a Sick Room</span>, which expressed his religious beliefs. A keen yachtsman, Carnarvon embarked on one of his frequent cruises with friends and colleagues and later toured the Franco-Prussian battlefields in January 1873.<br>
<br>Carnarvon's responsibilities as a landowner had increased with the death of his brother-in-law, Lord Chesterfield. The extensive Bretby estate and collieries in Nottinghamshire&#151;over 13,000 acres&#151;were left to his mother and himself. Carnarvon had already inherited 22,000 acres in Somerset and Hampshire, the family seat at Highclere, and Pixton Hall, Somerset, on the death of his father in 1849. The total property amounted to 35,583 acres. Carnarvon was a conscientious steward of the properties, paying frequent visits, maintaining close contact with tenants and villagers, and staying at one of his three country houses on the estates.<br>
<br>The political situation also caused Carnarvon some anxiety. Gladstone's ministry was becoming increasingly unpopular and the prospect of a government led by Disraeli was a real possibility. As Salisbury was, in this eventuality, unlikely to take office, Carnarvon felt bound to share his view. However, in July 1873 Disraeli and Carnarvon united to oppose Selborne's <span class="roman">Judicature Bill</span>, though in vain. In October, Disraeli visited Bretby and had a long and amicable conversation with Carnarvon. &#145;His mind has a much more <i>classical</i> culture than I had supposed&#146;, Carnarvon noted  (journal, 10 Oct 1873, BL, Add. MS 60905). On political matters, &#145;One of the most remarkable features of this remarkable man [Disraeli] is the apparently total absence of personal rancour. He seems to have no feeling against those who have shown the greatest feeling against him&#146;  (journal, 7 Oct 1873, BL, Add. MS 60905). With the Conservative victory at the general election in February 1874, Salisbury and Carnarvon were both publicly and privately urged to join Disraeli's government. After an interview with the prime minister on 19 February, Carnarvon once more accepted the post of secretary of state for the colonies.<h2>
<a name="Colonialsecretary18741878"></a>Colonial secretary, 1874&#150;1878</h2>Disraeli was happy to leave matters of colonial policy largely to Carnarvon. One vexed problem facing the new colonial secretary was the future of South Africa. The situation there was a delicate one. The recent discovery and annexation of the diamond fields of Griqualand West had accentuated the rivalry between the English and Dutch settlers. Sir Richard Southey, the lieutenant-governor, failed to keep order in the colony: Carnarvon was obliged to telegraph for troops from Cape Town to quell a serious disturbance in April 1875. The governor at the Cape and high commissioner of South Africa, Sir Henry Barkly, gave little guidance to his ministers when difficult diplomatic dealings with the Orange Free State and the South African Republic were taking place. Further, the English colonies of Cape Colony, Natal, and Griqualand West were pursuing a policy of harshness towards the native peoples, as were the Dutch Boers. Carnarvon determined to pacify the natives, reversing a sentence of high treason on a chief, Langalibalele, and recalled the governor, Sir Benjamin Pine.<br>
<br>Carnarvon believed that a South African federation, on the lines of his Canadian scheme, was necessary, especially in the eventuality of war with the native people. In 1874 he dispatched his friend, James Anthony Froude, the historian, to South Africa to urge federation; the mission was unsuccessful. Undeterred, Carnarvon received cabinet agreement in April 1875 to invite the Dutch states, Orange Free State and the Transvaal, to meet with the three English colonies to discuss the matter. The proposal, sent to Barkly for immediate publicity, was received by the Cape assembly with great hostility, not helped by a further visit by Froude in June.<br>
<br>In the face of such opposition Carnarvon withdrew his scheme in October 1875, but suggested a conference in London. In negotiations with John Henry Brand, president of the Orange Free State, in July 1876, it was agreed that for a sum of &pound;90,000 Griqualand West should be united with Cape Colony. This included the future city of Kimberley, with its diamond fields. The long-delayed South African Conference took place in London in August, with Carnarvon in the chair, but little progress was made.<br>
<br>The defeat of the Boers in the Transvaal in 1876 convinced Carnarvon that the annexation of the state would be a suitable basis for progressing federation. Sir Theophilus Shepstone, secretary for native affairs in Natal, was dispatched to the Transvaal in September to effect annexation as soon as possible. In March 1877 Carnarvon sent Sir Bartle Frere as governor of Cape Colony and high commissioner for South Africa. With a view to filling the post of governor-general of a unified South Africa, Carnarvon introduced a <span class="roman">South African Confederation Bill</span> in the Lords on 23 April, but, before it had proceeded far, he received a telegraph from Shepstone announcing that he had proclaimed the annexation of the Transvaal on 12 April. This step received Carnarvon's strong approval.<br>
<br>The move proved to be precipitate. By August 1877 the Cape Frontier War had broken out: since the annexation of the Transvaal, the Zulu were now fighting the British rather than the Dutch. Frere firmly believed that an expansionist policy was essential if Britain were to secure South Africa. During 1878 the gap between Frere and the Colonial Office concerning objectives to be pursued widened, ultimately leading to the disastrous Anglo-Zulu War. Disraeli wrote in September to Lady Bradford, &#145;if anything annoys me more than another, it is our Cape affairs, where every day brings forth a new blunder of Twitters [Carnarvon's nickname]&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Letters of Disraeli to Lady Bradford and Lady Chesterfield</span>, ed. marquess of Zetland, 1929, 2.189).<br>
<br>Earlier, in January 1875, Carnarvon's wife had died, leaving four children, the eldest aged ten and one still a baby. On 5 November that year, Disraeli offered Carnarvon the post of viceroy of India in succession to Northbrook. While still contemplating this offer, Carnarvon was asked eleven days later to replace the incompetent Ward Hunt as first lord of the Admiralty. However, in a &#145;considerable talk&#146; with Disraeli, Carnarvon stated that &#145;affairs at the Colonial Office were such and so critical that it would be unfortunate <i>now</i> to remove me&#146;  (journal, 18 Nov 1875, BL, Add. MS 60907).<br>
<br>While the problems of South Africa were still to be resolved, Russia declared war on Turkey on 24 April 1877. Carnarvon, who was deeply suspicious of Disraeli's Turcophilism, was an outspoken critic of the policy being pursued. Supporters in the cabinet were few. Salisbury, who agreed with Carnarvon, adopted a more cautious approach, placing the unity of the party first. Derby, the foreign secretary, meanwhile was revealing cabinet secrets to the Russian ambassador, Shuvalov, though disagreeing with Disraeli's policy, which would bring Britain into conflict with Russia. Disraeli, reporting to the queen on Carnarvon, stated that &#145;for his part the amelioration of the Xtian subjects of the Porte is the chief object that he presents to himself&#146;. The queen minuted to Sir Henry Ponsonby, &#145;This is disgraceful&#146;  (Blake, 622). Disraeli's concern was that, while not wishing to see Russia defeat Turkey, nevertheless he did not want to be left out of a partition of European Turkey.<br>
<br>Carnarvon supported a policy of strict neutrality: on 30 April 1877 he announced in the Lords that such a policy would be followed in eastern Europe. Towards the end of the year, as Russian advances continued, Russophobe feelings rose to a new height. Carnarvon made a speech to a deputation on 2 January 1878 which received widespread coverage in the national press. In it he declared, &#145;I apprehend that there are very few people now who look back upon that war [the Crimean War] with satisfaction, and I am confident that there is nobody insane enough in this country to desire a repetition of it.&#146;<br>
<br>Carnarvon was rebuked by Disraeli when the cabinet met the following day, and Carnarvon indicated that he might resign. Efforts were made to persuade him not to do so. Meanwhile he wrote to Salisbury:<blockquote>I not only do not wish you to leave with me&#151;if it comes to this&#151;but I doubt whether it is wise for you to do so. The point is quite sufficient for one person to stand upon; but perhaps not large enough for three. (3 Jan 1878, Hatfield House MS 3M/F)</blockquote>On 7 January Carnarvon apologized at the cabinet meeting amid great relief from his colleagues. However, with the report on 23 January that the Russians were advancing on Gallipoli, Disraeli ordered the fleet to the Dardanelles. At the cabinet meeting that day, Carnarvon, along with Derby, resigned. In a detailed speech in the Lords on 25 January Carnarvon justified his conduct, at the same time publicly regretting leaving many issues relating to his office incomplete and unsettled.<br>
<br>During the course of his public life that year Carnarvon travelled to Edinburgh to address the Edinburgh Philosophical Institute on imperial administration (5 November). On the way he revisited his mother's former home at Greystoke Castle, Cumberland. There he met his cousin, Elizabeth Catharine (<i>d</i>. 1929), eldest daughter of Henry Howard; he married her six weeks later at Greystoke on 26 December 1878. The union, which produced two sons, one of whom was the diplomatist and traveller <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37534/', "Aubrey Nigel Henry Molyneux Herbert")</script>, brought Carnarvon great happiness.<h2>
<a name="Parliamentaryreform18841885"></a>Parliamentary reform, 1884&#150;1885</h2>To some extent, Carnarvon was now an isolated figure. In his journal at the end of 1879, he wrote, &#145;There has been extreme bitterness during the last two years towards me and many of the cabinet and their supporters. All intercourse has ceased and hardly a letter ever passes&#146;. He considered his position if, as seemed likely, the Liberals took office. As for Gladstone: &#145;I have far more in common with him than most living statesmen&#146; and socially and intellectually Carnarvon admitted to sharing many views with him. &#145;Morally I feel quite free to act, as I may think best; politically I believe there is a road open to me in either direction&#146;  (journal, 29 Dec 1879, BL, Add. MS 60913). Three years after Gladstone formed his second ministry, Edward Hamilton, then Gladstone's principal private secretary, reported a conversation with Lord Bath: &#145;He tells me he knows for certain that Lord Carnarvon was disappointed at not being asked to join the Government when it was formed &hellip; His disappointment, however, has subsequently turned into very open bitterness against the Government&#146;  (diary, 3 Feb 1883, BL, Add. MS 48633, fol. 43).<br>
<br>For a time, less conspicuous in politics, Carnarvon was called on to be chairman of the secret royal commission for the defence of British possessions and commerce abroad (1878&#150;81) which undertook a comprehensive review of imperial defence. Carnarvon was irritated at Gladstone's failure two years later to follow up its recommendations, observing in the Lords his suspicion that the report had been &#145;consigned to the pigeon-hole&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 278, 1883, cols. 1831&#150;5). Reconciliation with Disraeli took place in May 1881, when Carnarvon returned to the front opposition bench. On the third reading of the <span class="roman">Irish Land Bill</span> in August, Carnarvon expressed his reservations on the experiment which, if it failed, could lead to repressive measures or civil war  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 264, 1881, cols. 1180&#150;86).<br>
<br>Carnarvon played a prominent role in Gladstone's <span class="roman">Franchise Bill</span> of 1884 which would give the vote to 2 million more people. In a speech in the Lords on 8 July, Carnarvon opposed the bill, arguing that parliament would become &#145;less and less a true mirror and true representation of the people&#146;. The bill was rejected by the Lords: Gladstone withdrew the bill on 10 July, promising to reintroduce it in the autumn session. Carnarvon, along with other Conservative leaders, organized mass meetings throughout the country which they addressed. The high point was at Nostell Priory, Yorkshire, where he and Northcote addressed an enthusiastic audience of 40,000&#150;50,000 people. Salisbury's handling of the crisis drew criticisms from Carnarvon, demonstrating how far the two men had drifted apart. &#145;One thing is very clear to me&#146;, wrote Carnarvon in his journal:<blockquote>Salisbury has not the confidence of those who follow him or who are supposed to be his colleagues and advisers. The first he alarms by his supposed rashness. The latter he alienates by seeming to distrust them &hellip; Time will show but I am afraid that with all his great gifts he will be a failure and may even do mischief (18 July 1884, BL, Add. MS 60923)</blockquote>At a meeting in October, Carnarvon suggested that the redistribution question be referred to three or four impartial men who had the confidence of both parties. Both Gladstone and the queen were favourable to this suggestion and Carnarvon was involved as the broker between the parties, despite Salisbury's initial opposition to compromise and conciliation. When it was announced on 17 November that the government was to make an announcement of its intentions on the matter, Carnarvon was one of twelve Conservative peers called by Salisbury to meet at his house the following day. Subsequently, Salisbury entered into direct negotiations with Gladstone: on 4 December the bill passed through the committee stage in the Lords with little discussion. A pleasing aspect of the outcome for Carnarvon was the recognition by the queen of his part in the proceedings in the form of an invitation to Windsor. &#145;It is evidence&#146;, he recorded in his journal, &#145;of a reconciliation on her part after nearly six years of absolute silence&#146;  (journal, 8 Dec 1884, BL, Add. MS 60923).<h2>
<a name="LordlieutenantofIreland18851886"></a>Lord lieutenant of Ireland, 1885&#150;1886</h2>One of the major decisions facing the minority Conservative government when it was returned, headed by Salisbury, in June 1885 was the future of the <span class="roman">Crimes Act</span> in Ireland. The need to search for a compromise solution rather than the use of coercion in dealing with Parnell was paramount. On 15 June Salisbury offered Carnarvon the lord lieutenancy of Ireland with a seat in the cabinet: Carnarvon reluctantly accepted, stipulating that he would resign after the coming general election. Armed with the knowledge that the majority of his cabinet colleagues believed that Ireland could be ruled without coercion, Carnarvon visited that country in early July. On his return, he announced in a conciliatory speech in the Lords on 6 July that the <span class="roman">Crimes Act</span> would not be renewed and that a land purchase bill would be introduced. Salisbury was aware of Carnarvon's advocacy of a federal solution to Anglo-Irish relations.<br>
<br>That morning Carnarvon had a conversation with Justin McCarthy, the Parnellite leader, at the home of Howard Vincent, where it was suggested that Carnarvon might meet Parnell on Irish matters. Salisbury was informed of the proposal and, with his approval and that of Ashbourne, lord chancellor of Ireland, a secret meeting was arranged  (Hardinge, 3.174&#150;6). The interview took place, without witnesses, on 1 August in an empty house at 15 Hill Street, Mayfair. The exploratory discussion gave rise to optimism that agreement on a range of outstanding issues could be settled and Carnarvon drew up a memorandum of the meeting which he showed Salisbury the same day. As the lord lieutenant was acting on his own initiative, the cabinet was not informed of the meeting even though it was known to at least two of its members.<br>
<br>Carnarvon's regime in Ireland was a pacific one. He made a tour of the west in August, visiting remote districts where he was well received. The proper and efficient organization of the police was considered as well as the creation of industrial schools, the promotion of technical education, and an expansion of higher education, though he complained of the reluctance of colleagues to devote expenditure to these causes. There was a decline in agrarian crime. Salisbury, whose attitude towards Ireland differed considerably from Carnarvon's, made only vague references to the question in his Newport speech of 7 October. Later that month, Carnarvon threatened Salisbury with resignation unless home rule was considered but at length withdrew the threat. With increasing dissatisfaction at Salisbury's attitude towards Ireland, however, at a meeting at Hatfield on 13 December Carnarvon expressed his wish to resign. At a cabinet the following day when Ireland was discussed&#151;&#145;the result of which was that the Cabinet would do nothing and announce no policy&#146;  (journal, 4 Jan 1886, BL, Add. MS 60926), the matter of Carnarvon's resignation was raised. He was persuaded to defer his decision until after a vote of confidence was disposed of. On returning from Ireland on 13 January 1886, however, he read in that day's <span class="italic">Standard</span> the announcement of his retirement at the end of the month. Carnarvon attended his last cabinet meeting on 16 January, shortly before the Conservatives were defeated by Gladstone.<br>
<br>It was only on 7 June 1886 that the meeting of the previous year between Carnarvon and Parnell was revealed during a Commons debate. Parnell claimed he had been promised that a tory majority would have granted home rule. In his reply in the Lords, Carnarvon emphatically denied having given such a pledge, making no reference to Salisbury's implication in setting up the meeting  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 306, 1886, cols. 1256&#150;60). Carnarvon also expressed his belief in a limited form of self-government for Ireland: this statement was badly received by his party and when the new ministry was formed in July 1886 Carnarvon was not offered a post and his political career came to an end. He had already contemplated whether to accept a post if it were offered him. Noting the coldness of his former colleagues, he wrote, &#145;To accept would cure the seeming differences of opinion for the time: but if a break were afterwards to come it would be impossible ever again to mend the broken china&#146;  (journal, 5 July 1886, BL, Add. MS 60927).<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsanddeath"></a>Final years and death</h2>Carnarvon visited South Africa and Australia (August 1887 to February 1888), still taking a close interest in many aspects of colonial affairs. His health, which was never strong, began to fail and he died at his London house, 43 Portman Square, on 28 June 1890. He was buried on 3 July in the chapel which he had erected at Highclere.<h2>
<a name="Politicalandscholarlyreputation"></a>Political and scholarly reputation</h2>Carnarvon was a man of great sensibility and gentleness, though handicapped by an oversensitive nature. As Lord George Hamilton wrote of him, &#145;Possessed as he was by a great charm of manner, of eloquence and industry, yet he had a microbe of incurable fidgetiness in his composition. Three times in twenty years did he resign from office&#146;  (G. Hamilton, <span class="italic">Parliamentary Reminiscences and Reflections, 1886&#150;1906</span>, 1922, 10). He was more of an aristocratic whig than a party man, attracting enemies among his colleagues for his independence of thought. Carnarvon told Salisbury in 1878 at the height of the Turco-Russian crisis, &#145;You know me of old and that when once I have made up my mind on a question like this I am what my friends will call obstinate and my opponents perhaps something worse&#146;  (26 Jan 1878, Hatfield House MS 3M/E). His greatest accomplishment was the establishment of a federal constitution for Canada, though he was unsuccessful in South Africa and Ireland. Carnarvon's distrust of Disraeli was manifest at the time of the second <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> in 1867 and the Russo-Turkish conflict in 1876&#150;8. On both occasions, he preferred resignation to compromise. Carnarvon played a significant part in the negotiations leading to the passing of the <span class="roman">Franchise Bill</span> in 1884. His period as lord lieutenant of Ireland roused suspicions that he was more eager for home rule than many of his colleagues.<br>
<br>As a classical scholar, Carnarvon published a translation of Aeschylus's <span class="italic">Agamemnon</span> (1879) and of the first twelve books of Homer's <span class="italic">Odyssey</span> (1886); a posthumous work of his Oxford tutor, Dean Mansel, <span class="italic">The Gnostic Heresies of the First and Second Centuries</span> (1881); the unpublished letters of Lord Chesterfield (1890); and <span class="italic">The Herberts of Highclere</span> (1890). He was greatly interested in history and archaeology, writing a history of ancient Hampshire and on the archaeology of Berkshire. Carnarvon was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 15 March 1877 and was president from April 1878 to April 1885. His first action was to direct the society's protest against the destruction of parts of St Albans Abbey during its restoration. Carnarvon was also an active member of the Historical Manuscripts Commission from 1882 and a trustee of the British Museum. He was a firm believer in education based on the principles of the Church of England. At the same time, he held a true scientific education to be of the highest importance. Carnarvon gave many addresses on education to a variety of audiences, including the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science. He was also a prominent freemason. Carnarvon became lord lieutenant of Hampshire on 21 March 1887 and accepted a seat on the new county council after its formation on 20 November 1888.<br>
