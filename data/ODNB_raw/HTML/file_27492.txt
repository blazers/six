<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Todd,  Robert Bentley</span>  (1809&#150;1860), <span class="occ">physician and physiologist</span>, was born in Dublin on 9 April 1809, the second son of Charles Hawkes Todd (1782&#150;1826), professor of anatomy and surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, and his wife, Eliza Bentley (1786&#150;1862), daughter of a colonel in the Indian army. His father was a distinguished surgeon and teacher, an editor of the <span class="italic">Dublin Hospital Reports</span>, and a dedicated administrator and president of the college. Robert was one of nine sons and six daughters; all of his brothers went into the professions&#151;three into medicine, three into the church (one of these was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27491/', "James Henthorn Todd")</script>; 1805&#150;1869), and two into law, with one a solicitor and one a barrister.<br>
<br>Todd received his primary education at a local day school and from a private tutor, the Revd W. Higgins, later the bishop of Derry. Medicine, to which Todd so wholeheartedly devoted his life, was not his first choice as a career: he entered Trinity College, Dublin, in January 1825 planning to study law. However, when his father died in March 1826 at the early age of forty-three he left his large family with very little money. Todd was obliged to become an apprentice at the Richmond Hospital, Dublin, where his father had been surgeon and had taught. He graduated with a BA from Dublin University in 1829 and was already living in Charlotte Street, London, when he became a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in 1831.<br>
<br>Todd's background as a member of the Anglo-Irish professional establishment and his Irish liberal and medical education served him well in London. The Irish medical schools were among the most innovative and brilliant in Europe at that time, and in 1826, precisely when Todd was taking up his medical studies, Robert Adams and Richard Carmichael, two of the luminaries of Irish medicine of their generation, established the Richmond school of medicine and surgery at the hospital. Todd also studied under Robert James Graves from whom, he later said, he imbibed his taste for physiological inquiry. Physiology was only beginning to be taught in London in the 1830s but the Irish College of Surgeons had had a chair in anatomy and physiology since the end of the eighteenth century. Todd appreciated that the improvements in the microscope made in the 1820s provided the technology to move beyond the gross anatomy of the early physiologists. He accurately predicted that microscopic anatomy and organic chemistry, accompanied by careful observation of symptoms during life, would form the basis for future medical progress, and he therefore dedicated himself to becoming a &#145;physiological physician&#146;.<br>
<br>Todd had planned to spend a year studying in Paris but on receiving an offer to teach anatomy and physiology at one of the private schools of medicine, the Aldersgate School, he settled in London. He immediately began planning to study for academic medical degrees, and attended Oxford briefly; he received his MA in 1832, his BM in 1833, and his DM in 1836. Already in 1832 he was projecting his <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology</span>. He travelled to Paris in 1833, and made the acquaintance of some of the great French scientists whom he recruited as contributors to the venture. In the same year he became a member of the Royal College of Physicians of London.<br>
<br>In 1834 Todd left the Aldersgate School and joined a physician and two surgeons from the Westminster Hospital, London, in establishing a new private school, where he taught for the next two years. Todd and his colleagues put up approximately &pound;3000 to buy a building for this school, an indication that Todd had already established a successful private practice. During these years he became physician to the Western Dispensary and the Royal Infirmary for Children. In 1835 the first volume of <span class="italic">The Cyclopaedia</span> (5 vols., 1835&#150;59) was published, establishing Todd as a leading physiologist, and in August of 1836 he was elected to the chair of physiology and general morbid anatomy at King's College, London. A few months later, on 20 December, he married Elizabeth, daughter of the late J. H. Hart, of Tenerife, at Hemple, near Hull; they had four children.<br>
<br>A man of boundless energy and a fine administrator, Todd immediately began major changes in the medical school at King's. Medical education in the 1830s was largely private and students were not required to attend lectures or take examinations until their final qualifying tests, which many failed. They lived in rooms all over the city &#145;in the midst of its bustle and gaiety&#146;, and &#145;exposed to all its temptations&#146;, as Todd wrote in 1837 in a series of articles proposing a radical reform of medical education  (Todd, 11.337&#150;8). In Todd's view the existing system trained the future medical practitioners of England to be radical in politics, indifferent in religion, and half-informed in professional matters. Todd and his colleagues at King's believed that religious education was key to developing the moral and mental habits which would make medical students respectable and useful both in their professional work and in society at large. At the same time Todd stressed the importance of a sound scientific and clinical education. He believed that students should want to acquire knowledge for its own sake; grasping first principles and thinking for themselves rather than simply learning facts by memory in order to pass exams, as was then the practice. Todd started a system of keeping attendance records at lectures, and, working with the clergy at King's, he introduced a residential collegiate system, modelled on that at Oxford and Cambridge; this was the first such medical college in England; in 1842 Todd became its first dean. He also was responsible for establishing the first scholarships for medical students in England.<br>
<br>The King's medical school had no clinical facilities when Todd arrived in 1836. Todd's conviction that clinical teaching was the only way to gain practical medical knowledge led, in 1840, to the establishment of the first King's College Hospital, situated in the former St Clement Danes poorhouse in Portugal Street. An accomplished fund-raiser, Todd was also instrumental in building the second King's College Hospital, a model building which opened in 1861. By the 1850s Todd had achieved his goal of making King's both a leading clinical and academic medical school. Its students had a physiology laboratory, received their entire education within the college, wore caps and gowns, and were alone eligible to be clinical clerks, dressers, physician's assistants, and house surgeons to the hospital. These positions were awarded by examination, and could not be bought or achieved through apprenticeship as was still common practice elsewhere.<br>
<br>Todd's belief that a clinical hospital served the dual purpose of teaching academic medicine and providing the best possible care for the patients led him to undertake a second major and lasting reform, that of nursing. In 1848 a group of prominent Anglicans, whom Todd had recruited, established the first training school for nurses. The school, which became known as St John's House, took the form of an Anglican sisterhood and was based on the same principles as Todd's reforms of medical education. The school was residential and supervised by older, more educated persons. The sisters of St John's House were upper-class women&#151;&#145;ladies&#146;&#151;who received systematic training together with the working-class nurses in various teaching hospitals. Once trained, the sisters supervised and taught the pupil nurses, providing both religious education and practical bedside training, while doctors gave lectures on medical subjects.<br>
<br>By 1856 St John's House was able to take on the whole of the nursing at King's College Hospital. The new nursing service was unique in England and immensely successful. It became the model for nursing reforms in the 1860s and 1870s. St John's House was to be the main inspiration for Florence Nightingale's school, which opened at St Thomas's Hospital in 1860; Sister Mary Jones, &#145;Lady superintendent&#146; of St John's House from 1853 to 1868, became one of her principal mentors and dearest friends.<br>
<br>As with Todd's medical reforms, the aim of this seminal nursing reform was to improve the character of the working-class women who traditionally provided hospital nursing services by giving them systematic, professional education, and allowing them to achieve a better social position. For the lady nurses the goal was to provide a legitimate field of labour, either full-time or part-time. Socially it was a very radical move, for upper-class women lost their status as ladies if they worked at a regular job. It was also quite revolutionary for ladies to take the same training and work side by side in the wards with the working-class nurses. However, this nursing reform was characteristic of Todd and the broad-churchmen at King's, who fostered education for women and a corporate view of society. It is noteworthy that one of Todd's daughters, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37611/', "Bertha Jane Johnson")</script>, who married the Revd Arthur Johnson, was one of the most active members in the circle that established the women's colleges at Oxford. She was the first principal of Oxford home students from 1893 to 1921.<br>
<br>Todd became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1837, a fellow of the Royal Society in 1839, a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1844, and one of the first physicians to King's College Hospital. At the Royal College of Physicians he gave the Goulstonian lectures in 1839, the Croonian lectures in 1842, and the Lumleian lectures in 1849&#150;50. Todd was a great clinical lecturer as well as an internationally known researcher and a leading medical practitioner in London. In 1853 his growing private practice forced him to resign his chair. In order to keep his services, King's rescinded the rule that a physician to the hospital must be a college professor.<br>
<br>Todd's associates spoke of the enormous workload which he was able to carry and always mentioned his kindness and generosity. Sir William Bowman called him his &#145;loved and honoured friend and workfellow&#146;, describing him as having a fine countenance, excellence of heart and life, and as a man who was warmly loved by his students (W. Bowman, <span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 2, 1866, 190&#150;91; <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 6 Feb 1860). Apart from the work which he constantly encouraged and supported among others, Todd's own contributions to medical knowledge were significant. In his time cerebro-vascular accidents were thought to be the cause of all paralyses. Todd demonstrated that epileptic seizures often caused a paralysis from which the patient could recover completely, within a matter of days (&#145;Todd's paralysis&#146;). He introduced the concept of afferent and efferent nerves and identified astereognosis, the inability to recognize objects or shapes by touch. Todd was also the first to describe hypertrophic cirrhosis of the liver and the first to describe tabes dorsalis, defining locomotor ataxia as a distinct clinical entity and connecting it with the lesions in the posterior columns of the spine.<br>
<br>Todd was also a leader in the movement which did away with the old depleting therapies of scant diets, bleeding, salivating, purging, and vomiting. Rather he advocated upholding the vital powers with food and stimulants. In his later years he considered alcohol the natural food of the nervous system and prescribed it with increasing enthusiasm&#151;sometimes as much as 30 ounces of brandy a day. This practice was heavily criticized by many of his colleagues, and may explain why a man so pre-eminent in his own time was later largely forgotten. Some thought that he lost more patients than other doctors as a result, while the medical students at King's thought he was dosing himself with large quantities of brandy to bolster himself against the strains of his extensive private practice.<br>
<br>Todd was a prolific writer. His letters and lectures appeared frequently in the medical press and he published three volumes of clinical lectures. The five-volume <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology</span> was considered his magnum opus, and it was still thought the most important work of its kind in England in the 1890s. <span class="italic">The Physiological Anatomy and Physiology of Man</span>, which he wrote together with William Bowman, was published between 1845 and 1857. It was the first text in physiology to describe the histology of the organs and tissues of the body in such minute detail, and its lucid style and fine microscopical detail immediately made it the standard authority in England and abroad.<br>
<br>Because of failing health Todd resigned as physician to King's College Hospital in December 1859. Six weeks later, on 30 January 1860, he died at his London consulting rooms in Brook Street, following multiple attacks of haematemesis. The post-mortem revealed advanced cirrhosis of the liver and congested and enlarged kidneys. Todd was buried on 4 February in Kensal Green cemetery, with more than two hundred of his former pupils following his coffin to the grave. His colleagues commissioned a marble statue of him which stands in front of the third King's College Hospital at Denmark Hill. Todd was survived by his wife and four children; their youngest child and only son, James Henthorn Todd (1847&#150;1891) was educated at Eton College and at Worcester College, Oxford. He served in the Bombay civil service.<br>
