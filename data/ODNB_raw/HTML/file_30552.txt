<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Balfour,  Arthur</span>, first Baron Riverdale  (1873&#150;1957), <span class="occ">steel maker and industrialist</span>, was, by his own account, born in London on 9 January 1873. For some years his parentage was a mystery. He went to Sheffield in 1882 as an &#145;orphan&#146; with Mary Fraser (1847&#150;1906), the daughter of a Scottish banker. Only in 1906 did he discover that she was in fact his mother. However, he never discovered the identity of his father. In later years, he stated that his father was Herbert Balfour, but this was a fiction concocted to ease the formalities of his peerage. He finished his education in 1887&#150;9 at Ashville College, Harrogate, and was afterwards employed in the office of Seebohm and Dieckstahl, a Sheffield crucible steel firm founded by German interests. His mother married Robert Schott, the head of the business, at about the same time.<br>
<br>Balfour went to the United States for a few years to enlarge his experience, and did well at a foundry in Buffalo, New York, where he rose from the shop floor to be manager. He thus began early the interest in overseas trade for which he and his firm became famous. (By the end of his career he had made seventy-three journeys by sea to America.) He returned to Sheffield in 1897, and in 1899, when the firm became a limited company with a capital of &pound;150,000, he was appointed Schott's successor as managing director, taking over also the post of local vice-consul for Denmark. In the same year Balfour married Frances Josephine (<i>d</i>. 1960), daughter of Charles Henry Bingham, a partner in the local silver and electroplate firm of Walker and Hall. He chose a world tour for his honeymoon, opening new branches for his firm. The couple had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Seebohm and Dieckstahl was a typical Sheffield small-scale tool steel maker, with a mainly European and American trade, and with a product-line that included rifle steels, and engineering steels and tools. Largely because of Balfour's awareness of American developments, his firm was one of the first two in Sheffield to develop high-speed steel in 1901. The company prospered, establishing a research laboratory in 1905 and selling in the United States considerable quantities of tool steels. The engineers' tool department established in 1910 became the most considerable of the company's activities. The name of the firm was changed in 1915 to Arthur Balfour &amp; Co. Ltd, reflecting Balfour's place at its head and also his sensitivity to its old German name.<br>
<br>From 1911 when he was the master cutler (one of the youngest holders of the office), honours and interests came to Balfour yearly. He chaired a committee to deal with the new national insurance in Sheffield in 1912; he was a member of the royal commission on railways in 1913, and in 1914 became a member of the advisory committee on war munitions and of the industry advisory committee to the Treasury, on which he served until 1918. While his company stepped up its output of tool steels for the war effort, Balfour played a leading part in 1915 in establishing High Speed Steel Alloys Ltd in Widnes, a consortium which aimed to make the Sheffield steel industry independent of Germany for its supplies of tungsten powder. In 1915 he was also made consul for Belgium, and undertook much work for the 9000 Belgians who were given asylum in his district. He was a member of the manpower committee, the Advisory Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (of which he was chairman in 1937&#150;46), the engineering industries committee, and the committee on commercial and industrial policy after the war under Lord Balfour of Burleigh. On a visit to Italy he had a long talk on the prospect of her entry into the war with the prime minister, Salandra, who thought his country unable to stand a long war.<br>
<br>The era of steadily rising profits and expansion for Arthur Balfour &amp; Co. came to an end in the inter-war period. The US market became too competitive and was restricted by the Fordney McCumber Tariff of 1921. Arthur Balfour and leading representatives of the Sheffield high-speed steel trade travelled to Washington to protest, Balfour himself testifying before the US senate in 1921, but this proved unavailing. New initiatives were needed and Balfour reacted to the increasing self-sufficiency of the USA and Europe by opening new accounts in China, Japan, India, and South America, and the firm's business in the important Australian market was further extended. Although the early 1930s slump proved to be a difficult time for the company&#151;its losses between 1930 and 1932 totalled nearly &pound;50,000 and the company was heavily overdrawn at the bank&#151;it had broadly maintained its place as one of the leading producers of high-quality steel and tools. The recovery of the export position at Balfours represented a considerable achievement for such a family firm, and the indefatigable travels and salesmanship of Arthur Balfour (alongside the efforts of his brother Bertram, and Bertram's son, Gerald) played a large part.<br>
<br>During the period of reconstruction after the war Balfour served on the coal industry commission (1919) and the therm charges committee (1922&#150;3), and on the advisory councils of the Post Office, the Board of Trade, and the department of overseas trade, as well as on the safeguarding of industries permanent panel. In 1923 he was British delegate to the international conference on customs and other formalities, and also a member of the government committee appointed to draw up the agenda for the Imperial Conference.<br>
<br>Perhaps Balfour's most important industrial appointment was as chairman of the committee on industry and trade between 1924 and 1928. The final report, which appeared in 1929 in six volumes, contained a searching examination of the country's industrial competitiveness and made recommendations concerning the UK's future ability to compete in overseas markets. It was one of the ironies of Balfour's career that his own company (and other Sheffield tool steel firms, some of which were called to give evidence) epitomized many of the problems that the committee had so extensively documented&#151;particularly in its small-scale structure, wide product range, and lack of selling organization overseas.<br>
<br>Balfour was a British delegate at the League of Nations economic conference of 1927; and in October 1930, as a member of the Economic Advisory Council, he wrote to the prime minister prophesying the severity of the approaching slump. A shrewd, if orthodox, economist, he had a staunch faith in retrenchment and a wholesome hatred of inflation. He continued to serve, often as chairman, on committees and advisory bodies right up to the threshold of war, and he led the commission which went to Canada in 1939 to negotiate the scheme for training Royal Air Force pilots there. Knighted in 1923, he was raised to the baronetcy in 1929, and became Baron Riverdale of Sheffield in 1935, the first Sheffield industrialist to receive this honour. He took the title from his home, Riverdale Grange, on the wooded slopes of western Sheffield. Besides his leadership of Arthur Balfour &amp; Co. and its subsidiaries, Balfour was a director of six other companies. He also served on several Sheffield trade bodies, as a JP, and, for a short time, on the city council. The University of Sheffield conferred on him the honorary degree of LLD in 1934.<br>
<br>Riverdale was an influential figure, who successfully promoted overseas trade, both in his own business and as a national policy. Yet the reason for his great reputation is not readily apparent. He left few papers and is rarely mentioned in reminiscences. In his prime, a tall, robust man of 15 stone, he seemed to thrive on being ever busy and active. Riverdale's son <a href="#cosubject_70122">Robin [<i>see below</i>]</a>, in a candid portrayal of his father, stated:<blockquote>If my father had any failings, they were that all his interests were in the same field, related to business; and, like so many Sheffield steelmasters, he carried on working too long &hellip; [and] &hellip; towards the end of the [Second World War], by which time he was in his early seventies, the pressures of a lifetime's constant labour of body and mind caught up with him. (&#145;Lord Riverdale remembers&#146;, <span class="italic">Quality</span>, Sept&#150;Oct 1984, 33)</blockquote>Riverdale had a serious breakdown and was never the same again, though he remained chairman of the company until his death. After a period of steady physical and mental decline, he died at his home in Sheffield on 7 July 1957, and was cremated.<br>
<br>Riverdale was succeeded by his elder son, <a name="cosubject_70122"></a><span class="headword">Robert Arthur <span class="st"> [Robin]</span> Balfour</span>, second Baron Riverdale  (1901&#150;1998), <span class="occ">steel maker and industrialist</span>, who was born on 1 September 1901 in Sheffield and was educated at Aysgarth School and Oundle School, which he left in 1918 to join his father's firm. He became a director in 1924. His greatest interest was in the scientific and technical aspects of steel making. His obituarist in <span class="italic">The Times</span> described him and his father as &#145;a near-perfect team. Balfour senior was a natural businessman who was happiest drumming up orders overseas and in this country, while Robin took care of the technology at home&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 July 1998). During the Second World War he served as an officer in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, seeing action in <i>Ark Royal</i> off Dakar in the operation to sink warships of Vichy France. After the war he returned to the family business, becoming managing director in 1949 and chairman after his father's death in 1957. Following the amalgamation of Arthur Balfour &amp; Co. Ltd with its fellow Sheffield steel firm Darwins to form Balfour Darwins, he was chairman of the latter (1961&#150;9) and then president (1967&#150;75).<br>
<br>Riverdale was a director of numerous companies, including Yorkshire Television and the National Provincial Bank. Active in many committees and organizations both locally and nationally, he was master cutler in 1946, president of the Sheffield chamber of commerce in 1950 (and a member of the executive council of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce thereafter), and for more than fifty years Belgian consul for the Sheffield area. A keen yachtsman, he was known as &#145;Twin Keel Balfour&#146; for his design of a twin-keeled yacht. He was also a motoring enthusiast, and lovingly restored a Sheffield Simplex car (built at Tinsley, though discovered in Australia), which he drove from Land's End to John o' Groats. In his <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry he described himself as &#145;a Churchman and a Conservative&#146;. He married on 1 September 1926 Nancy Marguerite Rundle (<i>d</i>. 1928), daughter of Rear-Admiral Mark Rundle. They had one son, Mark (1927&#150;1995), who succeeded his father as managing director of Balfour Darwins and was chairman of Sheffield Rolling Mills Ltd. Following his first wife's death Robin Balfour married, on 9 February 1933, Christian Mary (<i>d</i>. 1991), daughter of Major Rowland Hill, an army officer. They had a son, David (<i>b</i>. 1938), and a daughter, Frances (<i>b</i>. 1946). In retirement Riverdale wrote three books, <span class="italic">Squeeze the Trigger Gently</span> (1990), about deer-stalking, <span class="italic">A Life, a Sail, a Changing Sea</span> (1996), about yachting, and his autobiography, published posthumously in 1998, <span class="italic">Nine Lives in One</span>. He died on 26 June 1998, and was succeeded as third baron by his grandson Anthony Robert Balfour (<i>b</i>. 1960). By this time the steel firm had passed out of family control, having gone through several further mergers.<br>
