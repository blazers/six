</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thomson,  James</span>  (1700&#150;1748), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 11 September 1700 (and baptized on 15 September) in the village of Ednam, 2 miles north of Kelso, Roxburghshire, the son of Thomas Thomson (<i>c</i>.1666&#150;1716), a Presbyterian minister, and Beatrix Trotter (<i>d</i>. 1725) of Fogo, Berwickshire, who was distantly related to the noble house of Hume. Thomas Thomson, son of Andrew Thomson, gardener, was educated at the College of Edinburgh, ordained as a Presbyterian minister, and in 1692 appointed to his native parish.<h2>
<a name="InScotland17001725"></a>In Scotland, 1700&#150;1725</h2>James was the fourth child of Thomas and Beatrix, in a family of four boys and five girls. Eight weeks after his birth his father was admitted minister of Southdean, close to the English&#150;Scottish border. This hamlet was on the upper reaches of Jed Water in the wide bare foothills of Cheviot where snow would lie until April; it was mostly a harsh landscape, but the scenery was more gentle northwards towards Jedburgh and the dales of Teviot and Tweed. Here the future poet of <span class="italic">The Seasons</span> received his first impressions of nature.<br>
<br>Thomson perhaps attended the parish school in Southdean before being sent, about 1712, to the ancient grammar school that was housed in a transept of the abbey church at Jedburgh. He was a mediocre scholar, but began to write poetry under the encouragement of two men&#151;the scholar, poet, farmer, and (from 1717) Presbyterian minister Robert Riccaltoun (1691&#150;1769), and Sir William Bennet (<i>d</i>. 1729), a whig laird who was also a patron of Allan Ramsay (1686&#150;1758). In autumn 1715 Thomson entered the College of Edinburgh. On 9 February 1716 his father died, probably of an apoplectic stroke, though local legend said he was struck by a ball of fire while carrying out an exorcism. Thomson completed his arts course at Edinburgh (Latin, Greek, logic, metaphysics, ethics, and natural science) by 1719, but did not choose to graduate. He entered Divinity Hall, Edinburgh, as a candidate for the Presbyterian ministry, supported by bursaries from the Jedburgh presbytery from 1720 to 1724. He studied divinity for over five years and performed the homilies, lectures, and other public exercises needed to qualify him for the pulpit, but also joined fellow collegians in secular literary clubs devoted to discussion and imitation of modern English authors. Among the lifelong friends he made at Edinburgh were the writers David Malloch, later Mallet (<i>d</i>. 1765), Patrick Murdoch (<i>d</i>. 1774), and William Paterson (<i>d</i>. in or after 1760).<br>
<br>Thomson's first published poems appeared in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Miscellany</span> (January 1720); one of them, &#145;Of a Country Life&#146;, a short georgic distantly modelled on John Gay's <span class="italic">Rural Sports</span>, anticipates in little <span class="italic">The Seasons</span>. Another poem, &#145;Psalm 104 paraphrazed&#146;, was seen in manuscript by the critic William Benson (1682&#150;1754), who said that if its author were in London he would meet with encouragement equal to his merit. David Malloch migrated to London in 1723 and had verse published there the following year. Encouraged by his example, Thomson sailed from Leith in February 1725.<h2>
<a name="ToLondonWinterSummerandNewton17251727"></a>To London: Winter, Summer, and Newton, 1725&#150;1727</h2>Thomson went to London almost certainly with literary ambitions, thinking of English ordination only as a last resort, but his first employment was as tutor to the four-year-old son of the poet Charles Hamilton, Lord Binning (1697&#150;1732), a post probably obtained through Hamilton's mother-in-law, Lady Grisell Baillie, a distant cousin of Thomson's mother. Through Malloch, who had now Anglicized his name to Mallet, and through introductions provided by well-wishers in Scotland, he soon made the acquaintance of English poets, including Richard Savage, Aaron Hill, John Dyer, and Alexander Pope, and influential expatriate Scots such as Duncan Forbes, the artist William Aikman, and the duke of Montrose, Mallet's patron. Aikman painted Thomson's portrait in 1725 or 1726. Thomson's mother died on 12 May 1725 in Edinburgh. He wrote an elegy upon her, but the most notable works from his first year in England were early versions of a &#145;Hymn on Solitude&#146; (influenced by Milton's <span class="italic">Il Penseroso</span>) and <span class="italic">Winter</span>, a blank-verse poem of nature description with devotional overtones, prompted by one of Riccaltoun's poems, perhaps &#145;A Winter's Day&#146;  (first printed in <span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 10, 1740, 256).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Winter</span> was published in April 1726 by John Millan, who, it was said, paid 3 guineas for the copy; it was dedicated to Sir Spencer Compton, speaker of the House of Commons, who tardily gave the author a present of 20 guineas. In June a second, revised and enlarged edition appeared, with a preface in which Thomson disparages satire and advocates sublime verse on lofty themes. By then he was writing <span class="italic">Summer</span> and had left Lord Binning's household in order to act as tutor to a young gentleman at Watts's academy in Little Tower Street. <span class="italic">Summer</span> was published in February 1727 and was dedicated to George Bubb Dodington&#151;like Compton, a prominent whig politician, but a far more generous and enduring patron. <span class="italic">Summer</span> is descriptive and devotional, but it is also the first poem in which Thomson gives prominence to the Newtonian scientific ideas he had encountered in his fourth year at Edinburgh and had grasped more surely at Watts's academy, where one of his colleagues was the mathematician James Stirling (1692&#150;1770). There is more Newtonian science in Thomson's next publication, a <span class="italic">Poem to the Memory of Sir Isaac Newton</span> (May 1727), dedicated to Sir Robert Walpole, who responded with a gift of &pound;50. Thomson's poem is an apotheosis rather than an elegy: it is a hymn on the works and wonders of almighty power in which the imagination follows Newton's soul on a great celestial voyage.<br>
<br>Shortly afterwards Thomson left Watts's academy, hoping to live by his pen. He acquired more patrons, notably Frances Seymour, countess of Hertford, and Thomas Rundle, future bishop of Derry, who introduced him to Charles Talbot (1685&#150;1737), solicitor-general. From 1727 Thomson was a regular summer guest at the country seats of Dodington, Talbot, and Lord and Lady Hertford. On his first visit to Eastbury, Dodington's mansion in Dorset, he met Voltaire, who later wrote of Thomson, &#145;I discovered in him a great genius and a great Simplicity, I liked in him the poet and the true philosopher, I mean the Lover of Mankind&#146;  (McKillop, 212). Johnson's assertion that Lady Hertford discontinued her invitations after Thomson's first visit to Marlborough Castle, Wiltshire, because he &#145;took more delight in carousing with lord Hertford and his friends than assisting her ladyship's poetical operations&#146; is not true  (Johnson, <span class="italic">Poets</span>, 3.287): Thomson's visits continued for more than ten years, during which he and the countess wrote a number of pleasing songs for one another. That said, Thomson was a keen and practised drinker.<h2>
<a name="SpringBritanniaSophonisbaandTheSeasons17281730"></a>Spring, Britannia, Sophonisba, and The Seasons, 1728&#150;1730</h2>In January 1728 Thomson issued proposals to publish <span class="italic">The Seasons</span> by subscription. This did not prevent him from publishing <span class="italic">Spring</span>, dedicated to Lady Hertford, on his own account in June 1728, apparently with little success, because in January 1729 the bookseller Andrew Millar bought up remainder copies and reissued them over his own imprint. January 1729 also saw publication of Thomson's first politically controversial poem, <span class="italic">Britannia</span>, which called for greater belligerence from the British government towards Spain. Four short poems of his, including the &#145;Hymn on Solitude&#146; and &#145;The Happy Man&#146;, a eulogy of Dodington, were printed in <span class="italic">Ralph's Miscellany</span> (April 1729) and he began to write his first play.<br>
<br>By writing for the stage Thomson associated himself with his friend Aaron Hill's project to revive high-classical tragedy. Thomson's <span class="italic">Sophonisba</span>, set in ancient Carthage and based on a story from the Second Punic War, opened at Drury Lane on 28 February 1730, and, though Johnson observed that in its splendid audience &#145;nobody was much affected, and that the company rose as from a moral lecture&#146;  (Johnson, <span class="italic">Poets</span>, 3.288), it had a moderately successful run of ten nights, giving the author three benefit performances. One line, &#145;Oh Sophonisba! Sophonisba Oh!&#146;  (III.ii.19), was promptly parodied as &#145;Oh Jemmy Thompson! Jemmy Thompson Oh!&#146; in an anonymous <span class="italic">Criticism on the New &#145;Sophonisba&#146;</span>, and, a year later, as &#145;Oh! <i>Huncamunca</i>, <i>Huncamunca</i>, oh!&#146;  (II.v.1), in Henry Fielding's <span class="italic">Tragedy of Tragedies</span> (1731), but Thomson was so little moved that he allowed the line to stand in all new editions of the printed play in his lifetime. The prologue to <span class="italic">Sophonisba</span> was written by Pope and Mallet and the play was dedicated to Queen Caroline, probably through the agency of Lady Hertford, who was a lady of the queen's bedchamber.<br>
<br>The queen also headed a glittering list of subscribers to <span class="italic">The Seasons</span> in June 1730. The subscription quarto edition, which was also sold to the public through the trade, was printed by Thomson's friend Samuel Richardson and illustrated by engravings after William Kent. The poem now included &#145;Autumn&#146;, dedicated to Arthur Onslow, Compton's successor as speaker, and a concluding &#145;Hymn&#146;, as well as revised, enlarged texts of the three previously published &#145;Seasons&#146;. The general tendency of the revisions, despite the addition of a pantheistic &#145;Hymn&#146;, is to make the poem more secular; it is more excursive, patriotic, and overtly whiggish than the earlier texts.<br>
<br>By the middle of 1730, five years after leaving Scotland, Thomson had achieved a measure of fame and fortune. He had received royal notice as playwright and poet, he enjoyed the friendship and respect of men of wit, and the support of some discriminating patrons; his <span class="italic">Seasons</span> had attracted 457 subscriptions at 1 guinea or more each, and he had profited from three author's benefit nights in the theatre and the sale of copyrights to booksellers: <span class="italic">Spring</span> and <span class="italic">Sophonisba</span> for &pound;137 10<i>s</i>. to Millar in January 1730 and all the other long blank-verse poems for &pound;105 to Millan in July 1729.<h2>
<a name="GrandtourandLiberty17301736"></a>Grand tour and Liberty, 1730&#150;1736</h2>From November 1730 to early 1733 Thomson was in France and Italy, with an allowance of &pound;200 p.a., as travelling companion of Charles Richard Talbot, eldest son of the solicitor-general. There are tantalizingly few surviving records of their travels, so the only places it is now certain they visited are Paris, Lyons, Rome, Florence, Naples, and Petrarch's Fontaine de Vaucluse, near Avignon. The only people it is now certain they met were English or Scots: Joseph Spence, John Forbes (son of Duncan), Lord Binning, and Lady Grisell Baillie. From this period there are only three surviving letters by Thomson and none to him, though Johnson testifies that Pope wrote to him:<blockquote>he had much regard for Thomson, and once expressed it in a poetical Epistle sent to Italy, of which, however, he abated the value by transplanting some of the lines into his <span class="italic">Epistle to Arbuthnot</span>. (Johnson, <span class="italic">Poets</span>, 3.291)</blockquote>Travel for the most part confirmed Thomson's patriotic insularity. Seeing Voltaire's <span class="italic">Brutus</span> acted in Paris made him wonder what ideas a French audience might take from an old Roman republican declaiming on liberty; nevertheless he was impressed by French public work and cultural achievements. In Italy he thought the statues and paintings were fine enough, but he was more struck by poverty and misery brought about by bad government, civil and religious, and a potentially beautiful landscape made barren. His next long poem, <span class="italic">Liberty</span>, was prompted by those impressions of Italy, but the only poem he is known to have written abroad is a moving elegy in heroic couplets on his friend William Aikman, the painter, who died in June 1731. On 27 September 1733 Charles Richard Talbot died, but his tutor was not forgotten by his father, who, on becoming lord chancellor a month later, appointed Thomson secretary of the briefs in the court of chancery. The income from this sinecure (after payment to a deputy to carry out the duties of the post) was said to be &pound;300 p.a., later reduced to a nominal &pound;100, of which Thomson received nothing.<br>
<br>Though Talbot was Walpole's lord chancellor, his relations with Walpole became strained in 1734; also his son William opposed Walpole in the Commons. Another of Thomson's patrons, Dodington, had gravitated to the opposition court of Frederick, prince of Wales. Government corruption at home had grown worse in the years when Thomson was abroad. Such factors drew him into the orbit of the prince, who, unlike his father, was an appreciative patron of literature. Thomson's new long blank-verse poem, <span class="italic">Liberty</span>, was therefore dedicated to Frederick. This whiggish historical narrative traces the rise and fall of liberty in ancient Greece and Rome and in modern Europe until its perfection in England at the revolution of 1688. The poem ends, however, as it had begun, among the ruins of Rome, with an implicit warning that luxury and political corruption might ruin even Britain. Thomson set great store by <span class="italic">Liberty</span>; so did Andrew Millar, who paid &pound;250 for the copyright in December 1734. The poem was published in five parts, three in early 1735, the remaining two a year later, and its ill-success is measured by a print order that diminished from 3250 copies of the first part to 1250 of the last two parts. Even so, Thomson wished to be known as the author of this poem, for his portrait by Stephen Slaughter shows him holding a drawing of personified Liberty. Verses by G. W. (probably Gilbert West, (1703&#150;1756)) on this portrait appeared in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>  (1st ser., 6, 1736).<h2>
<a name="RetreattoRichmondPoemtoTalbot17361737"></a>Retreat to Richmond: Poem to Talbot, 1736&#150;1737</h2>After returning from the continent in 1733 Thomson lived in or near the Strand, close to where he had lodged on his first arrival in London eight years earlier. By April 1736, though, he had moved to a cottage in Kew Foot Lane, in the fashionable village of Richmond, from which (being no horseman) he regularly walked to visit friends in London, 9 or 10 miles away, with The Doves inn at Hammersmith as his customary watering hole. Other friends were closer to hand, such as Pope at Twickenham and Mallet at Strand on the Green. Thomson was often visited by Pope, dressed in a light-coloured greatcoat which he commonly kept on in the house, and Thomson was always admitted to Pope, whether he had company or was alone.<br>
<br>Most of Thomson's relatives were in Scotland, but were not forgotten. He gave his younger unmarried sisters, Jean and Elizabeth, capital to enable them to set up a milliner's shop in Edinburgh and he funded medical treatment for his youngest brother, John, who died in September 1735. A death with more effect on Thomson's pocket was that of his patron Charles Talbot on 14 February 1737. Talbot's successor as lord chancellor was Philip Yorke, earl of Hardwicke, a closer ally of Walpole than Talbot had been. Thomson had moved with Talbot's son William into opposition. Consequently his secretaryship was not renewed by the incoming lord chancellor, though some early biographers claimed that he could have kept the post had he not been too indolent to reapply for it. Whether or not that was so, he lost no time in writing a long blank-verse, <span class="italic">Poem to the Memory of Lord Talbot</span>, dedicated to William, now Lord Talbot, and published by Millar in June 1737. In September of that year Thomson's congratulatory &#145;Ode&#146; to the prince of Wales, published in several newspapers less than a week after the prince was expelled from his father's court, stridently proclaimed Thomson's political position.<br>
<br>Thomson was habitually careless in money matters. There is a story that after he lost his secretaryship he was imprisoned for debt of nearly &pound;70 and released through the generosity of the actor James Quin. Certainly, the epicurean, witty Quin was a close friend of Thomson and a congenial spirit. So was the poet Richard Savage, whose notoriously irregular habits made him an impossible house guest for normal families. Their presence in Kew Foot Lane, or coming home drunk from The Castle inn, Richmond, at four in the morning, was a trial to Thomson's housekeeper, Mrs Hobart, but not to her bachelor master, who disliked regular hours and loved food, drink, and wit. Savage was master of ceremonies when Thomson was admitted freemason on 9 September 1737, along with two Scots bachelor poet friends, John Armstrong and William Paterson. It was about this time that Thomson was befriended by George Lyttelton, who would become his chief patron in the last decade of his life. Lyttelton, the prince of Wales's secretary, introduced Thomson to the prince, who interrogated him about his affairs and, receiving the reply that &#145;they were in a more poetical posture than formerly&#146;, allowed him a pension of &pound;100 per annum  (Johnson, <span class="italic">Poets</span>, 3.291).<h2>
<a name="OppositionplaywrightAgamemnonEdwardandEleonoraandAlfred17381740"></a>Opposition playwright: Agamemnon, Edward and Eleonora, and Alfred, 1738&#150;1740</h2>April 1738 saw the performance at Drury Lane of Thomson's second heroic tragedy, <span class="italic">Agamemnon</span>. The name part was taken by Quin, but he was not the leading character. As in Thomson's <span class="italic">Sophonisba</span>, the emotional and dramatic centre of the play is a woman: in this case Clytemnestra, played by Mary Porter. <span class="italic">Agamemnon</span> ran for nine nights (three author's benefit performances), but was never revived. It was heavily cut during the run in order to make it more acceptable to audiences who had no taste for the long declamations so typical of Thomson's plays. Two performances were by command of the prince and princess of Wales, and the printed play, published by Andrew Millar, was dedicated to the princess. Pope, who had written letters of recommendation to the theatre managers, appeared in a box on the first night and was recognized with a round of applause. He rarely attended the theatre: his presence on this occasion displayed his friendship for Thomson and his own politics. The evil counsellor in <span class="italic">Agamemnon</span> is all too clearly intended to represent Sir Robert Walpole, as Pope himself underlined a month later in his <span class="italic">Dialogue I</span>, line 51, when he cited Aegisthus as a name for Walpole.<br>
<br>Two slighter pieces of opposition polemic in 1738 were a reprint of <span class="italic">Britannia</span> and Thomson's preface to a cheap edition of Milton's <span class="italic">Areopagitica</span>, both published by Andrew Millar, who became Thomson's sole publisher when, in June 1738, he bought all of Millan's Thomson copyrights. Thomson dined with the arch-tory Bolingbroke at Pope's house in July 1738, but he was more often in the company of the opposition whig George Lyttelton, and he readily lent himself to the political literary campaign orchestrated by Lyttelton on behalf of the prince of Wales. Thomson was one of three opposition playwrights who, early in 1739, had tragedies ready for the stage: the plays were Mallet's <span class="italic">Mustapha</span>, Henry Brooke's <span class="italic">Gustavus Vasa</span>, and Thomson's <span class="italic">Edward and Eleonora</span>, all of which parade high-minded patriotic sentiments and denounce evil ministers.<br>
<br>Thomson wrote the prologue to <span class="italic">Mustapha</span>. He alludes to the play's political theme of the monarch, &#145;To the false herd of flattering slaves confin'd&#146;  (line 18), but his remarks on the psychological effect of tragedy more interestingly throw light upon the aim of his own work. His tragic muse is a &#145;Queen of soft sorrows, and of useful fears&#146;  (line 6); tragedy should make the good man better and the bad man repentant. Pope, who read <span class="italic">Edward and Eleonora</span> at this time, declared that Thomson excelled in the pathetic. Certainly this play is Thomson's most sentimental. It is based on the story of Prince Edward being stabbed by a poisoned dagger during the last crusade and his wife sucking the poison from his wound: so a woman is again at the drama's emotional centre.<br>
<br>On 16 March 1739 the acting of <span class="italic">Gustavus Vasa</span> was forbidden by the lord chamberlain: it was thus the first play to fall foul of the 1737 <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span>. Eleven days later, and two days before it was due to open at Covent Garden, <span class="italic">Edward and Eleonora</span> was banned too. This play was on the whole far less politically contentious than <span class="italic">Agamemnon</span>, but a few speeches in which, for instance, Prince Edward is begged to save his father and his country from evil ministers were undoubtedly provocative. As the stage licenser received the text of <span class="italic">Edward and Eleonora</span> as early as 23 February, his last-minute prohibition, after actors and theatre management had invested much time and money, was admonitory and vindictive. Thomson lost his benefit nights, but profited when he published subscription and trade editions of the play in May 1739. It was dedicated to the princess of Wales and carried a note about its prohibition, printed in Gothic lettering to remind readers of ancient liberties now at risk through the <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span>. <span class="italic">Edward and Eleonora</span> was first acted in 1775 and revived successfully several times in the last quarter of the century. John Wesley  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, 14 Oct 1772) thought it was Thomson's masterpiece.<br>
<br>The profit from <span class="italic">Edward and Eleonora</span> enabled Thomson to move to a larger cottage (with seven rooms and a kitchen), further down Kew Foot Lane and next to Richmond Gardens. His first production after this move was <span class="italic">Alfred: a Masque</span>, which glorifies the idea of a patriot king, implicitly embodied in Frederick, prince of Wales. This work was written in collaboration with Mallet and was first performed on 1 August 1740, by command of the prince, in the garden at Cliveden House, his country retreat on the Thames, near Maidenhead. The performers were professional actors, singers, and dancers from the London theatres; the music was composed by Thomas Augustine Arne. Earliest newspaper reports attribute the words solely to Thomson, but the advertisement to a revised version published over Mallet's sole name in 1751, after Thomson's death, suggests that he wrote the larger share of the 1740 text also. This is probably true, though Mallet on other occasions was not above claiming other men's work as his own. What is beyond dispute is that Thomson wrote the words of the best-known song in <span class="italic">Alfred</span>: &#145;Rule Britannia&#146; [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68196/', "Britannia")</script>].<h2>
<a name="CourtshipandrevisedSeasons17411744"></a>Courtship and revised Seasons, 1741&#150;1744</h2>Thomson now enjoyed an uncertain but not inconsiderable income from his writings and pension, though he was notoriously careless about money: he lived on long credit, settling his accounts erratically but generously. His indolence was well known. It was said that, at Eastbury, he ate the ripe side of peaches hanging on the tree, without taking his hands from his pockets. Also that, at home in Richmond, he was found in bed one day at 2 p.m. by Charles Burney, the musicologist, who asked him why he was in bed at that hour and received the reply: &#145;I had no motive to rise&#146;  (<span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span>, 16 April 1790). In his forties Thomson was apparently settled into a confirmed, easy-going, self-indulgent bachelor's life of late hours, over-eating, and hard drinking with witty and sociable male friends. However, it seems that late in 1742 he fell in love with a Richmond neighbour. She was Elizabeth Young, sister-in-law of a Scots physician at Kew with whom Thomson was friendly. He declared his love in a vehement letter of 10 March 1743 and in a series of agitated letters and love lyrics through the following two and a half years.<br>
<br>Little is known about Elizabeth Young. It seems that she was red-haired, and that, like Thomson, she spoke with a broad Scots brogue. Further testimony is contradictory: she is described on the one hand as a quick-tempered, harsh-tongued tomboy, on the other as a gentle-mannered, elegant-minded woman. There is general agreement, though, that her mother (the widow of a naval captain) was a coarse, vulgar woman, and that she opposed the match because Thomson's financial prospects were uncertain. Reportedly, she said to her daughter, &#145;What! would you marry Thomson? He will make ballads and you will sing them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Universal Magazine</span>, 67, 1780, 368). Her daughter may have seen other objections too. For all his poetic sensibility, Thomson gormandized and drank heavily; he carried himself awkwardly, had run to fat, was negligent in his dress, and sweated copiously; his love letters are eloquent but perhaps too self-pitying to please a woman of spirit. There is no evidence that Elizabeth Young ever encouraged Thomson's advances, and the man she married&#151;a gallant, talented, tall, handsome, wealthy naval officer (a future admiral)&#151;was as unlike Thomson as can be imagined. Nevertheless she carefully preserved Thomson's letters: they are now in the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York.<br>
<br>Thomson's letters repeatedly assure Miss Young that his love for her will inspire him to overcome his indolent habits, and perhaps this was so (up to a point) because in the eighteen months following his proposal of marriage he wrote <span class="italic">Tancred and Sigismunda</span> and parts of <span class="italic">The Castle of Indolence</span> and <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span>; he also planned a tragedy on Socrates and revised <span class="italic">The Seasons</span>. This last project may have arisen from the reversion of copyright to Thomson fourteen years after the contracts of 1729&#150;30. It was a very thorough revision, some of which was done at Hagley Hall, Worcestershire, where Thomson was the guest of George Lyttelton in August and September 1743. The manuscript of these revisions shows many by Lyttelton, generally in the interests of decorum or metrical regularity. Thomson's compliance was remembered twenty years later by James Grainger (<i>d</i>. 1766), when he sent a poetical manuscript to friends and wrote: &#145;let Mr Shenstone know, that I can bear to have my verses butchered, as Thomson used to call it&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Illustrations</span>, 7, 1848, 279).<br>
<br>The revised edition of <span class="italic">The Seasons</span>, published in June 1744, was enlarged to include more georgic material, such as fishing in &#145;Spring&#146; and sheep-shearing in &#145;Summer&#146;, more tropical excursions (on fruits, beasts, sandstorms, hurricanes, plagues), and more compliments to opposition politicians. Additionally, hundreds of small revisions improved the precision, harmony, or vividness of the poem. Each &#145;season&#146; retained the verse dedication to its original patron&#151;Lady Hertford, Dodington, Onslow, and Compton&#151;but the whole work was now dedicated to Frederick, prince of Wales. With further minor revisions in 1745 and 1746, this was the text by which <span class="italic">The Seasons</span> became best known. It was influentially translated into German by Brockes (1745) and imitated in French by Saint-Lambert (1769).<h2>
<a name="TancredandSigismundaCoriolanusandasinecure17451746"></a>Tancred and Sigismunda, Coriolanus, and a sinecure, 1745&#150;1746</h2>Before the end of 1744 Thomson had completed <span class="italic">Tancred and Sigismunda</span>, a tragedy set in twelfth-century Sicily, with a complicated love-and-honour plot from Le Sage's <span class="italic">Gil Blas</span>. It was acted for nine nights (three author's benefit performances) at Drury Lane in March and April 1745, with David Garrick in the lead. Thomson wrote both prologue and epilogue: the latter was an unusual protest against customary flippant epilogues to serious plays. His new play marked the end of a development from <span class="italic">Sophonisba</span>, through <span class="italic">Agamemnon</span> and <span class="italic">Edward and Eleonora</span>, which drew Thomson away from the historical and heroic towards the melodramatic, sentimental, and domestic. After &#145;Rule Britannia&#146;, it proved to be his most popular work for the theatre: it was revived on the London stage in most seasons to the 1790s, was still being acted as late as 1819, and was translated into German in part by Lessing and by Schlegel.<br>
<br>Pitt and Lyttelton interested themselves in the first production by attending rehearsals and giving instruction to the players. As the play's political theme, insofar as it has one, is reconciliation rather than conflict, those quondam opposition patriots were making a political signal by their attendance: a point noted by satirists. Walpole had fallen in 1742; Lyttelton joined the new ministry under Pelham in December 1744 and Pitt lent his support to that ministry; both men withdrew from the prince of Wales's service. Thomson was still the prince's man to the extent that he dedicated the printed text of <span class="italic">Tancred and Sigismunda</span> (considerably longer than the successfully acted version) to Frederick. However, the eventual result of Lyttelton's defection from the prince's court was that Thomson lost his pension. It is not clear whether this occurred before or after May 1746 when, thanks to Lyttelton's influence in government, Thomson was appointed, jointly with his old college friend William Paterson, to the office of surveyor-general of customs for the Leeward Islands. Paterson went to Barbados and carried out the duties of the post for &pound;400 per annum while Thomson remained in Richmond and received, it was said, &pound;300 per annum as a sinecure.<br>
<br>With his added wealth Thomson doubled the size of his garden at Richmond, built a hothouse and greenhouse, and employed two nephews as gardeners. Here he continued to entertain old friends and new literary acquaintances, including William Collins and Joseph Warton. Aged forty-six Thomson had his portrait painted by John Patoun: it was an unprepossessing likeness, said by William Pitt to be &#145;beastly like&#146;. A new edition of <span class="italic">The Seasons</span>, with the author's last revisions, was published in May 1746: 4000 copies were printed&#151;more than any earlier edition of that poem (though Thomson's plays each sold 4500 copies).<br>
<br>Thomson completed <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span> before the end of 1746. This play's theme is the invasion of a country by one of its natives and it was written during and just after the Jacobite rising of 1745, but it contains no obvious reference to contemporary politics. Rather it is a series of cerebral debates upon the just war, the legitimacy of revenge, the individual person's duty to the community, and other such general politico-moral questions. Its lack of dramatic action may have deterred theatre managers, though Thomson and his friends blamed rivalry between Garrick and Quin as to who should take the role of Coriolanus for the fact that the play was not staged during the remaining eighteen months of Thomson's life.<h2>
<a name="LastyearsTheCastleofIndolence17461749"></a>Last years: The Castle of Indolence, 1746&#150;1749</h2>Thomson's <span class="italic">The Castle of Indolence</span>, published in May 1748, was conceived about 1733 as detached Spenserian stanzas satirizing himself and friends. By 1742, when Thomas Morell (1703&#150;1784), curate at Kew Chapel, wrote his Spenserian stanzas about Thomson's poem, its non-completion because of its author's indolence was a joke among those friends, some of whom are identifiable among the castle-dwellers in the completed poem. One of them, the physician John Armstrong (1708/9&#150;1779), contributed four stanzas on diseases resulting from indolence. Thomson himself is in the poem as a bard &#145;more fat than bard beseems&#146;  (canto 1, line 604). The castle is described seductively as an earthly paradise, presided over by a smooth-tongued epicurean wizard, but in the second canto of the poem it is overthrown by a stern and energetic &#145;Knight of Industry&#146;. Thomson's conventional message is that the penalty of Adam is hard, but idleness is worse. However, the poem also implicitly dramatizes a conflict between the didactic public poet and the romantic dreamer. Canto 1, stanza 40, has perhaps the earliest published reference in English to the Aeolian harp. This device is the subject of an ode by Thomson in the second edition of Dodsley's <span class="italic">Collection of Poems</span> (June 1748); Thomson's &#145;Hymn on Solitude&#146; and &#145;The Happy Man&#146; had appeared in the first edition (January 1748).<br>
<br>These were the last publications of Thomson's lifetime. Having overheated himself walking one summer evening from central London to Hammersmith, he took a boat for the rest of the journey to Kew and caught a chill, from which he had not fully recovered before he exposed himself once more to the evening dews. This brought on a tertian fever and then a malignant nervous fever, from which he died on 27 August 1748, at his house in Kew Foot Lane. His physician friends John Armstrong and William Robertson (brother-in-law of Elizabeth Young) were with him at the end. Thomson's remains were buried under a plain stone in the north-west corner of St Mary's Church, Richmond, on 29 August. It seems that the wake was as drunken as Thomson could have wished (see his <span class="italic">Seasons</span>, &#145;Autumn&#146;, 565&#150;9), for it is said that an unidentified clergyman &#145;boasted, that at a supper after Thomson's funeral, he left Quin drunk under the table, whilst he was able to walk home&#146;  (R. O. Cambridge, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 1803, 50n.).<br>
<br>Thomson died intestate and, it was said, hundreds of pounds in debt through ill economy. Letters of administration were granted to Lyttelton and to the diplomat Andrew Mitchell (1708&#150;1771) in the interest of Thomson's sisters Mary Craig and Jean Thomson, both still living in Scotland. <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span> was staged at Covent Garden; it ran for ten nights in January 1749, providing three benefit nights. Quin took the lead and unaffectedly wept as he spoke an emotional prologue written by Lyttelton. In May, William Collins's noble <span class="italic">Ode on the Death of Thomson</span> was published. Thomson's effects, including his library, were sold in May 1749, after which his house was bought by his friend George Ross, who enlarged it. Later, in the ownership of Admiral Boscawen's widow, the house was a shrine of literary pilgrimage; in the 1860s it was incorporated into the buildings of Richmond Royal Hospital. In February 1750 Millar issued a new edition of Thomson's <span class="italic">Works</span>, with many unauthorized revisions and cuts made by Lyttelton to the great confusion of later editors, but no doubt to the profit of Thomson's estate. Thus Thomson's debts were cleared and &#145;a handsome sum&#146; was remitted to Mary and Jean; this included &pound;200 paid by Millar in February 1751 for Thomson's latest copyrights. Seemingly, the generous Millar bought <span class="italic">Alfred</span> (which he regarded as Thomson's) and <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span> twice over.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>
<span class="italic">Tancred and Sigismunda</span> held the stage for over half a century, as did the last three acts of <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span>, conflated with two acts of Shakespeare in versions of <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span> by Thomas Sheridan (1752) and John Philip Kemble (1789). All six plays were often reprinted, almost invariably in Lyttelton's greatly impaired versions (the last example as recently as 1979), but one suspects that, like <span class="italic">Liberty</span>, they were little regarded. <span class="italic">The Castle of Indolence</span> contributed notably to the romantic vogue for Spenserian imitation and never lacked appreciative readers, but for most of the time since his death Thomson has been regarded primarily as the poet of <span class="italic">The Seasons</span>. Over four hundred editions of this poem, including translations, were published before the flood of reprints began to slacken in the 1870s. Coleridge found a little worn-out copy of <span class="italic">The Seasons</span> in the parlour of an obscure country ale-house and exclaimed &#145;<i>That</i> is true fame!&#146;  (W. Hazlitt, &#145;My First Acquaintance with Poets&#146;, <span class="italic">The Liberal</span>, April 1823).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Seasons</span> provided subjects for Haydn's oratorio and for artists as various as William Kent, Richard Wilson, Thomas Gainsborough, J. M. W. Turner, Henry Fuseli, William Etty, and Richard Westall. It did much to establish natural description as a proper subject and blank verse as a normal medium for long serious poems. Though not strictly a didactic or topographical poem itself, it gave impetus to a stream of blank-verse georgics and loco-descriptive poems in the second half of the eighteenth century. More significantly it was Thomson who, with Young and Cowper, showed how the sublimity of <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> might be reshaped and internalized to suit the intellectual and spiritual concerns of their own age, and thereby prepared the way for Wordsworth. After Wordsworth's death Thomson still had a large popular readership, but was no longer a significant influence upon other poets. At the beginning of the twenty-first century most general readers know Thomson only through short passages of <span class="italic">The Seasons</span> in anthologies. The chorus of &#145;Rule Britannia&#146; remains a kind of national anthem, but very few of its singers could say who wrote the words.<br>
<br>The earliest lives of Thomson were written by compatriot friends: Robert Shiels (<i>d</i>. 1753) in Cibber's <span class="italic">Lives of the Poets</span> (1753), and Patrick Murdoch in a subscription edition of Thomson's <span class="italic">Works</span> published by Millar (1762). Shiels, unusually among early critics, found in Thomson's <span class="italic">Castle of Indolence</span> &#145;more genius and poetical judgment than all his other works put together&#146;  (Cibber, 205). Subscriptions to Murdoch's 1762 edition and profits donated by Millar paid for the monument to Thomson, designed by Robert Adam and carved by Michael Spang, that stands between Shakespeare and Rowe in Westminster Abbey. Nearly fifty years later, thanks to the enthusiasm of David Steuart Erskine, earl of Buchan, a commemorative obelisk was raised on Ednam Hill, near Thomson's birthplace. Buchan was one of many eighteenth- and nineteenth-century writers who contributed to biographical information on Thomson, down to L&eacute;on Morel's thorough critical biography in 1895. Twentieth-century Thomson scholarship benefited most from McKillop's edition of the letters and his background studies. The fullest critical biographies to date are by Douglas Grant (1951) and James Sambrook (1991).<br>
