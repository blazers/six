<span class="headword">Scrope,  William</span>, earl of Wiltshire  (1351?&#150;1399), <span class="occ">soldier, administrator, and courtier</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24963/', "Richard Scrope, first Baron Scrope of Bolton (c.1327&#150;1403)")</script>, and Blanche de la Pole, sister of Michael, earl of Suffolk. He followed in the footsteps of his father in entering the service of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, joining the latter in expeditions to France in 1369 and 1373, and subsequently serving as seneschal under Gaunt in Gascony in 1390&#150;93. Even as late as 1398 Gaunt appointed William Scrope and Thomas Percy as his executors. Scrope's military experience is also said to have included campaigns in Italy and Prussia. There is no evidence that he held any part of the Scrope of Bolton estates during his lifetime. Instead, to an increasing extent, he made his career in the service of the crown, and the list of grants and annuities made to him from 1384 until his death indicate both his military and administrative skills and the reliance placed on him by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23499/', "Richard II")</script>. In 1384 Scrope received &pound;800 as steward of Aquitaine; in March 1385 he received &pound;500 for the stewardship of Calais; in April 1386 he was keeper of Cherbourg; in November 1389 he was keeper of Brest. After 1389 Scrope was more involved in events at home. In February 1389 he was granted the custody of Bamburgh Castle, later given to his brother Stephen Scrope. In April 1392 he bought the Isle of Man from the earl of Salisbury, and in July 1393 he was given Marlborough Castle for life in lieu of an annuity of 200 marks.<br>
<br>In February 1393 Scrope had begun a more intimate association with Richard II's administration, when he was appointed under-chamberlain of the king's household, and from February 1394 onwards he was given a number of major appointments connected with the Welsh borders and also with the pacification of Ireland, which was one of Richard's objectives in the latter part of his reign. He accompanied Richard II on his Irish expedition of 1394, and became the key official in the crown lands in the west. In February 1394 he was given the keepership of Beaumaris Castle and in March 1394, as under-chamberlain, he was required to examine the castles in north Wales and Chester. In the same year he became a knight of the Garter. In February 1395 he was appointed keeper of the lordship of Uriell, keeper of Drogheda, and keeper of Conwy Castle for &pound;40 per annum. In April 1396 he was appointed justice of Ireland, constable of Queensburgh Castle, joint keeper of Caernarfon Castle, and keeper of Pembroke Castle. In 1397 he was appointed keeper of the castle and town of Barnard Castle which was subsequently granted to him in tail male. He was also appointed keeper of Dublin Castle and of the castle at Painscastle in Wales. In 1398 he was keeper of Richmond Castle in the North Riding of Yorkshire and of the new forest of Richmond. He was appointed surveyor of forests in Cheshire, was given the constableship of Holt Castle, and appointed life justice of north Wales at &pound;100 per annum.<br>
<br>By this time Scrope was also keeper for life of the Isle of Anglesey, and held a dominant position in north Wales, built up in association with Richard II's plans to create a power base for himself in the region based on the palatinate of Chester, which in 1397 had been elevated into a principality. It was partly to the same end that Scrope benefited considerably from the forfeitures of the magnates hostile to Richard II. In 1397 he was granted the Welsh estates of the disgraced earl of Warwick, and in March 1398 Daliley Castle and Wellington Haye, Shropshire, forfeited by the earl of Arundel; he also became justice of the Arundel marcher lordships. He was given the wardship of the Mortimer lands in north Wales in August 1398. In March 1399 he was given Pickering Castle and the following month was made constable of Knaresborough Castle, both appointments from estates forfeited by Henry Bolingbroke.<br>
<br>William Scrope had become an invaluable servant to Richard II and he was among the members of a new nobility created by Richard who were closely identified with the king personally. On 29 September 1397 he was created earl of Wiltshire, the highest rank ever achieved by the Scrope family, and he was among those who appealed Gloucester, Warwick, and Arundel of treason in that year. He was subsequently given custody of Warwick on the Isle of Man and was accused of treating him cruelly. In the final years of Richard II's reign Scrope was deeply involved in the day-to-day administration of government. He had been appointed treasurer on 17 September 1398 and, together with a small group of other officers, oversaw most government business, including the retrospective fining of those who had sued for pardon for the events of 1387&#150;8. The events of 1399, when Richard II left for Ireland and Bolingbroke invaded England during his absence, with the resulting collapse of support for the crown, are well known. William Scrope fled to Bristol, but Bolingbroke captured him there and had him beheaded, on 29 July. His head was displayed on London Bridge until November 1400.<br>
<br>The contemporary view of William Scrope was almost universally hostile. The poem &#145;Richard the Redeless&#146; of <i>c</i>.1399, which puns on the names of the king's favourites, Scrope's among them, and describes them as &#145;kytes&#146; battening on the resources of the crown, shows that he was regarded as one of those courtiers to whom the profits of government in the last years of Richard II's reign were almost entirely confined. According to Thomas Walsingham a more wicked or cruel man would not easily be found. Even allowing for Lancastrian bias, Scrope was clearly a man who aroused particular antagonism. In 1389 William Scrope and his brother Stephen were bound over for 10,000 marks to do no harm to Walter Skirlaw, bishop of Durham (<i>d</i>. 1406), and on 24 January 1390 William offered a jewel worth &pound;500 to the shrine of St Cuthbert for trespasses done by him and his people in Durham. After Scrope's death several of those who had suffered at his hands appealed against his decisions, including the bailiffs of the exchequer, who had had their allowances of &pound;100 cut to &pound;7 by him.<br>
<br>The earldom of Wiltshire was a political creation which could not survive the deaths of the holder and his patron. The surviving members of the family did not have the means to sustain such an honour, and it was not until the nineteenth century that any attempt was made to restore it. There were no children from William Scrope's marriage with Isabel, daughter of Sir Maurice Russell of Kingston Russell in Dorset. William predeceased his father, and was survived by his brothers Roger, second Lord Scrope of Bolton (<i>d</i>. 1403), and Stephen (<i>d</i>. 1409).<br>
