<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Percy,  Henry</span>, second earl of Northumberland  (1394&#150;1455), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21931/', "Henry Percy (1364&#150;1403)")</script>, known as Henry Hotspur, who fell at Shrewsbury in 1403 in rebellion against Henry IV, and Elizabeth Mortimer (1371&#150;1417), eldest daughter of Edmund (III) Mortimer, earl of March, and Philippa, granddaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8519/', "Edward III")</script>. He was born on 3 February 1394.<h2>
<a name="Recoveringlostground"></a>Recovering lost ground</h2>Percy's early years were blighted by the consequences of rebellion, for although his grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21932/', "Henry Percy")</script>, the first Percy earl of Northumberland, presented him to Henry IV at Doncaster in June 1404, when the earl fled to Scotland in 1405 young Henry followed him and was detained for ten years by the duke of Albany, who treated the boy honourably. After Henry V's accession Percy was eager to return to England to recover his title and family estates, predominantly in Yorkshire, Northumberland, and Cumberland, with others in the south (including Petworth, Sussex). His rehabilitation may have been encouraged by the king's aunt, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53026/', "Joan Beaufort, countess of Westmorland")</script>, who in October 1414 arranged his betrothal to her daughter Eleanor Neville, the widow of Richard, Lord Despenser (<i>d</i>. 1414). Their children included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21951/', "Sir Ralph Percy")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50235/', "Thomas Percy, first Baron Egremont")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95127/', "William Percy")</script>, who became bishop of Carlisle. Percy petitioned Henry V for the reversal of his grandfather's attainder, and on 11 November 1414 he was restored in parliament to his entailed estates. Henry V welcomed reconciliation with the Percys, which would help to secure northern England and reduce a Scottish threat should the king embark on war with France.<br>
<br>The arrangements for Henry Percy's return were complicated. Henry V sought to exchange him for Murdoch Stewart, earl of Fife, the duke of Albany's eldest son and a prisoner in England; Percy agreed to pay the &pound;10,000 ransom required for Stewart. About the same time, however, the Southampton plotters against Henry V, including Sir Thomas Grey of Heaton, a north-country landowner, conceived the idea of seizing Stewart and themselves exchanging him for Percy, who could then bring a Scottish army to help the plotters overthrow Henry V. They seized Stewart on 31 May 1415 while he was being taken north to effect the king's exchange, but he was quickly recaptured, and the episode did not upset Henry V's arrangements to restore Percy, who was innocent of the plot, to a position in England. The final terms of this exchange were agreed on 1 July, and in February 1416 Percy crossed the border; on the way, at Berwick, he married Eleanor Neville. In parliament (April 1416) he did homage for his earldom, though as a new creation, thereby stressing the attainder of his grandfather and the king's act of clemency: Percy was then formally regranted his family's entailed estates and was knighted. In the years that followed, Northumberland tried to recover all the estates, though many had been granted away after their forfeiture. Most were eventually recovered, even if in some cases it took a long time, as with those granted to John, duke of Bedford (<i>d</i>. 1435), and his duchess; others were only recovered by his son, the third earl. Northumberland was therefore far from being the richest of English earls, and his additional grants from Henry V and Henry VI were modest. Yet the gross value of his estates at the time of his death in 1455 has been estimated at over &pound;3100, perhaps double the value of twenty years earlier.<h2>
<a name="Borderwarden"></a>Border warden</h2>Northumberland's service to Henry V was largely confined to the defence of the Scottish border. Although in July 1416 he went to Normandy on the king's service, he provided only a small contingent for the expeditionary force of 1417. Rather more important was his commission of the wardenship of the east march towards Scotland, to which he was appointed on 11 April 1417, with responsibility for Berwick Castle (of which the duke of Bedford was custodian). During the next seventeen years he negotiated with the Scots, raided southern Scotland, and strove to resist incursions into northern England. His first negotiation was authorized on 7 June 1417: his earlier contacts with Scotland and its politicians were doubtless considered an asset. But on 31 July, just as Henry V was embarking for France, he wrote to the king from Warkworth, one of his castles, to warn that his erstwhile captor, the duke of Albany, was preparing to attack Berwick. Weeks later Albany and the earl of Douglas did invade, attacking Berwick and Roxburgh; Northumberland helped to raise a force, and when the Scots retreated he pursued them across the border. During the king's absence in France, Northumberland supported Bedford in other ways, not least (as in November&#150;December 1417) in persuading parliament and convocation to grant subsidies for the war. When Henry V returned to England with his queen in 1421, Northumberland acted as steward at Catherine's coronation on 24 February, and he witnessed the king's new will at Dover on 10 June. But his most valuable service continued to be in the north. In June 1421 he was reappointed warden with the promise of &pound;2500 per annum in peacetime and &pound;5000 per annum in wartime to maintain his retinue; he had difficulty in securing regular payment from then until the end of his wardenship in 1434, when he surrendered his commission in exasperation.<br>
<br>Henry V's death meant that Northumberland was required to join the conciliar regime during Henry VI's minority. He was appointed a councillor on 16 November 1422, and frequently attended council meetings when his other responsibilities allowed. For much of the time he seems to have been in Bishop Henry Beaufort's circle, and Beaufort's loans were an important source of finance for the wardenship. A rare venture to the continent may have taken place after he was appointed in 1423 an envoy to the Council of Pavia; but his main preoccupation in the 1420s&#151;albeit a frustrating one&#151;was to negotiate with the Scots. He was involved in the discussions of 1423&#150;4 about ransoming the Scottish king, James I, who had been in English custody since 1406, and he accompanied James across the border in March 1424. In the following decade he tried to control cross-border warfare, investigating breaches of truces in 1426 and 1433, and accompanying Bishop (and now Cardinal) Beaufort to Berwick in 1429 to negotiate a new truce with King James. The king's council granted him &pound;50 for his efforts on the border on 18 February 1434; but the fact that in June 1434 he and his burgesses of Alnwick were authorized to build walls round the town after the Scots had burnt it demonstrates that the Scottish problem had not been solved. In 1434 he surrendered his warden's commission; two decades later he was still owed outstanding wages.<h2>
<a name="Northernpolitics"></a>Northern politics</h2>In these years Northumberland's links with the Neville family were amicable enough, and together they shared responsibility for protecting the border. In 1426 Northumberland bought the marriage of the young Ralph Neville, earl of Westmorland (<i>d</i>. 1484), and married him to his widowed sister, Elizabeth Percy; by May 1429 he was receiving a life pension from Cardinal Beaufort, the brother of Joan, dowager countess of Westmorland. Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury, was equally exasperated at the level of support given to him as warden of the west march; after he surrendered the wardenship, Northumberland and the earl of Huntingdon were jointly appointed wardens of both marches in July 1435, though they served for only one year. Such instability on the English side of the border led to further Scottish incursions. Outright war was in prospect by 1436, encouraged by the Burgundian attack on Calais. Northumberland may have raided into Scotland with Sir Robert Ogle, who was defeated at Piperden in September. James I besieged Roxburgh in August, but he was forced to retire when Northumberland advanced. This time, the government rewarded him with an annual grant of &pound;100 for life, and in 1438 truce negotiations were resumed.<br>
<br>After Henry VI came of age, Northumberland continued to serve as a royal councillor, and in July 1438 received an annuity of &pound;100 for life for attending council meetings. In 1441 he was on the commission of inquiry into charges of sorcery against the duchess of Gloucester. However, in the 1440s he was much occupied with the claims and franchises of a fellow councillor, Archbishop John Kemp of York, which impinged on Percy lands and rights in Yorkshire. Kemp was a formidable opponent, with the result that the earl was drawn into outbreaks of violence. In 1442 Percy retainers raided the archiepiscopal estates at Ripon and Bishopthorpe, and attacked Kemp's officials. The king's council intervened: Kemp appears to have had Henry VI's sympathy, and on 20 May 1443 Northumberland was ordered to surrender himself at the Tower of London, where he agreed not to travel more than 7 miles from London, unless it were to his manor at Dagenham, Essex; the archbishop's franchises were confirmed in 1444. Northumberland seems to have largely withdrawn from the council in the later 1440s, though he kept in touch with the court and may have spent much time in southern England; from 1443 he was involved in plans for the king's new college at Cambridge.<br>
<br>By 1450 Northumberland may have sympathized with criticisms levelled at the king's government. After the duke of Suffolk's murder he was appointed constable of England (25 May 1450) when certain governmental changes were made; though his military experience also commended him at this juncture. He was soon embroiled in Cade's rebellion, as one of the king's intermediaries sent to negotiate with the rebels at Blackheath in mid-June. He may also have sympathized with the duke of York's desire for reform in the autumn of 1450; on 11 September he was replaced as constable by the duke of Somerset when the royal courtiers reasserted themselves. Yet there is no sign that Northumberland approved of York's persistent criticism of the regime in the years that followed; in any case, in June 1452 he was commissioned again to treat with the Scots.<h2>
<a name="ThequarrelwiththeNevilles"></a>The quarrel with the Nevilles</h2>Northumberland's relations with the Nevilles deteriorated sharply in the early 1450s, as a result of the behaviour of younger members of the two families (especially <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50235/', "Thomas Percy, Lord Egremont")</script>, who was Northumberland's second son, and Sir John Neville) and the deepening political divisions at Westminster. By this stage Northumberland was spending an increasing proportion of his estate income on his retinue, while his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21934/', "Henry Percy, Lord Poynings")</script>, was warden of the east march and Salisbury had returned to the west march. By July 1453 the king was ordering Northumberland and Salisbury to maintain the peace and keep their sons under control, but matters reached a serious pitch with the marriage of Thomas Neville, Salisbury's son, to one of Lord Cromwell's two heiresses at Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire. Cromwell held two rich, former Percy manors&#151;Wressle, Yorkshire, and Burwell, Lincolnshire&#151;which might fall to the Nevilles as a result of this marriage. Such an eventuality would seriously hinder Northumberland's recovery of ancestral Percy lands and at the same time enrich his Neville rivals. A month later, on 24 August 1453, while the Nevilles were returning from the marriage, the younger Percys ambushed the wedding party, including Salisbury; a skirmish took place at Heworth, near York, between the earls' sons&#151;and some of Northumberland's retinue were involved.<br>
<br>On 8 October Northumberland and Salisbury were summoned to appear before the council and told to end their warlike activities. This was ignored, and Northumberland himself joined the Percy force that converged on Topcliffe to confront Salisbury and the Nevilles in October, though conflict was avoided. This lawlessness was made more serious by the involvement of the duke of Exeter, who claimed some of Lord Cromwell's estates in Bedfordshire and had his own political ambitions. Exeter allied with the Percys, especially when the duke of York, with whom the Nevilles were associated by 1453, was appointed protector of the realm in March 1454 during the king's incapacity. In 1454 Exeter raised his banner against York in the north and made common cause with the Percys. On 10 May 1454 Salisbury and Northumberland were again ordered to attend the council (on 12 June) to implement measures to restore order. Despite efforts to calm matters (including suspending all judicial process against Northumberland in July), little was achieved before the king's recovery at the end of 1454 and the confrontation between Henry VI and York at the battle of St Albans on 22 May 1455. Indeed, the early months of 1455 saw Northumberland identify himself decisively with the king's interests and those of the duke of Somerset, the enemy of York and the Nevilles. The Percy&#150;Neville feud in the north, along with the Somerset&#150;Neville feud in Wales, had been critical in alienating the Nevilles from the Lancastrian regime. Accordingly, at St Albans the Nevilles joined forces with York, and Northumberland was slain in the king's company. This battle seems to have been an arena for settling personal, political, and north-country scores, as well as for attempting to reform the government. Northumberland was buried in the nearby abbey.<br>
