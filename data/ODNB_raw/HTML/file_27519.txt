<span class="headword">Tomkis <span class="st"> [Tomkys]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1580, <em>d.</em> in or after 1615), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68275/', "John Tomkys (d. 1592)")</script>, entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1597, was admitted scholar in 1599, and was granted his BA in 1600. In 1602 he was elected minor fellow, and two years later earned an MA; he became a major fellow the same year. Tomkis has been remembered by posterity as the author of two academic plays, both written and probably performed at Cambridge. The first, entitled <span class="italic">Albumazar</span>, was performed on the evening of 9 March 1615, in Trinity College hall, which was designed for theatrical use as well as for dining. (The hall was built by Thomas Nevile, master from 1593 to 1615, and included a demountable stage and galleries. It was the site of numerous royal visits.) Among the spectators were James I, Prince Charles, and various courtiers who had converged on the university for several days. The party was entertained by a different play each evening. One of these was written by Samuel Brookes, who eventually became master of Trinity College; another by Phineas Fletcher, admitted to King's College in 1600.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Albumazar</span>, an adaptation of Giambattista della Porta's <span class="italic">L'astrologo</span> (printed in Venice in 1606), was performed in English by the members of Trinity College. In the college account book the senior bursar noted that Tomkis received &pound;20 &#145;for his paines in penning and ordering the English Commedie at our masters appoyntment&#146;  (Nelson, <span class="italic">Cambridge</span>, 1.527). The play was attributed to Tomkis on the title-page of two 1615 printings, and this was verified in an account of the royal visit in a manuscript by Sir Edward Dering (CUL, Add. MS 2677, art. 1, fol. 3). <span class="italic">Albumazar</span> was improperly identified by John Dryden in his prologue to a 1668 revival at Lincoln's Inn Fields as the model for Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Alchemist</span> (1610). In the nineteenth century there was some speculation that the play was written by William Shakespeare, a theory that has been thoroughly dismissed (Rimbault, 259&#150;60; Wright, 155).<br>
<br>The subject matter of Tomkis's play&#151;a satire on astrology&#151;apparently made the piece a great success. <span class="italic">Albumazar</span> was entered in the London Stationers' register on 28 April 1615 and printed almost immediately. However, the gossipmonger John Chamberlain remarked that &#145;there was no great matter in it more than one good clown's part&#146;  (Chambers, 3.498). The play was printed twice in 1615 and reprinted in 1634 and 1668, as well as numerous times throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The first quarto was printed again in 1944, followed by another reprint in 1977. <span class="italic">Albumazar</span> retained its theatrical attractiveness throughout the eighteenth century, being performed at Drury Lane in 1744, 1747, and 1748. Subsequently the actor David Garrick made alterations and performed in his new version (also at Drury Lane) on 19 October 1773. This version was also published.<br>
<br>Although falsely ascribed to Antony Brewer (<i>fl</i>. 1630&#150;1655) a second Tomkis play was correctly identified by Sir John Harington early in the seventeenth century: &#145;The combat of lingua&#146; as written by &#145;Thom[as] Tomkis of Trinity colledge in Cambridge&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 27632, fol. 30). The play was probably also performed in Cambridge. Here Tomkis seems again to have been influenced by an Italian model; &#145;Lingua&#146; is a farcical presentation of a struggle between personifications of the tongue and the five senses, all which are identified by their Latin names.<br>
<br>G. C. Moore Smith supported 1602 as a possible date for the composition of &#145;Lingua&#146;, on the theory that a compliment to Queen Psyche is really meant for Queen Elizabeth; however, other critics do not find this evidence convincing. There is also another myth, that Oliver Cromwell acted in &#145;Lingua&#146;, his young nephew performing the role of Small Beer. This led F. G. Fleay to suggest that the play formed part of Cromwell's entertainments for King James at Hinchinbrook on 27&#150;9 April 1603. There is no evidence, however, to suggest that this was the case  (Nelson, <span class="italic">Cambridge</span>, 2.942). A third theory, proposed by Frederick Boas, dated the play later, to shortly before the time of publication, because of certain similarities with passages in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>.<br>
<br>The play was entered into the Stationers' register on 23 February 1607 as &#145;A Commedie called Lingua&#146;, and an anonymous printing followed soon thereafter in the same year. Here the play was entitled <span class="italic">Lingua, or, The Combat of the Tongue, and the Five Senses</span>. Four other dated printings followed in 1617, 1622, 1632, and 1657, along with one undated printing. So popular was <span class="italic">Lingua</span> during its time that it was translated as <span class="italic">Speculum aestheticum</span> (1613) by Johannes Rhenanus for Maurice of Hesse-Cassel. Rhenanus probably accompanied Prince Otto to England in 1611.<br>
<br>In addition E. K. Chambers identified a later, doubtful play that was supposedly written by Tomkis: <span class="italic">Pathomachia, or, The Battle of Affections</span> (1630). In a running title, as well as in Bodleian Library manuscript (MS Eng. misc. e. 5), the same play is identified as <span class="italic">Love's Load-Stone</span>. The piece, which contains two references to &#145;Madame Lingua&#146;, appears to be from about 1616  (Chambers, 3.499). It is not known when Tomkis died. He has frequently been confused with Thomas Tomkins (<i>d</i>. 1656), the musician, and his son John (1586&#150;1638); however, there is no known relationship between these families.<br>
