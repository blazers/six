</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Warburton,  John</span>  (1682&#150;1759), <span class="occ">herald and antiquary</span>, was born on 26 February 1682 at Bury, Lancashire, the eldest of four sons and eight children, apart from an unnamed infant burial, of Benjamin Warburton (1653&#150;1710) of Elton, in the parish of Bury, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. in or before 1732), daughter of Michael Buxton of Manchester, woollen draper. His father was a yeoman and tenant of Lord Derby, on whose recommendation Warburton was admitted as a recruit to the excise on 8 February 1706. In August 1708, while an excise officer at Ravenglass, Cumberland, he effected an exchange to Cockermouth. Three weeks later he was reduced to the grade of assistant and sent to Newcastle upon Tyne for entering in his diaries details of surveys that he had not made. In November 1708 he was appointed officer of Darlington Ride Station; he was at Hartlepool when he married, on 1 October 1710 at Whitbeck, Cumberland, Dorothy (<i>b</i>. 1664), daughter of Andrew Hudleston of Hutton John, and his wife, Katherine, daughter of Sir Wilfred Lawson, baronet. She was twice widowed; her former husbands were John Parke (<i>d</i>. 1699), of Whitbeck Hall, with whom she had at least one child, and Edmund Gibson (<i>d</i>. 1708/9) of Townend, Whitbeck.<br>
<br>In 1712 Warburton was promoted supervisor at Hexham, where he acted as a government informer during the Jacobite rising of 1715 and afterwards assisted the commissioners appointed to inquire into forfeited estates, for which he was advanced to the rank of collector at Richmond, Yorkshire, in 1716. In the same year he separated from his wife and published a map of Northumberland. He remained at Richmond until August 1718, when he was reduced, for drunkenness, to the position of supervisor at Wakefield. Shortly afterwards he resigned from the excise and began work on a map of Yorkshire, published about 1720, undertaking two journeys through Yorkshire, in 1718 and 1719, for which the journals survive (BL, Lansdowne MS 911, fols. 346&#150;351b, and 378&#150;99). While at Leeds he stayed with the antiquary Ralph Thoresby. He was admitted a fellow of the Royal Society in March 1719 and of the Society of Antiquaries on 13 January 1720 but was eventually ejected from both bodies, the former in 1757 and the latter before 1752. By 1720 he was already of note as a collector of manuscripts and antiquities. The diary of Humfrey Wanley, Lord Oxford's librarian, reveals, on 6 July 1720, Warburton's &#145;resolution to part with his Roman Altars&#146; and that on 13 July he sold manuscripts for 100 guineas to Lord Oxford, many of which came from the library of Lord William Howard (1563&#150;1640) at Naworth, Cumberland  (pp. 56&#150;7).<br>
<br>Warburton was appointed Somerset herald by patent dated 18 June 1720 because, according to Stephen Martin Leake, Garter king of arms, he had &#145;made himself serviceable to the government in convicting some of the rebels&#146;  (Coll. Arms, MS SML 65, 252). From the time of his appointment his relations with the other heralds were bad, initially because he sought subscribers to his maps in return for publishing their arms in the margins without establishing their entitlement to arms. He denied knowledge of the advertisements that appeared in three newspapers in December 1722 stating that the contest between him and the provincial kings of arms about this matter had been determined in his favour. A map of Middlesex, Essex, and Hertfordshire, engraved by Samuel Parker on the scale of two-thirds of an inch to the mile, was published about 1724 under the names of Warburton, Joseph Bland, and Paylor Smyth. Warburton regularly failed to attend chapter meetings at the college, and at the coronation of George II, on 11 October 1727, though he was senior herald by length of appointment the deputy earl marshal ordered that he should officiate as junior herald, and Edward Stibbs, Chester herald, became acting senior herald and proclaimed the challenge.<br>
<br>Warburton's second wife was Mary (1697/8&#150;1778), widow of William Bury of Blankney, Lincolnshire, and daughter of Robert Morrison of London, a merchant. They married at some time between 15 April 1731, when Mary's first husband made his will, which was proved in June 1731, and 3 August 1732, when their son, John, was born. From her first marriage Mary had eight children, and with Warburton she had two; John married Anne Catherine, sister of the antiquary Edward Rowe Mores, and Amelia (1735&#150;1786) became the wife of John Elphinston, a captain in the Royal Navy.<br>
<br>In 1749 Warburton published a map of London and Middlesex engraved by Nathaniel Hill. His colleagues complained that it contained false arms. Warburton justified the arms in <span class="italic">London and Middlesex Illustrated</span> (1749). He attempted to sell his office for &pound;500 but failed. His <span class="italic">Vallum Romanum</span> (1753) is largely a reprint of extracts from the <span class="italic">Britannia Romana</span> of John Horsley (1685&#150;1732); in the preface he stated not only that he suggested in 1715 that the Roman road from Newcastle upon Tyne to Carlisle should be repaired&#151;which after the 1745 Jacobite rising resulted in the 1751 act of parliament for making the road&#151;but also made the unfounded claim of his having been instrumental in the revival of Roman learning and the foundation of the Society of Antiquaries in 1717 by publication of his 1716 map of Northumberland.<br>
<br>Warburton bore a marked physical resemblance to George II, who was one year his junior, as can be seen in the portrait of him in a tabard by Vandergucht, engraved in mezzotint by Andrew Miller in 1740. Contemporaries did not speak well of him; Thomas Pennant, the eminent traveller, wrote:<blockquote>I knew Warburton well. He was the most illiterate man I ever met with. Ignorant not only of the learned and foreign languages, but even of his own. As to drawing he had not the humblest rudiments of it. Nor was his knowledge greater in surveying &hellip; And yet this man had the Art or rather Cunning to pass through life with credit and to be spoken of after his death as a man of learning and ingenuity. (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 149, 292)</blockquote>According to Francis Grose &#145;All the publications under his name both books and maps were done by others hired by him&#146;  (Grose, 158).<br>
<br>Stephen Martin Leake states that Warburton remained for many years a prisoner for debt in the Fleet prison. Latterly he lived in the College of Arms, where he died on 11 May 1759; he was survived by his wife, who died, aged eighty, in 1778. He was buried on 17 May at St Benet Paul's Wharf, following his testamentary wish to lie &#145;as near as possible to the remains of my old friend Gregory King, Esq. York Herald in the parish church of St. Benet's Paul's Wharf&#146;. King, who was Lancaster (not York) herald, had died in 1712, eight years before Warburton became Somerset herald. A codicil, dated 25 April 1759, to Warburton's undated will, proved on 18 May 1759, refers to his being very feeble in his legs and hips. He is said to have made over &pound;2000 by the sale of his maps, but spent more, partly on forming the magnificent manuscript and other collections that were largely dispersed at his death and are his most lasting monument. His collection of Elizabethan and Jacobean plays, several of which were unique, was destroyed through his own carelessness and the ignorance of Betsy Baker, his cook, by whom they were &#145;unluckily burnd or put under pye bottoms&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). A list of the fifty-five plays destroyed is in the British Library (BL, Lansdowne MS 807). Warburton's library of printed books and manuscripts was sold at auction in 764 lots by Samuel Paterson at Essex House, Strand, in six evening sales commencing on Monday 19 November 1759. Edward Howard, ninth duke of Norfolk, purchased sixty-three lots and presented them to the College of Arms, where they form the EDN collection. The three-volume <span class="italic">Baronagium genealogicum</span>, for which the sale catalogue states that Warburton had been offered &pound;500 by the late earl of Oxford, was purchased by Joseph Edmondson, who based his 1764 six-volume peerage of the same name on it. There was a subsequent sale on 7 and 8 March 1766. Thirty-eight volumes of Warburton's manuscript collections are in the Lansdowne collection in the British Library, of which twenty-one relate to Yorkshire.<br>
