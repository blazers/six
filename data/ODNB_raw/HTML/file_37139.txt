<span class="headword">Baddam,  Benjamin</span>  (<em>c.</em>1693&#150;1740?), <span class="occ">printer and compiler of the Memoirs of the Royal Society</span>, was the eldest of three children of Benjamin Baddam (1670&#150;1700/01), free of the Glaziers' Company in 1692, who married Elizabeth Palmer (1672&#150;1701&times;16), daughter of John Palmer, a dyer, at St Nicholas Cole Abbey in July 1692. Apprenticed (as Benjamin Maddam) on 1 May 1710 to Benjamin Harris, a well-known London printer and bookseller, he obtained his freedom as a citizen and Stationer of London on 4 August 1718, inheriting considerable London property from his grandfather John Baddam (<i>d</i>. 1717), a dyer, in Spitalfields and St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney. By 1720 he was living in Blue Anchor Alley, Wellclose Square, where he insured his goods and merchandise against fire for &pound;500. From this address Baddam printed two publications in 1720 (partnered in the first by Moses Carter): <span class="italic">Crambo's Elopement, or, The Austere Poetaster's Ramble</span>, in imitation of John Wilmot, second earl of Rochester; and <span class="italic">The Protestant Account of the Burning of London</span>, as an &#145;antidote&#146; to a tract absolving papists from complicity in the great fire of London. In July 1723 Baddam purchased printed letters from the estate of John Matthews, and Samuel Negus listed him that year as a high-flying Fleet Street printer  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 1.304). However, in November the Stationers' Company filed a bill in chancery against Benjamin Baddam, of Ratcliff Highway, near Shadwell (and Wellclose Square, Stepney), for printing, publishing, or selling &#145;severall Thousands of Primmers and severall Thousands of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> of David in English metre&#146;  (TNA: PRO, C11/2538/56), thereby flouting its royal monopoly. Despite an injunction against him, as the master reported to a meeting of the court of assistants at Stationers' Hall on 3 November 1723, Baddam intended to &#145;Controvert the Validity of the Companys Letters Patent&#146;  (court book of the Stationers' Company, 162). In February 1724 Baddam agreed to accept the company's terms, but refused to pay its legal costs; instead, and in return for an annual life allowance of &pound;50, he proposed revealing &#145;a Method which if followed would put it out of the power of any person to clandestinely print any of the Companys copys for the future&#146;  (ibid., 166). Baddam's wife attended a court meeting on his behalf in October 1724. The outcome of the case is not clear.<br>
<br>During 1732 Baddam printed in Fleet Street a subscribed folio edition of Le Stourgeon's <span class="italic">Compleat Universal History of the Several Empire &hellip; throughout the Known World</span>, illustrated with maps by Henry Wilson and reprinted, with a new title-page, in 1738. Describing himself as a former pupil of J. T. Desaguliers, he publicized in the <span class="italic">Daily Advertiser</span> three courses of public lectures covering the full range of experimental philosophy which he gave at the London Coffee House in Ludgate Hill between 11 October and 30 December 1732, alternating with Abraham Chovet, a pioneering Huguenot anatomy lecturer who was appointed demonstrator to the Company of Barber&#150;Surgeons in 1734. It was from Fleet Street, possibly in January 1733, that Baddam printed a trade advertisement for <span class="italic">Curiosities of all sorts, in pneumatics, hydrostatics, mechanics, &amp;c., viz. air-pumps or pneumatical engines</span>, recently improved by Desaguliers and other natural philosophers, as well as barometers and thermometers recommended by the Royal Society, which were made and sold by Rees Williams in the Strand. From January to February 1733 he also worked briefly as a journeyman compositor in the famous Bowyer printing house.<br>
<br>Baddam's experience qualified him admirably for his most ambitious known project&#151;an abridgement of the Royal Society's <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>. On 12 October 1738, as B. B. Philo Physiologiae, he issued proposals in the <span class="italic">Daily Advertiser</span> for subscriptions to this work, with details available from four well-established scientific instrument makers. It was then printed for him by Godfrey Smith in ten volumes, with 131 folding plates drawn by G. Smith and engraved by James Hulett, between 1738 and 1744, under the title <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Royal Society, being a new abridgment of the Philosophical Transactions for the years 1665 to 1735</span>. A second edition, extending to 1740, was published in 1745 for John Nourse (vols. 4&#150;10 are reprinted from the original edition, with cancel title-pages). Previous abridgements of the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> had been carried out on a piecemeal basis, whereas Baddam's version provided continuity and uniformity for the first time  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 1.482&#150;3). The title of the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> emphasized their &#145;general Use to the Publick, and worthy the Perusal of all Mathematicians, Artificers, Tradesmen, &amp;c. for their Improvement, in various Branches of Business&#146;. A supplementary volume of mathematical tracts, requested by the majority of the subscribers and announced at the end of the fourth volume, was never implemented. Baddam's preface, which explains his own approach, provides an informative &#145;short and succinct Narrative of the Royal Society and their <span class="roman">Transactions</span>&#146;. A somewhat crudely drawn frontispiece depicts several scientific instruments, such as Boyle's air-pump and a Marshall-type microscope, as used by Robert Hooke, together with other objects from the Royal Society's collections. As Baddam indicates, the French were translating the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> simultaneously (Fran&ccedil;ois de Br&eacute;mond, and then Pierre Demours, for the period from 1731 to 1740). His own competent and useful abridgement served its purpose well for nearly seventy years.<br>
<br>Baddam's death&#151;and his wife's&#151;is obscure, but a Benjamin Baddam from Fetter Lane was buried at St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street, on 23 November 1740.<br>
