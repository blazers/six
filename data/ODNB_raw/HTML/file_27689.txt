<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Trelawny, Sir  Jonathan</span>, third baronet  (1650&#150;1721), <span class="occ">bishop of Winchester</span>, was the second of the six surviving sons of Sir Jonathan Trelawny, second baronet (<i>d</i>. 1681) and his wife, Mary, daughter of Sir Edward Seymour of Berry Pomeroy, Devon. He was born on 24 March 1650 at Trelawne, Pelynt, Cornwall, and baptized in Pelynt parish church on 26 April.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>Both Trelawny's father and paternal grandfather had been royalists in arms in the first civil war, a commitment which cost the family dear in the long run. They compounded for their estates but were additionally charged with paying compensation to the parliamentarian Buller family to the tune of &pound;1200. The family were burdened with debts not only during their lives but also after Jonathan Trelawny succeeded to the title of third baronet in 1681. His father was also imprisoned several times during the interregnum but kept up a correspondence with Charles II in exile.<br>
<br>Immediate royal favour at the Restoration began to repair the family's fortunes: Trelawny's father became a gentleman of the privy chamber on 5 June 1660, four years before he inherited the baronetcy. Financial embarrassment did not prevent Trelawny from receiving a good education: he went to Westminster School in 1663 and on to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1668. At the latter he came under the influence of Dr William Jane, with whom he would remain close, an uncompromising defender of the restored Church of England. Trelawny graduated BA on 22 June 1672 and MA on 29 April 1675.<br>
<br>The Trelawnys emerged as a military gentry family with clear Yorkist affiliations, and Trelawny was the only one among his brothers not to choose a career in the army or the navy. His father was comptroller of the duke of York's household between 1670 and 1674 and served as lieutenant-colonel in the duke of York's regiment of horse until it was disbanded in 1679. His family's dependence on York's favour must have been a complicating factor for Trelawny personally when loyalties became divided after 1685, but in the short term the connection with York promised well for his career prospects. He was appointed a royal chaplain-extraordinary in 1677, less than a year after his ordination as a priest on Christmas eve 1676. Charles II hurried to grant him the living of Calstock in Cornwall, only to discover that it had already been granted to someone else. Instead he was given the rectory of St Ive on 22 September 1677 and his father presented him to the family living of South Hill, to which Bishop Lamplugh instituted him on 4 October. Unfortunately the parsonages of both were in ruins and in need of rebuilding: young Trelawny lived at the family seat of Trelawne, more than 10 miles away from both, and irritated the bishop by seeking a third living&#151;that of Dartington&#151;to make up for the deficiencies of the first two. His plea was refused. Instead, he took on the role of chaplain to Lord Conway.<br>
<br>Much of the next eight years would be taken up with a futile search for further preferment, a search made more urgent when Trelawny inherited his father's debts along with his title in March 1681, following his elder brother's death in October 1680. He lapsed into self-pity and self-dramatization, writing to John Ellis in August 1682: &#145;the King hath not a gentleman he can entirely confide in but myself, &amp; yet he gives me neither money nor preferment to bear up with against my debts (contracted in the service of the crown)&#146;  (Smith, 18). Instead of devoting his energies to the church, an increasing amount of Trelawny's time was spent in the secular government of Cornwall, inspecting his father's old militia troop and succeeding him in his role of vice-admiral of south Cornwall in February 1682, as well as being named on the commission of the peace. He comes across more in this period as a gentry governor of his shire than as any sort of spiritual leader. With his unashamed swearing, his love of good living, and his lack of serious scholarship, it is little wonder that his career in a church led by Archbishop Sancroft was slow to progress. On 31 March 1684, he married the fourteen-year-old Rebecca Hele (1670&#150;1710), daughter of Thomas Hele of Babcombe, Devon, with whom he had a large family. Among their sons was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27686/', "Edward Trelawny")</script>, governor of Jamaica.<h2>
<a name="Episcopalpromotionandtherevolution"></a>Episcopal promotion and the revolution</h2>Trelawny's fortunes only began to improve after his family's erstwhile patron, the duke of York, succeeded to the throne as James II in February 1685. Trelawny was not slow to demonstrate his loyalty, soliciting Lord Chief Justice Jeffreys for nominations for seats in parliament, over which he had an influence, even before he was asked; and when Monmouth's rebellion broke out he was notably efficient in mobilizing the Cornish militia, with the help of only one other deputy lieutenant (the rest proving recalcitrant), for which the earl of Sunderland wrote to congratulate him. However, his reward, when it came, fell far below his expectations&#151;the poor bishopric of Bristol. He made no attempt to hide his disappointment, even begging Sunderland to influence the king to change his mind. But it was to no avail and he was consecrated at Lambeth on 8 November 1685, by two archbishops and six bishops then in London to attend parliament.<br>
<br>Despite his misgivings about his new appointment Trelawny was keen to prove himself both as an effective diocesan and as a loyal servant of the king. He achieved the first objective, holding a successful visitation of Bristol Cathedral in January&#150;February 1686, winning over the dean, William Lovett. His primary visitation of Dorset at Easter also went well, gaining Sancroft's warm approval for his injunctions, and his demand that communion tables be set &#145;altar-wise&#146; at the east end and railed off seems to have been enforced even in Dorchester, despite its long puritan and nonconformist tradition. He also, at this stage, managed to stay in step with royal policy, emphasizing the ill consequences of anti-popish preaching in his visitation charge. However, by 1687 this particular balancing act was proving much harder to sustain and Trelawny found himself increasingly drawn into the episcopal opposition to the king's policies. When called upon by Sunderland to sign an address of thanks for the declaration of indulgence granting toleration to dissenters and Roman Catholics in April 1687, and to promote it among his clergy, his response was equivocal and ultimately disingenuous. Having done nothing for three weeks he communicated to his Bristol clergy, via Dr Jane, that he would not sign the address personally; but when, at a meeting with them, they followed his lead and also demurred, he wrote to Sunderland, claiming that it was their reluctance which had prompted him to refrain from signing. Of the Dorset clergy, only two signed. The king was furious at the disobedience.<br>
<br>Gradually Trelawny became more courageous in his opposition, giving a living to one of the fellows ejected from Magdalen College, Oxford, in December 1687, in clear defiance of the ecclesiastical commissioners' express order. And finally in May 1688 he supported the petition of Sancroft and five other bishops against the order to read the declaration of indulgence in churches and so found himself one of the famous seven bishops who were prosecuted by the angry king. In their tense interview with James II, when he charged them with issuing a trumpet of rebellion, Trelawny fell to his knees and made a self-justifying speech. James found this merely saucy but Trelawny's behaviour sounds more like the <i>cri de coeur</i> of a man facing an unbearable tension between his family's traditional royalism and his own commitment to the Church of England. His acquittal along with the others must have been a huge relief and Trelawny responded by paying more than his fair share of the legal costs.<br>
<br>That summer was in many ways Trelawny's finest hour: a moment of moral courage and heroism in a life otherwise marked by self-seeking and conformity. He had every reason to believe that his opposition to the king's policy would be costly to him personally, and he had no way of anticipating the course events would subsequently take. However, a number of myths have grown up around his role in 1688. The &#145;Song of the Western Men&#146; in support of him at the time of the trial (which Macaulay quotes: &#145;And shall Trelawney die&#146;) probably had nothing to do with him and allegations of his complicity with William of Orange at this time are also, almost certainly, false. James II was probably right to believe as late as mid-November, when he appointed him bishop of Exeter, that Trelawny was still basically loyal to him. On 25 November, when Trelawny's brother Charles, a senior army officer, defected to the prince, Trelawny sent an assurance of his own loyalty to the king, via Bishop Francis Turner, which may well have been sincere.<br>
<br>Military and political realities, however, soon supervened. On 5 December, while Trelawny was at Bristol, the earl of Shrewsbury arrived with a regiment of foot and a letter from the prince of Orange. Trelawny replied cautiously to the latter, expressing approval for the steps taken to secure the protestant religion and the laws and liberties of England. James's flight and in particular his jettisoning of the great seal sabotaged, at least temporarily, Trelawny's translation to Exeter, but he resisted the direction in which political events inexorably moved thereafter. On 31 January and early in February 1689 he voted against the notion that James II had abdicated and against the offer of the crown to William and Mary. However, he stopped short of rejecting the subsequent settlement, took the oaths, and reflected afterwards: &#145;we thought ourselves obliged to accept the deliverance brought us&#146;  (Smith, 58). He seems to have assumed that James II would be implacable to him personally and on that basis was consistently hostile to Jacobitism. Nevertheless, preaching at a thanksgiving service before Queen Anne and both houses of parliament in 1702, in a sermon focusing on national deliverances, he mentioned the Restoration but not the revolution. A reference to &#145;eighty-eight&#146; turns out to be alluding to the defeat of the Spanish armada in 1588, rather than more contentious events a hundred years later  (Trelawny, 30).<h2>
<a name="BishopofExeter16891706"></a>Bishop of Exeter, 1689&#150;1706</h2>Perhaps somewhat surprisingly the new sovereigns endorsed and expedited Trelawny's translation to Exeter and he was down in the diocese conducting his primary visitation by August 1689. If Trelawny had been a somewhat incongruous member of the episcopal bench in the Sancroft era, he hardly fitted any better into that of Tillotson and Tenison, although for different reasons. Though appointed to the commission to revise the liturgy in the interests of comprehension in 1689, he took no part in its proceedings and later opposed informal moves designed to placate dissent. He was a staunch defender of church courts and episcopal discipline: in 1704, he wanted convocation (whose revival he fully supported) to censure bishops for neglecting their disciplinary powers. He jealously guarded his episcopal rights, going to law lengthily and expensively several times in the course of the 1690s, especially to uphold his right to regulate education in a number of different spheres. And he was implacably opposed to new developments such as the societies for the reformation of manners, which seemed to undermine the Church of England's status as the guardian of the nation's morals.<h2>
<a name="BishopofWinchesterandboroughmonger"></a>Bishop of Winchester and borough-monger</h2>Trelawny has gone down in history as a time-server, promoted through the episcopate to the highest level for political services to his masters. This is partly attributable to an acid comment from Gilbert Burnet, a long-standing rival and enemy, that his promotion to the bishopric of Winchester in 1706 was due in part to the electoral interest which he had in west country boroughs. It was certainly remarkable to see an unreconstructed high-church bishop like Trelawny, patron of Atterbury and the convocation movement as he was, becoming a diehard adherent of the increasingly whiggish Marlborough&#150;Godolphin ministry right down to its fall in 1710. But a purely cynical interpretation of this development needs to be put into some sort of context. For one thing, Trelawny was a long-standing friend of the Churchills and of Godolphin before their rise to power. For another, he was genuinely committed to their central policy of energetically prosecuting the war with France, as he showed by the hawkish tone of his thanksgiving sermon of 1702, for all its apparent lack of enthusiasm for the revolution itself (<span class="italic">A Sermon Preach'd before the Queen</span>). As bishop of Exeter he had a good record of working with whig clergy across party lines for the good of the church. And, ironically, the move to Winchester made it more difficult for Trelawny to maintain his electoral interest in Cornwall. Beyond this, he did not make his peace with the new tory ministry led by Harley until 1712, quite a long delay for a supposed vicar of Bray, and his subsequent commitment to the Hanoverian succession has all the hallmarks of sincerity.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, Trelawny's status as a borough-monger is not in doubt. He built on his existing family interest and in 1702 boasted, not implausibly, to have had a hand in the return of eleven MPs. Nor can it be doubted that Trelawny could be quite ruthless in defence of his interest, using not only his role as a diocesan but also family connections to extend it. In 1716 he even forced his reluctant daughter Rebecca to marry the disfigured John Buller, in order to extend his influence to the borough of Saltash.<br>
<br>Trelawny's reputation for time-serving has undoubtedly been enhanced by the tone of his correspondence with those in power, which tended to be effusive to the point of flattery. It can be traced as far back as a letter to the earl of Rochester in 1683 and remained a feature of his surviving letters to the end of his life. That it was not purely self-seeking may be inferred from the fact that it was applied equally to long-standing friends and colleagues, like Marlborough and Archbishop Wake, as well as to powerful men with whom he was not previously acquainted. But it certainly sounds craven.<br>
<br>The demands of maintaining a large electoral interest, in a time of frequent polls and spiralling electoral costs, may in part provide the answer to another puzzle about Trelawny: that the proceeds of the enormously lucrative see of Winchester failed to solve his family's financial problems. In the 1690s Trelawny had been financially too embarrassed to incur the additional cost of attending parliament on a regular basis; in 1710 he was still known to be in difficulties, and in 1713 he was compelled to remortgage all his family estates for &pound;9000. He died intestate and after his death nearly &pound;16,000 had to be raised from the sale of Trelawny estates to pay off debts. Yet in his last eight years at Winchester it has been estimated that he must have netted some &pound;25,000, which was brought in by the systematic exploitation of the proceeds of the bishopric, seriously alienating the bulk of its customary tenants. His business manager, Charles Heron, had made a significant start in this area before 1713 and his successor, Edward Forbes, merely continued as Heron had begun.<br>
<br>Again the context of Trelawny's action provides some excuse. The resources of the bishopric had been notably under-exploited, even spoiled, in the final years of his predecessor, Peter Mews, in the opening years of the eighteenth century. And by the time of Trelawny's death at least, other bishops and capitular bodies were beginning to exploit their possessions in a similar way. Maintaining his electoral interest was not the only financial burden on Trelawny at this time. He had a large family to provide for&#151;thirteen children, of whom eleven survived. He did his best for several of them, using the offices which were in his gift as bishop, a nepotism different only in scale from that practised by episcopal colleagues.<br>
<br>Looked at positively, Trelawny could be generous to a fault: his paying more than his share of the legal costs arising from the seven bishops' trial in 1688 was typical, as was his offer to pay for the fitting out of the interior of the meeting-place for the lower house of convocation, though in the latter case, the offer was declined. Negatively, Trelawny could be a spendthrift, building a new chapel at Trelawne, laying out new gardens at his palace at Winchester, and installing a huge episcopal throne in the cathedral there.<br>
<br>No early portrait of Trelawny survives, but a late one (post-1706) is, in its way, quite revealing. He wears the robes of a prelate of the Garter (a role he fulfilled <i>ex officio</i> as bishop of Winchester), trappings which he had been particularly keen to acquire on his translation. His nose is straight, the mouth generous but not over-large. Regarding the viewer with a somewhat superior gaze, he has all the air of a gentleman about town, rather than a minister of the church. There was throughout his life a certain incongruity between Trelawny's personal style and the spiritual offices he held, an incongruity felt even during his lifetime. It was savagely satirized in a work called <span class="italic">The Tribe of Levi</span>, which dubbed him &#145;Fighting Joshua&#146; and dismissed him as a &#145;spiritual dragoon&#146;  (Strickland, 384). This work focuses on his role in the suppression of Monmouth's rebellion but it could equally have picked out other distinctly unclerical aspects of his life and career, such as his bluntness in speech and in letter writing. His high theology of the apostolic succession sat rather oddly with his very pragmatic attitude to the exploitation of the proceeds of ecclesiastical office for both laudable and questionable purposes.<br>
<br>It is too simple to see Trelawny as a conservative overtaken by changing times; he was in many ways <i>sui generis</i> even as a bishop under James II and later as bishop of Winchester he was somewhat ahead of his time, in terms of the vigour with which he exploited the resources of his see and challenged the customary rights of his tenants. His churchmanship and theological views were certainly backward-looking, lifelong campaigner for Laudian-style altars and traditional orthodoxy as he was. He was nevertheless every inch an eighteenth-century borough-monger.<br>
<br>Trelawny died suddenly at his residence in Chelsea on 19 July 1721. His body was moved with great pomp on Thursday 3 August down to Cornwall for interment in the family vault at Pelynt church (where he had been baptized) on 10 August 1721.<br>
