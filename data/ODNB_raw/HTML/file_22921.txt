<span class="headword">Pye, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1622&#150;1701), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37872/', "Sir Robert Pye (bap. 1585, d. 1662)")</script> of Faringdon Manor, Berkshire, and his wife, Mary Croker. His father was a remembrancer of the exchequer from 1618, MP for Woodstock in the Long Parliament, and a parliamentarian advocate of peace with the king at the beginning of the civil war. At that juncture, his son, who had married Anne Hampden (<i>b</i>. 1625), daughter of John Hampden, raised a troop of horse for the earl of Essex, and his parliamentarian military career began: he was wounded when Cirencester was captured in September 1643. In the February 1644 reorganization of Essex's army Pye's was designated one of the six cavalry regiments, and in June of the same year he was in command of the surrender of Taunton Castle to parliament. In February 1645 he was sent to Buckinghamshire to suppress expected disorder, and by March he was commanding three troops under Cromwell to march on Coventry and assist Sir William Brereton. In that month, however, Pye's military career began to run into the political shoals of intra-parliamentarian conflict. Despite his bellicose record, he was politically associated with moderate and Presbyterian parliamentarianism, and his father attached to the peace party. Hence the action of parliament, during debates over the formation of the New Model Army, of securing a regimental command for Pye in place of the radical Nathaniel Rich was a setback for the party of all-out war with the king.<br>
<br>In May 1645 the committee of both kingdoms regrouped 900 troops in Buckinghamshire under Pye's command. The recipient of warm commendations from the committee (&#145;very ready to go upon the service &hellip; very great readiness and much affection to prefer the public service to any particular interest of his own&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1644&#150;5</i>, 503, 504), he was ordered northwards, with a group of cavalry commanders, to assist the Scots against the king. That was how he became involved, displaying &#145;great valour&#146;  (<span class="italic">VCH Leicestershire</span>, 2.115) in a parliamentarian disaster, the failed defence of Leicester, which fell to crown forces in May 1645. Pye was captured on 31 May, though subsequently paroled, on 4 June, and exchanged for a royalist officer on the 20th. His reputation with the committee of both kingdoms reached new heights, arrangements were made to reimburse him for losses, he was entrusted with the conveyance of money and recruits to Portsmouth, and brought reinforcements from Reading to assist Fairfax in the siege of Sherborne in August 1645. He led his regiment in the siege of Bristol in September, and in May 1646 was sent by Fairfax to command the siege of Faringdon, Berkshire, which fell on 24 June.<br>
<br>In 1646 with peacetime legal conditions returning, soldiers such as Pye were losing immunity from prosecutions for damages done during the hostilities and he was sued for a horse he had commandeered in Reading. However, a further high point in his career came in 1647, when a section of his regiment kept guard on Charles I at Holdenby House. If a malicious story from Edmund Ludlow has any credit, the full extent of Pye's political conservatism became evident when he &#145;supplied the place of a querry, riding bare before [Charles I] when he rode abroad&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow</span>, 1.151). Given his conservative political profile as a &#145;moderate Presbyterian&#146;  (Kishlansky, 162&#150;3), it is not surprising that Pye was targeted as an ally in the programme of the Presbyterian politician Denzil Holles to disband the regiments not needed for service in Ireland, thereby neutralizing the army radicals. Creating division in his own regiment, the bulk of which mutinied and joined the main body of the army, Pye was vilified by the majority of the forces for willingness to accept, without redress of grievances, the proposed package of large-scale demobilization, with Irish service. Pye's personal regimental following were the first units to arrive in Westminster in June 1647, having resolved to volunteer for Ireland. In August they were instructed to prepare the defence of the capital against the threatened army takeover. When the army took possession of the capital, involving the deaths of seven of Pye's men at Deptford, he secured a pass from Fairfax to go into exile, probably in Holland. This, for Pye, was the low point of a career in which the complexities of politics tended to prove his downfall. The pamphlet <span class="italic">A Speedy Hue and Crie</span> of 1647, attacking him and other refugee officers as renegades, added vilification to his defeat.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, with the gradual return of civilian government in the 1650s, Pye represented his native Berkshire in the parliaments of 1654 and 1658. When, on 25 January 1660, he presented a petition, which arose out of a Berkshire county meeting, for the return of the 1648 &#145;secluded members&#146; (of whom his father was one) who were thought likely to favour a royal restoration, his political judgement was faulty in moving too far ahead of events. He was imprisoned, and his case awoke a constitutional issue over parliament's refusal to dispute the judgement of a lower court, the upper bench, in favour of his habeas corpus. By February, however, as George Monck's ascendancy nudged developments towards a restoration and with the secluded members admitted on 21 February, Pye was freed, and on 2 March his prosecution was expunged from the record. He was a member of the convention and, although he can be classed with the &#145;Presbyterian&#146; grouping, he played no recorded active role.<br>
<br>Although his contribution to the Restoration was courageous rather than creative, Pye won royal gratitude for his role. By August 1661 he was an auditor of the exchequer under the lord treasurer Southampton, and on 22 December 1662 a royal warrant was issued to give him a baronetcy, though this does not seem to have resulted in the assumption of that honour. Further evidence of Charles II's favour, however, came on 22 June 1670, when, &#145;of assured loyalty and faithfulness&#146;, he was exempted from the order of 10 June expelling all officers &#145;of the late usurped power&#146; from London  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1670</i>, 267, 292). Pye was otherwise out of public life until the revolution, when, in December 1688, he accompanied William of Orange on his way to London. Recognition came towards the end of his life when, in 1700, he acted as deputy lieutenant for Berkshire. He and his wife, Anne, had two sons, Hampden and Edmund. Pye died in 1701 at Faringdon. He was a brave and able soldier, a military man passionately, even rashly, attached to civilian government but sometimes out of his depth in politics and for the last forty years of his life generally keeping clear of their currents.<br>
