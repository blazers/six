<span class="headword">Pope,  Mary</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1653?), <span class="occ">royalist writer</span>, of unknown parentage, was married to John Pope (<i>d</i>. 1646), a member of the London Salters' Company who served as its master for 1642. They were living in Friday Street, in the parish of St Margaret Moses, London, from at least 1622. Before John's death on 18 November 1646 the couple had ten children, the first of whom was baptized in 1622; as the parish records indicate, many of them died in infancy.<br>
<br>Mary Pope began publishing pro-monarchist tracts in the late 1640s against significant obstacles, personal and political. Most of the information relating to her has to be culled from her three tracts: <span class="italic">A Treatise of Magistracy</span> (1647); <span class="italic">Behold, Here is a Word</span> (1648); and the second part of <span class="italic">Behold</span> entitled, <span class="italic">Heare, Heare, Heare, Heare, a Word or Message from Heaven</span> (1648). Pope began writing <span class="italic">A Treatise</span>, her first pamphlet, when she felt impelled by God to share her ideas with the nation. From auspicious beginnings in December 1645, however, she began to falter&#151;and the reasons she presents offer significant insight into her personal circumstances. In the first instance her health appears to have been very fragile, and indeed <span class="italic">A Treatise</span> was reputedly dictated to another. Further difficulties related to the &#145;extraordinary change&#146; she had in her own family&#151;possibly a coded reference to the death of her husband John  (<span class="italic">Treatise</span>, sig. C3<i>r</i>). The considerable problems encountered in the writing of this tract did not end there though: when the manuscript was delivered finally to parliament, on 6 January 1647, almost three years after Pope had begun to write, the Commons arrested the deliverer. According to one account, a comment in the newsbook <span class="italic">A Perfect Diurnall</span> (number 232), Pope's manuscript had given parliament &#145;much discontent&#146;  (1870).<br>
<br>Mary Pope's second and third ventures into print a year later in 1648 were therefore written despite the earlier opposition of parliament. Referring explicitly to her previous troubles, she observes, in <span class="italic">Heare</span>, that since 1647 she has &#145;laine among the pots, under disgrace, because of my book of <span class="italic">Magistracy</span>&#146;  (p. 32). Her body of writing, though likely to be disliked by parliament because of its broadly pro-monarchical sentiments, is however anything but clear cut in its allegiances. She did reserve particular criticism for the Commonswealthmen, writing in condemnation of parliament's arrogance in waging war against God's divinely appointed monarch, for instance, and of the army's seeming contempt for authority. Throughout, she attempts to speak on behalf of the middle-ranking taxpayers&#151;people like herself&#151;who suffered during the troubles. But her support of the monarchy was far from absolute, acknowledging that the king had been manipulated by evil counsellors, and even blaming the monarchy for declining moral standards, as she perceived them. Overall, her position is more finely graded than the parliament gave her credit for. Furthermore, though the Popes' regular attendance at St Margaret Moses Church suggests religious conformity, Mary was critical of some aspects of church government. In the last quarter of the twentieth century Pope received more critical appraisal and her historical significance could not be better described than in the words of the critic Dorothy Ludlow, who suggests that Pope's work provides a window to a &#145;conservative, non-separating Puritanism&#146; representative of &#145;thousands of men and women whose religiosity was of a non-militant nature&#146;  (Ludlow, 198).<br>
<br>Mary Pope possibly died in Shinfield, Essex, in 1653, as on 26 September 1653 the administration of the estate of a Mary Pope was granted to Nathaniel, a son.<br>
