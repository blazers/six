<span class="headword">Matthews <span class="st"> [Mathews]</span>,  Abraham</span>  (1832&#150;1899), <span class="occ">Congregational minister and settler in Patagonia</span>, was born at Llanidloes, Montgomeryshire, in October 1832, the son of John Matthews or Mathews (<i>b</i>. 1800), weaver, and his wife, Ann Jones (<i>b</i>. 1804). When he was three years old his parents went to Australia and, owing to his weak constitution, he was left in Wales in the care of Edward and Ann Lewis, farmers from Cardiganshire who at the time lived in Bryn Du, near Llanidloes, and had four children of their own. The whole family then moved to Blaencwmlline, Cemais, where he was christened (<i>c</i>.1836). He stayed on the farm until the age of twelve, when he served his apprenticeship in a textile factory in Newtown apparently belonging to his paternal grandfather, John Matthews. He left the factory about 1848 to earn a living as a craftsman, but he soon decided to leave these occupations to follow a different calling.<br>
<br>Despite his affluent family background Matthews kept a distant relationship with his father and reportedly refused his share of the family inheritance, only accepting the family bible. The religious fervour inherited from his maternal grandfather, Abraham Jones, was nurtured in his adopted home by his surrogate father, a faithful member of the Cemais Calvinistic Methodist chapel, where Matthews enthusiastically attended Sunday school. After his conversion at the age of seventeen he became a member of the Congregational church at Llanwnnog and officiated at Sammah Congregational Chapel, Cwmlline, before starting his theological studies at Bala College. It was during the three years he spent in Bala (1856&#150;9) that, greatly influenced by the principal, Michael D. Jones, he became aware of plans to channel Welsh emigration into a single settlement where colonists could preserve their cultural heritage and achieve self-government.<br>
<br>After his graduation from Bala, Matthews preached at the recently established Congregational chapels of Horeb, Llwydcoed (1859&#150;65), and Elim, Cwmd&acirc;r (1859&#150;60), as well as Adulam, Merthyr Tudful (1862&#150;5). On 22 May 1863, at Merthyr's Congregational Ynysgau Chapel, he married Gwenllian Thomas (1842&#150;1922).<br>
<br>When the first contingent to the Welsh settlement (<i>y Wladfa</i>, &#145;the colony&#146;) in Patagonia was organized Matthews not only enlisted but also inspired about fifteen settlers from the Aberd&acirc;r area to join him, his wife, and six-month-old daughter, Mary Ann, aboard the <i>Mimosa</i>, which departed from Liverpool on 28 May 1865. They arrived at New Bay (later Porth Madryn or Puerto Madryn) on 28 July. Although he joined the venture as a mere settler, the bishop of <i>y Wladfa</i>, as he became known, was to play a key role in the development of the colony. In the first sermon delivered there he likened the Welsh settlers in the Chubut steppe to the Israelites in the desert. He was one of three preachers among the settlers aboard the <i>Mimosa</i>; the other two, Robert Meirion Williams (Baptist, from Llanfairfechan) and Lewis Humphreys (Congregational, from Dolgellau), had returned to Wales by 1867. Their departures left him to tend to the spiritual needs of the Welsh Patagonian community single-handed until the arrival in 1874 of another three clergymen: David Lloyd Jones (a former teacher at Bala College who carried out missionary work among Patagonia's indigenous peoples), John Caerenig Evans, and David Stephen Davies (1841&#150;1898). Matthews received no stipend for his services and earned a living from labouring on his farm and hunting with his dog. These circumstances led him to assert, on an occasion when his hound was prevented from entering the chapel where he was to preach, that his faithful companion contributed more than many of the settlers to the maintenance of religious services in <i>y Wladfa</i>. His zeal for preaching resulted in his characteristic limp: in his haste to deliver a sermon in one of the chapels of the Chubut Valley he prematurely discarded a plaster cast placed around his broken leg after a horse-kick.<br>
<br>Matthews also played a significant role in the civic dimension of the settlement: he was a member of the first elected council and of various decision-making committees formed thereafter. Moreover it was largely due to his (self-funded) canvassing trips to Wales and the United States in 1873&#150;4 that by 1875 the population of the settlement, which had previously been in decline, tripled. He lived there in Rawson (at Parc yr Esgob, &#145;bishop's field&#146;) and Drofa Dulog but returned to Wales in 1889&#150;90 and again in 1892&#150;4. The latter visit was undertaken with the intention of staying there permanently for the sake of the education of his two younger children, and he became a preacher at Severn Road Congregational Chapel, Cardiff. On hearing of the death of his fellow pioneer Edwin Cynrig Roberts, he set about writing <span class="italic">Hanes y Wladfa Gymreig yn Patagonia</span> (1894), the first published chronicle of the Welsh settlement in Chubut.<br>
<br>In 1894 Matthews returned to Patagonia, where he resumed his work as a minister in various chapels and took on the role of editor of <span class="italic">Y Dravod</span>, the newspaper established by his &#145;rival&#146; Lewis Jones in 1891. He died at 300 Avenida Fontana, Trelew, Patagonia, on 1 April 1899, as a result of an acute bout of double pneumonia contracted while fulfilling his pastoral duties. His wife and four of his five children survived him. He was buried on 3 April in the graveyard of Moriah Chapel, near Trelew, where he had preached since it was built in 1880.<br>
