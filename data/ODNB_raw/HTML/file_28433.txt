<span class="headword">Waldegrave, Sir  Edward</span>  (1516/17&#150;1561), <span class="occ">courtier and administrator</span>, was the eldest son of John Waldegrave and his wife, Laura (<i>d</i>. in or after 1545), daughter of John Rochester, and the grandson of Sir Edward Waldegrave of Bures, Suffolk. His father died in 1543, and two years later he succeeded his grandfather in the family estates. In 1546 he bought the manor of Borley, Essex, which was to become his principal residence. In religion and politics he had strong conservative connections through his marriage (before 1551) to Frances (1518/19&#150;1599), the daughter of Sir Edward Neville of Addington, Kent, who was executed with the Poles and Courtenays in 1539, and through his uncle Sir Robert Rochester, a member of Princess Mary's household. By 1549 Waldegrave had joined his uncle in Mary's household, and by 1551 he had become one of her inner circle of servants. In August of that year, along with Rochester and Sir Francis Englefield, he was summoned before the privy council and ordered to terminate the celebration of mass in Mary's household. When they reported the order to Mary, she refused to obey, sending them back to the council with a letter to Edward VI. Ordered to go back with a second order, the three men refused to obey and were sent first to the Fleet and then to the Tower. Following an attack of ague and the intercession of his wife, Waldegrave was removed to a house nearby and then his own home until his final release on 24 April 1552. As a member of Mary's household and a landholder in Suffolk he was among those who arranged her successful escape to the safety of Kenninghall and Framlingham during the succession crisis of July 1553. His advice to her during those perilous days was rewarded with a seat on her council, the keepership of the great wardrobe, and a knighthood.<br>
<br>An active member of the council and trusted adviser, Waldegrave allied himself with the conservatives led by Stephen Gardiner, and, perhaps due to his wife's influence, he soon outdid his uncle in opposition to the queen's Spanish match. He argued forcefully against the marriage on the grounds that it would cause a war with France, but was unable to persuade the queen. Once it was clear that Mary could not be moved, most of her councillors, including his uncle, acquiesced, but Waldegrave did not. He continued his support for Edward Courtenay as the queen's consort, and Renard, the Spanish ambassador, reported that he and Sir Edward Hastings had joined the opponents of the marriage to Philip in the Commons. According to rumour, Waldegrave considered leaving the queen's service, and he remained close to Courtenay until Wyatt's rebellion finally ruled him out as a possible husband for Mary. Renard continued to regard him with suspicion, and erroneously suspected that Waldegrave's support for the Catholic restoration and Cardinal Pole's early return to England were all part of a plot to prevent the marriage. Earlier Rochester had advised Renard against offering his nephew a monetary reward from Philip, but after the marriage he accepted a pension of 500 crowns.<br>
<br>Waldegrave attended the council on a regular basis and served on numerous committees and commissions. In 1557 he replaced his uncle as chancellor of the duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster, and in 1558 he served on the council of finance. In her will Mary named him one of her six assistant executors. He also sat in four of Mary's five parliaments, representing Wiltshire in 1553, even though he was not a major property holder in that county, and Somerset, where he was accumulating manors, in both parliaments of 1554. In 1558, after his uncle's death, he was a knight of the shire for Essex. Robert Wingfield dedicated his account of the 1553 succession crisis to Waldegrave, describing him as &#145;modest&#146; and a man noted for his &#145;good fellowship&#146;  (MacCulloch, 252), but his religious conservatism did not recommend him to Elizabeth I and his career at court ended. He did not accept the religious settlement of 1559, and in April 1561 he and his wife, who had been one of Mary's gentlewomen, were indicted at Brentwood, Essex, on charges of hearing mass and harbouring priests. Waldegrave died in the Tower on 1 September 1561, aged forty-four, and was buried at St Peter ad Vincula, Tower Green, two days later. His widow later erected a monument to him in Borley parish church. A committed opponent of the Elizabethan settlement, in 1565 Frances was questioned after two of their daughters tried to escape to the continent, where no doubt it was intended they should receive a Catholic education. Later Waldegraves persisted in recusancy until the eighteenth century.<br>
