<span class="headword">Percy,  James</span>  (1619&#150;<em>c.</em>1690), <span class="occ">peerage claimant</span>, was born at Harrowden, Northamptonshire, the eldest surviving son of Henry Percy, a servant in the household of Lord Chancellor Francis Bacon, and his wife, Lydia, daughter of Robert Cope of Horton, Northamptonshire. The elder Percy left Bacon's service following the chancellor's fall and moved to Dunnington, Lincolnshire, where in 1626 he deserted his family for London, taking with him a maidservant, with whom he had at least one son. The family, in serious want, relocated to Ireland, where James's uncle, James Percy, had emigrated. The young James took up trunk-making in Dublin, and built up a successful business, eventually setting himself up as a merchant. At an unknown date he married Sarah Sayer (<i>d</i>. in or before 1670). Percy's efforts brought him a modest fortune and the self-confidence he needed to pursue his claim to noble blood. After his uncle's death in 1654 he travelled to England, where he presented himself to the tenth earl of Northumberland as the head of the Irish branch of the family. Percy later claimed that both the tenth earl and his son Josceline Percy, the eleventh earl, acknowledged his relationship.<br>
<br>The eleventh earl died with no male heir at Turin on 21 May 1670. His countess, pregnant at the time, later gave birth to a stillborn child. Shortly afterwards, in February 1671, Percy entered his claim to the title. His faith in his right to the earldom was strong: when it was disputed by the eleventh earl's mother and wife on behalf of the three-year-old heir, Lady Elizabeth Percy, he was at first taken aback, but afterwards determined to triumph over the &#145;high privilege, policy, and potency of his opponents&#146;  (<span class="italic">House of Lords MSS</span>, 1.213), and so he embarked upon a ruinous twenty-year struggle, the final result of which was complete failure.<br>
<br>Percy could prove his descent from his grandfather, Henry Percy of Pavenham, Buckinghamshire, but establishing his connection to the main line of the family proved far more difficult. Not surprisingly the countess refused to allow him access to the family papers, without which, Percy argued, he could not prove his right. In his first effort he claimed the title as the great-grandson of Sir Richard Percy, a soldier and fifth son of the eighth earl. Unfortunately there were no documents to prove the relationship and, moreover, for it to be true Sir Richard would have to have been a grandfather at sixteen and a great-grandfather at forty-four. But the House of Lords refused to dismiss Percy's case out of hand, and in February 1673 gave both sides a month to gather evidence. In March they appeared at the bar, where testimony regarding Sir Richard's age carried the day. At the motion of the earl of Suffolk, the dowager countess's brother, Percy's petition was rejected. Nothing daunted he continued his struggle against formidable odds. In succeeding years he petitioned the king, the Lords, the Commons, and the duke of York. Further research led him to modify his claim, and in 1677 he identified another younger son of the house of Percy as his great-grandfather: Sir Ingelgram, third son of the fifth earl. Once again there was no written evidence backing his assertion. In fact, Percy's case was a weak one: Sir Ingelgram had very probably died about 1540 leaving only a single illegitimate daughter. Nevertheless, the dowager countess was not prepared to leave the case to mere proofs of evidence. She and her allies exploited their parliamentary privileges, forcing repeated delays in court, and they launched vexatious suits, forcing Percy to defend himself at great expense for years. These set-backs put his claim ever farther out of reach, though they also won him some public sympathy. Further attempts to gain the title, accompanied by a barrage of genealogical charts and printed petitions, came in 1678, 1679, 1680, 1685, and, finally, 1689. In the last case the Lords acted decisively, declaring Percy's claim to be &#145;groundless, false, and scandalous&#146;  (Brenan, 2.366). They ordered a public humiliation of the old man, who would appear in Westminster Hall wearing a paper describing him as the &#145;False and Impudent Pretender to the Earldom of Northumberland&#146;  (ibid.), a sentence which seems never to have been carried out. In the end the weight of the interests ranged against him as well as his own stubborn refusal to admit defeat destroyed James Percy. His fortune lost, he seems to have died shortly after his final humiliation by the Lords.<br>
