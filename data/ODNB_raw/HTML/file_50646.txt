<span class="headword">Chadwick <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Kershaw]</span>,  Nora</span>  (1891&#150;1972), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was born on 28 January 1891 at Great Lever, near Bolton, Lancashire, the elder of the two children of James Kershaw (1867/8&#150;1917), cotton manufacturer and mill owner, and his wife, Emma Clara, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Booth. She had a sister, Mabel, who became a Catholic and a Carmelite sister, eventually living at the convent at Waterbeach.<br>
<br>Nora Kershaw was educated at Stoneycroft School near Southport and was admitted to Cambridge University in 1910 to read English at Newnham College. At Cambridge she became a pupil of her future husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32342/', "Hector Munro Chadwick (1870&#150;1947)")</script>, professor of Anglo-Saxon. She took a second class in part one of the old medieval and modern languages tripos (English and Old English) in 1913 and a first class in part two (English literature) in 1914. On completing her degree she was appointed lecturer in English at St Andrews University where she taught herself Russian during the war years despite a heavy workload. Her father died in an accident in the war in France and her mother married a Dr Martin and settled at Houghton near St Ives, close to Cambridge, where Nora frequently visited her. The inheritance of money after the war enabled Nora to retire from St Andrews and live as a private individual in Cambridge.<br>
<br>On 4 May 1922 Nora married Hector Chadwick after a tour of Italy with him accompanied by her friend Enid Welsford; it was a happy marriage, though there were no children. Nora graduated MA from Cambridge in 1923. The Chadwicks lived initially at Paper Mills, Newmarket Road, and later in Cambridge where they entertained and educated students, and she frequently played the harp. They frequently visited archaeological sites around Britain and Ireland and co-wrote several books, including <span class="italic">The Growth of Literature</span> (1932&#150;40), a three-volume survey of heroic and oral literatures, in 1955 Nora produced an enlarged second edition of her husband's <span class="italic">The Study of Anglo-Saxon</span> (first published in 1941).<br>
<br>Nora Kershaw Chadwick, as she preferred to be called on the title-pages of her books (though she signed her name Nora Kershaw), wrote some fifty-nine books and articles. Her main interests were early Britain, Celtic culture, early Russian history, and oral literatures, especially oral epics in Russian and the Turkic languages of central Asia.<br>
<br>Nora Chadwick was an associate of Newnham College from 1923 to 1938 and a research fellow from 1941 to 1944. In 1950 she was appointed university lecturer in the early history and culture of the British Isles at Cambridge. She contributed a pioneering study of African literatures to <span class="italic">Cassell's Encyclopaedia of Literature</span> (1953) and published <span class="italic">Poetry and Letters in Early Christian Gaul</span> in 1955. In 1956 she was made a fellow of the British Academy and on retirement from her university post in 1958 was made an honorary fellow of Newnham. In addition to receiving honorary doctorates from the University of St Andrews, the University of Wales, and the National University of Ireland, she was, in 1961, made a commander of the British empire.<br>
<br>Nora Chadwick's survey of the vast corpus of Turkic oral literatures, <span class="italic">Oral Epics of Central Asia</span>, appeared in 1969. Most of her books and articles, however, focused on the Celtic cultures of ancient Britain where Welsh, Irish, Scottish, and Pictish were spoken before Latin, Norse, and English. <span class="italic">The Celts</span> (1971) continues to be a valuable introduction to the subject and remains in print. The fact that Cambridge did not establish a professorship of Celtic, to which she would willingly have contributed the bulk of her private means, was a source of great disappointment.<br>
<br>Nora Chadwick's warmth and generosity of character was attested at a dinner of her former students organized by Glyn Daniel on her eightieth birthday in 1971. Even in her old age, she haunted the Cambridge University Library assisted by her niece Dorothy. She died at the Hope Nursing Home, Brooklands Avenue, Cambridge, on 24 April 1972 after a series of strokes.<br>
