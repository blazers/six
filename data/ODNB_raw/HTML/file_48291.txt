<span class="headword">Julius Classicianus <span class="st"> [Julius Alpinus Classicianus]</span>,  Gaius</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em><span class="smallcap">AD</span> 60), <span class="occ">procurator of Britain</span>, was married to Julia Pacata, daughter of Julius Indus; he died in office at an unknown date and was buried in London by his widow. To judge from his names and from what may be inferred about his wife, Classicianus was a Gaul, probably from the province of Gallia Belgica. His father-in-law, Indus, was the Treveran noble (that is, from the Trier region) who remained loyal to Rome during the Gallic revolt of <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 21 and helped to suppress the rebel leader Julius Florus. Her cognomen suggests that Julia Pacata was born soon after this event. Classicianus himself may be assumed to have been in his forties at the time of his appointment to the post in Britain. Family recollections of the revolt of <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 21, provoked by heavy indebtedness among the Romanized &eacute;lite in Gaul (similar problems are said to have contributed to the revolt of Boudicca) may conceivably have influenced Classicianus's conduct in Britain. But this is naturally speculative. Apart from his tombstone  (Collingwood and Wright, RIB 12)&#151;two parts of which were found in 1852 and 1935, reused in a bastion of the Roman wall of London, north of Tower Hill, and now in the British Museum&#151;the only record of this man is supplied by a brief passage in Tacitus's <span class="italic">Annals</span>.<br>
<br>Classicianus was appointed procurator (chief financial officer) of Britain in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 60 or 61 as the successor of Decianus Catus, who had fled the province in panic after Boudicca's rebels had sacked Camulodunum (Colchester). Catus himself had been partly responsible for the outbreak of the revolt by his harsh treatment of the queen; and the governor, Suetonius Paullinus, after his hard-fought victory, had moved against any of the British peoples whose loyalty was uncertain or who were still hostile &#145;with fire and steel&#146;. The situation was aggravated by a food shortage, for no crops had been sown during the rebellion, and the Britons tried to divert to their own use supplies reserved for the Roman army. According to Tacitus, Classicianus caused &#145;the fierce natives to postpone making their peace by holding out hopes that Paullinus would soon be replaced by a milder governor&#146;  (Tacitus, <span class="italic">Annals</span>, xiv.38). Meanwhile he reported to Rome that there was no hope of an end to hostilities unless Paullinus was given a successor. He attributed Paullinus's setbacks to his own perverse character, his successes simply to luck. Nero reacted by dispatching a senior imperial freedman, Polyclitus, to inspect. Following Polyclitus's report, although Paullinus was retained in office for a short time, he was replaced early in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 61 by Petronius Turpilianus  (Tacitus, <span class="italic">Annals</span>, xiv.39), a nephew of the first governor of Britain, Aulus Plautius. The policy adopted both by Turpilianus and by the next governor, Trebellius Maximus (<span class="smallcap">AD</span> 63&#150;9), was indeed one of clemency, combined with which the &#145;barbarians&#146; were encouraged to &#145;acquiesce in the blandishments of vice&#146;  (Tacitus, <span class="italic">Agricola</span>, 16.2&#150;4), presumably a sarcastic reference to baths, banquets, and other aspects of the Roman way of life; and active campaigning ceased for a decade.<br>
<br>It may be that the procurator Classicianus, himself of Celtic origin and hence with some sympathy for the Britons, played an important role in reconciling them to Roman rule. He could well have stayed in office as procurator for several years; but it is quite unknown how long he lived. No descendants are known, but a Treveran named Alpinius Montanus, who served as an equestrian officer in the army of Vitellius, in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 69, could have been a son of Classicianus.<br>
