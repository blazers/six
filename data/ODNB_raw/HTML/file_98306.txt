<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tozer,  Alfred Robert</span>  (1853&#150;1906), <span class="occ">fire officer</span>, born in London on 22 December 1853, the eldest of five children of <a href="#cosubject_98307">Alfred Tozer (1831&#150;1911) [<i>see below</i>]</a> and his wife, Jessica Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brown (1832&#150;1900), belonged to a noted fire-fighting dynasty.<br>
<br>His grandfather Robert Tozer (1799&#150;1877) was the first known fire-fighter in the family, having worked for the Hand-in-Hand Fire Insurance Company's fire brigade. From 1832 until his retirement in 1860 Robert Tozer was employed by the London Fire Engine Establishment. He was married to Maria, and had at least three sons and one daughter. The eldest son, <a name="cosubject_98307"></a><span class="headword">Alfred Tozer</span>  (1831&#150;1911), <span class="occ">fire officer</span>, was born at Horsleydown, Bermondsey, Surrey, on 13 June 1831 and joined the London Fire Engine Establishment in 1851. During a celebrated career in London, he was the first fireman to receive the medal for gallantry from the Royal Society for the Protection of Life from Fire for saving two lives in a fire in 1853. In that year he married Jessica Louisa (Jessie) Brown. He volunteered to become officer in charge of fire protection at Scutari Hospital in the Crimean War, taking charge of a manual fire engine and a crew from the London Fire Engine Establishment and collaborating with Florence Nightingale. In 1860 he was promoted to chief engineer at London's Tooley Street fire station, working directly under James Braidwood. In 1862 he was appointed chief superintendent of Manchester Fire Brigade, which he reorganized. Previously the Manchester force comprised men who worked in other occupations; Tozer created a body of permanently employed firemen, and improved their equipment, inventing a small hand pump. Even during major fires, which he attended in his customary dress of bowler hat and long macintosh, he appeared unruffled, and his orders were clear and short. Although fearless, he was never reckless, and despite his brusque manner he was popular with his men. Combining administrative skill with the ability to handle an emergency, he was described as &#145;one of the great firemen of the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 6 Jan 1911). After his retirement in August 1892 he went to live on the Lancashire coast, where he died at his home, Morecambe View, Knott End, on 4 January 1911.<br>
<br>Alfred Robert Tozer was raised at the Watling Street fire station in London, accompanying his father to numerous fires, including the Tooley Street disaster of 1861, where James Braidwood died. After his family's relocation to Manchester he became a general assistant to his father and acted as messenger boy for the Manchester Fire Brigade, running between stations to carry messages of fire. In about 1870 he served an apprenticeship at the works of a hydraulic engineer. Shortly afterwards he moved to London to work at the fire-engine manufacturers Merryweather &amp; Sons, where he developed a working knowledge of fire-engine machinery. He married in London, in 1874, Charlotte Susanna (1849&#150;1896), daughter of William Biddle, railway porter. They had six sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1876, at the age of twenty-three, Tozer successfully applied for the position of chief superintendent of Bristol Fire Brigade, which was a police fire brigade comprising police constables who assumed fire-fighting duties during emergencies. His experience in Bristol made him a lifelong opponent of the police fire brigade model, which he criticized as an inefficient and uneconomical use of public funds. Instead he advocated that large towns should be protected by professional fire brigades, independent of police control, and staffed by full-time fire-fighters.<br>
<br>In 1879 Tozer applied for the position of chief superintendent of Birmingham Fire Brigade. Since 1874 the town had been protected against fire by an under-resourced police fire brigade, which ignominiously failed to rescue a family from a burning house in August 1878. In the aftermath of the fire the town council appointed Tozer, with a salary of &pound;250, and gave him <i>carte blanche</i> to reorganize the brigade along professional lines. Taking up residence at the town's central fire station on Little Cannon Street, Tozer systematically modernized the fire brigade during his first few years in office. Most of his ideas emanated from his observations of fire-fighting organization under his father. First the fire brigade was reorganized into four divisions to decentralize operations and speed up response rates, with hose carts adopted as the first line of attack. Other modern appliances purchased included a horse tender similar to that used in Manchester, a telescopic escape, and a plethora of stand and branch pipes, hand pumps, alarm bells, ceiling hooks, pocket lines, and axes, all designed to improve efficiency. Second, the retained men were all replaced by a permanent staff of fire-fighters, who underwent a period of probationary training. Third, he adopted the telegraph and street fire alarms to improve the brigade's responsiveness and flexibility. He also patented his own combined street fire alarm and first-aid box in 1892, which was adopted for use in the city. Fourth, he pressed the town council to build a new central fire station, which was opened on Upper Priory, adjacent to the newly developed Corporation Street, in 1883.<br>
<br>Tozer's influence extended beyond Birmingham: he was president of the Midlands Fire Brigade Association (1884&#150;7), which was amalgamated with other regional bodies in 1887 to form the National Fire Brigades Union, which lobbied government to make fire-fighting a statutory duty of local authorities. He was also a founder member of the Association of Professional Fire Brigade Officers in 1902, which was a driving force behind the service's professionalization during the first half of the twentieth century. In 1903 he was elected an honorary vice-president of the association as a celebration of his contribution to the service's development. To mark his invention of an ambulance cart operated by fire-fighters Tozer was also made an honourable serving brother of the order of St John in 1897.<br>
<br>Like his father Tozer preferred to hire a combination of former sailors and artisans as fire-fighters. He believed that sailors were qualified for fire-fighting work because they were used to living in barracks, climbing to great heights, working under intense weather conditions, and obeying orders. Between 1880 and 1920 roughly half of all the men appointed by Birmingham Fire Brigade were recruited from the Royal Navy. Artisans, particularly slaters, builders, carpenters, and roofers, also made good fire-fighters because they had a good local knowledge of building construction and were generally suited to the physical demands of fire-fighting.<br>
<br>Tozer caught a chill in March 1906 while directing his men at a fire. This, combined with a protracted liver infection, caused his death, at the central fire station, Birmingham, on 25 April 1906. His funeral three days later was described as &#145;one of the most imposing spectacles ever witnessed in Birmingham&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fire and Water</span>, June 1906, 52). The cort&egrave;ge was headed by an escort of firemen followed by the city's police band. The coffin, along with his helmet, belt, and axe, was carried on a fire tender. The lord mayor and numerous aldermen, councillors, and officials were present, as were the chief officers of various provincial fire brigades. In his address the Revd J. D. McCready described Tozer as &#145;a hero imbued with the spirit of a Nelson&#146;  (Ewen, 93).<br>
<br>Alfred Robert Tozer was a central figure in the building of a professional fire service in provincial England. His greatest achievement was in training a generation of fire-fighters who, through their work in the midlands and elsewhere, moulded the service's development as a branch of local government during the twentieth century. Four of his sons became serving fire-fighters. The eldest, also Alfred Robert Tozer (1875&#150;1944), joined Birmingham Fire Brigade in 1892 and was promoted assistant engineer in 1896, chief clerk in 1898, and second officer in 1901. He succeeded his father as chief fire officer in June 1906, and continued to superintend the brigade until his retirement in November 1940. William Tozer (1877&#150;1936) also served in Birmingham Fire Brigade until his appointment as chief officer at West Bromwich in 1900, where he worked until his death. Charles Wright Tozer (1879&#150;1940) joined Birmingham Fire Brigade in 1900 and in 1906, on his brother's promotion to chief officer, became second officer, a position he held until his retirement in 1938. The youngest son, Frederick Noble Tozer (1888&#150;1973), joined Manchester Fire Brigade in 1911, where he continued to serve as a station officer during the mid-1930s. The younger Alfred Robert Tozer's son, another Alfred Robert (1899&#150;1968), also served as a fireman in Birmingham Fire Brigade, joining in 1915 and rising to third officer in 1926.<br>
