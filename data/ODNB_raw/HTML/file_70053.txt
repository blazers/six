<span class="headword">Harlaw,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1500&#150;1578), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born in Edinburgh, where he became a tailor in the Canongate. He was associated with the early stages of the movement for religious reform in Scotland and fled to England, where he is said to have been ordained a deacon. However, it is quite certain that he was never appointed a chaplain to Edward VI, as has also been claimed. Probably he has been confused with John Harley, later bishop of Hereford. Harlaw returned to Edinburgh on the death of Edward VI, unlike some of the more prominent Scottish reformers who fled to the continent. There he became one of the ministers who conducted services privately in the homes of evangelicals. Later he also preached in public, and, as the number of unofficial congregations grew, he travelled widely throughout the country. Denounced for preaching at Dumfries in 1558, he was summoned to appear before the lord justice at Stirling on 10 May 1559, when he was proclaimed a rebel along with Paul Methven, John Christison, and John Willock, for usurping the authority of the church in taking into his own hands the ministry within the burgh of Perth and places nearby. He may have come to know John Willock and other Scottish exiles during his stay in England; he certainly held similar theological views to theirs, which were greatly influenced by Zwingli and Bullinger.<br>
<br>Harlaw became minister of St Cuthbert's, Edinburgh, in 1560, and was a commissioner for St Cuthbert's along with Robert Fairley of Braid at the first general assembly, which began on 20 December that year. He was also present at the assembly of June 1562, his last recorded appearance there. He does not appear to have ever been appointed by a general assembly to undertake any duties on behalf of the church, but concentrated on his ministry within Edinburgh. On 25 June 1566, a supplication was presented to the assembly on behalf of Robert Stewart, commendator of Holyrood Abbey and patron of the benefice, for the appointment of a former canon of Holyrood as minister of St Cuthbert's in place of Harlaw. The assembly summoned some of the elders of the parish, who opposed this proposal because&#151;according to the order of admission of ministers to parishes&#151;the congregation had to &#145;elect&#146; the presentee. The congregation was not prepared to do this, and Harlaw remained minister there. Following the death of the vicar, Archibald Hamilton, who had been in possession since at least 1547, Harlaw was presented to the vicarage under the privy seal on 6 February 1573. From 1574, however, he was overshadowed by the appointment of Robert Pont, one of the outstanding ministers of that era, as his junior colleague. On his death in 1578 Harlaw was succeeded by Pont. Nothing is known of Harlaw's wife, but she may have been English, as their grandson William, the son of Nathaniel, minister of Ormiston, became a minister in the Church of England.<br>
