<span class="headword">Perkins,  Angier March</span>  (1799&#150;1881), <span class="occ">heating and steam engineer</span>, was born on 21 August 1799, at Old Newburyport, Massachusetts, USA, the second son of the six children of <a name="cosubject_53952"></a><span class="headword">Jacob Perkins</span>  (1766&#150;1849)<span class="occ"></span> and his wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Greenleaf (1770&#150;1837). He was named after his father's brother-in-law and close friend, Angier March. Jacob Perkins, after a brief schooling, had been apprenticed to Edward Davis, a goldsmith, where he acquired his facility for fine metalwork and machinery. When Davis died in 1781, Jacob Perkins, aged fifteen, took charge of the business for his widow. Over the following years he embarked on a multitude of innovative projects, handing over the subsequent tedious business of production to family and friends. His most important lines were the manufacture of dies for coinage, and siderography: the technique of printing banknotes from a sequence of engraved steel plates, so as to defy counterfeiting. In 1809 he met Joseph Chessborough Dyer, a wealthy American who shortly afterwards went to England, where he acted as the patent agent for American inventors. Through this channel Jacob Perkins's siderographic plates became known in England.<br>
<br>In the course of his involvement with coins and banknotes, Jacob Perkins took his family to Philadelphia in 1817, then went to England in 1819 with his elder son, Ebenezer (1797&#150;1842), in pursuit of a contract for engraving banknotes for the Bank of England. They won the contract; Dyer backed Jacob Perkins with &pound;12,500, and machinery and men were brought over for the firm, known initially as Perkins, Fairman, and Heath, to commence printing. Angier Perkins later spoke of his own arrival in England:<blockquote>We embarked in the ship <i>Electra</i>, 500 tons, about November 1821 and arrived in England in thirty days where we found my father and brother and all our friends. I &hellip; went at once into the employment of my father and his partners and was engaged for the next eight years in manufacturing banknotes, dies and plates. During the latter part of the time I taught other parties to do the work I was engaged upon and my services in the firm became unnecessary and I found myself obliged to obtain other business. (Bathe, 91)</blockquote>The family resided in Fleet Street, in the City of London, above the business premises.<br>
<br>Jacob Perkins soon left his printing business in the hands of Angier, and then of his son-in-law Joshua Butters Bacon. In 1839 Perkins, Bacon, and Petch (as it was then known) was the firm chosen to print the first engraved adhesive stamps for the new penny post. Meanwhile Jacob Perkins's inventive mind turned to the advantages of high-pressure steam, as applied to locomotives, and to a &#145;steam-gun&#146; (which the English military establishment spurned though the French were briefly tempted), to refrigeration plant, and to the creation of the Adelaide Gallery of Practical Sciences. This establishment, located at the western end of the Strand, opened in 1832 for the display and demonstration of new inventions and works of art. By the end of the 1840s, having ceased to draw the scientific and mechanically minded, it declined into a mere place of vulgar entertainment. In 1836 Hannah Perkins returned to Newburyport, where she died on 5 October 1837. Jacob Perkins continued to live with his son Angier, being now entirely dependent on him. On 15 July 1849 he took to his bed with what proved to be acute enteritis, and he died on 30 July. He was buried in the family vault at Kensal Green cemetery, which had been constructed for the interment of his daughter Louisa Jane in 1833.<br>
<br>Angier Perkins established his independent business as a heating and steam engineer in 1828, at Harpur Street, Holborn. In 1831 he married Julia Georgiana Brown and set up house, with his parents and sisters (his brother having returned to America), at 21 Great Coram Street, Bloomsbury. The same year he filed the first of many patents relating to heating apparatus. His first heating system was installed in 1832 at the villa of J. Horsley Palmer (1779&#150;1858), governor of the Bank of England, at Fulham, where it was used for forcing grapes in wintertime. Another plant was erected in the Guardian Fire office in the City of London. At this time he took enlarged premises at Francis Street, off Gray's Inn Road, which he shared with his father, whose inventive mind remained as fertile as ever, despite his lack of business success.<br>
<br>Shortly after 1843 Perkins moved to 18 Regent Square, a more imposing dwelling, befitting his increasing prosperity. His involvement with steam engineering led him to propose improved methods of manufacturing and smelting iron, and designs for pipe couples and joints. His high-pressure steam heating systems were adapted to industrial use; his mobile baker's oven, exhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1867, was earlier adopted by the British army.<br>
<br>Perkins's eldest son, Angier Greenleaf (1832&#150;1871), also an engineer, died young; his second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21972/', "Loftus Perkins")</script>, was apprenticed to his father, probably in 1848. He was taken into partnership in 1866, after which the firm traded as A. M. Perkins &amp; Son. Angier Perkins was elected an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in May 1840, and was a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts from 1849. He died at his home, 140 Abbey Road, Hampstead, London, on 22 April 1881 and was interred in the family vault at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
