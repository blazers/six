<span class="headword">Shiels,  William</span>  (1848&#150;1904), <span class="occ">politician in Australia</span>, was born at Maghera, co. Londonderry, on 3 December 1848, the son of Robert Shiels, a farmer, and his wife, Patricia Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kelly. Robert Shiels and the youngest of their four children died within weeks of the family's arrival in Victoria, Australia, early in 1855. Patricia Shiels married William Dickins in 1857.<br>
<br>Shiels was educated at Scotch College, Melbourne (1862&#150;6), and privately. He then had a brilliant career at the University of Melbourne (1867&#150;73), where, despite interrupting his studies because of ill health, he took a double first, won the vice-chancellor's essay prize, and in 1873 graduated LLB. He began to practise, but overwork weakened his already delicate constitution and caused him to go as a private tutor to landed families in western Victoria and in South Australia. At Naracoorte, South Australia, he met Jane (<i>b</i>. 1857/8), the daughter of John Robertson, a prominent pastoralist of Struan House; they married on 6 May 1885 and settled in Melbourne, first at suburban Hawthorn, and later at St Kilda.<br>
<br>Shiels had opposed the radical government of Graham Berry in 1877. Elected in 1880 to the legislative assembly for pastoral Normanby (which he held until the 1904 redistribution), from his maiden speech he established a reputation for liberal views, eloquently expressed. He supported breakaway liberal Presbyterians and opposed strict Sabbatarianism, and the Sunday Society published as its manifesto his parliamentary speech of 4 July 1883 supporting the Sunday opening of the Melbourne Library and Museum. In the interests of women, Shiels carried amendments in the 1880s to the divorce and married women's property acts, and to the law of slander as it concerned allegations of adultery and unchastity. Although his reform initiatives fell short of equal access to divorce for women, his 1887 bill became a test of Australian self-government when the imperial government refused assent. South Australia, New South Wales, Queensland, and Tasmania supported his 1890 visit to London, where his advocacy persuaded the Salisbury government to give way.<br>
<br>Fiscal prudence was the keynote of Shiels's assault on the boom-time extravagances of the Gillies&#150;Deakin ministries (1883&#150;9), including vigorous attacks on the 1886 and 1889 budgets. When he became attorney-general and minister of railways in James Munro's government in November 1890, he wrested political control of railway expenditure from the commissioners and forced their resignations. As premier from 16 February 1892, Shiels&#151;the &#145;young man with a jaunty air&#146;  (Hoare)&#151;won a resounding general election victory on 20 April on a platform of retrenchment. Unable, however, to satisfy the electorate's mood for strict economy and the prosecution of fraudulent boomsters, his ministry was defeated on 18 January 1893.<br>
<br>Ill health, diagnosed as angina pectoris, led to Shiels's frequent absence from parliament. In 1899 he re-emerged to overthrow the liberal Turner government. He became treasurer and minister for railways in the conservative McLean ministry (1899&#150;1900) and again in the Irvine ministry (1902&#150;4). His marathon budget speeches, delivered seated and sustained by draughts of whisky and champagne, excited much admiration. Shiels reduced the public service, cut salaries, raised income tax, provoked and crushed a strike of railway workers, and returned Victoria to solvency. His enemies named him &#145;Slippery&#146; Shiels.<br>
<br>Deteriorating health obliged Shiels to leave the treasury in July 1903 and retire as a minister the following February, and reduced him to invalidism from early 1904. After months of agony, courageously borne, he died at Struan House, his mother-in-law's home in Naracoorte, South Australia, on 17 December 1904, survived by his wife, three sons, and a daughter. He was buried on 19 December with Presbyterian forms and, according to his wishes, with no flowers or special mourning, in a spot he had chosen in the Struan private cemetery.<br>
<br>Shiels the social liberal was a fiscal conservative. His democratic and egalitarian instincts, including support for women's rights, sat easily with his dedication to financial probity. He was a devoted parliamentarian, a gifted speaker, an able administrator, and a treasurer who possessed what William Irvine called &#145;the very rare fluency of making an array of figures live and move before his audience&#146;  (letter to Jane Shiels, Shiels papers, La Trobe L., Vic.).<br>
