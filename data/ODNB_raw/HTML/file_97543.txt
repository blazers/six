<span class="headword">Cunliffe,  Marcus Falkner</span>  (1922&#150;1990), <span class="occ">Americanist</span>, was born on 5 July 1922 at the Municipal Maternity and Infants' Hospital, Castleton, near Rochdale, the second son of Harold Cunliffe (1888&#150;1970), farmer, and his wife, Kathleen Eleanor Falkner (1897&#150;1972), who was from Monmouthshire; her father had served in the Royal Artillery before taking up an administrative post with a south Wales steel company. The family lived at Diggle, on the edge of the Pennines, before Harold Cunliffe abandoned the land and began a profitable laundry business in Manchester, to which he drove daily. When Marcus was eight, the family and its business moved to Newcastle upon Tyne. Marcus first attended an elementary school in Jesmond, and then the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle, from 1932 to 1940. At the latter he was heavily influenced by two masters: Samuel Middlebrook, a historian; and the poet Michael Roberts (<i>d</i>. 1948), editor of the <span class="italic">Faber Book of English Verse</span>, as well as by Roberts's wife, Janet Adam Smith (<i>d</i>. 1999), who worked on the editorial staff of the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>. In 1939 the school was evacuated to Penrith, Cumberland.<br>
<br>In October of the following year, Cunliffe gained an open scholarship to Oriel College, Oxford. He remained for five terms before attending officer cadet training courses at Perham Down, Wiltshire, and Sandhurst. In 1942 he was commissioned into the Royal Tank regiment. From June 1944 until May 1945 Cunliffe served (mainly as an intelligence officer) with 144 regiment, Royal Armoured Corps, 33 armoured brigade, seeing action in north-west France, Belgium (including the Ardennes counter-offensive), the Netherlands, and Germany. Towards the end of the war, 144 regiment was renamed 4th Royal Tank regiment. In August 1945 Cunliffe was given a privileged attachment to the military history team at the headquarters of the British army of the Rhine. He worked on an account of the twenty-first army group's campaigns that was later published (with co-author Hugh Darby) as <span class="italic">A Short Story of 21 Army Group</span> (1947).<br>
<br>In January 1946 Cunliffe returned to Oxford to read for the abbreviated &#145;wartime&#146; BA degree in modern history, and in October 1947 he gained first-class honours. As his degree course was one year shorter than conventional degrees, he was permitted to spend the remaining money from his scholarship on postgraduate research. He completed a BLitt thesis entitled &#145;The British army as a social institution, 1815&#150;60&#146;. Cunliffe began by specializing in British history, and his serious interest in United States history was really a development after his time at Oriel. He had been impressed by the American contribution to the allied victory in 1945, had been absorbed by American literature since his schooldays, and was captivated by American culture, style, and the movies. He recalled that he had been &#145;cheered by the easy abundance of post-war America&#146;. Indeed, he had been &#145;taken&#146; by America  (Cunliffe, &#145;Backward glances&#146;, 85, 86&#150;7). As a result, he spent the years 1947 to 1949 as a Commonwealth fellow at Yale University, where he studied under David Potter and Ralph Gabriel.<br>
<br>In 1949 Cunliffe was appointed to the first lectureship in American studies in Britain at the University of Manchester. He proved a true pioneer in developing an American studies degree in a British university. He developed in his teaching interdisciplinary approaches that brought together perspectives derived from the combination of history and literature. His task was not easy, as British university life in the 1950s was insular and conservative. Cunliffe zealously built up the American collection in the university library (&#145;All that American rubbish&#146; was the unguarded opinion of the senior staff  (private information)). Appointed head of department, he recruited a group of distinguished colleagues, including (among others) Dennis Welland, Maldwyn A. Jones, and Howard Temperley. The year 1954 was one of achievement: he spent most of it as a Commonwealth (now called Harkness) fellow at the University of Chicago and was promoted to senior lecturer, and his first major book on an American theme, <span class="italic">The Literature of the United States</span>, was published. Cunliffe's approach was historical, and successfully blended &#145;biographical and socio-cultural information with stylistic and aesthetic observations&#146;  (4th edn, 10). <span class="italic">The Literature of the United States</span> remained the standard work for decades, and went through three further editions; the fourth edition (1986) included two new chapters on women writers and southern literature. The interdisciplinary direction that Cunliffe imparted to the subject was reinforced by his devotion to the British Association for American Studies, founded in 1955. He served as its first secretary and then as chairman from 1962 to 1965.<br>
<br>Cunliffe devoted much of the early 1950s to writing British regimental history. <span class="italic">The Royal Irish Fusiliers, 1793&#150;1945</span> (1952) and <span class="italic">History of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, 1919&#150;1955</span> (1956) are clearly the successful discharging of past obligations. Yet they played an important part in Cunliffe's future development because he began to demonstrate a skill at combining telling detail with the broad overview. This combination is evident in two of his mature books published at the end of the decade. <span class="italic">George Washington: Man and Monument</span> (1958) is a subtle short biography linked to an analysis of Washington as a national symbol. <span class="italic">The Nation Takes Shape, 1789&#150;1837</span> (1959) offers a cogent, synoptic account of the period. Producing two books simultaneously was made possible by a fellowship held in 1957&#150;8 at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Palo Alto, California.<br>
<br>In 1949 Cunliffe married <a href="#cosubject_97543">Mitzi Solomon [<i>see below</i>]</a>. They had three children: Antonia, Shay, and Jason. The Cunliffes were an extraordinarily colourful couple. Their house in Didsbury, Maldwyn Jones recalled, &#145;became an acknowledged centre, not only for University colleagues, but also for the varied intellectuals whom the press dubbed the &#147;Didsbury set&#148;&#146;. Cunliffe was generous, relaxed, charming, urbane, vivacious, witty, playful, and attractive to women. He was also a man of paradoxes and contradictions. His appearance changed over time from the well-groomed and clipped air of the ex-officer in tweed suits to a more flamboyant and modish look with longish hair and beard. An undergraduate at Manchester recalled that &#145;I was as impressed by his sartorial splendour (those <i>ties</i>) and glimpses of a lifestyle I had associated with film stars and actors, as with his seemingly inexhaustible knowledge of American history, literature &hellip; and popular culture&#146;  (White). But the showman, whether masquerading as bohemian or high society figure, concealed a deceptive capacity for hard work.<br>
<br>From 1959 to 1960 Cunliffe spent a year as visiting professor at Harvard, where he cemented a growing friendship with Arthur M. Schlesinger junior. Although given the chair of American history and institutions in 1959, Cunliffe had grown bored with Manchester, and in 1965 was appointed professor of American studies at the University of Sussex. He played a major part in establishing that university's exciting reputation during its first hectic decade. American studies at Sussex was at the forefront of new developments, as the subject embraced the social sciences and eventually topics such as women's history. Cunliffe moved easily and without self-consciousness in the circles inhabited by the most distinguished of American historians. His interest in historiography was demonstrated by the work he edited with Robin W. Winks, <span class="italic">Pastmasters: Some Essays on American Historians</span> (1969). In 1972 Cunliffe's love affair with Sussex and his dedication to liberal values were badly bruised by the &#145;Huntington affair&#146;. An invitation issued by a colleague to Samuel P. Huntington, an adviser to the Johnson administration during the Vietnam war, distinguished political scientist, and author of <span class="italic">The Soldier and the State</span> (1957), to lecture at Sussex, provoked outrage and denunciation. Cunliffe supported the case for freedom of speech. This upheaval in his professional life coincided with personal storms and the formal end of his first marriage in 1971. The academic year 1969&#150;70 had been spent at the graduate centre of the City University of New York. While living in New York he met and then in November 1971 married the journalist Lesley Hume (1945&#150;1997).<br>
<br>Cunliffe's interests from the 1960s onwards revolved around the history of the presidency, military history, and aspects of American national identity. The last two themes tended to coalesce and resulted in Cunliffe's most important, original, and influential contribution to scholarship: <span class="italic">Soldiers and Civilians: the Martial Spirit in America, 1775&#150;1865</span> (1968). This book is a study of national character and values that places the American military experience within a social context. Cunliffe was ahead of his time in developing a sophisticated concept of military history. The subject was deeply unfashionable at the time of the book's publication in the USA, when as a result of disillusion with the Vietnam war all things military were decried. <span class="italic">Soldiers and Civilians</span> did not receive the attention or praise that it deserved. Also in 1968 Cunliffe published <span class="italic">The Presidency</span> (producing books in pairs was characteristic of him). An enlarged edition appeared in Britain under the title <span class="italic">American Presidents and the Presidency</span> in 1972. Although a work of synthesis, this remains (in its third edition) one of Cunliffe's most enjoyable and sparkling books.<br>
<br>In 1973&#150;4 Cunliffe spent another year in the USA, this time as visiting professor at the University of Michigan. He edited volumes 7 and 8, on American literature, for the <span class="italic">Sphere History of Literature in the English Language</span>. A year later he collaborated with his wife in producing <span class="italic">Burke's Presidential Families of the USA</span> (1975), voted &#145;Reference book of the year&#146; by the <span class="italic">US Library Journal</span>. Cunliffe was also swept up by the ferment of debate over slavery and race relations provoked by Robert W. Fogel and Stanley L. Engerman's <span class="italic">Time on the Cross</span> (2 vols., 1974). His contribution was <span class="italic">Chattel Slavery and Wage Slavery: the Anglo-American Context, 1830&#150;1860</span> (1979), a provocative study of American resentment over British criticisms of slavery. It had originally started life as the Lamar memorial lectures delivered in April 1978 at Mercer University, Macon, Georgia. Thereafter he produced no major work on American history: for several years he found the subject too restricting, and turned to world history, editing <span class="italic">The Times History of our Times</span> (1971) and writing <span class="italic">The Age of Expansion, 1848&#150;1917</span> (1974).<br>
<br>The late 1970s were a period of some frustration and disenchantment. Cunliffe sought solace on the American academic scene: in 1976 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Pennsylvania; 1977&#150;8 was spent as a fellow of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, Washington, DC; and he delivered the 1978 Jefferson memorial lectures at Berkeley, although these remained unpublished. The failure of his application for the Rhodes chair in American history at Oxford was a disappointment. Cunliffe had personal reasons for contemplating a permanent move across the Atlantic. In 1978 he met the American historian Phyllis Marynick Palmer (<i>b</i>. 1944), whom he married in 1984, his second marriage having ended in divorce in 1979.<br>
<br>Consequently, in 1980 Cunliffe left Sussex and moved to the George Washington University, Washington, DC, as university professor. He was only the second person in the history of that university to hold the title. The last decade of his life was spent keeping his older works in print and producing a volume of his essays, published posthumously as <span class="italic">In Search of America: Transatlantic Essays, 1951&#150;1990</span> (1991). He admitted, &#145;I feel I have spent too much time in recent years putting coats of paint on old structures instead of completing new ones &hellip;&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Cunliffe was essentially a very modest man, but he tended to underestimate the esteem in which he was held. He certainly had not run out of ideas. In 1989 he signed a contract to write a collective biography of all the Roosevelts. He was acknowledged as the most fertile, creative, original, and adventurous British Americanist of his generation. He was an inspired (and inspiring) teacher, with a clutch of distinguished pupils: Sir Malcolm Bradbury (1931&#150;2000), Michael J. Heale, and Michael C. C. Adams, among many others. He worked ceaselessly for the United States Information Agency, lecturing in India, Japan, Kenya, and much of Europe on their behalf. As a historian, he was happiest dealing with the period from 1775 to 1865, but he was more than just a historian, and his range was formidable. His purview swept every aspect of American culture and ideas, including art (the pictorial images in his books are more than just decorative), music, culture, mythology, literature, and thought, although his literary writings tend to treat thought as a branch of the history of ideas. Cunliffe had always turned his back on specialization; he was a polymath who was influenced by the social sciences, for his writings reveal a surprising attachment to &#145;models&#146; as a method of explanation and means of comparison. It was emblematic of his paradoxical nature that his swirling visual and literary sense was complemented by a preference for typologies. All his writings are adorned with a graceful and evocative prose style. Cunliffe as a commentator on America stands comparison with Lord Bryce and Sir Denis Brogan.<br>
<br>Although an academic by training and inclination, Cunliffe had no patience with theoretical disputes. He had much in common with the pre-war man of letters, for example Leonard Woolf, who ignored disciplinary boundaries and scorned narrow specialization. Cunliffe, an indefatigable correspondent, cultivated a glamour and sage-like manner consistent with this kind of public figure. The true significance of his writings can be found in his dissection of ideas of American distinctiveness and the quest for American national identity. Cunliffe argued that the USA was not as exceptional as many American writers claimed. He always stressed the European (and especially British) threads in the fabric of American culture. In the 1960s he had been very critical of assumptions that the south was a distinct American section. The inter-connections between Western cultures were a prominent theme in Cunliffe's corpus (he was a talented linguist, spoke French fluently, and had good German and also some Italian). In the mid-1980s, perhaps as a reaction to the chauvinism of the Reagan years, he embarked on an uncompleted, ambitious project on the emergence of the great popular author, a comparison of Walter Scott, Charles Dickens, Mark Twain, and Victor Hugo. He died of leukaemia in the George Washington University Memorial Hospital, Washington, DC, on Sunday 2 September 1990 and was cremated.<br>
<br>Cunliffe's first wife, <a name="cosubject_97543"></a><span class="headword">Mitzi Cunliffe</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Solomon]</span>  (1918&#150;2006), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born in New York on 1 January 1918, the daughter of a wealthy Jewish manufacturer of glass products. She attended the Art Students League of New York and Columbia University, where she graduated MA in 1940. Among wartime commissions was one for marble sculptures for cruise liners owned by American Export Lines. After the war she spent a year at the Acad&eacute;mie Colarossi in Paris, and also studied in Sweden. She moved to England after her marriage to Marcus Cunliffe. Her first major commission was for two pieces for the Festival of Britain in 1951, one of which (<span class="italic">Root Bodied Forth</span>, depicting intertwined figures emerging from a tree) was displayed at the entrance to the festival. (The other was a pair of bronze door handles in the form of hands, for the Regatta Restaurant.) In 1955 she was commissioned to produce a relief panel for Heaton Park pumping station, showing the water's journey from Haweswater to Manchester; the building was listed in 1998 as a &#145;complete work of art&#146;, still at the time of her death the only such listing for a post-war public building. Also in 1955, she was commissioned by the Guild of Television Producers and Directors (which merged with the British Film Academy in 1958 to form the Society of Film and Television Arts, renamed the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 1976) to design an award for the guild's annual prizegiving ceremony. The resulting golden theatrical mask was still in use for BAFTA awards more than half a century later. In 1957 she designed what was then the largest pierced bronze screen in the world, depicting scenes from the Wars of the Roses, for Lewis's department store in Liverpool. As well as sculptures and screens she designed textiles, jewellery, and ceramics. In the 1960s she developed techniques for the mass production of architectural decorations, and her exhibition &#145;Sculpture by the Yard&#146; toured Britain and western Europe between 1967 and 1971. Her last major commission was for four carved stone panels for Scottish Life House, London, in 1970. About the time of the break-up of her marriage she was forced by arthritis and retinal problems to abandon sculpture, and turned instead to teaching, first at Thames Polytechnic from 1971 to 1976, and then in North America, at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, New York, the University of Pennsylvania, and Concordia University, Montreal. Dynamic, vivacious, and always strikingly dressed, she made a lasting impression on her students. Her later years were clouded by the onset of Alzheimer's disease and she moved back to England to be near her children. She died in Oxford on 30 December 2006.<br>
