<span class="headword">Rattray,  Robert Sutherland</span>  (1881&#150;1938), <span class="occ">colonial official and ethnographer</span>, was born on 5 September 1881 in Bahr, Bengal, the fourth child of Arthur Rattray, Indian civil servant, and his wife, Mary Sutherland. A scion of distinguished Anglo-Indian families, he was sent home as a child to Gatehouse of Fleet in Scotland where, before his father's retirement from the Indian Civil Service, he and a sister were cared for by a great-aunt. After local schooling he attended Stirling high school but left to join the imperial yeomanry at the outbreak of the South African War in 1899. In December 1902 he joined the central African trading company, the African Lakes Corporation. Initially based in Blantyre, Nyasaland, he was soon sent &#145;up-country&#146; to Lilongwe. While his leisure was dedicated to a lifetime devotion to game shooting, here Rattray began his serious study of what he initially called &#145;folklore&#146;, which he learned from local hunters whose languages he mastered. Much of this material appeared in his first publication, <span class="italic">Folklore, Stories and Songs in Chinyanja</span> (1907).<br>
<br>In 1906 Rattray joined the customs service of the west African colony of the Gold Coast. Taking advantage of a Colonial Office scheme, he enrolled in his first home leave as a student in anthropology at Exeter College, Oxford, where he studied with R. R. Marett, eventually securing a diploma in 1914, the degree of BSc in 1925, and that of DSc in 1929. During the same leave he joined Gray's Inn and began writing his law examinations before returning to his post in the eastern Gold Coast. In 1913 he was appointed assistant district commissioner in Ejura, in the northern region of Asante. A talented linguist, Rattray had already mastered the lingua franca of many of the labourers and traders in the northern Gold Coast. This led to his <span class="italic">Hausa Folklore</span> and his <span class="italic">Elementary Mole Grammar</span> of 1918. Now, in Asante, his interest turned to the culture of the dominant political force of the pre-colonial Gold Coast, a polity which, after a sequence of wars, had been finally defeated by the British in 1896. The first fruit of his study was <span class="italic">Ashanti Proverbs</span> (1916). Although the work bore the patronizing subtitle &#145;The primitive ethics of a savage people&#146;, what Rattray consciously displayed was both sophisticated and complex.<br>
<br>In 1914 Rattray married Constance Mary Stanley, with whom he returned to the Gold Coast as war broke out with Germany. Created a captain in the Gold Coast regiment&#151;he used this title for the rest of his life&#151;he saw action during the invasion of the German colony of Togoland; he was now asked to administer part of the conquered territory, though its Ewe-speaking population never attracted his ethnographic interest. During leave in 1915 he worked further on his law examinations, and he was called to the bar in 1918; in the same leave he learned to fly. In 1919 he was posted to the colonial capital, Accra, as assistant colonial secretary and clerk to the legislative assembly; this bored him. Relief came with his appointment as special commissioner and the first &#145;government anthropologist&#146; in 1920, a post exclusively attached to the Asante region. Reflecting his academic training, his initial enquiries were focused on religion and kinship.<br>
<br>Although an employee of government, Rattray's research agenda was only slightly shaped by administrative imperatives. Thus the first results of his work were to be a general survey, <span class="italic">Ashanti</span> (1923), followed by <span class="italic">Religion and Art in Ashanti</span> (1927). The latter displays not only the command of ethnographic detail of the former but also a deep sympathy with the moral basis of Asante cosmology. In the same period he played a major part in organizing the much admired Gold Coast exhibits at the British Empire Exhibition of 1924. Rattray's work was becoming relevant to the administrative ambition to restore the Asante confederacy. His legal training and the current concerns of social anthropology rather than policy, however, led him to the collection of the material which was published in his <span class="italic">Ashanti Law and Constitution</span> (1929). Much of the colonial understanding of Asante which governed the eventual restoration of the confederacy in 1936 was drawn from this influential book. Taken together, his three major books on the Asante people constitute the most detailed ethnographic study of any African people in the inter-war period and retain their importance as primary sources for modern scholars.<br>
<br>Rattray was felt to be far too eccentric and temperamental to rise to higher levels of the administration; however, because of his growing reputation he was given the status and pay of a provincial commissioner but without the duties. His interest in the Asante seems to have declined and his final book on this polity, <span class="italic">Akan-Ashanti Folk-Tales</span> (1930), is basically raw, un-analysed data. He was now drawn to the northern Gold Coast, and his research here resulted in his <span class="italic">Tribes of the Ashanti Hinterland</span> (1932). An enthusiastic pilot, Rattray flew his biplane from London to Accra in 1928, shortly before retiring from the colonial service. On retirement he unsuccessfully pursued innumerable academic posts and research grants. His much respected empirical work had not been followed by theoretical publications; this and his age presumably conspired against an academic career, although he taught Hausa to colonial service staff in Cambridge in the mid-1930s. He was to irritate the Colonial Office by writing articles hostile to the policy of indirect rule. Always delighted by evidence of African cultural self-assertion, he dedicated his romantic novel <span class="italic">The Leopard Princess</span> (1934) to Paul Robeson.<br>
<br>Rattray's private life is something of a mystery. His marriage failed, and he spent years unsuccessfully trying to divorce his wife. He was the father of a girl, the result of a liaison with a Frenchwoman during a leave period taken in France. He was killed in a gliding accident on 14 May 1938 at Farmoor, Oxfordshire.<br>
