<span class="headword">Fawkes,  Isaac</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1731), <span class="occ">magician</span>, is first recorded in newspaper puffs promoting his booth at Bartholomew fair in 1722. It is clear from their references to his patronage by the prince of Wales and the extent of his public renown that his reputation had been set for some time before this. Until 1726 Fawkes's show consisted of sleight-of-hand tricks involving &#145;Cards, Eggs, Corn, Mice, curious India Birds, and Money&#146;  (<span class="italic">Saturday's Post</span>, 9 March 1722) followed by his young son, the &#145;posture-master&#146;, who performed various bodily transformations as well as the &#145;Italian Scaramouche Dance, with two Heads, four Legs and but one Body&#146;  (quoted in Houdini, 60). These he performed in a variety of other London fair booths including ones at Southwark fair, Tower Hill, Hyde Park, and Upper Moorfields as well as in the Long Room in Queen Ann's Tavern in Southwark, the French Theatre in Haymarket, and the Cock and Half-Moon tavern in Chancery Lane. Occasionally he worked in association with Powell junior, son of the famous puppeteer Martin Powell.<br>
<br>During 1726 Fawkes both moved to what became known as Fawkes's Theatre, James Street, Haymarket, and began a highly profitable partnership with the clock and automata maker Christopher Pinchbeck (1669/70&#150;1732) of Fleet Street, inventor of the copper/zinc alloy which still carries his name. Although Pinchbeck received no billing and did not tour with the shows, his craftsmanship was behind all Fawkes's apparatus during this period. While the &#145;Venetian machine&#146; showed different mechanically operated pictorial representations of landscapes from around the world (thus anticipating items displayed in the nineteenth century in London's Egyptian Hall), from 1730 onwards it was the &#145;Apple tree&#146; which &#145;bore ripe apples in less than a Minute's Time&#146;  (<span class="italic">British Journal</span>, 20 Feb 1731), which received top billing. Fawkes still toured the fair booths of London with this show under titles such as the &#145;Grand Theatre of the Muses&#146; or &#145;Multum in Parvo&#146; and it was in one such booth that his fortunes took a turn for the worse when, early in 1731, a fire in an adjacent booth frightened his wife into a &#145;premature confinement&#146;; his own death, the precise cause of which is not known, followed on 25 May 1731; he was buried in St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster. He left his considerable financial legacy of &pound;10,000 (though some historians have questioned this sum) to his wife, Alice (<i>d</i>. 1745); she went on to marry Pinchbeck's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22288/', "Edward Pinchbeck (1713?&#150;1766?)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50051/', "Pinchbeck family")</script>] the following year, and he, together with Fawkes's son, continued the business partnership forged by their fathers.<br>
<br>Several significant pictorial representations of Fawkes and his work exist. Two of these are contained within engravings by William Hogarth&#151;<span class="italic">Masquerades and Operas</span> (or <span class="italic">The Taste of the Town</span>; 1724) which shows a London crowd clambering into the Long Room under a sign &#145;Faux Dex-terity of Hand&#146;, and <span class="italic">Southwark Fair</span> (1733), a section of which shows Fawkes alongside contortionists with a bird in one hand and dice in the other. Although to Hogarth Fawkes epitomized an &#145;English Stage / Debauch'd by fool'ries&#146;  (<span class="italic">Masquerades and Operas</span>), thereby confirming the bankruptcy of aristocratic patronage and taste, for Harry Houdini he was the &#145;cleverest sleight-of-hand performer that magic has ever known&#146;  (Houdini, 56). Both his success and his importance in the history of magical performers lie in the fact that he pioneered the harnessing of the ancient and anti-Enlightenment tradition of magic with complex forms of mechanization; this clearly anticipated more modern preoccupations with the apparatus of vision.<br>
