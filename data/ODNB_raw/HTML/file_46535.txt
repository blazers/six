<span class="headword">Denny <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Fitzmaurice]</span>, Lady  Arbella</span>  (1707&#150;1792), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was the second daughter of Thomas Fitzmaurice (<i>d</i>. 1741), twenty-first lord of Kerry, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1737), the daughter of Sir William Petty. She grew up at Lixnaw Castle, Tralee, becoming Lady Arbella on her father's creation as first earl of Kerry on 17 January 1722. On 26 August 1727 she married Colonel Arthur Denny, MP for County Kerry; they had no children and she was widowed on 8 August 1742. In 1748 she settled in Blackrock, co. Dublin, in a house leased from Lord Fitzwilliam. In 1751 she made a continental tour and returned to Dublin some time in the following year.<br>
<br>Denny began to visit the Dublin Foundling Hospital with other women in November 1759. The hospital was part of the Dublin workhouse, and the mortality rates among the infants and children abandoned there were extremely high. Denny hired the wet-nurses for the institution and paid a bounty from her own funds to nurses in the country who provided good care. In addition, she spent over &pound;4000 enlarging and improving the hospital buildings. The changes she instituted went some way to reducing the mortality rate, and in 1761 a committee of the Irish House of Commons recognized the success of her work. A contemporary noted that she &#145;had put a stop to barbarity and murder and saved the lives of thousands&#146;  (Robins, 25). In recognition of her work she was awarded the freedom of the city of Dublin in 1765. She remained a visitor at the hospital until 1778.<br>
<br>Denny's work in the foundling hospital also brought to her attention the plight of young women who were at risk of becoming prostitutes. In consequence she opened the first Magdalen asylum, a rescue home for such women, in Dublin in 1767. A chapel attached to the asylum was opened in 1768 and served to raise funds for the institution. Denny was also a member of the ladies' committee of the Rotunda Lying-In Hospital, and used her social standing and family connections to promote her charitable schemes. Some of her activities caused controversy. During the 1770s she exerted her influence by having the archbishop of Dublin silence Lady Huntingdon's chaplain, Henry Peckwell, for views she considered subversive to the church establishment. This was to cause some division between herself and Lady Moira, Peckwell's influential patron and the daughter of Lady Huntingdon.<br>
<br>In 1765 Denny was appointed a patroness of the silk warehouse of the Royal Dublin Society, and in the following year was the first woman to be elected a member (honorary) of the society. She took a keen interest in damask manufacture and gave advice about damask patterns through the society. She was also attributed with introducing carpet weaving into Ireland and bred silkworms at her Blackrock home. Described by her cousin William, first marquess of Lansdowne, as &#145;the only example I had before me of the two qualities of mind which most adorn and dignify life&#151;amiability and independence&#146;. She was thanked by the society in 1770 &#145;for her humane and constant attention to the welfare of this Kingdom&#146;  (Butler, 1.15). Denny died on 18 March 1792 at her home, Peafield Cliff, Blackrock, and was buried in the family vault beneath the chancel of the church at Tralee.<br>
