<span class="headword">Oftfor</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>699), <span class="occ">bishop of Worcester</span>, was a pupil of Abbess Hild of Whitby (<i>d</i>. 680), and studied the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in her monasteries at Whitby and Hartlepool. &#145;Being anxious to reach still greater heights&#146;, he proceeded to Canterbury to study with the learned Theodore of Tarsus (archbishop from 669 to 690), before going on to Rome, &#145;which in those days was considered to be an act of great merit&#146;&#151;as Bede adds, perhaps revealing a later scepticism  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 4.23). Oftfor's name, which means &#145;the much travelled&#146;, was no doubt a nickname alluding to these journeys. On his return to England he went to the kingdom of the Hwicce, which was then ruled by Osric (<i>fl</i>. 674&#150;679), and spent a long period preaching there. As Bosel, the first bishop of the Hwicce (whose see was at Worcester), became incapacitated by ill health, Oftfor was consecrated in his place by St Wilfrid, bishop of the Middle Angles from 691 or 692 until 702 or 703, at the command of &AElig;thelred, king of the Mercians, soon after the death of Archbishop Theodore in 690. Oftfor was not the first of Hild's pupils to be appointed to the see, for another one, Tatfrith, had been appointed before Bosel but died before his consecration. This was perhaps about 675, when the Bath foundation charter refers to Osric's establishment of the see (in pursuit of the Synod of Hertford, 672 or 673) yet notably lacks the attestation of a bishop of Worcester. Tatfrith's replacement may have been delayed and Bosel may not have become bishop until 679, the traditional date for the foundation of the see. Perhaps Oftfor had originally come to Osric's kingdom at Theodore's instigation and as a substitute for his confr&egrave;re Tatfrith; but, if so, there is no clue as to why he was initially passed over in favour of Bosel.<br>
<br>Charters show that Oftfor was involved in the rapid growth of monasticism in his diocese. For example, in 693 or later he witnessed a grant of land to an Abbess Cuthswith to establish a monastery at &#145;Peni[n]tanham&#146; (probably Inkberrow); and according to another charter &AElig;thelred of the Mercians granted Fladbury to Oftfor to re-establish monastic life there, &#145;for the forgiveness of my sins and those of my late wife Osthryth (<i>d</i>. 697)&#146;  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 76). Possibly Fladbury (perhaps &#145;Fl&aelig;de's monastery&#146;) takes its name from Osthryth's sister &AElig;lffl&aelig;d (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.714), who received her education from Hild at Whitby, and could perhaps have moved south with her sister, before returning to Whitby in the 680s. The statement of John Bale (<i>d</i>. 1563) that Oftfor wrote homilies (cited in <span class="italic">DNB</span>) is probably merely an inference from Bede's account of Oftfor as a scholar and preacher. He has left no known literary remains, but he is possibly the link that explains why certain details about Gregory the Great in the Whitby life of that saint recur in the writings of Bishop Werferth of Worcester and of John of Worcester. Moreover, it may well have been Oftfor who brought the fifth-century Italian manuscript of Jerome  (W&uuml;rzburg, Universit&auml;tsbibliothek, MS M.p.th.q.2), which bears the <i>ex libris</i> of the above mentioned Abbess Cuthswith, from Rome to Worcester. Oftfor's 692 obit in John of Worcester's chronicle is not to be preferred to the evidence of the Fladbury charter cited above  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 76) that Oftfor was still alive in 697. Evesham sources, admittedly unreliable, suggest that his successor Ecgwine was already in place in 699; hence the &#145;<i>c</i>.699&#146; obit above.<br>
