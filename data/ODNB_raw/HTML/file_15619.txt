<span class="headword">Kingsley,  Henry</span>  (1830&#150;1876), <span class="occ">novelist and essayist</span>, was born on 2 January 1830 at Barnack, Northamptonshire, near Stamford, the youngest of the eight children of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59874/', "Revd Charles Kingsley (1781&#150;1860)")</script> and his wife, Mary Lucas (1785&#150;1873), daughter of Nathan Lucas of Rushford Lodge, Norfolk, and Farley Hall, Barbados. He was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15617/', "Charles Kingsley (1819&#150;1875)")</script>, the Anglican clergyman and novelist, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15618/', "George Henry Kingsley (1826&#150;1892)")</script>, a physician and scholar, and the uncle of Mary St Leger Harrison (1852&#150;1931), who wrote novels under the name of Lucas Malet, and Mary Henrietta Kingsley (1862&#150;1900), the African explorer and writer.<br>
<br>Reared in Clovelly, Devon, which later would become the setting for several of his novels, and then in 1836 in Chelsea, Kingsley attended King's College School, London, from 1844, and then King's College in 1847. After a two-year stint at Colebrook, studying under the Revd Thomas Drosier, he matriculated at Worcester College, Oxford, on 6 March 1850. According to contemporaneous accounts, his Oxford years were noted more for his addiction to athletics and exuberant social pleasures than to academic pursuits. He won a wager that he could run a mile, row a mile, and trot a mile within fifteen minutes, and he later won the Diamond Sculls at Henley-on-Thames. As to his other overindulgences, he engaged in wine-drinking breakfasts and suppers, pipe-smoking contests, and numerous rags and riots. Along with Edwin Arnold (1833&#150;1904), the future poet and orientalist, he was co-founder of the Fez Club, a short-lived nonsensical secret society of fifty undergraduate men dedicated to misogamy, misogyny, and &#145;celibate freedom&#146; who donned fezzes and other special accessories and met for breakfast at Dickenson's Hotel and Coffee House in the Turl in Oxford to eat, to smoke oriental tobacco in oriental pipes, and to defend male superiority over &#145;the gentler sex&#146;.<br>
<br>Without sitting for a degree and with the benefit of a timely legacy, Kingsley left Oxford in 1853 to seek his fortune in the Australian goldfields. For slightly more than four years (December 1853 to February 1858) and without any communication with his parents, he drifted and struggled in Australia with little financial success, labouring in the goldfields, being employed as an agricultural worker and stock driver, and wandering as a &#145;sundowner&#146;, arriving at outstations at sunset, seeking food and lodging. He made no fortune, but he would later use his experiences and his first-hand information about Australia in several of his novels and some of his essays. A series of nine watercolours that he painted of Australian landscapes that interested him is on record at the Mitchell Library, State Library of New South Wales, Sydney.<br>
<br>Just as abruptly as he had left England, Kingsley returned to it. In May 1858 he arrived in England and went first to London to his parents' former home at St Luke's in Chelsea. It is said that he was afraid that they might have died during his long absence, and so he paced up and down outside the rectory for over an hour, dreading the news that he might hear. Finally, taking heart, he knocked on the door and was relieved to learn that his parents were living at Eversley, Hampshire. He settled with them and finished a novel begun in Australia, the critically and commercially successful <span class="italic">Recollections of Geoffry Hamlyn</span> (1859), a romance set mainly in early nineteenth-century Australia. The nineteenth-century critic Desmond Byrne, writing an appreciative account of Kingsley from an Australian point of view, remarked that he<blockquote>was the first to describe in fiction the rural life of the country, to recognize the beginning of an aristocracy of landholders, and to commemorate the pervading spirit of cheerful confidence to which so much of the rapid development of Australia was due. (Byrne, 107)</blockquote>Kingsley continued his success by publishing his acknowledged masterpiece among his seventeen novels, <span class="italic">Ravenshoe</span> (1862), a work this time set mainly in England. Although the novel pits Roman Catholicism against protestantism, the story centres on Charles Ravenshoe, a young, irresponsible man whose character is reminiscent of Kingsley during his Oxford and Australian days. Charles develops from impetuous boyhood to a sobered manhood, through circumstances that include his involvement in the Crimean War, specifically the charge of the light brigade. Like most of Kingsley's romances, <span class="italic">Ravenshoe</span> depicts the adventures of heroic-tinged gentry with noble spirits who have difficulties adjusting to the changing Victorian age. As Michael Sadleir has stated, &#145;No writer of the mid-Victorian age had so delicate a sympathy for splendour in decay, so sensitive an admiration for the forlorn present of a noble past. He is the prose-laureate of wasted beauty&#146;  (<span class="italic">EdinR</span>, 330). Kingsley's third novel, <span class="italic">Austin Elliot</span> (1863), did not achieve the success of the first two novels.<br>
<br>On 19 July 1864, at St Luke's Church, Chelsea, London, Kingsley married his second cousin, Sarah Maria Kingsley Hazelwood (1842&#150;1922), a governess, and moved to Hillside House, Wargrave, near Henley-on-Thames, where they lived until late 1869. There he published extensively: numerous essays and reviews in such periodicals as <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">North British Review</span>, and the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>; an edition of <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> with a biographical introduction of Daniel Defoe (1868); <span class="italic">Tales of Old Travel</span> (1869), a collection of well-researched essays which retold fourteen different ancient and modern exploration narratives; and five novels, four of which were published in both serialization and volume formats. His major novels during this time include his second Australian one, <span class="italic">The Hillyars and the Burtons: a Story of Two Families</span> (1865), an involved saga about two families, one high-born and rich and the other low-born and poor, combining his memories of Chelsea with the fictionalization of some of his Australian experiences. He also wrote <span class="italic">Leighton Court</span> (1866), a slight but rather charming tale of country life, and one of his own favourite novels, <span class="italic">Mademoiselle Mathilde</span> (1868), a work dealing with the French Revolution which, like Dickens's <span class="italic">A Tale of Two Cities</span> (1859), ends with an impersonation at the guillotine.<br>
<br>During his years at Wargrave, Kingsley unintentionally became involved in the intense Governor Edward Eyre controversy which rocked and bitterly divided Britain's intellectual world. Prior to his becoming governor of Jamaica and being involved in the native rebellion against him, Eyre had been a well-known and respected Australian explorer. Coincidentally, Kingsley had written a very favourable two-part article on Eyre's Australian travels for <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span> (October and November 1865), the first of which had appeared a few weeks before the rebellion. Some of his comments regarding Eyre were reprinted in <span class="italic">The Times</span> and set up a public correspondence between Kingsley and a reader who took exception to some of his remarks. Merely on the periphery of the controversy, Kingsley never publicly defended Governor Eyre; rather, he was exalting Eyre in his role as an Australian explorer.<br>
<br>In the late 1860s Kingsley found himself burdened with debt caused in part by his wife's chronic illness (exacerbated by frequent miscarriages) and in part by poor financial management and extravagance. Suffering from the consequent debilitating pressure of producing one novel after another, on 1 October 1869 he accepted the editorship of the Edinburgh <span class="italic">Daily Review</span>, a daily penny journal that was the organ of the Free Presbyterian church, and with Sarah moved to Goshen Back, Morningside, in Edinburgh. Kingsley's lack of the journalistic acumen necessary to be an effective editor, combined with tension between him and the Free Church party management on ecclesiastical and civil matters, soon proved that he was not suited to the position. The outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War gave him an opportunity to separate himself from his editorial desk, and on 5 August 1870 he left Edinburgh for Luxembourg. A much better war correspondent than editor, he vividly and at times poetically described the destruction and inhumanity of war as he witnessed the battle of Sedan and visited hospitals with the Red Cross Society. His coverage was published in the <span class="italic">Daily Review</span> during September 1870, and he also used his experiences as a basis for his novel <span class="italic">Valentin: a French Boy's Story of Sedan</span> (1872), which was also serialized in <span class="italic">Every Boy's Annual</span> (1873). Towards the end of his eight weeks as a correspondent he was weakened by an attack of bronchitis and returned to Edinburgh. He resigned as editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Review</span> in April 1871.<br>
<br>The Kingsleys left Edinburgh for London and lived first at 24 Bernard Square, near Russell Square, Bloomsbury, and then at 29 Fortress Terrace, in semi-rural Kentish Town. Desperate for money and at odds with his brother Charles and his wife because of constant pleas for financial assistance, Kingsley feverishly produced one poorly received novel after another, such as <span class="italic">The Harveys</span> (1872) and <span class="italic">Oakshott Castle</span> (1873), the latter called by the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> almost the &#145;worst novel ever written&#146;  (26 April 1873, 563). Both the quality of his work and his health deteriorated. In the summer of 1875 the Kingsleys made their final move, to Cuckfield, Sussex, where they lived in an old timbered and gabled cottage called The Attress. Kingsley published the novels <span class="italic">Number Seventeen</span> (1875) and <span class="italic">The Grange Garden</span> (1876), a few short stories, and <span class="italic">Fireside Studies</span> (1876), a collection of seven essays on literary figures such as Addison and Steele, Beaumont and Fletcher, and Ben Jonson, five of which had been published previously in <span class="italic">Temple Bar</span> and the <span class="italic">New Quarterly Magazine</span>. However, he was seriously ill from cancer of the tongue and trachea. He died at The Attress on 24 May 1876 and was buried on the 29th at Cuckfield; his wife survived him. His last work, <span class="italic">The Mystery of the Island</span> (1877), a children's novella, was published posthumously.<br>
<br>In appearance Kingsley was short and had a plain, undistinguished face. In later years he grew a full, bushy beard. John Cordy Jeaffreson, his friend and fellow student at Worcester College, described him as having a<blockquote>weedy frame and curious visage. &hellip; Resembling Charles Kingsley (who was far from well looking) in the straight mouth, and deep line, descending on either side of the face from the unshapely nose to the corner of the graceless lips, which distinguished the clergyman's visage. (Jeaffreson, 1.79)</blockquote>Although overshadowed as a novelist by his brother, Henry Kingsley has always entertained a dedicated coterie. In 1895 Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, for example, wrote:<blockquote>I worshipped his books as a boy; today I find them full of faults&#151;often preposterous, usually ill-constructed, at times unnatural beyond belief. &hellip; And yet each time I read <span class="italic">Ravenshoe</span>&#151;and I must be close upon &#145;double figures&#146;&#151;I like it better. Henry did my green unknowing youth engage, and I find it next to impossible to give him up and quite impossible to choose the venerated Charles as a substitute in my riper age. (Quiller-Couch, 67)</blockquote>Other admirers, such as Clement Shorter, Justin McCarthy, Michael Sadleir, and Angela Thirkell, would agree with the assessment that Kingsley was<blockquote>a gifted and spirited storyteller, whose prose at its best has a quiet force and a felicity that make it worthy to be placed beside that of the finest literary craftsmen. &hellip; [H]e had the ability to create fresh descriptions of manly and noble action and beautiful Australian and English sea and landscape scenes. And, above all, his own enjoyment of life infuses his best romances with a vigor and joviality that still captivate readers. (Scheuerle, 1)</blockquote>
