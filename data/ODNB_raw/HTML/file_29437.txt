<span class="headword">Wilks,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1665&#150;1732), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born about 1665 in Rathfarnham, near Dublin, the second of the three sons of Edward Wilks, pursuivant to the lord lieutenant of Dublin. W. R. Chetwood, in his <span class="italic">General History</span> in 1749, says the family came from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, and that Robert's grandfather and great-uncle both served Charles I during the civil war.<br>
<br>Robert Wilks received a good education, and at the age of eighteen, being a remarkable penman, he became a clerk in the office of secretary Sir Robert Southwell. On the outbreak of the war in Ireland he was compelled to join the army of King William, but, being appointed clerk to the camp, took no part in active conflict. After rejoining his office he became acquainted with Richards, a comedian. He appeared privately in John Dryden's <span class="italic">The Spanish Fryar</span>, as Colonel Pedro, and made his public d&eacute;but under Joseph Ashbury at the Smock Alley Theatre in December 1691 as Othello. As a consequence of the war there was no regular company at Smock Alley, and the performance (which was to commemorate the defeat of the Stuart cause in Ireland, and to which the public were admitted gratis) was conducted by amateurs, principally officers. Wilks's performance was so successful that it made him decide to become an actor. He remained at Smock Alley, now established as a theatre, for two years.<br>
<br>In 1693 Wilks visited London and was engaged by Christopher Rich at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. The only part traced to him there is Lysippus in Beaumont's and Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Maid's Tragedy</span>. In moving to England he took a 50 per cent pay cut; under Ashbury he earned 30<i>s</i>. weekly, whereas under Rich he received only 15<i>s</i>., out of which he had to pay 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. to be taught dancing. It was in London that Wilks met Elizabeth, the youngest daughter of Ferdinando Knapton, town clerk of Southampton and steward of the New Forest in Hampshire; her elder sister Sarah married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20273/', "Henry Norris")</script>. Robert and Elizabeth married in 1693 and had five children&#151;a son and four daughters&#151;all but one of whom, Frances, died in infancy.<br>
<br>Some time in 1698 Wilks, together with his wife and presumably his daughter Frances (<i>bap</i>. 15 Oct 1695), returned to Dublin. There he did very well, playing parts such as Sir Frederick Frolic in <span class="italic">Comical Revenge, or, Love in a Tub</span>, Courtall in <span class="italic">She Would if She Could</span>, and Dorimant in <span class="italic">The Man of Mode</span>, all by George Etherege. When the family left Dublin to return to London in the autumn of 1698, or so the story goes, Wilks had become so popular that he had to make an escape, James Butler, second duke of Ormond, having issued a warrant to prevent him leaving the kingdom.<br>
<br>Wilks's first discovered performance date after returning to London is 28 November 1699 at the Drury Lane Theatre, where he played Sir Harry Wildair in George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Constant Couple</span>. The play was a great success, and Sir Harry was the role with which Wilks remained associated throughout his life; it was a part that, to quote Kitty Clive, gave him his teenage image of &#145;idol of pretty young things&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>). Farquhar, an actor and playwright, had returned from Dublin with Wilks. Apart from having a professional relationship, they were close friends all their lives; after his death Farquhar even entrusted his daughters to Wilks.<br>
<br>By 1702 Wilks, through admirable industry, had recommended himself to the Drury Lane manager Christopher Rich despite the fact that he was at odds with the actor and director of rehearsals, George Powell. The main reason for this was that Powell and Wilks were after the same kind of roles. Powell eventually recognized Wilks's talent and left for Lincoln's Inn Fields. Rich then put Wilks in charge of rehearsals. Wilks was also a singer. On 8 April 1706 he sang in Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span> (as Captain Plume). It is also possible that he sang at his special benefit concert at York Buildings on 17 March 1703.<br>
<br>Following a financial row in which Rich was accused of taking a third of the actors' benefit, a detachment of players from Drury Lane, among whom was Wilks, moved to the new Queen's Theatre at the Haymarket, which had been opened by Owen Swiny on 15 October 1706. Drury Lane, having lost most of its leading players, focused on performing Italian operas.<br>
<br>Wilks remained for two years at the Haymarket, where his parts included the Prince of Wales in <span class="italic">1 Henry IV</span>, Hamlet, Antony in <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span>, Macduff, Lorenzo in <span class="italic">The Spanish Fryar</span>, Dorimant in <span class="italic">The Man of Mode</span>, Jupiter in Dryden's <span class="italic">Amphitryon</span>, Cortez in his <span class="italic">The Indian Empress</span>, and Palamede in his <span class="italic">Marriage &agrave; la mode</span>. Among the characters he originated was Archer in Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span> on 8 March 1707. The theatre then being devoted to opera&#151;acoustics had proved less than ideal at Drury Lane&#151;he reappeared as Hamlet at Drury Lane on 15 January 1708.<br>
<br>In 1709 Wilks, together with Colley Cibber, Thomas Doggett, and Anne Oldfield, joined Swiny in the management of the Haymarket. The house opened on 20 September with Thomas Betterton as Hamlet. In 1710 the companies reunited at Drury Lane. When after the 1710&#150;11 season Swiny moved to the Queen's Theatre, Wilks, Cibber, and Doggett became joint managers of Drury Lane. Under this so-called triumvirate&#151;Mrs Oldfield never became a shareholder, as Doggett objected to having &#145;more than one sex admitted to the management&#146;  (Cibber, 208)&#151;Drury Lane flourished. Highfill mentions how &#145;during the early 1710s the shares of Wilks, Cibber, and Doggett never came to less than &pound;1000 per year each up to the end of the reign of Queen Anne in 1714&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 116). The three actor&#150;managers had very different characters. If Cibber's <span class="italic">Apology</span> is to be believed, Wilks was hard-working but vain, Doggett was stubborn and difficult, and Cibber himself was the sensible moderator. It may well have been the peculiar combination of characters that held the three together. In November 1713 Doggett was replaced by Barton Booth, but the new triumvirate remained strong. Life as an actor&#150;manager was busy and often stressful. All three managers attended rehearsals of two to three hours in the mornings, and they saw every performance in which they did not act. They attended rehearsals of new plays, had to oversee all kinds of purchases, and watched that those employees handling money did not defraud the troupe. Among the many parts Wilks played as an actor&#150;manager were Othello and Henry VI in <span class="italic">Richard III</span>.<br>
<br>When Swiny left Drury Lane in 1711 he was succeeded by William Collier, who in 1714 was replaced by Richard Steele. Although he played little or no part in active management, Steele procured a new licence and eventually patent (19 January 1715), which subsequently became a highly valued property. After Steele's death in 1729 the patent was granted to Cibber, Wilks, and Booth, empowering them to present plays at Drury Lane for a period of twenty-one years from 1 September 1732. Wilks stayed at Drury Lane until close upon his death. In 1713 he was Chaucer in John Gay's <span class="italic">The Wife of Bath</span> and in 1717 Heartly in Cibber's <span class="italic">The Non-Juror</span>. He had also been seen as Ferdinand in <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>.<br>
<br>Wilks's new parts at Drury Lane included Bellamar in Thomas Killigrew's <span class="italic">Chit-Chat</span> on 14 February 1719, Eurythion in Thomas Southerne's <span class="italic">The Spartan Dame</span> on 11 December 1719, Frankly in Cibber's <span class="italic">The Refusal</span> on 14 February 1721, Antony in his <span class="italic">Caesar in Egypt</span> on 9 December 1724, Lord Townly in Cibber and Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Provoked Husband</span> on 10 January 1728, and Merital in Henry Fielding's <span class="italic">Love in Several Masques</span> on 16 February 1728. He also played Mirabell in William Congreve's <span class="italic">The Way of the World</span>, the Prince of Wales in <span class="italic">2 Henry IV</span>, the title part in John Dryden's <span class="italic">Aureng-Zebe</span>, Buckingham in <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span>, and Hastings in <span class="italic">Richard III</span>. His last recorded character was Bellamant in Fielding's <span class="italic">The Modern Husband</span>, on 21 February 1732. Avery, taking 1721&#150;2 as a fairly typical season, notes that Wilks acted at least 140 times in addition to his participation in the management. Considering the heavy acting schedule that he carried season after season it is not surprising to hear reports of his frayed temper as a manager. But Cibber's reports are coloured.<br>
<br>Wilks did not usually act outside Drury Lane, but in 1711 he played Sir Harry Wildair for eighteen successive nights in Dublin. At York Buildings on 28 May 1715 he spoke the epilogue to Steele's &#145;Censorum&#146;. In 1703&#150;4 he performed at court, playing Dolabella in Dryden's <span class="italic">All for Love</span>. Highfill records a single excursion to Bartholomew fair, during which he played Antonio in the droll <span class="italic">Maudlin</span> for William Pinkethman, Joe Miller, and Henry Norris (but this may have been William Wilks the younger, his nephew). He also appeared privately as a professional performer (alongside Betterton, Booth, Elizabeth Barry, Anne Bracegirdle, and Mrs Oldfield) at Richard Norton's house at Southwick, near Portsmouth, in the summer of 1707&#150;8.<br>
<br>Wilks died at his house in Bow Street, Covent Garden, on 27 September 1732, and was buried at midnight (at his own request) on 4 October at St Paul's, Covent Garden. A prologue to his memory was spoken at Drury Lane on 14 October. His wife had died on 21 March 1714, and was buried in St Paul's, where her husband raised a monument to her memory. Robert Wilks had married again, on 26 April 1715. His second wife, Mary Fell, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brown (<i>d</i>. 1740), a widow with four children living, survived him. Throughout his career Wilks was well paid, earning as much as &pound;753 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. for acting and serving as co-manager, and his clear benefit brought him &pound;60. Yet at his death he had squandered most of his wealth, and his widow was left with little more than his share in the patent. She appointed the portrait painter John Ellys her representative.<br>
<br>Wilks enjoyed acting on a daily basis. Booth mentions how the exercise &#145;kept the spirits in motion, and always gave him a good Stomach&#146;. Steele compares Wilks and Cibber, saying how they were &#145;perfect actors in their different kinds. Wilks has a singular talent in representing the graces of nature: Cibber the deformity in the affectation of them&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>). Although Wilks's tragic creations were praised for sorrow, tenderness, and resignation, his greatest triumphs were all in comedy, and particularly in the comedy of Farquhar. His chief characteristics as a comedian were ease, sprightliness, and a distinction of manner, which caused him to be accepted as a model of behaviour in fashionable society. One of his most popular characters from Shakespeare was Prince Hal in <span class="italic">Henry IV</span>, but little is written about it. Davies, in his <span class="italic">Dramatic Miscellanies</span> (1784), called Wilks's Hal in <span class="italic">1 Henry IV</span> &#145;one of the most perfect exhibitions of the theatre&#146;. Yet it is the part of Sir Harry Wildair for which he is most remembered:<blockquote>
<div>Wilks with genteel and unaffected air<br>
</div>
<div>In gay Sir Harry charm'd th'attentive fair.<br>
</div> (Weeks)</blockquote>
<a name="cosubject_29437"></a><span class="headword">William Wilks</span>  (<em>c.</em>1696&#150;1726), <span class="occ">actor</span>, the nephew of Robert Wilks, was the son of William Wilks (<i>fl</i>. 1716&#150;1725), an office keeper at Drury Lane Theatre. He appeared at Drury Lane in 1715 as Sir George Airey in Susannah Centlivre's <span class="italic">The Busybody</span>, though he had trained to become an attorney. His uncle tried to dissuade him from adopting the stage, yet in 1714 sent him to Joseph Ashbury, the manager of the Dublin theatre, whom he urged to show him his faults. According to Chetwood, William Wilks performed for one season at Smock Alley, was engaged at 30<i>s</i>. a week for Drury Lane, and died before he was thirty. Parts he played include Tressel in Cibber's <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, Farewell in John Crowne's <span class="italic">Sir Courtly Nice</span>, and Dapperwit in William Wycherley's <span class="italic">Love in a Wood</span>. Among his original parts between 1719 and 1723 were Sicinius in John Dennis's <span class="italic">Invader of his Country</span>, Fainwell in Centlivre's <span class="italic">The Artifice</span>, and Young Clifford in Theophilus Cibber's alteration of <span class="italic">King Henry VI</span>. The last part to which his name is attached is Sir Harry Beaumont in the premi&egrave;re of Eliza Haywood's <span class="italic">Wife to be Let</span> on 12 August 1723.<br>
