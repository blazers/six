<span class="headword">Somes,  Joseph</span>  (1787&#150;1845), <span class="occ">shipowner</span>, was born in Stepney, London, on 9 December 1787, the younger son (there were also four daughters) of Samuel Somes (1758&#150;1816), victualler, waterman, coal merchant, and shipowner, of east London, and his wife, Sarah Green (1762&#150;1835), the daughter of a coal-meter. Apprenticed to his father as a lighterman, and sent to sea at the age of fifteen, Somes's early experience was in the coal and coastal trades.<br>
<br>At the age of twenty-one he became a captain of his father's ships and remained at sea until 1818, acquiring a worldwide knowledge of shipping and navigation. The death of Somes's father in 1816 left him as partner with his elder brother, Samuel, in what was by then a prosperous family shipping firm. This firm continued to prosper during the more difficult post-war years, and by the time of Samuel's death in 1829 Joseph was operating extensively as owner, charterer (especially for the East India Company), sailmaker, and chandler.<br>
<br>It was under Somes's sole ownership in the 1830s that the firm rose to become the largest in England. Somes seized the opportunity offered by the breakup of the fleet of the East India Company to purchase a number of its best ships, for example, the <i>Lowther Castle</i> and <i>Earl of Balcarres</i>. His ships sailed primarily to the East Indies but entered vigorously into the newly opening trade of Australasia, including whaling, sailing more rarely to Africa and the Americas, and occasionally to the Baltic. By 1842 the Somes shipping empire, that of the largest private shipowner in the world, embraced about forty ships registered at Lloyd's. Somes specialized in chartering ships to the government for the transport of convicts, stores, and troops.<br>
<br>Somes's prominence and wealth led him to develop an interest in the colonies, and he invested in the Western Australian Company, the North American Colonization Society of Ireland, and, above all, the New Zealand Company. Somes joined the latter company when it was refounded in 1838, sold to it its first ship, the <i>Tory</i> (sent to New Zealand in 1839 with a shipload of settlers without government permission), and became governor of the company in 1840. As governor, Somes was the figurehead for an aggressive and ruthless campaign aimed at securing government recognition for the New Zealand Company. This onslaught won financial concessions but not the decisive part in the colonization of New Zealand which the company sought.<br>
<br>Somes entered the House of Commons as Conservative MP for Dartmouth in December 1844. He was obliged to transfer the ownership of his ships to his nephews in order, narrowly, to avoid disqualification as a government contractor. His political aims were unclear, and his closest allies believed that in 1845 he was about to betray the company, which was in a state of virtual collapse at the time of Somes's death.<br>
<br>Somes was well known on the stock exchange and at Lloyd's, and was one of the originators of the new <span class="italic">Lloyd's Register of Shipping</span> in 1834. He was also active within the General Shipowners' Society. Often called to give evidence before government inquiries, he was a stout defender of the part played by the <span class="roman">Navigation Acts</span> and mercantile marine in the prosperity and defence of the nation.<br>
<br>In 1811 Somes married Mary Ann (1788&#150;1835), daughter of Thomas Daplyn of Stepney. They had one surviving daughter. Second, in 1837, Somes married Maria (1816&#150;1911), daughter of Charles Saxton. She was the sister of both the Revd Charles Waring Saxton, an early migrant to New Zealand, and of Somes's solicitor, Edward Saxton. Somes died on 25 June 1845 at his home, New Grove, Mile End Road, London. He was buried in the family vault in St Dunstan's parish church, Stepney, on 2 July.<br>
