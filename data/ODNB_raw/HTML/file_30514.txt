<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Backhouse, Sir  Roger Roland Charles</span>  (1878&#150;1939), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 24 November 1878 at The Rookery, Middleton Tyas, Yorkshire, the fourth son (a twin with his brother Miles) of Sir Jonathan Edmund Backhouse, first baronet (1849&#150;1918), and member of a well-known Quaker banking family, and his wife, Florence (1845&#150;1902), youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56067/', "Sir John Salusbury Salusbury-Trelawny, ninth baronet")</script>, and member of a famous and ancient Cornish family. The sinologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30513/', "Edmund Trelawny Backhouse")</script> and the political activist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51972/', "Harriet Jane Findlay")</script> were among his siblings. At fourteen he entered the training ship <i>Britannia</i> at Dartmouth as a naval cadet. After passing out in 1894, he received his commission, and was appointed a midshipman in the battleship <i>Repulse</i> of the channel squadron. In 1895 he was transferred to a small cruiser in the Pacific squadron, HMS <i>Comus</i>. Backhouse remained in the Pacific until returning to Britain in 1898. After being promoted to the rank of sub-lieutenant in March 1898, he gained the maximum five first-class certificates and was promoted lieutenant in March 1899. There followed a year's service in the Mediterranean on board the battleship <i>Revenge</i>, where he began to make his name as a gunnery expert. He confirmed this early promise by winning the Egerton prize in 1902. After this achievement he was shuttled back and forth between serving on the staff of the gunnery school ship <i>Excellent</i> at Portsmouth and as gunnery officer on a number of battleships at sea, including service on board the new <i>Dreadnought</i>.<br>
<br>A man of great personal charm and integrity, Backhouse cut a rather imposing figure. Standing at 6 feet 4 inches tall, fit and lean, he was appreciated within the service for his drive, energy, and tenacity. In 1907, aged twenty-nine, with his career advancing successfully in the Royal Navy, Backhouse, popularly known to all as RB, married Dora Louisa, the sixth daughter of John Ritchie Findlay, of Aberlour, Banffshire. This was in every way a successful marriage. Dora proved to be a very supportive partner and they had four daughters and two sons. Backhouse was promoted commander at the end of 1909, and in March 1911 began a period of nearly three and a half years at sea as flag commander to three successive Home Fleet commanders-in-chief: Sir F. C. B. Bridgeman, Sir G. A. Callaghan, and Sir John Jellicoe, in their flagships <i>Neptune</i> and <i>Iron Duke</i>. Promoted captain at the outbreak of war on 1 September 1914, Backhouse rejoined Admiral Jellicoe's staff and distinguished himself both as the gunnery expert and in compiling battle orders. The future first sea lord recommended that the quality of his work deserved a &#145;mention in dispatches&#146;.<br>
<br>In November 1915, at the age of thirty-seven, Backhouse took command of the light cruiser <i>Conquest</i> and was attached to the Harwich force under Commodore Sir Reginald Yorke Tyrwhitt. It was a hectic time, and Backhouse and his ship were in the thick of a number of naval skirmishes. On 25 April 1916 he was caught up in the bombardment of the Suffolk port of Lowestoft by a force of German battle cruisers. Backhouse, supported by two other light cruisers and sixteen destroyers, was commanded by Tyrwhitt to intervene and draw off the enemy's fire. <i>Conquest</i> was hit and set on fire by a number of 12 inch shells, killing twenty-three of the crew and wounding sixteen others. Once the shellfire had ceased, Backhouse left the bridge and instantly took personal charge of the clean-up operation that did much to keep the <i>Conquest</i> afloat and enable it to limp back to port. Afterwards he received a commendation from the Board of Admiralty for the speed and effectiveness of his action, which had saved his ship and its company from foundering.<br>
<br>After Admiral Sir David Beatty assumed command of the Grand Fleet in November 1916, Backhouse joined Admiral Sir W. C. Pakenham, the newly appointed commander of the battle-cruiser squadron, as his flag captain and gunnery expert on board the <i>Lion</i>. A bout of ill health brought him ashore in the summer of 1918, but he had recovered sufficiently to take up a desk job at the Admiralty before the war ended on 11 November 1918. After the armistice he remained in Whitehall for several years, and was appointed director of naval ordnance in September 1920. He was sent to sea again in January 1923 in command of the battleship <i>Malaya</i>. After a twenty-month attachment in the Atlantic Fleet, Backhouse was brought home to attend a series of senior officers' courses at Portsmouth, during which he was promoted rear-admiral at the age of forty-six in April 1925. After achieving flag rank, Backhouse was sent to the <i>Iron Duke</i> in May 1926 to exercise command of the 3rd battle squadron of the Atlantic Fleet. A year later he returned home for a well-earned period of rest and recuperation on half pay.<br>
<br>Backhouse was appointed third sea lord and controller of the navy at the Admiralty in November 1928. He remained at his post throughout a crisis-strewn period in which financial and economic problems arose to batter both the Royal Navy and the governments of the day, causing significant &#145;casualties&#146; on all sides. Promoted vice-admiral in October 1929, Backhouse had fought a long, hard battle with the Treasury mandarins over the Admiralty estimates. It was therefore with a profound sense of relief that he left the tortuous in-fighting of Whitehall to hoist his flag in the <i>Revenge</i> and take command in March 1932 of the 1st battle squadron, and become second in command of the Mediterranean Fleet under Admiral Sir Ernle Chatfield and subsequently Admiral Sir W. W. Fisher. Backhouse, who was knighted in 1933, remained in the Mediterranean until May 1934, and was promoted admiral while on station in February 1934, at the age of fifty-five. By this time he had made a name for himself as something of a tireless workaholic and an officer who pushed himself as hard as he drove his staff. Unwilling to accept sloppiness in either thought or deed, he did not suffer fools gladly, and could be quite withering with those who crossed him. Hardened by experience and confident in his own ability, Backhouse lavished immense care on all matters&#151;great and small&#151;that were passed to him for his scrutiny. Unfortunately, this attitude gained him the reputation of a micro-manager who found it almost pathologically difficult to delegate authority to others around him. Although this unflattering description of his working habits was rather exaggerated, it was not a totally erroneous picture of his performance in command, as his next appointment showed.<br>
<br>In August 1935 Backhouse was made the commander-in-chief, Home Fleet, with his flag in the battleship <i>Nelson</i>. He took as his chief of staff the 52-year-old Bertram Home Ramsay, an old friend from their days on the <i>Dreadnought</i> and a highly opinionated character who had made flag rank earlier in the year. Backhouse and Ramsay both liked their own way, and both relished making decisions and controlling events. They did not work well together. Within two months Backhouse was writing to Chatfield that Ramsay's appointment was not working out in the way that he had hoped, and that unless the younger man was prepared to rein in his own impetuous temperament he would have to go. Unwilling to change and accommodate his chief, Ramsay asked to be relieved of his post in December 1935. Supported by the Admiralty, Backhouse survived the Ramsay episode and prospered. He remained at the helm until April 1938, when it was announced that he would succeed Lord Chatfield as first sea lord and chief of naval staff later in the year. Before he took up his post at Admiralty House in August 1938, he was appointed first and principal aide-de-camp to George VI.<br>
<br>Backhouse could not have taken over as first sea lord at a more ominous time for the British government. Europe appeared to be on the verge of war over the <i>Sudetendeutsch</i> problem. Backhouse and the two other chiefs of staff&#151;Air Chief Marshal Sir Cyril Newall and Lieutenant-General Viscount Gort&#151;all thought the United Kingdom militarily so vulnerable as to require a political solution to the Czech problem; otherwise, the country might be drawn into a war with Germany, and possibly with the other members of the anti-Comintern pact (Italy and Japan) as well. Although Backhouse supported the Munich agreement on pragmatic grounds, his political chief, the cantankerous first lord&#151;Alfred Duff Cooper&#151;reacted angrily by denouncing appeasement and resigning from the government in protest. Duff Cooper's exit in early October allowed Chamberlain to appoint his friend the seventh earl of Stanhope as first lord. A more conciliatory fellow than his predecessor, Stanhope had little real knowledge of naval affairs, and came to rely heavily upon Backhouse's expertise in the few months that they worked together.<br>
<br>As first sea lord, Backhouse demonstrated repeatedly that he was not obsessed with detail and bureaucratic minutiae and that he was prepared to overhaul the administrative machinery of the Admiralty and cast aside some of the Royal Navy's inter-war strategic concepts. Overwhelmed by work during the recent Czech crisis, he was convinced that inefficiency prevailed within the Admiralty's administrative structure. By establishing the Binney committee to look into the organization of the naval staff and make recommendations for change, Backhouse was intent on delegating and decentralizing policy making as much as possible. He also sought to reform British strategic doctrine, which he considered had become hazardous because it still required the main fleet to go to Singapore if war broke out with Japan. As news filtering back from central Europe became gloomier, Backhouse became more adamant in his belief that the Mediterranean and the Middle East region were burgeoning theatres of military and economic importance to the United Kingdom, and that they should not be subordinated to the &#145;Singapore strategy&#146;. Driven by the need to break the mould in strategic thinking, Backhouse brought in the innovative Vice-Admiral Drax, lodging him temporarily in the Admiralty, with instructions to devise a set of war plans that might leave the Royal Navy less exposed against the worldwide menace posed by the German, Italian, and Japanese fleets. What emerged from Drax's voluntary confinement in the Admiralty was a strategic plan that tossed aside the essential element of the Singapore strategy in favour of concentrating British naval and air power in the Mediterranean, north Africa, and Middle East at the outset of a future war. The aim would be to defeat the Italians, seen as the weakest among the United Kingdom's potential enemies. Even so, both Drax and Backhouse still envisaged a scaled-down version of a Far Eastern commitment&#151;a &#145;flying squadron&#146; of two capital ships, an aircraft-carrier, a cruiser squadron, and a destroyer flotilla&#151;to deter the Japanese from interfering with or overrunning British possessions in the region. Although he did not live long enough to push these strategic concepts in Whitehall, the plans were consistent with Backhouse's view that the capital ship was still the most potent weapon in a fleet's arsenal. Although somewhat myopic about its vulnerability to aerial bombardment on the high seas, Backhouse was alive to the dangers posed by submarines to all naval craft, and urged his technical staff to design a new type of escort vessel with a strong anti-aircraft armament that would make it suitable for anti-submarine warfare as well as escort and patrol duties.<br>
<br>Hitler's seizure of the rump of Czechoslovakia in mid-March 1939 roughly coincided with the onset of Backhouse's fatal illness. What appeared to be a long and persistent bout of influenza was eventually diagnosed as a brain tumour: a terminal condition which forced him to retire in May and from which he died in London on 15 July 1939, shortly after being promoted admiral of the fleet. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>A man of consummate ability, who was scrupulous and fair and immensely liked by those who knew him well, Backhouse did not remain long enough as first lord to dispel the jaundiced impression&#151;formed by some of his contemporaries at the time and by a host of naval historians subsequently&#151;that he was a weak and indecisive leader who offered his staff little operational guidance. This unflattering assessment of his qualities is both exaggerated and unjust. Backhouse was not half-hearted about anything. An officer who expected no more and no less of his staff than he was prepared to give himself, Backhouse was not given to self-doubt, and was prepared to back his own judgement and not become a mere slave to tradition. Efficiency was his watchword, and this ensured that he could not do everything himself.<br>
