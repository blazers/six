<span class="headword">Coles,  Elisha</span>  (<em>c.</em>1640&#150;1680), <span class="occ">lexicographer and stenographer</span>, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5896/', "John Coles (1623/4&#150;1678)")</script>, schoolmaster of Wolverhampton grammar school, and his wife, Joyce, was probably born about 1640 in Northamptonshire. He was the nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5893/', "Elisha Coles")</script> the Calvinist, and has been often confused with his uncle's son, also <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5894/', "Elisha Coles")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5893/', "Coles, Elisha")</script>]. A schoolmaster like his father, Coles evidently possessed a playful sense of humour: &#145;I was born and bred [for a dozen years] in the very heart of <i>England</i>, I spent almost as many in her very eye, and after that as many more in [or about] the very head of the Kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Compleat English Schoolmaster</span>, 103). (England's &#145;very eye&#146; alludes to Oxford, and her &#145;very head&#146; to London.)<br>
<br>Coles entered Magdalen College, Oxford, towards the end of 1658, matriculated on 26 March 1659, and remained a chorister until 1661 when he left without taking a degree. Shortly afterwards, he set up as a schoolmaster in London (he was at Russell Street, near Covent Garden, by 1674), teaching Latin to English youths, and English to foreigners. Coles considered himself a perennial pupil, for &#145;Learning and Teaching are so nearly Related, that we cannot possibly suppose the one without the other&#146;  (<span class="italic">Syncrisis</span>, 1675, preface). More than a decade passed before he submitted his efforts to the public: then from 1674 to 1677 works on shorthand, language instruction, and lexicography rolled regularly from the London presses.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">The Newest, Plainest and the Shortest Short-Hand</span> (1674), a copy of which was in the library of Samuel Pepys, Coles presented the first historical survey of English shorthand, citing thirty shorthand authors and comparing fourteen alphabets. His own alphabet was apparently based on that of Thomas Shelton's second system  (<span class="italic">Zeiglographia</span>, 1650). Believing monosyllables to be the great stumbling block in English shorthand, Coles advanced the innovative notion of positioning characters on, above, and below a line for great versatility, a method not adopted until 1692 in Abraham Nicholas's <span class="italic">Thoographia</span>. Coles's book was &#145;deservedly well received&#146;  (Kippis, 1.538).<br>
<br>Also published in 1674 was <span class="italic">The Compleat English Schoolmaster</span>, a spelling-book that offers valuable information about seventeenth-century pronunciation and orthographic conventions. In 1675 two Latin textbooks appeared: <span class="italic">Nolens volens, or, You shall make Latin whether you will or no</span>; and <span class="italic">Syncrisis</span>, a precursor of the <span class="roman">Loeb Classical Library</span> series in its juxtaposition of Latin text and facing English translation. The popularity of <span class="italic">Nolens volens</span>, with its &#145;delightfully uncompromising title&#146;  (Mander, <span class="italic">History</span>, 289), quaint illustrations, and amusing frontispiece of a teacher lecturing his youthful charge, may be suggested by the fact that its title was parodied in <span class="italic">Nolens volens, or, You shall learn to play on the violin whether you will or no</span> (1694).<br>
<br>Coles was best-known as a lexicographer. <span class="italic">An English Dictionary Explaining the Difficult Terms</span> (1676; 13 edns to 1732) was the first general dictionary to include both a wide range of dialect (from John Ray, <span class="italic">Collection of English Words not Generally used</span>, 1674), and &#145;canting terms&#146;, or criminal slang or flash talk (from Richard Head's <span class="italic">The Canting Academy</span>, 1673). &#145;'Tis no disparagement to understand the Canting Terms: It may chance to save your throat from being cut, or (at least) your Pocket from being pickt&#146;  (foreword). Coles was granted a licence (27 February 1678) for the exclusive right to print for fourteen years <span class="italic">A Dictionary, English-Latin and Latin-English</span> (1677; 27 edns to 1772), a work still in vogue after the publication of Robert Ainsworth's <span class="italic">Thesaurus linguae Latinae compendiarius</span> (1736).<br>
<br>Coles became second under-master at Merchant Taylors' School on 3 August 1677. In February 1678 he applied unsuccessfully for the mastership of Wolverhampton grammar school, a post left vacant by his father's recent death. It has been stated that he left Merchant Taylors' School &#145;upon some default, not now to be named&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.1275), but on 14 December 1678 Coles wrote from Dublin to resign and to inform the school that he had accepted the mastership of the free school of Galway, Ireland, at the behest of its founder, Erasmus Smith, saying that &#145;I aime at nothing more then [<i>sic</i>] to serve God comfortably &amp; faithfully in my generation&#146;  (Mander, <span class="italic">History</span>, 156n.). His tenure there was brief, for he died at Galway on 20 December 1680 and was buried in the south aisle of the collegiate church of St Nicholas:<blockquote>He was a curious and critical person in the English and Latin tongues, did much good in his calling, and wrote several useful and necessary books for the instruction of beginners, and therefore 'twas pitied by many that he was unhappily taken off from his prosperous proceedings. (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.1275)</blockquote>Coles may have written other works. An E. Coles penned an enthusiastic commendatory poem for William Hopkins's <span class="italic">The Flying Pen-Man</span> (1674). The poem <span class="italic">Christologia</span> (1671; published under different titles, 1679, 1680), with preface signed &#145;Elisha Coles, junior&#146;, has been attributed both to him and to his cousin Elisha. While there might be a wish to assign this pedestrian verse to the cousin, it is arguable that Elisha Coles lexicographer is the author. In addition, a work on penmanship by the &#145;Author of <span class="italic">Nolens volens</span>&#146; was advertised in November 1687 but was evidently never published.<br>
