<span class="headword">Sharp,  William</span>  (1749&#150;1824), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born on 29 January 1749 at Haydon Yard, Minories, London, the address of his father, a gunmaker. Having been apprenticed to Barak Longmate, a bright engraver skilled in heraldry, he later claimed that his first engravings were made upon a publican's pewter pot, but from 1771 he extended his experience as a pupil in the Royal Academy Schools. He commenced his career as a writing engraver in Bartholomew Lane, and gave his first demonstration of greater powers in 1775 with a small quarto engraving, <span class="italic">Hector</span>, of an old lion in the Tower of London. Plates for the <span class="italic">Novelist's Magazine</span> after designs by Stothard revealed his skills to a wider audience, and by 1782 he had moved to Vauxhall, where he worked on more substantial plates. The engraving <span class="italic">Alfred the Great Dividing his Loaf with the Pilgrim</span>, after Benjamin West and published by Boydell in 1782, made his reputation. After inheriting a legacy from a brother who had died at Gibraltar, Sharp moved from Vauxhall to a house in Charles Street, near the Middlesex Hospital, and later, successively, to Titchfield Street, to Acton, and to Chiswick.<br>
<br>Sharp was soon recognized as a very important contributor to the revival of the classical style of line engraving in England, following Sir Robert Strange and William Woollett, and in 1789 he completed the engraving <span class="italic">King Charles II Landing at Dover</span>, after West, a work that Woollett had left unfinished at his death in 1785. In the twentieth century he was still seen as:<blockquote>one of the most accomplished of all the reproductive line-engravers of the eighteenth century &hellip; in his portraits, in particular, he showed a wonderful power of interpreting his originals &hellip; <span class="italic">Richard Hart Davis</span>, <span class="italic">John Hunter</span>, <span class="italic">Porson</span> (1810) and <span class="italic">Dr Raine</span> (1815) exhibit a command of gradations of tone seldom seen outside mezzotint. (Hind, 205)</blockquote>Sharp's contemporaries considered his best engravings to be <span class="italic">The Doctors of the Church</span>, after Guido; <span class="italic">John Hunter</span>, after Reynolds, and <span class="italic">King Lear in the Storm</span>, after West. He was also noted for two large plates of scenes from the siege and relief of Gibraltar (1781): <span class="italic">The Sortie</span>, after Trumbull, published in 1799, and <span class="italic">The Destruction of the Floating Battery</span>, after Copley, published with a keyplate in 1810, and for his involvement with the most prestigious serial publications of the time. He engraved three plates for Macklin's series of <span class="roman">Bible</span> illustrations, including <span class="italic">The Holy Family</span> after Reynolds (1792), for which Macklin had paid Reynolds 500 guineas; three plates for Robert Bowyer's series of illustrations to Hume's <span class="italic">History of England</span>, and three more, including <span class="italic">King Lear in the Storm</span>, for John Boydell's <span class="italic">Shakspeare Gallery</span> (1791&#150;1802).<br>
<br>Despite his fame and reputation Sharp regarded the established structure of artistic patronage with suspicion. Like Strange and Woollett before him, he refused to accept membership of the Royal Academy on the inferior associate basis offered to engravers: this decision is said to have alienated him from the president, Sir Joshua Reynolds. However, he accepted honorary membership of the Imperial Academy of Vienna and of the Royal Academy of Munich. His political sympathies were with those who criticized the established order and with the revolutionary forces in America and France. The theme of liberty was celebrated in two of his earliest historical engravings, <span class="italic">Boadicea Haranguing the Britons</span> and <span class="italic">The Declaration of Rights</span>, both after Thomas Stothard; the second print, engraved in 1782, was dedicated to the Society for Constitutional Information, of which Sharp was a member. He engraved and published fine portraits of Thomas Paine, the author of <span class="italic">The Rights of Man</span>, after Romney in 1793, and of the populist reformer Sir Francis Burdett, after Northcote in 1811. In 1794 he was examined on treasonable charges before the privy council, but his good-natured attempt to use the occasion to solicit subscriptions for his engraving of General Ko&#347;ciuszko, after West, ensured his early acquittal. Contemporaries agreed that Sharp was &#145;by no means qualified to be a conspirator; he was fond of good cheer, grew corpulent from indulging in it, and had the gout&#146;  (Bryan, <span class="italic">Painters</span>, 733).<br>
<br>Sharp's eccentricity was marked in other ways. He had great faith in the study of physiognomy&#151;&#145;Cobbett's profile he likened to that of a bull-dog. &hellip; he often eulogised Mr Vansittart and Lord Sidmouth&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 94/2, 1824, 471)&#151;but this was thought extravagant. His religious convictions were yet more peculiar, even by the common standards of radical heterodoxy. Having been influenced by the notions of Mesmer and Swedenborg, he became a follower of the enthusiast Richard Brothers, whose portrait he engraved in 1795 as <span class="italic">The Man whom God has Appointed</span>. However, on Brothers's confinement as a lunatic later that year, Sharp transferred his allegiance to the fanatic Joanna Southcott, who in 1806 defaced with red paint a thousand copies of his print of Brothers. In 1812 Sharp engraved a portrait of Southcott, towards the cost of whose journey from Exeter and residence in London he had contributed very substantially, and he never lost faith in her pretended divine mission, even after her death in 1814.<br>
<br>Sharp resided on Chiswick Mall, Chiswick, where he died on 25 July 1824, epitomized, justly, as &#145;an extraordinary compound of high professional talent, good moral intentions and egregious credulity&#146;  (ibid.). He was buried on 29 July in the churchyard of St Nicholas, Chiswick, close to William Hogarth, &#145;whom he esteemed the most extraordinary painter who had ever existed&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
