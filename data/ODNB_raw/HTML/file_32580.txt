<span class="headword">Costain, Sir  Richard Rylandes</span>  (1902&#150;1966), <span class="occ">building contractor and industrialist</span>, was born in Crosby, Liverpool, on 20 November 1902, the elder son of William Percy Costain (<i>d</i>. 1929), builder, and his wife, Maud May Smith. W. P. Costain was one of the five sons of Richard Costain (1839&#150;1902), a Manxman who had founded and developed a small but well-equipped and successful building and contracting business in Crosby, into which he took three of his sons.<br>
<br>Costain was sent first to Rydal School at Colwyn Bay, then in 1911 to Merchant Taylors' School at Crosby. By the time he left there in 1920 the family firm, Richard Costain &amp; Sons, had grown to considerable stature on Merseyside. It had built many thousands of houses for sale, artisans' flats for Liverpool corporation, houses and cottages for steelworks and other industries, army camps, munitions factories, churches, theatres, and college extensions. Costain automatically entered the family firm, first learning the trades of the joiner and the bricklayer. He took also a short architectural course in Rome. In 1922 W. P. Costain decided on a move to London, leaving his brothers to continue with the activities in Liverpool, so it was in London that Richard Costain cut his teeth as a builder, notably by working on the firm's large venture on the Kingswood housing estate in Surrey.<br>
<br>By 1927 Costain was joint managing director, and on the death of his father in 1929 R. R. as he was then widely known, became sole managing director. Speculative house building was at that period the firm's main activity, some ten thousand houses being built on eight estates. The London end of the business was floated as a public company in 1933. This marked a policy change; the company set out to be less dependent on house building and many building contracts were won for important public and industrial buildings and for blocks of flats. In 1934 important civil engineering contracts were won for the first time for sewage disposal works, and in 1935 for a variety of works in Persia.<br>
<br>A unique opportunity occurred in 1935 when proposals were made to build a huge block of flats, known as Dolphin Square, on the Embankment, on the site of the former army clothing depot. Costain took a personal decision in a matter of hours to seize the opportunity of purchasing this site and constructing what was not only the biggest block of flats in Europe, but the first to be conceived as a self-contained city community with its own shops and social amenities. He remarked to a colleague: &#145;in two or three years we'll either drive up to this spot in a Rolls-Royce, or we'll be standing here selling matches&#146;.<br>
<br>This decision demonstrated Costain's spontaneity and courage and also the reputation and liking he had earned, for he was able in a few hours to gather the financial backing which this undertaking involved. His ability to size up a project was matched by his quick assessment of men. He was an inspired picker of staff, and a natural leader. He was short but sturdy in stature, with a forthright manner and a ready smile. He was good company, especially on the golf course, where he was an exceptional club golfer who twice reached the second round of the amateur championship; and at the bridge table, where he was brilliant.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in 1939 Costain offered his services to the government and was appointed deputy director of emergency works, later deputy director of works, in the Ministry of Works. After the war, when he was appointed CBE (1946), he returned as chairman to his company, which had become thoroughly experienced and well-equipped for contracting. He saw clearly the national need to earn foreign exchange and set himself the objective of obtaining a half of the company turnover abroad. It was, however, no longer possible to speak of &#145;the company&#146;, for with the launching or absorption of specialist activities, association with other companies in joint ventures, and the formation of subsidiaries and branches in many countries, it became the Costain Group.<br>
<br>Among many domestic contracts in the early post-war years, Costains was responsible for the Festival of Britain buildings and was involved in very large building and civil engineering works in many different countries. Chairman Dick, as he became affectionately known throughout the company, in 1950 replaced the centralized control which had been characteristic of a family business by a system of operating divisions, which led progressively to the structure of something like eighty autonomous companies within the group.<br>
<br>Costain did not keep himself exclusively to company affairs. In 1950 he was elected president of the London Master Builders' Association, and in the same year the government appointed him chairman of Harlow Development Corporation. This was the piece of public work which gave him the greatest satisfaction, and he devoted great efforts to seeing that the town was a well-balanced community. His work there was rewarded in 1954 by a knighthood.<br>
<br>From 1955 to 1957 Costain was president of the export group for the construction industries. Both for this group, and for his own company, he travelled extensively, for he believed in personal knowledge of his customer as well as his staff; he was also concerned with international consortia formed for specialist construction work in many countries. He took a particular interest and pleasure in Southern Rhodesia, where his contract for the construction of the Kariba Dam township frequently took him.<br>
<br>In 1927 Costain married Gertrude, daughter of William John Minto, with whom he had one son and two daughters. He died from coronary thrombosis at his home, Rylandes, The Sands, Farnham, Surrey, on 26 March 1966.<br>
