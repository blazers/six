<span class="headword">Dickson, Sir  Collingwood</span>  (1817&#150;1904), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born at Valenciennes, France, on 20 November 1817, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7612/', "Major-General Sir Alexander Dickson (1777&#150;1840)")</script> and Eulalia (<i>d</i>. 1830), daughter of Don Stefano Brion&egrave;s of Minorca. Educated at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, he was commissioned second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery on 18 December 1835, and promoted first lieutenant on 29 November 1837. In February 1837 he went to Spain with the artillery detachment of the British Legion under Sir George De Lacy Evans. He served with the legion and the Christinist army until after the defeat of the Carlists near Berga in 1840, and was made a knight of Charles III, of San Fernando (first class), and of Isabella the Catholic.<br>
<br>In March 1841 Dickson went to Constantinople to instruct the Turkish artillery, and remained there until June 1845, employed under the British Foreign Office. He was promoted second captain on 1 April 1846, and brevet major on 22 May. He married on 14 January 1847 Harriet, daughter of Thomas Burnaby, vicar of Blakesley, Northamptonshire. They had three sons, two of whom predeceased him. He became first captain on 2 September 1851, and was inspector of gunpowder at Waltham Abbey from 1 July 1852 to 14 February 1854.<br>
<br>Dickson served in the Crimea from June 1854 to July 1855. At the battle of the Alma he was on Lord Raglan's staff; when Raglan rode forward to a knoll on the Russian flank and asked for guns there, Dickson brought up two 9-pounders and helped to serve them. Their fire forced the Russian batteries guarding the post-road to retire. He was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel from that date, 20 June 1854. He commanded the siege-train of the right attack during the siege of Sevastopol up to 21 July 1855. In the first bombardment on 17 October 1854 the siege batteries ran short of powder, and Dickson directed several field-battery wagons to be brought up under a heavy fire and helped unload them; for this action he received the Victoria Cross on 23 June 1855.<br>
<br>At the battle of Inkerman, Dickson, after Colonel Gambier was wounded, brought up the two 18-pounders which dominated the Russian guns. He chose the site for them, and maintained them there, though he was urged by French officers to withdraw. When the Russians retreated, Lord Raglan said to him: &#145;You have covered yourself with glory&#146;  (Kinglake, 5.439). He was wounded on 4 February, but took part in the bombardments of 9 April and 17 June and in the expedition to Kerch. He was mentioned in dispatches, made aide-de-camp to the queen on 29 June 1855, and received the CB, the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and the Mejidiye (second class).<br>
<br>From September 1855 until the end of the war Dickson was employed with the Turkish contingent, first as brigadier-general and latterly with the temporary rank of major-general (15 February 1856). After the war he was assistant adjutant-general for artillery in Ireland for six years from 4 November 1856, and was then at Leith Fort for five years in command of the Royal Artillery. He was promoted regimental lieutenant-colonel on 23 February 1856, and regimental colonel on 5 April 1866. Four months later he became major-general. In 1868&#150;9 he served on the fortifications committee, which investigated the work carried out under the Palmerston loan for defences, and enlivened its proceedings by his anecdotes and humour.<br>
<br>From April 1870 to 1875 Dickson was inspector-general of artillery. The adoption of rifled guns had caused great changes in artillery, and he therefore went through courses at Woolwich arsenal and at Shoeburyness. His inspections were thorough, but everyone felt the charm of his personality. He was made KCB on 20 May 1871, and he became colonel-commandant on 17 November 1875, lieutenant-general on 8 June 1876, and general on 1 October 1877. In May 1877 he went as military attach&eacute; to Constantinople, where his old friend Sir Austen Henry Layard was ambassador. Collingwood remained in Turkey throughout the Russo-Turkish War, until 9 September 1879. He was president of the ordnance committee (1881&#150;5), though he was retired on 20 November 1884. On 24 May 1884 he received the GCB. He was master gunner from 1891 until his death.<br>
<br>Collingwood's wife died in February 1894, and thereafter he lived a retired life at 79 Claverton Street, London. He died there on 28 November 1904 and was buried at Kensal Green. He was a good linguist, fluent in French, Spanish, and Turkish, and a man of &#145;downright commonsense&#146;. He closely and affectionately studied the traditions of his regiment.<br>
