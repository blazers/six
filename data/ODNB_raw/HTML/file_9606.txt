<span class="headword">William of York</span> <span class="st"> [St William of York, William fitz Herbert]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1154), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, was probably born not later than the 1090s.<h2>
<a name="Familybackgroundandearlypromotion"></a>Family background and early promotion</h2>His father, Herbert of Winchester, has traditionally been identified as the illegitimate son of Herbert (II), count of Maine, and his mother as Emma, illegitimate daughter of Stephen, count of Blois, and thus half-sister of King Stephen. However these identifications appear to be late additions to his genealogy. Herbert's parents are unknown, and there is evidence that his wife was not a member of the house of Blois but rather the daughter of Hunger fitz Odin, Domesday tenant of Broad Windsor, Dorset. <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> shows Herbert to have been a Hampshire landowner, of local significance only. Under William II he was chamberlain of the Winchester treasury and after <i>c</i>.1100 combined the office with that of treasurer. It has been traditional to place Herbert's death in 1129 or 1130, when the pipe roll records his son, Herbert, paying a relief for his father's lands. However, there is no definite record of Herbert after 1111, and a convincing case can be made for his identification with &#145;H. the Chamberlain&#146; whom Suger of St Denis named as the would-be assassin of Henry I in 1118, mutilated by Henry in punishment.<br>
<br>Between 1109 and 1112 Archbishop Thomas (II) of York (<i>d</i>. 1114) enfeoffed Herbert the Chamberlain and his son (probably his elder son, Herbert) with Londesborough, Towthorpe, Weaverthorpe, Helperthorpe, Luttons Ambo, and other Yorkshire lands, as well as estates in Gloucestershire, for the service of three knights. The acquisition by the family of lands in Yorkshire may have been made when Archbishop Thomas was in Winchester in 1108. William and his brother Herbert fitz Herbert were associated with the grant of the church of Weaverthorpe to the Augustinian canons of Nostell, made with the consent of Archbishop Thurstan (<i>d</i>. 1140) and confirmed by Henry I in 1121.<br>
<br>It was not many years after the family's acquisition of their Yorkshire estates, by 1114 at the latest, that Herbert the Chamberlain's younger son, William, became treasurer of the cathedral church of York, an office that in the twelfth century was held with the archdeaconry of the East Riding. It was during his tenure of the office that he granted to the canons of York the church of Nether Wallop with the chapel of Grateley, Hampshire, and that of Market Weighton, Yorkshire. As treasurer William attested various <i>acta</i> of Archbishop Thurstan, and was one of those who accompanied the archbishop on his visit to St Mary's Abbey, York, on the October day in 1132 when the secession took place that led ultimately to the foundation of Fountains Abbey.<h2>
<a name="ElectiontoYork"></a>Election to York</h2>Following the resignation and death of Archbishop Thurstan early in 1140 there was a prolonged dispute as to who should succeed him, which deprived the diocese of York of an effective archbishop for seven years. William fitz Herbert was not the first choice of the York electors. After lengthy discussions they agreed first on Waldef, prior of Kirkham (<i>d</i>. 1159), whose appointment was vetoed because of his connections with the Scottish king, and then on a nephew of King Stephen and Bishop Henry of Winchester, Henry de Sully. Henry, however, refused to resign the abbacy of F&eacute;camp, and his election was overruled by the pope. William may have seemed to many to be an obvious candidate for archbishop. He had enjoyed a long association with the church of York; and he was clearly in the king's favour&#151;a charter of Stephen issued between 1136 and 1139 refers to him as a royal chaplain. Although he evidently acquired a reputation for being somewhat indolent&#151;William of Newburgh described him as &#145;a man who was clearly of noble birth, likeable, and with a certain lightness of morals&#146;  (William of Newburgh, <span class="italic">Historia rerum Anglicarum</span>, ed. R. Howlett, Rolls Series, 1884, 1, 55)&#151;William was elected archbishop in January 1141, a year after Thurstan's death, in the presence and under the eye of Stephen's earl of York, William, count of Aumale and earl of York (<i>c</i>.1110&#150;1179). Indeed, it was alleged by John of Hexham that Earl William brought a direct message from the king that William fitz Herbert be elected, a factor that led to the first charge against the latter&#151;that of intrusion. There was clearly much resistance to the election, and William was opposed by the archdeacons of the church of York&#151;prominent among them Thurstan's nephew Osbert de Bayeux and Walter of London&#151;and by the precentor. The earl of York forestalled an early attempt to complain that William's election had been irregular when he seized and imprisoned Archdeacon Walter, and William was received and his election confirmed by King Stephen at Lincoln on 2 February, shortly before the king's imprisonment.<h2>
<a name="Theelectiondispute"></a>The election dispute</h2>Whereas the prospect of Waldef or Henry de Sully as archbishop had apparently provoked no controversy, a powerful group in the York chapter objected to William fitz Herbert's election. Their concern may have been due less to any general unsuitability on his part, than to his long experience at York, which would have made him less easily swayed or influenced by factional interests among his colleagues. As for the senior archdeacons, frustrated personal ambition may also have played a part. Added weight was given to the opposition to William with the entry into the dispute of members of the &#145;new&#146; monastic orders which had recently reached Yorkshire. Seen from a European angle, the Cistercian involvement in the York election dispute can be interpreted both as a response to the decree of the Lateran Council of 1139 that allowed monks and canons&#151;<i>viri religiosi</i>&#151;of a diocese a voice in the election of a bishop or archbishop, and to the encouragement of Bernard of Clairvaux, who had himself intervened in the Langres election (1138). The affair can also be seen in a local context, with the Yorkshire Augustinians and Cistercians mobilized in opposition to William by their patrons, some of whom had family connections with members of the chapter. Several Yorkshire monks and canons, notably the Cistercian abbots of Rievaulx and Fountains and the Augustinian priors of Kirkham and Guisborough, now added their voices in protest against him. With members of the chapter they accused the archbishop-elect of intrusion and unchaste living, and appealed against his election first to the papal legate Henry de Blois, bishop of Winchester (<i>d</i>. 1171), brother of the king, and then to Rome. The opposition's delegates to the curia were Walter of London and Ailred, later abbot of Rievaulx (<i>d</i>. 1167). When all the parties presented themselves in Rome on 7 March 1143 the opposition consisted of a formidable team, including William, precentor of York, William, abbot of Rievaulx, Richard, abbot of Fountains, Waldef, prior of Kirkham, and Cuthbert, prior of Guisborough. To the charges brought against William fitz Herbert they now added that of simony, but it would appear that it was the accusation of intrusion that was given prominence.<br>
<br>Pope Innocent II (<i>r</i>. 1130&#150;43) referred the case to bishops Henry of Winchester and Robert of Hereford as judges-delegate in England. Their instructions were to obtain an oath from the dean of York to the effect that William's election had been canonical and not made under pressure from the king, and if this was forthcoming, to allow the election to stand and William to be consecrated. As to the other charges, if no one came forward to accuse him he was to be allowed to clear himself by oath. When William returned to England he carried with him a second letter from the pope, allowing a witness to be substituted for the dean&#151;a letter that Bernard of Clairvaux and later Pope Eugenius III (<i>r</i>. 1145&#150;53), maintained was a forgery. When Henry of Winchester held court in Winchester in September 1143, the dean of York, who had been consecrated bishop of Durham three months before, was unable to attend, and Archbishop William was allowed to clear himself on all charges by compurgation, his oath being supported by the abbots of St Mary's, York, and Whitby. Bishop Henry then consecrated William archbishop on 26 September at Winchester, two days after the death of Pope Innocent II which signalled the end of Henry's legateship.<h2>
<a name="Thedepositionofthearchbishop"></a>The deposition of the archbishop</h2>William fitz Herbert's movements in the four years after his consecration are difficult to trace, but there is some record of his activities in his diocese. He confirmed the privileges granted by his predecessor to the men of Beverley, and an agreement between Bridlington Priory and Serlo, canon of York, concerning tithes. In a synod held at York he heard a complaint of the monks of Shrewsbury concerning their church of Kirkham, Lancashire. The first of these <i>acta</i> was witnessed by William, count of Aumale, other leading nobles, and a number of canons of York; and the last by Ralph, bishop of Orkney (<i>d</i>. 1144), and by the Benedictine abbots of Whitby and Selby. He played a part in the ecclesiastical politics of the diocese of Durham where he acted as a mediator between William Cumin, who was attempting to make himself bishop of Durham, and William de Ste Barbe (<i>d</i>. 1151), formerly dean of York, who had been elected and consecrated bishop in 1143. Archbishop William enthroned Ste Barbe as bishop of Durham on 18 October 1144.<br>
<br>But the question of the validity of William's election had not been settled, and was further inflamed by the international figure of Bernard of Clairvaux, the most influential Cistercian of his day, who wrote denouncing him as &#145;that idol of York&#146;, and &#145;a man rotten from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 280, 261). Bernard added a new and powerful voice to the opposition when he sent one of his own disciples, Henry Murdac, to Yorkshire where he was elected abbot of Fountains. The dispute was protracted, too, by the deaths, in quick succession, of popes Innocent II (24 September 1143) and Celestine II (8 March 1144). Lucius II withstood the strongly worded letters of Bernard of Clairvaux urging action against William fitz Herbert, and dispatched Cardinal Imar of Tusculum with the pallium for him, but William failed to meet Imar before news of the death of Lucius II (15 February 1145) reached England and the legateship expired. With the election of Eugenius III, a Cistercian monk and prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Bernard of Clairvaux, the reform party received a substantial boost, and William was stirred to visit Rome in person, allegedly selling treasure from the cathedral church to finance his journey. Eugenius, under pressure from Bernard, suspended him until such time as the former dean of York, now bishop of Durham, should swear the oath required by Innocent II. At this stage William seems to have lost heart and retired to Sicily. When news reached Rome that William fitz Herbert's supporters had attacked the Cistercian abbey of Fountains, the pope moved on from suspension to deposition, and William was deprived of his see on 21 March 1147 at the Council of Rheims.<h2>
<a name="Deathandtransfiguration"></a>Death and transfiguration</h2>Following this news William returned to England and lived in quiet retirement at Winchester until 1153. The annalist of Winchester recorded that he lived among the monks, sleeping in the common dormitory and eating with them in the refectory. In that year three deaths removed much of the opposition to him: on 8 July Eugenius III died, followed by Bernard of Clairvaux on 20 August, and Henry Murdac, William's successor as archbishop, on 14 October. William journeyed to Rome, according to William of Newburgh after learning of the death of Bernard of Clairvaux, but as recorded by Roger of Howden after that of Henry Murdac, and was restored to the see of York by Pope Anastasius IV (<i>r</i>. 1153&#150;4). He returned to York by way of Winchester and the Yorkshire Cistercian abbey of Meaux where, in a gesture of reconciliation, he made a grant to Fountains Abbey in restitution for the damage done by his followers some years before, and confirmed the gifts made to Meaux Abbey by Henry Murdac. He arrived in his cathedral city in May 1154. But he did not long enjoy his restoration. He was taken ill on 1 June after celebrating mass in York Minster and died a week later (8 June) amid rumours that he had been given poison in the chalice that he had used at mass. A charge of murder was brought by one of his chaplains, Symphorian, against Archdeacon Osbert de Bayeux. The case went first to the king's court, then to the ecclesiastical authorities, and finally on appeal to Rome. The precise outcome is not documented, but by 1158 Archdeacon Osbert had been defrocked and deposed from office.<br>
<br>William fitz Herbert had the misfortune to become archbishop at a time of change. Had he been elected just a few years before there is every likelihood that as king's candidate he would have been accepted without question. But the presence of a number of powerful and ambitious men in the York chapter, the growing prestige and power of the monastic orders, especially the Cistercians, and the weakness of royal authority, particularly after the capture of the king at the battle of Lincoln in 1141, combined to increase opposition to the archbishop-elect, and to maintain the pressure after his consecration in 1143. William's enemies showed themselves to be persistent and tenacious. However, the citizens of York proved equally determined. Despite the shortcomings alleged by his opponents, William had clearly won a secure place in the affections of the cathedral city, which denied Murdac entry until he had been reconciled to the king.<br>
<br>Although initially William fitz Herbert was not promising material for a saint, the manner of his death increased his chances of canonization. His cult was promoted as York's answer to St Thomas of Canterbury, and he was officially canonized in 1227. His remains were translated in 1284 from the nave of York Minster to a shrine behind the high altar (an event depicted in the stained-glass window of <i>c</i>.1423 in the north choir aisle of York Minster), which became the centre of local veneration. The portable shrine of St William's head became the greatest of the treasures of the medieval minster, and the miracles associated with the archbishop and his triumphal return to York in 1154 were portrayed in the fourteenth- and fifteenth-century stained-glass windows of the nave and transepts.<br>
