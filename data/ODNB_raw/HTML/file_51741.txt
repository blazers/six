<span class="headword">Carslaw,  Horatio Scott</span>  (1870&#150;1954), <span class="occ">mathematician</span>, was born on 12 February 1870 at Helensburgh, Dunbartonshire, Scotland, the fifth son of William Henderson Carslaw, a Free Church minister, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lockhead. After an early education at Glasgow Academy he attended Glasgow University where he studied under Professor William Jack, gaining his MA in 1891. He went on to study mathematics at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and was fourth wrangler in 1894. His first academic appointment was as assistant to Jack at Glasgow in 1896. In 1897 he made study visits to Rome, Palermo, and G&ouml;ttingen. He was made a Cambridge MA in 1898 and subsequently took doctorates at both Glasgow (1899) and Cambridge (1905).<br>
<br>Carslaw's visit to G&ouml;ttingen was the principal influence shaping his future research. During his stay the theoretical physicist Arnold Sommerfield introduced him to continental advances, then poorly known in the English-speaking world, and to modern notions of mathematical exactitude, especially the rigorous attention to detail in the application of mathematics. Carslaw worked intensively to apply advanced complex variable analysis to problems of heat and diffraction. In 1903 he took up an appointment to the chair of pure and applied mathematics at the University of Sydney. Aquiline, keen-eyed, bespectacled, already balding, he was by office the leading mathematician in New South Wales, indeed in Australia as a whole. This context drew his attention to matters of mathematical education. He once described himself as a teacher who enjoyed teaching; others saw him as something of a showman in the lecture room. He was active in both the administrative and the expository aspects of school and undergraduate mathematics, and wrote texts on calculus, trigonometry, and non-Euclidean geometry. His many students included E. M. Wellish (later his deputy) and J. C. Jaeger, his subsequent collaborator.<br>
<br>More than a textbook, and incorporating then recent results, was Carslaw's <span class="italic">Introduction to the theory of Fourier's series and integrals and the mathematical theory of the conduction of heat</span> (1906). Work on Fourier (trigonometric) series and their applications was a lifelong preoccupation, and this text was several times revised and reissued.<br>
<br>Carslaw married a widow, Ethel Maude Cruickshank, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clarke, on 12 February 1907. She died on 3 June of the same year, and he never remarried. Not surprisingly, these events correspond to a hiatus in Carslaw's mathematical output; he published nothing during 1907&#150;8. However his research work in time resumed and he contributed many papers, both innovative and expository, some seventy in all. Honours came to him, including doctorates of science (Adelaide, 1926) and laws (Glasgow, 1928). He was a fellow of the royal societies of Edinburgh and of New South Wales. He retired in 1935.<br>
<br>Carslaw's most enduring mathematical legacy, <span class="italic">Operational Methods in Applied Mathematics</span> (1941; 2nd edn, 1948; co-authored with Jaeger), is a product of his retirement. This book introduced into undergraduate curricula the &#145;Laplace transform&#146;, a front-line research topic which became in record time standard fare, displacing the earlier, unsatisfactory &#145;operational calculus&#146;.<br>
<br>Carslaw continued to work after his retirement, despite failing eyesight. Ever humanely left-leaning, he devoted his later years to another long-standing interest, the pursuit of equitable income tax schemes. He died at his home, Thule, Osborne Road, Burradoo, New South Wales, Australia, on 11 November 1954 and was buried the next day in the Anglican section of Bowral cemetery.<br>
