<span class="headword">Simmons,  William Henry</span>  (1811&#150;1882), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born on 11 June 1811 in St Pancras, London. Of his parents nothing is known. He was a pupil of William Finden (1787&#150;1852), from whom he learned the craft of line engraving in copper, a method of pictorial reproduction widely used until about the fourth decade of the nineteenth century, by which time Simmons and many of his colleagues had turned to working in the much more durable medium of steel. Though beautiful when employed by a skilled craftsman the method was laborious and slow, and in response to the burgeoning demand for reproductions of popular pictures Simmons turned to the speedier technique of mixed mezzotint (in which tones and textures are achieved by a rich combination of etching, mezzotint, and engraved line). It is in this style that most of his mature work is executed. His prolific output includes many engravings after such celebrated paintings as <span class="italic">The Last of the Clan</span> and <span class="italic">Highland Mary</span> by Thomas Faed; <span class="italic">The Marriage of Their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales</span> by William Powell Frith; <span class="italic">Christ Weeping over Jerusalem</span> by Sir Charles Eastlake; and <span class="italic">The Sanctuary</span> by Sir Edwin Landseer.<br>
<br>Examples of Simmons's work were exhibited at the Royal Academy on twenty-one occasions between 1857 and 1882, years during which his skills were in constant demand by such leading print-publishers as Thomas Agnew, Henry Graves, and Ernest Gambart. When Agnew commissioned him to engrave Landseer's <span class="italic">Well-Bred Sitters</span> (eventually published in 1879), Simmons worked directly from the original canvas, which he promised to lock in his bedroom every night during progress on the large plate. It is a reflection of the arduousness of an engraver's life that Simmons undertook to complete the large image (<i>c</i>.22&times;29 in.) in fourteen months for a fee of &pound;500, and of the publisher's typical anxiety for speedy results that he was offered a bonus of &pound;25 for completion in twelve months (undated letter, Agnew's agreements book, Agnew's, London).<br>
<br>Perhaps Simmons's finest work is his engraving after William Holman Hunt's <span class="italic">The Light of the World</span>, the publication of which was announced by Gambart in August 1858 (that is, the intention to publish was notified to the Printsellers' Association, formed in 1847 to prevent the production of proofs beyond an openly declared number). Gambart had been on the lookout for an appropriately skilled interpreter and his eventual choice of Simmons was applauded by the painter John Everett Millais, to whose <span class="italic">Proscribed Royalist</span> (of which a print was declared for publication, also by Gambart, in January 1858) the engraver must have been turning his attention at about the same time. On 17 November 1858 the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> announced the completion of the plate of <span class="italic">The Light of the World</span>, declaring that &#145;considered both as the translation of a picture and simply as a work of the burin, it is one of the most perfect things modern art has produced &hellip; a great triumph&#146;.<br>
<br>Though the sale of prints of <span class="italic">The Light of the World</span> alone established Hunt's international fame and brought Gambart huge financial rewards, there is no evidence that the engraver&#151;one of the most eminent of his profession&#151;was ever compensated by more than a modest living for his years of expert accomplishment. According to the 1881 census Simmons, by then a widower, lived at 247 Hampstead Road, St Pancras, London. The house was shared by his unmarried sister, Maria; his widowed daughter, Ann Hollyer; Ann's son, Christopher; an apprentice engraver named Herbert Wilde; and a housemaid and a cook. Simmons died there on 10 June 1882, leaving unfinished an engraving of Rosa Bonheur's <span class="italic">The Lion at Home</span> (which was later finished by a colleague, T. L. Atkinson). He was buried in Highgate cemetery. Examples of Simmons's prints are in the British Museum.<br>
