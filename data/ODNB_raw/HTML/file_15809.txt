<span class="headword">Krause,  William Henry</span>  (1796&#150;1852), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland clergyman</span>, was born on 6 July 1796 on the island of St Croix, West Indies. At an early age he was brought to England, and educated at a school in Fulham, Middesex, and afterwards at another in Richmond, Surrey. In 1814, having made up his mind to enter the army, he obtained a commission in the 51st light infantry, then in the south of France. In the next year he took part in the battle of Waterloo. At the end of the war he was placed on half pay, and soon afterwards returned to St Croix, where his father still lived.<br>
<br>In 1822, while staying with a fellow officer in Ireland, Krause underwent a religious conversion and resolved to take holy orders. He also met Miss A. E. Ridgeway and they were married on 13 January 1823. She died on 17 September 1824 after their only daughter was born. Krause returned to England and sought ordination from the established church but was unsuccessful. In 1826 he was appointed by the earl of Farnham &#145;moral agent&#146; on his Irish estates, his duty being to look after the schools and to promote the religious and moral welfare of the tenantry. While carrying out these functions he entered himself at Trinity College, Dublin, on 5 April 1826. He graduated BA in 1830 and MA in 1838. On 26 March 1838 he was ordained for the curacy of Cavan by the bishop of Kilmore, and for two years ministered there. He also acted as secretary to the local Hibernian Bible Society. In 1840 he was appointed incumbent of the Bethesda Chapel, Dublin, where he became one of the best-known evangelical clergymen. He died in Dublin on 27 February 1852, probably of a heart attack, having preached twice on the Sunday before his death. Three volumes of his sermons were published posthumously in 1859.<br>
