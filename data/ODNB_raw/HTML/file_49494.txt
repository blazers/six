<span class="headword">Searle,  Frank</span>  (1875&#150;1948), <span class="occ">transport entrepreneur</span>, was born at 43 High Street, Worthing, on 15 July 1875, the son of George Searle, an iron-founder, and his wife, Charlotte (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Knight). Searle was originally trained as a locomotive engineer but, displaying early commercial sense, realized that road transport, which began to be mechanized with money-making possibilities from the later 1890s, offered more rewarding prospects, especially as steam power was an obvious early contender. Searle came to realize, however, that the petrol engine, then being developed in France with earlier German patents, offered a much more favourable power-to-weight ratio. He set about mastering the new technology, and courageously set up on his own as a consulting engineer in the West End of London.<br>
<br>In 1905 Searle went to Paris, and arranged to represent Turgan and Lacoste-Battman, several of whose chassis he was able to sell to the London and District Motor Omnibus Company, one of the stock exchange speculations of the time, which ran the Arrow fleet of vehicles. They kept breaking down, however, and the final part of the order had to be cancelled. Thus Searle was obliged to abandon his consultancy; but such was his reputation as a motor engineer that Arrow engaged him as an employee to keep their other vehicles on the road.<br>
<br>None of these early motor buses was sturdy enough to withstand the constant jolting in London traffic. All the moving parts worked loose, and horse buses were able to withstand the new competition, even though the rivalry was soon so severe that few businesses made any profit. In these circumstances the older established, and better funded, London General Omnibus Company (known as the General), which experimented very cautiously with the new motors, managed to maintain a sounder financial position.<br>
<br>The General appointed Searle superintendent of its Mortlake garage at &pound;350 a year in early 1907. Within three months he was transferred to the chief garage at Cricklewood in place of the manager of the motor department, an electrical engineer and former tramway man, who was unable to cope with the twenty-five different models then being tried out from there. On 18 May 1907 Searle was chosen from a shortlist of five as the General's chief motor engineer at a salary of &pound;450 a year, raised to &pound;500 a year at the beginning of 1908. So fierce had competition become by then that other companies fell into the General's grasp, and Searle found himself in charge of a motley collection of about 600 vehicles, none of which could survive the punishment of operating for long in London traffic. He persuaded the General to allow him to design and build a motor chassis which would survive.<br>
<br>&#145;We cribbed shamelessly&#146;, Searle later recalled as he remembered the way in which they incorporated the best features of all the existing models. The result was known as the X-type, the prototype of which was completed on 12 August 1909, but given a police licence to run in service only just before Christmas. The real winner was a lighter, 3&frac12; ton vehicle. This, the vastly improved B-type, was first produced on 7 October 1910, and quickly licensed for service a mere eleven days later. By the end of October 1911 the General had replaced all its 343 horse buses. The B-type enabled it to regain its unchallenged dominance over all upstart rivals.<br>
<br>There were, however, other manufacturers who had, by then, developed more satisfactory motor buses, and they were anxious to acquire a share, however small, of Britain's main motor bus market. Notable among them was the midlands firm of BSA&#150;Daimler. It launched the Premier Motor Bus Company with this objective and, at the beginning of May 1911, it was rumoured that Searle had been offered a senior management position with Premier. The General reacted strongly. Searle was ordered to appear before the directors. His salary was increased from &pound;1000 to &pound;1250 a year, subject to his undertaking to devote his whole time to the company's service and not to make reports, or do any other service, for any other person or company. He asked for time to consider these new arrangements. When he appeared before the board again, on 4 May 1911, his salary was increased to &pound;2000 provided he immediately signed a new contract. This he refused to do on the spot. He was thereupon curtly dismissed, given three months' salary in lieu of notice, and went to work for Daimler. During the First World War he served in the tank corps and was mentioned in dispatches. He received the DSO in 1918 and CBE the following year.<br>
<br>Searle returned to Daimler after the war in charge of its hire-car division. When BSA bought into Air Transport and Travel in 1920 he became managing director and in 1922 took the same role with Daimler Airways, which flew first to Paris, then to Amsterdam instead, and eventually on to Berlin; an internal route was also developed between London and Manchester. In April 1924, when Daimler and the two other British companies were merged to form the Imperial Air Transport Company (later Imperial Airways) with a tapered, ten year, &pound;1 million government subsidy, Searle became managing director.<br>
<br>Frank Searle was married, and he and his wife, Alice, had at least one son. Searle died at his home, 6 Dunbar Road, Bournemouth, on 4 April 1948, and was cremated in Bournemouth crematorium four days later. His death went almost unnoticed by <span class="italic">The Times</span>, which after reporting the deaths of a former chief inspector of lifeboats, and a prominent figure in South African shipping, added rather as an afterthought: &#145;We also announce with regret the death of Colonel Frank Searle, CBE, DSO&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 6 April 1948).<br>
