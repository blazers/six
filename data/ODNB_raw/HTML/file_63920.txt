<span class="headword">Scott <span class="st"> [Scot]</span> family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1400&#150;<em>c.</em>1525), <span class="occ">gentry</span>, of Scot's Hall, Smeeth, Kent, is first represented in the fifteenth century by Sir Robert Scott, lieutenant of the Tower in 1424, whose daughter and sole heir, Alice, married William Kemp, nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15328/', "John Kemp")</script>, archbishop of York.<br>
<br>Sir Robert's brother <a name="cosubject_63920"></a><span class="headword">William [i] Scott</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1434)<span class="occ"></span> was granted the manor of Combe in Brabourne, Kent, by Peter Combe in 1402. By 1409 he had married his first wife, Joan (<i>d</i>. in or before 1425), daughter of Sir John Orlestone (<i>d</i>. 1397), and sister of Margaret, wife of William Parker, with whom she became coheir to the Orlestone estate by 1419. The terms of William [i]'s settlement of 1425 with the Parkers suggest that he and Joan had children who did not survive: by this settlement William purchased Joan's moiety and the property of Richard, her deceased brother, thereby bringing to the Scotts the manors of Orlestone (with its advowson) and Capel, Kent, and Stonlink, Sussex. His second wife was Isabel (<i>d</i>. 1457?), the youngest daughter of Vincent Finch, or Herbert, of Netherfield, Sussex. William [i] may have fought at Agincourt. He was sheriff of Kent first in 1413; in 1419 he was among those granted the keeping of the temporalities of the see of Rochester, and from the following year he appears on other Kentish commissions; he was escheator for Kent and Middlesex in 1424&#150;5, sheriff of Kent again in 1428 and MP in 1430&#150;31. He was legal counsel to Robert, Lord Poynings. With his kinsman Archbishop Kemp he owned a deer park at Birling. In 1431 he was residing at Combe, with lands at Bircholt, West Hythe, Eastbridge, Worth, Wilmington, Street, Hurst, and Estenhanger, with a total annual rental value well in excess of &pound;23. He is credited with having rebuilt Scot's Hall, and probably also the chapel of the Holy Trinity in Brabourne church, where he directed he should be buried. He died on 5 February 1434. With Isabel he had a son and heir, <a name="cosubject_24883"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Scott</span>  (1423&#150;1485)<span class="occ"></span>, and a younger son, William [ii] Scott (<i>d</i>. 1491), among other children.<br>
<br>The family rose to national prominence through Sir John's unshakeable commitment to the house of York. His career in Lancastrian service demonstrated his potential: he appeared on Kentish commissions from 1450, and together with John Fogge and Robert Horn he spent over &pound;333 in suppressing Cade's uprising; king's esquire by 1456, he was frequently involved in Kentish musters and arrays. He first sat as a Kentish JP in 1458, and the following year he was appointed deputy to the earl of Shrewsbury as chief butler of Sandwich. But the turning point in his career came in June 1460, when, with Fogge and Horn, he gave support to the Yorkist earls that proved crucial to their success in Kent. Rich rewards followed within a year of Edward IV's accession, including annuities totalling &pound;73 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., a knighthood, the offices of tronage and pesage in the port of London, joint chirographer of common pleas, deputy to Lord Wenlock as chief butler of Sandwich, the lieutenancy of Dover under the earl of Warwick, and the plum position of controller of the household. This did not exhaust a grateful king's largess: in 1462 he was among those granted the custody of the lands of the attainted earl of Oxford, and of the bishop of Durham's temporalities; he was also made keeper of Higham, Buckinghamshire. The same year he was granted the reversion in fee simple of the castle and manor of Chilham and the manors of Wilderton and Molash with extensive lands: these were the jointure of Margory, widow of the attainted Thomas, Lord Ros of Helmsley (<i>d</i>. 1464). In 1464 the king granted him an interest in further Ros property at Chilham, Godmersham, and Throwley. He had to wait until 1478 for the remainder to fall in with Lady Ros's death, but in the meantime she had agreed that he could occupy the properties, and he was residing at Chilham Castle by 1476, when he had a grant of a weekly fair, annual market, free warren, and court of piepowder there. In 1463 he was granted in fee two thirds, with reversion of the remaining third, of the manors of Old Swinford (with its advowson) and Snodsbury in Worcestershire, in royal hands by the attainder of the earl of Wiltshire. The same year he was included in the group entrusted with the keeping of all the wardships, marriages, and ecclesiastical temporalities coming into royal hands, the profits to maintain the royal household. The following year he was to be reimbursed from the London tonnage and poundage the &pound;256 3<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. he had expended on ships for the Scottish expedition. His pension as controller was exempted from resumptions in 1463 and 1467, and in the latter year he was given the custody of the Kentish lands of Sir Robert Poynings (<i>d</i>. 1461), the marriage of whose son and heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22683/', "Edward Poynings")</script>, he had purchased in 1466. He later married Edward to his daughter Isabella (<i>d</i>. 1528).<br>
<br>In addition to fulfilling his household duties, Sir John Scott served his king at home and abroad. He was appointed sheriff of Kent in September 1460, and thereafter was a ubiquitous commissioner in the county. He continued as a Kentish JP until his death, apart from the period of the readeption. He also sat on the Buckinghamshire bench between 1479 and 1484. He represented Kent in the parliament of 1467&#150;8, and probably also in 1461&#150;2, 1463&#150;5, and the first parliament of 1483, as well as sitting for Appleby, Westmorland, in 1472&#150;5.<br>
<br>In September 1467 Sir John helped negotiate the marriage between the king's sister Margaret and the duke of Burgundy, and he accompanied Margaret to her wedding the following year. He was at Brussels in November 1467 negotiating a commercial treaty with Burgundy, and from May 1469 to February 1470 he was involved in negotiations with the Hanse in Flanders. In April 1471 he succeeded the earl of Warwick as lieutenant of the Cinque Ports and by March 1472 was marshal of Calais. In 1473 and 1474 he was sent on diplomatic missions to Burgundy, Utrecht, and Bruges.<br>
<br>Sir John was busy in Edward IV's defence in the climactic years from 1468 to 1470, as a frequent commissioner of muster and array in Kent and Buckinghamshire. He almost certainly went into exile during the readeption, and returned to fight at Barnet and play an important part in the suppression of Fauconberg's rebellion in May 1471. His position as controller of the household was not renewed in 1471, perhaps because of his new commitments in Calais, but he continued to enjoy the king's trust: in February 1473 he was appointed as one of the tutors to the prince of Wales. Scott remained loyal to Richard III, at least until the end of 1484. In March 1485 he was bound in &pound;1000 to appear before the king and council to answer concerning the matter of debt, so he too may have become alienated from the regime by then. He continued to draw his pension under Henry VII, until his death on 17 October 1485.<br>
<br>Sir John Scott married Agnes (<i>d</i>. 1486/7), daughter of William de Beaufitz of The Grange, Gillingham, Kent (and probably also citizen and fishmonger of London), with whom he had two daughters and a son and heir, William [iii]. Sir John and Agnes were buried in the north wall of Brabourne church. At his death he held lands in Calais, and the manors of St Cleres, Essex, &#145;la Moote&#146;, Sussex, in addition to his properties in Kent. Here he held the manor and advowson of Orlestone, and the manors of Capel, Hayton, Hall, and Mead. He also held the manor of Bournewood, near Orlestone, and land in Romney Marsh given to him by Sir John Cheyne in 1457 as satisfaction for a debt.<br>
<br>Sir John's younger brother <a name="cosubject_63921"></a><span class="headword">William [ii] Scott</span>  (1428?&#150;1491)<span class="occ"></span>, was the founder of the Essex branch of the family. With his wife, Margery, an Essex heiress, he had his heir, John Scott (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1456), five other sons&#151;William [iv], Edward, John, George, and Hugh&#151;and two daughters&#151;Joan, wife of Hugh Fenne, and Elizabeth. He was MP for Huntingdon in 1450&#150;51, but he maintained links with his native county: he sat for Rochester in 1455&#150;6, and was on Kentish commissions in the 1450s, as well as being commissioned to defend Winchelsea against the earl of Warwick in December 1459. After Edward IV's accession he was employed on royal service in Essex, while in 1462 he was commissioned to administer the Hungerford lands in the west, and in 1482 he joined Sir John Scott in arraying Kentish troops for the defence of Calais. He was an Essex commissioner under Richard III, and in 1489&#150;90 a Kentish JP and commissioner of array.<br>
<br>William [ii] Scott lived at his wife's manor of Stapleford and also at Theydon Mount, both in Essex. In addition, at his death on 3 November 1491 he held the Essex manors of Wolfhampton, Ovesham Hall, Margate Guynge, and Great Fordham, and the manor of Woolstan, granted to him by Henry VII after the attainder of the duke of Norfolk.<br>
<br>Sir John Scott's son and heir, <a name="cosubject_24931"></a><span class="headword">Sir William [iii] Scott</span>  (1459&#150;1524)<span class="occ"></span>, of Brabourne and Iden, Sussex, followed in his father's footsteps in much of his public life. He helped to suppress Buckingham's rebellion, being present at the siege of Bodiam Castle in October&#150;November 1483, and was a commissioner of array for Sussex and Essex in 1484. His loyalty to Richard III was pardoned by Henry VII and by November 1489, when he was knighted with Prince Arthur, he had been appointed a member of the council and controller of the household. Sitting on numerous Kentish commissions of array, oyer and terminer, and gaol delivery, he was also appointed sheriff in 1490, 1501, and 1516, and JP from 1494 to 1506. He represented Kent in the parliament of 1495. Scott was appointed marshal of Calais in 1491 and the following year lieutenant of Dover. In 1501 he attended the reception of Katherine of Aragon, and in 1520 he was at the Field of Cloth of Gold. In May 1522 he was among those who received Charles V at Dover.<br>
<br>In 1495 Sir William [iii] Scott found himself the beneficiary of a settlement that his father had made thirty years earlier with Sir John and Joan Lewknor, whereby Sir John Scott and his heirs were granted a remainder interest in the manor of Brabourne in the event of the Lewknors' dying without surviving issue. The childless Joan was widowed at the battle of Tewkesbury and with her death twenty-four years later Sir William became lord of Brabourne.<br>
<br>William's wife was Sybil (<i>d</i>. 1528), daughter of Sir John Lewknor of Goring, Sussex. He died on 24 August 1524 and was buried in the chancel of Brabourne church. He was succeeded by his heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24885/', "John Scott (d. 1533)")</script>.<br>
