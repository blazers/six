<span class="headword">Temple,  Peter</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1599, <em>d.</em> 1663), <span class="occ">regicide</span>, was baptized at St Botolph, Sibson, Leicestershire, on 14 October 1599, the third son of Edmund Temple (<i>d</i>. 1616) of Temple Hall, Sibson, and his wife, Elizabeth, the daughter of Robert Burgoine of Wroxhall, Warwickshire. As a younger son he was apprenticed as a linen draper, but inherited the Temple Hall estate when his older brothers, Paul and Jonathan, died. He married Phoebe, the daughter of Edmund Gayring of London and they had three sons, all baptized at St Botolph, Sibson: John on 21 March 1625, Edmund on 3 November 1638, and Peter on 10 June 1635.<br>
<br>In 1642 Temple was chosen as a member of the committee for the short-lived east midland association of Leicestershire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Rutland, Northamptonshire, Bedfordshire, and Huntingdon under Thomas, Lord Grey of Groby. He was a captain of a troop of horse and was chosen as a member of the county's militia committee in January 1643. He became sheriff of Leicestershire on 19 January 1644, and in this capacity he acted against the Baptists. In 1645 he was involved in raising funds to supply the Scottish army in Leicester and its vicinity, but he had an undistinguished career as a military man. He was accused of cowardice and of trying to dissuade Lord Grey from fortifying Leicester, and was absent from the city when it was besieged, leaving for London immediately prior to the arrival of the royalist forces (29 May 1645). He also served as governor of Cole Orton in the county. He was elected to parliament as a recruiter MP for Leicester borough on 17 November 1645 following the disablement of the previous member, Thomas Cooke, and, in order to take up the seat, was created a burgess. On election he took the oaths of supremacy and allegiance.<br>
<br>There was a considerable presence from Leicestershire in the organization and membership of the high court of justice to try Charles I. Temple was named as a commissioner of the court, and attended regularly. He was absent from only two of the sessions and signed the king's death warrant on 29 January 1649 [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. He was subsequently chosen to sit on the committee for compounding at Goldsmiths' Hall on 13 June 1649 and a month later was voted &pound;1500 from the sequestrations from Leicestershire in reparation for war expenses. By January 1650 he had received &pound;1200 of this and despite information from the county commissioners that they could not pay the remainder it was ordered to be paid from the Michaelmas rents. In December 1650 the council of state called on him to return to his duties as militia commissioner for Leicestershire. The gifts registered to Temple from the mayor and corporation in 1650 describe him as a colonel.<br>
<br>Little overt evidence is available about Temple's religious profession, though he seems to have suppressed the supporters of adult baptism. In October 1649, as a JP in Leicestershire, he convicted Samuel Oates of the heresy of baptizing adults, contrary to the parliamentary ordinance of 2 May 1648. In February 1650 the mayor and aldermen of the corporation of Leicester requested his advice in coping with the publications and activities of Ranters in the city&#151;Jacob Bauthumley was a Leicestershire shoemaker and Abiezer Coppe's &#145;Fiery Flying Roll&#146; was being distributed. Temple was sent one of the Ranters' publications &#145;of a very dangerous consequence [which] lets open a very wide dore to Atheism and profanes&#146;  (Leics. RO, Hall MSS, xii, no. 642, 18 Feb 1650).<br>
<br>At the recall of the Rump Parliament in 1659 Temple returned to power in London and was given lodgings in Whitehall. At the Restoration he was excluded from pardon by the <span class="roman">Act of Oblivion</span> and subsequently from the <span class="roman">Indemnity Bill</span> of 29 August 1660. He surrendered on 12 June 1660 and was one of the nineteen regicides named by Ludlow whose future would be decided by parliament. He was prepared to admit his part in the execution of Charles I, but denied that this was a confession of &#145;guilt&#146;, a variation on the argument whereby the regicides denied the clause in the indictment which accused them of acting from self-interest and malice. He was convicted and condemned to be hanged, but pleaded the benefit of the king's proclamation. He was imprisoned in the Tower and died there of dropsy on 20 December 1663. His estate of Temple Hall was bestowed on James, duke of York.<br>
