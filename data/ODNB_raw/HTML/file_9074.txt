<span class="headword">Fairfax,  Nathaniel</span>  (1637&#150;1690), <span class="occ">physician and antiquary</span>, was born on 24 July 1637 at the rectory of Rumburgh in Suffolk and baptized in the parish on 30 July, the fourth and youngest son of Benjamin Fayerfaxe (1592&#150;1676), rector of Rumburgh, and his wife, Sarah, daughter of Roger Gallard, rector of Ashwellthorpe, Norfolk, and his wife, Joane. The family were originally from Yorkshire. Nathaniel matriculated at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in 1655, graduating BA in 1658 and proceeding MA three years later in 1661. Ordained deacon that year, he was presented to the perpetual curacy of Willisham, Suffolk, but was ejected a year later on refusing to conform. Turning to medicine, he was licensed to practise at Norwich on 10 June 1665, and in 1670 took an MD at Leiden, where he published his inaugural dissertation, <span class="italic">De lumbricis</span>.<br>
<br>Having moved to Woodbridge in Suffolk, Fairfax established a medical practice where he cared, according to his Latin epitaph, &#145;equally for the needy and [the wealthy]&#146;  (Dallenger, 69). However, this still left time for his many literary, topographical, and heraldic interests. Much in sympathy with the aims of the newly formed Royal Society, although never a fellow, Fairfax corresponded regularly with the secretary, Henry Oldenburg. His contributions to the first volumes of the society's <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> included one giving &#145;instances of peculiarities of nature both in men and brutes&#146;  (vol. 2, 1667, p. 549) and others on the size of hailstones, and bodies dead of unusual diseases. They show that he was on familiar terms with Sir Thomas Browne of Norwich, the physician and author. About 1668 he married Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1640, <i>d</i>. 1680), daughter of Thomas and Elizabeth Blackerby of St Michael's, Cambridge, and widow of Samuel Richardson. They had four sons and four daughters, of whom one son, <a href="#cosubject_9074">Blackerby Fairfax [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and three daughters survived him.<br>
<br>In 1674 Fairfax published <span class="italic">A treatise of the bulk and selvedge of the world. Wherein the greatness, littleness, and lastingness of bodies are freely handled</span>, notable for its unvarnished expression and freedom from words borrowed from other languages. This was in line with the Royal Society's then current concern to describe scientific observations plainly. In his foreword Fairfax refers to the interregnum as the &#145;late dayes of Blame, and years of Topsie-turvy&#146;. In the final part of the book, his <span class="italic">Answer to &#145;Tentamina de Deo&#146;, by S[amuel] P[arker], DD</span>, Fairfax was concerned to refute Henry More's belief in a boundless universe, and Parker's in the coextension of body and soul. He believed in the optimistic faith engendered by contemplation of the natural world, from which there were political as well as religious lessons to be learned.<br>
<br>Having lost his first wife in October 1680, on 3 August 1683 Fairfax married, at St Margaret's Church, Ipswich, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1633, <i>d</i>. 1723), widow of Francis Willard, and daughter of Nathaniel Bacon and Susanna Holloway, his second wife; there were no children of the marriage. During the 1680s Fairfax made antiquarian collections for Suffolk, notable for his own observations added to works copied from earlier topographers. In Peter Le Neve's hands they were cut up and pasted, by parish, into Hengrave MSS 2&#150;19 in Cambridge University Library. As his last task, Fairfax gathered a &#145;Catalogue of Suffolk arms of many authors&#146; in a thick folio volume now in private hands, drawing on the armories of twenty earlier collectors, many of them his friends: Blois, Candler, Leverland, Ryece, Staveley, and Tyllotson. He died at Woodbridge on 12 June 1690, and was buried there two days later on 14 June in the central aisle of the nave of St Mary's Church. There on 21 April 1723 his aged widow finally joined him under a slab which also commemorates and probably covers his first wife, their children, and two sons-in-law.<br>
<br>Nathaniel's son <a name="cosubject_9074"></a><span class="headword">Blackerby Fairfax</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1669, <em>d.</em> in or after 1730), <span class="occ">physician and author</span>, was baptized at St Mary's, Woodbridge, on 16 February 1669. He entered Woodbridge School in 1677 and followed his father to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in 1686, where he graduated BA in 1690 and proceeded MA in 1693. He left Cambridge to study at Leiden, where he was admitted MD on 18 April 1696. He was then appointed a physician in the navy, retiring in 1717. In 1728 he was created MD <i>comitiis regiis</i> at Cambridge. He published works in the fields of history, politics, botany, and medicine including <span class="italic">A Discourse upon the Uniting Scotland with England</span> (1702) and <span class="italic">In laudem botanices oratio: on the praise of botany, a speech to which is added a prefatory discourse for establishing a lecture on botany</span> (1717). He also published <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Just Interest of the Kings of England, in their Free Disposing Power</span> (1703), a tract attributed to Sir Matthew Hale, to which he added &#145;a prefatory discourse in answer to a discourse on grants and resumptions&#146;, and <span class="italic">The letter which Pope Gregory XV wrote to Charles I of England concerning his marriage to the infanta of Spain, and that prince's answer</span>. This work drew forth some <span class="italic">Observations</span> (1729) from William Matthews, perpetual curate of St Margaret's, Ipswich. Fairfax is last heard of in his sister Sarah Hall's will dated 27 January 1730.<br>
