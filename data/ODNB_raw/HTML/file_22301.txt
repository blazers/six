<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pinkerton,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseuds. </em>Robert Heron, H. Bennet]</span>  (1758&#150;1826), <span class="occ">historian and poet</span>, was born on 17 February 1758 in Edinburgh, the son of James Pinkerton (<i>d</i>. 1780), hair dealer, and his wife, Mary Heron (<i>b</i>. 1717), the daughter of an Edinburgh apothecary and widow of Robert Bowie. Soon after Pinkerton's birth the family moved to a house owned by his mother, at Grangegateside. Pinkerton attended a local day school until about 1764. He was then sent to the grammar school at Lanark, where he showed an aptitude for Latin translation. He inherited &#145;a portion of hypocondriacism&#146; from his father  (<span class="italic">Public Characters</span>, 3.21), and preferred quiet walks to rougher pastimes. At the age of twelve he returned home, where he pursued a solitary education, his father opposing his wish to attend university.<br>
<br>In his teens Pinkerton was apprenticed to William Aytoun, writer to the signet in Edinburgh, but he clearly aspired to a literary rather than a legal career. In 1776 he published anonymously &#145;Craigmillar Castle, an Elegy&#146;, dedicated to James Beattie, whose poem &#145;The Minstrel&#146; had first interested him in poetry. At about the same time he wrote two tragedies, one of which he burnt. He also began collecting Scottish ballads, and offered some of these to the London publisher James Dodsley in 1777. After their rejection he sent them to Thomas Percy, beginning a correspondence that lasted sixteen years until it ended in acrimony, as sooner or later did many of Pinkerton's friendships. In 1780 he completed his apprenticeship, and when his father died soon after, leaving him an independence of &pound;300 per annum, he abandoned the legal profession altogether. While visiting London to buy books he formed the intention of settling there. He returned to Edinburgh to put his financial affairs in order, then moved to London in 1781, and took up residence at Knightsbridge. That year Charles Dilly published some of his poems as <span class="italic">Rimes</span>, followed by <span class="italic">Two Dithyrambic Odes</span> and <span class="italic">Tales in Verse</span> (1782), none of which was particularly successful.<br>
<br>In 1781 Pinkerton's collection <span class="italic">Scottish Tragic Ballads</span> was published by John Nichols, and in 1783 it was republished, with a second volume containing new material, as <span class="italic">Select Scotish Ballads</span>. Some of the &#145;ancient&#146; pieces, including a continuation of the poetic fragment &#145;Hardyknute&#146;, were in fact Pinkerton's own work. This forgery earned him notoriety as a literary impostor, and the enmity of Joseph Ritson, the literary critic and historian, who exposed and condemned Pinkerton's deception in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>  (54/2, 1784, 812&#150;14). In 1785, under the pseudonym Robert Heron, Pinkerton published <span class="italic">Letters of Literature</span>, a collection of literary essays including one entitled &#145;On literary forgery&#146;. Here, and in subsequent visits to the subject, Pinkerton argued &#145;Perhaps in fact nothing can be more heroic and generous in literary affairs than a writer's ascribing to antiquity his own production; and thus sacrificing his own fame to give higher satisfaction to the public&#146;  (Heron, 384). The reputation for eccentricity and arrogance that <span class="italic">Letters of Literature</span> earned Pinkerton was due notably to this opinion, and also to the book's deprecation of respected classical and contemporary authors, and its views regarding the shortcomings of English orthography. Pinkerton later regretted the vehemence with which he had expressed himself, and wrote to David Laing, &#145;from a constitutional irritability of nerve, I have in my earlier productions shown much controversial asperity &hellip; were I revising my books, I should dash out all such passages, which I never see without disgust. I can only say they are the products of infirmity, and not of malice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Literary Correspondence</span>, 2.355).<br>
<br>In 1786 Pinkerton published <span class="italic">Ancient Scotish Poems</span>, which contained no further forgeries and confessed to his earlier deception. This collection of previously unpublished Middle Scots poems is now regarded as his most significant contribution to Scottish literary scholarship. In the same year he published <span class="italic">The Treasury of Wit</span>, a collection of aphorisms, under the pseudonym H. Bennet. <span class="italic">Scotish Poems, Reprinted from Scarce Editions</span> came out in three volumes in 1792, and brought a new attack on Pinkerton's honour by Ritson  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1793, 32), who disputed Pinkerton's acquisition of one of the manuscripts.<br>
<br>Pinkerton also pursued other fields of research, including numismatics. In 1784 Dodsley published his <span class="italic">Essay on Medals</span>, a well-respected study that was reprinted in 1789 in an enlarged two-volume format. He followed this with <span class="italic">The Medallic History of England to the Revolution</span> (1790). The <span class="italic">Essay on Medals</span> earned Pinkerton the attention of Horace Walpole, with whom he continued to correspond until Walpole's death, after which he sold his recollections of him to be serialized in the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>, and published as <span class="italic">Walpoliana</span> in 1799. Pinkerton's reports of Walpole's religious infidelity met with public indignation.<br>
<br>Through Walpole, Pinkerton made the acquaintance of the historian Edward Gibbon, who found in him &#145;a mind replete with a variety of knowledge, and inclined to every liberal pursuit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Public Characters</span>, 3.29). Gibbon formed the plan of a series of works on the early English historians, to which he would give his name, and which would be edited by Pinkerton. This plan was never fulfilled. The first historical work Pinkerton did publish was controversial: <span class="italic">A Dissertation on the Origin and Progress of the Scythians or Goths</span> (1787) was predicated upon a belief in the congenital inferiority of the Celtic people, and drew attacks from various contemporary scholars, including Ritson in the &#145;Historical essay on Scotish song&#146;, which prefaced his <span class="italic">Scotish Songs</span> (1794). Pinkerton repaid this and previous favours in kind in his review of <span class="italic">Scotish Songs</span> for the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span>  (5 Jan 1795, 49&#150;58). His other historical works were <span class="italic">An Enquiry into the History of Scotland</span> (1789); <span class="italic">Vitae antiquae sanctorum</span> (1789); an annotated edition of John Barbour's <span class="italic">The Bruce, or, The History of Robert I, King of Scotland</span> (1790); and <span class="italic">The History of Scotland from the Accession of the House of Stuart to that of Mary</span> (1797). In that year he also published <span class="italic">Iconographia Scotica</span>, which was followed in 1799 by <span class="italic">The Scotish Gallery</span>, another book of portraits.<br>
<br>By now Pinkerton had for many years been keen to obtain a position commensurate with his abilities. He made repeated appeals to Horace Walpole, who in 1788 on Pinkerton's behalf unsuccessfully solicited Sir Joseph Banks regarding an opening at the British Museum. A further application to Banks in 1795 was equally fruitless. About this time Pinkerton began working for the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span>, though the exact degree of his involvement is unclear. In 1802 he left for Paris, where he was engaged in promoting the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span> to French booksellers. Early in 1805 bankruptcy caused the magazine to be sold, and the political situation in France encouraged Pinkerton to leave for England. On his return he published <span class="italic">Recollections of Paris</span> (1806), which provided &#145;abundant evidence of the low level of his moral standard&#146;  (Constable, 1.505).<br>
<br>Pinkerton's social standing and advancement were damaged by his unorthodox views on religion and morality. Friends such as Lord Hailes and Sir Walter Scott condemned his refutation of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> in <span class="italic">Ancient Scotish Poems</span>, and strangers wrote indignant retorts. The &#145;irregularities of his conduct&#146;  (<span class="italic">Literary Correspondence</span>, 1.viii) in his private life provided additional material for criticism. Throughout the 1780s he lived at Knightsbridge, then from 1789 at Mansfield Place, Kentish Town, with a woman who went by the name of Ann Pinkerton, and who he led some friends to believe was his wife. They had two daughters, one named Sophia, and in 1791 a son, Frederick. About a year later Pinkerton left this woman and his family &#145;on account of her bad conduct and drunkenness&#146;  (Wood, 195).<br>
<br>It is probable that Pinkerton was then in the process of negotiating his forthcoming marriage to Henrietta Maria Burgess, daughter of a tradesman in Odiham, Hampshire, who may have kept a school in Kentish Town. The marriage took place in her parish on 14 August 1793, and the couple settled at Flask Walk, Hampstead. The following year Pinkerton wrote to Lord Buchan of his current state of contentment, adding &#145;nor has my marriage to a quiet, good wife, with some money, been without its share in contributing to my health and finances&#146;  (<span class="italic">Literary Correspondence</span>, 350&#150;51). Two daughters, one named after her mother, survived, and a third child died in 1797; in his last will, Pinkerton claimed that these daughters were his only issue. By 1802 he and Henrietta had separated reasonably amicably. He was then living in Pimlico, London, and his wife in Odiham with their two daughters, who were to inherit fortunes from their uncles. Pinkerton later stated that his brother-in-law Thomas Burgess, the future bishop of Salisbury, had induced him to marry Henrietta &#145;by splendid promises never performed. So much for christianity&#146;  (Wood, 195). After ten years' separation, a divorce &#145;was begun and completed for what I know at the expence of her brother&#146;. There is no record of such a bill, and it seems unlikely therefore that the divorce was ever legal. Before it could have been completed, and in the knowledge that it had not been, Pinkerton married &#145;another bitch of the modern hot-bed race quite unfit for the society of men of sense or spirit&#146;, but possessed of a rich uncle  (ibid.). The identify of this woman is unknown, though parish records for St Mary Magdalen, Old Fish Street, London, list the marriage of a John Pinkerton to Elizabeth Brown Becket on 30 April 1812. The relationship appears to have been short-lived.<br>
<br>One friend remarked that Pinkerton had &#145;ample worldly shrewdness (in pecuniary matters at least)&#146;  (Gillies, 2.124). His financial situation became increasingly uncomfortable, however, after the breakdown of his first marriage, and in mid-1812 he sold part of his library. Shortly after this he moved back to Edinburgh. During the previous decade he had published <span class="italic">Modern Geography</span> (1802), which was well received and translated into French and Italian, a <span class="italic">New Modern Atlas</span> (1808&#150;9), <span class="italic">A General Collection of &hellip; Voyages and Travels</span> (1808&#150;14), and <span class="italic">Petralogy</span> (1811). On arrival in Edinburgh he directed his energies towards realizing an ambition of his youth, to see one of his plays produced. <span class="italic">The Heiress of Strathern, or, The Rash Marriage</span> received its one and only performance at Edinburgh on 23 March 1813, and was hissed off the stage. After this Pinkerton travelled around Scotland, staying with various acquaintances. Between November 1813 and February 1814 he tried unsuccessfully to obtain a position at the register house in Edinburgh. Between August and October he attempted to resurrect Gibbon's projected history, and finally appealed publicly to the prince regent for support, but this came to nothing. He left Scotland for Paris in early 1815, by which time, according to Gillies, &#145;there were but three individuals in the whole community with whom he remained on speaking terms, namely, Sir Walter Scott, Mr. Thomas Thomson, and my obscure self&#146;  (ibid.). Gillies, who was obviously fond of Pinkie Winkie, remembered his &#145;overweening egoism and numberless eccentricities&#146;  (ibid., 124&#150;5).<br>
<br>Pinkerton spent the rest of his life in Paris, where Francis Douce visited him in 1819 and reported that he was living in &#145;mean lodgings&#146;  (Wood, 200). These may have been the hotel at no. 10, 26 rue de Ponthieu, Champs-Elys&eacute;es, which became his last home. He supplemented his small income by dealing for London booksellers, but in a letter to Scott less than a year before his death he intimated that &#145;I am not only under a great bodily disease but my Mind suffers from pecuniary pressure&#146;  (ibid., 201). For the last seven years of his life he suffered from rheumatic gout, which made reading and writing arduous and must have cost him dearly in every respect. According to Beattie, writing in 1798, the drawing prefixed to <span class="italic">The History of Scotland</span> (1797) was &#145;a striking likeness&#146; of Pinkerton at that time, and he spoke &#145;with a strong Edinburgh accent&#146;  (W. Forbes, <span class="italic">An Account of the Life and Writings of James Beattie</span>, 2 vols., 1806, 2.321). In his latter years Pinkerton was described as &#145;a very little and thin old man, with a very small, sharp yellow face, thickly pitted by the small-pox, and decked with a pair of green spectacles&#146;  (Nichols, 5.673). After a long period of sickness he died in Paris on 10 March 1826.<br>
