<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Giardini <span class="st"> [Degiardino]</span>,  Felice</span>  (1716&#150;1796), <span class="occ">violinist and composer</span>, was born in Turin, Italy, on 12 April 1716, the son of a French musician named Jardin, who introduced him to the violin. After time spent in Milan as a cathedral chorister and student of singing, composition, and harpsichord playing (under Paladini), he returned to Turin and studied the violin with G. B. Somis, a pupil of the great Italian violinist Arcangelo Corelli. Giardini quickly advanced through the ranks of various orchestras in Rome and Naples, and in 1748 embarked on a concert tour of Europe as a violin soloist. He arrived in England, via Berlin and Paris, probably in 1750 and possibly at the invitation of Frederick, prince of Wales.<br>
<br>Giardini's presence continued the influence of the Corellian school of violin playing in England, as epitomized formerly by Francesco Geminiani and characterized by tasteful and refined performance rather than virtuosic display. He appeared at first in private circles, enjoying immediate success and easily eclipsing the abilities of native violinists. His first public performance in London (a benefit for Francesca Cuzzoni on 27 April 1751) was a triumph. Involvement from 1762 with the concerts of Harriet Fox-Lane, Lady Bingley, his principal patron, followed, and he gained a number of gentlemen violin pupils and taught singing and harpsichord to ladies in addition to those with higher aspirations. He later taught and enjoyed the patronage of Caroline Russell, duchess of Marlborough, as well as that of William, duke of Gloucester, and Henry, duke of Cumberland, brothers of George III.<br>
<br>Some of Giardini's most innovative instrumental works were published during this period, including the <span class="italic">Sei sonate di cembalo con violino o flauto traverso</span>, op. 3 (1751). With the instruments treated with greater equality, these are the earliest examples of the accompanied sonata in England and are important early examples of the <i>galant</i> style in English chamber music.<br>
<br>Within a few years of his arrival Giardini established a morning <i>accademia</i> at his house, which provided opportunities for his students to perform. It survived until at least 1768. During the early 1750s (probably 1753 or 1754) Giardini married the Italian singer and dancer Maria Caterina Violante Vestris (<i>c</i>.1732&#150;1791), although the marriage appears to have been short-lived.<br>
<br>Giardini published his own music in partnership with John Cox (until 1755) and performed widely as leader and soloist for various subscription series and benefits. After 1754 he concentrated mainly on opera and oratorio, as leader bringing higher standards to the orchestra of the Italian Opera at the King's Opera House in the Haymarket and, unusually, contributing his own operas and arias to various pasticcio productions. His connection with the Italian Opera lasted for forty years. An occasional role as impresario left him with a &pound;602 9<i>s</i>. 11<i>d</i>. overdraft in 1764. He enjoyed greater success with the promotion of subscription series.<br>
<br>Giardini continued his association with high-profile musical events and influential figures during the following decades. He was involved with numerous summer or autumn festivals all round England and took responsibility for the orchestra for the Three Choirs festival (1770&#150;76). In London he led the orchestra at the Pantheon Concerts in Oxford Street (1774&#150;5, 1778&#150;9), and returned to the King's Opera House as leader and music director (1776&#150;7 and 1782&#150;3, and possibly 1772&#150;3). A governor of the Lock Hospital, he was associated over a long period with the numerous oratorio performances given there. <span class="italic">Ruth</span>, an oratorio originally by Giardini and Charles Avison, was performed at the hospital in 1763, and a version scored by Giardini alone appeared in most years from 1768 to 1780, making it one of the most successful oratorios apart from those by Handel. He also ran many of the concerts at the Foundling Hospital (including performances of the <span class="italic">Messiah</span>), where he was a governor (from 1770) and where the ill-fated music academy he had planned with Burney in 1774 was to have been established.<br>
<br>Giardini sold music and sold and repaired instruments from his Italian Musick Warehouse in the Haymarket, near Panton Street, from 1767 until 1769, in partnership with the cellist Emanuel Siprutini. Following the demise of this enterprise, Giardini's works were issued by Peter Welcker.<br>
<br>About this time Giardini's dominance as a violinist was seriously challenged by the German Wilhelm Cramer, who made his London d&eacute;but in 1773. Cramer's success may have been behind Giardini's plans to leave the country, but he stayed, playing alongside Cramer on many occasions and often performing on the viola in public. However, he performed little in public after 1779, and deliberately avoided the Handel commemoration of 1784. By this time Cramer reigned supreme and J. P. Salomon was establishing himself.<br>
<br>Giardini was employed as singing teacher and leader by George, prince of Wales, from about 1782 until his departure for Italy in the summer of 1784. He travelled, via Paris, to Naples and the home of Sir William Hamilton, British envoy to the court of Naples, who had been one of his first violin pupils in London.<br>
<br>On 7 January 1790 Giardini made an unsuccessful return to opera in England, with Cimarosa's <span class="italic">Ninetta</span>, which he directed from the harpsichord with Cramer leading. Giardini was by this stage very much in the German's shadow and his poor physical health impaired his dexterity. He was also snubbed by the prince of Wales following an attempt to cheat him over the sale of a violin.<br>
<br>Giardini's last London appearance took place on 22 May 1792, in <span class="italic">Ruth</span> at Ranelagh Gardens, after which little is known of his travels. He appears to have left for Russia, possibly arriving first in St Petersburg. He certainly gave two concerts in Moscow in 1796, where he died, in poverty, of &#145;a neglected erysipelas of the leg&#146;  (McVeigh, <span class="italic">Violinist</span>, 193) on 8 June the same year.<br>
<br>Giardini was a colourful and often controversial character. He combined charm, wit, and generosity with occasional arrogance, ill temper, and even dishonesty. The anti-German feeling he often displayed was perhaps related to the success of German violinists at his expense, and even extended to Haydn. Thomas Gainsborough was a close friend of Giardini and a competent violinist, and his portrait of the Italian, bought by John Frederick Sackville, third duke of Dorset, in 1778, suggests an imposing stature.<br>
<br>Although a far more significant violinist than composer, Giardini's numerous chamber works, Italian arias, English songs, and glees display a particular gift for melody. Various London publishers were involved after Welcker's death. His tune &#145;Trinity&#146; (now &#145;Moscow&#146;) can still be found in English hymnals, although his frequent association with the Russian &#145;Hymn to the Tsar&#146; is inaccurate.<br>
