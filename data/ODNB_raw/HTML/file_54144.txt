<span class="headword">Buchan <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Macduff]</span>,  Isabel</span>, countess of Buchan  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1270, <em>d.</em> after 1313), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was the daughter of Earl Colban of Fife and Countess Anna, who was perhaps a daughter of Alan Durward (<i>d</i>. 1275) [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50328/', "Macduff family, earls of Fife")</script>]. She was probably born about 1270 and in due time married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6047/', "John Comyn, earl of Buchan (d. 1308)")</script>. She is first recorded in October 1297, when she was said to be managing her husband's estates in England. Buchan, captured after the Scottish defeat at Dunbar in 1296, had recently been set free and had returned to Scotland. Isabel's life then continued unremarkably until 1306, when she achieved fame (or infamy) by placing the coronet on Bruce's head at his enthronement on 25 March. The earls of Fife had long performed this important function, which some said was essential for the validity of the ceremony; the current earl, Isabel's nephew Duncan, was a teenager who adhered completely to Edward I and therefore had no inclination to attend. Although one chronicler asserts that the countess left her husband dishonestly, it seems more likely that he was in England and Isabel, who could have stayed at her own house at Balmullo in Fife before the ceremony, might thus have been able to travel to Scone with comparative ease. None the less, she never saw her husband again: his close relationship to John Comyn of Badenoch, whom the new king had murdered as recently as 10 February, rendered her actions unforgivable. Rumours that she was or wanted to be Bruce's mistress were almost <i>de rigueur</i> in the circumstances.<br>
<br>The countess remained with the new royal family during the following difficult months, staying initially at Kildrummy Castle in Mar and then moving north with the queen and other royal women when that proved unsafe. However, they were captured at St Duthac's shrine at Tain in Ross-shire by William, earl of Ross, in September 1306. Isabel's role at Robert I's enthronement ensured her harsh treatment: she and Mary Bruce were incarcerated in wooden cages within the walls of the castles of Berwick and Roxburgh respectively. Although the women were provided with a privy, the degradation and humiliation of this punishment, which may have been Italian in inspiration, testified to both the seriousness of their offences and the frustration felt by King Edward at this new rebellion. Sir Robert Keith and Sir John Mowbray made an attempt to secure the countess's release in the next few years through the offices of Duncan of Fife, but this came to nothing. Isabel was finally removed from her cage in June 1310 to the comparative luxury of the Carmelite friary in Berwick. Three years later she was handed over to the safe keeping of Sir Henry de Beaumont (<i>d</i>. 1340), husband of Buchan's niece and coheir, Alice, and lived the rest of her life in obscurity. It is not known when she died.<br>
