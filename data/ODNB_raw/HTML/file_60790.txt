<span class="headword">Foord,  Joseph</span>  (1714&#150;1788), <span class="occ">land surveyor and hydraulic engineer</span>, was born on 13 July 1714 at Fadmoor, near Kirkbymoorside in Yorkshire, the third of the four children of Matthew Foord (<i>bap</i>. 1682, <i>d</i>. 1744), Quaker farmer and land agent of the Duncombe Park estate, and his wife, Leah (1678&#150;1752), daughter of William and Jane Pilmoor, Quakers, of Fadmoor.<br>
<br>Foord moved to Skiplam with his parents in 1734, and continued to farm at Skiplam Grange after his father's death in 1744. At twenty-nine Foord's strong Quaker affiliation was disrupted when Kirkbymoorside meeting concluded, after exhaustive inquiry, that he was the father of a child, Joseph, born at Fadmoor late in 1743 (perhaps on 31 October) to Sarah Pilmoor (<i>bap</i>. 1713, <i>d</i>. 1778). The Society of Friends formally denied unity with Foord in March 1744. On 16 January 1746 he married Mary Anderson (<i>bap</i>. 1713, <i>d</i>. 1779) of Kirkbymoorside; of their six children only two attained adulthood. He inherited his father's copyhold farms and water cornmills and a lease in Ankness moorland coalfield. A practical understanding of hydrology, supplemented by an intimate working knowledge of the geology of his native landscape, led him to construct an experimental water race about 1747. It ran 5 miles from moorland springs to Gillamoor and Fadmoor and was extended about 1757 to the market town of Kirkbymoorside. Between 1759 and 1768 open cuts to Carlton, Nawton, Pockley, Old Byland, and Rievaulx townships completed Foord's gravity-fed water system of some 70 miles in length. He was &#145;a self-taught engineer of great ingenuity&#146;  (Marshall, 1.166) whose races, starting in distant moorland valleys, supplied running water to nine villages and &#145;to ponds in all the fields&#146;  (Tuke, 241) of a large tract of dry limestone uplands. They functioned for much of the twentieth century. Their uniqueness as a rural water supply system has ensured their recognition by English Heritage.<br>
<br>As well as being skilled in fixed-level surveying over long distances, Foord became an accomplished land surveyor. He was surveyor and commissioner for seven enclosure awards between 1763 and 1776. Between 1780 and 1785 he carried out a general survey and valuation of the 29,000-acre Duncombe estate. In 1786 Foord hired a London attorney when Charles Slingsby Duncombe refused to pay, in full, his bill for &pound;564. The case never came to court, Duncombe being advised that Foord was an &#145;honest man&#146; and as &#145;eminent&#146; a surveyor as James Brindley  (Duncombe, 2<i>v</i>). No personal documents survive but four court cases initiated by Foord indicate an assertive temperament.<br>
<br>In 1765 he moved to farm at West End in Kirkbymoorside, where his wife died in 1779. Foord seems to have visited America in 1787. A later local source described him visiting &#145;the wilds of America&#146; and dying &#145;when setting his foot upon the English shore&#146;  (Parker). The sea voyages must have taxed the old man's strength. He died on 23 January 1788 at Fawdington, near Thirsk, Yorkshire, in the farmhouse of his Quaker daughter Mary Flower. The record of his burial on 25 January 1788 in the Quaker burial-ground at Thirsk (then sited in an area called Barbeck, on the edge of the town) stated that he was not a member of the society. His goods were valued at under &pound;73, including his surveying instruments at &pound;5; his house was his only immovable property. His telescopic level and brass theodolite are preserved at Ryedale Folk Museum.<br>
<br>Foord's natural son, Joseph Pilmore (also Pilmoor) (1743&#150;1825), baptized on 13 April 1747, was sent to America by John Wesley in 1769 to further the Methodist cause. Ordained in 1785, Pilmore served as an Episcopalian rector in New York (1794&#150;1804) and Philadelphia (1804&#150;21). The man he called &#145;my father&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of Joseph Pilmore</span>, 15) was William Sleightholme of Fadmoor, who married Sarah Pilmoor in 1754.<br>
