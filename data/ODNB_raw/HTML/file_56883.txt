<span class="headword">Goldring,  Douglas</span>  (1887&#150;1960), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in Greenwich, London, on 7 January 1887, the youngest of five children of Frank Goldring, an architect, and Constance Anne Morris, daughter of William Morris, barrister. Goldring described his early home life as unhappy, owing to the incompatibility of his irresponsible father and rigid, humourless mother, whom Goldring described as &#145;devouringly possessive&#146;. When Goldring was three the family moved to Brussels, and then resided in Brighton for a time before settling in Oxford. Goldring attended three schools: one at Hurstpierpoint, Sussex; Magdalen College School, Oxford; and Felsted School, a Church of England school in Dunmow, Essex, where he recalled being a &#145;self-conscious little prig&#146; and was flogged for &#145;insubordination&#146;  (Goldring, <span class="italic">Odd Man Out</span>, 34). He began writing verse and at seventeen had a poem accepted by <span class="italic">The Academy</span>. In 1906 he went up to Oxford University, where he matriculated from Marcon's Hall (one of the private halls). Although &#145;a complete nervous wreck&#146;  (ibid., 60) on leaving school, at Oxford he quickly cultivated a circle of aesthete friends, most notably Somerset Maugham, who introduced him to the poetry of Baudelaire and Verlaine among others.<br>
<br>Financial constraint forced Goldring to leave Oxford after a year, and he joined the editorial staff at <span class="italic">Country Life</span>. In London, Goldring met Ford Madox Hueffer (later Ford), &#145;the principal formative influence of his life&#146;  (Goldring, <span class="italic">South Lodge</span>, xvi), who told the aspiring poet that he would never be &#145;a real poet&#146;  (ibid., 36); nevertheless, before the war Goldring published two volumes of poetry, including <span class="italic">A Country Boy</span> (1910), influenced by A. E. Housman. He also produced a light novel of romance, <span class="italic">The Permanent Uncle</span> (1912), and several well-received travel books. Two of these focused on the French, whom Goldring admired for their genius at the art of living and about whom he wrote throughout his life. In addition, Goldring became involved in various publishing ventures: as sub-editor under Ford of the short-lived but influential <span class="italic">English Review</span>; from 1910 as editor of his own high-calibre magazine, <span class="italic">The Tramp</span>; from 1910 to 1912 as literary editor of the publishing firm Max Goschen; as adviser to Wyndham Lewis's modernist journal <span class="italic">Blast</span>; and in 1915 as founder of Selwyn and Blount publishers.<br>
<br>The First World War temporarily curtailed Goldring's prodigious publishing efforts. He enlisted in August 1914 but in October succumbed to acute rheumatism and was invalided out of the army, to his bitter disappointment; by 1916, when he was again fit, he had become a conscientious objector. In an autobiographical novel, <span class="italic">The Fortune</span> (1917), Goldring expressed his strong pacifist views through a character who becomes a pacifist under the overriding influence of an aristocratic schoolfriend only to be brutally murdered during the Easter rising in Dublin. Despite generous reviews, including one by T. S. Eliot, who deemed it &#145;unquestionably a brilliant novel&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egoist</span>, June 1918), the novel sold only between 300 and 400 copies in England. Not until the expression of anti-war sentiment became acceptable in the late twenties was the ground-breaking nature of this novel fully appreciated. In a 1931 preface to it, Aldous Huxley wrote that &#145;<span class="italic">The Fortune</span> contains what is, I believe, the earliest, indeed the only contemporary, fictional account of war-time pacifism. So far as it goes, this account is excellent&#146;. The war, along with the injustices Goldring witnessed while in Ireland in 1916&#150;18, radically politicized him; thereafter he referred to himself as a &#145;propaganda novelist&#146;  (Goldring, <span class="italic">Odd Man Out</span>, 142). Goldring's anti-war, anti-imperialist, socialist views come most strikingly to the fore in <span class="italic">The Black Curtain</span> (1920) and <span class="italic">Nobody Knows</span> (1923), the latter his most highly praised and widely read novel  (ibid., 255).<br>
<br>On 27 November 1917, in Dublin, Goldring married Beatrice (Betty) Duncan, with whom he had two sons. Her family connections drew him into the literary circles of Yeats, George Moore, and others. Goldring spent the immediate post-war years in London, with frequent trips to the continent. His marriage was dissolved in 1922. In 1925 he obtained a lectureship in G&ouml;teborg, Sweden, where he met Malin Nordstrom, whom he married on 24 April 1927. They moved to the south of France, and in the late twenties and early thirties Goldring penned vivid travel books, notably <span class="italic">The French Riviera</span> (1928), while indulging his wanderlust. While in England in the 1940s he turned his hand to memoirs of historical periods, as in <span class="italic">The Twenties</span> (1945), and of literary figures, notably Violet Hunt and Ford Madox Ford and the <span class="italic">English Review</span> circle in <span class="italic">South Lodge</span> (1943) and <span class="italic">The Last Pre-Raphaelite</span> (1948). Through these later works Goldring has obtained a niche in literary history. However, his highly individual travel books and the politically engaged novels clearly in advance of their time, notably <span class="italic">The Fortune</span>, deserve critical consideration, at the very least as social documents of the &#145;lost generation&#146;. In appearance Goldring was tall and blond. By conviction he was an eclectic Christian-influenced socialist with the integrity and courage to voice unpopular opinions. He lived latterly at Stonar House, Deal, Kent, and died on 9 April 1960.<br>
