<span class="headword">O'Brien,  Conor</span>, lord of Thomond  (<em>d.</em> 1539), <span class="occ">chieftain</span>, was the eldest of eight children of Turlough Donn O'Brien (<i>d</i>. 1528), lord of Thomond, and Raghnailt, daughter of John MacNamara, chief of Clancullen. His father was O'Brien chief of Thomond. Conor acceded to the chieftaincy of one of Ireland's largest and most powerful Gaelic clans upon his father's death. An ambitious and truculent chief, Turlough had extended O'Brien influence east of the Shannon&#151;beyond the traditional boundaries of Thomond&#151;into Limerick and Tipperary, exacting &#145;blackrents&#146; from the former and threatening Butler influence in the latter. O'Brien's bridge, a physical manifestation of Turlough's ambition, was constructed in 1506 to facilitate the movement of troops and supplies over the Shannon. Efforts made by Thomas Butler, seventh earl of Ormond, and Gerald Fitzgerald, eighth earl of Kildare, in 1499 and 1510 respectively, to arrest O'Brien expansion were largely unsuccessful; it was hoped that Conor would prove a more tractable chief whose ambition would be confined to Thomond.<br>
<br>Conor's accession to the O'Brien chieftaincy had been assured for over a decade. He emerged as a client of Gerald Fitzgerald, ninth earl of Kildare, in 1515. In return, he received gifts of horses and by the early 1520s was resident in Kildare's lands at Castlecurry, co. Kildare, where he threatened his Butler neighbours. The nomination of his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20462/', "Murrough O'Brien (d. 1551)")</script> as tanist&#151;following the vacancy left by the death of another brother, Donough, in 1531&#151;obviated any immediate internal rivalry while his marriages strengthened his hand in both Connaught and Munster. He married first Annabella (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1520), youngest daughter of Ulick Burke of Clanricarde and Egelina, daughter of Hugh Courtenay, with whom he had an only son, Donough. He then married Ellice, daughter of Maurice Fitzgerald, ninth earl of Desmond, and Ellen, daughter of Maurice Roche, Viscount Roche of Fermoy, with whom he had five sons, Donald, Turlough, Teig, Murrough, and Mortagh. Conor was in a secure and commanding position.<br>
<br>By 1528 the lordship of Thomond had become polarized between feuding Geraldine and Butler interests. O'Brien's marital ties to Desmond and continued affiliation with Kildare placed him firmly within the former camp. His eldest son, Donough, sensing that his stepbrothers' interests would be pursued ahead of his own, sought allies in unlikely quarters: he married Helen, daughter of Piers Butler, earl of Ossory, in 1533. The O'Briens were divided by the rebellion in 1534 of Thomas Fitzgerald, tenth earl of Kildare; Conor supported him while Donough supported Ossory.<br>
<br>O'Brien brushed aside resistance from Donough and his Butler allies, ravaging Butler lands as the rebellion gathered momentum. In July, O'Brien petitioned Charles V for military assistance claiming that his family was of Spanish descent and that they had &#145;never ceased to oppose the pride of the English&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 7, no. 999). He offered to submit to the emperor's authority and place some 15,000 men at his disposal. Foreign aid, however, was not forthcoming and the arrival of a relief army under Sir William Skeffington, the lord deputy, dashed any hopes of a Geraldine victory. Kildare sought refuge in Thomond, Connaught, and contemplated sailing to Spain to solicit aid from Charles. Recognizing the futility and the potential repercussions of such a gesture, O'Brien counselled against the voyage; Kildare surrendered in August 1535. O'Brien wrote, in English, to Henry VIII in October begging his forgiveness for harbouring the earl and offered to serve the king's representative in Ireland. O'Brien's power and autonomy survived the immediate aftermath of the rebellion intact.<br>
<br>Lord Leonard Grey, the new lord deputy, guided by Donough, Conor's son, marched to the Shannon in August 1536 and destroyed O'Brien's bridge. The expedition, however, was egregiously under-funded and the soldiers refused to cross the Shannon. Grey returned to Dublin having done little to limit O'Brien's power. O'Brien adopted an increasingly defiant posture by refusing to surrender either the young Fitzgerald heir, who received succour in Thomond for six months, or the treasure entrusted to him by Kildare before his surrender. The Irish privy council reported to Sir Thomas Cromwell, principal secretary, that O'Brien &#145;thinketh it not to be his duty to recognise the King's Majesty, neither yet to abide any indifferent or reasonable order upon any wrong by him done to the King and his subjects&#146;  (Brewer and Bullen, no. 88). O'Brien could afford such insouciance so long as his clan remained united behind his leadership and the government refused to expend its limited resources on a major military campaign. Grey made another expedition to the Shannon in June 1538 destroying a rebuilt bridge, but managed only to secure from O'Brien a year-long truce. O'Brien died in December 1539. Murrough, his tanist, was elected chief. Conor was the last independent O'Brien chief before the introduction of the surrender and regrant initiative that saw his successors created earls of Thomond following their submission to the king.<br>
