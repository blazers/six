<span class="headword">Ramsay,  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1624&#150;1696), <span class="occ">bishop of Ross</span>, was born in Irvine, the son of Robert Ramsay (<i>c</i>.1598&#150;1651), principal of Glasgow University, and his wife, Janet Campbell. He entered Glasgow University on 31 March 1645 and was laureated in 1647. About 1648 he married Mary Gartshore, with whom he raised a large family. The resolutioner party in the church ordained him to his first charge at Kirkintilloch on 19 February 1653. During the English occupation his parishioners defied the prohibition against attending his services, which the protester clergy had obtained after having failed to stop his admission. In 1655 he was translated to Linlithgow, where, despite obstructions to his call, the synod declared him legally called and admitted. A respected member of the resolutioner party, he preached in thanksgiving for Charles II's restoration (<span class="italic">Moses Returned from Midian</span>, 1660), and on 29 May 1661 officiated at the anniversary pageant in Linlithgow at which symbols of the solemn league and covenant and the interregnum were burned. In 1664 he was appointed to the charge of Hamilton and <i>ex officio</i> to the deanery of Glasgow. From 1665 to 1667 he was rector of Glasgow University, heading the subscriptions of the oath of allegiance to episcopacy on 6 January 1666. Accompanying the duke of Hamilton with Thomas Dalziel's forces at the skirmish at Pentland on 28 November 1666, he protected him from a rebel's blow.<br>
<br>Ramsay's views on dissenting presbyterians became intolerant as he and many brethren grew aghast at the undermining of the diocese of Glasgow by the indulged ministers and the prevalence of conventicles. In September 1669 in a bold remonstrance to the king, drawn up by Ramsay and Arthur Ross, parson of Glasgow, the diocesan synod lamented the state of the church and criticized government policy for not enacting uniformity of worship and discipline. Summoned before the council, they were both confined to their parishes for a year. The remonstrance was suppressed, but it provided a reason for the dismissal of Alexander Burnet as archbishop of Glasgow. Under his successor, Robert Leighton, Ramsay supported measures for conciliation and accommodation of presbyterian dissenters, but John Paterson, dean of Edinburgh, reported that he was oppressive towards the conforming clergy. He earned sufficient favour to be recommended to the vacant diocese of the Isles in 1672. The chapter completed the formalities of his election on 31 July, but the clergy objected that although otherwise qualified, he could not fulfil his episcopal duties without knowing Gaelic, and requested the king to nominate another man. The objections were heeded, for on 22 July 1673 Ramsay was instead nominated bishop of Dunblane and <i>ex officio</i> dean of the Chapel Royal.<br>
<br>During 1674 a movement for the calling of a national synod arose among Edinburgh and Glasgow clergy, supported by Bishop Laurie of Brechin and by Ramsay. Archbishop Sharp of St Andrews and others opposed it vehemently, fearing its destabilizing influence and suspecting it was intended to lead to demands for the recall of parliament. On 8 July 1674 at a conference of the bishops and some clergy, Ramsay was alone in pressing the case for a synod to settle the church. For disobeying his metropolitan the king ordered Sharp to translate him to the Isles. On 28 July Ramsay petitioned the privy council, which forwarded his petition to the king. Sharp suspended him from his episcopal functions. In April 1675 Ramsay followed the primate to court &#145;where they fall a scolding in their letters&#146;  (Wodrow, 2.304). A commission of Scottish bishops arbitrated in September, and after Ramsay's submission to authority in December he resumed his see of Dunblane in April 1676, holding the charge of Culross <i>in commendam</i>. In 1676&#150;7 his rights to an annuity due to the deanery of the Chapel Royal were disputed in an important case for church revenues.<br>
<br>After the death of Bishop Young of Ross, Ramsay was named his successor on 14 April 1684; he served his diocese diligently for five years, residing also at Culross. Although he accepted the royal prerogative and obeyed the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>, in May 1686 he again stood up for his principles in a sermon to parliament against the act for the toleration of Roman Catholics. In order to overawe other opponents of the toleration, he was summoned before Alexander Burnet, now archbishop of St Andrews, and John Paterson, now bishop of Edinburgh, for defamatory remarks about the earls of Perth and Melfort, and remarks offensive to Lord Moray. Melfort remarked that because of previous kindnesses, Ramsay was &#145;the only one amongst the Bishops I regrate&#146;  (earl of Moray papers, 7/619). The bishop held out for a synodical trial but there being no proof the case was dropped. Ramsay also narrowly escaped the dismissal that befell Bishop Bruce of Dunkeld on 3 June. During 1687&#150;8 Ramsay was keen to assist Robert Boyle's abortive project for the distribution of Gaelic bibles and catechisms in his predominantly Gaelic-speaking diocese. However, because of the difficulties inherent in expounding scripture and doctrine from books in the Irish form of Gaelic, which was not fully understood in Scotland, Ramsay was unable to condemn those who designed to have &#145;the language quite worn out of this country&#146;, along with &#145;the barbarity of the manners of some of our highlanders&#146;  (NL Scot., MS 821, fol. 89<i>r</i>). Nevertheless, Ramsay commissioned a Gaelic translation of a catechism, and ensured there was a school in every parish, even if its language was English.<br>
<br>At the revolution this opponent of the excesses of Stuart church policy displayed the same loyalty to the crown as his brethren; Ramsay was deprived of his see on 22 July 1689, retiring into obscurity in Edinburgh. When on 9 August 1694 he ordained James Greenshields a presbyter, it was conditional on an oath &#145;to the same King for whom the Bishop professed to suffer&#146;  (Christ Church library, Oxford, Wake papers, vol. 19, fol. 189<i>r</i>). On 22 October 1696 Ramsay died at Edinburgh &#145;in very low circumstances&#146;  (Keith and Spottiswoode, 517); he was buried in Canongate churchyard.<br>
