<span class="headword">Gruffydd,  William John</span>  (1881&#150;1954), <span class="occ">Welsh writer and university teacher</span>, was born in Gorffwysfa, Bethel, in the parish of Llanddeiniolen, Caernarvonshire, on 14 February 1881, the eldest child in the family of two sons and two daughters of John Griffith (1852&#150;1929), quarryman, and his wife, Jane Elizabeth Gruffydd (1859&#150;<i>c</i>.1927), daughter of Thomas Gruffydd. He received his early education at Bethel primary school and Caernarfon county school. Caernarvonshire always exerted a strong influence on Gruffydd: &#145;To me it would seem that <i>no</i> Welshman has ever been more conscious than I have of his roots&#146;  (Gruffydd, trans. Lloyd, 58). He rebelled early in his career against the constricting standards of his culture, and while still in his teens began to take a passionate interest in Welsh poetry. From 1899 to 1903 he was an exhibitioner at Jesus College, Oxford, taking a third class in classical honour moderations (1901) and graduating with a second in English (1903). In 1900 he published with R. Silyn Roberts a book of lyrical verse entitled <span class="italic">Telynegion</span>. He taught for a year in Scarborough (an unhappy experience), and for two years at Beaumaris grammar school before being appointed in 1906 to an assistant lectureship in the department of Celtic at what became University College, Cardiff.<br>
<br>In the same year Gruffydd published his second volume of poetry, <span class="italic">Caneuon a cherddi</span>. His early poetry was suffused with an Englishness and a romanticism which was lacking from his later work. On 16 August 1909 he married Gwenda Evans (<i>b</i>. 1883/4), daughter of Thomas Evans, the Calvinistic Methodist minister of Aber-carn; they had one son, and settled in Tongwynlais, Glamorgan (Gwenda later published translations from French literature). In 1910 Gruffydd won the crown poem competition at the national eisteddfod on the subject of the Lord Rhys: in its control of poetic structure in the Welsh language it is judged one of his primary literary achievements.<br>
<br>After 1910 Gruffydd's poetic output was spasmodic due to the demands of scholarship. A subtle and discerning critic and anthologist, he produced an edition of Goronwy Owen's <span class="italic">Cywyddau</span> (1907) and in 1909 <span class="italic">Y flodeugerdd newydd</span> (&#145;The new anthology&#146;), a selection of medieval poetry intended for college use. (A later anthology, <span class="italic">Flodeugerdd Gymraeg</span>, was published in 1931). In 1907&#150;8 Gruffydd published landmark papers in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Guild of Graduates</span> on the connections between Welsh and continental literature in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and in 1912&#150;13 in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion</span>.<br>
<br>In the same period he also wrote a play, <span class="italic">Beddau'r proffwydi</span> (&#145;The graves of the prophets&#146;), first produced by the students' Welsh Drama Society in March 1913. This and another play, <span class="italic">Dyrchafiad arall i Gymro</span> (1914), were significant contributions to a new naturalistic movement in Welsh drama.<br>
<br>From 1915 to 1918 Gruffydd served as an officer in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, predominantly in the Persian Gulf, and by the time he was released he had been appointed professor of Celtic (a title later changed to Welsh) at Cardiff, a post he held until his retirement in 1946. Among his important contributions to scholarship <span class="italic">Llenyddiaeth Cymru, 1460&#150;1600</span> (1922) and <span class="italic">Llenyddiaeth Cymru, 1540&#150;1660</span> (1926), a history of Welsh literature, are significant.<br>
<br>From 1922 until it ceased publication in 1951 Gruffydd edited <span class="italic">Y Llenor</span>, the highly successful Welsh quarterly journal, to which many of the leading Welsh writers of the period frequently contributed. The editorial notes, which commented, often with scorching indignation, on many aspects of life in Wales, including support for the Welsh language, aroused considerable interest and feeling and contributed greatly to the character and impact of the journal. Gruffydd contributed autobiographical pieces as well as poetry.<br>
<br>The collection <span class="italic">Ynys yr hud a chaneuon eraill</span> (1923) is considered to be Gruffydd's first mature work&#151;here he returned to the working community of his childhood in a tauter style and more sombre tone than the effusions of his earlier verse. <span class="italic">Caniadau</span> (1932), a selection which he himself made of his poetry down to 1931, which excludes much of his early poetry, is a useful edition of his later work.<br>
<br>Prose became Gruffydd's main medium of literary expression in his later years, and among his more important works are the autobiographical <span class="italic">Hen atgofion</span> (1936), his biography of Owen Morgan Edwards (1937), both of which are classics of Welsh prose literature, and <span class="italic">Y tro Olaf</span> (1939). From 1950 onwards he made Welsh translations of <span class="italic">Antigone</span> and <span class="italic">King Lear</span> for broadcast.<br>
<br>Gruffydd's major contributions to Welsh scholarship were the numerous studies he published of the intricate structure of the four branches of the <span class="roman">Mabinogi</span> and of aspects of the Arthurian legend, a field in which his interest had been aroused by the work of Sir John Rh&#375;s. Outstanding among those contributions are his <span class="italic">Math vab Mathonwy</span> (1928) and <span class="italic">Rhiannon</span> (1953) which, in spite of some evident shortcomings, particularly a failure on the author's part to make sufficient use of the comparative method, testify to Gruffydd's originality of mind, his general perceptiveness, and his clarity of exposition. The validity of his basic hypothesis has not been seriously challenged.<br>
<br>Gruffydd's lifelong adherence to the principles of tolerance and freedom of thought, as well as his strong aversion to dogma and to any formalized critical doctrine, stemmed partly from his nonconformist upbringing and beliefs. Temperamental, moody, and irascible, he appeared to many of his critics to be culpably inconsistent in the attitudes he took to some of the contentious issues of his day. His shifting standpoints, however, were invariably based on genuine conviction. In 1943 he fought a famous by-election for the University of Wales seat when he stood as the official Liberal candidate against Saunders Lewis of Plaid Cymru. He held the seat until it was abolished in 1950. He was elected president of the council of the national eisteddfod (1945), and was awarded the gold medal of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion (1946) and honorary doctorates by the universities of Rennes (1946) and Wales (1947).<br>
<br>During the Second World War and after Gruffydd suffered periods of ill health. He began to find editing <span class="italic">Y Llenor</span> troublesome and he retired from the Welsh chair in 1946. He moved then to Chertsey to concentrate on politics but, beleaguered by further illness, he returned to Caernarvonshire. He died at his home in Bangor Road, Caernarfon, on 29 September 1954, and was buried at Llanddeiniolen graveyard, not far from the yew tree which is the subject of one of his most celebrated poems.<br>
<br>Gruffydd was one of the most important literary figures writing in Welsh between the wars: his poems about working communities contributed to the development of Welsh poetry away from romanticism and lyricism.<br>
