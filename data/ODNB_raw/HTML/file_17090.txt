<span class="headword">Lower,  Mark Antony</span>  (1813&#150;1876), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born on 14 July 1813 at Chiddingly, Sussex, the fourth of seven surviving children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17092/', "Richard Lower (1782&#150;1865)")</script>, schoolmaster, and his wife, Mary Oxley (<i>b</i>. 1780), daughter of William Oxley of Heathfield, Sussex. He was educated by his father. In 1830 he briefly assisted his sister at her school at East Hoathly, before establishing a school for himself at Cade Street, Heathfield, and then a larger one at Alfriston, Sussex, in 1832. There, in conjunction with John Dudeney, he also founded a mechanics' institution. He moved to Lewes about 1835, and conducted his school there initially in an old chapel. On 8 January 1838 he married, at Bromley, Kent, his first wife, Mercy Holman (1813&#150;1867), daughter of William Holman of Bentley in Framfield, Sussex; they had four sons and five daughters. After several moves within Lewes, the school settled at St Anne's House in the High Street about 1853 and was restricted to boarders. He served as one of the headboroughs of Lewes in 1860&#150;61, but held no other significant public office.<br>
<br>As early as 1831 Lower had printed <span class="italic">Sussex</span>, a guidebook, parish by parish, for which he found 250 subscribers. His next publication, <span class="italic">English Surnames</span> (1842), went through four editions and, with <span class="italic">Patronymica Britannica, a Dictionary of the Family Names of the United Kingdom</span> (1860), was the work by which he was most widely known. But the majority of his writing was related to Sussex. He was one of the prime movers in the foundation of the Sussex Archaeological Society in 1846 and conducted much of its routine business in the early years under the supervision of W. H. Blaauw (1793&#150;1870), the first secretary. At an annual salary of &pound;50 he served as the society's editor and corresponding secretary in 1865&#150;70, but his overspending brought him into conflict with the committee. All but one of the first twenty-six volumes of the society's <span class="italic">Collections</span> (1848&#150;75) contain at least one article by him, and some as many as five, as well as short notes. His translation called <span class="italic">The Chronicle of Battel Abbey</span> appeared in 1851. Two encyclopaedic works were <span class="italic">The Worthies of Sussex</span> (1865), giving biographical sketches, and <span class="italic">A Compendious History of Sussex</span> (2 vols., 1870), greatly enlarging his 1831 book. His evangelical, low-church beliefs and radical political opinions were reflected in his historical writings, for instance <span class="italic">The Sussex Martyrs</span> (1851)&#151;which inaugurated a cult that survived well into the next century&#151;and his lectures to the mechanics' institute on the Bayeux tapestry.<br>
<br>Lower was active in the British Archaeological Association from 1844. In 1852 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, for which he acted as local secretary. His honorary MA degree was awarded by a college in Connecticut, USA, about 1846.<br>
<br>The large amount of time which Lower devoted to archaeology and literature interfered with his profession, and the loss of his wife on 31 May 1867, as well as his own failing health, precipitated his giving up the school in that year and moving to nearby Seaford, where he continued to take only a few French boys. A local subscription raised about &pound;400 as a mark of appreciation for his services to the history of Sussex. On 4 May 1870 he married his second wife, Sarah (<i>bap</i>. 1813, <i>d</i>. 1875), daughter of Henry Scrase and his wife, Sarah, and from 1871 he lived in Peckham, London. A trip to Denmark and Sweden in search of health in 1873 brought no benefit. After his wife's death in 1875, he lived with his youngest daughter at 4 Percival Villas, Sydney Road, Enfield, Middlesex, where he died on 22 March 1876. He was buried in St Anne's churchyard, Lewes.<br>
<br>Lower was a large man with, in middle age, a full beard. In a small county town he cut a flamboyant figure, and his enthusiasms may have outrun his judgement.<br>
