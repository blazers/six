<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thornton,  Thomas</span>  (1751/2&#150;1823), <span class="occ">sportsman</span>, was born in London, the only son, with one daughter, of William Thornton (1713&#150;1769) of Thornville, Cattal, Yorkshire, and his second wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1800), daughter of John Myster of Epsom. His father was MP for York (1747&#150;54 and 1758&#150;1761) and in 1745 he financed and commanded the West Riding militia, serving in Scotland and later Hanover. Thomas Thornton was educated at Charterhouse School before entering Glasgow University in 1766; he continued his education there until 1771 when he left aged nineteen. After he inherited his father's estates on his coming of age he pursued his sporting interests, achieving fame with his several packs of hounds, with which he provided free hunting of foxes, stags, and hares for the Yorkshire gentry. From 1772 to 1781 he managed the Falconers' Club near Cambridge, which he had inaugurated as an upper-class society for hawking and falconry. Fishing and competitive shooting also interested him and he was a member of a notorious <i>savoir-vivre</i> club, but he had little interest in gambling on games of chance, preferring to bet upon his own prowess, and that of his hounds and horses. He rode his own horse to win a match at York in 1778, and acted as steward at Boroughbridge races in 1783, but it was his gambling on the rider Alicia Meynell [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58879/', "Thornton, Alicia")</script>] that made him publicly infamous. In 1804 at York races she rode his horse for a bet of &pound;1000 in an unprecedented match. She lost the race and Thornton reneged on the bet, so the dispute went to court but the case was thrown out. Alicia made another match at York in 1805 for more than 2000 guineas, which she won, but Thornton was publicly horsewhipped there by the previous opponent, all of which was reported in the press. The precise nature of Thornton's relationship with Alicia remains unclear. Alicia, though frequently referred to as Mrs Thornton, was thought by the diarist Charles Fothergill to be Thornton's mistress. She eloped with a soldier in 1806, and in July of that year, at Lambeth, Thornton married Eliza Cawston of Mundon, Essex. Their son, William Thomas, was born at Kenyon House, London, the following year. Thornton also had a daughter, Thornvillia-Rockingham Thornton, who was born to a mistress, Priscilla Duins, in 1801.<br>
<br>Thornton made two expeditions to the Scottish highlands about 1786, which were described as one journey in his book <span class="italic">A sporting tour through the northern parts of England and great parts of the highlands of Scotland</span> (1804), which was probably ghost-written by a Revd Martyn. A sloop was chartered for Thornton, his guests, servants, dogs, hawks, and guns; other supplies were sent by road so that the party lived in luxurious conditions in floored tents with doors and stoves, and they entertained visitors to lavish dinners. A tour of France during which Thornton met Napoleon was described in <span class="italic">A Sporting Tour through Various Parts of France</span> (1806). Thornton was a substantial patron of the artists George Garrard, Philip Reinagle, and Sawrey Gilpin, whom he took with him on his travels to record his exploits. Thornton had been appointed colonel of the West Yorkshire militia but was forced to resign after a court martial in 1795 for allowing his soldiers to draw him into camp in a triumphal carriage, although he retained his rank.<br>
<br>Thornton entertained lavishly, with unbounded hospitality, providing field sports for large groups of gentlemen, but contemporaries wrote that he became greatly unpopular and lost people's respect by his shabby tricks and deceitful behaviour. He led an ostentatious life with two London houses and his family seat of Thornville. The latter was sold and he bought the duke of York's large mansion at nearby Allerton Mauleverer in 1789, and in 1791 he built a hunting lodge, Falconer's Hall, at Boythorpe. These Yorkshire properties were sold in 1805 to pay his debts and he quitted Yorkshire with great panache, moving to Spye Park, Wiltshire, which he rented. Reports in the <span class="italic">Hull Advertiser</span> for November 1808 refer to his final departure followed by a cavalcade consisting of a &#145;boat waggon covered with skins of stags &hellip; otter spears, fishing rods and guns &hellip; a dog cart with milk white terriers [and] &hellip; a hundred staghounds&#146;. The procession was made up of horses, a falconer in livery, and nine more wagons. His considerable art collection, including pictures by Rubens and Van Dyck, was auctioned to pay his debts in London in 1819. After several visits to France, Thornton went to live there some time after 1817. He bought a derelict ch&acirc;teau at Pont-sur-Seine, south-east of Paris, and rented the Ch&acirc;teau de Chambourd there, from which he styled himself marquis de Pont and prince de Chambourd. He died in lodgings in Paris on 10 March 1823, leaving his estate to his illegitimate daughter. The will was successfully contested in London and France by his wife, on behalf of their son.<br>
