<span class="headword">Pipe,  Hannah Elizabeth</span>  (1831&#150;1906), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born at 8 Market Street, Manchester, on 27 November 1831. She was the only child of William Pipe (<i>d</i>. 1841), a Wesleyan local preacher and owner of a cutlery shop, and his wife, Susanna Spencer (<i>d</i>. 1871). Soon after Hannah's birth the family moved to the Greenhays district, which was later to become the site of Manchester University. She had a happy childhood until she was nine, when her father died, leaving the family with very little money. Her mother, Susanna, a woman of great character, kept up family standards by reopening and working in their shop. She was determined to get Hannah the best possible education and sent her, first, to a school run by the Society of Friends under the supervision of Charles Cumber and an able teacher, Miss Fessant, who was the lady superintendent. Then, when Hannah was sixteen, she was sent to become a pupil of Dr William Ballantyne Hodgson, the new principal of Chorlton high school. Hodgson thought highly of her abilities. He encouraged her to take up teaching and mapped out a programme of study for her.<br>
<br>In 1848 Hannah Pipe opened a small private day school at 46 Wright Street, Manchester, which was so successful that her mother was able to stop working in their shop. She joined Hannah in the work at the school, and in 1852 they moved to a larger house at 27 Acomb Street. There they took in boarders as well as day girls. Hannah had now found her vocation, as an exceptionally gifted teacher of young girls. Her pupils were mainly the daughters of nonconformist manufacturers and businessmen. She aimed to try to raise the new generation to higher standards in the art of living and to give them as good an education as their brothers received. Her ambition was &#145;to get hold of these girls with money and without refinement from their earlier years, and to open their eyes to all that is best in this life and in that which is to come&#146;  (Stoddart, 62). This work, which had been started as a way of earning her living, became to her both mission and vocation&#151;her whole life and being were devoted to it. But, even in Manchester, she had difficulty in finding teachers who could follow her methods. Friends urged her to move to London, and after making sure that her pupils' parents agreed she and her mother took the great step in 1856, and rented Latham Lodge, in Clapham Park, where she took in fifteen boarders, mainly from Wesleyan Methodist families. She had earlier been captivated by Stanley's life of Dr Arnold, and renamed the house after his school at Laleham &#145;where he first used his power of guiding character&#146;  (Stoddart, 57). She now determined &#145;to expect the same attainment in the lives of girls as he reached in the lives of boys&#146;  (ibid.). She considered &#145;private schools in England for girls of the upper-middle class were, for the most part miserably bad &hellip; and worse still, there was no demand for anything better. The majority of parents thought almost any teaching was good enough for girls&#146;  (ibid., 419). Her school was so successful that in 1860 they moved Laleham Lodge to a larger house in Clarence Road, where they took in twenty-five boarders at the high annual fee of 100 guineas each. The school, which was run like a household, remained there until 1908.<br>
<br>Laleham had a distinguished staff of teachers; Miss Pipe decided that only the best were good enough for her girls. William Sterndale Bennett taught music, George Macdonald lectured on literature, and William Huggins on science. Two exiles from the 1848 revolutions, Dr Grottfried Kinkel and Adolf Sonnenschein, taught physical geography and arithmetic, the latter a subject poorly taught in girls' schools and even thought by some to be bad for their health. The curriculum was notably wide-ranging and enlightened, despite the objections of some more conservative Methodist parents. Her girls not only read Shakespeare aloud but acted out his plays. Many of them came from prosperous families and were not expected to have to earn their own living. She saw no point in preparing them for external examinations, and doubted the benefit of Emily Davies's campaign to admit girls to the examinations run by the universities, believing examinations to be equally damaging to boys and girls. She did, however, acknowledge their usefulness as tests of competence for professional purposes. Although she took no part in the efforts to open universities to women, she did not discourage girls who wanted to join the new women's colleges at Cambridge. One pupil, Amy Bulley, a younger sister of Ella Armitage, studied at both Girton and Newnham colleges (Miss Pipe preferred Newnham, which did not follow Emily Davies's rigid policy at Girton of subjecting women students to the same curriculum as men). Ten Laleham pupils went on to Newnham between 1873 and 1893, including the historian Alice Gardner.<br>
<br>In 1871 Hannah Pipe's mother died and she greatly missed her support in running the school. Even so, she expanded her activities and opened a preparatory department, Laleham Lea, to prepare younger girls for the high standards she expected from her seniors. She became increasingly interested in philanthropic work, forming a link between Laleham and an orphanage at Streatham, which the girls helped to run, where she encouraged in them ideals of voluntary social service. The causes which she supported included Octavia Hill's campaign for healthy housing and &#145;humane landlordism&#146;, temperance, missions, and &#145;justice to other nations&#146;, emphasized by her strong opposition to the opium trade. She avoided party political involvement and &#145;was splendidly indifferent to the latter-day cry for women's franchise&#146;  (Stoddart, 283). The broad-church teachings of Arnold and Maurice were strong influences on her, though she remained a lifelong Methodist. At Laleham her religious teaching avoided proselytizing, and she was careful to guard against anything which would open her to charges, sometimes levelled at pious women teachers, of playing on the emotions of her pupils.<br>
<br>Going by photographs of her at this time, Hannah Pipe was not strikingly beautiful, but had a fine head of hair and dressed with care and dignity. She had many offers of marriage but turned them all down, being, as she said, &#145;wedded to her work&#146;  (Stoddart, 257). The strain, without her mother's help, began to take its toll, and she suffered from severe headaches and asthma. She regularly took good holidays and would, occasionally, travel from London to Brighton to hire a horse and gallop over the Downs until she felt revived, but finally she had to take her doctor's advice to go for a health cure. She chose Dr Rikli's at Veldes am See. She visited that spa from 1883 until 1896 and there could be completely relaxed, but each year, not long after her return to Clapham, her illnesses would recur. In 1900 she retired to Hookwood Cottage, Limpsfield, Surrey, and handed her school over to the Misses Swindells, who had been responsible for the preparatory school. She attended the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of Laleham Lodge in June 1906, when more than 300 pupils were there to greet her. Hannah Pipe died on 29 December 1906 at her home in Limpsfield, mourned by everyone who knew her. Her obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> refers to &#145;the gentle radiance of mind and spirit so conspicuous in this beautiful character&#146;.<br>
