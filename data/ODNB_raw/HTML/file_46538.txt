<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Parry,  William John</span>  (1842&#150;1927), <span class="occ">labour leader and businessman</span>, was born on 28 September 1842 at 58 High Street, Bethesda, Caernarvonshire, the only child of John Parry (1803&#150;1850), quarryman and deacon, and his second wife, Elizabeth (1804&#150;1864), daughter of John Jones, joiner. From 1854 to 1856 he attended Llanrwst grammar school, where he acquired fluency in English, which enabled him to act as interpreter and letter writer for the Welsh-speaking quarrymen. Influenced by the Revd Rowland Williams (Hwfa M&ocirc;n), Parry developed literary and musical interests and became deacon of Bethesda Chapel. A bearded, stocky figure in adulthood, in 1864 he set up a business as accountant, general merchant, and dealer in explosives, and became a chartered accountant in 1880. Parry was married three times: in 1864 to Jane Roberts, in 1878 to Mary Pugh, and in 1902 to Mary Guy. There were four sons (one died young, in 1867), and a daughter. One son committed suicide in 1898, another was a financial liability, and Parry's need for money drove him into a wide range of businesses. By 1895 he was not only a chartered accountant, but also the land agent for the Cefnfaes estate, Bethesda; a merchant of brick, cement, timber, iron, fuse, and oil; the agent for two shipping lines; and an insurance agent. By 1901 he was also a registered moneylender in the Gwynedd Loan and Discount Company, based in Bethesda.<br>
<br>From 1863 to 1879 Parry was Liberal agent for Bethesda, taking part in the campaign for the election in 1868, when George S. G. Douglas-Pennant lost his seat to T. Love D. Jones-Parry, the Liberal candidate. In 1874 Douglas-Pennant regained his seat, and Parry, depressed by the &#145;servility&#146; of the quarrymen, took no part in the 1880 election when the Liberal C. J. Watkin Williams won the seat. Parry moved into Coetmor Hall, Bethesda, in 1884, and became a shareholder and director of the company which took over a group of radical Welsh newspapers. In 1888 he was editor of <span class="italic">Y Genedl Gymreig</span> and of <span class="italic">Y Werin</span>, giving up the post in 1892, when the Welsh National Press Company, of which he was a director, took over.<br>
<br>In 1888 Parry gave evidence to the select committee on town holdings; in 1892 he gave evidence before the royal commission on labour; and in 1893 he gave evidence before the royal commission on land in Wales and Monmouth. He advocated the disestablishment of the Anglican Church in Wales and supported home rule for Wales. When the University College of North Wales was established in Bangor in 1884, he laid the foundations of its Welsh library by appealing for books and manuscripts, donating over 1500 books himself. He was the author of books and pamphlets in English and in Welsh, and wrote in a powerful style. His ambition to become an MP was never achieved; but he travelled to the USA and Canada to research better conditions for quarrymen. He went to Patagonia in 1893 and again in 1894 in a vain search for gold and personal wealth, as he was involved in the Welsh Patagonian Gold Fields Syndicate (1892), which was dissolved in 1907.<br>
<br>Parry's most controversial role was as &#145;quarryman's champion&#146;. In 1865 he helped to negotiate the end of a strike at Penrhyn quarry, causing Lord Penrhyn to describe him, in 1870, as a &#145;troublesome fellow &hellip; a thoroughly bad one&#146;  (University of Wales, Bangor, Archives of trade unions at Penrhyn quarry). In 1874 Parry took the lead in the formation of the North Wales Quarrymen's Union; he served as its secretary from 1874 to 1876. He organized an appeal in 1874 for the Penrhyn quarrymen on strike, describing the struggle as &#145;right against might&#146;. In November 1874 the quarrymen gained the Pennant Lloyd agreement, which gave them higher wages, a committee to be appointed by the employees to hear grievances, and a reorganization of the Penrhyn Quarry Benefit Club, of which Parry became secretary at &pound;80 per annum. Arthur Wyatt, the chief manager, gave him the monopoly of supplying explosives to the quarry, said to be worth &pound;2000 per annum.<br>
<br>In 1885 Lord Penrhyn's son, George Douglas-Pennant, took over the quarry and in 1886, when his father died, George, now Lord Penrhyn, appointed E. A. Young (1860&#150;1910), a London chartered accountant, as chief manager. Wyatt was dismissed and the Pennant Lloyd agreement was ended. Parry's contract was not renewed. Lord Penrhyn made it clear that he would not tolerate interference by union members between employer and employed. Parry was president of the union from 1877 to 1879 and was re-elected annually as president from 1884 to 1889. In 1893 the union gave him an illuminated address and a cheque for &pound;440 for his services to the &#145;sons of toil&#146;  (minute book, Gwynedd Archives Service, PQ Add. MS). In 1893 Parry failed to get a post in the new labour department of the Board of Trade and on 14 October 1896 his warehouse was destroyed by fire, causing him financial hardship. In 1896&#150;7 he emerged to play the part of peacemaker in the negotiations at the end of the ten-month strike at Penrhyn quarry, but the employees gained no concessions. Parry failed to get back his contract for explosives, and he severed relations with the union in 1898, declaring himself &#145;nearly broken by disappointment and hopes blasted&#146;  (University of Wales, Bangor, Coetmor MS 66, 16 July 1898).<br>
<br>By 1900 the slate industry was depressed and labour relations at Penrhyn quarry were deteriorating. The Penrhyn dispute (1900&#150;03) began in October 1900, with outbreaks of violence by the quarrymen against two contractors in the quarry. The men were locked out until 11 June 1901, when &#145;loyal&#146; quarrymen were taken back. Parry became secretary of the relief committee, which raised &pound;46,763 for dependants of those not eligible for union pay. He saw the struggle not as a national one, but as &#145;one Tyrannical Feudal Lord&#146; against himself and the men  (<span class="italic">Daily News</span>, 1 July 1901). In 1901 he called Lord Penrhyn &#145;the greatest enemy I have on earth&#146;  (<i>Penrhyn v. Parry</i>, Gwynedd Archives Service, PQ Add. MS). He won over the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> to the strikers' cause. In 1901 he became manager of Pantddreiniog quarry, run on co-operative lines, but it failed and was closed by 1911. In March 1903 Lord Penrhyn won a libel action against Parry for his false statements printed in <span class="italic">The Clarion</span> on 22 June 1901. Parry was ordered to pay &pound;500 damages and costs amounting to &pound;2508, and was saved from bankruptcy only by the Parry Defence Fund, which paid the sum. The quarrymen, without funds, surrendered on 14 November 1903; few of them were re-employed and Bethesda remained divided and impoverished.<br>
<br>Parry continued to sit on public bodies and was made a CBE in 1920. He died at Coetmor Hall, Bethesda, on 1 September 1927, a fallen idol, lonely and embittered. He was buried in Maes-y-groes churchyard near Penrhyn Castle.<br>
