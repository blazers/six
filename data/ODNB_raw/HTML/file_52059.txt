<span class="headword">Frost,  John Dutton</span>  (1912&#150;1993), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Poona, India, on 31 December 1912, the son of Brigadier-General Frank Dutton Frost (<i>d</i>. 1968), army officer and later missionary, and his wife, Elsie Dora, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bright (<i>d</i>. 1952). He was educated at Wellington College, Monkton Combe School, and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and was commissioned into the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) in 1932. In September 1936 the regiment moved to Palestine, where the Arabs were rebelling against the growth in Jewish settlements and attacking the police and British troops. The Cameronians occasionally had brisk fights with terrorists, but also established friendly relationships by playing football matches against the younger Arabs. While there Frost wrote a Christmas pantomime which ran to four successful performances. At the end of this tour he returned to Hampshire before being posted in 1938 to Habbaniyyah, Iraq, where there was an RAF station. He was given command of a company of Kurds, who, as he recalled, &#145;despised the Arabs, distrusted the Assyrians, and took a rather poor view of the British&#146;  (Frost, <span class="italic">Nearly There</span>, 54). However, they approved of Frost.<br>
<br>Frost returned to Britain in 1941 and was posted to the 10th Cameronians, then engaged in preparing beach defences on the Suffolk coast. Finding the work extremely boring, he volunteered to become a parachutist. Having qualified within three days, he was appointed adjutant of the 2nd Parachute battalion (2 Para), which was just being formed. He recalled that most of the battalion were Scots who had volunteered because they thought this the quickest way to see action. &#145;They weren't particular who they fought and if there was no one else available as an enemy, then the English would do&#146;  (Frost, <span class="italic">A Drop Too Many</span>, 26). In February 1942 2 Para was chosen to take part in a raid on the radar station at Bruneval, near Le Havre. The station was thought (rightly) to contain new equipment which was enabling the Germans to take a heavy toll on British bombers flying over the continent. In a successful mission the raiders removed vital equipment, and destroyed much else in order to disguise the main purpose of their mission. Frost was among those called to Downing Street to brief Churchill and the war cabinet on 3 March 1942. The Bruneval raid was instrumental in the war cabinet's subsequent decision to establish an airborne division.<br>
<br>In November 1942 Frost and his battalion landed in Algiers, from where the First Army was planning to reach Tunis and trap the axis forces between themselves and the Eighth Army. On a reconnaissance flight Frost was shot down by Americans who mistook his aircraft for a German bomber: fortunately he was unhurt. The regiment then parachuted into Oudna, where they were heavily outnumbered. After three days' heavy fighting Frost reached the British lines at Medjez al-Bab, with only 160 of his men. Frost &#145;was understandably bitter about the waste of his battalion on this ill-conceived mission. It was little consolation to be told that his wild-goose-chase had diverted considerable German strength at a critical juncture&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 24 May 1993). Frost's battalion subsequently took part in much of the thickest fighting in the north African campaign, distinguishing itself in particular at Djebel Mansour, Tamera, and Sedjennane. After Tunisia 2 Para parachuted into Sicily and subsequently fought as a conventional infantry force. At the end of this campaign the battalion landed in Italy (from warships), but after some brisk fighting it was withdrawn to return to Britain, in order to prepare for the invasion of Normandy.<br>
<br>In September 1944 the 1st airborne division (to which Frost's battalion belonged) was allotted the task of dropping at Arnhem and capturing the road and railway bridges over the Rhine. These were bridges which the allies needed to capture undamaged in their plans to outflank the German Siegfried line. Although the bridges over the Maas and the Waal were captured without too much difficulty, the Arnhem plan proved a disaster for the lightly armed 1st airborne division, which went in by parachute and glider. Unfortunately on the day of the drop General Model, commander-in-chief of the German forces, was lunching at Oosterbeek, 6 miles from Arnhem, and was able to concentrate 9th and 10th Panzer divisions (armed with tanks and self-propelled guns), four divisional battle groups, and an infantry division in the Arnhem area. This vast numerical superiority over the 10,000 members of 1st airborne division was matched by much heavier weaponry than the British division had been able to bring in by air. Desperate attempts were made by the British 30th corps to push through the Netherlands, where the roads were narrow, the dykes flooded, and the Germans making every effort to impede them, in order to reinforce the beleaguered airborne force, but the task proved impossible in the time.<br>
<br>Frost, whose battalion had been dropped 8 miles from Arnhem on 18 September, had to fight through opposition to reach the road bridge (the railway bridge having been destroyed by the Germans just as Frost's men approached it), but then occupied the north end and nearby buildings. In the initial attacks on their position Frost's paratroopers managed to set on fire many of the enemy vehicles but were then assailed by shells, mortar bombs, machine-guns, and flame-throwers. To these were soon added huge Tiger tanks. The battle raged for three days and two nights. Half of the original airborne force were killed or badly wounded but as time went on they were joined by signals, sappers, and gunners who had been driven back from their original dropping zones and who now fought as infantry, inspired to heroism by Frost's encouragement and example. Snipers fired at them from the rooftops, the buildings were full of wounded or dead, and they were running short of water. Blood was everywhere but there was a clear resolve to fight to the death. Surprisingly, Frost recalled: &#145;We were content. Amid the din of continuous fire and crash of falling burning buildings, laughter was often heard&#146;  (Frost, <span class="italic">A Drop Too Many</span>, 220). When 1st airborne were eventually given orders to surrender or escape, they had had 1130 killed and 6450 (mostly wounded) captured. The Germans, who had themselves had 3300 killed and wounded, praised their opponents and treated them well. Frost, who had been wounded by a mortar bomb, only agreed to surrender when the Germans managed to set on fire the building in which the severely wounded were being sheltered. He spent the next six months in a German hospital, from which he was liberated by the American army in April 1945.<br>
<br>After the war Frost went to Norway to run the battle school of 1st airborne division, from which he returned to command 2 Para again, this time in Palestine on internal security duty. In 1947 he attended the Staff College, Camberley, before becoming GSO2 on the staff of 52nd Lowland division. On his 35th birthday, 31 December 1947, he married Jean MacGregor Lyle (<i>b</i>. 1921/2), daughter of Philip Lyle, sugar refiner. They had a son and a daughter. From 1949 to 1952 Frost attended the senior officers' school; he then spent two years in Malaya during the emergency as GSO1 in 17th Gurkha division. From 1955 to 1957 he commanded the support weapons wing of the school of infantry at Netheravon; he then commanded the 44th Parachute brigade (TA) in London, before being appointed general officer commanding 52nd Lowland division. Finally he was general officer commanding troops in Malta and Libya and commander, Malta land forces, from 1964 to 1966. He retired from the army with the rank of major-general. He was awarded an MC in 1942, a DSO in 1943 and a bar to it in 1945, and appointed CB in 1964. On retiring from the army he bought a derelict farm in Milland, Hampshire, and with his wife worked hard for many years before making a success of it.<br>
<br>Frost was a quiet, unassuming man, who described himself in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> as a farmer, but was one of the most effective and popular leaders of the Second World War. In his youth he had been a good oarsman who rowed at Henley regatta, was chosen for the Sandhurst modern pentathlon team, learned to fly, and played polo and golf.<br>
<br>Frost thought the Sicily campaign was badly planned, that the Arnhem operation was a mistake, and that the allies should have captured Rotterdam instead. He was also critical of the planning of the 1982 Falklands campaign. His forthright opinions were not popular with diplomatists or politicians and were thought to have prevented his rise to a higher rank. In retirement he was active in church and Conservative Party matters. He was deputy lieutenant for Sussex in 1982.<br>
<br>In the film <span class="italic">A Bridge Too Far</span> (1976), about Arnhem, he was portrayed by Anthony Hopkins. In 1977 the Dutch officially renamed the road bridge at Arnhem the John Frostbrug. Frost wrote two volumes of autobiography, <span class="italic">A Drop Too Many</span> (1980), and <span class="italic">Nearly There</span> (1992), and an account of his old battalion's feats in the south Atlantic campaign of 1982, <span class="italic">Two Para&#151;Falklands</span> (1983). He died of prostate cancer at his home, North End Farm, Milland, on 21 May 1993. He was survived by his wife and two children.<br>
