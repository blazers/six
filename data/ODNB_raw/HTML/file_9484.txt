</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fischer,  Johann Christian</span>  (1733&#150;1800), <span class="occ">oboist and composer</span>, was born in Freiburg im Breisgau. Little is known of his early life, but Burney reports that he was &#145;brought up at one of the common reading schools &hellip; where all the children learn music, with reading and writing&#146;  (Rees). An annotation on the manuscript of an oboe concerto in G by Alessandro Besozzi (1702&#150;1793) states that it was &#145;performed by Mr Fischer &hellip; in 1757 at Warshow [Warsaw]&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 34717, fols. 20&#150;29b). This performance may have been Fischer's introduction to Augustus III, king of Poland and elector of Saxony, whose <i>Kapelle</i> he joined at Dresden in 1760. He remained there until about 1764 before proceeding to Berlin for a brief sojourn at the court of Frederick the Great. By 1765 he had travelled to Italy, where he studied with Besozzi and, according to F&eacute;tis, perfected his taste through studying the style of the greatest singers of the day. F&eacute;tis also notes that he performed at the Concert Spirituel in Paris, and other reports establish that he visited Mannheim and the Netherlands about the same time. The nine-year-old Mozart, for example, was impressed by him at The Hague in 1765. By 1766, however, Fischer was back in Dresden, followed by a second period with Frederick the Great in 1767, allegedly in succession to C. P. E. Bach.<br>
<br>At some time in 1768 Fischer arrived in London, where he gave his first solo public performance at the Thatched House tavern on 2 June 1768&#151;a concert notable for J. C. Bach's performance on the pianoforte, its first public outing as a solo instrument in England. His reputation as an outstandingly gifted oboist spread rapidly throughout Britain, leading to his participation at all London's concert series and pleasure gardens. According to Charlotte Papendiek, by 1774 he had joined the &#145;private quarttet parties&#146;  (<span class="italic">Court and Private Life</span>, 1.65) at court, and about 1781 he was appointed one of Queen Charlotte's chamber musicians with a yearly salary of &pound;180. He was also active outside London, performing in Bath several times between 1768 and 1790 and in addition visiting Dublin, Bristol, Manchester, Oxford, Worcester, Hereford, Gloucester, Salisbury, and Winchester.<br>
<br>Fischer's prodigious success was due to a combination of technical ability, musicality, and innovation, aided by his introduction to England of a new German design of oboe. In comparison with previous oboes, the instrument he introduced had a dramatically reduced bore, resulting in a lighter, more delicate tone, with raised fundamental pitch and an extended range. Enthusiastic reports of Fischer's playing abound, but focus particularly on the quality and clarity of his tone, his ability to manipulate it, and his technical abilities, particularly the playing of extremes of register.<br>
<br>At Bath in the summer of 1775 Fischer became acquainted with Mary (1748&#150;1826), elder daughter of the artist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10282/', "Thomas Gainsborough")</script>. Gainsborough was not in favour of the liaison, which began in secret, but the couple married on 21 November 1780. Within a year the couple had separated, the blame apparently resting entirely upon the &#145;occasional aberrations of mind&#146; of the bride  (Parke, 1.335). Mary did not die until 1826, when she bequeathed her father's famous portrait of her husband to George IV.<br>
<br>Written in the <i>galant</i> style of his friends J. C. Bach and Abel, Fischer's compositions seem to have been mostly well received, Burney, for example, praising his &#145;very original and ingenious productions&#146;  (Burney, <span class="italic">Account</span>, 105). Other commentators criticized &#145;his desire to be original&#146;  (<span class="italic">ABC Dario Musico</span>, 21), noting that it &#145;often produces thoughts whimsical and outr&eacute;&#146;  (ibid.), and in 1787 Mozart suggested that the concertos were excessively long and repetitive. These nine concertos for oboe, published between 1768 and 1785, were Fischer's most successful works. In 1774 Mozart used the minuet theme from Fischer's first concerto in C as the basis for his twelve variations for clavier, K. 179/189a, J. C. Bach and Johann Schroeter made keyboard arrangements of several of the concertos, and a further unknown concerto in E[flat] (<i>c</i>.1795) was transcribed by the London-based Dutch composer John Lewis Hoeberechts. Fischer's other extant compositions are rather unremarkable works for various chamber groupings.<br>
<br>Despite Fischer's impressive rendition of Handel's &#145;4th oboe concerto&#146; at the 1784 Handel commemoration in Westminster Abbey, George III did not appoint him as either court oboist or master of the king's band when these posts fell vacant, and perhaps for this reason Fischer returned to the continent in 1786. Mozart heard Fischer for a second time in Vienna in 1787, but was disappointed by the experience, and it may be that his abilities were declining at this time. Fischer's return to Britain about 1790 does seem to have marked the end of his public career, apart from an isolated concert for his own benefit at the Pantheon in 1792; however, he remained a popular participant in the musical activities at court.<br>
<br>Many anecdotes regarding Fischer's life are recounted in the writings of his contemporaries, but that by Burney is perhaps most apt. &#145;Fischer was the most pleasing and perfect performer on the hautbois, and the most ingenious composer for that instrument that has ever delighted our country during full sixty years&#146;, but &#145;he had not a single grain of sense but what he breathed through his reed&#146;  (Rees). His students included many of the best-known performers of the day, and his influence on countless others is clear. <span class="italic">ABC Dario Musico</span> noted of William Parke that &#145;he need not blush to own that he owes much of his improvement to Fischer&#146;  (p. 38), and it is apparent from other contemporary comments that his technique was the yardstick by which that of other players was judged.<br>
<br>In a concert at the Queen's House on 29 April 1800 Fischer &#145;executed his first movement in a style equal to his best performance during any part of his life&#146;, but then had an &#145;apoplectic fit&#146;. He was taken to his home in Frith Street, Soho, and assisted by the king's own physicians, but died about an hour later (Parke, 1.334; Sainsbury, 1.249). His last request was that his compositions be presented to the king, and these manuscripts now form the major source of Fischer's music. Other manuscripts with certainty ascribed to Fischer can be found at the Bautzen Museum, Bautzen, Germany; the Benediktinerstift, Melk an der Donau, Austria; the Badische Landesbibliothek, Karlsruhe, Germany; and the F&uuml;rstlich Thurn und Taxisische Hofbibliothek, Regensburg, Germany. His place of burial is unknown.<br>
