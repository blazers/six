<span class="headword">Mactaggart,  William Alexander</span>  (1906&#150;2002), <span class="occ">woollen manufacturer</span>, was born at Braeside, Weensland Road, Hawick, Roxburghshire, on 17 August 1906, the son of William Alexander Main Mactaggart, businessman, and his wife, Margaret Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cooper. He was educated at St Mary's preparatory school, Melrose, and then at Sedbergh School, where he was advised &#145;I don't think we will make much of a scholar of you, I think your time would be better spent following some other pursuit&#146;  (private information). He took up rugby, playing for two seasons at centre in the first fifteen and remaining an enthusiast for the rest of his life. He first played for the Greens, Hawick Rugby Football Club, on new year's day 1924, and he served as its president during its centenary year in 1972.<br>
<br>On leaving school, instead of joining the family woollen business of Mactaggart Brothers, Mactaggart was apprenticed to Robert Pringle &amp; Sons, which manufactured underwear largely for the domestic market. This was a common practice before returning to a family firm, but he chose to stay and was appointed a director in 1932 and joint managing director in 1933. Three years later he persuaded his colleagues to change the company's name to Pringles and to diversify into fashion knitwear, including sweaters. Between 1926 and 1933 he served with the King's Own Scottish Borderers territorial army battalion and on the outbreak of war he was put in command of the Hawick air training corps. He later served from 1942 to 1945 with the Royal Army Service Corps in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands where he developed his considerable managerial and organizational skills.<br>
<br>On demobilization Mactaggart's fellow managing director, Arthur Oddy, left to join a competitor, Ballantynes, and Mactaggart found himself in sole charge of Pringles, with a workforce of 200. With the home market still controlled by rationing, he responded to the government's call to export. During the next four years he claimed to have travelled round the world four times in search of new business and renewing contact with pre-war customers and suppliers. His industry paid off and Pringles became a byword for high-quality knitwear, gaining two royal warrants and two queen's awards for industry. The company bucked the trend of the decline in British textile manufacture. Its twin-sets, sweaters, and cardigans (mostly featuring a distinctive diamond pattern) were worn by film stars like Deborah Kerr and Margaret Lockwood, and the firm cornered the market in fashionable knitwear for golfers. In 1964 Mactaggart was appointed CBE in recognition of his contribution to the woollen trades. He had a very &#145;hands-on&#146; style of management, regularly walking the shop floor and talking to the workforce. He attributed the firm's success under his leadership to the team spirit these visits engendered. He once claimed that &#145;At Pringle we never give orders: just ask for things to be done&#151;and expect them to be done&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Herald</span>, 10 June 2002). By the time he retired in 1969 Pringles employed over 2000 people and had a turnover in excess of &pound;5 million, mostly in exports. After his retirement, Pringles continued to expand in the 1970s and 1980s, building in particular on its share in the market for golfing knitwear, though its reputation as the manufacturer of the preferred leisurewear of many football hooligans was an unwelcome accolade, and the company suffered a decline in the 1990s. In 1998 Pringles shut its 280-worker Berwick plant and cut jobs at its Hawick plant, but a takeover in 2000 by Hong Kong-based S. C. Fang &amp; Sons resulted in a reinvigoration of the company and a swift return to profitability.<br>
<br>Mactaggart's other great passion, besides rugby, was horseriding, and he hunted with the Buccleuch, of which he served as chairman from 1969 until 1981. He was proud of the borders' tradition of common riding. Indeed, he had been elected cornet for Hawick in 1930 and then married the cornet's lass, Marjorie Laing Innes (1908/9&#150;1998), daughter of Harry Scott Riddell Innes, hosiery manufacturer, on 30 June 1932; they had two sons, Bruce and Alan, and a daughter, Claire. Making his family home at Lilliesleaf from 1946, Mactaggart served as an elder in the parish church for almost fifty years. When the church was restored in 1966 he and his wife donated three stained-glass windows.<br>
<br>Marjorie Mactaggart died in 1998 and Mactaggart himself died at the Borders General Hospital, Melrose, on 23 May 2002, following a stroke. He was survived by his three children. After his death a former provost of Hawick wrote of him:<blockquote>Few men have served Hawick so well or have endeared themselves so completely to our townspeople as William Mactaggart has done. He has been a patron and provider for many years and his interests have been so widespread that he has touched in some way the lives of each and every one of us. Despite his achievements, Willie has always been truly a man of the people, and possibly his finest quality was his ability to communicate and enjoy friendships with others in different walks of life.
