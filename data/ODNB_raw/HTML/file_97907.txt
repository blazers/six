<span class="headword">Hancock,  (Clarence Henry) Ralph</span>  (1893&#150;1950), <span class="occ">landscape architect and garden designer</span>, was born at 20 Keppoch Street, Cardiff, on 2 July 1893, the eldest of three sons of Clarence Hancock (1868&#150;1923), estate agent and auctioneer, and his wife, Clara Adelaide, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thomas (1870&#150;1937). He followed his father into the auctioneer's business. On the outbreak of the First World War he enlisted as a private in the Territorial Army. In December 1915 he was commissioned second lieutenant in the Welsh (howitzer) brigade in 1915, but was invalided out in 1916. He married at Penarth on 17 September 1917 Hilda Muriel (1897&#150;1969), daughter of Harold Bramley Ellis, clothing manufacturer of Letchworth, Hertfordshire. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>In his early career Hancock was a marine and general insurance broker, working in Cardiff, but following business failure in 1921 he moved into professional gardening and in 1926 he became a fellow of the Royal Horticultural Society. In 1927 he undertook the first of his more famous garden projects, designing and constructing a rock and water garden for Princess Victoria, sister of George V, at her home, Coppins, Iver, in Buckinghamshire. In May 1930 he sailed to New York to promote his work in the USA, publishing a brochure, <span class="italic">English Gardens in America</span>, which referred to his royal patronage as a landscape gardener and illustrated Hancock's characteristic design features, such as the use of low Cotswold stone walls combined with wrought iron gates. He designed a garden at Erie Station in New Jersey to exhibit his work. He also staged exhibits at the Massachusetts horticulture show, where he won several awards including in 1933 the president's cup. He was one of the designers of the Lydia Duff Gray Hubbard garden in New Jersey, which became part of the Garden Club of America collection.<br>
<br>Between 1933 and 1935 Hancock undertook his most ambitious project, a series of roof gardens called the Gardens of Nations on the eleventh floor of the RCA building in the Rockefeller Center, New York, designed to reflect the cultural styles of gardens from Holland, France, Spain, Italy, Japan, and England. Construction of the gardens involved hauling up 3000 tons of earth, 500 tons of brick, and 100 tons of natural stone by means of the service elevator. Trees which proved to be too tall to fit in the elevator were brought up the side of the building using a block and tackle. Throughout the project he was in regular correspondence with both John D. and Nelson Rockefeller. The roof terrace gardens opened in April 1935 and were illustrated in Hancock's book <span class="italic">When I Make a Garden</span>, which was published in the same year. The book, which was reprinted in 1950, illustrated many of the gardens he had designed in Britain and America, and set out some of his practices, notably his experience that the transplanting of mature trees was both possible and not prohibitively expensive.<br>
<br>The gardens at the Rockefeller Center led to Hancock being commissioned by Trevor Bowen, the managing director of Barkers, who had taken over Derry and Toms department store in High Street, Kensington, to create a similar effect in the heart of London. After returning with his family to Britain he created three gardens on the rooftop of Derry and Toms: a Spanish garden, a Tudor garden, and a woodland garden with a stream, a waterfall, and a rustic bridge. The gardens, which occupied an acre and offered views out to the Surrey hills, opened in May 1938. During this period Hancock was also a successful exhibitor at the Chelsea flower show, winning gold medals for his display gardens in 1936, 1937, and 1938. These award-winning gardens moved away from his earlier naturalistic rock garden style towards the more arts and crafts style with which he became associated. He also exhibited gardens at the Ideal Home Exhibition in 1936, 1937, and 1938, collaborating with the author Rafael Sabatini on the 1938 garden, which took as its theme &#145;novelists and their gardens&#146;.<br>
<br>In June 1940 Hancock returned to military service with the rank of captain. His second son, Denys, was killed in action in the following year. After the war he worked with his elder son, Bramley (1918&#150;1989), as Ralph Hancock &amp; Son, and designed gardens of peace at Temple Newsam in Leeds, but these were not constructed. In 1948 Sir David Evans Bevan, a director of Barclays Bank, commissioned him to build the gardens at Twyn-yr-Hydd House, Margam. In Wales he also designed and built a garden in Llanblethian near Cowbridge that was regarded as one of the finest landscaped gardens in the Vale of Glamorgan. These were probably the last gardens he created before his death, from heart failure, at the National Heart Hospital, London, on 30 August 1950. He was cremated at Golders Green and his ashes were later scattered in the Thames by his widow and his daughter, Sheila.<br>
