<span class="headword">Day,  John</span>  (1566&#150;1628), <span class="occ">Aristotelian scholar and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born &#145;in or over Aldersgate in London&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 412), the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7367/', "John Day (1521/2&#150;1584)")</script>, printer, and his wife, Alice Lehunte (<i>d</i>. 1612), and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7371/', "Richard Day (b. 1552, d. in or before 1606)")</script>, Lionel, and twenty-four other siblings of whom only Lionel survived him. Admitted to St Alban Hall, Oxford, in 1582, he graduated BA on 15 February 1587. Elected a fellow of Oriel College on 8 May 1588, he was admitted on 23 September, and proceeded MA in 1591. He remained a fellow until his death, holding the offices of senior treasurer (1593/4, 1601/2, 1604/5, 1608/9) and dean (1601, 1611&#150;12, 1616).<br>
<br>Day was a significant exponent of the revived philosophy of Aristotle, taught in Elizabethan Oxford by John Case and John Rainolds. In 1589 he was asked by the fellows of his college to expound the text of Aristotle in the light of modern learning to the scholars of Oriel; the text of his lectures on the <span class="italic">Physics</span> survives, together with the headings of various arguments for and against numerous Aristotelian propositions, apparently for college disputations. His course must have paralleled that of Rainolds at Corpus Christi College, and his references, inserted in his lecture text, show that he shared the catholic learning of Case. Beside the Latin and Greek classics and modern humanist writers, including his contemporary Joseph Scaliger, he cited with approval numerous scholastic commentators, especially Aquinas, and singled out for praise three contemporary Jesuits. His extremely wide and eclectic reading allowed him, like Rainolds and Case, to relate the teaching of Aristotle to the moral basis of the Elizabethan polity.<br>
<br>In 1605 Day sought leave to study divinity in France, presumably at the new Calvinist academy of Saumur or a similar establishment. On his return, either in college or at St Mary's, Oxford, the college vicarage where he was admitted on 3 December 1609, he aimed to instil a moderate Calvinism in sermons or addresses, frequently refuting Catholic apologists, which were successively printed at the university press. His two English sermons of 1609 expounded the <span class="roman">Bible</span> with broad classical and theological learning of a traditional kind. In 1611 he proceeded BD. His Latin address to the heads of houses and doctors of divinity, in 1612, evoked Oxford's academic past and contribution to the commonweal. His twelve sermons in St Mary's on God, the sacraments, and the public virtues (1610&#150;15), published as <span class="italic">Day's Festivals</span> (1615), were a plain exposition of protestant teaching for a lay congregation, but his best known work, <span class="italic">Day's Dyall</span> (1614), was like his Aristotelian course delivered to the undergraduates of Oriel in 1612/13, to encourage &#145;proficiency in both learnings, secular, and celestiall&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 413), and abounds with references to classical and theological texts from the fathers onwards. His last work was a <span class="italic">Descant</span> on the first eight psalms, a moral exposition published in 1620. Taken together, they support Wood's description of him as &#145;well vers'd in the Fathers, schoolmen, and councils&#146;, and as &#145;a plain man, a primitive Christian, and &hellip; wholly composed to do good&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 413).<br>
<br>In 1618, on the death of Provost Anthony Blencowe, Day was an unsuccessful (and absent) candidate for the provostship of Oriel and afterwards challenged the election result before the visitor, but in vain. At the next election, in 1621, he was present and again a candidate, and was once more not elected, whereupon he resigned the living of St Mary's and was preferred in 1622 to that of Little Thurlow, Suffolk, by Sir William Soame, &#145;not without some discontent at the loss of the said provostship&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 413). He died at Little Thurlow on 10 January 1628 and was buried there; his brother Lionel's memorial to him, with Latin verses, is in the chancel of Little Thurlow church. Day gave a silver beaker to Oriel on his election, which does not survive, and a book of commentaries on Cicero's orations to the college library.<br>
