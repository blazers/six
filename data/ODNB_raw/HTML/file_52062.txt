<span class="headword">Tunnard,  John Samuel</span>  (1900&#150;1971), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 7 May 1900 at Caesar's Camp, Sandy, Bedfordshire, the son of John Charles Tunnard (1873&#150;1960), landowner and sporting artist, and Nina Isabel Christian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Long (<i>d</i>. 1950). He was educated at Horton School, Ickwellbury, Bedfordshire, and then at Charterhouse, Surrey (1913&#150;18), where he won the Struan Robertson prize two summers in succession. From 1919 he attended the Royal College of Art in London, where he studied design until 1923. As a student he was the drummer in a four-piece dance band, and his enthusiasm for jazz and dance music lasted all his life. In 1924 he became a textile designer for Tootal, Broadhurst, Lee &amp; Co., and left in 1927 to be art adviser to H. and M. Southwell, carpet manufacturers; in 1929&#150;30 he was a selector for the John Lewis partnership. On 11 September 1926 he married a fellow student at the Royal College of Art, Mary May (Bob) Robertson (1901/2&#150;1970), daughter of Peter Robertson; they had no children. In 1929 he taught design at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London, having begun to paint seriously in the previous year.<br>
<br>Tunnard showed three pictures at the Royal Academy for the first time in 1931, and one with the London group, which he joined in 1934 and where he exhibited regularly. In 1932 he had his first major exhibition (shared with Vere Temple) of landscapes, marines, and still lifes at the Redfern Gallery. In 1933 the Tunnards moved to Cadgwith, Cornwall, at first living in a Gypsy caravan and then in a cottage, where they started making hand-blocked printed silks. They also travelled abroad for the first time that year, visiting the Balearic Islands, and from this period date Tunnard's first abstractions and works influenced by the art of Mir&oacute; and Klee; in 1936 his wife gave him a copy of Herbert Read's <span class="italic">Surrealism</span>, and he became on friendly terms with Julian Trevelyan and Henry Moore. Other close friendships were with John Betjeman and Humphrey Spender. From that time on Tunnard's work responded to the joint impulses of surrealism and constructivism, his strongly textured compositions, even when highly abstracted, usually evoking natural forms, space, and the sea. They are distinguished by strong, swinging, rhythmical lines and by curved elements which interpenetrate and melt into one another. In some respects his work has affinities with the engravings of his contemporaries Stanley Hayter and John Buckland-Wright. His colours are usually close in tone and harmonious. Later in life he was in part inspired by the exploration of outer space. He exhibited frequently all his life, and had a notable one-man show at Guggenheim Jeune in London in 1939. In the 1950s and 1960s he exhibited at the McRoberts and Tunnard Gallery, London, run in partnership by his cousin Peter. Many museums in Britain and abroad possess examples of his work: Leeds City Art Gallery, for example, has his superb <span class="italic">Davy Jones' Locker</span> (1940), with its evocation of a sea bed populated with fantastic shapes; the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York includes <span class="italic">Fugue</span> (1938), which has characteristically clear, sharp, geometric lines and a perfect circle inscribed on a field of floating organic shapes, some flatly painted, some textured; the Tate collection holds six works and an example of <span class="italic">Holiday</span> (1947), a lithograph he executed for the School Prints scheme.<br>
<br>In Cornwall, Tunnard became an auxiliary coastguard and, for a period in 1939, a fisherman, making crab pots. Although he caught fish, he detested hunting, and his relationship with his father broke down over his opposition to blood sports. As a conscientious objector he avoided directly helping the war effort during the Second World War (though he wrote an article for <span class="italic">Picture Post</span>, published in December 1940, about his life and look-out duties as a coastguard) but continued to paint prolifically. Often short of money at this period, from 1945 until 1965 he taught at the Penzance School of Art. He was commissioned by the Arts Council in 1951 to contribute a major painting, <span class="italic">The Return</span>, to the exhibition &#145;Sixty paintings for 51&#146;, and he also painted a large mural for the Regatta restaurant at the Festival of Britain. He inherited some money at the death of his mother in 1950 and bought a fair-sized house, Trethinick, in Lamorna, Cornwall, where at lively, alcoholic parties he would perform a top hat and cane routine for his guests. He was remembered by his friends as a buoyant, easy-going person, though to some people he could be reclusive and unwilling to be friendly, however; he ignored invitations to join the Penwith Society, but joined and supported the Newlyn Society of Artists.<br>
<br>Tunnard began to exhibit at the Royal Academy again in 1960, and in 1967 was elected an ARA. He loved bird-watching, and his interest in entomology led him to collect rare specimens of seaweed and insects for the British Museum. As can be seen in his <span class="italic">Self-Portrait</span> (1959, National Portrait Gallery, London), he wore spectacles, and he had a long face with deeply grooved cheeks, a thin nose and mouth, and receding hair. John Tunnard died on 18 December 1971 in Penzance and was buried alongside his wife in the churchyard in Zennor.<br>
