<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pippard, Sir  (Alfred) Brian</span>  (1920&#150;2008), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born at 41a Penywern Road, Earl's Court, London, on 7 September 1920, the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35532/', "(Alfred John) Sutton Pippard (1891&#150;1969)")</script>, civil and aeronautical engineer, and his wife, (Frances Louisa) Olive, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Field (1892&#150;1964). His father was professor of civil engineering at Bristol University from 1928 to 1933 (he was later professor of civil engineering at Imperial College, London, from 1933 to 1956, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1954). It was in the Bristol area that Pippard received his schooling. After junior school at Westbourne House, Penarth, from 1925 to 1928 and Bristol grammar school until 1930, he attended Clifton College preparatory school. He was then awarded an entrance scholarship to Clifton College, which he attended from 1934 to 1938.<br>
<br>Pippard had begun learning the piano at the age of five and became an excellent pianist, a passion which remained with him all his life. His teacher at Clifton, Douglas Fox, seriously suggested that he should consider a career in music but he realized his own limitations as a pianist and musician when compared with his contemporary at Clifton, David Willcocks. He thoroughly enjoyed physics and chemistry at school but believed he could not compete with the best students in mathematics. Rumour had it that mastering the new physics of quantum mechanics demanded high mathematical ability and so he considered physical chemistry a more appropriate career choice. He won a minor entrance scholarship to Clare College, Cambridge, and in his first year read physics, chemistry, physiology and mathematics with outstanding academic success. The Second World War broke out in his second year and his tutor informed him that the country did not need chemists but that there was a demand for physicists. Pippard soon found that physics was indeed what he had always wanted to do. In 1941 he graduated with first-class honours in part two of the natural sciences tripos.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1941 Pippard was interviewed by C. P. Snow to judge his suitability for research in support of the war effort and was assigned to work on radar. The four-year period during which he was employed as a scientific officer at the Radar Research and Development Establishment (from 1941 to 1945) was devoted to mastering and developing microwave radar techniques. Magnetrons and klystrons provided powerful new sources of microwave radiation which, combined with parabolic antennae, provided higher angular resolution than the existing radar arrays, which operated at much longer wavelengths. Pippard made numerous contributions to the development of radar techniques. These four years of war work provided an ideal training in research techniques. Specifically, he developed the discipline of carrying out experimental work with economy and imagination.<br>
<br>The immediate postwar years provided many opportunities for innovative research. Basic physics had been on hold for six years while a vast array of new experimental capabilities had become available. In 1945 Pippard was awarded a Stokes studentship at Pembroke College and became a member of the Royal Society Mond laboratory, which was the centre of low temperature physics research in Cambridge. He was already familiar with the skin effect, the restriction of microwave fields to a thin surface layer when radio waves are incident on a metallic surface, and began investigations into this phenomenon in superconducting metals (materials which lose all electrical resistance below a transition temperature close to absolute zero). He built microwave resonant circuits of superconducting materials such as tin and mercury and successfully observed a dramatic reduction in microwave absorption when the materials were cooled through their transition temperatures.<br>
<br>Pippard's doctoral work contained the seeds of two further developments. First, he noticed that he could obtain an unambiguous value for the complex conductivity of his samples. Second, he reaffirmed Heinz London's observation in 1940 that in normal metals the surface resistance did not continue to decrease with falling temperature as the direct current resistance did, but reached a limit. Pippard developed a theory of this &#145;anomalous skin effect&#146; using a simplified model in which he regarded as &#145;effective&#146; only those electrons moving at such a small angle to the surface that they remained within the skin depth between scatterings. To develop the theory further, he found he had inadequate mathematical tools and so sought help from Ernst Sondheimer, who formulated the problem more precisely using three-dimensional Fermi statistics and the Boltzmann equation. With the assistance of G. E. H. Reuter, these equations were solved and the full theory of the anomalous skin effect was published, fitting all Pippard's data remarkably closely. An important feature of this work was the understanding that the anomalous skin effect was a &#145;non-local effect&#146;: the current depended not only on the electric field at a particular point, but also on the field at neighbouring points through which the electrons had travelled since last being scattered.<br>
<br>In 1947 Pippard was appointed a university demonstrator, and returned to Clare College as a research fellow and director of studies in physics. After his doctorate (in 1949) he became interested in the geometry and dynamics of normal&#150;superconducting boundaries, and introduced the idea that their stability was determined by whether the magnetic penetration depth was larger or smaller than a characteristic &#145;coherence length&#146;, which, like the penetration depth, diverged at the transition temperature. A phenomenological theory of superconductivity was proposed by Lev Landau and Vitaly Ginzburg in 1950 and, unknown to Pippard, their theory also contained a coherence length. They had come to similar conclusions about the normal&#150;superconducting interface energy. At about the same time, Pippard (who was appointed a university lecturer in Cambridge in 1950) made two significant new observations on the penetration depth. First, he measured the skin depth of tin alloyed with indium to reduce the electron free path. The alloying not only increased the normal state skin depth as expected, but also increased the superconducting penetration depth. Second, he measured the anisotropy of the penetration depth in pure tin, and found that it varied with surface orientation in a manner that was in conflict with Heinz London's equations of superconductivity, but was very similar in form to the anisotropy of the normal state skin depth, governed by Chambers's non-local equation.<br>
<br>Pippard drew the bold conclusion that non-local effects were being observed in the supercurrent, and in a celebrated paper of 1953 proposed that the local London relation should be replaced by a non-local equation analogous to Chamber's formula. He solved the penetration depth analysis exactly, the new theory fitting the data remarkably well. In early 1957 Pippard made a short visit to Moscow with a delegation of British scientists, where he encountered Landau, Ginzburg, and Alexey Alexeyevich Abrikosov. Landau strongly rejected Pippard's proposal, partly because the Ginzburg&#150;Landau theory led to no non-locality of the supercurrent. Later that year, John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John R. Schrieffer published their revolutionary pairing theory of superconductivity and in it they were at pains to demonstrate that their new theory confirmed Pippard's model almost exactly, the coherence length being interpreted as the scale over which pairs of electrons are correlated. The Moscow theorists generously sent Pippard a private message conceding that he had been right; indeed they regarded his brilliant insights as of Nobel prize standing.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Pippard's interests had shifted to the Fermi surface, a theoretical three-dimensional boundary in momentum space within which the conduction electrons of a metal were thought to be contained at absolute zero. In 1952 Onsager had interpreted the de Haas&#150;van Alphen effect, the oscillations of the magnetization of metals with applied magnetic field, in terms of the Fermi surface. The shape of this surface determines many of the properties of the metal but there was no experimental determination of its shape for any metal. In 1954 Pippard first showed that in the extreme anomalous limit the surface resistance provides a measure of one component of the curvature of the Fermi surface. By making sufficient observations of the surface resistance in different orientations, the geometry of the Fermi surface in a fairly simple case, such as that of copper, could be determined. He planned to carry out these experiments during the sabbatical year he was about to take in Chicago. In the meantime, through his musical connections, he had met Charlotte Frances Dyer, who was studying calligraphy at the art college. Two years his junior, she was the daughter of Francis Gilbert Dyer, a professional musician. They were married at St Edward's Church, Cambridge, on 2 July 1955, and had three daughters, Corinna (<i>b</i>. 1957), Deborah (<i>b</i>. 1960), and Eleanor (<i>b</i>. 1962).<br>
<br>After their marriage Brian and Charlotte Pippard left almost immediately for Chicago. Morrel Cohen had arranged for the Institute for the Study of Materials to grow a very large single crystal of copper. The data were taken successfully and Pippard was able to map out the Fermi surface of copper, a widely recognized tour de force. This was the first time any Fermi surface had been measured experimentally. Pippard was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1956, the same year as his return to Cambridge. In 1959 he became a university reader and was awarded the Royal Society's Hughes medal. He was appointed John Humphrey Plummer professor of physics in 1960. Among his first programmes was the development of a magnet laboratory which provided the physicists with very strong steady magnetic fields. The complex subject of magnetoresistance remained a major preoccupation, culminating in his definitive text, <span class="italic">Magnetoresistance in Metals</span> (1989). In 1961 his graduate student Brian Josephson developed a new theory of quantum tunnelling between superconductors which subsequently earned him a Nobel prize for physics.<br>
<br>From 1966 to 1973 Pippard was the first president of the newly founded college, Clare Hall, which offered hospitality to distinguished academic visitors and their families in Cambridge. He was responsible for overseeing the design of the college by the architect Ralph Erskine. He succeeded in making the college an informal and happy home for graduates, visitors, and their families. His humanitarian instincts came to the fore when the college provided a home for Rudi Dutschke, a left-wing German student activist who had been shot by a maverick right-winger after a campaign against him in the German press.<br>
<br>During the late 1950s Neville Mott had become convinced of the need to move the Cavendish Laboratory to new buildings in west Cambridge, and Pippard quickly became the protagonist in promoting this enterprise. He was deeply involved in all aspects of the planning of the new buildings and successfully oversaw the move of the Cavendish to the new site. In 1971 he was elected Cavendish professor of experimental physics. He was president of the Institute of Physics from 1974 to 1976 and knighted in 1974. During his tenure as head of the physics department, he took a strong interest in the teaching programme. The role of the teaching committee was strengthened and he was proactive in the reform of undergraduate physics teaching. There were some subjects that he abhorred&#151;four-vectors, operator formalism, and the grand canonical ensemble, to mention but a few. His horror was of mathematical formalism that obscured what he considered to be the underlying physics content.<br>
<br>When the University of Cambridge offered a generous early retirement package in 1982, Pippard took that opportunity. In retirement, he maintained an active interest in the areas of physics he found absorbing. He investigated in considerable detail the perturbations of the Foucault pendulum and designed and had built a drive and mount that eliminated many of them. His parametrically driven Foucault pendulum was displayed in the Science Museum, London. His books <span class="italic">The Physics of Vibrations</span>, vol. 2 (1983; he had published a first volume in 1978) and <span class="italic">Response and Stability</span> (1985) were published during this period. A major undertaking was his editorship of the three-volume work <span class="italic">Twentieth-Century Physics</span> (1995).<br>
<br>Brian Pippard was a brilliant experimental physicist who made numerous pioneering contributions to condensed matter physics. The particular achievements for which he will be remembered were the first determination of the Fermi surface and his non-local theories of electrical conduction in metals and superconductors. He was capable of great kindness and he was always intellectually stimulating. But he also had an enormous boyish relish in simply being clever. In April 1994 he suffered a serious accident when he was knocked off his bicycle after a walk with his wife at Wandlebury county park. He suffered a mildly fractured skull and a broken shoulder, as well as losing the sight of his left eye. Nevertheless he made an excellent recovery and was soon back playing the piano. He died of a stroke at the Hope Residential and Nursing Care Home, Cambridge, on 21 September 2008, and was survived by his wife, Charlotte, and their three daughters.<br>
