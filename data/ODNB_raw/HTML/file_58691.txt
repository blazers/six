<span class="headword">Linnaeus,  Carl</span> <span class="st"> [<em>later </em>Carl  von Linn&eacute;]</span>  (1707&#150;1778), <span class="occ">naturalist and taxonomist</span>, was born on 23 May 1707 <span class="smallcap">NS</span> (13 May <span class="smallcap">OS</span>) in a turf-roofed homestead at R&aring;sult, near Stenbrohult, in the province of Sm&aring;land in southern Sweden, the eldest of five children of the pastor, Nils Nicolaus Linnaeus (1674&#150;1748), and his wife, Christina Broderzonia (1688&#150;1733). After schooling at V&auml;xj&ouml;, a nearby town, he began medical studies at the University of Lund, transferring in August 1728 to Uppsala University. Befriended by the theologian and naturalist Olof Celsius (1670&#150;1756), who appointed him demonstrator in botany in 1730, he travelled to &#145;Lappland&#146;, as it was then known, in summer 1732, reporting to the Vetenskapsakademien (Swedish Royal Society of Sciences) on its natural history and economy. In 1734 he met his future wife, Sara Elisabeth Moraea (1716&#150;1806), daughter of Johan Moraeus, the town physician of Falun, and Elizabeth Hausdotter; they were engaged in January 1735 with an agreement to delay marriage for three years.<br>
<br>Linnaeus left Sweden for the Netherlands in April 1735, travelling via Hamburg to Harderwijk, a Dutch university town specializing in issuing &#145;instant&#146; degrees. He registered as a student on 18 June and gained his medical doctorate on 23 June within a week of his arrival. He then moved to Leiden and met and impressed the medical doctor and botanist Johan Gronovius (1690&#150;1760). Gronovius and Isaac Lawson, a young Scottish doctor, agreed to fund the printing of Linnaeus's first published work, the <span class="italic">Systema naturae</span> of 1735, which classified the three kingdoms of nature and outlined the sexual system for the classification of plants. Gronovius was also instrumental in introducing Linnaeus to the wealthy but hypochondriac Anglo-Dutch financier and director of the Dutch East India Company, George Clifford (1685&#150;1760), owner of a magnificent garden at Hartecamp, suggesting that he employ Linnaeus as house physician and garden superintendent. Linnaeus moved to Hartecamp in September with a salary of 1000 florins a year and free board and lodging. His own and contemporary accounts give a picture of a methodical and sensual observer of nature &#145;little, flurried, rushed, nimble&#146;  (Linnaeus, 97) and Lindroth concludes that his success in the Netherlands was due to &#145;his personal attractiveness, his capacity for captivating grizzled authorities&#146;  (Fr&auml;ngsmyr, 54).<br>
<br>After almost a year in Clifford's employment Linnaeus travelled to England, arriving at the end of July 1736 and returning to the Netherlands in late August. His <span class="italic">Systema naturae</span> of 1735 had been sent ahead by Gronovius and Lawson to Sir Hans Sloane, president of the Royal Society. Despite a fulsome letter of introduction he met with a cool reception from Sloane, although he was shown Sloane's museum. He also met Philip Miller, superintendent of the Society of Apothecaries' garden at Chelsea. Both were unhappy initially about Linnaeus's new system of classification but Miller was won over by Linnaeus's botanical knowledge and was then generous with plants for Clifford. Other London acquaintances included the Quaker naturalist and merchant Peter Collinson, whom he visited and with whom he maintained a lifelong correspondence. He travelled to Oxford to meet the Sherardian professor of botany, Johan Jakob Dillenius, who initially disagreed with him, also giving him a cold reception. This changed just as Linnaeus was about to return to London when, after discussing what Dillenius had marked as errors in advance pages of <span class="italic">Genera plantarum</span> (which was not published until the following year), it was demonstrated by dissection of plants that Linnaeus was correct. They remained lifelong friends and correspondents, Dillenius telling him to &#145;write as one friend ought to address another&#146;  (Smith, 2.107). Linnaeus also records meeting John Martyn, professor of botany at Cambridge, and Georg Ehret, whom he knew from the Netherlands. The majority of the forty-plus British correspondents of Linnaeus first wrote to him later on, when he had established his reputation.<br>
<br>These contacts were important as being among the earliest to promote both Linnaeus's binomial nomenclature for living organisms and to publish floras using his sexual system for the classification of plants. The rules for this were explained in Linnaeus's <span class="italic">Fundamenta botanica</span> (1736) and expounded in his <span class="italic">Classes plantarum</span> of 1738, based on the tabular key published in the <span class="italic">Systema naturae</span> of 1735. This system used the flower and the number and arrangements of its sexual organs of stamens and pistils to group plants into twenty-four classes, which in turn are divided into orders, genera, and species. Amateur botanists and gardeners in England, such as Peter Collinson and John Ellis, were quick to adopt his methods. The binomial system that Linnaeus used for genus and species names supplied short names ideal for quick reference. The accompanying diagnostic phrase names give the fuller description of the plant. Among the earliest to use Linnaean concepts in a published work were the naturalist and apothecary John Hill, who described the system in his publications as early as 1751, and the Irish naturalist Patrick Browne, who used phrase names in his <span class="italic">Civic and Natural History of Jamaica</span> of 1756. The apothecary William Hudson published his <span class="italic">Flora Anglica</span> in 1762, one of the first floras to use the binomial system, and its acceptance in British circles was shown when Philip Miller adopted it in the eighth edition of his <span class="italic">Gardener's Dictionary</span> of 1768. Its adoption became widespread in Britain and its overseas colonies, and was reinforced when Sir Joseph Banks employed one of Linnaeus's pupils, Daniel Solander, as his curator and librarian. These British contacts formed the start of what later became the almost universal acceptance of the Linnaean system, and were further reinforced in the 1780s when Linnaeus's botanical collections, purchased by J. E. Smith, went to Britain and the Linnean Society of London was founded. Linnaeus himself was elected to the Royal Society of London in 1753.<br>
<br>Returning to the Netherlands, Linnaeus took back new plants for Clifford's garden and remained in Clifford's employment until autumn 1738; using Dutch printing facilities he published in 1737 <span class="italic">Genera plantarum</span>, <span class="italic">Flora Lapponica</span>, <span class="italic">Critica botanica</span>, and <span class="italic">Hortus Cliffortianus</span>. A brief visit to Paris was followed by his return to Sweden in the autumn of 1738, to establish a medical practice in Stockholm.<br>
<br>Practical advice on treatment of venereal disease from a French medical doctor helped to establish Linnaeus's reputation and, through a successful prescription for a friend of the queen and contact with Count Carl Tessin (1695&#150;1770), leader of the ruling Hat party, he was appointed physician to the admiralty, also becoming first president of the newly established Academy of Science of Stockholm. His long-awaited marriage to Sara Lisa Moraea took place on 26 June 1739 and in January 1741, a son, Carl, was born. Later that year the medical professorship at Uppsala University was offered to Linnaeus, and in making the move he was able to arrange to exchange positions with E. Ros&eacute;n (1714&#150;1796), botanical professor and a rival of long standing, each then teaching the subjects best suited to him. Linnaeus took charge of the botanical garden and revived it, adding a small menagerie. He was an incomparable academic teacher, inspiring his disciples, and his lectures were often crowded.<br>
<br>In 1744 Linnaeus wrote in his autobiography that he had achieved his desires. He continued to publish prolifically but increasingly suffered from brooding despair, despite the increasing international fame which followed publication of the <span class="italic">Species plantarum</span> of 1753, now recognized as the starting point of modern botanical nomenclature, and the tenth edition in 1758 of the <span class="italic">Systema naturae</span>, which is the equivalent for zoological nomenclature. Today's international codes which govern the use of scientific names for all living organisms recognize Linnaeus as the starting point of modern taxonomy: about 12,000 of these names have the abbreviation &#145;L&#146; appended to them, indicating their origin in a published Linnaean description.<br>
<br>An increasing family included four surviving daughters (a daughter and a son dying in infancy). In 1758 Linnaeus bought a country estate at Hammarby, and was made a knight of the Polar Star; further honours followed in 1761 when he was ennobled, taking the title Carl von Linn&eacute; in 1762. At this time he arranged to hand over his teaching duties to his son, Carl von Linn&eacute; the younger (1741&#150;1783), for reasons of ill health; he continued to live mostly at Hammarby, where he built a museum to hold his collections safe from fire. In his last years his health declined, after he suffered two strokes. He died on 10 January 1778 in Uppsala from an ulcerated bladder. His funeral and burial were at Uppsala Cathedral on 22 January 1778.<br>
