<span class="headword">MacBride,  John Alexander Patterson</span>  (1819&#150;1890), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born in February 1819 at Campbeltown, Argyll, the son of Archibald MacBride. &#145;His mother was a McKenzie, and his grandmother a McKinnon&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Graphic</span>). He was trained as a sculptor at Liverpool in the studio of William Spence and also studied drawing at the Liverpool Art School with fellow students Richard Ansdell and Samuel Huggins. At the same time he studied anatomy at the Liverpool medical school under the eminent surgeons James Long and Alfred Higginson. In 1841, on the completion of his time with Spence, MacBride moved to London where he continued his studies at the British Museum. In 1844 his life-size group <span class="italic">Margaret of Anjou and her Son</span> was highly commended in the first sculpture contest at Westminster Hall. This work received mixed reviews. The <span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span> considered Margaret &#145;a virago&#146; and her son &#145;a poor attenuated, impudent lad&#146;  (Gunnis, 247) but the work so impressed one of the judges, Samuel Joseph, that he took MacBride into his studio without charging his usual fee of 500 guineas. In Joseph's studio MacBride was a &#145;premier pupil&#146;; he was appointed studio manager and became Joseph's chief assistant. After Joseph's bankruptcy MacBride returned to Liverpool and by 1848 was an associate of the Liverpool Academy. He became a full member in 1850. MacBride was an enthusiastic supporter of the Pre-Raphaelites and as secretary of the Liverpool Academy in 1851 and 1852 was instrumental in these years in awarding the annual prize of 50 guineas to Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais.<br>
<br>After establishing himself in Liverpool MacBride continued to exhibit at the Royal Academy between 1848 and 1853 but his principal source of patronage was the area in which he spent most of his working life, the city of Liverpool and its environs. MacBride was most commonly sought to execute the standard form of nineteenth-century sculpted memorial, the marble classicizing bust. Notable examples are <span class="italic">Sir William Brown (Bart)</span> for St George's Hall; the <span class="italic">Revd Dr T. S. Raffles</span> (exh. Liverpool Academy, 1865) for the Great George Street Chapel, Liverpool; his friend the author <span class="italic">Philip James Bailey</span> (Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh); <span class="italic">John Laird</span> (1863) for Birkenhead Hospital; <span class="italic">Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Thomson</span> (mayor of Liverpool) (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool); and <span class="italic">General Lord Viscount Combermere</span> (1853). MacBride carved the statue of Sir Hugh Myddelton for the Royal Exchange, London; statues of <span class="italic">The Four Seasons</span> for Garswood Hall, Lancashire, for Sir John Gerrard; and a statue of the Wesleyan minister Dr Adam Clarke for Portrush, co. Antrim. For St Mary's Church, Birkenhead, he carved the tablet in memory of Dr Stevenson (1854). This was noted by Timothy Stevens to be &#145;an outstanding example&#146; of the nineteenth-century practice of illustrating the occupation of the departed on a monument, and &#145;represents Stevenson, the first medical man to settle in Birkenhead, holding a watch and feeling the pulse of a patient&#146;  (Stevens, 48). The monument is now in the Oratory, St James's cemetery, Liverpool. For reproduction by Messrs Minton of Stoke-on-Trent he modelled statuettes of Lord Clyde, Lord Havelock, Prince Albert, H. M. Stanley (his last work), and a reduced-size version of his <span class="italic">Margaret of Anjou</span> group. Models of his <span class="italic">Lady Godiva</span> were awarded by the Liverpool Art Union as one of their prizes in 1850. He lobbied for the commission for a statue to commemorate the duke of Wellington to surmount the Liverpool Column, but this went instead to the sculptor George Lawson, whose brother Andrew designed the column (1862&#150;3).<br>
<br>MacBride was also sought after as an art critic and lecturer: he delivered courses on sculpture at the British Museum, at the Crystal Palace, and for the corporations of Liverpool, Bradford, and Greenock, among others. About 1883 he moved to London and then, in deteriorating health, to Southend-on-Sea, where he died on 4 April 1890.<br>
