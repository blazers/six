<span class="headword">Brock,  Alan Francis  Clutton-</span>  (1904&#150;1976), <span class="occ">art critic</span>, was born in Weybridge, Surrey, on 8 October 1904, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32459/', "Arthur Clutton-Brock (1868&#150;1924)")</script> and his wife, Evelyn Alice Vernon-Harcourt. His father was a barrister who forsook law to write on art and literature, regularly contributing articles to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, a path his son was to follow; his mother was an artist. His parents moved to Farncombe Lodge, Godalming, Surrey, and later they resided at the Red House, Godalming, a fine early Edwin Lutyens house. Clutton-Brock entered Eton College as a king's scholar in April 1919, and left in summer 1923 after winning a Fielder exhibition to King's College, Cambridge. At Eton he won several prizes for art and English verse, becoming a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the classicist Andrew Gow, who encouraged his interest in painting; they met again at Cambridge, when Gow became a fellow and tutor at Trinity College in 1925. Clutton-Brock abandoned classics for the English tripos, in which he achieved a first in 1926. He proceeded MA in 1956. He painted pastiches of the Italian masters from the trecento to Titian on the large panels in the set occupied by a fellow (Richard Braithwaite) in the Gibbs building (later obliterated), and affected bohemian habits such as that of drinking brandy for &#145;elevenses&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1927 Clutton-Brock married Shelagh Archer, whom he had met as a Newnham College undergraduate, and they settled in London, where they lived &#145;among beautiful objects and chaos overlaid with dust and cobwebs&#146;  (King's College annual report). Shelagh died in a road accident in 1936, leaving him with a daughter and a son; the son died of polio in South Africa during the Second World War.<br>
<br>Although Clutton-Brock studied for a while at Westminster School of Art (<i>c</i>.1926/7) and exhibited at the London Group, also holding some one-man shows, his charming oil landscapes, much influenced by Constable and French impressionism, did not establish his reputation; but he soon made his mark as a writer on joining <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1930 and contributing to the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>. Widely read and gifted, he produced prose that was always elegant and finely turned. He published a few popular books: <span class="italic">Italian Painting</span> (1930), <span class="italic">Introduction to French Painting</span> (1932), and a short life of William Blake (1933); a detective novel, <span class="italic">Murder at Liberty Hall</span> (1941); and for R. H. Wilenski's <span class="roman">Faber Library</span>, jointly with Adrian Stokes, <span class="italic">C&eacute;zanne</span> (2 vols.) in 1947&#150;55.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Clutton-Brock served in intelligence with the Royal Air Force volunteer reserve Bomber Command. He had married again in 1936; his second wife was Barbara Foy Mitchell, with whom he had another daughter, and they lived for a while at Hadleigh, Suffolk. He became art critic of <span class="italic">The Times</span> in winter 1945, remaining there until 1955, the year he was elected for three years as Slade professor of fine art at Cambridge. He also served as a trustee of the National Gallery. On the death of a cousin, Mrs Whitmore-Jones, in 1955, he inherited Chastleton House, Oxfordshire, a fine but plain early seventeenth-century manor house, where the Clutton-Brocks were hospitable and lived well but in some domestic disorder.<br>
<br>As befitted a Cambridge man, Clutton-Brock was greatly influenced by Roger Fry, a family friend, and his lucid introduction to the exhibition catalogue for the Duncan Grant retrospective, held at the Tate Gallery in 1959, reflects both his allegiances and his critical objectivity. Witty and charming, Clutton-Brock could be trenchant:<blockquote>The story of its [the &#145;Post-Impressionist Exhibition&#146; of 1910] reception has often been told, but it is still impossible to read any account of the indignation it provoked without being startled, more especially by the ferocity of cultivated and experienced critics who might have been expected to view these pictures with the indulgence they had been trained to give to the crudities of Cimabue. (Introduction, <span class="italic">Duncan Grant</span>, 1959)</blockquote>In 1975 he suffered the first of two strokes which led to his death on 18 December 1976 at Chastleton House. He was buried on 22 December, probably at St Mary's, Chastleton.<br>
