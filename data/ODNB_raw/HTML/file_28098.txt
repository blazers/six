<span class="headword">Nost,  John  van, the younger</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1780), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born in Piccadilly, London, the son of John van Nost (<i>d</i>. 1729), also a sculptor, who was a cousin of the well-known Dutch sculptor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69041/', "John Nost (d. 1710)")</script>, who settled in London. John van Nost the younger, who had been apprenticed to Henry Scheemakers in 1726, arrived in Dublin around 1749 and quickly established a successful practice. Mrs Delany visited his studio in March 1752, and noted that he &#145;takes as strong a likeness as ever I saw taken in marble&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 275). From 1750 onwards van Nost served as an instructor in the modelling classes at the Dublin Society Schools and took on apprentices, including John Crawley and Patrick Cunningham. John O'Keeffe, who later became a successful actor and playwright, entered the School of Figure Drawing around 1753 and remembered that &#145;Van Nost, the celebrated statuary, often came amongst us&#146;  (O'Keeffe, 16). Van Nost's own sister is recorded as having won a prize at the Dublin Society Schools for a bust in clay of the prince of Wales in February 1754.<br>
<br>Among the first works van Nost produced in Dublin were a statue of George II, placed in an arched niche over the door of the Weaver's Hall in the Coombe, and busts of Thomas Prior and Samuel Madden for the Dublin Society. In 1752 he was asked to produce a monument to Thomas Prior (now in Christ Church Cathedral), and he was enlisted to design a monument to Dean Swift in Trinity College, Dublin, though that project was not carried out. Dr Bartholomew Mosse appointed van Nost to create a number of portrait busts and classical figures for display in the gardens of the Rotunda Hospital. This commission was not completed either, but the hospital did acquire in 1757 those sculptures which van Nost had finished. Among other important works are busts of Dean Delany, for Trinity College Dublin, and of Henry Boyle, speaker of the Irish House of Commons, for the farmers' club in Munster, as well as two sculptures for the gateway of Dublin Castle. Two statues by van Nost were erected in the city, one in Stephen's Green of George II (1758), and another, of General Blakeney, in Sackville Street (1759). In 1765 the earl of Northumberland commissioned van Nost to produce an idealized statue of King George III as a Roman general (NG Ire.) for the new exchange in Dublin. Van Nost also executed important works for locations in Cork, Longford, and King's county.<br>
<br>When van Nost's residence and studio in Aungier Street were auctioned in November 1759, Cunningham, his former student, was provided with sufficient funds by the Dublin Society to purchase &#145;such molds and models as are useful and necessary for carrying on his Designs in the business of a Statuary&#146;  (Turpin, <span class="italic">A School of Art</span>, 54). These may well have included busts in varnished plaster of Seneca, Aristotle, Galen, and Horace, which Mrs Delany says van Nost ordered for his library in 1752. By 1763 van Nost was living in the garden of the Rt Hon. Anthony Malone, on the east side of Stephen's Green, and in 1779 at 21 Mecklenburgh Street. In 1777 he went to London, where he was forced by poor health to stay for four years. On his return to Dublin he moved back to Mecklenburgh Street, where, according to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>  (50, 1780, 494), he died in 1780.<br>
<br>Van Nost, the only significant sculptor at work in Ireland in the mid-eighteenth century, prospered in the capital. Described by a committee of the corporation of Dublin in 1752 as &#145;the most knowing and skilfull statuary in this Kingdom&#146;  (Strickland, 480), he drew on a Netherlandish style for his figures but was also influenced by Italianate idealization, and he shared the English and Irish penchant for classicism.<br>
