<span class="headword">Taylor,  Robert</span>  (1784&#150;1844), <span class="occ">deist</span>, the sixth son of John Taylor (<i>d</i>. 1791), ironmonger, and his wife and cousin, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Elizabeth Jasper, was born at Walnut Tree House, Edmonton, Middlesex, on 18 August 1784. Following his father's death, he was placed in the guardianship of his uncle, Edward Farmer Taylor of Chicken Hall, Bridgnorth, Shropshire. He attended the Revd Morgan Davis's boarding-school at Edmonton, and in 1801 he was articled to Samuel Partridge, then house surgeon at Birmingham General Hospital. He underwent a conversion experience in Birmingham, having heard the Calvinist preacher Edward Burn. In 1805 he walked Guy's and St Thomas's hospitals under Sir Astley Paston Cooper and Henry Cline; he was admitted an MRCS in 1807.<br>
<br>The influence of Thomas Cotterill, perpetual curate of Lane End, Staffordshire, led Taylor to study for the church, and in October 1809 he matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, as Queen Margaret's foundation scholar. He came under the influence of Charles Simeon, the evangelical preacher, who, following Taylor's graduation and ordination in 1813, secured for him the position of curate-in-charge at Midhurst, Sussex. He preached his first sermon on the day of his ordination to the diaconate, 14 March 1813, at St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street, London. Ordained priest in October, he remained at Midhurst until the summer of 1818, holding also the neighbouring perpetual curacy of Easebourne. A Midhurst tradesman gave him the use of his library, and, from reading Gibbon, Paine, and Voltaire, sceptical doubts were raised in Taylor's mind. He announced his conversion to deism in January 1818, and resigned his curacy the following July after preaching a contentious sermon on Jonah. He recanted in December, placing an advertisement in <span class="italic">The Times</span> on 11 December in which he ascribed his lapse to a mental aberration. He was invited by George Gaskin, rector of Stoke Newington, to officiate at Edmonton, Tottenham, and Newington, but his views (which had not, in fact, changed) made it difficult for him to obtain preferment until a friend gave him the curacy of Yardley, near Birmingham, where he hoped to rehabilitate his clerical reputation. But the bishop of Worcester insisted on his dismissal, and Taylor, under notice to quit, openly preached deism in the parish church.<br>
<br>Taylor's brothers offered him a monthly allowance on condition that he leave England. He went to the Isle of Man; when his allowance was stopped, he wrote for local newspapers. An article justifying suicide brought him before the bishop, George Murray. Making off to Whitehaven, he got &pound;10 from his old master, Partridge, and sailed for Dublin, where he became assistant master in Jones's school in Nutgrove; he also assisted the rector of Rathfarnham, co. Dublin, until his presence was discovered by Archbishop Magee, and he was again dismissed. He began a series of attacks on the church under the title <span class="italic">The Clerical Review</span>, and was noticed by Archibald Hamilton Rowan and Henry Augustus Dillon-Lee, thirteenth Viscount Dillon, under whose auspices he formed in 1824 the Society of Universal Benevolence. He hired the Fishamble Street theatre for Sunday morning lectures, but a riot at the second lecture (28 March 1824) closed the experiment.<br>
<br>Having returned to London, Taylor drew up a petition for permission to preach &#145;natural religion&#146; which was presented to the House of Commons by Joseph Hume on 18 June. He taught classics, formed a Christian Evidence Society, and gave lectures, followed by discussions, at various public rooms. In the summer of 1826 he hired an old independent chapel at Founders' Hall, Lothbury, and conducted (from 30 July) Sunday morning services with a liturgy, unusual for advocating a sitting position during prayer, and more remarkable for directing that no word or phrase was ever to be altered, added, or omitted. Richard Carlile, the radical publisher, whose attention had originally been drawn by Taylor's activities in Dublin, and who was otherwise sympathetic to Taylor, commented that &#145;Such trash as this new liturgy is not instructive, is hypocritical &hellip; and is a disgrace to the pretensions of Mr Taylor and his flock&#146;  (Royle, <span class="italic">Radical Politics</span>). His preaching, none the less, drew large congregations, and their subscriptions enabled him to purchase Salters' Hall Chapel, Cannon Street, London. On 1 January 1827 it was reopened by Taylor as his Areopagus. In the same month he was arrested and indicted for blasphemy. He was sued simultaneously for the recovery of &pound;100, a bill he had accepted from a Bristol man named May, and was imprisoned for debt. He went through the bankruptcy court to obtain his release, and the Salters' Hall Chapel was resold at a loss.<br>
<br>Taylor was tried in full canonicals for blasphemy on 24 October 1827 before Charles Abbott, first Lord Tenterden, and found guilty. (Other charges, of conspiracy to overthrow the Christian religion, were dropped.) He was sentenced to a year's imprisonment in Oakham gaol and to find securities (amounting to &pound;1000 in all) for good behaviour for five years. Richard Carlile raised a subscription for him and published a weekly letter from Taylor in his paper, <span class="italic">The Lion</span>. In Oakham gaol Taylor wrote his <span class="italic">Syntagma of the Evidences of the Christian Religion</span> (1828) and <span class="italic">The Diegesis</span> (1829), his two most important works. On his release in February 1829 he lectured occasionally at Carlile's shop in Fleet Street, and at the Universalist Chapel, Windmill Street, Finsbury Square. In May he and Carlile set out on an &#145;infidel mission&#146; to the midlands and north, challenging ministers to debate. They began their campaign in Cambridge, where Taylor fastened the challenge to the door of the divinity schools. No debate was forthcoming, and the two men moved on through Nottingham to Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Cheshire before returning to London.<br>
<br>In May 1830 Taylor took the Rotunda, Blackfriars Road, London, and preached in episcopal garb to large audiences. His services were theatrical affairs, and his sermons full of &#145;coarse remarks&#146; and &#145;excremental jokes&#146;, which mocked through imitation the rites of the Anglican church: in 1834 he was reported to have drunk gin and water, &#145;which he says is as good as the blood of Jesus Christ&#146;  (McCalman, 203). Two sermons on the devil (6 and 13 June) gained him the title of the Devil's Chaplain from Henry Hunt; the Rotunda became known as the Devil's Pulpit. The latter name was seized on by Taylor for the serial publication of his sermons in 1831. He was tried at the Surrey sessions in July 1831 for preaching blasphemy the previous Easter, found guilty, and sentenced to two years' imprisonment in Horsemonger Lane gaol, a fine of &pound;200, and recognizances for good behaviour as before. Released from prison in 1833, Taylor retired from public view, although he again held infidel services at Theobold's Road Chapel in 1834. In 1833 he married an elderly woman of some property; the marriage was a happy one, but it exposed Taylor to an action for breach of promise of marriage on the part of Georgiana Richards, caretaker at the Rotunda, to whom the jury awarded damages of &pound;250. To escape paying, Taylor and his wife fled to France, where he practised as a surgeon at Tours until his death there on 5 June 1844.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Diegesis</span>, a critical examination of the origins of Christianity through comparative mythology and philology, in which Christianity was expounded as a scheme of solar myths, was described in the nineteenth century as &#145;ill-arranged writings &hellip; of no original or scientific value&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>); a twentieth-century re-evaluation called it &#145;a major contribution to popular English freethought&#146;  (Royle, <span class="italic">BDMBR</span>, 469). Taylor's intellectual influence on Carlile was perhaps his most lasting contribution to freethought.<br>
