<span class="headword">Briscoe,  Arthur John Reginald Trevor</span>  (1873&#150;1943), <span class="occ">engraver and marine artist</span>, was born on 25 February 1873 at Mount Pleasant, Oxton, Birkenhead, Cheshire, the eldest son of John Briscoe (<i>d</i>. 1893), a prominent Liverpool businessman and senior partner in the cotton-broking firm of Briscoe, Fox &amp; Partners, and his wife, Eliza Ann Trevor, whose father was proprietor of the <span class="italic">Chester Chronicle</span>. Educated at Shrewsbury School, Briscoe demonstrated an aptitude for drawing which had been evident from early childhood. After leaving school he accompanied his father on a world tour and on his return announced that he wanted to be an artist. Arrangements were made for him to go to the Slade School of Fine Art, where he studied under Professor Frederick Brown. On completing his studies at the Slade he spent eighteen months at the Acad&eacute;mie Julian in Paris, where he started etching in Pre-Raphaelite style, but this practice was brought to a halt when he temporarily ran out of funds and was obliged to sell his press.<br>
<br>Briscoe returned to London, where he produced black and white images, under the Burne-Jones influence. Soon afterwards he was commissioned to illustrate an edition of Keats (his favourite poet) and the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen. Although a cartoonist of great ability, Briscoe never felt the need to establish himself as an illustrator. He had a comfortable allowance, was not ambitious, and had no wish to raise his prices to wealthier clients.<br>
<br>Abandoning French styles, Briscoe became interested in the work of Philip Wilson Steer (1860&#150;1942). Also a Birkenhead man, Steer had been painting in Essex and this influence led Briscoe to Malden and Heybridge basin, where he obtained lodgings and a studio, making local friends who were interested in small-boat sailing. Briscoe designed and built his own flat-bottomed dinghy and was a founding member of the Blackwater Sailing Club. About 1899 he bought a 3 ton cutter, the <i>Doris</i>, in which he sailed around the Essex coast.<br>
<br>On 19 March 1901 Briscoe married Mabel Grace Sarah (1881/2&#150;1969), eldest child of Samuel Shawyer, an Indian mutiny veteran; their son William was born in 1903. The family generally spent eight or nine months of the year aboard the yacht, sailing to Calais, along the Belgian coast, and through the Dutch waterways; when abroad Briscoe was constantly sketching and painting in watercolours and oils. He excelled as a marine artist, his sketches being evocative of the last days of square-rigged sailing ships, Dutch craft, the coast of East Anglia, and nautical activity. Influenced by Vermeer, the Van der Veldes, and also by Mesdag, Mauve, and Breitner, he had studied his subjects intensively, filling his sketchbooks with details of rigging, barges, and steamers, all with the intention of understanding the workmanship involved. As a result he combined technical accuracy with aesthetically pleasing and balanced effects, and his work remains unsurpassed.<br>
<br>In 1906 Briscoe held a one-man show of thirty-five watercolours, called &#145;Round the North Sea and Zuyder Zee&#146;, at the Modern Gallery in Bond Street, London. It was a great success and established his reputation. Other exhibitions followed at the Leicester Square Galleries, London, and elsewhere. Briscoe wrote and illustrated <span class="italic">A Handbook on Sailing</span> (1908) under the pseudonym Clove Hitch, the name he frequently used in the yachting press. Later in that year he took delivery of a yacht named the <i>Golden Vanity</i>. He often took this yacht in to the Dutch canals, and his sketchbooks are filled with drawings of scenes from these parts.<br>
<br>In 1910 Briscoe's mother financed the building at West Mersea of Buzzon, a house with a studio. When the First World War broke out, Briscoe was offered a commission in the navy. He enlisted in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve auxiliary patrol as lieutenant, and joined his ship on 31 December 1914. The immediate post-war period was spent cruising to and around the Netherlands in the <i>Golden Vanity</i>, but about this time Briscoe came across several unused copperplates from his days in Paris and began etching. In 1923 James McBey saw these plates and took them to London, where he printed them on his press. Briscoe started etching seriously, his activities coinciding with the etching revival, which he witnessed at its peak and then saw slump.<br>
<br>In 1926 Briscoe made a superb scale model of the <i>Cutty Sark</i>, a vessel which appears intermittently throughout his sketchbooks. He was divorced in that year, and in May 1927 married Alice Conyers Baker (<i>d</i>. 1942), leasing a small studio flat in Notting Hill, London. In August he and Alice cruised to the Netherlands and were joined at Rotterdam by Harold Dickens, who published his etchings. The <i>Golden Vanity</i> was sold in 1929 and the couple moved to Lansdowne House in Holland Park, London, where Briscoe devoted his energies to etching and painting. He and Alice spent long summer holidays at St Mawes and he also had an 18 foot lugger built, named the <i>Liberty</i>. Sketchbooks during his cruise aboard the <i>Alastor</i>, in 1929 or 1930, are full of sketches and colour washes detailing the trip, and are rich with vignettes of polar bears, nude sketches of Alice, and various other details.<br>
<br>In the early 1930s Briscoe's mother died and he came into a considerable inheritance. He had never liked London and bought a house in Walton on the Naze. He added a large studio, had the <i>Liberty</i> brought over from St Mawes, and in 1934 settled in.<br>
<br>When the Second World War broke out, Briscoe tried to rejoin the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve but at sixty-six he had to be content with being an ARP warden. Early in 1940 he suffered a stroke, and he and Alice went to the Berry Head Hotel in Brixham, overlooking Tor Bay, where in former days he had loved to sketch the sailing trawler fleet. Alice died in 1942, and Briscoe moved into a private hotel, Broomfield Lodge, Broomfield Road, Chelmsford, near where his son was living. He died there on 27 April 1943 and was buried in Broomfield church.<br>
