<span class="headword">Victor</span>, prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Count Gleichen]</span>  (1833&#150;1891), <span class="occ">naval officer and sculptor</span>, was the third and youngest son of Prince Ernst of Hohenlohe-Langenburg and his wife, Princess Feodore, the only daughter of Emich Charles, reigning prince of Leiningen, and his wife, Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, afterwards the duchess of Kent; his mother was half-sister to Queen Victoria. He was born Victor Ferdinand Franz Eugen Gustaf Adolf Constantin Friedrich at the castle of Langenburg in W&uuml;rttemberg, Germany, on 11 November 1833 and was sent to school at Dresden, from which he ran away. In 1848, through the interest of Queen Victoria, he entered the British navy as a midshipman on the <i>Powerful</i>. He then served in the <i>Cumberland</i>, the flagship of Admiral Sir George Seymour on the North American station. During the expedition to the Baltic in 1854 he was slightly wounded at Bomarsund. He was next appointed to the <i>St Jean d'Acre</i> off Sevastopol, and was afterwards transferred to the naval brigade and did duty in the trenches. As aide-de-camp to Sir Harry Keppel he was present at the battle of the Chernaya, and was distinguished for his bravery under fire.<br>
<br>In 1856 Prince Victor was appointed flag lieutenant to Sir Harry Keppel in China; he took a prominent part in the fighting and was recommended for the Victoria Cross. Repeated illness, however, undermined his constitution and prevented him earning fresh distinction in the navy, and he was compelled to retire on half pay in 1866. He was created KCB in January 1866, and was appointed by the queen to be governor and constable of Windsor Castle. On 26 January 1861 he married Laura Williamina, the youngest daughter of Admiral Sir George Francis Seymour. By an old German law Prince Victor's wife, not being of equal rank, was disqualified from using her husband's title. So Prince Victor assumed the title of Count Gleichen, the second title in the family, by which he was known for many years.<br>
<br>After he retired from the navy Count Gleichen devoted himself to an artistic career, for which he had considerable talent. Being fond of modelling, he studied for three years under William Theed. The loss of his fortune, the result of a bank failure, caused him to look to sculpture as a serious profession. He had been granted by Queen Victoria a suite of apartments in St James's Palace, where he set up a studio and entered into regular competition as a working sculptor. He made several imaginative groups as well as monuments and portrait busts. Some of the busts were considered very successful, notably those of the earl of Beaconsfield, the marquess of Salisbury, and Sir Harry Keppel. His most important work was a colossal statue of Alfred the Great, made for the main square of the town of Wantage. His success as a sculptor enabled him to build a small house near Ascot. In 1885 Count and Countess Gleichen were permitted by the queen to revert to the names of Prince and Princess Victor of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. In 1887 Prince Victor was promoted GCB and admiral on the retired list. He died at St James's Palace, London, on 31 December 1891. He was survived by his son, Count, later Major-General Lord, Albert Edward Wilfred Gleichen (1863&#150;1937) of the Grenadier Guards&#151;who served in the Sudan, South Africa, and the First World War&#151;and three daughters, of whom the eldest, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33423/', "Lady F&#233;odora Gleichen (1861&#150;1922)")</script>, inherited her father's skill in sculpture.<br>
