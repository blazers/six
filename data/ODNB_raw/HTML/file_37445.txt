<span class="headword">Gascoyne,  Joel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1650, <em>d.</em> 1705), <span class="occ">chart maker and cartographer</span>, was baptized in Holy Trinity parish, Hull, on 31 October 1650, the younger child and only son of Thomas Gascoyne or Gaskin, master mariner. The family had since 1605 been prominent in Hull and especially in the Hull Trinity House. Joel Gascoyne was apprenticed for a period of seven years from 21 October 1668 to John Thornton. Thornton was one of a group of manuscript chart makers who, since the early seventeenth century, had plied their trade as members of the Drapers' Company in shops lining the streets and alleys down-river from the Tower of London. Under Thornton, Gascoyne learned the skills of chart making, engraving, and surveying, an unusual combination for the period.<br>
<br>In 1675 Gascoyne established himself in business as a chart maker at &#145;The Signe of the Platt neare Wapping Old Stayres three doares below the Chappell&#146;  (Ravenhill and Johnson, 1). As a full member of the Drapers' Company and with apprentices indentured to him he produced manuscript and engraved charts. He built up a considerable reputation in chart making, his advice being sought in 1680 and again in 1685 by Samuel Pepys, secretary to the Admiralty. Notable works were a 1678 portolan chart for Captain John Smith of the east coast of North and Central America and the West Indies and 1682 and 1685 maps of Carolina.<br>
<br>Gascoyne's last payment of dues to the Drapers' Company was recorded in February 1689 and from this date his energies were directed mainly, but not exclusively, towards land surveying. This may have been because he, like other manuscript chart makers, was suffering competition from the publishers of printed charts, or because of the death of his patron the second duke of Albemarle. In 1691 Gascoyne mapped the estates of James Cecil, third earl of Salisbury; the following year he mapped Sayes Court, Deptford, Kent, which was owned by John Evelyn who had there laid out a fine garden  (BL, K xviii 18.0 18p). In 1692 he was directed by Samuel Travers, surveyor of land revenue to King William and Queen Mary, to make a survey of the &#145;Mannor of East Greenwich in Kent&#146;  (TNA: PRO, CREST 2 60/1642) following the grant by the monarchs of &#145;the house at Greenwich to be a hospital for wounded seamen&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1691&#150;2</i>, 481). Gascoyne produced a fine map on vellum (now in the National Archives).<br>
<br>Travers introduced Gascoyne to his native county of Cornwall where he did his most important work. He produced two large atlases of estate maps; the <span class="roman">Stowe Atlas</span> of thirty-three manuscript maps on vellum, detailing estates owned by the Grenville family around Kilkhampton (Cornwall RO, DD X273), and the <span class="roman">Lanhydrock Atlas</span> of four large volumes containing 258 manuscript maps on vellum, compiled between 1694 and <i>c</i>.1699, of properties scattered widely over the county belonging to the Robartes family (Lanhydrock House, Bodmin). At the same time Gascoyne took the opportunity of surveying the whole of Cornwall. As a result of this new fieldwork a map, dedicated to Charles Bodville Robartes, second earl of Radnor and lord lieutenant of Cornwall, was published on 27 March 1699. It is a fine map and on what was for the period the large scale of almost 1 inch to the mile, making Cornwall the first major English county to be mapped on this large scale. In 1700 Gascoyne issued proposals to produce a similar map for Devon but, probably through lack of support following a succession of deaths in the family of his patrons, this did not materialize. Such failures were typical of the times and Gascoyne returned to London that year. In 1700 he produced maps and a report on Enfield Chace for the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. He continued surveying for the earl of Radnor at Great Haseley and Latchford, Oxfordshire, in 1701 (copy Bodl. Oxf. (E) C 17: 49 (58); original in private hands) and for the earl of Salisbury in Hertfordshire, among others. Between 1702 and 1703 he was commissioned by the vestry to survey the parish of Stepney, producing manuscript and printed maps of the whole parish and of the individual &#145;hamlets&#146; to help in the administration of this rapidly growing area.<br>
<br>Gascoyne died in London on 13 February 1705 leaving a wife, Elizabeth. He was undoubtedly a pioneer in his specifications for county maps and initiated the eighteenth-century remapping of England on large scales.<br>
