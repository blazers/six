<span class="headword">Porter,  Thomas</span>  (1636&#150;1680), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born in the Strand, London, the fourth of the five surviving sons (there were two daughters) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22562/', "Endymion Porter (1587&#150;1649)")</script> and Olivia (<i>d</i>. 1663), daughter of Sir John Boteler of Bramfield and Elizabeth Villiers, sister to the first duke of Buckingham. The Porters were an affluent family who had built up a network of political and artistic connections at the courts of James I and Charles I. Part of Thomas's early education may have been entrusted to private tutors. From late in 1638 both &#145;sweet Tom&#146;  (Townshend, 200) and his brother James were put under the care of a Porter relative at Woodhall, the family estate.<br>
<br>During the civil wars Porter shared his parents' life of peregrinations&#151;at Oxford, Paris, Brussels, and Antwerp. By the spring of 1649 the impoverished family were back in London, where Endymion compounded for his possessions. In February 1655 Thomas abducted his cousin Lady Anne from the house of her father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2692/', "Mountjoy Blount, earl of Newport")</script>. By order of the earl, Porter was arrested and imprisoned, but was released shortly afterwards. The parties were reconciled, a marriage took place, and Anne gave birth to a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22565/', "George Porter (c.1659&#150;1728)")</script>. Thomas evidently shared the irascible temper of his elder brothers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22564/', "George Porter (bap. 1621, d. 1683)")</script> and Philip (1628&#150;1655). In March 1655, in a duel fought in Covent Garden, Porter killed his opponent, Thomas Salkeld. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter but &#145;being allowed the benefit of clergy was burned in the hand&#146;  (Summers, 231). Shortly after Anne's death, possibly in 1659, Porter married Roberta Anne Colepeper. In February 1660 he was taken into custody and imprisoned at Lambeth House, having taken part in an armed riot in London. It was possibly in recognition of their father's services in the Stuart cause that Thomas and his brother James in November 1662 were both given the captaincy of a troop of horse in Sir Charles Gerard's regiment. But Thomas apparently wished to gain greater financial security. In 1662 he acquired from Henry Killigrew an annuity for life of &pound;4 a week, a sum that had been conveyed to Killigrew out of his father, Thomas's, shares in the Theatre Royal. Porter towards the end of 1666 sold the stipend for &pound;600 to Sir John and Lady Katherine Sayers. Lady Sayers later complained that Porter had gone off to Tangier &#145;without giving her up the old deed&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1661&#150;2</i>, 225), worth &pound;115. She requested that Samuel Pepys, the treasurer for Tangier, &#145;stop&#146; the &pound;115 out of Porter's pay&#151;an indication that the latter was in the employ of the Tangier committee. Porter had come to Pepys's notice as early as 15 May 1663, when the diarist reported a &#145;ridiculous falling out&#146; at an entertainment at Lord Oxford's, involving the lords Albemarle and Bellasis and &#145;two of the Porters&#146;  (Pepys, 4.136). A similar quarrel took a tragic turn four years later, for on 29 July 1667 Pepys recorded that Sir Henry Bellasis, son of the governor of Tangier, and Thomas Porter, &#145;the greatest friends in the world&#146;  (ibid., 8.363), had fought a duel, apparently for the silliest of reasons. On 8 August Pepys learned that Bellasis had succumbed to his wounds. Porter fled to France; the coroner later found that Bellasis had died from unknown causes.<br>
<br>Porter was the author of two plays, <span class="italic">The Villain</span> (1663) and <span class="italic">The Carnival</span> (1664). First performed by the Duke's Company at Lincoln's Inn Fields on 18 October 1662, <span class="italic">The Villain</span> ran ten days consecutively and remained a favourite until the end of the century. Its initial cast included Thomas Betterton, Henry Harris, and Joseph Price, &#145;that inimitable sprightly actor&#146;  (Downes, 23). As much as the tragic design, obviously inspired by <span class="italic">Othello</span>, the &#145;incomparable&#146; performance  (Langbaine, 407) of Samuel Sandford as the Iago-like villain Malignii accounted for the play's tremendous success. Pepys, however, said that he &#145;was never less pleased with a play in my life&#146;  (Pepys, 3.230). Alluding to Porter's reputation for fieriness, Sir William Davenant in his epilogue to <span class="italic">The Villain</span> advised critics of the play to &#145;take heed&#146;: the dramatist might<blockquote>
<div class="indent">not challenge any one to fight;<br>
</div>
<div>But which is worse, does threaten all that write.<br>
</div> (Davenant, 340)</blockquote>In its locale, characters, and plot, <span class="italic">The Carnival</span>, probably performed by the King's Company in 1664, testifies to the impact of the Spanish comedia on the early Restoration stage. In the writing of both plays Porter may have been assisted by Davenant, his father's lifelong prot&eacute;g&eacute;. On the tenuous evidence of the initials &#145;T. P.&#146; on the title-pages, two other plays have been ascribed to the author: <span class="italic">A Witty Combat</span>, published in 1663 but possibly never performed, and <span class="italic">The French Conjurer</span> (printed 1678), probably produced at Dorset Gardens in June 1677. Later research suggests that the attribution is unwarranted.<br>
<br>In his will dated 22 August 1680 Porter appointed his son George as his sole executor, entrusting to his care his &#145;dear&#146; (third) wife, probably Anne Canning, of Foxcote. Porter died between 22 August 1680 and 7 December 1680, when a grant was issued to George, making him the trustee of all possessions formerly belonging to Roberta Anne, who had died in or about July 1661.<br>
