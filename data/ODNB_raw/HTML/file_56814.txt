<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bartlett,  Ellis  Ashmead-</span>  (1881&#150;1931), <span class="occ">war correspondent</span>, was born at 57 Grosvenor Street, London, on 11 February 1881, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30627/', "Sir Ellis Ashmead Bartlett (1849&#150;1902)")</script>, a Conservative MP, and his wife, Frances Christina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Walsh (1851/2&#150;1929). The family mixed in and scandalized high society. His uncle William Ashmead Bartlett [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58663/', "William Lehmann Ashmead Bartlett Burdett-Coutts")</script>] caused a sensation when he married his benefactor, the wealthy Baroness Burdett-Coutts, some thirty years his senior; Ellis senior had a highly publicized affair with Blanche Hozier, mother of Clementine Churchill, in 1889.<br>
<br>Ashmead-Bartlett (who generally hyphenated his name) was educated at home before he was sent to Marlborough College, where he quickly tired of the routine of school life. In 1897 he managed to escape it for a term when his father accepted an invitation from the sultan of Turkey to observe the Graeco-Turkish War and decided to bring the young Ellis with him. While following the war's progress, the sixteen-year-old was injured, lost, and taken prisoner. Remarkably, these experiences managed to fire an enthusiasm for military life. On leaving school, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in a militia battalion of the Bedford regiment in 1898, promoted to the rank of lieutenant in 1899, and in 1900 served in the South African War, of which his father and uncle were observers. However, he was invalided home as a result of complications to a head wound he had suffered as part of his earlier experience in Greece. He resigned his commission, with the rank of captain, in 1904.<br>
<br>Forced out of the action, Ashmead-Bartlett confronted a problem that would plague him throughout his life: how to maintain his extravagant lifestyle on a limited budget. Socially well-connected, but impecunious, he became increasingly reliant on his wealthy uncle, living with him after his father died insolvent in 1902. To make a living, Bartlett dabbled with diplomatic options, tried journalism, and even studied law. He acquired a lifelong gambling habit, and in the years to come was involved in a series of bizarre moneymaking schemes, including attempts at gunrunning in Morocco in 1907 and working as an agent provocateur in post-First World War Austria. For the flamboyant and adventurous Bartlett, a career as Conservative MP&#151;he stood unsuccessfully as candidate for the constituencies of Normanton, Yorkshire, and Poplar, London, in the general elections of 1910&#151;could only seem pale by comparison.<br>
<br>When, in 1904, war broke out between Russia and Japan, Ashmead-Bartlett tried his hand as a war correspondent. He borrowed &pound;300 and went to the front where <span class="italic">The Standard</span> hired him as a stringer. In 1907 he was correspondent with the French army in Morocco; in 1911 Reuters hired him to cover the Italian invasion of north Africa, where his uncensored account of Italian troops massacring local villagers was published worldwide. His reputation was growing, although his real break came in 1912, when Harry Lawson (Lord Burnham) hired him to cover the first and second Balkan wars for the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>. Ashmead-Bartlett repaid him with more scoops, including the first report of the Turkish defeat at the battle of Lule Burgas.<br>
<br>The outbreak of the First World War offered strangely few opportunities for war correspondents. At the outset Ashmead-Bartlett tried to report on the early stages of the war in central Europe with little success. The <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> hired him as a roving correspondent in France, but army restrictions made it impossible to undertake the kind of reporting he had done in other conflicts. By January 1915 he was back in London, where mounting debts he incurred keeping up his champagne lifestyle on a correspondent's salary had pushed him into bankruptcy.<br>
<br>The opening of a new campaign in the Dardanelles offered a lifeline. On Lawson's recommendation, Ashmead-Bartlett became one of three official press correspondents allowed to accompany the forces. By 5 April 1915 Bartlett was at Mudros Bay, the staging point for the Dardanelles invasion, where he wrote breathlessly of the &#145;greatest Armada of warships and transports ever assembled together in history&#146;  (Brenchley and Brenchley, 56). But he soon began to harbour doubts about the campaign.<br>
<br>At a meeting with Sir Ian Hamilton, commander of the allied Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, Ashmead-Bartlett asked if the reporters might accompany the troops on their landing. Hamilton, at this point a great believer in press freedom, agreed. Then Ashmead-Bartlett had another stroke of luck. Hamilton's plan required two attacks: the main landing by the British at Cape Helles, and a lesser flanking attack by the Australian and New Zealand forces, at Gaba Tepe. A lucky toss of the coin decided the inveterate gambler's future. Reuters correspondent Lester Lawrence won the British, while Ashmead-Bartlett would cover the &#145;colonials&#146; from Australasia.<br>
<br>Ashmead-Bartlett's account of the landings on the morning of 25 April 1915 became his most famous piece of writing. His vivid description of the courage, spirit, and fighting qualities of the soldiers became the foundation of the &#145;Anzac legend&#146;, a key part of popular nationalism in Australia and New Zealand. That his account was the first to be published (in both Britain and Australia on 7 May 1915, and a day later in New Zealand) was one factor in forging its mythic status: Ashmead-Bartlett himself was another. For the still-fervently imperial Australasian public, it was important that their boys had been judged and not found wanting by a famous British war correspondent. As one soldier later wrote, &#145;It is fairly certain that future historians will teach that Australia was discovered not by Captain Cook, explorer, but by Mr Ashmead Bartlett, war correspondent&#146;  (Fewster, 20).<br>
<br>As the campaign quickly turned into a bloody stalemate, Ashmead-Bartlett began to criticize the army's leadership. Restive under Hamilton's increasing censorship, and having survived the torpedo attack on the <i>Majestic</i> off Gallipoli at the end of May, he made his way to London in June 1915 on the pretext of requiring new kit. His social standing, and his reputation, meant he met with war leaders including Lord Kitchener. He was asked to provide a memorandum on the Dardanelles situation for Asquith, the prime minister. On 14 June 1915 he returned to the Dardanelles, taking with him a motion picture camera with which he filmed scenes from Anzac cove, the only moving pictures of the campaign.<br>
<br>After a disastrous offensive in August 1915, Ashmead-Bartlett tried to sound the alarm again. To avoid the censors, he persuaded another visiting press correspondent, Keith Murdoch, to smuggle a letter to Asquith on his way to London. Hamilton was tipped off: military police confiscated the letter from Murdoch on 19 September in Marseilles, and on the pretext that he had broken censorship laws, Ashmead-Bartlett was forced to leave Gallipoli on 2 October 1915. Yet in the end, Hamilton could not stop the news getting through. On 23 September Murdoch dictated a version of the letter, which reached Asquith and within a few days was circulated to the Dardanelles committee. Meanwhile, Ashmead-Bartlett returned to London in October to publicize his views, notably in a lecture at the end of the month, critical of mistakes made in the campaign  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 Oct 1915).<br>
<br>Although Ashmead-Bartlett and Murdoch's letter caused a storm, its wider effects should not be exaggerated. The government already held concerns about the campaign. A few days before Murdoch arrived, one of Hamilton's own staff, Major Guy Dawnay, had arrived in England with the same story to tell. As a fellow correspondent, Compton Mackenzie, noted, Ashmead-Bartlett's views were just &#145;one extra sack of coal unloaded on a Newcastle of ill will&#146;  (Hiley, 259). In January 1916 his film of the Dardanelles was screened for the first time in London, and was later distributed as a popular movie, <span class="italic">With the Dardanelles Expedition</span>, which was played as part of his lecture tour of Australia and New Zealand in that year. Both helped cement his role in the creation of the Anzac legend.<br>
<br>Ashmead-Bartlett continued to work as a correspondent, covering the French army for a short period in 1916. But his relations with the War Office meant he would never again report on British forces, and although he gave evidence in May 1917 to the commission on the Dardanelles campaign, he spent some time away from the war, pursuing business opportunities in America. Immediately after the war though, he regained his enthusiasm, covering the collapse of the Austrian empire from Vienna, again for the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>. There he became involved in a counter-revolution against communist forces in Hungary, eventually representing the short-lived K&aacute;roly government of Hungary at the Paris peace conference. In Paris he met Marie Alejandrina (Nina) Elizade, from a wealthy Argentinian family. After forty-eight hours they were engaged, although their wedding was delayed by Ashmead-Bartlett's campaigning work. They married in Paris in 1919 and had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Ashmead-Bartlett returned to Britain where, after an unsuccessful attempt in 1923, he was elected Conservative MP for Hammersmith North at the general election of 1924, defeating the sitting Labour member on an anti-socialist platform. After another bankruptcy, precipitated by a court case over a political pamphlet which he issued while campaigning, he resigned his seat in May 1926. To stave off further financial disaster, he returned to reporting, and published <span class="italic">The Uncensored Dardanelles</span> (1928). While in Lisbon to cover the visit of the prince of Wales, he became unwell, and died there of &#145;congestion of the lungs&#146; on 4 May 1931.<br>
