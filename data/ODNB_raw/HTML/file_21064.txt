<span class="headword">Pace,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1523, <em>d.</em> in or before 1592), <span class="occ">scholar and court jester</span>, was probably the son of John Pace, a brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21065/', "Richard Pace (1483?&#150;1536)")</script>, secretary to Henry VIII, diplomat, and humanist. In 1522 the elder John Pace received &#145;license to exercise by deputy the office of customer &hellip; in the port of Lynne&#146; and &#145;to keep, buy and sell ships, and negociate as to the freightage of ships&#146;. He was then a London resident, and owned &#145;lands and offices&#146; estimated at the yearly value of &pound;40, 100 marks  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 3.2, 889, 1052). Richard Pace informs us that, in 1527, his brother John had a &#145;wife and children&#146;  (ibid., 4.2, 1472), but their names are unknown.<br>
<br>John Pace the younger studied at Eton College and was afterwards elected to King's College, Cambridge. In 1539 he is described as a &#145;went away Fellow&#146; at the latter institution  (Harwood, 157), although John Heywood, a contemporary satirist, credits him with a master of arts degree  (Camden, 266). However, Pace, who was known for his caustic wit, abandoned his scholarly career to become a court jester, in which capacity he was &#145;appointed&#146; to Henry VIII  (Harwood, 157) and then to the duke of Norfolk. To those contemporaries who were outraged &#145;that Pace being a maister of Arte had disgraced himselfe with wearing a fooles coate&#146;, John Heywood presumably indicated that &#145;it is lesse hurtfull to the common-weale, when wise men goe in fooles coates, than when fooles goe in wise mens gownes&#146;  (Camden, 266).<br>
<br>Pace's religious affiliation has been subject to debate. Cole believes that he &#145;retained his integrity&#146; as a Roman Catholic  (Cole, fols. 26<i>v</i>&#150;27). To this attests an anecdote included in Cardinal Allen's <span class="italic">Apologie</span> for the English colleges, an anti-protestant pamphlet written and published in exile in 1581, as a response to Queen Elizabeth's two recent proclamations issued against the English Catholics studying in foreign seminaries. After blaming his adversaries for their attempts to &#145;forbid the entering, having, or reading&#146; Catholic books, Allen relates that &#145;madde Pace meeting one day with M. Juel [John Jewel, bishop of Salisbury] &hellip; saluted his L. courtly, and said, Now my Lord, quoth he, you may be at rest with these felowes [the Catholics], for you are quit by Proclamation&#146;  (Allen, 58<i>v</i>). Pace's anachronistic remark (Jewel had died in 1571) served to voice Allen's disapproval of the queen's legal ban on Catholic books. Doran maintains that Pace was, on the contrary, a supporter of the protestant movement, although he himself questions the reliability of the story which supports his view  (Doran, 164&#150;6).<br>
<br>Whatever his religious credo might have been, Pace remained hostile to Queen Elizabeth. Francis Bacon, who coined the name Bitter Fool for Pace, relates in his <span class="italic">Apophthegmes New and Old</span> (1625) that Pace, who had been kept away from the queen because of his acerbity, was admitted one day before her, at the insistence of her courtiers, &#145;undertaking for him that he should keep compass&#146;. But when the queen said: &#145;Come on, Pace: now we shall hear of our faults&#146;, Pace uninhibitedly replied: &#145;I do not use to talk of that that all the town talks of&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rogeri Bacon opera</span>, 330). His witty sayings earned Pace the reputation of an authority in satirical literature. In his pamphlet <span class="italic">Pierce Penilesse</span> (1592) Thomas Nashe includes Pace among famous &#145;Orators and Poets&#146;, such as &#145;Machevill&#146;, &#145;Tully&#146; (Cicero), Ovid, Roscius, and Robert Greene  (Nashe, 1). In the prologue to the tragedy <span class="italic">Thorney Abbey, or, The London Maid</span>, by &#145;T. W.&#146; (1662), the Fool nostalgically calls &#145;Pacy&#146; one of his &#145;venerable predecessors&#146;  (Welsford, 249). Pace is mentioned again in a nineteenth-century historical account of anecdotal literature  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 410).<br>
<br>Pace had died by 1592, for Nashe, in <span class="italic">Pierce Penilesse</span>, includes the &#145;Ghost of &hellip; Pace, the Duke of Norfolks Jester&#146; among those to whom he claims to have dedicated &#145;epistles&#146;  (Nashe, 1).<br>
