<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Thomas</span>  (1784&#150;1813), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the third son of Thomas Lloyd of Gloucester, King's county, Ireland, MP for King's county (1768&#150;90), and his wife, Jane, youngest daughter and coheir of Thomas Le Hunte. On 1 August 1797 he was appointed ensign in the 54th foot in Ireland, and was promoted lieutenant on 6 May 1799. He served with the 54th at Ferrol, in the Egyptian campaign of 1801, and at Gibraltar in 1802, during the mutiny there, when the steadiness of the 54th gained high praise from the duke of Kent. He became captain in the 6th battalion of the reserve in 1803, and in 1804 was transferred to the 43rd light infantry, then training under Sir John Moore at Shorncliffe. He served with the 43rd at Copenhagen, and throughout the Peninsular campaigns of 1808&#150;10. Romantic stories of his daring at the outposts were current in the army. On 8 October 1810 he was promoted major in the Old 94th, and became lieutenant-colonel of it on 17 August 1812. He commanded the 94th at the battle of Vitoria, and fell at its head at the battle of the Nivelle on 10 November 1813.<br>
<br>Lloyd appears to have been much loved by his men  (Donaldson, 185&#150;6, 193&#150;5). The historian, Sir William Napier, wrote of him:<blockquote>In him were combined mental and bodily powers of no ordinary kind. Graceful symmetry, herculean strength, a countenance frank and majestic, gave a true indication of his nature, for his capacity was great and exceeding, and his military knowledge extensive, both from experience and study. Of his mirth and wit, well known in the army, it need only be said that he used the latter without offence, but so as to increase his ascendency &hellip; for though gentle, he was ambitious, valiant, and conscious of his fitness for great exploits. (Napier, 5.383&#150;4)</blockquote>
