<span class="headword">Hill,  Benson Earle</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1790?, <em>d.</em> 1845), <span class="occ">soldier and writer</span>, was born in Bristol and was probably the Benson Hill who was baptized at St Michael's, Bristol, on 18 August 1790, the son of William Hill and his wife, Isabel. He was educated at Dr Watson's school, Shooters Hill, and at the military colleges of Marlow and Woolwich. At the age of fourteen he was commissioned second lieutenant in the Royal Regiment of Artillery. He was appointed first lieutenant on 17 March 1812, and served until 1822.<br>
<br>Hill was passionately stage-struck and tried to make a second career in the theatre. However, he never managed to gain more than a precarious foothold there, and the rest of his life was spent in struggle as he tried his luck with varying degrees of failure as actor, writer, journalist, and editor. He was extremely well-travelled, as the army had taken him to Ireland, North America, and Europe, and pursuit of an acting career hurried him through the length and breadth of the British Isles. Journalism finally led him to the fringe of London's literary establishment. From 1837 to 1841 he was sub-editor of the <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span>, under the editorship of Theodore Hook. Every experience brought adventure; none brought financial reward.<br>
<br>Hill's publications included an account of his military service, <span class="italic">Recollections of an Artillery Officer</span> (1836), as well as a book of anecdotes about snuff taking (1840). One of his last works, and the one for which he is remembered, was <span class="italic">The Epicure's Almanac</span>, published in London in 1841, which reflected the varied nature of his life. The title echoed that of the French <span class="italic">Almanach des gourmands</span> and its English imitators, which surveyed the restaurant scene in Paris and London in the early years of the century. Although Hill hoped to link his venture to the popularity of these forebears, his own book was addressed to a different reader, not the man who dined out, but the one who dined in, and it offered a new recipe for every day of the year &#145;to those who study genteel economy&#146;. Appearing in the decade which saw the first published work by Alexis Soyer and Eliza Acton, <span class="italic">The Epicure's Almanac</span> was refreshingly original in its choice of ingredients, reflecting the cosmopolitan background and persistent insolvency of its author. The book offers many ingenious suggestions for impecunious chefs, and includes a recommendation for boiled nettles and cider with bicarbonate of soda, as a poor man's champagne.<br>
<br>Just as poverty forced improvisation, so military service broadened horizons: ingredients, and instructions for their preparation, were drawn from many countries. Tours of duty had placed Hill in New Orleans and Brussels, Killarney and Mons; and the inclusion of coconut, chutneys, and kebabs hint at the ripening British love affair with India and the East, as well as the service of fellow officers there. Enthusiastic recipes for punch point to the power and popularity of the West Indies sugar trade. An interest, early for England, in the cooked tomato may have been stimulated by his time in America. The French way with a caper is noted with approval.<br>
<br>Hill's pages are studded with British regional delicacies, from Cheshire pork pie to the north Wiltshire cheese, and tribute is paid by name to such hospitable tavern keepers as a Mr Reilly of the York-House, Bath, and a Mr Burnham of the Montague tavern, Bristol. In addition, Hill's good sense and gusto give the book a special savour: attention is paid to method and light-hearted titles add lustre to left-overs, as in the delightfully named &#145;Patrician bubble and squeak&#146;. Cooking and eating are presented as serious entertainments, worthy of consideration by the enterprising.<br>
<br>Hill lived for many years with a sister, who died of consumption in 1842. On 27 February 1843 he married Mary Ann Goulding, with whom he had a daughter. Like his sister he succumbed to consumption and died on 30 August 1845 at 2 Salisbury Street, London, in &#145;an obscure abode, in penury and distress&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 543), aged fifty-five, after catching a cold while engaged as that most threadbare of performers, an actor on call for last-minute work, at the Lyceum Theatre. He was buried in London.<br>
