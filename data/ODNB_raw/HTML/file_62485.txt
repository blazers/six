<span class="headword">Thompson,  Dorothy Evelyn</span>  (1888&#150;1961), <span class="occ">mountaineer</span>, was born on 29 May 1888 at 17 Colville Mansions, Kensington, London, one of two daughters and a son of Frederick Charles Thompson (<i>d</i>. 1919), a civil servant in the India Office, and his wife, Eleanor Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilson. With parents who were keen hill walkers, she first climbed in Perthshire during family holidays. On holiday in Wasdale, before the First World War, she met some serious rock climbers, and made friendships that led to her joining the Fell and Rock Climbing Club in 1919. During the war she joined the staff of a relief fund, and afterwards was for many years a secretary at the School of Oriental Studies in Bloomsbury.<br>
<br>Dorothy Thompson was a frequent attender at the Fell and Rock Climbing Club's Easter meets, and went on to tackle climbs in Corsica and the Pyrenees before venturing into the Alps in 1920. There she met Joseph Georges, known as &#145;Le Skieur&#146;, climbed with him for many seasons thereafter, and went ski-mountaineering from 1933. In 1929 she was the first woman to ascend Mont Blanc by Brouillard Ridge and in 1934 she scaled the same peak by the Aiguille de Bionassay, pioneering the return by Peuteret Ridge, the only time it had been descended. She and Georges were an ideal climbing pair and led several parties in the Alps. A small person with a keen sense of humour, she concealed behind a very quiet exterior an indomitable will and purpose. She often led on glaciers, and as she was small and light her friends felt that it would have been easy to retrieve her if she fell into a crevasse.<br>
<br>Thompson never married; during the 1920s she lived with her mother at Porchester Square, Paddington. Subsequently she moved to Sussex, where she could indulge her love of gardening and birds. She had begun working on a book of climbing reminiscences and completed it shortly after the Second World War. This was not a good time to find a publisher, and eventually she decided to have it published privately. By this time she was suffering from heart trouble and its attendant restrictions. She died at her home, Donnithorne, Station Road, Heathfield, Sussex, on 2 December 1961 and was cremated in Eastbourne. Her book <span class="italic">Climbing with Joseph Georges</span> (1962) was seen into print with the help of the Ladies' Alpine Club and her friends. It captured the spirit of adventure during the inter-war years, when women were first accepted as equal partners with men, willing to share the risks and enjoyment of challenging the highest peaks.<br>
