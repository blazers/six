<span class="headword">Bellamy,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1773), <span class="occ">caterer</span>, is a figure about whom little is known other than through his association with the houses of parliament, where he held the office of deputy housekeeper and, later, housekeeper. He was also a wine merchant in his own right. Bellamy first came to prominence in 1773 when he was asked by a group of MPs to set up a dining room in the precincts of the Palace of Westminster adjacent to the court of requests; and this he did in two small rooms. Before that date there was no culinary provision: parliamentarians had to dine and drink in the numerous eating houses and taverns in New Palace Yard and the Bridgehead. Known as Bellamy's, and famed for its food and drink, the refreshment room was a noted parliamentary institution for sixty years, until it was destroyed in the fire of 1834. Prices were reported to be high at Bellamy's: 5<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. for a full dinner, 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. for &#145;cold meat, bread, beer and cheese&#146;. Claret, then as now a noted parliamentary beverage, was especially expensive at 10<i>s</i>. a bottle.<br>
<br>Bellamy and his establishment owe their lasting fame to two sources. First, a saying by William Pitt the younger (1759&#150;1806), whose apocryphal dying words were &#145;I think I could eat one of Bellamy's veal pies.&#146; The origin is unclear, but is ascribed to Benjamin Disraeli in some accounts. (According to Pitt's nephew, James Stanhope, his final words were, in fact, &#145;Oh, my country! how I leave my country!&#146;  (Ehrman, 3.829).) The second, and better-founded, case for Bellamy's renown is in Charles Dickens's <span class="italic">Sketches by Boz</span> (1836) which was based on the author's experience as a parliamentary reporter during the late 1820s and early 1830s.<br>
<br>Dickens was at pains to point out the importance of &#145;Bellamy's kitchen&#146; as a meeting place &#145;common to both Houses&#146;. It was only in the refreshment room that &#145;Ministerialists and Oppositionists, Whigs and Tories, Radicals, Peers, and Destructives, Strangers from the gallery, and the more favoured strangers from below the bar, are alike at liberty to resort&#146;  (Dickens, 158). Its great advantage was that the dining room was within the Palace of Westminster, so that MPs could easily be recalled to vote: as Dickens put it, Bellamy's was the place where many parliamentarians sat out heavy debates, &#145;solacing themselves with creature comforts&#146; until summoned by the &#145;whippers-in&#146; when the house was on the point of dividing.<br>
<br>In its latter years Bellamy's was staffed by two memorable &#145;Dickensian&#146; characters. The &#145;steady honest-looking old fellow in black&#146; was Nicholas, the butler. He was &#145;an unrivalled compounder of salad dressing&#151;an admirable preparer of soda water and lemon&#151;a special mixer of cold grog and punch&#151;and, above all, an unequalled judge of cheese&#146;  (Dickens, 158). With his long knowledge of the place, Nicholas would answer &#145;deferential questions about Sheridan, and Perceval, and Castlereagh, and Heaven knows what beside, with manifest delight&#146;. Although seldom expressing any political opinions, he had &#145;a great idea of the degeneracy of the times&#146;  (ibid., 159). The other denizen of the refreshment room, also dressed in black, was Jane, &#145;the Hebe of Bellamy's&#146;. Like many waitresses, she expressed a thorough contempt for the great majority of her customers; but was very flirtatious with those she liked. No bad hand at repartee, Jane showered her wit about with &#145;a degree of liberality and total absence of reserve or constraint&#146; that amazed strangers  (ibid., 161).<br>
<br>It is not known when John Bellamy died, but his association with politics and dining lives on: since 1867 Bellamy's has been the restaurant of the New Zealand parliament, and at Westminster new catering facilities at 1 Parliament Street were named after the former housekeeper in 1991.<br>
