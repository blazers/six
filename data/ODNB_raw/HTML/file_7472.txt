</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dempster,  George, of Dunnichen</span>  (1732&#150;1818), <span class="occ">agriculturist and politician</span>, was born at Alexander Kyd's Close, Dundee, Forfarshire, on 8 December 1732, the eldest son of John Dempster (1700&#150;1754), landowner and grain merchant, and his first wife, Isabel Ogilvie (1700&times;10&#150;<i>c</i>.1738).<h2>
<a name="Earlylife"></a>Early life</h2>Dempster was educated at Dundee grammar school (<i>c</i>.1739&#150;<i>c</i>.1748) and possibly also at the small parish school at Leuchars, Fife. On 24 February 1748 he entered the University of St Andrews and studied there until about 1750, when he left without taking a degree and moved to Edinburgh, to study law at the university. Edinburgh at this time was entering upon its greatest period of social and intellectual glory, and Dempster, by nature gregarious and convivial, took full advantage of the opportunities offered. He became one of the first members of the Select Society and later became a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73613/', "Poker Club")</script>.<br>
<br>On the death of his father in November 1754 Dempster inherited the family estates, which comprised some 6000 acres, yielding &pound;769 per annum, and thereby became moderately wealthy. Four months later he completed his legal studies, being admitted as a member of the Faculty of Advocates on 4 March 1755. The following year he set off on the grand tour of Europe, but was recalled suddenly to Scotland because of the illness of his eldest sister. Although she recovered, Dempster never managed to complete his grand tour. His role as family head occupied the next few years, dealing with estate and family affairs in Dundee and looking after the education of his younger brothers and sisters. The record of Dempster's career as an advocate has not survived, though it appears that he did practise during these years.<h2>
<a name="Politicalcareer"></a>Political career</h2>In 1760 Dempster turned his back on the legal profession and decided to enter parliament, offering himself as a candidate for the Perth district of burghs (comprising Perth, St Andrews, Dundee, Forfar, and Cupar), which were notorious for corruption and venality. Against the odds Dempster succeeded at his first attempt, albeit at a crippling cost, estimated at &pound;10,000. He contested four more general elections, on each occasion strengthening his popularity and support. He faced serious opposition in 1768 and 1780, but by 1784 had become virtually unassailable, remaining unchallenged despite his whig sympathies, while over 160 whigs lost their seats. The enormous cost of his first two elections forced Dempster to sell some 2500 acres&#151;all his land apart from the family estate at Dunnichen&#151;which he regretted for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Dempster was an MP for 28 years, but though from the start a frequent and passionate speaker (between 1768 and 1774, for example, he spoke on 193 occasions, a record exceeded by only 16 MPs out of the total of 692), he was not a natural politician. Although he called himself a whig, party politics and the need to vote with a party against his principles were distasteful to him, and he almost invariably followed an independent line. He wrote:<blockquote>I have long thought &hellip; that unless one preserves a little freedom and independency in Parliament to act in every question and to vote agreeably to the suggestions of one's mind, a seat in Parliament is a seat on thorns and rusty nails. (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 84&#150;5)</blockquote>His insistence on speaking and voting in accordance with his conscience rather than with his party gained him a reputation for incorruptibility and independence, and the sobriquet Honest George. Dempster readily presented petitions on behalf of his constituents, and regularly championed Scottish economic causes. Although this led to his being viewed as a Scottish patriot, he resented any accusation of partiality, saying that &#145;the sooner all national distinctions between the two kingdoms were forgot the better it would be for both&#146;  (Debrett, 10.125).<br>
<br>Early in his career Dempster was recruited as a government supporter, but he soon became restive and withdrew his support in December 1762. In 1765 he spoke and voted against the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span>, and thus began a long involvement with American affairs in which he unwaveringly supported the colonists and opposed government attempts to oppress them. The American question led Dempster to become a supporter of the marquess of Rockingham, whose views on America accorded with his own, and he remained a Rockinghamite for almost the whole of the remainder of his parliamentary career. When Rockingham became prime minister in August 1765, Dempster's support earned him the appointment of secretary to the Order of the Thistle, of which he was immensely proud. His unwillingness to place party above personal integrity, however, resulted in this being the only office he was ever granted.<br>
<br>India also became a major interest, both in and out of parliament. Dempster became a &#145;proprietor&#146; (shareholder) in the East India Company in 1763, and was elected a director in 1769 and 1772. He was very active, opposing government attempts to remove the company's independence, instead favouring internal reform of the company to eliminate fraud, corruption, and other abuses. He argued against colonization, believing that relations with India, as with China, should be purely commercial, and in 1787 he proposed a new type of government for India made up of a viceroy, council, and, in an echo of his views on America, an elected assembly of resident Europeans to which native Indians could make representations. Dempster strongly defended Warren Hastings against Edmund Burke's campaign of impeachment, believing Hastings to be unfairly blamed for many of the scandals involving the company.<br>
<br>Other issues that Dempster vigorously supported included proposals for a Scottish militia, freedom of the press and the right of newspapers to report parliamentary proceedings, and reduction of the national debt, the last being a theme to which he returned regularly. He backed the younger Pitt's proposed sinking fund, but managed to find fault with every one of the taxes with which Pitt intended to finance it. On reform of the parliamentary franchise Dempster was ambivalent. He was by nature a democrat and champion of the common man, but while supporting extension of the franchise in the counties he repeatedly surprised his colleagues by resisting that of the burghs, apparently to avoid betraying his electors; he was placing friendship, in this case to his constituents, above political principle.<br>
<br>In London Dempster married, on 24 September 1774, Rose Heming (<i>c</i>.1748&#150;1810), daughter of a Jamaica sugar planter. The marriage produced no children, but from the start was a very happy one. Dempster commented to Sir Adam Fergusson's brother, Charles, &#145;as for happiness I protest to you I did not know what it was till I was married&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 87). After his marriage he became increasingly disillusioned with parliament and spoke often of settling down as a farmer. This resulted, in the summer of 1788, in his resolving not to stand again for parliament, and though he participated in the 1788&#150;9 session he did not attend the final session the following year. His last major parliamentary activity was in autumn 1788 during the regency debates, when he opposed Pitt's proposed limitations on the prince of Wales's powers as regent. Dempster's last recorded speech was on 22 July 1789, in support of famine relief for Revolutionary France.<h2>
<a name="Tradeandindustry"></a>Trade and industry</h2>Dempster gained great fame among his Scottish countrymen for striving to advance Scottish commerce and manufactures. He tirelessly promoted the textile industry, first linen and later also cotton. In 1763, realizing that the lack of proper banking facilities was hampering trade in his native Forfarshire, Dempster founded the first bank in Dundee, under the name George Dempster &amp; Co., and it prospered sufficiently for a second bank to be established in Dundee in 1792. Despite the leading role he played in founding the bank, once it was established he withdrew from active involvement.<br>
<br>Dempster's greatest period of activity in the cause of the Scottish economy was in the 1780s, when he attempted to stem the growing tide of emigration to North America by transforming the wealth of the highlands and islands. Inspired by the reports of John Knox and James Anderson, Dempster conducted his own tour of the west highlands in January 1785, and became convinced that with encouragement the highland economy was capable of considerable advancement.<br>
<br>Improvements to the fisheries came first, and Dempster was instrumental in the setting up of a parliamentary inquiry, which led to two <span class="roman">Fisheries Acts</span>, of 1785 and 1786. These reformed the salt laws and other antiquated fisheries legislation, and established an incorporated company, the British Fisheries Society, to encourage the industry. Other measures included acts promoted by Dempster in 1787 and 1789 to found lighthouses on the Scottish coasts and to establish the Northern Lighthouse Board, and, about 1785, Dempster's suggestion of transporting fish preserved in ice rather than salt as hitherto, thus laying the foundation of the vast modern frozen food industry. As one of the directors he was from the outset a leading light in the British Fisheries Society, which established villages at Tobermory and Ullapool, and at Stein in Skye, to support fishermen and act as centres of economic growth. He took a particular interest in Ullapool and Stein, and also in another site not in the end selected, on Canna.<br>
<br>In the same period Dempster vigorously promoted the textile industry. In 1783 he encountered Richard Arkwright, the great cotton pioneer, and was so impressed with the mills at Cromford that he invited Arkwright to join him in establishing a mill in Scotland. Arkwright agreed to build mills at New Lanark in partnership with Dempster and the Glasgow merchant and manufacturer David Dale (1739&#150;1806). Building started in April 1785 and spinning commenced in March 1786. However, Dempster withdrew in December 1786 to concentrate on another venture, a cotton mill at Stanley, Perthshire, involving Arkwright and some Perth merchants. Construction here commenced in 1785 with production beginning early in 1786. The company experienced mixed fortunes and was finally dissolved in December 1799, with heavy losses for the partners.<br>
<br>Perceiving that the lack of good roads was an impediment to economic prosperity, in his later years Dempster promoted road building in both the highlands and the lowlands. The Ullapool to Dingwall road, built by the British Fisheries Society and connecting the east and west coasts, was the first such project in which Dempster was involved. He successfully steered the proposal through parliament in 1789, and the road was constructed between 1792 and 1794. In the 1780s and 1790s he campaigned for turnpike roads in Forfarshire, and he was instrumental in the proprietors' obtaining a <span class="roman">Turnpike Act</span> in 1789. By 1790 he was delightedly informing his correspondents of the commencement of the Arbroath to Forfar turnpike; during the next ten years further turnpikes were constructed linking all the main settlements of the region.<br>
<br>Dempster's efforts on behalf of the Scottish economy were recognized on 13 July 1786 by his being voted a piece of silver plate by the convention of royal burghs of Scotland.<h2>
<a name="Agriculturalimprovements"></a>Agricultural improvements</h2>From the time of his inheritance in 1754 Dempster displayed great interest and enjoyment in the management and improvement of his estate at Dunnichen. He found the tenants, as elsewhere in Scotland, in a state of wretched poverty, still bound by medieval codes of loyalty and servitude to their landlords, and the land divided up and farmed in accordance with the antiquated and inefficient runrig system. Reflecting contemporary enlightened opinion, he was determined to provide greater prosperity for both tenant and landlord by a reform of agricultural practices and the conditions under which tenants worked, and by the introduction of manufacturing industry.<br>
<br>Dempster commenced his improvements in 1761, and in the following year gave his tenants greater security by granting them leases for life, at the same time abolishing all personal services: thirlage to the mill and blacksmith's shop, carriage, and bonnage. These he felt especially strongly about, frequently inveighing against them in his correspondence. He substituted money rent for payment in kind, enclosed farms with freestone walls, and built proper houses to replace the hovels that existed formerly. The runrig system was replaced by crop rotation, and turnips and other crops were introduced for winter feed for cattle and horses, the breeds of both being progressively improved. Dempster's early efforts were driven more by enthusiasm than prudence, which forced him to retrench for a while, but by 1764 he was ready to start again. In 1768 he wrote to Edmund Burke:<blockquote>I am a farmer and a very serious one myself. &hellip; Of late the spirit of agriculture has gain'd ground amongst us [in Scotland]. I have been employ'd in it these last four years and hope in as many more to Quadruple the value of my six thousand Patrimonial Acres. (Dempster to Burke, 26 Sept 1768, Wentworth Woodhouse MS MF/76, 1/223)</blockquote>Dempster planted trees in vast numbers, hoping thereby to derive significant income. He devised incentives for the tenants to protect and nurture them, and this policy was very successful, the tenants even planting replacement trees when necessary. In January 1788 he commenced draining Loch Restenneth in order to extract shell-marl, a form of lime that was extremely valuable as fertilizer. The operation was completed in July, exposing a vast area of marl: Dempster, after meeting his own needs, profited hugely from sales&#151;estimated at &pound;14,000 over fourteen years.<br>
<br>Another ambitious project was the founding, in 1788, of a village at Letham, intended as a market town and centre for linen manufacture. In 1803 Dempster pioneered there a system of self-government based on a nine-member feuars' committee, which was to adjudicate in disputes and the affairs of the village. The members were to be chosen by a surprisingly modern method of secret voting invented by Dempster. This used grooved voting sticks in which a sliding tongue could be moved to indicate a &#145;yes&#146; or &#145;no&#146; vote; the system apparently survived until well into the twentieth century.<br>
<br>In July 1786 Dempster purchased the run-down estate of Skibo in Sutherland, 18,000 acres in area, and later added a number of smaller contiguous estates. He intended Skibo to be run by his half-brother, John Hamilton Dempster, a sea captain in the East India Company's service, on John's retirement from the sea. He also expected that Captain Dempster's son, on whom Dempster doted, would eventually inherit the estate.<br>
<br>These purchases also gave Dempster the opportunity to try out his agricultural improvements on a larger scale, and to demonstrate their viability and worth in the more extreme climatic conditions of the highlands. He hoped by his example to encourage other landowners to do likewise, thus complementing the British Fisheries Society's work. The basic strategy was the same as at Dunnichen: the tenants were granted long leases and relieved of personal services, and agricultural practices were reformed. As at Letham, Dempster granted his Skibo tenants a constitution and encouraged new settlers to become tenants of the estate, and devised a system of concessions and incentives to that end.<br>
<br>Dempster was eager to establish villages at Skibo, and having selected two sites, he established a small linen-weaving business at one and the more ambitious project of a cotton mill at the other. Both projects failed: the linen-weaving concern never amounted to much while the mill, completed in 1794, was burdened with heavy debts from the start and suffered from its remote location, and the highlanders found it difficult to adjust to long hours of mill work alien to their traditional life. In 1805 it was sold to a Glasgow cotton spinner and in 1806 was destroyed by fire and never rebuilt. However, the agricultural innovations were much more successful, enabling rents to be raised dramatically while Dempster gained great esteem from his reforming zeal.<h2>
<a name="Lateryears"></a>Later years</h2>In the 1790s Dempster suffered severe personal setbacks. His half-brother's wife and son both died of tuberculosis in the period 1798&#150;1801, and the captain himself drowned at sea in 1800. Skibo passed to John Hamilton Dempster's natural daughter, who returned from India with her husband to claim it. Dempster henceforth increasingly confined himself to Dunnichen and its environs, though this may have been from increasing infirmity due to age as much as from loss of spirit. At Dunnichen he remained energetic, in 1802 rebuilding the church there and in 1803 founding the Lunan and Vinney Farming Society, named after the two principal burns on the Dunnichen estate. The society was modelled on others founded at the same time, its only activity being the holding of an annual meeting, which involved a formal meal followed by speeches and convivial discussion on a wide range of matters relating to agricultural improvement. The membership, which reached a peak of about eighty, tended to be Dempster's friends and neighbours in the local farming and landowning community. He was elected president in perpetuity at the first meeting, and remained so until the society's eventual demise about 1815.<br>
<br>Dempster's wife, Rose, died on 10 July 1810, following which he began spending time at Broughty Ferry and St Andrews, at the latter encountering to his delight an old friend from his Edinburgh days, the philosopher Adam Ferguson. In St Andrews Dempster also befriended some old ladies with whom he played whist, a game of which he had always been fond. Nevertheless, by this time the deaths of most of his lifelong friends (Ferguson himself died in 1816) made his last years increasingly lonely. Towards the end of 1817 Dempster suffered a stroke, and he died at Dunnichen House on 13 February 1818. He was buried that month at Restenneth Priory, near Forfar.<br>
<br>Dempster is remembered best as an agricultural improver, but he spent half his adult life as a popular, very active, and conscientious independent whig MP, and gained great public renown through his efforts to promote Scottish trade and industry. His attractive and outgoing personality was marked by candour, enthusiasm for the causes he espoused, and a willingness to help others. He placed personal merit above rank and wealth, and commanded much affection, partly from his charming personality and partly from the altruism and integrity he displayed in public life. His reputation survived the use of bribery during elections&#151;which was, however, a normal part of public life in the eighteenth century.<br>
