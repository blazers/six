<span class="headword">Martindell <span class="st"> [Martindale, Martindall]</span>, Sir  Gabriel</span>  (1754/5&#150;1831), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, was probably born in India, the son of John Martindale (<i>d</i>. 1769), an officer in the Bengal army, and his wife, Lettice. Contemporary records suggest that he changed his name to Martindell. He may have grown up in part in Britain, as John, son of John and Lettice Martindale, probably Gabriel's brother, was baptized at St Peter's, Worcester, on 17 April 1757, and an obituary in the <span class="italic">Asiatic Journal</span> later reported that Gabriel travelled to India as a country cadet in the East India Company service in 1772. He certainly became a cadet in the company's Bengal army at a very young age, attached to the &#145;select picket&#146; while awaiting the commission that was awarded him in 1776. In November 1798, having spent much of his service in Bengal European regiments, he was given command of the newly raised 2nd battalion 13th native infantry which became known as Martdeel-ki-paltan (&#145;Martindell's battalion&#146;). He served with distinction in the Second Anglo-Maratha War, taking command in turbulent Bundelkhand and driving out the Pindaris (irregular bands of marauders). He defeated Raja Ram Singh on 2 July 1804, and took Jaipur by storm on 28 July. Martindell earned the &#145;approbation and applause&#146; of the governor-general for his success, and more especially for capturing the fort of Ajaigarh in 1809  (BL OIOC, F/4/325).<br>
<br>However, Martindell's unsuccessful attack on the hill fort of Kalinjar in Bundelkhand in 1812 entailed heavy casualties, and his failure to fulfil orders when leading a force into Rewah in 1813 led to his resigning his command in March 1814 and to a posting to Cawnpore. These reverses seem to have drained him of self-confidence and drive. Lord Moira, governor-general and commander-in-chief, appointed Martindell to command the 2nd field division of the Bengal army in the Anglo-Nepal War of 1814&#150;16. He did so mainly because of &#145;the difficulty of finding any other unemployed officer of rank sufficient to exercise so large a command&#146;, but also in &#145;the hope that the occurrences attending his command in Rewa &hellip; would stimulate him to exert himself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Papers Respecting the Nepaul War</span>, 737). Martindell assumed his command in the Sirmur hills on 19 December 1814, finding morale low following the death of his predecessor, Major-General Robert Gillespie, who had been killed while leading a reckless and unsupported charge at Kalanga, near Dehra Dun. Martindell delayed and dithered, to the frustration of his officers and his commander-in-chief. His incompetence brought disaster, causing William Fraser, the governor-general's political agent, to write to his brother Alexander &#145;I cannot tell you how much General [Martindell's] management is scorned and reviled by the army for indecision, want of promptness, energy and enterprise&#146;  (Fraser MSS, National Register of Archives for Scotland 2696, xxxiv, 254). Martindell's eventual offer to resign was overtaken by the victory of Major-General David Ochterlony at Malaun which brought the first campaign of the war to an end. Both officers were made KCB in April 1815.<br>
<br>Martindell was sent with a strong force in 1816 to quell a rising in Cuttack in Orissa, and in 1818 commanded a column in the Third Anglo-Maratha War. From 1820 he commanded the 1st division Bengal field army until 1824 when he was made divisional commander Cawnpore. In September 1824, at Chunar, Bishop Reginald Heber met Martindell, whom he described as &#145;a fine, mild, unaffected old officer&#146;  (Heber, 1.173). Seniority having long been the paramount consideration for promotion in the Bengal army, Martindell was made lieutenant-general in 1825. In 1827 he was given command of the fortress of Buxar where, still serving, he died on 2 January 1831, aged seventy-six. He was buried in Buxar cemetery.<br>
<br>Martindell may have married in 1777, though further details are obscure. The application for letters of administration following his death described him as a bachelor. However, he is known to have had at least seventeen children, presumably with one or more Indian mistresses, who probably included Mary Umdah (<i>c</i>.1781&#150;1831), described as &#145;a native Christian&#146;  (NAM, V. C. P. Hodson's card index). In the later years of his life his family lived at his house in Cawnpore, originally built for Lord Moira. Of his seven sons known to have reached adulthood, John (1781&#150;1852), Charles (1785&#150;1846), William (1787&#150;1849), and Robert (1796&#150;1835) were commissioned as local lieutenants in the Bengal cavalry; John, Robert, Henry (1783&#150;1840), and Gabriel William (<i>c</i>.1812&#150;1855) also had administrative careers in India, while James (1791&#150;1830) was a landowner in Cawnpore. Two of his four daughters, Mary and Jane, were at school when their father died; another, Harriet (1796&#150;1826), married one of Martindell's aides-de-camp, John Stuart Rotton, and had five children. His youngest child was Alexander (1828&#150;1829). Henry Martindell had inscribed on his father's tomb in Buxar cemetery, &#145;He was an affectionate father, a kind friend, and his charities knew no bounds.&#146;  (&#145;List of old inscriptions&#146;) The inventory of his estate suggests that he lived in comfort in his old age, even if he was not possessed of a large fortune.<br>
