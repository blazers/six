<span class="headword">White,  Terence Hanbury</span>  (1906&#150;1964), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 29 May 1906 in Bombay, the only child of Garrick Hanbury White, a district superintendent of police in the Indian police service, and his wife, Constance Edith Southcote Aston, the daughter of a judge on the Indian circuit. His parents later divorced, and at the age of five White was sent to England to be brought up by his maternal grandparents in St Leonards, Sussex. In 1920 he went to Cheltenham College, where the terrifying beatings had a permanent effect on his sexual development. In 1925 he went up to Queens' College, Cambridge, to read English. He obtained a second class (division two) in part one of the English tripos (1927) and a first class with distinction in part two (1929).<br>
<br>After contracting tuberculosis White spent a year in Italy thanks to a fund raised by his tutor and lifelong friend, L. J. Potts, and he began to write a satirical novel, later published as <span class="italic">They Winter Abroad</span> (1932), under the pseudonym James Aston. He returned to Cambridge and completed his degree course in 1929, submitting a thesis on Malory's <span class="italic">Morte d' Arthur</span>. In the same year he published <span class="italic">Loved Helen, and other Poems</span>, started in 1926. For two years he taught at St David's, a preparatory school in Reigate, before being appointed head of the English department at Stowe School in 1932 by the school's headmaster, J. F. Roxburgh. White excelled in this role and for the rest of his life retained many of the attributes of the old-fashioned schoolmaster. He was a bachelor with sadistic fantasies, melancholy and prone to drinking bouts, but with an enormous capacity for new interests and enthusiasms. (&#145;The best thing for being sad&#146;, Merlyn says in <span class="italic">The Sword in the Stone</span>, 1938, &#145;is to learn something.&#146;) It was during his Stowe years (1932&#150;6) that White took flying lessons and acquired his passion for hunting, shooting, and fishing. Two early novels (<span class="italic">Earth Stopped</span>, 1934, and <span class="italic">Gone to ground</span>, 1935), the satirical <span class="italic">Burke's Steerage</span> (1938), and <span class="italic">England have my Bones</span> (1936) all have hunting and shooting themes. When he resigned from Stowe in 1936 in order to become a full-time writer, White spent two years in a cottage near the school at Stowe Ridings where he fell in love with a young girl, and experimented with falconry, describing the latter episode in his most successful book, <span class="italic">The Goshawk</span> (1951).<br>
<br>In 1938 White published <span class="italic">The Sword in the Stone</span>, selected by the American Book of the Month Club, the first instalment of what was to become an Arthurian tetralogy entitled <span class="italic">The Once and Future King</span> (1958). It was a brilliantly imaginative, and in parts satirical, account of the boyhood of King Arthur, loosely based on the work of Sir Thomas Malory. White put himself into the character of Merlyn, passing on to the young king his knowledge of wildlife and hunting. He wrote the second instalment, <span class="italic">The Witch in the Wood</span> (1940), in Ireland, where he spent a fishing holiday at the beginning of 1939, invited by the novelist David Garnett, his mentor and friend. In the event he stayed there for six years, immersing himself in the special atmosphere of rural Ireland, which he found greatly sympathetic. At one time he half-seriously intended to become a Catholic. White's Irish impressions are to be found in <span class="italic">The Godstone and the Blackymor</span> (1959), illustrated by Edward Ardizzone, and <span class="italic">The Elephant and the Kangaroo</span> (1948), a fantasy about a second flood, with White as Noah.<br>
<br>White agonized about helping the war effort and in 1941 applied to join the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve but his attempts failed, thereby exacerbating his sense of guilt and isolation. It was then that he decided to turn his Arthurian series into a satirical pamphlet attempting to establish the bases for a peaceful society: &#145;I have suddenly discovered that the central theme of <span class="italic">Morte d'Arthur</span> is to find an antidote to war&#146;  (letter to L. J. Potts, Gallix, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 117). Calling himself a &#145;Nostalgic Tory&#146;, he abhorred the post-war labour government and in 1947, after a surprise windfall of &pound;15,000 when his children's book <span class="italic">Mistress Masham's Repose</span> (1946) was chosen as the book of the month in the USA, exiled himself in Alderney, one of the Channel Islands.<br>
<br>White completed two books of historical essays, <span class="italic">The Age of Scandal</span> (1950) and <span class="italic">The Scandalmonger</span> (1952), a translation of a medieval bestiary (<span class="italic">The Book of Beasts</span>, 1954), on which he had laboured for seventeen years, and his &#145;Stevenson book for children&#146;, <span class="italic">The Master</span>, in 1957. In 1959 <span class="italic">The Once and Future King</span> was adapted for the stage as a musical called <span class="italic">Camelot</span>, by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe. Starring Richard Burton and Julie Andrews, it opened in New York on Broadway and was an immediate hit. It was followed by Walt Disney's successful cartoon <span class="italic">The Sword in the Stone</span> (1963). This sudden acquisition of wealth finally put an end to White's writing career and he became more and more morose. In 1962, he published a limited edition of 100 copies of <span class="italic">Verses</span> (privately printed). Following a highly successful three-month lecture tour of America in 1962, described in <span class="italic">America at Last</span> (1965), he was found dead in his cabin on 17 January 1964 at the port of Piraeus while crossing the Mediterranean. He was buried in the protestant cemetery in Athens on 20 January. He was unmarried.<br>
<br>White was a tall, distinguished, bearded figure, &#145;looking like one of the Sikhs at Queen Victoria's funeral&#146; (his own description). As the child of a drunkard father and a hysterical over-possessive mother he suffered all his life from sadistic impulses, guilt, and irrational fears. He was a natural recluse who found most human relationships difficult, and was deeply attached to his dogs. However, until his final period, he rose triumphantly above his handicaps. He was a master stylist, a sharp, satirical observer of the social scene with an unfailing capacity for taking up a variety of interests, and the ability to persuade his readers to share his enthusiasms, however out-of-the-way. The great success of the posthumous publication of <span class="italic">The Book of Merlyn</span> (1977)&#151;which was on the <span class="italic">New York Times</span> bestseller list for twenty-four weeks&#151;marks the beginning of a fairer appreciation of his novels in which intertextuality plays a very important part.<br>
