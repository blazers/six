<span class="headword">Towgood,  Michaijah</span>  (1700&#150;1792), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and religious controversialist</span>, was born on 17 December 1700 at Axminster, the second son of Matthew Towgood MD (<i>d</i>. 1715) and the grandson of Matthew Toogood, an ejected minister. He attended Thomas Chadwick's Grammar School at Taunton with Thomas Amory (1701&#150;1774) until 25 March 1717. They were both educated for the nonconformist ministry at Taunton Academy under Stephen James and Henry Grove.<br>
<br>On the death of Angel Spark in October 1721, Towgood succeeded him as minister of the Presbyterian meeting at Moreton Hampstead, Devon, where he was ordained on 22 August 1722 under the authority of the Exeter assembly. The charge by John Withers was afterwards published. Towgood fell ill with what was feared to be consumption, but he recovered and devoted himself systematically to pastoral work. He maintained a religious exercise in his own house, engaged in regular pastoral visiting, and catechized the children of the town by rotation. As a result of the Exeter controversy Towgood came to examine the doctrine of the Trinity, and became convinced that &#145;the commonly received opinion&#146; could not reasonably be considered a fundamental article of faith, especially as it was not required by scripture. &#145;He did not call in question its truth, but the subject seemed to him so abstruse and difficult, that he could not imagine God had made the salvation of men&#146; to depend upon holding it exactly  (Manning, 9). He therefore suspended his judgement. Originally orthodox, in time he became a high Arian, still regarding Christ as a proper object of worship. On 28 May 1723 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1759), the daughter of James Hawker of Luppit. They had four children, but only a daughter survived him. His son Matthew (1732&#150;1791), educated at Bridgwater under John Moore, was minister at Bridgwater (1747&#150;55), and afterwards a merchant and, ultimately (1773), a banker in London. He was a manager of the Presbyterian Fund (1773&#150;91) and a trustee of Dr Williams's Trust (1780&#150;91). Matthew died in January 1791, and his son, John, also a banker, succeeded him as a Dr Williams's trustee (1791&#150;1837).<br>
<br>At Christmas 1736 Towgood accepted a call to Crediton, Devon, to succeed Josiah Eveleigh who had died in September 1736. He maintained there the same vigorous pastoral ministry. Shortly afterwards he published his first work in defence of dissenting principles, <span class="italic">High-Flown Episcopal and Priestly Claims Freely Examin'd</span> (1737), followed by <span class="italic">The Dissenters Apology</span> (1739). His reputation was established with <span class="italic">The Dissenting Gentleman's Answer</span> (1746) in reply to the charge of schism made by John White, perpetual curate of Nayland, Suffolk, which became a classic digest of nonconformist argument. In response to White's replies he published <span class="italic">The Dissenting Gentleman's Second Letter to &hellip; Mr White</span> (1747) and <span class="italic">The Dissenting Gentleman's Third Letter to &hellip; Mr White</span> (1748). These three letters went through many editions and were abridged by Towgood as a <span class="italic">Dissent from the Church of England Fully Justified</span> (1753; 11th edn, 1809) and also as <span class="italic">A Calm and Plain Answer</span> (1772, 1798). Anglicans were still trying to refute the arguments more than fifty years after the original was published. He also published a number of practical works. His <span class="italic">Recovery from Sickness</span> (1743) was reprinted many times in Britain and America. His <span class="italic">Baptism of Infants, a Reasonable Service</span> (1750) and <span class="italic">Dipping not the Only Scriptural and Primitive Manner of Baptizing</span> (1751) were more controversial and provoked responses from Grantham Killingworth and John Gill. He was the author of three papers in <span class="italic">The Old Whig</span> (1739) under the pseudonym Paulus.<br>
<br>In 1750, following the death of James Green, Towgood was chosen joint minister of James's Meeting in Exeter with his first cousin, Stephen Towgood. With John Lavington and John Walrond of Bow Meeting, Exeter, the four ministers preached to the two united congregations in rotation. Opposing all religious tests, Towgood persuaded James's Meeting to drop the formal account of faith required of candidates for admission to communion. As a consequence Bow Meeting would allow its own ministers to officiate only in the latter. But Towgood was ideally suited to oversee the doctrinal changes in his congregation. A less charitable man would have brought about a secession of one party or the other. He published for the use of James's Meeting a <span class="italic">Collection of Psalms and Hymns</span> (1757), with the second edition in 1779, which was extensively used by other Presbyterian congregations.<br>
<br>In 1760 James's Meeting was replaced by a new chapel in South Street, called George's Meeting after George III. The same year Towgood helped establish an academy at Exeter following the closure in October 1759 of the nonconformist academy at Taunton. There he taught biblical exegesis. It closed in December 1771 on the death of the divinity tutor, Samuel Merivale. The academy was briefly revived under Timothy Kenrick, Towgood's successor at George's Meeting. The names of forty-eight students are known, but only twelve entered the ministry; the majority entered trade or the professions. They included two future ministers of George's Meeting, Joseph Bretland and Merivale's stepson, James Manning. Towgood resigned as minister in 1782, when he was presented with a magnificent silver cup by the two congregations, engraved &#145;in testimony of respect&#146; for Towgood's &#145;eminent and faithful service &hellip; during the course of more than thirty years&#146;  (Manning, 74). He was a person &#145;above the middle size, and extremely slender; his eye lively and penetrating. &hellip; He had, in early life, a little impediment in his speech, but he almost entirely conquered this defect&#146;  (ibid.). On 26 February 1791 he had a stroke which affected his speech. He died in Exeter on 1 February 1792. His portrait by John Opie and the silver cup were presented by his great-grandson to Dr Williams's Trust. The cup is displayed at the trustees' dinner after every general meeting of the trust.<br>

<a name="cosubject_27594"></a><span class="headword">Matthew Towgood</span>  (<em>c.</em>1690&#150;1757), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and tutor</span>, was the eldest son of Stephen Towgood (<i>d</i>. 1722), dissenting minister at Axminster, and the first cousin of Michaijah Towgood. His place of education is unknown, but he kept an academy first at Colyton, where he also assisted the minister, Samuel Short, and then at Shepton Mallet, offering a classical and theological education. It has been suggested that it was a continuation of the academy established at Lyme Regis by Samuel Short's brother John, and brought by him to Colyton some time before 1698.<br>
<br>In 1715 Towgood was minister at Wilton, Wiltshire, but moved to the much larger congregation at Shepton Mallet, Somerset, in 1716, where he was ordained on 24 October. According to the <span class="roman">Evans List</span> there were 700 hearers in 1715. Something of his religious sentiments is evident from his willingness to allow the ordination of the avowed Arian Hubert Stogdon to take place in his meeting-house in August 1718. He continued the academy, and among his students was William West, minister of the Mint Meeting, Exeter (1744&#150;61). In 1729 he moved to Poole to become assistant to William Madgwick, on whose death in 1734 he became sole minister. He quarrelled, however, with those members who, in order to qualify under the <span class="roman">Corporation Act</span>, were occasional conformists. In 1739 he preached a bitter sermon from <span class="roman">Proverbs</span> 26: 11 directed against them. They locked him out, and he and his supporters established a new meeting, which they registered in March 1739, but it lasted but a few years. Towgood received a grant of &pound;10 a year from the Presbyterian Fund between 1741 and 1743, but in March 1744 it was &#145;not paid for this time&#146;, probably because he had left the ministry and moved to Swanage. He became a brewer, but &#145;by his habits of study, he was ill-qualified for trade, and did not succeed in it&#146;  (Toulmin, 242). He supplied Wimborne, Dorset, but refused an invitation to become minister. Shortly afterwards, in 1753, he became minister of Swanage, where he remained until his death in 1757. He was buried in St James's parish, Poole, on 24 June 1757. He published a defence of William Nation, the Presbyterian minister of Puddington, who had attacked the orthodox sentiments of the four Exeter ministers over the doctrine of the Trinity. In 1734 he published <span class="italic">A Letter to the Reverend Dr Waterland</span>, who became involved in the reappearance of the earlier Exeter controversy of 1718. He is remembered principally for his <span class="italic">Remarks on the Profane and Absurd Use of the Monosyllable Damn</span> (1746).<br>
