<span class="headword">Wallace,  Thomas</span>, Baron Wallace  (1768&#150;1844), <span class="occ">politician</span>, only son of James Wallace, barrister (afterwards solicitor- and attorney-general under Lord North to George III), and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter and heir of Thomas Simpson, Carleton Hall, Cumberland, was born at Brampton, Cumberland. He was educated at Eton College (1777&#150;84) and Christ Church, Oxford, where he was the contemporary and associate of the earl of Liverpool and of George Canning. He graduated MA on 18 March 1790 and DCL on 5 July 1793. At the general election in 1790 Wallace was elected MP for Grampound, which he held until 1796. His subsequent constituencies were: Penrhyn (1796&#150;1802), Hindon (1802&#150;6), Shaftesbury (1807&#150;12), Weymouth (1812&#150;13), Cockermouth (1813&#150;18), and Weymouth again (1818&#150;28). He was from the first a Pittite, except for his strong opposition to Catholic emancipation. In July 1797 he was appointed to a seat at the Admiralty, from which he was removed in May 1800 to become one of the commissioners for the affairs of India. When Pitt retired in 1801, Wallace continued to hold office under his successor, Addington, and was made a privy councillor on 21 May 1801. When Pitt resumed office in 1804, Wallace was included in the new government, and he went with the Pittites who opposed the Grenville ministry in 1806. He resumed his commissionership in 1807, holding it until 1816 but without the promotion to the peerage for which he yearned and which his family had failed to gain owing to his father's early death. Having resigned in 1816 after not becoming president of the Board of Control, Wallace accepted in 1818 the vice-presidency of the Board of Trade. Chairing the various committees on foreign trade between 1820 and 1824 gained him a reputation, and his work for the committees and their subsequent legislative proposals marked the formal start of the movement towards &#145;free trade&#146;  (Hilton, 173).<br>
<br>In April 1823 Wallace was succeeded by William Huskisson at the Board of Trade, but was soon appointed chairman of the committee inquiring into irregularities and abuses in the Irish revenue. The recommendations of the committee were adopted. In October 1823 he was appointed master of the Royal Mint, a post that he held until the change of administration in May 1827, and in May 1825 he successfully proposed the assimilation of the currencies of England and Ireland. Canning pressed him to join his government, but he refused. On the death of Canning he finally gained a peerage (on 2 February 1828), as Baron Wallace of Knaresdale.<br>
<br>Wallace married, on 16 February 1814, Jane, sixth daughter of John Hope, second earl of Hopetoun, and second wife of Henry Dundas, first Viscount Melville. The marriage was childless; Jane died on 9 June 1829. Wallace lived at his seat, Featherstone Castle, Northumberland, and died there on 23 February 1844, the peerage becoming extinct and the estates going to the Hope family.<br>
