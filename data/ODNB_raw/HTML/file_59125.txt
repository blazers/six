<span class="headword">Du Sautoy,  Peter Francis</span>  (1912&#150;1995), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born at 29 Hagley Road, Halesowen, Worcestershire, on 19 February 1912, the son of Edward Frank Du Sautoy, mechanical engineer and brick manufacturer, and his wife, Mabel Emmeline Annie Howse. His father served with distinction in the First World War and became a colonel in the army. He was educated at Uppingham School and Wadham College, Oxford, where he was a senior classical scholar and took a first in Greats. His literary interests were not reflected in any way in his family background. After a brief spell as a private tutor, and then as an assistant master at Newcastle under Lyme grammar school, he worked in the department of printed books at the British Museum with Angus Wilson in 1935, and then in the city of Oxford education department for three years. On 18 December 1937 he married Phyllis Mary 
    (known as Mollie; <i>b</i>. 1910/11)
  , daughter of Sir Francis Floud. They had two sons. He served with the RAF during the Second World War.<br>
<br>In 1946 Du Sautoy joined the publishers Faber and Faber; his aptitude for administration quickly led to his becoming general manager of the company. The founders and directors of the firm&#151;Geoffrey Faber, Richard de la Mare, and T. S. Eliot, all literary figures and writers in their own right&#151;devolved much of the responsibility for running the business onto him. He was promoted to the board later in the same year, and he took over the development of their activities in the United States, and the rights and contracts portfolios. Although he enjoyed the literary atmosphere of the firm and the meetings of the book committee, he also gave his time to other sides of the Faber list (which provided much of their profits), such as medicine and nursing, so that this shy and fastidious man sometimes found himself at nursing exhibitions, selling books on gynaecology to midwives. During his early years with Faber, he was reticent on policy matters, accepting the decisions of his eminent colleagues. He kept up a voluminous correspondence with authors, but did not try to write creatively himself, observing on occasion that a publisher had to be more of a politician than an artist. But from the beginning he involved himself in editorial work, taking a particular interest in the poetry list, and he succeeded Eliot as poetry editor. When he became vice-chairman of the firm in 1960, and chairman in 1971, he felt more free to decide the character of the house, and to introduce more variety into the catalogue. He expanded the juvenile list, and started Faber Music, which was run by a new generation of musical scholars, notably Donald Mitchell, who brought Benjamin Britten's music to the firm. Du Sautoy commented that the atmosphere of this new branch was akin to the excitement of the early days of Faber in literature.<br>
<br>Du Sautoy was trusted by both writers and publishers, and faithfully carried out his instructions where he was given posthumous responsibility. He destroyed T. S. Eliot's private correspondence after the poet's death, as he had been asked to do, to the great chagrin of Eliot's biographers. He also administered the estates of Ezra Pound and James Joyce, and was involved in textual controversies over the latter. A strong supporter of the net book agreement, which for most of the twentieth century protected publishers and booksellers from competition, thereby ensuring a rich literary culture and enabling slower-selling books to remain longer in print, he gave evidence in 1962 before the restrictive practices court, and was active in many book-trade causes. On behalf of the Publishers' Association he travelled with many delegations to other countries. For these activities he received the OBE in 1964 and the CBE in 1971.<br>
<br>Du Sautoy retired from active participation in the firm in 1975, although he remained chairman until 1977. He was sometimes asked to arbitrate in disputes that arose among other publishers who did not want to go to law. He was eminently fair and imaginative in such matters, and proved that he would have made an excellent judge. He retired to Aldeburgh in Suffolk where he became an active member of the Aldeburgh Festival committee, which enabled him to indulge his taste for music, and brought his talent for decision making once again into play. He chaired conferences and lectures there, and derived great pleasure from the many activities of the festival, which went through a difficult period after Britten's death in 1976: Du Sautoy's firm presence on the board was a major, but under-appreciated, factor in the festival's survival. He also played a part in literary events in Suffolk, and became president of the Ipswich and Suffolk Book League. He died at his home, 31 Lee Road, Aldeburgh, on 17 July 1995, survived by his wife. He left an extensive correspondence and a number of penetrating essays, and a reputation as one of the last of the gentlemen publishers.<br>
