</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Austin,  William</span>  (1721/1733&#150;1820), <span class="occ">drawing-master and engraver</span>, was apprenticed to George Bickham junior in 1747. This suggests that he was born about 1733, although he was said to have died aged ninety-eight, and a man named Austin was listed as an eminent painter in 1748. In 1756 Austin launched his career with proposals for a pair of landscape prints after Zuccarelli and Gainsborough, a drawing-book, and a series of prints imitating drawings&#151;all calculated to advertise his ability as a teacher of drawing and etching, which soon became his principal occupation. Meanwhile he engraved a number of good landscapes and some captivating rococo subscription tickets, including one for the carver Thomas Johnson, some of whose designs he also etched. By April 1757 he was associated with Gerard Vandergucht in a picture shop at the Golden Head in George Street, Hanover Square, London. He advertised himself as &#145;from Mr. Major&#146;  (Anderton catalogues, vol. 1, p. 122), suggesting a background of recent employment with the engraver Thomas Major.<br>
<br>Austin and Vandergucht continued in partnership until 1763, when Austin set up on his own at the Print Warehouse in Bond Street, where he claimed to have a stock of some 30,000 imported foreign prints, drawings, and etchings. He also cleaned and repaired paintings and kept a printing press to run off urgent work. In November 1767, however, he announced that he was quitting business and that his prints were to be sold by auction. Teaching drawing now became Austin's principal occupation. Later he issued a printed list of the names of 308 pupils since 1768, a list extended in pencil to 400.<br>
<br>Austin's most arresting and original work was designed to demonstrate his mastery of another fashionable skill that was taught to amateurs: caricature. <span class="italic">Nature Display'd both Serious and Comic</span>, a set of twelve etchings published in 1773 and dedicated to the satirical actor and dramatist Samuel Foote, contains some of the most vivacious of early English caricatures. Several mocked well-known personalities, just as Foote did on stage. In response, perhaps, Austin himself was attacked in caricature by Matthew Darly, a rival drawing-master who had made caricature his speciality. Austin continued to teach from a bewildering variety of fashionable addresses in Westminster, the western suburbs, and Brighton. In the mid-1780s, around the time of the hotly contested Westminster elections, he re-emerged as a publisher and printseller. Between 1784 and 1790 he issued a series of prints and terracotta busts of whig grandees. He has been identified as the subject of another caricature of this date entitled <span class="italic">Fox's Fool</span>. Austin died on 11 May 1820 in Brighton, and was described by his obituarist as, &#145;in his 99th year &hellip; of eccentric memory, well known to the electors of Westminster some years ago, for his singular exertion in support of Mr Fox, when a candidate for that City&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>). A collection of Austin's political prints is in the John Johnson Collection in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.<br>
