<span class="headword">Wenlock,  John</span>, first Baron Wenlock  (<em>d.</em> 1471), <span class="occ">diplomat, administrator, and speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was the second son of William Wenlock (<i>d</i>. in or after 1415), a Bedfordshire landowner, and his wife, Margaret Briton. John Wenlock inherited the family properties in 1429, following the death of his elder brother, Sir Thomas Wenlock. Before then he served in France under Henry V, and in 1422 was constable of Vernon-sur-Seine (Eure). Appropriately for a future diplomat, he proved adroit in securing powerful patrons at home; the first of these was Sir John Cornewall, Lord Fanhope (<i>d</i>. 1443), a royal kinsman and Bedfordshire magnate, whom Wenlock was to support during the 1430s in a series of confrontations with Reynold, Lord Grey of Ruthin, and whose executor Wenlock later became. By then Wenlock was an usher in the king's chamber, and had begun to be active as a diplomat; closely identified with the peace policy of the duke of Suffolk, he took part from 1441 in the exchanges that in 1444 culminated in a two-year truce with France and, at a ceremony at Tours which Wenlock attended, in the betrothal of Henry VI to Margaret of Anjou. His rewards for his services included a number of offices on former Beauchamp estates in south Wales, and appointment as usher, and later as chamberlain, to the queen. Wenlock was knighted in 1447, while in the following year, when granted the office of constable of Bamburgh Castle, he was described as a &#145;king's knight&#146;. Despite his membership of the royal household and association with Suffolk, he escaped attack by Cade's rebels in 1450, and managed to gain exemption from that year's <span class="roman">Act of Resumption</span>. He sat as knight of the shire for Bedfordshire in six parliaments during Henry VI's reign&#151;those of 1433, 1437, 1439&#150;40, 1447, 1449, and 1455&#150;6.<br>
<br>During the 1450s Wenlock's loyalty to Lancaster seems to have diminished somewhat; he probably shared the disgust felt by many veteran soldiers at the mismanagement of the French wars, and he had great difficulty in obtaining repayment of a substantial loan made to the crown in 1449. A letter from Henry VI, probably dating from 1453, castigated him for partiality to the duke of York, and suspended him from his office of queen's chamberlain while he went on pilgrimage. Although Wenlock fought for the king at St Albans in 1455 and was wounded, being afterwards carried &#145;in a carte sore hurt&#146;  (Gairdner, <span class="italic">Paston Letters</span>, 1.331), he may have owed his election as speaker of the Commons in 1455 to his not being firmly allied to either side; indeed, at that time he was associated in the foundation of a chantry at Staines, Middlesex, with John Bourchier, Lord Berners, a member of a family that favoured reconciliation. That in 1458 he went as an envoy with Viscount Bourchier and the Neville earls of Warwick and Salisbury to treat with Burgundy over breaches of a truce may point to further links with York, but he was ostensibly more impartially employed in late 1458 and early 1459, when he headed an embassy to arrange marriages for the prince of Wales, the earl of March (York's eldest son), and the duke of Somerset's son with either French or Burgundian princesses. But no marriages were negotiated, and in October 1459 Wenlock declared himself for York by joining the duke at Ludlow. He subsequently followed Warwick and March to Calais, sharing their penalties of attainder and forfeiture.<br>
<br>In 1460 Wenlock took part in two raids on Sandwich, and then in the siege of the Tower of London, and early in 1461 he fought for the Yorkist cause at Mortimer's Cross, Ferrybridge, and Towton. At a time when that cause enjoyed limited support from the nobility and gentry, Wenlock's military skills, continental contacts, and diplomatic experience were great assets to Edward IV, and he received rich rewards for his desertion of Henry VI. He was appointed chief butler, chamberlain of the duchy of Lancaster, and steward of the duchy of Cornwall, and elected a knight of the Garter, while on 26 July 1461 he was summoned to parliament as Lord Wenlock. He also received numerous grants of wardships and custodies, and was given many of the estates of Chief Justice Sir John Fortescue. He continued to serve as a diplomat, playing a major part in negotiations that in the early 1460s led to a truce between England and France and the withdrawal of Scottish aid from the Lancastrian exiles. Not surprisingly, a series of deputies had to be appointed to carry out some of Wenlock's duties as butler, since he had &#145;not leisure to attend to the same&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1461&#150;7</i>, 332).<br>
<br>Wenlock continued to be associated with Warwick in the embassies of the mid-1460s which treated with France over the question of Edward IV's marriage, and in a letter to the Franco-Burgundian agent Jean de Lannoy he expressed his disgust at the king's secret marriage to Elizabeth Woodville; this reverse, and his developing affiliation to Warwick, may explain his ultimate lapse of judgement in deserting Edward. In 1468 Wenlock's servant John Hawkins seems to have incriminated his master, along with other prominent Yorkists, in dealings with the Lancastrians. Yet Edward continued to show him favour, justifiably, it must have seemed, when in April 1470 Wenlock, as deputy captain of Calais, refused to admit a now rebellious Warwick into the town. Edward rewarded him by making him lieutenant of Calais, but a few months later, during the readeption of Henry VI, Wenlock is said by the Burgundian chronicler Commines to have encouraged Warwick to send several hundred men into the town, whose allegiance was thus swiftly transferred to Lancaster. Remaining in France, Wenlock joined Margaret of Anjou, and with her crossed to England in April 1471, but on 4 May was killed in the battle of Tewkesbury. A local chronicle notes that his body was &#145;take fro hens to be buryed&#146;  (Kingsford, 377).<br>
<br>Wenlock's place of burial is unknown, though he had doubtless intended to be buried in the Wenlock chapel at St Mary's Church, Luton, which he extensively renovated in the 1460s in memory of his first wife, Elizabeth Drayton; the widow of Christopher Preston, she was probably married to Wenlock about 1441. She was dead by March 1466, and in 1468 Wenlock married Agnes Danvers, widow of Sir John Fray, who outlived him, and married Sir John Say of Broxbourne. Wenlock's changes of allegiance seem to have earned him a reputation for shiftiness and time-serving, but the suggestion that he was so widely distrusted that he was seldom called upon to act as a feoffee or executor is hardly borne out by the surviving evidence, which shows him to have been quite frequently employed in those capacities, and it is likely that his political movements were largely responses to changing circumstances, and were no more unprincipled than those of most of his contemporaries. Whatever the motives for his actions, he left little in the way of memorial to them. There were no children of either of his marriages, and his heir, had his possessions not been forfeited, would have been a remote cousin, one Thomas Lawley.<br>
