<span class="headword">Meadows,  Drinkwater</span>  (1793<span class="mult">x</span>9&#150;1869), <span class="occ">actor</span>, is said to have been born in Yorkshire in 1799, though his gravestone suggests that he was born in 1793 or 1794. He was intended for the navy but joined a theatrical company established in Kendal, and played in various towns in Westmorland and Yorkshire. Subsequently he became a member of another company, playing in Lincoln, Leicester, Peterborough, and Birmingham, in which town he was seen and engaged by Charlton, the manager of the Bath theatre. Meadows made his first appearance at Bath in November 1817 as Fogrum, in Morton and Bishop's musical drama <span class="italic">The Slave</span>. He later played a wide variety of roles, including Scrub in <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span>, Adam Winterton in <span class="italic">The Iron Chest</span>, Solomon Lob in <span class="italic">Love Laughs at Locksmiths</span>, and in 1819&#150;20, Ratcliffe in <span class="italic">The Heart of Midlothian</span>, First Gravedigger in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> to Kean's Hamlet, and Slender in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>. In September 1821 he made his first appearance in London, at Covent Garden, as Scrub. Here he played his old characters, and was also seen as Crabtree in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> and Filch in <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>. In following seasons he was given plenty of opportunities to play original roles, such as Timothy Quaint in Howard Payne's <span class="italic">The Soldier's Daughter</span> and Raubvogel in Planch&eacute;'s <span class="italic">Returned Killed</span>, as well as such parts in revivals as Launcelot Gobbo in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, Shallow in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>, Stephen in Jonson's <span class="italic">Every Man in his Humour</span>, and Squire Richard in Cibber's <span class="italic">The Provoked Husband</span>.<br>
<br>Meadows remained at Covent Garden until 1844, being the original Fathom in Sheridan Knowles's <span class="italic">The Hunchback</span> in 1832 and the following year the original Bartolo in <span class="italic">The Wife</span> by the same author. In 1836 he was the original Philippe in George W. Lovell's <span class="italic">The Provost of Bruges</span> at Drury Lane, but then returned to Covent Garden, where in September 1842 he made a success as a miserly old clerk in Lovell's <span class="italic">Love's Sacrifice</span> and played one of the witches in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>. On 18 July 1842 he married, at the British embassy in Paris, Georgina Caroline Pridham, the youngest daughter of Admiral Pridham; they had two sons. In 1844 Meadows acted under the management of the Keeleys at the Lyceum (1844&#150;7), and remained there under the succeeding management of C. Mathews. After joining the Kean and Keeley management at the Princess's he was Boaz in Douglas Jerrold's <span class="italic">The Prisoner of War</span>, first given at Windsor Castle, under Charles Kean's direction, in January 1851; and the original Joe Harrup, a toothless old huntsman, in Boucicault's <span class="italic">Love in a Maze</span>. He remained at the Princess's under Harris until his retirement in 1862. He died at his home, Prairie Cottage, The Green, Barnes, on 12 June 1869, and was buried in Barnes cemetery on 17 June. A careful, retiring man, shunning publicity, he was much respected but little noticed. While he was a careful, conscientious, and trustworthy actor, he was lacking in inspiration, homely, dry, and quaint in style. He was seen to most advantage in eccentric comedy. For thirty-four years he was secretary to the Covent Garden Theatrical Fund. He occasionally contributed some recollections and other articles to the press.<br>
