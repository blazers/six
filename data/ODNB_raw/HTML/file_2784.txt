<span class="headword">Boitard,  Louis-Philippe</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1733&#150;1767), <span class="occ">engraver and designer</span>, was the son of Fran&ccedil;ois Boitard (1667&#150;1719), designer. Louis-Philippe Boitard's place of birth is unknown although he was generally considered to be a Frenchman: his father, born in France, was based in London from at least 1709 to 1712 but probably died in Amsterdam. Fran&ccedil;ois Boitard was employed by Jacob Tonson to illustrate his editions of Shakespeare and the plays of Beaumont and Fletcher. He drew in the style of Raymond Lafage and, according to Horace Walpole, he made frequent trips to Holland to buy curiosities for the renowned collector Richard Mead. Louis-Philippe Boitard first attracted notice from George Vertue in 1742: &#145;Boitard engraver, lately come from Paris&#151;some merit&#151;good stock of assurance &amp;c&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>). In fact Louis Boitard's earliest known work, &#145;drawn from the Life at London April 1733&#146;, was a print of an 8-foot German, so it would appear that he had been working in London for some years before Vertue noticed his presence. Six plates that he had engraved after Canaletto for the fan painter Joseph Baudin were published in April 1736; he designed the frontispiece to George Lillo's <span class="italic">London Merchant</span> in 1737, and he engraved and published the <span class="italic">Inside of the Pantheon</span>, after a painting by Pannini in the collection of Lord James Cavendish, in 1738. Shortly after this Boitard visited France: in 1742 several sets of prints of birds, animals, hunting scenes, and Turkish ambassadors that he had engraved were published in Paris by the printseller Michel Odieuvre. It would seem that George Vertue first noticed him on his return. In 1744 Boitard advertised in the <span class="italic">Mercure de France</span> and it seems that he may have envisaged a cosmopolitan career like his father's. However, most of his work was done in London. During the 1740s he worked as a journeyman in the studio of the engraver William Henry Toms, where the hard-working John Boydell remarked disdainfully that &#145;Boitard had such a habit of <i>taking snuff</i> that He was perpetually having recourse to His Box and actually lost Hours every day from the indulgence of this practice&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 4.1415). In 1747, however, Boitard supplied forty-one large plates for Joseph Spence's <span class="italic">Polymetis</span>. He had also established himself by then as a designer (more rarely engraver) of satirical prints, illustrations to books, topical and theatrical portraits, watch-papers, and anatomical prints. A number of political satires, including several mocking the duke of Cumberland, have also been attributed to his hand. He worked on John and Paul Knapton's English edition of Albinus (1747&#150; ) and Walpole says that he was also employed by Dr Woodward and Dr Douglas on other anatomical figures. Walpole further reveals that he married an Englishwoman and that they had a son and a daughter. In 1753&#150;4 he supplied designs, which were engraved by Robert Hancock, to the Battersea enamel factory, and his designs were also transferred to Worcester porcelain. He engraved the illustrations to Paltock's <span class="italic">Peter Wilkins</span> (1750), the <span class="italic">Scribleriad</span> of Richard Owen Cambridge (1751), and Cambridge's <span class="italic">Description of Ranelagh Rotundo and Gardens</span> (1762). His social satires are lively and interesting, preoccupied with a critique of luxury, the consumption of French goods, and the riotous confrontation of poverty with affluence. A number of surviving sketches and drawings record his observant fascination with the street life of the metropolis. For Robert Sayer he produced <span class="italic">The cries of London, for the year 1766, being a collection of humorous characters in 86 prints, done under the direction of Mr. Boitard</span>. His last recorded work was for James Anderson's <span class="italic">The Constitutions of the Antient and Honourable Fraternity of Free and Accepted Masons</span> (1767). His illustrations to two earlier books on freemasonry suggest that he might possibly have been a mason himself. The date of Boitard's death is unknown.<br>
