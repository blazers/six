<span class="headword">Fenn,  Joseph Finch</span>  (1819&#150;1884), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 3 October 1819 at Travancore, India, son of the Revd Joseph Fenn, later minister of Blackheath Park Chapel, Kent. He was educated at Blackheath School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1838, where he graduated BA as eighteenth wrangler in 1842, MA in 1845, and BD in 1877. He was ordained a deacon in 1845, and priest in the following year. He held a fellowship of his college from 1844 until 1847, when he was presented to the college living of Stotfold, Bedfordshire. On 13 January 1848 he married Mary Jane (<i>d</i>. 1870), eldest surviving daughter of Samuel Bignold, mayor of Norwich and MP for the city (1854&#150;7). They had at least two sons.<br>
<br>In 1860 Fenn was appointed by the trustees to the perpetual curacy of Christ Church, Cheltenham, on the resignation of Archibald Boyd. In 1877 he became chaplain to C. J. Ellicott, bishop of Gloucester and Bristol, and in 1879 an honorary canon of Gloucester; in 1880 he was elected one of the two proctors in convocation for the united diocese.<br>
<br>Though a good scholar and of very extensive reading, Fenn published little, devoting himself to his parochial duties, including the careful preparation of his sermons. Some of these, forming a volume entitled <span class="italic">Lenten Teachings, 1877&#150;84</span>, were published after his death. He kept clear of the controversies dividing the Church of England, but was active in charitable work in Cheltenham, and was the eloquent promoter of the free library system in the town. Latterly he became a strong supporter of total abstinence from alcoholic liquor. He was generally regarded as an evangelical, but was not a party man. He supported both the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and the Church Missionary Society, and had a leaning to the old high-church section of the established church. His Cheltenham parishioners persuaded him to decline an offer of the benefice of St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, in 1877. The church of St Stephen, Tivoli, in the district of Christ Church, was built mainly by his exertions to provide for an increasing population, and he made substantial contributions towards the undertaking. After the death of his first wife he married Mina Frederica. Fenn died at his home, Christchurch Lodge, Cheltenham, on 22 July 1884, and was buried in his family vault in the churchyard of Leckhampton, near Cheltenham. A large memorial brass was erected in Christ Church.<br>
