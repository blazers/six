<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blind <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cohen]</span>,  Mathilde</span>  (1841&#150;1896), <span class="occ">poet and biographer</span>, was born at Mannheim, Germany, on 21 March 1841, the elder of two children of a Jewish banker named Cohen and his second wife, Friederike Ettlinger. Cohen died in Mathilde's infancy and she subsequently adopted the name of her mother's second husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31927/', "Karl Blind (1826&#150;1907)")</script>, a political writer who participated in the Baden insurrections of 1848&#150;9. After the suppression of the revolutionary movement the Blinds took refuge in London, where their home in Hampstead became a meeting-place for other refugees from abroad, including Garibaldi and Mazzini. Mathilde Blind was more inspired by their political conversation than by the haphazard education she received at a series of girls' schools. Her own thoughts on poetry and on the education of women were reinforced by her reading of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's <span class="italic">Aurora Leigh</span>. In 1859 she visited Switzerland, where she went on a solitary walking tour of the Alps, was denied access to the lectures at Z&uuml;rich University, studied philology, Latin, and other languages on her own, and passed much of her time with a group of dedicated revolutionaries. One acquaintance recalled Blind in her late teens as a dazzling beauty, full of the joy of life. She was profoundly affected, however, when in 1866 her younger brother, Ferdinand, failed in an attempt to assassinate Bismarck and then committed suicide in prison. In 1867 she published, under the pseudonym Claude Lake, a volume of <span class="italic">Poems</span> dedicated to Mazzini; her &#145;Recollections of Mazzini&#146; eventually appeared in 1891, in an issue of the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>. Shelley was another of her heroes: she gave public lectures on his poetry, wrote an essay about him for the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span> which appeared in 1870, and edited a selection of his poetry in 1872. She translated David Friedrich Strauss's <span class="italic">Der alte und der neue Glaube</span> (as <span class="italic">The Old Faith and the New</span>, 1873), and during the early 1870s she also contributed reviews of poetry to <span class="italic">The Examiner</span>.<br>
<br>At the age of thirty Blind, who never married, moved out of her parents' home to establish an independent life. She was one in a circle of women writers that included Mona Caird, Violet Paget (Vernon Lee), Amy Levy, Olive Schreiner, and Augusta Webster. She knew James Thomson (B.V.), William Sharp (Fiona Macleod), and Algernon Charles Swinburne, and she was particularly close to the William Michael Rossettis. In the early 1880s she lived in Manchester with the painter Ford Madox Brown and his wife, Emma; there were rumours, after Emma died, that Brown wished to marry her. Arthur Symons, who met Blind when she was in her forties, described her face as &#145;the most emotional, but the most worn and haggard and furrowed I have ever seen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Letters</span>, 42). Vernon Lee, who claimed to like Blind and admire her poetry, regarded her as &#145;amiable&#146; but ugly and &#145;coarse &hellip; extremely like Ouida&#146;  (<span class="italic">Vernon Lee's Letters</span>, 64, 80, 91). Others who knew her described her as handsome, despite a disagreeable and strongly accented speaking voice. Although she was known for her animated conversation, she had no discernible sense of humour.<br>
<br>Blind travelled extensively in an attempt to improve her health and alleviate her frequent depressions. Visits to Scotland inspired <span class="italic">The Prophecy of St Oran</span> (1881), which narrates the mission of St Columba to the Hebrides, and <span class="italic">The Heather on Fire</span> (1886), a passionate denunciation of the highland clearances. She continued, in the 1880s, to give public lectures on Shelley, and in 1886 she edited the poems, letters, and journals of Byron. Her essay on Mary Wollstonecraft's educational theories was published in 1878 in the <span class="italic">New Quarterly Magazine</span>. She also wrote the first full-length biography of George Eliot (1883) and a biography of Madame Roland (1889). In her only novel, <span class="italic">Tarantella: a Romance</span> (1885), she develops a highly imaginative plot set, somewhat incongruously, against scenes of provincial realism more typical of George Eliot's fiction. She translated from French the controversial <span class="italic">Journal de Marie Bashkirtseff</span>; in the introduction she assailed the &#145;cut-and-dried theories [of men] as to what women are or ought to be&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of Marie Bashkirtseff</span>, trans. M. Blind, 1890, new edn, 1985, 695). Blind's most ambitious work, however, was <span class="italic">The Ascent of Man</span> (1889), a poetic epic based on Darwinian theories of evolution. Arthur Symons described this volume as &#145;a hymn of religious ecstasy; for the scientific teaching of Darwin &hellip; inflamed her with the ardour of a worshipper&#146;  (Symons, &#145;Introduction&#146; to <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span>, v). Her next three volumes of poetry show the influence of her extensive travelling, which included a trip to Egypt in 1891. Ford Madox Brown contributed a frontispiece to <span class="italic">Dramas in Miniature</span>, which includes &#145;The Russian Student's Tale&#146; and other poems illustrating the inequity between the sexes. <span class="italic">Songs and Sonnets</span> appeared in 1893, followed in 1895 by <span class="italic">Birds of Passage: Songs of the Orient and Occident</span>. Late in life Blind inherited a sizeable legacy from her half-brother, Max Cohen. She was living in Stratford upon Avon when she wrote her last poems, a group of sonnets inspired by Shakespeare. She died at her home, 96 Belgrave Road, London, on 26 November 1896 and was cremated; the remains were interred at a memorial erected in St Pancras cemetery, East Finchley. The bulk of her estate was bequeathed to Newnham College, Cambridge. In the year after her death Symons edited a collection entitled <span class="italic">The Poetical Works of Mathilde Blind</span>; this volume also includes a memoir by Richard Garnett, who quoted from Blind's unfinished autobiography.<br>
<br>Blind was regarded in her own lifetime as an author of some repute. Twentieth-century scholars have praised her biography of George Eliot for the extent and accuracy of its research, for its incisive critical analyses, and for its emphasis on Eliot's feminism. As for Blind's poetry, her contemporary readers, as well as those in the twentieth century, have tended to prefer her shorter and more lyrical efforts such as &#145;The Sower&#146;, &#145;Reapers&#146;, &#145;Lassitude&#146;, &#145;Manchester by Night&#146;, and &#145;The Dead&#146;. Feminist critics have called attention also to the impressive sonnet &#145;Motherhood&#146;, which describes the pain of labour and childbirth. More recently, in <span class="italic">Victorian Poetry: Poetry, Poetics and Politics</span> (1993), Isobel Armstrong has re-evaluated the longer works, particularly <span class="italic">The Heather on Fire</span> and <span class="italic">The Ascent of Man</span>, in the context of &#145;a gendered tradition in women's poetry of the nineteenth century&#146;. According to Armstrong, Blind, by reconfiguring &#145;a new myth of creativity and gender&#146;, demonstrates the best that this tradition can achieve in terms of social and political analysis  (Armstrong, 374&#150;6).<br>
