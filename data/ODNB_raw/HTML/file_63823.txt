<span class="headword">Mander, Sir  Frederick</span>  (1883&#150;1964), <span class="occ">headmaster and trade unionist</span>, was born at 172 Wellington Street, Luton, Bedfordshire, on 12 July 1883, the son of Arthur Mander, an iron plate worker, and his wife, Carrie Ellingham. His name was registered at birth as Fred, which was also recorded on his marriage certificate, but in later life he was known as Frederick. He was educated at Luton higher grade school before training to become a teacher at Westminster Training College and obtaining a University of London external BSc degree. He was a schoolmaster when he married, on 2 September 1911, Hilda Irene Sargent (<i>b</i>. 1883/4), the daughter of Thomas William Sargent, gentleman; they had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>By 1915 Mander was headmaster of a Luton school, where he remained until 1931. Having become involved in the politics of the National Union of Teachers (NUT) at a local level, he was elected to the NUT executive in 1922. The following year he played a leading role in the well-known Lowestoft strike, when 163 teachers withdrew their labour for eleven months in protest against the local authority's decision to reduce salaries by 10 per cent. The actions of the local education authority (LEA) received widespread censure, especially when the NUT demonstrated that non-union &#145;blackleg&#146; teachers were sub-standard. The Lowestoft dispute proved to be a landmark case. In 1926 the Board of Education stipulated that LEAs should pay teachers salaries agreed at a national level by the Burnham committee. Mander, together with Michael Conway, W. G. Cove, and Leah Manning, was seen as a leader of the &#145;forward movement&#146; within the NUT. In reality, however, it was his conservatism which helped him to advance within the NUT executive. He became vice-president in 1926 and president the following year. In 1931 he resigned his post as a head teacher to become general secretary, a position which he held until his retirement in 1947. He was knighted in 1938.<br>
<br>In Mander's first year as general secretary of the NUT he was a vigorous opponent of demands for teachers' pay to be reduced by up to 30 per cent in response to the economic crisis. The National Government initially sought a reduction of 15 per cent but strong NUT resistance limited the cut to 10 per cent. Having emerged from this difficult period, the second half of the 1930s saw the union renew its campaign for educational expansion, including the raising of the school-leaving age to fifteen and the provision of free secondary education for all. During the Second World War these and other themes were central to government plans for educational reconstruction and Mander was regularly consulted by civil servants and by R. A. Butler, president of the Board of Education from 1941 to 1945. In 1942 Mander was appointed to the inquiry into the supply, recruitment, and training of teachers and youth leaders, chaired by Sir Arnold McNair, which reported in May 1944. He also worked constructively with civil servants and representatives of the LEAs to promote the 1943 white paper <span class="italic">Educational Reconstruction</span> and the 1944 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>.<br>
<br>Mander participated in some delicate negotiations concerning the future of church schools and, when it looked as if the legislation might be wrecked by calls for equal pay for women teachers, he instructed NUT members of parliament to save the bill rather than support an amendment which reflected union policy. When the Burnham committee was reconstituted in 1944 Mander, in his capacity as leader of the teachers' panel, was drawn into a dispute with the LEAs concerning the payment of allowances for additional qualifications and training. A compromise was reached, however, and it can be argued that Mander's good personal relationships with Butler, Sir Maurice Holmes, the board's permanent secretary, and Sir Percival Sharp, secretary of the Association of Education Committees, did much to cultivate the sense of &#145;partnership&#146; in education policy making which characterized the wartime and immediate post-war period.<br>
<br>Within his own union, however, Mander was never universally popular, particularly among communist members of the executive. Indeed, as the <span class="roman">Education Bill</span> progressed through parliament, he found himself having to work with his long-standing opponent G. C. T. Giles, the communist headmaster of Acton School, who was union president during 1944. He retired as NUT general secretary in 1947 but remained active in local politics, chairing Bedfordshire county council between 1952 and 1962, and was a member of the executive of the Association of Education Committees. He died at Luton and Dunstable Hospital, Luton, on 27 February 1964; he was survived by his wife.<br>
