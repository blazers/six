<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bacon,  Francis</span>, Viscount St Alban  (1561&#150;1626), <span class="occ">lord chancellor, politician, and philosopher</span>, was born on 22 January 1561 at York House in the Strand, London, the second of the two sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1002/', "Sir Nicholas Bacon (1510&#150;1579)")</script>, lord keeper, and his second wife, Anne (<i>c</i>.1528&#150;1610) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/987/', "Bacon, Anne")</script>], daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6155/', "Sir Anthony Cooke")</script>, tutor to Edward VI, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fitzwilliam. He was baptized in the local church of St Martin-in-the-Fields, but spent most of his childhood, together with his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/988/', "Anthony Bacon (1558&#150;1601)")</script>, at Gorhambury, near St Albans, Hertfordshire, which their father had purchased in 1557. In the 1560s Nicholas Bacon built a new house there, and this house (together with Verulam House, which Francis Bacon built nearby later in his life) became one of his three central emotional places (the other two being York House where he again lived, as lord keeper and lord chancellor later in his life, and Gray's Inn, where he lived for most of his life). The well-known story that Elizabeth I often referred to Francis as &#145;the young Lord-Keeper&#146; is presumably no more than a legend.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducation"></a>Early years and education</h2>Bacon received his early education at home. Judging by their own experiences his parents must have set great store by education. In Nicholas Bacon's career from a sheep-reeve's son to lord keeper schooling had been crucial. His second wife's learning matched his own: her father, Sir Anthony Cooke, had inculcated classical erudition and protestant piety in his five daughters, and Anne Bacon was fluent in Greek and Latin as well as in Italian and French. Her erudition and piety were put to good use when, during Francis's infancy, she translated John Jewel's <span class="italic">Apologia ecclesiae Anglicanae</span> into English.<br>
<br>The chaplains who served the Bacon household had strong leanings towards puritanism. One, John Walsall, a graduate of Christ Church, Oxford, acted as the sons' tutor from 1566 to at least 1569. By this time the Bacon brothers were joined in the schoolroom at Gorhambury by Sir Thomas Gresham's illegitimate daughter, who had just married their half-brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/998/', "Nathaniel Bacon")</script>. When she returned home she wrote a letter of thanks to Anne, Lady Bacon, including regards for &#145;my brother Anthony and my good brother Frank&#146;  (R. Tittler, <span class="italic">Nicholas Bacon</span>, 1976, 156). Although there is no direct evidence there is little doubt that Bacon went through the whole of the normal primary and grammar school curriculum at home. His schooling not only included Christian teaching but also thorough training in the classics.<br>
<br>Having provided seven or eight years' education for his youngest sons at home Sir Nicholas Bacon sent them to university. All his sons went to Trinity College, Cambridge. Anthony and Francis (who had just turned twelve) went up to Cambridge on 5 April 1573 and matriculated on 10 June. They stayed there until December 1575, although their period of residence was twice interrupted when plague broke out in the Cambridge area. At Trinity the brothers, with their companion Edward Tyrell, one of Sir Nicholas's wards, were put under the personal tutelage of the master, Dr John Whitgift, the future archbishop of Canterbury. From these years at Cambridge dates Bacon's earliest extant letter. It is a request addressed on 3 July 1574 to his half-brother Nicholas Bacon, who had promised to send a deer for the graduation of Nicholas Sharpe, a fellow Trinity member.<br>
<br>According to the accounts kept by Whitgift he bought for the Bacon brothers' use the major classical texts and commentaries. These included the <span class="italic">Iliad</span>, Plato and Aristotle, &#145;tullies workes&#146; (perhaps Cicero's philosophical works and letters), Cicero's rhetorical works, Demosthenes' <span class="italic">Orations</span>, Hermogenes' <span class="italic">Ars rhetorica</span> in a facing-page Greek and Latin edition, as well as the histories of Livy, Sallust, and Xenophon  (P. Gaskell, &#145;Books bought by Whitgift's pupils in the 1570s&#146;, <span class="italic">Transactions of the Cambridge Bibliographical Society</span>, 7, 1979, 284&#150;93).<br>
<br>Bacon's education was conducted largely in Latin and followed the medieval curriculum. But the impact of humanism had drastically changed the way in which this curriculum was taught. A particular emphasis was placed on practical problems at the expense of logical subtlety. As is evident from the books Bacon purchased in Cambridge there was a strong emphasis on philosophy, rhetoric, and history in his studies. This was a particularly typical feature of Renaissance humanism, whose main aim was to train youth for public life.<br>
<br>The next step for a gentleman intending a public career was entrance to the inns of court. Francis Bacon was entered at Gray's Inn on 27 June 1576 and was admitted in November. Meanwhile, however, he was sent to France to accompany Sir Amias Paulet, English ambassador to France. Originally both Francis and his half-brother Edward were to go, but in the end only Francis followed Paulet late in September 1576, whereas Edward travelled on his own, heading not only to protestant centres like Geneva and Strasbourg but also to Vienna, Venice, and Padua.<br>
<br>Travelling abroad was considered highly useful to a young gentleman's education&#151;an opportunity for learning foreign languages and finding out about customs, politics, and institutions. But Bacon's stay in France (mostly in Paris, Poitiers, and Blois), which lasted almost exactly two and a half years, was not so much an educative grand tour. While he studied language, statecraft, and the civil law most of his time was presumably spent in performing routine diplomatic tasks.<br>
<br>When Bacon went to France he was only fifteen, and shared with Paulet's sons a tutor named Mr Duncumbe. When Duncumbe returned to England in October 1577 he was replaced by Jean Hotman, the son of the well-known Huguenot Fran&ccedil;ois Hotman. In 1578 Bacon was placed in the household of a civil lawyer to acquire a deeper acquaintance with civil law, then very important in diplomacy. This early exposure to Roman law had presumably a profound influence on his legal thinking, and when later in life Bacon developed his ideas of legal reform the impact of the Roman civil law was especially marked.<br>
<br>During his stay in France, perhaps in autumn 1577, Bacon once visited England as the bearer of the diplomatic post, delivering letters to Walsingham, Burghley, and Leicester and to the queen herself. Fairly soon after his return to France he planned a trip to Italy but Paulet did not grant him permission, mainly on religious grounds  (Jardine and Stewart, 61&#150;3).<br>
<br>Bacon's stay in France came to an abrupt end a few months before it was scheduled when the news of his father's death in February 1579 reached him. The youngest son made haste and arrived in London within a month of this event. He also brought the diplomatic post from Paulet, which included a recommendation from Sir Amias to the queen: &#145;Mr. Francis Bacon, is of great hope, endowed with many good and singular parts; and if God give him life will prove a very able and sufficient subject to do your Highness good and acceptable service&#146;  (Jardine and Stewart, 66).<br>
<br>His father's sudden death was a serious setback for Francis Bacon. Sir Nicholas had settled estates for all of his other sons and was in the course of doing so for the youngest one when he died. Moreover, Sir Nicholas's two families contested his will, and although an agreement was eventually reached with the help of Lord Burghley the half-brothers were never again close. The situation was worst for the youngest son, who had neither land nor income nor even a position.<br>
<br>Aged eighteen Bacon resumed his studies in Gray's Inn. Sir Nicholas had been a central figure in Gray's Inn and all his sons had been admitted there, but Francis was the only one who took up law as a profession. As a law student he was expected to attend readings or series of formal lectures on a specific English statute, to participate in hypothetical legal situations and thereby to learn cases, and to argue in moot courts (to argue on both sides of a case). Whether it was due to his natural talents or the seriousness with which he pursued his studies Bacon made rapid progress. He was admitted to the bar as an utter barrister of Gray's Inn (the equivalent of graduation) in June 1582, became bencher in 1586 and in November 1587 was elected as a reader, delivering his first set of lectures on church advowsons in Lent 1588.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>While still pursuing his legal studies Bacon embarked on a public career. He sought the help of his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4983/', "William Cecil, Lord Burghley")</script>, and his aunt, Lady Burghley [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46675/', "Cecil, Mildred")</script>], in September 1580, commending his earlier suit, which Burghley had promised to forward to the queen, and calling Burghley &#145;my patron&#146;. By October Burghley informed him of &#145;her Majesty's gracious opinion and meaning towards&#146; him  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 8.13&#150;14). When the duke of Alen&ccedil;on visited England in December 1580 Bacon was employed as a translator.<br>
<br>By the time the third and last session of the parliament, originally elected in 1572, met in January 1581 many by-elections had taken place. Among the new members was Francis Bacon, who had his twentieth birthday during the session. He sat for Bossiney, Cornwall, which was controlled by his godfather, the earl of Bedford. There is no evidence of Bacon's activities in this session. In the parliament of 1584 Lord Burghley won him a seat (Gatton, Surrey), but Bacon preferred the earl of Bedford's patronage, sitting for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis, Dorset. He was named to one committee and made his maiden speech on a bill concerning wards.<br>
<br>Bacon showed signs of sympathy to puritanism, not only attending the sermons of the puritan chaplain of Gray's Inn, but also accompanying his mother to the Temple chapel to hear the even more staunchly puritan sermons of Walter Travers. By 1584 Bacon, together with many key figures in the political nation, had become alarmed by both the perceived growing Catholic threat and the English church's suppression of the puritan clergy. He joined many others in critically reviewing in a tract this anti-puritan campaign led by his former tutor, recently appointed archbishop of Canterbury, John Whitgift, who demanded absolute submission to the church's discipline from the entire clergy.<br>
<br>Bacon's tract is his earliest extant longer writing and was obviously widely circulated. He strongly criticized the Catholics both within and without England and gave support for the puritan cause. But his argument was couched in strongly political terms. He appealed to &#145;all reason of state&#146; and to the example &#145;of the most wise, most politic, and best governed estates&#146;. For the danger within the queen should do everything possible to strengthen protestantism, mainly through promoting preaching and schooling, because all her &#145;force and strength and power&#146; consisted in her protestant subjects. As for the problems without, the best remedy was a political alliance with the enemies of Spain, above all with Venice and the Netherlands  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 8.47&#150;56).<br>
<br>In 1585 Bacon felt that his age (twenty-four) blocked the advancement of his career. He requested Burghley's help with his career at Gray's Inn, and asked Sir Christopher Hatton and Sir Francis Walsingham to advance his suit for a political office. Although no office was forthcoming various other employments kept him busy. Through Walsingham's patronage Bacon was soon employed to investigate English Catholics. In the parliament which met in winter 1586&#150;7 Bacon (sitting for Taunton, Somerset) was more visible than before. He argued for the execution of Mary, queen of Scots, and was named to the committee appointed to draw up a petition for her execution. He also spoke in favour of the proposed subsidy and sat on three other committees. In September 1587 the privy council consulted the attorney-general, the solicitor-general, and Bacon on legal matters concerning examination reports of two Catholic prisoners. Bacon's first surviving legal works&#151;&#145;A brief discourse upon the commission of Bridewell&#146; and another discourse in law French on crown prerogatives and ownership&#151;were also written in this period. (There is however a near contemporary attribution of the former to William Fleetwood, recorder of London, GL, MS 9384.) In August 1588 Bacon was appointed to a government committee examining recusants in prison and a few months later, in December 1588, he was appointed to a committee of lawyers which was to review existing statutes. When a new parliament met in February 1589 he was busy throughout the session with committee work. In November 1589 he was granted a reversion of the clerkship of star chamber. Although he did not succeed to the post until 1608 the reversion demonstrated Bacon's growing importance and, since the post was worth &pound;1600 per annum, it gave him a promise of economic security.<br>
<br>This steady advancement of Bacon's political and legal career is aptly reflected by the importance attached to a position paper he wrote on ecclesiastical politics. &#145;An advertisement touching the controversies of the Church of England&#146; (written some time between 1589 and 1591) was Bacon's response to the conflict between the Church of England and the nonconformists, sparked off by the publication of the pamphlets said to be written by one Martin Marprelate. These tracts used scathing satire in heavily censuring the Church of England. Richard Bancroft, chaplain to Sir Christopher Hatton and a future bishop of London, hired such writers as John Lyly and Thomas Nashe to answer in a similar irreverent style.<br>
<br>Avoiding the mutual muckraking of both sides in the controversy Bacon emphasized his impartiality and called for a cessation to hostilities. According to him the puritans too easily imitated the government of foreign presbyterian churches. &#145;It may be&#146;, Bacon wrote in a remarkable passage, that &#145;in civil states, a republic is a better policy than a kingdom&#146;. Yet, in church government, hierarchy rather than &#145;the parity and equality of ministers&#146; was to be sought  (<span class="italic">Bacon</span>, ed. Vickers, 10). Nevertheless Bacon placed the main blame for the controversy at the bishops' door. &#145;The imperfections &hellip; of those which have chief place in the church have ever been principal causes and motives of schisms and divisions&#146;  (ibid., 6). Although his name was not mentioned in the tract Bancroft received Bacon's bitterest censure.<br>
<br>&#145;An advertisement&#146; was never printed in Bacon's lifetime, but several extant manuscript copies attest to its wide circulation. Both sides of the controversy&#151;a presbyterian tract in 1591 and a treatise by Bancroft in 1593&#151;invoked &#145;An advertisement&#146; in their own defence  (<span class="italic">Bacon</span>, ed. Vickers, 498). Bacon's famous comment on another occasion that &#145;her Majesty, not liking to make windows into men's hearts and secret thoughts&#146;, also indicates his middle path  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 8.98).<br>
<br>In 1592 Bacon was commissioned to write a response to the Jesuit Robert Persons's anti-government tract <span class="italic">Responsio ad edictum reginae Angliae</span>, entitled &#145;Certain observations made upon a libel&#146;. Just like Thomas Wilson and Thomas Norton in 1570, so Bacon in 1592 emphasized &#145;the resemblance between the two Philips, of Macedon and Spain&#146;, and thus identified England with republican Athens. English statesmen and counsellors were just like &#145;the Orators&#146; in Athens, being &#145;sharpest sighted&#146; and looking &#145;deepest into the projects and spreading&#146; of the two Philips  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 8.182&#150;3).<h2>
<a name="BaconandEssex"></a>Bacon and Essex</h2>Bacon's life and career during the 1590s was dominated by his close friendship with Robert Devereux, the second earl of Essex. It is not clear when this relationship began and when it developed into an intimate friendship, but as early as summer 1588 there was at least a patronage relationship. In June 1588 Bacon wrote to the earl of Leicester asking his support for a suit which Essex was advancing on Bacon's behalf.<br>
<br>Quite suddenly in the early 1590s Bacon broached the entirely novel theme of natural philosophy that occupied him for the rest of his life. Early in 1592 he wrote to Lord Burghley. In one of his most famous letters, assuring his &#145;devotion&#146; both as &#145;a good patriot&#146; and &#145;an unworthy kinsman&#146;, Bacon expressed anxiety about his age: &#145;I wax now somewhat ancient; one and thirty years is a great deal of sand in the hour-glass&#146;. But instead of merely putting forward a suit for office, he was, Bacon told his uncle, pursuing a place for a higher purpose. He wrote:<blockquote>I confess that I have as vast contemplative ends, as I have moderate civil ends; for I have taken all knowledge to be my province; and if I could purge it of two sorts of rovers, whereof the one with frivolous disputations, confutations, and verbosities, the other with blind experiments and auricular traditions and impostures, hath committed so many spoils, I hope I should bring in industrious observations, grounded conclusions, and profitable inventions and discoveries; the best state of that province. This, whether it be curiosity, or vain glory, or nature, or (if one take it favourably) <i>philanthropia</i>, is so fixed in my mind as it cannot be removed. And I do easily see, that place of any reasonable countenance doth bring commandment of more wits than of a man's own; which is the thing I greatly affect. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 8.109)</blockquote>In 1592 Bacon also produced a device entitled &#145;Of tribute, or, Giving that which is due&#146;. There is no evidence that it was ever performed. The device consists of four speeches&#151;the first arguing for &#145;the worthiest virtue&#146; (fortitude), the second for &#145;the worthiest affection&#146; (love), the third for &#145;the worthiest power&#146; (knowledge), and the fourth for &#145;the worthiest person&#146; (Queen Elizabeth). The one on knowledge enlarged on the plans and ambitions which Bacon outlined in his letter to Burghley. He excoriated extant natural philosophy for both its barren products and its futile methods, the main culprits being &#145;the Grecians&#146; (scholasticism) and &#145;the alchemists&#146; (Paracelsians). Bacon thus argued against the barrenness of scholastic natural philosophy and against the preposterous claims of alchemy. He hinted that he would form a new method which would replace both exploded schools, and produce not just words but works.<br>
<br>&#145;Is truth ever barren?&#146;, Bacon asked and immediately provided the answer in another rhetorical question: &#145;Shall he not be able thereby to produce worthy effects, and to endow the life of man with infinite new commodities?&#146; Moreover, he pointed to the mechanical artificers who had created printing, artillery, and the compass, as his forerunners. It is extremely significant that Bacon called knowledge &#145;the worthiest power&#146;, thus making as early as 1592 his novel link between natural philosophy and power  (<span class="italic">Bacon</span>, ed. Vickers, 34&#150;6).<br>
<br>When a new parliament met on 19 February 1593 Bacon sat as knight of the shire for Middlesex. This mirrored his enhanced importance. Nevertheless it was a catastrophic session for him. The queen had had two reasons to summon parliament: religious conformity and money. When the appeal for funds was made Bacon was among the first to speak, but curiously pleaded ignorance of war and did not speak about money but about the urgent need of a law reform. The appointed committee suggested the repetition of the exceptional grant of two subsidies made in the previous parliament. But in a conference of both houses Lord Burghley announced that the Lords would not assent to anything less than three subsidies, paid in three years (twice as quickly as usually), and that the assessments must be improved.<br>
<br>Burghley's son, Sir Robert Cecil, reported this message to the House of Commons. With Cecil seated Bacon, who had been a member of the committee of both houses, rose and, while assenting to three subsidies, opposed joining with the Lords in granting it. The Commons, Bacon insisted, should stand upon its privilege of first offering a subsidy. If his earlier speech had been rather irrelevant this one must have been a worse irritant for his uncle. But more was to come. After several days of work the Commons referred the matter to yet another committee. The councillors wanted three subsidies paid in three or four years. When the committee met again, on the morning of 8 March, Bacon rose and announced that he would assent to three subsidies &#145;but not to the payment under six years&#146;. &#145;The gentlemen&#146;, he said, &#145;must sell their plate and the farmers their brass pots ere this will be paid. And as for us, we are here to search the wounds of the realm and not to skin them over&#146;. He was convinced that a quick payment of three subsidies in three years would &#145;breed discontentment in the people&#146; and make &#145;an ill precedent&#146;. Moreover, history amply demonstrated that &#145;of all nations the English care not to be subject, base, taxable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 8.223). Bacon's heroic eloquence seems to have won no support. Walter Ralegh argued against him, as did Cecil, who refuted each of his cousin's arguments. The committee agreed to three subsidies payable in four years.<br>
<br>Many of those who had opposed the unprecedented demand for three subsidies in three years incurred the ire of the queen. Bacon's speeches, while ostensibly high principled, were scarcely prudent for a gentleman looking for a career in the service of the queen. He may have been reprimanded during the session, and certainly felt the queen's anger afterwards. The queen thought that Bacon was &#145;in more fault than any of the rest in Parliament&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 8.254). As soon as Burghley had informed him of the queen's anger Bacon tried to excuse his speech. &#145;The manner of my speech&#146;, he told his uncle, &#145;did most evidently show that I spake simply and only to satisfy my conscience, and not with any advantage or policy to sway the cause&#146;. In expressing his sincere opinions Bacon had simply endeavoured to signify his &#145;duty and zeal towards her Majesty and her service&#146;  (ibid., 8.234). &#145;There is&#146;, he later added, &#145;variety allowed in counsel, as a discord in music, to make it more perfect&#146;  (ibid., 8.362).<br>
<br>Such justifications failed to make amends. The disaster of Bacon's speeches was made much worse by the fact that immediately afterwards Essex launched a campaign on Bacon's behalf for the office of attorney-general. During the campaign Bacon gained some legal experience. In January and February 1594 he argued his first two cases in king's bench and one in the court of exchequer, which won him general applause. He was also involved in the treason trial of Roderigo Lopez, and prepared its official account. Yet by spring 1594 it was clear that Edward Coke was to become the next attorney-general. Bacon told Essex that he would &#145;retire myself with a couple of men to Cambridge, and there spend my life in my studies and contemplations, without looking back&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 8.291).<br>
<br>No such retirement took place. In July 1594 the queen made Bacon one of her learned counsel and he was employed in several legal cases. One of them&#151;obviously an investigation of the aftermath of Dr Lopez's conspiracy&#151;required him to travel north. Due to an illness Bacon got no further than Huntingdon. He took this opportunity to visit Cambridge and take his MA degree.<br>
<br>Bacon wrote parts of the <span class="italic">Gesta Grayorum</span>, the Christmas festivities of 1594&#150;5 at Gray's Inn. It was presented on 3 January 1595 in front of a formidable audience. Similar to the earlier device (&#145;Of tribute&#146;), it had six speakers arguing their choice of life. The first defended &#145;the Exercise of war&#146;, the second advised &#145;the Study of Philosophy&#146;, the third &#145;Eternizement and Fame by Buildings and Foundations&#146;, the fourth defended &#145;Absoluteness of State and Treasure&#146;, the fifth &#145;Virtue and a gracious Government&#146;, and the sixth &#145;Pastimes and Sports&#146;. The second speech, pleading the cause of philosophy, urged &#145;the conquest of the works of nature&#146;, commending the erection of &#145;a most perfect and general library&#146;, &#145;a spacious, wonderful garden&#146;, &#145;a goodly huge cabinet&#146;, as well as &#145;a still-house [laboratory], so furnished with mills, instruments, furnaces, and vessels, as may be a palace fit for a philosopher's stone&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bacon</span>, ed. Vickers, 54&#150;5). But the device was part of Christmas festivities, and the day was carried by the last counsellor who declared &#145;let other men's lives be as pilgrimages &hellip; but princes' lives are as progresses, dedicated only to variety and solace&#146;  (ibid., 60).<br>
<br>When Edward Coke was appointed attorney-general the solicitor-generalship became vacant. Essex pressed hard to secure it for Bacon, and if anything the suit became even more prolonged and exhaustive than the earlier one. Bacon even asked for a licence to travel abroad but the queen refused him. Venting his frustration to his brother Anthony, Bacon said that the queen had sworn that &#145;she will seek all England for a Solicitor rather than take me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 8.348). By July 1595 he could no longer contain himself but wrote to Lord Keeper Puckering: &#145;There hath nothing happened to me in the course of my business more contrary to my expectation, than your Lordship's failing me and crossing me now in the conclusion, when friends are best tried&#146;  (ibid., 8.364&#150;5). Trying to atone Essex referred to Bacon's burst of anger as &#145;a natural freedom and plainness&#146;, which Bacon had also used with Essex as well as with other friends  (ibid., 8.366).<br>
<br>Whatever Bacon's hopes, they were dashed early in November 1595 when the queen appointed Sir Thomas Fleming as solicitor-general. Most scholars agree that Bacon's opposition to the subsidy bill in 1593, which had offended the queen, and Essex's perseverance in pursuing the suit, which had annoyed her, account for Bacon's failure to obtain the post. Essex consoled Bacon by offering him a gift of land. Bacon responded that while he was &#145;more beholding to you than to any man&#146;, yet Essex could not purchase his loyalty, and that his first obligation was always to the queen and the public service  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 8.373). Afterwards, Bacon sold the land for &pound;1800.<br>
<br>The painful experience of these suits led Bacon temporarily to entertain the idea of a purely scholarly career and &#145;not to follow the practice of the law &hellip; because it drinketh too much time, which I have dedicated to better purposes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 8.372). But when, in spring 1596, the office of master of the rolls fell vacant it gave him new hope that a place would also be vacated to which he could succeed, receiving strong support from Essex.<br>
<br>Intellectual and literary pursuits, most of them closely related to Essex and his circle, took up much of Bacon's time in the late 1590s. Essex had commissioned him to write a device for the Accession day celebration, presented at Essex House on 17 November 1595. Again Bacon's contribution consisted of three men defending their respective forms of life: a hermit defending contemplation, a soldier defending fame, and a statesman arguing for experience. These arguments were refuted by a squire who concluded by confirming his master's (representing Essex) dedication to the queen. In this, as in the earlier dramatic entertainments, Bacon could be seen as dramatizing his own choices between the active and contemplative modes of life.<br>
<br>In addition to literary devices Bacon used letters of advice to display his learning and intellectual abilities, and to put his ideas across. The first of these was a series of three letters addressed to the earl of Rutland (who travelled in Europe during 1595&#150;7) perhaps late in 1595 or early in 1596, which Bacon wrote on Essex's behalf. Bacon strongly argued for the <i>vita activa</i>, which needed above all &#145;liberality or magnificence, and fortitude or magnanimity&#146;. Underlying these virtues, however, was &#145;knowledge, which is not only the excellentest thing in man, but the very excellency of man&#146;. Restricting his account to &#145;civil knowledge&#146;, Bacon emphasized that such a knowledge consisted of doing &#145;good unto others&#146; and it therefore contrasted sharply with &#145;the study of <i>artes luxuriae</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 8.9&#150;12).<br>
<br>Bacon wrote a somewhat different letter of advice to Essex himself in October 1596, after the latter's Cadiz expedition had weakened his position at court. Calling Essex &#145;a nature not to be ruled&#146;, Bacon advised him studiously to avoid giving such an impression. But he also counselled him to shun the impressions of &#145;a military dependence&#146; and &#145;a popular reputation&#146;. In both these, however, the earl should avoid the appearance but not the characteristic itself. He must abolish a military dependence &#145;in shows to the Queen&#146; but retain it in practice. Similarly, in the queen's presence he must &#145;speak against popularity and popular courses vehemently; and tax it in all others: but nevertheless to go on in your honourable commonwealth courses as you do&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 9.41&#150;4).<br>
<br>Yet another intellectual pursuit to which Bacon devoted time in the 1590s was his idea of reforming the English law. In 1593 he had mentioned in parliament how in ancient Rome &#145;ten men&#146; had been appointed &#145;to correct and recall all former laws&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 8.214). In the Christmas festivities at Gray's Inn in 1594&#150;5 he had the counsellor advising the prince in &#145;Virtue and a gracious Government&#146; to advocate a similar project  (<span class="italic">Bacon</span>, ed. Vickers, 59). In new year 1597 Bacon presented the queen with a work, &#145;Maxims of the law&#146;, which was meant as an example of how the English law should be restructured. It consists of twenty-five maxims in Latin each of which is followed by a fuller treatment.<br>
<br>Early in 1597 Bacon appeared in print for the first time. Some of his essays had already been circulated in manuscript (in 1597 he noted that &#145;they passed long agoe from my pen&#146;; <span class="italic">Works</span>, 6.523), and in 1596 one of them was plagiarized in Edward Monings's <span class="italic">The Langrave of Hessen his Princelie Receiving of her Majesties Embassador</span>, which borrowed a few passages from Bacon's essay &#145;Of studies&#146;. On 24 January 1597 one Richard Serger entered in the Stationers' register &#145;a book entitled ESSAYES of M.F.B. <i>with prayers of his Sovereigne</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bacon</span>, ed. Vickers, 546). In order to forestall this publication Bacon immediately assigned the rights to Humfrey Hooper. On 7 February 1597 the first edition of Bacon's <span class="italic">Essayes</span>, together with <span class="italic">Religious Meditations</span> and <span class="italic">Places of Perswasion and Disswasion</span>, was published. The ten essays treated personal and courtly issues and belong, too, to the literature of advice. They were written in a terse, aphoristic style (individual sentences were marked with a paragraph sign), which Bacon conceived as a genre setting down discrete observations on life, and aspiring to some kind of objective validity. The slim volume had considerable success and was reprinted in 1597, 1598, 1606, and 1612.<br>
<br>In 1597 Bacon tried his fortune with Lady Hatton, a young, rich widow (and the daughter of Burghley's eldest son)&#151;but without success. To make matters worse she married Bacon's old rival Edward Coke in November 1598. One of the chief reasons for Bacon's suit was economic. His estate was &#145;weak and indebted&#146;, both because of the lack of inheritance and because he in his &#145;own industry&#146; had &#145;rather referred and aspired to virtue than to gain&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 9.61). When the marriage suit failed Bacon endeavoured to use his reversion of the star chamber clerkship to relieve his necessities. He would give it to the lord keeper Thomas Egerton's son if Egerton would give him the mastership of the rolls. Again the plan fell through, and in September 1598 Bacon was arrested for debt. Although his income increased considerably over time his economic situation was never secure, and he often had difficulties in settling his debts.<br>
<br>In the parliament which sat from October 1597 to February 1598 Bacon was an active member for Ipswich, serving in numerous committees. He delivered his speech in favour of three subsidies, payable in three years. He initiated the important social and economic legislative work of the session with a motion against enclosures and the depopulation of towns and houses of husbandry, and for the maintenance of tillage, which he had not written, he said, &#145;with polished pen but with a polished heart, free from affection and affectation&#146;. He defended his initiative with a Machiavellian argument: &#145;in matters of policy ill is not to be thought ill which bringeth forth good&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 9.82).<br>
<br>In September 1598 Bacon examined one John Stanley for being involved in Edward Squire's conspiracy to assassinate the queen. In 1599 he published a quasi-official account of the conspiracy entitled <span class="italic">Letter Written out of England to an English Gentleman in Padua</span>. From 1599 also comes a letter of advice to Fulke Greville on his studies ascribed to Bacon. The letter addressed the topic of employing research assistants, but it also criticized university learning and attacked the use of epitomes. Again, Bacon singled out Demosthenes and found &#145;his eloquence &hellip; more proper to a statesman than Cicero's&#146;. While Livy and Thucydides were good historians Tacitus was &#145;simply the best&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bacon</span>, ed. Vickers, 105).<br>
<br>The situation in Ireland had been growing from bad to worse during the latter part of the 1590s. In 1598 Bacon had seen this as an exceptionally apposite opportunity for Essex &#145;to purchase honour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 9.95&#150;6). After some deliberation Essex was appointed in March 1599 to suppress the Irish uprising. What did Bacon think about Essex continuing his military career? In 1604 Bacon wrote that he had been firmly against Essex &#145;going into Ireland&#146;. &#145;I did not only dissuade&#146;, he wrote in 1604, &#145;but protest against his going&#146;, omitting &#145;no argument&#146;. In particular, he said, he had cited the example of the ancient Romans, who, despite their overwhelming military strength, had had extreme difficulties against &#145;the ancient Gauls, or Britons, or Germans&#146;. These people had &#145;placed their felicity only in liberty and the sharpness of their sword&#146; and in &#145;the natural and elemental advantages of woods, and bogs, and hardness of bodies&#146;. From such examples, Bacon claimed in 1604, he had &#145;concluded, that going over with such expectations as he did, and through the churlishness of the enterprise not like to answer it, would mightily diminish his reputation&#146;  (ibid., 10.146).<br>
<br>There is no contemporary evidence indicating that Bacon actually gave such advice. In a letter that appears to have been written by the time the earl had already decided to embark on this project, Bacon on the one hand pointed out the great merit and great peril of the enterprise which Essex was poised to undertake, and on the other found hopeful portents of its success. Moreover he cited exactly the same example of the ancient Romans as in 1604, but stressed the fact that triumphs against a &#145;barbarous&#146; enemy did not &#145;extenuate the honour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 8.131), rather than the difficulty of the enterprise, as in 1604. It is impossible to say whether Bacon remembered in 1604 what he wanted, or whether he had first advised Essex against going to Ireland but, when the earl decided against such advice, warned him about the great peril while trying to reassure him.<br>
<br>When Essex unexpectedly returned from Ireland in September 1599 Bacon worked hard to reconcile the earl to the queen, despite rumours to the contrary. When she came &#145;to dine at my lodge&#146; he even presented her with &#145;a sonnet directly tending and alluding to draw on her Majesty's reconcilement to my Lord&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 10.149). Although Bacon advised the queen to deal with Essex in private the case was heard in star chamber, where neither the earl nor Bacon was present. Finally, in June 1600 Essex was subjected to an informal trial at York House, where Bacon was involved as one of the queen's learned counsel. Essex was dismissed from all his offices of state and was to remain at Essex House.<br>
<br>In spring 1600 Bacon had been chosen double reader at Gray's Inn and gave his six-day series of lectures on the <span class="roman">Statute of Uses</span>. Double readers were senior barristers who had already given one reading. This statute was a common topic for readings and Bacon had appeared in an important case (<i>Dillon v. Freine</i> or <i>Chudleigh's case</i>) involving the statute in 1595. The <span class="roman">Statute of Uses</span> also offered means for discussing law reform.<br>
<br>As soon as Essex was fully freed in July 1600 Bacon wrote him a letter assuring him that he loved the earl more than anyone else. Yet he insisted even more strongly, just as in 1595, that he put &#145;the Queen's service&#146; and &#145;the good of my country&#146; before private friendship  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 9.191). Bacon still endeavoured to restore Essex to the queen's favour, composing letters on the earl's behalf. These did not have the desired effect, and in February 1601 Essex made his forlorn attempt at a rebellion.<br>
<br>At the trial that followed the queen made use of Bacon for the prosecution. When Essex accused Bacon of being an accomplice because he had written letters for Essex Bacon retorted: &#145;I have spent more time in vain in studying how to make the earl a good servant to the Queen, than I have done in anything else&#146;  (Jardine and Stewart, 244). Bacon was also commissioned to prosecute some of Essex's followers, and the queen called upon him to write the official account of the trial. Many of the accomplices paid large fines, most of which were given away as rewards. Bacon received &pound;1200, although he had expected more.<br>
<br>The spring of 1601 was not a particularly happy period in Bacon's life. In addition to the Essex trial the antagonism between him and Edward Coke exploded in the exchequer in April. According to Bacon, Coke had told him: &#145;Mr. Bacon, if you have any tooth against me, pluck it out; for it will do you more hurt than all the teeth in your head will do you good&#146;. To this Bacon had riposted: &#145;Mr. Attorney, I respect you: I fear you not: and the less you speak of your own greatness, the more I will think of it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 10.3). On top of all this his brother Anthony died in May.<br>
<br>In the last Elizabethan parliament, which met in October 1601, Bacon again sat for Ipswich. He was a particularly active member, speaking to most of the matters and sitting in most of the committees. He supported the subsidy bill of four subsidies and emphasized that the poor as well as the rich should contribute, a view which evoked a scathing comment from Walter Ralegh  (Neale, 2.415). Bacon also insisted that parliament, as well as raising money, must enact laws. He brought in a bill &#145;against abuses in weights and measures&#146; and spoke &#145;for repealing superfluous laws&#146;. But he also noted that it was not enough to introduce bills; they should also be properly debated. It was &#145;unfitting&#146;, he said, &#145;to bandy bills like balls and to be silent, as if nobody were of counsel with the Commonwealth&#146;  (ibid., 2.417).<br>
<br>Bacon and Ralegh also argued against each other in a debate about the renewal of the <span class="roman">Statute of Tillage</span>. Bacon defended the bill, which enacted that land converted to pasture should be restored to tillage, noting that &#145;the husbandman&#146;, being &#145;a strong and hardy man&#146;, made the best soldier. Raleigh riposted that since &#145;all Nations abound with Corn&#146; it was best &#145;to set it at Liberty, and leave every man Free, which is the Desire of a true Englishman&#146;. Bacon's view, receiving support, for instance, from his cousin Robert Cecil, carried the day  (H. Townshend, <span class="italic">Historical Collections</span>, 1680, 299&#150;300). The most controversial issue of the session was the abuse of monopolies. Bacon's opinion was clear: &#145;For the prerogative royal of the Prince, for my own part I ever allowed of it: and it is such as I hope I shall never see discussed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 10.26).<br>
<br>In 1602 Bacon argued in <i>Slade's case</i>, although in the report of the case Coke completely ignored Bacon's argument. When the Irish problem became pressing in 1602 Bacon volunteered and offered his advice to Cecil. He strongly argued for a non-violent solution, emphasizing &#145;the recovery of the hearts of the people&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 10.46). A letter of advice to Sir Henry Savile on the intellectual powers, which anticipated themes expounded in <span class="italic">The Advancement of Learning</span> and later editions of the <span class="italic">Essayes</span>, has also been dated to 1602.<h2>
<a name="Unionofthekingdoms"></a>Union of the kingdoms</h2>When James VI of Scotland succeeded Elizabeth I to the English throne Bacon, like so many others, made a serious effort to secure the new king's attention. Just before the death of Elizabeth I on 24 March 1603 Bacon began to recommend his services to those who were close to the new king. He also prepared a proclamation &#145;for cherising, entertaining, and preparing of men's affections&#146; to the new king, but it was not used  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 10.67). Bacon's first impression of the new king was that he acted &#145;excellently well&#146;; he was &#145;a prince the farthest from the appearance of vain-glory&#146;  (ibid., 10.73, 77). On 23 July 1603 James's bounty also reached Bacon. On that day he was knighted, though to his great disappointment so were 300 others, to mark the king's coronation. On 18 August 1604 Bacon was granted the office of learned counsel.<br>
<br>In 1603 Bacon also published a short treatise on the proposed union between England and Scotland entitled <span class="italic">A Brief Discourse Touching the Happy Union of the Kingdoms of England and Scotland</span>. It was clear to everybody that James was eagerly promoting a union between his two kingdoms. Bacon had his doubts, thinking that the king &#145;hastened to a mixture of both kingdoms and nations, faster perhaps than policy will conveniently bear&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 10.77). But on the whole he fully supported the union. In his proclamation proposal in spring 1603 he had already spoken about uniting &#145;these two mighty and warlike nations of England and Scotland into one kingdom&#146;  (ibid., 10.68). In <span class="italic">Brief Discourse</span> he drew on an analogy between the principles of nature and policy. At the same time he revealed that he had been an attentive reader of Machiavelli, noting that:<blockquote>so likewise the authority of Nicholas Machiavelli seemeth not to be contemned; who enquiring the causes of the growth of the Roman empire, doth give judgment, there was not one greater than this, that the state did so easily compound and incorporate with strangers. (ibid., 10.96)</blockquote>Bacon also tried to capture James's attention with a treatise on ecclesiastical policy, written perhaps in August or September 1603. In <span class="italic">Certain Considerations Touching the Better Pacification and Edification of the Church of England</span> (1604) Bacon, again following Machiavelli, pointed out that, just like &#145;the civil state&#146; &#145;the ecclesiastical state&#146; requires to be constantly &#145;purged and restored&#146;. The brunt of Bacon's critique was again directed against the hierarchy of the church and its government. Although &#145;the substance of doctrine is immutable&#146; the &#145;policies and forms&#146; of church government (just like those of civil government) &#145;are left free&#146;. While he acknowledged that the government of bishops suited kingdoms better than &#145;parity of ministers and government by synods&#146;, he harshly criticized the bishops. Above all he censured their absolute power: &#145;the Bishop giveth orders alone; excommunicateth alone; judgeth alone&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 10.107&#150;9). Little wonder that the tract incurred the bishops' displeasure: it was suppressed by Richard Bancroft, bishop of London, and surviving copies of the printed version are incomplete.<br>
<br>Another tract which Bacon composed during the first months of the new reign was his <span class="italic">Apology in Certain Imputations Concerning the Late Earl of Essex</span> (May 1604); it enjoyed some success and was twice reprinted. In the tract Bacon defended his own conduct in the Essex affair by exactly the same line of argument which he had presented to Essex as early as in 1595. Bacon repeated that the queen and the public service had always had his first priority: &#145;whatsoever I did &hellip; was done in my duty and service to the Queen and the State&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 10.141).<br>
<br>James's first parliament met in March 1604, and Bacon again sat for Ipswich. The parliament had five sessions between 1604 and 1610 and was finally dissolved in February 1611. Bacon was one of the most active members of the house, speaking in almost every debate and sitting in almost every important committee and often reporting from committees or conferences to the house. In the first session of 1604 he assumed a conciliatory role in the dispute over who was the member for the county of Buckingham and in debates on wardship, monopolies, and purveyance.<br>
<br>The union question dominated the first and third sessions, and Bacon was heavily involved in it. To avoid opposition James's plans for the union and its accomplishment were vague. Despite intensive committee work all that had been achieved by July when the parliament was prorogued was a joint Anglo-Scottish commission to prepare proposals for union. In autumn 1604 Bacon was busy with the work of the commission and wrote &#145;Certain articles or considerations touching the union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland&#146;, which argued that political and legal changes and innovations, while possible, were always difficult. Bacon also wrote a suggestion for a proclamation &#145;touching his Majesty's style&#146;, but it was not adopted when the proclamation was published in October 1604. In spring 1605 Bacon promoted the union by a new &#145;History of Britain&#146; project, which would carry the union backwards in time. He did not proceed with this project but returned to it in 1610 when he wrote the beginning of &#145;The history of Great Britain&#146; and sent it for comments to the king.<br>
<br>The second session of James's first parliament, between November 1605 and May 1606, concentrated on purveyance and matters of finance as well as the Gunpowder Plot, and Bacon kept a fairly low profile. As early as 1603 Bacon had mentioned that he had &#145;found out an alderman's daughter, an handsome maiden, to my liking&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 10.80). Almost three years later, on 10 May 1606, he married her at Marylebone chapel. She was Alice (1592&#150;1650), a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1488/', "Benedict Barnham")</script>, a wealthy London alderman. Bacon was forty-five, she was barely fourteen.<br>
<br>The third session of James's first parliament, from November 1606 to July 1607, focused its attention on the Anglo-Scottish union. The commission had made three proposals: equal trading rights, repeal of expressedly hostile laws, and bestowal of a common nationality (naturalization). The first and third proposals aroused fierce opposition in the parliament, opposition which Bacon did his best to overcome. When, on 17 February 1607, Nicholas Fuller argued against the union by claiming that England would become overpopulated, Bacon arose to deliver a long speech, mustering all his eloquence in defence of the union in general and naturalization in particular. Just as fifteen years earlier in writing the official response to Robert Persons's anti-government tract, now Bacon appealed to the examples of Demosthenes and the republican Athens. If an MP merely looked at the union from &#145;his particular vocation&#146; he would perhaps oppose it, but putting his own private good before the common good would hardly enable him &#145;to give counsel or take counsel&#146;. He told them that instead the MPs should &#145;raise their thoughts, and lay aside those considerations which their private vocations and degrees mought minister and present unto them, and would take upon them cogitations and minds agreeable to the dignity and honour of the estate&#146;. Seeing beyond their own private good would prompt the MPs to lend their support to the union  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 10.307&#150;8). Bacon's eloquence failed to pay off: a few days later the Commons decided against the naturalization of the <i>post nati</i>.<br>
<br>In so far as his particular vocation was concerned Bacon's efforts to promote the union brought him the long hoped for advancement to solicitor-general on 25 June 1607. In the same year Bacon wrote his most concrete work on the Anglo-Scottish union, &#145;Preparation for the union of laws&#146;. He suggested that the English and Scottish laws should be organized in &#145;a book of two columns&#146; which would make the comparison easy.<br>
<br>Although the House of Commons had decided in February 1607 against the naturalization of the <i>post nati</i>, their decision was reversed in 1608 by exchequer chamber, which ruled that the <i>post nati</i>, but not the <i>ante nati</i>, were naturalized. Bacon appeared as solicitor-general on behalf of the king's interest and argued for the winning side, and like the lord chancellor, Ellesmere, based his argument on the nature of kingship. But he did not, as Ellesmere did, draw an absolutist conclusion, arguing instead that the law limited the king's power.<br>
<br>Perhaps the most lasting effect of Bacon's close involvement in the Anglo-Scottish union project was his theory of civic greatness. From the very beginning of his public utterances concerning the union he linked it with the attainment of civic greatness. His strongest arguments to this effect were presented in his long speech in the House of Commons on 17 February 1607 and the closely related tract: &#145;Of the true greatness of the kingdom of Britain&#146;, which remained unfinished. He also treated it in an essay, &#145;Of the greatness of kingdoms&#146;, published in the second edition of the <span class="italic">Essayes</span> (1612). &#145;For greatness&#146;, he told his colleagues in the House of Commons:<blockquote>I think a man may speak it soberly and without bravery, that this kingdom of England, having Scotland united, Ireland reduced, the sea provinces of the Low Countries contracted, and shipping maintained, is one of the greatest monarchies, in forces truly esteemed, that hath been in the world. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 10.323)</blockquote>In his theory of civic greatness Bacon carefully followed Machiavelli's account and argued against more recent theories of civic greatness expounded by such theorists as Justus Lipsius and Giovanni Botero. While emphasizing the centrality of the army and military disposition Bacon concentrated on the morality underlying the army and questioned the importance of opulence, commerce, and victuals. He declared in the House of Commons:<blockquote>Neither is the authority of Machivel to be despised, who scorneth the proverb of estate taken first from a speech of Mucianus, that Moneys are the sinews of wars; and saith there are no sinews of wars but the very sinews of the arms of valiant men. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 10.323&#150;4)</blockquote>Just as his notion of the politically active citizen was based on classical precedents, so it was the classical idea of the armed citizen which underlay Bacon's conception of civic greatness. The only way to pursue civic greatness successfully, much less to survive in the predatory world, was to attain a large population and to arm it. Walter Ralegh aptly summarized Bacon's argument:<blockquote>Certaine it is (as Sir Francis Bacon hath judiciously observed) That a State whose dimension or stemme is small, may aptly serve to be foundation of a great Monarchie: which chiefly comes to passe, where all regard of domesticall prosperitie is laid aside; and every mans care addressed to the benefit of his countrie. (W. Ralegh, <span class="italic">The Historie of the World</span>, 1614, 496)</blockquote>In 1607&#150;8 Bacon's career was at an important turning point. In June 1607 he had finally gained a crown office. On 16 July 1608 he became the clerk of star chamber, the reversion of which he had held since November 1589. Surviving notes of a review of his life that he made between 25 and 31 July 1608 offer an unusually personal insight into Bacon's life. He began with a detailed review of his economic situation. Although his marriage and the clerkship of star chamber had given him some financial security he still had a long list of possible lenders. He detailed his debts but also his property and income as well as the possible ways to increase them. Bacon then discussed how he could maintain access to the king. In particular he wanted to be &#145;affectionate and assured to the Scots&#146; at the court. He considered the kind of advice he should offer, what legal cases he should prepare for, how to run his office better than his predecessor, and how to take advantage of the weakness of the attorney-general, Sir Henry Hobart. He also reminded himself of his political projects&#151;&#145;greatness of Britain&#146;, &#145;union in Parliament&#146;&#151;as well as of circulating his political and legal works&#151;&#145;my Argument of the postnati&#146; and the speeches on naturalization and on union of laws  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 11.41&#150;3).<br>
<br>Moreover Bacon listed his diet and medication. He also made extensive plans for improving his gardens at Gorhambury House and building a new house &#145;with an upper galery open upon the water, a tarace above that, and a supping roome open under that; a dynyng roome, a bedd chamber, a Cabanett, and a Roome for Musike&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 11.765&#150;7). These plans eventually became Verulam House, which was to cost him &pound;9000 or &pound;10,000 and which, forty years after Bacon's death, in a state of dereliction, was sold to two carpenters for &pound;400.<h2>
<a name="Writingsonnaturalphilosophy16031613"></a>Writings on natural philosophy, 1603&#150;1613</h2>As well as pondering his private life and political as well as legal projects in July 1608 Bacon reviewed his plans in natural philosophy, listing all those who he thought could help him with his project in general and with experiments in particular. Although political and legal work had started to pile up during the first decade of the new century Bacon had also devoted a considerable amount of time to natural philosophy. In October 1605 he published <span class="italic">The Twoo Bookes of Francis Bacon: of the Proficience and Advancement of Learning, Divine and Humane</span>. It was the product of his two enforced periods of leisure, first from March 1603 to March 1604 and then from December 1604 to October 1605. <span class="italic">The Advancement of Learning</span>, as it is commonly called, was Bacon's first published philosophical work and the only one which he published in English. All the other published philosophical works (and most of those which remained unpublished) were written in Latin&#151;an indication of the international (rather than purely national) scope of his project. Initially Bacon planned to print <span class="italic">The Advancement of Learning</span> simultaneously in English and Latin, but haste prevented this and caused the first book of the volume to be printed before the second was finished. Bacon did not abandon the idea of a Latin edition, and in summer 1606 contacted Thomas Playfere, Lady Margaret professor of divinity at Cambridge, requesting him to translate <span class="italic">The Advancement of Learning</span> into Latin. Nothing came of this, but still in 1608 Bacon reminded himself of &#145;proceeding with the translation of my book of Advancment of learnyng&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 11.64).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Advancement of Learning</span> was divided into two books. The first was an eloquent and powerful defence of the importance of learning to every field of life. It was therefore constructed according to the principles of epideictic oratory. The much longer and more important second book was a general survey of the contemporary state of human knowledge, identifying its deficiencies and supplying Bacon's broad suggestions for improvement. The book's real importance was not so much its encyclopaedic character but rather its professed aim of propagating the Baconian ideas of the advancement of learning and knowledge, and of the practical means of accomplishing it.<br>
<br>Bacon often referred to himself with studied moderation as a mere &#145;bell-ringer&#146;, whose only task was &#145;to ring a bell to call other wits together&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 10.254, 300). Yet, by the first decade of the seventeenth century his calls for a new, productive natural philosophy began to emerge as a definite programme. The unpublished philosophical writings from this period are no less important than <span class="italic">The Advancement of Learning</span> for understanding how Bacon's great philosophical programme&#151;ultimately entitled &#145;Instauratio magna&#146; (&#145;The great instauration&#146;)&#151;was taking shape.<br>
<br>The earliest of these treatises, written in 1602&#150;3 and called the &#145;Temporis partus masculus&#146;, continued Bacon's criticism of earlier philosophy, summoning all the schools of ancient and modern philosophy to the bar and heaping scorn on them. Its subtitle&#151;&#145;Instauratio magna imperii humani in universum&#146;&#151;contains the earliest mention of the great instauration. A similar criticism was repeated in the &#145;Cogitata et visa&#146;, written in 1607, and in &#145;Redargutio philosophiarum&#146;, written in 1608, where Aristotle and Plato were roundly criticized, and a more favourable account was given of Empedocles, Heraclitus, and Democritus.<br>
<br>&#145;De interpretatione naturae proemium&#146;, composed in 1603, asserted Bacon's plans: &#145;Now among all the benefits that could be conferred upon mankind, I found none so great as the discovery of new arts, endowments, and commodities for the bettering of man's life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 10.84). In &#145;Scala intellectus, sive, Filum labyrinthi&#146;, a tract written in English, perhaps in 1607, he declared that his aim was to produce &#145;active and operative knowledge&#146;  (ibid., 3.503). A singular mistake in the dominant view of &#145;sciences&#146; was that they had to be &#145;believed and accepted&#146;. Bacon insisted, however, that they should &#145;be examined and further discovered&#146;. It was, he added, &#145;natural to arts to be in perpetual agitation and growth&#146;  (ibid., 3.498, 502).<br>
<br>Bacon was convinced that the fulfilment of his programme required a wholesale change in the way in which men perceived knowledge and learning. But it also implied a new method of securing that knowledge. His first detailed methodological remarks occur in &#145;Valerius terminus of the interpretation of nature&#146; in 1603. It also contains the earliest account of his doctrine of Idols, which were the systematic forms of error to which the human mind is subject: Idols of the Tribe, the Palace (later this was replaced by Market-place), the Cave, and the Theatre. In <span class="italic">The Advancement of Learning</span> Bacon also offered a devastating critique of current methodology, and by 1608 he reminded himself to finish his new method in natural philosophy under the title &#145;The key of interpretation&#146; (&#145;Clavis interpretationis&#146;), entertaining the idea of publishing it in France.<br>
<br>From this period also comes the earliest evidence of Bacon's conception of natural and experimental histories and their centrality to the new natural philosophy or science. In <span class="italic">The Advancement of Learning</span> Bacon discussed extant natural histories, their deficiencies and the ways to improve them, noting &#145;the use of History Mechanical is of all others the most radical and fundamental towards natural philosophy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bacon</span>, ed. Vickers, 178). In &#145;Redargutio philosophiarum&#146; (1608) he pointed out that true natural philosophy should draw its material from &#145;natural history and mechanical experiences&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.583), and in a fragmentary piece entitled &#145;Cogitationes de scientia humana&#146; (composed perhaps in 1604) he discussed this at greater length. The &#145;Cogitationes de rerum natura&#146;, perhaps also written in 1604, contains speculative discussions of bodies, the vacuum, and motion, defending Democritean atomism. In his private memoranda of 1608 Bacon listed various topics which urgently needed investigation. In the &#145;Phaenomena universi&#146;, written perhaps in 1611, he offered an introduction to and an example of natural history. He announced that an entirely new natural history was necessary before the &#145;instauration of the sciences&#146; could take place  (Bacon, <span class="italic">Philosophical Studies</span>, 7).<br>
<br>It was between 1607 and 1611 that Bacon started to conceive his entire philosophical plan as consisting of six books (or later six parts). But he not only charted such an extensive programme: at the same time he endeavoured to carry it out. At the beginning of the second book of <span class="italic">The Advancement of Learning</span> he made a bold attempt to invite James to begin a complete reform of the institutions of learning, including founding libraries and research institutes, raising the funding of universities and the salaries of professors, as well as initiating international scholarly co-operation.<br>
<br>In his private notes of 1608 Bacon listed the names of several men, including even the fourteen-year-old Prince Henry, whom he thought of as potential patrons of his programme, and he planned to enlist foreign support. He had clearly lost some confidence in the older generation and looked to the younger and even future generations to take up his call. In 1609 he wrote that &#145;my writings should not court the present time&#146; but rather &#145;future ages&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 11.135). He was also cognizant of the great labour needed in collecting natural histories. Although he criticized existing institutions in <span class="italic">The Advancement of Learning</span> three years later he listed several of them (the schools of Westminster, Eton, and Winchester, Trinity College and St John's College, Cambridge, and Magdalen College, Oxford) as potential places of support. But he also reminded himself of international co-operation and of founding a new college &#145;for Inventors&#146; which would have the necessary equipment, including a library and a laboratory  (ibid., 11.66).<br>
<br>By 1609 Bacon, corresponding with his closest friend Toby Matthew, confidently called his natural philosophical programme an &#145;<i>Instauration</i>&#146; and assured him that it &#145;sleeps not&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 11.134&#150;5). But he noted that religious controversies were a serious threat to his entire programme. In one of these letters to Matthew, written on 10 October 1609, Bacon famously referred to himself as:<blockquote>the miller of Huntingdon, that was wont to pray for peace amongst the willows; for while the winds blew, the wind-mills wrought, and the water-mill was less customed. So I see that controversies of religion must hinder the advancement of sciences. (ibid., 11.137&#150;8)</blockquote>Furthermore religion and philosophy should be kept separate for, as Bacon told Matthew, the world must not &#145;reject truth in philosophy, because the author dissenteth in religion&#146;  (ibid., 11.145).<br>
<br>There is some irony in the fact that these letters exist partly because of the heightened religious controversy which Bacon deplored. Matthew, son of the archbishop of York and a Catholic convert, was exiled for refusing to take the oath of allegiance imposed on Catholics in the aftermath of the Gunpowder Plot. Bacon and Matthew, unable to meet, were forced to correspond.<br>
<br>In 1609 Bacon published the <span class="italic">De sapientia veterum</span>, a collection of thirty-one ancient myths complete with his interpretations of their allegories. Although traditionally listed under literary works the <span class="italic">De sapientia veterum</span> treats various philosophical issues and has more recently been seen as an important contribution to both his natural and civil philosophy. In 1611 he wrote an unfinished tract &#145;De principiis atque originibus&#146;, which was designed to contain interpretations of the myths of the principles and origins of things, but in fact contains only the first. A short tract on tidal motion&#151;&#145;De fluxu et refluxu maris&#146;&#151;has also been dated to 1611.<br>
<br>In 1612 Bacon wrote an unfinished paper entitled &#145;Descriptio globi intellectualis&#146;, which was meant to be the beginning of the first book or part of the &#145;Instauratio&#146;. It presented the classification or partition of sciences and was thus meant to survey the state of knowledge and learning&#151;the intellectual globe. Bacon had, of course, done such a survey in the second book of <span class="italic">The Advancement of Learning</span>, but this had been written before he had any six-part plan. &#145;Descriptio&#146; was thus meant to be a revision on Ramist lines of book two of <span class="italic">The Advancement of Learning</span>. &#145;Descriptio&#146; was only a small fraction of the whole first part. Surveying all the branches of learning and their deficiencies with the same meticulousness as the extant fraction does would have produced a gigantic work.<br>
<br>Almost immediately after &#145;Descriptio&#146; Bacon wrote a brief text entitled &#145;Thema coeli&#146; on cosmology and astronomy. Since Bacon was convinced that the primary aim of philosophy was to bring great benefits for the whole of humankind, to improve its material conditions, and even to restore the prelapsarian state of felicity, the prolongation of life lay at the heart of his whole project. Indeed, as early as 1603 he had announced that &#145;immortality (if it were possible)&#146; was among &#145;the true ends of knowledge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.222). Some time during the 1610s he also composed (and kept revising until he abandoned it unfinished) his earliest surviving treatise on the prolongation of life, entitled &#145;De viis mortis&#146;, which was discovered only in 1978.<br>
<br>During the decade from 1603 to 1613 Bacon thus pursued various parts of his natural philosophical project vigorously but in a somewhat eclectic manner and was not in a hurry to publish anything. As he told Lancelot Andrewes in 1609, &#145;I hasten not to publish&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 11.141). Writing to Toby Matthew the following February Bacon explained his working habits: &#145;My great work goeth forward; and after my manner, I alter ever when I add. So that nothing is finished till all be finished&#146;  (ibid., 11.145).<h2>
<a name="Thezenithofthepoliticalcareer"></a>The zenith of the political career</h2>In 1608 Bacon had only a little official business as solicitor-general, and it was a period of intense literary activity. In addition to the natural philosophical treatises mentioned above he produced a memorial of Queen Elizabeth entitled &#145;In felicem memoriam Reginae Elizabethae&#146;, which was composed according to the principles of demonstrative rhetoric. Towards the end of the year he wrote a treatise on Ireland entitled &#145;Certain considerations touching the plantation in Ireland&#146;, which he presented to James as a new year's gift. The main aim of Bacon's short treatise was to find means of inducing the best possible people to undertake the plantation project. The treatise was thus a piece in deliberative rhetoric which aimed at persuading people to a desired course of action (plantation), appealing to the classical deliberative <i>loci</i> of honour and profit.<br>
<br>In winter 1608&#150;9 Bacon was involved in the case of the jurisdiction of the council in the marches, defending the council. As early as 1607 he had prepared a paper on the issue. It was in this debate that Bacon employed absolutist principles. It had been argued that the king's prerogatives were given to him by the common law, but Bacon replied with a staple absolutist argument that the king held some of his prerogatives &#145;mediately from the law, but immediately from God&#146;. Some of his prerogatives were indeed of such nature that they could be disputed &#145;in his ordinary courts of Justice&#146;. But &#145;his sovereign power&#146; could not be censured by any judge. Because &#145;the end of all government&#146; was the &#145;preservation of the public&#146;, it was &#145;necessary&#146; that the king could flout the law. As soon as &#145;prerogatives are made envious or subject to the constructions of laws&#146; a monarchy, Bacon argued, would degenerate into an aristocracy or oligarchy, and &#145;further way may be opened to Parliament or lawyers to dispute more liberties&#146;. He warned that those who wanted to limit prerogatives by &#145;subjects' birthrights and laws&#146; were perhaps opening &#145;a gap unto new Barons' wars&#146;. A good king did indeed govern by the law. Had not James himself admitted that &#145;God forbid &hellip; that we should be governed by men's discretions and not by the law&#146;? But this did not entail the limitation of the royal power by the law, for the king was accountable to God alone  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 10.371&#150;2, 380).<br>
<br>In the last two sessions of James's first parliament, which sat in 1610, Bacon was a royal official for the first time. In the fierce debates about whether the king had the right of impositions Bacon defended the king not by absolutist arguments but by advocating a balanced constitution. &#145;The King's Sovereignty and the Liberty of Parliament are as the two elements and principles of this estate &hellip; [which] do not cross or destroy the one the other, but they strengthen and maintain the one the other&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 11.177). By evoking such a view Bacon clearly tried to avoid getting involved in ideological disputes, but its reception was ambivalent. As Nicholas Fuller commented on Bacon's speech: &#145;though Mr. Solicitor's speech were full of rhetoric and art, yet it had some good substance in it&#146;  (Foster, 2.98).<br>
<br>Later Bacon gave another speech in which he defended the king's right of impositions, again insisting that the question was &#145;<i>de vero et falso</i>, and not <i>de bono et malo</i>; of the legal point, and not of the inconvenience&#146;. So the question was reduced &#145;whether the King have not such a prerogative by law&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 11.191). The next speaker, Thomas Hedley, gave Bacon a lie direct: &#145;though it was said by one of the King's learned counsel that this question was not a question of <i>bonum et malum</i>, but of <i>vera et falsa</i>&#146;, yet it was &#145;a good and necessary argument to say, it is ill for the good of the commonwealth, ergo, no law&#146;  (Foster, 2.176). Whereas Bacon had defended the king's right of impositions by legal precedents Hedley countered by announcing that the whole excellence of the common law was precisely that it was constantly redefined in the light of new circumstances. If this were not the case, Hedley argued quoting Bacon's <span class="italic">Advancement of Learning</span>, judges would have been devoid of &#145;versatile <i>ingenium</i>&#146; and &#145;subject to the reproof of <i>idem manebat neque idem decebat</i>&#146;  (ibid., 2.178). Hedley ended his long speech by appealing to &#145;the ancient freedom and liberty&#146; of the Englishman, and made use of the speech which Bacon had delivered in the committee of grievances on 19 May. Finally he paraphrased lengthy passages from Bacon's speech of 17 February 1607 where Bacon had defended the Anglo-Scottish union by his theory of civic greatness. &#145;It is&#146;, Hedley declared:<blockquote>the sinews of men's arms then (namely a valiant, populous and military nation), as hath been well observed and collected by one of the worthies of this House, that there are the true sinews of war and hath made our nation so renowned through the world. (ibid., 2.195)</blockquote>In August 1610 Bacon's mother, Anne, Lady Bacon, died. It was also about 1610 that Bacon returned to his essays. He was preparing another edition and planned to dedicate it to Prince Henry. The prince had made Bacon his own solicitor, and in 1611 he appointed him steward of King's Langley in the duchy of Lancaster. Bacon was hoping for the prince's support for some higher position, and the edition of essays was intended to demonstrate his abilities as a counsellor. Bacon had already written the dedication, but Prince Henry suddenly died in November 1612 just before the edition came out and Bacon rededicated it to his brother-in-law, Sir John Constable. The edition contained thirty-eight essays, many of which analyse civil business from a much broader perspective than the first edition. It sold even better than the first edition and was reprinted six times between 1612 and 1624.<br>
<br>Bacon had expressed hopes of preferment to the king early in 1611 and by the autumn had received a promise of the attorney-general's place. In May 1612 Bacon's cousin, the earl of Salisbury, died. This prompted Bacon both to censure Salisbury's competence as a politician and to recommend himself as an able successor. In all these suits for preferment Bacon consistently presented himself as the king's man. Writing to the king after Salisbury's death he stressed his &#145;little skill&#146; in parliamentary business but hastened to add that he was &#145;a perfect and peremptory royalist&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 11.280). Writing to the king's new favourite Robert Carr, Viscount Rochester, he noted that &#145;the Attorney and the Solicitor are as the King's champions for civil business&#146;. In 1613 he recommended himself to the place of attorney-general on the grounds that he would be able &#145;to recover that strength to the King's prerogative which it hath had in times past, and which is due unto it&#146;  (ibid., 11.280, 342, 381).<br>
<br>After Salisbury's death Bacon acquired growing importance as a statesman and counsellor to James. Finally on 27 October 1613 he was appointed attorney-general. The years as solicitor and attorney became busier and busier with legal work. Among these in 1612 were the prosecutions of Lord Sanquhar for killing an English fencing master, and of James Whitelocke and Robert Mansell for slandering the king's commission of inquiry into the navy. As attorney-general, among Bacon's first tasks was to abolish duelling&#151;a recent social habit which rapidly gained ground in the early 1610s. In autumn 1613 Bacon suggested that a proclamation should be published against duelling, proposing that the offenders should be prosecuted in star chamber. In January he brought a convenient case of two obscure persons before the court. Bacon's charge, together with the decree of the court, was soon published. The actual proclamation was published in February 1614 with a treatise, entitled <span class="italic">A Publication of His Majesties Edict, and Severe Censure against Private Combats and Combatants</span>. Some contemporaries attributed the treatise to Bacon, but it was composed by the earl of Northampton.<br>
<br>According to Northampton the best strategy for abolishing duelling was to replace it by a court of honour. Bacon, however, insisted that such a strategy merely served the contrary purpose. By accepting the notion of courtesy, honour, and insult of the duelling theory, the court of honour would encourage men to fight duels. The only way to eradicate duelling, Bacon believed, was to discredit the underlying theory.<br>
<br>More important issues at the beginning of Bacon's career as attorney were the king's finances and relations with parliament. Bacon had recommended calling a new parliament as early as 1612. In autumn that year he wrote to the king that &#145;your Majesty's recovery must be by the medicines of the Galenists and Arabians, and not of the Chemists or Paracelsians&#146;. The recovery could not in other words be achieved &#145;by any one fine extract or strong water&#146; but rather &#145;by a skilful compound of a number of ingredients&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 11.312). Northampton, who was James's chief minister from Salisbury's death until his own death in June 1614, was against calling a new parliament. Bacon disagreed. In 1613 or very early 1614 Bacon again urged James to call a new parliament, arguing that &#145;parliament hath been the ordinary remedy to supply the King's wants&#146;. He was convinced that the disappointing conflicts of the 1610 sessions could easily be avoided partly because Salisbury would no longer create envy and partly because &#145;the opposite party heretofore is now dissolved and broken&#146;  (ibid., 11.365).<br>
<br>Bacon wanted to give the impression that the failures in parliament were not based on deep ideological division, but could be explained by political intrigues and faction. He suggested that some course should be taken to avoid a packed house and &#145;to make men perceive that it is not safe [to] combine and make parties in Parliament, but that men be left to their consciences and free votes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 11.368). More important, the king &#145;should not descend below&#146; himself; &#145;those tragical arguments and (as the schoolmen call them) ultimities of persuasions which were used last Parliament should for ever be abolished&#146;. Instead, the king should act &#145;in a more familiar, but yet a more princely like manner&#146;  (ibid., 11.369, 371). James must not use &#145;the language of a Merchant &hellip; crying of his royalties to sale&#146;. But neither should he act as &#145;a Tyrant&#146;, telling the MPs that &#145;he most set upon the tenters his laws and prerogatives, if they will not supply him&#146;  (ibid., 12.26). If the king should thus keep away from airing absolutist principles the MPs should no less forbear from using ideological arguments. Bacon seemed to believe that the grave problems which surfaced in parliament could be avoided as long as men set their ideological arguments aside.<br>
<br>The new parliament met in April 1614. Bacon was returned for St Albans and Ipswich as well as for Cambridge University, sitting eventually for Cambridge. Almost immediately the question was raised whether, as attorney-general, Bacon was eligible to sit in the Commons. Without a clear precedent Bacon was allowed to sit, but in future the attorney-general would be ineligible. James carefully followed Bacon's advice, telling the Commons several times that he &#145;would not deal with you like a merchant&#146; or &#145;by way of a bargain&#146;. He also distanced himself from absolutism, saying that he had never meant to &#145;stretch his prerogatives&#146;  (M. Jansson, <span class="italic">Proceedings in Parliament, 1614</span>, 1988, 44, 17, 141). None the less, without passing any legislation the parliament was dissolved after eight weeks. Bacon was unrepentant and insisted after the session to the king that he must rebut &#145;the opinion which is sometimes muttered, That his Majesty will call no more Parliaments&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 12.85, 176).<br>
<br>In legal cases against Catholics, spawned by the oath of allegiance, Bacon also displayed reluctance to get involved in an ideological dispute. In January 1614, rather than developing a theoretical response, Bacon simply showered abuse on the Catholic resistance theorists. Their opinions, he argued in a similar case in king's bench in 1615, required rather &#145;detestation than contestation&#146;. Those who wrote in favour of resistance or regicide deserved:<blockquote>rather some holy league amongst all Christian Princes of either religion, Papists and Protestants, for the extirping and razing of this opinion and the authors thereof from the face of the earth, as the common enemies of mankind, than the stile of pen or speech. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 12.165, 154)</blockquote>During Christmas 1613 Bacon had been involved in preparing a masque to celebrate the marriage of the king's Scottish favourite Robert Carr, the earl of Somerset, to Frances Howard, whose marriage to the third earl of Essex had been annulled the previous September. <span class="italic">The Masque of Flowers</span> was performed on twelfth night and printed soon afterwards with a dedication to Bacon. Somerset's position as James's principal favourite did not last long. By the end of 1615 his career was destroyed in a trial in star chamber, conducted by Bacon, for the murder of his former friend Sir Thomas Overbury. In May 1616, with Bacon acting as the chief prosecutor, both the earl and the countess of Somerset were tried, convicted, and sentenced to death, although this was commuted to imprisonment in the Tower.<br>
<br>The downfall of Somerset and the entire Howard faction coincided with the meteoric rise of George Villiers, the son of a minor Leicestershire gentleman, who was introduced to the king in late summer 1614. Just as his friendship with Essex had dominated a central period of Bacon's early career so his close relationship to Villiers (later earl, marquess, and duke of Buckingham) had a crucial impact on his later career. Bacon's earliest existing letter to Villiers dates from January 1616, by which time a familiar acquaintance had been formed between them. Bacon had always emphasized the central importance of public service to the earl of Essex; similarly, in August 1616, when George Villiers was created Viscount Villiers, Bacon reminded him that &#145;it is the life of an ox or beast always to eat, and never to exercise; but men are born (and specially christian men), not to cram in their fortunes, but to exercise their virtues&#146;. Villiers should dedicate himself &#145;to the public&#146; and &#145;countenance, and encourage, and advance able men and virtous men and meriting men&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 13.6). There are also extant two different versions of a detailed advice letter which Bacon apparently wrote to Villiers at this time.<br>
<br>As attorney-general Bacon defended the king in numerous legal cases. In January 1616 he wrote to the king, noting that &#145;it pleased your Majesty to commit to my care and trust, for Westminster Hall matters, three particulars: that of the <i>Rege inconsulto</i> &hellip; that of the <i>Commendans</i> &hellip; and that of <i>Habeas Corpora</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 12.233). When Bacon gave his argument in king's bench concerning the first case he, according to his own account, &#145;lost not one auditor&#146; and even Edward Coke had thought &#145;it was a famous argument&#146;  (ibid., 12.235). This case touched royal prerogatives, but it was the two other cases later in 1616 which brought the king and Edward Coke into collision. In June 1616 Coke was excluded from the privy council and was ordered to amend his reports. The result did not satisfy the king and in November 1616 Coke was removed from king's bench, and later from the privy council, and finally from office altogether. In 1613 Coke had been removed from the chief justiceship of common pleas to that of king's bench on Bacon's advice. This, Bacon had argued, had been &#145;a kind of discipline to him for opposing himself in the King's causes&#146;  (ibid., 11.382). Now, in 1616, Bacon played an equally prominent role in Coke's removal, and prepared its explanation. Coke had been, Bacon wrote, &#145;a perpetual turbulent carriage, first towards the liberties of his [the king's] church and the state ecclesiastical; then towards his prerogative royal, and the branches thereof; and likewise towards all the settled jurisdictions of his other courts&#146;  (ibid., 13.95).<br>
<br>The rapidly growing public and legal business which Bacon conducted reflected his growing importance. But Bacon also expected that it would reflect on his official position. In February 1616, when the lord chancellor, Ellesmere, fell ill, Bacon advertised himself as the fittest candidate to replace him. He especially warned James not to appoint Coke whom he called &#145;an over-ruling nature&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 12.242). Bacon's expectations were somewhat premature, for Ellesmere recovered. Bacon immediately wrote to Villiers, suggesting that Villiers promote his suit for a place in the privy council, and he reminded Villiers of it at the end of May, pointing out that &#145;the time is &hellip; now or never&#146;  (ibid., 12.347). James made Bacon choose between a promise that he would succeed Ellesmere or a place on the privy council. Bacon chose the latter and was sworn a privy councillor on 9 June 1616.<br>
<br>This was an appropriate moment for Bacon to return to one of his lifelong projects: the reformation of the English laws. He had mentioned it to James in 1614 but now in 1616 he made a more comprehensive proposal &#145;touching the compiling and amendment of the laws of England&#146;. Bacon explained his proposal by telling the king that &#145;the law is my profession&#146; and that &#145;your Majesty hath set me in an eminent place&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 13.62). The plan was not to alter the law's substance but rather to improve its organization. Bacon had to wait nine months before James accepted Ellesmere's resignation, and on 7 March 1617 Bacon took the office of lord keeper. Before being able to move to York House, the lord keeper's usual residence, he leased Dorset House for two terms from the earl of Dorset. In May 1617 Bacon took his seat in the court of chancery, declaring his programme for the office. He perceived that the defence of the king was his and other judges' &#145;lanthorn&#146;. In his speech to Sir John Denham, who was sworn as a baron of exchequer in 1617, Bacon told him that &#145;above all you ought to maintain the King's prerogative, and to set down with yourself that the King's prerogative and the law are not two things; but the King's prerogative is law, and the principal part of the law&#146;  (ibid., 13.184, 203).<br>
<br>Only a week after Bacon's appointment in March the king and Villiers (who had been created earl of Buckingham) left London for Scotland. While this enhanced Bacon's status in London, it also brought difficulties. Ever since his dismissal Edward Coke had worked hard to regain his former position. Late in 1616 he had plans for his daughter Frances to marry Buckingham's brother Sir John Villiers. In June 1617 Coke renewed the marriage negotiations, but Coke's wife, Lady Hatton, opposed these plans, hid her daughter, and contacted Bacon for support (Bacon had of course competed with Coke for her hand twenty years earlier). When the mother of Buckingham and the intended groom applied to Bacon on Coke's behalf for a warrant to recover the bride, Bacon refused it, lending his support to Lady Hatton. As well as thwarting Coke's plans Bacon clearly believed that he was doing a favour to Buckingham. He wrote to Buckingham on 12 July 1617, claiming that &#145;Secretary Winwood hath officiously busied himself to make a match between your brother and Sir Edward Coke's daughter: and, as we hear, he doth it rather to make a faction, than out of any great affection to your Lordship&#146;. The match, Bacon assured, would be &#145;very inconvenient both for your brother and yourself&#146;. Buckingham himself would &#145;lose all such your friends as are adverse to Sir Edward Coke; (myself only except, who out of a pure love and thankfulness shall ever be firm to you)&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 13.223&#150;4).<br>
<br>On 25 July 1617 Bacon wrote to the king expressing his dislike of the proposed match. Describing the excellent present state of the kingdom in general and the rise of the king's &#145;prerogative and authority&#146; in particular, Bacon warned the king that the proposed match would put all this in jeopardy:<blockquote>if there be but an opinion of his [Coke's] coming in with the strength of such an alliance, it will give a turn and relapse in men's minds unto the former state of things, hardly to be holpen; to the great weakening of your Majesty's service. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 13.233)</blockquote>There was an ominous silence. Soon, however, Bacon learned that both Buckingham and James were furious. Buckingham told him that &#145;you have carried yourself with much scorn and neglect both toward myself and friends&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 13.237). The king's letter to Bacon is lost, but from Bacon's response is learned that it contained &#145;some matter of dislike, in which respect it hath grieved me more than any event which hath fallen out in my life&#146;  (ibid., 13.238). Bacon was ready to change his mind about the marriage, but could hardly make amends to the king, who wrote him a devastating letter in late August. In his reply Bacon could only hope for the speedy return of the king to London, &#145;expecting that that sun which when it went from us left us cold weather, and now it is returned towards us hath brought with it a blessed harvest&#146;  (ibid., 13.246). When James and Buckingham returned to London in mid-September Bacon received from Buckingham a reassurance of reconciliation and responded immediately: &#145;Your Lordship's pen or rather pencil hath pourtrayed towards me such magnanimity and nobleness and true kindness, as methinketh I see the image of some ancient virtue, and not any thing of these times&#146;  (ibid., 13.252).<br>
<br>In making an abject submission to Buckingham, Bacon clearly understood that being the favourite's friend meant being his faithful servant. Bacon played this role dutifully and also reaped the concomitant harvest. In August 1617 he had moved to York House, the residence of lord keeper, where he had been born. In October the death of the secretary, Sir Ralph Winwood, strengthened his position in government. James did not appoint a new secretary of state and Buckingham and Bacon were the two most powerful men under the king. The new year brought new honours: Bacon was made lord chancellor on 7 January 1618 and on 12 July he was raised to the peerage and created Baron Verulam of Verulam. Thereon he styled himself Francis, Lord Verulam&#151;never Lord Bacon as subsequent generations have often styled him.<br>
<br>As the most eminent lawyer in the country Bacon was called upon to sit in judgment on notable men. In October 1618 he was among the six privy councillors who were on the commission to examine and ultimately to condemn Sir Walter Ralegh for his disastrous trip to search for a mine in Guiana. It was Bacon who delivered the death sentence to Ralegh on 22 October 1618. A year later he was involved in the star chamber case against the earl of Suffolk, who was accused of misappropriating money when he had been lord treasurer. After yet another year Bacon, in autumn 1620, prosecuted attorney-general Sir Henry Yelverton in star chamber.<br>
<br>But most of Bacon's days were filled with the routine of smaller cases in chancery. In many of these Buckingham contacted Bacon in favour of parties. By the end of January 1618 Buckingham wrote to Bacon:<blockquote>I have received your Lordship's letters, wherein I see the continuance of your love and respect to me in any thing I write to you of, for which I give your Lordship many thanks, desiring nothing for any man but what you shall find just and convenient to pass. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 13.297)</blockquote>By and large, however, Bacon's career in chancery was highly successful. He worked with exemplary efficiency and conscientiousness. He made the court sit mornings and afternoons and extended the term &#145;for the expediting and clearing of the causes of the court&#146;. Within three months of his appointment Bacon had cleared the backlog. His rules for chancery (ordinances in chancery) emphasized expedition and fairness, limiting jurisdictional conflict and eliminating vexatious suits. The rules also sought to increase accuracy of record keeping and dealt with numerous specific abuses in detail. Bacon's career in chancery also resulted in the improvement in its relationship with the common law courts. For Bacon the equity jurisdiction was a complementary system of justice, not a rival to the common law.<br>
<br>Bacon's success is most evident in his concrete work in chancery. The court gained in popularity, the number of cases increasing during his term but dropping dramatically after his impeachment, and very few of his decisions were reversed, even then. There is ample evidence to suggest that despite his subsequent impeachment Bacon in fact frequently intervened to prevent even the appearance of improper influence or conflict of interest in chancery proceedings.<br>
<br>Bacon had always favoured the summoning of parliament. Even after the disastrous session of 1614 he had emphasized to the king its central importance. In 1617 he wrote to James that &#145;I was ever for a Parliament; which seemeth to me to be <i>cardo rerum</i> or <i>summa summarum</i> for the present occasions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 13.233). Bacon was thus enthusiastic when, early in October 1620, he was asked with other &#145;old Parliament-men&#146; to advise the king how, &#145;without packing or degenerate arts, [to] prepare to a Parliament&#146;  (ibid., 14.114). He immediately set to work, thinking that &#145;the former grievances&#146; and new potential problems needed to be carefully perused. It was important to consider &#145;what persons were fit to be of the House&#146;. Equally crucial was &#145;the framing and having ready of some commonwealth bills, that may add respect to the King's government and acknowledgement of his care&#146;. In all these it was of utmost importance to proceed with caution and secrecy. In particular, &#145;that which concerneth persons is not so fit to be communicated to the council-table&#146;. Bacon realized that the king's finances would be the most pressing issue in the coming parliament; as he told Buckingham, &#145;the state of his Majesty's treasure still maketh me sad&#146;. This must be reported to James &#145;faithfully and freely; for to flatter in this, were to betray his Majesty with a kiss&#146;  (ibid., 14.115&#150;16).<br>
<br>By 18 October Bacon sent a proposed proclamation for the parliament. According to Bacon, although James was peace loving, the &#145;invasion of the Palatinate&#146; had altered &#145;the balance of Christendom&#146;, and &#145;the reason of state&#146; now demanded the king to take action. The king, Bacon's draft suggested, was therefore seeking &#145;the faithful advice and general assent of our loving subjects&#146;. Even more important, &#145;moneys being the sinews of war&#146;, it was of utmost importance that the king receive &#145;some large and bountiful help of treasure from our people&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 14.126). The king was, however, highly suspicious of revealing matters of state and the reasons for calling the parliament, &#145;whereof neither the people are capable, nor is it fit for his Majesty to open now unto them&#146;. Bacon replied to Buckingham (who had passed on the king's opinion) that &#145;neither would I have thought of inserting matter of state for the vulgar, but that now-a-days there is no vulgar, but all statesmen&#146;  (ibid., 14.128&#150;9).<br>
<br>Another matter which needed careful planning was grievances. Among these the committee had listed patents and monopolies and hoped that the king would revoke unpopular patents and monopolies before parliament gathered. The matter was debated in the council on 14 December where Bacon vigorously argued for revoking the most notorious patents, but was overruled by the majority.<br>
<br>The parliament assembled on 30 January 1621. Bacon was clearly at the pinnacle of his career. He had celebrated his sixtieth birthday with a lavish banquet at York House on 22 January 1621, and on 27 January he had been created Viscount St Alban.<h2>
<a name="InstauratiomagnaandNovumorganum"></a>Instauratio magna and Novum organum</h2>The turn of the year 1620&#150;21 was also the climax of Bacon's philosophical work. While he had been extremely productive in his natural philosophical work between 1603 and 1612, after 1613, when he was appointed attorney-general, public business began to take a heavy toll and the periods when he could produce his &#145;vacation's fruits&#146; became shorter and rarer. As lord keeper he made chancery sit mornings and afternoons and extended the term, reserving only &#145;the depth of the three long vacations &hellip; for studies, arts, and sciences&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 13.190). Bacon must have dedicated most of these depths to preparing his major philosophical work, the <span class="italic">Novum organum</span>, which was published together with the preliminary material of his entire philosophical plan&#151;the &#145;Instauratio magna&#146;&#151;in October 1620. The volume consisted of a preface, a plan of the whole work, the incomplete second part (<span class="italic">Novum organum</span>), and a preparative to the third part of natural and experimental histories, as well as a catalogue of particular histories.<br>
<br>In sending a copy of the book to the king Bacon explained his overall scheme and the particular intention of the <span class="italic">Novum organum</span>:<blockquote>The work, in what colours soever it may be set forth, is no more but a new logic, teaching to invent and judge by induction, (as finding syllogism incompetent for sciences of nature), and thereby to make philosophy and sciences both more true and more active. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 14.119&#150;20)</blockquote>The ultimate goal, he told the king, was nothing less than &#145;to enlarge the bounds of Reason and to endow man's estate with new value&#146;  (ibid.). James thanked Bacon profusely for the volume and promised &#145;to read it thorough with care and attention, though I should steal some hours from my sleep&#146;, and then &#145;to use the liberty of a true friend, in not sparing to ask you the question in any point whereof I shall stand in doubt&#146;  (ibid., 14.122).<br>
<br>James's proposal raised serious doubts in Bacon's mind. It was one thing for Bacon to call James &#145;the wisest and most learned of kings&#146;. It was quite another if the king took it upon himself to instruct Bacon in natural philosophy. The <span class="italic">Novum organum</span>, Bacon replied, &#145;doth disclaim to be tried by any thing but by experience, and the resultats of experience in a true way&#146;. But he hastened to add that &#145;the sharpness and profoundness of your majesty's judgment ought to be an exception to this general rule; and your questions, observations, and admonishments, may do infinite good&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 14.130). None of these questions, observations, and admonishments were forthcoming. In early February John Chamberlain revealed why: &#145;the King cannot forbeare somtimes in reading his last book [<span class="italic">Novum organum</span>] to say that yt is like the peace of God, that passeth all understanding&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 2.339).<br>
<br>The king was not the only person who received a copy of the <span class="italic">Novum organum</span>. Bacon sent three copies to the diplomat Henry Wotton in Vienna. Wotton acknowledged the receipt of them in December and told Bacon that he had presented one of them to the famous astronomer Johann Kepler. Modern scholarship has often argued that Bacon was intellectually a provincial, that he was only a well-educated English gentleman who, classical sources apart, made use of a fairly limited range of popular encyclopaedic works in his natural philosophical writings  (Jardine, 6&#150;7, 9). The fact that Kepler received a copy of the <span class="italic">Novum organum</span> within two months of its publication and that Wotton also fulfilled his earlier promise to Bacon of reporting &#145;<i>Philosophical</i> experiments&#146; suggests otherwise. Bacon actively participated in the vanguard of the philosophical discussions of the day. In 1616 Toby Matthew had informed Bacon of Galileo's defence of Copernican astronomy  (Bacon, <span class="italic">The New Organon</span>, x). Three years later Matthew told Bacon that Galileo had written a response to Bacon's &#145;discourse concerning the flux and reflux of the sea&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 14.36).<br>
<br>At the heart of Bacon's plan for the &#145;Instauratio magna&#146; lay a novel view of natural philosophy. He wanted to replace the Aristotelian image of science as a contemplation and organization of eternal truths long since discovered by a conception of science as a discovery of the unknown, and also to create a truly active or operative science, to be seen not so much as a contemplative <i>episteme</i> as part of the practical, active life. In his attempt to link human science (<i>scientia</i>) and human power (<i>potentia</i>) Bacon was making a novel claim which altered the function of science in human life.<br>
<br>In the plan of the work of the &#145;Instauratio magna&#146; Bacon described the six-part division of this whole programme:<blockquote>
<div>1. The Divisions of the Sciences.<br>
</div>
<div>2. The New Organon; or Directions for the Interpretation of Nature.<br>
</div>
<div>3. The Phenomena of the Universe; or a Natural and Experimental History for the Foundation of Philosophy.<br>
</div>
<div>4. The Ladder of the Intellect.<br>
</div>
<div>5. Forerunners, or Anticipations of Second Philosophy.<br>
</div>
<div>6. Second Philosophy; or Active Science.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>The second part, the <span class="italic">Novum organum</span>, was further divided into two books. The first book is a short refutation of the impediments (idols) which hinder the acceptance of the new method. Its intention is to prepare the reader to embrace the new method presented in the much longer, though incomplete, second book.<br>
<br>According to Bacon, a crucial weakness in the old Aristotelian logic was that it jumped from empirical particulars to first principles (axioms), which formed the premises of deductive reasoning. But Bacon believed that the most general axioms should form the end rather than the beginning of scientific inference, and his own methodology was designed to avoid Aristotle's mistake. Natural histories (systematic accounts of natural phenomena) form the basis of all natural philosophy. For Bacon it was a serious mistake to assume (as Aristotle had done) that experience gives the human mind things as they are: our senses are unreliable&#151;our mind is &#145;like an enchanted glass&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.395). Rather than becoming a sceptic, however, Bacon took the sceptics' arguments in his stride, insisting that in order to yield reliable information human senses needed methodological assistance. Baconian logic proceeded along a strict hierarchy of increasing generality. A key role in it was intended for the induction of exclusion whereby all the wrong causes are eliminated or excluded, leaving only the true causes. The whole process is completed only when the fundamental laws of nature (the knowledge of forms) have been reached and, from there, new experiments or works have been derived by practical deduction.<br>
<br>An important role in Bacon's methodology, both in collecting natural histories and in the inductive process from this material to the forms, is assigned to observations and experiments. Thus Bacon endeavoured to follow the contemporary scientific experiments carried out in England and Europe, and he emphasized the centrality of technical scientific instruments which made possible an increasing variety of experiments. Bacon himself not only carried out numerous chemical and mechanical experiments, he reported many of them in the <span class="italic">Novum organum</span>.<h2>
<a name="Impeachment"></a>Impeachment</h2>Bacon had not been wide of the mark in autumn 1620 when he predicted that patents and monopolies would be among the grievances presented in parliament. Attention was drawn to the issue of patents on the first full day of debate. Soon it was also asked who had sanctioned such grievances and had thus misled the king. When Sir Giles Mompesson's patent for inns came under scrutiny Buckingham, to whom Mompesson was related through marriage, became nervous and begged James to dissolve the parliament. The king refused, and the investigations continued. By the end of February another patent for gold and silver thread, whose profits had been divided among the king, Buckingham, and his brother, became a subject of enquiry. Soon it was revealed that Bacon, together with the lord treasurer, Montagu, had been a key figure as a legal referee certifying the original patents.<br>
<br>James visited the House of Lords on 10 March, expressing his hatred for &#145;projects and projectors&#146; and speaking of his willingness to protect his people from monopolies. Whereas Buckingham was singled out for praise James was ready to offer up Bacon and Montagu: &#145;As for the thinges objected against the Chancelor and the Treasurer, I leave them to answere for themselves and to stand and fall as they acquitt them selves&#146;  (Lady de Villiers, ed., <span class="italic">The Hastings Journal of the Parliament of 1621</span>, <span class="italic">Camden Miscellany</span>, 20, 1953, 26&#150;7).<br>
<br>Bacon defended himself by arguing that the referees could not be held responsible for the subsequent abuse of monopolies. Meanwhile allegations were brought before the parliamentary committee on courts of justice that he had accepted bribes. Bacon had taken gifts from two suitors whose trials had still been pending. He was shocked, and asked Buckingham to protect him. Bacon had never denied that he had taken these gifts; rather he insisted that they did not affect his decision, which had in fact gone against the suitors. Calling himself &#145;a good patriot born&#146; he wrote to the king on 25 March:<blockquote>And for the briberies and gifts wherewith I am charged, when the books of hearts shall be opened, I hope I shall not be found to have the troubled fountain of a corrupt heart in a depraved habit of taking rewards to pervert justice; howsoever I may be frail, and partake of the abuse of the times. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 14.226)</blockquote>It was during these troubled weeks that Bacon made his will. He bequeathed his &#145;compositions unpublished&#146; to his brother-in-law Sir John Constable, who was advised to publish those which he might find fit. In particular Bacon advised that &#145;In felicem memoriam Reginae Elizabethae&#146; should be published  (ibid., 14.228).<br>
<br>In order to prosecute Bacon the parliament revived an obsolete procedure of impeachment: the Commons acted as accusers and the Lords as judges. Working hard the committee had managed to find some twenty-eight cases where Bacon or his servants were accused of improperly accepting gifts or loans. Although many of these charges were dubious Bacon decided to give up. On 21 April he once more appealed to the king. Bacon of course understood that he had been unable to &#145;move your Majesty, by your absolute power of pardon or otherwise, to take my cause into your hands&#146;. Yet it was, he wrote to the king, &#145;the utmost of my desire&#146; that &#145;your Majesty will graciously save me from a sentence with the good liking of the House&#146;. This appeal was going to be &#145;the last suit I shall make to your Majesty in this business, prostrating myself at your mercy-seat, after fifteen years' service&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 14.241).<br>
<br>Bacon obviously realized that it was futile to put up a defence. The king's willingness to permit the trial would virtually ensure conviction  (Marwil, 56). On 22 April Bacon sent his &#145;humble submission and supplication&#146; to the Lords, craving for &#145;a benign interpretation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 14.242). His final &#145;Confession and humble Submission&#146; with responses to each charge was read to the Lords on 30 April. He confessed &#145;that I am guilty of corruption&#146;. His only attempt at extenuation was that, on the one hand, he was not known to be &#145;an avaricious man&#146; and, on the other, his &#145;estate&#146; was &#145;so mean and poor, as my care is now chiefly to satisfy my debts&#146;  (ibid., 14.261). Bacon's punishment included a fine of &pound;40,000 and imprisonment at the king's pleasure. He was also barred from any office or employment in the state and forbidden to sit in parliament or come within the verge (12 miles) of the court. The fine was never collected and his imprisonment in the Tower lasted only three days.<br>
<br>Although Bacon was impeached for taking bribes there is little doubt that underlying the whole impeachment was the attack against patents and monopolies. Bacon was thus a victim of a political campaign against the king's chief favourite, Buckingham. Neither James nor Buckingham did anything to help or protect Bacon. They abandoned him and thus made him the scapegoat for the grievances of monopolies. At the same time there is equally little doubt that there was a more personal factor in the impeachment. The whole attack against Bacon was to a considerable extent orchestrated by Edward Coke and Sir Lionel Cranfield, who were both his known enemies.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsanddeath"></a>Last years and death</h2>As soon as Bacon had been released from the Tower he wrote to Buckingham not only thanking him &#145;for getting me out of prison&#146; but also offering his services to the marquess and the king: &#145;now my body is out, my mind nevertheless will be still in prison, till I may be on my feet to do his Majesty and your Lordship faithful service&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 14.281). Bacon's financial situation looked bleak. He was living &#145;upon the scraps of my former fortunes&#146; but could not &#145;hold out longer&#146;. He therefore humbly asked Buckingham to fulfil his &#145;loving promises &hellip; to settle my poor fortunes&#146;  (ibid., 14.297&#150;8). He was given a generous pension of &pound;1200 a year but its payment was withheld by the new lord treasurer, Cranfield. Bacon was also asking for release from the ban against coming within the verge of the court. Buckingham, who coveted Bacon's lease of York House, used these favours as a means of forcing Bacon to part with it. Extremely reluctant to do so Bacon even offered Gorhambury to make amends, but in the end he sold the lease to Cranfield in March 1622, from whom it passed to Buckingham. As Sir Edward Sackville advised Bacon, &#145;if York-house were gone, the town were yours&#146;  (ibid., 14.343). Indeed, as soon as Bacon consented to sell the lease Buckingham helped him obtain leave to come within the verge.<br>
<br>Early in June 1621 Bacon wrote to the Spanish ambassador, Count Gondomar, that he was &#145;to retire from the stage of civil action and betake myself to letters&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 14.285). Comparing his fate with Demosthenes, Cicero, and Seneca, Bacon identified himself most closely with Seneca who, having been condemned, had &#145;abstained from intruding into matters of business&#146; and had &#145;spent his time in writing books of excellent argument and use for all ages&#146;. Yet Bacon also insisted that he could not &#145;altogether desert the civil person that I have borne&#146;  (ibid., 14.372&#150;3). Thus his literary activities were not confined to natural philosophy but included forays into other fields as well.<br>
<br>In his last appeal for James's help during the impeachment trial on 21 April Bacon had mentioned that if time permitted he would &#145;present your Majesty with a good history of England, and a better digest of your laws&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 14.242). In June he set himself to writing <span class="italic">The History of the Reign of King Henry VII</span>. He wrote with breathtaking speed, presenting the manuscript to the king early in October. The work was dedicated to Prince Charles and published in March 1622. It should be seen in the context of humanist historiography rather than as a precursor of its modern methods. Bacon was keenly interested in the conventional topics of virtue and fortune, but was unconventional in placing a much stronger emphasis on fortune than virtue. The central lesson of <span class="italic">The History of Henry VII</span> was that a ruler must remain open to accident and ready to seize the opportunities it offered.<br>
<br>Bacon planned to continue his career as a historian by writing a similar history of Henry VIII. He was sent material relating to the project, but, as he complained to Toby Matthew in 1623, Sir Robert Cotton had been &#145;somewhat dainty of his materials in this&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 14.429).<br>
<br>Early in 1622 Bacon cherished hopes of an interview with the king. Among the topics he planned to discuss with James were &#145;the recompiling of laws&#146; and a &#145;General Treatise <i>de Legibus et Justitia</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 14.351&#150;2). The hopes of an interview were dashed, but in March Bacon fulfilled his second promise given in April 1621 by sending the king &#145;An offer of a digest to be made of the laws of England&#146;, arguing that the English laws &#145;are as mixt as our language, compounded of British, Roman, Saxon, Danish, Norman customs; and surely as our language is thereby so much the richer, so our laws are likewise by that mixture the more complete&#146;  (ibid., 14.362). He was also working hard on the more theoretical treatises on law and justice which exist in two different versions: a recently unearthed manuscript treatise entitled &#145;Aphorismi de jure gentium maiore sive de fontibus justiciae et juris&#146;, and another which appeared in the eighth book of <span class="italic">De augmentis</span> in October 1623 with the title &#145;Exemplum tractatus de justitia universali, sive de fontibus juris&#146;.<br>
<br>Bacon argued that the remedy for the defects in contemporary law was to be sought from the Roman law, and he often related his own project of legal reform to Justinian's <span class="italic">Corpus juris civilis</span>. As his project developed the influence of the Roman law became more marked. Whereas in his early work &#145;Maxims of the law&#146; he had sought to integrate Roman law concepts into a common law context, by the early 1620s he was assimilating his common law experience into a Roman law context. Nevertheless Bacon's strong Roman law bias did not involve replacing the English common law by the Roman civil law. Rather it served to emphasize the universal scope of his project. Although many of Bacon's ideas reflected his common law experience he sought to find the universal axioms of all different legal systems and focused on the methods of legal reasoning to remove uncertainty and ambiguity from the positive law.<br>
<br>When he sent his offer of a digest of English law to James, Bacon told him that he esteemed his &#145;<i>Instauration</i>&#146; as his &#145;great work&#146; with which he still went on &#145;in silence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 14.358). Writing later in 1622 to Lancelot Andrewes he said he valued his &#145;<i>Instauration</i>&#146; most of all his work and explained how he was going to proceed. It was in this context that he put forward in 1623 a suit for the provostship of Eton.<br>
<br>The section of the &#145;Instauratio&#146; that Bacon most urgently tried to accomplish was the natural histories of the third part. In November 1622 he published a volume entitled <span class="italic">Historia naturalis et experimentalis ad condendam philosophiam; sive phaenomena universi</span>. It contained the first instalment of his natural history project&#151;a natural history of the winds, <span class="italic">Historia ventorum</span>&#151;and a plan for five others to be published on a monthly basis. In January 1623 the second part of the project, <span class="italic">Historia vitae et mortis</span> (&#145;History of life and death&#146;) appeared. A third natural history&#151;&#145;Historia densi et rari&#146;&#151;was well under way but other projects apparently intervened. Although the piece survives in two different versions Bacon never finished it.<br>
<br>Among the other projects was the translation into Latin of <span class="italic">The Advancement of Learning</span>, which was thereby going to take its place as the first part of the &#145;Instauratio&#146;. It came out under the title <span class="italic">De dignitate et augmentis scientiarum libri IX</span> in October 1623. Twice as long as the original English edition, the original book two had grown into eight books. Bacon sent copies of the volume to James, Prince Charles, and Buckingham, and to Cambridge and Oxford. To Prince Charles he mentioned that the book translated into Latin could be &#145;a citizen of the world, as English books are not&#146;. He also apologized that the history of Henry VIII had not progressed according to earlier promises  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 14.437).<br>
<br>Bacon also worked on the fourth and fifth divisions of the &#145;Instauratio&#146;, which were meant, respectively, to give examples of his method in action and provide some anticipatory results. The &#145;Abecedarium novum naturae&#146;, which was written in 1622, was originally to be included with the third part (the natural histories), but Bacon changed his mind. As it stands the &#145;Abecedarium&#146;, consisting mainly of a list of natural philosophical enquiries, was the introduction to the fourth part. At about the same time Bacon also wrote a short sketch for a study to be included in the fourth part entitled the &#145;Historia et inquisitio de animato et inanimato&#146;. Two short tracts, &#145;Inquisitio de magnete&#146; and &#145;Topica inquisitionis de luce et lumine&#146;, both dating from 1625, were similarly intended for the fourth part. A very short piece, which has been dated to the early 1620s, &#145;Prodromi sive anticipationes philosophia secundae&#146; was the intended preface to part five of the &#145;Instauratio&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1625 Bacon was also planning to finish the second part of the <span class="italic">Novum organum</span>, which, he said, he had already &#145;compassed and planned &hellip; out in my mind&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 14.531). By this stage he hoped that someone else would take on the work on natural history, claiming that his published histories were not pure histories, but rather pieces which properly belonged to part four of the &#145;Instauratio&#146;.<br>
<br>During his last years Bacon composed his utopia, the <span class="italic">New Atlantis</span>, and a natural historical work entitled <span class="italic">Sylva sylvarum</span>, meaning a collection of collections, a miscellany of subjects. It is a vast compilation of one thousand paragraphs consisting of extracts from many books and Bacon's own experiments and observations. The <span class="italic">New Atlantis</span> is a description of an island society and its scientific community: Salomon's House. In it Bacon developed ideas which he had outlined thirty years earlier in the early 1590s. The aim of the Salomon's House was nothing less than &#145;the knowledge of Causes, and secret motions of things; and the enlarging of the bounds of Human Empire, to the effecting of all things possible&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.156). The actual description of the scientific community's work owes something to two contemporary scientists and craftsmen, the Dutchman Cornelis Drebbel, and the Frenchman Salomon de Caus, who both spent time in Jacobean England. The <span class="italic">Sylva sylvarum</span> and the <span class="italic">New Atlantis</span> were posthumously published in the same volume in 1626.<br>
<br>No matter how highly Bacon valued his natural philosophical project he never abandoned hope of a political comeback. <span class="italic">The History of Henry VII</span> was partly intended to show Bacon's abilities as a counsellor. In 1622 he planned to ask the king to employ him again &#145;publicly upon the stage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 14.349) and composed his <span class="italic">&#145;Advertisement Touching an Holy Warre&#146;</span>, which alongside many contemporary eulogies for peace, and Anglo-Spanish grammars and dictionaries, testified to the rapprochement between Britain and Spain. Finally, in January 1623, &#145;the excellent Marquis brought&#146; him &#145;to kiss the King's hands&#146;, which made Bacon think that he was &#145;in the state of grace&#146;  (ibid., 14.402). There were rumours that he would again be placed in high office  (Jardine and Stewart, 490).<br>
<br>Prince Charles and Buckingham's hazardous trip to Madrid in 1623 inspired Bacon to wish he could participate fully in politics. Writing to Buckingham at Madrid in April, Bacon complained that &#145;I never felt my misfortunes so much as now&#146; because he could not advise the marquess. &#145;But when I look abroad&#146;, he continued:<blockquote>and see the times so stirring, and so much dissimulation, falsehood, baseness and envy in the world, and so many idle clocks going in men's heads; then it grieveth me much, that I am not sometimes at your Lordship's elbow, that I mought give you some of the fruits of the careful advice, modest liberty, and true information.</blockquote>He displayed no false modesty about his own political skill and experience. &#145;My good Lord&#146;, he went on, &#145;somewhat I have been, and much have I read; so that few things which concern states or greatness, are new cases unto me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 14.423&#150;4).<br>
<br>As soon as Charles and Buckingham had returned from Madrid Bacon suggested that they could use his pen to capitalize upon the hazardous but futile trip. Sending a copy of the <span class="italic">De augmentis</span> to the prince a fortnight after their return to England, Bacon announced that he was ready to &#145;do your Highness's journey any honour with my pen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 14.437). Bacon also worked hard to offer Buckingham detailed advice concerning parliament, and even planned to declare his readiness to travel to the continent to negotiate a league with France. In January 1624 he petitioned to receive leave to sit in the coming parliament.<br>
<br>The return of Charles and Buckingham prompted a dramatic change from a peaceful to a more belligerent foreign policy in which Bacon fully participated. Early in 1624 he wrote to Prince Charles the &#145;Considerations touching a war with Spain&#146; &#145;out of long-continued experience in business of estate, and much conversation in books of policy and history&#146;. In it he reiterated his views on civic greatness. Referring directly to his earlier writings on the subject Bacon now declared that those who thought Spain too mighty a state for Great Britain made the crucial error of stressing such external factors as money and territorial size as opposed to the intrinsic virtues of the populace.<br>
<br>In December 1624 Bacon published the <span class="italic">Apophthegms New and Old</span> and <span class="italic">The Translation of Certaine Psalmes into English Verse</span>. Only a few months later, in April 1625, he published the third edition of <span class="italic">The Essayes or Counsels, Civill and Morall</span>. It was his most popular work during his own day and has remained so since&#151;there were more than twenty editions in the seventeenth century. Bacon was aware of this, noting in 1622 that such writings as <span class="italic">The Essayes</span> would &#145;yield more lustre and reputation to my name&#146; than those in natural philosophy  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 14.374). Whereas the first edition had contained ten and the 1612 edition thirty-eight, the third had fifty-eight essays, and can be read as his final comments on the contemporary world of politics. As the title announced, <span class="italic">The Essayes</span> treated the questions of public life and morality. Earlier scholarship tended to see them as his account of civil knowledge or science. Of late, however, this conclusion has been questioned. Despite his pronounced confidence in his own ability to offer sound counsel Bacon seems to have later become less sanguine, if not wholly sceptical, about the possibility of political science. The final edition of <span class="italic">The Essayes</span>, while treating the moral and political topics listed in <span class="italic">The Advancement of Learning</span> as demanding fuller treatment, stresses the contingency and instability of political affairs, which hardly conform to the requirements of a demonstrative science. Indeed, by 1622 Bacon counted his <span class="italic">Essayes</span> &#145;but as recreation of my other studies&#146;  (ibid.), and in 1625 he noted that his writings on ethics and politics (including <span class="italic">The Essayes</span>, <span class="italic">The History of Henry VII</span>, and the <span class="italic">De sapientia veterum</span>) formed no part of his &#145;Instauration&#146;  (ibid., 14.531).<br>
<br>In December 1625 Bacon composed his last will, at the end of which he suddenly stated: &#145;Whatsoever I have given, granted, confirmed, or appointed to my wife, in the former part of this will, I do now, for just and great causes, utterly revoke and make void, and leave her to her right only&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 14.545). This decision is probably linked to the fact that Bacon's widow married his gentleman usher, John Underhill, less than a fortnight after Bacon's death. Bacon also intended to endow lectureships in Cambridge and Oxford &#145;for Natural Philosophy, and the sciences thereupon depending&#146;, but for want of funds this plan never materialized  (ibid., 14.546). In March 1626 he endeavoured by a private bill to confiscate and sell his &#145;lands, leases, and chattels&#146; for &#145;the payment of his debts&#146;  (Jardine and Stewart, 511).<br>
<br>Bacon died at Highgate on 9 April 1626. The only contemporary evidence of the circumstances is his last unfinished letter, which he obviously composed (without realizing it) on his deathbed. It was addressed to the earl of Arundel, in whose house Bacon had been forced to take refuge. In this letter, which has survived only in a printed version, he stated:<blockquote>I was likely to have had the fortune of Caius Plinius the elder, who lost his life by trying an experiment about the burning of the mountain Vesuvius. For I was also desirous to try an experiment or two, touching the conservation and induration of bodies. As for the experiment itself, it succeeded excellently well; but in the journey (between London and Highgate) I was taken with such a fit of casting, as I knew not whether it were the stone, or some surfeit, or cold, or indeed a touch of them all three. But when I came to your Lordship's house; I was not able to go back, and therefore was forced to take up my lodging here, where your house-keeper is very careful and diligent about me. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 14.550)</blockquote>According to the traditional story, in an unseasonably cold spring it had occurred to Bacon to test whether snow would preserve flesh from putrefaction, as salt does. In order to conduct the experiment, he obtained a hen and stuffed it with snow with his own hands, but also caught the chill from which he subsequently died in the earl of Arundel's house. Recently, however, it has been suggested that perhaps Bacon was using &#145;himself in some way as an experimental guinea-pig, in the hope of restoring his own failing health&#146;. Maybe he had &#145;been inhaling remedial substances in London, in an attempt to alleviate the symptoms of ill-health and, he hopes, help prolong his life&#146;. According to this conjecture &#145;Bacon died from an overdose of inhaled nitre or opiates&#146;  (Jardine and Stewart, 502&#150;8). He was buried at St Michael's Church, St Albans.<h2>
<a name="Statesmanandphilosopher"></a>Statesman and philosopher</h2>Throughout his life Bacon pursued both a political and a philosophical career. The relationship between these two pursuits has always been a central question in any biographical study of Bacon.<br>
<br>For a long time scholarship followed Bacon's own construction of his life and kept his two careers quite separate. His philosophical project was regarded as the more important and his quest for political power was often seen only as a means to promote his philosophical project. More recent commentators have put more emphasis on his political career and have argued that his natural philosophy and his political experience have something in common. This is most obvious in the centrality of the <i>vita activa</i> in both his political and natural philosophy. In his political career and thinking he always set a great store by the classical republican notion of the virtuous active citizen. Similarly he insisted that natural philosophy was not primarily contemplative <i>episteme</i> but rather a discovery of the unknown and part of the active life whose aim was &#145;the benefits and use of life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 4.21).<br>
<br>It has also been argued (by Leary) that Bacon's approach to natural philosophy was conditioned and shaped by his political experience and career. There appear to be a number of similarities between his legal method and his natural philosophical method. According to the strongest claim the creation of &#145;an imperial monarchy&#146; was Bacon's great project and his natural philosophy was merely &#145;a subordinate part of this programme&#146;  (Martin, 2&#150;4, 68, 134, 175). Nevertheless there is little, if any, evidence to support this last view. Bacon of course sought patronage but never promised any short-sighted economic or military gains in return. Though he frequently failed to win patronage he never yielded to the temptation to put his vision of natural philosophy in the service of purely political state power. If Bacon had conceived science as merely serving an imperial state then surely it would have made sense to say so when, at the pinnacle of his political career, he dedicated the <span class="italic">Instauratio magna</span> to the king. Yet, far from doing so, he apologized for the precious time a statesman had spent on a project lacking any political relevance. The only way Bacon defended writing a philosophical treatise was in purely philosophical terms.<br>
<br>Furthermore Bacon never perceived his philosophical project in nationalistic terms. <span class="italic">The Advancement of Learning</span> apart he published his natural philosophical writings in Latin because he aimed them at an international audience. He always insisted that a reformed natural philosophy would serve, and bring benefits to, the whole of humankind&#151;extend &#145;the power and dominion of the human race itself over the universe&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 4.114). Therefore, in conducting natural philosophical work national boundaries must be ignored. Bacon was convinced that learning would make tremendous strides &#145;if there were more intelligence mutual between the universities of Europe than now there is&#146;. Indeed, &#145;there may be many orders and foundations, which though they be divided under several sovereignties and territories, yet they take themselves to have a kind of contract, fraternity, and correspondence one with the other&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bacon</span>, ed. Vickers, 174).<br>
<br>In many respects Bacon's natural philosophical project stood in complete contrast with his theory of civic greatness (or &#145;imperial monarchy&#146;). The former was an international enterprise requiring concomitant peace. He argued that one of the reasons why his own times were so conducive to learning was &#145;the present disposition of these times at this instant to peace&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bacon</span>, ed. Vickers, 288). In striking contrast Bacon always insisted in his writings on civic greatness that the most important quality of a truly great state was &#145;the valour and military disposition of the people&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 7.48). He summarized his entire argument by emphasizing that &#145;no nation, which doth not directly professe Armes, may looke to have Greatnesse fall into their Mouths&#146;  (Bacon, <span class="italic">Essayes</span>, 95&#150;6). Whereas natural philosophy was an international enterprise, progressing only in peace, civic greatness was its diametrical opposite: it was a purely national undertaking demanding not only a warlike disposition but continuous wars.<br>
<br>This contrast is most glaring when Bacon's writings on civic greatness are compared with the <span class="italic">New Atlantis</span>, which some commentators have seen not merely as a representation of the ideal society of Bacon's natural philosophy but also as an embodiment of his &#145;vision of an imperial monarchy sustained by natural philosophy&#146;  (Martin, 135). The society of New Atlantis, dominated by its natural philosophical knowledge, was completely devoid of the chief ingredient of civic greatness&#151;war. Moreover the society of New Atlantis was organized as a self-contained unit which had as few contacts with other countries as possible&#151;indeed it was described as being of &#145;solitary situation&#146; &#145;divided by vast and unknown seas&#146; from the rest of the world  (<span class="italic">Bacon</span>, ed. Vickers, 463). Consequently strangers were rarely admitted to the island. This society, governed by both internal and external peace and tranquillity, was in marked contrast to the state which aimed at civic greatness, whose crucial quality was military spirit and warlike disposition, and which waged continuous wars to accomplish its desired end. Completely unlike New Atlantis a great state must be &#145;seated in no extreme angle, but commodiously in the midst of many regions&#146; or &#145;in the very heart of the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 7.63&#150;4). Even more it had to have a large population and it therefore needed to be liberal in granting naturalization. New Atlantis's exclusion of itself from the rest of the world into peaceful perpetual existence was hardly compatible with the state which searched for civic greatness by martial enterprises.<h2>
<a name="Baconscharacterandreputation"></a>Bacon's character and reputation</h2>Bacon's character and personality as well as his philosophical and political works have always provoked strongly contrasting interpretations. For many contemporaries Bacon was cold and arrogant, extravagant and pompous. In his letters John Chamberlain rarely had a good word for Bacon. He was especially critical of Bacon's ostentatious lifestyle and his indulgence in ceremonial. Similarly John Aubrey commented that when Bacon was at Gorhambury it seemed as if the court was there. The parliamentarian and diarist Simonds D'Ewes also depicted him in mostly negative terms. Commenting on Bacon's fall D'Ewes was convinced of his utter corruption, which was matched only by the prodigality that had eaten up his gains. Bacon could have been a good scholar and decent lawyer but, according to D'Ewes, he was immoderately ambitious and excessively proud, which necessitated his corrupt behaviour.<br>
<br>On top of these accusations D'Ewes also mentioned Bacon's &#145;most horrible and secret sin of sodomy&#146;  (Jardine and Stewart, 464). John Aubrey also noted that &#145;Bacon was a <i>paiderastos</i>&#146; and such a view was often repeated in contemporary satirical verses  (ibid.). A canon of St Paul's, embittered by Bacon's decision in a chancery case, is said by Chamberlain to have accused him of sodomy in a sermon in 1619, mentioning Bacon's &#145;Catamites&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 2.243). While there is no certainty about Bacon's sexual orientation or identity the likelihood that he may have been homosexual is undeniable.<br>
<br>The moral condemnations of Bacon have been repeated ever since the seventeenth century, but they were most vociferous during the nineteenth century when Lord Macaulay, above all, castigated Bacon's moral and professional character. Macaulay freely acknowledged Bacon's greatness as a philosopher but condemned outright his morality and his complete failure to maintain justice.<br>
<br>Nevertheless many of those contemporaries who knew Bacon more intimately depicted his personality and character in highly positive terms. William Rawley compiled and published a commemorative volume in Bacon's honour in 1626. The volume contained thirty-two Latin poems in his praise. These poems called Bacon &#145;the very nerve of genius&#146; and &#145;the greatest philosopher since the fall of Greece&#146;  (Mathews, 7). But those who thought highly of Bacon admired his moral and personal traits as well as his intellectual powers. Ben Jonson called Bacon:<blockquote>one of the greatest men and most worthy of admiration that hath been in many ages. In his adversity I ever prayed that God would give him strength &hellip; knowing no accident could do harm to virtue, but rather help to make it manifest. (ibid.)</blockquote>Similarly, Bacon's close friend Toby Matthew's praise, as he stated in his preface to the Italian edition of the <span class="italic">Essayes</span> in 1618, was &#145;not confined to the qualities of his intellect, but applies as well to those which are matters of the heart, the will and the moral virtue&#146;  (ibid., 13).<br>
<br>Two main strands can be distinguished in Bacon's impact on the Western philosophical tradition. First, his theory of scientific method in general, and induction in particular, was much commented on in subsequent epistemological debate. Second, and more important, Bacon's impact on Western philosophy is to be found in the ideological part of his philosophy&#151;the active ethos with which he infused modern science.<br>
<br>The continental philosophers of the seventeenth century saw in Bacon an eloquent critic of scholasticism, but it was in England that he had his greatest impact. On the one hand Bacon's conviction that the advancement of science was an effective means to assuage humankind's sufferings and improve its state found eager response in republican England during the mid-seventeenth century. But his followers also focused their attention on the institutional aspects of his philosophy. The full translation of these ideas into action, in the founding of the Royal Society after the Restoration of 1660, represents Bacon's deification as a philosopher and the final victory of the Baconian project of collaboration, utility, and progress. Another high point in Bacon's fortune occurred in the eighteenth century, when the French <i>philosophes</i> revered him as the most important propagandist of science (although they largely ignored the more technical parts of his philosophy). Bacon's methodological precepts received an enthusiastic response from the English epistemologists of the early nineteenth century, but a reaction soon followed, and by the latter part of the century Bacon was ridiculed as an ignorant <i>Wunderdoktor</i>, as Justus von Liebig put it in the most extreme formulation.<br>
<br>Such negative assessments have continued in two contrasting forms. For some present-day epistemologists Bacon was a spokesman for a hopelessly na&iuml;ve induction by enumeration, and had thus nothing to do with the development of modern science. In striking contrast the Frankfurt school criticized Bacon for being the very epitome of the modern scientific domination of nature and humankind.<br>
<br>Recent scholarship has, however, emphasized Bacon's central importance in early modern philosophy. His plan of scientific reform has been given a central place in historical accounts of the birth of the new science. Bacon declared that a new era in the history of humankind was at hand and that therefore traditional philosophy should be refuted. By replacing contemplative science, interested in words rather than works, with an active or operative science, humankind would have power to produce effects and thus to transform its conditions.<br>
