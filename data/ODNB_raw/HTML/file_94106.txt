<span class="headword">Pasley, Sir  (John) Malcolm Sabine</span>, fifth baronet  (1926&#150;2004), <span class="occ">German scholar and literary critic</span>, was born on 5 April 1926 at Rajkot, India, the younger child and only son of Sir Rodney Marshall Sabine Pasley, fourth baronet (1899&#150;1982), who taught history and cricket at Rajkumar College, and his wife, Aldyth Werge, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hamber (1898/9&#150;1983). The baronetcy, which Sir Malcolm inherited in 1982, had first been granted to his ancestor the naval officer Thomas Pasley in 1794. He was educated at Sherborne School and from 1944 served for two years in the Royal Navy, in which he saw action in the final year of the Second World War. He spent the post-war months in Germany. His one item of booty, a typewriter, served all his subsequent writing. Between 1946 and 1949 he studied modern languages at Trinity College, Oxford, and after graduating with a first-class degree held a Laming travelling fellowship at Queen's College, which took him to Munich for a year. He began research on German social novelists of the nineteenth century. In 1950 he was appointed a lecturer at Magdalen and Brasenose colleges, Oxford. In 1958 he was elected a fellow of Magdalen, where he taught for the next twenty-eight years. On 25 February 1965 he married Virginia Killigrew Wait, daughter of Peter Killigrew Wait; the couple had two sons, Robert (<i>b</i>. 1965) and Humphrey (<i>b</i>. 1967).<br>
<br>In 1960 a chance encounter gave Pasley's research a new and unexpected direction. The outcome turned work that would always have been intellectually distinguished into something unquestionably central, and directed his meticulous mind to the most basic literary issues. Through one of his pupils Pasley learned that the great-nephew of Franz Kafka, Michael Steiner, was studying at Oxford. Through Steiner he made contact with the writer's nieces, Marianne Steiner and Vera Saudkov&aacute;, and discovered that it was they&#151;and not, as assumed, Kafka's close friend Max Brod&#151;who were the legal owners of the bulk of Kafka's literary estate. At Pasley's suggestion they agreed to have the manuscripts in their ownership, then in Zurich, placed in Oxford's Bodleian Library on permanent revocable loan. In 1961, in a journey later to become legendary, he collected the papers, insured them for &pound;100,000, and transported them to Oxford on icy roads in his tiny Fiat car.<br>
<br>The Bodleian Library now became the centre of textual scholarship on Kafka and hence of the critical edition that had been planned from the mid-1960s, and was begun in the following decade by the Frankfurt publisher S. Fischer Verlag, to supersede Brod's editions of the texts. Pasley became the leading figure of a small team of editors and took responsibility for the most important texts, <span class="italic">The Castle</span> (published in 1982) and <span class="italic">The Trial</span> (1990). Where diplomacy was necessary among the team or between editors and publisher, he supplied it. Such qualities were clearly evident during Pasley's work on his edition of <span class="italic">The Trial</span>, the manuscript of which was held and claimed by Brod's legatee. Pasley was permitted sight of a photocopy, which was wholly inadequate for the kind of minute genetic reconstruction he was practising; through careful negotiations with Brod's partner, who had inherited the papers after Brod's death in 1968, he was allowed in 1987 and 1988 to work from the original &#145;in the ill-lit bowels of a Zurich bank, under the eye of its owner&#146;  (Pasley, &#145;Kafka's <i>Der Process</i>: what the manuscript can tell us&#146;, <span class="italic">Oxford German Studies</span>, 18&#150;19, 1989/90, 109). In 1986 he retired from his college teaching post to devote himself to editing. In addition to the two major novels, he edited a volume of writings and fragments from Kafka's <span class="italic">Nachlass</span> (1993), as well as producing new translations for Penguin of <span class="italic">The Great Wall of China and Other Stories</span> (1990) and <span class="italic">The Transformation and Other Stories</span> (1992), a two-volume edition of the Brod&#150;Kafka correspondence and travel diaries (1987&#150;9), and a collection of his own essays on Kafka, <span class="italic">Die Schrift ist unver&auml;nderlich</span> (&#145;The writing is unchangeable&#146;, 1995).<br>
<br>Pasley's edition became the basis for all later scholarly work on Kafka. At first sight, author and critic were strangely paired. It was paradoxical that &#145;this model English gentleman understood the mind of one of the most idiosyncratic and radical writers of the twentieth century better than anyone else in his time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 25 March 2004). He even came to think of Kafka as a younger brother. Pasley's contribution was widely recognized with, among other awards, election to the German Academy of Language and Literature in 1983 and the British Academy in 1991. On his final visit to Prague, Kafka's birthplace, after the &#145;velvet revolution&#146;, he was f&ecirc;ted by members of the Franz Kafka Society. In 1990 he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and while he continued to research, write, and publish, his illness led to a slow and painful decline. He died at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, on 4 March 2004 and was survived by his wife and two sons, the elder of whom, Robert, succeeded him as sixth baronet.<br>
