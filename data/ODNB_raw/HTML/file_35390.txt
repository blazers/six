<span class="headword">Parkinson, Sir  (Arthur Charles) Cosmo</span>  (1884&#150;1967), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born on 18 November 1884 at Wimborne Minster, Dorset, the only son and younger child of Sidney George Parkinson, a surgeon, and his wife, Elizabeth Trench. He went to Epsom College, which he left as head prefect, having won a number of prizes; he then went up to Magdalen College, Oxford, as a demy and obtained first-class honours in classical moderations (1905) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1907). In 1908 he entered the civil service and was posted to the Admiralty. The next year he transferred to the Colonial Office where his first assignment was as secretary to the tropical African entomological research committee, and later to a committee investigating the relationship between wild animals and trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). This experience gave him an interest in tropical medicine which lasted all his life.<br>
<br>In 1914 Parkinson was appointed assistant private secretary to the secretary of state, but in May 1915 he was released for military service and commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Inns of Court Officers' Training Corps. He served with the King's African rifles in east Africa from 1917, becoming deputy assistant adjutant-general and temporary major. He was appointed OBE in 1919.<br>
<br>On reverting to the Colonial Office in 1920 Parkinson was promoted principal in the east African department, but later that year he was appointed private secretary to the secretary of state. In 1924 he was moved to the dominions division of the Colonial Office and, when the two departments were separated in 1925, he was promoted assistant secretary in the Dominions Office. In 1928 he returned to the Colonial Office as head of the east African department; in 1929 he was awarded the brilliant star of Zanzibar, third class. His promotion to assistant under-secretary of state, supervising the Middle East, Cyprus, and Aden departments, and his CMG came in 1931. He was advanced to KCMG in 1935, and in 1937 was appointed permanent under-secretary of state, with a KCB in 1938.<br>
<br>Parkinson was cast in a scholar's mould, with a keen sense of history and pride in tradition. Himself a perfectionist he expected perfection in others. He was a bachelor and lived for the office. But a consequent concern, perhaps over-fastidious, with the niceties of procedure and style was combined with a wide-ranging ability and insistence on upholding Britain's obligations to the colonial peoples. This, together with his invariable personal kindness and humanity, held the admiration and affection of his colleagues. Nevertheless, with war approaching, ministers evidently felt that a more dynamic leadership was needed. A change had been planned for the autumn of 1939 but was deferred because of the outbreak of war until February 1940. Parkinson was then appointed permanent under-secretary of state for the Dominions Office and Sir George Gater took his place at the Colonial Office. The staff were frankly sceptical about the substitution of an officer from outside who, whatever his personal abilities, had little experience of central government and none of colonial affairs.<br>
<br>In May 1940 Gater was released on loan to the Ministry of Supply and Parkinson resumed, on an acting basis, the post to which he had been substantively appointed in 1937. It was therefore Parkinson who piloted the Colonial Office through the dark days of 1940&#150;42, covering the spread of the war to Africa and the loss of British Somaliland, and the loss of Hong Kong, Malaya, Singapore, and the Borneo Territories&#151;military defeats which, however, the contemporary press widely attributed to deficiencies in colonial administration. Parkinson's calmness and comradeship did much to sustain morale during this difficult period of blitz at home and losses abroad.<br>
<br>In 1942 Gater returned to the Colonial Office and Parkinson was seconded for special duties, being &#145;made available to visit colonies from time to time as opportunity offers, to discuss local problems with Governors as the Secretary of State's personal representative&#146;. There was admittedly a case for such an appointment, since personal contacts had perforce been disrupted by the war. But many people felt that others could have filled it equally well, and questioned the wisdom and equity of again displacing such a wise and experienced administrator.<br>
<br>Parkinson himself accepted his new duties with dignity and threw himself into them wholeheartedly. He visited the Caribbean and Bermuda in 1942&#150;3; the Gambia, Nigeria, Kenya, Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, Mauritius, Seychelles, Aden, and British Somaliland in 1943; and Ceylon and Gibraltar in 1944. He retired at the end of 1944, but was re-employed during 1945 as adviser on the post-war reorganization of the colonial service. In that capacity he visited Fiji and the other Pacific colonies. He had been promoted GCMG in 1942.<br>
<br>Parkinson remained active after his retirement, publishing <span class="italic">The Colonial Office from within</span> in 1947. He served on the Epsom College council from 1932 to 1965, being chairman of the executive committee from 1947 to 1961. He was a member of the governing body of University College Hospital, Birkbeck College, and the Old Vic; and as a crown trustee of the City Parochial Foundation from 1951 never missed a meeting until failing eyesight compelled him to resign in 1966. From 1948 to 1966 he served on the delegacy of King's College, London, being a member of the finance committee from 1950 to 1963. From 1956 to 1964 he chaired the court of governors of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. He received an honorary LLD from St Andrews.<br>
<br>After his retirement Parkinson moved to Bournemouth to be near his sister. Although he became totally blind in one eye his mind and memory remained fresh to the last. He died suddenly and peacefully in Bournemouth on 16 August 1967. According to an obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, although &#145;one of the most efficient of civil servants, he never lost sight of the fact that public affairs were concerned with human beings&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 17 Aug 1967).<br>
