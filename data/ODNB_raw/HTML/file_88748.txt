<span class="headword">May,  Alan Nunn</span>  (1911&#150;2003), <span class="occ">physicist and spy</span>, was born on 2 May 1911 at Bedruthan, Park Hill, Moseley, Birmingham, the youngest of four children (one girl and three boys) of Walter Frederick Nunn May, brassfounder, and his wife, Mary Annie (Minnie), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kendall. He was educated at King Edward VI School, Birmingham, and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, to both of which he won scholarships, graduating from Cambridge in 1933 with a first in physics and going on to take a PhD under Charles Drummond Ellis. In 1936 he left Cambridge to take up a lecturing post at King's College, London, where Ellis had become professor.<br>
<br>At King's, May pursued research into the development of electronic counters to measure sub-atomic activity and as the Second World War approached was drawn into secret work on radar. In October 1939, however, his department was evacuated to Bristol and the link with radar was broken. Instead he was soon recruited to help with early studies of the feasibility of an atomic bomb, and in early 1942 he was seconded back to Cambridge to work on nuclear reactor development as part of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93791', "Tube Alloys directorate")</script>.<br>
<br>It was at this point, by his subsequent account, that May's opinion was sought on a classified American report suggesting that Germany might have the ability to explode a weapon that would spread radioactive material over a large area&#151;a &#145;dirty bomb&#146;. May privately took the view that the country most threatened by this possibility was the Soviet Union, and decided to pass the information to a Soviet secret service contact. By 1942 he had been a communist for some years. His left-wing leanings may have stretched back to his youth, when his father's business collapsed during the depression, leaving the family struggling to get by. As a student in Cambridge he had been in close touch with left-wing people&#151;his tutor was Patrick Blackett, a socialist and pro-Soviet enthusiast, while Donald Maclean was a friend&#151;and he became a Communist Party member (though he had allowed this to lapse by 1940) and a prominent activist in the left-wing Association of Scientific Workers.<br>
<br>In January 1943 the Cambridge reactor research team, May included, was transferred to Montreal and given the task of designing a heavy water reactor to be built at Chalk River, Ontario. The American Manhattan project was by then established, and it shared substantial amounts of information with the Canadian-based group. In a statement about his espionage dictated three weeks before his death May said that before he travelled to Canada his Soviet secret service contact had asked him to resume his spying once there. This he did not do. At the beginning of 1945, however, the Soviet Union was urgently seeking information about atomic research and a Lieutenant Angelov of the Soviet military intelligence agency, GRU, appeared at May's flat in Montreal demanding that he help. May later insisted that he was reluctant and there is evidence confirming this. He was persuaded none the less and within a fortnight gave Angelov two lengthy reports, one on the technical details of atomic weapons research as he knew them, and one on the structure of the Manhattan project.<br>
<br>May was well informed, having paid several visits to the Argonne National Laboratory in Chicago, the seat of American reactor research. Over the remainder of 1945 he saw Angelov several times and, as he wrote later, &#145;I provided all the information I could&#146;  (Alan Nunn May's last statement). This included microscopic samples of the uranium isotopes U233 and U235, and much more.<blockquote>Because I had access to the entire library of research documents on nuclear power (a great deal of which was provided by the USA), I was able to borrow these documents from the library and hand them over to the agent who would take them to Ottawa, photocopy them, transmit them to Russia and return them to me. (ibid.)</blockquote>According to the Canadian royal commission that subsequently reported on these matters, he was paid at least $700 (Canadian) for his assistance, and two bottles of whisky. By his own account he accepted some money under protest but promptly burned it.<br>
<br>In September 1945 May's job with the Canadian project came to an end and he returned to his lecturing post in London. Angelov gave him detailed instructions for a rendezvous with a London-based GRU agent at a location next to the British Museum. By now, however, the sequence of events leading to his arrest had begun. Igor Gouzenko, a cipher clerk who handled GRU material at the Soviet embassy in Ottawa, had defected, bringing with him copies of many GRU documents, including some incriminating May. MI5 were informed but they delayed May's arrest; they too now had the British Museum rendezvous details and hoped May would lead them to other spies. At a higher level, government ministers wanted to defer the inevitable souring of relations with Moscow that would result. In the event May did not attend the rendezvous, because, he said later, he had been tipped off.<br>
<br>May was eventually arrested at King's College on the Strand in London on 4 March 1946. He made a partial confession, acknowledging the truth of the information already known to the British authorities and nothing more. He refused to name anyone else involved in espionage. His statement ended with the words: &#145;The whole affair was extremely painful to me and I only embarked on it because I felt this was a contribution I could make to the safety of mankind. I certainly did not do it for gain&#146;  (Moorehead, 39). At May's trial at the Old Bailey on 1 May 1946 Sir Hartley Shawcross, prosecuting, dwelt on the breach of trust and the exchange of money, and described the case as squalid. The defence responded that May had merely helped a wartime ally and had obeyed the dictates of conscience. He was found guilty and Mr Justice Oliver, after passing a sentence of ten years' gaol, denounced May for conceit, wickedness, and degradation. Though friends on the left and in the scientific community thought the sentence harsh, and Harold Laski led a fruitless delegation of protest to see the home secretary, Chuter Ede, May did not appeal and served six and a half years in prison.<br>
<br>After his release from prison May returned to Cambridge and on 1 August 1953 married Hildegard Pauline Ruth (Hilde) Broda, an Austrian-born divorcee (daughter of Ludwig Girwing, army officer) who was deputy medical officer of health for the city. She already had a son, and they had a son together. Finding himself barred from university employment, May took a job at a scientific instruments company; his family said later that the post was covertly subsidized by the government, perhaps to counter any temptation he may have felt to emigrate to the Soviet Union. In 1961, on the recommendation of J. D. Bernal, a former Cambridge colleague, he was appointed to a research post in physics at the University of Ghana. He remained there for seventeen years, becoming in turn professor, dean, and finally a government adviser on science education. In 1978 he returned once again with his wife to Cambridge, to live out a quiet retirement. Until the statement he dictated to his stepgranddaughter Alice Evelegh on 23 December 2002 was made public immediately after his death he offered no public comment about his spying activities, and that statement made clear that he had no regrets. He died at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on 12 January 2003, of pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was survived by his wife, Hilde, his son, and his stepson.<br>
<br>Measuring the importance of May's espionage is difficult, not least because the Soviet Union had many other spies&#151;perhaps dozens&#151;providing it with information about atomic developments in the USA and Britain in the 1940s. (At least one, the British-Italian Bruno Pontecorvo, who defected to the Soviet Union in 1950, was a wartime colleague of May's in Canada, also working on the Deep River project.) Probably because the case was embarrassing to the government, the official British line at the time appears to have been to play down his importance. Certainly May was not at the heart of the Manhattan project, as were such other spies as Klaus Fuchs and Theodore Alvin Hall, so he could have told the GRU very little about weapon design. The reactor knowledge he was able to pass on, however, is likely to have been of considerable use to Soviet reactor scientists.<br>
<br>Whatever the quality of his information, May played an important role in the origins of the cold war. His unmasking caused shock in official circles in London and Washington, and among the public, since this was the first overt proof that the Soviet Union had engaged in espionage against its wartime allies, and had gained access to atomic secrets by doing so. The case left little doubt that a nuclear arms race was underway and was one of the many factors in that period which helped establish the Soviet Union in the public mind as the new enemy of the West. In Washington, moreover, there was outrage that a man who had done little to conceal his communist activities before the war should have been cleared by MI5 to work at Montreal and to have access to a Manhattan project laboratory. This feeling helped create the climate for the American <span class="roman">McMahon Act</span> of 1946, which had the effect of terminating the wartime British-American nuclear weapons partnership, and thus of forcing Britain to create its own independent deterrent.<br>
