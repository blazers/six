<span class="headword">Arnold,  Samuel James</span>  (1774&#150;1852), <span class="occ">playwright and theatre manager</span>, was born at Rathbone Place, London, on 5 December 1774, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/682/', "Samuel Arnold (1740&#150;1802)")</script>, composer, and his wife, Mary Ann Napier. After attending King's School, Canterbury, from 1782 to 1785 Arnold was trained as an artist. In his early career he concentrated on portraits, but became more widely recognized as a painter of panoramas. He showed a series of pictures at the Royal Academy between 1800 and 1808.<br>
<br>Arnold's main love, however, was theatre. In 1794 he produced <span class="italic">Auld Robin Gray</span>, a musical play in two acts, and in 1795 <span class="italic">Who Pays the Reckoning?</span>, which was condemned by critics and not published. Both works were performed at the Haymarket, whose musical pieces for the past thirty years had been written and arranged by Arnold's father. His first piece for Drury Lane, the <span class="italic">Shipwreck</span> (1796), was written in collaboration with his father, who in fact wrote the music for most of his works. That year, too, Arnold published his only novel, <span class="italic">The Creole, or, Haunted Island</span>.<br>
<br>In 1803 Arnold married Matilda Catherine Pye (<i>d</i>. 1851), a daughter of the poet laureate <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22918/', "Henry James Pye")</script>. Among their children was barrister and literary translator <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/688/', "Thomas James Arnold")</script>. Arnold collaborated with his father-in-law to write <span class="italic">A Prior Claim</span> (Drury Lane, 1805). His <span class="italic">Man and Wife, or, More Secrets than One</span>, a comedy (Drury Lane, 1809), lasted for thirty shows.<br>
<br>That year, Arnold obtained a licence to change the Lyceum in the Strand into an English opera house: the building had been used previously for subscription concerts, shows, and exhibitions. Drury Lane Theatre burned down at about that time, and the company moved to the new English Opera House for three seasons. Shortly afterwards, Arnold was invited to become joint manager with J. G. Raymond of the new Drury Lane Theatre, which was opened with great ceremony on 10 October 1812. His management was troubled by internal arguments. He himself was strongly criticized for having his own works performed, and he resigned after the founder, S. Whitbread, committed suicide in 1815. By 1818, the company was ruined. Arnold moved back to the English Opera House, and had it entirely rebuilt and enlarged by Samuel Beazley, at a cost of &pound;80,000. It reopened on 15 June 1816. In 1824 Arnold was the first in England to stage Weber's <span class="italic">Der Freisch&uuml;tz</span>, and he went on to give a number of other foreign works their first English showing. However, in 1830, that theatre, too, burned down.<br>
<br>Arnold never recovered from the blow, although the theatre was rebuilt by the same architect, to reopen on 14 July 1834 as the Lyceum. However, it ran at a loss. It was decided to make it a commonwealth, but it lasted only one acrimonious season under this arrangement. The shareholders having lost a lot of money, it became a normal theatre.<br>
<br>Arnold was a magistrate and a fellow of the Royal Society, although his name does not appear in the society's <span class="italic">Record</span>. He died at Walton upon Thames on 16 August 1852.<br>
