</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Enright,  Dennis Joseph</span>  (1920&#150;2002), <span class="occ">poet and literary critic</span>, was born on 11 March 1920 at 20 Camberwell Terrace, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, the elder child and only son of George Roderick Enright, postman, and his wife, Grace, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cleaver. George Enright was from Ireland and a &#145;lapsed Catholic&#146;. He had fought on the Somme and at Gallipoli. Grace was Welsh, and a Wesleyan Methodist. Much of Dennis Enright's childhood and youth can be glimpsed in his sequence of poems, <span class="italic">The Terrible Shears: Scenes from a Twenties Childhood</span> (1974), in which he ruefully and entertainingly captured moments in a poor Anglo-Irish family in genteel Leamington.<br>
<br>Enright was a scholarship boy, who won a place first to Leamington College and then to Downing College, Cambridge, where he was a pupil of F. R. Leavis. He contributed to Leavis's journal, <span class="italic">Scrutiny</span>, while still an undergraduate: essays on and reviews of German literature as well as English. He graduated BA in 1944. As a conscientious objector during the Second World War, he was directed to work on the land, including driving farm lorries.<br>
<br>When peace came, frustrated in finding any post in a British university (he partly blamed his Leavisite attachments), Enright began his teaching career at the Farouk I University in Alexandria in 1947. He later used much material from his period in Egypt in the first (and best) of his four novels, <span class="italic">Academic Year</span> (1955). He also published in Alexandria, in 1948, his first slim volume of poems, <span class="italic">Season Ticket</span>, brought out by a local press. It attracted the attention of such critical notables of the period as Alan Pryce-Jones and Raymond Mortimer.<br>
<br>Enright had in February 1946, in Warwick, married the twenty-year-old Daisy Emily Chainey, but in Egypt she soon &#145;attached herself&#146; (as one of the characters in <span class="italic">Academic Year</span> says about his own spouse) to an older, more sophisticated colleague of Enright's at the university, the Welsh scholar and translator Gwyn Williams, whom she married in 1949. Enright was left desolate by this, and seldom referred to the marriage. To ensure speedy and amicable divorce proceedings, he allowed himself to be seen as the guilty party. He had already met Madeleine Harders, widow of the French poet and novelist Marius Grout (winner of the 1943 prix Goncourt). She was teaching at the Lyc&eacute;e Fran&ccedil;aise in Alexandria. They married in 1949. This was a long, close, and happy marriage. There was one child, their daughter Dominique.<br>
<br>Enright wrote much poetry in Egypt, and also published his first prose book, <span class="italic">A Commentary on Goethe's Faust</span> (1949), brought out in the USA by New Directions. This was based to some extent on work which had appeared first in <span class="italic">Scrutiny</span>. It was also a by-product of the DLitt which, rather curiously, he took at the university in Alexandria: a thesis on three German poets (H&ouml;lderlin, Rilke, and Stefan George), written in English, which he had to defend in French in front of a panel of Egyptian professors.<br>
<br>The post-war Egypt in which the young Enright had arrived was no longer the curiously bohemian place of temporary intellectual exile conjured up by such names as Robert Liddell, Bernard Spencer, Terence Tiller, P. H. Newby, and Robin Fedden (all of whom taught in Egyptian universities in 1940&#150;45), or Keith Douglas, Lawrence Durrell, G. S. Fraser, and Olivia Manning (not university-based but associated, even if only on wartime leave). These were the last years of Farouk's corrupt and decadent regime. It was a country on the edge of extreme and violent change. In <span class="italic">Academic Year</span>, and in some of his poems of the time, Enright reflected its mixture of anarchy and repression, nihilism and nerves, riots and rumours of riots and of <i>coups d'&eacute;tat</i>, as well as the more customary student strikes. But his sardonic temperament also responded with delight to innumerable causes of amusement: the duplicating machine for the printing of examination papers installed in the lavatory, the stunningly unmarkable answers written during the feverish exam rituals (&#145;Dickens' father was not successful in his marriage and he had ten children&#146;), the varieties of Arab student English&#151;beseeching, charming, ingratiating, insolent: &#145;We all honour you, sir, you are our teacher. But we cannot work today&#151;it is Down with Britain day, if you will excuse it, sir.&#146;<br>
<br>In 1950 Enright returned with his wife Madeleine to Britain, where he was appointed an organizing tutor in the extramural department of the University of Birmingham, based in the Black Country, not far from the town of his upbringing, and involved in much peripatetic teaching. At a time of post-war austerity, it was not a particularly happy period for the Enrights; but it was in these years that he began to establish himself in Britain as a poet and critic of excellence and distinct views, in such periodicals as <span class="italic">The Listener</span> (encouraged by J. R. Ackerley), the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> (for Raymond Mortimer and Janet Adam Smith), <span class="italic">Essays in Criticism</span> (for F. W. Bateson), and the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> (for Alan Pryce-Jones). Though not a Catholic, he contributed reviews for a time to the Catholic journal <span class="italic">The Month</span>, and it was in its November 1951 issue that he had the distinction of being the sole reviewer of (and full of praise for) Philip Larkin's little self-published pamphlet <span class="italic">XX Poems</span>. These were perhaps among the earliest murmurs of what became known, a few years later, as the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93790', "Movement")</script>. In <span class="italic">New Poems 1952</span> (the first of the PEN anthologies), Enright published three poems alongside ones by his later fellow-Movementeers Kingsley Amis and Robert Conquest.<br>
<br>Enright's next geographical move was more extreme and more crucial. In 1953 he took up a post as visiting professor at a rich private university in Japan, Konan University, near Kobe, in the Kansai (or midlands) of that country. This experience (1953&#150;6) produced some of his best earlier poems, including such widely anthologized pieces as &#145;The Short Life of Kazuo Yamamoto&#146; and &#145;The Noodle-Vendor's Flute&#146;. He also produced one of the liveliest post-war prose books on aspects of modern Japan, <span class="italic">The World of Dew</span> (1955), with its characteristic dedication &#145;To the union of goodwill to commonsense&#146;. He had, almost proleptically, published his first full-scale volume of poems, <span class="italic">The Laughing Hyena</span>, in 1953, just before he arrived in Japan: the &#145;hyena&#146; was a <i>hanya</i>, or Japanese devil-figure, depicted by Hokusai. The contradictions and ironies of Japan made good material. The Japan Enright got to know was a country still devastated by the war, poverty-stricken, several years before the &#145;economic miracle&#146; of the 1960s and later; and the poet recognized what he saw all round him, and made use of what he saw. Apart from <span class="italic">The World of Dew</span>, the best emblem of Enright's Japanese years is his book of poems, <span class="italic">Bread Rather than Blossoms</span> (1956)&#151;the title being a version of the Japanese proverb &#145;hana yori dango&#146; (&#145;dumplings before flowers&#146;).<br>
<br>One of the most influential moves made by Enright during his years in Japan was his editing (for the company Kenkyusha, in Tokyo&#151;a well-established publisher of books concerned with English studies) of the anthology <span class="italic">Poets of the 1950s</span>. This appeared in early January 1956&#151;a few months before Robert Conquest's <span class="italic">New Lines</span>&#151;and it included all the poets in Conquest's book with the exception of Thom Gunn (whose work Enright had not then read). It became one of the sacred texts of literary history, or at least of the literary history of the Movement.<br>
<br>On leaving Japan, Enright took up a brief and not very happy appointment at the Free University, Berlin, in 1956&#150;7. There followed a rather happier period in Thailand, where he was British Council professor of English at Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, from 1957 to 1959. Even here, though, there were unwelcome incidents, such as his brief incarceration in prison after an altercation with several policemen who had parked in the narrow road leading to the Enrights' front gate while they visited a brothel. An officer, spouting much abuse, kicked Enright; Madeleine struck the officer, all degenerated into a brawl, and Enright was marched off. The whole incident was later described with characteristic lugubrious wit in <span class="italic">Memoirs of a Mendicant Professor</span> (1969). Enright also transgressed by taking up opium-smoking for a time in Thailand: the British Council representative and some senior members of the British embassy staff disapproved. Some of his published poems, too, were felt to be an embarrassment, such as one which<blockquote>referred to the recent shooting of several malefactors against the wall of the National Library &hellip; the poem respectfully opined that it was culturally deleterious to shoot people against the walls of libraries, and pointed out that in Europe we did this sort of thing more discreetly in cellars, etc. (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 97)</blockquote>Though his engagement in Bangkok was prematurely terminated because of these &#145;difficulties&#146;, the British Council in London loyally tided Enright over until something else turned up. Indeed, he wrote with characteristic tongue-in-cheek irony of the council's offices in Davies Street, London:<blockquote>A blessing on its head! Cringing one's way out of one office, a broken man, an exposed pornographer, whoremonger, dipsomaniac, and opium addict, one's painter torn to ribbons, one would enter another office to find oneself a hero of labour, an expert, a distinguished academic, besought on almost bended knees to be gracious enough to fly first class to India and spread one's sweetness and light. (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 113)</blockquote>What in fact turned up was the Johore professorship of English at the University of Singapore, a post Enright held from 1960 until 1970&#151;his longest academic appointment, and his last abroad. This appointment got off to a lively and controversial start with his inaugural lecture. This was uncontroversially entitled &#145;Robert Graves and the decline of modernism&#146;, but it was its preliminary comments, on the cultural policies of the newly elected Singapore government, that made headline news, provoking a strong government reaction. The lecture urged Singapore and Malaya to remain culturally open, not devoted to &#145;a sarong-culture, complete with pantun competitions and so forth&#146;. The acting minister of law and labour summoned Enright to his office, and in a later letter referred to him as a &#145;mendicant professor&#146;&#151;an epithet which Enright turned to his own advantage in his later <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>. What followed (&#145;The faint odium, the odour of official disfavour attaching to the Professor of English&#146;, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 146), a sort of symbolic status, continued for a long time. Nevertheless, Enright went on functioning effectively and genially in the university, in which he came to employ the young novelist Paul Theroux, who later wrote of him: &#145;Most people I meet tell me what an absolute sweetheart Dennis Enright is, yet he has always struck me as being rather tough, and capable of being fierce, as shy people often are&#146; (Theroux, in Simms, <span class="italic">Life by Other Means</span>, 29).<br>
<br>By 1970 Enright was tired of the Singapore government's tightening hold on the university, and perhaps tired of over twenty years of teaching abroad. A little earlier he had brooded that &#145;It's probably too late to go back &hellip; Already one finds whole tracts of such journals as the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> and the <span class="italic">Spectator</span> largely incomprehensible&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 190). But an invitation to become co-editor of the monthly journal <span class="italic">Encounter</span> (to be responsible for the literary and &#145;cultural&#146; material), together with the offer of a temporary lectureship in English at the University of Leeds, persuaded him to return to England in 1970. For the first time since his youth Enright settled down, finding a comfortable though cramped flat with Madeleine in a quiet part of Putney. His work for <span class="italic">Encounter</span> was conscientious and energetic, but it was not full-time, nor was he paid a full-time salary. It was then, in the early 1970s, that Enright accelerated his considerable output of critical work, not only reviews and critical essays but the editing of a number of books, including several anthologies, such as the <span class="italic">Oxford Book of Death</span> (1983) and the <span class="italic">Faber Book of Fevers and Frets</span> (1989), and such <i>causeries</i> as <span class="italic">Fair of Speech: the Uses of Euphemism</span> (1985) and <span class="italic">The Alluring Problem: an Essay on Irony</span> (1986). When he was approached by the publisher Chatto and Windus to join the firm as an editorial director, he gave up his <span class="italic">Encounter</span> post and began work there (under the formidable Norah Smallwood) in 1974. At Chatto and Windus he was responsible for a broad range of titles, including the poetry list (which had been started by C. Day Lewis); but he was probably most proud of overseeing the enormous revision by Terence and Joanna Kilmartin of Proust's <span class="italic">&Agrave; la recherche du temps perdu</span> (1981), the first full overhaul of this masterpiece since the Scott Moncrieff version.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Enright was as prolific a poet as ever. One of his most highly praised books was <span class="italic">The Terrible Shears</span> (1974), a sequence about his childhood; two other sequences drew drily and wittily on great works of art, <span class="italic">Paradise Illustrated</span> (1978) and <span class="italic">A Faust Book</span> (1979). A first volume of <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> appeared in 1981, to be augmented several times before his death. He was awarded the queen's medal for poetry the same year.<br>
<br>Enright resigned from publishing in 1982, and was a hard-working freelance for the rest of his life. Three late books were the &#145;commonplace&#146; collections he put together&#151;thoughts prompted by his reading, sudden <i>pens&eacute;es</i>, droll observations on words, attitudes, people, experiences: <span class="italic">Interplay</span> (1995), <span class="italic">Play Resumed</span> (1999), and <span class="italic">Injury Time</span> (2003). He was appointed OBE in 1991. The year before that, in 1990, a Festschrift, <span class="italic">Life by Other Means</span>, edited by his long-time editor at Oxford University Press, Jacqueline Simms, was published to mark his seventieth birthday. This contained reminiscent and critical pieces by twenty-one poets, novelists, critics, and former colleagues, including A. S. Byatt, Donald Davie, Douglas Dunn, P. N. Furbank, Blake Morrison, Peter Porter, and Paul Theroux. Together they said many illuminating and amusing things about their subject and his work. He was made a companion of literature by the Royal Society of Literature in 1998.<br>
<br>Enright was an amusing companion, his expressive face and <i>sotto voce</i> comments lightening many a literary event. His long, droll features and crinkly hair were the attributes of a comedian, and indeed he reported of himself that in foreign parts he had sometimes been taken for Danny Kaye, and sometimes for Harpo Marx&#151;confusions which he occasionally allowed to go unresolved. His later years were dogged with physical ills (kidney and bladder problems, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer which began on a kidney), but these he typically put to use in &#145;hospital poems&#146; and wry jottings in his commonplace books. He once called himself a &#145;disillusioned liberal&#146;, but then decided the word was not quite accurate: &#145;&#147;Chastened&#148; let us rather say. What you have not deified cannot fail you so utterly. As for &#147;liberal&#148;, I don't think it will ever come to seem a dirty word to me&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 1 Jan 2003). He died on 31 December 2002 at Trinity Hospice, Clapham, London, of cancer of the bladder. He was survived by his wife, Madeleine, and their daughter, Dominique, a publisher.<br>
