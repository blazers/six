<span class="headword">Agilbert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 679<span class="mult">x</span>90), <span class="occ">bishop of the West Saxons</span>, was from a leading Frankish family, certainly connected with the family of St Audoin (St Ouen), who died in 684, and probably with the royal Merovingian family itself. He was the second bishop of the West Saxons and, later, bishop of Paris. According to Bede  (<span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 3.7), some time after Cenwalh had been restored as leader of the West Saxons in 646, Agilbert arrived in his kingdom. He was a &#145;Gaul&#146; or Frank, who was already a bishop when he arrived, having been ordained in Francia, presumably without a see. Before his arrival in England he had been studying in Ireland. Cenwalh invited Agilbert to stay among the West Saxons as their bishop, in the see established by Birinus at Dorchester-on-Thames. This position Agilbert held &#145;for some years&#146; until Cenwalh tired of his &#145;barbarous speech&#146;, which presumably means that the bishop never properly mastered the language of his hosts. The West Saxon kingdom was then divided into two sees, one being given to Bishop Wine. Agilbert, it is said, was deeply offended and left the kingdom. He then seems to have headed north to the court of the Northumbrian kings Oswiu and Aldfrith, for the life of St Wilfrid states that Agilbert ordained Wilfrid priest at Ripon at the king's command; this happened in 663 or 664. In 664 Agilbert appeared alongside Wilfrid and with his priest Agatho at the famous Synod of Whitby, where he championed the Romanist cause. It was, however, Wilfrid who spoke &#145;in his own tongue&#146; for their side in the dispute, which again hints at Agilbert's poor command of English. Shortly after the synod, Agilbert was back in Francia where, along with eleven other bishops, he took part in Wilfrid's consecration as bishop at Compi&egrave;gne; this also took place in 664. Although Bede refers to Agilbert in this context as bishop of Paris, he cannot have been appointed to that city until 666 or 667, for there is a charter of that date attested by Importunus, his predecessor as bishop there. Agilbert must have become bishop by 668, however, since in that year he entertained Theodore in Paris as the latter made his way from Rome to Canterbury to take up the archbishopric.<br>
<br>Agilbert's fortunes in England seem to have been governed by the tide of Mercian expansion, rather than to have been the result of his inability to speak English properly. He left southern England around the time the Mercians acquired control of the area to the south of the Thames valley, but at a later point (<i>c</i>.670), when Mercian influence in Wessex was on the wane, Cenwalh invited him back to become bishop of Winchester. Now bishop of Paris, Agilbert declined the offer and sent his nephew Leuthere in his place. He died some time between 679 and 690, and he was buried in the crypt which he had built at the double monastery of Jouarre, east of Paris, over which his sister Theodechild had presided as abbess.<br>
<br>Agilbert's career serves to emphasize the strong links between the Frankish and the English ruling &eacute;lites in the mid-seventh century. His very name was the Frankish form of &AElig;thelberht, which may suggest that he had some family relationship with the Kentish royal house, and it was at this time, according to Bede  (<span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 3.8), that Earcongota (daughter of Eanbald, king of Kent) and several other Anglo-Saxon princesses joined Frankish monasteries, perhaps through the agency of Agilbert. At the same time that the bishop first appeared in England, the all-powerful mayor of the palace in northern Francia was Erchinoald. The mayor had acquired the Anglo-Saxon Balthild, whom, about 648, he provided as a wife for the Frankish king, Clovis II. On the latter's death in 657, Balthild emerged as a powerful dowager queen. Interestingly, Agilbert's departure from Francia to Ireland was probably at the time that Balthild first became queen, and his return to his homeland coincided with her fall from power in 663 or 664. Once back in Francia, Agilbert was clearly a supporter of Erchinoald's successor as mayor, the notorious Ebroin, whose most influential ally was Audoin, with whom Agilbert was also linked. It was no doubt at Ebroin's behest that Agilbert entertained Theodore in 668, for Bede tells of how the mayor monitored the archbishop's every move through Francia. The last that is heard of Agilbert is on another (and this time plainly disreputable) mission for Ebroin, some time between 676 and 679. It is therefore reasonable to speculate that Agilbert's stay in England was as an exile in retreat from the ruling faction of Erchinoald and, later, of Balthild&#151;an exile which came to an end when Ebroin and Audoin got the upper hand in Francia. His sojourn in Ireland may likewise have had a dimension in Frankish politics, for it may have been he who prepared the way for the exile of the young king, Dagobert II, who was sent there some time between 651 and 657. Agilbert may also have played a part in Dagobert's return from Ireland in 676, which was arranged through the bishop's old friend, Wilfrid. His career in Ireland, England, and upon the continent invites speculation at every turn, but the overall impression is clear enough: Agilbert was a figure of international importance through whom Frankish influence on the development of the church in southern England was maintained.<br>
