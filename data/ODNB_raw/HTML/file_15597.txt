<span class="headword">King,  Robert</span>, second earl of Kingston  (1754&#150;1799), <span class="occ">accused murderer and property developer</span>, was the eldest son of Edward King, first earl of Kingston (1726&#150;1797), then MP for Boyle and later for co. Sligo, and his wife, Jane (1737&#150;1784), illegitimate daughter of Thomas Caulfeild of Donamon, co. Roscommon, and Peggy Jordan. His younger sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/96107/', "Lady Isabella King")</script>, later achieved note as a philanthropist in Bath and Bristol. After schooling at Eton College, King assumed the title Viscount Kingsborough in 1768. On 5 December of the following year at St Michael's, Dublin, he married his cousin, Caroline (1755&#150;1823), only daughter of Richard FitzGerald of Mount Ophaly in co. Kildare and Margaret King, heir to the estate of Mitchelstown, co. Cork, from her father, the fourth and last Baron Kingston.<br>
<br>The couple's first child, George, was born in 1771, by which time Kingsborough was in London on the first stage of a European tour which took him to Paris before his return to Mitchelstown in 1776. Lord and Lady Kingsborough had a further five sons and five daughters, who were brought up alongside one Henry Gerald FitzGerald, the illegitimate son of Caroline's brother. FitzGerald appears to have been a dashing and spirited young man who rose to the rank of colonel in the army. Though married, in 1797 he eloped with the Kingsboroughs' third daughter, Mary Elizabeth, who was soon after reunited with the family following the viscount's offer of a reward of 100 guineas for information.<br>
<br>This, however, was not sufficient for Kingsborough's son Colonel Robert Edward King, who challenged FitzGerald to a duel in Hyde Park, London, on 1 October 1797. Plans for a rematch after an inconclusive first exchange were prevented when both men were arrested on the instruction of George III  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 67, 1797, 1120&#150;21). Now disguised, FitzGerald returned to Kilworth, near Mitchelstown, to where Mary had been taken. His presence came to the attention of Robert Edward King and his father, who, following the first earl of Kingston's death (8 November 1797), had assumed the earldom. Father and son confronted FitzGerald at his lodgings in Kilworth, and a struggle ensued between King and his sister's seducer. In the course of the fight Kingston produced a pistol, fired, and killed FitzGerald. On his arrest the newly ennobled earl demanded his right to be tried in the Irish House of Lords, where he was represented by John Philpot Curran. The trial, the third of its kind in the Irish house, began on 18 May 1798. Faced with a press sympathetic to the actions of an honourable and protective father, the crown offered no evidence against Kingston, who was subsequently acquitted, as was his son at the Cork assizes.<br>
<br>There remains a second, somewhat less sensational, side to Kingston's career. Before his ennoblement he was three times elected MP for co. Cork. Prior to his confrontation with Colonel FitzGerald, Kingston had also earned recognition for his redevelopment of the Mitchelstown estate, which he had inherited at his marriage. Among his more notable improvements were the building of Kingston College, the construction of a new town on a 138 acre site, and the modernization of Mitchelstown Castle along neo-Palladian lines. In this Kingston was assisted and advised by the agrarian improver Arthur Young, who worked on the estate between 1777 and 1778. A decade later Lord and Lady Kingston employed, briefly and unhappily, the young Mary Wollstonecraft as governess to their three eldest daughters. Wollstonecraft's principal dealings were with Caroline, whom she found more engrossed in her lapdogs than in her children; Lord Kingston, though a lesser presence, was thought a scarcely more edifying role model, his countenance suggesting no &#145;more than good humour, and a little <i>fun</i> not refined&#146;  (Wollstonecraft to Eliza Bishop, 5 Nov 1786, <span class="italic">Collected Letters</span>, 123).<br>
<br>Kingston died at Mitchelstown Castle on 17 April 1799, whereupon the title passed to his eldest son, George. He was survived by his wife, from whom he had long been separated; she lived until 13 January 1823 and was buried in Putney, Surrey. Lady Mary Elizabeth King, the object of FitzGerald's intemperate passions, moved to Wales, where, under a false name, she lodged with a clergyman's family until her marriage in April 1805 to George Galbraith Meares of co. Sligo. She died at Shirehampton, Gloucestershire, in summer 1819. The erstwhile defender of her honour, Robert Edward, later first Viscount Lorton, subsequently travelled and wrote on the Italian states before his death in 1854.<br>
