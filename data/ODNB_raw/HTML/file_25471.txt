<span class="headword">Shower, Sir  Bartholomew</span>  (1658&#150;1701), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born on 14 December 1658 in Northgate Street, Exeter, Devon, the fourth of five children of William Shower, merchant, and his wife, Dorcas (<i>bap</i>. 1630), daughter of Exeter merchant John Anthony. Shower attended school in Exeter, and moved to London in 1675, where he initially resided at Newington Green. Shower was raised in a dissenting family. His uncle Mark Down (who baptized him on 26 December 1658) was one of the ministers ejected from his living as a result of the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> of 1662 and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25472/', "John Shower")</script> was a prominent Presbyterian preacher. Shower was admitted to the Middle Temple on 9 September 1676, called to the bar on 21 May 1680, named king's counsel on 14 February 1688, and called to the bench on 25 May 1688. He was a reader at the Middle Temple for the autumn term 1691 and was elected its treasurer on 27 October 1699. Shower later said that he joined the Church of England when he was aged eighteen, but he seemed to retain some dissenting sympathies, advocating greater freedom for dissenting academies and defending the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span>, though he did criticize occasional conformity. In 1699 he prepared a bill against prostitution and adultery, perhaps reflecting his brother John's passionate interest in the reformation of manners.<br>
<br>In some sketchy autobiographical notes published by Butt, Shower indicated that he married on 21 January 1682, but he did not name his wife, nor did he identify her in his will, which left a life estate to &#145;my dear and loving wife&#146;. The will, written only months before his death, mentioned no children of his own, though it bequeathed some property to his nephew Bartholomew and to his niece Dorcas.<br>
<br>Shower first gained public notice with his tract <span class="italic">An Antidote Against Poison</span> (1683), which vehemently attacked Lord Russell's purported scaffold speech that protested his innocence. Shower was appointed deputy recorder of London on 14 April 1686 and in that capacity he achieved notoriety by sentencing four soldiers to death for desertion, despite the known doubts of the recorder, Holt, that desertion constituted a capital crime in peacetime. Shower was knighted on 14 May 1687 upon presenting James II with an address from the Middlesex grand jury that thanked him for the declaration of indulgence. Shower was appointed recorder of London on 6 February 1688, but was removed later that year following the restoration of London's charter. He was also one of the prosecutors of the seven bishops, though in a subordinate role.<br>
<br>As a supporter of James II, Shower fell out of political favour with the revolution of 1688, but he remained active in both law and politics. He published no fewer than three tracts in 1689, defending his earlier work against Lord Russell from attacks by Sir Robert Atkyns and others, though Shower now emphasized the integrity of the prosecution and called for a general amnesty. In 1692 he published <span class="italic">A Reason for a New Bill of Rights</span>, in which he advocated a more specific bill of rights, especially the enactment of the recently unsuccessful <span class="roman">Trials for Treason Bill</span>. Shower collaborated with high-church tories, providing the initial idea for Francis Atterbury's <span class="italic">Letter to a Convocation Man</span> (1697), and he published a bitter attack on Dean William Sherlock regarding the Bingham affair (1696).<br>
<br>Although he was born into a fairly prosperous mercantile family, Shower later remarked that he had been poor as a young lawyer. Be that as it may, his law practice flourished, enabling him to buy a house in Chelsea in 1691 and subsequently to purchase estates in Middlesex at Pinner, Ruislip, and Northolt. Shower represented a number of prominent Jacobite and tory clients throughout the 1690s, such as the Scottish Lord Preston in 1691; several of the conspirators in the assassination plot against William III, among them Sir John Fenwick in 1696; and Charles Duncombe and the old East India Company, both in 1698. He also represented Sir Edward Seymour in his suit against Captain Kirke, and Bishop Watson against efforts to deprive him of the bishopric of St David's.<br>
<br>On 29 August 1698 Shower was sworn in as a freeman of Exeter and as one of its counsels. Later that year he and Seymour were chosen as that city's members for parliament by a larger than expected majority. He was re-elected in 1700 and again in 1701. Shower quickly became one of the leading tory spokesmen in the Commons, supporting the <span class="roman">Disbanding Bill</span> (1698), attacking the whig ministry over the grant to Captain Kidd (1699), and speaking at length against the Kentish petition (1701). He also served as one of the Commons' managers of the impeachment against the Junto Lords. On 17 June 1701 he was elected as one of the seven commissioners of accounts, and he was at least mentioned as a candidate for both attorney-general and speaker. His early death cut short a promising political career.<br>
<br>Eleven works of Shower's, on law and politics, were published, some posthumously. He was the first to publish (in 1698) the judicial decisions of the House of Lords, but the printing ceased when the Lords voted the publication a breach of privilege. Two volumes of Shower's law reports were posthumously published from his manuscript notes. These reports have been much criticized, but both Wallace and Holdsworth note that Shower had not prepared them for publication. George Butt brought out a third edition of Shower's <span class="italic">Reports</span> (1834), correcting numerous transcription errors in the two earlier editions and adding the reports for the Michaelmas term of 1688, but curiously it was the second edition of 1794 that was reprinted in <span class="italic">The English Reports</span> (vol. 89, 1908) and hence is usually cited. Shower became suddenly ill at Temple Church on Sunday 30 November 1701, and he died four days later, on 4 December, from pleurisy at his home in Temple Lane. He was buried on 12 December 1701 at Pinner, where there is a monument to him in the chapel.<br>
<br>An avid and active partisan, Shower was a controversial figure in his day. The country whig Sir Richard Cocks called him &#145;the littlest maliciousest man living&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Sir Richard Cocks</span>, 73), but the tory newspaper <span class="italic">Post Boy</span>, in an unusually long and fulsome obituary, lauded his generosity, &#145;great veracity&#146;, and &#145;sprightly way of pleading&#146;  (<span class="italic">Post Boy</span>, nos. 1023, 1025). Such differing opinions continued into the nineteenth century: to Macaulay, Shower was a &#145;base and hard-hearted pettifogger&#146;  (Macaulay, 5.360), while Butt claimed Shower was &#145;the most accomplished lawyer of his time&#146;, save Holt  (Shower, xi). The more distant twentieth century has tended to regard Shower more dispassionately as an inveterate tory and a skilful lawyer.<br>
