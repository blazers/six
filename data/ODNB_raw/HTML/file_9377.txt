<span class="headword">Ffennell,  William Joshua</span>  (1799&#150;1867), <span class="occ">fisheries inspector</span>, was born on 16 August 1799 at Ballybrado, Waterford, Ireland, the eldest son and second of sixteen children of Joshua William and Elizabeth Ffennell. The family's much resented exclusion from the Society of Friends through his father's liberal &#145;conformity to the world&#146; led to all six sons joining the established church. A nondescript education was enhanced by country gentleman's pursuits. In 1830 he married Margaret Catherine, youngest daughter of Robert Prendergast of Greenmount, co. Tipperary, with whom he had nine children.<br>
<br>In 1824, after taking a lease at Carrigataha, and later being appointed to the commission of the peace in 1834, Ffennell improved the salmon fisheries of the River Suir. This was achieved by the use of firmness, impartiality, and tact at the local level. In 1837 he and his neighbour, Lord Glengall, became secretary and chairman of the newly founded Suir Preservation Society, and were instrumental in obtaining the <span class="roman">Salmon Acts</span> of 1842, 1844, and 1845 which aided the improvement of freshwater salmon fisheries in Ireland. Ffennell was appointed sea and freshwater fishery inspector under the 1842 act. He was appointed inspecting commissioner under the 1848 act (commonly called <span class="roman">Ffennell's Act</span>), which founded modern salmon legislation by making administration of the acts local and self-supporting. During the potato famine he attempted to introduce fish curing to the west coast of Ireland.<br>
<br>Ffennell's expertise was much sought after, and he appeared before many fishery commissions in England and Scotland. In 1860 he was appointed to the royal commission on salmon fisheries, resulting in an act under which he was appointed (28 February 1862) inspector of fisheries for England and Wales under the auspices of the Home Office. Shortly afterwards he was made commissioner of fisheries for Scotland and was involved in the preparation of five major salmon fishery bills. During 1863 in Ireland, and 1865 in England, he was instrumental in obtaining an act that fulfilled his lifelong ambition of banning stake weirs in rivers. His concern for fisheries and fishermen in general, highlighted by his countrywide investigations into fishery problems, led to the appointment of a royal commission to inquire into sea fisheries (1863&#150;5).<br>
<br>Ffennell's main attribute was his ability to convey to all walks of life his practical knowledge and expertise on all fishery matters. His fair and effective manner of settling disputes at local level made salmon inspectorship successful until the early 1880s. His influence was the catalyst that brought parliamentary prominence to the production of fish as a mid-nineteenth century staple of diet. He co-wrote the first six annual reports of the inspectors of salmon fisheries for England and Wales between 1862 and 1867. He wrote pamphlets, gave many lectures, and supplied information and expertise for several books. In 1866, to popularize fisheries and fishing matters, Ffennell started the weekly periodical <span class="italic">Land and Water</span>, with Frank (Francis T.) Buckland. Buckland succeeded to the salmon fisheries inspectorship post following Ffennell's death at his home in Arundel Gardens, Notting Hill, London, on 12 March 1867. His wife had predeceased him.<br>
