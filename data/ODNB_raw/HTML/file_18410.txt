<span class="headword">Maxwell,  Robert</span>, fifth Lord Maxwell  (<em>c.</em>1494&#150;1546), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54291/', "John Maxwell, fourth Lord Maxwell (d. 1513)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54289/', "Maxwell, Herbert, first Lord Maxwell")</script>], and Agnes, daughter of Sir Alexander Stewart of Garlies. He was married after 4 July 1509 to Janet Douglas (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1520), daughter of Sir William Douglas of Drumlanrig, and knighted before 29 November 1510. He became hereditary steward of Annandale on 10 June 1513 on his father's resignation, and held the office of admiral of the fleet when the royal army suffered its crushing defeat at Flodden on 9 September 1513, his father being among those killed. Robert was served heir on 4 November following and received the wardenship of the west march in 1515 in return for helping the duke of Albany to deprive Alexander, third Lord Home, of the latter's march wardenships. He also benefited from the distribution of Home estates following their forfeiture.<br>
<br>Maxwell remained loyal to Albany, and he was on the council which in 1517 established procedures for the government of the realm during Albany's absence in France. Albany returned in November 1521, and in the following autumn led a large army to attack the English west march. Maxwell served as a hostage in Carlisle during the meeting on 11 September 1522 between Albany and Thomas, Lord Dacre, warden of the English march, which led to a truce being agreed. Maxwell and Dacre subsequently stood surety for the maintenance of the truce, which was extended until March 1523, when open war was resumed. In the meantime Maxwell turned his attentions to expanding his influence in south-west Scotland, not least by securing a large measure of control over the lands of monasteries there. In 1523 his brother John became abbot of Dundrennan. Maxwell was quick to exploit his increased importance during periods of cross-border tension, especially as the government distrusted Andrew Kerr of Cessford, warden of the middle march. When hostilities resumed, Maxwell prepared resistance to an expected English invasion of south-west Scotland.<br>
<br>Queen Margaret had worked hard to have Albany's pro-French policies rejected, and her ascendancy brought Maxwell further rewards as he pledged his political allegiance to her, becoming one of her closest supporters. She helped him to extend his influence into Galloway, and on 9 September 1524 granted him the castles of Threave and Lochmaben as hereditary patrimony; she also appointed him steward of Kirkcudbright for nineteen years and made him principal captain of the royal guard. In addition to this she intervened directly in the burghal privileges of Edinburgh in order to secure the election of Maxwell as provost of Edinburgh. The instability of administration in the years which followed, as the queen competed for power with her estranged second husband, the sixth earl of Angus, had little effect on Maxwell's position, thanks to his indispensability on the west march, where his wardenship was repeatedly renewed. In July 1525 parliament devised an arrangement for the custody of the young king whereby four groups of prominent men would take turns to hold James for three months each; Maxwell was a member of the fourth group, along with the earls of Lennox, Montrose, and Glencairn.<br>
<br>The scheme foundered because the first group, led by Angus himself, refused to relinquish control of the king's person at the end of its term. Angus subsequently alienated Maxwell by the support he gave to John Johnstone of that ilk, a potential rival in the west march whose family had recently initiated what would prove to be an exceptionally long-lasting and bloody feud with the Maxwells by killing one of the Armstrongs, a powerful family on the Scottish west march who were clients of Maxwell's. The two men fell out further over the latter's attempts to stabilize the borders, where the Armstrongs had embarrassed the Scottish government by providing shelter for English rebels and by raiding across the border. Repeated complaints by Lord Dacre that no efforts were being made either to prevent such attacks or to give redress conveyed the humiliating impression that Angus was able to control neither Maxwell nor his followers. Hence, perhaps, Lady Dacre's report in May 1528 that Maxwell was in trouble with the king and dared not go to Edinburgh, but had sent his wife instead.<br>
<br>James V, chafing under the tutelage of Angus, viewed the inability of Angus to deal with border lawlessness as a perfect excuse to challenge his authority and condemn his actions. It is possible that Lady Maxwell was able to inform her husband of a rift between the king and Angus, as Maxwell was with the king at Stirling later in May 1528, and on 4 July he was appointed chief carver to the king in the royal household. Maxwell accompanied the king from Stirling to Edinburgh, where on 6 July he took part in a session of the lords of council and was confirmed as warden of the west march, with Lord Home replacing Angus in the east march. As James V began his personal rule, Maxwell was appointed once again to the office of provost of Edinburgh, replacing Archibald Douglas of Kilspindie. He arrived in Edinburgh in August with an armed force and surrounded the provost's house while Kilspindie and his nephews were at dinner. They were forced to flee to Tantallon and Maxwell proceeded to apply himself assiduously to royal service.<br>
<br>The problem of lawlessness on the borders preoccupied James V at the end of 1529, and a series of justice ayres was held in the south-west at which the king and Maxwell presided. However, the problems were far from resolved and in May 1530 it was ordained that the king should ride to the borders and execute justice, while the chief border magnates, including Maxwell, remained in ward. Maxwell appears to have accepted his warding in Edinburgh Castle, as direct royal initiative on the border was preferable to the threat of the earl of Moray assuming the lieutenancy of all three marches. Maxwell also appreciated that he had to demonstrate his loyalty to the king in order to retain his favour, and he even countenanced the execution of his tenant John Armstrong of Staplegordon or Gilnockie&#151;the famous gang-leader Johnnie Armstrong&#151;with whom he had a bond of manrent. A clear message of strong royal authority having thus been delivered, Maxwell's bond for good rule was accepted by the king, and he received royal sanction for the marriage of his son Robert with Beatrice Douglas, daughter of the earl of Morton. Robert was taken to be brought up in the king's household, and Maxwell was even the recipient of some of Armstrong's escheated goods.<br>
<br>Maxwell's position was strengthened further when in 1536&#150;7 he was appointed one of six vice-regents of the realm when the king was in France. In 1537 he intercepted his erstwhile patron Queen Margaret as she was fleeing to England and returned her to Stirling. He served as juror on the three major treason trials of the period 1537&#150;40, including that of Janet Douglas, Lady Glamis. In 1538 he was entrusted with the task of travelling to France and acting as the king's proxy in his marriage to Mary of Guise; the ceremony took place on 9 May at the castle of Ch&acirc;teaudun, when Maxwell placed the ring on the new queen's finger and then distributed 40 crowns among the officials and minstrels in attendance. After a few weeks he escorted Mary to Rouen and then to Le Havre, where on 10 June they embarked on a ship bound for Fife. In 1540 Maxwell accompanied the king on his expedition to the isles, and on 6 June he received royal confirmation of his charters, uniting his possessions into the free barony of Maxwell, with Caerlaverock Castle as its centre.<br>
<br>Late in October 1542 Maxwell was ordered to bring the men of the west march to Selkirk, to join there with those of Liddesdale to meet or cut off the advance of the duke of Norfolk. The latter withdrew, however, and Maxwell and his men went back to the west march for a raid into England. The issue of who commanded the Scottish forces that came to grief at Solway Moss on 24 November has given rise to controversy. Some sources name Maxwell himself as the defeated commander, but it seems more likely that it was Oliver Sinclair of Pitcairn, of whom Sir George Douglas of Pittendriech reported on 16 December that he &#145;was chief captain of the army and lost the King's banner there&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 17, no. 1209). There is at any rate no doubt that the Scots, caught between a river and a bog, fought valiantly before surrendering. Maxwell was the richest magnate to be taken prisoner, with landed revenues valued at 4000 marks and 3000 marks in goods.<br>
<br>To secure his release Maxwell became one of the &#145;assured lords&#146; who at the end of December signed a bond pledging themselves to assist Henry VIII in his Scottish policies. It may have been in compliance with this undertaking that he introduced into parliament the bill enacted in March 1543 which permitted the possession and reading of the scriptures in the vernacular, though he was also alleged to have Lutheran sympathies. But although he appears to have been on bad terms with the francophile Cardinal Beaton, he made no further efforts to promote the English cause. Indeed, so lukewarm was Maxwell on King Henry's behalf that when he was arrested by the Scottish government in Edinburgh on 1 November 1544 there were rumours that he had been taken with his own connivance, and when he was released on 15 May 1545 he was swiftly taken into custody by the English forces in and around Edinburgh and carried back to London. He secured his release by placing his castles of Lochmaben and Caerlaverock in English hands, but late in November they were recaptured by the earl of Arran, and Maxwell himself was taken prisoner. Mary of Guise accepted his plea that he had acted under duress; she pardoned him and on 12 January 1546 appointed him justiciar of Annandale, Kirkcudbright, Wigtown, and Dumfries. Maxwell attended meetings of the privy council and on 3 June resumed his former office of warden of the west march. He did not hold it for long, however, for he died at Logan on 9 July 1546.<br>
<br>Maxwell's heir Robert was the eldest son of his marriage to Janet Douglas. They also had another son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18403/', "John Maxwell (later Lord Herries)")</script>, and a daughter. Janet died about 1520 and by 1525 Maxwell had married Agnes, illegitimate daughter of James Stewart, thirteenth earl of Buchan; they had no children. Maxwell also had an illegitimate son, said to have been ancestor of the Maxwells of Logan.<br>
