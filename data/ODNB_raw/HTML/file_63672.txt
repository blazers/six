<span class="headword">Ramsbotham,  Herwald</span>, first Viscount Soulbury  (1887&#150;1971), <span class="occ">politician and governor-general of Ceylon</span>, was born on 6 March 1887 at Winterbrook, Cholsey, Berkshire, the son of Herwald Ramsbotham (1859&#150;1941), and his wife, Ethel Margaret Bevan (<i>d</i>. 1943), daughter of T. Bevan of Stone Park, Greenhithe, Kent. He came from a distinguished wealthy Lancashire family noted for public service. He was educated at Uppingham School, and at University College, Oxford, where he graduated with a first class in moderations and Greats. In 1911 he was called to the bar, and subsequently practised as a barrister. He married Doris Violet (1890&#150;1954), the daughter of Sigmund Sinaner de Stein, a wealthy banker, in Kensington on 14 November 1911. They had two sons and a daughter. The younger son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/103168/', "Sir Peter Edward Ramsbotham (1919&#150;2010)")</script>, was later British Ambassador in Washington.<br>
<br>In the First World War, Ramsbotham commanded a company of the 7th battalion of the Bedfordshire regiment, before becoming staff-captain of the 53rd infantry brigade and deputy assistant adjutant-general. He was mentioned in dispatches three times, awarded the Military Cross, and appointed an OBE. Following the end of hostilities he worked in the City of London. Intent on a career in politics he contested Lancaster in 1910 and 1928 as a Conservative. He was finally elected for the constituency in 1929, and remained an MP until his elevation to the peerage in 1941. He became parliamentary secretary to Lord Halifax, president of the Board of Education, in 1931. His responsibilities were great, as Lord Halifax was employed in other duties and took little interest in public education. In 1935 Ramsbotham became parliamentary secretary to the board of agriculture before becoming minister of pensions, an office in which he continued to assist the minister of agriculture in the House of Commons. In 1939 he was appointed first commissioner of works and was sworn of the privy council. In April 1940 he became president of the Board of Education following the resignation of Lord De La Warr. This position was widely regarded as a political backwater.<br>
<br>Unlike his immediate predecessors, who had been keen to move on to more prestigious positions, Ramsbotham remained at the ministry and initiated important reforms. One of his priorities was to restore the coherence of the educational system, which had become fragmented by the process of evacuation. He was also instrumental in developing plans for its long-term reorganization. The board's proposals were embodied in the so-called green book. Although confidential, this was distributed &#145;in such a blaze of secrecy that it achieved an unusual degree of publicity&#146;  (McKibbin, 221). This pioneering document, although based on an administrative approach to the educational service, was firmly based on the premise that the reforms must meet the educational requirements of the children. It highlighted the unfairness and indefensible inequalities of the educational system after the age of eleven. According to Nigel Middleton and Sophia Weitzman's <span class="italic">A Place for Everyone</span> this innovation was instrumental in establishing a new constitutional approach based on a more open form of constructive debate. However, Ramsbotham &#145;was moving too fast for Churchill&#146;  (McKibbin, 221), and he was replaced by R. A. Butler in July 1941. The latter nevertheless continued the process of reform initiated by Ramsbotham. In July 1941 as compensation for relinquishing his position at the Board of Education he was raised to the peerage as Baron Soulbury of Soulbury. He was also appointed chairman of the recently renamed Assistance Board. The functions of its predecessor, the Unemployment Assistance Board, had been radically extended the previous year following the transfer to it of the administration of pensions relief, war distress, and allowances to families of men in the forces. In addition it had become responsible for the care of evacuees and air-raid victims. In 1942 Soulbury was appointed chairman of the standing joint committee on teachers' salaries (the Burnham committee), a position he retained until 1949.<br>
<br>In November 1944 Soulbury became chairman of the commission on constitutional reform for Ceylon. The Soulbury commission report, issued in October 1945, drafted a constitution for Ceylon which provided self-government while retaining some imperial safeguards in defence and external affairs. Ceylonese leaders pressed for the removal of these safeguards, demanding the grant of dominion status. This was affirmed with the <span class="roman">Ceylon Independence Act</span> of 1947, which was widely portrayed as a bold experiment in Western-style parliamentary government in a plural society. Soulbury was subsequently appointed governor-general of Ceylon, arriving in Colombo in June 1949. Within a month he was fluent enough to make his first speech in Sinhalese to the Ceylon National Congress. It was a testing appointment for Soulbury as the path to independence proved considerably more challenging than expected: Soulbury had to cope with the effects of the unexpected death of the prime minister, D. S. Senanayake, in March 1952, the general election later that year, and also a visit to Ceylon by Elizabeth II and the duke of Edinburgh. Early in 1954, moreover, shortly before the formal end of Soulbury's period of office, his wife died after being run down by a London bus.<br>
<br>Following his return to England in July 1954 Soulbury was raised to a viscountcy. He continued to intervene occasionally in the House of Lords, and in August 1956, at the invitation of the archbishop of Canterbury, he was appointed chairman of the National Society. He was also chairman of the board of governors of the Royal Ballet School, from 1956 to 1964. On 10 November 1962 he married (Carmen) Ursula, widow of Frederick Wakeham and daughter of Armand and Helen Jerome. She died two years later on 12 November 1964.<br>
<br>Soulbury is best remembered for his contribution to educational reform in Britain, and for his role in guiding Ceylon to independence. He had an impressive capacity for hard work, coupled with ability for common sense and shrewd judgement. His popularity among his departmental colleagues was a testimony to his good humour and charm. As leader of the commission which reported on Ceylon's future he played a key role in formulating a workmanlike constitution and made strenuous efforts during his period as governor-general to run the country in an effective way. A lucid if not inspirational orator, he gained a reputation as an honest broker and a safe pair of hands. Soulbury died on 30 January 1971 at Stoke House, Stoke Fleming, near Newton Abbot, Devon.<br>
