<span class="headword">Ayscu <span class="st"> [Ayscough]</span>,  Edward</span>  (1550&#150;1616/17), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was a native of Cotham or Nun Cotham, Lincolnshire. Several branches of the family were resident in Lincolnshire, and this has occasioned considerable confusion as to the identity of the historian, who was the son of Edward Ayscough (<i>d</i>. 1558), Henry VIII's cup-bearer, and his wife, Margaret Gibson (<i>d</i>. 1593), daughter of Thomas Gibson of Cotham. Anne Askew, the Henrician protestant martyr, was his father's sister. The elder Ayscough settled at Cotham some time before 1550, the year in which, in August, Edward the younger was born. Little is known about Ayscu's education or career, but he married Ursula, daughter of Henry Skipwith; she died in 1611. The couple had four sons, Henry, William, Edward, and John, and a daughter, Janet.<br>
<br>Ayscu the historian appears to have spent most of his time in Cotham, and it is from there that he dates his only known work, <span class="italic">A historie contayning the warres, treaties, marriages, and other occurrents betweene England and Scotland, from King William the Conqueror</span> (1607). One of a number of such histories written in the early years of the reign of James I, it was clearly inspired by the project to unite the kingdoms of Scotland and England. Dedicated to Henry, prince of Wales, it provides a history of the relations between the two kingdoms from Roman times to the accession of James to the English crown. Although presented largely in an English perspective, the <span class="italic">Historie</span> aspired to provide a balanced account that harmonized the conflicting narratives of Scottish and English chroniclers. Although Ayscu often takes Scottish historians to task on particular points, he is firm in his belief that the two countries, cohabiting the same island, were destined to unite both by common ethnic origins and by providence. He takes the side of Robert Bruce in recounting the Scottish wars of independence in the early fourteenth century, though he periodically slips into the habit of regarding the Scots as having &#145;rebelled&#146; against an English overlordship whose legitimacy is presumed. Ayscu was well read in medieval chronicles and modern authorities such as William Camden. Although the <span class="italic">Historie</span> begins by stating that all European nations are descended from Noah's son Japheth (as was then commonly believed), its author shows a much greater degree of scepticism towards other ancient myths and legends, including that of Brutus the Trojan, than may be found in many contemporaneous works. A firm protestant who openly avows Anne Askew as his aunt, Ayscu makes frequent jibes against the papacy and Catholicism, while treading carefully around the queenship of James I's mother, Mary, queen of Scots.<br>
<br>Ayscu dated his will 31 August 1616, from Lincoln, but it was not proved until 17 March 1617, principally owing to the absence overseas of his eldest son and executor, Henry. In his will he describes himself as living in Lincoln, and it may have been there that he consulted the sources used in his <span class="italic">Historie</span>. Edward Ayscu the historian has in the past been confused with his cousin, <a name="cosubject_955"></a><span class="headword">Sir Edward Ayscu</span>  (1596&#150;1654?) of South Kelsey, who was the great-great-grandson of his namesake's grandfather. The confusion probably stems from this second Edward Ayscu's antiquarian associations, above all with Sir Robert Cotton, with whom, and with Sir Henry Spelman, he served on a number of commissions between 1627 and 1630, for instance inquiring into the exactions of fees by crown officials since 1569. He was <span class="occ">sheriff of Lincoln</span> in 1632, having represented the city in parliament in 1628, and in 1640 he was a knight of the shire for Lincolnshire. Indicted for high treason at Grantham in 1643, he survived to draw up his will in November 1648, and probably lived longer, since it was not proved until 1 July 1654. Ayscu had married Frances Clifford while he was still a child, about 1606; she outlived her husband, dying in 1658 or 1659.<br>
