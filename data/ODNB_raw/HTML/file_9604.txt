<span class="headword">Fitzherbert,  Nicholas</span>  (1550&#150;1612), <span class="occ">author</span>, was the second son of John Fitzherbert of Padley, Derbyshire, and his wife, who was the daughter of Edward Fleetwood of Vache. He was a cousin of the Jesuit <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9605/', "Thomas Fitzherbert")</script>, rector of the English College, Rome. Fitzherbert was at Exeter College, Oxford, in 1568 and his name appears in the matriculation register as senior undergraduate in 1572. His father and two uncles died in prison for their religious beliefs. An elder brother converted to the Church of England and joined with Richard Topcliffe in a plot to secure hold of the family estates. Another brother was a Franciscan friar in Spain. This religious division in the family helps to explain some of Fitzherbert's subsequent ambiguous conduct.<br>
<br>It was about the 1570s that Nicholas Fitzherbert left England for the continent. He did not take holy orders but in 1580 he was studying civil law in Bologna and in his absence he was attainted of treason in England. In a letter from Rheims of 23 April 1583 to the rector of the English College in Rome, Allen expressed his gratitude to Fitzherbert for assistance he had given him. When Allen became cardinal in 1587 Fitzherbert entered his service and his name occurs in a list of Allen's household in 1594. After Allen died he served Cardinal Palavicino but he was also in contact with his convert brother in England. He was critical of Richard Barret's administration of the college at Rheims, and was opposed to the policies of Robert Parsons and inclined to the views of Owen Lewis. This led to accusations that he was fomenting trouble among the students at the college in Rome. In a letter of 10 December 1596 to the Jesuit-General, Acquaviva, he was named as one of the laymen in Rome who was supporting the rebellious students.<br>
<br>Fitzherbert lived for several years in Rome as the pope's pensioner, but he was suspected by his opponents of acting as intelligencer to the English government, and it seems certain that he corresponded with and visited Anthony Standen, the English ambassador in Venice. Parsons tried to get Cardinal Palavicino to have Fitzherbert transferred to Spain. He had already translated and published in Rome in 1595 a Latin version of Galateo's <span class="italic">Tratto dei costumi</span>, and this was followed by a Latin work describing Oxford University (published in Rome in 1602) and by his <span class="italic">De antiquitate et continuatione catholicae religionis in Anglia</span>, which includes a Latin biography of Cardinal Allen (Rome, 1608). It is in this work that Fitzherbert criticizes Richard Barret and pays tribute to Owen Lewis's part in the foundation of the English College in Rome. He speaks highly of the way in which Allen treated the members of his household as sons rather than as servants or employees.<br>
<br>Fitzherbert himself had his admirers, and in a letter he received from Augustine Bradshaw, the prior of the English Benedictines at Douai in 1607, he learned that Bradshaw was prepared to forward his name as a candidate should there be a decision to appoint a bishop for the Catholics of England. His status as a layman, it was argued, ought not to be any more of an obstacle than it was for St Ambrose's election as bishop of Milan. However, Nicholas Fitzherbert was accidentally drowned while on a journey to Rome when he was attempting to ford a stream called La Pesa a few miles south of Florence on 6 November 1612. He was buried in the Benedictine abbey at Florence.<br>
