<span class="headword">Stampfl,  Franz</span>  (1913&#150;1995), <span class="occ">athletics coach</span>, was born in Vienna on 18 November 1913. Little is known of his early life. He was a student at the Akademie der Bildenden K&uuml;nste, Vienna, in the 1930s but also keen on skiing and athletics. Although something of an all-rounder, his speciality was throwing the javelin. He later claimed to have taken part in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. He left Austria for London when it appeared that a Nazi take-over of the country was imminent. Once there he joined the South London Harriers athletic club, where he both competed and began coaching; he subsequently coached in Northern Ireland. At the outbreak of war in 1939 he tried to join the British forces but instead found himself interned as an enemy alien. He was sent to Canada and was on the liner <i>Arandora Star</i> when it was torpedoed in the Atlantic on 2 July 1940. Six hundred and eighty-two people died but Stampfl was one of the survivors picked up after several hours in the icy waters off the northern coast of Ireland. He was then sent to Australia on the <i>Dunera</i>. He later recalled the brutal treatment which was a feature of the internment camps. <br>
<br>In 1946 Stampfl returned to London and established himself as a freelance athletics coach, charging 6<i>d</i>. or 1<i>s</i>. for evening sessions at the duke of York's barracks on the King's Road in Chelsea. It was there that he met some of the leading British athletes of the time, most notably the middle-distance trio Roger Bannister, Christopher Brasher, and Christopher Chataway. <br>
<br>By the early 1950s sport in general and athletics in particular had become one of the sites where cold-war rivalries were most publicly played out. It was well known that the superiority of Eastern European runners such as Emil Zatopek and Vladimir Kuts was based on ferocious training sessions of up to six hours daily. Many British athletes, particularly those educated at public school and Oxbridge, remained sceptical about training and coaches&#151;tending to rely on privileged access to facilities, natural ability, and an aristocratic tradition of effortless superiority to see them through. Stampfl spoke directly to these part-time athletes when he said that training periods of between an hour and an hour and a half a day all the year round could still produce world-beating athletes. This was to be achieved by exercising the mind as well as the body. Good training was necessary because it bred confidence, and the development of a powerful mental state was an important part of training. As for the physical side, the aim was the scientific one of finding the level of efficiency of an athlete, and this was best achieved when a specific effort was repeated over and over again. Gradual extensions of the intensity of that effort would enable the body successively to adapt. Stampfl's system was known as interval training, which for a middle-distance specialist might involve, in an evening, ten fast laps of 400 yards with a two-minute jogging rest period in between, or four or five half-miles again with only a short breathing space between each. This was at a time when there were influential critics of &#145;excessive&#146; training within the British athletics establishment, especially when practised by runners from less privileged backgrounds, such as Jim Peters and Gordon Pirie. <br>
<br>By the autumn of 1953 Bannister, Brasher, and Chataway were training with Stampfl two or three nights a week, and often eating with him afterwards. Chataway later thought that more than Stampfl's athletic knowledge it was his vivid conversation and effervescent personality that drew them to him. Training might be both boring and painful but Stampfl's enthusiasm could make it seem not only worthwhile but certain to produce records and victories. Stampfl helped Bannister become the first man to run a mile in under four minutes (in Oxford on 6 May 1954). He also helped Chataway achieve a world record and Brasher to win an Olympic gold medal. <br>
<br>In 1955 Stampfl took up a full-time coaching post at the University of Melbourne funded jointly by the Victoria Amateur Athletic Association, the National Fitness Council, and the university, in an attempt to improve Australian standards for the 1956 Olympics. Brasher, Chataway, and Derek Johnson went out early to Melbourne in part to benefit from his advice and support. Not everyone was pleased with his appointment and at times an unedifying rivalry developed between Stampfl and Percy Cerutty and their celebrated milers Merv Lincoln and Herb Elliott. Stampfl also coached Ralph Doubell, who won the 800 metres at the Mexico City Olympics in 1968, as well as runners Ron Clarke and Peter Bourke, long jumper Allan Crawley, triple jumper Phil May, and shot putter Gael Mulhall. Stampfl remained a successful and influential coach and authority on athletics. His book <span class="italic">Franz Stampfl on Running</span> (1955) was translated into several languages and sold 500,000 copies in Europe and 100,000 in the Soviet Union. His fame allowed him to conduct fitness groups for businessmen, write newspaper columns, and comment on track and field for radio and television. <br>
<br>In 1986 Stampfl was seriously injured in a car accident and spent the remainder of his life in a wheelchair, though he continued to help those athletes who consulted him. He died at his home in Melbourne on 19 March 1995, leaving a widow, Patricia, and a son. At his funeral Ralph Doubell said:<blockquote>At University, Franz became not only my coach but my mentor, guardian and guide. At times the relationship was almost psychic. In a race I could feel his thinking about what I should do next, when to make my move. &hellip; It may be difficult for people outside the sporting arena to understand the bond between athlete and coach, but there is something there that transcends even family relationships. (Phillips, 75)</blockquote>
