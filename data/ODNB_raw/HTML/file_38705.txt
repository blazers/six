<span class="headword">Hunt,  (Isabel) Violet</span>  (1862&#150;1942), <span class="occ">author and literary hostess</span>, was born on 28 September 1862 at 29 Old Elvet, Durham, the eldest of the three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14188/', "Alfred William Hunt (1830&#150;1896)")</script>, landscape watercolourist, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55789/', "Margaret Raine Hunt (1831&#150;1912)")</script>, novelist and translator. She was tutored at home and in 1877 graduated from Notting Hill and Ealing high school, one of London's first public day schools for girls, going on to study at the Kensington Art School (1877&#150;9).<br>
<br>Violet Hunt had literary aspirations, a sharp tongue, and the magnetism to attract influential people. An early admirer was the young Oscar Wilde, who called her &#145;the sweetest Violet in England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Oscar Wilde</span>, 64). In her memoirs she asserted that she &#145;as nearly as possible escaped the honour of being Mrs. Wilde&#146;  (Hunt, 168). In fact she really preferred older married men, including her first lover, George Henry Boughton, a Royal Academy artist, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32620/', "Oswald John Frederick Crawfurd (1834&#150;1909)")</script>, a diplomatist and publisher, from whom she contracted syphilis during their relationship (1890&#150;1900). She seduced Somerset Maugham, and was in turn seduced by H. G. Wells; later she was known as the self-proclaimed wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33197/', "Ford Madox Ford (1873&#150;1939)")</script>, then known as Hueffer. Her ten-year affair with the writer, eleven years her junior, was one of the saddest stories in literary history: it resulted in scandal, lawsuits, and tabloid headlines.<br>
<br>Violet Hunt wrote short stories, seventeen novels, a memoir of her Edwardian years, and a biography of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37957/', "Elizabeth Siddal")</script>, wife of Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Novels such as <span class="italic">The Maiden's Progress</span> (1894) and <span class="italic">A Hard Woman</span> (1895) are typical examples of the &#145;new woman&#146; genre, exploring various routes of resistance to the constraints placed on women by late nineteenth-century society. <span class="italic">The Human Interest</span> (1899), its heroine &#145;a great Ibsenite&#146;, frankly explores sexual problems, as does much of her fiction, including her later novel <span class="italic">White Rose of Weary Leaf</span> (1908), felt by many to be her best work, and the short-story collection <span class="italic">Tales of the Uneasy</span> (1911). Her autobiographical novels, <span class="italic">Their Lives</span> (1916), where Wilde appears as Philip Wynyard, and <span class="italic">Their Hearts</span> (1921) are of interest for their depictions of notable figures.<br>
<br>Violet Hunt's literary reputation stems, however, more from her Kensington salons at South Lodge, Campden Hill, where she entertained Rebecca West, Ezra Pound, Joseph Conrad, Wyndham Lewis, D. H. Lawrence, and Henry James; she founded the Women Writers' Suffrage League, and in 1921 she co-founded PEN with Mrs C. A. &#145;Sappho&#146; Dawson, electing John Galsworthy as president. In 1908 she helped Ford to start the <span class="italic">English Review</span>, the literary magazine that discovered D. H. Lawrence, with the publication of &#145;The Odour of Chrysanthemums&#146;. Lawrence said wryly of Hunt: &#145;I rather like her&#151;she's such a real assassin&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Letters</span>, 98). Violet Hunt appears as the manipulative Florence in Ford's <span class="italic">The Good Soldier</span> and the termagant Sylvia in <span class="italic">Parade's End</span>. In <span class="italic">The Moon and Sixpence</span> Maugham used her as the original for Rose Waterford, a Pre-Raphaelite beauty who looked on life as an opportunity for writing novels. Her features inform the paintings of Edward Burne-Jones and Walter Sickert, for both of whom she modelled.<br>
<br>Violet Hunt died of pneumonia at South Lodge during the blitz at the age of seventy-nine on 16 January 1942, and was buried in the Brookwood cemetery. <span class="italic">The Times</span>'s obituary noted that, artistically, &#145;certain types&#151;especially of disagreeable worldly women&#151;she drew with extreme skill&#146;, and accurately concluded that, personally, &#145;kindness of heart and feeling for the troubles of others lay behind her often acid speeches&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 19 Jan 1942).<br>
