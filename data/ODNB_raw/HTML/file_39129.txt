<span class="headword">Bald</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>900), <span class="occ">supposed physician and medical writer</span>, was the owner and probable author of a work titled <span class="italic">L&aelig;ceboc</span> (leechbook), a compilation in Old English of medical recipes and treatments. All that is known of Bald is to be found in the Latin verse colophon to the <span class="italic">L&aelig;ceboc</span>, as found in the British Library manuscript  (BL, Royal MS 12 D.xvii) and written about 950, most probably at Winchester. The colophon begins: &#145;Bald owns this book, which he ordered Cild to write&#146;. It also states that the <span class="italic">L&aelig;ceboc</span> is the dearest of all Bald's books. Everything else that can be said about Bald is inference from these statements and from the internal evidence of the work itself.<br>
<br>The manuscript appears to be a copy of an exemplar written some fifty years earlier, hence the suggestion that Bald may have been active about 900, that is, in the very last years of the reign of Alfred the Great. The work is in two books dealing respectively with externally and internally manifested ailments. It draws on the standard works of early medieval Mediterranean medicine as well as on native material and is distinguished by its high level of organization. It is impossible to know whether Bald or Cild selected and arranged the materials, because the word <i>componere</i> (write) could mean either &#145;write down&#146; or &#145;compose&#146; in medieval Latin. It may be conjectured that Bald was a physician and a layman able to read English (and probably medical Latin) living in the late ninth century, probably in the vicinity of Winchester, who had available to him several books on medicine in Latin and English, from which he (or Cild) selected, modified, and arranged medical materials into the two parts of the <span class="italic">L&aelig;ceboc</span>. It is tempting to think that its composition may have owed something to the stimulus of Alfred's revival of learning. At any rate, Bald, whether or not he was author of his <span class="italic">L&aelig;ceboc</span>, has left to posterity an example of vernacular medical material of the greatest value for assessing the medical competence of Anglo-Saxon practitioners. If his book had not survived it would not be known that such practitioners were familiar with the standard works in Latin containing the best of Greek and Roman medicine, and integrated them into an English tradition to produce prescriptions that were &#145;about as good as anything prescribed before the mid-twentieth century&#146;  (Cameron, 117).<br>
