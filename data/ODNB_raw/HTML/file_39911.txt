<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Moore,  Gerald Frederick</span>  (1899&#150;1987), <span class="occ">pianist and accompanist</span>, was born on 30 July 1899 in Watford, Hertfordshire, the eldest in the family of three sons and a daughter, who died in childhood, of David Frank Moore, who owned a men's outfitting establishment, and his Welsh-born wife, Chestina Jones. He was educated at Watford grammar school. Musical, with perfect pitch, he learned the piano locally with Wallis Bandey. When, owing to a financial crisis, the family decided to emigrate to Toronto, Canada, the thirteen-year-old Gerald had to start again with his piano studies. His mother arranged an audition with Michael Hambourg, founder of a school of music in Toronto. This resulted in a scholarship and much expert coaching. Hambourg's cellist son, Boris, later took Moore as his accompanist on a tour of forty engagements in western Canada. When Moore finally was shipped back to London in 1919, it was another Hambourg son&#151;the pianist Mark Hambourg&#151;who offered to take over his training.<br>
<br>But Moore was not cut out for a career as a soloist and on the advice of Landon Ronald, then principal of the Guildhall School of Music, he concentrated on accompanying. He went on tour with baritone Peter Dawson and was engaged on an exclusive basis by the tenor John Coates. Coates taught him to work and awakened his realization of the importance of the piano part in the basic structure of the song: Moore said he owed everything to him.<br>
<br>In 1921 Moore made his first record (for HMV), with Ren&eacute;e Chemet, the French violinist. The studio had a large horn contraption into which the violinist played. In spite of the piece being a gentle lullaby Moore had to play fortissimo throughout in order to be heard at all on the record.<br>
<br>A vital step forward for Moore was the arrival on the recording scene of the microphone. At last his playing would be faithfully reproduced on records. At first he was greatly shocked by hearing himself. But by listening carefully he was able to improve, technically and musically, and raise his playing to a new standard, which took him to the top. Apart from many instrumentalists, his famous vocal partners included Elena Gerhardt, Elisabeth Schumann, Maggie Teyte, John McCormack, Hans Hotter, Kathleen Ferrier, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Victoria de los Angeles, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, and Janet Baker.<br>
<br>When Myra Hess started her series of lunchtime concerts in the National Gallery, during the Second World War, she asked Moore to give a talk at the piano on his experiences as an accompanist. He revealed a sense of verbal timing of which any professional comic would be proud. His unique blend of wit and wisdom not only pleased the cognoscenti but also won over ordinary people who had no idea that classical music could be fun. This kind of treatment has its dangers, but not with Moore, who always put the music first and used the jokes to sugar the pill. The talk became immensely popular. His first book, <span class="italic">The Unashamed Accompanist</span> (1943; 3rd edn, 1984) grew out of these talks.<br>
<br>Moore played throughout the world as an accompanist and included many tours of the United States as a lecture-recitalist. His favourite festivals included Edinburgh, Salzburg, and King's Lynn (where he played piano duets with Ruth, Lady Fermoy).<br>
<br>Moore retired from the concert platform in 1967, at the comparatively early age of sixty-seven, when he was at the top of his form. A farewell concert, which was recorded, was given in his honour at the Royal Festival Hall on 20 February 1967. After Moore gave up public playing his great affection for Schubert became an obsession: he embarked on the huge task of recording over 500 Schubert songs. Three sets of these&#151;<span class="italic">Die sch&ouml;ne M&uuml;llerin</span>, <span class="italic">Winterreise</span>, and <span class="italic">Schwanengesang</span>, all with Fischer-Dieskau&#151;were issued on compact disc and form a lasting tribute to his work. His playing was remarkable for flawless technique and a rare ability to make the piano &#145;sing&#146;.<br>
<br>Moore was a talented writer. His best-known book was the autobiography <span class="italic">Am I Too Loud</span>? (1962). He became CBE (1954), honorary RAM (1962), FRCM (1980), honorary DLitt, Sussex (1968), and honorary MusD, Cambridge (1973).<br>
<br>Moore was a stocky, thickset figure not readily associable with the ravishingly delicate effects he could obtain from the piano. His zest for living, his enormous vitality, and his sense of humour were strong preservatives in a very hard-working life. Away from music Moore enjoyed in early life tennis and golf and, later, bridge, gardening, and watching cricket. He had an ideal partner in his wife, Enid Kathleen (<i>d</i>. 1994), daughter of Montague Richard, ironmonger, of Beckenham, whom he called &#145;the most perfect of all accompanists&#146;. They had no children. Moore had had a previous marriage, in Canada in 1929, which lasted only three or four years and which ended in divorce. Moore died in his sleep at his home, Pond House, Elm Road, Penn, Buckinghamshire, on 13 March 1987.<br>
