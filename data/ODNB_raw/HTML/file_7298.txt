<span class="headword">Davison,  Alexander</span>  (1750&#150;1829), <span class="occ">government contractor</span>, was born at Lanton near Wooler, Northumberland, on 2 April 1750, the third son of Alexander Davison, a farmer at Lanton, and Dorothy Neal of the next parish of Yeavering. As a young man he travelled to London, where he started work in the counting-house of Robert Hunter, but after several years in his service he was sent by Hunter to Canada. Together with his younger brother, George, he steadily built up his wealth as a merchant and shipowner in the Canada trade during the American War of Independence.<br>
<br>While in Quebec Davison joined the freemasons and was appointed to the legislative council, which was composed of crown nominees, one of whom was his brother George. The two brothers appear to have had the monopoly of the Canadian &#145;posts&#146; and were of considerable assistance to the governor, General Frederick Haldimand. It was Haldimand who recommended Alexander Davison to Evan Nepean, an under-secretary of state, as a man who could be useful to Pitt's government as a government contractor. After his return to Britain Davison settled in London and was commissioned in 1784 by the duke of Northumberland as a lieutenant in the Northumberland militia. On 18 February 1788 Davison married Harriett (1770&#150;1826), daughter of John Gosling, banker, of Lincoln's Inn Fields, London. They had six children: three sons and three daughters. The eldest two were twin boys born on 19 December 1788: Major-General Hugh Percy Davison (1788&#150;1849), who was named after the duke of Northumberland and who served in the 18th hussars, and Lieutenant-Colonel Sir William Davison (1788&#150;1873), who served in the Northumberland militia, the 2nd or Queen's Royal regiment and, unattached, in the Hanoverian army. For many years Sir William was aide-de-camp and equerry to the first duke of Cambridge, when he was viceroy of Hanover. A daughter, Harriett, died in infancy on 9 April 1796, as did another son (<i>d</i>. 2 November 1806), who had been baptized Alexander Horatio Nelson Davison in honour of his godfather, the great admiral.<h2>
<a name="GovernmentcontractorandfriendofNelson"></a>Government contractor and friend of Nelson</h2>For more than twenty years, from 1784, Davison worked for the government in providing army uniforms, weapons, transports, and general supplies. He supplied both the earl of Moira's expedition to support the French loyalists in western France in 1793 and the duke of York's army in Flanders in 1793&#150;4. He also acted as commissary-general to the army at Southampton and the Isle of Wight for two years, supplied large orders for the government of Portugal, and acted as supply agent for all the marines in Britain. By the 1790s he had built up a very successful and wide-ranging business in London as a merchant, government contractor, and prize agent. He later also joined a banking house. He was soon very well connected with leading political figures and his government contacts enabled him to build up a lucrative business. The profits from this helped him to buy a substantial house in St James's Square, London, where he regularly entertained Horatio Nelson and other notable figures of the day, including the prince of Wales, the duke of Clarence, William Pitt, and various cabinet ministers and admirals. He was soon wealthy enough to purchase, in 1795, Swarland Hall and Park, 7 miles south-west of Alnwick in Northumberland. Over the next decade or so he spent a fortune improving the house and grounds, and buying adjacent land. He also built up a superb collection of paintings on English historical subjects by British artists, as well as fine collections of plate, porcelain, jewels, and books. He regularly lent money to his friends and numerous contacts, no doubt increasing thereby his influence in government and naval circles.<br>
<br>Davison first met Nelson at Quebec in 1782, when Nelson was captain of the frigate <i>Albemarle</i>. According to Robert Southey he was instrumental in saving Nelson from a rash and imprudent marriage to the sixteen-year-old daughter of the provost-marshal of the garrison. Although irritated by his interference at the time, Nelson later established a close relationship with Davison, who acted as his financial adviser as well as confidant, and they corresponded regularly thereafter until very shortly before Nelson's death. Davison became prize agent for Nelson and his whole fleet after the battle of the Nile in 1798, which he commemorated by spending about &pound;2000 to pay for medals for all those who participated in this great victory. When Napoleon threatened to invade in 1803&#150;4 Davison established a volunteer corps, the Loyal Britons, at a cost of nearly &pound;3000; he served as its lieutenant-colonel. A correspondent of both Nelson's wife and his mistress, Davison was a leading mourner at Nelson's funeral and he repaid the admiral's friendship by giving financial assistance to Emma Hamilton after Nelson's death. To commemorate their friendship he erected an impressive obelisk on his estate at Swarland Park, beside the road from Morpeth to Alnwick.<h2>
<a name="Suppliertothebarrackoffice"></a>Supplier to the barrack office</h2>Late in December 1794 Lieutenant-General Oliver De Lancey, barrack-master-general, approached Davison to offer him a virtual monopoly to supply all new barracks with both a wide range of supplies (including beds, bedding, utensils, and candles) as well as a separate contract to supply them with coal. After securing a commission of two and a half per cent on all his costs, Davison agreed to what proved to be his most lucrative contract. In the absence of a detailed agreement with De Lancey, Davison took advantage of the public purse by supplying poor quality goods and charging inflated prices. After agreeing a separate contract with De Lancey in April 1795 to supply coal, Davison provided coal in winter, when it was more expensive, despite having bought it at the cheaper summer rates, and under-supplied the weight of coal paid for, by weighing the coal when wet, and therefore heavier. Furthermore he charged the Treasury in advance far in excess of the goods he supplied in the succeeding six months when he submitted his half-yearly accounts. As a result he had very large sums of public money in hand which he could use and invest to his own advantage. Given that Davison was paid over &pound;1 million in cash, and provided accounts for provisions much less than this, it is hardly surprising that the commissioners of inquiry in 1807 calculated that he had built up a fortune at the expense of the public purse and that the barrack office really ought to have procured its supplies by competitive bidding and open contracts as was the case in other public departments.<br>
<br>The government did not become suspicious of Davison's business practices until his enemies, including commercial and political rivals, began to raise complaints against him. It may have been his ill-judged attempt to enter parliament that led to a more serious examination of his business activities. In 1802 Davison was persuaded that he might be able purchase a parliamentary seat at Ilchester in Somerset. He was encouraged to build properties (known as &#145;Davison's Folly&#146;), which would confer the vote on the householders put in them, and to offer to pay &pound;30 per vote to all those electors who would support his candidacy. His willingness to use bribery and corruption to win the election became so notorious that Sir William Manners, who hoped to gain control of the borough himself, warned him that his conduct would lead him into serious trouble. Davison withdrew from the contest well before the poll, but two other candidates (also rich London merchants) employed agents using similar practices in order to corrupt the voters. When Manners and his ally, James Graham, petitioned against these two candidates who had been returned for the borough, a parliamentary committee of inquiry eventually concluded, in March 1803, that Davison and the two parliamentary agents working for the successful candidates had been involved in corrupting the voters at Ilchester and ought to be prosecuted. Although some leading MPs, including Richard Brinsley Sheridan, tried to save Davison from prosecution, he was arraigned at Taunton in April 1804, convicted and imprisoned for a year in the Marshalsea prison.<h2>
<a name="Mountingaccusationsoffraud"></a>Mounting accusations of fraud</h2>In 1802 the secretary at war was first alerted by another merchant that Davison might be defrauding the barrack office. Although a strict inquiry was not made for some time, the government put the management of barrack supplies under the commissary-general. In May 1803, after Davison had been criticized by parliament for his electoral malpractices, George III refused to let him stand proxy for Lord Nelson at his installation as a knight of the Bath. In November and December 1805 two correspondents to <span class="italic">The Times</span>&#151;Aristides and Verax&#151;urged an inquiry into what funds Davison had collected from the public to erect a monument to the nation's naval heroes and to what use he had put these unused funds. Davison was forced to defend himself in a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> on 22 January 1806, in which he claimed that not enough money had yet been subscribed to build the proposed naval pillar and what had been collected had been invested at interest. This dispute may have led him to build the obelisk to Nelson on his own estate.<br>
<br>When General De Lancey retired as barrack-master-general in November 1804 it soon became obvious that the financial accounts of the barrack office were in a very confused state and a commission of military inquiry was appointed by act of parliament in 1805  (45 Geo. III, c. 47). Davison was called upon to give evidence before it in December 1805 and May and June 1806. The commissioners concluded quite early that &#145;it was impossible for us to ascertain the loss to the public, or the gain to Mr Davison, through the improvidence of the late Barrack Master General in the bargain made with him, and the inattention of the Barrack Office&#146;  (&#145;Commissioners of military enquiry&#146;, 2.224). Nevertheless on 19 May 1806 the attorney- and solicitor-general agreed that Davison ought to be charged with fraud over the supply of coal to the barracks  (ibid., 2.297). In that month Davison repaid the government &pound;6047 17<i>s</i>. 11<i>d</i>. because he admitted he had received more money than he was owed; but no criminal proceedings were taken against him for many months. His career was not immediately ruined since the &#145;ministry of all the talents&#146; appointed him to serve as treasurer of the ordnance in 1806&#150;7. He sought to defend himself by bringing out a pamphlet, <span class="italic">A Reply to the Committee of Military Enquiry Respecting Barrack Supplies</span> (1807).<br>
<br>Early in 1807 Lord Archibald Hamilton MP, a vigorous opponent of corruption, urged the House of Commons to press the attorney-general to prosecute Davison, but Lord Henry Petty, the chancellor of the exchequer, persuaded him to withdraw the motion so that the Treasury could be given a chance to recover money from Davison. At the end of 1807 <span class="italic">The Times</span> expressed surprise that Davison had still not been brought to justice as a &#145;notorious peculator&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 Dec 1807) and suggested that he was being protected by friends in high places. It pointed out that he had recently left London for Yarmouth in the company of Sir Home Popham, a naval officer who had himself recently faced a parliamentary inquiry and a court martial. Six months later Lord Archibald Hamilton again asked Spencer Perceval, chancellor of the exchequer, why, so long after parliament had received such a damaging report on Davison's activities, he had still not been prosecuted, yet received the same explanation as before.<h2>
<a name="Downfallandfinalyears"></a>Downfall, and final years</h2>Davison may well have been trying to negotiate a financial settlement with the Treasury yet, once General De Lancey was fit enough to attend the trial as a key witness, Davison was finally brought to trial at the court of king's bench, before Lord Ellenborough and a special jury, on 7 December 1808. He was charged with falsifying his vouchers and receipts between 1798 and 1802, and thereby implying that two men who were working in his own warehouse were independent merchants. This allowed him to supply the barracks with goods from his own army clothing warehouse in Bedford Street, while still receiving a commission of two and a half per cent. His defence argued that he did nothing that had not been agreed in advance with De Lancey, though the latter denied all knowledge of a commission being agreed on goods supplied directly by Davison, rather than being purchased from other merchants. His defence also argued that he had abandoned the claim for commission once he realized he was not entitled to receive it. Lord Moira, Evan Nepean, the earl of Chatham, William Huskisson, and others testified to Davison's probity and public spirit over many years, but he was still found guilty on 6 February 1809. On 27 April he was ordered to pay &pound;18,883 13<i>s</i>. 1<i>d</i>. commission back to the exchequer and was sentenced to twenty-one months' imprisonment in Newgate.<br>
<br>This conviction ruined Davison's career as a government contractor and his finances were seriously embarrassed for a time as he disputed with the government over his accounts. He claimed that the government owed him over &pound;17,000, but the Treasury counter-claimed in February 1814 with a demand for two sums totalling just over &pound;65,000. Not until 25 November 1826 was this amount finally reduced on appeal and Davison paid up and was finally discharged from responsibility for any further payments. While in prison in November 1810, he mortgaged Swarland Hall to the duke of Northumberland for &pound;25,000; he redeemed it on 13 January 1811. He remained a wealthy man for some years, however, though no doubt to meet his debts to the Treasury he sold his house in St James's Square and his plate, porcelain, gems, and books by auction in 1817 and his splendid collection of British paintings by auction in 1823. When he died &#145;after a short illness&#146; in fashionable Regency Square, Brighton, on 10 December 1829, in his eightieth year, he still owned his Northumberland estate  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12 Dec 1812). His extensive will made substantial bequests, and included gifts given to him by Nelson. He was buried in the same massive vault as his wife in St Gregory's churchyard at Kirknewton, Northumberland, within a mile or so of where he had been born. His son William later raised an obelisk to his memory on a hill overlooking the church.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Davison was a man of great energy, efficiency, and ambition. He clearly had a good head for business, a great capacity for making friends and for building up business and government contacts, and a love for the good life that great wealth could buy. He was loyal to and financially supportive of his friends and allies, and they clearly regarded him as a man of probity, but his business success undoubtedly alienated rival merchants and aroused the hostility of the press. He was probably fraudulent in his dealings with the barrack office, though he made very little money from the particular offences for which he was convicted in 1809 and undoubtedly profited much more from other aspects of his decade-long and loosely drawn contract to supply the army's barracks with coal and a wide range of other goods. He may not have been any more guilty of robbing the public purse than many other government contractors of the day, but at a time when the public was alarmed by military setbacks and shocked by the revelations of corruption in high places he suffered the penalty when his actions came to the attention of a rattled government and parliament, and an aroused press. Davison is probably the original model for Alexander Willemott, an army contractor, in Captain Frederick Marryat's <span class="italic">The Way to be Happy</span> (1837).<br>
