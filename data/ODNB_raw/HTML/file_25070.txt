<span class="headword">Sempill,  Francis, of Beltrees</span>  (<em>c.</em>1617&#150;1682), <span class="occ">poet and wit</span>, the son of Robert Sempill of Beltrees, Lochwinnoch, Renfrewshire, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Sir Thomas Lyon of Auldbar, was the descendant of a family closely connected with the Stuart kings and with letters. He married his cousin Jean Campbell of Ardkinglas at Lochgoilhead, Argyll, on 3 April 1655, and succeeded his father at some time between 1660 (when Robert witnessed a baptism) and 1669, when Francis is found acting as laird of Beltrees. In 1677 he was appointed sheriff-depute of Renfrewshire, from which it may be deduced that, like his father, he had studied law. In the course of his duties he arrested a Walter Scott, &#145;a noted leader of conventicles and such-like disorders&#146;  (Wodrow, 2, appx, 8), and in the ensuing tumult was seriously wounded.<br>
<br>Francis is believed to have inherited the Beltrees estate embarrassed, as a result of his father's participation in the civil war. In keeping with the family motto, &#145;In loyaltie&#146;, he supported the Stuarts enthusiastically but was increasingly forced to alienate land, his financial problems having been (in his own view) exacerbated by the indemnity granted to the whig rebels after the Bothwell Bridge rising (1679), which prevented him from being compensated for his part in suppressing the revolt. By 1678 the superiority of Beltrees was sold to Thomas Crawfurd of Cartsburn, and in 1680 Sempill and his wife resigned their liferent of the remaining lands of Thridpairt to their son Robert, who undertook to pay his father's debts of 800 merks and &pound;800 Scots. This presumably cleared the embarrassments which had forced Francis to take refuge in the debtors' sanctuary of the palace of Holyrood, Edinburgh, whence he was rescued in 1680 by James, duke of Albany (later James VII and II), an episode celebrated in &#145;The Banishment of Poverty&#146; (1680).<br>
<br>Sempill's poems were not (as far as is known) published in his own lifetime, and most of those attributed to him appeared first as anonymous broadsheets. Family tradition credits him with an early talent for improvisation. Motherwell, in his introduction to <span class="italic">The Harp of Renfrewshire</span> (1819), writes, &#145;It is to be regretted that the manuscripts of Francis Sempill are irretrievably lost. They fell into hands which knew not their value, and it is to be feared out of them they will never be recovered&#146;  (Motherwell, xx). Some loose sheets containing poems attributed to him were given to James Paterson, editor of <span class="italic">The Poems of the Sempills of Beltrees</span> (1849), by H. G. Gardner, a descendant of the Beltrees family: it is presumably on the authority of these that Paterson ascribed to him &#145;The Blythsome Wedding&#146; (also claimed on poor evidence for Sir William Scott of Thirlestane), &#145;A Discourse between Law and Conscience&#146;, an early version of &#145;Auld Lang Syne&#146;, &#145;She Raise and Loot Me In&#146; (also attributed to Thomas D'Urfey), and &#145;Maggie Lauder&#146;, among others.<br>
<br>James Johnson attributed the dissemination of Sempill's ballads in England to his friendship with one of Cromwell's officers in Glasgow, but the story, though charming, is unnecessary. Sempill, like other poets of his time, was writing in a pan-British culture in which songs and their settings moved easily across the border in both directions (it is noticeable that &#145;The Banishment of Poverty&#146;, probably the only poem of which his authorship has not been challenged, is set to an English tune, &#145;The Last Good Night&#146;). The poems ascribed to him give evidence of wit, lightness of touch, and sense of rhythm.<br>
<br>Sempill died suddenly in his house in Paisley on 12 March 1682. The only physical description we have of him is his reference in &#145;July the Nine-and-Twenty Day&#146; to his own &#145;glied eye and crooked snout&#146;.<br>
