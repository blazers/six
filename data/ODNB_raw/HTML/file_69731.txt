<span class="headword">Nowell,  Laurence</span>  (1530&#150;<em>c.</em>1570), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was the second son of Alexander Nowell of Read Hall, Whalley, Lancashire, and Grace, daughter of Rafe Catherall of Mitton in the same county. About 1540 his family moved to Woolden Manor, Eccles, near Manchester. By 1550 he had matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, where in April he was elected to the second rank of philosophers, and by October had become lector in mathematics. He graduated BA in 1552, and his name appears in the buttery books as late as December 1554. While at Oxford, he apparently had a dispute with Francis Alford, also of Christ Church, that may have led him to depart for Paris in late 1553. After visiting Rouen, Antwerp, and Louvain, he returned to Oxford but soon set out for Paris via Dieppe. He then journeyed to Geneva to become tutor of two of the sons of Sir James Harington of Exton, Rutland, and in 1557&#150;8 went from Venice to Padua and Rome. Although these visits coincided with Queen Mary's reign, Nowell was neither a religious refugee nor an ordained churchman like his cousin and namesake the future dean of Lichfield<a href="#cosubject_20380"> [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>Shortly after Queen Elizabeth's accession, Nowell returned home and represented Knaresborough, Yorkshire, in her first parliament that sat from 25 January until 8 May 1559. He may have owed his seat to the patronage of Sir Ambrose Cave, chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. Before the session ended he went into Wiltshire, probably with William Lambarde. If so, it was his earliest known association with this friend who shared his scholarly interest in Old English. Nowell continued exploring the realm, visiting Kent, Chichester, the Isle of Wight, and Northampton. His travels were interrupted by an illness in late 1559, but in 1560 he visited his family in Lancashire and then sailed to Ireland. During his journeys, he kept a commonplace book (University of California at Los Angeles, special collections 170/529) in which he made notes principally from classical works. It was probably not until 1561 that he began to study Anglo-Saxon, which he learned by using as cribs the Latin equivalents of the Old English Bede, the Old English Orosius, the Anglo-Saxon laws, and Aelfric's <span class="italic">Grammar and Glossary</span>, all of which he was in part at least to transcribe or translate. By early 1563 at the latest he was residing at Sir William Cecil's house in the Strand, London, where he made a transcription (BL, Add. MS 43703) of several Anglo-Saxon texts, including the Old English Bede and the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>. He also owned what is now BL, Cotton MS Vitellius A.xv in the British Library, the collection of Anglo-Saxon writings sometimes known as the Nowell codex, which contains the only surviving text of <span class="italic">Beowulf</span>.<br>
<br>Thomas Randolph had recommended Nowell as a scholar and cartographer to Cecil, who by June 1563 appointed Nowell as the tutor of his ward and future son-in-law, Edward de Vere, seventeenth earl of Oxford. About that time, having requested employment as Cecil's map maker in a Latin letter, Nowell produced for him a pocket map of the British Isles (BL, Add. MS 62540) on which he sketched images of himself and of Cecil. His other maps, except for four lost after Lambarde presented them to Nowell's friend Adrian Stokes in 1574, are at the British Library (Cotton MS Domitian xviii).<br>
<br>On or about 25 March 1567, having named Lambarde as one of the executors of his last will and testament, Nowell departed for the continent in order to become more fluent in foreign languages and to pursue other studies. While at the University of Paris, he forwarded to Lambarde a transcript of the <span class="italic">Gesta Normannorum ducum</span> of William of Jumi&egrave;ges (University of Virginia, MS Hench 6435a, 4). His friend Daniel Rogers, whom he met in Paris at this time, addressed three poems to him (Hunt., MS HM 31188), one of them dated in July 1569. Nowell moved on to Venice and Padua and then enrolled at the University of Vienna. Next he travelled to Basel and was at Leipzig by August 1569. The last record of his whereabouts is his October matriculation at the University of Freiburg im Breisgau. That same year his cousin Robert Nowell of Gray's Inn bequeathed to him a &pound;5 annuity and some satin cloth. In 1571, having had no message from him for two years, his brothers Charles, John, and Thomas, and seven others petitioned the court of requests to declare Nowell dead and to order Lambarde to release their inheritances. Lambarde reluctantly granted their petition but retained the library Nowell had left in his custody, not only making full use of his manuscripts and books in his own writings but also sharing them with friends. Over the centuries this collection has been widely scattered, especially after the final dispersal of the Lambarde library in 1924.<br>
<br>Nowell's greatest legacy is the <span class="italic">Vocabularium Saxonicum</span>, used by generations of lexicographers in manuscript until it was printed as recently as 1952. Although he was familiar with more than half the extant corpus of Old English poetry, his major interest was texts with obvious historical or topographical content, particularly Anglo-Saxon laws. He made the first critical edition of Alfred's laws along with a modern English translation (BL, Henry Davis collection, MS 59 [M 30]), which was used by Lambarde for his <span class="italic">Archaionomia</span> (1568). He studied other early laws including the code known as Cnut I&#150;II (Canterbury Cathedral, MS Lit. E 2). No complete inventory of his transcripts and manuscripts can be compiled since discoveries continue to be made. Some of the other most important ones can be found in the libraries of Canterbury Cathedral, Glasgow University, Lambeth Palace, Westminster Abbey, and the Bodleian, Oxford. Although he is best known for his pioneering work in Anglo-Saxon studies, his journeys abroad point to a deep interest in learning about the past that extended well beyond the history of England.<br>
<br>Until recently, Laurence Nowell the antiquary has been confused with <a name="cosubject_20380"></a><span class="headword">Laurence Nowell</span>  (<em>c.</em>1516&#150;1576), who became <span class="occ">dean of Lichfield</span>, and who had the same paternal grandparents. The latter Laurence Nowell was the third son of John Nowell (<i>d</i>. 1526) of Read Hall, Whalley, Lancashire, and his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Kay of Rochdale. After entering Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1536, he migrated to Cambridge University to study logic, graduating BA in 1542. Oxford incorporated this BA and awarded him an MA in 1544. Two years later he became master of the grammar school at Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire. In 1550 the town's corporation, as the school's patrons, charged him in chancery with neglect of duty, but he appealed to the privy council, which issued an order forbidding the warden and fellowship of Sutton to remove him from office. In November 1550 Nicholas Ridley, bishop of London, ordained him deacon. Upon Queen Mary's accession he took shelter with Sir John Perrot in Pembrokeshire and later joined his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20378/', "Alexander Nowell")</script> on the continent, though it is not known where Laurence finally took refuge. In 1558, when he returned home, he was promoted archdeacon of Derby, and in 1560 dean of Lichfield. In the convocation of 1563 he voted with Alexander, now dean of St Paul's, to modify church ceremonies. That year he obtained the prebend of Ferring in Chichester Cathedral and the rectories of Haughton and Drayton Basset in Staffordshire. In 1566 he received a prebend in York Minster, and in 1567 pleaded with Archbishop Matthew Parker on behalf of two nonconformists.<br>
<br>Nowell married Mary Glover, a widow with two sons, and between 1567 and 1574 they had four daughters and five sons, including his namesake heir who matriculated at Brasenose College in 1590. With Alexander, Laurence served as executor of their brother Robert's will in 1569. The next year, he denied the charge of Peter Morwent, a prebendary of Lichfield, that he had made seditious speeches against Queen Elizabeth and Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester. In 1575 he bought an estate in Sheldon and some lands in Coleshill, Warwickshire. In his will, dated 17 October 1576, he named Alexander and his half-brother John Towneley his overseers. He was dead by 22 November, when his successor as dean, George Boleyn, was installed. He was probably buried at Weston, Derbyshire.<br>
