<span class="headword">Collier,  John Gordon</span>  (1935&#150;1995), <span class="occ">chemical engineer</span>, was born on 22 January 1935 at 84 Thrale Road, Streatham, London, the only child of John (Jack) Collier, a professional double bass player, and his wife, Edith Georgina de Ville (<i>d</i>. 1948). The Second World War disrupted Collier's education and family life; he moved many times, and the family was reunited only after the war. He gained his O-levels at St Paul's School in 1951 and then joined the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, a part of the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), as a student apprentice. He achieved his A-levels by part-time study at Oxford Technical College and gained an award to study at University College, London. There he obtained a first-class honours degree in chemical engineering in 1956, before returning to Harwell. This apprenticeship among the &#145;other ranks&#146; served Collier well and resulted in his easy relationships with people at all levels. On 18 August 1956 he married Ellen Alice Mary (1935&#150;1998), a secretary at Harwell and daughter of David Frank Mitchell, a laboratory assistant. They were a happy couple; Ellen was highly supportive and an able aide. Collier was proud of his family and the achievements of their children, Clare and John Douglas, who both enjoyed successful careers.<br>
<br>Collier's service with UKAEA was broken by several periods elsewhere, which were formative in his development and gave him a breadth of experience that greatly contributed to his later success. From 1962 to 1964 he worked with Atomic Energy of Canada at Chalk River, and then returned to Britain to join Atomic Power Constructions Ltd in 1966. Back with UKAEA, he became head of its chemical engineering division in 1975, and director of its safety and reliability division (1982&#150;3). After three years as director-general of the Central Electricity Generating Board, he returned to UKAEA as deputy chairman in 1986 and chairman the following year.<br>
<br>There was a marked transition in Collier's work from the early 1970s, when he collaborated with Walter Marshall, former director at Harwell. Their projects included the two Marshall study group reports on the structural integrity of the light water reactor pressure vessel, which challenged a current view on the safety of pressure vessels and largely contributed to the eventual acceptance of the pressurized water reactor design in the United Kingdom. Collier and Marshall also worked on the International Atomic Energy Agency's international nuclear fuel cycle evaluation programme and on the pressurized water reactor task force, chaired by Marshall, a body that integrated the efforts of a large number of relevant UK organizations to introduce the pressurized water reactor into the UK. Collier became a member, then head, of the atomic energy technical unit, known familiarly as &#145;Walter's think-tank&#146;.<br>
<br>Collier was the first chairman of Nuclear Electric plc, set up in 1990 to operate the nuclear power stations in England and Wales. He was at this time chairman of UKAEA and relinquished this post with some reluctance because he felt able to cope with both jobs. The achievement of the key targets he set for the new company caused a turnaround in performance and established the base for the eventual privatization of its nuclear power stations. Success in meeting these targets, and in setting nuclear power in the United Kingdom on its new path, was Collier's great lifetime achievement.<br>
<br>Collier was a giant of a man, both physically and intellectually. Unpretentious in manner, he was capable of intense concentration and had a memory to match, backed up by a large filing system. He could digest a large amount of information and then reorganize it in simpler but understandable form. He wrote many books and papers and was an excellent reviewer. His <span class="italic">Convective Boiling and Condensation</span> (1972) became a standard reference work for engineers. As a natural communicator he was in demand as a speaker and made many presentations to various audiences. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1988, and a fellow of the Royal Society in 1990, was made an honorary DS of Cranfield University in 1988, and an honorary DEng of Bristol University in 1993, the year in which he was also president of the Institution of Chemical Engineers.<br>
<br>In addition to his great love of cricket&#151;his exuberant youthful bowling having struck terror into the batsmen who faced him&#151;Collier was an enthusiastic supporter of most sports, and had a deep appreciation of music and painting. These interests were reflected in the wide range of support given by Nuclear Electric plc to many individuals, organizations, and events in these fields. He was particularly pleased when the derelict Bankside power station, which Nuclear Electric had inherited from the former Central Electricity Generating Board, was taken over by the Tate Gallery. He died at his home, Field House, Longridge, Sheepscombe, Gloucestershire, on 18 November 1995.<br>
