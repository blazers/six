<span class="headword">Marshall,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1762, <em>d.</em> 1825), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and poet</span>, was baptized in All Saints' Church, Newcastle upon Tyne, on 11 March 1762, the only child of John Marshall (<i>d</i>. 1780), master mariner, and his wife, Eleanor Pembroke (<i>d</i>. 1777). He was educated at the Newcastle Free School, where he received a classical education under the guidance of the Revd Hugh Moises. His father, who was a member of the Guild of Trinity House, died in January 1780 and was buried next to his wife in St Nicholas's Church, Newcastle. He left his son substantial wealth, for he had owned property in Newcastle as well as ships and shares in ships. This wealth soon dissipated and Marshall lost what he referred to in his poem &#145;The Village Pedagogue&#146; as &#145;his summer friends&#146;. He was admitted into the Guild of the Freemen of Newcastle as master and mariner in 1782, probably through patrimony. He pursued a life at sea for a time but by 1804 he was again searching for work.<br>
<br>In his autobiographical work &#145;A walk from Newcastle to Keswick&#146;, Marshall described how he left Newcastle on a &#145;fine morning&#146; in August 1804 to walk towards Cumberland. Following a recommendation from his only acquaintance in Cumberland, Mr Crossthwaite, proprietor of the Museum of Natural and Artificial Curiosities in Keswick, who had formerly commanded a ship in the service of the East India Company, Marshall was appointed teacher at the vestry school in Newlands, near Keswick. He commenced teaching on 13 August 1804 at a salary of &pound;10 per year and then in 1805 he became schoolteacher at Loweswater with an increased salary of &pound;15 per year. It is not known how long he remained there, but in November 1807 he was teaching at Murton School, North Shields.<br>
<br>It was in 1810 that Marshall published the first edition of <span class="italic">&#145;The Village Pedagogue&#146;, a Poem, and Lesser Works</span>, his only published work. His poetry demonstrated his erudition and intimate knowledge of classical literature nurtured during his formative years, while his autobiographical prose piece &#145;A walk from Newcastle to Keswick&#146; showed his love of lakeland scenery and his bonhomie. Of his lesser works, &#145;On viewing Percy Main colliery, Westoe, and Jarrow from the heights near Howdon on the River Tyne&#146; gives a fascinating glimpse of Tyneside before heavy industrialization. By 1817 Marshall was running a school at Newburn, Newcastle. It was also in this year that the second edition of his works was published with a few amendments from the first edition. By 1819 his teaching career was over and on 23 December 1819 he was appointed to one of the lesser rooms of the Peace and Unity Hospital in Newcastle. This hospital together with the Freemen's Hospital had been established to care for impoverished freemen and their dependants. He went to the Freemen's Hospital on 22 January 1821 and died there, unmarried, from a lingering illness on 19 August 1825. He was buried in All Saints' churchyard, Newcastle, on 21 August. Although he lost his family wealth and suffered hardship and poverty, Marshall was well thought of by his contemporaries. John Sykes, compiler of <span class="italic">Local Records</span>, collected together some of Marshall's autobiographical notes after his death and published them in the <span class="italic">Newcastle Magazine</span> as a tribute.<br>
