<span class="headword">Thomas <span class="st"> [Tumas]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em>1170&#150;1180), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was a Norman clerk, and author of a romance, <span class="italic">Tristan</span>, in which he names himself twice (as Thomas and Tumas) and whom his German imitator Gottfried von Strassburg (1210) calls &#145;Th&ocirc;mas von Britanje&#146;. His romance survives in the form of ten fragments, drawn from six manuscripts (M. Benskin discovered an important fragment in Carlisle in 1994), and is estimated to have comprised a little over 12,000 lines in all. Its contents can be largely reconstructed from the Norse translation, the <span class="italic">Tristrams Saga</span> (1226). Thomas was conscious of the co-existence of rival versions of the legend in the hands of a variety of story-tellers and rejected the idea of a total synthesis in favour of following his own course. This involved criticizing certain choices and showing confidence in the Welsh latimer and story-teller Breri (Bledhericus). Thomas makes powerful use of a training in dialectic and rhetoric and appears as a pessimistic, and frequently ironic, commentator on the vicissitudes of earthly love. His language is not markedly Anglo-Norman and it is likely that he settled in England from Normandy. His romance contains a eulogistic description of London. Thomas is certainly writing after Wace's <span class="italic">Brut</span> (1155) and, arguably, after Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes's <span class="italic">Clig&eacute;s</span> (probably dating to the 1170s or early 1180s). His frequently posited presence at the court of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine, particularly at the time of the estrangement and the revelation of Henry's adultery with Rosamund Clifford, must remain mere supposition. At all events, Thomas's <span class="italic">Tristan</span> cannot convincingly be read as an endorsement of <i>fin' amor</i>.<br>
<br>The <a name="cosubject_54065"></a><span class="headword">Thomas</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1170), <span class="occ">poet</span>, who, as &#145;mestre Thomas&#146;, wrote the romance of <span class="italic">Horn</span> has, since S&ouml;derhjelm's demonstration in 1886, been distinguished from the author of <span class="italic">Tristan</span>. It is true that he, too, is sophisticated and erudite, had an excellent clerkly training, shares many clerical prejudices, displays Latin influence, maintains a generally aristocratic tone, and is particularly sympathetic to music (he seems to have been an excellent harpist). At the end of the <span class="italic">Horn</span>, which is itself apparently a sequel to an earlier work on Aalof (Horn's father), Thomas leaves to his son Wilmot (Gilemot), who is presented as an excellent young poet, the task of composing a work on Hadermod (Horn's son). This suggests a date at the end of his professional career which might be put at <i>c</i>.1170. The linguistic evidence suggests that Thomas was an immigrant to England. Anglo-Norman features of his language are relatively slight and there are clear signs of south-western origin, suggesting that he or his parents originated in the Loire valley. He may have studied at Poitiers. He has some knowledge of English, and seems to know Brittany and Dublin. The <span class="italic">Horn</span> is filled with the spirit of the crusades and of the <i>chanson de geste</i> and is written in rhymed <i>laisses</i> of alexandrines.<br>
