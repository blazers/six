</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bishop, Sir  Henry Rowley</span>  (1786&#150;1855), <span class="occ">composer</span>, the son of Samuel Bishop, a watchmaker and later haberdasher, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wigley, was born at 83 Great Portland Street, London, on 18 November 1786. His early education was at Dr Barrow's academy at 8 Soho Square. By the time he was thirteen he was working with his cousin Charles Wigley as a music-seller at 6 Spring Gardens, Charing Cross. His first publications, songs and piano pieces, were issued by this firm in the years 1800 to 1803. When he was about sixteen it was decided that he should go to Newmarket to train as a jockey, but his patron, the racehorse owner Thomas Panton, considered him better suited to the study of music and paid for a course of instruction with the successful opera composer and theoretician Francesco Bianchi. At the same time Bishop continued to compose, and his first stage work, <span class="italic">Angelina</span>, written in collaboration with Gesualdo Lanza, was performed at the Theatre Royal, Margate, on 30 August 1804. This was followed by music for a number of ballets at the King's Theatre and Drury Lane. Of these, <span class="italic">Tamerlan et Bajazet</span>, given at the King's Theatre in 1806, was so successful that Bishop obtained a permanent engagement and began to produce the adaptations, compilations, and occasional pieces that were to occupy him constantly for the next thirty years. At this period he also produced a few instrumental compositions, including the first movement of a symphony (1805) and a concertante for flute, oboe, bassoon, violin, and double bass (1807). His great success of these years, however, was his first full-length opera, <span class="italic">The Circassian Bride</span>, which was very well received at its premi&egrave;re at Drury Lane on 23 February 1809; but the following night the theatre burnt down and the score was destroyed. Nevertheless, Bishop quickly rewrote portions of it for publication as &#145;Overture, Songs, and Duets&#146;. Just over a month after the opening of <span class="italic">The Circassian Bride</span>, on 30 April 1809, he married one of the cast, Elizabeth Sarah Lyon (1787&#150;1831), with whom he had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>After a short period attempting to establish a teaching practice in Bedford the Bishops returned to London for the production at the Lyceum Theatre on 13 March 1810 of Bishop's second three-act opera, <span class="italic">The Maniac, or, The Swiss Banditti</span>, to a libretto by Samuel J. Arnold, in which Elizabeth Bishop sang a leading role. The opera's successful run of twenty-six performances secured Bishop the offer of a three-year engagement as composer and music director at Covent Garden. During the next three seasons, beginning with <span class="italic">The Knight of Snowdoun</span>, a three-act musical drama based on Scott's <span class="italic">The Lady of the Lake</span>, on 5 February 1811, he contributed or arranged varying quantities of music for a host of productions, ranging from burletta to &#145;operatic drama&#146;. His compositions and arrangements were highly successful with the public and many of them enjoyed wide currency outside the theatre in publications that were issued immediately after the works had been staged. At the expiration of his initial contract Bishop's engagement was renewed for a further five years, and he continued his routine of providing whatever music was required for the theatre's productions. Among his successes at that time was his contribution to Pocock's <span class="italic">The Miller and his Men</span>, first performed on 21 October 1813 and revived with additions the following year, and the nine numbers he wrote for the same author's <span class="italic">For England, Ho!</span>, produced on 15 December 1813. During this five-year period Bishop composed or contributed to the music of some forty productions, including incidental music for <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>, the first of a series of Shakespeare adaptations with which he was involved. Individual numbers from these works, such as the glees &#145;Our Ship in Port&#146; (<span class="italic">For England, Ho!</span>) and &#145;The Chough and Crow&#146; (<span class="italic">Guy Mannering</span>, 11 March 1816), gained lasting popularity.<br>
<br>Despite his heavy commitment to Covent Garden, Bishop became a founder member of the Philharmonic Society in 1813, for which he composed and directed an overture in E at a concert on 26 May 1817. He also found time to compose a string quartet in 1816, though he did not publish it, and for George Thompson of Edinburgh he set Burns's <span class="italic">The Jolly Beggars</span> in 1817. His engagement at Covent Garden continued for another six years, during which he contributed to some thirty productions, beginning with very free adaptations of <span class="italic">The Barber of Seville</span> (combining Paisiello's and Rossini's music with his own) on 13 October 1818, and Mozart's <span class="italic">The Marriage of Figaro</span> on 6 March 1819. Bishop later claimed that it gave him pain to incorporate his own music into these pieces, &#145;which only the nature of my engagement with the theatre would have obliged me to do&#151;and that their having been inserted into Mozart's or Rossini's operas was contrary to my opinion and wholly against my will&#146;  (Northcott, 34). Among the plays for which he provided music were adaptations of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> and <span class="italic">The Comedy of Errors</span> (1819), <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> (1820), <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>, <span class="italic">Two Gentlemen of Verona</span>, and <span class="italic">2 Henry IV</span> (1821), and <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> (1824), as well as the usual mixture of other plays, occasional pieces, and operas. A three-act musical drama, <span class="italic">The Law of Java</span>, produced on 11 May 1822, contained a piece, &#145;Mynheer van Dunck&#146;, that became especially popular as a separate number (a particular favourite with W. E. Gladstone, who used to sing it at parties). But Bishop's most lasting success was the ballad &#145;Home, Sweet Home&#146;, from <span class="italic">Clari, or, The Maid of Milan</span>, given its premi&egrave;re on 8 May 1823; this piece was, according to the title-page of its first edition, &#145;composed and partly founded on a Sicilian air by Henry R. Bishop&#146;. It was made especially popular by Jenny Lind in the second half of the century and remains one of the best-known of nineteenth-century ballads.<br>
<br>In addition to his work at Covent Garden, Bishop was music director at the King's Theatre in 1816 and 1817, and in 1819 and 1820 he managed the so-called oratorios, a series of mixed concerts given in the opera houses during Lent, when the theatres were closed for stage productions. He made three visits to Paris in 1814, 1816, and 1822. From 20 January to 5 October 1820 he was in Dublin, directing performances at the Rotunda (Theatre Royal), and he was awarded the freedom of the Irish capital on 21 August. By the 1820s Bishop's music had become widely popular, and numbers from his stage works began to provide material for other musicians to compose variations, fantasias, and similar pieces; the indefatigable John Weippert based seven of his numerous sets of quadrilles on items from Bishop's celebrated operas during these years.<br>
<br>Bishop's employment at Covent Garden came to an end in 1824 after a dispute over his salary. In November 1824 his adaptation of Weber's <span class="italic">Der Freisch&uuml;tz</span> was given at Drury Lane, and he accepted R. W. Elliston's offer of an engagement there in the following year. His first major piece in the new house was a three-act opera, <span class="italic">The Fall of Algiers</span>, which was given its premi&egrave;re on 19 January 1825. This was followed during the rest of the year by a heterogeneous mixture of pieces, similar to those he had produced at Covent Garden: incidental music to two historical dramas, <span class="italic">Masaniello</span> and <span class="italic">William Tell</span> (foreshadowing Auber and Rossini respectively by several years), music for an English adaptation of Goethe's <span class="italic">Faust</span>, and a &#145;spectacle&#146; entitled <span class="italic">The Coronation of Charles X</span>. The news that Weber was writing an opera for Covent Garden, where he was to direct it himself in 1826, led the management of Drury Lane to commission Bishop to write a counter-attraction, <span class="italic">Aladdin</span>, a &#145;romantic fairy opera&#146;, which opened on 29 April, shortly after Weber's <span class="italic">Oberon</span>. Although Bishop took unusual care over its composition and attempted musically to meet his rival on his own ground, it did not seriously challenge Weber's opera. Further routine pieces followed before Bishop left his post at Drury Lane a couple of years later, but he continued to provide similar fare for the London stage for the next decade. From 1830 to 1833 he was music director at Vauxhall Gardens, for which he had earlier written his cantata <span class="italic">Waterloo</span> (1826). During this period he composed a number of short dramatic pieces, in conjunction with the librettist Fitzball, for performance at the gardens, beginning with the &#145;vaudeville opera&#146; <span class="italic">Under the Oak</span>, and the &#145;nautical burletta&#146; <span class="italic">Adelaida, or, The Royal William</span> in 1830, and concluding with the one-act operettas <span class="italic">The Magic Fan</span>, <span class="italic">The Bottle of Champagne</span>, and <span class="italic">The Sedan Chair</span> in 1832.<br>
<br>On 9 July 1831, shortly after the death of his first wife, Bishop married his former singing pupil Anna Riviere (1810&#150;1884) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2468/', "Bishop, Anna")</script>], with whom he had two daughters and a son. During the next few years they made several concert tours in the provinces, where Anna Bishop acquired a high reputation as a performer of sacred music and English song; they were accompanied on these tours by the harpist Nicholas Bochsa, with whom she absconded to Hamburg in 1839.<br>
<br>A departure from Bishop's usual activities was the composition of his sacred cantata <span class="italic">The Seventh Day</span>, commissioned and performed by the Philharmonic Society on 3 March 1834. In this work Bishop forsook his usually Italianate style for that of Spohr, whose <span class="italic">The Last Judgement</span> had just begun to captivate English musicians; but it was not a success. A &#145;scena&#146;, <span class="italic">The Departure from Paradise</span>, performed at the Philharmonic on 6 June 1836, was equally unsuccessful, notwithstanding its performance by the celebrated soprano Maria Malibran. A third sacred composition, <span class="italic">The Fallen Angel</span>, was performed as his exercise for the degree of BMus at Oxford on 10 June 1839, but it too failed to secure further performances. The texts of all three of these works were taken from Milton's <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>. During the 1830s Bishop's contributions to the London theatres declined in number, and they ceased altogether at about the time of the breakdown of his marriage. His last work for the theatre, written for Covent Garden, where he had been engaged by Lucia Vestris as music director for the 1840&#150;41 season, was the &#145;allegorical and national masque&#146; <span class="italic">The Fortunate Isles, or, The Triumphs of Britannia</span>, given on 12 February 1840 to celebrate Queen Victoria's marriage. Over a period of thirty-six years Bishop had composed, contributed to, or arranged around 130 stage works; selections from some 70 of them were published, and Frederick Corder calculated that these volumes contain 48 overtures, 190 airs and ballads, 53 display songs, 73 duets and trios, 150 glees and ensemble pieces, and 340 melodramas, marches, and ballet airs. In 1840 the composer published his collected glees, trios, quartets, quintets, and choruses in eight large volumes dedicated to the &#145;Glee and Choral Societies of Great Britain&#146;.<br>
<br>On 1 June 1842, at Prince Albert's suggestion, Bishop was knighted, and a fortnight later he was appointed a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. In November 1841 he had been elected to the Reid professorship of music at Edinburgh University, but he resigned the chair, after having given only two lectures, in December 1843. In 1842 he became permanent conductor of the Ancient Concerts, which he had conducted periodically since 1840, and for which he provided many arrangements and additional accompaniments (twenty volumes of which survive in the British Library); he retained this post until the series was discontinued in 1848. In that year he succeeded William Crotch as Heather professor of music at Oxford. His last substantial composition was an ode for the installation of the earl of Derby as chancellor of the university, in 1853, and on 22 June 1854 he became a Doctor of Music of the university. In connection with his Oxford appointment he wrote a <span class="italic">Syllabus of a Course of 6 Lectures on &hellip; Vocal Music &hellip; in the 17th and 18th Centuries</span>, published in 1848, and left a manuscript of &#145;Lectures on the history of music&#146;, written shortly afterwards. At this period he often lectured on music and was much involved in arranging and editing. He edited Handel's chamber duets and cantatas for the London Handel Society and collaborated with Charles Mackay on a series of English national songs.<br>
<br>During his last years Bishop was in poor health, and in March 1855 it was decided that an operation was required to ameliorate his condition. On 24 April he made his will, in which the value of his estate was given &#145;as not exceeding &pound;200&#146;. He died at his house at 13 Cambridge Street, Hyde Park, on Monday evening, 30 April 1855; a post-mortem certified that he died from &#145;cancer (scirrhus) of bladder and atrophy of kidney&#146;. He was buried on 5 May at Marylebone cemetery, Finchley Road, where a monument to his memory (with incorrect years of birth and death) was later erected by public subscription.<br>
