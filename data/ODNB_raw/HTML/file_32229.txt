<span class="headword">Byron,  Robert</span>  (1905&#150;1941), <span class="occ">traveller and writer on art</span>, was born at Wembley, London, on 26 February 1905, the only son among three children of Eric Byron, civil engineer, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of William Robinson, of Southall Manor, Middlesex. He was educated at Eton College and at Merton College, Oxford, where he obtained a third class in modern history in 1925. At Eton Byron was active in the Society of Arts, where, according to his contemporary Harold Acton, he &#145;distinguished himself for his provocative tirades&#146;  (Acton, 92). The pair did not get on at school but became friends at Oxford, where they discovered a shared taste for Victoriana. Believing that it was not necessary &#145;to be solemn in order to be serious&#146;, they made humour &#145;one of their symbols&#146;  (ibid., 119), and were originators of the social milieu captured by Evelyn Waugh in <span class="italic">Brideshead Revisited</span>. At one particularly uproarious fancy dress party, staged by the Hypocrites' Club, Byron &#145;gave a hectic impersonation of the Widow of Windsor&#146;. Few women were present on this occasion, which &#145;rumour transformed &hellip; into a shocking orgy&#146;  (ibid., 124). Soon afterwards the club was closed by the proctors.<br>
<br>Acton remembered being somewhat cowed by Byron's self-confidence at Oxford: &#145;He could not understand what prevented me from rushing into print when I expressed some casual opinion. He saw an article in everything&#146;  (Acton, 192). And Byron's first book emanated from his first travels, in 1925 to Greece, a country for which he had a passionate admiration and where, as a distant relative of Lord Byron, his name carried a particular resonance. <span class="italic">Europe in the Looking-Glass</span> (1926) was a high-spirited account of this undergraduate jaunt, and it was followed during the next four years by three ambitious studies in late Hellenism, of which <span class="italic">The Byzantine Achievement</span> (1929; repr. 1987) is the most satisfying.<br>
<br>In 1929 Byron travelled to India as special correspondent for the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, and in the next year made a brief journey into Tibet. The first literary result of these experiences was <span class="italic">An Essay on India</span> (1931) which, in the opinion of the viceroy, Lord Willingdon, contained the best brief statement of Indian political problems at that time. His Tibetan journey was recorded two years later in <span class="italic">First Russia, then Tibet</span>. A period of journalism in London was followed by a visit to Persia and Afghanistan during 1933 and 1934, an adventure which promoted the best of his books, <span class="italic">The Road to Oxiana</span> (1937). This may be described as an enquiry into the origins of Islamic art presented in the form of one of the most entertaining travel books of modern times. He wrote it in China during 1935 and 1936 after making the overland journey to the Far East through Russia. <span class="italic">The Road to Oxiana</span> was reprinted in 1981 with an introduction by Bruce Chatwin. Chatwin considered it &#145;a work of genius&#146; which he personally elevated &#145;to the status of &#147;sacred text&#148;&#146;  (Chatwin, ix). But it was also an important book. In between the &#145;bravura passages&#146;  (ibid., xvi) Byron was expounding a serious thesis about the significance of Afghan influence on Persian civilization.<br>
<br>In 1936 Byron settled in London, where he found work as a public relations officer with the petroleum information bureau. He had become obsessed with the threat posed to European civilization by Nazism, and confessed to his friend Christopher Sykes: &#145;It's a queer unexpected situation to find that the only person talking sense in this country is Winston Churchill&#146;  (Sykes, 161). Byron visited Germany in 1937 and again in 1938, when he attended the Nuremberg rally &#145;to see the enemy&#146;  (ibid., 166). Each visit intensified his anger: &#145;I shall have warmonger put on my passport&#146;  (ibid., 163). He took &#145;the extremest imaginable anti-Munich view&#146;  (ibid., 168) and conducted a personal crusade against appeasement: he startled the diners at a London club by leaning across a table to ask a Chamberlainite member of parliament: &#145;Are you in German pay?&#146;  (ibid., 173).<br>
<br>The violence of his behaviour, though, earned Byron disapproval in high places and when war broke a first-rate appointment was denied him. Disappointed, he accepted work as a sub-editor in the overseas news department of the British Broadcasting Corporation. While on his way to Cairo as a special war correspondent for a group of English newspapers he was drowned by enemy action, when his ship was torpedoed off Stornoway on 24 February 1941. He was unmarried. He had greeted the war with characteristic levity when it finally came: &#145;Well, there's one thing to be thankful for: the post-war decadence ought to be even better than the last&#146;  (Sykes, 175).<br>
<br>Byron's writing showed continuous growth and even his lightest things, such as <span class="italic">How we Celebrate the Coronation</span> (1937), were written with all his energy and care. His development was very rapid and while still a young man he became, what he remained, the only writer of his time to convey a vivid idea of Byzantine art and civilization to the common reader. His first books sometimes erred on the side of massiveness of expression but his most considered and interesting performance, <span class="italic">The Road to Oxiana</span>, was written with such charm and verve that most contemporary readers did not recognize it as a serious and original contribution to Islamic studies. Paradoxically it was better appreciated by the specialists, for whom he had no liking, than by the unspecialized readers to whom it was addressed. He may be said to have anticipated views which later scholarship has adduced from fuller evidence than was then available.<br>
<br>Byron was<blockquote>moderately fat, short, with very fair hair, a penetrating rolling eye &hellip; and a voice whose quiet lazy intonations never concealed the abounding vitality behind it, and which, on sometimes small, and sometimes not easily detectable provocation, broke out into violent spatter of invective. (Sykes, 81&#150;2)</blockquote>He was of a polemical disposition and unfortunately he allowed this to leave blemishes on all his books, even his best. <span class="italic">The Byzantine Achievement</span> includes a bitter condemnation of the Roman Catholic church, and <span class="italic">An Essay on India</span> seven pages of vituperation directed at the &#145;anti-dominion&#146; party in Britain in the 1930s. There is some disproportion in his work as a result, but the fault is compensated by the delight which goes with intense enthusiasm and mastery of style. Byron was the subject of the principal essay in Christopher Sykes's <span class="italic">Four Studies in Loyalty</span> (1946) and a selection of his letters to his mother was published in 1991, edited by his sister Lucy Butler.<br>
