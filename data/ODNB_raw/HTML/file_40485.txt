<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Neal,  Mary Clara Sophia</span>  (1860&#150;1944), <span class="occ">social worker and folk-dance collector</span>, was born on 5 June 1860 at 21 Noel Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, the eldest of the three children of David Neal (1834&#150;1918), button manufacturer, and his wife, Sarah Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith (1833&#150;1914). The family was prosperous, but Clara Sophia, as she was then known, felt that her life was snobbish and hypocritical. In February 1888 she was one of a number of &#145;ladies of leisure, culture, refinement and devotion&#146;  (Bagwell, 25&#150;6) who joined the recently formed Methodist West London Mission, becoming &#145;Sisters of the People&#146;, unpaid social workers among the poor of Soho and Marylebone. At this point she took the name &#145;Mary&#146; by which she was henceforth known.<br>
<br>One of Neal's special tasks was the running of a club for working girls, and in 1891 she was joined in this by Emmeline Pethick, her closest friend for the rest of her life. In 1895 they left the mission and established their own Esp&eacute;rance Girls' Club, later linked with a commercial tailoring establishment called the &#145;Maison Esp&eacute;rance&#146;, independently putting into practice the gospel of socialism. Important innovative elements in their work were the use of drama and dancing, and also the introduction of an annual country or seaside holiday for the girls.<br>
<br>After Emmeline's marriage to Fred Lawrence in 1901, she was succeeded by Herbert MacIlwaine as musical director. In 1905 he suggested that the girls might enjoy the folk-songs then being collected by Cecil Sharp. This was so successful that Neal asked for dances which might have a similar popularity. Sharp recalled seeing the Headington Quarry Morris Dancers in 1899 and gave her William Kimber's address. Neal promptly took a train to Oxford and a hansom cab to Headington Quarry, where she found Kimber and arranged for him to come to London to teach his dances to the girls. On 15 February 1906 the club held a belated new year party at the Passmore Edwards Settlement and the songs and dances were greeted with immense enthusiasm, Laurence Housman telling Neal that she and her girls must show the country what they had discovered.<br>
<br>On 3 April 1906 a public concert was held, preceded by an introductory lecture by Sharp. This was a defining moment in the history of the folk revival. Both Sharp and Neal felt that they had become instruments in a direct and transforming restoration of a lost English heritage. For Neal there was the added incentive that the girls of the Esp&eacute;rance Club were themselves to be the means by which this might happen, teaching the songs and dances in towns and villages throughout England. She revelled in her role as publicist and organizer of this new national movement, the Association for the Revival and Practice of Folk Music, later to become the Esp&eacute;rance Guild of Morris Dancers. Bernard Partridge's cartoon, &#145;Merrie England Once More&#146; (<span class="italic">Punch</span>, 13 November 1907), symbolized the hopes and expectations which were being engendered.<br>
<br>Unfortunately there were differences of approach between Neal and Sharp. Sharp, the professional educationist, was concerned with scholarly accuracy. Neal, the philanthropic social worker, was more directly concerned with the joy of the actual dancer: she believed in the power of the material to transmit itself, and regretted the necessity for books of instruction. From 1910 to 1914 there was a bitter struggle between Sharp's English Folk Dance Society (EFDS) and Neal's guild. At the time it was by no means clear that Sharp would be the winner. Neal had many influential supporters; she had her popular <span class="italic">Esp&eacute;rance Morris Books</span>; she had recruited a men's morris side before Sharp achieved this; she had friendly contacts with many traditional dancers; she had the use of the restored Crosby Hall for her guild meetings; and she had Clive Carey as a highly capable musical director and collector.<br>
<br>But the First World War brought the cessation of Esp&eacute;rance activity and Neal became involved in pensions administration on the Isle of Dogs. In west Sussex after the war she still had tentative thoughts of reviving her role in the folk world. But this was no longer possible: the future lay with Sharp and the EFDS, a more stable, middle-class affair, with a professional educational basis. She never again became directly involved in folk activity, although privately she encouraged Rolf Gardiner in his quest for independence from the EFDS. One big new commitment in 1920 was her adoption of Herbert MacIlwaine's son, Anthony, after he was orphaned. In 1925 she moved to Littlehampton, Sussex, where for twelve years she worked as a magistrate, particularly concerned with children's cases. A measure of belated public recognition came in 1937 when she was made CBE &#145;for services in connexion with the revival of folk songs and dances&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1906 Neal had been at the inaugural meeting of the Women's Suffrage and Political Union, actually taking the minutes on that occasion, and she remained a firm supporter of the suffrage movement. Her unorthodox religious views were centred in an intense personal sense of mysticism. In person she was tall and imposing, with vivid blue eyes and an equally notable sense of humour. In 1940, when Littlehampton was affected by the war, she went to stay with the Pethick-Lawrences at Gomshall in Surrey and remained there until she died from cancer on 22 June 1944, at The Retreat, Rad Lane, Peaslake, Shere, Surrey. She was cremated in Woking two days later.<br>
