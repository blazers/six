<span class="headword">Barnard, Sir  Frederick Augusta</span>  (1743&#150;1830), <span class="occ">librarian</span>, was the son of John Barnard (<i>d</i>. 1773), page of the backstairs to Frederick, prince of Wales, and to the prince's wife, Augusta (after whom Frederick was named), who may have been his godparents. The erroneous belief, which originated with the obituary of Barnard in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, that he was the illegitimate son of Frederick, prince of Wales, almost certainly arose from a confusion with Fitz Frederick (who died in infancy), son of the prince of Wales and Anne Vane, daughter of Lord Barnard. Barnard started in royal service as page of the backstairs to George III in 1760; by 1765 he was a member of the staff of the royal library, then newly housed in the octagon at the Queen's House.<br>
<br>The old royal library had been given to the British Museum by George II in 1757. George III employed Barnard as chief agent in his lifelong endeavour to build up a new collection, which later came to be known as the King's Library. Though still very young, Barnard rapidly established himself as a man of account and was responsible for introducing Samuel Johnson to the king in 1768. Shortly afterwards, in a lengthy and famous letter, subsequently printed in the King's Library catalogue, but denied by Barnard to Boswell, Johnson proffered invaluable advice to Barnard on book purchase. Barnard's association with the Johnson circle may have dated from this time. Between 1768 and 1771 Barnard, on a salary of &pound;200 p.a. and with a purchasing allowance of &pound;2000 p.a., travelled in Europe, buying books, visiting many of the principal cities&#151;Paris, Vienna, Rome, Strasbourg, Dresden, Berlin, Amsterdam, Brussels&#151;and taking advantage of the recent dispersal of many Jesuit libraries.<br>
<br>In 1774 Barnard succeeded Richard Dalton as royal librarian, a position he was to hold for half a century. He followed the king's wishes in building up a genuinely working library, albeit one well stocked with rarities, and including a magnificent topographical and cartographical collection, manuscripts, coins and medals, and drawings. It was a library collected (in Barnard's own words included in the printed catalogue):<blockquote>upon such a comprehensive and liberal design of embracing every species of Knowledge, that the Possessor of it can call to his aid upon any subject, all the Learning and Wisdom which the mind of man has hitherto communicated to the world. (<span class="italic">Bibliothecae Regiae catalogus</span>, 1820&#150;29, 1.viii&#150;ix)</blockquote>By 1823, when George IV presented his father's library to the nation for deposit at the British Museum, the collection comprised over 65,000 volumes, 19,000 pamphlets, and the king's topographical collection of some 50,000 maps and charts. Barnard had doubts about the transfer of the military plans, charts, topography, and geography collections, and succeeded in reserving the king's maritime collection, the larger part of which was given to the museum only in 1844. In 1973 the King's Library passed into the care of the newly established British Library and was transferred in 1998 to the new British Library building at St Pancras. His portrait by John Knight, presented to the British Museum in 1926, hangs adjacent to the glass tower housing the King's Library.<br>
<br>Barnard became FSA in 1789 and FRS in 1790 when his proposers included a number of notable members of the Johnson circle such as R. P. Joddrell and John Paradise. He was largely responsible for compiling the catalogue of the King's Library, based on the twelve-volume manuscript catalogue, which was published in five volumes between 1820 and 1829 as <span class="italic">Bibliothecae Regiae catalogus</span>. He also checked and revised the catalogue of medals in 1814.<br>
<br>In October 1796 Barnard married Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1837), daughter of John Byde; they had one son, George (<i>d</i>. 1817), and at least one daughter, who died young. Barnard retired from the royal library in 1828, having overseen the transfer of it and its staff to the British Museum. In the same year he was made a knight commander of the Royal Guelphic Order. He died on 27 January 1830 at his house in St James's Palace. He was buried in St Martin-in-the-Fields and in 1852 reinterred in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
