<span class="headword">Walker,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1582?, <em>d.</em> 1651), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Hawkshead in Furness, Lancashire, and was probably the son of Edward Walker baptized in Hawkshead on 7 October 1582. Educated first at Hawkshead grammar school, founded by his kinsman Archbishop Edwin Sandys, he then went to St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA early in 1609 and proceeded MA in 1611, and where his teachers included Christopher Foster and Alexander Richardson. Ordained deacon in London on 22 September 1611, &#145;aged twenty-eight&#146;, he may have been curate of Ware, Hertfordshire, before being ordained priest on 7 June 1612.<br>
<br>In 1611 Walker attracted attention by attacking the celebrated London puritan divine Anthony Wotton for perversion of the orthodox doctrine of justification. Their dispute, which was initially conducted in private conference and from various city pulpits, centred on whether or not Christ's righteousness was imputed to the believer, Wotton having claimed in defiance of Calvinist orthodoxy that this was not the case. Walker believed he detected in Wotton's position a thinly veiled Socinianism, and he noisily accused the older preacher of heresy and blasphemy. The dispute ultimately led in 1614 to an informal (but semi-sanctioned) conclave of some of London's most distinguished godly divines&#151;including Lewis Bayly, Richard Westfield, William Gouge, Richard Stock, and Thomas Gataker&#151;which gathered to adjudicate the quarrel. The result was a qualified victory for Wotton. This neither hindered Walker's career nor ended his campaign, however. On the presentation of the dean and chapter of Canterbury Cathedral he was inducted on 29 April 1614 to the living of St John the Evangelist, Watling Street, London, resigned in his favour by his former tutor Foster. Later in the decade he wrote a long manuscript polemical attack on the renowned nonconformist divine William Bradshaw, whose <span class="italic">A Treatise of Justification</span> (1615) had attempted to clarify the dispute. Walker's appointment on 2 March 1619 as chaplain to the widely respected bishop of Ely, Nicholas Felton, suggests that despite his godly connections and tendencies he also had friends in the ecclesiastical establishment and was regarded as a conformist. That year he proceeded BD, being incorporated of Oxford in 1621.<br>
<br>While in the early 1620s Walker apparently accused the London minister William Chibald of errors similar to Wotton's, he also took aim at a very different polemical target, Roman Catholicism. In May 1623 Walker agreed to an informal conference with a priest named Sylvester Norris; a month later, accompanied by his fellow London minister Henry Burton, Walker engaged in a disputation with the notorious Jesuit John Fisher (real name Percy). Walker's accounts of these encounters were published respectively as <span class="italic">The Sum of a Disputation</span> (1624) and <span class="italic">Fishers Folly Unfolded</span> (1624).<br>
<br>Only with the accession of William Laud to the bishopric of London in 1628 did Walker begin to experience difficulties with the ecclesiastical authorities. In November 1631 he found himself summoned before the high commission. Although no articles or accusations survive, the fact that the court ordered him at one point to &#145;give in a Coppy of the sermon&#146; suggests that he was in trouble for some matter uttered by him from the pulpit  (CUL, MS Dd. ii. 21, fol. 85<i>r</i>). His case dragged on for two years, although in the end Walker appears to have escaped serious censure. Yet this was only the beginning of his troubles with Laud. As the latter, now archbishop, observed to King Charles in his annual report for 1635, Walker<blockquote>had all his time been but a disorderly and peevish man, and now of late hath very forwardly preached against the Lord Bishop of Ely [Francis White] his book concerning the Lord's Day, set out by authority; but upon a canonical admonition given him to desist he hath recollected himself, and I hope will be advised. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 5.332)</blockquote>Perhaps unsurprisingly given his temperament, this warning served only to provoke Walker, who in 1638 brazenly published a work of sabbatarian extremism, <span class="italic">The Doctrine of the Sabbath</span>, printed illicitly at Amsterdam. In 1638&#150;9 he came under official scrutiny again for his theological disputes with John Goodwin, an affray that drew the intervention of Bishop William Juxon of London.<br>
<br>Walker's final confrontation with the Caroline authorities came on 14 November 1638, when he was called before the king and privy council and &#145;Charged to have uttered and delivered in a Sermon &hellip; the fourth of October Last, divers thinges tending to publique faction, and disobedience to Authority&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Bankes 23, fol. 27<i>r</i>). On Walker's account, Laud (perhaps not without some warrant) &#145;accused to the king&#146; that Walker had been &#145;a seditious fellow ever since he the said Archbishop knew London, and a preacher of factious and mutinous doctrine and the greatest troubler of London who had raysed upp more troubles and stirres then any other in the City&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/500/6, fols. 35&#150;8). Among other things, it was alleged that Walker had preached that &#145;wee must not too much fear great men kings and potentates&#146;, that &#145;[h]e teaches inferiors to examine and dispute the commands of their superiors&#146;, that &#145;[h]e blames officers and ministers who execute the warrants of judges and magistrates by taking away mens goods and Haling them to prison calling them executions of unjust decrees&#146;, a claim that the councillors saw as a reference to ship money  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Bankes 44, fol. 13<i>r</i>). For his pains Walker found himself suspended and committed to the Gatehouse, where he languished for ten weeks until he grew perilously ill and was transferred to his brother's house in the country. Walker remained under house arrest for the next year and a half.<br>
<br>On 20 May 1641 Walker was freed by order of parliament, and his imprisonment declared illegal. Restored to his parsonage, he published that year a number of theological works which acknowledged his debt to Londoners and others who had supported him in his afflictions, including <span class="italic">The Key of Saving Knowledge</span> (dedicated to his parishioners), <span class="italic">The History of the Creation</span> (dedicated to the earl of Bedford), and <span class="italic">God Made Visible in his Works</span> (dedicated to Sir Thomas Barrington, Sir Gilbert Gerard, Sir William Masson, and Sir Martin Lumley). Twenty-five years after the Wotton affair, he also continued to spar in print over its exact details. His <span class="italic">Socinianism in the Fundamental Point of Justification</span> (1641) and <span class="italic">A True Relation</span> (1642) were countered by Thomas Gataker's <span class="italic">Mr Anthony Wotton's Defence</span> (1641). He went on to become an active member of the Westminster assembly of divines in 1643, to preach a fast sermon before parliament on 29 January 1645, and (as a zealous presbyterian) to become a leader of the first London classis upon its foundation in 1645, serving alongside William Gouge as a trier. His anonymous advocacy of the new discipline appeared as <span class="italic">A Modell of the Government of the Church under the Gospell</span> (1646).<br>
<br>During this period Walker likewise devoted considerable effort to raising funds for the establishment of lectureships in parts of England that, in the words of his will, had hitherto been &#145;most barren and destitute of meanes to maintayne the preaching of the Gospell&#146;, especially his native Lancashire. Indeed, when he died late in 1651 he bequeathed land in his birthplace of Hawkshead for the establishment of a perpetual lectureship there. Walker was survived by his wife, Katherine, who proved his will on 22 January 1652, a married daughter, and his apparently estranged son, George (who against Walker's wishes had abandoned study for the ministry and secretly married a poor, undowried woman).<br>
