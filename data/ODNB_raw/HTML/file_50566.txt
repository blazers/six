<span class="headword">Lorimer, Sir  William</span>  (1844&#150;1922), <span class="occ">locomotive engineer and industrialist</span>, was born on 4 November 1844 in Sanquhar, Dumfriesshire, son of William Lorimer, house factor, and Margaret Whigham. Little is known about his family origins and early life in Sanquhar. He attended the local parish school and at the age of fifteen joined the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway Company, probably as an apprentice or clerk. In 1864 he moved into locomotive engineering as a cashier in the newly founded business of D&uuml;bs &amp; Co. This firm became one of the principal locomotive engineering companies in Glasgow, and was founded by Henry D&uuml;bs at the Glasgow locomotive works, later known as the Queen's Park works, Polmadie, on the south side of Glasgow. Lorimer made an impression on D&uuml;bs and was made his principal assistant in 1867. By 1875 Lorimer was made a partner in the firm and only one year later D&uuml;bs died, leaving the business in the hands of his two sons, Henry and Charles, and William Lorimer. As managing partner Lorimer held a key role in the firm with the D&uuml;bs sons assuming a lower profile.<br>
<br>In 1874 Lorimer began a long association with the Steel Company of Scotland Ltd. He acted as its general manager, in a caretaker role between 1874 and 1878. He then joined the board, following in the footsteps of Henry D&uuml;bs, who had also been a director. From 1878, under the chairmanship of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36455/', "Sir Charles Tennant")</script>, the company went through a period of technical innovation and expansion. However, it was also a period of over-expansion which brought the company close to bankruptcy. When Tennant resigned in 1895 it was Lorimer who took over as chairman and restored business confidence and a measure of stability, in an industry where economic fluctuations and market forces caused uncertainty. He resigned in 1918, but was then given the position of honorary president.<br>
<br>Such qualities of leadership also led to Lorimer's appointment as chairman of the North British Locomotive Company in 1903. This firm was an amalgamation of Sharp Stewart &amp; Co. Ltd, Neilson, Reid &amp; Co., and D&uuml;bs &amp; Co., all leading Glasgow companies. Unity in the face of competition, increasing overheads, and declining markets created a company which dominated locomotive engineering in Britain and Europe with a combined workforce of nearly 8000 and a capacity to produce some 600 engines per annum at the Hydepark and Atlas works, Springburn, and at the Queen's Park works, Polmadie. It was typical of Lorimer and his interest in the welfare of his workers that, in order to mark the amalgamation in 1903, he conveyed to trustees a large number of shares in the North British Locomotive Company to provide pensions for aged and infirm workmen.<br>
<br>Despite the dual role which Lorimer fulfilled at the head of two leading Scottish companies, he also devoted much of his time to a wide range of public duties and activities. His interests were wide-ranging over education, politics, and local issues. As an extension of his business interests he was a director of the Glasgow and South Western Railway Company. He was elected a member of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland in 1896 and also was a member of the West of Scotland Iron and Steel Institute. From 1900 he was chairman of the Locomotive Manufacturers' Association of Great Britain. As a resident of the south side of Glasgow he took an interest in local issues and was one of the main campaigners in the 1880s to establish a third voluntary hospital on the south side of Glasgow, which resulted in the opening of the Victoria Infirmary in 1890. He was appointed vice-chairman of the board of governors.<br>
<br>Education was also close to his heart and Lorimer served on various bodies. He was appointed a governor of the Royal Technical College of Glasgow, serving on its university advisory joint committee for a while. As a governor of Hutcheson's Education Trust he served as a representative on the burgh committee of secondary education. He was also a member of the juvenile delinquency board. However, his greatest involvement was in university education. In 1905 he was appointed lord rector's assessor to H. H. Asquith, who had become lord rector of Glasgow University. Three years later under Lord Rosebery he became chancellor's assessor until 1913. The university conferred on Lorimer the honorary degree of LLD in 1910.<br>
<br>Lorimer's university service was closely linked to his political stance as a Liberal Unionist and free trader. He had been an active member of the Glasgow parliamentary debating society and was a fluent speaker. While his political activities were confined to promoting local campaigns they were none the less important; and when Rosebery arrived in Glasgow on 10 September 1909 to deliver his famous budget speech it was Lorimer who welcomed him to the city and chaired the meeting. Indeed, Lorimer had been the chairman of the committee promoting the Glasgow meeting. On the same day Lorimer also organized the formal opening by Lord Rosebery of the new administrative building of the North British Locomotive Company.<br>
<br>In 1911 Lorimer was appointed to the dominions commission, a body set up to survey the natural resources of the overseas dominions and to assess the possible trade links. Despite increasing deafness, Lorimer took on this task with the same dedication and application so characteristic of his business career, travelling extensively overseas between 1911 and 1917.<br>
<br>Lorimer was a man of simple tastes and outlook. In his younger years he developed an interest in literature and through his membership of several literary societies and clubs became a keen collector of books. On 4 February 1869 he married Jane Gray Smith (<i>d</i>. 1902); they had four sons and four daughters. Two sons followed their father into locomotive engineering; and in 1903 Lorimer passed the day-to-day running of the Queen's Park works to his son William, one of the joint managing directors. His daughter Janie was one of the early women medical graduates from Glasgow University. He married for a second time on 18 September 1913; his new wife was Mary Elizabeth Muir Simpson, a widow, the daughter of John Sieber, a calico printer. Although not a pioneer or an innovator, Lorimer displayed great leadership skills and business acumen. After an outstanding career in Scottish industry, recognized by a knighthood in 1917, he died on 9 April 1922 at home at 27 Mansionhouse Road, Glasgow; his second wife survived him. He was buried at Cathcart cemetery on 12 April.<br>
