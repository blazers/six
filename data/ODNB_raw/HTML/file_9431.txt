<span class="headword">Finch,  Francis Oliver</span>  (1802&#150;1862), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was born prematurely on 22 November 1802, possibly in Friday Street, near Cheapside, London, the son of Francis Finch, a merchant in Friday Street, and his wife, whose maiden name was Oliver. His father died two years later, leaving his widow inadequately provided for. Finch, cared for by his mother and her sisters, was a sickly child and was sent to live with his grandmother, Mrs Oliver, at Stone, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. In this rural environment he flourished, being able eventually to join in children's games. When he was seven an offer of presentation to Christ's Hospital, London, was refused by his mother on account of his earlier delicacy. He had little education apart from what he received at home, but he early acquired an appreciation of literature: before the age of thirteen he had learned by heart much of <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> and was reading Edmund Spenser's <span class="italic">Faerie Queene</span>. As an adult he himself wrote prose and poetry, including some pleasing sonnets.<br>
<br>Finch began painting during his boyhood; his promise moved the unidentified friend who had wished to present him at Christ's Hospital to offer to bear the cost of placing him with a professional painter. Consequently, at the age of twelve, he was articled to the watercolourist John Varley for three years (subsequently extended to five) at a premium of &pound;200. The same friend afterwards paid for a tour in Scotland, where the young artist realized the possibilities of landscape study. On his return he attended Henry Sass's life academy; he probably also attended Henry Fuseli's lectures at the Royal Academy.<br>
<br>Finch was introduced to William Blake by John Linnell, another of Varley's pupils. He initially saw Blake as &#145;a new kind of man, wholly original&#146;  (Gilchrist, 300) but later he qualified this opinion, characterizing him as &#145;perverse and wilful&#146;  (ibid., 320). His early admiration was enhanced when he met Samuel Palmer, the central figure of a group of admiring young men gathered around Blake who called themselves the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95471', "Ancients")</script>. They understood little of Blake's thought but all&#151;especially Palmer&#151;were deeply affected by the vision of landscape in his wood-engravings for Robert John Thornton's <span class="italic">Virgil for Schools</span> (1821). It was probably these illustrations which finally decided Finch to paint landscapes. His compositions are sometimes topographical but more often they are an imaginative amalgam with undertones from the poetry of Keats, which he loved, and recollections of the compositions of Claude; in technique they are much indebted to Varley. At their most original they are well composed, with depth, richness of colour, and intensity of atmosphere: <span class="italic">Classical Landscape with a Sea Coast</span> (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford) and <span class="italic">Ruined Castle with a Thunderstorm</span> (British Museum, London) are examples of his best work. On 11 February 1822, at the tender age of nineteen, he was elected an associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours; he became a full member on 4 June 1827.<br>
<br>Finch was elegant in appearance, demeanour, and address, and his presence at any dinner party was said to ensure its success. A pianist and a gifted counter-tenor, he joined the choir of the Swedenborg church in Cross Street, Hatton Garden, London, where he met Elizabeth (Eliza) McNab (1808&#150;1891). They were married at All Souls Church, Langham Place, in the spring of 1837 (the Cross Street church was not licensed for weddings) and at first lived with Finch's mother, now married to Dr William Thomson, at 51 Upper Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square; later they moved to 2 Argyle Square, New Road (now Euston Road). Early in their marriage the couple visited Paris, where Finch copied a Claude in the Mus&eacute;e du Louvre. He was never robust and on 13 May 1857 suffered a severe stroke from which, however, he recovered. In 1860 he and his wife moved to a smaller house, 38 Manchester Square, where in 1861 he suffered a more severe stroke, depriving him of the use of his limbs. Finally they moved to 6 Highfield Villas, Kentish Town, London, where Finch died peacefully on 27 August 1862. He left no children. His wife published his <span class="italic">Memorials</span> in 1865. The British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven, Connecticut, have examples of his work.<br>
