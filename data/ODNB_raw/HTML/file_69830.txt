<span class="headword">Trelawny,  Ian Clarence</span>  (1917&#150;1998), <span class="occ">docks manager and port consultant</span>, was born on 17 January 1917 at 1 Coltbridge Terrace, Edinburgh, the eldest child in the family of three sons and two daughters of Captain Clarence Walter Eyre Trelawny, an officer in the Royal Navy, and his wife, Barbara Cecil, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Carus-Wilson (<i>d</i>. 1976). The family was from Cornwall, and Trelawny was educated at St Erbyn's School, Penzance, and King's College, Taunton. After working as a clerk for a cold storage firm, in 1938 he started a boat-building and yacht-broking business in London. On 23 September 1939 he married Mary Ethel (<i>b</i>. 1914/15), the daughter of Edgar Frank Eyles, theatrical manager.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War Trelawny joined the Royal Navy as a rating, serving in mine-sweepers and later in an armed merchant cruiser. After he had recovered from severe wounds received in action in August 1942, he was commissioned and was posted to Felixstowe, Suffolk, where he served in the coastal force. Following promotion to lieutenant-commander he commanded the 11th MTB (motor torpedo boat) flotilla from 1943 to 1945. He was awarded the DSC and bar for his part in many raids against German ships firing on British planes flying over the North Sea, and on E-boats attacking British coastal shipping. During the Normandy invasions in 1944 he worked on salvage, and later he organized the reopening of several ports along the northern European coast. He remained in the Royal Navy after the war, commanding a salvage ship in Hong Kong harbour for a time. On 12 October 1946, his first marriage having ended in divorce, he remarried: his second wife was (Angela) June Wilkinson (<i>b</i>. 1923/4), the daughter of Dr James Howard Wilkinson, medical practitioner. She had served in the Women's Royal Naval Service during the war. They had one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>Trelawny was appointed manager of the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Company in 1955. The company had been founded as the Felixstowe Railway and Pier Company in 1875 by Colonel George Tomline, a local landowner, who had bought 6000 acres of land from the duke of Hamilton in 1867, and obtained parliamentary permission to build a railway line from Ipswich to Felixstowe&#151;then only a small village on the north bank of the River Orwell, about a mile from the North Sea. The railway was completed in 1877. Hoping to develop Felixstowe as a port, he extended the line down to the Orwell and in the early 1880s built a small dock basin opposite the port of Harwich. But although Felixstowe developed as a seaside resort, the port did not prosper except as a centre for flying boats between the wars, and it was requisitioned during the Second World War as a base for air-sea rescues, as well as for coastal defence. In 1951 the nearly derelict docks were handed back to the company, which was bought by Gordon Parker, a Norfolk grain merchant, who became chairman. The docks were flooded during the devastating east coast floods of 1953, causing the dock basin to silt up, and the old wooden piers were destroyed, while the foundations of many buildings, and the railway lines, were undermined.<br>
<br>Starting with a workforce of nine, Trelawny began dredging the docks and salvaging what remained of the infrastructure. This was in the face of opposition from the local council, which did not want the town to expand and tried to purchase compulsorily the docks to use as a rubbish dump. Trelawny was helped by the fact that Felixstowe, as a virtually redundant port, had not been included in the national dock labour scheme of 1947, and so he was not hampered by some of the restrictive practices enshrined in the scheme. Two new piers were completed in 1957, and, always in the forefront of developments in methods of cargo handling, he was the first dock manager to use forklift trucks, in 1956. In order to encourage the expanding plastics industry to import chemicals through Felixstowe, he reclaimed the old admiralty tanks, and built new ones, linked by pipelines to tankers moored on the quay, for the storage of liquid chemicals. An oil jetty was completed in 1964.<br>
<br>The biggest expansion of Felixstowe as a cargo port came in the 1960s with the introduction of container traffic, and Felixstowe was the first East Anglian port to build a container holder for use on roll-on roll-off ferries. A new cold store, the only one on the east coast, opened in 1963 to handle frozen goods passing through the docks, and Trelawny went on to open a tanker terminal. By the mid-1960s work was under way on a scheme to reclaim land in Harwich harbour to build a quay to provide space for more container ships and ferries. The new container terminal was completed in 1968 and extended in 1973. By 1975 Felixstowe docks were able to handle 3 million tons of container traffic. Townsend Thoresen, the ferry company, began operating a regular passenger service to Zeebrugge in Belgium in 1974 and opened a continental ferry terminal in 1978. By the end of the century Felixstowe had been transformed from a quiet seaside town, chiefly a dormitory for Ipswich, into Britain's largest container port. Although the port was bought by European Ferries in 1976, and taken over first by P &amp; O in 1987 and then by Hutchison Whampoa in 1991, the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Company (known as the Dock Company) continued to own and operate most of the cargo handling infrastructure.<br>
<br>Trelawny was appointed OBE in 1967. In 1972 he moved from management to be head of the consultancy side of the company, and he travelled worldwide, advising on the improvement of port facilities. He retired in 1987, and died on 22 April 1998 in the St Elizabeth Hospice, 565 Foxhall Road, Ipswich, Suffolk, of lung cancer. His remains were privately cremated on 30 April. He was survived by his wife, June, and their four children.<br>
