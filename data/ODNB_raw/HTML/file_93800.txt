<span class="headword">Dering <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gibbes]</span>,  Unton</span>, Lady Dering  (<em>d.</em> 1676), <span class="occ">letter writer and political agent</span>, was the eldest of the five daughters and one of the twelve children of Sir Ralph Gibbes, first baronet (<i>d</i>. 1613), of Honington Manor, Honington, Warwickshire, and Gertrude (<i>d</i>. 1611), daughter of Sir Thomas Wroughton of Broadhenton, Wiltshire; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10583/', "Charles Gibbes (bap. 1603, d. 1681)")</script> was her brother. On 16 July 1629 Unton married the courtier and local politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7531/', "Sir Edward Dering, first baronet (1598&#150;1644)")</script>, of Surrenden Dering, Pluckley, Kent, as his third wife. The couple had two sons and two daughters, Dorothy Unton (1630?&#150;1669), Henry (<i>b</i>. 1632), Edward (1633&#150;1703)&#151;(who shared the name of his half-brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37354/', "Edward Dering (1625&#150;1684), later second baronet")</script>&#151;and Frances (<i>b</i>. 1636); Unton also took a close interest in the six orphaned children of her sister Gertrude and Anthony Percival. This was a marriage of strong mutual love and affection, evidenced by a collection of more than twenty-five letters from Dering to his wife, spanning a period of twelve years, from the end of 1629 to early 1642  (CKS, U275/C1 and U350/C2). She is his &#145;very deare Numpes&#146; and the letters are directed to his &#145;best and dearest freinde&#146;. Detectable throughout their correspondence is the unity of purpose and interest between them, and the increasing trust Sir Edward placed in the integrity and advice of his wife.<br>
<br>Only scattered evidence survives of &eacute;lite women's influence in early modern parliamentary elections. Along with Lady Brilliana Harley, however, Lady Dering provides one of the best documented examples of a woman orchestrating an election campaign in this period. During the Long Parliament elections of 1640 Unton Dering acted as her husband's agent in his successful bid to be returned as one of the two knights of the shire for Kent. She gathered political information from a wide variety of sources and relayed this to Sir Edward on the campaign trail. In her letters she reported who had declared support for him, including the dean of Canterbury Cathedral, Isaac Bargrave, and warned him of the double dealing of Sir Edward Boys, &#145;who professes to be for you, yett he works earnestly for some other under-hand&#146;. She also warned him that his choice of running-mate, Sir John Culpepper, would alienate some voters. Her activities included meetings with or writing to local gentlemen to secure their support, advising her husband to canvass key voters personally, and telling him where his opponent's greatest strength lay. Lady Dering's combination of eminent political sense and calm religious faith is revealed in her advice to Sir Edward that despite his &#145;desiers and endevors&#146; he should not &#145;lett this posses the[e] to deeply, but lett it be indiferent to the[e] &hellip; god knowes what is best his will be don&#146;  (Cresswell, 49&#150;51); they were agreed that all their effort and expense was for God's glory alone.<br>
<br>The Derings suffered badly during the early years of the civil war when, after a brief but high-profile courtship period with the parliamentarians, Sir Edward, essentially a moderate, raised a company of troops and joined the king in the latter half of 1643. Surrenden was plundered by parliamentary troops on four separate occasions, and it was Unton who appealed to the committee for sequestration that year, outlining her grievances and requesting recompense. Her husband was forced to sue for pardon, but it was only after his death on 22 June 1644 that his heir, his son Edward from his second marriage, obtained a remission of his fine and return of the family estate. Unton had been left Surrenden Dering to enjoy during her lifetime as part of a jointure bestowed on her by her husband in 1639. She continued to live there with her children until 1661, when her stepson arranged to &#145;hire&#146; the family seat from her. By 1646 she and the second baronet had fallen out over lands that they both claimed, she as part of her jointure and he as his inheritance. Bitter legal wrangles continued throughout the 1650s. Unton must then have moved to Maidstone, where she lived in some style as befitted her status. She died there, intestate, early in November 1676 and was buried in Pluckley on 10 November. Although viewed critically by some, many contemporaries valued her piety, capability, and intelligence. Henry Oxinden, a former neighbour of her sister Gertrude and a co-guardian of the latter's children, wrote to her in 1647 that &#145;you not only excell those of your owne sexe but also the most able and learned of the other&#146; and that &#145;as a woman &hellip; you are able not onlie to manage a private Estate butt also to governe a Kingdome if called thereunto&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oxinden and Peyton Letters</span>).<br>
