<span class="headword">Landau,  Henry</span>  (1892&#150;1968), <span class="occ">intelligence officer</span>, was born in Transvaal, on 7 March 1892, the son of Charles Landau, an English merchant, and Christina Smith, who was Dutch. Educated at Durban high school and Dulwich College (1902&#150;3), Landau went to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1910 and gained first class honours in the natural sciences tripos. Fluent in French, German, and Dutch, he travelled widely in Europe and after graduating from Cambridge in 1913 he joined the Royal School of Mines, London. On the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 he joined the Australian Volunteer Hospital, and was soon in France. In December 1914 Landau enlisted in the Royal Field Artillery and, after brief training, returned to France in April 1915 as second lieutenant. On sick leave in London in May 1916 he successfully applied for a transfer to the intelligence corps, and in the following month was seconded to Commander Mansfield Cumming, head of the British secret service. The Germans had recently broken up Cumming's spy network monitoring troop movements in occupied Belgium and northern France, and he informed Landau that &#145;it is up to you to reorganise the service&#146;  (Landau, <span class="italic">All's Fair</span>, 43). Landau was dispatched to Rotterdam to work with Richard Bolton Tinsley, one of Cumming's senior agents.<br>
<br>In Rotterdam Landau headed Tinsley's military section, running train-watching networks in the eastern half of Belgium under an agreement with British general headquarters, which ran its own networks in the western half. His agents monitored the distribution of German forces, passing messages across the electrified barrier which the Germans had constructed along the Dutch&#150;Belgian border. The most significant of his networks was La Dame Blanche, which by the end of the war included over 900 agents and ninety observation posts. By October 1916 Landau's networks were producing results, while the general headquarters' systems were in decline. By July 1917 the general headquarters' networks were in such poor shape that Sigismund Payne Best was sent to Rotterdam to reorganize them. Best found Landau &#145;a very hard worker&#146;, but heard rumours that he had been poaching general headquarters' agents. More significantly he found Tinsley to be &#145;a most thorough-paced scoundrel&#146;  (Payne Best correspondence, Walter L. Leschander Collection), who was heavily involved in blackmailing Dutch businessmen through the allied blacklist of firms known to trade with Germany.<br>
<br>By September 1917 Tinsley was under official investigation and Best claimed that on two occasions Tinsley sent agents to beat him up, although each time Landau tipped him off. In November 1917 general headquarters was obliged to transfer Best to London, after official complaints from Colonel Oppenheim, military attach&eacute; at The Hague. As a postwar report noted, Landau was now Tinsley's second in command, &#145;and was undoubtedly the brains&#146; of the Rotterdam operation  (Jeffery, 77).<br>
<br>In June 1918 Cumming recalled Landau to London, noting in his diary that he &#145;won't speak but gives me the impression that there is &#147;something rotten&#148;&#146;  (Judd, 416). According to Best:<blockquote>[Landau] was put through a proper interrogation. &hellip; He was quite ready to quit and he told us all about the conspiracy being run by Tinsley and Laurence Oppenheim over the &#145;black book&#146;. He said that they got millions out of the Dutch business people by threatening to have them put on the black book unless they paid for their names to be omitted. (Payne Best MSS)</blockquote>Despite these revelations Landau was permitted to return to Rotterdam and Cumming declined to take action against Tinsley, who survived a second investigation some months later and was said to have ended the war &pound;200,000 richer.<br>
<br>After the war Landau joined Best on the inter-allied intelligence commission in Brussels, with responsibility for awarding medals and compensating the families of agents captured and executed. In August 1919 the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> carried the names of almost 1400 of Landau's former agents, and the same month saw the creation of a new passport control department, providing diplomatic cover for Cumming's agents abroad. Landau was assigned to Berlin as senior passport control officer for Germany, a job that he knew to be &#145;one of the most important posts in the post-war British Secret Service re-organisation&#146;  (Henry Landau, curriculum vitae). However, Landau quickly got into serious financial difficulties and was obliged to resign from the secret service in 1920  (Jeffery, 193&#150;4).<br>
<br>Landau became foreign representative for John Brown and Company, the Glasgow shipbuilders. Based in Berlin, he was responsible for tracking down patents and inventions which could be useful, travelling through France, Belgium, Holland, Austria, and Hungary, and doing freelance work for Cumming &#145;on odd occasions&#146;  (Landau, <span class="italic">All's Fair</span>, 251, 258). In August 1923 Landau got married, but then, according to Best, he &#145;went wrong&#146; while working as a representative of the Royal Packet Steamship Company in Budapest. In October 1925 he told his wife that he was going on a business trip, and simply disappeared, Best hearing later that he had staged his own suicide, taking with him all the money he could find. Landau eventually resurfaced in the United States, working as a teacher and in 1928 applying for US citizenship.<br>
<br>In 1933 Landau became a US citizen, and began working as an investigator on the US compensation claim against Germany, before the Mixed Claims Commission. Based in Europe, his job was to search for evidence of wartime sabotage by the German secret service in the USA, but the British secret service cautiously informed its European officers that, although they had employed Landau during the war, his conduct &#145;has since been unsatisfactory and contact or communication with him should be avoided&#146;  (Jeffery, 244). In 1934 Landau caused further animosity by publishing a detailed memoir, <span class="italic">All's Fair: the Story of the British Secret Service behind the German Lines</span>, followed in 1935 by <span class="italic">Secrets of the White Lady</span>, dealing with La Dame Blanche.<br>
<br>The British secret service was particularly concerned that one of the agents described in <span class="italic">All's Fair</span> was still working in Germany, and when he was arrested and executed in October 1939 they blamed Landau. There had been plans to threaten Landau with the <span class="roman">Official Secrets Act</span> if he tried to republish <span class="italic">All's Fair</span> in Britain, and when the United States entered the war in December 1941, some attempt was apparently made to have him arrested. But there was never any firm evidence that his revelations had compromised operations, and he continued in his job as an investigator for the US Federal Works Agency, looking after public construction projects. From 1943 he spent three years as an investigator for the US Maritime Commission, and in 1946 he went into business as an importer. Landau married, for a second time, in the USA, and had children. He retired to Florida and died in Chilapa, Mexico, in May 1968.<br>
