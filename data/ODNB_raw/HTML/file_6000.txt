<span class="headword">Colton,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1404), <span class="occ">archbishop of Armagh and justiciar of Ireland</span>, was born at Terrington, Norfolk. Chaplain by 1343 to William Bateman, bishop of Norwich, Colton became doctor of canon law at Cambridge <i>c</i>.1348. In June 1349 he was made first warden of Gonville Hall, founded by Edmund Gonville, rector of Terrington. He succeeded his patron in Terrington from 1350 to 1351, retaining his post at Gonville until 1360. He was collated on 14 August 1377 to the prebend of Bugthorpe, York, exchanged (1380) for the prebend of Coton in St Mary's royal free chapel, Stafford. Colton's Irish connection dates from at least 1361, when, described as chamberlain to the late archbishop of Armagh (Richard Fitzralph), he was papally provided to the treasurership of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. He was certainly in residence by the early 1370s, and described as dean of St Patrick's before October 1373. Other Irish preferments included the prebend of Clashmore in Lismore diocese.<br>
<br>Colton's appointment as treasurer of Ireland on 2 September 1372 is unlikely to have been his first administrative office. He gained considerable military experience in the lordship's defence, particularly in Leinster, and on occasion personally funded emergency troops. He subsequently accounted as treasurer, from 1372 until September 1375. In May 1378 Colton went to England where, in December, he undertook to answer charges laid by Nicholas Dagworth. Appointed chancellor on 8 May 1380, he remained in office until 15 February 1382, although his successor, William Tany, was named on 26 November 1381. He was with the lieutenant, Edmund (III) Mortimer, earl of March, when the earl's sudden death in Cork in December 1381 caused an emergency. Colton reluctantly and conditionally accepted the post of justiciar in January 1382 and successfully defended Cork. He resigned the office on 3 March 1382 and went immediately to England. After Archbishop Sweetman's death in August 1380, he initially had charge of the temporalities of Armagh, and was himself promoted to the archbishopric by papal provision in January 1381. He was consecrated in London on 8 March 1383.<br>
<br>As archbishop Colton did not again hold administrative office. He used his influence in the defence of the lordship, helping, for example, in negotiations to buy off the menace of the &Oacute; Raghallaigh family in Meath in 1391&#150;2. Richard II wrote to him (letter undated) thanking him for his service in the lordship. During the royal expedition to Ireland, 1394&#150;5, Colton played a key role in the submission of the Ulster Irish, as evident in surviving letters from &Oacute; N&eacute;ill and &Oacute; Cath&aacute;in to him and from the Ulster Irish to Richard II. He was absent on the king's business in Rome from 12 August 1398 to 8 September 1399, including the period of Richard's second Irish expedition. In 1401 he accompanied the archbishop of Dublin as envoy to Henry IV with a plea from the Irish council for aid for the lordship. During this visit Irish letters patent of 1333 were exemplified, confirming the primacy of Armagh.<br>
<br>Colton succeeded in establishing Armagh's claim to the Blackpriory of St Andrew in the Ards in September 1392, a grant confirmed three times within the decade. A notarial copy of his metropolitan visitation of Derry in October 1397 provides a rare record of conditions within an Irish diocese in the late fourteenth century. In 1398, to augment the impoverished <i>mensa</i> of the archbishop, he was granted the patronage of St James's, Athboy, in the diocese of Meath. He participated in enquiries concerning the life and miracles of Archbishop Fitzralph. Colton died on 27 April 1404 in Drogheda, Meath, having shortly before resigned his see, and was buried in St Peter's, Drogheda. His episcopal register does not survive, although a few relevant documents are found in the register of his successor, Archbishop Swayne.<br>
<br>Colton had a reputation for learning and wrote two treatises, not extant, on the papal schism: <span class="italic">De causis schismatis</span> and <span class="italic">De remediis ejusdem</span>.<br>
