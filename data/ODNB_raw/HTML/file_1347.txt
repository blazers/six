<span class="headword">Barclay,  Robert, of Ury</span>  (1648&#150;1690), <span class="occ">religious writer and colonial governor</span>, was born at Gordonstown, Moray, on 23 December 1648, the eldest of the five children of <a name="cosubject_1339"></a><span class="headword">David Barclay of Ury</span>  (1610&#150;1686), <span class="occ">soldier and politician</span>, and Katherine Gordon (1620&#150;1663), daughter of Sir Robert Gordon of Gordonstown. David Barclay was born in 1610 at Kirktownhill, Mearns, the son of David Barclay, the laird of Mathers (1580&#150;1660), and Elizabeth Livingston. David Barclay of Mathers overspent at court and lost his estates to creditors, prompting his son David and grandson Robert to devote considerable energies to restoring the family fortunes. Following his education, possibly at local schools between about 1616 and 1626, David Barclay became a professional soldier; from 1626 he served in Germany, eventually rising to the rank of major under Gustavus Adolphus in the Thirty Years' War before returning to Scotland in 1638 on the eve of the civil wars. He served in covenanting armies for the next decade, becoming colonel of a horse regiment under General John (afterwards first earl of) Middleton. David Barclay and Katherine Gordon were married on 26 January 1648. She was third cousin to Charles I, and about the time of the wedding Barclay began to veer to the royalist side. Later in 1648 he purchased the ruinous estate of Ury (also Urie) near Stonehaven, 15 miles from Aberdeen, from William Keith, seventh Earl Marischal, but he would remain in Gordonstown until 1665. Barclay supported the Scottish engagement with the king, for which he was made to do penance when the kirk party returned to power, and seems not to have participated in resisting the English invasion of 1650. Marischal did resist, and after the conquest all properties associated with him were forfeited, including Ury. David Barclay ingratiated himself with the English, however, and was appointed trustee of lands forfeited by royalists. He used that position and his subsequent election to the Cromwellian parliaments of 1654 and 1656 to win back Ury for himself while protecting and promoting Marischal's interests.<h2>
<a name="Conversions"></a>Conversions</h2>David Barclay could see early on that his son Robert was &#145;very Ambitious of Knowledge&#146;  (Barclay, <span class="italic">Truth Triumphant</span>, 678). Robert later recalled that he was first schooled locally &#145;by the strictest Sort of Calvinists&#146;, but with the Cromwellian regime crumbling and the prospect of renewed civil war looming, in 1659 the ten-year-old was sent to Paris to be educated by his uncle and namesake, Robert Barclay, rector of the Scots Theological College  (ibid.). Young Robert flourished in Paris, perfecting his French and Latin, honing his debating skills, and winning book prizes from his tutors. He also converted to Catholicism (&#145;I became quickly defiled with the Pollutions thereof&#146;, he subsequently wrote), much to the horror of his mother  (ibid.). As Katherine Gordon lay dying in March 1663 she begged her husband to bring Robert, not yet fifteen, back to Scotland and protestantism. The uncle offered to make Robert his heir if he would remain in Paris, but that summer he returned to Scotland with his father. Robert Barclay promptly renounced the Catholic church and would remain hostile to it (though not to individual Catholics) for the rest of his life. That early association, however, helped fuel conspiracy theories to the effect that Quakers in general, and Barclay in particular, were really papists in disguise.<br>
<br>In August 1665 David Barclay was committed to Edinburgh Castle at the behest of enemies resentful of his dealings during the interregnum. He shared a cell for a time with John Swinton, a fellow Scottish MP under Cromwell who had turned Quaker in 1657. David Barclay declared himself a Quaker in March 1666. Prison officials strove to keep Robert Barclay away from his father and Swinton, but their brief visits culminated in his own conversion to Quakerism early in the winter of 1666&#150;7, about the time of his eighteenth birthday. His ability to articulate the Quaker experience was immediately apparent, and his first evangelizing trip took him to the north of Scotland with Swinton and George Keith in May 1667. Soon after, his father sent him to live at Ury, where he immediately established a weekly Quaker meeting. David Barclay was released from prison in 1669 and set about building a new manor house at Ury and (contrary to the terms of his release) an adjacent Quaker meeting-house.<br>
<br>In February 1670 Robert Barclay married Christian Molleson (<i>c</i>.1651&#150;1724), daughter of Margaret Smith, one of Aberdeen's first Quaker converts, and Gilbert Molleson, a merchant and a magistrate on the town council that persecuted Quakers. The couple were married in her father's house (her mother having died the year before): it was the first Quaker wedding in Aberdeen and was attended by no minister, a throng of Quakers inside, and a mob of scandalized Aberdonians outside. The couple raised three sons and four daughters, and were considered exemplary parents. Their eldest son, also Robert Barclay (1672&#150;1747), succeeded to Ury on the death of his father and married Elizabeth Brain, daughter of a London merchant, while the second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37149/', "David Barclay (1682&#150;1769)")</script>, became a London merchant himself and grew rich in the American trade. All seven children were alive in 1740 for the fiftieth anniversary of their father's death.<h2>
<a name="RobertBarclayasauthor"></a>Robert Barclay as author</h2>By the 1670s there were only a few hundred Quakers in Scotland, mainly in and around Aberdeen. Small numbers did not save them from persecution at the hands of the authorities; nor did it prevent Scottish Quakers, led by Robert Barclay, from having a disproportionately large impact on the 60,000-strong international Quaker movement. It was the need to combat persecution that drove Barclay to write the books that became the definitive statement of the Quaker faith for upwards of two centuries. Barclay was only thirty when the persecution of Scottish Quakers ended in 1679, but he published very little after that date.<br>
<br>In 1672 Barclay felt called by God to walk through the streets of Aberdeen in sackcloth as a call to repentance. By then, however, he had already started to publish Quaker tracts, and no further such spectacles were required of him. He was a charismatic speaker and a gifted controversialist in person and on paper, and his talents (and his gentry pedigree) quickly drew the attention of Quaker leaders in England. Indeed, Barclay soon emerged as a leader in the campaign to transform Quakerism from a loose, ecstatic movement into a tight, disciplined sect. The intensely personal, experiential nature of Quakerism militated against an official creed, but mainstream Quakers facing persecution needed a way to dissociate themselves from their more extreme members and from the wilder accusations of their enemies. To win toleration, the Quakers had to convince the authorities that they and their beliefs were tolerable. The Quaker counter-offensive was led on the literary front by Robert Barclay, his friend and mentor George Keith, and William Penn; and on the diplomatic front by Penn and Barclay.<br>
<br>Barclay and Keith, who was ten years older, worked closely together. Keith defected to the Church of England after Barclay died and claimed, correctly, that Barclay borrowed much from Keith's early work, including his cavalier way with patristic sources. Nevertheless, it was Barclay's work that was regarded as definitive by friend and foe alike, particularly his distinctive doctrine concerning inward and immediate revelation and the universal saving light. His most important works were all completed before he turned twenty-eight, beginning with the <span class="italic">Catechism and Confession of Faith</span> in 1673. This was followed by <span class="italic">Theses theologicae</span> in 1674, a fifteen-point statement of Quaker principles accompanied by Barclay's challenge to debate these with &#145;clergy, of what sort soever&#146;  (Barclay, <span class="italic">Truth Triumphant</span>, 259). This sparked lengthy correspondence with a number of continental clerics, and led in April 1675 to a rowdy public debate in Aberdeen between Barclay and Keith, on the one hand, and three overmatched postgraduate divinity students on the other. It was all grist for Barclay's mill while he was writing <span class="italic">An Apology for the True Christian Divinity</span>, an elaborate defence of the <span class="italic">Theses</span> completed in November 1675. The <span class="italic">Apology</span> was composed and first published in Latin in 1676. With a boldness that seems to have endeared him to the Stuart kings, Barclay opened the book with a plea for toleration addressed to Charles II and written in direct and somewhat admonitory language much admired by Voltaire, among others. The <span class="italic">Apology</span> appeared in English in 1678, and has since been reprinted many times and in many languages. Robert Barclay's reputation among Quakers has waxed and waned, but the <span class="italic">Apology</span> remains the classic statement of Quaker principles, and few would dispute Leslie Stephen's judgement in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> that the book is &#145;impressive in style; grave, logical, and often marked by the eloquence of lofty moral convictions&#146;.<br>
<br>Barclay was not writing for posterity, however, but from an urgent need to win respect and tolerance for his people. In Restoration Scotland legislation directed against conventicling presbyterians also applied to Quaker men, who were arrested for attending their outlawed meetings and kept in prison when they refused to pay their fines or swear an oath to desist. Robert Barclay was imprisoned briefly in Montrose in 1672 but remained at liberty for the next four years. In addition to his writing, he continued to travel on Quaker business. He attended his first yearly meeting at London in 1673. In 1676 Barclay was again in London, just back from his first tour of Quaker outposts in the Netherlands and Germany, when he learned that his father and nearly every adult male Quaker in the north-east of Scotland had been imprisoned in the Aberdeen tolbooth. David Barclay, the old politician, advised his son to seek an audience with the duke of Lauderdale, but the duke proved unhelpful. In Germany Robert Barclay had met and befriended Elisabeth, princess palatine of the Rhine, and though she resisted the lure of Quakerism she asked her brother Prince Rupert to intercede with the king on behalf of the Aberdonian prisoners; however, Rupert did nothing. In Edinburgh, on his way back to Ury and certain imprisonment, Barclay made the Quaker case to the Scottish privy council, but again to no avail. He was imprisoned in Aberdeen from November 1676 to April 1677 with as many as forty other Quakers. When the overcrowding was at its worst, several &eacute;lite prisoners, including the Barclays and George Keith, were moved to a disused chapel on the outskirts of town. The single tiny window made reading and writing difficult, but Robert Barclay and Keith kept up their voluminous writing and correspondence. Barclay's treatise <span class="italic">Universal Love</span> (1677) was composed in prison, as was a letter summarizing his most important ideas, published as &#145;The possibility and necessity of inward and immediate revelation&#146; in <span class="italic">Truth Triumphant</span> (1692).<h2>
<a name="Colonialambitions"></a>Colonial ambitions</h2>Robert Barclay, David Barclay, and George Keith were released in the spring of 1677, but most of the other Aberdeen Quakers remained in prison. David Barclay settled into vigorous old age at Ury, where he died of a fever about 10 October 1686 and was buried on 12 October. Robert Barclay attended the yearly meeting in London in 1677 and stayed on to lobby on behalf of his colleagues in Aberdeen. He had two hopeful meetings with the duke of York (afterwards James II) at which they discussed the Quaker prisoners and Penn's colonial plans. In July and August of 1677 Robert Barclay returned to the Netherlands and Germany on a celebrated missionary tour with Penn, Keith, and George Fox. Upon his return, he met with York again. Accepting the duke's sincerity but sensing his lassitude, Barclay urged him to speak firmly to Lauderdale on behalf of Quakers. York seemed to like Barclay despite his forwardness (according to Keith, Barclay&#151;unlike Penn&#151;would not bow, even for royals), but merely offered a letter granting him and his father immunity. Barclay considered attendance at court &#145;drugery&#146;, but his connection with the future king proved beneficial  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Barclaianae</span>, 68). The Aberdeen Quakers were finally set free in November 1679, coincident with the duke of York's arrival in Edinburgh, and Barclay grudgingly acknowledged that &#145;tho' not for several years, yet at last [the duke's] interposing proved very helpful&#146;  (ibid., 67&#150;8).<br>
<br>Robert Barclay continued to preach and travel on behalf of Quakers, but no longer wrote for publication. He spent time with his family and saw to his financial affairs, which began to improve after Charles II restored Ury to the status of a free barony, complete with criminal and civil jurisdiction, in 1679. The final decade of his short life, however, was mainly spent promoting Quaker colonial enterprises and Scottish emigration. Fox and Penn counted on Barclay's ready access to the duke of York in Edinburgh to help steer Penn's colonial plans through the murky political waters of the early 1680s: as proprietor of New York, James had to be part of any agreement. Barclay attracted a circle of wealthy Scottish investors, but advised Penn that Pennsylvania land prices were too high: &#145;thou has land enough, so need not be a churl&#146;  (<span class="italic">Papers of William Penn</span>, 1.132). Barclay and the Scots preferred to invest in East and West New Jersey, and in 1682 the proprietors of East New Jersey, mainly Quakers and friends of the duke, appointed Barclay governor for life.<br>
<br>Robert Barclay accepted the governorship of East New Jersey on condition that he did not have to go there, but he was a tireless advocate for the colony. His brothers John and David emigrated, the latter dying on the way. Barclay worked hard to attract Scottish settlers, casting his promotional net as far as Belfast. He won the right to transport covenanters and religious prisoners, and probably wrote the unsigned broadsheets advertising the colony. His powers of personal persuasion were such that a young man visiting Aberdeen in 1684 was apparently so taken by Barclay's sales pitch that he immediately boarded and set sail for the New World, without telling his family. Upwards of 700 Scots, mainly from the north-east, moved to East New Jersey in the 1680s, but immigration slumped after 1690 with the fall of James II and the death of Barclay.<br>
<br>Laird of Ury since his father's death in 1686, Robert Barclay made his last trip to London in 1688 when he presented his eldest son, Robert, at court. His last visit to King James came just as William of Orange was expected in England. After James fled, Barclay retired to a quiet life at Ury. He died there of a fever on 3 October 1690, aged forty-one, and three days later was buried beside his father on the estate. As a final tribute from the Quaker leadership, his complete works were gathered and published in 1692 under the title <span class="italic">Truth Triumphant</span>.<br>
