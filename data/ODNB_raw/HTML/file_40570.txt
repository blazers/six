<span class="headword">Bathurst,  Ann</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1638, <em>d.</em> in or before 1704), <span class="occ">diarist and prophet</span>, is of unknown parentage. What little is known of her origins is found in the eight-page autobiography that begins her two-volume diary, &#145;Rhapsodical Meditations and Visions&#146;, a manuscript that covers the period 17 March 1679 to 21 October 1696  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. D 1262, 1263). Her parents were pious and taught their daughter by &#145;their precept and example&#146; to cultivate a religious disposition  (Bathurst, &#145;Meditations&#146;, 1.2). As a girl she enjoyed listening to sermons, reading the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and praying with her sister Elizabeth, but she also developed an acute sense of her own sinfulness. About 1659, when she was eighteen, she fell into a dangerous illness and for six months suffered from extreme religious turmoil, out of which began her lifelong regime of spiritual enquiry.<br>
<br>It is not known when Bathurst began to associate with the prophet Jane Lead and her circle, but like Lead's diary <span class="italic">Fountain of Gardens</span> (1697), Bathurst's diary resonates with ideas, adapted from Jakob Boehme, regarding the transformative role which the Virgin Wisdom was to play in the coming of the New Jerusalem. On 26 May 1684, Bathurst writes: &#145;This morning I found such a sweet overshadowing from sweet Sophia, the Virgin Spouse of the Soul, as if she were come to cohabite with me&#146;  (Bathurst, &#145;Meditations&#146;, 1.216). By 1697, when the Philadelphian Society was founded by Jane Lead and her spiritual son Francis Lee, Bathurst was considered one of its prophets, and its meetings were first held every Sunday at Bathurst's house in Baldwins Gardens, London. The Philadelphians developed millennial prophecies based on the promise in <span class="roman">Revelation</span> 12 that a woman clothed with the sun would appear as a great wonder in the heavens, labouring to be delivered of a child. Bathurst's diary documents her daily study of the great mystery of spiritual impregnation and her ongoing labour to give birth to a new reality. On 3 July 1693, she writes typically:<blockquote>I am as if some strange thing had happened unto me to be held many hours in that travel [travail] since the inconceivable conception that has been upon me twelve hours, first as I said in the womb, then in the heart, then in the head. I have felt for some time since some moving of travel between my breasts as some new manifestation. (Bathurst, &#145;Another volume&#146;)</blockquote>For Bathurst, the production of a glorified body was to be a collective, as well as an individual, labour. She meditated with a small community of spiritual sisters, identified in the diary only by initials and feminine pronouns, but who certainly included Mrs Joanna Openbridge with whom Bathurst lived at Baldwins Gardens. The women not only enjoyed singing and praying together, but on occasion, collaborated in vision production. That Bathurst's visions served to inspire others is indicated by the fact that entries from her diaries, dating from 11 June to 19 September 1679, were copied by several hands, into a large journal, still extant in the Bodleian Library  (MS Rawl. D 1338).<br>
<br>During the period 1697&#150;1700, as the Philadelphian movement expanded, its meetings became crowded and were frequently disrupted by disagreements. Owing to Mrs Bathurst's frail health, the meeting at Baldwins Gardens was the first to revert to being a small gathering of the spiritually initiated. The Philadelphian movement eventually petered out after Jane Lead's death in 1704. In a vision recorded by Richard Roach at the time, Lead descends from heaven to tell him that he should take her place as the leader of the Philadelphian movement, &#145;that upon the death of Mrs. Bathurst it being needful somebody should strike in her Place for the Support of the Meeting at B.G. [Baldwins Gardens]&#146; (Roach, 2.117; Thune, 136). Roach's vision suggests that Lead may have considered Bathurst as her successor, and that Bathurst may have died just before or about the same time as Lead.<br>
