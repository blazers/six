<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Trinder,  Thomas Edward <span class="st"> [Tommy]</span></span>  (1909&#150;1989), <span class="occ">comedian</span>, was born on 24 March 1909 in Streatham, London, the eldest in the family of two sons and one daughter of Thomas Henry Trinder, tram driver and baker, and his wife, Jean Mills. Educated at Queensborough Road School and St Andrew's, Holborn, he left school early to work as an errand boy at Smithfield meat market. Giving up his job at the age of twelve he toured South Africa with a variety company, and then in the following year, 1922, he won a talent competition at Collins's Music Hall, Islington, which led to a week's engagement. He worked in a touring show, Will Murray's Casey's Court, using the name Red Nirt (his own surname backwards) and played the halls for seventeen years before reaching the London Palladium in 1939 in <span class="italic">Band Waggon</span>. For the next eleven years he played there regularly, first as a supporting act in <span class="italic">Top of the World</span> (1940), with Bud Flanagan and Chesney Allen, and <span class="italic">Gangway</span> (1941), with Ben Lyon and Bebe Daniels, and then topping the bill in <span class="italic">Best Bib and Tucker</span> (1942), <span class="italic">Happy and Glorious</span> (1944&#150;6), which with 938 performances became the longest running of all Palladium shows, <span class="italic">Here, there and everywhere</span> (1947), and <span class="italic">Starlight Rendezvous</span> (1950).<br>
<br>Trinder had a long, thin face, a jutting chin, and a wide smile; he always wore a trilby hat, even with evening dress. Soon after he arrived at the Palladium, he invested &pound;265 a week for two weeks to advertise his chin on twenty-five strategically sited London hoardings. All but one read: &#145;If it's laughter you're after, Trinder's the name. You lucky people!&#146; The odd one out, opposite Aldgate station, was printed in Hebrew. With his shovel-like jaw, ready grin, quick-fire topical humour, and &#145;You lucky people&#146; catch-phrase, he became one of the most popular of variety entertainers.<br>
<br>Trinder's film career began in 1939, but it was not until his fifth film, <span class="italic">Sailors Three</span> (1940), with Claude Hulbert and Michael Wilding, that he made a mark. Of his fifteen films, <span class="italic">The Foreman Went to France</span> (1941), <span class="italic">The Bells Go Down</span> (1943), and <span class="italic">Champagne Charlie</span> (1944), in which he played Victorian music-hall star George Leybourne, are the most notable.<br>
<br>In 1943 Trinder was singled out in the House of Commons for criticism for not having worked overseas for Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), a criticism which ignored the fact that he had been entertaining troops at home since the outbreak of war. He later became the first major star to visit Italy and in 1946 took the last ENSA party to the Far East. It was Trinder who gave ENSA its sobriquet &#145;Every Night Something Awful&#146;. Trinder holds a record unlikely to be beaten of playing the most West End theatres in a single night. During the London blitz, when audiences had to remain in their seats during air raids and Trinder was at the Palladium, he drove round the West End and managed to play a ten-minute spot in seventeen theatres before the all-clear sounded.<br>
<br>Known as the Mr Woolworth of show business, Trinder could sometimes be earthy, though never crude, and he hated bad language. When he arrived at Scapa Flow to entertain the Royal Navy he found the padre sitting with his back to the stage watching the audience to see who laughed. He invariably worked alone without the aid of stooges, props, or even a microphone, and frequently without a script, relying on his ready wit. He was noted for his ability to deal with hecklers. When he opened his act at the Embassy Club with his usual &#145;Trinder's the name&#146;, a morose Orson Welles, having that day been divorced from Rita Hayworth, growled &#145;Well, change it&#146;, to which Trinder retorted &#145;Is that an offer of marriage?&#146;<br>
<br>In 1955 Trinder became the first host of <span class="italic">Sunday Night at the London Palladium</span>, one of the most successful television variety shows. He fell out with producer Val Parnell and left the show; his career, although he rarely stopped working, became a series of one-night stands, overseas tours, and pantomimes in the provinces. A firm favourite of the royal family, he appeared before the queen mother at the 1980 royal variety show, in what must have been the oldest chorus line, when thirteen artists, including Arthur Askey, Stanley Holloway, Richard Murdoch, Chesney Allen, and Trinder, with a combined age of 891 years, danced and sang their way through Flanagan and Allen's &#145;Strollin&#146;.<br>
<br>A lifelong supporter of Fulham Football Club, Trinder was on its board for many years, becoming chairman in 1955, a post he held for twenty-one years despite being forced to apologize publicly for cracking jokes at his players' expense. He was appointed CBE in 1975 for his services to charity (he was thrice chief rat of the show business charity the Water Rats). He married Gwyn (Toni), daughter of Major Gilbert Arthur Lancelyn Green, of the Royal Field Artillery. There was one daughter of the marriage. He died on 10 July 1989 in St Peter's Hospital, Chertsey, Surrey.<br>
