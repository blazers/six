<span class="headword">Otway,  Thomas</span>  (1616&#150;1693), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Ossory</span>, was born at Alderbury, Wiltshire, on 1 November 1616, the son of George Otway, Church of England clergyman. He was educated at Winchester College, and was admitted a sizar of Christ's College, Cambridge, his father's old college, on 13 June 1632, &#145;aged 15&#146;. He graduated BA in 1636 and MA in 1639, afterwards taking the degree of DD at Trinity College, Dublin. He subsequently became chaplain to Sir Ralph Hopton, and an active civil war royalist. He was taken prisoner during the war and banished to the West Indies, where he remained until the Restoration. On his return to England, he was at once marked out for preferment. He was rector of St Botolph, Billingsgate (June 1663&#150;June 1664), and of Etchingham, Sussex (June 1664&#150;1670). He never married.<br>
<br>In 1670 Otway became chaplain to John, first Baron Berkeley of Stratton, who took Otway with him to Ireland when he was made lord lieutenant. Lord Berkeley procured Otway's promotion to the see of Killala by patent dated 16 November in the same year. He was consecrated in Christ Church, Dublin, on 29 January 1671. As bishop of Killala he encountered opposition from Presbyterians and tories. He was translated to the see of Ossory by patent dated 7 February 1680, in spite of the objections raised against him on the grounds that he had executed a tory in his own house without legal warrant. He received <i>in commendam</i> the archdeaconry of Armagh and a rectory attached to it. In February 1686 the earl of Clarendon advocated his promotion to the see of Cashel, but his advice was not acted upon; no Church of Ireland episcopal vacancies were filled during James II's reign.<br>
<br>In May 1689 Otway sat in James II's Irish parliament, one of four Church of Ireland bishops in the House of Lords. After the battle of the Boyne, William ordered his suspension (21 July 1690) for his refusal to pray for the new monarchy. Otway, however, succeeded in laying the blame on the dean and chapter, and the suspension was never enforced; but shortly afterwards he declared that he had seen no sufficient justification for the late revolution, that James II was still lawful king, and no power of pope or people could dethrone him, and, recalling the persecutions he had suffered under Cromwell, professed his readiness, in spite of his advanced age, to undergo the same again. However, by November 1690 he could tell Bishop Anthony Dopping of Meath that he had resolved &#145;on a cheerful obedience to the present powers&#146;  (McGuire, 148). In October 1692 he sat in William's House of Lords, and was still in possession of his see when he died on 6 March 1693. He was buried in his cathedral church of St Canice, Kilkenny, near the west door, and over his grave was erected a marble stone with an inscription to his memory.<br>
<br>By his will, dated 8 December 1692, besides his legacy to Christ's College, Cambridge, and numerous other benefactions, Otway bequeathed &pound;200 to Trinity College, Dublin, and a like sum to build a library in the churchyard of St Canice, Kilkenny, of which his own books were to form the nucleus. The library was incorporated during Anne's reign.<br>
