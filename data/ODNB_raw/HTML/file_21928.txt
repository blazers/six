<span class="headword">Percy,  Henry</span>, first Lord Percy  (1273&#150;1314), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21927/', "Sir Henry de Percy (d. 1272)")</script> and his wife, Eleanor. Born after his father's death, at Petworth, Sussex, about 25 March 1273, he had succeeded his elder brother, John, as heir before 11 June 1294. He married Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1328), sister of Sir Richard Arundel, with whom he had two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21929/', "Henry Percy")</script> and William (<i>d</i>. 1355).<br>
<br>After taking part in the Welsh expedition of 1294 Percy began a decade of active involvement in the Scottish wars of Edward I. He served during the siege of Berwick and on its capture was knighted by Edward I on 30 March 1296. He fought at the battle of Dunbar on 27 April 1296. From then on he was one of Edward I's leading commanders. In September 1296 he was made warden of Galloway and Ayrshire and justiciar in Dumfries, offices he was to hold during several periods in the years that followed. In July 1297 he was one of the English lords who received the submission of Scottish prelates and nobles. After the defeat of John de Warenne, earl of Surrey (<i>d</i>. 1304), at Stirling Bridge in September 1297, together with Robert, Lord Clifford, he raised forces for the invasion planned to restore the English position. In 1298 he was one of six English magnates who furnished 500 heavy cavalry for Scotland, his share being fifty. He took part in the siege of Caerlaverock in 1300. On 5 April 1306 he was appointed the king's lieutenant and captain of all men-at-arms, both horse and foot, in the counties of Lancaster, Westmorland, Cumberland, Ayr, Wigtown, Dumfries, and the whole of Galloway to repulse the rebellion of Robert I. He and his retinue were in the army that Edward I was leading when he died at Burgh-on-Sands on 7 July 1307.<br>
<br>The record of his services in the Scottish wars demonstrates that Percy was one of Edward I's principal commanders, second only to a few leading earls. His rewards were commensurate with the scale of his services. On 20 February 1299 he was granted all the estates in both England and Scotland that had belonged to Ingelram de Balliol, a cousin, deceased, apparently because the heir was a rebel. Apart from two manors in England, this grant brought Percy the barony of Urr and Red Castle in Angus. In 1304 he received the earldom of Buchan. His tenure of this was short-lived, since the Scottish earl returned to the allegiance of Edward I. Recompense for the loss of Buchan, however, was handsome and also a testimony to the importance of his services. In, perhaps, April 1306 he was granted the earldom of Carrick forfeited by the rebellion of Robert I. According to the contemporary chronicler Walter of Guisborough in February 1307 (or thereabouts) Percy was besieged by Robert in Turnberry Castle until relieved by a force led by Edward I. For a time, therefore, he controlled at least part of his earldom of Carrick.<br>
<br>Both his status as a leading baron and his involvement in the Scottish ambitions of Edward I meant that Percy was bound to have an active role in the period of crisis that followed the accession of Edward II. At the beginning of the reign he appears to have been on good terms with the king and his favourite, Piers Gaveston. On 16 June 1308 he was one of the small group before whom a number of letters patent to Gaveston's advantage were read out and sealed by the king; these included the grant of the earldom of Cornwall. At some point thereafter he joined the opposition to the court. While not himself one of the lords ordainer, on 5 October 1311 he was one of the group of councillors who announced the ordinances of reform to the people in the churchyard of St Paul's. His motives for supporting the cause of reform can only be conjectured, but it is reasonable to assume that he saw the need for peace in the kingdom in the light of the collapse of the English position in Scotland, a matter in which he had a substantial vested interest. Indeed, unlike most of the magnates who were later allies, he had responded to the king's summons to meet him at Northampton the previous August in order to proceed against Robert I. However, from October 1311 onwards he was a trusted ally of the ordainers, as the grants he received during their period of control demonstrate. On 20 March 1311 he was granted the keepership of the temporalities of the bishopric of Durham. On 2 December 1311 he was made justice of the forests beyond Trent and on 18 December keeper of Bamburgh Castle.<br>
<br>Percy remained steadfast to the ordainers' cause after Edward II's revocation of the ordinances and his rehabilitation of Gaveston, events that led to his loss of the justiceship of the forests beyond Trent and his replacement by Gaveston. He played an important part in the plan to capture Gaveston, the northern of the four zones into which the kingdom was divided for this purpose being entrusted to him and Roger Clifford. Together with the earls of Pembroke and Surrey he besieged Gaveston in Scarborough Castle and received his surrender on 19 May 1312. He took no part in Gaveston's execution. Although his lands were then seized, he was a beneficiary of the eventual settlement between Edward II and his opponents, being pardoned on 16 October 1313.<br>
<br>From the point of view of Percy himself, and from that of his family's fortunes in succeeding decades and centuries, the most important event in his career was his acquisition of the castle and barony of Alnwick in Northumberland. This estate was conveyed to Percy by Antony (I) Bek, bishop of Durham (<i>d</i>. 1311), by a charter dated 19 November 1309; but the transaction must have been a more complicated one than this grant suggests, since in an agreement of 1 April 1310 the bishop had a right of repurchase until the following Michaelmas. According to a contemporary source Bek held the estate in trust for William, an illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28255/', "William de Vescy (d. 1297)")</script>, the last Vescy lord of Alnwick, but there is no convincing evidence in support of this story. And there is nothing to suggest that, if fraud did occur, Percy was a party to it. He apparently paid a market price, possibly assisted by a loan from Italian merchants (the Bellardi of Lucca). His acquisition of this estate laid the foundations of his family's position on the borders with Scotland. He himself became the leading landowner, lay or ecclesiastical, in Northumberland. Although there is no direct evidence of his motivation, it is a fair inference from the circumstances of his career that the acquisition of Alnwick resulted from his involvement in the Scottish wars (which must have led to close contacts with Antony Bek). In 1309 the hope of recovering his gains in Scotland must have been a real one. The castle and barony of Alnwick would provide both a staging post between Scotland and his estates in Yorkshire and a base for his involvement in further warfare in Scotland.<br>
<br>Percy died between 2 and 10 October 1314, within twelve months of the royal pardon for his part in the events that led to the death of Gaveston. It is reasonable to suppose that he was already ill when he received his summons to the campaign that was to end in the defeat at Bannockburn, since there is no evidence of his presence there. He was buried at Fountains Abbey, and was eventually succeeded by his eldest son, Henry.<br>
