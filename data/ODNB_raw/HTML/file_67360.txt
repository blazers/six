<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Young,  John Zachary</span>  (1907&#150;1997), <span class="occ">zoologist</span>, known universally as J. Z., was born at Fishponds, Bristol, on 18 March 1907, the first of three sons and two daughters of Philip Young (1878&#150;1965), engineer, and his wife, Constance Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lloyd (1875&#150;1955), schoolteacher. A great-great-grandfather, Richard, was brother to Thomas Young (1773&#150;1829), physician, physicist, and hieroglyphist. Other distinguished scientific relations, from his mother's side, were Luke Howard (1772&#150;1864), meteorologist, great-great-grandfather to Sir Alan Hodgkin (1914&#150;1998), neuroscientist, and father of John Eliot Howard (1807&#150;1883), quinologist. Although on both sides many of his family were Quakers, Young's parents brought him up in an Anglo-Catholic tradition. Bishop Charles Gore was his godfather. He left religious belief during the Oxford Moral Re-Armament movement of the 1930s, but retained a lifelong interest in philosophy and ethics. Much of this thinking was expressed in the Reith lectures for 1950 and in the last of his nine books, <span class="italic">Philosophy and the Brain</span> (1987).<br>
<br>His mother taught Young until he was nine years old, then he was sent to board at Wells House, Malvern Wells, Worcestershire. At thirteen he entered Marlborough College. In 1925 he became a demy at Magdalen College, Oxford, whence he graduated in 1928 with first-class honours in zoology. Successive college and university appointments followed, and in 1943 he was elected vice-president of Magdalen. In 1945, having failed to succeed Edwin Stephen Goodrich in the Oxford zoology chair, he accepted that of human anatomy at University College, London. There he stayed until his retirement in 1974. For the next twenty-three years he was based at the Wellcome Foundation and, later, in the psychology department, Oxford. During this time he continued to research and lecture, and published two books on neural mechanisms.<br>
<br>Between 1929 and 1945 Young came to be regarded as the outstanding tutor and zoologist in Oxford. All his teaching and research had flair and enthusiasm. A dominating and charismatic personality he could sometimes be overbearing, arrogant, and unwilling to listen to criticism. In fact he was too interested in science for this behaviour to last long and usually he responded well to valid arguments, even from juniors. His dynamism and enthusiasm inspired many to careers in biology and medicine. As Professor David Barker, a former pupil, wrote: &#145;It was his intense interest in all living things, his almost childlike wonder and curiosity about them, that made Young such an inspiring teacher. That, and his contempt for established dogma, his insistence on establishing everything afresh&#146;. In tutorials &#145;his sharp intellect could be ruthless, his exposure of flaws and errors merciless but mixed in with the criticism there would usually be some praise and always encouragement and inspiration to move on to the next topic and improve&#146;  (Boycott, 490).<br>
<br>Young was without medical qualifications, and he never became a DPhil. Thus his appointment to head a department in a medical school (at University College, London) was vociferously opposed by a conservative establishment largely composed of medical anatomists and surgeons. He overcame their opposition by ignoring it, meanwhile getting his staff to use a more functional approach when teaching human anatomy and insisting they undertook significant research. He founded an intercalated BSc anatomy course, lasting 12&#150;18 months, for those medical students who had become interested in basic biological science. These reforms triggered similar course changes in other medical schools. The department soon became a place of choice for postdoctoral workers, particularly from the USA. Opposition to his appointment evaporated.<br>
<br>In Oxford, Young had begun to write a textbook that expanded to become two. These were finished during his first decade at University College, London. <span class="italic">The Life of Vertebrates</span> (1950) and <span class="italic">The Life of Mammals</span> (1957) were a national and international success. Their style was enjoyable to read, an innovation for zoology texts of the time. Another innovation was Young's treatment of comparative anatomy. Until these books were published animal structures were described as assemblages of facts to provide evidence for evolution. Young was brought up in this tradition, which he thought intellectually rigorous but dull and limited. He now took those facts, organized them from a functional, as well as a comparative anatomical, viewpoint, then presented them as a study of the responses of organisms to the functional and behavioural requirements of the environment. This was refreshing and the books led several generations of students and their teachers to a clearer understanding of animal structure and its evolution, as well as many other biological problems.<br>
<br>Young was an effective teacher and administrator; he was also a deeply committed research worker. In his autobiographical notes he explained that he was never certain why he decided to specialize in nervous system research. However, some of the early influences on his thinking about nervous systems and on his choice of cephalopods for his main research studies are clear. He always acknowledged the special influence of Derek Denny-Brown (later professor of neurology at Harvard), who introduced him to the histological techniques he was to use throughout his career. Denny-Brown and several other friends, including John Carew Eccles, were members of Sir Charles Scott Sherrington's group in the Oxford physiology department. Sherrington always emphasized the need to search for the anatomical basis of the physiology of, and hence the behaviour generated by, central nervous systems. He sought to resolve difficulties of observation and interpretation by working on &#145;simpler&#146; systems, such as the mammalian spinal cord. Modifications and amplifications of this approach became the basis for much of Young's thinking on neural mechanisms. Thus early in his career (1938) he proposed a theory of reverberating neural circuits (based on the anatomy of the vertical and superior frontal lobes of cephalopod brains) to account for the persistence in time of memories of events. This theory derived, in part, from the then current explanations of the mechanisms involved in the persistence of rhythmic scratching generated within the mammalian spinal cord after the initiating stimulus has stopped.<br>
<br>A second, more practical, influence on Young's development as a research worker was Enrico Sereni. In 1929 Young became the Oxford scholar at the &#145;Anton Dohrn&#146; zoological station in Naples. Sereni (an anti-fascist who was later found dead in mysterious circumstances) was the resident physiologist. He introduced Young to cephalopods as experimental animals. Together they worked on the time course and nature of degeneration and regeneration when the peripheral nerves of octopods were severed. During these experiments Young noticed an epistellar body on the stellate ganglion of the lesser octopus (<i>Eledone</i>). Out of curiosity he made a comparative anatomical study of this structure and looked for it in decapods (squids and cuttlefishes). The work unexpectedly came to be of immense general importance because it led to the discovery of the giant nerve fibre systems of decapods. These systems are made up of large diameter nerve fibres, which are, therefore, fast conducting. They control the musculature involved in a squid's fast escape responses. A single nerve fibre in the common squid can be more than 0.5 mm in diameter. This size caused great excitement among physiologists who had been trying to isolate and record from much smaller single nerve fibres. Indeed the fibres are so large that, within a few years, it even proved possible regularly to insert an electrode inside one. This innovation meant that the potential difference between the inside and the outside of a nerve fibre at rest and during activity could be measured directly, then interpreted in terms of the movements of ions back and forth across the axonal membrane. The results became basic to later theories of nerve cell conduction and fundamental to understanding the ionic properties of membranes of cells in general. Sir Alan Hodgkin and Sir Andrew Huxley were awarded a Nobel prize in 1963 for this work. Hodgkin later remarked, &#145;it is arguable that the introduction of the squid giant nerve fibre by J. Z. Young in 1936 did more for axonology than any other single advance in technique during the last 40 years&#146;  (Boycott, 493).<br>
<br>The experience of studying degeneration and regeneration in octopus nerves became important during the Second World War. Young was asked by the Medical Research Council to organize a small group in Oxford to study peripheral nerve wounds and their repair. The group soon made some useful surgical improvements to aid regeneration, but a great deal of their work had to be basic. For example, there was little information on the rate of growth of nerve fibres and the details of the conditions affecting this. The dynamic relationships of the axoplasm, myelin, Schwann cells, the cell bodies of nerve cells, and the structures innervated, all had to be investigated and quantified. Looking back, the influence of Young's wartime group can be seen as a bridge between the descriptive past and current molecular biological approaches to problems of neural repair.<br>
<br>Young did not belong to what he called the reductionist school of biological sciences. Thus he did not follow his discovery of giant nerve fibres into the study of the biophysics of their membranes, nor did he long continue research on the mechanisms of the growth and development of nerve cells. He seems to have regarded investigating cellular mechanisms as scientifically too narrow. He saw this type of work as necessary but too limited in scope to help in study of the &#145;big problems&#146;, such as memory. The best science, he felt, should be the study of integrated functions of organs and systems. Thus as soon as possible after the war he initiated a programme to study memory mechanisms using octopus brains.<br>
<br>The practical parts of Young's octopus memory studies were carried out at the zoological station in Naples. Except for a return, when over eighty years old, to his earliest research on the autonomic nervous systems of fishes at the Marine Biology Station in Plymouth, cephalopod brain and behaviour studies were to occupy most of his personal research time from 1947 until his death. Initially the memory experiments were designed to be interpreted in terms of specified neural networks and their synapses. As time passed the emphasis shifted to a study of the interrelationship of the lobes of the octopus brain during visual and tactile learning paradigms. In short, the work became more of a cognitive study of the properties of the lobes. Perhaps this was a result of the influence of Young's reading of developments in cognitive psychology. Young had always followed this literature and expected his work on octopus brains to contribute simpler paradigms to aid the understanding of human brain mechanisms. This shift to a more cognitive study was consistent with his emphasis on the need to study organ systems as a whole. But, ironically, it seems to have made his work more limited, to understanding the brain and behaviour of cephalopods, than he had intended when he began.<br>
<br>Young did not produce any deep theory or unifying hypothesis of neural action. He made the important discovery of squid giant nerve fibres, and wrote major papers and a book on the structure of cephalopod brains. He emphasized the relation between structure and function through this work and his textbooks. He was a great enthusiast for, and enabler and inspirer of, the research of others. Over sixty of his former pupils and staff became professors and directors of departments around the world. One, Sir Peter Medawar, was a Nobel laureate for immunology in 1960, and at least nine were elected fellows of the Royal Society. There were many more former pupils in positions of influence and importance. A remarkable feature of Young's impact was that all those he most influenced developed their own independent lines of work. He encouraged imagination and initiative; he did not expect, or encourage, intellectual clones, as do so many dominating personalities.<br>
<br>Although a compulsive hard worker Young liked partying and was an accomplished ballroom dancer. He was greatly interested in art and some of his drive as a biologist was his aesthetic response to the &#145;sheer beauty of living things&#146;. Both his wives were painters. He married Phyllis Heaney (<i>b</i>. 1905) on 17 December 1931; they had a son and a daughter. They separated in 1957; she died in March 1987. Young also had a daughter with his second partner, Raymonde May Parsons (<i>b</i>. 1916), whom he married on 29 August 1987.<br>
<br>Young was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1945 and was awarded its royal medal in 1967. He received eight honorary degrees and many other distinctions, including the gold medal of the Linnean Society in 1973 and honorary citizenship of Naples in 1991. He was made an honorary fellow of the British Academy in 1986. For twenty-one years he was president and vice-president of the Marine Biological Association of Great Britain. He died of heart failure at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, on 4 July 1997, and was buried at All Saints' Church, Brill, Buckinghamshire, six days later. He was survived by his second wife and his three children.<br>
