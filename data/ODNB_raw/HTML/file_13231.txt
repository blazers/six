<span class="headword">Higgins,  Francis</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em> the Sham Squire]</span>  (1746&#150;1802), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor and spy</span>, was born in Dublin, the son of Patrick Higgins, an attorney's clerk, and his wife, Mary; his parents had moved there from Downpatrick, co. Down. Higgins passed his early years in menial employments, became an attorney's clerk, by report converted to protestantism, though his name is not found in the official list of converts (and his later reconversion to Roman Catholicism is alluded to), and, through deception, married an heiress, Mary Anne Archer (<i>d</i>. 1767), of an eminent Dublin Catholic family, who in 1766 prosecuted him for fraud. Higgins was convicted, and was for a time imprisoned. This episode earned Higgins the sobriquet &#145;Sham Squire&#146;. After his release he formed lucrative connections with lottery offices and gambling houses. In 1775 he appears as master of the Dublin guild of hosiers, which entitled him to be elected to the Dublin city commons. He was admitted an attorney at Dublin in 1780 (apparently through the influence of the attorney-general, John Scott), secured the posts of deputy coroner and under-sheriff for Dublin, and in 1788 was appointed a magistrate for co. Dublin. This accumulation of offices, along with his proprietorship of the <span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span> newspaper, meant that by the 1780s Higgins was one of the city's most influential citizens.<br>
<br>Founded in Dublin in 1763, the <span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span> was an organ of radical opinion with Charles Lucas as its main contributor, and later it expressed the opinions of the &#145;patriots&#146;, notably Henry Grattan and Henry Flood, in their opposition to Lord Townshend. Higgins secured an editorial role from as early as 1779 and, without the knowledge of the then owners, was simultaneously in the pay of government. He skilfully maintained this equivocal role for a period by maintaining a pretence of patriotism for the sake of the newspaper's owners but at the same time ingratiated himself with government. However, from the date of his proprietorship of the <span class="italic">Freeman</span> in 1783 (when it was purchased by government and placed under Higgins's management) until his death in 1802 it became openly subservient to Pitt's administration. Higgins continuously assailed the government's opponents in his paper, provoking Grattan's denunciation in parliament. Ironically the circulation and influence of the paper declined under Higgins's management, becoming ultimately a costly liability to its political sponsors. In 1789 Higgins's arch-rival, the Belfast radical John Magee, published polemical attacks in his own paper, the <span class="italic">Dublin Evening Post</span>; there he exposed Higgins's antecedents and the Archer affair and denounced Higgins as a venal journalist, a corrupt magistrate, and a profiteer from gambling. Magee also attacked associates of Higgins, including the actor and theatre manager Richard Daly. In 1790 Higgins prosecuted Magee for libel and through his alleged influence with John Scott, now Lord Earlsfort, lord chief justice, he obtained, by authority of that court, writs styled &#145;fiats&#146;, an obsolescent legal process under which the defendant was liable to imprisonment until he found surety for damages of &pound;7800, which he was unable to do. Under pressure the jury returned a guilty verdict against Magee. These proceedings formed the subject of discussion in the Irish House of Commons. The case brought into focus the abuse of fiats which subsequently ceased to be used.<br>
<br>In 1791 Higgins was removed from the magistracy, and in 1795 he was struck off the roll of attorneys. In 1795 he warned the government of a projected attack on the new lord lieutenant, Lord Camden. Through the under-secretary of state, Edward Cooke, Higgins secretly communicated to the Irish government in 1798 information on the United Irishmen obtained through a system of spies and informers which he managed. The government account of secret service money (20 June 1798) has an entry for &pound;1000 paid to &#145;F. H.&#146; for the discovery of Lord Edward Fitzgerald. The initials are those of Higgins. Cooke recommended that Lord Castlereagh grant a yearly pension of &pound;300 to Higgins for the same service. Although Higgins was amply rewarded by government for this and other services, he remained persistent in his demands and complaints. His role in this arrest was the subject of much historical inquiry subsequently, especially after the publication of the correspondence of Lord Cornwallis in 1859. Works by the historians R. R. Madden and W. J. Fitzpatrick appeared at a period of resurgent Irish nationalism in the 1860s, thus making Higgins's betrayal of Fitzgerald a key episode in national consciousness. It is not surprising that their assessment was coloured by that standpoint. Thus for Madden, writing in 1867: &#145;Higgins, in politics, in religion, in friendship, in all his pursuits, was everything by turns and nothing long. In hypocrisy and perfidy alone he was always consistent and persistent: he was always &#151; Higgins&#146;  (Madden, <span class="italic">History</span>, 2.451). Higgins died in affluence at Dublin on 19 January 1802: his will mentions legacies worth &pound;12,380. His heir was Francis Higgins of Philadelphia, his nephew and namesake, who was originally from Downpatrick. Higgins was buried with his parents in Kilbarrack cemetery, Dublin.<br>
