<span class="headword">Farquhar <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em> Townsend-Farquhar]</span>,  Horace Brand</span>, Earl Farquhar  (1844&#150;1923), <span class="occ">financier and politician</span>, was born at Goldings, near Hertford, on 19 May 1844, the fifth of six sons of Sir Minto Townsend-Farquhar, second baronet (1809&#150;1865), MP for Hertford, and his wife, Erica Mackay, daughter of the seventh Lord Reay. Farquhar came of a distinguished but impoverished Scottish family, members of which had, like other families from north-east Scotland, travelled to England in search of fame and fortune under the Hanoverians. His great-grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9181/', "Walter Farquhar")</script> had been physician to the prince regent and was created a baronet in 1796; Walter's younger son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9180/', "Sir Robert Townsend-Farquhar")</script>, grandfather of Horace Farquhar, was the first &#145;and probably the most distinguished&#146; British governor of Mauritius, from 1810 to 1821  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 31 Aug 1923).<br>
<br>Details of Horace Farquhar's education remain obscure; he did not, like his older brother Robert, attend the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich nor, like his younger brother, Gilbert, Eton College. Formal obituaries say that at an early age he joined Forbes, Forbes &amp; Co., a business dealing with the East Indian trade, belonging to the Forbes family, old friends and compatriots of the Farquhars; a contemporary noted, however, that he started his career in the 1860s as &#145;an impecunious clerk in one of the Government offices&#146; before joining the house of Forbes  (Huntly, 168&#150;70).<br>
<br>Handsome, self-confident, and ambitious, Farquhar rose to become manager of Forbes, Forbes &amp; Co. According to one source his rapid rise in business and society&#151;he was introduced to the prince of Wales's circle by the Forbeses&#151;was due as much to his physical charms, skilfully exploited with both sexes, as to his undoubted shrewdness and ability to make money  (Hyde, 157). He left Forbes to join the private banking house of Sir Samuel Scott, bart &amp; Co., in which he became a partner and a substantial shareholder. Farquhar enjoyed a long-standing friendship with his fellow countryman Lord Macduff (later the sixth earl of Fife), who sold much of his Scottish estate and invested the proceeds in Scott's bank. In 1889 Fife married Louise, the third daughter of the prince and princess of Wales, and was elevated to a dukedom; he also was invited in that year to become vice-chairman of the British South Africa Company (BSAC) the company largely created by Cecil Rhodes and chartered by the British government in 1889 to administer and develop the territories north of South Africa. At Fife's suggestion Farquhar was invited to join the board of the company. Farquhar's presence on the board of BSAC &#145;did not enhance its moral tone&#146; because he was also a chairman of (and a considerable shareholder in) the Rothschild-backed Exploration Company which was seeking mining concessions in BSAC territory  (Galbraith, 117). Farquhar appeared unaware of, or ignored, the potential conflicts of interest which led others to turn down positions in both companies. In 1896, in the wake of the Jameson raid, he was obliged to resign from the board of BSAC, as were others too closely identified with the interests of Cecil Rhodes.<br>
<br>By 1890 Farquhar had secured for himself considerable wealth and position in the City, where his brother Granville was by that time senior partner of the stockbrokers Steer, Lawford &amp; Co. In 1894 Horace played a leading part in the merger of the Scott bank with Parrs Banking Company and joined the board of the enlarged Parrs. On 5 January 1895 he married Emilie (<i>d</i>. 1922), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Packe, Lady Scott, formerly married to Sir Edward H. Scott, of the Scott bank and a widow since 1883.<br>
<br>Marriage may have helped what was by this time a burgeoning political career. Farquhar had been elected a member of the first London county council in 1889, representing the Municipal Reformers of Marylebone, but he was disappointed in 1892 by the reward of a baronetcy rather than the peerage for which he had hoped. In 1895 he entered the House of Commons as MP for Marylebone, which he represented until 1898, when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Farquhar of Marylebone; he was succeeded in the House of Commons by his stepson, Sir Samuel Scott. When the prince of Wales became Edward VII in 1901, Farquhar was appointed master of the household, a position he held until 1907. He was then lord-in-waiting, until 1915, and finally served as lord steward of the household until 1922. He was created a viscount in 1917 and an earl in the dissolution honours late in 1922, a few months after the death of his wife. Despite, or perhaps because of, all his wealth and honours and his generous hospitality both in London and at his Norfolk home, Castle Rising, a contemporary noted that he was far from popular.<br>
<br>Early in 1923 Farquhar was dismissed by Bonar Law from the treasurership of the Conservative and Unionist Party after he refused to pay for some of the election expenses with moneys that he claimed had been given to the coalition rather than to the Conservative Party. It seemed that he had handed over a large sum of money to Lloyd George. Farquhar died on 30 August 1923 at his London home, 7 Grosvenor Square. He was buried at Bromley Hill cemetery, Kent, on 11 September. He left no heir and his titles died with him. His will provided for many legacies, including some to members of the royal family with whom he had been so intimately connected for so long. His estate was assessed for probate at &pound;400,000, but the subsequent revelation of huge debts meant there was nothing to distribute and that he was an undisclosed bankrupt.<br>
