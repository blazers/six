<span class="headword">Lougher,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1585), <span class="occ">ecclesiastical lawyer</span>, was born at Tenby, Pembrokeshire, the younger son of Thomas Lougher, alderman and former mayor of the town, and Maud, daughter of Rhys ap Gwilim of Betws, Carmarthen. Elected a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, as of founder's kin in 1553, he graduated BCL (9 July 1558) and proceeded DCL (19 February 1565), having in the meantime been collated to the archdeaconry of Totnes (21 February 1562). Holding a number of Devon rectories in plurality, he was on the commission of the peace for this county from 1561 and of the quorum from 1564. As proctor for the clergy of the diocese of Exeter in the convocation of 1563, he subscribed the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, but disapproved even of the watered down version of puritan demands embodied in the six articles.<br>
<br>In 1564 Lougher was elected principal of New Inn Hall, Oxford. On 25 February 1565 he was admitted a member of Doctors' Commons, and about this time became chancellor of Exeter diocese. Appointed regius professor of civil law at Oxford on 10 January 1566, he was among the disputants before Queen Elizabeth on her visit to the university in the following September; and he was one of the original fellows of Jesus College on its foundation in 1571, having resigned the headship of New Inn Hall the previous year. In 1572 he was returned to parliament for Pembroke, being named on 13 March 1576 to a committee to consider a <span class="roman">Bill for Relief of Vicars and Curates</span>. In 1574 he became a master in chancery, and on 10 May 1575 was re-elected to the headship of New Inn Hall, which he held for the ensuing five years. In 1576 Archbishop Grindal appointed him as one of the visitors of the diocese of Gloucester. From 1577 he was a justice of the peace for Pembrokeshire (of the quorum from <i>c</i>.1583) and was eventually appointed deputy lieutenant. But these positions were probably chiefly honorary, since in May 1577, resigning his professorship, he was appointed official of the consistory and vicar-general in spirituals to Edwin Sandys, archbishop of York, who described him in a letter to Burghley as &#145;an honest, learned and wise man&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 27, art. 12). As vicar-general he was a leading member of the northern high commission and among the most regular attenders. However, on account of his frequent absences from York, he relied heavily on an unqualified surrogate to preside over cases in the consistory court. Perhaps as a result, testamentary cases were shifted to another of the York diocesan courts, the exchequer, despite Lougher's attempts to prevent the change.<br>
<br>Lougher married Elizabeth, granddaughter of John Rastell, the printer. They had three sons, John (the heir), Thomas, and Robert, and three daughters, Elizabeth, Jane, and Lettice. Lougher's nuncupative will was made at Tenby (where he was afterwards buried) on 3 June 1585, and proved six days later. Unfortunately his fortune attracted the predatory attention of a certain Rice Morgan, who claimed to have been betrothed to Elizabeth before Lougher married her; his attempts to force the widow into a union with him were foiled only with the assistance of Star Chamber. It was not until 1593 that the terms of Lougher's will were finally confirmed.<br>
