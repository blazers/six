<span class="headword">Christian,  Jonathan</span>  (1808&#150;1887), <span class="occ">judge</span>, born at Carrick-on-Suir, co. Tipperary, on 17 February 1808, was the third son of George Christian, solicitor, and his wife, Margaret Cormac. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, entered King's Inns, Dublin, in 1829 and Gray's Inn, London, in 1831, and was called to the Irish bar in 1834. On 16 May 1859 he married Mary Churtian Thomas, the daughter of Edward Thomas of Levenhampton, registrar to Judge Churtian.<br>
<br>Christian joined the Leinster circuit and became one of the leaders of the equity bar; he was made a queen's counsel in 1841 and third serjeant in 1851, and was appointed as solicitor-general by Lord Palmerston in 1856. In 1858 he was appointed a puisne judge in the court of common pleas. In 1867 he was appointed lord justice of appeal in the court of chancery appeal.<br>
<br>Christian had a high conception of the role of the courts of equity in the administration of justice and a passion for efficiency in those courts and their procedures. He considered two persons who were his colleagues on the equity bench for some time, Hedges Eyre Chatterton (who was appointed vice-chancellor in 1867) and Thomas O'Hagan (who was appointed lord chancellor in 1868 on the formation of Gladstone's first government) to be unfitted for their positions by reason of their lack of experience and knowledge of chancery matters. He remarked of O'Hagan once in open court that &#145;I have known the Court of Chancery longer than he has. My acquaintance with it does not date from the day I first sat upon its Bench&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Law Times</span>, 25 May 1872). Remarks such as this gave rise to a view expressed by <span class="italic">The Times</span> upon his retirement, that &#145;although unsociability of temperament and a belief in his own superiority, both in conscientiousness and intellect, brought Christian into conflict with others, especially O'Hagan and Chatterton, his learning and acumen earned him a place among eminent Irish judges&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 Nov 1878). None the less, Christian's abilities as a judge, his erudition, and his independence of mind came to be overshadowed by conduct which was widely believed to be inappropriate for a sitting judge, in conducting public debate and in expressing what were in effect political opinions from the judicial bench.<br>
<br>Christian considered the reforms in landlord and tenant relations effected by the <span class="roman">Land Act 1870</span>, with the policy of which O'Hagan was closely associated, to be a confiscation of landowners' rights, and he described a provision in the act as being &#145;shocking to all our ideas of property law&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Law Times Reports</span>, 6.131). He proposed with respect to the <span class="roman">Irish Judicature Bill</span> that the office of the lord chancellor, being the only one on the judicial bench whose occupant held office at the pleasure of the prime minister, should either be abolished or that it should cease to exercise any judicial functions, these being transferred to the master of the rolls. Christian also made extravagant attacks on other judges, counsel, law reporters, and politicians, at times from the judicial bench&#151;a practice, remarked the <span class="italic">Irish Law Times and Solicitors' Journal</span>, that had &#145;the advantage of immunity from retort&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Law Times</span>, 4.697). Christian published a number of pamphlets and wrote to <span class="italic">The Times</span> on the legal and political subjects which concerned him. He requested the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting for Ireland not to report his judgments because of the supposed incompetence of their reporters. He was the subject of two rebukes from the prime minister in the House of Commons&#151;by Gladstone in 1872 and by Disraeli in 1876&#151;on account of his inappropriate judicial remarks.<br>
<br>Christian retired from the bench because of deafness in November 1878, and died at his home, 53 Merrion Square, Dublin, on 29 October 1887. He was buried at Dean's Grange cemetery, co. Dublin.<br>
