<span class="headword">Trefnant <span class="st"> [Trevenant]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1404), <span class="occ">bishop of Hereford</span>, was from the village of Trefnant, between Denbigh and St Asaph in north Wales. His episcopal chancellor and executor, Master Reginald Wolston, was a kinsman, and a nephew of the bishop had left Agnes Barton as a widow by 1390. Master John Trefnant (John ap Hywel or John Cresset), perhaps a brother of the bishop, was his prot&eacute;g&eacute; and Master Hugh Trefnant (Hugh ap Dafydd), his colleague in the St Asaph chapter, may possibly have been kin too. On the other hand, in 1389 Richard II told the pope that Trefnant was related &#145;in a close degree&#146; to certain nobles &#145;assisting at our side&#146;, presumably from among the lords appellant and, probably explicitly, the earls of Arundel  (Perroy, <span class="italic">Diplomatic Correspondence</span>, 64).<br>
<br>Trefnant was BCL of Oxford University by 7 April 1372, when the pope granted him four years of non-residence from his rectory of Llanwrin, Powys, to study, and DCL by July 1376 when he was involved in a dispute between the law faculty and the rest of the university. He was living in London as a clerk on 1 October 1376; the next six years are undocumented. On 3 January 1382 he was appointed by Archbishop William Courtenay to secure his pallium in the papal curia, an undemanding task which may suggest he was already there, but in April he was thought available to share custody of the spiritualities <i>sede vacante</i> of St Asaph (where he was a canon, at least later, and had close friends). However, on 16 July 1383 he was named as a proctor by Florimund, lord of l'Esparre, to ensure a payment into the papal camera, so it does seem likely that he was already permanently in the curia. Probably by 1385, certainly by January 1386, he had become an auditor of causes, continuing in this office until he became a bishop, and being termed a papal chaplain. In these years he acted as proctor in various personal matters for the king and queen, several English bishops, and clerks of the royal household.<br>
<br>On 3 May 1389 Trefnant was papally provided to the see of Hereford and consecrated in Rome on 20 June. It seems unlikely that this represents an independent initiative by the pope, but very likely that the former lords appellant had encouraged the choice, with Richard II himself having no objection. Urban VI gave Trefnant a safe conduct to return to England on 8 August, and he was in London by 16 October when he received his temporalities. He was used by the crown for his legal skills to assist in various sorts of business: for example, to settle disputes in the Anglo-Prussian trade (24 February 1390); to hear a case between the marshal of France and Sir Matthew Gournay (26 April 1390); to execute the sentence of the court in the celebrated <i>Scrope v. Grosvenor</i> case (28 November 1390); on an embassy to France (18 March &#150; 4 June 1394). According to Edouard Perroy he was an adviser to the king before the re-enactment of the <span class="roman">Statute of <i>Praemunire</i></span> in 1393, and does seem a more appropriate choice, at least in terms of recent experience of the papacy, than Bishop John Gilbert of St David's (his predecessor at Hereford), who is named in the issue rolls of the exchequer. On the other hand, Gilbert had had a very long career, including a term as treasurer of the realm, and had pursued business more than once in the papal curia thirty years before. He was one of the few men left who could remember the many different, often unintended, effects which the original statute (enacted in 1353) had had in Edward III's later years.<br>
<br>Whatever his commissions, Trefnant was usually in his own diocese. Between 1389 and 1393 he was in dogged pursuit of the heretics William Swinderby and Walter Bryt, who were evangelizing there and knew how to exploit the clumsy procedures for arrest, their eventual trials before him being recorded at unique length in his register. He also attended the Council of Stamford, Lincolnshire, which tried the heretic Henry Crump in June 1392. On the other hand, between 1393 and 1396 he opposed vigorously Archbishop Courtenay's attempts to make a visitation of his diocese. Richard II called him to a council at Oxford on 27 January 1399 to have his opinion about the resolution of the great schism.<br>
<br>The circumstances of the deposition of Richard II, especially the events of 29 and 30 September 1399, required the perpetrators to make at least three successive attempts to compose an &#145;official account&#146; for circulation, each one seeking to improve on the reality and present a coherent and consistent interpretation. Trefnant is always given a significant role. In the earliest, he was said to have been among those who interviewed the king in the Tower of London on the 29th. In the final version, he and Archbishop Richard Scrope headed the deputation that received Richard II's free abdication that day, and presented it as his proctors to the assembly that met on the 30th. Since this was the version which was to be circulated for dissection by a sharply divided political community, it is to be supposed that not only was there indeed such an assembly (a fact that no one was ever to challenge), and there were over 250 parliamentary members-elect from the shires and boroughs in the capital to tell their constituents about any blatant fiction, but that Trefnant and Scrope did enough to qualify for their roles. Indeed, in terms of the public events it describes, this version has been found wanting only in selectivity and interpretation. Its crucial lies are restricted to what happened away from the public eye.<br>
<br>Accordingly, much effort has been invested in finding an explanation for the choice of Trefnant and Scrope in terms of their political affiliation, without much success. The truth seems to be that they were regarded, rightly, as not only the two most substantial lawyers on the episcopal bench but, specifically, the most recently familiar with the papal curia, that those seeking to remove Richard II relied on civil- and especially canon-law principles and precedents to achieve it, and that Scrope and Trefnant need be seen as no more partisan than simply willing to comply in, and lend their authority (perhaps even skilled legal advice) to, a <i>fait accompli</i>. Since becoming a bishop, these had been the only reasons why Trefnant had ever been called into public life, but he had been so called, and regularly. In February 1400 he was even sent to the papal curia to explain the deposition.<br>
<br>On 13 February 1401 Trefnant was appointed to help negotiate (in England) the marriage of Princess Blanche to Count Ludwig of the Palatinate; perhaps some canonical difficulty had emerged from close enquiry into the pair's circumstances. After criticism by the Commons in parliament in March 1401 about the thinness of the king's council, he became a regular attender until March 1403. He was a principal escort of Queen Isabella, Richard II's widow, as far as Calais, when she was returned to her royal family of France, from 26 June to 6 August 1401; England's best canon lawyers and experts in the ways of the papacy had certainly to be on hand to make the best of this most sensitive of all the consequences of the deposition. On 16 July and 26 September 1401 he was appointed to hear an appeal in the perennial case of the count of Denia and his ransom.<br>
<br>Such specialist engagements apart, Trefnant appears to have been away from the heart of political life, and much more at home in his diocese. When he made his will on 1 March 1404 at Prestbury, Gloucestershire, he was too sick to do much more than name and give full discretion to ten executors, mainly members of his diocesan staff but headed by Bishop John Trevor of St Asaph, a friend since boyhood but now (as Trefnant surely was too) much troubled by Owain Glyn D&#373;r's claims to the allegiance of their kin-groups in that region. In fact, he did not die until 29 March, still at Prestbury. An inventory prepared for probate shows that he owned a library of nearly ninety books, sixty-six of them on canon and civil law. He was buried, as he requested, in St Anne's Chapel on the south side of Hereford Cathedral.<br>
