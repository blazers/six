</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Beardmore,  William</span>, Baron Invernairn  (1856&#150;1936), <span class="occ">engineer and shipbuilder</span>, was born on 16 October 1856 at Deptford, the eldest son of William Beardmore and his wife, Sophia Louisa Halkman. His father was assistant manager of the Deptford works of the General Steam Navigation Company, but subsequently moved to Glasgow in 1861 as a partner in the Parkhead forge. William junior was educated at Glasgow high school and Ayr Academy and when he was fifteen he was apprenticed at the forge, attending evening classes at Anderson's University. At the end of his time, in 1877, he enrolled at the Royal School of Mines in South Kensington, taking courses in metallurgy and chemistry.<br>
<br>Although Beardmore's father died in 1877 leaving him his share in the business, he completed his education and returned to Glasgow in 1879 to be his uncle Isaac's junior partner. He immediately persuaded his uncle to begin making open-hearth steel and to install a steel foundry; and following his uncle's retirement in 1886, William became sole partner. Two years later he diversified into armour plate production and in 1889 began making plates for high pressure Scotch boilers. Other investments quickly followed, including a 12,000 ton press in 1895 to make American Harveyized armour plate. At the turn of the century Beardmore embarked on a massive extension to the works: these included a new office block, a gun factory, and additional armour plate capacity. By late 1899 he was also contemplating building a large naval shipyard at Dalmuir on the lower Clyde, and he managed to acquire the goodwill of the insolvent shipbuilding business of Robert Napier &amp; Sons. Work began on the new yard in 1900. At the same time he joined a syndicate that bought J. I. Thornycroft &amp; Co. of Chiswick, the torpedo boat builders; and Beardmore was subsequently appointed chairman.<br>
<br>This concentrated activity drained Beardmore of credit. He was forced to form the business into a limited liability company early in 1902, exchanging almost 60 per cent of the capital with Vickers, Son, and Maxim for an equivalent stake in that company and a seat on the board. During 1902 Beardmore also became the major shareholder in the motor car building business of Arrol Johnston. In the same year he married Elspeth, daughter of John Tullis, owner of the St Ann's leatherworks in Bridgeton, Glasgow. They had no children. Shortly after his marriage Beardmore purchased Flichity House with a 3000 acre sporting estate in Inverness-shire.<br>
<br>Vickers encouraged Beardmore, who was appointed chairman of the new company, to continue his expansion plans. Although Vickers had told Armstrong Whitworth that it would prevent Beardmore from making gun mountings, the company installed a gun plant in 1902 and joined the &#145;gun pool&#146;, in effect, a cartel of all manufacturers. The additions and extensions to Parkhead were completed in 1904; and the Dalmuir naval construction works, the most modern and best-equipped shipyard on the Clyde, was inaugurated during 1906. During 1905 William Beardmore &amp; Co. purchased the Mossend steel works from the Summerlee and Mossend Iron and Steel Company to secure supplies of ship plates and angles. Work began at once on the reconstruction of the plant, with the installation of a new three-high plate mill. During 1903/4 Beardmore, in co-operation with Vickers, established the Glasgow Electric Crane and Hoist Company, which was sold in 1906. The relationship with J. I. Thornycroft &amp; Co. did not prove to be a happy one for Beardmore, and he resigned as chairman in 1907.<br>
<br>During 1907 Vickers became openly dissatisfied with its investment in William Beardmore &amp; Co., which was becoming illiquid and in need of financial support. Vickers took stiff measures to control Beardmore's activities, appointing a nominee as joint managing director. Although the company's financial strength improved, Vickers unsuccessfully tried to offload part of its investment to Armstrong Whitworth. During 1910 the company's financial health recovered, following the order for the dreadnought HMS <i>Conqueror</i>, and Vickers again encouraged Beardmore to invest in new armour plate rolling plant. By 1913 Vickers' nominees had resigned and Beardmore had regained full executive control of the firm. He immediately took the opportunity to diversify into aircraft manufacture. In 1914 he was created a baronet.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war, Beardmore was immediately called on to supply huge quantities of war material, from field guns to ships and aeroplanes. During the war the company turned out 3500 field guns, 69 vessels totalling 118,089 tons, including the battleship HMS <i>Ramilles</i> and the first through-deck aircraft-carrier, HMS <i>Argus</i>, 650 planes, two airships, and all the steel helmets for the British army. Beardmore also co-operated in the development of the tank, and his company made all the pedrail shoes for the tracks of every tank built. The firm's plant was greatly extended, with new buildings at Dalmuir to manufacture aeroplanes, field guns, and airship parts. The Mossend steel works were completely rebuilt and factories for munitions work purchased in Paisley and Coatbridge.<br>
<br>In the early part of the war the company's plants were the focus of labour unrest on the Clyde over the issues of rent increases, dilution, and restrictive practices. This resulted in a massive confrontation between Sir William and his workforce led by David Kirkwood. In March 1916, however, after government intervention and Kirkwood's arrest, the strife subsided. Beardmore extended the company's interests during the war, buying Alley and MacLellan Ltd, owners of the Sentinel works at Polmadie, Glasgow, and a steam-wagon factory at Shrewsbury. On his own account he purchased a majority holding in the Sheffield steelmakers, Dunford and Elliott Ltd.<br>
<br>With the coming of peace, Beardmore was convinced that trade would expand. He planned to manufacture passenger vessels, tankers, and steam locomotives at Dalmuir, marine steam and oil engines at the Coatbridge works, buses and lorries on part of the Parkhead site, and taxis at Paisley. He opened a civil aviation department, developing a series of unsuccessful aeroplanes. The company continued to manage the wartime airship works at Renfrew, completing the R34 in 1919 and the R36 in 1921, when the plant closed. He won control of Dunford and Elliott, encouraging the firm to diversify away from steel into the manufacture of motorcycles and cars. He directed Arrol Johnston to tool up its works for the production of heavy motor cars. In 1921 he was created Baron Invernairn of Strathnairn, taking his title from his Inverness-shire home.<br>
<br>Unfortunately, Invernairn's strategy for peacetime trading miscarried, for after 1920 nearly all the departments and subsidiaries of his firm began to lose money. By now in his late sixties, Invernairn was incapable of meeting the crisis. His recipe was to borrow more and instruct his heads of department to exercise economy. During 1926 Vickers sold him its shareholding. Later in the year the accountant Sir William McLintock scrutinized the company's affairs, producing a devastating indictment of Invernairn's lack of management. The following year under the supervision of Montagu Norman of the Bank of England a committee of investigation was appointed. In 1928 Invernairn, whom Norman had unkindly dubbed Beardless, was ousted and over the next two years much of his extensive empire was closed down. In enforced retirement, Invernairn witnessed the collapse of many of his other interests, including Arrol Johnston. He died on 9 April 1936 at his home, Flichity House, Strathnairn, Inverness-shire, where he was buried. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Invernairn's style of doing business was totally autocratic. In many of his investment decisions, he lacked judgement and refused to listen to advice. Despite the scale of his enterprises, which during the First World War employed over 50,000 people, none of them can be said to have been a success. He helped to promote the Industrial Welfare Society in 1918 and was its first chairman. The Beardmore glacier in Antarctica, the largest glacier in the world, was named after him by Ernest Shackleton, whose Antarctic expedition of 1907&#150;9 he had funded.<br>
