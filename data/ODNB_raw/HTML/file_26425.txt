<span class="headword">Stevens,  William</span>  (1732&#150;1807), <span class="occ">hosier and religious writer</span>, was born on 2 March 1732 in the parish of St Saviour's, Southwark, son of a tradesman of Southwark named Stevens (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1733), and his wife, who was a sister of the Revd Samuel Horne, rector of Otham, Kent, and aunt of Dr George Horne, the future bishop of Norwich. After the early death of her husband about 1733 Mrs Stevens moved her only son and daughter, both then in infancy, to Maidstone to be near her brother's family. This formed the basis of a lifelong intimacy between William Stevens and his cousin, George Horne. They were educated together at the same commercial school at Maidstone under the Revd Deodatus Bye, a teacher learned in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. When Horne at the age of fifteen was sent to University College, Oxford, to prepare for holy orders, Stevens, at the age of fourteen, in August 1746, was placed as an apprentice with an eminent wholesale hosier, Mr Hookham, at 68 Old Broad Street, in the City of London. After his apprenticeship expired in 1753 Hookham employed him for a further twelve months as an assistant. In 1754, at the early age of twenty-two, Stevens's diligence was rewarded by his being given a share of the business and being made Hookham's partner. After Hookham's death he became the chief partner, but in 1801 he relinquished a great part of the business in order to devote more time to his studies and charities.<br>
<br>From his earliest years in business Stevens devoted his leisure to literary, theological, and historical studies. He soon acquired an intimate knowledge of the French language and Latin, Greek, and Hebrew literature. His linguistic proficiency as a translator was well displayed in his first publication, a translation of letters in French addressed to Benjamin Kennicott, the whig Hebraist, on the Hebrew text of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>. In this anonymous work of 1772 he supported George Horne's attack upon Kennicott's project of a revised Hebrew text of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>; a translation of letters by Joseph Adolphe to Kennicott on the same subject was published in 1773. He became well read in the writings of the fathers of the early church, and an authority on the writings of notable seventeenth-century Anglican divines such as Thomas Jackson, Lancelot Andrewes, Jeremy Taylor, and George Hickes. He was, for a time, a great admirer of the writings of the biblical critic John Hutchinson. Stevens&#151;along with his like-minded friends Horne, William Jones of Nayland, Nathan Wetherall, Thomas Calverley, George Gaskin, Samuel Glasse, John Parkhurst (who dedicated the fourth edition of his Hebrew and English lexicon to Stevens), John Prince, and Jonathan Boucher&#151;formed the nucleus of a circle of high-church Anglicans, sometimes known as the Hutchinsonians. In their sacramental and mystical interpretation of orthodox Christianity these high-churchmen are often seen as precursors of the Oxford Movement as well as heirs of the Caroline divines and nonjurors.<br>
<br>Stevens's orthodox theological concerns, in which he sought to stem the tide of infidelity and latitudinarianism, found lucid expression in several controversial works. One of the most notable, published anonymously to counteract the Feathers tavern petition of 1772 which called for abolition of subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, was entitled <span class="italic">An essay on the nature and constitution of the Christian church, wherein are set forth the form of its government, the extent of its powers, and the limits of our obedience, by a layman</span> (1773). In another anonymous work of 1773 Stevens took up a similar anti-latitudinarian and anti-rationalist theme, albeit in a more humorous tone, and asserted the apostolical form of ministry and necessity of episcopal ordination against the &#145;vague and indefinite&#146; arguments of Francis Wollaston, rector of Chislehurst  (<span class="italic">Cursory Observations on a Pamphlet Entitled, An Address to the Clergy of the Church of England</span>, 1773, 9&#150;10). It was one of Stevens's most deeply held convictions that &#145;making establishment necessary to the existence of a church, as many are apt to do, is a grievous mistake&#146;  (Park, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 1814, 138). This concern for the independence of the church was in the tradition of the nonjurors and prefigured the teaching of the Oxford Movement.<br>
<br>Stevens was an exponent of a high-church political as well as sacramental theology, emphasizing subordination, attachment to the constitution in church and state, and, in the tradition of the nonjurors, even upholding doctrines of passive obedience and non-resistance to constituted authority. To counter extreme whiggish and &#145;rational&#146; notions concerning the nature of civil power which were being propagated in support of the American colonists, he published <span class="italic">A discourse on the English constitution, extracted from a late eminent writer, and applicable to the present times</span> (1776). With the same end in view, he assailed a sermon of Richard Watson, then regius professor of divinity at Cambridge, for grounding all authority in the power of the people, in two works both published in 1777: <span class="italic">Strictures on a Sermon Entitled &#145;The Principles of the Revolution Vindicated&#146;</span>, and <span class="italic">The Revolution Vindicated, and Constitutional Liberty Asserted</span>. Although these works represented a conservative defence of the 1688 constitution, he was accused by Kennicott of not only denigrating reason but of Jacobite sympathies. In fact, privately, as expressed in correspondence with his close friend the Anglo-American loyalist Jonathan Boucher, Stevens's &#145;tory&#146; and &#145;throne and altar&#146; historical sympathies were marked, extending not only to an intense personal devotion to the memory of the &#145;royal martyr&#146; Charles I, but even to a sentimental neo-Jacobitism. Thus he criticized the pro-whig, French Huguenot historian Rapin for blackening the character of the excluded Stuart family, commended the Jacobite Thomas Carte's <span class="italic">General History of England</span> (1747&#150;52), and always remained uneasy at the part of the 5 November state thanksgiving service commemorating the &#145;deliverance&#146; wrought by William of Orange in 1688.<br>
<br>Stevens responded vigorously to the challenge posed by the influence of the French Revolution and was prominent in the propaganda war against Jacobinism in the 1790s. While retaining a high-church awareness of the danger of Erastianism, in the context of the 1790s Stevens repeatedly defended the link between national church and national government against &#145;French&#146; contractarian notions. He joined with Jones of Nayland and others in forming a Society for the Reformation of Principles. The society published a collection of tracts for the younger clergy, with a preface by Jones, entitled <span class="italic">The Scholar Armed Against the Errors of the Times</span> (1795), and in 1793, inspired by Stevens and Jones, founded a high-church review, the <span class="italic">British Critic</span>. He contributed to the <span class="italic">Anti-Jacobin Review</span> and his name has also been linked to the foundation of the <span class="italic">Orthodox Churchman's Magazine</span> in 1801.<br>
<br>Stevens kept up a lifelong collaboration on theological questions with George Horne, to whom he suggested the plan and satirical character of his <span class="italic">Letters on Infidelity</span> which, when published, were dedicated to him. On Horne's death Stevens published three volumes of his sermons, and supplied Jones of Nayland with materials for his biography of Horne. It was fitting that in 1795 Jones should dedicate to Stevens his <span class="italic">Life of Bishop Horne</span>, and in 1800 Stevens defended his late cousin from an attack in the <span class="italic">British Critic</span>. Stevens's innate humility was reflected in his signing his defence of Horne with the <i>nom de plume</i> Ain (Hebrew for &#145;nobody&#146;), which in turn suggested the title of a collection of his pamphlets published in 1805 as <span class="italic">Nobody's Works</span>. He was ever afterwards known by this appellation, and in 1800 a dining club was instituted by fifteen of his friends in his honour, denominated Nobody's Club. Three meetings of the club, which included well-known clergymen, peers, lawyers, and doctors, were held every year at the Crown and Anchor inn in London. The club, under the name of Nobody's Friends, became a forum for meetings of eminent high-churchmen throughout the nineteenth century and may be regarded, &#145;in a certain sense, as his posterity&#146;  (Park, &#145;Preface&#146; to <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, new edn, 1859, iv). It was appropriate that Stevens's last published work should be his edition of Jones's works published in twelve volumes in 1801, prefixed to which was a life of Jones, part of which had already appeared in the <span class="italic">Orthodox Churchman's Magazine</span> after an unsuccessful attempt to place it in the <span class="italic">Anti-Jacobin Review</span>.<br>
<br>Stevens was of a playful, often whimsical disposition, but a man of holy life. He was assiduous in private devotion and public worship from an early age. He regularly attended weekday matins and evensong at a time when the custom was relatively neglected, and was a constant communicant with a high view of the real presence. His habits of fasting and regard for clerical celibacy owed much to the influence of the nonjuror William Law's spiritual classic <span class="italic">A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life</span> (1728). He also believed in and practised prayers for the dead.<br>
<br>Stevens can be placed within that tradition of high-church Anglican lay piety associated with Isaak Walton, Matthew Hale, John Evelyn, and Robert Nelson, that was continued by his friend Joshua Watson and the generation of high-churchmen known as the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/52465', "Hackney Phalanx")</script> or Clapton Sect. Like Walton before him and Watson after him Stevens was the lay companion and friend of the most eminent Anglican prelates and divines of the day, and &#145;a profound master in the art of holy living&#146;. He shared lifelong spiritual counsel with his closest friend, Thomas Calverley of Ewell, Surrey, on whose death in 1797 Stevens wrote a moving memoir in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. For some years he acted as a spiritual guide and theological mentor to Jane Hookham, only child of his business partner John Hookham, who in 1768 married John Frere, antiquary and high-churchman. Although Stevens detested what he regarded as Methodist irregularity and &#145;enthusiastical fanaticism&#146;, in later years his attitude to Anglican evangelicals and moderate dissenters became more measured, and his outlook was somewhat broader than that of his friend Charles Daubeny and other high-churchmen associated with the Hackney Phalanx.<br>
<br>Stevens was prodigal in his generosity to the poor. His charitable endeavours were reflected in his benefactions to the Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy, Corporation of the Widows of the Clergy, and Clergy Orphan School. He was governor of several hospitals and worked for many years as printer and treasurer of Queen Anne's Bounty (1782&#150;1807), and auditor of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. He also sought to fund the expense of university education for those in financial need. He actively supported the exiled French Catholic clergy in the 1790s, and retained a respectful attitude towards the Roman Catholic church, which contrasted with a more critical treatment of protestant dissenting and presbyterian churches. His greatest labour of love, however, reflecting his sympathy for the nonjuring tradition, was reserved for the depressed episcopal church in Scotland. In 1789 Stevens and two associates, the young lawyer (and later his biographer) James Allan Park and the clergyman George Gaskin, formed a &#145;voluntary committee for managing in England the affairs of the Scotch episcopal church&#146;. He became a friend and correspondent of Bishop John Skinner of Aberdeen, primus of the Scottish episcopal church, and helped pave the way for Bishop Samuel Horsley's successful championship of a bill of 1792 which removed the prohibition of episcopalian clergy ministering in Scotland. At a later date, he served on the English committee of the duke and duchess of Buccleuch's fund for augmenting the incomes of episcopalian bishops and clergy.<br>
<br>Stevens remained a bachelor. His closest friends in his last years included James Allen Park, John Richardson, barrister, and John Bowdler of Hayes, near Bromley, with whom he spent the day preceding his own death. He died on 7 February 1807 at his house in Old Broad Street, London, and was buried on 14 February in Otham churchyard, Kent. He left the bulk of his property to his cousin, William Horne, rector of Otham, having during his life been a great benefactor of Otham church, spending about &pound;600 in repairing and adorning it.<br>
