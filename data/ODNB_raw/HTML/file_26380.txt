<span class="headword">Stephens,  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1706), <span class="occ">pamphleteer and moral reformer</span>, was the son of Edward Stephens, of Cherington, Gloucestershire, and Mary, daughter of John Raynerford, of Staverton, Northamptonshire. The Stephens family owned several estates in Gloucestershire. Edward followed a number of relatives to the Middle Temple bar, practising as a lawyer during Charles II's reign. He later left the bar and was ordained, although he held no living. After 1671 he married into another prominent Gloucestershire family, becoming the second husband of Mary Adderley, the widowed daughter of Sir Matthew Hale. Richard Baxter, who wrote a memoir of Hale at the request of Stephens, said the great lawyer and his son-in-law were close friends. On Hale's death in 1676 Stephens edited and published the former chief justice's <span class="italic">Contemplations Moral and Divine</span> with a preface justifying breaking Hale's injunction against posthumous publication. The work appeared in several editions. Stephens himself wrote more than fifty pamphlets on political and religious issues, the first in 1674 but the majority between 1689 and 1691 and in the ten years before his death in 1706. Several were published under the name Socrates Christianus. Thomas Hearne observed that Stephens was &#145;a good, pious, sincere and religious man&#146; but that he had &#145;singular opinions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remains</span>, 361&#150;2). Stephens's first tract, <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning the Original of the Powder-Plot</span> (1674), introduced a recurring theme, arguing that the laxity of preferment-seeking Anglican clergy was driving zealous Christians to join the sects and weakening resistance to Rome. Stephens later wrote and debated against London nonconformists, particularly the Quakers, but he respected their sincerity and religious commitment, contrasting this with the &#145;cold&#146; formalism of the Church of England. He opposed coercive uniformity as divisive and contrary to primitive Christianity.<br>
<br>In 1688&#150;9 Stephens welcomed the &#145;wonderfull Revolution&#146;, hailing William of Orange as the instrument of God's providence in a series of pamphlets in 1689, including <span class="italic">Reflections on the Occurrences of the Past Year</span> and <span class="italic">The True English Government, and Misgovernment of the Four Last Kings</span>. In <span class="italic">Authority Abused by the Vindication of the Last Years Transactions</span> (1690), Stephens spoke of having joined William at Sherborne, Dorset, in 1688 and he pledged the support of himself and five sons (some of whom were probably stepchildren). His argument justifying this support emerged most clearly in <span class="italic">An apology for Mr. R. Stafford, with an admonition to him and such other honest mistaken people</span> (1690), in which Stephens urged the taking of the oath of allegiance to William while observing that men owed a higher duty to God and &#145;the intire State according to the true Constitution&#146;. He argued that English kings were originally elective and still required the people's consent to confirm their &#145;mutual Contract&#146;. James had broken this &#145;Publick Trust for the Common Good&#146;, seeking to be absolute and arbitrary, and his overthrow was therefore not rebellion but a just war against what Stephens characterized as &#145;King-Craft&#146;  (pp. 4&#150;10, 13).<br>
<br>Stephens believed the revolution would lead to national reformation and reverse the growth of impiety and debauchery, which he wrote against in 1688, but by 1690 he was already voicing disillusion that church and government under William had embraced rather than opposed vice and corruption. In that year he drafted a bill for the &#145;Reformation of the Manners of the People of this Nation&#146;, but claimed it was prevented from being introduced into parliament by the bishops. His campaign against sin and vice led Josiah Woodward to name him among a number of &#145;worthy Divines&#146; whose actions gave rise to the Society for the Reformation of Manners in the 1690s  (Woodward, 73). Stephens himself claimed to have been the movement's main founder and he criticized the membership for failing to &#145;follow your Leader&#146; during the decade. He became alienated by what he saw as excessive caution in the face of parliamentary and episcopal pressure, and accused the reformers of sinking into &#145;empty Formality, Affectation and Vanity&#146;  (E. Stephens, <span class="italic">A Seasonable and Necessary Admonition to the Gentlemen of the First Society for the Reformation of Manners</span>, 1700, 4, 6).<br>
<br>Stephens transferred his energies to leading a London religious society, &#145;a small Company of Poor People &hellip; bearing a Testimony for God&#146;, while in his writings assailing bishops, clergy, MPs, government ministers, Catholics, Quakers, republicans, Erastians, latitudinarians, deists, Calvinists, and the &#145;promiscuous Multitude&#146; (E. Stephens, <span class="italic">A Kind Invitation to the People called Quakers</span>, 1696, 4; Stephens, <span class="italic">Letters and Papers</span>). He also published learned treatises on the ancient church for use by the society, notably <span class="italic">The Liturgy of the Ancients Represented, as Near as Well may be, in English Forms</span> (1696). Stephens repeatedly denounced the 1552 <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> as representing the curtailing of true reformation by Archbishop Cranmer, the &#145;False Prophet&#146; of &#145;that Beast, Hen. 8th&#146;  (<span class="italic">Seasonable and Necessary Admonition</span>, 6). He argued for a return to ancient liturgical forms, which he felt were to some degree better represented by the first <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> of Edward VI's reign and the Scottish prayer book of 1637. In particular, Stephens believed that there should be a daily celebration of holy communion to express devotion and foster religious observance, using terms which clearly acknowledged the saving reality of the body and blood of Christ in the eucharist. The religious society he formed began daily communion at a private house on 6 January 1694, moving in the following year to a church in the City of London and continuing to meet into the eighteenth century, despite official disapproval. Stephens also urged closer communion between English and Greek churches and, according to Hearne, he regularly delivered the sacrament to the biblical scholar Johann Ernst Grabe &#145;after the manner of the Greek church&#146;. Hearne recalled that his piety led some to call him Father Stephens or Abbot Stephens, although Stephens complained that he was also branded Madman Convert (<span class="italic">Remains</span>, 323, 361; Stephens, <span class="italic">Letters and Papers</span>, 2.4). In the preamble to a collection of tracts which he gathered in 1702 and gave to the Bodleian Library, Stephens protested that recent works which he intended for use by members of convocation had been suppressed, and in the year of his death he said court proceedings arising from his writings against Roman Catholicism had cost him &pound;3000.<br>
<br>In 1704 Stephens observed that he had lived &#145;above the ordinary Age of Man&#146; and had now left the employments of the world  (Stephens, <span class="italic">Letters and Papers</span>, 4.1). He died in April 1706 and was buried at Enfield by his son-in-law, the Revd Dr Udall. The nonjuror Hearne claimed that Stephens too had died a nonjuror, despite his having sworn loyalty to William and Mary in 1689 and urged others to do the same. In 1701 Stephens wrote that he would abide by his oath to the king but added that &#145;I refuse to take it again&#146; for &#145;good reasons&#146;. The reasons were not specified, although elsewhere he attacked civil authority over the church and latitudinarian acceptance of the &#145;secular Deprivation&#146; of clergy (Stephens, <span class="italic">Letters and Papers</span>, 2.2; E. Stephens, <span class="italic">An Abstract of Common Principles &hellip; Against the Politick Machinations of Erastian Hereticks</span>, 1700, 2).<br>
