<span class="headword">McConnell,  Primrose</span>  (1856&#150;1931), <span class="occ">farmer and writer</span>, was born on 11 April 1856 at Lessnessock, Ochiltree, Ayrshire, the son of Archibald McConnell (1821&#150;1898) and his wife, Agnes Milroy (1830&#150;1897). At this time his father held the tenancy of Lessnessock Farm, Ochiltree, but in 1862 he took the tenancy of Castle Mains Farm, New Cumnock, a few miles to the east, and there McConnell spent his boyhood. He was sent to Ayr Academy, and from there he took up an engineering apprenticeship in Glasgow, which he did not complete. Instead he went to the University of Edinburgh to read agriculture, and in 1878 he obtained the diploma of the Highland and Agricultural Society. In 1889, when the university instituted the degree in agriculture, he returned to take the examinations and was the second student to be awarded the BSc.<br>
<br>By the 1880s the reduction in land and sea transport costs, resulting from the expansion of the American railway network and the introduction of steamships on the north Atlantic, had had the effect of reducing cereal prices in those European countries which adopted free trade practices. The then prevalent farming systems on the Essex clays were ill-equipped to cope with falling prices. McConnell was one of the first of many who had been brought up on small Scottish dairy farms to see the potential other use of such land, relatively close to large urban markets. In 1883 he took the tenancy of Ongar Park Hall farm near Epping, converted it to milk production, and farmed there, initially in partnership with his father, until 1905. As soon as he was established in farming, McConnell married on 10 January 1884 Katherine Anderson (1857&#150;1930), daughter of the Free Church minister at New Cumnock, whom he had known since childhood. They had a daughter and two sons. In 1905, following a dispute over farming methods with his landlord, he gave up his tenancy and bought the 500 acre North Wycke Farm at Southminster, near the coast between the Crouch and Blackwater estuaries. There he remained for the rest of his life, dairy farming&#151;he built up a much visited herd of 100 cows, an enormous number in that period&#151;and writing.<br>
<br>Farming, and writing about farming, formed the core of McConnell's life. As a profit maximizing adopter of science based farming techniques, he was a pioneer of twentieth-century farming methods. In addition to making careful evaluations of new devices, such as milking machines, he also developed his own: principal among these was the hay sweep, which he claimed to have introduced from the United States of America and adapted to English conditions. He also lectured, at various times, at the universities of Glasgow and Oxford. But he was most widely known as a writer. He began with journalism, writing to the farming papers at the age of eighteen. Indeed, he later claimed that some articles he had written for the Scottish agricultural press in 1883 formed one of the motivating forces in the influx of Scottish farmers to Essex. His first and best-known book, <span class="italic">The Agricultural Notebook</span>, was published in 1883, the year he took on his first farm. It went through eleven editions and sold 45,000 copies in his lifetime, and it remained in print in its nineteenth edition in 1996 as an agricultural textbook written by a team of authors. McConnell also wrote <span class="italic">Elements of Agriculture</span> (1896), <span class="italic">The Complete Farmer</span> (1908, 2nd edn 1910), a more detailed agricultural textbook, and many other contributions to textbooks and journals. <span class="italic">The Elements of Agricultural Geology</span> (1902) brought together his professional concerns with agriculture and his serious amateur interest in geology (he became a fellow of the Geological Society in 1900), in an account of the relationship between the underlying rocks and associated farming systems.<br>
<br>From 1905 McConnell edited his own journal, <span class="italic">Farm Life</span>. Some of the pieces he wrote for this were later reprinted as <span class="italic">The Diary of a Working Farmer</span> (1906), his only non-technical book. It contains some of his most engaging writing and the only surviving published photographs in which he can be definitely identified; they show him at about the age of fifty, a full-bearded man of middling height and build, with a piercing gaze. His personality, too, appears through the pages of the diary: he was a teetotaller and dissenting churchman with immense energy, fond of the physical work of the farm, surrounded, in his later years at least, by piles of manuscripts and proofs, but always able to find time to play with his grandchildren; he was irascible and tolerant in turn, insatiably curious, and unwilling to take himself too seriously.<br>
<br>McConnell died on 7 July 1931, at North Wycke, and was buried four days later in the nonconformist burial-ground at Southminster.<br>
