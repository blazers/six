<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sutcliffe,  Reginald Cockcroft</span>  (1904&#150;1991), <span class="occ">meteorologist</span>, was born on 16 November 1904 at Wrexham, north Wales, the third son in a family of four brothers of Ormerod Greenwood Sutcliffe (1870?&#150;1928), manager of Wrexham Co-operative, and his wife, Jessie (<i>d</i>. 1942), daughter of Robert Cockcroft. Both parents were from Yorkshire, where they returned soon after Sutcliffe was born, his father becoming manager of the Co-operative at Cleckheaton, between Huddersfield and Bradford. After attending the local primary school, Sutcliffe won a scholarship to Whitcliffe Mount grammar school. He was a brilliant student, excelling in mathematics and physics, becoming head boy, and captaining the school at both football and cricket. From Whitcliffe he gained a scholarship to Leeds University, where he obtained first-class honours in mathematics and was among the best four students of his year. He continued his studies for a PhD in statistics under Professor Berwick, whom he later followed to University College, Bangor. He then joined the Meteorological Office in 1927 and served in a number of posts, including four years in Malta where he worked for a time with the distinguished Scandinavian meteorologist Tor Bergeron. In Malta he married, on 25 March 1929, Evelyn Williams (1908&#150;1998), whom he had met at Bangor. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>After returning to Britain in 1932 Sutcliffe worked at a number of outstations and was to make a major impact upon meteorology with his renowned book <span class="italic">Meteorology for Aviators</span>, published in 1939. This became the standard meteorological text for Royal Air Force flight crews during the Second World War&#151;and hence for senior captains of Britain's civil airlines afterwards. To the British aviator of this generation the terms &#145;meteorology&#146; and &#145;Sutcliffe&#146; were almost synonymous. His wartime career saw him forecasting for flying operations in northern France; being evacuated to Britain just before Dunkirk; returning to southern France to forecast for operations over northern Italy; and, with the final collapse, being one of the last British servicemen to escape via the sea route through Marseilles and Gibraltar. Perhaps his greatest contribution came at 3 group headquarters, Bomber Command, with his crucial role in forecasting for bombing operations over Germany. He also participated in the discussions on forecasts for D-day. At the end of the war he became chief meteorological officer to the British forces in Germany with rank of group captain, and played a vital part in rebuilding the German meteorological service.<br>
<br>Sutcliffe laid the foundations for his work on atmospheric dynamics before the war, publishing important papers during 1938&#150;9 and somehow finding time to extend his thinking in 1942 with a fundamentally important paper written in collaboration with the little-known Belgian meteorologist O. Godart, whom he held in high regard. Vital to Sutcliffe's thinking was the use of pressure instead of height as vertical co-ordinate in the atmosphere, and his ideas attained operational usage at 3 group. His most famous publication, the seminal &#145;A contribution to the problem of development&#146;, appeared in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society</span> for 1947, during the post-war reconstruction period. He was now in the forefront of British, and indeed world, dynamical meteorologists. In subsequent reorganizations he became, in 1948, the first assistant director of forecasting research and, in 1957, the first director of research in the office's history. He was president of the Royal Meteorological Society from 1955 to 1957 and, in the wider field of the World Meteorological Organization, served as president of the commission for aerology from 1957 to 1961, president of the International Association for Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics from 1967 to 1971, and chairman of the WMO advisory committee from 1964 to 1968, making important contributions to the education and training programme. His election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1957 was widely regarded as an indication that weather forecasting had advanced to the status of a true mathematical and physical science, and could henceforth be ranked with any other branch of geophysics.<br>
<br>Retirement from the Meteorological Office in 1965 did not end Sutcliffe's career. The paucity of tertiary level teaching of meteorology in Britain had always concerned him, and he now turned his attention to founding a new meteorological department at Reading University&#151;a task he accomplished before finally retiring from working life in 1970, handing over the reins to Professor Robert Pearce. Sutcliffe contributed two books and well over eighty publications to the literature on meteorology. His many honours included appointment as OBE in 1942 and CB in 1961. He received the Buchan prize (1950) and Symons gold medal (1955) from the Royal Meteorological Society, being elected an honorary member in 1976, and receiving the Charles Chree medal from the Physical Society in 1959. Tall and distinguished, he was a stimulating and sometimes controversial companion whose world status was shown by his obtaining the International Meteorological Organization prize in 1963, and by his election to honorary membership of the American Meteorological Society in 1975. He died at Cadmore End, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, on 28 May 1991 and was buried at Halkyn churchyard, Holywell, Flintshire, overlooking the Dee estuary. He was survived by his wife and two daughters.<br>
