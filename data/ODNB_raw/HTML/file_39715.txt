</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Philipps, Sir  John</span>, sixth baronet  (1700&#150;1764), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 8 November 1700, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37850/', "Sir John Philipps, fourth baronet (c.1666&#150;1737)")</script>, politician, of Picton Castle, Pembrokeshire, and his wife, Mary (1675?&#150;1722), the daughter and heir of an East India Company trader, Anthony Smith. He and his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22114/', "Erasmus Philipps")</script>, were educated by a private tutor until they both went to Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1720. John, a younger son without expectations, soon decided on a legal career and entered Lincoln's Inn in August 1721; he was called to the bar in 1727. By then he had married, on 22 September 1725, a London bride, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1788), the daughter of Henry Shepherd. His father marked the occasion by giving him the Pembrokeshire estate of Kilgetty, worth &pound;400 a year. The Philipps family was related to the prime minister, the two brothers being first cousins of Sir Robert Walpole's wife, Catherine. In 1724 John gave young Horace Walpole, the future diarist, &#145;a little riding mare&#146;, and presented the Walpole family with a genealogical chart purporting to show their joint descent from the medieval Welsh prince Cadwalladar. In 1727 Lady Walpole was godmother to his first child, John. The boy died of influenza in 1733, but there were seven further children of the marriage, his heir, Richard, being born about 1742.<br>
<br>Picton Castle was a whig stronghold, and Philipps naturally tried to exploit his family's connection with the whig ministry. In 1727 he vainly sought a place, as a bankruptcy commissioner. As late as 1735 he and Erasmus Philipps persuaded Sir Robert Walpole to kill an election petition against Erasmus as MP for Haverfordwest. Yet both brothers were opponents of his ministry. Horace Walpole later stated that John became a tory only because Sir Robert had not given him patronage. This claim does not accord with his role as founder secretary, in 1726, of the Society of Sea Serjeants. For this was an electoral organization, as well as a social club, in south-west Wales dedicated to securing the return of opposition MPs. It was not the Jacobite club of repute, but that Philipps himself had Jacobite sympathies is indicated by his possession of appropriate glassware and literature. He never became involved in plotting a Stuart restoration, though his cousin Horace Walpole regularly attributed disaffection to him.<br>
<br>It was the Sea Serjeants' control of Carmarthen that enabled Philipps to enter the House of Commons in 1741, and, already an experienced barrister, he soon made his mark in parliament by intemperate attacks on the ministry of Lord Carteret, whom Philipps compared unfavourably with Walpole: &#145;The late minister was too wise a man &hellip; to advise the King to employ Hanoverians, to render him odious to his British subjects&#146;  (Chandler, 14.190&#150;94). A frequent debater, by the time he succeeded his unmarried brother as baronet and master of Picton Castle, on 15 October 1743, Philipps was already a member of the &eacute;litist tory club the Loyal Brotherhood. Little over a year later, in December 1744, he was appointed a lord of trade when the new prime minister, Henry Pelham, took a few tories into office. But he refused to accept the implicit obligation of supporting government in debate, and informed the Commons on 29 January 1745 that &#145;the late change in my circumstances has produced no change in my way of thinking, nor shall produce any change as to my way of acting in this House&#146;  (Almon, 2.47). He proved to be &#145;as troublesome a placeman as a patriot&#146;&#151;so commented Lord Chancellor Hardwicke's son Philip Yorke  (BL, Hardwicke MSS, Add. MS 35337, fol. 87). Opposing ministerial policy at every turn, he personified the incompatibility of country attitudes with ministerial office and, accepting the inevitable, resigned his post in March 1745.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1747 Philipps inexplicably decided to quit parliament, though not the political scene, his importance in tory circles being signified by a DCL from Oxford University in 1749. He retained links with parliamentary tories, and involved himself in London politics. He kept in the public eye when in 1751 he challenged as a barrister the authority of parliament to punish individuals who offended it, in a speech published as a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Argument of Sir John Philipps Bart</span>. In 1754 he unsuccessfully fought Bristol at the invitation of the Tory Steadfast Society, which then paid &pound;2200 to a London ally of his, William Beckford, to give Philipps a seat at Petersfield he had kept in reserve for himself. Even independent MPs of tory hue supported government over the current imperial conflict with France, and Philipps ostentatiously did so after William Pitt became effective head of the ministry in 1756. He was now much cosseted by government: he received invitations to dine with ministers; he was permitted to enact some &#145;country&#146; measures, including an act he introduced in 1760 to strengthen the 1711 <span class="roman">Landed Qualification Act</span> for MPs; and he was even granted some patronage requests. But he never hesitated to embarrass the administration by speaking his mind. He still grumbled about military expenditure, and in 1758 seconded a <span class="roman">Shorter Parliaments Bill</span>&#151;the need for more frequent elections to purify parliament being a favourite hobby horse. Quirky in behaviour and old-fashioned in political attitudes, he came to symbolize the independent MPs in the House of Commons. And so it was he who on 18 March 1761 moved the official vote of thanks when Speaker Arthur Onslow retired after thirty-three years in the chair. This he did wretchedly, according to Horace Walpole.<br>
<br>At the 1761 election consequent on the accession of George III Philipps now took without a contest the county seat for his native Pembrokeshire. He had always continued to play a prominent role in the political and social life of south-west Wales. As president of the Society of Sea Serjeants from 1752 he organized, and largely financed, their annual weeks at seaside towns. The society by now was a social rather than a political body, and ended on his death. In more serious vein, Philipps, like his father and brother, was a keen supporter of the SPCK. At Westminster he was one of the tories who had flocked to the new king's favourite, Lord Bute, by the time he became prime minister in May 1762. High in favour at court, he was invited to second the address, and, as in 1744, was offered junior ministerial office, as a lord of the Admiralty. This post he refused, but he accepted the honour of appointment to the privy council, on 10 January 1763. But this country squire never became a tame courtier. On 2 February 1763 he objected to increased naval costs, and on 11 February he proposed a commission on public accounts to examine past government expenditure, an antiquated procedure which the embarrassed Bute ministry watered down to a committee of inquiry: George III himself had thought the idea &#145;very silly&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters &hellip; to Lord Bute</span>, 190). When Bute resigned in April 1763 Philipps was so concerned about the political situation that he took literally his duty as a privy councillor and had a private interview with his sovereign. He gave invaluable assistance to Bute's successor, George Grenville, in the 1764 parliamentary battle over general warrants, despite his own personal reservations on their legality, gaining him enough independent support to squeeze home by fourteen votes. That was his last political act, for he died suddenly, at his residence of Norbiton Place, near Kingston, Surrey, on 23 June 1764, &#145;in very odour with his present Majesty&#146;, Horace Walpole recalled in 1784  (Walpole, 33.455). He was buried in St Mary's, Haverfordwest. His heir, Richard, was in 1776 created Baron Milford in the Irish peerage, and his widow died at Norbiton Place on 28 September 1788, aged eighty-seven.<br>
