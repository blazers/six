<span class="headword">Baillie, Sir  James Black</span>  (1872&#150;1940), <span class="occ">moral philosopher and academic administrator</span>, was born on 24 October 1872 at West Mill, Cortachy, Forfarshire, the second son of William Baillie, forester, afterwards farmer, and his wife, Agnes Black. He was educated at Haddington School, the University of Edinburgh, and Trinity College, Cambridge (1897&#150;1901), and continued his studies at Halle, Strasbourg, and Paris. In 1900 he was appointed lecturer in philosophy at University College, Dundee, and from 1902 to 1924 he was professor of moral philosophy at the University of Aberdeen. His first book, <span class="italic">The Origin and Significance of Hegel's Logic</span>, appeared in 1901; a further exposition of Hegel, <span class="italic">An Outline of the Idealistic Construction of Experience</span>, followed in 1906, and a translation of his <span class="italic">Ph&auml;nomenologie des Geistes</span> (as <span class="italic">Phenomenology of Mind</span>), in 1910. On 31 March 1906 he married Helena May James (1865/6&#150;1958), daughter of John Gwynne James, solicitor, of Hereford; there were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Baillie served from 1915 to 1917 in the intelligence division of the Admiralty, and from 1917 to 1919 as an arbitrator in industrial disputes for the Ministry of Labour, developing negotiating skills which were to stand him in good stead in his later career. He was made OBE in 1918. From 1920 to 1924 he was chairman of the trade boards for the flax and hemp, aerated waters, linen and cotton household goods, and jute industries. His last major philosophical work, <span class="italic">Studies in Human Nature</span>, appeared in 1921.<br>
<br>Baillie was appointed vice-chancellor of the University of Leeds in 1924, and there devoted considerable energy to the expansion and development of the university. He inaugurated an ambitious building scheme, and his term of office saw the completion of numerous new buildings for scientific and medical departments and of the Brotherton Library, and the commencement of the students' union and the main entrance block. Earlier attempts at fund-raising through general appeals had not been notably effective; Baillie preferred to make direct approaches to wealthy individuals, a tactic which proved highly successful. A meeting with Mussolini led to the Italian government's endowment of a lectureship in Italian, and to Baillie's becoming a knight commander of the <i>ordine della corona d'Italia</i>. He received a British knighthood in 1931.<br>
<br>Baillie had a commanding presence, and on public occasions displayed a gracious manner; unfortunately he did not see fit to deploy it in dealing with his colleagues at Leeds, where his abrasive and overbearing style aroused considerable ill feeling, and his abrupt volte-faces caused bewilderment. His private diaries teem with vitriolic abuse against his staff. Unswervingly convinced of his own rightness, he reacted with baffled rage to any opposition. It is unsurprising therefore that he failed to gain an extension of his term of office beyond the official retiring age. Baillie held the conventional prejudices of his day: he commented disparagingly on the supposed &#145;black blood&#146; in Lord Harewood's family, and expressed distaste at the appointment of John Rothenstein, a Jew, as director of the Leeds Art Gallery. He combined a dour prudery with a taste for salacious gossip.<br>
<br>While vice-chancellor at Leeds, Baillie's work in the wider public sphere continued. He was a member of the royal commission on the civil service set up in 1929, chaired a court of enquiry into the Hull trawling industry in 1935, a government committee on wages and conditions in the road haulage industry in 1936, and an arbitration tribunal for the Trinidad oilfields in 1938; he was a member of the London conscientious objectors' tribunal.<br>
<br>On his retirement in 1938 Baillie moved to Weybridge, where he died of pulmonary embolism and prostate cancer on 9 June 1940. He was cremated at Golders Green, Middlesex, following a funeral service at Hersham parish church, Surrey, on 12 June. A selection from his religious commonplace book (&#145;Privatissima&#146;) was published in 1952 as <span class="italic">Reflections on Life and Religion</span>, edited by Sir Walter Moberly and Oliver de Selincourt. Baillie is presented as Sir John Evans in Michael Innes's novel <span class="italic">The Weight of the Evidence</span> (1944).<br>
