<span class="headword">Wheatley,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1305&#150;1317), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and author</span>, first appears about 1305, when he was authorized by the dean and chapter of York Minster to receive holy orders. He seems to have been related to four men with the same surname, two of whom were clergy and two staff of the king's wardrobe. William was ordained acolyte in 1305 by the bishop of Paris, perhaps having gone to that city to study, and was presented by John Droxford, keeper of the wardrobe, to be rector of Sulham, Berkshire, in 1305. In April 1306 he was described as a subdeacon and granted permission to be ordained deacon; in the following September he was licensed to study at Oxford or another English university for three years. By 1309 he had been appointed master of the grammar school of Stamford, Lincolnshire, resigning Sulham, and was promoted by 1316 to be master of the cathedral grammar school at Lincoln; both appointments belonged to the chancellor of Lincoln Cathedral. As it was usual for Lincoln schoolmasters to be masters of arts, Wheatley is likely to have graduated at this level while at Oxford. In 1317 Master William Wheatley was admitted as rector of Yatesbury, Wiltshire, on the resignation of Hugh Wheatley. William was then described as an acolyte, which conflicts with his earlier designation as subdeacon, and his tenure of the rectory is not fully dated; it is not known when he died, but the next known rector was admitted in 1331.<br>
<br>Wheatley was the author of commentaries on Boethius' <span class="italic">De consolatione philosophiae</span> and on the pseudo-Boethian <span class="italic">De disciplina scholarium</span>. The latter was written at Stamford in 1309, while the former (dedicated to Henry Mamesfeld, dean of Lincoln, among others) probably dates from his time at Lincoln. The great English famine of 1315&#150;17 prompted him to write two other short works: a tractate <span class="italic">De signis prognosticis future sterilitatis</span> (&#145;On the signs foretelling future sterility&#146;), and two hymns in honour of St Hugh of Lincoln for an entertainment on Christmas day 1316. Wheatley declared that he wrote the hymns in a year of great dearth and mortality among men and animals, &#145;intending to comfort himself and others in their misery&#146;. These works, with a letter to Roger Martival, bishop of Salisbury, are preserved in Oxford, New College, MS 264; there are two other extant manuscripts of <span class="italic">De consolatione</span> and three (a further three are lost) of <span class="italic">De disciplina</span>. A further commentary, <span class="italic">De questionibus Cratonis</span>, survives in BL, Arundel MS 52.<br>
