<span class="headword">Hill,  Oliver Falvey</span>  (1887&#150;1968), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 15 June 1887 at 89 Queen's Gate, London, the third son and seventh of eight children of William Neave Hill, manufacturer, of London, and his wife, Kate Ida, daughter of Martin Franks. He was educated at Uppingham School. Having decided to become an architect, he was advised by Sir Edwin Lutyens, a family friend, to gain experience in a builder's yard. This developed his sense of texture and materials. Simultaneously, he trained his colour sense by studying Persian and Chinese ceramics in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Between 1909 and 1911 Hill attended evening classes at the Architectural Association while a pupil of William Flockhart.<br>
<br>Hill's first major commission was to reconstruct the house and garden at Moor Close, Binfield, Berkshire, in which his love of rich colour and baroque forms was displayed. During the First World War he served in the London Scottish regiment and attained the rank of captain. After returning to architecture, he designed Cour, Argyll (1921&#150;3), a picturesque country house in local stone, and a series of houses either thatched and timbered or in neo-Georgian style, such as Cock Rock, Croyde, Devon (1926), and Woodhouse Copse, Holmbury St Mary, Surrey (1926). Hill designed furniture and paid great attention to interiors and colour schemes. He became a fashionable architect for London houses and flats, and designed two much publicized houses in Gayfere Street, Westminster, for Wilfrid Ashley (later Baron Mount Temple) in 1926 and 1931. In these, his use of mirrors and simple room arrangements indicated his developing interest in the modern movement in Europe, which became the main theme of his work in the 1930s, although never to the exclusion of other styles. Among Hill's modernist houses were Joldwynds, Holmbury St Mary (1930&#150;32), for Wilfred (later Baron) Greene; Holthanger, Wentworth, Surrey (1935); and Landfall, Poole, Dorset (1938). He also designed the Midland Hotel, Morecambe, Lancashire, in 1933 as a pioneer modernist public building, and was involved in the attempt to build a modernist seaside resort at Frinton Park, Essex.<br>
<br>As designer of the exhibition of British industrial art in the home at the Dorland Hall, London, in 1933, and the exhibition of contemporary industrial art in the home in the same hall (1934), Hill promoted modernism in architecture and household objects. He was architect of the British pavilion at the Paris Exhibition of 1937, and was involved in designing displays and selecting exhibits under the chairmanship of Frank Pick. His approach to modernism was aesthetic rather than sociological or mechanistic, although he built a fine primary school at Whitwood Mere, near Castleford, Yorkshire (1939). Architects and critics with purist views were suspicious of Hill, but he helped to popularize the modern style. He was notable for commissioning works of art for buildings and displays from Eric Gill, Eric Ravilious, John Skeaping, and others.<br>
<br>After 1945 Hill suffered neglect, although completing some fine work, notably Newbury Park bus station in Essex (1949) and Uppingham School Library and war memorial in Leicestershire (1949). He organized the Cotswold Tradition exhibition at Cirencester in 1951 with considerable panache, and retired to Daneway House, Sapperton, Gloucestershire, where he created a new garden. He wrote several books on architecture, notably <span class="italic">English Country Houses: Caroline, 1625&#150;1685</span> (with John Cornforth, 1966). He loved being out of doors, often without clothes, and kept many animals. He was tall and rather deaf, an unselfconscious eccentric, with a great appetite for work.<br>
<br>On 19 December 1953 Hill married Margaret Jeanette (Titania) Beverley (<i>b</i>. 1929/30), the musician daughter of the architect Samuel Beverley, and forty-three years his junior, who shared in the creation of a lifestyle of unworldly fantasy at Daneway; they had no children. Hill also had a long-term relationship with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31859/', "Helena Rosa Wright, n&#233;e Lowenfeld (1887&#150;1982)")</script>, family planning practitioner. He died on 29 April 1968 at home, and was survived by his wife.<br>
