<span class="headword">Lucy, Sir  Richard</span>, first baronet  (1592&#150;1667), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the second of six sons of Sir Thomas Lucy (1551&#150;1605) of Charlecote, Warwickshire, and his second wife, Constance Kingsmill. He matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1607, and graduated BA from Exeter College in 1611; he was a student of Lincoln's Inn in 1608. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17152/', "Sir Thomas Lucy (1583x6&#150;1640)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17153/', "William Lucy")</script>, bishop of St David's, were among his brothers. About 1617 Lucy married the twice-widowed Elizabeth, Lady Oxenbridge (<i>b</i>. before 1600, <i>d</i>. 1645), daughter and coheir of the chairman of the Hertfordshire bench, Sir Henry Cocke, thus becoming life owner of the Broxbournebury estate. At the time of his first marriage he was described as having &#145;tossed back red hair &amp; a long pointed chin&#146;, &#145;all ease and confidence&#146; and &#145;as if he took his puritanism lightly&#146;  (Fairfax-Lucy, 127&#150;8). Between 1645 and 1647 he married Jane, daughter and coheir of Thomas Chapman of Wormley, Hertfordshire, a draper of London. She predeceased him. Their only son, Kingsmill, failed to become MP for Brecon in 1661, but was returned for Andover in 1673.<br>
<br>Lucy inherited land in Hampshire, leased the parsonage of Broxbourne from the bishop of London, and accumulated property in four Hertfordshire parishes. He gained a knighthood and a baronetcy in 1618 and between 1630 and 1658 was chairman of the Hertfordshire bench on fifty-three occasions. He was noted for his temperate nature and ability to find compromises, as in a confrontation at Ware in 1639 over Lord Carr's seizure of post horses when Lucy prevented a duel; Lucy, &#145;a more temperate man, would rather use his authority than his courage&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1638</i>, 137&#150;9). He was instrumental in implementing Charles I's <span class="roman">Book of Orders</span> in the 1630s and in encouraging parishes to subsidize bread for the poor. He was particularly concerned about young children falling idle and finding &#145;such small work as is most meet for them according to the tenderness of their age, that idleness may not fasten in them&#146;  (Lucy to the council, TNA: PRO SP 16/189/79). He established the referral of business to divisional monthly meetings of JPs, a practice revived by him in the 1650s, but led the local opposition to purveyance, suggesting that the court of the verge should be abolished and defending county against court interests. He established the principle of no double rating for ship money and as deputy lieutenant opposed increased exactions over the militia, the payment of the muster-master, and coat and conduct money. In 1642 he was placed on both the parliamentary assessment commission and the king's commission of array, and signed the county accommodation petition. He was in France from March 1643 to mid-1644 and on his return was placed on most of parliament's local assessment and other military committees, having given up his neutrality.<br>
<br>In 1647 Lucy was returned to the Long Parliament for the earl of Salisbury's seat of Old Sarum, one of the recruiter MPs elected to fill vacancies in the Commons. He dealt largely with financial and religious matters and acted as a teller against both the &#145;presbyterian&#146; Holles and the &#145;Independent&#146; Hesilrige. He was not secluded at Pride's Purge in December 1648 but protested at the army's action and withdrew from the house. He returned to take his seat in the Rump in the following July and served on committees to consider the maintenance of the ministry, seditious writings, plundered ministers, and the corporation of the poor in London. He specialized in financial, religious, and poor-law legislation, notably that for reducing the price of corn and setting the poor on work. He opposed Hesilrige over raising militia horses for the Scottish expedition, Thomas Scott over the sale of traitors' lands, and Sir Henry Vane over the discharge of the sheriff of Nottingham. More conservative than most, he protected Salisbury's interests in the Commons and was part of his Hertfordshire syndicate in the protectorate parliaments, representing the county. In the 1656&#150;7 session he was teller against the motion for including the title lord protector in &#145;The humble petition and advice&#146;, for amendments to the catechism allowing non-compulsion, and against high assessments for the army. With the return of the Rump in 1659 he again took his seat for Old Sarum. He died on 6 April 1667, probably at Broxbourne, and left a bequest to establish a free school there, to teach the poor to read and write, as well as extensive legacies and pensions to his own servants. He was buried at Broxbourne on 12 April.<br>
