<span class="headword">Hodges,  William</span>  (1744&#150;1797), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in London on 28 October 1744, the only child of Charles Hodges, a blacksmith who owned a shop in St James's Market, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Richards, sister of the curate of St Sepulchre at Newgate. His parents placed him in William Shipley's school in 1755, where he learned to draw. While there he was brought to the attention of Richard Wilson, the landscape painter, and at the age of fourteen was articled to him for seven years as an assistant, making rapid progress.<br>
<br>Leaving Wilson's studio in 1765, Hodges joined the Incorporated Society of Artists of Great Britain where he exhibited his work including in 1766 <span class="italic">A View of London Bridge from Botolph Wharf</span> and <span class="italic">A View of Speldhurst, Kent</span>. He lived for a while in Derby where he worked as a scene-painter, returning to London in 1771. In 1772, through the intervention of Lord Palmerston, he obtained the post of draughtsman on Captain James Cook's second voyage to the south Pacific (1772&#150;5), during which he made sketches and paintings of the islands and native people. On his return he supervised the engraving (by William Woollet and others) of plates from his work as illustrations for Cook's official account, <span class="italic">A voyage towards the south pole, and round the world: performed in his majesty's ships the Resolution and Adventure in the years 1772, 1773, 1774 and 1775</span>, 2 vols. (1779). The Admiralty employed him for a further two years to make large finished oil paintings, several of which he exhibited at the Royal Academy, including <span class="italic">The War Boats of Otaheite</span> (National Maritime Museum, London) in 1777. On 11 May 1776 Hodges married Martha Nesbit at St George's, Hanover Square, London, and settled in Pimlico. However, within a year his wife died in childbirth. In 1779 Hodges travelled to India where he came under the patronage of Warren Hastings. He remained in India some six years, recording scenes of interest and architectural landmarks. Between 1785 and 1788 he published <span class="italic">Select Views in India in the Years 1780&#150;1783</span>, which included a series of forty-eight aquatints adapted from sketches drawn on the spot and engraved by him. In 1793 his <span class="italic">Travels in India, 1780&#150;1783</span> was published and illustrated with fifteen plates from his drawings. In addition Indian scenes engraved by Thomas Morris were published in the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">London Review</span>. In his <span class="italic">Cosmos: a Sketch of a Physical Description of the Universe</span>, Alexander von Humboldt says that the sight of Hodges' Indian views was one of the inducements which led him to travel  (A. von Humboldt, trans. E. C. Otte, 1849, 2.371&#150;2). Through his work Hodges made a substantial contribution to the British perception of India's past.<br>
<br>Having made a considerable fortune abroad, in 1784 Hodges settled in London at Queen Street, Mayfair, where he built himself a studio. On 16 October in the same year he married Lydia Wright, who died soon afterwards. In December 1785 he married Ann Mary Carr (<i>d</i>. 1797), a talented pianist; they had five children who survived. Hodges also had a natural son born in India who had been brought to England. His family, lifestyle, and ambitious publications soon led to a drain on his resources. In his <span class="italic">Diary</span> Farington noted on 27 September 1806 that &#145;he had many good qualities&#146; but was prone to &#145;extravagant notions caused by pride and ostentatious liberality&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 8.2863).<br>
<br>Hodges was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1786 and Royal Academician in 1789, continuing to exhibit at the Royal Academy until 1794, including in 1788 his Diploma work, <span class="italic">The Ghats at Benares</span> (RA). He is included in a group portrait of Royal Academicians (1793) by Henry Singleton. Hodges' ability was highly regarded among his fellow artists. However, during the Cook voyage he developed an individual response to the problems of representing light and meteorological conditions which brought criticism from a society not yet ready for a departure from recognized traditions.<br>
<br>In his later work Hodges showed an interest in painting in the &#145;grand manner&#146; literary subjects, including Shakespeare, in landscape settings, some inspired by the work of Salvatore Rosa, into which figures were introduced by George Romney and William Gilpin. <span class="italic">Jaques and the Wounded Stag in the Forest of Arden</span> (1789; Yale U. CBA, Paul Mellon collection), from Shakespeare's <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, was exhibited at Boydell's Shakspeare Gallery, as was <span class="italic">Portia's Garden</span> (1790) from <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, said in a contemporary review to be &#145;eminently brilliant&#146;  (Press Cuttings, 1790, 2.558, V&amp;A.). This was engraved together with other work from the period including <span class="italic">The Belisarius</span> (1794), dedicated to Warren Hastings (now known only from the engraving by J. Ogborne). About 1790 he travelled on the continent and visited St Petersburg, of which he painted a view. Hodges' attempt to elevate landscape painting as a method of expressing moral values resulted in two large canvases entitled <span class="italic">The Effects of Peace</span> and <span class="italic">The Consequences of War</span> exhibited in Daniel Orme's room, 14 Old Bond Street, London in December 1794. The political nature of the paintings brought condemnation from the duke of York, who felt they showed &#145;sentiments not suited to the public tranquillity&#146; and ordered the exhibition closed  (Edwards, 251). Discouraged, Hodges gave up his profession and left London with his family in July 1795 to settle in Brixham, near Dartmouth, Devon, where he opened a bank. Contemporary financial problems proved the ruin of his small firm, however. His sudden death in Brixham on 6 March 1797 was precipitated by a fever and gout in the stomach. His wife survived him by a few months. Examples of his drawings are in the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London; the National Archives of Canada, Ottawa; the Mitchell Library, Sydney, and the Commonwealth National Library, Canberra, Australia. His paintings are in many collections in the USA, India, and Great Britain including the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut, the National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi, and the India Office and the Tate collections. All of the known paintings from his voyage with Cook, officially undertaken for the Admiralty during it and on his return, are in the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, which in 2004 also acquired a copy of the prints made from Hodges's contentious <span class="italic">Peace</span> and <span class="italic">War</span> canvases of 1794. A second pair of the prints subsequently passed through the London art market in 2007.<br>
