<span class="headword">Parry,  John Humffreys</span>  (1816&#150;1880), <span class="occ">serjeant-at-law</span>, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21423/', "John Humffreys Parry (1786&#150;1825)")</script>, antiquary, and his wife, a daughter of John Thomas of Llanfyllin, was born in London on 24 January 1816. He received a commercial education at the Philological School, Marylebone, and spent a short time in a merchant's office in London; but his literary talents made commerce distasteful to him, and he accepted a post in the printed book department in the British Museum. While thus occupied he attended lectures at the Aldersgate Institution and studied for the bar. He was called to the bar in June 1843 by the Middle Temple. He joined the home circuit, and soon obtained a good criminal business, becoming prominent at the central criminal court and the Middlesex sessions. His appointment as a serjeant-at-law, in June 1856, gave him access to better work in the civil courts, where, thanks to an admirable appearance and voice, great clearness and simplicity of statement, and the tact of a born advocate, he was very successful in winning verdicts. He was also prominent in compensation cases, especially for the London, Brighton, and Coast Railway. He obtained a patent of precedence in 1864 from Lord Westbury after lords Campbell and Chelmsford had refused it on the mere ground of his being a serjeant  (Ballantine, 207), and he afterwards led the home circuit. In November 1878 he was elected a bencher of the Middle Temple. He was best-known for several notorious cases: the trial of Manning in 1849; of M&uuml;ller, for the murder of Mr Briggs, in October 1864; the Overend and Gurney prosecution in 1869; the indictment of Arthur Orton, the Tichborne claimant, in 1873&#150;4; and <i>Whistler v. Ruskin</i> in November 1878. In the last he appeared for Whistler, his own rather melodramatic court style fitting the odd nature of the case and helping to secure a verdict which did not punish his client.<br>
<br>In politics Parry was an advanced liberal. At the time of the first Chartist movement he sympathized with the more moderate of their views, and knew many of their leaders, and assisted William Lovett in his latter days. Parry was also one of the founders of the Complete Suffrage Association in 1842. In 1847 he unsuccessfully contested Norwich against Lord Douro and Sir Samuel Morton Peto and in 1857 was beaten in Finsbury by Tom Duncombe and William Cox, coming third at the poll, and spending &pound;790.<br>
<br>Parry published <span class="italic">Lord Campbell's Libel Act</span> (1844) and <span class="italic">A Letter on Feargus O'Connor</span> (1843). He was twice married: first to Margaret New, who died on 13 September 1856; and afterwards to Elizabeth Mead, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14/', "Edwin Abbott (1808&#150;1882)")</script>; she predeceased him by a few hours. Parry died on 10 January 1880 at his house, 66 Holland Park, Kensington, of congestion of the lungs, aggravated, it is said, by the faulty drainage of the house. He was buried at Woking on 15 January 1880. He had two sons, of whom the elder, John Humffreys, an actor, died in 1891. The second was <a name="cosubject_62452"></a><span class="headword">Sir Edward Abbott Parry</span>  (1863&#150;1943), <span class="occ">judge and author</span>, who was born on 2 October 1863. He was a barrister and, from 1894 to 1911, a county court judge based in Manchester, later becoming prominent for chairing tribunals. He was knighted in 1927. Parry was also a prolific author and dramatist and a theatre producer, describing his varied life in <span class="italic">My Own Way</span> (1932). He was twice married: first to Helen (<i>d</i>. 1932), daughter of Thomas Hart; second, in 1936, to Ellen Ann Page. He died on 1 December 1943.<br>
