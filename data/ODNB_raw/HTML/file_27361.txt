<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thornton,  Robert John</span>  (1768&#150;1837), <span class="occ">physician and writer on botany</span>, was probably born in London, youngest of the two sons and a daughter of the writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27352/', "Bonnell Thornton (1725&#150;1768)")</script>, who died before his son's birth, and his wife, Sylvia, daughter of Colonel John Braithwaite. After early private education, and intended for the church, Thornton entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1786 aged eighteen, but was drawn into medicine. He was strongly influenced by the botanical lectures of Professor Thomas Martyn, who introduced him to Linnaeus's sexual system for plants. Subsequently he attended lectures by Henry Cline and William Babbington at Guy's Hospital medical school, and graduated as MB at Cambridge in 1793. His thesis on &#145;oxygen air imbibed by the blood&#146; signals the interests in life forces in terms of the new chemical theories of Lavoisier and others that were to characterize much of his subsequent writings.<br>
<br>After travels in Scotland, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, and Germany, Thornton set up as a physician in London in 1797, using techniques advocated by Thomas Beddoes (founder of the Pneumatic Institute and follower of the Brunonian system), which involved the inhalation of &#145;factitious airs&#146;, including laughing gas. He had already begun the publication of <span class="italic">The Politician's Creed</span> (8 vols., 1795&#150;9) and <span class="italic">The Philosophy of Medicine, being Medical Extracts</span> (4 vols., 1796, and subsequent editions). Apart from an uncertain income from popular writing, Thornton appears to have depended upon practising medicine for his living, since he additionally became an MD of the University of St Andrews (1805), and a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians (1812). However, in 1796 he was appointed lecturer on medical botany at Guy's and St Thomas's hospitals, and was devoted to the latter science. Already he was working on a gigantic literary speculation which was to ruin him. This work, the <span class="italic">New Illustration of the Sexual System of Linnaeus</span> (better known under its 1804 title of <span class="italic">The Temple of Flora</span>), was first advertised in 1797 and began to appear in parts from 1799, published by T. Bensley and priced at 1 guinea (later 25<i>s</i>). The complete text with illustrations was advertised as available in 1799 for 20 guineas. Its bibliographic history was complicated, the three main parts being issued at a variety of times and in different formats. Thornton's subsequent publications, including <span class="italic">Botanical Extracts</span> (2&#150;4 vols., 1810) and <span class="italic">The British Flora</span> (5 vols., 1812), annexed material from the <span class="italic">New Illustration</span> in a characteristically opportunistic and bibliographically confusing manner. The huge costs of illustration and printing seriously eroded Thornton's personal fortune. As a promotional exercise in 1804 he exhibited the originals of his plates at 49 New Bond Street, and in 1811 an act of parliament (51 George III, cap. 103) authorized his &#145;Royal Botanical Lottery&#146;, for which he issued 20,000 tickets at 2 guineas each. The top prize was the set of original paintings, with other prizes of his printed illustrations and texts. In spite of his efforts to market his publications, his finances never recovered.<br>
<br>At the heart of the <span class="italic">New Illustration</span> was Thornton's scheme to produce a specifically British botanical publication of a magnificence to surpass all previous examples. Teams of master engravers and colourists, including Francesco Bartolozzi, Richard Earlom, and John Landseer, used the full range of modern printing techniques to produce coloured illustrations after paintings by such prominent artists as Sir William Beechey, James Opie, Henry Raeburn, John Russell, Abraham Pether, and his two favoured illustrators, Peter Henderson and Philip Reinagle. The illustrations were not restricted to the &#145;choicest flowers&#146; in the world, but included portraits of eminent botanists&#151;including the famous portrait of Linnaeus in Lapp (Sami) dress&#151;elaborate allegories, such as &#145;Cupid Inspiring the Plants to Love&#146;, and a bust of Linnaeus being honoured by Aesculapius, Flora, Ceres, and Cupid. The text, which includes a translation of Linnaeus's &#145;Prize dissertation&#146; on the sexuality of plants (1759), is similarly not bound to accounts and texts of scientific botany, but deals with a wide range of religious, political, spiritual, social, and emotional issues, not only in prose but also through extensive use of poems by modern and ancient authors. It is easy to regard much of this material as irrelevant to the publication's botanical aims, but this is to miss the universal human and religious purposes of botanical learning in Thornton's system of thought.<br>
<br>The tenor of Thornton's enterprise shares much in common with Erasmus Darwin's poem <span class="italic">The Botanic Garden</span>, especially the second part, <span class="italic">The Loves of Plants</span> (1789), but Thornton's fervent religious beliefs, moral conservatism, royalist passion, and disgust for the French Revolution stand in marked contrast to Darwin's radicalism and libertarianism. For Thornton the study of botanical science in the wake of Linnaeus's system of classification inculcated, particularly in the young, a love of order and proper feelings of awe for divine providence. The power of love expressed by plants through their sexual activities, conducted with instruments of such beauty and wonder, provided exemplary expressions of the highest sentiments which human beings could attain in the context of conjugal fidelity. His dedicatee, Queen Charlotte, who had given her family name to <i>Strelitzia</i> (the &#145;queen plant&#146;, imported by Sir Joseph Banks), provided the supreme model. Her chastising letter to the king of Prussia, lamenting the miseries of European wars, was quoted by Thornton among the supporting material for his plate of roses (drawn by himself) to reinforce his advocacy of universal peace. The botanical diversity of the world, the result of the wide variety of geographical habitats, gave unequivocal support for the notion of free trade rather than military conquest and perpetual strife: Thornton's model of peaceful civilization for the world was that provided by Britain under its monarchy.<br>
<br>The twenty-eight illustrations in the <span class="italic">Temple of Flora</span> in its large format (about 24 &times; 18 in.) are the most overtly dramatic in the history of botany. Each plant is characterized assertively against an evocative background. The &#145;Night blowing cereus&#146; from Jamaica, as drawn by Reinagle, is shown in a moonlit landscape of church and &#145;dimpled&#146; river by Pether; the &#145;American cowslip&#146; appears in front of a sea view with sailing ships, evoking travel; the &#145;Egyptian bean&#146; assumes a geometrical air before the pyramids; while the &#145;Dragon arum&#146; displays the &#145;confusion dire&#146; of its phallic sexual equipment against a stormy mountainscape, appropriate for such a &#145;foetid&#146; plant. The settings are not consistently ecological; rather they play in various ways to the plants' aesthetic potential, their exotic origins, the seasons and times of their flowering, their personalities and emotional associations, their socio-political connotations, and, above all, to their significance within the spiritual system of meaning in God's creation. The plates may be seen as complementary to the other systems of illustration used by Thornton, ranging from diagrammatic tabulations of the sexual organs according to the Linnaean system and illustrations of experiments, to pictorial representations of the &#145;anatomy&#146; and &#145;dissection&#146; of particular flowers.<br>
<br>Viewed as a whole, Thornton's publications embrace, in a single if loosely organized system, many of the varied motivations in British science at the turn of the century: a respect for experiment; a search for systems of mathematical rigour; an awe at the power of life forces, particularly those of chemical and electrical nature; a rhapsodic delight in the magic of nature in all its dramatic manifestations; a strong sense of national pride in the political and scientific achievements of Britain; a love of freedom in nature and society, as opposed to continental mores; an enthusiasm for the role of lavish, large-scale illustrations for the portrayal of truths of man and nature; and, above all, a keen awareness of the supreme power of the provident creator, designer of the &#145;great chain of being&#146;, at the top of which stand God's Englishmen.<br>
<br>The date of Thornton's marriage to his wife, Susannah, is not known; two children, Robert John and Septima Elizabeth, were baptized in 1817. He continued to write popular or elementary books on his favoured botanical, educational, and religious themes, including <span class="italic">A New Family Herbal</span> in 1810 with illustrations by Thomas Bewick, and <span class="italic">Illustrations of the School Virgil</span> (1814), the second edition of which contained woodcuts by William Blake (1824). His final publication was <span class="italic">The Lord's Prayer, Newly Translated with Notes</span> in 1827. Thornton had failed to recover his losses from <span class="italic">The Temple of Flora</span> when he died at Howland Street, Fitzroy Square, on 21 January 1837, leaving his children on the edge of poverty. <span class="italic">The Temple</span> has been characterized as a visually magnificent failure, with &#145;little botanical value&#146;  (Blunt and Stearn, 236), but this is to misunderstand its place in Thornton's writings and within a particular phase of British science in the era of Romanticism.<br>
