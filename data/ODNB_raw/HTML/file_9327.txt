<span class="headword">Ferguson, Sir  Ronald Craufurd</span>  (1773&#150;1841), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 8 February 1773, the second son of William Ferguson of Raith, Fife, and Jane, second daughter of Ronald Craufurd of Restalrig, sister of Margaret, countess of Dumfries. Ferguson attended Edinburgh high school (1787&#150;8). He entered the army as an ensign in the 53rd regiment on 3 April 1790, and was promoted lieutenant on 24 January 1791. He then made a long visit to Berlin during which he attended the Berlin military academy (1791&#150;3), and studied the Prussian military system. On 19 February 1793, after his return to England, he was promoted captain; and on the outbreak of war with France his regiment was sent to Flanders, where it was brigaded with the 14th and 37th under the command of Major-General Ralph Abercromby, who quickly recognized Ferguson's ability.<br>
<br>Ferguson served throughout the campaign of 1793, at the siege of Valenciennes, and in the battles which precipitated the duke of York's retreat from Dunkirk. In October 1793 the 53rd formed part of the garrison of Nieuport under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Grey. The regiment was heavily engaged in the fighting in front of the town. Ferguson, who was wounded in the knee, was mentioned in dispatches. He left Flanders on being promoted major into the 84th regiment on 31 May 1794. On 18 September 1794, though still only twenty-one, he was promoted lieutenant-colonel and appointed to command the newly raised 2nd battalion of the 84th. He was immediately ordered to India, and in 1795 his regiment was one of those from India which, under Major-General Sir Alured Clarke, captured the Cape of Good Hope.<br>
<br>On his return to India, Ferguson was stationed at Cawnpore, and there, on 4 January 1798, he married Jean, the illegitimate daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19546/', "General Sir Hector Munro")</script>; they had one surviving son. This marriage greatly increased his wealth and importance, enabling Ferguson to gain further employment. He returned to England and was promoted colonel on 1 January 1800; later that year he held a command in Major-General Thomas Maitland's attack on Belle &Icirc;le, and during Sir James Pulteney's expedition against Ferrol. He was one of the officers who returned home disgusted by Pulteney's refusal to attack Ferrol. In 1804 Ferguson was appointed brigadier-general commanding York district, and in the following year he took command of the Highland brigade, consisting of the 71st, 72nd, and 93rd highlanders, in the expedition commanded by Sir David Baird to recapture the Cape of Good Hope. He performed the difficult task of landing his brigade in the face of Dutch resistance and covering the disembarkation of the rest of the army. His conduct during the ensuing engagements won him the thanks of Baird.<br>
<br>Ferguson was forced to leave the Cape by illness brought on by a liver complaint. On his return to Britain he was elected MP for Kirkcaldy burghs in 1806, a seat which he held for twenty-four years, and on 25 April 1808 he was promoted major-general. In that year Ferguson was appointed to command a brigade in the army under Sir Arthur Wellesley (later duke of Wellington), destined to assist the Portuguese, and at the landing of the expedition at the mouth of the River Mondego he was placed in command of a brigade consisting of the 42nd and 78th regiments. At the battle of Roli&ccedil;a, Ferguson's brigade was employed upon the extreme left, and twice turned Laborde's right, after an advance along a difficult mountain road. William Warre, an aide-de-camp to Ferguson, observed that the whole brigade worshipped its leader &#145;for his bravery and skill and coolness in fire like hail about him&#146;  (L. James). At the battle of Vimeiro (21 August) the brigade was posted on the left of the British army, and Ferguson had just begun to pursue Junot when he was checked by Sir Harry Burrard. Ferguson received praise of the highest order in Wellesley's dispatch, and was thanked in his place in the House of Commons for his services. He also received a gold medal and was gazetted colonel of the Sicilian regiment on 25 January 1809.<br>
<br>Ferguson was nominated to a command in the force sent under Sir David Baird to join Sir John Moore in the Peninsula. However, it reached Corunna too late to be of any assistance. He returned home on February 6, and during the following months distinguished himself with his speeches in parliament against the duke of York during the debates on the Clarke scandal. Ferguson's obvious liberalism was also apparent in other episodes, notably his criticism of the convention of Cintra and Wellesley's part in it, a view he was later forced to retract.<br>
<br>On 4 June 1813 Ferguson was promoted lieutenant-general. In 1814 he acted for a short time as second in command to Sir Thomas Graham in the Netherlands, and in the following year he was made a KCB. Ferguson never again saw service, but he continued to represent Kirkcaldy burghs until 1830. Throughout this period of tory ascendancy Ferguson distinguished himself in the House of Commons by his radicalism. He supported measures of civil and religious liberty, Catholic emancipation, the ballot, and triennial parliaments. In 1819 he protested against the government's coercive measures.<br>
<br>Though he remained a whig partisan, Ferguson was disposed to give an independent support to Wellington in 1827, for which he obtained a crack regiment: he was transferred to the colonelcy of the 79th Cameron Highlanders on 24 March 1828. He was promoted general on 22 July 1830, and made a GCB at the coronation of William IV in 1831. In 1830 he was defeated at the election for Kirkcaldy burghs by the tory candidate, Lord Loughborough. However, he was immediately elected for Nottingham, a seat he held until his death. In December 1840 he succeeded to the family estate of Raith, on the death of his elder brother, Robert, who had also for many years been a radical MP. He died at Bolton Row, Piccadilly, London on 10 April 1841, and was succeeded in his Scottish estates by his only son, Colonel Robert Ferguson, who sat for Kirkcaldy burghs from 1841 to 1862, and took the additional name of Munro on succeeding to some of the estates of his grandfather, Sir Hector Munro, of Novar, Ross, and Cromarty.<br>
