<span class="headword">Blair,  Robert</span>, Lord Avontoun  (1741&#150;1811), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Athelstaneford, Haddingtonshire, Scotland, the third son of the minister of the parish, the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2570/', "Revd Robert Blair (1699&#150;1746)")</script>, author of <span class="italic">The Grave</span>, and his wife, Isabella (<i>d</i>. 1774), eldest daughter of William Law (<i>d</i>. 1728) of Elvingston, Haddingtonshire, professor of moral philosophy in the University of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Blair began his education at the grammar school at Haddington; from there he was sent to the high school at Edinburgh, where he formed a lifelong friendship with Henry Dundas, afterwards Viscount Melville. Thence he was transferred to the university. In 1764 he was admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates and he soon obtained a considerable practice at the bar, where he and Henry Erskine were often pitted against each other. On 19 May 1786 he married Isabella Cornelia (1766&#150;1857), third and youngest daughter of Colonel Charles Craigie Halkett of Lawhill, Fife. They had a son and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1789 Blair, having served some years as an advocate-depute and as an assessor for the city of Edinburgh, was appointed solicitor-general for Scotland. About this time he bought a small estate at Avontoun, Linlithgowshire, where he took much pleasure in agricultural pursuits. He continued to occupy his post until the change of ministry that was occasioned by Pitt's death in 1806. During this period he twice refused the offer of a seat on the judicial bench, and in both 1802 and 1805 he declined to accept the office of lord advocate. In 1801 he was elected dean of the Faculty of Advocates. Upon the return of the tory party to power in 1807 he refused the offices of solicitor-general and lord advocate but in the next year, upon the resignation of Sir Ilay Campbell, he accepted the presidency of the college of justice. He had been chosen as a safe pair of hands, his good legal mind more than compensating for a lack of eloquence, at a time of prospective upheaval in the court of session. During his presidency the court was split into two divisions, and rules were introduced to cut down the number of appeals to the House of Lords in an effort to expedite Scottish justice.<br>
<br>Blair died suddenly on 20 May 1811 at his home in George Square, Edinburgh. Melville, who travelled to Edinburgh purposely to attend the funeral, was taken ill and died on the very day that Blair was buried, 28 May. Blair's wife and children survived him, but he left them so badly off that a pension was granted by the crown to his widow and daughters through the instrumentality of Mr Perceval.<br>
