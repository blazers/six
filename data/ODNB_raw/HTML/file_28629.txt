<span class="headword">Walter</span> <span class="st"> [Walter of Lorraine]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1079?), <span class="occ">bishop of Hereford</span>, was of Lotharingian origin, according to John of Worcester. He evidently must have been one of the fairly numerous group of Lotharingian clerics invited into England by Edward the Confessor to serve the royal court. The life of King Edward refers to Walter as a man of learning. He became chaplain to Edith, Edward's queen, before 1060. <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> records that he held from King Edward the church of the manor of Basingstoke, Hampshire, in 1066. This church had no connection with the endowments of the see of Hereford and may have been remuneration for his position as chaplain. At Christmas 1060 Ealdred, bishop of Worcester, who had been supervising the see of Hereford in the vacancy following the death of Bishop Leofgar in July 1056, was made archbishop of York, and Edward appointed Walter bishop of Hereford. To avoid being consecrated by Archbishop Stigand, Walter and a fellow bishop-elect, Giso of Wells, were commanded by Edward to travel to Rome so that they could be consecrated by Pope Nicholas II. They probably formed part of the band of English travellers to Rome headed by Earl Tostig and Ealdred, the newly appointed archbishop of York. The consecration took place during the Easter Synod of 1061 (15 April). On the first day of the return journey, the group of English travellers was ambushed and had to return to Rome, and the date of Walter's return to England is uncertain, although if he accompanied Giso he would have reached England in June.<br>
<br>Walter seems to have played, as bishop, little part in public life either before or after the conquest, although after Hastings he was one of the bishops who submitted to William the Conqueror at Berkhamsted. He also attended the ecclesiastical councils held at Windsor, on 27 May 1072, and London, between Christmas 1074 and Michaelmas 1075. Walter's activities within his diocese are hard to trace. No charter issued by him survives. He seems to have allowed some of his church's holdings to depreciate and, in exchange for less valuable land, granted to William fitz Osbern, earl of Hereford, a site which William promptly used to set up a huge new market place, outrivalling the previous market, which had been in the part of the city belonging to the bishop.<br>
<br>Walter's death is not recorded in any narrative source save William of Malmesbury's <span class="italic">Gesta pontificum</span>, where it is said that the bishop, consumed with lust for a seamstress in Hereford, lured her into his palace on the pretext of requiring clothes to be made for his attendants, that when he tried to rape her she stabbed him with a pair of scissors, and that William the Conqueror suppressed news of this story for fear of scandal  (Malmesbury, <span class="italic">De gestis pontificum</span>, 300). Since Malmesbury introduces the story with the phrase &#145;unless rumour lies&#146; it is possible that it was merely gossip, though the silence of other sources on Walter's death may perhaps suggest that his decease was not wholly respectable. Certainly Hereford Cathedral made no attempt to record his death in its obit book nor to include Walter in the series of elaborate tombs constructed in the late thirteenth century to commemorate most of the post-conquest bishops. Walter died before 29 December 1079, when his successor, Robert the Lotharingian, was consecrated. His place of burial is unknown.<br>
