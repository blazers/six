<span class="headword">Eustace,  James</span>, third Viscount Baltinglass  (1530&#150;1585), <span class="occ">nobleman and rebel</span>, was the eldest son and heir of Sir Roland Eustace, later second Viscount Baltinglass (1504&#150;1579), and Joan, daughter of James Butler, Lord Dunboyne. The family had a long and distinguished record of royal service in Ireland, in both central and local government. This loyalty was rewarded when Thomas, James's grandfather, was granted the viscountcy and lands of Baltinglass, a dissolved abbey in Wicklow, by Henry VIII in 1541. Although Sir Roland continued the tradition of government service after his succession as viscount in 1549, he was a vehement opponent of the cess, the state's policy of arbitrary taxation for victualling the army in Ireland. After his release from some months' imprisonment in 1577&#150;8, he engaged in a bitter dispute with Marshal Nicholas Bagenal over oppressive billeting of the army on his estate at Kilcullen, co. Kildare.<br>
<br>On his father's death in 1579, James succeeded to the title and estates. His early education had been under the tutelage of Norman Eustace, a cousin and Roman Catholic priest. In 1567 James was admitted to Gray's Inn, London. By then he was married to Mary (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1548), daughter of Sir John Travers, master of the ordnance in Ireland; the marriage was childless. While a student in London, Eustace may have been confirmed in his zeal for Catholicism. On his return to Ireland, he came under the influence of the Jesuit Robert Rochford and of Edmund Tanner, Roman Catholic bishop of Cork, and he travelled to Rome in the mid-1570s.<br>
<br>Eustace's recusancy was manifested when he was fined and imprisoned by the court of high commission for flouting the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> in 1578. His religious disaffection led him to question the right of Queen Elizabeth to be monarch of Ireland. Influenced by radical priests such as Rochford and Tanner, Eustace was prepared to take militant action which, for him, was the logical imperative of the papal bull of excommunication of the queen. Although viewed as &#145;a very simple man without wisdom, manhood or any other quality meet to embrace such an enterprise&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/79/26, i), Baltinglass organized a conspiracy comprising some of the leading lords in Leinster and elsewhere. Both the earl of Kildare and the baron of Delvin were implicated in plans for an uprising but withdrew on its eve. Concurrently with renewed insurrection in Munster, Baltinglass prepared for a military campaign, drawing in his fellow gentry of the pale and the Gaelic clans of southern Leinster, led by Feagh McHugh O'Byrne. The paramount chieftain of central Ulster, Turlough Luineach O'Neill, also evinced interest. With the help of prominent Dublin merchants (who supplied him with munitions) and the blessing of the priests, Baltinglass declared himself to be in rebellion against Queen Elizabeth in mid-July 1580, rejecting her claim to be supreme governor of the church as a woman &#145;uncapax of all holy order&#146;, and condemning &#145;the oppression of poor subjects under pretence of justice&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/74/62).<br>
<br>The administration of Arthur, Lord Grey of Wilton, feared that a countrywide campaign with continental aid was imminent. The alarm became more acute when Baltinglass, Feagh McHugh O'Byrne, and their allies inflicted a severe defeat on the English forces in Glenmalure in Wicklow on 25 August 1580. This ambush deterred the state army from campaigning in the mountainous countryside, and thereafter the uprising took the form of raid and counter-raid in the southern pale. The state's effort was not helped by the ambiguous stance of the earl of Kildare who, with the baron of Delvin, was arrested and imprisoned in Dublin Castle at Christmas 1580. A confederacy of Delvin's connections in Meath and Kildare failed to aid Baltinglass militarily, however, and by the spring of 1581 Grey's attritional war had begun to succeed. The massacre of a continental force at Smerwick in November 1580 and the wearing down of the Munster rebels dashed hopes of extra-provincial assistance, and a series of arrests and surrenders of Baltinglass's relatives and allies left him with a dwindling force. Eventually he opted to flee the country with the aid of some Wexford sailors, and sailed for the Iberian peninsula to seek more support from the Spanish king.<br>
<br>The trials of the captured rebels took place in November 1581, and at least twenty were convicted of treason and executed. Among these were Baltinglass's brother, Walter, and several cousins and followers, many of whom went to the scaffold professing their Catholicism. The estates of the rebels, including those of the viscount, were confiscated in the aftermath of the uprising, the act of attainder finally passing through the Irish parliament in 1585. Having spent time in Lisbon and Rome, Baltinglass had moved to Madrid by 1584. His embassy at the court of Philip II of Spain did not bear fruit, though his presence there was a source of alarm to the authorities in Dublin Castle. He died at Madrid on 24 November 1585.<br>
<br>Viscount Baltinglass's rebellion emanated from his own zeal for the restoration of Catholicism as the official state religion, and he struck a chord with opponents of state political and religious policies in many parts of Ireland. A small group of priests orchestrated the enterprise, but the failure of the earl of Kildare to commit himself was a major blow to the viscount's hopes. Most of the disaffected palesmen eschewed military confrontation, preferring to use constitutional means in pursuit of their political ends. Undoubtedly, however, the bravery of Baltinglass and his followers served to galvanize many of the Old English population into recusancy.<br>
