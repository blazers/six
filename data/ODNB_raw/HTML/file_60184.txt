<span class="headword">Turner, Sir  Eric Gardner</span>  (1911&#150;1983), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born at 437 Glossop Road, Sheffield, on 26 February 1911, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36591/', "William Ernest Stephen Turner (1881&#150;1963)")</script>, professor of glass technology at the University of Sheffield, and his first wife, Mary Isobel Marshall (<i>d</i>. 1939). After dame-school and preparatory school, he attended King Edward VII Grammar School, Sheffield, and in 1930 went up to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he took firsts in classical moderations (1932) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1934). After graduating he turned his attention immediately to the texts, both literary and documentary, preserved on papyrus in the dry climate of Egypt. In the only surviving account Turner gave of his career, when elected to a corresponding fellowship of the Austrian Academy in 1975, he attributed his choice to the influence of Hugh Last. It is clear that for his European audience he spoke of his teachers as professors, without attempting to explain the institution of tutorial fellows, for Turner mentioned Gilbert Murray, professor of Greek, along with Last. He was perhaps influenced by the fact that Last became professor of Roman history at Oxford from 1936 to 1948, whereas in 1934 he was tutorial fellow at St John's College. A near contemporary of Turner who graduated in 1939 recalls the brilliance of Last's lectures, and it may be that, even before his appointment as professor, Last was a natural source of advice to those interested in Roman history. Turner's tutor in papyrology was Colin Roberts, but it was Last who introduced Turner to Sir Idris Bell.<br>
<br>Turner taught classics at the University of Aberdeen from 1936 to 1948, apart from service at Bletchley Park from 1941 to 1945, working in naval intelligence: he later remarked that he had known before Hitler that the <i>Bismarck</i> had been sunk. On 3 October 1940 he had married Louise Barbara Taylor, a modern historian; their children Hilary and Nicholas were born in 1942 and 1944. In 1948 Turner was appointed to a newly created readership in papyrology at University College, London, becoming professor <i>ad hominem</i> in 1950 and remaining there until his retirement in 1978. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1956, became CBE in 1975, and was knighted in 1981.<br>
<br>In addition to research and the normal run of teaching and administration, Turner undertook a series of tasks which changed the face of classical and papyrological studies in the United Kingdom and overseas. First, he helped to create the Institute of Classical Studies in 1953, and became its first director. In that context he demonstrated by his example the importance of a commitment to research seminars, setting high standards by his contributions to discussion. (He also for many years chaired the committee of the Warburg Institute.) Despite recurring illness, from 1956 to 1978 he chaired the Egypt Exploration Society, rebuilding relations with Egypt after the Suez crisis. In the context of the British Academy, he was a member of the organizing committee of the Corpus Vitrearum Medii Aevi, picking up the work of his father, who in 1915 had created at Sheffield a department of glass technology. One of Turner's last major articles, in <span class="italic">Antike Kunst</span> 24 (1981), set out to identify as deriving from a comedy a scene portrayed on a Hellenistic glass beaker. Turner also played a major part in the work of the overseas policy committee and through it in that of the Union Acad&eacute;mique Internationale. For much of the scholarly world in Europe, America, and elsewhere he <i>was</i> papyrology, and many of the leading papyrologists of the next generation were his pupils.<br>
<br>Turner's greatest achievement was to revitalize publication of the collection of papyri from Oxyrhynchus owned by the Egypt Exploration Society. These had been entrusted to Edgar Lobel, whose interest was limited to Greek poetry. With humour, tact, and firmness Turner persuaded Lobel to release texts in which he was not interested, initially for presentation and discussion at seminars, and got the enterprise as a whole moving. He signed his first preface as general editor of the series in 1954 and by 1961 had achieved an annual rhythm for the appearance of the volumes.<br>
<br>Apart from publishing, with scholarly annotation, hundreds of new texts, Turner wrote three major books on his work, two of which are indispensable handbooks for anyone who cares about the transmission of knowledge in and about antiquity: <span class="italic">Greek Papyri: an Introduction</span> (1968; 2nd edn, 1980), <span class="italic">Greek Manuscripts of the Ancient World</span> (1970; 2nd edn, 1987, published after Turner's death but following his design and incorporating his material), and an exploration of the origin of the form of the book with which we are familiar today, <span class="italic">The Typology of the Early Codex</span> (1977). A characteristic piece of work is the publication, in <span class="italic">Museum Helveticum</span>, volume 33 (1976), of a papyrus of part of a satyr-play, the fourth element in the complex of plays presented by the Athenian tragedians at the annual dramatic festivals. Turner was able to show that the play had been rewritten so as to exclude the letter sigma, thus providing an example of one of the more bizarre byways of Greek literature. His work also appeared in major contributions to, and encouragement of the contributions of others to, the understanding of the Athenian comic playwright Menander.<br>
<br>In retirement Turner settled in Fortrose, Ross-shire. He died on 20 April 1983. His obituarist for the British Academy, Peter Parsons, placed him below the greatest in the two fields of literary and documentary papyri, but few have done as much as he in both. The range over which, and the care with which, he worked, evident also for instance in his British Academy obituary of the numismatist Derek Allen, gave him both an astonishing sense of the overall shape of the material of which time has left us a rather erratic selection (see in particular his chapter on the nature of papyrological evidence in <span class="italic">Cambridge Ancient History</span>, 7, pt 1, 1984) and an outstanding ability to transmit his understanding to others. His enjoyment of great music, as performer on the violin and listener, and of good food, good wine, and congenial company, was simply the other side of his urge to share with others what he found good.<br>
