<span class="headword">Bonham, Sir  (Samuel) George</span>, first baronet  (1803&#150;1863), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born at Faversham, Kent, on 7 September 1803, the son of Captain George Bonham (<i>d</i>. 1810) of the naval service of the East India Company and his second wife, Isabella Baines (<i>d</i>. 1852), only daughter of Robert Woodgate of Dedham, Essex. He had one sister, Isabella, who married Ferdinand, count d'Oultremont, of Belgium. On 16 June 1846 he married Ellen Emelia (<i>d</i>. 1859), eldest daughter of Thomas Barnard of the East India Company; they had one son.<br>
<br>In 1837, after a period of service with the East India Company, Bonham was appointed governor of the incorporated settlement of Prince of Wales Island, Singapore, and Malacca. He held this post until 1843, during which time he acquired a measure of knowledge of the Chinese language, customs, and habits; later in his career he was said to prefer officials who had not learned the language, believing that the &#145;study of Chinese warped the intellect and undermined the judgement&#146;  (Coates, 83). On 20 March 1848 he was appointed by Palmerston to succeed Sir John Davis as governor of Hong Kong and her majesty's plenipotentiary and superintendent of trade in China.<br>
<br>The issue of British entry into Canton (Guangzhou) had not been resolved during Davis's governorship and was to dominate Bonham's time in office. Davis had reached an agreement with the imperial commissioner at Canton, Qiying, for the British to be given admittance to Canton in 1849; however, Qiying had been replaced in 1848 by the ferociously anti-foreign Xu Guangjin, who rebuffed Bonham's attempts to negotiate the preliminary arrangements for British entry. The British government was unwilling to force the issue at this time, and Palmerston's instructions to Bonham to let the matter stand in abeyance were taken by the Chinese as a sign of their victory in the matter. Warnings to the emperor's court that British actions were taken from a position of strength, not weakness, were greeted with derision in Peking (Beijing).<br>
<br>In Hong Kong itself Bonham's governorship met with mixed reviews. The German missionary and official Ernst Johann Eitel (1838&#150;1908) considered him a &#145;model Governor, the first really popular and successful one of the Colony's rulers&#146;  (Eitel, 287), while recognizing that there were those in the Hong Kong community who viewed him as &#145;a useless governor, purely ornamental, highly decorated and extravagantly paid&#146;  (ibid., 286). His relationships with his subordinates were seldom easy, as he had a tendency to bully them: with Rutherford Alcock and his own eventual successor, John Bowring, then consul in Canton, his relations were particularly tense. In 1851 he was made a KCB for his services in China, and the following year was created a baronet. In April 1853 he led the first foreign mission to meet the Taiping insurgents, securing from them rights for foreigners to enter their territory and trade there; he recommended that the British government maintain a position of neutrality towards the rebels, rather than support the Manchu government, as was being urged in some quarters.<br>
<br>Bonham retired from his appointments in China on 12 April 1854 and returned to England, where he died at the Great Western Railway Hotel, Paddington, on 8 October 1863. His son, George Francis, of the diplomatic service, succeeded to the baronetcy.<br>
