<span class="headword">Sever,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1471), <span class="occ">college head</span>, came from the diocese of Winchester, but his family background is obscure. First recorded in 1419, when he entered Merton as founder's kin, he was successively a bachelor fellow (admitted <i>c</i>.1420) and fellow (1423&#150;37). He had graduated BA by 1422; he subsequently became a master of arts and was awarded a doctorate in theology before 1438. In the meantime he had been ordained deacon and priest in 1430, and subsequently entered the service of the crown, being appointed a chaplain to the king in 1437. Two years earlier, on 12 May 1435, he had become a canon of the collegiate church of St Mary Magdalene at Bridgnorth, Shropshire, which was a royal peculiar, and he later held a number of other important benefices, many of them as the result of royal patronage; these included a canonry in St Stephen's Chapel, Westminster, a prebend in St Paul's, London, where he eventually became chancellor, the deanery of Bridgnorth, and the wardenship of the king's free chapel in Tickhill Castle, Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Sever plainly stood high in the king's favour, for on 11 October 1440, in his charter of incorporation, Henry VI appointed him to be the first provost of the new royal foundation of Eton College, a post he held until 1442. He may have left the king's service in some disfavour, however, for in the following year Oxford University, whose chancellor he had become about October 1442, asked Pope Eugenius IV (<i>r</i>. 1431&#150;47) to write to Henry VI in terms that would advance Sever in the king's favour. The appeal may have been effective, for by 1448 Sever had become the king's almoner, a post he still held in 1454&#151;when the king's stables were reduced in that year, Sever was given fifteen of the king's horses.<br>
<br>Sever had been an unsuccessful candidate for the wardenship of Merton College in 1437, but he was elected to this position on 19 February 1456. His learned theological disputations were highly regarded by his Oxford contemporaries. He acted for the university to receive donations, especially books, for the library founded by Humphrey, duke of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1447), and he himself built up a considerable working theological library, which between 1466 and 1468 he presented to Merton College. His gifts to the college have led to some authors describing Sever as Merton's &#145;second founder&#146;, inspired by the inscription on his memorial describing his role there <i>ut fundator</i>. He undertook substantial building projects, including an extension to the warden's lodgings, completed in 1462 (demolished 1905&#150;7), and in 1464&#150;5 he completed the college's gatehouse. He died on 6 July 1471 in Oxford and was buried in the choir of Merton College chapel before the warden's stall; the monumental brass depicting him was later moved to the south side of the chapel, but was restored to its original position in the north transept in 1944. Sever's will, dated 4 July 1471, was proved on 27 July. His bequests to Merton included a moiety of a tenement in Fleet Street, London, a house in West Tilbury, Essex, and a silver jug with six goblets.<br>
