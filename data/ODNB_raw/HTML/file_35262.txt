<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Norwood, Sir  Cyril</span>  (1875&#150;1956), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born in Whalley, Lancashire, on 15 September 1875, the only child of the Revd Samuel Norwood and his second wife, Elizabeth Emma Sparkes. His father was head of the local grammar school at Whalley, but when this closed in 1880 the family moved to Leytonstone in Essex. Home life was marred by Samuel's drink problem; this experience left a lasting impression on Cyril, who was always deeply reserved and later became a teetotaller. He managed to support himself and his mother through his own efforts at school and university. In 1888 he entered the leading day school Merchant Taylors', in London, where he showed ability especially in classics and cricket, and became head monitor in 1893. He won a scholarship to St John's College, Oxford, and gained firsts in classical moderations (1896) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1898). One of his classics tutors described him as being &#145;among the most eminent Oxford students of his day&#146;  (A. T. Barton, letter of reference, 1 April 1902, Norwood MSS). In 1899 he headed the list for entry to the civil service by a considerable margin, and was the only candidate in his year who attained more than half marks in every subject.<br>
<br>Norwood entered the secretary's department of the Admiralty in October 1899 but he left in January 1901 to take up a teaching post at Leeds grammar school. Despite the shortness of his stay at the Admiralty, he was already highly regarded there, as he apparently showed a &#145;very considerable aptitude for administrative work&#146;, as well as &#145;a power of concentration and a sanity of judgment which, if he had remained in His Majesty's service would certainly have marked him out for promotion to the highest rank&#146;  (letter of reference, 2 Feb 1905, Norwood MSS). Later in 1901 he married Catherine Margaret Kilner, daughter of Walter John Kilner, medical practitioner, of Kensington. They were married for fifty years until her death in 1951, and had three daughters.<br>
<br>At Leeds, Norwood found his vocation as a teacher. He became sixth-form classics master and took an active part in sports, especially cricket. In 1906, at the age of thirty, he was appointed headmaster of Bristol grammar school, which was experiencing major difficulties in forging a new identity and role for itself following the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1902. During the following decade, under Norwood's headship, pupil numbers trebled, the facilities and grounds were extended, and a boarding-house was created. In 1907 he was commissioned as captain of the Territorial Force, and he commanded a company in the 4th battalion of the Gloucestershire regiment. In recognition of his achievement the University of Bristol awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1912.<br>
<br>In 1916 Norwood was appointed master of Marlborough College in Wiltshire, a traditional boys' boarding-school. In many respects this marked an important departure in his educational career, which had hitherto been spent at day schools in large cities, and his lack of boarding-school experience was the subject of criticism. He encouraged Marlborough to develop a relationship with the expanding educational agencies of the state and to make use of the opportunities offered by new developments such as the school certificate and higher school certificate examinations, while being careful at the same time to emphasize &#145;the building of character and the training for citizenship which at Marlborough must be the first considerations&#146;  (application for headship, April 1916, Norwood MSS). During his headship Marlborough enjoyed considerable academic success. By this time he had also become a national figure, and he was invited in December 1917 to become a member of the new Secondary Schools Examinations Council (SSEC), which had been created by the Board of Education. Board officials were worried that Norwood might be &#145;too engrossed with his reforms at Marlborough which are said to be extensive&#146;, but the president of the board, H. A. L. Fisher, insisted on Norwood, who struck him as being &#145;the most interesting Head Master I have yet met&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ED.12/246). Norwood became chairman of the SSEC in 1921 and was to continue in this role for a quarter of a century until his retirement (encouraged by a less sympathetic minister of education, Ellen Wilkinson) in 1946.<br>
<br>In 1926 Norwood cemented his reputation by accepting the headship of Harrow School, having been urged to take up the appointment by Randall Davidson, the archbishop of Canterbury and chairman of the Harrow governors. There his characteristic reforms to raise standards of work and discipline met with sterner resistance on the part of some staff and students, and his period there was not altogether successful or happy. Masters who resisted his authority were gradually removed. Nevertheless, his position did allow him a platform from which to seek influence in public debate about education. He had always been active in putting across his views, writing regularly on education for a wide range of newspapers and journals. In 1909 he had jointly edited (with Arthur H. Hope) a book entitled <span class="italic">The Higher Education of Boys in England</span>. In 1929, while head of Harrow, he produced his major published work, <span class="italic">The English Tradition of Education</span>. This celebrated the tradition of the boys' independent schools, which he regarded as being based on the historical ideals of knighthood, chivalry, and the English gentleman. He emphasized in particular the importance of discipline, the chapel, culture, athletics, and the ideal of service in promoting the training of character, public spirit, and leadership. This was a strongly conservative message, especially in the case of girls, who he insisted should be educated in a different way from boys. At the same time Norwood was anxious to spread the benefits of the &#145;English tradition&#146; to pupils in state secondary education, and with this in view he also advocated radical reforms in the curriculum and examinations of secondary schools. His book attracted widespread and largely admiring notices from, among others, C. W. Valentine and Michael Sadler.<br>
<br>In the 1930s Norwood's educational influence was extensive. He took a leading role in international conferences, for example in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, most notably under the auspices of the New Education Fellowship. He inspired the personal loyalty of many of his colleagues and followers such as Thorold Coade, who became headmaster of Bryanston School in Dorset in 1932, and Ronald Gurner, who held headships at boys' day schools. A distinguished and tall man with a piercing gaze, Norwood was a commanding presence at the pulpit, in the school, or in the committee room, although he was often reserved in company and tended to appear remote. An Anglican layman, he was devout in his theologically undogmatic Christianity, which he saw as fundamental to education, and was active in the Modern Churchmen's Union, of which he was president. He was no less resolute in his admiration for the ideals of Plato, which formed the grounds for so much of his hierarchical ideals as well as for his notion of citizenship.<br>
<br>Norwood left Harrow in 1934 to become president of his old Oxford college, St John's, and was knighted in 1938. His long and distinguished public career culminated during the Second World War in his central involvement in the major educational debates that led to the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1944. He was a staunch defender of the public schools at this time, when they were at their most vulnerable and most unpopular, but he also made enemies from among the public schools themselves by proposing that they should forge a new accommodation with the state. Even more controversial was his role as chairman of a committee established in 1941 to consider the secondary school curriculum and examinations. The Norwood report, as it became known, reported in July 1943, soon after the major white paper <span class="italic">Educational Reconstruction</span>. At first, this attracted less attention than the white paper, but its argument and ideals, clearly stemming in large part from Norwood himself, soon became highly contentious. Part one of the report identified &#145;three kinds of mind&#146;, and proposed that these should comprise the basis for three different kinds of secondary school&#151;grammar, technical, and modern&#151;in a new era of &#145;secondary education for all&#146;. This report was far from alone in its Platonic ideals, and in its rejection of multilateral (comprehensive) schools, but it was later held responsible by many critics for the failures of the so-called &#145;tripartite system&#146; that developed after the Second World War. The Norwood report also fell foul of established educational interests because of its call for the abolition of the school certificate examination in its existing form.<br>
<br>After his retirement to Iwerne Minster in 1946 Norwood faded from the scene, although he maintained a role in the Allied Schools, a group of schools of religious outlook founded after 1920, including Stowe and Canford, which sought to embody the tradition of the English public schools. He died in the Warneford Hospital, Oxford, on 13 March 1956 having, as the <span class="italic">Times Educational Supplement</span> (16 March 1956) expressed it, &#145;outlived his fame&#146;. His ideas appeared outdated and even irrelevant for the future of education. In the end he was regarded as too radical and unsound for the public schools, but too traditional and conservative for state secondary education in a more socially mobile, if not egalitarian, age. In the inter-war years, however, he had been among the foremost educators of his time, of conservative stamp but with the passion of a reformer. He was a successful and highly regarded scholar and headmaster. He was also among the most influential educational thinkers of the period, alongside such figures as R. H. Tawney and Fred Clarke in his public impact. He was surely unique in his capacity to operate successfully within the closed worlds of both the Board of Education and the public schools, across the contested frontiers of private and state education.<br>
