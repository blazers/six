<span class="headword">Valentine family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1685&#150;1845), <span class="occ">musicians</span>, were central to musical life in Leicester for over a century, and many enjoyed wider careers. As many members of the family had the same forename, it can be difficult to distinguish biographical evidence conclusively. Thomas Follintine, &#145;a stranger&#146;  (Hartopp, 1884), perhaps from Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, where Thomas, son of Thomas Follentine, was baptized on 28 April 1667, probably moved to Leicester about 1670 and was granted freeman status as a town wait on 2 April 1684. His eldest sons, Thomas (<i>bap</i>. 1667?, <i>d</i>. 1721) and Henry (<i>bap</i>. 1670?), were appointed waits in 1685. Henry was organist at St Martin's, Leicester, in 1701, and in 1703 was the first to become a freeman as a musician. He built the organ at Ashbourne, Derbyshire, in 1710, and later became a maltster. The younger Thomas's six surviving sons were all musicians, including David (<i>bap</i>. 1698), organist at Ludlow about 1730, and Mark (<i>bap</i>. 1701), appointed organist at St Martin's, Leicester, in 1745 at a salary of &pound;10 10<i>s</i>. per annum but sacked, following complaints, in 1748.<br>
<br>The most adventurous of the younger Thomas's brothers seems to have been <a name="cosubject_69650"></a><span class="headword">Robert Valentine <span class="st"> [Follintine]</span></span>  (<em>bap. </em>1674), <span class="occ">composer</span>, baptized at St Martin's, Leicester, on 16 January 1674, the son of Thomas Follintine and his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1684?). Further information about his life is mostly circumstantial. His education is unrecorded, and he did not become a town wait. By 1708 he was established in Rome, where his <span class="italic">Sonate di flauto</span> op. 2 was published with a dedication to Sir Thomas Samwell, later MP for Coventry, who was in Italy on his grand tour. Between April 1708 and March 1710 he was employed as an oboist at the Ruspoli palace in Rome, and he may have moved to Naples in 1710, as his <span class="italic">Twelve Sonatas</span> op. 3 (1710) is dedicated to John Fleetwood, the British consul there, and one of his concertos appears in a Naples manuscript of 1725. His <span class="italic">Twelve Solos</span> op. 12 (1730) was dedicated to the duke dell' Oratino, a Neapolitan nobleman. He is supposed to have returned to England in 1731, when his complete works were published by John Walsh, but there are no mentions of concert appearances in the London newspapers, and details of his death are unknown. He composed many tuneful sonatas and concertos, mostly for the recorder or flute, which remained popular among amateur musicians. Manuscripts of his compositions can be found at the Naples conservatory, at Uppsala University and Rostock University, and in the Biblioteca Comunale, Assisi, the Herzog-August-Bibliothek, Wolfenb&uuml;ttel, and the British Library.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_69651"></a><span class="headword">John Valentine</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1730, <em>d.</em> 1791), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was the grandson of the younger Thomas Valentine (<i>bap</i>. 1667?, <i>d</i>. 1721) and thus Robert Valentine's great-nephew. He was baptized at St Margaret's, Leicester, on 7 June 1730, the son of John Valentine (<i>bap</i>. 1699, <i>d</i>. in or before 1754) and his wife, Sarah (1693?&#150;1763?). No record of his education exists, but he was probably apprenticed to his father, or an uncle, and he was made a freeman of Leicester on 16 April 1754. He married Tabitha Simpson (<i>b</i>. 1728) on 1 May 1755 at Aylestone, Leicestershire, and by 1759 he owned a music shop in New Bond Street, Leicester, which he later transferred to the Market Place by 1768, and then to Belgrave Gate by 1774. According to Kroeger he performed at concerts throughout the midlands from Matlock Bath to Market Harborough, primarily as a violinist, but he taught everything from the harpsichord to the french horn: in 1769 he advertised his fees&#151;10<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. entrance, and 15<i>s</i>. a quarter&#151;in the <span class="italic">Leicester and Nottingham Journal</span>, together with a comprehensive selection of instruments and music for sale. He composed mostly music for amateurs, including three sets of marches and <span class="italic">Eight easy symphonies &hellip; designed for &amp; dedicated to, all junior performers and musical societies</span>, op. 6. On 27 February 1762 his only theatrical piece, <span class="italic">The Epithalamium in the Tragedy of Isabella, or, The Fatal Marriage</span>, was performed in Leicester by Durravan's Company of Comedians, and on 5 May 1763, a day of thanksgiving following the treaty of Paris, his <span class="italic">Ode to Peace</span> &#145;was performed in a grand chorus of voices and instruments&#146;  (Thompson, 113). His other compositions include <span class="italic">Thirty Psalm Tunes</span> and a sycophantic <span class="italic">Ode on the Birthday of the Marquis of Granby</span>. Some of his manuscript compositions are in the British Library. He died in Leicester on 10 September 1791 and was buried at St Margaret's, Leicester, on 12 September 1791.<br>
<br>Three of his children became musicians, the most prominent being <a name="cosubject_61896"></a><span class="headword">Ann Valentine</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1762, <em>d.</em> 1845)<span class="occ"></span>, who was baptized at St Martin's, Leicester, on 15 March 1762. She probably received her musical training from her father, and in 1777 she performed a harpsichord concerto at &#145;Mr Valentine's Annual Concert at Rugby&#146;  (Kroeger, 450). William Gardiner, whose writings are entertaining but not always totally reliable, noted that she usually played music by Handel, either an organ concerto or a harpsichord lesson, as the &#145;wretched little piano fortes of the day&#146;  (Gardiner, 67) were not suitable for concerts. About 1785 she was appointed organist at St Margaret's, Leicester, and from 1791 she lived in Belgrave Gate, where she perhaps continued to run her father's music shop. She composed <span class="italic">Ten sonatas for the piano forte or harpsichord with an accompaniment for the violin or german-flute</span> op. 1, <span class="italic">A Collect for the Sixth Sunday after Trinity</span>, a song, &#145;Ye Gentlest Gales&#146;, and seven piano pieces. According to the records of St Margaret's, when she died on 13 October 1845 she was living at Coleshill, presumably in Warwickshire; she was buried at St Margaret's on 20 October 1845.<br>
<br>Sarah Valentine (1771&#150;1843), Ann's younger sister, lived with her at Belgrave Gate and was also a professional musician. Her only known composition is <span class="italic">The British March and Quickstep &hellip; for the Pianoforte</span>: a copy, bound with a collection of Ann's music, is in the Lilly Library, Indiana University. In 1800 Sarah replaced Miss Greatorex as organist at St Martin's, Leicester, receiving 150 votes against the one vote received by Frederick Hill, the other candidate. Another versatile member of the family was a brother of Sarah and Ann, Thomas Valentine (1757&#150;1800), the eldest son of John, who performed in a concert as a singer and violinist in 1771. In 1774 he advertised in the <span class="italic">Leicester and Nottingham Journal</span> as a harpsichord teacher and tuner, and by 1784 an announcement in the same newspaper of a &#145;musical meeting&#146; at Ashby-de-la-Zouch, where he was to play first violin, described him as a member of the Covent Garden theatre. According to his obituary, also in the <span class="italic">Leicester and Nottingham Journal</span>, when he died at Wrexham, Denbighshire, he was organist to Sir Watkins Williams Wynn at Ruabon, and his military compositions were particularly admired.<br>
<br>In March 1773 a concert advertised for Thomas's benefit broke a mutual contract between John and his first cousin Henry Valentine (<i>b</i>. 1725), who owned a music shop in East Gate, Leicester, and played the oboe. According to a notice Henry placed in the <span class="italic">Leicester and Nottingham Journal</span>, he and John had agreed to share all profits of benefit concerts equally, and so he appealed to the &#145;impartial public&#146; to support him in a future concert of his own. This took place in June 1773, but the conflict was apparently short-lived, as by September Henry and John again organized a joint benefit concert.<br>
<br>A Mrs Valentine, whose first name is not recorded, frequently took part in Leicester concerts. In 1765 she sang a cantata by John Stanley and a song with guitar accompaniment at a Valentine benefit concert, by 1767 she had her own series of benefit concerts, and in 1774 she performed on the musical glasses. It seems that she was Mary Geary, the wife of Henry: Kroeger surmises that she was probably not John's wife, Tabitha, as she sang at Henry's concert in June 1773 when the cousins were in dispute.<br>
<br>According to Gardiner, the fortnightly subscription concerts in Leicester were a financial success because the performers were mostly amateurs and &#145;Misses Ann and Fanny, and Messrs John and Henry Valentine, and Robert jun.&#146;  (Gardiner, 67) were paid only 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. a night. Works played included &#145;the concertos of Corelli, Handel, Geminiani, Stanley, and Avison; the symphonies of Martini, Stamitz, Abell, Maldere, Vanhall, and Ditters&#146;  (ibid.) and a sinfonia by Haydn, whose music had apparently not been heard in Leicester before. Robert Valentine (<i>b</i>. 1762) and Fanny Valentine (<i>b</i>. 1770) were children of Henry and Mary: Fanny, who for a short time was also an actress, sang &#145;grave songs from Handel's oratorios, and now and then a Vauxhall ballad&#146;  (ibid., 67&#150;8), and Robert, who became a freeman in 1784, may have been &#145;Mr Valentine, the professor&#146;, who in 1794 took part with William Gardiner and Abb&eacute; Dobler in a performance of Beethoven's violin trio in E[flat] &#145;well before any of Beethoven's works had been heard elsewhere in England&#146;  (ibid., 113).<br>
<br>After Ann's death in 1845 no further Valentines seem to have been important to the musical life of Leicester, but the British Library catalogue contains many works by others who may have been members of the same family, including John, who wrote <span class="italic">The Elements of Practical Harmony, or What is Generally Called Thorough Base</span> (1834), and Thomas, who composed over 150 piano pieces, mostly arrangements of popular airs with variations.<br>
