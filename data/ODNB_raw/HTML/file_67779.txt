<span class="headword">Marshall,  Rebecca <span class="st"> [Beck]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em>1660&#150;1683), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was accused by Nell Gwyn of being &#145;a Presbyter's praying daughter&#146; and Samuel Pepys was told that she and her sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67768/', "Anne Marshall (later Anne Quin)")</script> were the daughters of the famous puritan divine Stephen Marshall  (Pepys, 8.502&#150;3). He was misinformed: their father was probably another, much more obscure, clergyman, chaplain to Lord Gerard of Gerard's Bromley, Staffordshire. Their father's first name is unknown; their mother was named Elizabeth. Rebecca Marshall may have been active in the King's Company at Vere Street in their first season of 1660&#150;61, having been sworn a member of that company in 1661 according to lord chamberlain records; however, these lists are difficult to interpret. One 1663 roster of sworn actors lists her.<br>
<br>As with many performers of this period, the biographical evidence that exists about Marshall concerns her stage life. Her first recorded role was Colona in John Ford's <span class="italic">Love's Sacrifice</span> (no later than August 1664). She was primarily known for her portrayal of tempestuous, passionate women, usually in tragedies. For example, she played the queen of Sicily in John Dryden's <span class="italic">Secret Love</span> (1667), Lyndaraxa in both parts of Dryden's <span class="italic">The Conquest of Granada</span> (1670&#150;71), Fulvia in William Joyner's <span class="italic">The Roman Empress</span> (1670), and Calphurnia in Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span> (<i>c</i>.1672). The roles usually offset those played by another actress of the same company, Elizabeth Bowtell. Numerous rival pairs were written so the company could take advantage of the contrast between Marshall's fiery characters and Bowtell's sweet ones (demonstrating how contemporary playwrights deliberately created roles to match the strengths of individual company players). For example, Marshall played Olivia against Bowtell's Fidelia in William Wycherley's <span class="italic">The Plain Dealer</span> (1676), and she played Roxana against Bowtell's Statira in Nathaniel Lee's <span class="italic">The Rival Queens</span> (1677).<br>
<br>The characters Marshall played on stage seem to reflect her own character. In a deposition of February 1667 she stated that she &#145;taxed&#146; Sir Hugh Middleton &#145;with some ill language he had cast out against the women actors of that house&#146;, and she accused him of &#145;calling her Jade, and threatning he would kick her and that his footman should kick her&#146;. Middleton waited outside the playhouse, &#145;which gave her some apprehension that he lay in wait to doe her some mischief or affront&#146;, and finally, she complained, some ruffian she believed to have been hired by Middleton followed her home and approached her in the street, where he &#145;clapd a Turd upon her face and haire&#146; and ran away  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 7.426). This was not the only time Marshall had public problems with men. Some time about spring 1665 she petitioned the king for protection from one Mark Trevor. Actresses were often vulnerable to threats and insults from spectators and others who regarded them as servants of the public.<br>
<br>Later legal papers indicate that Marshall sued Mary Meggs, the King's Company orangewoman, in November 1669 for &#145;abusing&#146; her, and that Marshall was sued for debt by Richard Uttings, beginning in May and continuing at least into late June 1672  (Milhous and Hume, 1.110). The evidence suggests a woman not much afraid of speaking her mind, nor of confrontation. Some time in the spring of 1677 Marshall left the King's Company and joined the Duke's Company at their Dorset Garden theatre. Her only known role after this move was as Maria in Thomas D'Urfey's <span class="italic">A Fond Husband</span> (1677). She seems to have left the stage after that date, and no death date has been discovered.<br>
<br>The only two other pieces of information about Beck Marshall that survive from after 1677 concern her personal life. An anonymous manuscript &#145;Lampoon&#146; (<i>c</i>.1678) at Harvard suggests that she had had a daughter, though no other evidence supports this. This poem also calls her a &#145;Proud Curtizan&#146; and, although this is not an unusual accusation for an actress of this period, an anonymous &#145;Satyr on both Whigs and Tories&#146; of 1683 implies that she had been the mistress of the &#145;famous fop&#146; Sir George Hewitt. This is the last known reference to this colourful and important Restoration actress.<br>
