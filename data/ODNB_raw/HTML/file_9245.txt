<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fechter,  Charles Albert</span>  (1822&#150;1879), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, was born on 23 October 1822 in Hanway Yard, Oxford Street, London (though Vapereau, in his <span class="italic">Dictionnaire des contemporains</span>, claimed Belleville, Paris, was his birthplace), the twelfth in a family of thirteen children. Though the Fechters were French &eacute;migr&eacute;s, Jean Fechter, his father, was German-born, and his mother, whose maiden name was Regis, was variously described as being English or Italian by birth. Both parents were sculptors. In 1830 the family, with their two surviving children, returned to Paris, but the political turmoil, which left an enduring impression on Charles, forced them back to London. After a further six years there, during which poverty caused Jean Fechter to put his gifts as a sculptor to commercial use manufacturing bronzes and candelabras, they settled in Paris in 1836. Charles's education had not been neglected: he learned Greek and Latin at Templeton's College in London, and continued his studies for two years at Boulogne-sur-Seine. He had developed an interest in the theatre while attending performances by W. C. Macready, Charles Kean (whose natural acting he admired), and Maria Malibran, but it was to take several years for him to choose between the rival muses of the stage and the fine arts.<br>
<br>Fechter made his first stage appearance in 1840, in <span class="italic">Le mari de la veuve</span> by the elder Dumas at the Salle Moli&egrave;re, Paris, a small theatre for amateurs, after which he attended&#151;briefly&#151;the Conservatoire, and toured&#151;disastrously&#151;Italy with an itinerant French troupe. He spent three years in evening study at the Acad&eacute;mie des Beaux-Arts, and at the age of twenty-one received, on the same day, both news of the award of the first grand medal for his sculpture and the call to his d&eacute;but at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais, where he had previously auditioned. Fechter and his father tossed a coin, the outcome of which was that Charles and the theatre won, but his acting career was always distinguished by the picturesque qualities derived from his talent and training in the fine arts.<br>
<br>Unfortunately, Fechter's career was also characterized by another less admirable quality&#151;his ungovernable temper. Thus, although his d&eacute;but in December 1844 (as S&eacute;ide in Voltaire's <span class="italic">Mahomet</span> and Val&egrave;re in <span class="italic">Tartuffe</span>) at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais had gone well and led to supporting roles with Rachel, after eighteen months Fechter walked out in a glory of indignation. Estranged from the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais, he took engagements in Berlin in 1846 and the following year at the Vaudeville Th&eacute;&acirc;tre in Paris and the St James's Theatre in London, where he enjoyed the patronage of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. On 29 November 1847 he married a Mlle Rolbert, a pensionnaire of the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;ais, with whom he had a son, Paul, and a daughter, Marie, who became an opera singer.<br>
<br>Over the next thirteen years Fechter pursued his career principally in Paris. His success as Armand Duval in <span class="italic">La dame aux cam&eacute;lias</span> at the Vaudeville on 2 February 1852 established him as the first <i>jeune premier</i> in France. During 1857&#150;8 he was stage director at the Od&eacute;on, a post which he resigned in protest at the restrictions placed upon him by the government in the interest of the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais. Encouraged by his experience as a member of French companies performing in England, he determined not only to perform there again, but to perform in English.<br>
<br>Fechter applied himself to the task of perfecting the language, studying for sixteen to eighteen hours daily over a period of four months, before appearing at the Princess's Theatre under the management of Augustus Harris. For his d&eacute;but on 2 October 1860 he chose Victor Hugo's <span class="italic">Ruy Blas</span>. &#145;His accent and his gesticulations were entirely from France&#146;, <span class="italic">The Times</span> reported, &#145;but his articulation is perfectly clear&#146;  (29 October). <span class="italic">Don C&eacute;sar de Bazan</span> followed (11 February 1861), and then on 20 March Fechter set himself the challenge of one of the greatest and most demanding roles in the English theatrical repertory&#151;Hamlet. A pale Norseman with long flaxen hair, wearing a strange garb, Fechter, ignorant of rather than ignoring the accretion of tradition to which English actors deferred, gave a revolutionary and revelationary performance, devoid of declamation, but infused with passion. In his first encounter with the Ghost, instead of the points beloved of English actors, he conveyed an overwhelming sense of sorrow. The meditative element formed the core of Fechter's prince, so that in the great soliloquies &#145;the birth of his thoughts is more visible than the influence of his emotions&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 22 March 1861). He was charmingly tender with Ophelia, courteous to the players, but in the closet scene he was almost brutal towards Gertrude. In going &#145;straight from the book to the boards&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>), Fechter had released Hamlet from the straitjacket of convention in which the character had been so long confined. Charles Dickens, who initiated his friendship with Fechter after seeing him as Hamlet, wrote: &#145;Perhaps no innovation in art was ever accepted with so much favour by so many intellectual persons pre-committed to, and preoccupied by another system, as Mr Fechter's <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>&#146;  (Field, 182). In contrast, Fechter's Othello (23 October 1861) was a failure, prompting G. H. Lewes to write, &#145;His Hamlet was one of the very best, and his Othello one of the very worst I have ever seen&#146;  (Lewes, 117), though Fechter did redeem his reputation with Iago (3 March 1862).<br>
<br>On 10 January 1863 Fechter opened in <span class="italic">The Duke's Motto</span> (from <span class="italic">Le bossu</span> of Paul F&eacute;val) at the Lyceum Theatre, of which he had become lessee. There, on 27 April 1865, he appeared as Belphegor in <span class="italic">The Mountebank</span> with his son Paul, then aged seven. During his generally successful management of the Lyceum, which he concluded on 25 May 1867, he encountered the limits of English acceptance of an actor whom they regarded as French, when the prominent place which his friend J. C. M. Bellew had secured for him in the Shakespeare tercentenary celebrations at Stratford upon Avon occasioned such a storm of protest that he had to withdraw.<br>
<br>Fechter appeared at the Adelphi Theatre as Obenreizer in <span class="italic">No Thoroughfare</span> by Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins on 26 December 1867; it was the first of 157 performances. The elaborate drama <span class="italic">Monte Cristo</span> (17 October 1868) was markedly less successful, as was <span class="italic">Black and White</span> by himself and Wilkie Collins (29 March 1869). Following twelve farewell performances at the Princess's from 29 November 1869, Fechter sailed for the United States, where, after brief London engagements in 1872, he settled permanently in 1873. By then, his imperious temper was aggravated by alcoholic indulgence, which destroyed the delicacy of physique which had been one of his greatest gifts as an actor. His last original role was Karl in <span class="italic">Love's Penance</span>, his own adaptation of <span class="italic">Le m&eacute;decin des enfants</span>, at the Park Theatre, New York, on 15 April 1874. Thereafter he appeared occasionally in Boston and other towns until 1876, when, having broken his leg, he retired to his farm at Rockland Center, Bucks county, two hours by rail from Philadelphia. There he died from a disease of the stomach at 6 a.m. on 5 August 1879. On 8 August his remains were placed in a receiving vault at Mount Vernon cemetery, Philadelphia, whence they were removed the following June to a grave on which was placed a bust of the actor and the inscription &#145;Genius has taken its flight to God&#146;.<br>
<br>&#145;In delineating the heroes of romantic drama Mr Fechter had indeed no rival&#146; declared the obituary in <span class="italic">The Era</span>  (10 Aug 1879); but Fechter's posthumous reputation rests on his Hamlet, which was not only original in itself, but the cause of originality in other interpreters of the role.<br>
