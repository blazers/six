<span class="headword">Chatfield,  Frederick</span>  (1801&#150;1872), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born at 42 Welbeck Street, Marylebone, London, on 6 February 1801, the fourth and youngest surviving son in the family of five sons and one daughter of Allen Chatfield, an officer in the East India Company's maritime service, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Coggan (who was the subject of a portrait by John Opie). Little is known of Chatfield's personal life, particularly his early years. He appears to have been well educated, though the school he attended is unknown. In 1818 he was commissioned into the Life Guards, but gave this up after three years on account of the expense and instead purchased a lieutenant's commission in the 20th foot regiment. Writings in his later life reveal that he accumulated considerable personal debts in this period.<br>
<br>Chatfield began his diplomatic career in 1826 as consul to the Baltic port of Memel. A cholera outbreak there, along with Chatfield's fortune of being in Aix-la-Chapelle during the Belgian crisis of 1830, brought the young consul's reports to the attention of the foreign secretary, Palmerston. He returned to Memel in 1831 during the Polish risings, and early in 1832 was made consul at Warsaw, where he was severely critical of Russian brutality. Having gone beyond his commercial remit, he was recalled from Warsaw in August 1832. He was a strong advocate of British interests and recommended an active policy&#151;he went so far as to suggest that Poland would be useful &#145;as a Colony to England&#146;  (Chatfield to Palmerston, 16 June 1832, cited in Rodriguez, 36). In March 1833 Palmerston named him consul to the United Provinces of Central America. Chatfield appears to have had no knowledge of Central America at this time, but spent the months before taking up his position studying the history of the region and learning Spanish. He arrived in British Honduras in May 1834 and Guatemala in the following month, becoming the most significant Briton in the region for the next two decades. Apart from a brief interregnum from 1840 to 1842 he remained Britain's chief representative in Central America until 1852. In 1849 he achieved the rank of charg&eacute; d'affaires.<br>
<br>British interests in Central America long predated Chatfield's arrival. A British settlement in Honduras had been established in the seventeenth century. From this toehold British adventurers, traders, and woodcutters expanded elsewhere in the region, occupying at times the island of Ruatan in the Bay of Honduras and establishing relations with the Miskito Indians on the Mosquito Coast (the Caribbean shore of present-day Nicaragua).<br>
<br>Despite these established interests and the strategic importance of the region (an isthmian canal was already talked about in the early nineteenth century), Britain lacked a coherent policy in the years after the collapse of Spanish rule in Central America in 1821. Unlike the United States, which recognized the independence of the United Provinces of Central America in 1824, Britain never extended recognition to the Central American federation (and, indeed, would not recognize an individual state until Guatemala in 1849). British diplomacy lagged behind British commerce, which, from its base in British Honduras, quickly came to dominate the Central American market (this despite the fact that Britain had not negotiated a commercial agreement with the Central Americans, something achieved by the United States in 1825).<br>
<br>More than any other individual Chatfield formulated and implemented a British policy towards Central America during the 1830s and 1840s. He sought to incorporate the region into the British empire. He promoted the activities of British traders and woodcutters, and encouraged investment and immigration from his home country. Only by bringing Central America into the orbit of the British empire, Chatfield maintained, could its economic growth and political stability be achieved. He also sought to expand British claims and protectorates over such strategically important territories as the Bay Islands and the Mosquito Coast. British entrepreneurs in the region, as well as the superintendent of the British settlement in Honduras, Alexander Macdonald, goaded Chatfield into pursuing ever more assertive and expansionist policies.<br>
<br>If Chatfield's objective was consistent over time the same cannot be said of his tactics. Despite the legend to the contrary he advocated the union of Central American states in the 1830s, on the grounds that British interests would best be advanced through dealings with a single Central American partner. He went so far as to work alongside unionists to help draft financial legislation aimed at restoring the solvency of the government in 1837. When dissolution into several separate states became inevitable in 1839, however, he changed course and pursued a divide-and-rule strategy. By the 1840s he actively opposed Central American unionists, in large part because of their alignment with the United States.<br>
<br>Chatfield increasingly advocated intervention in pursuit of British claims and interests. His dispatches to London included unsubtle attempts to commit the Foreign Office to territorial claims or naval actions he deemed in the national interest. He had no qualms about meddling in Central American politics, nor did he hesitate to invoke the Royal Navy in discussions with his Central American counterparts. He infuriated Central Americans by refusing to discuss territorial questions on the grounds that they involved interpretation of Anglo-Spanish agreements from the eighteenth century to which they were not party. His strong-arm tactics alienated many Central American statesmen and contributed to his failure to establish a regional network of collaborating &eacute;lites. Britain's experience elsewhere in Latin America revealed the importance of forging lasting relationships with local &eacute;lites.<br>
<br>Chatfield's proclivity for liberally interpreting his instructions from London (if not disregarding them altogether) led the Foreign Office to rebuke him on several occasions. Aberdeen reminded Chatfield that he was to act &#145;not as an independent person, which you have done in too many instances, but as a subordinate and responsible agent&#146;  (Humphreys, 162). It was a message that even his erstwhile sponsor Palmerston would find necessary to send. Tension between an agent on the periphery and statesmen in London was not uncommon in the mid-nineteenth century. What is noteworthy, however, was Chatfield's success in steering the metropole towards a more assertive policy. By the late 1840s he had coaxed London into several expansionist actions: the enlargement of the borders of British Honduras, the occupation of Ruatan Island, and the establishment of a protectorate on the Mosquito Coast (the likely eastern terminus of an isthmian canal). Chatfield's indispensability to the Foreign Office is revealed by its refusal to recall him, despite several requests to do so from Central American governments.<br>
<br>The final years of Chatfield's term as consul were marked by competition with the United States. The United States' annexation of Texas (1845) and conquest of northern Mexico (1846&#150;8) increased American interests in establishing an isthmian passageway in Central America. Chatfield and his American rival, Ephraim Squier, engaged in a diplomatic duel for regional supremacy. The two raced to secure favourable treaties with Central American states, and battled for hearts and minds in Central American newspapers. But Chatfield over-reached himself in October 1849 when he responded to Honduras's potential transfer of Tigre Island to the United States by pre-emptively seizing it for Britain as compensation for outstanding claims. The Foreign Office repudiated this action, thus signalling its willingness to compromise with the new whig administration in the United States. The result was the 1850 Clayton&#150;Bulwer treaty, in which both nations agreed to co-operate in the future construction of an isthmian canal and pledged not to &#145;occupy, or fortify, or colonize, or assume or exercise any dominion &hellip; [in] any part of Central America&#146;.<br>
<br>The Clayton&#150;Bulwer treaty marked the beginning of the end for Chatfield, who had no interest in co-operating with his American rivals in Central America. His continued advocacy of assertive and expansionist policies led Granville, the foreign secretary, to recall him in January 1852. The Foreign Office soon retreated from the positions that Chatfield had advocated in the Bay Islands, the Mosquito Coast, and the port of San Juan del Norte (or Greytown). It was the Americans, not the British, who became predominant in the region in the coming decades.<br>
<br>By the end of his time as consul Chatfield had become <i>persona non grata</i> in Central America. As one San Salvador newspaper put it, &#145;there is an evil, horrible and interminable, there is a living curse which corrodes the vitals of Central America&#151;and this is Chatfield, the eternal Agent of England&#146;  (Rodriguez, 316&#150;17). Central American politicians and commentators projected back this view of Chatfield, blaming him for the break-up of the union in the late 1830s. Squier continued the public relations campaign against his old adversary, publishing several books after Chatfield's departure that excoriated the English diplomat. So too did his reputation suffer in Britain. On his recall <span class="italic">The Economist</span> (7 Feb 1852) labelled Chatfield a &#145;fifth class diplomatist&#146;.<br>
<br>Chatfield, who was unmarried, retired to Brighton, where his generous benefactions to local institutions earned him the nickname the Brighton Peabody. He died at his home, 3 Belgrave Terrace, Brighton, Sussex, on 30 September 1872, and was buried in the extramural cemetery, Brighton.<br>
