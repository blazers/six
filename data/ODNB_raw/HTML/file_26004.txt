<span class="headword">Somerset <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Beaufort]</span>,  Charles</span>, first earl of Worcester  (<em>c.</em>1460&#150;1526), <span class="occ">courtier and magnate</span>, was the illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1860/', "Henry Beaufort, second duke of Somerset (1436&#150;1464)")</script>, and his mistress Joan Hill. His mother was still alive in 1493, when Henry VII gave her an annuity. He was thus a cousin both of King Henry and of his mother, Lady Margaret Beaufort, and subsequently acted as one of the latter's executors. His childhood was spent in exile, in Flanders and then in France, until in 1485 he returned to England with Henry Tudor, who knighted him at Milford Haven on 7 August 1485, barely a fortnight before the battle of Bosworth. At this time he bore the name Beaufort, but soon afterwards took that of Somerset, presumably to avoid blurring the royal claim to the Beaufort interest. The new king looked after his kinsman and companion in arms. On 1 March 1486 he made Somerset captain of the yeomen of the guard and shortly after appointed him royal cup-bearer. On St George's day 1496 Somerset was made a knight of the Garter. He was present at a meeting between Henry VII and Archduke Philip which took place outside Calais on 9 June 1500, and his close personal connection with the king secured his appointment in 1501 as vice-chamberlain of the household. In this capacity he took part in the ceremonies connected with the reception of Katherine of Aragon in October and November that year. In September 1503 he was made a knight of the body and by early 1505 he was a councillor.<br>
<br>Although he had no hereditary connections with Wales, Somerset established that country as the principal sphere of his political and economic influence when on 2 June 1492 he married Henry VII's ward Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1507), sole heir of William Herbert, earl of Huntingdon (<i>d</i>. 1490), the son of the king's childhood guardian, and Mary Woodville, the dowager queen's sister. Through his wife Somerset acquired a substantial part of the lordships of Gower, Kilvey, Crickhowell, Tretower, and Raglan. The main authority in Wales was the king's uncle, Jasper Tudor, duke of Bedford, the chief justice of south Wales; and on his death in December 1495 his lands in Wales reverted to the crown. However, Henry, duke of York (the future Henry VIII), was too young to administer Bedford's lands, and the marcher lordship of Glamorgan was leased to Somerset in March 1501. He was responsible for the implementation of justice in this marcher lordship, which operated as a separate judicial system until the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> in 1536. The king, however, had driven a hard bargain, and Somerset claimed in 1502 that the lease was not profitable without the grant of offices. Accordingly in September 1503 he was granted the lordship of Ewyas Lacy and a month later the stewardship of the lordship of Monmouth. Somerset's influence in the south marches was strengthened following the death of his wife's uncle Sir Walter Herbert in September 1507, when he acquired the lordships of Chepstow and Tudenham and the lease and lordship of the castle of Caldicot. The combination of lands, offices, and title made him the most powerful man in south Wales and the crown's principal agent for its government. This was ratified when he was created Baron Herbert in January 1504.<br>
<br>Henry VII had ensured that no one outside the royal family exerted the sort of authority in Wales exercised by Jasper Tudor. However, within little more than a year of his accession in 1509 Henry VIII had reversed his father's policy of making grants only during pleasure and greatly extended Herbert's influence in the marches. On 19 May 1509 he received the stewardship of the lordship of Ruthin and the constableship of Ruthin Castle, thus extending his authority into north Wales. Two days later he was made steward for life of the lordship of Monmouth and Grosmont and constable of Monmouth Castle, and on 29 May he became sheriff of Glamorgan. In May 1510 he received the reversion for life of the office of chief steward of the lordship of Abergavenny, and in June 1510 all offices previously granted to him (except the stewardship of Monmouth) were included in new grants to be held for life by Herbert and his heir.<br>
<br>Herbert was also closely involved in national politics and international diplomacy. One of Henry VII's closest advisers, he performed a variety of military and diplomatic offices. When the king attempted to mediate between Brittany and France early in his reign, a fleet was fitted out under the command of Somerset, who was made admiral on 20 February 1488 and given captaincy of a ship called <i>Le Soveraigne</i>. He was commissioned to go to sea on 9 October when Henry was contemplating supporting the late duke of Brittany's daughter Anne against the French king, Charles VIII. In September 1490 Somerset was sent to invest Emperor Maximilian with the Order of the Garter, and after Charles VIII died on 7 April 1498, he was dispatched to France to renew the treaty of Etaples with the new king, Louis XII. Four years later he undertook an embassy to Maximilian to secure the banishment of Yorkist rebels. Discussions in Antwerp resulted on 19 June 1502 in a general treaty of commerce and a promise by the emperor to keep the Yorkists under supervision in return for a payment of &pound;10,000. Somerset was also entrusted with the delicate negotiations arising from suggestions that Henry VII, widowed in 1503, might make a French marriage; and he was at Blois with Louis XII early in June 1505, when the French king gave him a full briefing on his views, including a proposal that Henry VII might marry his niece, Marguerite of Angoul&ecirc;me.<br>
<br>Baron Herbert remained an influential figure under Henry VIII, who on 30 May 1509 made him lord chamberlain, the nominal head of the entire royal household. He also took part in the expedition to France of 1513. The king's army comprised three divisions, and Herbert had charge of the middle division and was involved in the siege of Th&eacute;rouanne, captured on 23 August. On 1 February 1514 he was rewarded by being created earl of Worcester. In August following he accompanied the king's sister Mary to France for her marriage to Louis XII and also took part in negotiations aiming at the expulsion of Ferdinand of Aragon from Navarre. In 1515 he was chiefly occupied in seeing to the fortifications of Tournai, captured shortly after Th&eacute;rouanne. He was involved in unfruitful negotiations with Maximilian in 1516&#150;17. Worcester eventually had to inform Henry that Maximilian was insincere in his desire to maintain an alliance with England and advised his sovereign to send him no more money.<br>
<br>England and France were now drawing closer together and Worcester's finest moments came between 1518 and 1520 when he was put in charge of the negotiations for a truce between the two nations. In 1518 he negotiated the surrender of Tournai to the French in return for 600,000 crowns. In December that year he met King Fran&ccedil;ois I at St Denis and he subsequently acted as an intermediary between Wolsey and the French court in negotiations which culminated in the meeting of Henry and Fran&ccedil;ois at the Field of Cloth of Gold. This was largely organized by Worcester, who used the occasion to display his ceremonial and organizational skills. Having landed in Calais on 13 April 1520, he and his French counterpart agreed that the meeting should take place at Val d'Or (&#145;Golden Vale&#146;) between the English town of Gu&icirc;nes, where Henry VIII was based, and the French town of Ardres, where Fran&ccedil;ois was staying. Gu&icirc;nes Castle was deemed too small to entertain the king and queen of France in, and under Worcester's direction commissioners were appointed to construct a private gallery connected to a temporary palace, &#145;a honorable lodging&#146; erected by several thousand labourers and craftsmen  (Russell, 31). Five thousand people were shipped across the channel. Timber was floated down from the Netherlands and Kent and 4000 feet of glass was brought from St Omer. An Italian observer thought that even Leonardo da Vinci could not have improved upon it, and it was described as the eighth wonder of the world. The temporary palace, one of the lost treasures of the reign, is shown in a painting by an unknown artist at Hampton Court. After some argument the French accepted Worcester's proposed location for the feat of arms, on English soil about a mile from Gu&icirc;nes between two &#145;eminences&#146;, and the details were then left to him, though with the help of a &#145;platt&#146; by Henry himself. He organized the building of lists and galleries. The tilting yard had been designed by Henry VIII, but was constructed following Worcester's advice to put the lists closer to the viewing gallery. The jousts, which involved 300 contestants, took place on 11 and 22 June and the earl was one of the judges. In the following year he was present at the reception of Emperor Charles V, attesting the Anglo-imperial treaty of Windsor, on 20 June, while in 1525 he helped negotiate the treaty of the More between France and England.<br>
<br>Worcester died on 25 April 1526, probably at his preferred residence at Kew. He was buried in St George's Chapel, Windsor, doubtless in accordance with the arrangements he had dictated in his will. He there showed his love of ceremony by requesting that if he died near London, his body was to be taken down the Thames, covered by a black cloth with a white cross, for interment at Windsor next to his first wife. Elizabeth Herbert, the mother of the earl's son and heir, Henry, died on 27 August 1507, and by November 1511 he had married Eleanor, daughter of Edward Sutton, second Baron Dudley, who survived him. They had a son and a daughter. (Claims that Worcester married three times probably derive from an error by Dugdale.) The earl's wealth cannot be quantified, but an account of 1520 shows that his lands in the Welsh marches yielded about &pound;850 per annum. Raised largely by court service to an earldom, he was the ancestor through his eldest son of an important aristocratic dynasty, successively earls and marquesses of Worcester and dukes of Beaufort.<br>
