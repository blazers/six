<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Munster,  saints of</span>  (<em>act. </em><em>c.</em>450&#150;<em>c.</em>700), <span class="occ"></span>were holy figures whose cults centred on the medieval province of Munster (modern counties Clare, Limerick, Tipperary, Waterford, Cork, and Kerry), including Osraige (Ossory, modern co. Kilkenny). While having an overall provincial kingship, Munster was divided into several geographical-political regions. This is reflected in the cults of its saints.<br>
<br>The main dynastic power in Munster up to the end of the tenth century was that of the E&oacute;ganachta. The east of the province was dominated by E&oacute;ganacht Chaisil while the west formed the distinctive region of Iarmumu (west Munster) under the rival E&oacute;ganacht Locha L&eacute;in. With the rise of the D&aacute;l Cais (from east Clare) in the tenth century this was overshadowed by the division of a northern Tuadmumu (Thomond) from a southern Desmumu (Desmond). Such divisions were superimposed on older patterns. Munster was inhabited by many ancient and scattered population groupings. The profusion of peoples is reflected in a profusion of minor saints and churches. This was undoubtedly encouraged by the lack of strong central authority from the E&oacute;ganacht kings. The result is a bewildering confusion of separate traditions. Finally, the eastern boundaries of the province were controlled by the powerful and semi-autonomous kingdom of Osraige. This kingdom was alienated to the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill in the second half of the ninth century but subsequently gravitated towards the adjacent province of Leinster. Unsurprisingly, its saints look towards both Munster and Leinster. Saints were drawn into this world of shifting alliances long after their deaths. They generally flourished in the sixth and seventh centuries, but their cults continued to be elaborated throughout the middle ages. After the thirteenth century there is a lacuna in the sources and the modern use of ancient cult sites, in some cases, cannot be traced back beyond the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.<br>
<br>The most important of the widespread but disparate sources are hagiographical lives, either in Irish or Latin, or both, which are extant for many Munster saints. The Latin lives, in general, are found in the three great thirteenth- and fourteenth-century collections known as the <span class="roman">Codex Salmanticensis</span>, <span class="roman">Codex Insulensis</span>, and <span class="roman">Codex Kilkenniensis</span>. None of them is directly dependent on the others but they often used common sources, and some of the individual lives are significantly earlier than the date of their inclusion in the collections. Furthermore, it has been argued that a group of lives in the collections, mainly emanating from north Munster and adjacent kingdoms in Leinster and Mide (Meath), can be dated to the eighth century. Certainly, some of these lives betray convincing signs of an early origin. Several Irish language lives are preserved in later medieval manuscripts such as the fifteenth-century <span class="roman">Book of Lismore</span>. But many of the texts are known only because they were transcribed by the Franciscan M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh (Michael O'Clery) in the 1620s and 1630s. Fortunately, &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh was an accurate copyist. Nevertheless, many of the lives he transcribed date at the earliest from the thirteenth century. Even demonstrably later lives contain early strata, however.<br>
<br>Some saints are mentioned only in the martyrologies and their notes. These texts are calendars, which list saints, Irish and foreign, against their appropriate feast day&#151;that is, the traditional day of the saint's death. The most important of the martyrologies are the martyrology of Tallaght from the first half of the ninth century and <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span> from later in the same century. The latter was heavily annotated and the <i>scholia</i> (notes) dating from the ninth through to the twelfth century contain very important material. Another significant source is the martyrology of Gorman, composed between 1166 and 1174 by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20619/', "M&#225;el Muire Ua Gorm&#225;in (Marianus Gorman)")</script>. This martyrology is heavily dependent on the martyrology of Tallaght and helps to fill the gap in the latter between 1 November and 16 December. The most important later martyrology is the martyrology of Donegal, compiled by M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh about 1630. &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh's information is not to be dismissed lightly, since he had access to many early sources, some of which are no longer extant.<br>
<br>One of the most interesting early sources for the origins of several Munster cults is the text of the so-called west Munster synod, preserved among the Laud genealogies. It may have been written during the reign of the E&oacute;ganacht Locha L&eacute;in king, M&aacute;el D&uacute;in (<i>d</i>. 786), who is mentioned in the text, though it purports to describe events in the second half of the sixth century. It names several saints who attend a synod called by the king of Ciarraige Luachra (north Kerry). The text's enumeration of the regions where each saint wields jurisdiction is a useful pointer to the geographical distribution of the cults.<br>
<br>The difficulty with source material spills over into a difficulty regarding chronology. The chronology of this shadowy period, the age of saints, is not always certain, especially as this age was, in part, a retrospective construct. The hagiography is a monument to this work, in which saints of different centuries are brought into contact with each other in the name of contemporary monastic politics. In particular, this served to justify large monastic federations known as <i>paruchiae</i>. A saint could be associated with several churches but, in general, his burial place was at the leading church in the <i>paruchia</i>.<br>
<br>Most important saints are recorded in the monastic annals. While the annals of Ulster are contemporary from the second half of the sixth century, they have a distinct northern bias and are not always helpful for Munster saints. The first part of the Munster annals of Inisfallen was compiled about 1092, probably from documents emanating from the great monastery of Emly. Despite the relative lateness of compilation this set of annals does much to counter the northern emphasis of the annals of Ulster. Other important chronicles include <span class="italic">Chronicum Scotorum</span>, the annals of Tigernach, the annals of Clonmacnoise, and the annals of the four masters. The latter was compiled in the seventeenth century under the guidance of M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh. Like the martyrology of Donegal it contains early material, despite the late date of its compilation.<br>
<br>Finally, one of the identifying characteristics of Irish hagiography is the importance of genealogy. Through genealogy a saint was often linked with powerful dynasties. Indeed, Irish saints were rarely of non-aristocratic origin. The Irish genealogies were being compiled from the seventh century, and perhaps earlier. Changes in a saintly genealogy usually represent changes in patronage and the rise and fall of dynasties. There is often some confusion over the names of the mothers of the saints; most can be taken from the tract &#145;On the mothers of the saints&#146;, preserved in the twelfth-century <span class="roman">Book of Leinster</span> and later manuscripts.<h2>
<a name="TheprePatricianMunstersaints"></a>The pre-Patrician Munster saints</h2>Ireland was Christianized mainly in the fifth century. Many were involved but the cult of St Patrick swallowed up the work of others. The hagiography of the Munster saints Ailbe, the elder Ciar&aacute;n, D&eacute;cl&aacute;n, and Ibar, however, centres on the important trope of pre-Patrician Christianity. All four are imagined as bishops. According to traditions elaborated in Latin lives, these saints were themselves Christian before the coming of Patrick during the fifth century (the precise date of his arrival is uncertain) and preceded him in his missionary activity in Munster. The annals, on the other hand, place these saints as either contemporary with or later than Patrick. Furthermore, pre-Patrician claims did not significantly impinge on Munster politics: the primacy of the see founded by Patrick at Armagh was accepted in Munster by the seventh century.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_47462"></a><span class="headword">Ailbe <span class="st"> [Albeus]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 534?), a <span class="occ">bishop and church founder</span>, was the most significant of these saints. His feast day was celebrated on 12 September, according to the martyrology of Tallaght and <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span>. He was a member of the D&aacute;l Cairpri Arad, a relatively minor Munster people. Ailbe's most important church and burial site was Emly (Imlech Ibair), the chief church in Munster for several centuries. The abbot of Emly is mentioned as an authority on the paschal question in Cummian's seventh-century letter to S&eacute;g&eacute;ne, the abbot of Iona. Undoubtedly, Emly was bolstered by the support of the E&oacute;ganachta. The annals record abbots drawn from E&oacute;ganacht &Aacute;ine, E&oacute;ganacht Locha L&eacute;in, E&oacute;ganacht Airthir Chliach, and E&oacute;ganacht Chaisil.<br>
<br>The hagiographical material associated with Ailbe is quite extensive. The Latin life in <span class="roman">Codex Salmanticensis</span> is the earliest recension, the other lives derivative. The Irish life is an abbreviated version of the Latin original. The <span class="roman">Salmanticensis</span> life seems to be the innovator in regard to Ailbe's pre-Patrician status and his independence from Patrick, something downplayed in the other two recensions and directly contradicted by the date of his death given in the annals of Ulster. It has been argued that the original life was a relatively early production, perhaps as early as the eighth century; one commentator has suggested that it was composed about the time of the first promulgation of the Law of Ailbe in 784. This life consciously models Ailbe on Patrick, whom he at times surpasses. The picture is rather different from T&iacute;rech&aacute;n's seventh-century <span class="italic">Collectanea</span>, in which Patrick ordains Ailbe. In Ailbe's life the founder of Emly is consecrated a bishop in Rome, is visited by Patrick's angel, Victor, and is acknowledged by the bishops D&eacute;cl&aacute;n and Ibar. Patrick himself, contrary to most versions of his legend, especially that in the early tenth-century <span class="italic">Vita tripartita</span>, leaves the Munster king, &Oacute;engus mac Nad Fra&iacute;ch, in Ailbe's care. Emly's ambitions are fairly clear. Although the pre-Patrician motif is dominant, the saint is also associated with other traditions. Ailbe's father is named Olch&uacute; (or Olc&aacute;n, or Olcnais; literally &#145;great hound&#146;), his mother Sant or Sanclit. Ailbe, the son of the &#145;great hound&#146; is abandoned as the offspring of illicit sex and raised by wolves, much like Romulus and Remus. In the later stratum of the Irish life of Mac Creiche, Ailbe is referred to as the warhound of &#145;Sl&iacute;ab Crot&#146; (Slieve Grud, co. Tipperary). Ailbe is also mentioned in the context of an other-world voyage in a late eighth-century litany of pilgrim saints. It has been suggested that this was written at Lismore and is good evidence for the widespread nature of Ailbe's cult. Moreover, Ailbe's community, enjoying everlasting life on an other-world island, is encountered in the late eighth-century <span class="italic">Navigatio sancti Brendani</span>.<br>
<br>Emly itself maintained its importance right through the early middle ages. It was a literary centre and produced, for example, the late ninth-century <span class="italic">Riagol Ailbi Imlecha</span>, a monastic rule, authored retrospectively on Ailbe. The text of the west Munster synod suggests that the abbot of Emly has authority over all of Munster. Another sign of Emly's influence is the number of its abbots recorded in the annals. Flann mac Fairchellaig (<i>d</i>. 825?) was undoubtedly the most famous. He was also abbot of Cork and Lismore. The church suffered an eclipse following the tenth- and eleventh-century rise of the D&aacute;l Cais. Marc&aacute;n (<i>d</i>. 1010), Brian B&oacute;ruma's brother, became abbot of Emly and several other churches. The creation of a church at nearby Cashel was a further blow, but Emly recovered sufficiently in the twelfth century to become an episcopal see.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_5414"></a><span class="headword">Ciar&aacute;n mac Luaigne</span> <span class="st"> [Kyaranus; Piran]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>450&#150;500), <span class="occ">bishop and patron of Ossory</span>, was also imagined as flourishing in the sixth century. His main foundation was the great monastic church of Saigir (Seir Kieran). He is commemorated on 5 March in <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span> and he is often referred to as &#145;sen&#146;, old, Ciar&aacute;n to differentiate him from his namesake, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5413/', "Ciar&#225;n of Clonmacnoise")</script>, the founder of Clonmacnoise [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51010/', "Meath, saints of")</script>]. The hagiographical tradition devoted to Ciar&aacute;n is complex. There are two Latin and two Irish lives. The fuller of the Latin texts is that preserved in <span class="roman">Codex Kilkenniensis</span>, in comparison with which the life in the Salamanca collection is abbreviated. Both are difficult to date. Of the Irish lives, one is a translation of the longer of the Latin lives, while the second Irish life, as it stands, is a post-Reformation production. Nevertheless, the latter contains the oldest materials, particularly in its pro-Munster treatment of Osraige politics. In these lives Ciar&aacute;n is portrayed as a wild man, dressed in skins. His first monks are forest animals. Otherwise, his pre-Patrician career follows that of Ailbe. Unlike the latter, however, Ciar&aacute;n is always subordinate to Patrick, whom he first meets in Italy. Indeed, his lives make little mention of Ailbe, D&eacute;cl&aacute;n, and Ibar. They are more interested in extending the rights of Saigir.<br>
<br>Yet, there is an even older stratum to Ciar&aacute;n's cult which hints at pre-seventh-century conditions. The genealogies and martyrologies point to an ancient tradition in which his father Lugna was of the Osraige while his mother Liad&aacute;n was from the Corco Lo&iacute;gde. The latter claimed to be the first people in Ireland to receive Christianity. Despite his paternity he is raised among the Corco Lo&iacute;gde, a possible sign of his original affiliation. Furthermore, there is strong evidence for Corco Lo&iacute;gde suzerainty over Osraige in the early historic period. Indeed, Ciar&aacute;n's life brings the saint and Conchraid mac Duach, one of the Corco Lo&iacute;gde kings of Osraige, together as allies. Another old tradition, contained in the late eighth-century litany of pilgrim saints, is that Ciar&aacute;n went on a voyage to the other world. Whatever the saint's guise, however, his hagiographers do not hide the wealth and importance of Saigir. It was the burial place of the Osraige kings. The church ruins still contain some early grave slabs and the base of a high cross. Ciar&aacute;n has been mistakenly identified with the Cornish saint <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22310/', "Piran")</script>.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_7409"></a><span class="headword">D&eacute;cl&aacute;n mac Eircc</span> <span class="st"> [Declanus]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>late 5th cent.) was the founder of the important monastery of Ardmore (Ard M&oacute;r) and patron of the D&eacute;si (modern co. Waterford). The monastery, where the saint died and was buried, was situated on the south-east coast in the kingdom of D&eacute;si Muman. D&eacute;cl&aacute;n is commemorated on 24 July in the martyrologies. The founder saint and bishop was a member of the D&eacute;si royal dynasty through his father, Ercc (Ercbran). His mother, Dethiden, is not given a genealogical affiliation. The close links between church and aristocracy indicated by the position of the saint's father are highlighted by the hagiographers. The main source for D&eacute;cl&aacute;n's life and cult is a roughly twelfth-century Latin life preserved only in <span class="roman">Codex Kilkenniensis</span>, but possibly containing earlier materials. The Irish life, transcribed by &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh, is dependent on the Latin. The earlier text is very much influenced by the Salamanca life of Ailbe. It describes D&eacute;cl&aacute;n's journey to Rome, where he makes the acquaintance of Ailbe. Later, on his way back to Ireland, he meets Patrick. Throughout, D&eacute;cl&aacute;n is shown as subordinate to these two saints. It is Patrick who tells him where to settle. D&eacute;cl&aacute;n eventually converts the D&eacute;si with Patrick's blessing. Much of the stress in the life on D&eacute;cl&aacute;n's episcopal status fits the twelfth-century period of church reform, during which Ireland was re-organized into a full diocesan system. In the event, Ardmore ultimately failed to win the status of an episcopal see, which was given to Lismore. An impressive round tower marks the site of the medieval monastery.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_14352"></a><span class="headword">Ibar mac Lugna</span> <span class="st"> [Ibhar, Ybarus]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 500/01), <span class="occ">bishop</span>, is the most shadowy of the four Munster pre-Patrician saints. His feast day is placed on 23 April in the martyrologies and he is reputed to have died in 500 or 501. He is remembered as the founder of a monastery at Beggerin Island (Becc &Eacute;riu, Inis F&aacute;il) in Wexford harbour, which survived despite being plundered by the vikings in 813; in 1182 it was granted to St Nicholas's Monastery in Exeter. Ibar makes many appearances in the lives of other saints, particularly in the lives of D&eacute;cl&aacute;n and Ailbe, the late seventh-century life of Mo Ninne (Dar Erca, Monenna) and the roughly thirteenth-century Latin life of Abb&aacute;n. A brief text, concerning Ibar, in the twelfth-century <span class="roman">Book of Leinster</span> adds little. In the life of Ailbe, Ibar acknowledges Ailbe's precedence, a prudent claim since Emly was called Imlech Ibair (&#145;Emly of Ibar&#146;), suggesting the primacy of Ibar. In the life of D&eacute;cl&aacute;n, Ibar is a companion of the other pre-Patrician bishops.<br>
<br>While these lives give Ibar indelibly Munster associations, he was also a national figure. He is portrayed as the adviser of the Ulster saint Mo Ninne and the maternal uncle of the Leinster saint Abb&aacute;n moccu Corbmaic. According to the genealogies of the Lo&iacute;gse, Ibar baptized the sons of their early historic king, Barr. Ibar's father, Lugna, was of the Ulster U&iacute; Echach Ulad (from modern co. Down), while his mother, named Bassar in &#145;On the mothers of the saints&#146;, was a member of the D&eacute;si Breg in the midlands. According to this text, Bassar was the mother of four saints including Ibar, a common but significant genealogical fiction. Clearly, Ibar was an important saint, the records of whose deeds may have been lost. Among these may have been a voyage text, for Ibar's quest is mentioned in the litany of pilgrim saints.<h2>
<a name="ThetraditionsofwestandnorthwestMunster"></a>The traditions of west and north-west Munster</h2>Geographically and politically Iarmumu formed a discrete region within the province. Its kings were the E&oacute;ganacht Locha L&eacute;in, whose power-base was centred around modern Killarney. While the hagiographers implicitly recognized the separate entity of Iarmumu, they were explicitly concerned with linking west Munster both with the rest of the province and with Connacht to the north. Furthermore, the E&oacute;ganacht Locha L&eacute;in had influence over the old kingdoms of Corco Duibne (Dingle peninsula) and Ciarraige Luachra. The latter, in particular, valued its independence, both from the nearby, and therefore more threatening, power of Iarmumu and from E&oacute;ganacht Chaisil. The text of the west Munster synod, which emanates from Ciarraige and may have been composed at Ardfert, details the relationship between the Ciarraige and E&oacute;ganacht. These details are mediated through saints.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_4336"></a><span class="headword">Caim&iacute;n <span class="st"> [Caimm&iacute;ne, Mo Chamm&oacute;c]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 644?), <span class="occ">one of the claimed founders of the monastery of Inis Celtra (Holy Island)</span> on Lough Derg, is commemorated in the martyrologies on 25 March. The saints' genealogies are unsure of the identity of his father, who is named both Colm&aacute;n and D&iacute;mmae. His maternal genealogy is more important, however. Under the year 662 in the annals of the four masters, Caim&iacute;n is described as the uterine brother of Guaire Aidne (<i>d</i>. 633), an U&iacute; Fhiachrach king of Connacht, and a central figure in a series of tales from the region. The kingdom of U&iacute; Fhiachrach Aidne (south-west Galway) bordered on Munster. Moreover, Guaire was linked through blood and friendship with a number of west Munster figures, so much so that one critic has detected the remains of a literary cycle surrounding Guaire, which described political events in the seventh and eighth centuries and was written no later than the ninth. Caim&iacute;n's cult suffered through possible confusion with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50100/', "Cumm&#233;ne Fota (d. 662)")</script>, abbot of Clonfert [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51012/', "Connacht, saints of")</script>], and through the dominance of Colum mac Crimthainn, the patron of Inis Celtra. One unpublished Irish metrical life celebrates the saint. His main claim to prominence, however, was his conflict with Guaire Aidne in the eleventh-century saga <span class="italic">Cath Cairn Chonaill</span>. In the battle of Carn Conaill (649), Diarmait, son of &Aacute;ed Sl&aacute;ine, joint king of Tara with his brother Bl&aacute;thmac, defeated Guaire. In the saga account, however, Guaire's defeat is the direct result of Caim&iacute;n's curse, for the king had outraged the saint. Guaire is saved through repentance, and reconciliation with the church. The church of Inis Celtra itself flourished despite viking incursions up the Shannon. It formed part of the <i>paruchia</i> of Terryglass. Impressive remains, including earthworks from the early monastic settlement, several churches, a round tower, and two high crosses, can still be seen on Holy Island.<br>
<br>Guaire is also associated with Cumm&eacute;ne Fota and the latter's frequent companion, the D&eacute;si holy fool and saint, <a name="cosubject_64399"></a><span class="headword">Comg&aacute;n mac D&aacute; Cherda</span> <span class="st"> [Mac na Cerda, Comg&aacute;n moccu Cerda]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 645)<span class="occ"></span>. While Mac D&aacute; Cherda is very much a figure of saga, he has been tentatively identified with Comg&aacute;n, the abbot of Emly, mentioned in the west Munster synod. Mac D&aacute; Cherda, through his mother R&iacute;m, was supposedly the brother of both Guaire and Cumm&eacute;ne. Although he is generally affiliated to a minor branch of the D&eacute;si, the U&iacute; Rossa, one Irish anecdote transfers him to the main branch of the D&eacute;si and relates that, having been struck with madness by God, he found holiness through his friendship with Cumm&eacute;ne. In another anecdote, relations between Guaire, Cumm&eacute;ne, and Mac D&aacute; Cherda help to link Clonfert and Ardfert, the two principal churches of the <i>familia</i> of St Brendan of Clonfert.<br>
<br>Cult dedications are particularly rich in Corco Duibne. One of the most impressive churches on the Dingle peninsula is Kilmalkedar (Cell M&aacute;ele C&eacute;tair). The church is Romanesque and an ogham stone, alphabet stone, and early cross-pillar are among the remains still <i>in situ</i>. The church is dedicated to <a name="cosubject_64400"></a><span class="headword">M&aacute;el C&eacute;tair mac R&oacute;n&aacute;in</span>  (<em>fl. </em>6th&#150;7th cent.?). Unfortunately, there is very little extant information about this saint. He is not recorded in the annals and his floruit can only be a guess. His name literally means &#145;the servant of the cedar&#146;, in other words the servant of the cross, which indicates a cult of the cross at Kilmalkedar. Otherwise, the only substantial information concerning M&aacute;el C&eacute;tair is contained in the late twelfth-century martyrology of Gorman, which gives his feast day as 14 May; later notes appended to it state that M&aacute;el C&eacute;tair was descended from the royal family of the Ulaid. Kilmalkedar's significance, however, was local to Corco Duibne, for the church does not make an appearance in the annals of monastic rivalry.<br>
<br>The Clare coast north of the Shannon estuary was dominated by two ancient Munster peoples: the Corco Baiscinn and the more northerly Corco Mruad. From the tenth century they were subsumed into the &Oacute; Briain region of Tuadmumu. One of the major saints of Corco Mruad was <a name="cosubject_64401"></a><span class="headword">Mac Creiche <span class="st"> [Mac Cride]</span> mac Pessl&aacute;in</span>  (<em>fl. </em>late 6th cent.)<span class="occ"></span> of Kilmacreehy (Cell Mac Creiche) and Killoran (Cell M&aacute;ele Odrain). His feast day was celebrated on 11 August according to the martyrology of Donegal. In recent times, however, it has been celebrated on the first Sunday of August, known as Garland Sunday (Domnach Chrom Dubh), particularly around the west Clare town of Liscannor. Mac Creiche's Irish life was transcribed by M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh from a copy made by Melaghlin O'Callanan, the <i>coarb</i> of the saint, at Killoran in 1528. Contrary to the opinions of earlier scholars, it has been shown to contain valuable information and two historical strata. The earlier refers to west Munster events in the seventh century and may well have been written towards the end of that century or in the eighth. Here, Mac Creiche is affiliated through his father, Pessl&aacute;n, to the Corco Mruad, and through his mother to the Ciarraige. The saint shows particular attachment to his maternal kindred, being referred to as their <i>garmac</i> or dutiful son. Furthermore, he gains the confidence and support of two E&oacute;ganacht Locha L&eacute;in kings, Crimthainn and his son, the important &Aacute;ed Benn&aacute;n (<i>d</i>. 619). Unlike other tales emanating from Iarmumu in this period, the text shows considerable hostility towards Connacht. Mac Creiche is opposed to Connacht before finally winning the submission of the early U&iacute; Bri&uacute;in king, &Aacute;ed mac Echach (<i>d</i>. 577). Throughout the life, Mac Creiche, as bishop, acknowledges the superior status of Ailbe as archbishop of Munster. This is consistent with the portrayal of Mac Creiche as Ailbe's foster child in the eighth-century life of the latter saint. The second section of Mac Creiche's life may date from the early tenth century, and makes Ailbe the father of Mac Creiche. Mac Creiche is identified as a saint of Cen&eacute;l Fermaic, a more minor people who lived near Corco Mruad. Undoubtedly, this reflects a local aspect of his cult. This section of the composite life does not know of the saint's maternal genealogy. He gains the submission of Ciarraige Luachra through St Brendan, rather than through his mother's kindred.<br>
<br>Mac Creiche is a saint of widespread attachments but no major monastery. In the notes of the martyrology of Donegal he is tutored by Mochta of Lugbad (Louth). According to the eighth- or ninth-century Latin life of Colum mac Crimthainn, Mac Creiche was the original incumbent of Inis Celtra, which at the request of an angel he handed over to Colum. His cult stretched from Corco Mruad to Araid T&iacute;re and M&uacute;scraige T&iacute;re. He survived as a saint on a popular, as opposed to a monastic, level.<br>
<br>The greatest saint of Corco Baiscinn was <a name="cosubject_25082"></a><span class="headword">Sen&aacute;n mac Geirrcinn</span> <span class="st"> [Mo Shen&oacute;c, Senanus]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>6th cent.)<span class="occ"></span> of Inis Cathaig (Scattery Island, Iniscathy). In hagiography he is often linked with the sixth-century patron of Wales, David. So in <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span> his feast day, like David's, is on 1 March. The Welsh link may reflect ancient connections between Munster and Wales, particularly Dyfed. Sen&aacute;n's most famous hagiographical deed was his defeat of the mythical river monster, called the Cathach, who gave his name to Inis Cathaig. The event is commemorated on 8 March in <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span> and is celebrated in detail in his tenth- or eleventh-century Irish life preserved in the <span class="roman">Book of Lismore</span>. There is also a metrical Latin life of the saint, but it is much later, and hardly predates the thirteenth century. In the earlier <span class="italic">Vita tripartita</span>, Patrick foretells Sen&aacute;n's sanctity. According to the Irish life he was the son of Gerrcenn who, unusually in terms of Irish convention, was a Corco Baiscinn peasant rather than a nobleman. His mother is named Co&iacute;mgell. According to his life, Sen&aacute;n became a monk with the Osraige saint, Notail. Eventually, he defeated the Cathach to found a monastery on Scattery. The island had never before been inhabited and so, according to the hagiographers, was free of the stain of original sin.<br>
<br>Inis Cathaig was a wealthy and successful monastery. Sen&aacute;n was the patron of both Corco Baiscinn and the powerful U&iacute; Fhidgeinte (modern co. Limerick). Much of his life concerns itself with relations with the latter. The monastery reached its height before the tenth century. One of its abbots, the U&iacute; Fhidgeinte &Oacute;lchobur mac Flainn (<i>d</i>. 796), became king of Munster. Moreover, it has been argued that the Old Irish poem praising Sen&aacute;n, <span class="italic">Amra Sen&aacute;in</span>, was composed towards the end of the ninth century by the bishop-king of Munster, Cormac mac Cuillenn&aacute;in (<i>d</i>. 908). Despite a decline, owing as much to the rise of D&aacute;l Cais as to viking depredations, the monastery remained important within the Shannon region. It was recognized as an episcopal see, representing Corco Baiscinn and U&iacute; Fhidgeinte, at the Synod of Kells-Mellifont in 1152. This status was short-lived but Inis Cathaig retained rights over churches on both banks of the Shannon estuary. A fourteenth-century text, <span class="italic">Morbuile Sen&aacute;in</span>, provides a valuable and rare insight into the development of a cult during this era. The text is a list of Sen&aacute;n's miraculous interventions in contemporary affairs. As might be expected during this period, the &Oacute; Briain lords of Thomond are prominent beneficiaries of the saint. Moreover, the text lists several churches in Clare owing allegiance to Inis Cathaig. A poem, following the prose account, brings Sen&aacute;n into contact with most major Irish saints. The medieval remains on Scattery Island are impressive, including the highest round tower in Ireland. The cult of Sen&aacute;n outlived Inis Cathaig, and is still of considerable importance in co. Clare.<br>
<br>Inis Cathaig was also a famous burial-ground. Sen&aacute;n was not the only saint supposedly buried there. Another was <a name="cosubject_4553"></a><span class="headword">Canir <span class="st"> [Cannera]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em>6th cent.)<span class="occ"></span>. She was a saint of the Benntraige in the south of Munster, and is known mainly through an episode which occurs towards the end of the Irish life of Sen&aacute;n but was probably originally independent. Canir, it is said, journeyed to Inis Cathaig, where she wished to die and be buried. Sen&aacute;n at first refused to allow this because she was a woman. Eventually, he relented, moved by Canir's stubbornness, rather than by her impassioned plea for equality.<br>
<br>The most westerly of the great Munster monastic sites was the church and burial site of <a name="cosubject_8801"></a><span class="headword">&Eacute;nda mac Conaill</span> <span class="st"> [Endeus]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>6th cent.?)<span class="occ"></span> on Inismore (Inis M&oacute;r), the largest of the Aran Islands. These islands in Galway Bay were ruled by the E&oacute;ganacht Ninussa, a minor branch of the great Munster dynastic federation. The islands contain a large number of neolithic and early Christian sites. Many of the latter are associated with &Eacute;nda, particularly Killeany (Cill &Eacute;inne), the site of the ancient monastery. &Eacute;nda is commemorated on 21 March in the martyrologies. He is not mentioned in the annals but probably flourished in the sixth century. Most sources make him the son of Conall mac Daim&iacute;ne (<i>d</i>. 609), a member of a royal dynasty of Airgialla (of mid-Ulster), and Aebfind, the daughter of Ainmire, king of Fir Arda Ciannachta (modern co. Louth). Yet, according to the Latin life of the saint, which is twelfth- or thirteenth-century in its present form but contains far earlier material, the Aran Islands were granted to &Eacute;nda by the fifth-century Munster king &Oacute;engus mac Nad Fra&iacute;ch, despite the fact that the saint flourished a century later than the legendary king. One of the earliest references to &Eacute;nda is contained in the <span class="italic">Navigatio sancti Brendani</span>. In the text Brendan visits &Eacute;nda and receives his blessing before embarking on his voyage. In his life &Eacute;nda is celebrated as the teacher of Brendan, or Columba (Colum Cille) and of Ciar&aacute;n of Clonmacnoise, with whom he made a pact, signalling good relations between Aran and Clonmacnoise.<br>
<br>In Irish tradition &Eacute;nda is known as an <i>athl&aacute;ech</i>, a former layman. His life claims that he was converted from warfare to religious life through his saintly sister F&aacute;enche. According to the Middle Irish notes to <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span>, another of his sisters, Ca&iacute;rech, founded the church of Cluain Bairenn (Clonburren) in U&iacute; Maine (south-east Galway). &Eacute;nda's religious education is not completely entrusted to a woman, however. His life also brings him into contact with a teacher of saints, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18952/', "Mo Nennus (Maucennus, Mugint, Mo-Nennius)")</script>, at &#145;Rosnat&#146;, a British monastery identified, often though uncertainly, with Whithorn.<br>
<br>&Eacute;nda's successor at Aran, and companion in the life, was Pupu (Pupeus, Pubeus). According to the notes in <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span> and a poem in the genealogies of the saints, Pupu was identical with Nem moccu Birn (<i>d</i>. 655), a supposed brother of Ciar&aacute;n of Saigir, commemorated in Tallaght on 14 June. His name may preserve the memory that Aran had been under Corco Lo&iacute;gde control at some early stage, as had Osraige, Ciar&aacute;n's land.<br>
<br>The monastic settlement suffered a decline. The exposed position of the Aran Islands on the Atlantic made them and their religious communities an easy prey for vikings. During post-Norman times they were caught between the rival U&iacute; Briain and U&iacute; Flaithbertaig, and Aran's monasteries and churches fell into ruin.<h2>
<a name="ThesaintsofUFhidgeinteandDlCais"></a>The saints of U&iacute; Fhidgeinte and D&aacute;l Cais</h2>Mid-Munster was dominated by the U&iacute; Fhidgeinte in present-day co. Limerick, the E&oacute;ganacht &Aacute;ine, E&oacute;ganacht Airthir Chliach, and E&oacute;ganacht Chaisil. E&oacute;ganacht traditions tended to be centred on the pre-Patrician saint Ailbe. The U&iacute; Fhidgeinte, however, also claimed to be E&oacute;ganacht, although their artificial grafting onto the main E&oacute;ganacht stem is an obvious enough fiction. The U&iacute; Fhidgeinte were broken into two major branches, the U&iacute; Chonaill Gabra in west Limerick and the U&iacute; Chairpri in east Limerick. To the north of U&iacute; Fhidgeinte, Tuadmumu was subject to the rising power of D&aacute;l Cais. Close neighbours, the U&iacute; Fhidgeinte were the more powerful of the two until the dramatic surge in D&aacute;l Cais power towards the end of the tenth century.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_14495"></a><span class="headword">&Iacute;te ingen Chinn Fhalad</span> <span class="st"> [M' &Iacute;te; Deirdre; Ita]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 570/77)<span class="occ"></span> of Killeedy (Cluain Credail, Cell &Iacute;te) was far and away the most important of the U&iacute; Fhidgeinte saints. She is commemorated on 15 January in <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span>, where she is called &#145;grian b&aacute;n ban Muman&#146;, &#145;the white sun of Munster's women&#146;; the annals of Ulster record her death in either 570 or 577. She was regarded as the patron of Munster and had an unusually high standing for a female saint. This is reflected in her hagiographical dossier which includes two major revisions of a probably eleventh-century Latin life that is no longer extant. The notes of <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span> preserve a late ninth-century Old Irish poem, <span class="italic">&Iacute;suc&aacute;n</span>, put into her mouth. According to the genealogies and the life preserved in <span class="roman">Codex Kilkenniensis</span>, &Iacute;te was a member of the D&eacute;si. Her father is named Cenn F&aacute;elad in the genealogies of the saints. The life follows the example of Brigit in describing the opposition &Iacute;te meets in pursuit of her vocation. It is no surprise when the hagiographer explicitly calls &Iacute;te a second Brigit. The genealogies of the saints even make &Iacute;te's mother, Necht, a daughter of Dallbr&oacute;nach, and thus a sister of Brigit's mother. Her life says that &Iacute;te eventually founded the church of Killeedy in U&iacute; Fhidgeinte, where she was buried, with the co-operation of the royal family of the U&iacute; Chonaill Gabra.<br>
<br>Despite this apparently straightforward link between saint and dynasty, there is strong evidence that &Iacute;te was originally the patron of the Corco &Oacute;che, the weaker neighbours of the U&iacute; Chonaill. Killeedy was situated at the foot of Sl&iacute;ab Luachra, which formed the natural southern boundary of U&iacute; Chonaill, an area inhabited by the Corco &Oacute;che. The annals of Ulster under the year 552 record the battle of Cuilen won by the U&iacute; Chonaill Gabra over the Corco &Oacute;che through the prayers of &Iacute;te. Yet, in a probably eighth-century account of a battle (probably the same although it is called the battle of M&eacute;inde) the Corco &Oacute;che are the victors over the U&iacute; Chonaill, through the intercession of &Iacute;te. The difference between the two accounts represents the displacement of the Corco &Oacute;che by the U&iacute; Chonaill, and the latter's absorption of the saint's cult. This is completed in the life's version of the battle, in which the U&iacute; Chonaill are the foster people of &Iacute;te and she their fosterer. Her support for them in battle, at this stage represented as a struggle against the hosts of Iarmumu, is an extension of this role. &Iacute;te's status as foster mother gained her national recognition. She was imagined as the fosterer of the saints Brendan, Cumm&eacute;ne Fota, and Mo Ch&oacute;em&oacute;c. Her maternal characteristics are best celebrated in the Old Irish poem <span class="italic">&Iacute;suc&aacute;n</span>. The image of &Iacute;te, suckling the infant Jesus, fits in particularly well with the personality ascribed to her by the hagiographers.<br>
<br>One of the odder aspects of &Iacute;te's cult is that while she founded a religious house for women, it seems to have passed at a fairly early date into male hands. Several of the abbots are recorded in the annals of the four masters. &Iacute;te may have been a second Brigit, but the women of her church did not emulate the success of the abbesses of Kildare. The monastery flourished, but was plundered several times by the vikings. It went into decline following the heavy Norman settlement of Limerick. A Romanesque church can still be seen on the site of the medieval monastery.<br>
<br>The church of <a name="cosubject_64404"></a><span class="headword">Mainch&iacute;n mac Setnai</span>  (<em>fl. </em>late 6th cent.)<span class="occ"></span> of Luimnech (at the head of the Shannon estuary, later Limerick) was caught up in the rivalries of D&aacute;l Cais, U&iacute; Fhidgeinte and vikings. There are several saints of this name, but the most likely candidate is mentioned in the martyrology of Donegal on 29 December. This Mainch&iacute;n is attached to the genealogical stem of the D&aacute;l Cais through his father, S&eacute;tna, and seems to be identical with the Mainch&iacute;n who appears as Mac Creiche's disciple in the life of that saint. The church was subsumed in the growth of the viking city of Limerick in the tenth century, Mainch&iacute;n becoming the patron of the city. The saint is also associated with Bruree (Brug R&iacute;g) further south, where his feast is celebrated on 2 January, perhaps through confusion with St Manch&eacute;ne, commemorated on that day in <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span>. Both Bruree and Luimnech were, from early times, contested by D&aacute;l Cais and U&iacute; Fhidgeinte. Mainch&iacute;n's cult as a D&aacute;l Cais saint reflects this.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_64406"></a><span class="headword">Ness&aacute;n <span class="st"> [Mo Ness&oacute;c]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 556), the <span class="occ">deacon and founder of Mungret (Mungairit)</span>, was one of the most important of the U&iacute; Fhidgeinte saints. His feast day is 25 July in <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span>. Mungret, situated not far from present-day Limerick, was wealthy and powerful. Several of its abbots are recorded in the annals. Cummian's seventh-century letter to S&eacute;g&eacute;ne refers to Ness&aacute;n as a father of the Irish church, and to his successor, the abbot of Mungret, as an authority of note. Furthermore, the saint is given jurisdiction over Corco Duibne in the West Munster synod. This reflects a genealogical link with Corco Duibne and, perhaps, the extent of Mungret's influence. Moreover, the saint's cult is well attested in the early tenth-century <span class="italic">Vita tripartita</span>. Here, Ness&aacute;n shows Patrick the respect he deserves, even though Patrick has been insulted by the U&iacute; Fhidgeinte king, Lonn. Ness&aacute;n is rewarded with a religious vocation and founds Mungret, where he is eventually buried. Considering the importance of Mungret, it is disappointing to find no extant life of the founder saint. Ness&aacute;n does make stray appearances in the lives of other saints, notably in that of the E&oacute;ganacht patron, Ailbe, but the strength of the saint's cult is best attested by the wealth of Mungret. The monastery survived the raiding of the Norse and the close proximity of their city, Limerick. In the twelfth century it adopted the rules of the canons regular and claimed episcopal status at the Synod of Kells-Mellifont in 1152. Although its claims were derailed by the powerful see of Limerick, Mungret continued to flourish. Several buildings dating from the twelfth to the fifteenth century can still be seen on the site.<br>
<br>The heyday of U&iacute; Fhidgeinte passed with the tenth century, when their D&aacute;l Cais neighbours rose to be the dominant power in Munster. The D&aacute;l Cais leader Brian B&oacute;ruma became king not only of the province, but of the country. The chief church of D&aacute;l Cais was Killaloe (Cell D&aacute; Lua). Little is known of its founder Mo Lua (Da Lua); there is an isolated anecdote in the eighth-century life of Cainnech. More important was <a name="cosubject_9673"></a><span class="headword">Flann&aacute;n mac Toirrdelbaig</span> <span class="st"> [Flannanus]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>7th cent.), <span class="occ">Killaloe's patron</span>, whose cult was largely the creation of the &Oacute; Briain kings, descendants of Brian B&oacute;ruma. Flann&aacute;n was not prominent enough to be mentioned in the early martyrologies and his feast day, 18 December, is recorded only in the martyrology of Donegal. His father, the king Toirrdelbach, was the ancestor of the &Oacute; Briain rulers, the main branch of the D&aacute;l Cais royal dynasty. The development of Flann&aacute;n's cult took place during the eleventh and twelfth centuries. The large hagiographical dossier built up on him at this time is the last example of the conscious cult building which had dominated Irish religious life since the seventh century. The twelfth-century Latin life of Flann&aacute;n, of which there are two main recensions, was probably composed between 1163 and 1167 in Killaloe by an Irish cleric who was trained on the continent. He also seems to have been the author of the Latin life of Mo Chuille (Mochulleus) whose church of Tulla lay not far from Killaloe.<br>
<br>Killaloe rose at the expense of the rival E&oacute;ganacht monastery of Emly. That monastery and Ailbe, its patron, are denigrated in the life of Flann&aacute;n. Ailbe is described as a demon rather than a saint. Killaloe was dominated by members of the D&aacute;l Cais royal dynasty. The first abbot to be mentioned in the annals, Scandl&aacute;n mac Taidc (<i>d</i>. 991), was succeeded by Brian B&oacute;ruma's brother, Marc&aacute;n. The latter took over the abbacy at Inis Celtra, Emly, and Terryglass, a clear sign of &Oacute; Briain ambitions. Killaloe became the see of the &Oacute; Briain diocese of the same name in the twelfth century. Flann&aacute;n is an instructive example of the type of political motivations that could underlie a saint's cult, motivations which are often obscure in the earlier and more fragmentary material.<h2>
<a name="SouthMunster"></a>South Munster</h2>The south coast of Munster was dominated by the Corco Lo&iacute;gde (west Cork), E&oacute;ganacht Raithlind (south Cork), U&iacute; Liath&aacute;in (east Cork), and D&eacute;si Muman. The Corco Lo&iacute;gde were among the most ancient inhabitants of the province, and seem to have preserved some of the oldest hagiographical traditions. Coastal trade was important in the region. This was extended by the growth of viking Cork as the most significant maritime focus in south Munster. The lands of M&uacute;scraige Mittine (mid-Cork) and Fir Maige F&eacute;ne (mid-Cork, around Fermoy) lay further inland. The M&uacute;scraige seem to have originated as allies of the E&oacute;ganacht in early historic times. Fir Maige F&eacute;ne, on the contrary, had many anti-E&oacute;ganacht associations.<br>
<br>The Corco Lo&iacute;gde successfully maintained an honoured status <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> their powerful E&oacute;ganacht neighbours during the early medieval period. Their major church was the foundation of <a name="cosubject_9057"></a><span class="headword">Fachtna mac Mongaig</span>  (<em>fl. </em>6th cent.), <span class="occ">bishop</span>, at Ros Ailithir (Ross Carbery). According to <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span> Fachtna's feast day was celebrated on 14 August. Little is known of the saint's background. His father is named Mongach, and is attached to the genealogical stem of Corco Lo&iacute;gde. According to the notes to <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span> Fachtna was abbot of Dair-Inis. The latter was a church founded from Lismore by its abbot M&aacute;el Anfaid. The same source has Ciar&aacute;n of Saigir, a saint with strong Corco Lo&iacute;gde links, foretell Fachtna's coming. Prominent and successful, Ros Ailithir had a noted school. The annals of Inisfallen record that its lector was captured by the vikings but ransomed by Brian B&oacute;ruma in 990. At the Synod of Kells-Mellifont in 1152 Ros Ailithir became the episcopal see of the tiny diocese of Ross, a diocese that encompassed the territory of Corco Lo&iacute;gde.<br>
<br>One of the largest monasteries in the region, Cork (Corcach), lay east of Ros Ailithir and in the centre of E&oacute;ganacht Raithlind power. Its patron, bishop, and founder was <a name="cosubject_9472"></a><span class="headword">Findbarr mac Amairgin</span> <span class="st"> [Finnbar; B&aacute;irre]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>6th cent.?)<span class="occ"></span>, who is commemorated on 25 September in the martyrologies. Findbarr is celebrated in several lives, both Latin and Irish. The two major Latin lives are independent of each other, but derive from a common source that has been dated to the end of the twelfth century and the beginning of the thirteenth. The Irish life was probably composed between 1215 and 1230 and draws on the ultimate common exemplar of the Latin lives. It also contains some other, earlier material. In particular, it depicts the saint as being conceived out of wedlock, a detail glossed over in the Latin lives. In the Irish life the saint's mother is a slavewoman belonging to the king of E&oacute;ganacht Raithlind, while his father, Amairgen, is a Connachtman. In all the lives the king plans to kill the couple, but is dissuaded by Findbarr, speaking from the womb. This signals the beginning of the relationship between the E&oacute;ganacht kings and the monastery.<br>
<br>The monastery flourished during the early medieval period, and claimed a large <i>paruchia</i> under its hereditary U&iacute; Shelbaig abbots. In Findbarr's Latin life Cork claims jurisdiction over Ros Ailithir, through the simple device of portraying Findbarr as Fachtna's teacher. Furthermore, the saint dies in neighbouring Cloyne, where he is clearly treated as having jurisdiction, but his body is brought back to be buried in Cork.<br>
<br>The monastery flourished even after the creation of the viking town of Cork. Following the rise of D&aacute;l Cais and decline of Emly it became one of the principal churches of the E&oacute;ganacht. An attempted D&aacute;l Cais take-over was signalled by the intrusion of three D&aacute;l Cais abbots into the monastery in the second half of the eleventh century and first half of the twelfth. Cork, however, recovered and was recognized as an independent see in the synods of the twelfth century.<br>
<br>M&oacute;in M&oacute;r (Bairnech, Baile Mhuirne, Ballyvourney), the church and nunnery of <a name="cosubject_64407"></a><span class="headword">Gobnait <span class="st"> [Mo Gobnat]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em>6th cent.?)<span class="occ"></span> lay west of the monastery of Cork on the borders of M&uacute;scraige Mittine and E&oacute;ganacht Locha L&eacute;in. Its patron, Gobnait, is commemorated on 11 February in <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span> and was affiliated to the M&uacute;scraige. Her church never had more than local importance and Gobnait is not the subject of a life. She does appear in the life of Abb&aacute;n, where she is very much the junior partner of the male saint. Furthermore, Findbarr's life lays claim to the church by asserting that it was founded not by Gobnait, but by a disciple of Findbarr. Her cult flourished there, however, and the remains of the medieval church can still be seen. Locally, the saint's day is still celebrated.<br>
<br>The great monastery of Cloyne (Cluain Uama) was located in the kingdom of U&iacute; Liath&aacute;in. Its patron and founder was <a name="cosubject_5973"></a><span class="headword">Colm&aacute;n mac L&eacute;n&iacute;ne</span>  (530&#150;606)<span class="occ"></span>, whose feast day is recorded as 24 November in <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span> and the martyrology of Donegal. The genealogies make him a descendant of Ailill Aulomm through his father, L&eacute;n&iacute;n, and thus a member of the E&oacute;ganachta. He is often associated with &Iacute;te and with Brendan, who is credited with converting Colm&aacute;n to the religious life. Believed to have been formerly a professional poet, Colm&aacute;n has been generally accepted as the author of <span class="italic">Luin oc laib</span>, a poem which praises Domnall mac Muirchertaig (<i>d</i>. 566?), the king of Tara. There are also fragments of a poem on the death of the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill king &Aacute;ed Sl&aacute;ine (<i>d</i>. 604). It has been argued that Colm&aacute;n founded Cloyne upon receiving it as a grant from the E&oacute;ganacht king Cairpre Crom (<i>d</i>. 580?). The monastery pursued a tradition of learning in keeping with its patron, being praised as a centre of legal studies in the <span class="roman">Triads of Ireland</span>. Like other wealthy churches Cloyne survived early viking aggression, and in the twelfth century became the see of the diocese of the same name. Little survives of the medieval monastery, however, except for a round tower.<br>
<br>The Fir Maige F&eacute;ne were a prominent south Munster people. The most important church in their kingdom was Br&iacute; Gobann (Brigown parish in Mitchelstown). This was founded by <a name="cosubject_9473"></a><span class="headword">Findch&uacute; mac Finnloga</span> <span class="st"> [Finnch&uacute;]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 655/5)<span class="occ"></span>, son of Finnlug of the Connacht U&iacute; Bri&uacute;in. His mother, Idnait, was of the Ciannachta. Findch&uacute; is celebrated on 25 November in the martyrologies. Most of what is known about the saint comes from his eleventh- or twelfth-century Irish life preserved in the <span class="roman">Book of Lismore</span>, but originally copied from the lost <span class="roman">Book of Monasterboice</span>. According to the life Findch&uacute; was baptized by Ailbe, studied with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6027/', "Comgall")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51011/', "Ulster, saints of")</script>], and succeeded the latter as abbot of Bangor, before eventually founding his own monastery in Fir Maige. The life celebrates Findch&uacute;'s dealings with all of the Irish provinces, rather than the local doings of Fir Maige. The saint fosters the son of a Leinster king, defeats the U&iacute; Chennselaig, enables a D&eacute;si king to go to heaven, and saves Munster from both an Ulster and an U&iacute; N&eacute;ill invasion. He anachronistically defeats foreigners, characters inspired by the vikings, in Connacht. Findch&uacute; is represented as having dealings with several E&oacute;ganacht kings, but most especially with Cairpre Crom. Findch&uacute;'s amazing austerities form another leitmotif of the text. The life, however, seems incomplete and contains no account of the saint's death. There are at least two conflicting traditions. The annals of Inisfallen simply record his death in 655, while the annals of the four masters include him among the many clerics who died from the great plague, the <i>buide Conaill</i> in 665. Of the church of Br&iacute; Gobann little remains. Its round tower was destroyed in 1720.<br>
<br>Another important saint of the region was <a name="cosubject_18894"></a><span class="headword">Mo Laga mac Duib Dligid</span> <span class="st"> [L&oacute;ich&iacute;n; L&oacute;ch&eacute;ne]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>late 6th cent.?)<span class="occ"></span>, son of Dub Dliged of Tulach M&iacute;n Mo Laga (Labbamolaga, Templemolaga). He belonged to the U&iacute; Ch&uacute;scraid branch of the Fir Maige and his church lay on their lands. His mother, Minchollait, came from the Caenraige, a minor people. Mo Laga is commemorated on 20 January in <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span>. The Irish life of the saint, a production heavily influenced by saga, brings him into contact with Cumm&eacute;ne Fota and Mac D&aacute; Cherda, as well as the seventh-century king of Munster C&uacute; Cen M&aacute;thair (<i>d</i>. 665). Throughout the life he is represented as the special patron of Fir Maige, yet his cult seems to have spread beyond them. The patron of Singland (Saingil) near Limerick is identically named but affiliated to the D&aacute;l Cais. This affiliation, however, represents D&aacute;l Cais dominance in this area and their appropriation of the cult.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_64408"></a><span class="headword">Cranat ingen Buic&iacute;n</span>  (<em>fl. </em>6th cent.)<span class="occ"></span> was a fairly significant local Fir Maige saint. She may possibly be identifiable with the Craebnat commemorated on 17 July in the martyrology of Donegal. Her Irish life is more of an anecdote than a full-blown hagiographical production. The saint's refusal of marriage to the king of Munster, Cairpre Crom, and her gouging out of her own eyes&#151;eyes that are miraculously restored&#151;to avoid this fate are clearly modelled on the example of the more famous Brigit. Cairpre, however, dies as a result of his temerity towards the saint. In this anecdote she is represented as the uterine sister of the king of Fir Maige, and the daughter of Buic&iacute;n. Her two churches were Kilcranatan (Cell Cranatan) and Hermitage (D&iacute;sert Cranatan), both in Fir Maige F&eacute;ne.<br>
<br>The real ecclesiastical tensions that are often subsumed into the glories of the age of saints are apparent in the career of <a name="cosubject_4808"></a><span class="headword">Mo Chutu mac F&iacute;naill</span> <span class="st"> [Carthach, Carthagus; Carthach the younger]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 637), <span class="occ">abbot of Rahan (Rathan) and abbot&#150;founder of Lismore (Les M&oacute;r Mo Chutu)</span>. His feast day is celebrated on 14 May in the martyrologies. He was of the Ciarraige Luachra through his father F&iacute;nall (F&iacute;ngein). His mother Finmed came from Corco Duibne. According to the notes to <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span> he was fostered by another Carthach, <a name="cosubject_4807"></a><span class="headword">Carthach mac Fian&aacute;in</span> <span class="st"> [Carthach the elder]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>late 6th cent.)<span class="occ"></span>, whose feast day is 5 March. The latter was identified as the son of the king of Munster and the sexually straying pupil of Ciar&aacute;n of Saigir. Mo Chutu became abbot of Rahan in the lands of the southern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill. The annals of Ulster record his expulsion from Rahan in 637 during Easter, which may refer to an episode in the Easter controversy that raged in the Irish churches during the seventh century. As a Munster cleric Mo Chutu would have taken a pro-Roman approach which could have led to his expulsion. Following this, Mo Chutu travelled to D&eacute;si where he founded the great monastery of Lismore. In the several recensions of his life, both Irish and Latin, which go back to an eleventh- or twelfth-century Latin original, the Easter question is a non-issue. Instead, Mo Chutu stands against the tyrannical actions of the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill kings and is welcomed by the D&eacute;si. He appears as an equally heroic figure in the saga <span class="italic">Indarba Mo Chutu a r-Raithin</span> (&#145;The expulsion of Mo Chutu from Rahan&#146;). It must have been a matter of satisfaction to the hagiographers that Lismore surpassed Rahan in importance, becoming one of the great monasteries of the province and easily surviving the vikings. It was patronized by the kings of Munster, particularly the Mac Carthaig of Desmond, and was prominent in the church reform movement. Its influence was such that it surpassed Ardmore, the rival D&eacute;si church, and became the see of the diocese of Lismore.<h2>
<a name="SaintsoftheborderlandsMscraigeTreleandOsraige"></a>Saints of the borderlands: M&uacute;scraige T&iacute;re, &Eacute;le, and Osraige</h2>Munster's northern and eastern boundaries were to prove fluid throughout the early medieval period. M&uacute;scraige T&iacute;re (north Tipperary), &Eacute;le (Tipperary), and Osraige bordered on Leinster, and Osraige was successfully to claim Leinster status in the ninth century. The lands of this region were dotted with monastic foundations large and small. The contested nature of Osraige politics, in particular, seems to have stimulated much intellectual activity. It is no surprise, then, that the lives of these major saints should look, Janus-like, two ways. The saints inhabited a borderland between the conflicting claims of Munster and Leinster.<br>
<br>The monastery of Terryglass (T&iacute;r D&aacute; Glass), which lay very close to the border of Munster in M&uacute;scraige T&iacute;re, was one of the wealthiest churches in the midlands. Its founder, <a name="cosubject_51042"></a><span class="headword">Colum mac Crimthainn</span> <span class="st"> [Columba]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 549)<span class="occ"></span>, was of the Leinster U&iacute; Chremthann&aacute;in. His father is named as Crimthann mac Nainnida and his mother as Minchloth. Colum is commemorated on 13 December in <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span>. He died in the great plague of 549 along with several other important ecclesiastics. His Latin life dates from either the ninth or tenth century. During this period the annals record a number of abbots of Terryglass who were also abbots of Clonenagh (Cluain Ednech). The life is clearly dependent on the earlier life of Fintan, the patron of Clonenagh. Throughout Colum's life, Fintan is portrayed as his disciple, reflecting the dominance of Terryglass over Clonenagh. The life relates that Colum's main foundation is Inis Celtra, which had previously been inhabited by Mac Creiche; that a disciple, Mo Cheme, is associated with Terryglass; and that Colum's body was translated from Inis Celtra to Terryglass by his successor Nad C&aacute;em. It also links Colum with the so-called teacher of the Irish saints, Finnian of Clonard, and with Ness&aacute;n, and Colum Cille.<br>
<br>Colum's cult was promoted by the subsequent success of Terryglass. The monastery controlled a large <i>paruchia</i>, including Clonenagh and Inis Celtra. It had good relations with Tallaght and the C&eacute;li D&eacute; reform movement in the ninth century. It also enjoyed similar relations with Lorrha, and Kildare, the chief church in Leinster. During the eleventh century it came under the influence of D&aacute;l Cais. Brian B&oacute;ruma's brother Marc&aacute;n became abbot of Terryglass and Clonenagh. Terryglass was noted for its literary production, the most notable achievement of which was the great twelfth-century codex known as the <span class="roman">Book of Leinster</span>. Despite its illustrious history, the monastery suffered a precipitous decline in the latter half of the twelfth century and effectively vanished from the clerical scene. Its jurisdiction was passed to Lorrha.<br>
<br>The large monastery of Lorrha (Lothra) lay only a few miles north of Terryglass in M&uacute;scraige T&iacute;re. Its founder was <a name="cosubject_24241"></a><span class="headword">Ruad&aacute;n mac Fergusa Birn</span> <span class="st"> [Ruadanus]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 584)<span class="occ"></span>. He was counted, along with Colum, Brendan, and Cainnech, as one of the twelve apostles of Ireland and, like them, was supposedly taught by Finnian of Clonard. According to the genealogies of the saints his father was Fergus mac Echdach (or Fergus Birn) of the E&oacute;ganacht, while his mother may be the otherwise unknown C&aacute;el, mentioned in the tract &#145;On the mothers of the saints&#146;. Although Ruad&aacute;n is mentioned in only one collection of annals, his feast day is commemorated on 15 April in the martyrologies. Of his life, three Latin recensions are extant, and a lost version formed the basis for the Irish life: none is later than the twelfth century. Genealogically Ruad&aacute;n was of the E&oacute;ganacht Chaisil, and his monastery remained strongly pro-Munster in its politics. A tenth-century Munster poem portrays him as an advocate of the province's rights.<br>
<br>Ruad&aacute;n's most famous association, however, was with the cursing of Tara during the reign of the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill king, Diarmait mac Cerbaill (<i>d</i>. 565). This legend makes its appearance in saga and hagiography, although none of the accounts are later than the eleventh century. In these, Diarmait outrages Ruad&aacute;n by violating Lorrha's right of sanctuary. In retaliation Ruad&aacute;n, with a band of fellow saints, fasts against Diarmait and curses Tara before gaining satisfaction. Since this same king was so admired by Adomn&aacute;n, it has been suggested that the story arose as Munster propaganda against the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill. This interpretation appears in the <span class="roman">Book of Rights</span>, which probably dates from the reign of Muirchertach Ua Briain (<i>d</i>. 1119), the most powerful monarch of his day. Ruad&aacute;n's reputation became fixed: an eleventh- or twelfth-century poem on the saints of Ireland notes that he loved cursing. The church at Lorrha flourished throughout the early middle ages. In the twelfth century it adopted the rule of the canons regular. The bases of two high crosses survive on the site of the ancient monastery, the crosses themselves having been destroyed during the Cromwellian invasion.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_6772"></a><span class="headword">Cr&oacute;n&aacute;n moccu &Eacute;ile</span> <span class="st"> [Mo Chua; Cronanus]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 665)<span class="occ"></span> was the founder of Roscrea (Ros Cr&eacute;), the largest monastery in the kingdom of &Eacute;le. The saint's feast day is commemorated on 28 April in <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span>. According to the genealogies his father, Odr&aacute;n, was of &Eacute;le while his mother, C&oacute;emri, belonged to Corco Baiscinn. There are two extant recensions of his Latin life, the earlier and more complete of which, preserved in <span class="roman">Codex Kilkenniensis</span>, is unlikely to predate the twelfth century. The life brings Cr&oacute;n&aacute;n into contact with Clonmacnoise, and Mo Ch&oacute;em&oacute;c. One of its major set pieces is Cr&oacute;n&aacute;n's deliverance of &Eacute;le from the aggressive Osraige. It also celebrates the composition of the illuminated <span class="roman">Book of Dimma</span>; this manuscript was the prized possession of Roscrea for centuries. Roscrea flourished, partly, because it was situated on the Slige D&aacute;la, one of the five royal routes of Ireland. The C&eacute;li D&eacute; reformers did not find this conducive to ascetic life and set up their reformed church on the more isolated island in nearby Lough Cr&eacute;. Despite the relative importance of Roscrea, Cr&oacute;n&aacute;n does not figure prominently in the hagiography of other saints. The remains of a Romanesque church, a round tower, and a twelfth-century high cross mark the site of the monastery. The C&eacute;li D&eacute; house is no longer so isolated, for Lough Cr&eacute; has been drained.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_18864"></a><span class="headword">Mo Ch&oacute;em&oacute;c mac B&eacute;o&aacute;in</span> <span class="st"> [C&oacute;em&aacute;n; Pulcherius]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 656), <span class="occ">founder of Leamakevoge (Liath Mo Ch&oacute;em&oacute;c, Liath M&oacute;r, Leigh)</span>, was the other major saint of &Eacute;le. His feast day is recorded as 13 March in <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span>. Unlike Cr&oacute;n&aacute;n, Mo Ch&oacute;em&oacute;c was not related by birth to the &Eacute;li. According to the genealogies his father, B&eacute;o&aacute;n, belonged to the Conmaicne of Connacht, while his mother, Ness, of the D&eacute;si, was &Iacute;te's sister. According to the twelfth- or thirteenth-century Latin life of the saint, his father owed his life to &Iacute;te's intervention and Mo Ch&oacute;em&oacute;c's birth came about through her prophecy. He was raised in U&iacute; Chonaill Gabra and fostered by &Iacute;te. Like many other saints in the lives, he was tutored by Comgall of Bangor, before eventually founding his own monastery. It seems likely that Mo Ch&oacute;em&oacute;c's cult, like &Iacute;te's, owed much to the Corco &Oacute;che who were displaced by the U&iacute; Chonaill. Mo Ch&oacute;em&oacute;c is frequently linked with Mo Lua from Corco &Oacute;che. Overall, though, Mo Ch&oacute;em&oacute;c's life is firmly concerned with the monastic politics of &Eacute;le and its neighbours. Several structures, dating from the eleventh to the fifteenth centuries, can still be seen at Leamakevoge.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_17166"></a><span class="headword">Mo Lua moccu &Oacute;che</span> <span class="st"> [Lugaid, Lugidus]</span>  (554&#150;609), the <span class="occ">founder and abbot of Clonfertmulloe (Cluain Ferta Mo Lua)</span> in Osraige and of Druim Snechta (Drumsnat) in the Ulster kingdom of Fernmag was a saint of national significance. He is commemorated on 4 August in the martyrology of Tallaght. The genealogies name his father as Carthach of the Corco &Oacute;che, and his mother as Sochla from Osraige. This pattern, of an Osraige saint affiliated with an ancient Munster people, is familiar from the hagiography of Ciar&aacute;n of Saigir. Mo Lua's affiliation is also highlighted in the West Munster synod where he is given authority over Corco &Oacute;che. The tradition preserved in the notes of <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span> that his father was Carthach the Elder, Ciar&aacute;n of Saigir's pupil and Mo Chutu's fosterer, is clearly late.<br>
<br>There are several recensions of Mo Lua's life. The oldest, contained in <span class="roman">Codex Salmanticensis</span>, may date from as early as the eighth century. Even at this early stage the Corco &Oacute;che element of the cult is played down. The Corco &Oacute;che lose their independent character, being identified as part of U&iacute; Fhidgeinte, on the advice of whose king Mo Lua is said to have founded his monastery. Otherwise, his career follows the normal route of pupillage under Comgall of Bangor and, for good measure, Finnian of Clonard, after which he follows in his contemporaries' footsteps by going to Rome. There is a notable Leinster element in the life. Besides Cr&oacute;n&aacute;n of Roscrea, most of Mo Lua's associates are from Leinster, including the great St M&aacute;ed&oacute;c. This reflects the border nature of Clonfertmulloe which lay almost exactly between Osraige, &Eacute;le, and the Leinster kingdom of Lo&iacute;gsi. It was sited near the Slieve Bloom mountains on one of the main passes into Munster, and was supposedly founded on land donated by the king of Lo&iacute;gsi. The conflict between Munster and Leinster is highlighted after Mo Lua's death at the unidentified &#145;Tuaim Domnich&#146;. Drawing on the familiar example of Muirch&uacute;'s life of Patrick, the hagiographer relates that the people of Munster and Leinster contended for the saint's body, which, however, made its way miraculously to Clonfertmulloe, where it was buried. Even in death he mediated between the two provinces. Indeed, Clonfertmulloe thrived on its strategic position. Cumm&eacute;ne's seventh-century letter to S&eacute;g&eacute;ne refers to the abbot of Clonfertmulloe as an authority. The change in secular and ecclesiastical politics in the twelfth century and the upheaval of the Norman invasion weakened the monastery, and little now remains of it.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_4338"></a><span class="headword">Cainnech moccu D&aacute;lann</span> <span class="st"> [Cannicus]</span>  (521/7&#150;599/600) was the <span class="occ">abbot and founder of Aghaboe (Achad B&oacute; Chainnig) and Kilkenny (Cell Chainnig)</span> in Osraige. He is commemorated on 11 October in the martyrology of Tallaght and the annals of Ulster record his birth in either 521 or 527 and his death in either 599 or 600. His cult spread widely, and there are several Scottish dedications to the saint, including St Andrews (Cill Rigm&oacute;naig). He was also imagined to be the pupil of the Welsh saint, Cadog of Llancarfan. Cainnech's father, Luigthech (Lugaid), was of the Corco D&aacute;lann, who lived near Derry. His mother is named as Mella. Cainnech's northern pedigree is matched by connections with northern saints. He appears as Comgall's companion both in the life of that saint and in the recensions of his own life, the oldest of which is eighth- or early ninth-century. Additionally, the lives often place him in the company of Columba (Colum Cille), drawing some of their passages from Adomn&aacute;n's seventh-century life of that saint.<br>
<br>Cainnech's earliest hagiographer is intent on making his saint as well travelled and illustrious as possible. Cainnech journeys in Britain and in Italy as well as throughout Ireland. Surprisingly little of the life takes place in Cainnech's chief foundation of Aghaboe, where he was buried, and rather more on the island in Lough Cr&eacute;, near Roscrea, a place of supernatural manifestations. Aghaboe became the most important church in Osraige, eclipsing even Saigir. It declined in the twelfth century, however, and its place as head of Cainnech's <i>paruchia</i> was taken by Kilkenny. During the twelfth century Kilkenny became an episcopal see and eventually the stronghold of the Norman lords of Ormond.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_15841"></a><span class="headword">Lacht&iacute;n mac Tarb&iacute;n</span> <span class="st"> [Lachtna&iacute;n; Mo Lacht&oacute;c]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 622/7) was <span class="occ">abbot of Achad &Uacute;r (Freshford) and Belach Febrat (Ballyhoura Hills)</span>, the former one of the more important churches in southern Osraige. It produced the impressive early twelfth-century arm shrine, known as St Lacht&iacute;n's Arm. Unfortunately, however, there is no extant life of the founder saint. He is commemorated on 19 March in <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span> and the annals record his death in 622 and in 627. The west Munster synod assigns him, and his successors, authority over the M&uacute;scraige. This is related to his paternal affiliation: his father, Tarb&iacute;n, was of the M&uacute;scraige. The Latin life of Mo Ch&oacute;em&oacute;c makes Lacht&iacute;n a disciple of Comgall of Bangor. Like many saints, Lacht&iacute;n has left little more evidence of his cult than a date in a calendar and a church site.<h2>
<a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>The Norman invasion stands as a caesura across the history of medieval Munster. The later medieval collections of lives were the work of a different type of scholar from those who animated the age of saints. The decline of the political dynasties that had underpinned the saints' cults resulted in literary stagnation. The saints survived, outside the monasteries, in popular traditions and folklore. With the final defeat of Gaelic Ireland in the seventeenth century holy wells replaced literary lives and great monasteries as the focus for the saints.<br>
