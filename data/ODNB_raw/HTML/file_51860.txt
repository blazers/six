<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hodgkin,  Thomas Lionel</span>  (1910&#150;1982), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 3 April 1910 at Mendip House, Headington Hill, near Oxford, the elder son of Robert Howard (Robin) Hodgkin (1877&#150;1951), historian of Anglo-Saxon England, and his wife, Dorothy Forster (1886&#150;1979), fourth child of the historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36129/', "Arthur Lionel Smith (1850&#150;1924)")</script> and his wife, Mary Florence Baird. Hodgkin's childhood was disrupted by the First World War as his father, despite a Quaker upbringing, served in the army on the home front. The family returned to Oxford in 1919 and Hodgkin began an accomplished progress through the Dragon School, Winchester College, and Balliol College, Oxford, to a first in Greats in 1932. As an undergraduate he indulged in social escapades, wrote and acted in plays, contributed to university journals, and spoke at the union. He was believed to fall in love easily, and out of love painfully. A student contemporary, Diana Hopkinson, recalled that the striking colour of his fair hair &#145;gave him the appearance of a magnificent golden mole&#146;  (Hopkinson, 78). Hodgkin, in the hope of going to Palestine, went for Colonial Office interview in his final year and was offered instead an appointment in Gold Coast Colony. Friends, tutors, and family urged him not to lose himself in what was then regarded as darkest Africa. Hodgkin succumbed and rejected the post. In a letter to F. F. Urquhart of Balliol College, on 13 September 1932, he described the Gold Coast as &#145;a country with no past and no history&#151;and no present either&#151;only perhaps a promising future&#151;and that at a Kindergarten level&#146;  (priv. coll.).<br>
<br>Hodgkin went to Palestine to an archaeological dig at Jericho for the first half of 1933. After spells of teaching in Cumberland and Manchester, when he began to encounter Marxist ideas, in April 1934 he was offered the cadetship he wanted in the Palestine civil service. Two years in this post gave him a disturbing awareness of the nature of Western imperialism in general, and of British imperialism in particular. In a time of Arab nationalist awakening Hodgkin, on prison visits, was impressed that the Palestine Communist Party had members of all religions. He resigned from the colonial service and hoped to remain in Palestine to observe the aftermath of the Arab uprising of April 1936. However, the British administration in May ordered him to leave Palestine within twenty-four hours. He sent an anonymous article to <span class="italic">Labour Monthly</span> for July 1936 criticizing Britain for holding the Arabs down by force.<br>
<br>Hodgkin subsequently travelled for three months in Syria and Lebanon before returning to Britain in September 1936 to take digs with no bathroom in Holford Square, London, and join the London Library and the Communist Party. He became a committed user of the library but an intermittent and fringe member of the party. He went on to stay in west London with his father's cousin Margery Fry, penal reformer and former principal of Somerville College, Oxford. A fellow guest in March 1937 was the Somerville scientist Dorothy Mary Crowfoot (1910&#150;1994) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55028/', "Hodgkin, Dorothy Mary")</script>], who was in London to photograph insulin at the Royal Institute. Undertaking a teacher training course, Hodgkin had an uncomfortable experience of teaching schoolboys. He therefore abandoned the training and left London at the end of March 1937 for more congenial adult education in Cumberland. Margery Fry had encouraged him to go for medical examination in which narcolepsy was diagnosed and benzedrine treatment prescribed. Hodgkin and Dorothy Crowfoot were married on 16 December 1937. They were to have a son in 1938, a daughter in 1941, and a second son in 1946. Dorothy Hodgkin became one of the most eminent scientists of her time.<br>
<br>Hodgkin was rejected on medical grounds for military service in the Second World War. In September 1939 he became a Workers' Educational Association tutor in north Staffordshire, where the future Labour politician George Wigg was district secretary. Hodgkin spent the war years conducting classes with civilians and armed forces personnel, and in September 1945 became secretary of the Oxford University delegacy for extra-mural studies. With the stimulus of George Wigg and Colonial Office interest, he began in 1947 to initiate extramural work in Gold Coast Colony and Nigeria. Hodgkin's first journey to the Gold Coast in February 1947 brought him into contact with many Africans, including the senior history master at Achimota College, Miguel Ribeiro. It was a turning point in Hodgkin's life as he first learned of the kingdoms of western Sudan and recanted his error of fifteen years earlier that the Gold Coast had no history. After further journeys to Africa, Hodgkin wrote for the periodical <span class="italic">West Africa</span> in 1950 (and again in 1951) a long series of topical and scholarly articles on the background to African nationalism. He and Basil Davidson, the general secretary of the Union of Democratic Control (UDC), organized a pioneering conference at Haywards Heath on 22 and 23 October 1950 for Europeans and Africans to discuss the &#145;crisis in Africa&#146;. An enduring friendship followed Hodgkin's meeting in Accra in March 1951 with Kwame Nkrumah, then recently released from colonial imprisonment to lead the Gold Coast government (and eventually independent Ghana). The UDC in August 1951 published a pamphlet by Hodgkin supporting freedom for the Gold Coast. Hodgkin's political views had by now raised alarm both in the Colonial Office and in Oxford.<br>
<br>Hodgkin left his delegacy post in May 1952 and spent his gratuity on independent travel in Africa, including France's colonies. Under close watch by French intelligence, he found pre-colonial history a less sensitive theme than his keen interest in contemporary politics, but soon became devoted to history. He published a seminal book entitled <span class="italic">Nationalism in Colonial Africa</span> (1956), then in the late 1950s turned to the considerable role of Islam in African history and the recovery of Arabic manuscript sources for that history. He took part-time appointments in American and Canadian universities and produced an important anthology of historical writings, <span class="italic">Nigerian Perspectives</span> (1960), and a contemporary comparative study, <span class="italic">African Political Parties</span> (1961). The former study was revised and republished in 1975. He served as joint secretary of a commission on reform of the Ghana university system, and in 1962 returned to Ghana for three years as director of a new Institute of African Studies in the University of Ghana.<br>
<br>For Hodgkin the decolonization of history and the rediscovery of the African past was implicit in the political decolonization. The changed perception was filtering into the university mainstream. Oxford University created an appointment for him in October 1965 as lecturer in the government of new states and he was elected to a senior research fellowship at Balliol. He supervised graduate students from many countries in academic fields he had helped originate. When he took early retirement in 1970 thirty scholars contributed papers to a Festschrift and a selection was published as <span class="italic">African Perspectives</span> (1970). He intended to write stories for children but was diverted into an unpublished satirical novel entitled &#145;Qwert&#146;. Journeys to Vietnam in 1971 and 1974 led to a history of Vietnam over 4000 years, <span class="italic">Vietnam: the Revolutionary Path</span> (1981).<br>
<br>Hodgkin was increasingly debilitated by emphysema. He was the Antonius memorial lecturer at St Antony's College, Oxford, in June 1981, and attended, but his paper was read on his behalf. He went to Sudan to escape the harshness of the English winter and spent from November 1981 to mid-March 1982 in Omdurman. However, on the return journey to England he paused in the Greek Peloponnese in the resort village of Tolon, near Nafplion. There he suffered a heart attack and died at the Hotel Minoa, Tolon, on 25 March 1982. His obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> said he did more than anyone to establish the serious study of African history in Britain. Hodgkin was buried on 27 March in the Tolon cemetery overlooking the Aegean Sea.<br>
