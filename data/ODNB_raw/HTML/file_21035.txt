<span class="headword">Owen,  Thomas Ellis</span>  (1764&#150;1814), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, born at Conwy on 5 December 1764, was the son of William Owen, draper, and his wife, Elizabeth Ellis of Mochdre, daughter of John Ellis, a lawyer. He was admitted to Westminster School in 1780, and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 26 May 1785. The bishop of Oxford ordained him deacon on 7 June 1789, the year of his graduation, and priest on 8 March 1790. On 25 November 1790, while yet a student at Christ Church, he was instituted to the vicarage of South Stoke, Oxfordshire. Four years later, on 10 December 1794, he returned to Wales when he was instituted rector of Llandyfrydog in Anglesey, on the presentation of the bishop of Bangor. From the end of 1812 he was also perpetual curate of Penmynydd, Anglesey. He resided at Beaumaris.<br>
<br>Owen is best known as the author of two anti-Methodist pamphlets, <span class="italic">Hints to Heads of Families</span> (1801) and <span class="italic">Methodism Unmasked</span> (1802). Owen was one of a number of clerics in north Wales to defend the Anglican establishment by attacking the Methodists. In his <span class="italic">Hints</span> (which ran into a third edition after one year of publication) he denounced the Methodists as sectaries, the blind instruments or wilful tools of anarchists or atheists, who were conspiring to achieve a revolution similar to the French, which had &#145;deluged the Continent with blood&#146;  (Owen, 23). In the course of his diatribe he accused the Welsh Methodist preachers who accompanied the Welsh militia to Ireland of fomenting disloyalty among the troops. This statement aroused the anger of the Methodist leaders in north Wales, who considered taking a libel action against him. Thomas Charles and Thomas Jones, the leading Welsh Methodists, answered the charge of disloyalty levelled by Owen and others in <span class="italic">The Welsh Methodists Vindicated</span> (1802).<br>
<br>Owen's last published work (1809) was an obituary on the death of William Pitt, <span class="italic">The Tears of Britannia</span>, addressed to the Menai Pitt Club, which published it. His own obituarist in the <span class="italic">North Wales Gazette</span> (8 December 1814) wrote that he was a &#145;man eminently endowed with talents both natural and acquired, and his abilities were strenuously and successfully exerted, in defence of the Established Religion of his country&#146;. He died at The Green, Beaumaris, on 1 December 1814, and was buried at Llanfair-is-gaer, in Caernarvonshire, where there is a tablet in his memory.<br>
