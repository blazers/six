<span class="headword">Harrison,  Agatha Mary</span>  (1885&#150;1954), <span class="occ">industrial welfare reformer and unofficial diplomat</span>, was born on 23 January 1885 at Sandhurst in Berkshire, the youngest daughter of Charles Harrison, a Methodist minister, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tilt. She was educated at Jersey Ladies' College and at Redland School, Bristol, but her schooling was interrupted after her father died in 1898, though she continued her studies for a time as a pupil teacher, and obtained the Froebel certificate, which qualified her to teach young children.<br>
<br>She entered industrial welfare work with Boots the Chemist in Nottingham, and in 1915 moved to the Metal Box Company in Hull, where she made a deep impression with her vigorous championship of women workers' rights. One employee recalled that he &#145;never knew a woman that could get her own way as well as Miss Harrison&#146;  (Harrison, 19). In 1917 the London School of Economics appointed her to the first academic post in Britain concerned with industrial welfare. This work led to her appointment in 1921 by the Young Women's Christian Association as an investigator into industrial conditions in China. There she became particularly concerned with the issue of child labour, and her often successful efforts to persuade industrialists to dispense with it gave her valuable experience in negotiating in adverse conditions.<br>
<br>From 1925 to 1928 she worked in the USA for the YWCA's education and research division, after which she returned to Britain to work for the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. In 1929 she joined the Whitley commission on labour in India, serving as personal assistant to the only woman member, Beryl Power. Her six months in India fostered her sympathy with Indian nationalism, as well as her conviction that conflicts could best be resolved by patient listening and quiet firmness.<br>
<br>When the round-table conference on India was held in London in 1931, she helped with the arrangements made for Gandhi by sympathizers, and he&#151;evidently impressed by her strong personality&#151;asked her to commit herself to working for a better understanding between India and Britain. She became secretary of the India Conciliation Group, working with C. F. Andrews and Quakers like Carl Heath and Horace Alexander. This organization lobbied actively for Indian independence throughout the 1930s. She spent three extended periods in India in those years, and came to know Gandhi well, acting as an intermediary for him during his Rajkot fast in 1939.<br>
<br>This direct experience sustained her work through the difficult years of the Second World War, 1939&#150;45, and enabled her to return to India after the war to help in the background as the cabinet mission from the new Labour government negotiated with nationalist leaders. Her skills in mediation were also helpful in the conflicts that followed the partition of the subcontinent.<br>
<br>In 1940 she joined the Society of Friends (Quakers) and thereafter took an active part in its various international committees. In 1950 she joined the small Quaker team of observers at the United Nations' general assembly, and applied herself to improving contacts between the Western powers and the communists. Her distinctive mode of operation&#151;an impeccable courtesy coupled with a sense that she believed totally in the integrity of those with whom she was dealing&#151;was of immense service in this daunting task. She had great dignity: a colleague who knew her at the London School of Economics said that she looked like &#145;a tragedy queen&#146;; and she would even dress for dinner in the inappropriate setting of the Quaker Centre in Calcutta. But this grave formality was qualified by an impish sense of humour which she skilfully exploited in stressful situations.<br>
<br>In Geneva in 1954, at the conference to end the war in Indo-China, she prepared the way for informal contacts between the Chinese diplomats there and non-communist representatives. She died in Geneva from a heart attack on 10 May; her remains were cremated in Geneva, where her ashes remain.<br>
