<span class="headword">Ackermann,  George</span>  (1803&#150;1891), <span class="occ">publisher and artist</span>, was born in London on 29 January 1803, the second surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59/', "Rudolph Ackermann (1764&#150;1834)")</script> and Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Massey (1769&#150;1811). By nature quiet, gentle, and something of a dreamer, he was nevertheless an obedient son and began a long and active business career by joining his father's business as publisher of books and prints at 101 Strand in London. Shortly after his twenty-third birthday he was sent to Mexico City where he established an outlet for the sale of Ackermann publications in Spanish. Two of his watercolour views of the city were published as aquatints in 1826. He travelled to Guatemala where he opened another outlet, and it was here that he fell in love in 1828 with Jeanette (Netty) Haefkins (1812&#150;1899), the sixteen-year-old daughter of the Dutch consul. Together they climbed the 13,000 foot Volc&aacute;n de Agua, where Ackermann carved Netty's name on the summit. When, however, he was summoned home in 1829 because of his father's poor health, Netty's father refused them permission to exchange letters. On her return to Europe in 1832 they met again, and they were married in Leerdam, the Netherlands, in 1835. They had seven children, and their family homes in the London area were at various times in Camberwell, Brixton, and Paddington.<br>
<br>In the meantime, upon his return from Guatemala, Ackermann had brought with him an important collection of plants which he presented to the botanic garden in Sloane Street, Chelsea, one new specimen being named by the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew <i>Epiphyllum Ackermanii</i>. On his father's retirement in 1832 he formed a partnership with two of his younger brothers at 96 Strand. Ackermann &amp; Co. published prints of the early railways, botanical and sporting subjects, games, embossed maps, panoramas, travel books with lithographed illustrations, drawing books, and the popular annual <span class="italic">Forget-me-Not</span>. The company received the royal appointment as &#145;Book and Printsellers to HM Queen Victoria and HRH Prince Albert&#146;. In 1839 it published the first manual of photography, <span class="italic">Ackermann's Photogenic Drawing Apparatus</span>; in 1841 the classic <span class="italic">Art of Engraving</span> by T. H. Fielding; and in 1843 two prints of a remarkable prototype &#145;ariel carriage&#146; designed by the pioneers of flight Henson and Stringfellow. A short-lived financial crisis in 1843, however, required the planned publication of the magnificent <span class="italic">Orchidaceae of Mexico and Guatemala</span>, which contained several of Ackermann's drawings, to be brought out by another publisher. Ackermann &amp; Co. later published two hundred marine prints and two important colour-plate books of costume: <span class="italic">Travels in North America</span> (1843&#150;4), portraying Native American tribal clothing, and <span class="italic">The Clans of Scotland</span> (1845&#150;7), fixing the tartan image of the clans. In 1851 Ackermann &amp; Co. took a stand at the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park, London, and published what have become the definitive views of the Crystal Palace after Brannon and McNevin. In 1855, however, the brothers agreed to end their partnership, though George continued to trade as Ackermann &amp; Co. at 106 Strand until 1861.<br>
<br>In 1862, at the age of fifty-nine, Ackermann emigrated to North America with Netty and their four youngest children. Initially bound for Portland, Maine, their ship was driven by a storm up the St Lawrence River and the family disembarked at Quebec. Ackermann bought a small homestead in the pioneer settlement of Madoc in Upper Canada (Ontario), though he quickly abandoned farming to teach drawing in a succession of small towns in Ontario, including Belleville where he developed a special concern for the hearing impaired. Soon after his arrival in Canada he set himself the task of illustrating a classification of the wild flowers of Upper Canada, drawn up by the Harvard botanist Asa Gray. In search of new specimens he left the Great Lakes to move to the Atlantic maritime province of Prince Edward Island in 1876. In all, he painted over four hundred botanical studies and, in addition, twenty topographical views of early Canadian townships which have proved to be of historical interest. These Canadian paintings came to light only in 1994 in Saskatchewan. Ackermann left Prince Edward Island in 1887 to live with his son in Chicago and it was there he died, on 22 August 1891, at the Marine Hospital, Lake View. He was survived by his wife and five children.<br>
