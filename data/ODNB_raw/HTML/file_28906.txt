<span class="headword">Waylett <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cooke; <em>other married name </em>Lee]</span>,  Harriet</span>  (1800&#150;1851), <span class="occ">actress and singer</span>, was born on 7 February 1800, the daughter of an upholsterer in Bath named Cooke. Her uncle was a member of the Drury Lane company and the actress Sarah West was her cousin. After receiving some instruction in music from the violinist John Loder, she appeared on the Bath stage as Elvina in W. R. Hewetson's <span class="italic">The Blind Boy</span>, in which she earned praise from both press and public. In the next season she appeared as Leonora in <span class="italic">The Paddock</span> and as Madge in <span class="italic">Love in a Village</span>. She then went to Bristol and Brighton. In 1818 it was reported that a severe indisposition caused her disappearance from the theatre for about eight months. She returned to the stage at Coventry, where she met and married on 17 June 1819 an actor named Waylett (<i>d</i>. 1840), who was described as &#145;insignificance personified&#146;. The marriage was discordant. It was said that the couple were paired but not matched. In October 1820 they were engaged by the proprietors of the Adelphi, where Harriet was the original Amy Robsart in J. R. Planch&eacute;'s adaptation of <span class="italic">Kenilworth</span> and the first Sue to her husband's Primefit in W. T. Moncrieff's <span class="italic">Tom and Jerry</span>. In the latter part she was said to have displayed liveliness and mischief. However, husband and wife soon separated, in 1821 or 1822.<br>
<br>By 1823, during a recess at the Adelphi, Waylett was acting in Birmingham under Alfred Bunn, where she played a multitude of parts. She accompanied Bunn to Drury Lane, where she again appeared as Madge in <span class="italic">Love in a Village</span> (4 December 1824). Around this time &#145;foul insinuations&#146; were made against her and Bunn, and he threatened to prosecute for libel. Mrs Waylett promptly and spiritedly refuted all innuendoes, and the maligning party apologized and bought an expensive ticket for her benefit. At this time too, her husband made a claim for her salary to help him keep his mistress and their child, and she went to Newmarket to confront him. In order to economize she left her London apartment in Tavistock Street for cheaper lodgings and visited her family in Bath. On 14 January 1825 she was Mrs Page in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span> and at the end of the season she went to the Olympic and then to King's Lynn in Norfolk. On 12 May 1825 she made, as Zephyrina in <span class="italic">The Lady and the Devil</span>, her first appearance at the Haymarket, under D. E. Morris. It was a successful d&eacute;but, but she was not encouraged by the managers, and after playing many different parts, some original, she went to Dublin. Here she took, at the Hawkins Street Theatre, the part of Phoebe, written especially for her by John Poole in his <span class="italic">Paul Pry</span>. She also stood in high favour in Dublin and Cork as a singer.<br>
<br>After her return from Dublin, Waylett went again to King's Lynn, where local families bestowed gifts upon her. She was then seen at the Haymarket, Drury Lane, the Queen's, the Olympic, Covent Garden, and elsewhere. She sang from the gallery at Drury Lane on 18 April 1831, on the occasion of the dinner of the Friends of the Drury Lane Theatrical Fund, at which the duke of Sussex presided. In the same year she appeared there with success in <span class="italic">The Ice Witch, or, The Frozen Hand</span>. In 1832 she was at Vauxhall Gardens for a short period, and appeared in <span class="italic">Professionals Puzzled</span> and <span class="italic">Mystification</span> at Rayner's New Subscription Room. She became the sole manager at the Strand in 1834. Admission to this theatre was nominally free but actually by payment of 4 <i>s</i>. an ounce for sweets at a neighbouring shop or by purchasing tickets for the Victoria Theatre, which admitted also to the Strand. It was closed by the lord chamberlain in March 1835. By October 1835 Waylett was again in Hawkins Street, Dublin, where she received &pound;800 and half the proceeds of a benefit for twenty-one nights' performances. Diamonds were given her by a lady at the court. In 1838 she was again back at the Haymarket. Waylett's husband died in 1840 and she soon married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16284/', "George Alexander Lee (1802&#150;1851)")</script>, a musician and singer, who composed many of her favourite songs. She was known as the Queen of Ballad Singers. She sang at the Marylebone Theatre and at the English Opera House in February 1843. In May she was at the Lyceum. Soon afterwards she was involved in a speculative venture at management in Chester, which failed. Her appearances became infrequent through ill health, and by 1849 she was spoken of as retired. She died in April 1851 after a long illness and was buried in Norwood cemetery.<br>
