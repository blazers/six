<span class="headword">Faulkner,  Thomas</span>  (1777&#150;1855), <span class="occ">topographer</span>, was born in Fulham, the son of Elizabeth Charlotte Faulkner (1742/3&#150;1802). Nothing is known of his father, but some members of the family are known to have been active and successful in the building trade in west London.<br>
<br>Faulkner kept a small bookseller's and stationer's shop at 1 Paradise Row for many years. He is believed to have had a limited education, but had sufficient knowledge of French and Spanish to gain employment as a translator. He began his literary career in 1797 by communications to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, to which he was an occasional contributor for over half a century. He later became a contributor to various volumes of the earlier series of the <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine and Universal Register</span>. In 1805 he published <span class="italic">A Short Account of Chelsea Hospital</span>, which was followed in 1810 by <span class="italic">A historical and topographical account of Chelsea and its environs, with biographical anecdotes of illustrious and eminent persons who have resided in Chelsea during the three preceding centuries</span>. The work was dedicated to Brownlow North, bishop of Winchester, who then had an official house in Chelsea. Faulkner is said to have been assisted in the compilation by the Revd Weedon Butler (1773&#150;1831), a local schoolmaster. A second edition of the work appeared in 1829.<br>
<br>In 1813 Faulkner published <span class="italic">A historical and topographical account of the parish of Fulham, including the hamlet of Hammersmith</span>, dedicated to John Randolph, then bishop of London; and in 1820 his <span class="italic">History and antiquities of Kensington, with biographical anecdotes of royal and distinguished personages, and a descriptive catalogue of the pictures in the palace from a survey taken by the late Benjamin West, PRA, by command of his majesty</span>. This work was dedicated to George IV. Some etchings illustrative of the work were published by Robert Banks, from original drawings in the possession of W. Simonds Higgs FSA, a resident in Kensington, and in 1831 eight views of Kew Gardens were published from drawings by J. Sargeant, engraved by H. Waller and John Rogers.<br>
<br>In 1839 Faulkner brought out his <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of Hammersmith</span>, which was dedicated to Queen Victoria; in 1845, he published his <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of Brentford, Chiswick, and Ealing</span>, which was unfavourably reviewed in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> in December of that year. Both these works contained biographical notices of local worthies during the three preceding centuries.<br>
<br>Faulkner was a member of the Society of Antiquaries of Normandy. By 1851 he was a widower (the name of his wife is not known) with an unmarried son who was a bookseller and two unmarried daughters who were teachers, with several pupils boarding in their Chelsea household. He died at his home, 27 Smith Street, Chelsea, on 26 May 1855, at the age of seventy-eight. He was buried in Brompton cemetery.<br>
