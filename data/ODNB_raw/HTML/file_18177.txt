<span class="headword">Martin,  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1662), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born in Cambridgeshire; he was perhaps the son of Thomas Martin, baptized at Grantchester on 19 September 1591. He matriculated as a sizar from Queens' College in Easter term 1605, graduated BA in 1609, and proceeded MA in 1612. Ordained priest at Peterborough on 21 September 1617, the same year he was elected a fellow of Queens', where for some time he was a geometry lecturer. He proceeded BD in 1621. It is not clear when he first came to the attention of William Laud: he voted against the duke of Buckingham's candidacy for the chancellorship in 1626. Nevertheless, by 1628, when Laud was bishop of London, Martin was serving as his chaplain, and he acted as the licenser of a number of books in the period November 1628 to February 1632. These included, in November 1630, the notorious Arminian work <span class="italic">An Historicall Narration</span> (written by one &#145;J. A.&#146;&#151;according to William Prynne either an active Roman priest or recent convert from Catholicism, but more likely John Andrewes, author of <span class="italic">The Brazen Serpent</span>)&#151;an act for which Martin was later criticized, and which was later raised among the charges at Laud's trial.<br>
<br>Elected president of Queens' College in October 1631 (and created DD by royal mandate in the same year), Martin emerged as one of the most extreme and partisan of the Laudian college heads active in the vice-chancellor's court, both demanding the release from prosecution of a series of fellows accused of maintaining crypto-Catholic doctrines (including his chaplain, Peter Hausted), and insisting on the stiffest penalties for those accused of puritanism. The college cook reported Martin as saying that &#145;he would rather see his son in a whore house&#146; than let him go to the puritan lecturers in Holy Trinity Church  (BL, Harley MS 7019). He was sufficiently detached from the anti-Catholicism of the time to be entrusted by Secretary of State Francis Windebank with the delicate task of playing host to the secret visit to Cambridge of the papal agent Gregorio Panzani in July 1635. He escorted Panzani around the university, and, on showing the Italian a picture of a saint &#145;in abito Pontificale&#146; exclaimed with a sigh, &#145;when will such splendour be restored to our church!&#146;  (TNA: PRO, MS 31/9/17B, Panzani to Barberini, 15/25 July 1635). In Queens' College, Martin seems to have done his best to work such a restoration. There was an extraordinarily large sum of money spent on refurbishing and cleaning up the chapel during his first year as president. An often highly critical 1636 report on religious practice at Cambridge, commissioned by Laud, praised the arrangements in the college, while 1638 saw further alterations and renovations in the college chapel, with the altar being raised. A critical parliamentary report of 1641 noted that the chapel at Queens' and the ritual practised there &#145;have been much changed since Dr. Martin came in to be Master there&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 7019). He also played an important role as a proctor in the 1640 convocation. During this period Martin also accumulated local livings at a constant rate: having been made vicar of Oakington in 1626, he served as rector of Uppingham from 1631 to 1637 before proceeding to the rectories of Conington, Huntingdonshire (1635) and Houghton Conquest, Bedfordshire (1638).<br>
<br>Not surprisingly Martin proved to be a zealous royalist. In 1642 he gave &pound;100 of his own money to the king, and also oversaw the delivery of college plate to a crown agent&#151;actions which resulted in his arrest by Oliver Cromwell's troops and the sequestration of his property. He remained under house arrest in London, implacably opposed to the parliament (stating in a mock petition that he would &#145;embrace any extremity of torture and death&#146; rather than subscribe the covenant), until his escape in 1648, but was rearrested two years later and reimprisoned. He was released shortly afterwards and spent the rest of the 1650s abroad, generally in Paris with Lord Hatton, although he was resident at Utrecht in 1656. He later described these years as full of &#145;nothing but Prisons, Ships, wandrings, and solitude&#146; when he was &#145;very well satisfied with one Meal a day, and at night a Crust of Bread, and a Cup of any Drink&#146;  (Twigg, 143). Unlike the experience of some divines Martin's time abroad did nothing to lessen his hostility towards foreign protestants. In a series of letters written from Paris in the years 1659&#150;60 he bitterly attacked John Cosin's conciliatory gestures towards the Huguenots at Charenton. He particularly condemned the notion that the Church of England accepted the validity of foreign reformed ordination, and complained that by claiming that the Church of England was &#145;all one and the same church with the Huguenots here&#146;, men such as Cosin both enabled Roman Catholics to &#145;lay at our door all the Presbyterian durt, filth and prophanation&#146;, and made other English exiles in detestation of &#145;that accursed Genevian tyranny&#146; turn to Rome  (<span class="italic">Doctor Martin, Late Deane of Ely, his Opinion</span>, 71&#150;6). He was most determined to crush the suggestion that foreign presbyterians could be distinguished in any way from the rebellious English presbyterians.<br>
<br>Such views made Martin an implacable opponent of compromise at the Restoration, when he returned as president of Queens' and applauded the college's rescue from its &#145;Babylonian captivity&#146;, making &#145;downright dishonest&#146; claims about the college's financial mismanagement in the intervening years  (Twigg, 142 and n. 13), and seizing a bequest for poor scholars to pay for repairs to the college chapel. He participated in both the Savoy conference and convocation, and was nominated dean of Ely in 1662. He never took up the post, however. Installed by proxy on 25 April he died in Cambridge three days later, and was buried in Queens' College chapel.<br>
