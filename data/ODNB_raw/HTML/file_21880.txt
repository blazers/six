<span class="headword">Penny,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1520), <span class="occ">abbot of Leicester and bishop of Carlisle</span>, was probably born at Leicester, where his father, John Penny (<i>d</i>. 1496), was a freeman of the borough <i>c</i>.1452 and mayor in 1481&#150;2; his mother's name was Isabella Penny. His education is uncertain: he is said to have gone to Lincoln College, Oxford, and also to have become LLD of Cambridge, but neither claim can be substantiated. He was admitted a freeman of Leicester in 1475/6 as &#145;John Pene, pardoner&#146; (that is, licensed to sell papal indulgences). In 1477 he was an Augustinian canon at the abbey of St Mary, Leicester, in 1493 prior, and on 25 June 1496 was elected abbot. Leland notes that Penny added to the abbey buildings: a long stretch of brick precinct wall he built, bearing his initials in darker bricks, survives. He was allowed to hold the Austin priory of Bradley, Leicestershire, <i>in commendam</i> from 14 September 1503. In 1505 he became bishop of Bangor, but because of the small revenues of that see retained his abbacy and priory until after he had been translated to the bishopric of Carlisle by a bull dated 22 September 1508. His register has not survived, and little can be said of his episcopate, but in 1513 Penny and the bishop of Durham pronounced the pope's censures against the Scots for their invasion of England. He was a man of active mind, and a letter which he wrote to Wolsey in 1519 from Melbourne in Derbyshire, a manor of the bishops of Carlisle, shows that he was ready to support the cardinal in his plans for ecclesiastical reform, but was prevented by illness from attending the council summoned by Wolsey to meet in London. Penny died at the abbey in Leicester in 1520 and was buried near his parents in St Margaret's Church, Leicester, where his well-preserved alabaster effigy (placed on a new tomb in 1846) may still be seen. He gave lands towards a free school in St Margaret's parish, but in 1552 it was found that they had been sold some years previously and the money embezzled by John Beaumont, master of the rolls and recorder of Leicester.<br>
