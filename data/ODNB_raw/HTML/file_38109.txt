<span class="headword">Warr,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1648&#150;1649), <span class="occ">political and legal pamphleteer</span>, stands out among the polemicists of the civil war for his radical thinking and his elegant and vivid prose. &#145;Even truth itself will jostle its adversary in a narrow pass&#146; he wrote  (<span class="italic">Priviledges of the People</span>, Sedley and Kaplan, 76). His three surviving pamphlets, all published within the space of two years by the radical bookseller Giles Calvert, constitute all that is known about him. They give evidence of a classical education and some experience of litigation; but his contempt for the legal system&#151;&#145;when the poor and oppressed want right, they meet with law&#146;&#151;makes it unlikely that he was a lawyer. A John Warre is found in the 1650s buying up sequestrated royalist estates; but, although such a trajectory would not have been unique among civil-war radicals, there is no evidence that this was the same man.<br>
<br>Warr's stance in the contest between monarchy and parliament was that neither form of government would offer the common people freedom. That must come from the natural reason that every individual possessed: &#145;There are some sparks of freedom in the minds of most, which ordinarily lie deep and are covered in the dark as a spark in the ashes&#146;  (Sedley and Kaplan, 79). But the constitutional foundation of freedom, he argued, using a phrase that was not to come into its own until the age of the French and American revolutions, was neither monarchical authority nor a property-based franchise but &#145;people's rights&#146;.<br>
<br>Warr's first known publication, <span class="italic">Administrations Civil and Spiritual</span> (1648), although on the face of it a theological tract, begins to grapple with the conflict between what he calls the &#145;darkness&#146; of formal religion and imposed social order and the inner light of spirituality and reason. In it he invokes the everlasting gospel&#151;the twelfth-century millenarian heresy that had resurfaced in the German peasants' revolt of 1525 and was to re-emerge in William Blake's epic poems, forecasting an era of human equality and justice. In doing so Warr perceptibly follows the road, well-trodden in this period, from spiritual to secular radicalism.<br>
<br>It was in his next and arguably finest pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Priviledges of the People</span>, published about the time of the execution of Charles I in early 1649, that Warr completed the transition. Although he acknowledged &#145;a beauty in monarchy, duly circumscribed, as well as in other forms of government&#146;  (Sedley and Kaplan, 84) he now argued that the natural and rational order of society was egalitarian, not authoritarian. The purpose of law, he argued, was not to constrain the common people but to liberate them by constraining &#145;the mighty&#146;: &#145;'Tis not possible for a people to be too free&#146;  (ibid., 80). Between rulers and ruled there was &#145;an irreconcilable contest &hellip; which will never cease till either prerogative and privilege be swallowed up in freedom or liberty itself be led captive by prerogative&#146;  (ibid., 79). He no longer looked to a divine scheme. Nor did he believe any longer in an ordained outcome: &#145;He which hath the worst cause may sometimes have the best success&#146; (ibid.).<br>
<br>From authority and equality Warr turned in his third pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Corruption and Deficiency of the Laws of England</span>, published in the summer of the same year, to the law. The view of the legal system as a ruinous snare for ordinary people was widespread in this period; but Warr, while adding his voice to the denunciations, went beyond and behind the present state of things, memorably locating the demand for rational laws in &#145;a spirit of understanding big with freedom and having a single respect to people's rights&#146;  (Sedley and Kaplan, 92).<br>
<br>Warr does not slot readily into any faction. His antipathy to land tenures&#151;&#145;slavish ties and badges upon men&#146;&#151;as well as his use of botanical imagery may suggest an affinity with Gerrard Winstanley and the Diggers. His egalitarianism echoes that of the Leveller Thomas Rainborowe in the Putney debates of 1647. But Warr's work is better seen as one elegant strand in a long skein of English radicalism, reaching back to the mysticism of the everlasting gospel and forward, through the great democratic revolutions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, to the universalism of democratic theory and human rights.<br>
<br>More immediately, when in 1657 Cromwell became lord protector his oath of office included &#145;the maintenance and preservation &hellip; of the just rights and priviledges of the People&#146;. If Warr was still alive he must have enjoyed the irony of an autocracy co-opting his project of turning privilege, and the world with it, upside down.<br>
