<span class="headword">Tytler,  Christian Helen  Fraser-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Christian Helen Shairp]</span>  (1897&#150;1995), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Elie, Fife, on 23 August 1897, the only daughter and youngest of three children of John Campbell Shairp (1858&#150;1913), advocate and sheriff, of Houston, Uphall, Linlithgow, and his wife, Harriet Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1949), the third daughter in a family of five daughters and two sons of Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Thomas Erskine, second baronet, army officer, of Cambo, Fife. Her two older brothers, Norman (<i>b</i>. 1891) and John (<i>b</i>. 1894), both served with the Ayrshire yeomanry during the First World War; Norman died on active service on 13 October 1918. She was educated at home by a governess, and then joined the Foreign Office, in which she worked as a clerical officer from 1917 to 1919. In the latter year she attended the peace conference at Versailles. There she met, and on 19 June 1919 married, Neil Fraser-Tytler (1889&#150;1937), a colonel in the Inverness-shire Royal Horse Artillery. He was the second and only surviving son in a family of two sons and one daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Grant Fraser-Tytler, army officer, of Aldourie and Balnain, Inverness-shire, and his first wife, Edith Adriana, daughter of Sir Charles Selwyn, lord justice of appeal. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>Between the wars Christian lived at her husband's home, Aldourie Castle, Loch Ness (and believed in the existence of the Loch Ness monster). After her husband's death she joined the ATS, which had been formed in 1938 to replace the women's army corps, which had done sterling work in the First World War but had subsequently been disbanded.<br>
<br>Fraser-Tytler served at the War Office from 1939 to 1943 as a member of the staff of the adjutant-general, Sir Ronald Adam; she became a controller in 1940. With Dame Helen Gwynne-Vaughan she reorganized the service and was appointed director of organization, ATS. She established and ran AG16, the department responsible for recruiting and organizing the rapidly expanding ATS. A major problem in those early days was deciding which tasks could be managed successfully by women, and, once decisions had been taken, ensuring that suitable appointments and postings were arranged. This was an area in which there was considerable divergence of opinion in the army but where Fraser-Tytler's tact and insight proved invaluable. Her achievements were recognized by her appointment as CBE (military) in 1941. Hers was one of the first honours conferred on a woman during the war.<br>
<br>By 1943 the need for, and soon the indispensability of, women on anti-aircraft sites was unmistakable. ATS staff were serving in anti-aircraft command in a variety of tasks from clerical to transport and cooking, but were regarded as particularly valuable in the mixed anti-aircraft batteries of 200 men and 200 women. With the arrival of flying bombs (V1s) and rockets (V2s) many of these anti-aircraft units had to be hastily deployed on coastal sites where conditions were far from satisfactory, a fact noted by the press, among other critics. At least one MP, Tom Driberg, encouraged ATS women to express their complaints. In 1943 Fraser-Tytler was appointed deputy director ATS in anti-aircraft command, and in the next two years she had to deal with this and similar problems, which involved endless travelling to gun sites, mostly in remote areas. Her duties also included escorting the queen (later Queen Elizabeth, the queen mother) and the princess royal to anti-aircraft units where ATS people were serving, and to bomb-damaged areas.<br>
<br>After demobilization Fraser-Tytler returned to Aldourie Castle, where she indulged her passion for fishing. She became a JP and ran the ATS in Ross and Cromarty and Inverness-shire, as well as serving on the Scottish council of the Young Women's Christian Association, and representing Scotland on the national council. She also founded the local branch of the women's rural institute (the Scottish Women's Institute).<br>
<br>Although a strong woman, with powerful organizational abilities, Christian Fraser-Tytler was far from the conventional idea of a female brigadier, and always remained charming and elegant. She died at St Andrews on 30 June 1995 and was survived by her two daughters, Ann (<i>b</i>. 1920), who married Sir David Erskine, fifth baronet, and Mary Hermione (<i>b</i>. 1922), who married Rear-Admiral Sir Patrick Morgan.<br>
