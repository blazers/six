<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kington,  Miles Beresford</span>  (1941&#150;2008), <span class="occ">humorist, jazz critic, and broadcaster</span>, was born on 13 May 1941 at Down County Infirmary, Downpatrick, co. Down, the elder son of William Beresford Nairn Kington (1909&#150;1982), a brewer then serving as a captain with the 4th Royal Welch Fusiliers, and his first wife, Jean Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sanders (1912&#150;1973). His brother, Stuart, was two years younger. They grew up in north Wales, where their father was a director at Border Breweries, and Kington was educated at Trinity College, Glenalmond, in Scotland. Nevertheless, he saw himself very much as an Englishman (although to complicate matters further, he was actually half American, his mother being an American citizen).<br>
<br>&#145;From an early age&#146;, Kington later wrote, &#145;perhaps confused by my shifting geography, I knew I wanted to be a humorous writer and a jazz musician.&#146; At school he started his own jazz band and set up a humorous magazine in opposition to the official school magazine. While at Trinity College, Oxford, where he read French and German, he played the double bass in jazz groups and wrote humorously for undergraduate magazines. No doubt because of his extracurricular activities, he graduated with a third-class degree in 1963. &#145;When I left university I was almost entirely unfitted for life,&#146; he later said, &#145;and consequently went to London to try my luck as a free-lance humorous writer, where I nearly starved to death.&#146; To stave off hunger, he took up part-time gardening. Meanwhile, on 29 February 1964, he married Sarah (Sally) Paine (<i>b</i>. 1941), a museum research assistant, and daughter of Robert William Paine, architect. They had a daughter, Sophie, and son, Thomas (Tom). The marriage ended in separation in 1980, and subsequently divorce in 1987. In 1981 Kington met (Hilary) Caroline Maynard (<i>b</i>. 1948), a theatre and television director, and daughter of Bryan Carter, writer. They married on 6 June 1987. Through this marriage Kington gained a stepdaughter, Isabel, and then another son, Adam. He lived latterly in Limpley Stoke, near Bath.<br>
<br>Music was always important to Kington and he played a number of instruments, particularly the piano (always classical music) and the double bass (always jazz). Jazz was a passion and he acquired his first professional writing job, in 1965, at <span class="italic">The Times</span>, having lobbied the arts editor to employ him as the paper's jazz reviewer, a job he did for fifteen years. Similarly, in 1965 he set his sights on joining <span class="italic">Punch</span> and bombarded the editor with articles until he gave in and allowed him to join the staff. In 1970 he became the literary editor, recruiting a stable of talented reviewers. He was perhaps best known for his column, &#145;Let's Parler Franglais&#146;, described by Michael Bywater as &#145;a macaronic jeu d'esprit in which he dissected the vagaries of the British from behind the screen of a crazed bilingualism&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 1 Feb 2008). So successful was the column that four volumes of Franglais were published between 1979 and 1982, followed by a fifth, <span class="italic">The Franglais Lieutenant's Woman</span>, in 1986. With characteristic self-deprecation, Kington described them as &#145;probably the most popular bilingual lavatory books of the 1980s&#146;  (<span class="italic">Le Bumper Book of Franglais</span>, 2010, book cover). His first book had been <span class="italic">The World of Alphonse Allais</span> (1977, republished in 1983 as <span class="italic">A Wolf in Frog's Clothing</span>), translations of the work of a nineteenth-century French poet and humorist. The book led to a broadcast on Radio 3 and was the beginning of a long association with the BBC as a broadcaster and writer.<br>
<br>In 1970 Kington joined Instant Sunshine, a popular cabaret group, all doctors excepting Kington himself. &#145;I always travel with three physicians in tow&#146;, he would quip  (personal knowledge). He was the bass player, and wrote most of the introductions to their songs as well as wry, witty monologues. This gave him a taste for audiences and was a good training ground for developing his skills as an accomplished public speaker. He was a regular at the Edinburgh fringe festival and wrote his only full-length play, <span class="italic">Waiting for Stoppard</span> (1995), to premi&egrave;re there. He also performed a one-man show, <span class="italic">A Rough Guide to the Fringe</span> (1992), and co-wrote and acted in <span class="italic">Bizarre</span> (1995) and <span class="italic">The Death of Tchaikovsky: a Sherlock Holmes Mystery</span> (1996), both with actor&#150;musician Simon Gilman.<br>
<br>By the 1980s Kington was making regular appearances on British television and radio. Television programmes included <span class="italic">Three Miles High</span> (1980), about a railway journey in Peru, <span class="italic">Steam Days</span> (1986), <span class="italic">The Burma Road</span> (1989), <span class="italic">In Search of the Holy Foreskin</span> (1996), in which he searched for holy relics, and <span class="italic">Fine Families</span> (1998), in which he interviewed eccentric members of the Welsh aristocracy, all for the BBC; <span class="italic">Jazz at the Albert</span> for HTV; <span class="italic">Let's Parler Franglais</span> for Channel 4; and numerous guest appearances on <span class="italic">Call My Bluff</span> and other shows. But he eschewed a potentially glittering television career, turning down, among other things, the offer to present <span class="italic">Around the World in Eighty Days</span>. Television, he said, got in the way of writing. Radio, however, gave him the opportunity to exercise his considerable broadcasting skills. His light, witty touch, and his ability to look at life's experiences in a different, tangential, and oblique way meant he was much in demand. He presented various radio series, including <span class="italic">In the Archives</span>, <span class="italic">Double Vision</span>, <span class="italic">Reading Music</span>, <span class="italic">The Miles Kington Interviews</span>, and <span class="italic">It's a Funny Old World</span>. He was a regular guest on a wide variety of programmes including <span class="italic">The Write Stuff</span>, <span class="italic">Quote, Unquote</span>, <span class="italic">It's a Good Read</span>, and <span class="italic">The News Quiz</span>, and made over sixty documentaries on subjects as diverse as General de Gaulle, Brezhnev, Franco, John Betjeman, Jean-Paul Sartre, Django Reinhardt, Kansas City Jazz, and teaching English as a foreign language.<br>
<br>In 1980 Kington parted company with <span class="italic">Punch</span>. He wrote to Harold Evans, editor at <span class="italic">The Times</span>, offering himself as a humorous columnist. When Evans did not reply, Kington sent him copy daily until Evans relented. Kington's column, &#145;Moreover&#146;, appeared until 1987 when he switched to <span class="italic">The Independent</span>, where he continued to write on a daily basis, the last copy appearing the day he died; he also wrote a column for <span class="italic">The Oldie</span>. In all he wrote over 4500 columns, described by Simon Kelner as &#145;witty, topical, erudite, acutely observed&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 1 Feb 2008). &#145;As with the very best in any sphere of endeavour,&#146; Simon O'Hagan asserted, &#145;Miles's trick was to make it look easy. His lightness of touch amounted to a kind of genius. But behind the conversational prose lay craftmanship of the highest order. His standards never wavered&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 8 Feb 2008). What struck his colleagues was his intense curiosity about everything, and his ability to wring humour from the most mundane object or situation. As Terence Blacker wrote, &#145;He had an excellent eye for a funny story but also had a great ear, presenting the column in a wide variety of registers and voices while retaining the particular personality of his writing&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 1 Feb 2008).<br>
<br>Kington's later books included <span class="italic">Miles and Miles</span> (1982), <span class="italic">Nature Made Ridiculously Simple</span> (1983), <span class="italic">Vicarage Allsorts</span> (1985), <span class="italic">Welcome to Kington</span> (1989), <span class="italic">Jazz: an Anthology</span> (edited, 1992), <span class="italic">Motorway Madness</span> (1998), <span class="italic">Someone Like Me: Tales from a Borrowed Childhood</span> (2005), and the posthumously published <span class="italic">The Best by Miles</span> (2009) and <span class="italic">Le Bumper Book of Franglais</span> (2010).<br>
<br>Kington was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2007 but continued working until his death, at his home, on 30 January 2008. His funeral was held on 11 February at St Mary's, Limpley Stoke, where he was buried; a memorial service followed on 25 June 2008 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London. His hilarious response to his final illness, totally lacking in self-pity, formed the basis of the posthumously published <span class="italic">How Shall I Tell the Dog?</span> (2008). He was survived by his wife, Caroline, his three children, and his stepdaughter.<br>
