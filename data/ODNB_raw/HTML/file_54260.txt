<span class="headword">Lindsay family of Barnweill, Crawford, and Glenesk</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1250&#150;<em>c.</em>1400), <span class="occ">nobility</span>, took their name from Lindsey, Lincolnshire. They arrived in Scotland early in the twelfth century, as tenants of the future King David's honour of Huntingdon, and established a territorial base in Haddingtonshire where they held Byres, Luffness, and Ballencrief, as well as Barnweill in Ayrshire and the large barony of Crawford in Lanarkshire. Three main lines developed in the thirteenth century, but the two senior ones finished in heiresses who married into families which took the English side in the wars of independence. What became the main Scottish line descended from Sir David Lindsay of the Byres, who enjoyed a distinguished career in the mid-thirteenth century, during which he was a regent in 1255 and chamberlain the following year, and who died on crusade in Egypt in 1279. The son of his marriage, <a name="cosubject_16685"></a><span class="headword">Sir Alexander Lindsay of Barnweill</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1309<span class="mult">x</span>14)<span class="occ"></span>, must have been a minor when his father died, for his ward was granted to John Comyn of Badenoch in 1279. His lands were valued at 43 merks yearly. Of age by 1290, when he attended the parliament of Birgham, Lindsay is said to have been knighted by Edward I, and in August 1296 did homage for his Scottish lands to the English king. He is also recorded in that year as holding Luffness and Ballencrief from Henry de Pinkney, the English heir to those Lindsay estates and possibly also to Crawford.<br>
<br>Despite his early links with Comyn and Edward I, after 1296 Alexander Lindsay is usually found among the adherents of the younger Robert Bruce; his wife was probably a sister of James the Steward, a prominent Bruce supporter. Lindsay refused to participate in Edward I's expedition to Flanders in 1297, and with his younger brother John instead joined Wallace and Bruce in their short-lived rising against the English king in July 1297. Following the Scottish capitulation, Lindsay stood surety for Bruce's handing over of hostages. Lindsay appears to have been briefly in Edward's peace after the battle of Falkirk (22 July 1298), but was forfeited again later that year, and presumably continued to fight against the English until the general surrender of 1304. Recognized as a prominent figure in the Scottish resistance, Lindsay was exiled from Scotland for half a year by Edward's ordinance of September 1305, but he seems to have returned early, in time to be present in Bruce's company when the latter killed John Comyn of Badenoch on 10 February 1306 and declared himself king. Lindsay then remained with King Robert during the difficult months which followed, until he was himself captured at Kildrummy in September and his lands forfeited. However, Lindsay was free again by the summer of 1308, when he was one of the leaders of that year's Galloway campaign. As a prominent Bruce supporter he was a signatory of the letter sent to Philippe IV of France from the St Andrews parliament of 1309. He may have witnessed a royal charter in 1312, but was certainly dead by 10 December 1314.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54261"></a><span class="headword">Sir David Lindsay</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1357)<span class="occ"></span>, normally styled &#145;of Crawford&#146;, Sir Alexander's eldest son, had earlier been captured by the English with his brothers Alexander and Reginald, and he remained in prison until late in 1314, when he was probably exchanged for an Englishman taken at Bannockburn. Already a knight by that date, he was a witness to several important documents, notably the declaration of Arbroath in 1320, the truce with England of 1323, and the treaty of Edinburgh of 17 March 1328. Lindsay obtained various grants of land in Annandale from Robert I, and is recorded as keeper of Berwick in 1329. After the renewal of Anglo-Scottish hostilities, he was forfeited by Edward III in 1337 of his lands of Byres and of tenements at Chamberlain-Newton in Roxburghshire. He was never close to David II, but rather was an associate of Robert the Steward, his likely kinsman, who as guardian of Scotland appointed him constable of Edinburgh Castle in 1346, after the king's capture at Nevilles Cross. Lindsay was, however, granted several safe conducts to visit England to negotiate for David's release.<br>
<br>About 1324 David Lindsay married Mary Abernethy (<i>d</i>. 1355), daughter and coheir (with her sister Margaret, countess of Angus) of Alexander Abernethy, and widow of Andrew Leslie. This important marriage was the foundation of later Lindsay influence north of Forth, eventually raising the family from the ranks of the middling baronage into the peerage. David Lindsay had four sons, of whom David, the eldest, was killed at Nevilles Cross. In 1327 Lindsay gave land in Lanarkshire to Newbattle Abbey for the souls of himself and his wife, and he also established a mass for his wife at Lindores Abbey in Fife, where she was buried. Lindsay himself was dead by 13 October 1357, when his son James is referred to as lord of Crawford. <a name="cosubject_54262"></a><span class="headword">Sir James Lindsay of Crawford</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1358)<span class="occ"></span>, David's second son, inherited only his father's possessions, raising the possibility that he was the son of an earlier marriage. He maintained his family's links with the stewards, in 1346 marrying Egidia Stuart, the daughter of Walter the Steward and half-sister to the future Robert II. He attended the king's parliament of September 1357, and later that year was appointed ambassador to England. He died in the following year. It seems clear that he was not the James Lindsay executed in 1358 for killing Roger Kirkpatrick near Dumfries. His estates went to his son without further ado, and the fact that on 1 October 1358 David II confirmed the grant of the Byres which James Lindsay had earlier made to his brother Alexander would also appear to clear James of suspicion.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_74925"></a><span class="headword">Sir Alexander Lindsay of Glenesk</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1382)<span class="occ"></span>, the beneficiary of his elder brother's grant, served in his youth as squire to his cousin Thomas Stewart, earl of Angus. He had inherited his mother's lands north of Tay, and also received grants from his aunt Margaret, countess of Angus, which effectively reconstituted the Abernethy inheritance. About 1358, moreover, he married Catherine Stirling (<i>d</i>. by 1378), daughter and coheir of John Stirling of Glenesk, whose estates in the sheriffdoms of Forfar and Inverness were entailed on him and their joint heirs. His lands of Byres he entailed to his younger brother William in January 1367 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54268/', "Lindsay family of the Byres (per. 1367&#150;1526)")</script>]. Active as a crusader and jouster, Sir Alexander was high in David II's favour, while after 1371 he was equally close to Robert II, whose niece Marjory Stewart he married, probably about the time of Robert's accession. He attended Robert's coronation, together with his nephew <a href="#cosubject_16700">James Lindsay of Crawford [<i>see below</i>]</a> (the son of Sir James and Egidia), and became a regular charter witness for the new king, as he had been for David II. It may also have been in 1371 that he was made justiciar north of Forth jointly with his nephew; they were certainly acting in this capacity by 1373, though from 1374 Alexander Lindsay held this office on his own. In 1375 he arranged for his son and heir, David, to marry the king's daughter Elizabeth. He retained royal favour and the justiciarship until 1381, when he set off on pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Granted a safe conduct on 4 December to travel through England, he died on Crete some time before March 1382.<br>
<br>Like his uncle Sir Alexander, <a name="cosubject_16700"></a><span class="headword">Sir James Lindsay of Crawford</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1395/6)<span class="occ"></span> was a charter witness for Robert II, but his closest links were with John Stewart, earl of Carrick, the heir to the throne. He acquired the barony of Kirkmichael in Dumfriesshire in 1377 and received royal patronage elsewhere, including the old thanage of Alyth in Perthshire. Thanks to his connection with Carrick, and with the first earl of Douglas, he was prominent in Anglo-Scottish diplomacy, receiving numerous English safe conducts between 1374 and 1395. He helped to shelter John of Gaunt in Scotland during the peasants' revolt, took part in a raid into England in 1384, and in August 1388 was captured by the bishop of Durham while pursuing an English knight from the battlefield of Otterburn, though he was released in the following summer. In 1373&#150;4 he acted as justiciar north of Forth with his uncle, and from 1378 is recorded as sheriff of Lanark. Following Alexander Lindsay's death in 1382, James Lindsay failed to secure the justiciarship for himself. In the same year the title of earl of Buchan, to which James had a remote claim, was given to Alexander Stewart, the king's youngest son. Possibly it was his failure to secure these dignities which on 4 November 1382 caused Lindsay to assassinate Sir John Lyon, the king's son-in-law and chamberlain. Lindsay had perhaps befriended Lyon (one chronicler asserts that he had concealed Lyon's liaison with Robert II's daughter Jean, whom he subsequently married), and he may have been disappointed that Lyon, who could also have been a territorial rival, did not sufficiently use his influence with the king to promote Lindsay's claims.<br>
<br>Following the death of his uncle in 1382, Sir James Lindsay (as lord of Crawford head of the senior line of the family) became the effective leader of a powerful Lindsay&#150;Leslie northern affinity which had probably originated in the marriage of his grandfather, Sir David Lindsay. After the murder of Lyon he withdrew briefly to England, but had returned by November 1384, when he used his affinity to support Carrick when the latter grasped power and marginalized Robert II. He then litigated for Buchan, and styled himself &#145;lord of Crawford and Buchan&#146; for the rest of his life. His hopes of restricting Alexander Stewart's power were not realized, but he remained loyal to Carrick, supporting his accession as Robert III in 1390. He then became a close associate of the new king's eldest son, David, earl of Carrick, and was probably the leading member of the latter's household. He was also much involved in government. An exchequer auditor in 1391, he stood surety for an extension of the truce of Leulighem in 1392, and was a conservator of the Anglo-Scottish truce in 1394, when he was also one of the commissioners appointed to negotiate a permanent peace with England.<br>
<br>Sir James Lindsay married Margaret, daughter of Sir William Keith, a union which did not prevent Lindsay from becoming embroiled in a serious inheritance dispute with his wife's family in 1395. They had two daughters, Margaret and Euphemia, but lacking male heirs he obtained mutual charters of entail with his cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16689/', "David Lindsay of Glenesk")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54265/', "Lindsay family, earls of Crawford (per. c.1380&#150;1495)")</script>], the son of Alexander, about 1384. Consequently the bulk of his estates (but not Barnweill) passed to the collateral line when Sir James died, between 5 April 1395 and 6 March 1396. The steady rise of the Lindsays, which was made possible by marriages and royal patronage for both the main branches of the family, achieved its appropriate culmination when David Lindsay, who united in his person the Crawford and Glenesk inheritances, was created earl of Crawford in 1398.<br>
