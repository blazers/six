<span class="headword">Schweppe,  (Jean) Jacob</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1740, <em>d.</em> 1821), <span class="occ">artificial mineral water manufacturer</span>, was baptized in the Liebfrauenkirche in Witzenhausen, Hesse, on 16 March 1740, the son of Conrad Schweppe, a peasant. Believing that their son lacked the strength for agricultural life his parents turned him over to a travelling tinker when he was only eleven or twelve years old. Before long the tinker brought him back, explaining that the boy was so adept at mending pots that he should be put to the silversmiths' craft; the same then occurred, the silversmith recommending that he learn the jewellers' craft. Schweppe soon moved to Geneva, a centre for this trade, was formally accepted as a resident of Geneva&#151;the first step to naturalization&#151;and on 4 October 1767 he married, in a protestant church, El&eacute;onore (<i>d</i>. 1796), the daughter of Antoine Roget and his wife, Susanne Bertrand. Of their nine children only one daughter, Nicolarde (1777&#150;1836), known as Colette, survived infancy.<br>
<br>For nine years from 1777 Schweppe was in partnership with Jean Louis Dunant, during which time he submitted his master-work and was admitted <i>ma&icirc;tre-bijoutier</i> in the jewellers' guild of Geneva. He was an enthusiastic amateur scientist and a keen reader of the literature of physics, where he encountered the works of Joseph Priestley, who had been experimenting with mildly aerated waters. About 1780 Schweppe began developing apparatus for making artificial mineral water, and was the first to use a force pump to carbonate under pressure. He gave these waters to any whom the doctors thought would benefit from them. Demand grew and eventually he was persuaded to accept payment, thus by 1783 establishing a commercial enterprise. His continuing experiments to improve the pump brought him in touch with Nicolas Paul, son of Geneva's leading scientific instrument maker, and Henry Albert Gosse, a noted pharmacist. The three men entered into a nine-year partnership in 1790 and decided to establish a second factory in London, to be managed by Schweppe.<br>
<br>Schweppe arrived in London on 9 January 1792 with an introduction from Professor Marc-Auguste Pictet of Geneva, and established his factory in Drury Lane. Initially he found few customers, for mildly aerated waters were widely available. Business was so slow that the partners recalled him in December, but matters became confused by the political situation in France, which permeated adjacent parts of Switzerland, and came to a head when France declared war on Britain in February 1793. Schweppe feared that he and his daughter, who had now joined him, would be expelled, and appealed to the government to be allowed to remain in London. After considerable wrangling the partnership was dissolved in 1796; Schweppe traded his share of the Swiss partnership for the London business&#151;his factory and home were now in Margaret Street. His wife died in Geneva in 1796 at a time when he and Colette were unable to travel there.<br>
<br>By this time Schweppe's assorted mineral waters were being drunk for their curative powers and as refreshing beverages, sometimes mixed with syrup or wine. Medical practitioners were impressed by their high carbonation and Erasmus Darwin specifically recommended Schweppe's waters in his treatise <span class="italic">Zoonomia</span> (1794&#150;6). About 1796, in preparation for his retirement, Schweppe sold three-quarters of his interest to three Jerseymen, keeping one-eighth each for himself and Colette, later yielding half of this residue to their manager, Stephen DeMole, against his promise not to divulge the secrets of manufacture.<br>
<br>The French annexation of Geneva in 1798 meant that Schweppe found himself a French citizen when he returned about 1802; he settled near Geneva at Les Petits Cr&ecirc;ts, in Bouchet, Petit Saconnex. Colette married in 1806 and lived in Geneva near her father. He occupied himself with gardening, agriculture, and mechanics. A skilled clockmaker, he constructed, in his eightieth year, a detailed and intricate orrery to replace an earlier one which annoyed him by the clicking of its wheels.<br>
<br>Two contemporary diarists recorded their impressions of Schweppe. Charles de Constant, cousin of the more famous Benjamin, French writer and politician, said of him in 1816, &#145;his great age, his white hair, contrast strongly with his vivacity and his energy; he has an originality of expression and a fire which belong only to genius&#146;. Gilbert Elliot, second earl of Minto, while staying in Geneva in 1821, recorded an account of Schweppe given him by J. J. Huber, the blind Swiss naturalist, an old friend of Schweppe in Bouchet. Huber described him as a man of very great genius and originality; a man of learning but also of much modesty and simplicity of character. Schweppe had at that time suffered an apoplectic attack from which he died at Les Petits Cr&ecirc;ts, on 18 November 1821.<br>
