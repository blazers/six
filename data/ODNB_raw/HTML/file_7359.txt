<span class="headword">Day,  Alfred</span>  (1810&#150;1849), <span class="occ">music theorist</span>, was born in London in January 1810. His father disapproved of his early enthusiasm for music, and he proceeded to study medicine in London and Paris, eventually gaining a diploma from Heidelberg. On his return to London he set up in practice as a homoeopathist, while at the same time nurturing his musical interests. He received instruction from the opera conductor W. H. Kearns and sought the acquaintance of prominent younger musicians such as George Macfarren. Around 1840 he was engaged by Macfarren's father as a critic for the <span class="italic">Musical World</span>, &#145;until he could no longer bear with the laconical bitterness of this reviewer&#146;  (Banister, 80). He had already begun work on his controversial <span class="italic">Treatise on Harmony</span>, the work on which his reputation is entirely based; it was eventually published in London in 1845.<br>
<br>In his attempt to explain harmonic practice in a scientific manner, Day was subscribing to a tradition that stretched back to Rameau's treatise of 1722. But he felt dissatisfied with the inconsistencies of earlier theory, and sought to devise a comprehensive and logical system, based on two broad principles. Firstly, he proposed a clear distinction between the ancient and modern styles: the one strict, diatonic, and contrapuntal, with codifiable laws of dissonance preparation; the other free, chromatic, and harmonic (the chromatic notes explicable without recourse to modulation). Secondly, he developed a systematic theory of harmonic progression, based on three fundamental chords of tonic, supertonic, and dominant, all with the possibility of superimposed thirds up to the thirteenth. The novelty and complexity of this seemingly dogmatic system led initially to a cold reception. Macfarren, however, espoused Day's theories at the Royal Academy of Music, even resigning in 1847 when his adherence was questioned; he published a second edition of the <span class="italic">Treatise</span> in 1885. Day's work was enormously influential on British pedagogy in the later nineteenth century, but his concentration on harmony as a generative procedure has been much criticized, and superseded by a modern view of functional harmony within a contrapuntal context.<br>
<br>Day's intellectual curiosity led him constantly to question established modes of thought, in medicine as well as in music. But he did not live to see his ideas achieve a measure of acceptance during the Victorian era. Following several years of illness he died from consumption at 102 Park Street, Camden Town, London, on 11 February 1849.<br>
