<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thomas of Lancaster</span>, second earl of Lancaster, second earl of Leicester, and earl of Lincoln  (<em>c.</em>1278&#150;1322), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8504/', "Edmund, earl of Lancaster and Leicester (1245&#150;1296)")</script>, second surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12950/', "Henry III")</script>, and of Blanche (<i>d</i>. 1302), widow of Henri, king of Navarre, and daughter of Robert, count of Artois, son of Louis VIII of France. On his father's side Thomas was thus the grandson of Henry III, the nephew of Edward I, and the cousin of Edward II, and on his mother's side, the grandson of Louis VIII of France and grandnephew of Louis IX: a position close to the two royal families of England and France which does much to explain both his political role and his political pretensions. Since his parents married between 18 December 1275 and 18 January 1276, and he was still a minor in 1297, he was probably born <i>c</i>.1278.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Under Edward I, Thomas's place in the royal family brought him rapid promotion. He first appears in 1290, when plans were being made for his marriage to B&eacute;atrice, daughter of Hugues, son of the duke of Burgundy. But these fell through, and in 1294, by the autumn of that year, he had married <a href="#cosubject_54461">Alice [<i>see below</i>]</a>, daughter and heir of Henry de Lacy, earl of Lincoln, securing part of the Lacy inheritance with the promise of the remainder on Lacy's death. It was thanks to the king that the marriage settlement excluded collateral heirs to the two Lacy earldoms of Lincoln and Salisbury, to Lancaster's advantage, and, a little later, that his own earldom of Derby was successfully defended against the claims of the disinherited John de Ferrers. Towards the end of the reign he also received numerous minor gifts from Edward and, in 1307, the valuable franchise of return of writs. In return he gave loyal service to his uncle and benefactor. He first served on the Falkirk campaign of 1297&#150;8 (in the course of which he was knighted), fought at Falkirk in 1298, was present at Caerlaverock in 1300, and accompanied Prince Edward to Perth in 1304&#150;5 and on campaign again in 1306&#150;7. The king's obvious fondness for his nephew may have owed something to the unmartial ways of his own son and heir. But this did not separate Lancaster from the prince, with whom he remained on friendly terms.<h2>
<a name="EdwardIIandGaveston13071312"></a>Edward II and Gaveston, 1307&#150;1312</h2>Although Edward II's accession in July 1307 rapidly led to the marshalling of baronial opposition to the new king, it marked no break in Lancaster's close relationship with his cousin. The political goodwill evident in the first few months of the reign, which allowed Edward to recall his favourite, Piers Gaveston, from exile and to secure a tax grant from parliament, was soon dissipated by the two issues which were to dominate Edward II's early years: the intolerable conduct of Gaveston, and the king's misgovernment, exemplified among much else by purveyance&#151;the forcible levying of foodstuffs to feed the royal household and armies. But Lancaster's alignment with the king's opponents on these issues was by no means immediate, and for the first eighteen months of the new reign he enjoyed Edward's favour and company. He was with him in the north in the weeks following the old king's death, travelled south with him after Edward's cancellation of the current Scottish campaign, dined with him fairly frequently, and benefited from numerous royal grants. Of these, the grant of the stewardship of England, made to Lancaster and his heirs in the summer of 1308, was the most important and the most portentous. Unlike his father-in-law, Henry de Lacy, he had no part in the Boulogne declaration of January 1308, which complained about &#145;the oppressions &hellip; committed against the people&#146;  (Phillips, 316), nor in the exiling of Gaveston, which followed in the summer. It was only in the winter of 1308&#150;9, as the other earls made their peace with the king in the gratifying absence of Gaveston, that Lancaster began to move in the opposite direction. There was no dramatic break with Edward, nor are the causes of their separation at all clear. But from November 1308 he ceased to witness royal charters, the flow of favours to him dried up, and he moved north to his own estates.<br>
<br>By the spring of 1309 Lancaster's alienation was beginning to be transformed into a more positive support for reform. In March or April he was present with a very large retinue, and in company with some of the other earls, at a tournament at Dunstable. There, complaints may have been formulated about purveyance, judicial malpractices, and other abuses, which were subsequently petitioned against in the April parliament. Redress was offered in the <span class="roman">Statute of Stamford</span>, drawn up at the Stamford parliament in July, which was the price paid by Edward for Gaveston's recall in June. Although Lancaster had previously shown the favourite no hostility, he opposed his return, unlike most of the other earls; indeed, one chronicle reports that he became the &#145;captain&#146; of the dissenters. For reform, and against the king's friend, he had thus begun to identify with both the main lines of opposition to Edward.<br>
<br>These now began to converge. The opprobrious behaviour of Gaveston after his return (Lancaster's nickname of &#145;Churl&#146; was one of several which the favourite is said to have coined for the earls about this time), together with the military successes of the Scots and the emergence of purveyance as the overriding grievance against Edward's government, all combined to generate a virtually united demand for reform. Lancaster became its spokesman. In the parliament which opened in February 1310 he presented a petition of grievances to the king, and in March Edward agreed to appoint <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50153/', "lords ordainer")</script> to reform the realm. The work of the twenty-one men subsequently elected bore fruit with the publication of the ordinances in August 1311 and of a second, supplementary, set, mainly directed at the royal household, in November. For most of the intervening period Edward was campaigning in the north, mainly to keep Gaveston out of harm's way. The ordaining earls, including Lancaster, refused to serve there. But it was the death of Henry de Lacy in February 1311, rather than politics, which most directly affected Lancaster at this time, for it brought him two new earldoms, an overwhelmingly dominant position among the landed aristocracy, and perhaps a reinforcement of his emerging leadership. He and the earl of Warwick, both among the more intransigent reformers, are said to have presented the second ordinances to the king, and one chronicle even spoke of &#145;the ordinances of the earl of Lancaster&#146;. For the remainder of his life his adherence to these reforms was to remain his chief principle of action.<br>
<br>The ordinances were in the first place a means to good government. They sought to strengthen the king's finances, to answer the complaints which, on matters such as purveyance, had often arisen from financial weakness, and to prevent future abuses by demanding &#145;the consent of the baronage in parliament&#146; for a wide range of royal initiatives  (<span class="italic">Statutes of the Realm</span>, 1.158&#150;60). In all this they represented both a set of restraints on Edward's kingship and a popular programme, &#145;a remedy for the poor and oppressed&#146;, as the bishops termed them  (<span class="italic">Councils and Synods</span>, 2/2.1369); though the programme was one which could not be enforced without the conciliar checks which the ordainers had failed to put in place. But the ordinances were also an indictment of Gaveston, whose activities were seen to epitomize the disregard for law and custom which lay at the heart of Edward's misrule. They therefore called once again for the favourite's exile; yet events were to show that, with Gaveston out of the way, the opposition would disintegrate. The negative principle of common hostility to a favourite that the ordinances embodied counted for more than their positive call for reform.<br>
<br>In deference to the ordinances Gaveston went abroad in October 1311, but, in their defiance, he was back in England again by Christmas. At York, in January 1312, the king revoked the ordinances and restored the favourite to full power. After Gaveston had been excommunicated by Archbishop Robert Winchelsey, the leading ecclesiastical ordainer, Lancaster took the initiative in the baronial reaction which followed. He demanded from the king Gaveston's surrender and renewed exile, and when these demands were predictably ignored he and other magnates moved north in pursuit of the royal party. In early May Gaveston was captured in Scarborough Castle, after having allowed himself to become separated from Edward. A truce was then made, whose favourable terms for the prisoner probably owed much to some arrangement between the earl of Pembroke, a moderate among the ordainers, and the king. Gaveston was travelling south in Pembroke's charge to meet Edward when he was seized at Deddington in Oxfordshire by the earl of Warwick, Lancaster's close partner. He was led off to Warwick, &#145;tried&#146; before a court in which Lancaster and Warwick were the chief judges and the exile of Gaveston decreed in the ordinances the main point of law, and then executed, on 19 June 1312, on Lancaster's land near Kenilworth. Lancaster had thus been the initiator of Gaveston's prosecution and a chief party to his quasi-judicial murder&#151;a role which demonstrated his detestation of Gaveston, his regard for the ordinances, and his willingness to use violence against the one and in defence of the other.<h2>
<a name="Thebreakupofthebaronialcoalition13121314"></a>The break-up of the baronial coalition, 1312&#150;1314</h2>Gaveston's death permanently alienated Edward from Lancaster and divided the ordainers; for in its wake Pembroke and Earl Warenne, both among the more conciliatory reformers, were drawn back towards the king. Lancaster's position was more fortuitously weakened in May 1313 by the death of his ally, Archbishop Winchelsey, after which clerical backing for the ordinances was largely withdrawn. Yet he retained considerable bargaining power, thanks to his possession of the extremely valuable jewels and horses captured during Gaveston's pursuit in the north. It was in the interests of Lancaster to present the jewels as illicitly taken from the royal treasury by Gaveston, though in fact they are more likely to have been entrusted to him in his official role as royal chamberlain. After a period in July 1312 when civil war was very close, negotiations began in September for the transfer of the king's goods. Lancaster and his followers wanted a pardon, the maintenance of the ordinances, and the condemnation of Gaveston&#151;which would have amounted to the ordinances' endorsement&#151;as &#145;the enemy of the king and the realm&#146;  (Stubbs, 211); the king wanted the return of the jewels and military aid against the resurgent Scots. Eventually, in February 1313, the jewels were returned, and the barons pardoned in October, though without Edward's recognition, either explicit or implicit, of the ordinances. Lancaster remained on his estates for most of this time, conducting negotiations through intermediaries, and the final royally inclined compromise reflected his own shortcomings as a leader. Possessing a programme, he lacked not only the means but also the will to enforce it.<br>
<br>But Edward's feeble victory did nothing to solve his real problems, which lay in Scotland. The Scots' siege of Stirling from the summer of 1313, and the fall of other English-held castles, had committed the king to a northern campaign in 1314. Writs for the summoning of an army were issued in December 1313, but Lancaster and three other earls&#151;Warwick, Arundel, and Warenne&#151;refused to serve, arguing that the summons had not been decided on in parliament, as the ordinances decreed. This legalistic point covered both a deeper sense of disgruntlement with Edward's government and also the concealed but continuing tensions resulting from Gaveston's death. Three other ordaining earls&#151;Pembroke, Gloucester, and Hereford&#151;all joined Edward's army, highlighting Lancaster's increasingly isolated position as the ordinances' defender. But his isolation at least meant that he was not directly associated with the greatest English military disaster of the middle ages, which occurred when Edward II was defeated by Robert I at Bannockburn in June 1314.<h2>
<a name="Governmentandthecourt13141318"></a>Government and the court, 1314&#150;1318</h2>Edward's humiliation at Bannockburn was interpreted as a divine judgment in favour of the ordinances. The battle forced Edward into immediate dependence on Lancaster, and during the next two years his leading role in government, for the first and last time, gave him the chance to implement all that he stood for. Yet his position perhaps owed as much to his lands, wealth, and following as to the apparently providential vindication of his programme seen in the victory of the Scots. &#145;By the size of his patrimony&#146;, says the <span class="italic">Vita Edwardi secundi</span>, &#145;you may assess his power.&#146; His actual patrimony, consisting of the three earldoms of Lancaster, Leicester, and Derby, lay largely in Lancashire, in Leicestershire and Warwickshire (centred on Kenilworth Castle), and in Staffordshire and Derbyshire (centred on Tutbury Castle), with an outlying castle and estate at Dunstanburgh, in Northumberland. To these were added, on Henry de Lacy's death, the two earldoms of Lincoln and Salisbury, and extensive new lands in Yorkshire, Lancashire, Lincolnshire, and north Wales. Among the Yorkshire holdings was the castle of Pontefract, which was to become Lancaster's favourite residence.<br>
<br>The significance of these estates lay partly in their contiguity. Stretching as they did across south Lancashire, south Yorkshire, and the north midlands, they gave Lancaster lordship over a wide swathe of territory which spanned almost the breadth of England. But, of course, it was their profitability that mattered most. Their total value was probably about &pound;11,000 a year, of which about &pound;6500&#151;considerably more than half&#151;came from the Lacy inheritance. An income of this size made Lancaster by some way the richest of the earls and enabled him to build up the retinue on which his power came partly to depend. His following, like his estate, was abnormally large. At its maximum, in the middle years of the reign, it contained about fifty knights; but, since many of these commanded sub-retinues of their own, and since Lancaster could also array troops directly from his lands, the total military force at his command was much greater than this. Attracted by Lancaster's wealth and by the generous fees that he was able to offer, its leading members were spread across the area of his own landed dominance. As he drifted into political isolation, and even without a party behind him, his retinue made him a force to be reckoned with.<br>
<br>It was Lancaster's misfortune that power became available to him at a time when its constructive use was peculiarly difficult. After Bannockburn the north lay open to Scottish attack, and Edward's financial problems, compounded by the ruinous famine of 1315&#150;17, hindered any attempt at effective defence, or indeed at effective government. These were years of national demoralization. Lancaster's remedy, predictably, was the full enforcement of the ordinances. It was a sign of the turnaround in his political fortunes that these were confirmed by the king both at the York parliament of September 1314, the first after the battle, and at the Westminster parliament of January 1315. Then followed a purge of the royal household, the resumption of royal grants, and a wholesale change of sheriffs: all measures envisaged in the ordinances, closely associated with Lancaster, and largely designed to put the king's finances on a sound footing. If Lancaster's policies here were a means to the more effective prosecution of the Scots, he was also personally involved throughout 1315 in the formulation and execution of policy towards Scotland, taking steps to finance the keeping of the north and to consult the northern clergy and magnates to this end. In August, when Carlisle was under siege, he was appointed as &#145;superior captain&#146; of the king's northern forces, and in October he was planning a large expedition to the north: a plan thwarted by the famine's depletion of the country's military resources and by a revolt on his own estates, led by his former retainer, Adam Banaster. He thus had a central role in the country's government and defence. Yet it was one qualified by his own separation from the king, both geographically (he retired from Westminster in the spring of 1315) and emotionally (for the death of Gaveston still came sharply between them). Pembroke remained Edward's more trusted confidant, and Lancaster the never quite dominant outsider.<h2>
<a name="Chiefcouncillorandrelationswiththeking"></a>Chief councillor, and relations with the king</h2>Formal domination Lancaster did eventually achieve, for at the Lincoln parliament of January 1316 he was appointed as the king's chief councillor. He accepted his new role in the hope that reform might continue, but he reserved his right to withdraw if Edward refused to follow his and the council's advice. His unwillingness to commit himself here was of a piece with his continuing reluctance to reside at Westminster: from April onwards he was once again on his own north midland estates. Yet he remained the champion of the ordinances. A new committee, which included Lancaster, was set up to reform the royal household, the ordinances themselves were republished in the counties in March, and a further resumption of royal grants followed in April. He continued, too, to be consulted about Scottish affairs and he was associated with Edward's plans for a new Scottish campaign in the summer of 1316. But his relationship with the king was heading for disruption. At York in August 1316 they quarrelled violently, particularly over the king's unwillingness to enforce the ordinances, and in November their differences were exacerbated by the triumph of the queen's candidate over Lancaster's in the election to the see of Durham. The almost simultaneous appointment of the earl of Arundel as captain of the northern forces, after the campaign's cancellation in October, marked Lancaster's supersession, in the king's counsels as much as in the north.<h2>
<a name="Politicalisolation"></a>Political isolation</h2>Lancaster was now politically isolated. The earl of Warwick, his partner in the prosecution of Gaveston, had died in August 1315, and the other earls were close to the king. From this point onwards, for nearly two years, he was to remain an external critic of Edward's government, a one-man opposition whose political leverage lay almost solely in his wealth and following. His refusal to attend meetings of the council&#151;at Clarendon in February 1317, at Westminster in April, and at Nottingham in July&#151;was symptomatic of an increasingly deep alienation from Edward's regime. It was rooted in personal and constitutional grievances, both deriving primarily from the composition of the court. The years 1316&#150;17 saw the rise of a powerful court party, headed by five barons&#151;the two Hugh Despensers, father and son, Hugh Audley the younger, Roger Damory, and William Montagu. Three of the five&#151;the younger Despenser, Audley, and Damory&#151;had founded their fortunes on marriage to the sisters and coheirs of the earl of Gloucester, killed at Bannockburn. But all had grown rich on royal patronage and stood to lose from the enforcement of the ordinances, whose demand for a resumption of past royal grants and the consent of the baronage in parliament to future ones would have left them dispossessed. It was in their interests as well as his own that Edward, in December 1316, unsuccessfully sought to overthrow the ordinances by seeking papal absolution from his oath to maintain them.<br>
<br>Lancaster's opposition to these men was partly one of political principles: their nourishment from the king's largess was an affront to the ordinances and a drain on the king's finances, in the desperately difficult economic and military circumstances created by the famine and the Scots. They were, too, at the centre of the small council meetings which Edward was using, in place of parliament and contrary to the ordinances, to determine military policy. But his hostility&#151;that of an &#145;out&#146; protesting against the favours enjoyed by the &#145;ins&#146;&#151;was also bitterly personal. More personal still was his opposition to Earl Warenne, a figure on the fringes of the court, who had abducted his wife, supposedly with the support of the other courtiers, in April 1317 (see below). But Lancaster's particular objections to the court and to Edward's methods of government, voiced in a letter which he wrote to the king about July 1317, had no means of making their mark; especially since even the more moderate of Edward's friends, including former ordainers such as Pembroke and Hereford, had been retained by the king on generous terms. That was why he now began to take the law into his own hands. In October 1317 he may have supported the attack by a Northumbrian freebooter, Sir Gilbert Middleton, on the new bishop of Durham, Louis Beaumont, and his brother Henry, an unpopular courtier whom the ordainers had sought to eject, as they made their way towards Durham for Louis's consecration. At any rate, several of those in Middleton's gang are found in Lancaster's service shortly afterwards. More certainly, about the same time he used his retinue to seize castles held by Damory and Warenne. But he also called in the Scots, both against the Beaumonts and against Damory, so qualifying his claim to be taking a stand on principle. To ally with the kingdom's enemies in order to purge the court suggested a peculiar sense of priorities.<br>
<br>Despite these antagonisms, there were good reasons for Edward and his friends to seek a reconciliation with Lancaster. The size of his following, a matter for public comment and criticism in 1317, added another element of instability to an already dangerously unstable political situation; the attacks on the courtiers had shown how the retinue could be used to forward by violence ends unattainable by other means; while the continuing successes of the Scots, who in the spring and summer of 1318 advanced as far as south Yorkshire, made it imperative to secure the military support of Lancaster and his private army. So it was that from November 1317 attempts began to be made to bring Lancaster and Edward together, largely through the mediation of Pembroke, Hereford, the Kentish baron Bartholomew Badlesmere, and, especially, of the bishops. Pembroke and Badlesmere had already promoted Lancaster's arguments by securing the consent of the avaricious Damory to restraints on Edward's patronage. Aired more generally, however, this issue was to prove an almost intractable stumbling-block in the negotiations with Lancaster which followed. The two sides were far apart. Lancaster wanted the full observance of the ordinances, the removal of the king's &#145;evil counsellors&#146;, their trial in parliament for wrongfully receiving the king's grants, and an immediate resumption of those grants. All this was anathema to the courtiers, who stood to lose everything from Lancaster's demands. The negotiations swayed backwards and forwards, but eventually bore fruit in a treaty made at Leake, in Staffordshire, in August 1318. It marked the measure of Lancaster's defeat. A new standing council was to be set up; but on it Lancaster was represented only by a banneret. The ordinances were to be maintained; but the guarantors for their maintenance included some of the leading courtiers. About the resumption of royal grants and the removal of evil councillors nothing whatever was said.<br>
<br>Following the treaty of Leake, at the York parliament of October and November, a limited resumption and a limited reform of the royal household were both put in hand. But there was otherwise little movement in Lancaster's direction. Why had he conceded so much? The answer almost certainly lies in the private inducements offered to him by the king and the court to modify his demands. In November some of the leading courtiers acknowledged large debts to him, and these payments are likely to have been the price of peace. More remarkably, in the same month he came to terms with his wife's abductor, Earl Warenne, in a coercive settlement which gave him all Warenne's lands in Yorkshire and north Wales, and which was almost certainly connived at by Edward and his friends. The position of the chief courtiers had been preserved, their chief opponent satisfied, and Warenne abandoned, along with Lancaster's principles.<h2>
<a name="Theriseandfallofapartyleader13191322"></a>The rise and fall of a party leader, 1319&#150;1322</h2>In conciliating Lancaster, Edward's mediators had sought to make possible the united campaign against the Scots which was eventually launched in 1319. It was planned at the York parliament of May 1319, where Lancaster was present in a newly co-operative mood. As steward of England, he there petitioned for the right to appoint the steward of the royal household, which would have given him the power to regulate household expenditure: a prime reforming objective. To judge by the tract on the steward's office, probably drawn up under his auspices in 1321, he intended to go further and to ground on the stewardship a wider claim to a general supervisory role in government. That these claims went unrecognized, however, did not prevent his participation in the new campaign, with a very large force, though it was a mark of his continuing wish for independence that his men apparently took no pay from the king, leaving their leader free from the contractual disciplines and obligations that pay would have implied.<br>
<br>Despite Lancaster's service the campaign of 1319 was a disaster. In September the English army laid siege to Berwick, but its leaders immediately fell to quarrelling. Edward's foolish promise of patronage to the younger Despenser and to Damory, once the town had been taken, alienated Lancaster, who withdrew his troops when it became known that the Scots had slipped past the besiegers and were devastating Yorkshire. Lancaster himself was rumoured, almost certainly unjustly on this occasion, to be in collusion with the Scots, with whom a truce had to be made in December, after the renewal of border raids. All the old divisions were reopened. Lancaster refused to attend a parliament at York in January 1320, and the growing strength of the courtiers, who were once again receiving generous grants from Edward, seemed to herald a return to the politics of 1316&#150;18. In the spring of 1320 the success of a mission to the papal curia in obtaining Edward's absolution from his oath to the ordinances gave the king a degree of political emancipation which he had not known since 1311, though Pembroke's continuing influence at court seems to have nullified the effects of Edward's new-found freedom. Lancaster meanwhile remained in the north, at Pontefract, once again in isolation.<br>
<br>What drew Lancaster back to the political stage was the radical realignment of forces brought about by the rise of the Despensers to supremacy at court and the consequent breakup of the old court party. During 1319 the two Despensers had come to dominate the court, controlling access to the king, monopolizing his ear, and directing the royal household. Their hold over Edward gave full play to their territorial ambitions, notably in south Wales, where the younger Despenser's share of the Clare inheritance was greatly enlarged in the last months of 1320 by the illicit take-over of Gower and other lands. This challenged the interests of the remaining marcher lords, among whom were some of the other leading members of the court, including Hereford (who also had a claim to Gower), Damory, and Audley. Hereford took the lead in resisting, and in February 1321 appealed to the one magnate with both the power and the motive to counter the Despensers: Thomas of Lancaster. Their alliance was probably sealed in a meeting between them at Pontefract. In April disturbances broke out in the marches; and in May, after Hereford's request to the king for the removal of the younger Despenser from court and his temporary surrender to Lancaster had been refused, the barons began the systematic devastation of the lands of the Despensers and their allies.<br>
<br>Although Lancaster was clearly regarded as the barons' leader, he took no part in the ravaging of the Despensers' lands. He may have found some difficulty in weighing in on the side of men such as Damory who had formerly been his enemies, while he was also violently at odds with another renegade courtier, Bartholomew Badlesmere, perhaps because Badlesmere's appointment as steward of the household in 1318 usurped a position which Lancaster regarded as within his gift. His role at this stage, therefore, was a passive one, and confined to the organization of a coalition against the court. To this end he convened two meetings in the north in May and June 1321. At the first, held at Pontefract, he tried to secure the active backing of fifteen northern lords against the Despensers, but they were unwilling to do more than join with Lancaster in a league for their mutual defence. At the second, held at Sherburn in Elmet, a larger gathering assembled, in response to the request of the northerners and again under Lancaster's auspices. It included the northerners themselves, the marchers, and a substantial body of Lancastrian retainers, which outnumbered either of the other two parties. But in its main purpose the assembly was a failure. The northerners again refused to join up, and it was mainly Lancaster's own men who set their seals to an indenture of mutual alliance against the Despensers. Two other pieces of business came before the meeting. First, it was presented with a general bill of grievances, which, invoking the ordinances, enumerated both the complaints of the marchers and other more general instances of Edward's misgovernment. Second, an indictment was drafted against the Despensers, to be put before the parliament that had been summoned for July.<br>
<br>These northern meetings represented an attempt by Lancaster to extend the quarrel of the marchers and to build a great coalition against the Despensers. But the northerners were too circumspect to commit themselves to a cause that was not their own, perhaps particularly since Lancaster's own commitment was more a matter of theory than practice. After the meeting he remained at Pontefract, while his marcher allies moved south, continuing to devastate the Despenser lands before they finally entered London at the start of August. With civil war near, and Pembroke pressing Edward to yield, the king rapidly conceded the Despensers' exile. But this was the most temporary of victories, for by Michaelmas the younger Despenser had once more rejoined the court.<h2>
<a name="Defeatandexecution"></a>Defeat and execution</h2>Edward was now well placed to take the offensive. The first move in his campaign came in October, when he laid siege to Badlesmere's castle at Leeds in Kent, on the pretext that the queen had been refused entry there. The marchers, in co-operation with Badlesmere, wished to raise the siege, but Lancaster forbade them to do so and, it seems, refused to receive the unfortunate Badlesmere when the marchers subsequently retreated to Pontefract. This willingness to elevate a private quarrel over a public cause was not the only mark of his deficiencies as a leader. They were shown, too, by the desertions from his retinue which began to multiply about this time, as men became conscious of the risks involved in what seemed likely to be an armed confrontation with the crown. Lancaster's awareness of his weakness here, and of the need to draw in more support, was indicated by a further northern meeting which he convened at Doncaster in November. To it he summoned not only the marchers and the northerners but also a large number of other men whose unimpeachable royalist record suggested how desperately wide he was now having to cast his net. The meeting produced a further petition against the Despensers, later sent to the king, and an appeal by Lancaster himself for the backing of the city of London. Shortly afterwards he sought help again from the Scots, this time going beyond the working partnership of 1317, to enter into a formal alliance with Robert I.<br>
<br>By this stage Edward was moving with an army towards the marches. He was foiled for a time in his attempts to cross the Severn and had to tolerate further attacks by his opponents on Despenser manors. But in late January he was able to reach the west bank of the Severn at Shrewsbury and to secure the surrender of a large party of marchers, to whom Lancaster had offered no active help. Others of the marchers under Hereford then withdrew to Lancaster at Pontefract. Lancaster meanwhile had laid siege to the royal castle at Tickhill, in Yorkshire, whose constable had been acting as Edward's spy. The siege brought a crucial change in Edward's strategy, for he promptly turned away from the marches and towards the north. Lancaster's forces were now falling apart, and there was a general reluctance to rally to a failing cause. On 10 March, weakened further by the treacherous desertion of Robert Holland, his chief henchman and recruiting officer, he was unable to prevent the royalists crossing the Trent at Burton. Retreating northwards, probably towards his castle at Dunstanburgh, Lancaster and his small army were intercepted on the River Aire at Boroughbridge on 16 March. In the battle which followed Lancaster was captured, and on 22 March 1322, after what amounted to a show trial, he was executed at Pontefract.<h2>
<a name="Cultandcharacter"></a>Cult and character</h2>Like Simon de Montfort, whose lands he inherited and whose career superficially resembles his own, Thomas of Lancaster came to be regarded as a saint. Within six weeks of his death miracles were reported from his tomb at Pontefract and an armed guard was sent by the king to close the church where his body lay. In 1323 there were riots as crowds of people tried to gain access to the place of his execution to pray and make offerings. In 1327, after Edward II's deposition, the Commons asked the new king to press for his canonization; and, even after the political circumstances which had given rise to the cult had passed into history, popular veneration for Lancaster persisted. On the eve of the Reformation his hat and belt were still preserved at Pontefract as respective remedies for headaches and the dangers of childbirth.<br>
<br>A large part of this contemporary reputation derived from Edward II's vices rather than Lancaster's virtues. As Edward's rule degenerated, first into misgovernment by the Despensers before 1322, and then into something approaching tyranny, any leader dying in opposition to the regime might have expected popular acclaim. Yet there was more than this to Lancaster's fame. From 1311 onwards he had consistently identified himself with the ordinances, though not above all else: he gave priority to private profit at the treaty of Leake in 1318 and to personal antagonism towards the Despensers in his last years. In placing the ordinances at the centre of his political life, with whatever qualifications, he came to stand, not just for constitutional restraints on the crown and its patronage, but for the redress of popular grievances and the reform of widespread abuses. On matters such as purveyance and the malpractices of royal justice, the ordinances had offered relief, not primarily to barons, but to the politically unimportant. Much of the vigour of his cult lay here.<br>
<br>In many ways, however, Lancaster was an unconvincing and unaccomplished idealist. A harsh landlord, much petitioned against for his breaches of law and equity, and quick to resort to violence, he was not a man to inspire either affection or loyalty. His childless wife left him in 1317, the northerners failed to respond to his call in 1321, and even his retinue mostly broke and ran in the months before Boroughbridge. Although he partnered Archbishop Winchelsey in captaining the ordainers, in general he lacked the backing of the bishops and schoolmen which had given justice and reflected glory to Simon de Montfort's cause. This was as much a failure of political leadership as of personality. For most of his career he remained an outsider in politics, apparently by his own choice, preferring residence in his northern castles to the king's company at Westminster. In so doing he maintained his integrity at the expense of his influence, relying for his political weight more on his estates and manpower than to any engagement with government. When he turned to the Scots for help in 1317 and 1322, or disdained to receive Bartholomew Badlesmere in his final months, he showed that he lacked political judgement. Man of principle though he was, it was not only the intensely difficult circumstances of his career which set limits to his political effectiveness, but also, and perhaps primarily, his own inadequacies.<h2>
<a name="AliceLacy"></a>Alice Lacy</h2>The abduction of Lancaster's wife, <a name="cosubject_54461"></a><span class="headword">Alice Lacy</span>, <i>suo jure</i> countess of Lincoln, and countess of Lancaster and Leicester  (1281&#150;1348)<span class="occ"></span>, by Earl Warenne was only one episode in what was an adventurous career. Probably born at her father's castle of Denbigh, Alice played no discernible part in Thomas of Lancaster's life and, like many medieval women, came into her own only after her husband's death. According to the Meaux chronicle, her abduction by Warenne was carried through, not from lust, but merely to spite her husband, who had stood with the royal council in 1314 in attempting to prevent Warenne from divorcing his wife, Joan de Bar, in order to marry his mistress, Maud Nerford. Alice's separation from Lancaster, however, did not protect her from the consequences of his death in opposition to the king in 1322. After his fall both she and her mother were imprisoned at York. There Alice was threatened with burning by the two Hugh Despensers, father and son&#151;a characteristic instance of their casual brutality&#151;until she surrendered to their will. She lost her great inherited lordship of Denbigh (which she never regained) and most of her other estates, but she was allowed to keep her title of countess of Salisbury and Lincoln, together with a life interest in lands worth 500 marks.<br>
<br>Alice's brief fling with Warenne (if such it was) led to no lasting liaison, and by November 1324, after her release from prison, she had taken as her second husband Ebulo Lestrange of Knockin, in Shropshire, a minor baron of the Welsh marches. He had formerly sided with Lancaster in the pursuit of Gaveston, though there appears to have been no regular connection. The marriage was a sign that she had salvaged enough from the wreck of her first husband's career&#151;including the custody of Lincoln Castle and &pound;20 from the earl's third penny in the county&#151;to make her an attractive match. His wife's property served to shift Lestrange's main interest to Lincolnshire, though he spent a large part of his later career campaigning in Scotland, where he died in September 1335. Alice was one of his executors.<br>
<br>Alice did not remain husbandless for long. At the end of 1335 or the beginning of 1336 she was abducted from her ancestral castle of Bolingbroke in Lincolnshire, probably with her own connivance and despite having taken a vow of chastity in her widowhood, by Sir Hugh de Freyne, a Herefordshire knight, royal keeper of the castle and town of Cardigan, and steward of Cardiganshire since 1330. After facing down Edward III's brief anger (and orders for their imprisonment), the couple made their peace with the king and were married early in 1336. His new wife's title and lands brought Freyne a personal summons to parliament for the first and last time in November 1336. He died shortly afterwards, in December 1336 or January 1337, at Perth. Alice did not marry again and died childless in October 1348, aged sixty-six. She was buried at the side of her second husband at the Premonstratensian house of Barlings, in Lincolnshire. Her many manors and lordships, most of which she had gathered together again after the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle of Boroughbridge, fell to the house of Lancaster, under the terms of the original marriage settlement made with her first husband some fifty-four years earlier.<br>
