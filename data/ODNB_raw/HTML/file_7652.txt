<span class="headword">Dillon,  Arthur</span>, Jacobite Earl Dillon  (1670&#150;1733), <span class="occ">Jacobite army officer and politician</span>, was born in co. Roscommon, the third, but second surviving, of six sons of Theobald, seventh Viscount Dillon of Costello-Gallen (<i>d</i>. 1691), of Loughglinn, co. Roscommon, and Mary (<i>d</i>. 1691), daughter of Sir Henry Talbot of Mount Talbot, co. Roscommon. His mother was a niece of the duke of Tyrconnell, and during the Williamite wars both his father and elder brother, Henry, served in the Irish army, the latter in command of an infantry regiment. His father was killed at the battle of Aughrim (1691), and his mother soon afterwards by an exploding bomb during the siege of Limerick. With his father and brothers, Arthur Dillon, a lifelong Roman Catholic, was outlawed by the Williamites; however Henry, eighth Viscount Dillon of Costello-Gallen, was pardoned and remained on the family estate in Ireland after the war.<br>
<br>In 1690 Arthur Dillon was chosen to go to France as colonel of a second Dillon regiment. This unit was newly raised to form part of Lord Mountcashel's brigade, a body of Irish troops exchanged for a French brigade sent by Louis XIV to Ireland. On disembarkation at Brest in May the Irish soldiers were reorganized into three infantry regiments and incorporated into the French army. Dillon's regiment, numerically weak on arrival, was brought up to two-battalion strength with reinforcements from two regiments which were disbanded, and he was confirmed as colonel on 1 June 1690. He served until 1697 in Catalonia under the duc de Noailles, participating in a number of engagements, including the taking of Roses (1693); the crossing of the River Ter and the capture of Palamos, Girona, and Hostalric (1694); the relief of Hostalric, during which he commanded the rearguard with great distinction (1695); and the capture of Barcelona by the duc de Vend&ocirc;me (1697). In the War of the Spanish Succession he served under Vend&ocirc;me in Italy in 1702&#150;6, where he participated in the battle of Luzzara (1702); the invasion of the Trentino, during which he won distinction at Riva, the victory of San Sebastiano, and the capture of Asti (1703); the capture of Vercelli and Ivrea (1704); the capture of Mirandola, the defence of Moscalino, and the victory at Cassano (1705); and the victories of Calcinato and Castiglione (1706). He was promoted brigadier on 1 October 1702, <i>mar&eacute;chal de camp</i> on 26 October 1704, and lieutenant-general on 24 September 1706. In 1707, under Marshal de Tess&eacute;, he played a role in the manoeuvres that compelled Prince Eugene to abandon the siege of Toulon. In 1709, while posted near Brian&ccedil;on under the duke of Berwick, he defeated two considerable bodies of the enemy in quick succession. Having transferred to the army of the Rhine, under Marshal de Villars, in 1713, he took Kaiserslautern and Verastein Castle, and was prominent in the reduction of Landau and Fribourg. His last campaign was in 1714, when he played a prominent role, under Berwick, in the capture of Barcelona. He was created <i>comte</i> in 1711 and received into the order of St Louis.<br>
<br>Although widely respected as a soldier of courage and ability, and popular with his troops, Dillon was given no further military appointment after 1715, evidently because the French regency government disapproved of his pro-Jacobite activities. The tension between the French government and the Jacobite exiles (during a rare period of Anglo-French harmony) is well illustrated by the collapse in 1722 of the Atterbury plot which, before Mar betrayed its aims, Dillon had helped to plan. He resigned the command of the Dillon regiment in favour of his eldest son in 1730. Throughout his long military career, although often in the thick of action, he was fortunate never to have received a serious wound, and was regarded as handsome in his appearance. Some time before 1701 he had married Christiana (Catherine) Sheldon (1684&#150;1757), a lady-in-waiting to Queen Mary of Modena. Described as &#145;a very good woman and much esteemed by everybody&#146;  (Fagan, 2.132), she was the daughter of Ralph Sheldon, equerry to James II, and the niece of the Jacobite general Dominic Sheldon. Dillon was rumoured to have been an early lover of Claudine de Tencin, who later, as the lover of Viscount Bolingbroke, betrayed the Jacobite plans in 1715 to the French. Otherwise, apart from occasional amours while on campaign, he was considered a fond husband and an attached father to his family of ten children.<br>
<br>Dillon played a leading role in Jacobite politics. He was active in the preparations for the attempted rising in Scotland in 1715 and was mentioned as a suitable leader of a parallel expedition to Ireland, which was also under consideration at the time. From 1717 to 1725 he acted as ambassador in Paris for James III (James Francis Edward Stuart). He was given the title of Viscount Dillon by James in 1717, and of earl on 24 June 1721. He recommended Charles Wogan to James to assist in his search for a bride, an introduction which ultimately resulted in the Pretender's marriage to Clementina Sobieska. In 1717 he negotiated with Sweden to raise troops and, as part of the Atterbury plot, was charged with leading forces from France to assist in the proposed London rising. He died on 5 February 1733 at the ch&acirc;teau of St Germain-en-Laye, where he had an apartment. Soon after his death, at the request of James III, his widow lodged his papers in the Scots College at Paris, where they were destroyed during the French Revolution. His widow entered a Paris convent in 1750, where she died and was buried in 1757. Four of his sons, Charles (1701&#150;1741), Henry (<i>d</i>. 1787), James, and Edward, commanded the Dillon regiment in succession. Charles and Henry succeeded as tenth and eleventh viscounts Dillon of Costello-Gallen following the death of the ninth viscount, Arthur Dillon's nephew. Both Charles and Henry returned to live in Ireland. A fifth son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7654/', "Arthur Richard Dillon (1721&#150;1806)")</script>, was ordained a priest and became archbishop of Narbonne and president of the states of Languedoc. Two of Dillon's daughters, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1758) and Frances, entered the Carmelite convent at Pontoise. A third, Marie-Elizabeth, did not marry. Brigitte married Baron Blaisel, a French general, and Laure (1708&#150;1741) married the Jacobite exile Lucius Cary, sixth Viscount Falkland. A grandson, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7653/', "Lieutenant-General Arthur Dillon (1750&#150;1794)")</script>, the last colonel-proprietor of the Dillon regiment in France, was guillotined in 1794 during the revolution.<br>
