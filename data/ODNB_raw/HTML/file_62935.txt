<span class="headword">&Oacute; Criomhthain,  Tom&aacute;s Dh&oacute;naill</span> <span class="st"> [Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Crohan]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1855, <em>d.</em> 1937), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on the Great Blasket Island, co. Kerry, Ireland, and baptized there on 29 April 1855, the youngest of the eight children of D&oacute;nal Mac Criomhthain (<i>bap</i>. 1808) and C&aacute;it N&iacute; Sh&eacute;, who were married on 26 January 1837. The Great Blasket Island (An Blascaod M&oacute;r)&#151;a narrow island about 5 kilometres long and 1 kilometre wide&#151;is the largest of the seven islands in the Blasket archipelago and lies off the south-west coast of Ireland in co. Kerry. At the east of the island and closest to the mainland lie the remains of the island village where Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Criomhthain was born and lived out his life. The Irish-speaking island community never exceeded 200 inhabitants, and the community depended for its livelihood on the sea.<br>
<br>Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Criomhthain attended the Roman Catholic national primary school on Great Blasket Island from 1864, when the school was first opened, to some time in 1876, when he may have served as a &#145;monitor&#146; for a short period. The standard of teaching was generally poor and the entire curriculum was in English, a language which was not generally understood by the island community. Although the islanders were predominantly Roman Catholic, a number of them were adherents to the Church of Ireland and there had been a Church of Ireland missionary school on the island between 1839 and 1863 where the language of instruction was Irish. With the revival of the language movement within Ireland and the Anglo-Irish literary movement, for a time the Blasket Islands became a centre for those wishing to study the Irish language. John Millington Synge came to the Great Blasket in 1905, and his account of island life, <span class="italic">In West Kerry</span> (1907), generated further interest. The first prominent scholar visitor was Carl Marstrander of the University of Oslo, who came to the island in 1907 and befriended Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Criomhthain, who in turn became his mentor in Irish and island lore. Marstrander recommended the island to Robin Flower of the British Museum, who was completing a catalogue of the museum's extensive collection of medieval manuscripts in the Irish language. Flower first came to the island in 1910 and remained a constant visitor until his death. He became a close friend of &Oacute; Criomhthain and worked with him in his collection of island material, much of which was narrative recording of Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Criomhthain's own accounts of island life. Flower's book on the island culture, <span class="italic">The Western Island</span> (1944), opened the Great Blasket to a wider audience when the material was given as a series of lectures at the Lowell Institute in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1935.<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the scholars' attention which &Oacute; Criomhthain enjoyed, he had set himself to write and began in the first instance from 1908 with accounts of island life for Irish language periodicals. How a fisherman from the Blasket Islands became literate in his own language at a time when reading and writing in the Irish language were not widespread remains intriguing. Certainly the scholar visitors brought Irish language literacy skills to the island, but Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Criomhthain was able to read the visitors' texts with them. &Oacute; Criomhthain in his own accounts tells of his learning to read and write Irish from schoolchildren on the mainland when he was storm-bound as an adult. The origins of his literacy in Irish are more likely to derive from the legacy of the protestant missionary school on the island. It was not, however, the visiting scholars who played the vital role in persuading Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Criomhthain to write his insider's view of island life. Brian &Oacute; Ceallaigh from Killarney (also known as Bryan Albert Kelly) came to the island in 1917 and established a supportive and intellectual friendship with &Oacute; Criomhthain; the two discussed literature and writers in other cultures. &Oacute; Ceallaigh introduced Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Criomhthain to the works of Maksim Gorky, Pierre Loti, and Boccaccio in translation. &Oacute; Ceallaigh persuaded &Oacute; Criomhthain to write his island journal <span class="italic">Allagar na hInise</span> and autobiography <span class="italic">An tOile&aacute;nach</span>; these texts were written on sheaves of foolscap provided by &Oacute; Ceallaigh and were sent to him by post. &Oacute; Ceallaigh tried to have the texts published but finally deposited them with an Irish language scholar, author, and publisher, P&aacute;draig &Oacute; Siochfhradha, who edited them for publication. &Oacute; Criomhthain's two books <span class="italic">Allagar na hInise</span> (1928) (published in translation by T. Enright as <span class="italic">Island Cross Talk</span>, 1986) and <span class="italic">An tOile&aacute;nach</span> (1929) (published in translation by R. Flower as <span class="italic">The Islandman</span>, 1937) mark a unique chapter in the canon of Irish literature. As both were written from within the island culture, &Oacute; Criomhthain's voyage was into uncharted seas; there were no exemplars for his work in the then emerging and tentative literary movement in modern Irish.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Allagar na hInise</span> (<span class="italic">Island Cross Talk</span>) is essentially a book of sketches written by &Oacute; Criomhthain between 1918 and 1923. The book is constructed for the most part into sequences, which contain conversations and events which engaged the writer. What emerges is a powerful series of images constructed around his neighbours on the island and his mobilization of their characters and speech habits. Taken together the portraiture is a very vivid series of notes on the community which hang together well as a portfolio of everyday island life. <span class="italic">An tOile&aacute;nach</span> (<span class="italic">The Islandman</span>), written between 1923 and 1928, is an autobiography ranging from the nineteenth-century childhood memories of Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Criomhthain to the second decade of the twentieth century. The time frame is frequently set from events which had an impact on the island community. What he achieves in his camera sweep is an insider's view made accessible to the outsider: an inscape. The style is taut, but within its compass the writer copes with personal matters such as his first love for a girl from the neighbouring island of Inis Ic&iacute;le&aacute;in, and of his hard life after marriage to another woman, M&aacute;ire N&iacute; Chath&aacute;in (<i>bap</i>. 1859), on 5 February 1878. His account of island life is perhaps best summarized by his stated and rather stern aim in writing the book in the ultimate chapter:<blockquote>I have written minutely of much that we did, for it was my wish that somewhere there should be a memorial of it all, and I have done my best to set down the character of the people around me so that some record of us might live after us, for the like of us will never be again. (trans. R. Flower)</blockquote>Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Criomhthain died on 7 March 1937 on the Great Blasket Island, and was buried on the mainland at D&uacute;n Chaoin in the churchyard of Baile An Teampaill facing across to the Blasket Islands. His descendants carried on his literary legacy. He was followed as a writer by his son Se&aacute;n, his grandson P&aacute;draig Ua Maoileoin (<i>b</i>. 1913), and his great-nephew Muiris &Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in (1904&#150;1950).<br>
