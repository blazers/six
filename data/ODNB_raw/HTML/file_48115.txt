<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1170<span class="mult">x</span>74), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was, like his brother Warin, probably the son of Robert Fitzgerald, whose service of eleven knights' fees King Stephen conferred in 1141 upon Geoffrey de Mandeville, earl of Essex (<i>d</i>. 1144), which suggests that the Fitzgeralds were already major landholders in Essex at that date. There is also good circumstantial evidence that these Essex Fitzgeralds were part of a wider family network that included the Fitzgeralds of Wales and Ireland, a major baronial family descended from Gerald of Windsor, constable of Pembroke (<i>d</i>. 1116). Shortly after his accession in 1154 Henry II granted or confirmed to Warin and Henry Fitzgerald a major portion of the honour of Eudo Dapifer (<i>d</i>. 1120), comprising more than fifty knights' fees in Essex, Kent, and East Anglia. Land to the value of at least a further &pound;74, at Sawbridgeworth, Herefordshire, and elsewhere, associated with the same honour of Eudo Dapifer, was held by Warin and later by Henry Fitzgerald as a mesne tenancy from the Mandevilles for the service of four knights. In addition, in 1154 the king granted Warin land to the value of &pound;34 in the manor of Sevenhampton, Wiltshire, henceforth to serve as a hereditary serjeanty linked to a newly created chamberlainship in the exchequer of receipt, and further land worth &pound;37 at Sparsholt and Cricklade on the Berkshire&#150;Wiltshire border. Warin Fitzgerald first appears together with his brother Henry as witness to the foundation charter of Walden Abbey issued by Geoffrey de Mandeville some time between 1139 and 1144, and from at least 1147 occurs as a leading member of the household of the future king, Henry II. He is recorded in possession of the chamberlain serjeanty at Sevenhampton from at least 1155 until 1160, although his brother Henry appears to have succeeded to his lands at Sparsholt and Cricklade as early as 1157&#150;8. On his deathbed, at some time between 1157 and 1160, Warin bequeathed land worth &pound;6 at Sawbridgeworth to the monks of Bury St Edmunds where he chose to be buried.<br>
<br>Warin's lands and office passed to his brother Henry Fitzgerald, who had witnessed several charters of Henry, duke of Normandy, before the latter became king. In 1154 or 1155 Henry Fitzgerald was serving as the steward of Geoffrey de Mandeville, son of Earl Geoffrey, and between 1157 and 1160 was in receipt of &pound;50 a year from the royal manor of Sutton Courtenay, Berkshire. He continued in royal service from 1154 until his death, being active at the king's chamber as early as 1157&#150;8, appearing with the title chamberlain in the year 1159&#150;60, and in possession of the chamberlain serjeanty at Sevenhampton from 1160 onwards. He witnessed numerous royal charters in both England and France, and is said to have officiated as constable of Wallingford shortly after 1154. Between 1164 and 1171 he accounted as farmer for the royal manor of Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, and between 1166 and 1168, during the exile of Archbishop Becket, he acted as paymaster to the king's knights in Kent. In 1168&#150;9 he served as royal justice there, levying fines.<br>
<br>Fitzgerald was dead by the exchequer year 1173&#150;4, when his lands at Sevenhampton and Sparsholt were accounted to his son. He was buried at Reading Abbey, to which he had earlier granted land at Sawbridgeworth. He also granted an annual measure of corn to Southwark Priory and land to the monks of Rochester, for the soul of his brother Warin. With his wife, Matilda de Chesny, heir to a major estate in Oxfordshire and elsewhere, Henry had at least two sons; Warin Fitzgerald the younger (<i>c</i>.1167&#150;1215/16), a minor at the time of Henry's death, and Henry Fitzgerald the younger (<i>c</i>.1173&#150;<i>c</i>.1231) who entered the service of William (I) Marshal, earl of Pembroke (<i>d</i>. 1219). The Fitzgerald chamberlainship of the exchequer passed from Henry the elder to Warin Fitzgerald the younger, married to Alice de Courcy, a major heiress in England and Normandy. Warin, who was buried beside his father at Reading, was succeeded by a daughter named Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1252), married first to Baldwin de Revi&egrave;res and second to Falkes de Br&eacute;aut&eacute; (<i>d</i>. 1226). Her heir was her son Baldwin de Revi&egrave;res, earl of Devon. Thereafter the Fitzgerald chamberlainship descended to Baldwin's daughter Isabella, countess of Aumale (<i>d</i>. 1293), who conveyed it to her steward Adam of Stratton. Adam's lands and offices reverted to the crown following his disgrace in 1289.<br>
