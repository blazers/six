<span class="headword">Jolles,  Charlotte Alice Berta Eva</span>  (1909&#150;2003), <span class="occ">German scholar</span>, was born on 5 October 1909 in Berlin, Germany, the daughter of Leopold Jolles (<i>d</i>. 1938), engineer, and his wife, Katharina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Weihkopf. She attended school there from 1916 to 1929 and university from 1929 to 1936, studying German, history, philosophy, and educational theory. She first pursued her enduring interest in the development of democratic ideas in Germany through study of the 1848 revolution, in engagement with the political discussion of the day, and in her doctoral thesis on &#145;Fontane und die Politik&#146; (&#145;Fontane and politics&#146;). Her thesis was formally accepted in 1937, but publication in full was prevented by the new racist laws of the Third Reich, which categorized her as &#145;half Jewish&#146;, and because of its democratic political content.<br>
<br>Jolles arrived in London in January 1939 with a typewriter, ten marks, and a temporary residence permit. After working first with refugee children, who knew her as Jolli, she took up a full-time post teaching German at Watford Girls' Grammar School in 1948. After the war she became a British citizen and in 1946 resumed work on the German novelist Fontane, completing an MA thesis at Birkbeck College on &#145;Theodor Fontane and England&#146; (1947). In 1955 she was appointed lecturer at Birkbeck, and was promoted to professor in 1974. After retiring in 1977 she continued working vigorously in further fields of research.<br>
<br>Of particular note among Jolles's many distinguished Fontane publications were the volumes she edited for the Nymphenburg edition of the complete works: volume 17, <span class="italic">Aus England und Schottland</span> (1963), and volume 19, <span class="italic">Politik und Geschichte</span> (1969); the critical survey and bibliography <span class="italic">Theodor Fontane</span> (1974; 4th, revised, edn 1993), an indispensable source for Fontane specialists, and accessible guide to generations of students; the index of Fontane's letters (<span class="italic">Die Briefe Theodor Fontanes: Verzeichnis und Register</span>, 1988); and her edition of Fontane's English diaries (<span class="italic">Tageb&uuml;cher 1852, 1855&#150;58</span>, 1994). The most remarkable event in her publication history was the appearance in 1983 of <span class="italic">Fontane und die Politik</span>&#151;her 1936 dissertation which had survived as a single copy in Berlin University. Nearly fifty years on there was no need for revision, nor for any kind of apologia. The book, drawing in part on material destroyed during the war, examines Fontane's life and opinions in the 1840s and 1850s, including his visits to Britain. A second edition was published in 1988. Her last publication was the introduction to <span class="italic">Beyond the Tweed</span> (1998), an English edition of Fontane's travelogue of 1858. She made the journey from London across the Tweed herself, aged eighty-nine, to speak with her customary humour and unsentimental charm at its launch in the Glasgow Goethe Institute.<br>
<br>During the cold war she was a frequent visitor to the Fontane archive in Potsdam, then in the German Democratic Republic, moving freely both physically and intellectually as a connecting force between East and West, between Britain and Germany, between historical past and present, apparently equally at home in Berlin, Brandenburg, and London, in German literature and in English culture. In 1990, in the aftermath of German reunification, the Theodor Fontane Society was founded and Jolles became its honorary president, an office she filled well into her last years with gusto, practical insight, and vision. At the founding meeting in Potsdam her address enlivened the rather ponderous and tense proceedings by mischievously suggesting Frau Jenny Treibel (bourgeois parvenu and one of Fontane's least ideal characters) as patron of the society, because she stood for &#145;Geld und Poesie&#146; (money and poetry) and the society needed the first to support the second. Working constantly in the cause of Fontane, Jolles provided new ideas and fostered initiatives, not least at the Institute of Germanic Studies in London, where she was the moving spirit behind three Fontane conferences.<br>
<br>Jolles was awarded an honorary doctorate by her alma mater, now the Humboldt University, Berlin, in 1987, and in 1996 she received the Bundesverdienstkreuz, first class, at the German embassy in London. She has been honoured by Festschriften, but also less conventionally. In 1995 a fat package arrived at the door of her flat in Haverstock Hill&#151;not the proofs of one of her own books, but a copy of G&uuml;nter Grass's new novel <span class="italic">Ein weites Feld</span> (&#145;Too far afield&#146;), with a handwritten dedication from the author, whom she had never met. Fontane's life and works form multiple threads in the fabric of this fictional portrayal of Germany after reunification, and Charlotte Jolles features in its pages&#151;part Miss Marple, part mother confessor&#151;affectionately transposed into literary form, and playing a part, where she belonged, at the heart of German literary culture. But she also belonged in the heart of London, from where she did more for the study of Germany's greatest nineteenth-century novelist than anyone else in the twentieth century. Her influence was exercised not only in the usual academic channels: meticulous original research, editorial and bibliographical work, and literary criticism. Through her creative enthusiasm, vision, and personal warmth she enlisted commitment and released energies in generations of scholars in Britain, Germany, and beyond. She was not married, but had several godchildren and a large circle of friends in whose well-being she took a keen and supportive interest. She died on 31 December 2003 at the Royal Free Hospital, Camden, London, of cancer. Her Church of England funeral service, at Golders Green crematorium on 19 January 2004, was packed with mourners whose lives her humour, energy, and charm had touched.<br>
