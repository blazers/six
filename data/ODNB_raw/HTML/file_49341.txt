<span class="headword">Shepherd,  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1692&#150;1747), <span class="occ">building craftsman and architect</span>, played a major part in the development of west London in the first half of the eighteenth century. Nothing is known of his antecedents and early life before his marriage on 14 May 1710 to Elizabeth Hill in St Marylebone parish church. He had a brother, John, a plasterer, with whom he often worked and who was once castigated by the duke of Chandos for having been &#145;drunk from morning to night and never minded the workmen&#146;  (Baker, 370), another brother, Joseph, and a sister, Frances. His wife's brother, George Hill, was a carver in wood and stone, who also worked on several of Shepherd's buildings.<br>
<br>Shepherd apparently trained as a plasterer, and gave this as his trade in 1718 when he took building leases of house plots in the vicinity of Hanover Square. Thereafter he extended his speculative building activities to other major developments in west London, such as on the Cavendish-Harley estate to the north of Oxford Street and the Grosvenor, Berkeley, and Curzon estates in Mayfair.<br>
<br>In the meantime, his career seems to have benefited from an association with one of the richest men in the country, James Brydges, first duke of Chandos, who had been paymaster-general to Marlborough's army. Chandos used his great wealth in various building enterprises, including the erection and subsequent embellishment of a large mansion at Canons, near Edgware, in Middlesex (since demolished), where work seems to have been almost continually in progress between about 1713 and 1725. Here Shepherd appears to have been employed initially as a building craftsman and later in a supervisory capacity. He also helped to supervise some of the duke's other building enterprises in Bridgwater and Bath, where he had some association with John Wood, the principal architect of Georgian Bath. For Chandos, Shepherd also built two houses on the north side of Cavendish Square and the rectory at Great Stanmore, near Canons (all demolished). He also remodelled the Great Lodge at Enfield Chase (demolished) and undertook alterations to Shaw House, Newbury, Berkshire.<br>
<br>From 1723 onwards Shepherd took several parcels of ground on the Grosvenor estate under building agreements and there he erected some of the finest Georgian houses in London. These include 66 Brook Street, which has an outstanding display of ornamental plasterwork in its principal rooms; 72 Brook Street, where Shepherd himself lived for a brief period and which, with its mixture of decorative plasterwork and woodcarving, may have been in the nature of a show house; 12 North Audley Street, where he provided a richly embellished gallery at the rear, possibly to the designs of the Irish Palladian architect Sir Edward Lovett Pearce; and 71 to 75 South Audley Street, where the interiors contain several examples of the fine plasterwork which became a trademark of his work. In 1728 he undertook to build on the north side of Grosvenor Square and erected three houses (since demolished) with a uniform palace-like facade which showed considerable maturity of design. The architectural writer Robert Morris claimed that Shepherd had provided a design for the whole of the north side of the square, but that it proved impossible to secure the agreement of the various owners of building plots to carry this out. Of the three houses which he did build, the centre one with a columned and pedimented facade was described in 1730 as &#145;the fine house in Grosvenor-Square built by Mr. Shepherd the famous Architect&#146;  (<span class="italic">St James's Evening Post</span>).<br>
<br>By this time Shepherd had acted as executant architect at 4 St James's Square, where Henry Grey, duke of Kent (1664&#150;1740), built a grand town house, ostensibly of his own designing, and at Boreham House in Essex, where both James Gibbs and Henry Flitcroft appear to have been involved in the design. Indeed, Shepherd's rapid graduation from the status of a building craftsman to that of an architect who displayed an understanding of Palladian precedents, even if he frequently interpreted them in an individualistic way, suggests that he associated with the group of architects who were setting the standards of taste at that time, including Colin Campbell, who designed a house for himself on one of Shepherd's building plots in Brook Street and lived there as a near neighbour of Shepherd himself.<br>
<br>As an architect Shepherd also designed the Goodman's Fields Theatre in Whitechapel (subsequently demolished) and the first Covent Garden Theatre (burned down in 1808), undertook work at Hampden House, Buckinghamshire, and added wings at Petersham Lodge, Surrey (demolished). He was also responsible for the monuments in Flitton church, Bedfordshire, to the duke of Kent (signed &#145;Edw:d Shepherd Arch:t&#146;) and Lady Annabell de Grey. He almost certainly provided the design for the handsome Palladian house at 17 Bruton Street, Mayfair (subsequently the birthplace of Elizabeth II and since demolished), where the building lessee was his brother John. Other work which has been attributed to him on stylistic grounds includes Barnsley Park in Gloucestershire.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Shepherd continued to work as a speculative builder. In 1740&#150;42, on the site of the notorious May fair, he built Shepherd Market (which was named after him) and other developments in the vicinity of Curzon Street. He erected a two-storey market house with butchers' shops on the ground floor and a large room for entertainments above (rebuilt in 1860), and several other buildings in the area. At the time of his death he was building yet another large town mansion on the north side of Curzon Street, but this house, which subsequently took the name of Crewe House, was much extended and altered by later owners.<br>
<br>Shepherd died on 21 October 1747, &#145;greatly lamented by all who had the Pleasure of his Acquaintance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Penny London Post</span>). His funeral was held in St George's Church, Hanover Square, where he had been a vestryman for several years. His widow continued to run his building business until her own death on 18 June 1761. They appear to have been childless, and the bulk of their estate, which included Shepherd Market and other property and was said to be very considerable, was left to a great-nephew. The estate was heavily mortgaged, however, and the complication of discharging the mortgages and family disputes in later generations led to a succession of Dickensian chancery cases which embroiled the estate for the best part of a century.<br>
