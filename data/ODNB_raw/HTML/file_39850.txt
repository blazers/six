<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Keir,  Thelma  Cazalet-</span>  (1899&#150;1989), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 28 May 1899 at 4 Whitehall Gardens, London, the third of four children, the eldest of whom was killed in action in 1916, and only daughter of William Marshall Cazalet (1865&#150;1932), a man of hereditary wealth and standing, whose family origins were Huguenot, and his wife, Maud Lucia (<i>d</i>. 1952), daughter of Sir John Robert Heron-Maxwell, seventh baronet, of Springkell, Dumfriesshire, who was of modest means. The mother was the dominant parental influence: from her Thelma derived her worldly sophistication and love of the arts; also her feminism and Christian Science, two creeds to which she held firmly throughout her life. In London and at the Cazalets' country house, Fairlawne in Kent, she was introduced as a child to many leading figures in politics and literature, including Rudyard Kipling, J. M. Barrie, the Pankhursts, and Sidney and Beatrice Webb. After being taught at home by governesses, she attended lectures at the London School of Economics.<br>
<br>The lure of politics was already strong, and in the years immediately following the First World War Thelma Cazalet became an accepted member of the Lloyd George family circle, through her close friendship with the prime minister's youngest child, Megan. She entered politics by way of local government, first in Kent and then as a member of the London county council (LCC) for seven years (1924&#150;31), after which she became an alderman. Despite her radical connections her party allegiance was Conservative, though her outlook was never narrowly partisan. In 1931 she unsuccessfully contested the parliamentary seat of East Islington at a by-election, but in the general election held later in the year she was returned as National Conservative MP for the same constituency with a majority of over 14,000.<br>
<br>In the House of Commons Thelma Cazalet joined her brother Victor, who was MP for Chippenham. (He was killed in 1943 in an air crash with the Polish general Sikorski.) Her best subject in parliament was education, with which she had been particularly concerned on the LCC. She was a regular speaker on the education estimates, and from 1937 to 1940 was parliamentary private secretary to Kenneth Lindsay, when he was parliamentary secretary to the Board of Education. She married, in August 1939, David Edwin, son of the Revd Thomas Keir. Her husband was lobby correspondent of the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>. He died in 1969, and there were no children. On her marriage she changed her surname to Cazalet-Keir.<br>
<br>In March 1944, as a member of the Tory Reform Committee, Thelma Cazalet-Keir proposed an amendment to R. A. Butler's <span class="roman">Education Bill</span>, providing that there should be equal pay for men and women teachers. When the amendment was carried by the margin of a single vote, Churchill's wartime coalition suffered its only defeat. Greatly angered, Churchill insisted that the clause be deleted, making the issue one of confidence in himself; and she then felt she had no option but to vote against her own amendment. An important point had been made, however, and Churchill announced the setting up of a royal commission to consider the question of equal pay for equal work (1944&#150;6). From 1947 she was chairman of the Equal Pay Campaign Committee, and eventually saw the principle enshrined in legislation in 1970. Meanwhile Churchill had made personal amends by appointing her in May 1945 parliamentary secretary for education in his short-lived caretaker government. The 1945 general election, which swept that government away, also cost her her seat and ended her parliamentary career.<br>
<br>For some time Thelma Cazalet-Keir remained active in public life outside parliament. From 1946 to 1949 she was a member of the Arts Council, of whose precursor, the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts, she had been a founder member in 1940. She was also on the executive committee of the Contemporary Art Society, and from 1956 served a five-year term as a governor of the BBC. She was a keen supporter of the Fawcett Library, and in 1964 was president of the Fawcett Society. She was appointed CBE in 1952. A friend of most of the prime ministers during her life, she was a special confidante of Edward Heath throughout his premiership, though their relations later cooled when she rebuked him for his attitude to Margaret Thatcher. Rather surprisingly, she was never recommended for a life peerage.<br>
<br>After losing her parliamentary seat Thelma Cazalet-Keir started market gardening at her home in Kent, Raspit Hill, and for a time ran a flower shop in London. When she sold Raspit Hill, deliberately for much less than its true value, to an old friend, Malcolm MacDonald, she moved to a flat in London. During her last years her sight failed, a particularly sad affliction for one who was, perhaps above all, a visual aesthete. She had a valuable collection of works by modern British artists including Augustus John, who knew her well; his portrait of her in a bright yellow dress, with a piano&#151;which she played more than adequately&#151;behind her, is one of his finest. (It was painted in 1936, and is privately owned.)<br>
<br>In 1967 Thelma Cazalet-Keir published a short volume of memoirs, <span class="italic">From the Wings</span>, notable especially for its vivid description of Lloyd George. She died on 13 January 1989 at her London flat at 90 Eaton Square.<br>
