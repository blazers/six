<span class="headword">Rawlinson, Sir  Henry Creswicke</span>, first baronet  (1810&#150;1895), <span class="occ">Assyriologist and diplomatist</span>, was born at Chadlington, Oxfordshire, on 11 April 1810 into a north Lancashire family. He was the second son of Abram Tyzack Rawlinson, a breeder of racehorses, who married Eliza Eudocia Albinia Creswicke, of Gloucestershire, and settled in Chadlington in 1805. Educated at Wrington in Somerset and at a well-reputed school in Ealing, Rawlinson was entered for the East India Company's service and set out for India in 1827, sailing in the company of Sir John Malcolm, the well-known diplomatist and oriental scholar whose influence on him was profound. He outdistanced all his contemporaries in the acquisition of Persian and Indian vernacular languages. He received early promotion and was recognized as a smart officer, an outstanding horseman, and an exceptional linguist. From 1833 to 1839 with others he was engaged in reorganizing the Persian army. During this time he undertook tours in Susiana and Persian Kurdistan, for which explorations he was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1839. He returned to India and was appointed assistant to Sir W. Macnaughton in Afghanistan, where he saw much action and fought with distinction in 1842 at Kandahar, where he had become political agent for lower Afghanistan. These operations marked the successful end of his military career.<br>
<br>In 1843 Rawlinson was appointed political agent of the East India Company in Turkish Arabia and a year later also consul in Baghdad. His account of the cuneiform inscriptions of Bisitun was published in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society</span> in 1846, after a close and difficult examination of the site, which he had first inspected in 1836. He was elected a member of the society in 1847, and contributed many papers to its journals and addressed many of its meetings on different subjects of historical and literary importance. He was director of the society from 1862 until his death, and president from 1878 to 1881. He was also a long-time member and president of the Royal Geographical Society, and a contributor to its journal. Moreover, his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35689/', "George Rawlinson")</script> acknowledges in his <span class="italic">History of Herodotus</span> (the first volume of which was published in 1858) that &#145;Sir Henry exercised a general supervision over the Oriental portion of the work&#146;, which was crucial to its success. It was said of him: &#145;Few have left such a roll of continuous literary activity&#146;, particularly when he was a man of action rather than of the study. He was promoted to the post of consul-general in 1851 in Baghdad and was involved with Sir Henry Layard in his Assyrian excavations; when he came home in 1856 he was made a KCB.<br>
<br>Rawlinson is often referred to as the decipherer of cuneiform Akkadian, but this owes much to the adulatory biography published after his death by his scholar brother, George, and to his friendship with Sir Wallis Budge. In fact Rawlinson, though a fine scholar in Persian and Indian languages, was not well equipped to do so since he had no training in Semitic languages nor had he followed the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs. He made copies of the old Persian rock inscription at Bisitun in 1836&#150;7, but the similar inscriptions from Persepolis had already been deciphered in part in 1805 by Grotefend, whose work became available in English in 1833. Rawlinson's copy from Bisitun with an edition was published in 1847, by which time <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13335/', "Edward Hincks")</script>, a poor clergyman in co. Down eighteen years his senior, had already solved the main problems in the old Persian script. The two men were rivals in deciphering Akkadian cuneiform, both the language and the script. Rawlinson made a copy of the Akkadian version from the Bisitun trilingual inscription in 1847 and published it in 1852, but was hindered by treating the signs as alphabetic, while Hincks had already discovered their syllabic and logographic functions, thanks partly to his familiarity with Egyptian, and partly to his understanding of Semitic grammar. Layard, excavator of Nineveh, shared his finds with both scholars, and Rawlinson was put in charge of excavations when Hormuzd Rassam took over as field director. Rawlinson entered the competition organized at the Royal Asiatic Society in 1857 to submit a sealed translation of an Assyrian inscription, as did Hincks, Fox Talbot, and Jules Oppert. The four results were sufficiently alike to show that basic decipherment had genuinely been achieved. Rawlinson actively suppressed Hincks's work on Akkadian inscriptions in the British Museum, where he had a powerful ally in Budge. His disparagement of Assyrian art and architecture, his treatment of Rassam as an inferior and a foreigner, and his failure to deliver the results of his work to Layard eventually caused Layard to prefer Hincks, whom Rawlinson unjustifiably called &#145;an unscrupulous poacher&#146;. Rawlinson was anxious to prove his own priority in discoveries, and claimed credit for others' work on several occasions: the five great volumes <span class="italic">The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia</span>, published under his name between 1861 and 1884, were in fact mainly the work of Edwin Norris, George Smith, and Theophilus Pinches.<br>
<br>Rawlinson was returned on 4 February 1858 as conservative MP for Reigate, and was member for Frome from 1865 to 1868. On 12 September 1858 he became a member of the newly created Council of India but resigned on being appointed minister to Persia with the rank of major-general. His uncompromising attitude towards Russia led to his resignation the following year, though he attended the shah, Nasir al-Din, during his visits to England in 1873 and 1889, and maintained good relations with him. His publication of <span class="italic">England and Russia in the East</span> (1875) stirred controversy with its outspokenness. He served as a trustee of the British Museum from 1876 to 1895. He was a commissioner for the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1878 and the Indian and Colonial Exhibition of 1886. He was president of the London Oriental Congress in 1874. He received many academic awards in this country and abroad. He was given the grand cross of the Bath on 23 July 1889, and created a baronet on 6 February 1891 on Lord Salisbury's recognition of &#145;his distinguished service to the state, stretching over a long series of years&#146;.<br>
<br>On 2 September 1862 Rawlinson married Louisa Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1889), daughter of Henry Seymour of Knoyle, Wiltshire; they had two sons, of whom <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35690/', "Henry Seymour Rawlinson")</script> succeeded to the baronetcy. Rawlinson died on 5 March 1895 at his London home, 21 Charles Street, Berkeley Square. He was buried in Brookwood cemetery, Woking, on 9 March. Among contemporaries, he enjoyed a fine reputation and though to some he seemed imperious in manner, others found his company &#145;delightful and profitable&#146;, and convivial without pretension. His undoubted energy, wealth, scholarship in languages, and high social standing promoted public interest in Assyriology, and gives reason for Budge, in <span class="italic">The Rise and Progress of Assyriology</span> (1925), to call him &#145;the father of Assyriology&#146;.<br>
