<span class="headword">O'Connor,  Charles Yelverton</span>  (1843&#150;1902), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, the youngest son of John O'Connor (<i>d</i>. 1863), a landowner, of Gravelmount, Castletown, co. Meath, and (Mary) Elizabeth O'Keefe (<i>d</i>. 1863), the granddaughter of George Yelverton of Belle Isle, Tipperary, and great-niece of Barry Yelverton, first Lord Avonmore, was born at Gravelmount on 11 January 1843. In 1850 the family moved to Waterford, where Charles was later educated at the endowed school; at the age of seventeen, he was articled to John Chaloner Smith, a railway engineer. After experience of railway work in Ireland, in 1865 he emigrated to New Zealand, where he was employed by the Canterbury provincial government as an assistant engineer on the construction of the coach road from Christchurch to the Hokitika goldfields on the west coast. He was gradually promoted, and in 1870 was appointed engineer for the western part of the province. On 5 March 1874 he married Susan Laetitia, the daughter of William Ness, a Scottish-born architect then living in New Zealand. Later that year, when provincial governments were abolished, O'Connor worked for the national New Zealand government as district engineer for the combined Westland and Nelson districts. In 1880 he was elected to the London Institution of Civil Engineers. From then until 1883 he was inspecting engineer for the whole of the South Island; from 1883 to 1890 he was under-secretary for public works for New Zealand; and in 1890 he was made marine engineer for the colony.<br>
<br>In April 1891 O'Connor was appointed engineer-in-chief and general manager of railways in the colony of Western Australia at a salary of &pound;1200, but after effecting striking improvements and extensions to the railway system he resigned the latter post in December 1896, in order that he might devote all his time to engineering work. The discovery of the Coolgardie goldfield in 1892 led to an extraordinary and rapid development of Western Australia, in which O'Connor, as engineer-in-chief, played a part second only to that of the premier, Sir John Forrest. In eleven years he undertook two important projects, namely Fremantle harbour and the Coolgardie water supply, besides a large number of roads, bridges, harbours, and jetties. He was also responsible for all new railway work, for which he had a lifelong passion. Under his leadership major lines were built from Perth to the southwest and northern regions of Western Australia and to its eastern goldfields.<br>
<br>The Fremantle harbour works, carried out from 1892 to 1902, at a cost of &pound;1,459,000, provided a safe harbour for the largest ocean steamships at all states of the tide and in all weathers. It was formed by constructing north and south moles, and an inner harbour with wharves and jetties was established by dredging the mouth of the Swan River. The Coolgardie water scheme, carried out between 1898 and 1903 at a cost of &pound;2,660,000, supplied water to the principal goldfields of the colony. The source was the Helena River, on which, about 23 miles from Perth, a reservoir was constructed whence 5 million gallons of water could be pumped daily to Coolgardie, a distance of 328 miles. This bold plan, without precedent anywhere in the world at that time, was supported by Premier Forrest and approved by a panel of British experts, but many colonists were sceptical. O'Connor's use of an untried electric caulking machine to join the pipes drew particular fire in the local press. After Forrest left Perth for federal politics in 1901 O'Connor was particularly isolated and received little public backing from a weak and unstable government. By March 1902 tests had convinced him that the scheme would work. But the strain had affected his mental balance. On 10 March 1902, ten months before Forrest turned on the water, he rode his horse into the water near Robb's Jetty, Fremantle, and shot himself. He was buried at Fremantle cemetery on 12 March. He was survived by his wife and seven of their eight children, one of whom, Kathleen (Kate), later become a distinguished artist.<br>
<br>O'Connor was a tall and athletic man who enjoyed riding and often swam. The courtly manners of the Irish gentry which he had acquired in his youth were unusual in Perth, but despite a degree of reserve he was generally liked. Only his willingness and ability to work very long hours enabled him to cope with the demands of his job. His professional achievements earned him respect from his engineering peers in Britain as well as in New Zealand and Australia. He was created CMG in 1897.<br>
