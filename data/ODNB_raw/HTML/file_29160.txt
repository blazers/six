<span class="headword">Whalley,  Peter</span>  (1722&#150;1791), <span class="occ">author and literary editor</span>, was born at Rugby, Warwickshire, on 2 September 1722, the second of the seven children of Peter Whalley (<i>bap</i>. 1693, <i>d</i>. 1772), attorney-at-law, and his first wife, Elizabeth White. His family had been associated with Northamptonshire for at least two centuries. He attended Merchant Taylors' School from 1731 to 1740. In July of that year he entered St John's College, Oxford, became a fellow in 1743, and graduated BA in 1744. He took a BCL in 1768. From 1748 to 1762 Whalley held the vicarage of St Sepulchre's in Northampton; from 1753 to 1766 that of Preston deanery and from 1762 to 1763 the rectory of Ecton, both in Northamptonshire. In 1752 he became master of Courteenhall grammar school in that county. From 1760 to 1776 he was upper grammar master of Christ's Hospital in London in succession to James Townley. In 1766 Whalley was appointed by the corporation of the City of London rector of the united parishes of St Margaret Pattens and St Gabriel Fenchurch. He was made vicar of Horley, Surrey, in 1768 and held both benefices until his death. From 1784 to 1789 he was headmaster of St Olave's Grammar School, Southwark, and a justice of the peace.<br>
<br>Whalley's writings were firmly rooted in the Augustan tradition. His <span class="italic">Essay on the Manner of Writing History</span> (1746), the first free-standing essay in the eighteenth century on that subject, developed the notion, derived from classical texts, that the purpose of historical writing was instruction and improvement and not literary effect. In <span class="italic">On the Learning of Shakespeare</span> (1748) Whalley showed by detailed textual analysis that Shakespeare possessed extensive knowledge of classical authors and made considerable use of them, something hitherto unappreciated; at the same time he acknowledged the creative power of Shakespeare's imagination and so pointed the way forward to later developments in Shakespearian criticism. He also published a number of sermons.<br>
<br>As an editor Whalley was responsible for the first critical edition of the works of Ben Jonson (7 vols., 1756). He was one of the last commentators in the eighteenth century to defend Jonson's reputation, remarking favourably on his learning, his skill in characterization, and his imaginative plots, as well as the lyricism of some of his poems. Whalley's textual notes attempted to explain the obscurities of Jonson's language, but his omissions attracted some unfavourable contemporary comment. Whalley prepared a second edition, but publication by Francis Waldron, which began in numbers in 1792, after Whalley's death, did not get beyond the second number. Whalley's edition remained the standard one until replaced by that of William Gifford in 1816.<br>
<br>In 1757 Whalley was chosen by a committee of local gentlemen to continue the process of editing for publication the materials collected by John Bridges for a <span class="italic">History of Northamptonshire</span>, following the failure of Benjamin Buckler and Richard Gifford to carry out the task. He re-edited and improved that portion of the book which had been brought out by Samuel Jebb in 1739 and, with additions, the first volume of the finished work appeared in 1763. The first part of the second volume came out in 1769, but no further progress was made on the rest of the material for many years because of Whalley's other commitments, financial concerns, and the deaths of the members of the Northamptonshire committee. Whalley eventually completed the project, largely following Bridges' plan, and the book was finally published in the autumn of 1791, shortly after his death. In 1788 Whalley sought subscriptions for a book on the history of the royal hospitals in the City of London, but it never appeared.<br>
<br>Whalley's first wife, Mary, died in 1767. On 16 January 1768 at St Antholin, Budge Row, London, he married Elizabeth (Betsy) Jacobs of List Lane, London, but her extravagance led him into financial difficulties and he was forced to hide in the house of his friend Francis Waldron. When his hiding place was discovered he fled to the Low Countries, and died at Ostend on 12 June 1791. His widow survived until 16 March 1803.<br>
