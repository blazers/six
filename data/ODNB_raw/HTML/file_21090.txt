<span class="headword">Page,  Benjamin William</span>  (1765&#150;1845), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Ipswich, Suffolk, on 7 February 1765. He entered the navy in November 1778 under the patronage of Sir Edward Hughes, with whom he went out to the East Indies in the <i>Superb</i>, and in her was present in the first four actions with Suffren, the French commander. In December 1782 he was appointed acting lieutenant of the <i>Exeter</i>, and in her took part in the fifth action, on 20 June 1783. In August he was moved into the <i>Worcester</i>, in the following February to the sloop <i>Lizard</i>, and in September to the frigate <i>Eurydice</i>, in which he returned to England in July 1785. His commission as lieutenant was then confirmed, dating from 20 November 1784. From 1786 to 1790 he was on the Jamaica station in the frigate <i>Astraea</i>, commanded by Captain Peter Rainier, whom he followed to the <i>Monarch</i> in the channel for a few months during the Spanish armament. In December 1790 he was appointed to the <i>Minerva</i>, in which he went out to the East Indies; in August he was transferred to the <i>Crown</i>, and in her returned to England in July 1792. In January 1793 he was appointed to the <i>Suffolk</i>, again with Rainier, and in the spring of 1794 went out in her to the East Indies. In September Rainier promoted him to command the sloop <i>Hobart</i>, a promotion afterwards confirmed, but to date only from 12 April 1796.<br>
<br>In consequence of Page's long acquaintance with eastern seas, he was ordered, in January 1796, to pilot the squadron through the intricate passages leading to the Moluccas, which were taken possession of without resistance, and proved a very rich prize, each of the captains present receiving, it was said, &pound;15,000. Unfortunately for Page, some important dispatches were found on a Dutch brig which was taken on the way, and the <i>Hobart</i> was sent with them to Calcutta. Page was thus absent when Amboyna, in the Dutch East Indies, was captured, and did not share in the prize money. In December 1796 he convoyed the China trade from Penang to Bombay City with success, for which he was specially thanked by the government, and by the merchants, who presented him with 500 guineas. In February 1797 he was appointed acting captain of the frigate <i>Orpheus</i> (32 guns), but a few months later he received his post rank from the Admiralty, dated 22 December 1796, and was ordered to return to England. In January 1800 he was appointed to the <i>Inflexible</i> (64 guns), which, without her lower-deck guns, was employed during the next two years on transport service in the Mediterranean. She was paid off in March 1802, and in November Page commissioned the frigate <i>Caroline</i> (36 guns), in which, in the following summer, he went to the East Indies, where he captured several privateers, and especially two in the Bay of Bengal, for which the merchants of Bombay and Madras each voted him a present of 500 guineas. In February 1805 he was transferred to the <i>Trident</i>, as flag captain to Vice-Admiral Rainier, with whom he returned to England in October. In 1809 to 1810 Page commanded the sea-fencibles of the Harwich district, and from 1812 to 1815 the <i>Puissant</i> (74 guns), guardship at Spithead.<br>
<br>Page had no further service afloat, but became, in course of seniority, rear-admiral on 12 August 1819, vice-admiral on 22 July 1830, and admiral on 23 August 1841. He had married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1834), only child of John Herbert of Totnes in Devon; they had no children. During his retirement he lived principally at Ipswich, and he died there on 3 October 1845. He left the Ipswich corporation a collection of marine paintings.<br>
