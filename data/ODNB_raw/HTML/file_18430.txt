</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mayerne, Sir  Theodore  Turquet de</span>  (1573&#150;1655), <span class="occ">physician</span>, the eldest son of Louis Turquet and his wife, Louise, daughter of Antoine le Ma&ccedil;on, treasurer-at-war to Fran&ccedil;ois I and Henri II of France, was born at Geneva on 28 September 1573. He was christened Th&eacute;odore after his godfather, Theodore Beza. The family had long been settled at Chieri in Piedmont; his grandfather, &Eacute;tienne Turquet, had emigrated to Lyons and founded a silk industry there. In 1572, when the St Bartholomew's day massacre spread to Lyons, Louis Turquet, who had become a protestant, fled with his wife to Geneva. Louis Turquet was an active supporter of Henri of Navarre, afterwards Henri IV of France. He assumed the name of de Mayerne-Turquet, allegedly from a former property in Piedmont. Under that name he published translations of Latin and Spanish works, and political pamphlets, one of which, <span class="italic">De la monarchie aristo-d&eacute;mocratique</span> (1611), was banned as seditious by the regency of Marie de M&eacute;dici.<h2>
<a name="Huguenotphysician"></a>Huguenot physician</h2>After school in Geneva, Th&eacute;odore Turquet studied philosophy at the University of Heidelberg and then medicine at the University of Montpellier, where he graduated MB in 1596. While a student at Heidelberg he compiled a handbook for travellers in Europe which his proud father published in Geneva as <span class="italic">Sommaire description de la France, Allemagne, Italie et Espagne</span> (1591). In his doctoral thesis at Montpellier (1597), he defended chemical remedies. This reflected, above all, the influence of his father's friend, a fellow Huguenot, who had also emigrated from Lyons to Geneva: Joseph du Chesne, alias Quercetanus, the most famous Paracelsian and Hermetic physician of the time. From Montpellier Turquet moved to Paris and joined du Chesne, who was now established there as <i>m&eacute;decin ordinaire</i> to Henri IV, working under the king's <i>premier m&eacute;decin</i>, Jean Ribit, sieur de la Rivi&egrave;re, another Huguenot from Geneva. Through them he entered the royal service as <i>m&eacute;decin ordinaire par quartier</i>&#151;that is, on duty for three months in the year. In 1599 the king assigned him as physician to his kinsman Henri, duc de Rohan, who, with other young Huguenot nobles, was making a grand tour of Europe. Turquet accompanied Rohan through Germany and Italy as far as Naples. Rohan remained, for the rest of his life, Turquet's friend and hero, his model of austere, aristocratic, Huguenot virtue.<br>
<br>Back in Paris, Turquet rejoined la Rivi&egrave;re and du Chesne, becoming an enthusiastic alchemist in du Chesne's esoteric Hermetic circle. The medical successes of this trio&#151;three Paracelsian Huguenots from heretical Geneva, none of them a doctor of the University of Paris&#151;alarmed the orthodox Galenists of the faculty of medicine, which in 1603 formally and intemperately condemned du Chesne and Turquet as charlatans, and forbade them to practise in the city. The ban was completely ineffective, but led to a long and bitter controversy, to which Turquet contributed a restrained <span class="italic">Apologia</span> (1603).<h2>
<a name="ChiefphysiciantoJamesI"></a>Chief physician to James I</h2>Meanwhile Turquet achieved a spectacular success. In 1605 Lord Norreys of Rycote, a young kinsman of Robert Cecil, earl of Salisbury, returning from a special embassy to Spain, had been struck down in Paris by an epidemic then raging. Several other physicians having failed, the king sent Turquet to treat him and he recovered. Next spring, with the king's permission, Norreys took Turquet to England to treat Queen Anne, wife of James I. There, on a visit to Oxford, he found himself welcomed as &#145;the queen's physician&#146; and suddenly made a doctor of the university. He also made other useful contacts which, on his return to Paris, he improved.<br>
<br>In 1611 Turquet decided to use them. By then the Paris partnership had broken up. La Rivi&egrave;re had died in 1605, du Chesne in 1609. Henri IV had wished in 1609 to make Turquet his <i>premier m&eacute;decin</i>, but under clerical pressure had insisted that he become a Roman Catholic, which he refused to do. The king was assassinated the following year, the Catholic <i>d&eacute;vots</i> took over, and Turquet decided to act. Having negotiated excellent terms, he accepted the post of chief physician to James I. At the same time he contrived to keep his formal appointment and pension at the French court, relying on periodic visits and a deputy. Having been recognized as &#145;noble&#146; in 1609, he now dropped altogether the plebeian name Turquet, and would sign himself only as Theodore de Mayerne.<br>
<br>Despite initial jealousies&#151;the death of Prince Henry in 1612 was particularly exploited against him, but the king supported him throughout&#151;Mayerne soon became the most successful (and the most expensive) physician in London. In 1616 he was elected fellow of the College of Physicians and supported the now resumed project of a London pharmacopoeia which some members of the college, and particularly the Paracelsian Thomas Moffett, had advocated under Elizabeth. He acquired Moffett's papers, including his unpublished compilation on insects (<span class="italic">Insectorum theatrum</span>), which he would publish, and dedicate to the college, in 1634. This project was now completed: the <span class="italic">London Pharmacopoeia</span> was published in 1618, with an introduction by Mayerne, and a special section on chemical and metallic remedies. Mayerne also supported the London apothecaries in the campaign which led to their separation from the grocers and their incorporation under charter in 1620. Although he seldom attended the regular meetings of the college and was to decline the position of elect in 1627, he had by now won the respect and friendship of the fellows. King James knighted him in 1624.<br>
<br>Mayerne served James I as a confidential agent in various literary, diplomatic, and political affairs. Through his marriages and his cosmopolitan family he had contacts in the Netherlands, the Palatinate, Switzerland, and Savoy. Almost all British and several foreign ambassadors were his patients; so were the Huguenot leaders Bouillon, Rohan, and Soubise. Recognizing his influence, the city of Geneva and the canton of Bern, the head of the Swiss confederation, appointed him their agent at the English court. In 1620 he bought the barony, castle, and estate of Aubonne in the Pays de Vaud&#151;subject to Bern and conveniently close to Geneva. He spoke of retiring there to write a great work on medicine and hoped to plant a noble dynasty in Switzerland. Meanwhile it was useful as a listening post in the early years of the Thirty Years' War.<br>
<br>The French court was very suspicious of these activities, and especially of Mayerne's connections with the malcontent Huguenot grandees. It therefore watched him closely. In 1618&#151;a delicate time in both internal and international affairs&#151;he arrived in Paris, only to be summarily, and without explanation, ordered out of the country. This caused great umbrage, loud expostulations, and a breach in diplomatic relations. During the Anglo-French war of 1627&#150;9 the French court seized the opportunity to cancel his office and his pension; which caused further umbrage and expostulation.<h2>
<a name="AttheCarolinecourt"></a>At the Caroline court</h2>Mayerne was abroad, visiting Aubonne, when James I died in March 1625. Before leaving England he had written, for the other royal doctors, a valuable psychosomatic portrait of the king. On his return he found a changed court. His appointment and privileges were continued, but the new king clearly preferred William Harvey, and Mayerne became, in effect, the queen's doctor only. Fortunately she became devoted to him and resisted Richelieu's attempt to have him replaced by another French physician, to be nominated by himself, who would certainly have been a spy. There were other ominous changes too. The following year, when Mayerne sought permission to revisit Aubonne, it was refused: his services at court, he was told, were too valuable. Year after year he tried again, with the same reply. Finally he was told never to raise the matter again: the ban on all foreign travel was permanent; and he was ultimately compensated (together with the queen's other doctor, Sir Thomas Cadyman) with a patent for distilling (1636). Meanwhile, his frustrated energies were redirected into potentially lucrative chemical and mineral experiments, and a new interest (appropriate to the aestheticism of the new court) in the technology of the arts. He patronized the medallist Nicolas Briot, cross-examined Rubens while sitting for his portrait, supplied colours for the enamels of Jean Petitot, and encouraged Edward Norgate to write his treatise on miniatures. His house in St Martin's Lane, London, became the resort of immigrant artisans, whom he found more congenial than English courtiers.<br>
<br>Why did Charles I so firmly forbid Mayerne to travel? After all, he would allow Harvey to accompany the earl of Arundel to Austria, Bohemia, and Italy. But Mayerne was a political doctor, perhaps a political busybody, deeply involved in the protestant interest in Europe and the Huguenot cause in France, both of which Charles I would decisively abandon. Mayerne did not abandon them. During the 1630s he intervened in favour of Palatine or Vaudois refugees, the protesting ministers of Geneva, and the Dutch and French churches in England, now harassed by Archbishop Laud. Laud was not his patient, and their relations, understandably, were cool.<br>
<br>So, behind the mask of courtly deference, the fashionable court physician moved mentally away from the court. The ban on travel was a standing grievance. Aubonne, Mayerne complained, had become &#145;a hole&#146; in his enforced absence, and his prodigal son, who lorded it there as &#145;Henry d'Aubonne&#146;, the young baron, was wasting his father's hard-earned substance with riotous living and harlots. An overbearing father, Mayerne worked off his resentments in furious letters to his son, who had reacted against the Huguenot austerity of his father and of his godfather, the duc de Rohan, and would soon die of his dissipations. In private letters to foreign friends Mayerne complained that the life at court to which he was now committed was one of servitude: how different from his happy association with the easy-going King James, &#145;mon bon maistre&#146;, whom he always remembered with affection.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1642 the mask fell. The king, having left London to prepare for civil war, then summoned the royal doctors to join him at York. Harvey obeyed; Mayerne did not. Pleading age and corpulency, he stayed in London to concentrate on his private practice and his chemical experiments in his new house in Chelsea. Royalists regarded him as a deserter. In fact, he maintained his Huguenot independence and self-sufficiency. He received no salary from the king after 1642, but in March 1644 the parliament entrusted him with the health of those of the king's children who had been left in London; and in May 1644&#151;age and corpulency notwithstanding&#151;he obeyed an urgent appeal from the king in Oxford to travel to Exeter and attend the queen, then ill and expecting her youngest child, Henrietta, afterwards duchess of Orl&eacute;ans.<br>
<br>Throughout the civil wars Mayerne hoped for a &#145;Presbyterian&#146; compromise, and it was even suggested that, through his influence in Switzerland, he could mediate it. But in 1643, and again in 1645, when the parliament proposed to tax him, he ostentatiously prepared to emigrate, with his whole family, to the Netherlands. The threat sufficed: the parliament agreed that &#145;a man whose extraordinary abilities would make him welcome in any part of Christendom&#146; deserved special treatment; and he stayed in London until his death.<br>
<br>Mayerne was twice married: first, in 1606, to Margaretha Elburg van den Boetzelaer, of a noble Dutch family, who died on 17 November 1628; secondly, on 14 August 1630, to Isabella, daughter of Albert Joachimi, Dutch ambassador to England from 1625 to 1651. She survived him by seven months only, dying early in November 1655. Of the four sons and five daughters of these two marriages, all but the two youngest daughters died young and unmarried. Of these two, the elder, Elizabeth, married in 1652 Pierre de Caumont, marquis de Cugnac, son of the Huguenot duc de la Force, but died childless on 10 July 1653; the younger, Adriana, who alone survived her father, married Cugnac's brother Armand de Caumont, marquis de Montpouillan, in 1659, but died childless at The Hague in 1661.<br>
<br>Mayerne died at Chelsea on 22 March 1655, aged eighty-two, in full possession of his faculties and fortune. He was buried with his wife, mother, and five of his children, at the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, where a monument was erected on the north wall of the chancel, with a Latin inscription written by his godson and former amanuensis Sir Theodore de Vaux. Thomas Hodges' funeral sermon for Mayerne, <span class="italic">Inacessible Glory</span>, was published in 1655.<h2>
<a name="Reputationandachievement"></a>Reputation and achievement</h2>Mayerne's reputation as a physician, in his own time, was immense throughout Europe, but he was not, like his colleague Harvey, an original thinker. He and Harvey had indeed little in common, Harvey being as dismissive of chemistry as Mayerne was of the doctors of Padua. He was essentially an eclectic, who sought to incorporate Paracelsian and Hermetic ideas in a basically Galenic system. He was far more tolerant of the Galenist doctors of Paris than they of him, and sent his second son, James, to Paris to learn &#145;the solid foundations of medicine&#146; from the men who had previously vituperated him. His proclaimed masters were, among the ancients, Hippocrates and Hermes Trismegistus; among the moderns, Fernel and du Chesne. His great contribution lay in his therapeutic practice, his careful and continuous observation of his patients, and his flexible response to their condition. This is recorded in his &#145;Ephemerides&#146;, a regular record, which shows him as an open-minded, rational, objective practitioner, not tied to any theoretical system.<br>
<br>On one occasion during the personal reign of Charles I Mayerne came forward as a constructive medical reformer. In 1631, alarmed by the great plague of 1630, the privy council solicited advice from both the College of Physicians and the royal doctors. The recommendations of the latter (written in French) were clearly the work of Mayerne. He proposed the establishment of a centralized &#145;office of health&#146; with wide coercive powers to prevent and control outbreaks of plague, a corps of trained officials, and special hospitals modelled on those which he had known in France and Italy. The government at first took this bold and costly project seriously but afterwards allowed it to lapse.<br>
<br>Mayerne was a colourful personality, larger than life in all respects. Though he lived for forty-four years in England, he never became English. He refused to own land in England or, unless pressed, to speak or write English. His letters, written in a majestic, sometimes flamboyant hand, are lively and robust; though sometimes grandiose and self-important, they are never dull and often humane. Though notoriously fond of money, he kept a liberal and hospitable table, at which he indulged himself freely: in his last years he was immobile through obesity, which he did nothing to correct. To Lord Conway, who sent him a recipe &#145;to make fat men lean&#146;, he replied that the recipe was good, but that he would never use it, &#145;having been long aware that an evil soul never&#151;or rarely&#151;dwells in a fat body&#146;. He compiled a cookery book, collected foreign recipes, kept deer, and grew medicinal herbs at Horne Park, near Eltham in Kent, of which he was ranger. He invented a cordial, the secret of which remained the valuable property of his sister's family in Geneva and which would be offered to Napoleon when he entered Geneva as conqueror.<br>
<br>After his death, and protracted litigation, Mayerne's books and papers passed to his niece, Aim&eacute;e de Frott&eacute;, and her husband, his long-serving Genevan assistant, Jean (afterwards Sir John) Colladon; and then to their son, Mayerne's godson, Sir Theodore Colladon, physician of Chelsea Hospital. Since the Colladons had published nothing Sir Theodore de Vaux, using his own copies and supported by the Royal College of Physicians, published his <span class="italic">Praxis Mayerniana</span> in two volumes (1690&#150;96). This roused Sir Theodore Colladon to supply the originals to Joseph Browne, a bookseller's hack, who then published <span class="italic">Mayernii opera medica</span> (1700), a hasty and inaccurate compilation prefaced by attacks on Vaux and the Royal College.<br>
