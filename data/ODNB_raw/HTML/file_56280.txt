<span class="headword">Craig,  Maria</span>  (1822&#150;1905), <span class="occ">Post Office official</span>, was born in Dublin and was the wife, and almost certainly by 1853 the widow, of Robert Craig, a classical tutor, with whom she had at least two sons and two daughters. Her significance lies in her recruitment in 1853 as one of the first female employees of the private telegraph service and the General Post Office. In the middle of the nineteenth century there were few job opportunities for middle-class women; the professions were largely closed to women, and office work was still a male preserve. However, the newly established telegraph companies provided a new area of employment for women. By the 1850s a small number of private companies were providing the beginnings of a national telegraph system. Nationally, provision was decidedly patchy, but in London competition between the companies led to a considerable number of branch offices opening up. The Electric and International Telegraph Company was the largest of the companies and co-ordinated its London operations from Central Station, Moorgate. Central Station was organized on a scale which reflected its importance at the heart of the telegraph network: located on three floors, its instrument galleries serviced not only London's commercial, government, and private business, but also the provincial cities. Although male telegraphists, engineers, and boy messengers formed the core staff at Central Station, from the early 1850s the Electric began to recruit large numbers of female telegraphists. Women were found to be as good as men as manipulators of the Wheatstone needle instruments, while for lower wages a superior social class of women could be recruited. Like the other companies the Electric adopted a marriage bar, ensuring that, unlike male workers, women would not expect an accelerating pay scale. At Central Station the female staff was young, single, and respectable.<br>
<br>One of the first women to be recruited was Maria Craig, who started work at Central in 1853 and remained there for the rest of her working life. From the beginning she was employed in a key supervisory role. In 1855 she was the Electric's highest paid female employee, earning a fortnightly salary of &pound;4 10<i>s</i>., compared to 10&#150;14<i>s</i>. per week paid to the rest of the women. Unusually, she was married (but probably widowed), with at least one child, in a workforce otherwise composed of single women. The Scudamore report on the acquisition by the Post Office of the telegraph companies describes Mrs Craig as being employed as a &#145;matron&#146; by the Electric in charge of the female telephonists at Central Station. Her marital status and relative maturity marked her off from the women in her charge.<br>
<br>Maria Craig's managerial role was a complex one, shaped partly by the nature of the work and partly by the youth and gender of the workers. Although telegraphy required a period of training, her main role does not appear to have been in this area. Rather, she was responsible for general supervision of the female staff, attending to their well-being and discipline. It was said she had a &#145;watchful eye&#146;. Although only male telegraphists worked at night, the women were employed during a long day shift of up to ten hours, six days a week. Moreover, although the work was light, they were required to be in close attendance to their machines even when not directly involved in the transmission or receipt of messages. Close supervision was essential. While at work the women were not allowed to leave the station, but were granted certain privileges: the company set aside a kitchen and dining room for their use and provided tea and coffee, bread and butter, plus fuel, light, utensils, linen, and attendance.<br>
<br>The success of the Electric's system of female employment formed the basis for the further feminization of the workforce by the General Post Office, following the nationalization of the telegraphs in 1870. The Post Office expanded telegraphic communications, and embarked on an accelerated training programme and a big staff recruitment drive. Female employees had already proved to be cheaper and socially superior to men; they were also less militant at a time when male telegraphists were becoming unionized.<br>
<br>At Central Station the female workforce increased rapidly from 267 prior to transfer to 466 by September 1870. The Post Office fully exploited the maternal system of control already in place. Maria Craig continued in her role as matron. In the Scudamore report she was congratulated along with her staff for her forbearance during the stress of transfer. When Central was reorganized in 1870 she was given her own sitting room as part of the new female accommodation. Although there was a proliferation of female supervisors in the telegraph service in the 1870s, Maria Craig continued in her role as matron until her retirement in 1883. She was then earning &pound;250 a year and, unusually for a woman, was provided with a pension. She died on Christmas eve 1905 at her home, 34 Harpenden Road, West Norwood, London, after an accidental fall.<br>
<br>Maria Craig's managerial role was not formally recognized by the Post Office. She was not mentioned in the Post Office establishment books, which were restricted to male officers at this time. Neither did she give evidence before either the Scudamore or Playfair inquiries of the 1870s. However, her importance in the management of women in a new area of technology cannot be underestimated.<br>
