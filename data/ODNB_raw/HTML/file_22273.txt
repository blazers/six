<span class="headword">Pilkington <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hopkins]</span>,  Mary Susanna</span>  (1761&#150;1839), <span class="occ">educational and children's writer</span>, was baptized on 6 April 1761 at St Michael's, Cambridge, the daughter of Allen Hopkins (<i>d</i>. 1773), a surgeon, and his wife, Mary Thornhill, of Stilton. Her parents had married on 7 December 1759; she gave her age as sixty-three in January 1825. According to her own account, she was &#145;educated under the prospect of enjoying an Independent, if not an Affluent, Fortune&#146;  (Mary Pilkington to Charles Lambourn, 20 June 1810, Royal Literary Fund archive, BL), but these prospects were dashed after the death of her father in London on 20 April 1773. Owing to either a mistake in the title deeds to her father's estates, or the &#145;illegal conduct&#146; of her uncle, Allen Hopkins's estates were inherited by his brother, leaving Mary and her mother destitute but for a legacy of a few hundred pounds from her grandfather, a clergyman. Their predicament sent her mother insane and therefore utterly dependent on Mary; &#145;at length&#146;  (ibid.) she recovered after being treated by Dr Monro of Bethlem Hospital.<br>
<br>On 6 July 1786 at St Clement Danes, Westminster, Mary Hopkins married her father's successor, John Pilkington, a man &#145;endowed with an amiable Disposition &amp; a generous Heart, but alas! totally devoid of Worldly Prudence&#146;  (Mary Pilkington to Charles Lambourn, 20 June 1810, Royal Literary Fund archive, BL). They lived for a short while in Ely but John Pilkington's practice seems to have failed and he was compelled to make a living as a naval surgeon. After considering her limited options, Mary Pilkington became governess to four motherless children in a family referred to only by the initial &#145;W&#146;. She proved to be well suited to her employment and remained in the family for several years until, overcome by ill health, she resigned. On recovering her health she decided to take advantage of her experience as a teacher and her interest in education and to become a professional writer for children. She had already published a volume of poetry in 1796 and now turned her hand to writing the first of many morally didactic tales. Three were published by Elizabeth Newbery in 1797: <span class="italic">Edward Bernard, or, Merit Exalted</span>; <span class="italic">The Force of Example, or, The History of Henry and Caroline</span>; and <span class="italic">Obedience Rewarded, and Prejudice Conquered, or, The History of Mortimer Lascelles</span>.<br>
<br>Pilkington quickly branched out into educational literature and wrote a succession of works designed for the growing market of girls' boarding-schools, including <span class="italic">A Mirror for the Female Sex: Historical Beauties for Young Ladies</span> (1798), <span class="italic">Biography for Girls</span> (1798), and <span class="italic">Mentorial tales for the instruction of young ladies just leaving school and entering upon the theatre of life</span> (1802). Although she regarded the religious and moral dimensions of education as paramount, she echoed both Hannah More and Mary Wollstonecraft in arguing that girls should be given an intellectual education and in asserting that &#145;the female mind is certainly as capable of acquiring knowledge as that of the other sex&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Mirror for the Female Sex</span>, 61). Convinced that biography could be morally instructive, she published <span class="italic">Memoirs of Celebrated Female Characters</span> (1804) to inspire her readers to emulate the heroism, learning, piety, stoicism, and artistic achievements of illustrious women from both the past and the present. Pilkington's religious and political conservatism unsurprisingly coloured her biographical judgements, yet did not prevent her from praising the abilities, if not the conduct or politics, of such morally controversial subjects as Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary Robinson, and Helen Maria Williams. Although she successfully targeted a female readership, Pilkington also published a biographical compilation for boys and an abridgement of Oliver Goldsmith's natural history, which proved the most long-lived of all her works and was still being reprinted in Philadelphia in 1846.<br>
<br>For over a decade from 1798 Pilkington was a regular contributor to the <span class="italic">Lady's Monthly Museum</span>, a popular women's magazine owned by her principal publishers, Vernor and Hood. Her contributions, which were mostly anonymous or signed either &#145;M.P.&#146;, &#145;P.&#146;, or &#145;Mrs P.&#146;, ranged from poetry and stories to biography and snippets of society gossip, and she also undertook editorial work on the magazine. The <span class="italic">Museum</span> was a source of steady yet lowly paid work (24 guineas per annum), and Pilkington repeatedly asked for her salary to be increased to reflect her continued commitment to a publication that she viewed as &#145;the Child of my Adoption&#146;  (Mary Pilkington to Sharpe, 22 Jan 1810, Royal Literary Fund archive, BL). The loss of 30 guineas for a commission when another of her publishers, Hughes, went bankrupt in 1804 and the fading fortunes of her principal publishers (from 1806 Vernor, Hood, and Sharpe) dramatically altered Pilkington's circumstances. A debilitating illness in 1810 forced her, by now a widow, to apply to the Royal Literary Fund for financial support; she received 20 guineas that year. Her second collection of poems, which had been in the pipeline for several years, was published in 1811 with a portrait of her by Playfer.<br>
<br>The last twenty years of Pilkington's life were clouded by frequent and prolonged bouts of ill health which she described as nervous disorders or fevers. Aggravated by financial worries and the failing health of her mother, who was over eighty in 1815, her own health deteriorated to such a degree that she struggled to keep writing. Moreover she could no longer find a ready market for her stock-in-trade didactic works and had to diversify. Early in 1815 she wrote:<blockquote>Finding that Necessities were very pressing and that Mr Harris was not inclined to purchase my Productions as fast as I could compose them, I was induced to place greater Confidence in a species of Novel which I disposed of to Mr Newman. (Mary Pilkington to James Anderson, 7 Feb 1815, Royal Literary Fund archive, BL)</blockquote>This novel was <span class="italic">Celebrity, or, The Unfortunate Choice</span> (1815), which was published by the Minerva Press. A week later, when applying for another grant from the Royal Literary Fund, she despairingly predicted that she would never &#145;again derive support from my Talent&#146; for she grew &#145;more Confused and Impaired&#146;  (Mary Pilkington to James Anderson, 14 Feb 1815, ibid.). She nevertheless published two further works, the last of which was feelingly entitled <span class="italic">The Shipwreck, or, Misfortune the Inspirer of Virtuous Sentiments</span> (1819). In January 1825 she again applied to the Royal Literary Fund for aid and received &pound;25; thereafter nothing is known of her until her death in 1839. Four novels by Miss or Mrs Pilkington and published by the Minerva Press, the best-known of which was her first, <span class="italic">Delia: a Pathetic and Interesting Tale</span> (1790), have mistakenly been attributed to Mary Pilkington.<br>
