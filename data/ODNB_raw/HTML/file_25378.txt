<span class="headword">Sherlock,  Paul</span>  (1595&#150;1646), <span class="occ">Jesuit and theologian</span>, was born at Waterford on 14 August 1595, the son of Walter Sherlock and Beatrice Leonard. At the age of sixteen he followed his elder brother Patrick to Spain, and entered the Society of Jesus at Salamanca on 30 September 1612. Patrick Sherlock, who had entered the society in 1602, died at Santiago de Compostela in 1614. After studying philosophy at the Jesuit colleges of Valladolid and Santiago, Paul Sherlock was ordained priest at Santiago in 1621. He was preparing to return to Ireland when, in 1624, he was appointed to succeed Thomas White as rector of the Irish College at Santiago, a post which he held until 1628. Subsequently he was rector of the Irish College at Salamanca from 1629 until his death. He was a reluctant rector: both colleges were chronically short of funds, and administration was a burden to him.<br>
<br>Sherlock's lifelong passion was for patristic and scriptural scholarship, which bore fruit in an extended devotional commentary on the <span class="roman">Song of Solomon</span> in three folio volumes, <span class="italic">Anteloquia in Salomonis Canticum Canticorum</span>, later volumes <span class="italic">Cogitationes in Salomonis Canticum Canticorum</span> (Lyons, 1633&#150;40). This magnum opus was reprinted at Venice in 1641, and Sherlock's earnings, together with a generous subsidy from Fernando de Vera, bishop of Cuzco, enabled him to purchase a large library, ownership of which was disputed after his death between the Jesuits of Salamanca and the Irish College. In 1644, under the semi-pseudonym Paulus Leonardus (using his mother's maiden name) and omitting to declare his membership of the Society of Jesus, he published at Lyons <span class="italic">Responsio ad expostulationes recentium theologorum</span>, a defence of the Molinist doctrine of <i>scientia media</i> against its Dominican critics. Discussion of Molina's attempt to reconcile divine foreknowledge with human free will was at the time officially proscribed by Rome. The work was dedicated to Juan de Palafox, bishop of Puebla and virtual viceroy of Mexico, who was a benefactor of the Irish College. Three years later (1647) Palafox was to become embroiled in a bitter dispute with the Society of Jesus.<br>
<br>The strains of office and a lifelong regime of austerity and self-mortification undermined Sherlock's health. He died at the Irish College, Salamanca, on 8 August 1646, and was buried at Salamanca. The first volume of his unfinished treatise on the creation, <span class="italic">Antiquitatum Hebraicarum dioptra</span>, was published posthumously at Lyons in 1651 on the initiative of Luke Wadding, another Waterford man and former rector of the Irish College, Salamanca, to whom the work was dedicated by the publishers. Sherlock's brief manuscript autobiography, relating the principal events of his life up to 1645, was published for the first time in 1917.<br>
