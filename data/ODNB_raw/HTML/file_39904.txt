</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Du Pr&eacute;,  Jacqueline Mary</span>  (1945&#150;1987), <span class="occ">cellist</span>, was born at 165 Banbury Road, Oxford, on 26 January 1945, the younger daughter and the second of the three children of Derek du Pr&eacute;, a financial writer and editor, and Iris Maud, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Greep, a pianist and composer of music for children, who taught at the Royal Academy of Music. The family name has Jersey origins. Jacqueline's precocious musical gifts were quickly recognized by her mother. She received her first cello at four, after hearing the instrument on a BBC <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span> programme, and at five began to have lessons with Alison Dalrymple at Herbert Walenn's London Cello School. Iris du Pr&eacute; further stimulated her daughter's passion for the cello by composing little pieces for her, later published as a collection under the title <span class="italic">Songs for my Cello and me</span>. By the age of six, when she first played in public, Jacqueline was acknowledged as the school's star pupil, combining an extraordinarily acute musical ear with an innate power of communication.<br>
<br>In 1955, when she was ten, Jacqueline was accepted as a pupil by the famous cellist and teacher William Pleeth, with whom she remained for the next seven years. In the following year she won the first Suggia gift, an international cello prize financed by the legacy of the Portuguese cellist Guilhermina Suggia. In his letter of recommendation to the adjudicating panel, chaired by John Barbirolli, Pleeth wrote that his pupil was &#145;the most outstanding cellistic and musical talent that I have met so far, to which she adds incredible maturity of mind. I am of the opinion that she will have a great career&#146;  (Easton, 42). Barbirolli later said that he recognized Jacqueline as the winner from the moment she started playing. She was offered &pound;175 a year to finance her tuition, with the proviso that she did four hours' practice a day. This in turn entailed a special arrangement with her school, Croydon high school, whereby she was excused from certain subjects. Three years later, just before her fifteenth birthday, her parents removed her from school and continued her education at home. By then a career as a cellist looked assured.<br>
<br>In January 1958 Jacqueline made her first appearance on television in a &#145;young people's concert&#146;, playing the first movement of the Lalo concerto. In April that year she again performed on television, this time in the company of her sister Hilary, a talented flautist. As Pleeth's pupil she had become a student at the Guildhall School of Music in London, where she swept up all the available prizes, including the 1960 gold medal. In that same year she also won the Queen's prize, open to British instrumentalists under the age of thirty. Yehudi Menuhin, the chairman of the jury, an important figure in Jacqueline's artistic life over the next few years, later recalled the elation she created &#145;with the excitement of her own joy and intoxication with the music&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 2 March 1960).<br>
<br>In the summer of 1960 Jacqueline took part in Pablo Casals's masterclasses in Zermatt, performing Saint-Sa&euml;ns's A minor cello concerto at the final students' concert. Then, on 1 March 1961, shortly after receiving her first Stradivarius cello as a gift from a godmother, she gave her d&eacute;but recital at the Wigmore Hall in London&#151;a traditional rite of passage for an aspiring professional soloist. The critics were virtually unanimous in their enthusiasm. Martin Cooper, in the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, praised her &#145;ability to carry through a phrase to its very end&#146; and &#145;the vigorous strength of her rhythms&#146;. &#145;Here is a young player&#146;, he wrote, &#145;whose technical accomplishments have not prevented her from being wholly committed to whatever she plays&#151;this is one of the first essentials of a great player&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 2 March 1961).<br>
<br>Her Wigmore Hall d&eacute;but effectively launched Jacqueline's career. She was immediately signed up by London's most prestigious agency, Ibbs and Tillett, and received numerous offers of concerts and broadcasts. She made her first radio recording in March 1961, performing pieces by Handel, de Falla, and Mendelssohn. Her first major orchestral date followed a year later, when she appeared with the BBC Symphony Orchestra at London's Royal Festival Hall in the work with which she was to become most closely identified: the Elgar cello concerto, which she had studied since the age of thirteen and had already performed with the Ernest Read senior orchestra in December 1959. In August 1962 she sealed her association with the Elgar when she played it at her Promenade Concerts d&eacute;but. By popular demand she returned to the Proms for four seasons in succession to play the same concerto, each time with Sir Malcolm Sargent. At this period she also formed a sonata duo with George Malcolm and played in chamber recitals with Yehudi and Hephzibah Menuhin. Jacqueline spent the autumn and winter of 1962&#150;3 in Paris, studying with Paul Tortelier; and although the experience was a mixed success (their forceful artistic personalities were not ideally compatible), the French cellist described her as a phenomenon &#145;who stands out not only for the radiance of her playing, but for her personal radiance as well&#146;  (P. Tortelier and D. Blum, <span class="italic">Paul Tortelier: a Self-Portrait</span>, 1984, 213).<br>
<br>By now a star, Jacqueline formed another duo, with the pianist Stephen Bishop (later Kovacevich), in October 1964; the fruits of their collaboration include a memorable recording of Beethoven's A major and D major cello sonatas. In 1965 she toured the USA and Canada with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, scoring triumphs with her performances of the Elgar concerto in the Carnegie Hall, New York, and elsewhere. The critic in the <span class="italic">New York Herald Tribune</span> (15 May 1965) compared her to Casals and Mstislav Rostropovich, and wondered at the variety and quality of tone &#145;that could be likened to a hand moving alternately from velvet to silk to damask&#146;. By the end of the tour she had sealed her reputation in North America.<br>
<br>The years from 1965 to 1970 marked the zenith of Jacqueline du Pr&eacute;'s career as one of the most exciting and charismatic performers of the day. No contemporary cellist, save perhaps Rostropovich, possessed a more opulent tone, or played with such impassioned, elemental force&#151;an impression enhanced by her trademark swaying and hair-tossing on the concert platform. During these years she recorded much of her repertory, most famously the Elgar concerto with Barbirolli, which became an instant best-seller on its release in December 1965 and has remained so ever since. However, her rapid rise to fame had taken its toll; and amid intensive, joyous activity there were periods when she felt listless and dispirited. In January 1966 she took time off from public performance to study in Moscow with Rostropovich, who introduced her to the Britten cello sonata and works by Shostakovich and Prokofiev. From Moscow she wrote to Yehudi Menuhin:<blockquote>Over the past two years I have felt extremely lost with my work and generally fatigued by it. Now, under Rostropovich's tuition, I am finding a new freshness in it, and the old desire to go ahead with what I love so deeply is returning. (<span class="italic">DNB</span>)</blockquote>At the end of 1966 Jacqueline was introduced to the Argentine-born Israeli pianist and conductor Daniel Barenboim (<i>b</i>. 1942). Their mutual attraction was immediate, and in April 1967 news broke of their engagement. Jacqueline (who had converted to Judaism) and Daniel were married in Jerusalem on 15 June, during the Six Day War. For the next four years the most glamorous couple in the classical music world often performed and recorded together, either as a duo (notably in the Beethoven and Brahms cello sonatas) or with Jacqueline as soloist and Daniel as conductor. The exuberance and spontaneity of their performances, their uncanny intuitive understanding, and their palpable joy in making music together made a profound impression on audiences wherever they played. They were also frequently joined in concert by the young American violinist Pinchas Zukerman, with whom they recorded the complete Beethoven piano trios. In April 1968 Jacqueline premi&egrave;red Alexander Goehr's <span class="italic">Romanza</span> for cello and orchestra, which had been written for her. Otherwise her repertory, while extensive, was essentially conservative, stretching from Bach and Haydn (whose concertos she played with unapologetic subjective expressiveness) to Elgar, Delius, and, on rare occasions, Prokofiev and Shostakovich.<br>
<br>In March 1969, in the midst of an intensive international touring schedule, Jacqueline suffered from a strange bout of numbness which, with hindsight, can be seen as an early manifestation of multiple sclerosis. From this period onwards her playing, while often brilliant and moving, became less reliable. During a tour of the USA in the autumn of 1969, for instance, critics complained of mannerism, distortion, and faulty intonation. Attacks of numbness recurred, and she began to suffer increasingly from fatigue. At the end of 1970, after a demanding tour of the USA, it was clear that Jacqueline was suffering from physical and emotional exhaustion. By now her marriage, too, was under strain. On the brink of a nervous breakdown, she spent several months early in 1971 with her sister Hilary and her husband Christopher (Kiffer) Finzi, first at their farmhouse in Berkshire, then at their mountain home in southern France. Jacqueline became increasingly dependent on her brother-in-law, and during the French holiday they became lovers&#151;an episode made notorious in Amand Tucker's film <span class="italic">Hilary and Jackie</span> of 1998, based on the book <span class="italic">A Genius in the Family</span> (1997) by Hilary and her brother Piers du Pr&eacute;. This revealed the vibrant, sunny Jacqueline of popular perception to have been an altogether more complex figure: depressive, intensely vulnerable, and often unable to cope with the burden of celebrity. Hilary later justified her husband's behaviour as a means of helping her sister through a profound crisis&#151;almost as a form of therapy. Within a year, though, Jacqueline had come to regard her brother-in-law as a man &#145;who wielded his authority in a manipulative way and who had taken advantage of a woman in a distraught state&#146;  (Wilson, 382).<br>
<br>Further alarming signs of Jacqueline's encroaching illness appeared in May 1971 when she cancelled the remainder of a tour of the USA after a performance of the Dvo&#345;&aacute;k B minor cello concerto in California. The official reason was that she was suffering from tenosynovitis, an inflammation of the wrist tendon. She recovered sufficiently by the end of the year to record the Chopin and Franck cello sonatas with Barenboim&#151;her last appearance in a recording studio. By now reconciled with her husband, she gave chamber concerts with Zukerman and Barenboim in Israel and Edinburgh during the summer of 1972, arousing hopes of a permanent recovery. Then in February 1973 she made her concerto &#145;comeback&#146;, playing the Elgar at two concerts in the Royal Festival Hall. Some musicians in the audience noted her problems with bow control, and a tendency to exaggeration, as if to compensate for her technical difficulties. But her vision and powers of communication were, if anything, more intense than ever. The violinist Rodney Friend wrote of her performance: &#145;I have never before or since experienced such absolute giving in music, without any trace of artificiality or superficiality. The pain and suffering in her playing were almost tangible, and it is something for which there is no explanation&#146;  (Wilson, 397).<br>
<br>Immediately after what were to be her last London concerts, Jacqueline embarked on her final tour of the USA. With increasing difficulty she managed three performances of the Brahms &#145;double&#146; concerto (with Zukerman) in New York, but had to cancel a fourth. As Zukerman put it, &#145;she simply didn't have the energy to play any more&#146;. The press reported that the sudden cancellation was due to a disorder of the nerve endings. After extensive tests multiple sclerosis was finally diagnosed in October 1973.<br>
<br>At first Jacqueline hoped to return to a normal life and even resume her concert career. But it soon became obvious that she would never play in public again. After a period of lethargy and acute depression, her spirits revived, and she started to play again at home with friends (including her one-time teacher William Pleeth), teach, and attend concerts. Though largely confined to a wheelchair from 1976, she gave acclaimed public masterclasses, two of which were televised in 1979. In the same year she was the narrator in Barenboim's recording of <span class="italic">Peter and the Wolf</span>. After her enforced withdrawal from the concert platform she was appointed OBE (1976) and received numerous honours, including the &#145;musician of the year&#146; award of the Incorporated Society of Musicians (1980) and honorary doctorates from several British universities. From 1981 her condition deteriorated rapidly; one of the few pleasures of her last years was listening to her own recordings. She died at her home, Flat 28, 36&#150;8 Chepstow Villas, Kensington, London, on 19 October 1987, and was buried at the Jewish cemetery in Golders Green two days later. Her husband survived her. In his funeral address Rabbi Friedlander recalled Jacqueline's courageous words after the onset of her illness: &#145;I was so fortunate to have achieved everything while I was young. I have recorded the full repertoire &hellip; I have no regrets&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 22 Oct 1987).<br>
<br>Among all the many tributes paid to Jacqueline du Pr&eacute;'s art, it was perhaps Christopher Nupen, director of the television film <span class="italic">Jacqueline</span> (1967), who most movingly and truthfully encapsulated her genius:<blockquote>The confidence and sure-footedness in her phrasing which gave her such freedom; her ability to respond to the moment and her apparent total lack of inhibition; these are the qualities that she seems to share more with musicians of the past than the present. And there is something else, a miraculous combination of apparently contradictory qualities. She had the ability to phrase with such natural conviction as to give you the impression that it really should not be done in any other way, and at the same time to make you catch your breath with surprise and delight at an unexpected sound or turn in the phrase. All so natural that it could not be otherwise and yet so surprising that life could suddenly take on a new dimension for a few seconds. (Wordsworth, 111&#150;12)</blockquote>
