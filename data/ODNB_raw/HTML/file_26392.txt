<span class="headword">Stephens,  Robert</span>  (1665&#150;1732), <span class="occ">literary editor</span>, was born in Eastington, Gloucestershire, the fourth son of Richard Stephens (<i>d</i>. 1668), lord of the manor of Eastington, and his wife, Ann Cholmley, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5341/', "Sir Hugh Cholmley")</script> of Whitby, Yorkshire.<br>
<br>In May 1681 Stephens went from Wotton School to Lincoln College, Oxford. In November of that year he was admitted to the Middle Temple and was called to the bar on 14 June 1689. His name is listed among the founders of the Society of Antiquaries of London at its revival in July 1717.<br>
<br>Stephens married Mary Cholmley, the daughter and heir of a later Sir Hugh Cholmley of Whitby and the widow of Nathaniel Cholmley of Leicester. Stephens praised her for her &#145;zeal to serve an incumbred family&#146; by reducing her condition in order to marry him  (will, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/656).<br>
<br>Stephens was appointed solicitor of the customs, and held the post until August 1725, when he signified to the commissioners of the customs his intentions of resigning the office &#145;in respect of some difficulties and disabilities he found himself under&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 36135, fols. 370<i>r</i>&#150;373<i>v</i>). The commissioners, recognizing that his experience would benefit his successor, appointed Stephens as their assistant at a yearly salary of &pound;150. When Thomas Madox died in January 1727 Stephens succeeded him as historiographer royal, a position he was granted &#145;for a Testimony of his Fidelity&#146;  (Bigland, 1.541).<br>
<br>In 1702 Stephens published an edition of the letters of Sir Francis Bacon transcribed from original manuscripts held in private collections. Some of these were probably held by his cousin Robert Harley, later earl of Oxford, to whom he wrote in April 1702 urging him to advertise the edition to his friends by informing them that he had seen the letters and believed them to be genuine. In the preface to this edition Stephens requested access to similar material to furnish a supplementary edition. He appears to have received only one response to this request, which produced insufficient material for a new edition. Some time later, however, his cousin Robert gave him access to further papers, among which Stephens discovered more letters written by Bacon. He believed that it was on these papers that Bacon's chaplain, Dr Rawley, had based his seventeenth-century edition of his works.<br>
<br>Stephens had prepared his supplementary edition of Bacon's letters for the press by the summer of 1732, when ill health forced him to retire to his home in Gloucestershire. John Locker took over the work of editing and correction, and the supplement was eventually published by Stephens's widow in 1734. Before his retirement Stephens had written a preface to the edition in which he castigates at length &#145;a learned and eminent Gentleman&#146; who had employed a &#145;reverend Divine to reduce all the Lord Bacon's works into just Volumes, and print them&#146;. This, according to the preface, was done for profit &#145;rather than the honour of the Author&#146; and the volumes contained material &#145;not fit for publick view&#146;. These volumes were probably those edited by John Blackbourne and printed in 1730 by R. Gosling.<br>
<br>On 12 November 1732, shortly after his retirement to Grovesend, Gloucestershire, Stephens died. He was buried in the parish church at Eastington, where his widow erected a monument in his memory.<br>
<br>His manuscript collection passed to Locker, who died in 1760, and in 1764 it was purchased by Dr Thomas Birch, who used the papers in his own editions of Bacon's works; the collection is now housed in the British Library (Add. MSS 4258&#150;4262).<br>
