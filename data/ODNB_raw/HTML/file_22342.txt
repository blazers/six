<span class="headword">Pittis,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1636, <em>d.</em> 1687), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Niton, Isle of Wight, and baptized there on 28 June 1636, the son of Thomas Pittis, a captain of militia on the Isle of Wight, and his wife, Mary. He matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, on 29 April 1653, and graduated BA on 5 June 1656. He proceeded MA on 29 June 1658, from Lincoln College. The year of his ordination is unrecorded but, by March 1660 he may have been preferred to the rectory of Newport, Isle of Wight by John Worsley, of Gatcombe. On 4 February 1661, at Gatcombe church, he married Elizabeth, daughter of William Stephens of Newport, and in the following year he was appointed rector of this church. In 1665 he graduated BD and the next year was appointed vicar of Holyrood, or St Cross, Southampton. His strong commitment to the crown brought him into conflict with the mayor and corporation of Southampton, which led him to publish the pamphlet <span class="italic">A private conference between a rich alderman and a poor country vicar made publick. Wherein is discoursed the obligation of oaths which have been imposed on the subjects of England. With other matters relating to the present state of affairs</span> (1670).<br>
<br>Such was his steadfastness to crown and church that Pittis was created DD at Oxford, in 1670, and was made a royal chaplain, and the lecturer at Christ Church, Newgate Street, about the same time. He was incorporated MA at Cambridge in 1676. In 1678 he was rector of Lutterworth, Leicestershire, and was then given the far more important appointment of rector of St Botolph without Bishopsgate in 1678. This was one of the London churches still standing after the great fire, although its fabric was deteriorating (it was rebuilt early in the eighteenth century). In this appointment he carried some responsibilities under his lectureship for the spiritual sustenance of the parish of Christ Church, Newgate Street, as well as for the parish of St Leonard, Foster Lane, which had been conjoined under the 1670 &#145;act for the Better Settlement of the Maintenance of the parsons, vicars, and curates in the Parishes of the City of London, burnt by the late dreadful fire there&#146;. Pittis was a sturdy figure in the midst of the chaos of dispossession and rebuilding that was London twelve years after the fire. His two main works (both published in 1683) are important as representing his thoughts on two challenges that loomed large at the time for the self-understanding of the established church in the wake of the Popish Plot and the exclusion crisis&#151;first that of protestant nonconformity, and second that of Roman Catholicism. While the parish system was in effect suspended in the capital city, the pressures upon the Church of England were enormous because without the parish system the identity of the established church was severely undermined.<br>
<br>In a <span class="italic">Discourse Concerning the Trial of Spirits</span> Pittis affirmed the integrity of the gospel message, from which sprang the church, and that the gospel had been legitimated by extraordinary dispensations of the Holy Spirit. But he could not discern anything comparable to give credibility to &#145;Enthusiasts&#146;. In a <span class="italic">Discourse of prayer: wherein this great duty is stated, so as to oppose some principles and practices of papists and fanaticks; as they are contrary to the publick forms of the Church of England, established by her ecclesiastical canons, and confirmed by acts of parliament</span>, Pittis conveyed his conviction that the worship offered to God had to be &#145;proportionate to his being&#146;  (p. 47), and that this could not be achieved by extempore prayer. Essentially he propounded that services without a settled text could not honour God in his revelation, but could only reflect the inevitable limitations of perception of any individual who was attempting to lead worship without a text that had previously been considered and agreed. Pittis also warned against worshipping &#145;a notional Idol&#146;  (p. 63)&#151;a body of ideas held to represent God which could become a substitute for God. This, he felt, was the effect of Roman Catholic doctrine, especially in the tenets of transubstantiation, while such idolatry was concealed by the use of Latin. Both these books proved to be ephemeral and neither was reprinted.<br>
<br>Pittis died intestate on 28 December 1687 and was buried at Niton; administration of his estate was granted to his widow, Elizabeth. He left two sons&#151;Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1669), who became vicar of Warnham, Sussex, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22343/', "William Pittis")</script>&#151;and two daughters&#151;Elizabeth, who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14491/', "Zacheus Isham")</script>, Pittis's successor at St Botolph's, and Catherine.<br>
