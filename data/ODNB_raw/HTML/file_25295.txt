<span class="headword">Sheffield,  George</span>  (1838&#150;1892), <span class="occ">marine and landscape painter</span>, was born on 1 January 1838 at High Street, Wigton, Cumberland, the son of Thomas Sheffield, a draper, and his wife, Jane Johnston. His uncle, George Sheffield (1800&#150;1852), had been a student at the Royal Academy, and had a considerable local reputation as a portrait painter. From him and from Henry Hoodless, also a Wigton resident, Sheffield obtained help in his youthful studies. While still very young he moved with his father to Warrington, where he received his first art teaching from the portrait and genre painter Samuel Luke Fildes RA in the art school of that town. At first Sheffield adopted the sea as a profession, sailing across the Atlantic and to Holland, but after a few years' experience of this life he settled at Manchester, studying in the school of art and becoming a pattern designer with a firm of calico printers. He soon turned his attention to landscape painting, producing with great facility, truth, and beauty, seascapes, coast scenes, and landscapes. Like other Manchester-based artists he spent time painting around Conwy Falls in north Wales.<br>
<br>Sheffield worked in oil and watercolour, and produced some fine works in both mediums, but undoubtedly his forte was the use of monochrome. His drawings in sepia and black and white are remarkable for their variety and delicate beauty of atmospheric effect. He worked with great speed, and produced a vast number of drawings. In 1869 he was elected an associate of the Manchester Academy and a full member in 1871. From 1868 he was a regular exhibitor at all the Manchester and other local exhibitions, and between 1872 and 1890 he showed six pictures at the Royal Academy, including <span class="italic">Lindon Common</span> and <span class="italic">View in the Island of Sark</span>, and eleven at other London exhibitions. Nearly all his best pictures were acquired by Lancashire collectors, including Robert H. Edmondson. There are in Manchester City Galleries two works by Sheffield&#151;an oil painting, <span class="italic">A Hundred Years Ago</span>, and a number of watercolours, including <span class="italic">The Trough of the Sea</span>. Sheffield died in Ancoats Hospital, Mill Street, Manchester, on 2 October 1892. His wife predeceased him; eight children survived him.<br>
