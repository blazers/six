<span class="headword">Vaus <span class="st"> [Vans]</span>, Sir  Patrick</span>, Lord Barnbarroch  (<em>d.</em> 1597), <span class="occ">diplomat and judge</span>, was the second son of Sir John Vaus of Barnbarroch, Wigtownshire, and his wife, Janet, only child of Sir Samuel MacCulloch of Myreton, keeper of the palace of Linlithgow. Vaus was intended for the church and became rector of Wigtown, but succeeded to the family estates on the death of his elder brother, Alexander, in 1568; he later (May 1580) granted a nineteen-year &#145;tack&#146; of the parsonage and vicarage of Wigtown.<br>
<br>Vaus was threatened with escheat in October 1570 for absenting himself from the royal host, but on 1 January 1576 he was appointed an ordinary lord of session, with the title Lord Barnbarroch. By 1580 he had married Katherine Kennedy (<i>d</i>. in or after 1593), and they had four sons: his heir, John, later one of the gentlemen of the chamber to James VI, and Patrick, Robert, and Alexander. Vaus also had a natural son, Richard, who was granted precept of legitimation on 1 May 1577. Probably knighted in the 1580s, Vaus was admitted on 21 April 1587 to membership of the privy council, and in the following month he and Peter Young went on embassy to Denmark to arrange for the marriage of James VI with Anne of Denmark; Vaus later accompanied James VI to Norway and witnessed the marriage, on 23 November 1589. In October 1589 the king granted him a new charter of his lands in <i>blench ferm</i> in recognition of his services in Denmark, incorporated in the free barony of Bar. In August 1591 these lands were incorporated into the free barony of Barnbarroch. However, Vaus evidently had trouble collecting taxes assigned to him in Kyle Stewart on account of &#145;expenssis maid at his ambassadrie&#146;, as he complained to the privy council in February 1589  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 353).<br>
<br>In the parliaments of 1592 and 1593 Vaus was elected a lord of the articles, while in June 1592 he was granted an annual pension of &pound;200 Scots. In January 1597, when the king returned to Edinburgh after the previous month's anti-Catholic riot, Vaus was among those called upon to attend James in arms at the &#145;mercat croce&#146; for &#145;reduceing of certane disordourit personis &hellip; to his Majesteis obediens&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 355). Vaus died, presumably in Edinburgh, later that year, on 22 July 1597.<br>
