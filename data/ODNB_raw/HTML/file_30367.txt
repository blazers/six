<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blake, Dame  Louisa Brandreth  Aldrich-</span>  (1865&#150;1925), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born on 15 August 1865, at the rectory, Chingford, Essex, eldest daughter and second of six children of the Revd Frederick James Aldrich-Blake 
    (formerly Aldrich; 1824&#150;1904)
  , rector of Chingford, and his wife, Louisa Blake Morrison (<i>d</i>. 1918). The surname of Blake was assumed by her father on his marriage. Soon after Louisa's birth her father was appointed rector of Welsh Bicknor in Herefordshire. Here she spent her childhood and retained a home throughout her life. She went to school in Great Malvern and Neuch&acirc;tel, and then attended Cheltenham Ladies' College. In 1887 she entered the London School of Medicine for Women, graduating MB from London University in 1892 with first-class honours in medicine and obstetrics and BS with first-class honours in 1893. She obtained her MD (London) in 1894 and in 1895 became the first woman to obtain the master of surgery (MS).<br>
<br>Determined on a career in general surgery Miss Aldrich-Blake was appointed, in 1895, as assistant surgeon to the New Hospital for Women (a hospital staffed only by medical women, later renamed the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital). She subsequently became senior and then consulting surgeon there. Also in 1895 she was the first woman appointed as anaesthetist to the Royal Free Hospital, the teaching hospital for the London School of Medicine for Women. In 1896 she was appointed surgical registrar at the Royal Free, again the first woman to hold the post. In 1919 she was appointed consulting surgeon there, a position she held until her death. She was also consultant to the Canning Town Women's Settlement Hospital in east London from 1897 to 1920. A landowner with private means she never made a large income from her professional practice. Miss Aldrich-Blake published little but was widely respected for her excellent judgement in surgery. She was one of the first surgeons in Britain to undertake Wertheim's operation for carcinoma of the cervix. In 1910 she was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine.<br>
<br>For most of her professional life Miss Aldrich-Blake was closely associated with the London School of Medicine for Women, being appointed vice-dean in 1906 and dean in 1914. Under her leadership the school almost doubled in size during the First World War, as many young women sought a medical training to make their contribution to the war effort. Miss Aldrich-Blake was herself heavily involved in medical women's war efforts, over and above her roles as medical school dean and consultant surgeon. She helped organize a woman-staffed hospital in Cherbourg in 1914 and worked there in her vacation. In 1915 and 1916 she spent her vacations working at the Anglo-French Red Cross Hospital run by Dr Frances Ivens in Royaumont where she was dubbed &#145;Madame la G&eacute;n&eacute;rale&#146; by the patients  (Crofton, 58). In 1916 she organized two major initiatives to recruit medical women for war service overseas. She was also visiting surgeon at the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps Hospital in Isleworth during the war years.<br>
<br>Miss Aldrich-Blake was not a campaigning feminist but aimed to establish women's equality with men through professional example, a message she stressed to her students. Miss Aldrich-Blake was noted for her quietness, her readiness to help young women surgeons in their work and as an outstanding administrator and financial planner. She was founding treasurer of the Medical Women's Federation from 1917. After the war ended she was a prime mover in the substantial enlargement of both the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and the Royal Free hospitals. In 1925, the year of the London School of Medicine's golden jubilee, she was made DBE. Louisa Aldrich-Blake died of cancer on 28 December 1925 at her London home, 17 Nottingham Place, Marylebone, having been engaged in surgery up to the last six weeks of her life. Her funeral was held on 1 January 1926 in St Pancras Church, London, close to the women's medical school and the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and Royal Free hospitals. Her ashes were taken to her country home in Welsh Bicknor.<br>
