<span class="headword">Aldred,  Cyril</span>  (1914&#150;1991), <span class="occ">Egyptologist and art historian</span>, was born on 19 February 1914 at 41 Beltran Road, Fulham, London, the fifth of the six children of Frederick Aldred, a civil servant, and his wife, Lilian Ethel Underwood. Educated at the Sloane School, Chelsea, he then read English for a year at King's College, London, and art history at the Courtauld Institute of Art. He took his BA degree in 1936. In the following year he was appointed an assistant keeper in the Royal Scottish Museum, Edinburgh, where he remained until his retirement in 1974, apart from the years of the Second World War when he served in the RAF. He was keeper of art and archaeology from 1961 to 1974. On 28 May 1938 he married Jessie Kennedy Morton (<i>b</i>. 1908/9), masseuse, with whom he had a daughter.<br>
<br>In 1949 Aldred published a small popular monograph, <span class="italic">Old Kingdom Art in Ancient Egypt</span>, a seemingly modest survey of the first important period of Egyptian art. Two subsequent volumes on the art of the middle kingdom and the new kingdom (1950, 1952) established him as an art historian of significant potential. His interest in Egypt dated back to his schooldays. Meetings with Howard Carter, discoverer of the tomb of Tutankhamun, in 1933 led to an invitation to spend a season with him in Egypt. Carter wrote: &#145;I have found him to have a very fair knowledge of Egyptological subjects especially that of Egyptian Art&#146;  (priv. coll.).<br>
<br>Aldred did not take up Carter's offer, but he retained his interest in Egyptian art and began to develop it seriously when he returned to Edinburgh in 1946. The Egyptian collection in the Royal Scottish Museum was small but diverse, containing some important pieces which gave Aldred the scope to mount unusually good exhibitions. He took a special interest in materials and technologies, and was invited to write chapters on fine woodwork and furniture in the Oxford <span class="italic">History of Technology</span> (2 vols., 1954&#150;6), significant and innovative studies, based on a close examination of original Egyptian material. His later <span class="italic">Jewels of the Pharaohs</span> (1971), although written for a popular readership, contained an authoritative examination of materials, techniques, and designs which was again based on close study of originals, especially those in Cairo and New York, and on his own experience as a practical jeweller.<br>
<br>By establishing friendly and fruitful contacts with colleagues throughout the Egyptological world Aldred was able to pursue vigorously his developing sculptural studies, at the same time enhancing his international standing. In 1955 he accepted an invitation to spend a year as an associate curator in the department of Egyptian art in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. There he had the opportunity to enlarge his experience of Egyptian antiquities in one of the best Egyptian collections in the world, with a fine library and very congenial colleagues. William C. Hayes, the departmental curator, had hopes that Aldred might be groomed as his successor, but the latter's attachment to Edinburgh drew him back to Scotland in 1956, a substantially more mature scholar with particular interests in Egyptian sculpture and in the controversial Amarna period, the reign of the so-called heretic king Akhenaten.<br>
<br>It was in Egyptian sculpture that Cyril Aldred made his most enduring contributions to Egyptian art history. His articles were well argued and elegantly written, but it is a matter of great regret that he never wrote a comprehensive work on Egyptian statuary. His <span class="italic">Egyptian Art</span> (1980) was a popular account with little room for close argument. Essays on Egyptian sculpture in the three Egyptian volumes of Andr&eacute; Malraux's <span class="italic">L'univers des formes</span> (1978, 1979, 1980) represent his most complete exposition of the subject. But his most important art-historical writing is contained in <span class="italic">Akhenaten and Nefertiti</span>, the volume which accompanied an exhibition in the Brooklyn Museum in 1973. Here he brought a systematization to a confused subject, Amarna art, and in so doing contributed substantially to the elucidation of many of the historical problems of that vexed period.<br>
<br>The Amarna period engrossed Aldred's scholarly attention for much of his active career. Particular aspects of the period and its protagonist Akhenaten were explored in articles and in <span class="italic">Akhenaten, Pharaoh of Egypt</span> (1968): the pathology of Akhenaten, family relationships, and the question of coregency. His views were restated with vigour in his last work, <span class="italic">Akhenaten, King of Egypt</span> (1988).<br>
<br>Beyond Egyptology and his duties in the Royal Scottish Museum, Cyril Aldred pursued many private interests, not least of which was the writing of occasional light verse, much of it composed for meetings of the Monks of St Giles, an Edinburgh dining club. He did not enjoy conventional lecturing, but excelled in less formal presentations, as on Nile cruises on which, as guest lecturer, he delighted his fellow travellers with his witty and well-informed talks. His distinction in Scottish intellectual life was recognized in 1978 when he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. A volume of essays, <span class="italic">Chief of Seers</span> (1997), written for him by colleagues, was published some years after his death. Cyril Aldred died at his home, 4A Polwarth Terrace, Edinburgh, on 23 June 1991, survived by his wife and their daughter.<br>
