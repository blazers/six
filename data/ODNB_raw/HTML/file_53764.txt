<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mehmet Ali</span>  (<em>c.</em>1769&#150;1849), <span class="occ">Ottoman viceroy and founder of the Egyptian royal family</span>, was born in the Macedonian port of Kavalla, though the actual date of his birth has been obscured. Mehmet Ali himself often gave the date as 1769, the year in which both Napoleon and Wellington were born. Son of Ibrahim Agha, commander of a detachment of infantry irregulars and part-time tobacco merchant, and Khadra, a colonel's daughter in Kavalla, there is no record of Mehmet Ali's siblings. His father is said to have been of Albanian extraction, his mother a native of Kavalla. As Ottoman governor of Egypt (1805&#150;48) Mehmet Ali oversaw a radical restructuring of the province's administration and economy which transformed Egypt into a regional power. At its height, Mehmet Ali's empire embraced the Red Sea coast of Arabia, the Sudan, Crete, and all of greater Syria. His expansionism led him into direct conflict with Lord Palmerston in the two Syrian campaigns (1831&#150;3 and 1840), defining moments of British policy towards the Eastern question. Though ultimately divested of his holdings beyond the frontiers of Egypt and the Sudan, Mehmet Ali succeeded in establishing a hereditary governorship which set Egypt on a course of autonomy from the Ottoman empire.<br>
<br>There is little in his upbringing to recommend Mehmet Ali for such greatness. His early training in the tobacco trade was combined with a military career, much like his father. He entered state service against Aegean corsairs at seventeen, and married his only wife, Amina, soon after. The couple had three sons and two daughters: Ibrahim (<i>b</i>. 1789/90), Ahmad Tosun (<i>b</i>. 1793), Isma&#145;il Kamil (<i>b</i>. 1795), Tevhide (<i>b</i>. 1797), and Nazli (<i>b</i>. 1799). He never took another wife, but Mehmet Ali had a further seventeen sons and thirteen daughters with a series of concubines&#151;the last when he was in his sixties&#151;yet he was survived by only three sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>In March 1801 Mehmet Ali landed in Egypt as second in command of an Albanian detachment with the Anglo-Ottoman force dispatched to evacuate the survivors of Napoleon's ill-fated French expedition of 1798 to 1801. He took command of the Albanian force and entered the political struggle between the Ottoman governor and the Mamluk households. With the support of the notability of Cairo he ultimately won the governorship of Egypt in May 1805, a post he would retain for the next forty-three years. In his first six years in office he faced opposition from the Mamluk military households that had been displaced by the French, and from the British government who feared the return of the French and considered the Mamluks as the only basis for effective local government. A British force landed in Alexandria to support a sympathetic Mamluk coalition in a bid to overthrow Mehmet Ali in March 1807. A column of 1400 soldiers under the command of General Fraser moved on Rosetta where, abandoned by their Mamluk allies, they met strong local resistance and were forced to retreat. Mehmet Ali dispatched troops to engage the British forces in a second attempt on Rosetta in April in which some 400 British soldiers were killed and a similar number taken prisoner. The survivors retreated to Alexandria, whence they entered into negotiations for a release of prisoners in exchange for the withdrawal of the British force from Alexandria, which was concluded on 14 September 1807.<br>
<br>This victory strengthened Mehmet Ali's domestic position and by 1811 he was sufficiently confident to attempt campaigns abroad. That year, at the request of Sultan Mahmud II, he sent an army headed by his son Tosun to Arabia to restore the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to Ottoman rule, and in 1820 he sent a campaign force to occupy the Sudan. In 1822 the sultan turned to his governor in Egypt for assistance in suppressing the Greek insurrection. The Egyptian army was first sent to occupy Crete (1822&#150;4), and then to quell the rebellion in Morea. The campaign force of 30,000 men and 200 vessels reached Athens by 5 June 1827, and both Crete and Morea were added to Mehmet Ali's domains.<br>
<br>Britain and France were divided in their policies towards Mehmet Ali. Extensive French technical assistance to Egypt led Britain to view Mehmet Ali as a French client astride a strategic route between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. British policy towards the Egyptians in Greece was also coloured by philhellenism at home, which had been intensified by the poetry (and death) of Lord Byron. These differences would prove an enduring tension in Anglo-French relations, though in 1827 the powers agreed to take joint action in Greece. A fleet was dispatched, led by Admiral Codrington, which destroyed the Egyptian and Ottoman ships anchored at Navarino (20 October 1827) and negotiated the repatriation of the surviving forces of Mehmet Ali's eldest son, Ibrahim Pasha, to Egypt. Mehmet Ali sought compensation for his sacrifices in Greece with new territory in Syria. When this was denied him by Mahmud, the viceroy re-equipped his armed forces and sent an expedition up the Palestine coast in October 1831, again under Ibrahim Pasha's command. The Egyptian army not only conquered all of greater Syria over the next ten months, but also swept across Anatolia to within 100 miles of the Ottoman capital of Constantinople. The first &#145;Syrian crisis&#146; revealed the vulnerability of Ottoman territorial integrity and was instrumental in shaping British policy towards the Eastern question. Secretary of state Palmerston, faced with French support for Mehmet Ali and Russian interests in gaining access to the Dardanelles, feared that European ambitions in Ottoman territories could provoke conflict between the powers.<br>
<br>In May 1838 Mehmet Ali informed the British and French consuls of his intention to seek independence from the Ottoman empire, prompting the Ottoman army to move against the Egyptians at Nasib (24 June 1839). The Ottoman army was defeated, the sultan died suddenly before hearing the news, and the Ottoman fleet reacted to the power vacuum by defecting to the Egyptian navy. Palmerston rallied Austria, Russia, and Prussia to back the young Sultan Abdul Mejid, who offered Mehmet Ali hereditary rule over Egypt and southern Syria in exchange for a withdrawal from northern Syria. Mehmet Ali refused the terms, and Palmerston responded by ordering a blockade of Syrian ports and inciting local rebellions against Egyptian rule. The British fleet, under Admiral Napier, then bombarded Egyptian forces in Beirut (11 September 1840), and an Anglo-Ottoman force landed to force an Egyptian retreat. Egypt's relations with the Ottoman empire were regulated in an imperial decree (1 June 1841) conferring hereditary rule over Egypt to Mehmet Ali's line, and stripping him of all other possessions except the Sudan.<br>
<br>Mehmet Ali, now in his seventies, attempted no further reforms. His physical and mental health deteriorated until, in 1847, his son Ibrahim assumed control over Egypt. Ibrahim, who was terminally ill, died, passing the succession to his nephew, Mehmet Ali's grandson Abbas, in December 1848. Mehmet Ali himself died in Alexandria on 2 August 1849 and was buried in the Cairo Citadel in the mosque which bears his name.<br>
