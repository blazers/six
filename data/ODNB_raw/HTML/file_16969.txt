<span class="headword">Long,  James</span>  (1814&#150;1887), <span class="occ">missionary and Indian scholar</span>, was born in Bandon, co. Cork, the eldest son of John Long, clerk and Methodist local preacher. While a pupil at Bandon grammar school he excelled in classics and developed an interest in languages. He also came under the influence of the evangelical revival of the time, and was converted at a Wesleyan Methodist meeting at the age of fourteen&#151;an experience which determined the direction of his future career. After volunteering for service with the Church Missionary Society (CMS) in 1838, he was sent to its training institution at Islington, London, where he impressed the principal, the Revd C. F. Childe, with his extensive knowledge of languages. He was ordained deacon in the Church of England in 1839 and priest in the following year, shortly before his departure for India in July 1840. He acted as superintendent of the CMS Anglo-vernacular school at Mizapore, Calcutta, for most of the period between 1840 and 1849. He married Emily Orme (<i>d</i>. 1867) on 10 June 1848; they had no children.<br>
<br>Although a friend and admirer of the Scottish missionary Dr Alexander Duff, Long became increasingly disillusioned with education through English as an instrument of evangelism and as a means of creating a class who would spread knowledge and enlightenment among the masses. While acting as pastor at Thakurpukur, a small village a few miles south of Calcutta, he experimented with methods of improving elementary vernacular education, illustrating his teaching by referring to familiar objects of everyday life and to local proverbs, metaphors, and similes. His innovative methods, emphasis on practical subjects, and introduction of a broad academic syllabus, including geography, history, and science, showed what might be done through the utilization and improvement of the traditional village system. Long's schools, acclaimed as model institutions, combined with his own arguments and lobbying of government officials, influenced the Bengal government's educational policy in the 1850s and 1860s, especially its attempts to develop the &#145;circle school system&#146;. Increasingly convinced of the importance of conveying Christian &#145;truths&#146; and Western scientific ideas and learning through the idiomatic language of ordinary people, Long was active on a large number of influential committees which were attempting to develop and disseminate a &#145;sound&#146; vernacular literature. He was a member of the Calcutta School Book Society, the Vernacular Translation Committee, the Calcutta Auxiliary Bible Society, and the Calcutta Christian Tract and Book Society, for which he wrote an unusually sympathetic life of Muhammad founded exclusively on Arabic sources. In addition he greatly extended the work of collecting and publishing collections of Bengali proverbs and soon became the best-known authority on the subject.<br>
<br>Long wrote on both historical and social issues. He believed that knowledge was the basis of real sympathy and that the study of society provided essential insights into the condition of the people and a meaningful basis for both Christian mission and social improvement. He was one of the founders of sociology in India. When Duff reorganized the Bethune Society in 1860 Long pioneered the branch dealing with sociology, and when Mary Carpenter visited Bengal in 1866 Long was largely instrumental in persuading her to found a branch of the Social Science Association in Calcutta&#151;an organization he continued to support until his retirement.<br>
<br>Long, whose attacks in 1859 on European racism and claims to cultural superiority infuriated some of the Europeans in Calcutta, was further involved in controversy in the 1860s. In evidence before the indigo commission of 1860 he claimed, on the basis of vernacular publications, that few words could describe the state of feeling against the European planters in the indigo districts. In 1861 he received a copy of a vernacular play, <span class="italic">Nil darpan, or, Mirror of Indigo</span>, and brought it to the attention of government officials as, in his view, it reflected feelings which he feared would lead to further violence and bloodshed. The play attacked all involved in the indigo business and was extremely popular in indigo districts; it was written by Dinabhandu Mitra and purported to show the devastating effect of the indigo system on the life and livelihood of a peasant family. Seton-Karr, secretary to the Bengal government, asked Long to prepare a translation. When this was completed by Michael Datta (under Long's instructions) and after Long himself added a preface in which he declared that the effects of the indigo system were pointed out in language &#145;plain but true&#146;, Seton-Karr had the play and preface circulated under government frank. The planters, already shaken by the findings of the commission, were furious. Having failed to obtain the names of the government officials responsible for &#145;a foul and malicious libel&#146; on the planters of Lower Bengal, they sought to discredit the government by indicting Long for libel in the supreme court of Calcutta in July 1861. After a trial which was characterized by the ineffectiveness of the counsel for the defence and the extreme partiality of Sir Mordaunt Wells, the presiding judge, whose violent language shocked even some of the planters, Long was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 1000 rupees and a month's imprisonment.<br>
<br>Kaliprosanna Sinha, a well-known Bengali writer and millionaire stepped forward immediately and paid the fine. Government officials, missionaries, and Bengalis of all religious persuasions visited Long in prison. Before the imprisonment and even outside Bengal he was regarded as &#145;one of the best friends of the peasantry&#146;, and addresses of sympathy and support came from associations and meetings in cities as far away as Allahabad, Madras, and Bombay. These events, which made Long a popular, India-wide hero, coincided with the beginnings of nationalist sentiment and gave him a degree of access into all levels of Indian society probably unprecedented for a European in the 1860s.<br>
<br>Owing to ill health Long was forced to return to England in 1872. However, while in retirement he continued to campaign on Indian issues and was able to consolidate his links with Russia. His first visit to Russia had been in 1863 when, after the publicity surrounding his imprisonment, he was invited by liberal reformers within the administration to visit the country and report on the progress of serf emancipation. The report of his findings was published in a series of articles in the <span class="italic">Anti-Slavery Reporter</span> in 1864. On later visits to Russia in 1872 and 1876 he made further enquiries into the condition of the peasantry, including the progress of education and spread of the Christian literature among them. While his writings on the similarities between India's and Russia's social systems reflect his interest in comparative sociology, his basic concern was, as hitherto, with the social and religious improvement of the masses. He dwelt on the improvement of collaboration between the Anglican and Orthodox churches and on the need for a greater understanding in England of Russia's civilizing and Christianizing mission in central Asia, a process which he argued was a major factor in the containment of Islam.<br>
<br>In England, Long was a member of the Royal Asiatic Society and a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. A short time before his death he assigned to the Church Missionary Society &pound;2000 to provide popular lectures on the religions of the East. He died at his residence, 3 Adam Street, Adelphi, London, on 23 March 1887.<br>
