<span class="headword">Marged ferch Ifan</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1696, <em>d.</em> 1793), <span class="occ">harpist and wrestler</span>, was probably born in Beddgelert, Caernarvonshire, and baptized in the parish church on 10 May 1696, one of at least eleven children born to Ifan Powell and his wife, Elizabeth Hughes. She became known far beyond Wales after Thomas Pennant published a lively description of her in his <span class="italic">Tours in Wales</span> (1778&#150;81), but local oral tradition has also preserved many tales which grew up around her, many of them no less attractive for being impossible to verify. All sources, however, describe her as a large and exceptionally strong woman, a great weightlifter who could wrestle any man to the ground, so that even when she was seventy years old the young men of the district treated her with respect. Her husband, the harpist Richard Morris (<i>d</i>. 1786), was much slighter and no match for her, which suggests that it was she who courted him, for few suitors dared approach her. She is said to have given Richard Morris two severe beatings: after the first he married her, on 8 May 1717 in Beddgelert, and after the second he joined the Methodists.<br>
<br>The couple went to keep an inn called Telyrni between Nantlle and Drws-y-coed, in the parish of Llandwrog. The inn was frequented mainly by the local copper miners, and Marged ferch Ifan played the harp to entertain them. Tradition has it that some of her customers composed extempore two of the surviving <i>penillion telyn</i> (popular stanzas for the harp), celebrating her two harps and two bellows.<br>
<br>The decline of the copper mine forced the couple to give up the Telyrni inn, of which no trace now remains. Some time before 1764 they moved to Pen-llyn, a house at the north-western end of Padarn Lake in the parish of Llanddeiniolen. Marged became a boat builder and transported copper ore in a boat from the foot of Snowdon across lakes Peris and Padarn to Cwm-y-glo, where it was loaded onto carts to be transported to the coast. According to one anecdote, she took out in her boat one day the local landowner and industrialist Thomas Assheton Smith of Vaenol (1752&#150;1828), who made sexual advances to her. Quick as a flash she picked him up and dropped him in the lake. When he rose to the surface and begged her to pull him out she refused until he paid her half a guinea.<br>
<br>Marged ferch Ifan, whom Pennant calls &#145;Queen of the Lake&#146;, was out when he called at Pen-llyn in 1786, but he seems to be relying on a local informant when he states that she was a remarkable hunter, keeping a dozen hounds, played traditional Welsh airs on the fiddle as well as the harp, made harps and her own shoes, and shod her own horses. Her strength was legendary, for she is also remembered locally for making the Pont Meibion slate bridge at Nant Peris, she alone lifting one end of the huge slab and several young men the other.<br>
<br>At least three children, a son and two daughters, were born to Marged ferch Ifan. Although some sources claim that she died in 1801 at the age of 105, in fact she died in January 1793 at Pen-llyn and was buried on 24 January in Llanddeiniolen churchyard. W. R. Ambrose quotes English verses which he claims were inscribed on her gravestone, but their authenticity is highly questionable and the stone does not survive.<br>
