<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Murray, Sir  John</span>  (1841&#150;1914), <span class="occ">marine scientist and oceanographer</span>, was born at Cobourg, Ontario on 3 March 1841, the second son of Robert Murray, an accountant from Scotland who had settled in Upper Canada about 1834, and his wife, Elizabeth Macfarlane. He attended public school in London, Ontario, and later studied at Victoria College, Cobourg. At the age of seventeen he went to Scotland to complete his education under the care of his maternal grandfather, John Macfarlane, of Coney Hill, Stirlingshire. Murray attended the high school at Stirling and afterwards studied at the University of Edinburgh. His name appears on the university rolls for two periods, 1864&#150;5 and 1868&#150;72. He began his studies as a medical student but attended classes in the subjects which appealed to him; he never took examinations and did not graduate. In 1868, Murray shipped as surgeon on the whaler <i>Jan Mayen</i>. During seven months' voyage in northern seas he reached a latitude of 81&deg; N, explored part of Spitsbergen, and landed on Jan Mayen Island. He returned with a collection of marine organisms and also records of observations on currents, on the temperature of the air and of the sea, and on the distribution of sea ice.<br>
<br>On his return to Edinburgh Murray found congenial conditions in the physics laboratory and studied there until 1872, under Peter Guthrie Tait, doing experimental work on thermal conductivity and on the construction of an electrical deep-sea thermometer. In 1872 he took a considerable share in the preparation of the scientific apparatus for the <i>Challenger</i> expedition, intended scientifically to explore the world oceans under the direction of Charles Wyville Thomson (1830&#150;1882), professor of natural history in the University of Edinburgh. When a vacancy on the expedition's staff unexpectedly arose he was appointed, almost at the last moment, one of the naturalists, and this led to the great work of his life.<br>
<br>During the <i>Challenger's</i> voyage&#151;which lasted nearly three and a half years&#151;the physics, chemistry, geology and biology of the great ocean basins were investigated, especially those of the deep sea, about which little was known. Murray devoted himself particularly to near-surface plankton organisms, especially the foraminifera and radiolaria, and to the study of ocean floor sediments. He demonstrated the part played by near-surface foraminifera in forming deep-sea globigerina ooze. He also worked on improvements in sediment samplers, the sounding apparatus, and deep-sea thermometers. Thomson put Murray in charge of the collections&#151;unrivalled in range and importance&#151;made during the expedition. Shortly after their return, the &#145;<i>Challenger</i> office&#146; was opened at 32 Queen Street, Edinburgh, to deal with the collections, and for nearly twenty years this was the place to which marine scientists from all over the world went to work and to discuss the results of the expedition. Murray was appointed chief assistant in the office and, owing to Thomson's failing health, became responsible for organizing the study of the collections.<br>
<br>In 1882, after Thomson's death, Murray became director of the office and editor of the <span class="italic">Report on the Scientific Results of the Voyage of HMS Challenger</span> (1880&#150;95). In fifty volumes, this was the work of experts from many countries, their labours co-ordinated and encouraged by Murray. During the later years of this period Murray's task was made difficult by an unsympathetic Treasury, particularly when the completion of the report was long overdue, and he spent a large amount of his own money in completing the publication.<br>
<br>During much of this time Murray and his friend Professor A. F. Renard, of Ghent, studied the marine sediments. In 1891 their report, <span class="italic">Deep Sea Deposits</span>, was published, establishing the general classification of deep-sea sediments that was still being used, over one hundred years later. As a result of this work, samples of sediments obtained by surveying ships and by various expeditions after <i>Challenger</i> were sent to Murray, creating a unique collection. Another result of Murray's observations during the expedition was his well-known paper &#145;The structure and origin of coral reefs and islands&#146;  (<span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh</span>, 10, 1880), in which he disagreed with Darwin's view that the form of atolls was due to subsidence of the land forming the foundation of the reef. Murray put forward the view that coral reefs formed where sediments accumulated on banks and submarine peaks. He held that as coral colonies approached the surface of the sea they assumed the atoll form owing to the more abundant supply of food and more vigorous growth on the outer margin, and to the removal of dead coral from the interior by currents and by dissolution of calcium carbonate. Murray's work stimulated several decades of research on coral reefs and the formation of atoll lagoons, but had to give ground to Charles Darwin's explanation that reefs formed on subsiding pedestals. Murray was joint author of the <span class="italic">Narrative of the Cruise of HMS Challenger</span> (1885), and he drew up the last two volumes of the <span class="italic">Report</span> (1895), which form an impressive summary of the results of the expedition, and in which he reviewed comprehensively the history of oceanography.<br>
<br>In 1880 and 1882 Murray and Captain T. H. Tizard explored the Faeroe Channel in the government surveying ships <i>Knight Errant</i> and <i>Triton</i>. They demonstrated the existence of the Wyville Thomson Ridge, between Scotland and the Faeroe Islands, which accounted for differences in bottom temperatures and faunas first noted in 1868 by Wyville Thomson and W. B. Carpenter. He established small marine laboratories at Granton and at Millport (1885); the latter developed into the laboratory of the Scottish Marine Biological Association. Murray's steam yacht, <i>Medusa</i>, built and equipped for marine biological work, enabled him with the help of several younger colleagues to carry out marine research along the west coast of Scotland between 1883 and 1894. The results were published in 1918 by his former secretary, James Chumley, with the title <span class="italic">The Fauna of the Clyde Sea Area</span>.<br>
<br>Two years after the <i>Challenger</i> reports were finished Murray undertook a bathymetrical survey of the freshwater lochs of Scotland with a capable young collaborator, Frederick Pullar. Several important papers on the results had appeared when in 1901 Pullar was drowned while attempting to save the lives of others. His father&#151;Laurence Pullar, Murray's oldest friend&#151;was determined that the survey should be continued, and provided funds for a staff of assistants; they began work in 1902 and carried on the investigations until 1909. Some 60,000 soundings were made in 562 lochs, and the records of these and of other scientific results, forming the most extensive limnological survey anywhere to that date, were published in six volumes by Murray and Pullar in 1910.<br>
<br>When the <i>Challenger</i> office was closed (in 1895) Murray bought a house, Villa Medusa, near his residence Challenger Lodge, in Wardie, near Granton, to serve as a library and laboratory. This housed Murray's samples of oceanic sediments, <i>Challenger</i> samples and records until 1921, when the collections and the greater part of his library were moved to the British Museum (Natural History); it was also the headquarters of the lochs survey. Like the <i>Challenger</i> office previously, Murray's home and laboratory attracted a stream of scientific visitors and collaborators.<br>
<br>As the result of his detection of calcium phosphate in rock specimens brought in 1887 from Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean, Murray urged the annexation of the island, which took place the next year. In 1891 Murray and G. Clunies Ross, of the Cocos Islands, obtained a lease of Christmas Island, and in 1897 they formed a company to develop its mineral resources. Murray also paid the expenses of two scientific expeditions to the island in 1897&#150;8 and 1908. Following the first expedition, Murray married, in 1889, Isabel, only daughter of Thomas Henderson, shipowner, of Glasgow; they had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>As a result of the first expedition Dr C. W. Andrews of the British Museum (Natural History), brought home extensive collections. <span class="italic">A Monograph of Christmas Island</span> (1900), which gives the results of the first expedition, is important as a record of the indigenous fauna and flora of an isolated tropical island before human contact. Murray himself made two exploring visits (1900, 1908) to the island. He claimed that the Treasury had received from the island in the form of rents, royalties, and taxes a sum exceeding the cost of the <i>Challenger</i> expedition and the publication of its results. This was an exaggeration in his time, but true by the 1920s.<br>
<br>In 1909 Murray visited Copenhagen and urged upon the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea the need for an oceanographic expedition to the north Atlantic. Shortly thereafter, he offered to pay the operating expenses of a four-month expedition on condition that the Norwegian government lent the research vessel <i>Michael Sars</i> and her scientific staff for the purpose. The offer was accepted, and in April 1910 the vessel left Plymouth with Murray on board and with the Norwegian marine biologist Dr Johan Hjort as leader of the scientific staff. The immediate results of this expedition&#151;including important physical and biological observations at all depths between Europe and North America&#151;were published in <span class="italic">The Depths of the Ocean</span> by Murray and Hjort in 1912; this volume summarized the oceanography of its era and served as a text for many years.<br>
<br>A description of 1426 samples of deposits from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, gathered during thirty-five cruising expeditions between 1857 and 1911, was being prepared under Murray's supervision at the time of his death. The work was completed by James Chumley, who added a discussion of the results, and the monograph was published (1924) in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh</span>.<br>
<br>Murray received honorary degrees from several universities, was elected FRS in 1896, and created KCB in 1898. From 1896 to 1898 he was scientific member of the fishery board for Scotland, and he filled various offices in the scientific societies of Edinburgh. His recreations were yachting&#151;during which he carried on soundings, dredging, and other observations&#151;golf, and motoring. He was killed in a motor accident at Kirkliston, near Edinburgh, on 16 March 1914.<br>
<br>The exploration of the deep sea during the late nineteenth century is due largely to Wyville Thomson and John Murray. Murray left an enduring mark on the science of oceanography through his research, his influence on others, and through his estate, which funded the John Murray expedition to the Indian Ocean in 1933 and the John Murray travelling studentships which began in 1948. He was an original, suggestive, broad-minded thinker and did not hesitate to attack established views if they did not coincide with his conclusions. A strong and forceful personality, he was confident of his own opinion and somewhat brusque, occasionally domineering, in manner, but full of good humour, and most helpful and friendly to his assistants and to other investigators who sought his aid. To a large degree it was his influence that transformed oceanography from a patchwork of unrelated disciplines into a coherent science.<br>
