<span class="headword">Briwes <span class="st"> [Brywes]</span>, Sir  Robert  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1275/6), <span class="occ">justice</span>, has often in the past been the victim of a confusion of identities, his toponymic surname Briwes or Brywes having caused him to be linked with the Brus family which claimed the Scottish throne at the end of the thirteenth century. In fact his principal interests lay in Somerset, where his family held lands from at least the 1170s. Robert's immediate parentage is uncertain, and it can only be said that he was the son of one of two men, father and son, both named John de Briwes, who both served as royal justices in Cornwall in 1201. One John was also involved with exchequer business in 1207, and one had a wife, Margery, and property interests in Surrey and Wiltshire. Margery may have been the mother of Robert, who on 31 May 1229, as John's son and heir, did homage to the king for his father's lands at Staple Fitzpaine in Somerset. In April 1233 Robert was granted the right to hold a market there, and he still held the manor at his death.<br>
<br>Briwes served as sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk in 1232&#150;4, and again in 1237&#150;9, while in 1239&#150;40 he was a justice itinerant under Robert of Lexinton in Northamptonshire. In 1248 Lexinton became the vassal of Briwes, when the latter granted him custody of his manor of Theydon Mount in Essex, with the advowson of its rectory. His association with Essex resulted from his first marriage, to Beatrice, daughter of Walter of Evermuth, which had taken place by June 1239, when they were granted a market and fair at Theydon Mount. His marriage also brought Robert lands at Runham in Norfolk, which were granted to him and Beatrice by Walter of Evermuth in 1239&#150;40, and which Briwes still held at the time of his death. He and Beatrice also held property jointly in Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire.<br>
<br>After an interval of several years Briwes resumed his career in the king's service in the early 1250s. In August 1250 he was commissioned to hear assizes in south-west England, including a dispute in Somerset between the bishop of Bath and Wells and the abbot of Glastonbury; and also to adjudicate (together with Henry of Bath) between the men of the archbishop of York and those of the bishop of Lincoln. He was added to the panel of justices for the Norfolk and Suffolk eyres of 1250&#150;51, and then took part in the eyre to northern and midland counties which began in September 1251. He continued to receive regular commissions during the rest of the 1250s, and had been knighted by the end of the decade. On 13 April 1257 Briwes was appointed a puisne justice of the court <i>coram rege</i>, and by the early 1260s at the latest he was receiving an annual fee of &pound;40. As well as continuing to serve on numerous commissions he acted once more as a justice in eyre. In the visitation of 1261&#150;3, for example, Briwes headed the circuit for Devon, Cornwall, and Somerset.<br>
<br>Briwes remained loyal to the king throughout the 1260s. About the end of 1261, after Henry III had freed himself from baronial control, Briwes acted as temporary keeper of Taunton Castle. A royalist during the civil war that followed, he was heavily, and sometimes controversially, involved in the settlement of territorial claims following the battle of Evesham on 4 August 1265. The Essex manor of Theydon Mount had passed from Robert of Lexinton to his brother John, who died in 1257, and thence to John's great-nephew Robert of Sutton. But Robert was a Montfortian, and consequently Henry III regranted the manor to Briwes in October 1266. However, Briwes's neighbour in Essex, Richard de Tany, lord of Stapleford, was keen to secure the manor for himself and produced a charter purporting to show his own prior claim. Eventually Briwes established in the court <i>coram rege</i> that Tany's charter was a forgery, and the manor was restored to him, but he had lost it again by the time of his death, when it was back in the custody of Robert of Sutton, presumably rehabilitated after his rebellion. Similarly at Michaelmas 1268 Briwes was involved in another dispute, this time over land in Somerset and Wiltshire, against his fellow loyalist Robert Walerand. The outcome of the case is not recorded, and its significance lies largely in Walerand's assertion that Briwes had begun his action at a time when he was &#145;chief justice of the bench without colleague or counter-roll&#146; (<i>capitalis justiciarius de Banco sine socio et sine contrarotulo</i>; TNA: PRO, KB 26/186, m. 13d). This is the first known explicit reference to the office of chief justice of the bench. It is not possible to be certain precisely when Briwes was acting in this way, but it was probably before 8 March 1268, when he was &#145;appointed to be justice to hold pleas before the king during pleasure&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR, 1266&#150;72</span>, 202), and granted an annual fee of 100 marks.<br>
<br>Briwes's tenure as senior justice of the court <i>coram rege</i> was brief, for on 6 November 1269 he was replaced by Richard of Staines, and ordered to deliver up his rolls, writs, and other documents. He continued to act on commissions of assize and gaol delivery until at least 1272. But there are indications that he had fallen from royal favour, and he may have retired around that time. Three times between the end of 1274 and the summer of 1275 he was ordered to hand over rolls in his possession, while an order of 24 June 1275 stipulated that he should pay all his debts to the king in two instalments over the following year. Briwes was dead by 28 August 1276, when orders were given for inquests into his lands. His wife Beatrice had predeceased him, and Briwes had married as his second wife a woman named Margery. His heir was his son, Sir John de Briwes, evidently the son of Beatrice, and there was also a daughter. At his death Briwes held manors in Norfolk, Gloucestershire, Hampshire, and Surrey, as well as his principal estates in Somerset and Essex.<br>
