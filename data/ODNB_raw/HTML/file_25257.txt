<span class="headword">Shaw,  John</span>  (1792&#150;1827), <span class="occ">surgeon and anatomist</span>, born, probably in Ayr, on 2 April 1792, was the son of Charles Shaw, clerk of the county of Ayr, and his wife, Barbara Wright, daughter of a customs official at Greenock; he was the grandson of David Shaw, moderator of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1775. His three brothers were the legal writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25263/', "Patrick Shaw")</script>, the surgeon and anatomist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25244/', "Alexander Shaw (1804&#150;1890)")</script>, and the soldier <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25245/', "Sir Charles Shaw (1795&#150;1871)")</script>. One of his sisters, Marion, married Charles Bell; Shaw apparently lived with them after their marriage in 1811 until his death. Shaw's other sister, Barbara, married Charles Bell's brother, the eminent advocate George Joseph Bell.<br>
<br>Shaw was sent to London at the age of fifteen to study anatomy and surgery with Charles Bell at the Great Windmill Street School. As an anatomist Shaw is said to have made important additions to the school's collection of anatomical specimens. He was surgeon to the Middlesex Hospital from 1825 until his death in 1827. He published two surgical works concerned with distortions of the spine and chest; both works were published in the 1820s not only in England but also in Weimar, in German translation. Shaw's work as a demonstrator at the Great Windmill Street School led to his <span class="italic">Manual for the Student of Anatomy</span> (1821), which was republished twice in London in 1822 and published in German translation in Weimar in 1823. It was also published in the United States.<br>
<br>Shaw and his brother Alexander were drawn into the campaign carried out by their brother-in-law, Charles Bell, in support of Bell's claim that he had preceded Fran&ccedil;ois Magendie in the discovery that the roots of the spinal nerves differ in their functions, one being concerned with sensation and the other with motion. Facsimile reproductions of some of the contributions by Bell and by the Shaws to that priority dispute are found in P. F. Cranefield's <span class="italic">The Way In and the Way Out</span> (1974). The latter also includes a facsimile reproduction of an article by A. D. Waller, published in <span class="italic">Science Progress</span> in 1911, in which Waller refers to the claim that Bell was greater than William Harvey as a &#145;family compact&#146;. Shaw had extensive family connections to important and successful persons; it seems likely that both he and his brother were not only willing to join in a &#145;family compact&#146; but were possibly anxious to secure a place in history for themselves and Charles Bell.<br>
<br>Shaw accomplished a great deal in his short life and the republication of his books in Germany and the United States shows that he had a good reputation in his day. Nevertheless, he is now remembered more for his connection with the Bell&#150;Magendie controversy than for any major contribution to anatomy, physiology, or surgery. Shaw died at home, in London, on 19 July 1827, apparently from scarlet fever.<br>
