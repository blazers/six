<span class="headword">Ashwell,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1541?), <span class="occ">prior of Newnham</span>, was educated at Oxford University, where he received the degree of DCnL in 1515. He was incorporated at Cambridge soon afterwards. Little else is known of his early career. He became rector of Mistley, Essex, in 1504; the living was vacant by August 1516, the same month in which Ashwell was admitted as vicar of Littlebury, Essex. He was also vicar of Halstead in the same county. In 1515, during Henry VIII's first French campaign, Ashwell served as chaplain to the troops of Lord Bergavenny. In 1521 Ashwell obtained a prebendal stall in St Paul's Cathedral.<br>
<br>In 1527 Ashwell became the prior of Newnham Priory, Bedfordshire, the same year that he wrote a letter to John Longland, bishop of Lincoln, which ultimately placed Ashwell at the centre of a small debate between traditionalists and reformers in the English church. The letter, written partly in English and partly in Latin, complained about the heretical opinions of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15153/', "George Joye")</script>. Joye, a fellow at Peterhouse, was a close associate of Ashwell and also a member of the Cambridge White Horse circle, from which many early protestant leaders emerged. A copy of this letter fell into Joye's hand and he fled into exile, living the next several years in Strasbourg. In the 1530s Joye published English translations of several <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> tracts, but soon after his departure from England he published Ashwell's letter with a point by point refutation of all charges of heresy. The book, entitled <span class="italic">The letter whyche Johan Ashwell, priour of Newnham Abbey besydes Bedforde, sente secretly to the byshope of Lyncolne in the yeare of Our Lorde MDXXVII</span>, was published at Antwerp in 1531 and again in 1548. Joye protested against the use of force by the church, asking when would God's true church persecute anyone? Joye also encouraged &#145;This lytell boke be delyvered to Johan Ashwell at Newnham Abbey besyde Bedforde with spede&#146;, a point rendered more powerful in that Ashwell's original letter stated the author's desire to keep his denunciation a secret between him and the bishop. The multiple publications of Joye's refutation suggest that as English culture increasingly equated Roman Catholicism with subterfuge and deception, the main point of Joye's answer transformed from a protest of ecclesiastical coercion into proof of Roman Catholic deceit.<br>
<br>Ashwell apparently conformed to all the legislation of the Henrician Reformation, submitting to the royal supremacy, but he was not the prior of Newnham upon its dissolution in 1539. The date of his death is uncertain, but his prebendal stall in St Paul's Cathedral was listed as open on 23 August 1541.<br>
