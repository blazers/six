<span class="headword">Robinson,  John Ebdon</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>John Ebdon]</span>  (1923&#150;2005), <span class="occ">planetarium director and broadcaster</span>, was born on 22 December 1923 at Durham House, 102 Crouch Hill, London, the son of William Ewart Robinson, export and import merchant, of 109 rue du Relais, Ixelles, Brussels, and his wife, Yvonne Bertha, formerly Cryer, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ebdon. He was educated at an English-language school in Switzerland and at Blundells School, which he did not enjoy. During the Second World War he served with the Royal Air Force; he twice survived having to bale out after being shot down, and suffered flash blindness as a result of a blast. After the war he planned to become an actor, and trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, but was advised against a career in the theatre since the bright lights affected his eyes. He took an external degree in English literature from the University of London while working as a buyer, and on 19 April 1952 married Angela Mary Knyvett (<i>d</i>. 2003), a 21-year-old occupational therapist, and daughter of John Seymour Knyvett, army officer; they had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Uncertain about his career, from 1952 to 1957 Robinson lived in east Africa, working as a game warden and also buying and selling skins. He found time to master Swahili (languages always came easily to him) and founded a repertory company, the Nairobi City Players. When he returned to England he considered being ordained in the Anglican church, but rejected the idea on the grounds that he would find it hard to support his family on a clergyman's income. Nevertheless it had become clear that his real future lay in public speaking; he had what had been called a &#145;port-wine&#146; voice, and as a lecturer he was helped by the fact that he was tall and good-looking.<br>
<br>London's first Planetarium had been opened at Madame Tussaud's in Baker Street but had not been quite the success originally expected, and soon after his return to England Robinson (who by now was known as John Ebdon) was invited to become its chief narrator. His arrival made all the difference; his lectures&#151;he preferred to call them &#145;displays&#146;&#151;were immensely popular, and the Planetarium was soon presenting several shows each day. He devised a wide range of programmes besides those for the general public, including special &#145;displays&#146; for primary schoolchildren, secondary schoolchildren, and students of astronomy; for children with learning disabilities, gifted children, and the blind; and for those interested in references to medieval astronomy and astrology in English literature. One of his main strengths was his sense of humour, and unlike his predecessor he was always ready to talk informally to his audience after the end of the official display. Quite apart from this, astronomy had always been one of his main hobbies, so that he was well equipped to answer questions about it. He became director of the London Planetarium in 1968, when the moon landings were imminent, and remained until ill health forced him to retire in 1989.<br>
<br>Long before then, Robinson had become established in a new career, that of a popular broadcaster (again using the name John Ebdon). A senior BBC producer, Denys Gueroult, heard him speaking at the Planetarium and was quick to appreciate his potential. He invited Robinson to compile a programme based on snippets from the BBC sound archives, adding his own comments between the excerpts; this was ideally suited to his rich voice, whimsical humour, and grasp of what was happening in Britain and abroad. The programme, <span class="italic">Archive Feature</span>, was broadcast on Radio 4 on the first Monday of each month, and ran uninterrupted for over a quarter of a century. Millions of listeners looked forward to his programme, which he always opened with &#145;How do you do?&#146; and closed with &#145;Anyway, if you have been, thanks for listening&#146;. Frequent references were made to his cat Perseus (to whom Robinson attributed some of his more controversial opinions), and the cat earned the unusual distinction of an obituary when he died in 1978. When the series came to an end in 1987 it was widely missed. He also appeared regularly on <span class="italic">Woman's Hour</span>, <span class="italic">Thought for the Day</span>, and <span class="italic">Any Questions</span>, and devised and presented other series, including <span class="italic">A World of Sound</span>, <span class="italic">Nonsense at Noon</span>, <span class="italic">April Foolery</span>, and <span class="italic">Near Myths</span> (the latter based on tales from Greek mythology).<br>
<br>Robinson's third career was as an author. <span class="italic">Ebdon's England</span> (1985) was perhaps the best of his books, but all were beautifully written and all were well received. He was a great traveller, and had a particular fondness for Greece; he spent many of his holidays there, and wrote three books about it&#151;<span class="italic">Ebdon's Odyssey</span> (1979), <span class="italic">Ebdon's Iliad</span> (1983), and <span class="italic">Near Myths</span> (1989), the last based on his radio series. He mastered both ancient and modern Greek and often broadcast on Greek radio, one listener commenting that his command of the language was almost perfect.<br>
<br>Witty, good-humoured, and always urbane, Robinson was one of the most accomplished and popular broadcasters of the post-war BBC. His retirement was marred by the death of a son in a parachute accident, and by the death of his first wife, but he found happiness in a new relationship with Mary Elizabeth Lawson Light, a state registered nurse, and daughter of Albert Lawson Light, consultant surgeon. They married on 6 February 2004. Robinson died a year later, on 19 March 2005, at his home, 41 Hillside Road, Northwood, London, of cancer; he was survived by his second wife and two children of his first marriage.<br>
