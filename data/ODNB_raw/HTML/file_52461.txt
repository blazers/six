<span class="headword">Kernahan,  (John) Coulson</span>  (1858&#150;1943), <span class="occ">writer and promoter of compulsory military service</span>, was born at 2 Prospect Place, Ilfracombe, Devon, on 1 August 1858, the elder son and third of the eight children of the Revd James Kernahan MA PhD FGS (<i>b</i>. 1825/6), a Congregational minister who was the author of a commentary on the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and also an amateur geologist, and his wife, Comfort, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Plowman (<i>b</i>. 1828/9). His parents were both born in Ireland. He was educated at home by his father and at St Albans School. He later wrote that he learned little at school &#145;bar a code of manners which I hold to this day&#146; and &#145;learning to hold my own&#151;in point of fact, to fight&#146;  (Kernahan papers, U. Reading).<br>
<br>Kernahan had originally intended to be a scientist but recognized his true vocation when he became successful at writing in order to make a living while studying. His journalistic gifts quickly led to a career of writing essays and critical articles in monthly and quarterly magazines including <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>, <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>, <span class="italic">Punch</span> and <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>. He also wrote poetry, and his early poems were included in Alfred H. Miles's anthology of <span class="italic">Poets and Poetry of the Century</span>. His poetic interests led him, however, to the study of others' work rather than prolific creation of his own. He collaborated in 1891 with Frederick Locker on a new edition of the anthology <span class="italic">Lyra elegantiarum</span>. Kernahan knew Swinburne, who admired his critical gifts, and wrote a book of recollections of Swinburne and Watts-Dunton's household at The Pines (1919). In the 1920s he published two works on &#145;famous living poets&#146;.<br>
<br>Kernahan's greatest success as a writer came in his thirties with his novel <span class="italic">A Dead Man's Diary</span>, serialized by <span class="italic">Lippincott's Magazine</span> and later published by Ward, Lock, and Bowden in 1890. It purported to be the adventures in the spirit world of the dead narrator, exemplifying Kernahan's belief that personality survives death. The book sold its first run of 2000 in a few weeks and was so successful that a confidence trickster induced a publisher to give an advance on his manuscript on the misrepresentation that he was the anonymous author. When Kernahan's publishers successfully sought an injunction, he was revealed as the writer. Ward Lock's reader, George Thomas Bettany, became, in Kernahan's words, &#145;my ever-honoured and ever-loved friend, and more than friend&#146;  (C. Kernahan, <span class="italic">A Book of Strange Sins</span>, 1893, iii). Following Bettany's death in 1891 Kernahan married his widow, Mary Jane Hickling Bettany (see below) on 13 June 1892. They had one daughter, named Beryl Bettany Kernahan. Kernahan had been an assistant reader for Ward Lock and succeeded Bettany as principal reader, a post he held until 1910.<br>
<br>Kernahan's <span class="italic">A Book of Strange Sins</span> (1893) offered a series of stories: &#145;each is a study of some form of crime or sin. Drink, Lust, Murder, Soul-Murder, Pride, Suicide&#146; and &#145;self-seeking and self-righteousness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Strange Sins</span>, iii). <span class="italic">The Star</span> newspaper described the stories as &#145;palpitating with life. Terrible in their intensity and vivid vivisection of human mind and character&#146;  (review quoted in advertisement in Kernahan's <span class="italic">God and the Ant</span>). The next of these books on religious themes, <span class="italic">God and the Ant</span> (1895), was his most successful, selling 30,000 in a few months. The central conceit is that for humans to know the mind of God is rather as an ant might seek to understand the mind of a man. Kernahan's originality is shown in the set piece of the day of judgment when God is judged for the wrongs he has done man. The combined sales of this and his next book on religious themes, <span class="italic">The Child, the Wise Man and the Devil</span> (1896), exceeded 100,000, but his mine of religious ideas was exhausted and the latter book lacked the originality of his earlier works.<br>
<br>From 1906 until 1914 Kernahan, convinced that war was inevitable, gave almost the whole of his time and energy to preaching throughout the country the message of Lord Roberts's <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95555', "National Service League")</script>, which campaigned for compulsory military service. For this he refused not only remuneration but even expenses, his principles dictating that he could not receive money for religious or patriotic services. In order to preach by example, at the age of fifty he took a 2nd lieutenant's commission in the territorial infantry and was promoted captain in a few months. He wrote in his account of his experiences:<blockquote>I was ashamed to think that if war came, and England were in danger, I, an able-bodied man, should have to watch others go out to take a man's part in the defence of the country, while I remained behind with the women.  (C. Kernahan, <span class="italic">An Author in the Territorials</span> 1908, 9)</blockquote>Just before the First World War broke out he was retired, having reached the age limit, but immediately hostilities commenced he was recommissioned for recruiting service. During the war, as well as writing a number of unmemorable fiction works, he returned to religious themes. He attacked the &#145;obsession&#146; of spiritualism which he felt was both dangerous and opposed to the will of God. In <span class="italic">Spiritualism: a Personal Experience and a Warning</span> (1919), published when the fatalities of the war led to an upsurge in attempts to contact the dead, he called the practice &#145;spiritual housebreaking&#146; and criticized such humourless pranks as &#145;table turnings, automatic writing, guessing at the contents of a bag or box, vanishing and reappearing persons&#146;  (Kernahan, <span class="italic">Spiritualism</span>, 8, 28).<br>
<br>Kernahan's friends considered that, as a result of his patriotic services, he had &#145;lost ground in the fierce competition of the literary life&#146;. An appeal for him to be awarded a civil list pension was accompanied by a description of his domestic circumstances:<blockquote>Mr Kernahan, after having done the harshest of the domestic work, writes all day with indefatigable industry. His wife attends to the necessary household duties and keeps away callers who might interrupt her husband's work until the evening, and regularly at 10pm sets herself to write until 4am of the following morning. (TNA: PRO, civil list recommendation, 13 Dec 1924)</blockquote>Doubtless there was some exaggeration, but it is none the less evident that their labour was great, and the remuneration small. The petition, supported by J. M. Barrie, Arthur Conan Doyle, Rudyard Kipling, Rider Haggard, and others, was successful and in 1925 Kernahan was awarded an annual pension of &pound;100.<br>
<br>In his maturity Kernahan was 6 feet 1 inch tall, had a forthright face with direct eyes, dark wavy hair, and a long waxed moustache. His affection for dogs was attested to by his <span class="italic">Bow-Wow Book of Dog Love</span> (1912) and <span class="italic">A Dog and his Master</span> (1932). From 1911 he and his wife lived at a house named Frognal, in Fairlight, near Hastings, Sussex. He died there on 17 February 1943 and was buried in the borough cemetery, Hastings. His literary work has not stood the test of time but as a type of man, sensitive and spiritually questing but without the slightest doubt as to his military obligations, he is representative of an early twentieth century generation of his countrymen. His sister Mary Kernahan (<i>b</i>. 1855/6) was also an author, who contributed to periodicals and had a volume of verse (<span class="italic">Nothing but Nonsense</span>) published in 1898.<br>
<br>Kernahan's wife, <a name="cosubject_95700"></a><span class="headword">Mary Jane Hickling Kernahan <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gwynne; <em>other married name </em>Bettany]</span></span>  (1857&#150;1941)<span class="occ"></span>, was born at Audley, Staffordshire, on 25 January 1857, the only daughter of Samuel Goodland Gwynne (<i>b</i>. 1827/8), mathematics master at Taunton College, and his wife, Jane Woolley, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wright (<i>b</i>. 1832/3). She was educated at home by her father and at University College, London. On 1 August 1878 she married George Thomas Bettany (1850&#150;1891), who, in addition to being a publisher's reader, was a scientific author and lectured in botany at Guy's Hospital, London, and in biology at Girton and Newnham colleges, Cambridge. He was the son of George Bettany (1819&#150;1883), a schoolmaster and author. On her first husband's death she was awarded a civil list pension in consideration of his services to the spread of scientific knowledge and of her own &#145;destitute condition&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 July 1892). Writing under the names Jeanie Gwynne Bettany and Jeanie Gwynne Kernahan, she became a prolific novelist, her most notable books being <span class="italic">The House of Rimmon</span> (1885) and <span class="italic">Trewinnot of Guy's</span> (1898). After converting to the Roman Catholic church in 1898 she wrote works on religious themes such as <span class="italic">The Gate of Sinners</span> and <span class="italic">The Sin of Gabrielle</span> (both 1908). She died on 17 January 1941. Her child from her first marriage, George Kernahan Bettany (1891&#150;1949), became a thriller writer under the name George Kernahan Gwynne Bettany.<br>
