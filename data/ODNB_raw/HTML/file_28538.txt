<span class="headword">Wallace <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Jackson]</span>, Sir  Richard</span>, baronet  (1818&#150;1890), <span class="occ">philanthropist and art collector</span>, was the illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94237/', "Richard Seymour-Conway, Viscount Beauchamp, later fourth marquess of Hertford (1800&#150;1870)")</script>. His mother, Mrs Agnes Jackson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wallace, was very probably Eliza Agnes Wallace (1789&#150;1864), daughter of Sir Thomas Wallace of Craigie, who had married Samuel Bickley in 1808. Richard was born in London on 21 June 1818, when his father was just eighteen years old, and was given the surname Jackson. He spent his first six years in London with his mother who then took him to Paris, where she left him with his father and grandmother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42344/', "Maria Seymour-Conway, marchioness of Hertford (1770/71&#150;1856)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25167/', "Conway, Francis Ingram-Seymour")</script>], and Lady Hertford's second, illegitimate, son, Lord Henry Seymour (1805&#150;1859). Thereafter Richard led a privileged life in Paris. Since his father spent much time travelling before settling permanently in Paris, at 2 rue Laffitte, in 1835, Richard was brought up by his grandmother in the rue Taitbout with the eccentric Lord Henry as a companion. In April 1842, a month after his father's succession as fourth marquess of Hertford, Richard had himself baptized in the Anglican church, taking the surname Wallace (his mother's maiden name). He was already the father of a son, Edmond (1840&#150;1887), with Am&eacute;lie-Julie Charlotte Castelnau (1819&#150;1897), the daughter of a French officer, Bernard Castelnau.<br>
<br>Lord Hertford now embarked on making his extraordinary collection of works of art. Wallace was employed as his secretary, with an annual allowance, and from at least 1843 as his saleroom agent. In 1854 and 1856 Lord Hertford settled Wallace's debts, sustained through speculation, but in 1857 he made Wallace settle further debts by selling a small collection of works of art he had made in his own name. Following the death of the dowager marchioness in 1856, Lord Hertford, who had always been misanthropic, further withdrew from society, and Wallace, as the well-mannered agent of one of the richest, but most reclusive, collectors in Europe, became a figure of interest. In October 1859 Sir Charles Eastlake, director of the National Gallery, met &#145;Lord Hertford's son &#147;Monsieur Richard&#148;&#146; at a sale in Hanover and immediately recognized a rival &#145;against whom there is little chance of contending&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journals &hellip; of Lady Eastlake</span>, 2.134&#150;5). This acknowledgement of Wallace's parentage, recorded in Lady Eastlake's <span class="italic">Journal</span>, is of interest, since Lord Hertford never publicly declared his paternity.<br>
<br>When Lord Hertford died at Bagatelle in August 1870, on the eve of the Prussian defeat of France at Sedan, Wallace unexpectedly succeeded to his father's collections and to his unentailed properties in Paris (2 rue Laffitte and the ch&acirc;teau of Bagatelle in the Bois-de-Boulogne), London (houses in Piccadilly, Berkeley Square, and Manchester Square), and Ireland (the Lisburn estates). Having lived in his father's shadow all his life, he was now able to express his good nature through his inherited fortune. Among the many donations he made during the Prussian siege of Paris (from September 1870 to January 1871), he gave &pound;12,000 towards the cost of a field ambulance (attached to the army corps in which his son was serving), he chaired a British charitable fund, and he subscribed &pound;4000 to start a subscription for victims of the shelling. The armistice was signed on 28 January 1871, and on 15 February Wallace married Am&eacute;lie-Julie at the <i>mairie</i> in the rue Drouot, both parties giving their address as 3 rue Taitbout. From March to May of the same year there ensued the uprising of the Paris commune. Throughout these months of violence Wallace kept his Paris collections boarded up in the rue Laffitte. When peace returned he was quickly rewarded for his extraordinary philanthropy: he was made a member of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur and, in August 1871, received a baronetcy from Queen Victoria. One of Wallace's last public acts in Paris was to present the city with fifty cast-iron drinking fountains, known to this day as <i>wallaces</i>.<br>
<br>Wallace now resolved to remove as much of his collection as he could to Manchester House in London, although much was to remain in the rue Laffitte and at Bagatelle. While Manchester House, now renamed Hertford House, was being prepared, he exhibited his London collection from 1872 to 1875, at his own expense, in the new outstation of the South Kensington Museum at Bethnal Green. Meanwhile, in 1871&#150;2, he had purchased collections of medieval and Renaissance armour and <i>objets d'art</i>, extending the historical scope of his father's collection which, principally, contained outstanding seventeenth-century old master paintings with a spectacular collection of French fine and applied art of the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i>. Although never an extravagant collector like his father, Wallace continued to make occasional purchases.<br>
<br>Wallace's subsequent years were spent principally either in Hertford House or at Bagatelle, but he also bought a country residence, Sudbourne Hall in Suffolk, from the fifth marquess of Hertford, and, after some litigation, established his right to the Hertford Irish estates in Lisburn. He was a conscientious Conservative MP for that constituency from 1873 to 1885; he gave the town a public park, known as Wallace Park, and built Castle House as his Lisburn residence. He remained generous with both his fortune and his time: he was a commissioner for the Paris Exhibition of 1878, and was made KCB the same year; he was a trustee of both the National Portrait Gallery (1879&#150;90) and the National Gallery (1884&#150;90), and a generous lender to special exhibitions.<br>
<br>Wallace was a small, dapper figure, and his later portraits always give him a serious expression. He wore a French imperial moustache and his English remained tainted with a French accent. Although Wallace was highly respected as a public figure, his final years were not without their disappointments. Lady Wallace was unable to adapt satisfactorily to the life of an English aristocrat, and Wallace failed in his attempt to have his baronetcy made transferable to his illegitimate son, who then died suddenly in 1887 (leaving four illegitimate children, whose descendants survive today). Wallace afterwards spent an increasing amount of time alone at Bagatelle, where he died on 20 July 1890, in the same room and bed in which his father had died. He was buried on 23 July in the Hertford family vault in the cemetery of P&egrave;re Lachaise, beneath the body of his great friend Lord Henry Seymour.<br>
<br>Although Wallace had considered leaving his London collection to the nation, he had been deterred by the government's indifference towards the question of a suitable home. Instead he left all his estate to Lady Wallace, who continued to live in Hertford House. On her death in 1897 she bequeathed the contents to the nation as the Wallace Collection and, in the event, Hertford House itself became the museum. The works of art remaining in Paris were eventually dispersed by the Paris dealer Seligmann.<br>
