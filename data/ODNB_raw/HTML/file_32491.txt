<span class="headword">Coleridge,  Stephen William Buchanan</span>  (1854&#150;1936), <span class="occ">author and anti-vivisectionist</span>, was born in London on 31 May 1854, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5886/', "John Duke Coleridge, first Baron Coleridge (1820&#150;1894)")</script>, lord chief justice of England, and his first wife, Jane Fortescue, daughter of the Revd George Turner Seymour, of Farringford, Isle of Wight. He was brother of the judge <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32489/', "Bernard John Seymour Coleridge, second Baron Coleridge")</script>, and of Gilbert Coleridge, assistant master of the crown office from 1892 to 1921.<br>
<br>Stephen Coleridge was sent to school in Brighton and then, aged eleven, &#145;to a horrible school at Honiton, conducted by a monster of cruelty named Izod&#146;  (Coleridge, 4). He then went to Bradfield School, Berkshire, and, in 1874, to Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in 1877. After a year (1879&#150;80) spent in travel in Latin America, he became private secretary to his father (1884&#150;90). In 1886 he was called to the bar by the Middle Temple. In 1890 the lord chief justice appointed him clerk of assize for the South Wales circuit. His natural kindness and courtesy made him popular with the members of the circuit.<br>
<br>An inherited rhetorical faculty characterized Coleridge's writings both in prose and in verse. He appreciated good literature, and was an acceptable lecturer. His large output includes <span class="italic">A Morning in my Library</span> (1914), <span class="italic">An Evening in my Library among the English Poets</span> (1916), and other books of the same kind. He also published four volumes entitled <span class="italic">Letters to my Grandson</span> (1921&#150;3), telling him of the world about him, the happy life, and the glory of English prose and poetry. He was a competent amateur artist, especially of landscape, and showed at various exhibitions.<br>
<br>Coleridge hated cruelty in all its forms and believed in action to reduce it. He was one of the founders, in 1884, of the London Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, renamed in 1889 as the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Although fond of games and outdoor pursuits, he hated any sport that involved the death of animals, and became president of the League for the Prohibition of Cruel Sports. His chief energy, however, was devoted to the ending of experiments on animals. On this subject he had uncompromising views and was opposed not only to vivisection but to exhibitions of stuffed animals and to posters illustrating vivisection, though intended to demonstrate its cruelty. He was active in the Victoria Street Society for the Protection of Animals Liable to Vivisection and was the prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Frances Power Cobbe, its leader. The society came to support total abolition. In 1898 Coleridge ousted Cobbe from the society's executive committee; the society was renamed the National Vivisection Society and pursued a step-by-step policy, of which total abolition would be the final achievement rather than the only goal (Cobbe in fury founded a rigidly abolitionist counter-organization). Coleridge attempted to set anti-vivisection in a wider context, as part of a resistance to the onset of science, which he saw as causing moral decline and economic slavery  (French, 412).<br>
<br>Coleridge was twice married: first, in 1879, to Geraldine Beatrix (<i>d</i>. 1910), daughter and coheir of Charles Manners Lushington, of Norton Court, Kent, and niece of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20328/', "Stafford Northcote, first earl of Iddesleigh")</script>; and second, in 1911, to Susan, second daughter of Allan Duncan Stewart, of Bun Rannoch and Inverhadden, Perthshire, an area that became the subject of many of his paintings. With his first wife he had three sons, the eldest of whom predeceased him. Coleridge died at his home, The Ford, Chobham, Surrey, on 10 April 1936.<br>
