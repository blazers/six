<span class="headword">Peerson,  Andrew</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1594), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, graduated BA from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in 1542, subsequently proceeding MA in 1544 and BD in 1551. Soon after graduating BA he was elected a fellow of his college; for a time he was bursar, and laid out and planted with fruit trees the fellows' garden. In 1550&#150;51 he served as proctor, and was also auditor of the Trinity chest. He vacated his fellowship about 1552 and seems to have accepted some cure in Cambridge, from which he was ejected on 3 October 1553, early in the reign of Mary Tudor, for continuing to administer the communion in the form used under Edward VI. Not known to have gone abroad, he was probably one of many protestants, like Matthew Parker, who lived in retirement during the later 1550s.<br>
<br>Following Elizabeth's accession, Archbishop Parker named Peerson his chaplain, almoner, and master of faculties, chose him to preach a sermon at the consecration on 21 January 1560 of four bishops, bestowed upon him the livings of Brasted, Wrotham, Chiddingstone in Kent, and, on the death of John Bale in 1563, secured his election to the eleventh prebendal stall in Canterbury Cathedral. Parker took a good deal of trouble to obtain this last preferment for his chaplain, and wrote to thank the queen once it had been achieved. He also recommended him for the provostship of Eton in 1561, but without success. In the convocation of 1563 Peerson sat as proctor for the clergy of the diocese of Llandaff, subscribed the articles then agreed upon, and voted against the six articles for abolishing certain rites and ceremonies. Peerson took part in preparing for press the <span class="roman">Bishops' Bible</span> of 1568, which Parker commissioned in the vain hope that it would supplant the popular Calvinist Geneva <span class="roman">Bible</span> published in 1560. Peerson was asked to revise the translation of <span class="roman">Leviticus</span>, <span class="roman">Numbers</span>, <span class="roman">Job</span>, and <span class="roman">Proverbs</span>. Tanner doubtfully attributes to him <span class="roman">Ezra</span>, <span class="roman">Nehemiah</span>, <span class="roman">Esther</span>, <span class="roman">Job</span>, and <span class="roman">Proverbs</span>.<br>
<br>In 1569 Peerson was one of two commissioners chosen to visit the diocese of Canterbury, and on 4 January 1571 had a licence for non-residence. In September 1573 he entertained Burghley at his &#145;fine house&#146;, as Parker called it, at Canterbury; in 1575 the archbishop named Peerson one of his executors and bequeathed him a gilt cup, the gift of Elizabeth. On 30 June 1580 he was presented to the living of Hardres, Kent, but resigned it in 1582. Peerson married twice. Nothing is known of his first wife, but on 16 April 1582 he married Sarah Sampson, widow, at Sheldwich, Kent. On 1 September 1589 he received the living of Harbledown, Kent. He died early in November 1594. In his will he mentions a son, Andrew Peerson, and daughter-in-law, Joan, and their children.<br>
