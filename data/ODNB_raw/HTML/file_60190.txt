<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Perrins,  Isaac</span>  (1750<span class="mult">x</span>57&#150;1801), <span class="occ">pugilist and mechanical engineer</span>, of whom few early details are known, appears, unusually for a member of the eighteenth-century boxing fraternity, to have been well educated and, as various extant letters in copperplate handwriting show, certainly extremely literate.<br>
<br>Perrins's enduring fame in the prize ring rests primarily on his memorable bout with the celebrated Tom Johnson. Before this he was credited with easily defeating every rival in the Birmingham area where he lived. Probably the most impressive of these provincial successes was at Coleshill against the locally renowned Jemmy Sargent (or Sargeant). The encounter, for 100 guineas, on 7 October 1782 was won by the underdog, Perrins, in about six minutes.<br>
<br>The Johnson battle, for 250 guineas a side, took place at Banbury on 22 October 1789. Such was the interest that there was almost unprecedented coverage of the build-up in the contemporary press. Perrins had overwhelming physical advantages but, owing to his na&iuml;vety, no clause was inserted in the articles of agreement to prevent &#145;shifting&#146;. Johnson was therefore able to move around at will instead of standing his ground as was the customary practice. Moreover, Perrins was inexperienced in the subterfuges of the sport and found himself outwitted by his artful adversary. Eventually, having exhausted his strength pursuing Johnson around the stage, he became an easy victim of the smaller man's ferocious attacks. The contest lasted some seventy-five minutes during which sixty-two rounds were fought.<br>
<br>Perrins's last fistic engagement might have been an 85-minute victory over one Richards near Shrewsbury on 30 July 1790, which was widely reported in the London and provincial press but later refuted in some country newspapers. Thereafter, although the renowned Jewish pugilist Daniel Mendoza visited Birmingham in 1791 in an attempt to match Perrins with Johnson's recent conqueror, Ben Bryan (or Bryant, later erroneously recorded as Brain), this contest failed to materialize.<br>
<br>An upright handsome man, Perrins stood about 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighed between 17 and 18 stone. His strength was prodigious and his agility surprising. He was known to be able to carry over 800 pounds in weight and is said to have once leapt over a turnpike gate for a 10 guinea wager. As a fighter he lacked science but this was more than compensated for by his power and unquestionable courage. Despite his pugilistic background, Perrins was of a mild disposition. On one occasion, when challenged in a Manchester public house by George Frederick Cooke, he endured considerable provocation before calmly picking up the actor as though he were a child and gently depositing him outside.<br>
<br>Throughout his fistic career Perrins was employed at Soho near Birmingham by the engine manufactory of Boulton and Watt. Later he was sent to Manchester to construct their engines and subsequently took a public house, at 24 Leigh Street, while continuing his work on the company's behalf. Towards the end of 1794 he believed himself to be unfairly discharged from their service but thereafter appears still to have been called upon to work for them in the Manchester district.<br>
<br>On 27 December 1799 Perrins, now living in New Street, Hanover Street, was appointed inspector of engines and conductor of firemen by the police commissioners of Manchester. The position effectively put him in charge of the city's fire brigade. Late in the evening of 10 December 1800 a fire broke out in the centre of Manchester which raged until after daylight. As a result of his exertions that night Perrins became seriously ill, dying of a fever on 6 January 1801; different sources give his age at death as forty-four and fifty years old. He was buried the next day near the western door of St John's Church, Byrom Street, Manchester, in the same grave as his wife, Mary, who had died, aged forty, on 2 September of the previous year.<br>
