<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Miles,  Bernard James</span>, Baron Miles  (1907&#150;1991), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born on 27 September 1907 at 1 Poplar Terrace, New Road, Hillingdon, Uxbridge, Middlesex, the son of Edwin James Miles, market gardener, and his wife, Barbara Hooper, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fletcher, a Scottish cook. Brought up in a strict Baptist household, he learned from his parents the value of thrift and hard work, as well as a wealth of ancient countryside lore which he later used in a triumphant series of music-hall monologues about life on a farm.<br>
<br>Educated at Uxbridge county school, Miles won a scholarship to Pembroke College, Oxford, and worked briefly as a schoolmaster in Yorkshire. He abandoned this career in 1930 when he made his stage d&eacute;but as the Second Messenger in a Baliol Holloway revival of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Richard III</span>. In 1931 he married the actress Josephine Wilson (<i>d</i>. 1990), who gave him unstinting support. They had two daughters and a son. The carpentry Miles had learned from his father came in useful during several subsequent years travelling the country with repertory companies, when his responsibilities ranged from building scenery to playing small parts. Towards the end of the 1930s he began to make a name in London, in music-halls and late-night cabaret theatres, where he perfected his comic monologues in <span class="italic">Late Joys</span> (1939) and three Herbert Farjeon revues.<br>
<br>During the war Miles found film fame in No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">In Which We Serve</span> (1942) but also frequently toured with the Old Vic as Iago and directed John Mills in <span class="italic">Men in Shadow</span> (1942), later following Mills in the leading role. As the war ended he was back with the Old Vic company at the New Theatre for the 1947&#150;8 season, playing the Inquisitor in <span class="italic">Saint Joan</span> and Christopher Sly in <span class="italic">The Taming of the Shrew</span>.<br>
<br>From the late 1940s Miles's energies were focused on building the first Mermaid Theatre in his own garden in St John's Wood, a wooden playhouse faithfully replicating Shakespeare's Globe long before the birth of Sam Wanamaker's similar project. In its first (1951) season he played Caliban in <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> and, as producer and director, persuaded Kirsten Flagstad and Maggie Teyte to sing Purcell's <span class="italic">Dido and Aeneas</span>. The Mermaid then found a temporary home at the Royal Exchange in the City, before Miles and his equally tireless wife finally settled it in Puddle Dock, the first theatre to have been opened in the City for 300 years. They spent six years building the new Mermaid and it eventually opened in May 1959 with a triumphant Lionel Bart musical, <span class="italic">Lock up your Daughters</span>, based somewhat loosely on Henry Fielding's <span class="italic">Rape upon Rape</span>. Though he was to suffer all the architectural and financial problems only too familiar to anyone trying to build a theatre in Britain, or merely to keep one open, Miles's years at the Mermaid saw triumphant revivals of <span class="italic">Treasure Island</span> (in which he was always a definitive Long John Silver) and long-running musical celebrations of the songs of No&euml;l Coward and Cole Porter. The Mermaid also gave birth to <span class="italic">Side by Side by Sondheim</span> in the late 1970s, and more classically was the venue for many notable Bernard Shaw and Shakespeare revivals, some of the latter in relatively modern dress. For his services to the theatre Miles was appointed CBE in 1953, knighted in 1969, and given a life peerage as Baron Miles of Blackfriars in 1979.<br>
<br>Miles was an old-fashioned actor, and was often out of tune also with modern directing techniques, but his ability to keep the Mermaid going on knife-edge finance, and frequently to retrieve it from the jaws of bankruptcy, was always admirable. If he sometimes cast himself in wildly unsuitable roles (Oedipus, for instance, or John Gabriel Borkman) he was nevertheless a memorable Schweyk in <span class="italic">Schweyk in the Second World War</span> (1963) and a formidable Falstaff in both parts of <span class="italic">Henry IV</span> (1970).<br>
<br>Like Joan Littlewood at the Theatre Royal a little further beyond the City in Stratford East, Miles worked with very slender resources and often scant critical acclaim; sadly, what should have been a triumphant rebuilding project when the Mermaid moved a few hundred yards inland in 1981 ended in bankruptcy, and in Miles's forced resignation as artistic director of the theatre he had built and still so loved. He and his wife had invested all their own money in the rebuilding project, and were forced to sell their London home to meet their debts. Following the death of his wife in 1990, Miles was moved into a nursing home with nothing more than his state pension, though funds were raised for him by an all-star <span class="italic">Bernard Miles Celebration</span> at the Mermaid on 3 March 1991, at which he made his last public appearance in a wheelchair, having recently fallen and broken a leg. He died at the Thistle Hill Nursing Home, Knaresborough, Yorkshire, on 14 June 1991. He was survived by his son and one daughter, his other daughter, Sally (who had joined her parents in the management of the Mermaid Theatre), having died of motor neurone disease.<br>
<br>Miles can still be seen in such major movies as No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">In Which We Serve</span> (1942), Alfred Hitchcock's <span class="italic">The Man Who Knew Too Much</span> (1956), John Huston's <span class="italic">Moby Dick</span> (1956), Basil Dearden's <span class="italic">The Smallest Show on Earth</span> (1957), and Charles Crichton's <span class="italic">Battle of the Sexes</span> (1960). He was a pioneer of the &#145;talking&#146; gramophone record in the 1940s; his <span class="italic">Over the Gate</span> monologues, of a mythical Buckinghamshire farmer, were released on several bestselling 78 r.p.m. discs (and he would also occasionally perform them live in the dying days of the music-hall). These were, for their time, if not scandalous then at least lusty, and during his management of the Mermaid Theatre in a still repressive theatrical era (when the lord chamberlain had to approve all scripts) he did his best to move the barriers of sexual tolerance slightly forward, in an always Falstaffian manner. He was also known to television audiences for a lengthy series of commercials on behalf of the Egg Marketing Board. Nevertheless his real legacy was the Mermaid Theatre. Though still standing just north of its original Puddle Dock site, the Mermaid enjoyed little success after he left it, and endured several periods of prolonged closure.<br>
