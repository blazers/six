<span class="headword">Sinclair, Sir  George</span>, second baronet  (1790&#150;1868), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25627/', "Sir John Sinclair, first baronet (1754&#150;1835)")</script>, of Ulbster, Caithness, and his second wife, Diana (1769&#150;1845), daughter of Alexander MacDonald, first Baron MacDonald of Sleat. He was born in Edinburgh on 28 August 1790; he was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25629/', "John Sinclair (1797&#150;1875)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25636/', "William Sinclair (1804&#150;1878)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25612/', "Catherine Sinclair")</script>. He was sent to Harrow School, aged ten; Byron and Robert Peel were among his contemporaries. Byron described Sinclair as &#145;the prodigy of our schooldays. He made exercises for half the school (literally), verses at will, and themes without it. He was a friend of mine, and in the same remove.&#146; He had, his father's biographer notes, &#145;a touch of the prig&#146;  (Mitchison, 99). Sinclair left Harrow at sixteen, and went to G&ouml;ttingen University. He was arrested as a spy near Jena, and was brought before Napoleon, who examined him and ordered his release; Sinclair issued a privately printed <span class="italic">Narrative</span> of the interview in 1826. He returned to Britain, and in 1811 succeeded his father as MP for Caithness, which he represented at intervals for many years, sitting as an independent whig. In 1812 he presented a Caithness petition for parliamentary reform, and supported Catholic relief; he was out of the Commons from 1812 to 1818. In 1816 he married, on 1 May, Lady Catherine Camilla, daughter of John Manners of Grantham Grange, and his wife, Louisa, daughter of Sir William Manners, first baronet. They had three sons, and three daughters. Sinclair and his family made their home in Thurso Castle, which he modernized.<br>
<br>Sinclair was re-elected to parliament in 1818. In the Commons he formed a close friendship with Joseph Hume and Sir Francis Burdett. He strenuously advocated Catholic emancipation and the emancipation of the West Indian slaves, and he severely criticized the pension list. While a member of parliament Sinclair found time to attend lectures at Edinburgh University on chemistry, anatomy, and botany. He took a great interest in the misfortunes of Charles X, and had numerous interviews with the royal exile when he was resident in Holyrood. One of these he described in a racy pamphlet, <span class="italic">Comme Charles X</span> (1848). In 1831 he was again elected for Caithness and sat continuously until 1841, being re-elected in 1833, 1835, and 1837. He became known for his religion. He supported the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> of 1832, and in the same year he attracted public attention by refusing William IV's invitation to dine with him on a Sunday. In 1835 he joined the new &#145;constitutional&#146; party of Lord Stanley and Sir James Graham, who had seceded in 1834 from the government of Earl Grey. On 21 December 1835 he succeeded his father as second baronet. He took an active part, as chairman of Burdett's committee, in the famous Westminster election of 1837; a writer in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> characterized him as &#145;one of the manliest and most uncompromising of the constitutional members of the House of Commons; a friend to the church, the king, and the people&#146;. He retired from parliament in 1841.<br>
<br>Sinclair was a faithful supporter of the anti-patronage society with reference to the Church of Scotland; he afterwards joined the Free Church. His last years were passed in seclusion at Thurso Castle and Torquay. His wife died on 17 March 1863. He spent the winter of 1867 at Cannes, and died in Edinburgh on 23 October 1868; he was buried at Harold's Tower, Thurso. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son, John George Tollemache Sinclair, who also held the Caithness seat.<br>
<br>Sinclair, as heir to the family estates, was placed in difficulty by his father's bankruptcy, but even so &pound;2000 p.a. was settled on him. He was a voluminous writer for the press and author of many pamphlets. His earliest work, <span class="italic">Travels in Germany</span> in two volumes, describing his visits to the continent, was printed for private circulation; only one copy is known to exist. He published a number of pamphlets on popery and on the Disruption, and also <span class="italic">Observations on the New Scottish Poor Law</span> (1849).<br>
