<span class="headword">Bourne,  Nehemiah</span>  (1611&#150;1691), <span class="occ">naval officer and official</span>, was born in Wapping, the eldest son of Robert Bourne (<i>d</i>. 1625), a prosperous shipwright, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1630); <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37210/', "John Bourne (bap. 1620, d. 1667)")</script> was his brother. Though his father had hoped he would be educated at Cambridge, Bourne chose to follow in the family business, and married the very young Hannah Earning of Limehouse (<i>c</i>.1616&#150;1684) on 18 January 1631. The Bournes belonged to a network of puritan mariners and merchants, and in 1638 they emigrated to Massachusetts in the <i>Confidence</i>, owned by William Rainborough. Nehemiah established himself as a merchant and shipowner at Charlestown, Dorchester, and finally Boston, where he became the town's first shipbuilder. He and his wife were admitted to the Boston church in 1641, and two of their five children were born in New England. Bourne returned to England in the winter of 1643&#150;4 to fight for parliament, serving as a major in the regiment raised by Thomas Rainborough, and also leased some of his ships to the state. Resigning his commission early in 1645 he returned to Massachusetts, and in October that year pressed unsuccessfully for its laws against Anabaptists to be dropped. On 19 December 1646 he and his wife sailed again for England, this time intending to remain. Over the next few years Bourne was busy trading to America in his own ships, and was unable to accept an invitation to serve the new Commonwealth's navy in 1649; but when he returned from New England in January 1650 Sir Henry Vane pressed him again, this time with success, recommending him to the generals-at-sea as a gallant man who would do the state &#145;both service and honour&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 25/123, 226). Bourne was appointed to the <i>Speaker</i>, a newly built second-rate, and commanded the North Sea squadron the following winter, assisting the army in its operations in Scotland. In May 1652, now in the <i>Andrew</i>, Bourne was commanding a squadron in the Downs when Tromp appeared with a powerful Dutch fleet; he sent a warning to Blake, and was able to join him in time to play a prominent part in the battle off the Downs on 19 May, which began the First Anglo-Dutch War. Bourne was in action again on 28 September, at the Kentish Knock. His bravery in both actions was admired, but the state had more urgent need of his administrative skills, and on 20 December 1652 he was appointed one of three new navy commissioners, all of them former American settlers, responsible for ships, supplies, and manning. Bourne discharged his duties with immense energy, and in the critical early months of 1653 was busy pressing men in the Thames, securing prize goods, and providing for injured mariners after the battle of Portland. Though he liked to bombard the admiralty with lengthy accounts of his labours and problems, Bourne was undoubtedly an effective administrator and responsible for the development of Harwich as a major naval base, serving in effect as its first resident commissioner. He retained his own shipping interests and, following the closure of the Baltic, contracted to supply masts and other stores from New England.<br>
<br>After the peace with the Dutch in April 1654 Bourne was based at the Navy Office in London, and with two colleagues took on responsibility for naval victualling, with an additional &pound;250 salary. From 1655 he resumed his shipbuilding activities, constructing a new shipyard at Wapping, and also invested in the East India Company. He remained an energetic commissioner throughout the decade, despite mounting problems as the finances of the Commonwealth deteriorated rapidly in its final years. Though Bourne served the protectorate loyally, he suspected that Richard Cromwell's rule would end in a Stuart restoration, and was ecstatic at the restoration of the Rump Parliament in May 1659. &#145;The Lord Jehovah hath most eminently and signally once more appeared for his own great name&#146;, he told a friend in New England  (Firth, 3.209). He was dismayed by the king's restoration in May 1660, and his public career ended when new commissioners were appointed on 4 July. He took the oaths enabling him to remain a member of Trinity House, of which he had been an elder brother since 1656, but ceased to be part of its governing body.<br>
<br>By the beginning of 1662 Bourne had resolved to leave England once more, and in May obtained a pass for his family to depart. He crossed to Hamburg and appears to have spent most of the 1660s in Rotterdam, a good base for his mercantile activities. By 1670 he was living in London again, in Abchurch Lane, still engaged in colonial trade. In his last years he was also occasionally involved in Trinity House business, and was consulted by the Navy Board in 1689. His wife, Hannah, had died on 10 June 1684 and was buried at Bunhill Fields on 21 June. Bourne died in the spring of 1691 and was buried beside her. His will, dated 11 February, was proved in May. Bourne was a typical servant of the Commonwealth, a committed radical, energetic, public spirited, yet with a shrewd eye to personal profit.<br>
