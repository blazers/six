<span class="headword">White,  Samuel</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Siamese White]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1650&#150;1689), <span class="occ">official in the Siamese service and pirate</span>, was probably born in the west of England and was probably a member of a Bristol merchant family. He was the younger brother of <a name="cosubject_68168"></a><span class="headword">George White</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1665&#150;1702)<span class="occ"></span>, who entered the service of the East India Company as a young man and in the 1660s travelled to India accompanied by Constant Phaulkon, an adventurer from Cephalonia who at first acted as the older White's assistant. George White detached himself from the East India Company and worked as an independent trader. He was not strictly an &#145;interloper&#146; as he did not encroach on the company's monopoly of trade with Europe, but sold his goods at ports from the Persian Gulf to Indo-China and established a good reputation in Siam.<br>
<br>Samuel White sailed for India in 1675 to join his brother. On board ship he met Mary Povey (<i>d</i>. 1682), who was travelling to Fort St George, Madras, to join her fianc&eacute;, Mr Jearsey; following their arrival in Fort St George in early 1676 Mary Povey married White instead. They had two daughters, Susan (<i>b</i>. 1676) and Mary (1678&#150;1692?). In Madras, White joined the establishment of the East India Company as a pilot on a salary of &pound;10 a year, with the opportunity for private trade. This employment was safe but limited, and in late 1677 White accepted an appointment in the service of King Narai of Siam, arranged by George White and Phaulkon. Narai seems to have wanted the English East India Company to establish itself in Siam to help counter the Dutch dominance of Siamese trade. The king was also happy to encourage the company's members to enter the Siamese service and strengthen the trading networks under direct royal control.<br>
<br>White's first command was of a royal ship plying between Mergui (a Siamese port on the Indian Ocean, in the province of Tenasserim, later part of Burma) and Masulipatam in India; he was engaged in the exotic traffic of importing elephants for Narai, but was also trading on his own account. White moved his family to Mergui, where his wife died in 1682. George White left Siam in 1681, but Phaulkon remained as an adviser on trade to the king. White benefited from Phaulkon's trade policy, adopted by Narai, by which Siam would seek an alliance with France in order to reduce the influence of the Dutch and also that of the Muslim families of Indian descent who dominated administration on Siam's Indian Ocean seaboard. In autumn 1683, following the departure of his daughters for England, White visited the Siamese capital, Ayutthaya, where he was created a mandarin of the third rank and <i>shabandar</i> (harbourmaster) of Mergui. His responsibilities included collecting and managing royal revenues in the province of Tenasserim and the supervision of Siamese maritime interests in the Bay of Bengal. He was also expected to fortify Mergui and assemble a fleet of armed merchant ships, which, with French help, could dominate trade in the Bay of Bengal. Not only did this set Samuel White at odds with his former employers, the East India Company, but it also placed him in a potentially treasonable relationship to England. White did not care which European power was dominant in the area, if his private fortune was assured.<br>
<br>In this aim White achieved a spectacular beginning. Having assembled his fleet and installed English captains on each, he began an undeclared war against the trade of Burma and the Indian kingdom of Golconda (Hyderabad). Narai had at first encouraged an aggressive policy but was persuaded to moderate his stance by advisers sympathetic to Golconda; White ignored orders to avoid confrontation, and encouraged his captains to seize independent, Golcondan, or Burmese vessels alike. He seems to have wished to avoid challenging the East India Company directly, but some of his captains did seize ships belonging to company officials. All vessels belonging to the two selected states plying the Bay of Bengal were at risk, and over a period of two years many were captured. The prize ships were sent to neutral ports under White's influence, and their cargoes were sold as White's private property, realizing about &pound;30,000, of which he sent half back to England, retaining the balance as working capital. Not contenting himself with using his post at Mergui to underpin his operations as a pirate, White also embezzled the funds provided by King Narai for the fortifications of Mergui and drew the wages for an entirely fictitious garrison of soldiers. He was investigated by the Siamese authorities in 1686, but had Phaulkon's support at Ayutthaya and was cleared of wrongdoing.<br>
<br>By this time the Siamese alliance with France and White's piratical activities were causing serious concern to the East India Company, which accordingly asked James II to issue a proclamation against Englishmen sailing under foreign flags. James's proclamation recalled all Englishmen in the king of Siam's service; armed with this authority Elihu Yale, the company's president of Madras, dispatched a small force to Mergui, commanded by Captain Anthony Weltden on the <i>Curtana</i>, to seize White's ships by way of reparations and to demand the surrender of all the English inhabitants. Weltden arrived off Mergui in June 1687.<br>
<br>White was aware that foreigners had become unpopular in Siam, and was already planning his escape. He took the precaution of providing himself with a forged pass from the Siamese court, as a protection against prosecution for piracy, and put up only a token resistance to Weltden, sacrificing a Siamese ship before surrendering. Within a month he and Weltden were on excellent terms, spending many evenings drinking together and amusing themselves with thunderous gun salutes while awaiting favourable winds for the voyage to Madras. The sleepless nights helped exhaust the patience of Mergui's inhabitants with White's self-interest; on the night of 14 July 1687 they opened fire with the shore batteries, sinking one of Weltden's ships, then combed Mergui for foreigners and slaughtered every European they could find. The charmed White escaped injury, while Weltden survived a blow to the head only thanks to the thick hat he was wearing. Taking two ships White and Weltden withdrew to Burma; following Weltden's display of incompetence, neither was anxious for an early encounter with the company's officials in India. The ships arrived off Madras in December 1687, but Weltden allowed White to land 30 miles north of Madras to avoid being arrested by the company. White hurried back to England, arriving there before news of the massacre at Mergui, for which he expected to be blamed. He was alleged to have told the Siamese that Weltden had come to seize the town on the company's behalf. In escaping he avoided the fate of Phaulkon, who was executed in April 1688.<br>
<br>White managed to bring the bulk of his wealth home with him, and in the changed political climate following the flight of James II initiated a lawsuit against the East India Company, claiming &pound;40,000 in damages. He argued that he had ruled from Mergui in the company's interest but had been ordered by Narai to attack Golconda. He also claimed that he had been about to leave for England as Narai's ambassador when Weltden arrived. This was obviously a pre-emptive ploy to counter any charges which the company might prefer against him, but before what would surely have been a fascinating case could be brought to court, Samuel White died suddenly in April 1689. He was buried at Bath Abbey on 27 April 1689. His brother George took up his case, but the company, using the evidence of White's colleague Francis Davenport, showed that White's account did not bear scrutiny.<br>
<br>George White's name has been linked with the Dowgate Adventurers (or Dowgate Association, named for their meeting place in the City), a group who sought to challenge the East India Company's monopoly by legitimate means. In this they had some success, leading to the establishment of a new East India Company, and eventually its merger with the old to provide a broad-based company with more shareholders. George White was still active in 1702, when he corresponded with Thomas Pitt. However, ultimately the White brothers' activities in Siam proved disastrous for British and indeed European interests. The East India Company directors noted in 1691 that &#145;Syam never did nor will bring the Company two pence advantage, but many thousands of pounds of loss&#146;  (Keay, 204). The policies followed by Narai and Phaulkon had led to conflict with the East India Company and the Dutch, but left Siam open to exploitation by France as well as by adventurers such as the Whites. Narai's death in 1688 was followed by a period of Siamese isolation from interaction with European powers, which would last for over a century.<br>
