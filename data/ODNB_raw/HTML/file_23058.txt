<span class="headword">Shrewsbury <span class="st"> [Bolde]</span>,  Ralph</span>  (<em>c.</em>1286&#150;1363), <span class="occ">bishop of Bath and Wells</span>, was of obscure origins, but he may have been connected with the Bold family of the parish of Aston Botterell, Shropshire. Through much of his life he had strong ties with Shrewsbury Abbey, where he probably gained his early education, and his toponym was perhaps as much derived from the abbey as the town. His first certain connection with the abbey was his appointment to the rectory of Edgmond, Shropshire, in its patronage in July 1305. The income from this, his first benefice, helped him to study at Oxford University and by 1308 he had graduated MA. For the next twenty years his life was devoted to study. He gained the unusual distinction of two doctorates, the first by 1317 in canon law, and the second, by 1329, in theology. His standing at Oxford led to his appointment as chancellor of the university in the course of 1328, a post he retained until November 1329.<br>
<br>While he was at Oxford, Shrewsbury's career progressed slowly by the standards of successful clerics of his day and, unlike them, he is not known to have undertaken royal or ecclesiastical service. Edgmond remained his only benefice until 1317, when he became a canon of Wells. Shrewsbury Abbey continued to be his patron thereafter, presenting him to the rectories of Walton-on-Trent, Derbyshire, in 1319 and Hodnet, Shropshire, in 1328. On the death of Bishop Droxford of Wells, Shrewsbury was elected his successor by the chapter of Wells on 2 June 1329. Although the royal assent quickly followed, on 28 June, and although by 3 September he had been consecrated, it soon became clear this would be a contested appointment. An alternative candidate emerged, in the form of Robert Wyville, Queen Isabella's secretary. On 12 June and 2 August royal letters were sent to Pope John XXII unsuccessfully pressing Wyville's claim, probably at the queen's instigation. For nearly a year Shrewsbury's position was insecure, until his rival was papally provided to the see of Salisbury. After a long series of letters by Shrewsbury to the pope and leading cardinals, an appeal for support to Roger Mortimer, a testimonial from the chancellor of Oxford University, and the payment of a substantial sum of money, Pope John confirmed his appointment on 30 May 1330, six weeks after Wyville's provision.<br>
<br>Shrewsbury's lasting importance rests on his pastoral activities during the thirty-four years he was a diocesan bishop. Historians have regarded him as an exemplary medieval bishop and in his lifetime he gained a reputation for sanctity. His register, which survives for the bulk of his episcopate, shows him to have been a conscientious pastor. From July 1331 he spent most of his time in his diocese, rarely leaving for more than a few weeks each year and scarcely at all during the last decade of his life. He regularly travelled round it, diligently carrying out his episcopal functions, until illness and advancing age confined him to a favourite manor. He sought to improve the standards of the clergy, beginning with regular visitations of the diocese in the 1330s which seem to have continued for the rest of his episcopate. To the same end he encouraged clerical education by frequently granting dispensations for absence to study. The same mixture of discipline and encouragement was applied to the major religious houses of the diocese. In 1337 he secured the right to disafforest the manor of Cheddar, ending the use of forest law there and earning popular approval in the diocese. During the black death his pastoral care extended to arranging emergency provision for the sick to make confession to the laity where no clergy were available.<br>
<br>Shrewsbury was a notable benefactor of Wells Cathedral, taking a close interest in it throughout his episcopate and making a visitation of it three times. In 1335&#150;7 he revived the requirement of the chancellor to lecture on theology or canon law, modelling it on the practice at Oxford University. His principal benefactions at Wells were to the minor clergy, enabling the vicars and choristers to live a communal life. The Vicars' Hall, begun in 1348, and probably the Vicars' Close, were built at his expense and at the same time they received a new constitution and endowment. In 1349 the choristers also received an endowment, and in 1354 a house was built for them. Shrewsbury was a keen builder, responsible for the magnificent moat and walls of the bishop's palace in Wells, begun after 1340, and for work at several episcopal manors, some of which the chapter later regarded as unduly extravagant. He increased the revenue of the see by appropriating the rectory of Great Chew to it in 1341.<br>
<br>As bishop, Shrewsbury was able to repay the earlier generosity of Shrewsbury Abbey by establishing a chantry there in 1345, endowed with the manor of Burton near Condover, Shropshire, and cancelling a debt of &pound;20 in his will. His last years, burdened with ill health, were largely spent at Wiveliscombe where he died on 14 August 1363 aged nearly eighty. He was buried in Wells Cathedral in front of the high altar, beneath an alabaster effigy which can now be seen in the north choir aisle. For some thirty years after his death his tomb was a popular place of veneration. In this respect Shrewsbury takes his place within a wider fourteenth-century tradition of unofficial cults around saintly bishops.<br>
