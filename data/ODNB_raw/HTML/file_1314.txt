<span class="headword">Bannerman <span class="st"> [Bannermann]</span>,  Alexander</span>  (<em>b. </em>1730s, <em>d.</em> in or after 1774), <span class="occ">printmaker</span>, was probably born in Cambridge. Nothing is known of his youth or education and most of what is known of him has to be deduced from his work. Bannerman worked principally as a copper-engraver and specialized in reproductions of old master works, most of which were published by Alderman John Boydell. According to T. Mortimer's <span class="italic">The Universal Director</span> (1763) he was a &#145;History and Architecture Engraver&#146;, but his exhibits at the Society of Artists, between 1761 and 1774, suggest an interest in Dutch genre, for example <span class="italic">A Fiddler</span> after Ostade and religious scenes after eighteenth-century favourites such as Guido Reni and Spagnoletto. In 1762 he was lodging in Great Queen Street, London, with a fellow engraver, &#145;Mr Basire&#146;, but in 1766 he moved to Fountain Court in the Strand before returning to Cambridge in 1770.<br>
<br>In addition to the information provided in the exhibition catalogues of the Society of Artists, several comments in Horace Walpole's correspondence are also revealing. Bannerman's relationship with him began about 1762 when Walpole was preparing his <span class="italic">Anecdotes of Painting</span> for the press. Developed from George Vertue's manuscripts <span class="italic">Anecdotes</span> was the first ever history of British art and this fact must have ensured a large degree of exposure for Bannerman. He worked on this venture alongside engravers such as Thomas Chambars and Johann Sebastien M&uuml;ller, producing thirty-two of the portrait heads that illustrated Walpole's first three volumes.<br>
<br>When he came to commission the illustrations for the fourth volume of <span class="italic">Anecdotes of Painting</span>, Walpole was keen to use Bannerman, &#145;though there will be a little trouble, as he does not reside in London&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 1.198). Despite his relocation to Cambridge, Walpole was happy to employ Bannerman because he could rely on the Revd William Cole to keep an eye on his progress. This was important to Walpole as he appears to have had little trust in Bannerman's rate of work, his accuracy, or his commitment. One can do little more than speculate upon the causes, but in March 1771 Walpole was &#145;very &hellip; angry with Bannerman, who shall do nothing for me&#146;  (ibid., 14.188). Consequently, he asked Thomas Gray, another of his emissaries, to take all outstanding work from Bannerman and &#145;deliver them to Mr Tyson's engraver&#146;  (ibid.). Apart from his submissions to the Society of Artists exhibitions of 1773 and 1774 nothing more is heard of Bannerman.<br>
