<span class="headword">Mettingham,  John  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1301), <span class="occ">justice</span>, makes his first appearance in surviving records in 1270, when he brought an action of trespass in the common bench as rector of Shotley in Suffolk. He was probably already a clerk of Gilbert of Preston (<i>d</i>. 1274), the chief justice of that court, and his service to Preston may date back to at least 1265. After Preston's death he received appointment as one of the regular justices of the newly established assize circuits in 1274. When arrangements were made in the summer of 1278 to create two permanent circuits of the general eyre he was one of the justices appointed to the &#145;northern&#146; circuit. He sat as a junior justice on every eyre of that circuit until 1288. He became chief justice of the circuit for the Dorset eyre of 1288. Mettingham seems to have been assigned special responsibility for hearing <i>quo warranto</i> and related pleas on his eyre circuit, but this was certainly not the only business that he heard. Extant reports and other evidence show that he also sat in on the hearing of ordinary civil litigation in at least five counties.<br>
<br>From 1285 onwards Mettingham was also (like most of his colleagues) assigned to take assizes during vacations in one of the newly reorganized assize circuits. Mettingham was fortunate to escape conviction during the so-called &#145;state trials&#146; of 1289&#150;93. When one complainant alleged that Mettingham had been sitting in the common bench while the complainant had had his proper challenges to jurors refused, the auditors of complaints simply accepted his statement that he had been sitting on the bench not as a justice but as a well-wisher of the complainant's opponent (the prior of Sempringham). In a series of other cases from eyres where Mettingham had been one of the justices, the auditors accepted his &#145;record&#146; that he had not been sitting in the court when the case concerned was decided. By the time these cases were heard Mettingham had replaced the disgraced Thomas of Weyland (<i>d</i>. 1298) as chief justice of the common bench, a post he held from the beginning of 1290 until the time of his death. During this period, as the surviving reports show, Mettingham was clearly the major figure in his court, though this dominance came increasingly to be shared from the mid-1290s with his colleague William Bereford (<i>d</i>. 1326).<br>
<br>John of Mettingham was a beneficed clergyman and seems to have left no children. He died between the end of Trinity term and 19 September 1301, when Ralph Hengham (<i>d</i>. 1311) replaced him as chief justice of the common bench.<br>
