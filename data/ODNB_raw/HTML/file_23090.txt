<span class="headword">Ramsey <span class="st"> [Ramsay, Bowle]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1551), <span class="occ">prior of Merton and religious pamphleteer</span>, is first recorded in 1513, when, as an Augustinian canon, he attended St Mary's College, Oxford. He supplicated for his BA in 1514, and for his BTh in 1522, being admitted to the latter degree on 26 June. In 1528 he was <i>prior studentium</i> at St Mary's, but two years later, on 18 February 1530, he became prior of Merton, Surrey, an office he held until the dissolution of the house on 13 April 1538. On 9 May following Ramsey&#151;under the name of John Bowle (probably his family name)&#151;received an annual pension of 200 marks, together with the promise for life of the prior's London house in Trinity Lane.<br>
<br>It is not surprising that Ramsey should have adapted easily to monastic dissolution and protestant reformation, for he had clearly come to hold advanced literary and religious opinions. Among the eight books which survive from his library is Erasmus's <span class="italic">Enchiridion</span>, and while he was still prior of Merton, in 1537 his fellow canon Thomas Paynell dedicated to him &#145;Comparation of a vyrgin and a martyr&#146;, the translation of another of Erasmus's works which Ramsey had commissioned. On 3 July 1545 he was admitted rector of Woodchurch, Kent, a benefice he held until his death in September 1551.<br>
<br>The former prior of Merton should not be confused with a namesake, probably an Ipswich artisan, who was active as a protestant pamphleteer under Edward VI. One of his writings, <span class="italic">Communication Betw. a Poore Man and his Wife</span>, recorded in 1595, is now lost. Of the other two, <span class="italic">A Plaister for a Galled Horse</span>, published in 1548, may have been the first, since it promises another plaster if this one proves too cold. One of a group of attacks on the mass produced in this period, it derides Romish priests as &#145;blynde owles&#146;, and denounces them as traitors and heretics, while the mass itself is represented as an exercise in hypocrisy and superstition. Ramsey's other tract, <span class="italic">A Corosyfe to be Layed Hard unto the Hartes of all Faythfull Professours of Cristes Gospel</span>, is less knockabout in style. It calls on all to remember the full and final sacrifice of Christ, urging them to remember their battleaxe (Christ's cross), to keep their armour bright, and never again to lust after the fleshpots of Egypt. They should love their neighbours, have a care for the poor, and obey the magistrates, who are God's ministers on earth. Ramsey concludes by commending the king, wishing him long life.<br>
