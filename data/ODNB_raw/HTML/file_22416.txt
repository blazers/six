<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Plunket,  William Conyngham</span>, fourth Baron Plunket  (1828&#150;1897), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland archbishop of Dublin</span>, was born at 30 Upper Fitzwilliam Street, Dublin, on 26 August 1828, the eldest son of John Plunket QC (1793&#150;1871), afterwards third Baron Plunket, and Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1886), third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4160/', "Charles Kendal Bushe")</script>, lord chief justice of Ireland. His other grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22415/', "William Conyngham Plunket, first Baron Plunket")</script>.<br>
<br>Plunket was taught first at a day school in Dublin and afterwards at Seaforth rectory, near Liverpool, under the Revd William Rawson, who had taught W. E. Gladstone. In 1842 he was sent to Cheltenham College and rose to be head of the school. But at the age of eighteen his health broke down through overwork and he had to abandon plans to proceed to Cambridge. When, on 18 May 1847, he entered Trinity College, Dublin, he was not considered physically fit enough to follow an honours course. He graduated BA in 1853 and received the degrees of BD and DD in 1876. (He also received the honorary degree of LLD of Cambridge in 1888.) By 1857 he had recovered sufficiently to seek ordination. He became chaplain and private secretary to his uncle Thomas, second Baron Plunket, then bishop of Tuam, and in the following year was appointed rector of the united parishes of Kilmoylan and Cummer in that diocese, a virtual sinecure that enabled him to spend much time in Dublin and in other parts of the west.<br>
<br>The early years of Plunket's ministry brought him into close contact with the protestant evangelizing movement in Connemara and Mayo, and fostered a sympathy with minority protestant communities which was to be strongly evinced during his episcopal career in his relations with reformers in Spain, Portugal, and Italy. He became an active member of the Irish Church Missions Society to Roman Catholics (founded 1849), travelling through every district of west Connaught in aid of its work, and frequently visiting England to solicit financial support for the movement.<br>
<br>On 11 June 1863 Plunket married Annie Guinness (<i>d</i>. 1889), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11726/', "Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness")</script>, the wealthy brewer, who had funded the major restoration of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin (1864). Annie was largely responsible in her own right for the scheme of district nursing for the Dublin poor which became St Patrick's Nurses Home. Plunket was appointed treasurer of St Patrick's Cathedral in 1864 and precentor in 1869, his direct connection with the cathedral lasting until his election to the bishopric of Meath in 1876. His energy, earnestness, and administrative ability combined with his social position to give him a leading place in the evangelical party in the Church of Ireland, then facing disestablishment, which he strenuously opposed. During the debate on prayer book revision that immediately followed disestablishment, Plunket (who was a member of the revision committee) was looked on as the leader of those who sought to secure a radical revision in an evangelical direction. Even his friendly biographer found some of his proposed amendments surprising  (How, 106), a harsher verdict being that they were defeated &#145;by the good sense of the assembly which included churchmen far more learned than he was&#146;  (Leslie).<br>
<br>In 1871, on the death of his father, Plunket succeeded to the peerage. Five years later he was elected bishop of Meath and was consecrated at Armagh on 10 December 1876. His tenure of the see of County Meath, remarkable for having at the time no cathedral, and for conducting much of its administration from nearby Dublin, lasted for eight years, and during this period he spent much time in the capital.<br>
<br>In 1884, on the resignation of Archbishop Richard Chenevix Trench, Plunket was elected archbishop of the united dioceses of Dublin, Glendalough, and Kildare. It was as archbishop that he most displayed his qualities of forbearance and sensitivity towards schools of thought different from his own, and came to be respected as a fair and unprejudiced father in God. He had already revealed these attributes in 1871, when he supported the appointment to St Bartholomew's, Dublin, of Richard Travers Smith, a Tractarian holding views on liturgical revision very different from his own. Later, as Smith's archbishop, Plunket not only showed himself tolerant of an attitude to church ornaments which was the opposite of his own, but sought to accommodate both points of view. He also became a somewhat controversial figure, both in his own church and in the Church of England, through his championship of the cause of the protestant reformers in Spain. Especially in England this was viewed by many as an intrusion upon the episcopal domain of the Spanish Roman Catholic bishops, and was deprecated by most of the Church of England bishops. Plunket, however, regarded what was happening as reform from within, not proselytizing from without  (How, 259). His exertions in the cause of the conversion of Spain to protestantism extended over eighteen years; he undertook three separate journeys to Spain to satisfy himself of the progress of the reformation, and gave money without stint in its support. In 1894 he determined that the time for episcopal consecration of Se&ntilde;or Cabrera, the leader of the movement in Spain, had arrived, and on communicating his resolution to the Irish bishops to visit Spain in company with two of their number, the majority of his brother prelates declined to oppose his action. He hoped to receive a wider and more positive endorsement of his action (the fruits of which were to endure) at the next Lambeth conference, but his death intervened. Plunket left Ireland in the autumn of 1894, accompanied by the bishops of Clogher and Down, and on 23 September the ceremony of consecration was performed.<br>
<br>Almost as keen as Plunket's interest in the Spanish reformers was his sympathy with the reformed church in Italy. In 1886 he became president and chairman of the Italian Reform Association, and was active in his support of Count Campello and the leaders of that body. In his efforts on their behalf he acted in co-operation with the English bishops, and thus his work in Italy did not arouse the same degree of controversy as his intervention in Spain had excited. Both as bishop of Meath and particularly as archbishop of Dublin, he took a close interest in educational matters. He was convinced that it was vitally important that the church's primary schools should be within the national school system, and the transformation of the former Kildare Place teachers' institution into the state-recognized Church of Ireland Training College in 1884 owed much to his diplomatic skill.<br>
<br>Plunket died at the palace, St Stephen's Green, Dublin, on 1 April 1897, Lady Plunket having predeceased him in 1889. He was buried at Mount Jerome cemetery, Dublin, on 6 April, after a public funeral in St Patrick's Cathedral; a bronze statue by (William) Hamo Thornycroft RA was unveiled in Kildare Place, Dublin, on 16 April 1901 by the viceroy, Earl Cadogan. Plunket was succeeded as fifth Baron Plunket by his eldest son, William Lee Plunket (1864&#150;1920).<br>
<br>Plunket was essentially a man of affairs though a prolific pamphleteer on behalf of the causes he espoused. He enjoyed versifying, and some of his lines show that, although he abhorred the prospect of home rule, he had a strong sense of place as an Irishman. He wrote with feeling of the sufferings of the Irish rural poor, and saw no inconsistency between his admiration of their qualities and his strong support for an evangelical movement that sought to wean them from a church to which, quite clearly, they had strong ties of loyalty and affection. He was an extremely popular figure, particularly with the free churches. He regularly attended meetings with their leading clergy in the Evangelical Alliance, and looked forward to unity with other protestants as a strong possibility.<br>
