<span class="headword">Short,  Augustus</span>  (1802&#150;1883), <span class="occ">bishop of Adelaide</span>, third son of Charles Short, barrister, of the Middle Temple, London, was born on 11 June 1802. In 1809 he entered Westminster School, where his early days were the &#145;most wretched&#146; in his life, though relieved by the kindness of Charles Thomas Longley, afterwards archbishop of Canterbury. He was withdrawn for a time to a school at Langley Broom, near Slough, but returned to Westminster in 1811. He passed to Christ Church, Oxford, in May 1820, where he was placed under his cousin, Thomas Vowler Short, and took a first class in classics in 1823. He graduated BA in 1824 and MA in 1826. Short at first taught as a private tutor, but in 1826 he was ordained deacon at Oxford, and in 1827 priest, and licensed to the curacy of Culham, Oxfordshire. He resigned in 1829, on becoming tutor and lecturer at Christ Church; he was appointed librarian and censor in 1833, and in 1843 was select preacher to the university. In 1835 he accepted the living of Ravensthorpe, Northamptonshire, and in the same year he married Millicent Clara, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Phillips. The parish had been neglected, but Short rapidly organized it on a satisfactory basis. He had many friends among the Tractarians, and wrote (but did not publish) a defence of <span class="roman">Tract 90</span>, though he voted for the condemnation of W. G. Ward's <span class="italic">Ideal of a Christian Church</span> in 1845. In 1846 he delivered at Oxford the Bampton lectures entitled <span class="italic">The Witness of the Spirit with our Spirit</span>.<br>
<br>On the foundation in 1847 of the colonial sees of Cape Town, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Newcastle, Short was offered the choice of Adelaide or Newcastle. He chose the former, and was consecrated on 29 June 1847 and created DD of Oxford on 16 June. He sailed in September, and reached his diocese in December. There were on his arrival only eight Anglican clergy in his huge diocese (which included South and Western Australia), and the bishop's difficulties were further increased in 1851 by the discontinuance of the vote for maintenance of public worship. The young diocese was thus cast entirely upon its own resources. However, on a visit to England in 1853, Short found that the diocese could be organized with a constitution of its own, and he proceeded to set its affairs in order. In this he was completely successful, and showed himself a very capable administrator, his first synod being assembled in Adelaide in January 1855. He did his best to meet the needs of scattered communities in the bush, was keenly interested in work for the Aborigines (writing <span class="italic">Mission to the Heathen</span> in 1853), did much for the organization of education in the colony, and secured the building of Adelaide Cathedral in 1849. He was active in founding the University of Adelaide and was its vice-chancellor in 1874 and its chancellor from 1876. Short was, however, quite a controversial bishop, in that his Tractarian sympathies upset his chiefly evangelical flock. He visited England for the Lambeth conference of 1878.<br>
<br>Short was attacked by heart disease in 1881, and resigned the see. He left Australia in 1882, amid general expressions of respect, and took up his residence in London; but his illness returned, and he retired to Eastbourne, Sussex, where he died at his home, Sultan House, on 5 October 1883, his wife surviving him.<br>
<br>His eldest brother, <a name="cosubject_25458"></a><span class="headword">Charles William Short</span>  (1799&#150;1857)<span class="occ"></span>, joined the Coldstream Guards as ensign in 1814, was present with his regiment at Quatre Bras and in the defence of Hougoumont at Waterloo, and served in the army of occupation. In 1837 he left the army as captain and lieutenant-colonel, and became a merchant. In 1852 he went to live at Odiham in Hampshire, where, as in London, he was noted for his religious and philanthropic activity. He published treatises on the duties of the soldier, which had a wide circulation. He died at Odiham on 19 January 1857.<br>
