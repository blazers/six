<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Williams,  Thomas <span class="st"> [Tom]</span></span>, Baron Williams of Barnburgh  (1888&#150;1967), <span class="occ">trade unionist and politician</span>, was born at Blackwell, in Derbyshire, on 18 March 1888, the tenth of fourteen children (eleven of whom survived infancy) of James Williams (<i>d</i>. 1913), a miner, and his wife, Mary Ann Parton (<i>d</i>. 1924). Aged two, Williams moved with his family to Swinton, in the burgeoning south Yorkshire coalfield. At the age of eleven he left school and began work at nearby Kilnhurst colliery. He experienced directly the perils of mining: while working with his father, the latter was blinded in one eye and subsequently suffered complete blindness, and Richard, an older brother, was left disabled by a pit accident and spent the rest of his life confined to a wheelchair. Tom Williams soon became an active trade unionist and, like many young activists in the Yorkshire coalfield at this time, he rejected Lib&#150;Labism and was drawn to independent working-class politics.<br>
<br>Williams moved to Wath Main colliery and, aged twenty, was elected to the Yorkshire Miners' Association (YMA) branch. Married on 7 September 1910 to Elizabeth Ann Andrews (<i>d</i>. 1977), he was sacked in March 1912 for protesting about working conditions. Impressed by his rectitude and abstinence, the Wath Main YMA branch helped secure him the post of steward at the working men's club. Meanwhile he attended evening classes at Barnsley Technical Institute, qualifying as a deputy. At the same time his political horizons broadened. In 1914 he returned to the pits as a miner rather than an under-official, working at Elsecar Main, moving in 1915 to the new Barnburgh Main colliery, where he was elected checkweighman in 1916, YMA branch secretary, and subsequently branch delegate to the YMA council in Barnsley.<br>
<br>Already a member of the Independent Labour Party, Williams was drawn by the radicalizing effect of the 1914&#150;18 war to the British Socialist Party, although he speedily abandoned it in favour of the Labour Party. He can best be described as a &#145;non-ideological&#146; socialist, and established a reputation as something of a firebrand. He was, for example, a noted critic of the war in the YMA. There is fragmentary evidence that pit managers and YMA officials conspired (unsuccessfully) to have him &#145;combed out&#146; of the pit for military service in 1918. From 1918 he was a poor-law guardian for Doncaster, and in the following year he was elected a member of Bolton upon Dearne urban district council, which was regarded as one of the most progressive of the miner-dominated local councils, especially in the field of housing.<br>
<br>In October 1920, with the backing of the YMA, Williams was invited to contest the Don Valley constituency as Labour candidate at the next general election. The seat had been held since 1918 by James Walton, the YMA delegate for the powerful Manvers Main colliery, who had failed to gain the official nomination and won the seat as National Democratic and Labour Party candidate against Edward Hough, the official candidate. Walton had been an enthusiastic supporter of the war and of co-operation between management and men; Williams was a noted opponent of both. In November 1922 Williams defeated Walton and took the Don Valley seat for Labour, retaining it until he retired from the Commons in 1959. He served as ministerial bag-carrier (parliamentary private secretary) to N. E. Noel-Buxton, the minister of agriculture, in the 1924 Labour government, and to Margaret Bondfield, the minister of labour, in the 1929 government.<br>
<br>Williams's rise in the Labour ranks was helped by the decimation of 1931. Few of the survivors, among whom mining MPs were prominent, were thought capable of carrying the burdens of opposition, but Williams was identified as one of those capable of so doing. The Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) enjoyed a surfeit of experts on the coal industry, so after 1931 Williams rapidly carved a role as Labour's expert on agriculture. This was not particularly strange as his constituency was, apart from the pit villages, rural and agricultural, and as a poor-law guardian he was well aware of the plight of agricultural communities, where social and economic conditions were even worse than in the pit villages. During these opposition years Williams gained the respect not only of the PLP but also of the Conservative benches for his knowledge of and sympathy with agriculture. In this period he grew close to Attlee, seconding David Grenfell's motion at a meeting of the PLP in November 1935 that Attlee should continue as party leader until after the general election. This reflected the strong mutual respect between Attlee and the mining MPs; in old age Attlee described Williams as &#145;a grand man&#146;  (Harris, 561).<br>
<br>In 1940 Churchill appointed Williams as R. S. Hudson's deputy at the Ministry of Agriculture. Inter-war agriculture, like coal, had suffered from a severe depression, and Williams recognized the war, with its demand for maximum food production, as an opportunity to revive the industry. Production was hindered by the farmers' suspicion of government, which was resolved partly by the seriousness of the national crisis but also by the careful nurturing of relationships with farmers, in which Williams played a leading role. The Ministry of Agriculture had huge compulsory powers, but Williams preferred to work by co-operation and to help farmers farm well and profitably. Intervention on this scale was bound to provoke resistance, but a community of interest brought the ministry and the National Farmers' Union (NFU) closer together. The farmers ensured food production in return for government-guaranteed prices. Williams conceded this system was neither perfect nor problem free, but it had the virtue of working. Williams entrenched ministry&#150;NFU wartime co-operation and the guaranteed price system as the basis of the <span class="roman">Agriculture Act</span> (1947). He faced suspicion not only from the farmers but also criticism from the Labour Party at the 1946 conference for feather-bedding the farmers and not doing enough for the farmworkers. As with Bevan and the doctors, Williams recognized his dependence on the farmers, and that the <span class="roman">Agriculture Act</span> and annual price review system were designed to give agriculture a degree of stability and financial security. In turn, this would lead to better wages and conditions for agricultural workers. The act has been described as a &#145;dramatically effective measure&#146;  (Morgan, 304).<br>
<br>Politically Williams was very much a centrist in the 1945&#150;51 Labour government, although he was strongly anti-communist and hostile to industrial disputes which, he felt, undermined the Labour government. He supported, for example, the postponing of steel nationalization, but was an enthusiastic supporter of Bevan's plans for the National Health Service. In opposition he remained agriculture spokesman until his retirement in 1959. In February 1961 he was made a life peer. He was sworn of the privy council in 1941, and from 1961 was one of three members of the political honours scrutiny committee.<br>
<br>In his foreword to Williams's autobiography, <span class="italic">Digging for Britain</span> (1965), Attlee described Williams as &#145;the most distinguished&#146; of a group &#145;of young miners of remarkable quality&#146; who entered the Commons in 1922; as minister of agriculture he judged that Williams &#145;effected nothing less than a revolution in British agriculture&#146; and that &#145;his place in history is assured as the greatest British Minister of Agriculture of all time&#146;  (Attlee, 7&#150;8). Williams's political career reflected his strong conviction that the purpose of political activity&#151;in the union or in parliament&#151;was to make a difference to the lives of working-class people. He was no class warrior, and his early militancy, a reflection of a sense of personal and collective injustice, was intended as a lever to secure a fair deal for the powerless within the <i>status quo</i>, using the union and the Labour Party as its instrument. His career in local and national politics, culminating in the 1945&#150;51 government, convinced him that radical reform was possible. His later years were marred by rheumatoid arthritis. Tom Williams died at his home, 46 Town Moor Avenue, Doncaster, on 29 March 1967, being survived by his wife and their son (who was formerly married to Herbert Morrison's daughter) and daughter.<br>
