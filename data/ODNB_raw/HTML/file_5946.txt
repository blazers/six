<span class="headword">Collins,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Brush Collins]</span>  (1742&#150;1808), <span class="occ">actor and poet</span>, was born in Bath and baptized at Bath Abbey on 24 September 1742, the son of William Collins, a tailor, and his wife, Elizabeth. After serving an apprenticeship to a staymaker Collins became an actor. His first appearance was at Bath. A number of other actors named Collins were active at the time, and it is not always clear from contemporary records which was which. For example, in his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, Charles Lee Lewes claimed that Collins had been in George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span> (as Captain Plume) at Covent Garden, but failed on account of a cold and returned to the provinces, but this is not borne out by the playbills. If it was John Collins who acted at Birmingham in 1762, it was the beginning of a long association with that city. When he appeared in Dublin in 1764 Collins was announced as from Edinburgh, and proved &#145;a very respectable acquisition to the Irish stage&#146;  (Hitchcock, 2.133&#150;8). There was a Collins in Roger Kemble's company in Coventry and Bath in 1766 and 1767&#150;8, and Margaret Cavendish Bentinck, duchess of Portland, recommended a Collins to Garrick in 1767. Garrick was unimpressed, describing him as having &#145;the most unpromising aspect for an Actor I ever saw&#151;a small pair of unmeaning Eyes stuck in a round unthinking face&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 3.398), a physical description that could apply to John Collins.<br>
<br>Anthony Pasquin's suggestion that Collins worked as a miniature painter in Ireland appears, according to Strickland, to be based on a confusion between Collins and his wife, Ann Shellard or Shillards, whom he married at Walcot church in Bath on 24 January 1768. She was a portrait painter who died, at an unknown date, after surgery for breast cancer. They had no children.<br>
<br>Collins's main claim to theatrical fame lies in his development of a kind of cabaret performance that combined his own light verse with songs, imitations of popular actors, and dialect performances. Dr Thomas Campbell of Clogher, who saw Collins perform his show in London in 1775 as &#145;A Lecture upon Oratory&#146;, noted that &#145;the fellow displayed good enunciation and good sense&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 3.399). Early in 1776 Collins was in Belfast, acting in <span class="italic">The West Indian</span> and performing his entertainment as &#145;The element of modern oratory&#146;. He was apparently a member of the company at the King Street Theatre, Birmingham, for some seasons and, according to the <span class="italic">Carlisle Magazine</span> (5 Oct 1776), was the author of a tragedy, <span class="italic">King Charles I, or, The Royal Martyr</span>, staged in Birmingham in September of that year, which he followed with his &#145;satirical, mimical and analytical lecture on modern oratory&#146;. He was also apparently co-owner of the Concert Booth, &#145;a small theatre in Moseley Road&#146;  (newspaper cutting, Birmingham Central Library) that burned down in 1778. Sylas Neville saw Collins in Norwich on 6 November 1784, and noted in his diary that &#145;he gives specimens of bad as well as good acting&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 3.399) and that his best imitations were of Garrick, Barry, Macklin, and Powell, each in character.<br>
<br>In 1788 Collins was living at 7 Shorter Street, Wellclose Square, London. In 1790 he was a partner with King and Chapman in a bookseller's at 38 King Street, Covent Garden, where he performed in the evenings. In February that year the <span class="italic">Biographical and Imperial Magazine</span> praised his &#145;union &hellip; of classical wit with eccentric humour&#146;. Collins performed his entertainment in many venues in London and in the provinces, bowing out in 1795 at York. The performance generally went under the title of <span class="italic">The Brush</span> or <span class="italic">The Evening Brush</span>, because, according to an advertisement of 1793, it was intended &#145;for rubbing off the rust of care&#146;. Collins thus became popularly known as Brush Collins. <span class="italic">The Brush</span> was published in Newcastle about 1800, and a well-used partial manuscript is now in the Birmingham Central Library. According to James Winston, Collins may have been an innkeeper in Plymouth and an auctioneer in Bath in the 1790s, but he was performing and living in Birmingham in 1793 and about 1798 became joint owner with Miles Swinney of a newspaper, the <span class="italic">Birmingham Chronicle</span>, for which he wrote many poems and essays on local events. Collins probably owed his inclusion in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> to William Palgrave's decision to reprint one of these poems, &#145;Tomorrow&#146;, in <span class="italic">The Golden Treasury</span>. At that point only his surname was known, but further details soon emerged, mainly through <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>, to form the basis of his entry. In 1804 Collins and Swinney published a collection of his poems and songs under the title <span class="italic">Scripscrapologia, or, Collins's Doggerel Dish of All Sorts</span>. Miss Brent, a niece, lived with Collins in Birmingham, where he died on 2 May 1808.<br>
