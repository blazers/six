<span class="headword">Bowtell <span class="st"> [Boudle]</span>,  John</span>  (1753&#150;1813), <span class="occ">bookbinder and philanthropist</span>, the third son of Joseph Boudle (<i>c</i>.1722&#150;1757) and his wife, Margery (<i>c</i>.1720&#150;1780), was born on 1 August 1753, and baptized John Boudle on 15 September 1753 at Holy Trinity Church in Cambridge, where his parents had been resident at least since 1748. The adoption of the form Bowtell was apparently John's initiative. He may have been apprenticed as a stationer to John (&#145;Maps&#146;) Nicholson, and was established as a binder from at least 20 September 1785, the date of the first among many surviving bills for binding for Cambridge University Library, one of which was for an elaborate and skilful piece of repair binding. Most of his work in this line, however, issuing from his shop in Trinity Street in Cambridge, was more workaday, albeit effective, as many of his bindings remain in place today. It has been estimated that between one-third and one-half of Cambridge University Library's manuscripts were repaired and rebound by him, as well as very many printed books, including those from John Moore's library.<br>
<br>Bowtell was also a collector of manuscripts, fossils, and other curiosities. The bulk of his collections were left to the newly founded Downing College, where his books and manuscripts remain. Apart from his notes on the history of the town and university of Cambridge, they contain many items removed from earlier bindings, and a substantial collection of miscellaneous deeds for the town and county of Cambridge and surrounding counties. Among these are a number relating to two tenements in Fairyard Lane, Cambridge, including one by which the property was leased in 1759 by one Mary, widow of John Bowdle of Cambridge, barber, conceivably a relation. Also to be found in his collection are accounts of the Cambridge borough treasurer from 1515 to 1786, with substantial gaps in the eighteenth century. He made many notes for a history of the town of Cambridge and prepared a text in eight volumes, never printed. He was also a keen bell-ringer, and in 1788 rang on the 30-cwt tenor bell of Great St Mary's, Cambridge, 6609 changes &#145;in the method of <i>bob maximus</i> generally termed <i>twelve-in</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>).<br>
<br>In October 1786 Bowtell married at St Edward's, Cambridge, Ann Scarr (1742&#150;1807), sister-in-law of his older brother Joseph. They had no surviving children, and after his wife's death on 2 November 1807 a niece, Mary Ann Scarr, kept house for Bowtell, and was rewarded by a legacy of &pound;3000. From his binding, bookselling and transcribing business, and perhaps from the invention of a paper leather-substitute for bindings, for which he claimed in an advertisement of 1798 to have obtained a &#145;considerable premium&#146;, Bowtell amassed considerable wealth. In 1809 he gave to Addenbrooke's Hospital 3 per cent Consols to the value of &pound;100, and by his will he further endowed it with &pound;7000 of the same stock&#151;about half his estate&#151;a bequest which, after its terms had been interpreted by the master in chancery, enabled additional buildings which marked a turning point in the development of the hospital.<br>
<br>Bowtell died in Trinity Street on 1 December 1813 and was buried with his wife in St Michael's Church. His further bequests included, again in 3 per cent Consols: &pound;500-worth, the dividends to be applied by Trinity College to the repair of the church and chancel of St Michael's; &pound;1000-worth, also to be administered by Trinity via the churchwardens for &#145;repairing and beautifying the church and steeple&#146; of Holy Trinity Church; and &pound;500-worth to the trustees of Hobson's Charity for the apprenticing of poor boys from Cambridge. His portrait was preserved in Addenbrooke's Hospital until its theft in recent years.<br>
<br>John Bowtell is not to be confused with his nephew, also John Bowtell, assistant at Cambridge University Library from <i>c</i>.1818, who compiled a catalogue which remained in use until 1861. As both part-author and victim of the chaos into which the library had descended, he was dismissed in 1852, with an annual pension of &pound;100.<br>
