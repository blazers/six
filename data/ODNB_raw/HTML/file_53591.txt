<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Herbert,  (Mary) Elizabeth</span>, Lady Herbert of Lea  (1822&#150;1911), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic convert and philanthropist</span>, was born on 21 July 1822, the only daughter of General Charles Ashe &Agrave; Court Repington (1785&#150;1861), sometime MP for Heytesbury, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Gibbs (<i>d</i>. 1878), daughter of a West Indies planter. Elizabeth &agrave; Court Repington was a highly gifted young woman of considerable beauty, whose family moved in widely influential circles. She numbered among her friends Lady Dufferin and Lady Canning (both wives of future viceroys of India), and this circle was widened further after her marriage. On 12 August 1846, when she was twenty-four, she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13047/', "Sidney Herbert (1810&#150;1861)")</script>, half-brother to the twelfth earl of Pembroke, whom she had known since childhood. They had four sons: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13027/', "George Robert Charles Herbert, who became thirteenth earl of Pembroke")</script>; Sidney, who succeeded him as fourteenth earl; Reginald, who became a naval officer and was drowned at sea in 1870; and Michael, who became ambassador in Washington in 1902. Their daughters were Mary, who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36666/', "Baron Friedrich von H&#252;gel")</script>, philosopher and mystic; Elizabeth Maude, who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35393/', "Sir Hubert Parry")</script>, the composer; and Constance Gladys, who married firstly the fourth earl of Lonsdale, and, following his untimely death, Lord de Grey, who later became second marquess of Ripon.<br>
<br>Following her marriage Elizabeth Herbert took a keen interest in politics and did much of her husband's secretarial work. During the winter of 1847, while on their delayed wedding tour in Rome, the Herberts met Florence Nightingale for the first time. That meeting resulted in the close friendship which later assisted Florence Nightingale in her efforts to send nurses to Scutari during the Crimean War. The early days of Elizabeth Herbert's marriage saw the formation of other important friendships, notably with Henry Manning, whom she met while he was an Anglican. An old schoolfriend of Sidney Herbert, Manning was introduced to Elizabeth as &#145;the holiest man I have ever met&#146;. The friendship blossomed and he assumed the role of her spiritual director until he left the Church of England in 1851.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Herbert was very concerned about the plight of the poor, especially unemployed domestic servants who were considered to be in grave moral danger. For such women, often the only alternative to the workhouse was to resort to petty crime or prostitution. Early attempts at rescue work on behalf of the Church of England, such as the Clewer House of Mercy founded near Windsor by Mariquita Tennant in 1849, received the enthusiastic support of both Elizabeth Herbert and her friend and near neighbour W. E. Gladstone. Her letters to Mrs Tennant reflect a genuine concern for the underprivileged, which was both practical and down-to-earth. The Herberts also enthusiastically supported a number of state-assisted emigration schemes for the poor.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Herbert's social concern was born of her firm religious convictions. She was brought up in the Church of England and later recalled her early experience of religion as &#145;utterly and entirely distasteful&#146;, but with the coming of the Oxford Movement she found &#145;all that my heart and mind had longed for and hungered after for years&#151;I found life, and warmth and practice&#146;. The secession of Archdeacon Henry Manning to the Roman Catholic church was a blow which was widely felt, indeed Gladstone commented, &#145;It was not a parting: it was a death.&#146; On a personal level it meant the severance of the friendship and spiritual counsel which had been so important to Elizabeth Herbert. She later described it as a &#145;sort of a religious shipwreck&#146; and from this time onwards she began to have serious doubts about Anglicanism. At first she discussed this with her husband but, finding that it worried him, ceased doing so. If she had followed Manning at that time there would have been serious repercussions for her husband politically&#151;the country was embroiled in the Crimean War and Sidney Herbert was secretary of state for war&#151;and as the heir to his half-brother, the twelfth earl of Pembroke. Elizabeth laid aside her &#145;wracking doubts&#146; and channelled her energies into supporting her husband and assisting Florence Nightingale in her scheme to send a task force of female nurses to the battle front.<br>
<br>Sidney Herbert never recovered from the stress his high office had placed on him: he died on 2 August 1861, just eight months after being created a baron, with the title Lord Herbert of Lea. During her mourning Lady Herbert retired at first to the south of France and subsequently to Rome. Her religious doubts increased and she once more sought counsel from Manning. Meantime, it was widely rumoured in English society that she had joined the Roman Catholic church. Her husband's family gave notice that if she took such a step they would make her children wards in chancery, her eldest son now being the heir to the earl of Pembroke. This threat greatly added to her confusion in addition to the grief of widowhood. And there were other matters to be considered too: Sidney Herbert had been a loyal Anglican and had built a magnificent church in Wilton, costing &pound;30,000, where he was buried. Elizabeth went there daily to pray while at Wilton, and was organist in the chapel in the house which she and her husband had restored. She also knew she would be exchanging a respected position in society for &#145;the contempt and distrust of all those whose good opinion I most valued&#146;. Not least among these was Gladstone, and when, after much turmoil, she finally took the step, it marked the end of a long and valued friendship, though he continued to involve himself in her children's education.<br>
<br>On 5 January 1866 Lady Herbert was received into the Roman Catholic church in a private ceremony at Palermo in Sicily. Having returned to England she was advised by Archbishop Manning to visit Father (later Cardinal) Herbert Vaughan who was establishing a missionary brotherhood at Mill Hill. From their first meeting in October 1866 an extraordinary spiritual friendship developed which has been compared with that of St Francis of Sales and St Jane Frances de Chantal: it lasted until Vaughan's death in 1903. Lady Herbert's conversion had resulted in her estrangement from family and friends and severance from her Anglican charities. She now embraced the missionary cause embodied in the work of the Mill Hill Fathers, as they became known. Through her financial help, and that of her new Catholic friends, Vaughan was able to realize his vision. From its beginnings at Holcombe House, the buildings expanded down the hill with the construction of St Joseph's College, the foundation stone of which was laid on 29 June 1869.<br>
<br>The college at Mill Hill took several years to complete, during which time missionary priests were being trained and sent abroad. The college chapel was consecrated in March 1875, one of the celebrants being Vaughan, by now a bishop. Vaughan's letters to Lady Herbert (her letters to him have not survived) reveal the depth of trust between them; there was also a great bond of mutual affection and a wide range of interests, as well as humour. It was a friendship of mutual need and encouragement: he consulted her widely on all his projects and respected her advice; she listened to his spiritual counsel and took comfort from it in her loss of family ties. Elizabeth Herbert's conversion to Roman Catholicism was total, her only regret being that, of her seven children, only Mary, wife of the mystic Baron Friedrich von H&uuml;gel, shared her Catholic faith (her husband's friends went to considerable lengths to see that this was so).<br>
<br>As in her Anglican days, Lady Herbert's influence covered a wide spectrum. For many years she acted as honorary treasurer of St Joseph's Foreign Missionary Society, Mill Hill, and hosted its meetings at Herbert House, 38 Chesham Place, Belgrave Square. She gave considerable sums from her own resources to this work and extracted further donations from her circle. The Sisters of Charity were also closely associated with the Mill Hill mission, and Lady Herbert founded and maintained a girl's orphanage at Salisbury which the sisters ran. Another project which Lady Herbert enthusiastically embraced and financially assisted was that of Westminster Cathedral. Cardinal Manning had not favoured the idea, but his successor, Cardinal Vaughan, did so and laid the foundation-stone in 1895, although he did not live to see the project come to fruition. After her conversion Lady Herbert wrote a number of religious booklets aimed at attracting converts, one of which, <span class="italic">How I Came Home</span> (1894), told the story of her own conversion.<br>
<br>Lady Herbert died at Herbert House on Monday 30 October 1911 after a long illness. Her body lay in state at Herbert House until Friday 3 November, when a solemn requiem was celebrated at Westminster Cathedral, the absolution being pronounced by Archbishop Bourne. She was buried in the cemetery at St Joseph's College, Mill Hill, near the grave of Cardinal Vaughan. Her surviving children attended, despite the earlier difficulties. Lady Herbert had been known at Mill Hill as &#145;The Mother of the Mill&#146; because of her generosity: the epithet in life became her epitaph in death.<br>
