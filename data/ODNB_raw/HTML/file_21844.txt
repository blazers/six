<span class="headword">Penketh,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1487), <span class="occ">Augustinian friar and theologian</span>, describes himself in his theological notebook as of the Warrington convent in Lancashire, and evidently studied theology at Oxford before (probably immediately before) 1466; on the basis of his Oxford study he was granted leave to incept at Cambridge in the academic year 1466&#150;7, and took the degree of DTh on 31 May 1468. He must have already had some repute within his order, since he was confirmed as prior provincial of England on 22 October 1469; but he evidently returned to Oxford, where he was permitted by his order to study and teach, until in 1474 he vacated the provincialship to study at Padua. He was appointed lector in metaphysics in the university there, almost certainly being the Master Thomas Anglicus confirmed in that post on 22 September 1475, and very probably holding it already in 1474, when he published in Venice his edition of the quodlibetal questions of John Duns Scotus. By 1477, when he brought out an edition of Scotus's commentary on the <span class="italic">Sentences</span> of Peter Lombard, he was holding the post of lector in theology, which he still held in 1479 according to his confr&egrave;re, Brother Iacopo Filippo da Bergamo. He was re-elected prior provincial in 1480 (confirmed 15 March 1481) and again on 1 April 1485, presumably until death. At Easter 1484 he preached a sermon in praise of Richard III, which, according to Sir Thomas More, was afterwards excoriated, but which brought him an annual pension of &pound;10 from the king. He died in London on 20 May 1487.<br>
<br>Penketh's principal achievement was to be the first to publish scholarly but usable printed editions of the chief works of Duns Scotus and the Scotist theologian Antonius Andreae. His editorial work was crowded into the five or six years he spent at Padua, where he could be in touch with experienced printers; but it originated in the Scotist teaching of the Oxford and Cambridge theological faculties, as a surviving notebook in his hand shows  (Oxford, Corpus Christi College, MS 126). It contains questions on universals by Brother William Russell, probably the Augustinian friar who incepted at Oxford in 1430, some unattributed questions on God and creatures, possibly Penketh's own, and a text of the commentary of Antonius Andreae on Aristotle's <span class="italic">Metaphysics</span> which he edited at Padua. All these texts are explicitly Scotist, one of the unascribed questions citing Scotus as <i>doctor noster subtilis</i>; together, they provide evidence of the theology taught at the Oxford Augustinian house from the 1430s to the 1470s, and of the Scotist learning that lay behind Penketh's editions of Scotus and Antonius Andreae. The editions ascribed to him are Scotus's <span class="italic">Quaestiones quodlibetales</span>, printed by Albert de Stendal (Padua, 1474), with the text emended by Penketh, and printed again from Penketh's text for Johann of Cologne (Venice, 1477) and reissued both in Nuremberg and in Venice in 1481; Scotus's <span class="italic">Quaestiones super secundum librum sententiarum</span>, printed by Stendal and emended by Penketh (Padua, 1474); Antonius Andreae's <span class="italic">Quaestiones de tribus principiis rerum naturalium</span>, printed by Laurentius Canozius and emended by Penketh and Laurentius de Lendenaria (Padua, 1475); Scotus's <span class="italic">Quaestiones super libros sententiarum</span>, edited by Penketh with Bartolomeo Bellati and printed for Johann of Cologne and Nicholas Jenson (Venice, 1477, and reissued there in both folio and quarto editions in 1481); Antonius Andreae's <span class="italic">Quaestiones super &#145;Metaphysica&#146;</span>, printed for Nicholas Petri of Haarlem and emended by Penketh (Vicenza, 1477, and reissued in London for William Wilcock in 1480). These editions, especially of Scotus, circulated widely and for some time were the standard texts; they were made more useful by the inclusion of the early <i>additamenta</i> of Scotus's pupils which some editors omitted.<br>
<br>Bale also ascribed to Penketh <span class="italic">Annotationes super Augustinum &#145;De civitate Dei&#146;</span>, without incipit; and an <span class="italic">Ars sermocinandi</span> with an incipit which enables it to be identified with a tract surviving in Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 423, and elsewhere. But this tract is found incompletely in Oxford, University College, MS 36, in a hand too early for Penketh's authorship.<br>
