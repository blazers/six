<span class="headword">Napier,  David</span>  (1790&#150;1869), <span class="occ">shipbuilder and engineer</span>, was born at Dumbarton on 29 October 1790, the son of John Napier (<i>d</i>. July 1813), an engineer in Dumbarton, and his second wife, Ann McAlister. He was a cousin of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19769/', "Robert Napier (1791&#150;1876)")</script>, the celebrated shipbuilder, whose younger brother was <a name="cosubject_61922"></a><span class="headword">David Napier</span>  (1799&#150;1850)<span class="occ"></span>, the fifth son of James Napier, John's partner in the Dumbarton engineering business, and Jean Ewing, his wife. A third <a name="cosubject_61921"></a><span class="headword">David Napier</span>  (1788&#150;1873)<span class="occ"></span>, also a cousin, was the son of Robert Napier, blacksmith to the duke of Argyll at Inveraray. All three Davids, who are often confused and sometimes taken for the same person, were trained in the Dumbarton business, which was one of the largest engineering works on the Clyde at the time, and engaged throughout their early years in boring cannon cast by the Clyde Iron Works for the war with revolutionary France. While they remained in the west of Scotland all three continued to work in one of the family's various engineering and iron-working enterprises.<br>
<br>The least successful was the youngest of the three. He became a partner in Napier Bros., which took over the Camlachie works from Robert in the 1830s, and in 1837 he purchased the Parkhead forge from the Reoch brothers for &pound;2800. He almost certainly made this investment to secure a steady supply of forgings to the family's engineering businesses. He appointed William Rigby, the future son-in-law of the shipbuilder Robert Napier, as works manager. By 1847 his enterprises were in difficulties and he became bankrupt, &#145;being unable by reason of misfortune of business to meet any of my engagements&#146;  (Titles of Parkhead Forge, Glasgow, Biggart Bailie, and Gifford, solicitors). He married Helen, sister of the oldest David Napier, and died at Glasgow in 1850.<br>
<br>The eldest cousin David Napier, born in 1788, a gifted and original mechanical engineer, left Glasgow for London about 1810. After working briefly for Henry Maudslay he became in 1815 foreman of an engineering shop in Nevil's Court, Fetter Lane, where he specialized in printing machinery. He devoted his spare time to designing new instruments. His first inventions were a folding pocket compass and the Universal Perspective Graph for copying maps and plans. Neither was successful. In 1818 he went into partnership with Francis Baisler, a London stationer, and opened a machine shop in Lloyd's Court, St Giles, repairing and later building printing machines, winning orders from the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> and a number of provincial newspapers. He developed a variety of improvements, most of which were over-elaborate and difficult to operate. Baisler left the partnership in 1822 and Napier continued in business on his own account. In 1825 T. C. Hansard, the parliamentary printer, commissioned him to make a cylindrical press of novel design named the &#145;Nay-peer&#146;. Sales were slow and did not improve even when steam drive was added in 1832. When Robert Napier visited London in 1827 to promote his marine engines he stayed with David. In 1831 David joined with two of Robert's sons, James and William, in improving a steam carriage designed by David Napier (1790&#150;1869) which had been tested near Dunoon. This second experiment also failed.<br>
<br>The eldest David Napier married Isabella Murdoch in 1820. The couple had seven children, the second of whom was James Murdoch Napier (father of Montague Stanley Napier), who joined the business in 1834. Two years later larger works were built in York Road, Lambeth, equipped with excellent machine tools. Father and son developed a bullet stamping machine in 1838 (patented in 1840), which was quickly ordered by Woolwich arsenal and later foreign governments. William Cotton, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, invented a machine for weighing and sorting gold coins in 1843 and invited Napier to manufacture them. Thereafter Napier developed a range of other equipment for minting and sorting coins. During the 1840s he also constructed several large hydraulic presses and lifts for Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Great Western Railway. His last invention, in 1848 in collaboration with his cousin Robert, was a registering compass to trace the course and distance covered; these were installed in vessels for the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company and P. &amp; O. as well as those built at his cousin's Govan yard. James Murdoch Napier became a partner in 1847, when the firm became known as David Napier &amp; Son. David moved to Surbiton in 1866; he died at 68 York Road, Lambeth, London, on 17 June 1873.<br>
<br>The David Napier who is the subject of this article was one of the most inventive of the pioneering Clyde engineers. After working in his father's engine shop, which moved to Glasgow in 1802, he was apprenticed to Duncan McArthur at his Greenhead foundry at Camlachie near Glasgow and in the early 1810s became his partner. At Greenhead he familiarized himself with building land engines and in 1812 made the boiler and produced the castings for the engines for the first steamboat, the <i>Comet</i>. Recognizing the potential of steam navigation, he decided to start his own engine works at Camlachie in partnership with his father, who died in July 1813 before it opened. In 1814 he married Marion Smith; they had fifteen children. While construction of his works was in progress, he continued to work at Greenhead designing the engines for the <i>Britannia</i> and <i>Dumbarton Castle</i> in 1815. Backed by his family's reputation for engineering on the Clyde, his new works (completed early in 1815) were an immediate success. His first marine engine, for the <i>Marion</i>, was delivered in 1816 and the following year he began operating her on his own account on Loch Lomond. In 1818 he was contemplating starting his own fleet of ocean-going steamers. After conducting the first experiments using a model and observations of a steamer in heavy seas to achieve an optimum hull design, he built the <i>Rob Roy</i> to provide services between Greenock and Liverpool, and Holyhead and Howth. Napier was accompanied on her maiden voyage by Charles McIntosh, the inventor of rubberized waterproof clothing, who, when they encountered a storm in the Irish Sea, was convinced they would be drowned. McIntosh was proved wrong, and Napier went on to establish a regular service between Holyhead and Howth with three ships each more powerful than the last. In 1820 he began a parallel service to his Loch Lomond steamers down Loch Eck with a steam carriage connection to the Holy Loch, where he built a hotel and holiday villas. Although technically viable, the steam carriage was too heavy and sank into the road.<br>
<br>Napier leased his Camlachie works to his cousin Robert in 1821 and built a new works at Lancefield, conveniently situated on the banks of the Clyde with its own wet dock. His managers were David Tod and John Macgregor, who later pioneered iron shipbuilding on the Clyde. At Lancefield, Napier introduced a raft of innovations in the design of both marine engines and propelling machinery, including improved surface condensers, feathering paddles, and twin screws. In 1826 he engined the <i>United Kingdom</i>, built for the service between Leith and London, in which he was also an investor, and the following year commissioned the <i>Aglaia</i>, the first iron steamship to be built on the Clyde for his Loch Eck service. Writing in 1841 John Scott Russell commented: &#145;We believe that from the year 1818 until about 1830 David Napier effected more for the improvement of steam navigation than any other man&hellip;. It is to Mr David Napier that Great Britain owes the establishment of deep-sea communication by steam vessels and of Post Office Steam Packets&#146;  (Napier, 31). However, his reputation was dealt a cruel blow on 28 July 1835 when the boiler of his steamer <i>Earl Grey</i> exploded at the quayside at Greenock, killing six people and injuring several more.<br>
<br>Deeply distressed by the incident Napier in 1836 decided to leave Glasgow and join his elder cousin David in London, both to exploit the potential of investing in shipping in the Thames and the south coast and to begin iron shipbuilding. He leased his Lancefield works to his cousin Robert and at the end of 1837 he purchased an open site on the Isle of Dogs, alongside William Fairbairn's yard. This new enterprise was managed by his sons John and Francis and later a third son, Robert Dehane, leaving their father time to concentrate on innovative designs and to investigate the market. Their first experimental iron steamer, the <i>Eclipse</i>, was launched in 1839 for service between Blackwall and Margate. The firm constructed a succession of vessels, some incorporating novel features, notably a rotary engine, developed by David Napier. The yard closed in 1852 as it was no longer possible to compete on price with the Clyde. After spending some time in Australia the three brothers returned to Glasgow to establish the engineering firm of Napier Bros. Their father remained in London, continuing his experiments until his death at home, 8 Upper Phillimore Gardens, Kensington, on 23 November 1869.<br>
<br>That three cousins of the same name should have made such a contribution to engineering in the first half of the nineteenth century is testimony to the Napier family's long tradition of excellent craftsmanship in metal in the west of Scotland. There were many other families with trade or craft pedigrees as long, but none with so many distinguished members as the Napiers.<br>
