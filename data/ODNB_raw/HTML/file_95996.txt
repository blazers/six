<span class="headword">Tomlinson,  John Race Godfrey</span>  (1932&#150;2005), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born at the nursing home, Sandiway Road, Ashton upon Mersey, Cheshire, on 24 April 1932, the only son and eldest of five children of John Angell Tomlinson, a man of independent means, and his wife, Beatrice Elizabeth Race, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Godfrey. The family lived at 120 Urmston Lane, Stretford, a town then famous for growing rhubarb. He attended Moss Park primary school and Stretford Boys' Grammar School. From his childhood he loved history, which he studied at Manchester University. There he was influenced by Sir Lewis Namier, who was to become a close friend and who inspired Tomlinson to enrol on a graduate course at the Institute of Historical Research, London University, where he worked on the history of parliament. His collection of the Grenville papers was published in 1962. On 27 March 1954, while still a student, he married Audrey Maria Barrett (<i>b</i>. 1933), whom he had first met at a ballroom dancing class in 1947. They had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Tomlinson was commissioned in the RAF in 1955 and took charge of education at a fighter squadron station. The experience of these three years undoubtedly influenced his decision to devote his career to education. After his national service he taught history for two years at Longton high school, simultaneously working as an evening lecturer for the Workers' Educational Association. But his ambition drew him towards a career in educational administration. In 1960 he became administrative assistant with responsibility for further education in Shropshire county council. During this time the family lived in Bayston Hill, near Shrewsbury. Having served three years in a rural county, he then successfully applied for the post of assistant education officer in Lancashire. There he gained valuable experience of urban education and was responsible for implementing comprehensive schooling&#151;a move he welcomed, appreciating the enhanced opportunity it provided for all pupils. During this time the family lived in New Longton, just outside Preston. Four years later he was appointed deputy director of education for Cheshire. His new responsibilities included teacher supply and teacher training. The family took up residence at Bromborough, a small historic town which was then part of Cheshire.<br>
<br>In 1972, at a remarkably young age, Tomlinson was appointed director of education for Cheshire. Such was his standing with the county council that he was appointed following unanimous acclamation by the education committee. Over the next twelve years he established himself as one of the most outstanding of his generation of education administrators (he served as president of the Society of Education Officers in 1982). He was also involved with national activities such as the Committee on Child Health Services, chaired by Donald Court; he contributed to the Gulbenkian enquiries into drama, dance, and music, and chaired the Schools Council (1978&#150;81), a body supported by the teachers' trades unions but increasingly distrusted by the Conservative government.<br>
<br>Even before the passing of the 1988 <span class="roman">Education Reform Act</span> Tomlinson perceived that local government was likely to lose its ability to plan and manage all aspects of schooling. He opted for a change of occupation and a return to the realm of scholarship. His application for a chair at Warwick, with no background in university teaching and no research record since his study of the history of parliament, was unusual. It is a tribute both to his reputation and to the perspicacity of the appointment panel that his potential value to the university was recognized. He was duly appointed professor of education and director of the Warwick Institute of Education. The family set up home in the village of Allesley, near Coventry, in 1985. In making this move Tomlinson hoped to free up his time for thinking and writing, but government changes in the training of teachers stymied this. The new developments ensured that his deft skills and extensive experience of reorganizing posts were put to good use.<br>
<br>Outside the university Tomlinson enjoyed many education-related activities. He was a governor of both the Chetham's and the Menuhin music schools. He chaired the inner London education authority's inquiry into freedom of information and produced an excellent report in 1987, but to no avail as the authority was closed down by the Thatcher government. He later chaired a three-year inquiry into disability and learning difficulties in further education that culminated in the report <span class="italic">Inclusive Learning</span> (1996). He also played a vital role in the Royal Society of Arts, being in turn a member of council, vice-president, and from 1989 to 1991 chairman of council. In all these different ways, he demonstrated his eagerness to serve the public good.<br>
<br>Leaving Warwick as an emeritus professor in 1996, Tomlinson accepted a part-time post as academic secretary of the University Council for the Education of Teachers, a body that co-ordinated university-based teacher education. From 1997 to 2000 he played a crucial role in delicate negotiations over teacher training. After his retirement he was appointed vice-chairman of the General Teaching Council, which he had persuaded David Blunkett to establish in 2000. He also chaired the National Forum for Learners with Learning Difficulties and Disabilities (2001&#150;5). He received many honours: a clutch of honorary degrees and fellowships, a CBE in 1983, and in 1989 freedom of the City of London followed by appointment as a liveryman of the Goldsmiths' Company. These honours recognized not just his capacity for hard work but his integrity and regard for others, especially for those with any kind of disability.<br>
<br>Tomlinson was a complex man: a confirmed member of the Church of England yet a free thinker; a leader, whom people wanted to follow; a skilled teacher and a persevering learner; a member of the Athenaeum yet (perhaps influenced by his four sisters) a champion of women's rights; devoted to his wife and family yet utterly committed to public service. He died of prostate cancer in Walsgrave Hospital, Coventry, on 6 August 2005. He was cremated on 17 August. He was survived by his wife, Audrey, and their four children.<br>
