<span class="headword">Crowder,  John</span>  (1756&#150;1830), <span class="occ">printer and mayor of London</span>, was born in Wyradsbury, Buckinghamshire, the son of John Crowder (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1720), a playing-card maker, and his wife, Frances (later Frances Scriven). Like his paternal grandfather of the same name, John Crowder was brought up in the book trades and, after moving to London, found early employment in his majesty's printing office under William Strahan. About 1780 he obtained a position with Francis Blyth, printer and part proprietor of the <span class="italic">Public Ledger</span>, a daily morning newspaper, and the <span class="italic">London Packet</span>, an evening paper published three times a week. In the year leading up to Blyth's death in 1788, Crowder took control of the <span class="italic">Public Ledger</span> and was trading from Blyth's premises at 2 Queen's Head Alley, Paternoster Row. Following Blyth's death on 27 May 1788 Crowder also became proprietor of the <span class="italic">London Packet</span>. He managed the publication of both newspapers &#145;with the greatest impartiality, diligence and integrity&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 100/2, 1830, 568) until 1822, when they were taken over by T. Richards. In the same year that Crowder gained ownership of the <span class="italic">London Packet</span> he married Blyth's niece, Mary Annabella James (<i>d</i>. 1823), on 2 February at St Mary Aldermanbury, and was admitted to the freedom of the City of London by patrimony through the Playing-Card Makers' Company in July. Within two years he had moved his printing business to 12 Warwick Court, where, on 2 February 1790, Robert Crakelt was bound to him as an apprentice printer. While still maintaining publication of the <span class="italic">Public Ledger</span> and the <span class="italic">London Packet</span>, Crowder also published the <span class="italic">Mirror of the Times</span> between 1799 and 1803, was &#145;frequently employed in printing valuable works for the booksellers, by whom he was equally esteemed for punctuality, intelligence, and accuracy&#146;  (ibid., 568), and in 1802 was trading in partnership with another printer, E. Hemsted.<br>
<br>After amassing a considerable fortune through &#145;some successful speculations&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 100/2, 1830, 568) Crowder relinquished his printing business in 1820 in the pursuit of a full-time civic career. As a longstanding and well-respected resident in the ward of Farringdon Within, he was first elected in 1800 as a representative of that ward in common council, and between 1814 and 1823 he served as one of two deputies. Although his wife died on 6 November 1823, Crowder maintained &#145;an assiduity and energy which more and more endeared him to his constituents&#146;  (ibid., 569) and was accordingly elected alderman of his ward on 24 April 1823 and sworn a week later. In that same year he joined the Stationers' Company by translation, sponsored by John Nichols, and was selected for the Stationers' Company court within a few months of being admitted to the livery; he served as under warden in 1827, as upper warden in 1828, and as master of the company in 1829. Between 1825 and 1826 Crowder was sheriff of London, and on 9 November 1829 he began his term as lord mayor, during which time he reputedly gave approximately &pound;1000 for charitable purposes. He was known for his &#145;industry and integrity&#146; in both public and private life, and he possessed a &#145;spirit, vivacity, and intelligence which rendered him an agreeable companion&#146;  (ibid., 570). Within months of entering his mayoralty, however, ill health forced him temporarily to abandon his civic responsibilities, and in September 1830 an asthmatic affection was aggravated by a severe cold and failure of digestion. This eventually forced him to withdraw completely from public life on 9 November 1830&#151;exactly one year after commencing as lord mayor. Crowder died at his residence at Sudbury House, King Street, Hammersmith, in the early hours of the morning on 2 December 1830 and was buried eleven days later in the same vault as his wife at Christ Church Greyfriars.<br>
