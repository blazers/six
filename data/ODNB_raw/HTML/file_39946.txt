<span class="headword">Pressburger,  Emeric <span class="st"> [Imre Josef]</span></span>  (1902&#150;1988), <span class="occ">author and screenwriter</span>, was born Imre Josef Pressburger at 3 St Peter's Street, Miskolc, Hungary, on 5 December 1902, the only son (he had one elder half-sister from his father's previous marriage) of K&aacute;lm&aacute;n Pressburger, estate manager, and his second wife, K&auml;therina Wichs. The family were Jewish. Pressburger attended a boarding-school in Temesv&aacute;r, where he was a good student, excelling at maths, literature, and music. He then studied mathematics and engineering at the universities of Prague and Stuttgart before his father's death forced him to abandon his studies.<br>
<br>Pressburger moved to Berlin in 1926 to work as a journalist and writer of short stories and film scripts. Universum Film, the major European film studio, employed him as a contract writer, and his first screen credit was for <span class="italic">Abschied</span> (1930), co-written with the novelist Erich K&auml;stner and directed by Robert Siodmak. The film was a drama-documentary shot in &#145;real time&#146;, representing one and a quarter hours in the lives of people living in a Berlin boarding-house. Although not a great success, it ensured Pressburger's continued employment by Universum Film in their script department at a time when film jobs were scarce. Pressburger was not listed on the credits for a screen adaptation of K&auml;stner's <span class="italic">Emil and the Detectives</span> (1931), which was signed by Billy Wilder. A key experience at Universum Film was working on musical comedy adaptations of operettas, thereby beginning a fascination with the links between music and film which continued all his life. When Universum Film did not renew Pressburger's contract for 1933, and in a context of escalating antisemitism in Germany (where he changed his forename to Emmerich), he decided to settle in France, beginning again in another country as an &eacute;migr&eacute; writer. Although Pressburger managed to obtain film work, life was difficult; he was threatened with deportation and faced imprisonment for debt. Intermittent film employment prevented this, and one script, <span class="italic">Monsieur Sans-G&ecirc;ne</span> (1934), directed by Karl Anton, was a major success in France. It was remade in Hollywood by Jesse L. Lasky and released as <span class="italic">One Rainy Afternoon</span> (1936).<br>
<br>Pressburger entered Britain in 1935, on a stateless passport. One of his screenplays, <span class="italic">La vie parisienne</span> (1935), an adaptation of an operetta by Jacques Offenbach, had been filmed in English and French versions, and Pressburger had travelled to Britain to work on the English version with Arthur Wimperis, an associate of Alexander Korda, of London Film Productions, one of the largest British film companies. Pressburger was eventually to work for his fellow Hungarian. He decided to settle in Britain, and changed his name in 1938 to Emeric. On 24 June that year he married Agnes (<i>b</i>. 1917/18), daughter of Andol Donath, a general merchant. The marriage was dissolved in 1941.<br>
<br>Pressburger's first British assignment for Korda was <span class="italic">The Challenge</span> (1938), a film about a race to reach the summit of the Matterhorn. In 1938 he met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39945/', "Michael Powell")</script>, his director and collaborator for the next eighteen years. Their first joint project was <span class="italic">The Spy in Black</span> (1939), a First World War espionage thriller based on a novel by Storer Clouston. Filmed at Denham Studios, it starred Conrad Veidt and Valerie Hobson. Powell was hired to direct the film as a replacement for Brian Desmond Hurst, and Korda invited Pressburger to work on the script. After this successful collaboration their next joint venture was <span class="italic">Contraband</span> (1940), another vehicle for the popular stars Veidt and Hobson. From then onwards Pressburger's most successful work was with Powell. In 1943 they formed a production company, the Archers, which became known for its distinctive film trademark of a red, white, and blue archery target with eight arrows, a ninth one thrusting into it. Their partnership was egalitarian; both men shared the financial rewards and creative responsibility for all the films, the credits stating that they were &#145;written, produced and directed&#146; by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.<br>
<br>Pressburger's screenplays provided excellent scope for Powell's distinctive visual style, which employed colour in an imaginative way and used fantasy and spectacle, complex and challenging narrative structures, and flamboyant visual and camera devices. Several films were produced under the aegis of the Ministry of Information, a connection which prevented Pressburger from being deported as a foreigner. The most notable films produced by Powell and Pressburger during The Second World War were <span class="italic">Forty Ninth Parallel</span> (1941), <span class="italic">One of our Aircraft is Missing</span> (1941), <span class="italic">The Silver Fleet</span> (1943), <span class="italic">The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp</span> (1943), based on the cartoon character created by David Low, <span class="italic">A Canterbury Tale</span> (1944), and <span class="italic">I Know Where I'm Going!</span> (1945). In many respects Pressburger was patriotic, an Anglophile who celebrated the freedom he had found in his adopted country. His ability to see Britain from the point of view of a fascinated outsider suited the films' quizzical perspective on British society and history.<br>
<br>A recurrent theme in Pressburger's writing was a journey by a leading character into unknown territory. Now regarded as a classic in a mystical tradition, <span class="italic">A Canterbury Tale</span> was misunderstood at the time of release, a misunderstanding that helped initiate the Archers Company reputation as film-makers who were ahead of their time, and whose work was characterized by wit, fantasy, ambition, and originality. The film celebrated British heritage and freedom, two themes that were extremely important to Pressburger. <span class="italic">I Know Where I'm Going!</span> shared a similar fascination with self-discovery and mysticism, charting the journey of a young woman from Manchester to Scotland, where she discovers that the path in life she believed she was destined to follow has been mistaken. The screenplay for <span class="italic">The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp</span>, Pressburger's favourite Archers film, proved to be controversial. Its portrayal of the British officer class as anachronistic led to accusations that the film was pro-German. The film's release was delayed in the United States, where it was cut and advertised inappropriately. During the war Pressburger's involvement with the Screenwriters' Association and the Association of Cine Technicians became more active. He mixed with other left-wing &eacute;migr&eacute;s and in 1942 was involved with the Free German League of Culture, a group which organized a rally, the Pageant of Four Freedoms, at the New Theatre, Oxford.<br>
<br>Pressburger (who was naturalized in 1946) married again on 29 March 1947. His second wife was Gwynneth May (Wendy) Zillah (<i>b</i>. 1911/12), former wife of Abraham Jacob Greenbaum, and daughter of Edward Regnald Orme, army officer. They had two daughters, one of whom died as a baby in 1948. The marriage was dissolved at Reno, Nevada, in 1953, and in Britain in 1971.<br>
<br>In 1946 <span class="italic">A Matter of Life and Death</span> became the film chosen for Britain's first charity royal film performance. Although it was originally conceived as a wartime propaganda film, its production was delayed because Technicolor was not available. Starring David Niven as an RAF pilot on the borderline between life and death, the film is an imaginative meditation on love, grief, and war. Pressburger's ability to deal with broad, challenging themes was further demonstrated when he explored a clash of communities and values in <span class="italic">Black Narcissus</span> (1946), about a group of nuns in the Himalayas living in an atmosphere of hysteria and repressed sexuality. Perhaps the most daring experiment was <span class="italic">The Red Shoes</span> (1948, based on a Hans Christian Andersen story), set in the tempestuous and exacting world of a ballet company. This film in particular showed how Powell's sense of colour could be assisted by Pressburger's ambitious screenplay. Pressburger first started working on the screenplay for <span class="italic">The Red Shoes</span> in 1939 but the project was disrupted by the war. In 1946 the Archers bought the rights from Korda for the project and began a productive collaboration with art director Alfred Junge and Robert Helpmann, a dancer at Sadler's Wells. Most of Pressburger's subsequent screenplays were also not based on original material. <span class="italic">The Red Shoes</span> was followed by adaptations of challenging material for <span class="italic">The Tales of Hoffman</span> (1953, adapted from a Jacques Offenbach opera at the suggestion of Sir Thomas Beecham) and <span class="italic">Oh Rosalinda!</span> (1955, based on Johann Strauss's operetta <span class="italic">Die Fledermaus</span>). These films separated the Archers from the conventional canon of British film production, often to their cost, for puzzled critics were inclined to dismiss their work as pretentious, extravagant, and confusing. In 1952 Pressburger directed for the only time, but the film, <span class="italic">Twice upon a Time</span>, was generally regarded as a disastrous project. On the other hand, <span class="italic">The Battle of the River Plate</span> (1956), directed by Powell, was chosen for the royal film performance in 1956. After their last Archer collaboration, <span class="italic">Ill Met by Moonlight</span> (1956), a wartime drama, Powell and Pressburger parted. Their work was beginning to lose its experimental edge and the two agreed to separate as their interests began to diverge.<br>
<br>Pressburger then wrote and produced <span class="italic">Miracle in Soho</span> (1957) and published his first novel, <span class="italic">Killing a Mouse on Sunday</span> (1961), a story about a terrorist set in the Spanish Civil War, on which Fred Zinnemann based his film <span class="italic">Behold a Pale Horse</span> (1964). The novel's controversial subject matter led to Pressburger being banned from entering Franco's Spain. Pressburger's critical success with <span class="italic">Killing a Mouse on Sunday</span> was not repeated with his second novel, <span class="italic">The Glass Pearls</span> (1966), a more personal book about Nazi Germany. He continued writing, but could not find a publisher for a subsequent novel, &#145;The Unholy Passion&#146;. Many of his projects in the 1960s were never completed. Pressburger accompanied David Lean to India to conduct research for a screenplay about the life of Gandhi, but Lean rejected the script he eventually produced. He worked again with Powell in 1966 on <span class="italic">They're a Weird Mob</span> (1966), shot in Australia, and again in 1972, when they collaborated on a film for the Children's Film Foundation, <span class="italic">The Boy who Turned Yellow</span>, and on a novel of <span class="italic">The Red Shoes</span> (1978). None of these projects revived their former ingenuity. Pressburger more or less retired after this, but enjoyed the critical appreciation of his work encouraged by Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola. Key events in the reappraisal of the Archers' work were a retrospective of their work at the National Film Theatre in 1971, and the showing of a restored print of <span class="italic">The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp</span> at the National Film Theatre in 1978. A documentary on Powell and Pressburger was shown on BBC2 television in 1981.<br>
<br>Powell was always keen to stress that his skill as a director was stretched to the best advantage when Pressburger had written the screenplay. Their general method was for Pressburger to write the story and devise the structure, and then he would collaborate with Powell on scripting the dialogue. Pressburger was involved in all stages of a production, a process that engendered creativity out of conflict. As Pressburger commented, &#145;Our films were born out of disagreement&#146;  (Macdonald, xvii). Powell described Pressburger's talent for storytelling as that of &#145;a screenwriter with the heart and mind of a novelist. He was a born dramatist and writer, and he didn't learn as much from me as I did from him&#146;  (ibid., 155). Nevertheless, Pressburger often felt that Powell put himself at the centre of events organized to reappraise their work. However, their earlier collaborations were marked by a mutual sense of trust and a shared desire to explore the boundaries of word and image. Pressburger commented on how they inspired each other's work: &#145;He knows what I am going to say even before I say it&#151;maybe even before I have thought it&#151;and that is very rare&#146;  (ibid., 156). Pressburger was a diffident and private person, who at times, particularly later on in his life, could be hypersensitive and prone to bouts of melancholia. This was in contrast to Powell, who was more of a self-publicist. A keen gastronome, Pressburger loved French food, enjoyed music, and possessed a great sense of humour. In appearance he was short, wore glasses, and had a sagacious, bird-like facial expression. He was a keen supporter of Arsenal football team, a passion he developed soon after arriving in Britain.<br>
<br>Pressburger received the British Film Institute special award (with Powell) in 1978 and fellowships from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 1981 and the British Film Institute in 1983. He won an Oscar in 1942 for best original story, for <span class="italic">Forty Ninth Parallel</span>. He died of bronchial pneumonia on 5 February 1988 in the Foxearth Lodge Nursing Home, Little Green, Saxtead, Woodbridge, Suffolk.<br>
