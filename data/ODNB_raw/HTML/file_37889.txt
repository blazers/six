<span class="headword">Rendel,  Stuart</span>, Baron Rendel  (1834&#150;1913), <span class="occ">industrialist, politician, and philanthropist</span>, was born in Plymouth on 2 July 1834, the fourth son in the family of four sons and three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23364/', "James Meadows Rendel (1799&#150;1856)")</script>, civil engineer, and his wife, Catherine Jane, daughter of James Harris of Plymouth. Two of his brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35726/', "George W. Rendel")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35725/', "Alexander Rendel")</script>. He was educated at Eton College and at Oriel College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1856 with a fourth-class degree in classical studies.<br>
<br>He married in 1857 Ellen Sophy, daughter of William Egerton Hubbard of Horsham, Sussex, brother of J. G. Hubbard (later first Baron Addington). In 1861 he was called to the bar (Inner Temple), but before long, through his father's association with the inventor and arms manufacturer W. G. Armstrong, became the London manager of Armstrong's engineering firm, a post which involved business relations with foreign governments. At the time of his death he was vice-chairman of the company.<br>
<br>In 1880 Rendel was elected Liberal MP for Montgomeryshire, and he held the seat for the next fourteen years. His victory there was remarkable, because he had no Welsh connections, and the seat had long been monopolized by the powerful local family of Wynn, a member of which he defeated. He spent &pound;12,000 on the election (to his opponent's &pound;20,000), and thereafter devoted, on his own admission, 20 per cent of his annual expenditure to politics. He soon became known as &#145;the member for Wales&#146;, and was accepted as leader of the Welsh Liberal group in parliament. Under his guidance it began to act coherently, with the result that the Liberal leadership was compelled to pay more attention to Welsh causes.<br>
<br>This process was assisted by Rendel's close friendship with W. E. Gladstone, which became closer still when one of his four daughters, Maude Ernestine, married one of Gladstone's sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38809/', "Henry Neville Gladstone")</script>. Sharing Gladstone's Anglican high-churchmanship, he was well qualified for the difficult task of reconciling him to the policy of Welsh disestablishment. A leading opponent of disestablishment, Bishop A. G. Edwards of St Asaph, later wrote of Rendel that he &#145;read the Welsh character in its strength and weakness&#146;, and so achieved unity and discipline within the Welsh party.<br>
<br>Rendel gave much encouragement to the rising generation of authentically Welsh politicians, among whom T. E. Ellis and, above all, David Lloyd George were outstanding. Lloyd George thought very highly of him and used to quote with approval his dictum that in politics &#145;there are no friendships at the top&#146; (too often attributed to Lloyd George himself). In addition, Rendel took a special interest in Welsh education and culture. He deserves most of the credit for the <span class="roman">Welsh Intermediate Education Act</span> of 1889; and from 1895 to the end of his life he was president of the University College at Aberystwyth, to which he regularly contributed &pound;1000 a year. In 1898 he presented the fine site overlooking Aberystwyth on which the National Library of Wales was built.<br>
<br>In Gladstone's later years, Rendel frequently, together with George Armitstead, acted as host, confidant, and companion, regularly playing backgammon with Gladstone in the evening. On Gladstone's resignation in 1894 Rendel was created Baron Rendel of Hatchlands in Byfleet, Surrey. Hatchlands was his English estate, but he also had villas in Italy and the south of France, and in London a succession of grand houses, at the last of which, 10 Palace Green, Kensington Palace Gardens, he died on 4 June 1913, his wife having died in 1912. The peerage became extinct.<br>
<br>Rendel was a shy man, but confident in his views and, to those who knew him well, a shrewd, witty, and charming companion. Had he been more self-assertive he might have risen higher in politics, but in his chosen field he made good use of his wealth and talents.<br>
