<span class="headword">Houghton, Sir  William Frederick</span>  (1909&#150;1971), <span class="occ">educational administrator</span>, was born on 30 November 1909 at 27 Rutland Street, Oldham, Lancashire, son of Arthur Houghton, travelling salesman for a vinegar manufacturer, and his wife, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cocker. It is not recorded where he attended school. In 1928 he matriculated at Christ's College, Cambridge, where he gained a second class in part one (1930) and a first class in part two (1931) of the historical tripos.<br>
<br>After graduating in 1931 Houghton spent four years (1932&#150;6) as a schoolmaster, first at Methodist college, Belfast, and then at Wirral grammar school, Cheshire. Just before he left teaching, his fictional work <span class="italic">Greeks and Romans</span> (1935) was published. He married on 31 December 1935, at the Baptist chapel in King Street, Oldham, Mary Wimpenny Newton (<i>b</i>. 1909), daughter of Frederick Schofield Newton, an Oldham waste dealer.<br>
<br>In 1936 the newly married couple moved to east Suffolk where Houghton had been appointed as assistant secretary to the education committee. He took to educational administration and made rapid progress. A post as deputy director of education in west Sussex followed in 1938 and from 1941 to 1947 he was chief education officer in Darlington. Two deputy education officer posts in larger local education authorities came next: the first in Birmingham from 1947 to 1952 and the second with London county council (LCC) from 1952 to 1956.<br>
<br>With senior experience in five different local education authorities, Houghton was an obvious candidate for promotion to the most influential and prestigious educational administration post in Britain: the position of LCC education officer, to which he was appointed when it became vacant in 1956. Father of two sons, of whom one predeceased his father and the other became a teacher, he made his home in London and remained at the helm of its education for the rest of his life. Only Sir Robert Blair, who led education in London from 1904 to 1924, served longer. When the LCC was abolished in 1965, to be replaced by the inner London education authority (ILEA), Houghton became ILEA's first education officer and oversaw the smooth transition from one system to the other.<br>
<br>Houghton was renowned in ILEA for his approachability and practical &#145;northern&#146; common sense. He made tireless visits to schools, irrespective of other commitments, during which he invariably took time and trouble to talk to pupils and teachers informally. Another strength was his ability to see things from a teacher's point of view. Under him a new education welfare service was set up in London. He also led the imaginative establishment in the ILEA area of a network of local teachers' centres at which teachers from different schools could meet and undergo in-service training. The acquisition and development of a residential in-service training centre at Stoke D'Abernon, near Leatherhead, in Surrey, was another innovation which took place under Houghton's leadership. He served on a number of national and international bodies and, early in 1971, led an ILEA team which went to Hong Kong to advise on the colony's education service.<br>
<br>Beyond education Houghton pursued interests in reading, theatre, sport, and travel. He became an honorary fellow of the College of Preceptors in 1965 and was granted an honorary doctorate by the University of Surrey in 1968. In 1967 he was knighted for services to education. He suffered a stroke after attending a meeting of the Home Office committee on adopted children and died from a &#145;cerebro-vascular accident&#146; at Whittington Hospital, Islington, London, on 16 November 1971. He had planned to take early retirement at the end of 1971.<br>
