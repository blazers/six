<span class="headword">Leinster,  saints of</span>  (<em>act. </em><em>c.</em>550&#150;<em>c.</em>800)<span class="occ"></span>, were holy men whose cults are located in south-eastern Ireland. &#145;Leinster&#146; here stands as the early medieval counterpart to the modern counties of Carlow, Dublin, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Wexford, and Wicklow. Although all or most of counties Meath, Westmeath, Longford, Offaly, and Louth were at times considered part of Leinster, their saints are covered separately in this work [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51010/', "Meath, saints of")</script>].<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_5801"></a><span class="headword">C&oacute;emgen <span class="st"> [Kevin]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em>7th cent.)<span class="occ"></span>, whose feast day is 3 June, is recorded as the founder of Glenn-da-locha (Glendalough, co. Wicklow). His death is recorded in the annals of Ulster under the year 618, but the entry is an addition made by Cathal Mac Maghnusa, for whom these annals were written in the late fifteenth century. It is recorded again at 622 &#145;according to others&#146;. In the <span class="italic">Chronicum Scotorum</span> and the annals of Tigernach he is said to have been the biblical age of 120 years at this death. There is, therefore, no certainty of the date of his death. In the ninth-century Stowe missal he is counted among the priests, but because of his ascetic reputation, he was twinned with Paul the Hermit. The uncertain pedigrees of the saint trace his ancestry to the D&aacute;l Messin Corb, an early Leinster dynastic group that held sway in the fifth and sixth centuries.<br>
<br>The earliest biographical material for C&oacute;emgen probably dates from some two centuries after the saint's lifetime. There are two extant lives in Latin and three in Irish, dating in their present form to between the twelfth and the seventeenth or eighteenth centuries. The latest in date is like a pilgrim's guide to Glendalough. The earliest life upon which some of this extant material was based may date to approximately 800. C&oacute;emgen is credited with the foundation of a number of churches in the counties of Wicklow, Dublin, and Kildare. His biographers bring him into contact with twenty ecclesiastical figures and in his genealogy his mother and sisters are the mothers of other saints. Much of this information arose as a means of expressing the relationship between his principal church of Glendalough and churches dependent upon it or in alliance with it. In 790 C&oacute;emgen's relics were taken on circuit along with those of Mochua of Clondalkin (a dependent church). Glendalough became the seat of a diocese, its most famous abbot being St Laurence O'Toole (Lorc&aacute;n Ua Tuathail).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_76745"></a><span class="headword">M&aacute;ed&oacute;c <span class="st"> [Aidan]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em>7th cent.)<span class="occ"></span>, whose feast day is 31 January, was the founder of the church of Ferns (co. Wexford) and patron of Drumlane (co. Cavan) and Rossinver (co. Leitrim). His name, Mo-&Aacute;ed-&oacute;c, means &#145;my little &Aacute;ed&#146;; he is also known as Aidan. According to tradition, he was born on the island crann&oacute;g of Inis Brechmaige in Templeport Lake (co. Cavan). His father, S&eacute;tna, was of the U&iacute; Moccu Uais (a branch of the Airgialla). His mother, Eithne, was of the U&iacute; Amalgaid (Tirawley, co. Mayo). After an education in Wales with St David he returned to Leinster where he established his principal foundation of Ferns. His death is recorded in the annals of Ulster as an addition to the year 625 by their fifteenth-century compiler Cathal Mac Maghnusa. <span class="italic">Chronicum Scotorum</span> and the annals of Tigernach have it noted at 625 and again at 656 and 659. The later date may refer to a similarly named saint, &Aacute;ed (feast day 11 April), whose church was Cluain M&oacute;r M&aacute;ed&oacute;c (Clonmore, co. Carlow). The latter was a member of the U&iacute; D&uacute;nlainge dynasty of north Leinster, from the valley of the River Tolka. It can be shown that there was a deliberate conflation of the two lives of these saints for political purposes in the eleventh century. From the late tenth century, the main segment of the U&iacute; Chennselaig dynasty based at Ferns was opposed by a rival branch based at Clonmore. In 1040 Diarmait mac M&aacute;el na mB&oacute;, the U&iacute; Chennselaig king who was soon to become ruler of the whole province, plundered Clonmore as part of a ruthless elimination of his rivals. It is likely that the life of M&aacute;ed&oacute;c was rewritten at the time of Conchobar Ua Laidhgne&aacute;in, abbot of Ferns and St Mullins (or Tech Moling: Timolin, co. Kildare), who died in 1062, in order to suppress the cult of &Aacute;ed. By introducing Brandub, a king of Leinster who supposedly died in 605, it also served to enhance the prestige of Brandub's descendant, Diarmait mac M&aacute;el na mB&oacute;. The same circumstances probably gave rise to the association of M&aacute;ed&oacute;c with Mo Ling, founder of St Mullins.<br>
<br>By the twelfth century, the centre of M&aacute;ed&oacute;c's cult had shifted from Leinster to Drumlane (co. Cavan, in the diocese of Kilmore). The lives of M&aacute;ed&oacute;c deriving from this area are written in Irish and provide important evidence for the relationship between the church and lay society in the U&iacute; Ruairc territory of Br&eacute;ifne. In the fifteenth century the centre of M&aacute;ed&oacute;c's cult moved again, for political reasons, to Rossinver in what is now co. Leitrim.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_9478"></a><span class="headword">Finten <span class="st"> [Fintan, Munnu]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em>7th cent.)<span class="occ"></span>, whose feast day is 21 October, was the founder of Tech Munnu (Taghmon, co. Wexford). His four extant lives, all depending on a common original, say that his father, Tailch&aacute;n, was of the Cen&eacute;l Conaill (a branch called the Cen&eacute;l mB&oacute;guine, south co. Donegal) and his mother, Fedelm, of the U&iacute; Maine, a people on the River Shannon in the midlands, part of which was absorbed by the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill. The historically most important part of the biographical information on Finten shows few anachronisms and reflects political relationships in the mid-eighth century among the Fothairt, the S&iacute;l M&aacute;eluidir, the S&iacute;l Cormaic, and the monastery of Taghmon.<br>
<br>An alternative origin for the saint is given by Adomn&aacute;n, who reports in his life of Columba that one of his informants was a disciple of Finten. Adomn&aacute;n says that Finten was the son of Tailch&aacute;n, of the people of &#145;moccu Moie&#146;. He says that Finten was devoted to studies of divine wisdom and wished to go to Iona on pilgrimage. While he was discussing the matter with a priest of his own people, Colum Crag, monks arrived announcing the death of Columba a few days earlier, on Sunday 9 June 597. Finten sailed to Iona and asked Columba's successor Baith&eacute;ne if he could be admitted as a monk. Baith&eacute;ne replied that Columba had prophetically revealed to him that Finten was destined to found his own monastery. He was sent back to construct his own religious house in south Leinster.<br>
<br>Much of Finten's hagiography is garbled, but appears to present him as an arch conservative in Irish religious practice. A letter from Cummian to Abbot S&eacute;g&eacute;ne of Iona written <i>c</i>.633 describes how a &#145;whited wall&#146; (Latin &#145;paries dealbatus&#146;) arose and argued for the old method of Easter dating, after it was thought that agreement had been reached on a new method at a synod held in 629 or 630 at Mag L&eacute;na, near Durrow. The &#145;whited wall&#146; seems to represent Finten: he appears in the same guise in a record of a synod at Mag nAilbe (on the River Barrow), where he was opposed by Mo Laisse of Leighlin.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_9477"></a><span class="headword">Fintan</span> <span class="st"> [Fint&aacute;n moccu Echdach]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 603?)<span class="occ"></span> was the founder and patron saint of Clonenagh (Cluain Ednech or Ednig), situated in the territory of the Lo&iacute;gsi (partially represented by the modern co. Laois). Although Fintan's eighth-century life gave his father a different name (Cremthann, Crumthann) from the one in the genealogies (Gabr&iacute;ne or Gabr&eacute;n), all were agreed that, by paternal descent, he was of the Fothairt, a scattered people, principally of Leinster, to which Brigit was also believed to belong. The family background of his mother, Findnait, is unknown. Fintan belonged to the same generation of monastic founders as Columba of Iona and Cainnech of Aghaboe. His short life has as one of its principal concerns the situating of the saint in relation to these other monastic leaders of his generation. Thus, in his infancy, Columba of Iona is said by the life to have prophesied his greatness. This may be a reaction, in part, to the close friendship, attested in Adomn&aacute;n's life of Columba, between the founder of Iona and another saint of the Lo&iacute;gsi, Bishop Colm&aacute;n moccu Lo&iacute;gse, connected with a church a few miles to the east of Clonenagh. St Cainnech of Aghaboe (only about 8 miles to the south-west of Clonenagh, but in the neighbouring kingdom of Osraige) is likewise shown as an ally; yet he also appears as the leader of a delegation seeking to persuade Fintan to relax the severity of his monastic rule.<br>
<br>The terms in which the manner of life at Clonenagh is described suggest that the arguments advanced by Cainnech may have resembled those put forward by Gildas a generation earlier against the more extreme ascetics of his day. Similarly, the description of the mode of life at Clonenagh, although very brief, resembles that given by Rhigyfarch in his life of St David, probably using an earlier source: of the two marks of extreme asceticism in Rhigyfarch's account&#151;renunciation of any use of the plough in agriculture and renunciation of any drink apart from water&#151;the first recurs in the life of Fintan. Fintan's separation from the world is portrayed in the life as virtually complete, and it is clear that this is the rhetorical stance of the hagiographer, though it may also have been the aspiration of the saint. Born in the desert, Fintan was almost immediately handed over to a priest to be fostered and educated; when he founded his monastery, the life makes no mention of any royal participation; kings are mentioned only once&#151;wicked kings who plundered the home of the dead father of one of his monks. The only appearance of the ordinary laity, once Fintan has been born, is as perpetrators of homicide, as the subjects of miracles, or as possible candidates for the monastic life. Fintan's feast day is given in the martyrologies of Tallaght and &Oacute;engus as 17 February; this may explain why his obit is given as the first entry under 603 in the annals of Ulster; but alternatively, since the source of the early annals was Iona, this may reflect the high esteem in which he was held by the Columban community.<br>
<br>A somewhat later figure was <a name="cosubject_76759"></a><span class="headword">M&aacute;el Ruain</span>  (<em>d.</em> 792)<span class="occ"></span>, founder and patron saint of Tallaght, co. Dublin, who was the central figure in what historians have described as the monastic reform movement known as the C&eacute;li D&eacute;, &#145;Clients of God&#146;. His feast day, 7 July, is given in the martyrology of Tallaght, completed <i>c</i>.830 and reflecting the interest of his circle in earlier saints, both Irish and non-Irish. The versified counterpart, known as the martyrology of &Oacute;engus the Culdee (<span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso C&eacute;li D&eacute;</span>), is of the same period. Possible supporting evidence that M&aacute;el Ruain was indeed the founder of Tallaght (called M&aacute;el Ruain's Tallaght, Tamlachtae M&aacute;ele Ruain, after him) is given by a note in the martyrology of Tallaght for 10 August, &#145;M&aacute;el Ruain came to Tallaght with his relics of the holy martyrs and virgins&#146;  (ed. Best and Lawlor, 62). The word <i>tamlachtae</i> means a burial-ground but in the eighth century this was not necessarily yet attached to a church. Tallaght is not attested before M&aacute;el Ruain; the note may thus refer to a foundation rather than merely to the arrival of relics.<br>
<br>The evidence for M&aacute;el Ruain may be divided into ninth-century texts written by his disciples and their allies, and other texts of much less certain date such as &#145;The Unity of M&aacute;el Ruain&#146;, a list of his monastic associates preserved in a twelfth-century manuscript. The most important ninth-century text is that called by modern scholars &#145;The monastery of Tallaght&#146;. This is a collection of the sayings and practices of M&aacute;el Ruain and others, such as M&aacute;el D&iacute;thruib, &#145;Devotee of a Desert&#146;, anchorite of Terryglass, who died in 841. Some of its material also occurs in another collection of such sayings called &#145;The rule of the C&eacute;li D&eacute;&#146;. The relationship between the collections has not yet been fully elucidated, but it is clear that they owe much to the model offered by collections of the teachings of the monks of the Egyptian desert, notably a text well-known in Ireland, the <span class="italic">Conferences</span> of John Cassian. Historians have seen M&aacute;el Ruain as the principal leader of a movement aiming at an ascetic revival within Irish monasticism in opposition to current laxity. They have also seen him and his allies as the originators of the &#145;culdees&#146; or C&eacute;li D&eacute;, who by the twelfth century were widespread in Scotland as well as in Ireland. It remains uncertain how far this picture will stand up to critical examination. It has also been claimed that the C&eacute;li D&eacute; were instrumental in promoting vernacular religious literature, and it has been suggested that this Irish revival of the late eighth and early ninth centuries may owe something to monastic reform under Charlemagne.<br>
