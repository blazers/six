<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Walwyn,  Fulke Thomas Tyndall</span>  (1910&#150;1991), <span class="occ">racehorse trainer</span>, was born on 8 November 1910 at The Gables, Wrexham, Denbighshire, the son of Fulke James Walwyn, a captain (later lieutenant-colonel) in the Royal Welch Fusiliers, and his wife, Louisa Norah Lockhart, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Greenshields. He was educated at Malvern College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, before being commissioned into the 9th lancers. He resigned in 1935 following adverse publicity from a court case involving a Soho nightclub fracas in which he appeared as a prosecution witness. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was ruled unfit for active service and became a military policeman at Tidworth for two years before securing a medical upgrade and serving with his old regiment in France. His first marriage was on 28 September 1937 to Diana Carlos Clarke (1916/17&#150;1949), daughter of Major Charles Loraine Carlos Clarke, army officer. There were no children of the marriage. On 24 June 1952 he married Catherine (<i>b</i>. 1928), fourth and youngest daughter of Sir Humphrey Edmund de Trafford, fourth baronet. They had one daughter, Jane (<i>b</i>. 1957).<br>
<br>Walwyn's father had been an outstanding showjumper and master of the Monmouthshire hounds, and Walwyn and his twin sister, Helen, learned to ride and hunt at an early age. His first racing win was on Ciren in a point-to-point in April 1930 and his first under National Hunt rules on Alpine Hut at Cardiff the same month. He became a successful gentleman rider, winning the amateur championship three times and piloting Reynoldstown to victory in the 1936 Grand National despite losing both his whip and an iron. After resigning from the army he turned professional and won several races before a near-fatal fall at Ludlow in 1939 fractured his skull and rendered him unconscious for a month. He then turned to training, operating a small establishment at Delamere House in Lambourn and winning eighteen races before the outbreak of war.<br>
<br>In 1944 Walwyn purchased Saxon House Stables in Upper Lambourn and in 1946&#150;7 he took the first of three successive National Hunt trainers' titles. For a number of years he was also a successful flat race trainer. Much of his early success over jumps and hurdles was with Dorothy Paget's horses. Although she had a reputation for dismissing her trainers at whim, Walwyn lasted nearly ten years and even curbed her habit of late-night phone calls and nocturnal visits to the stables. On one memorable occasion on 29 September 1948 Walwyn and jockey Bryan Marshall almost took her horses through the card at Folkestone, winning five and coming second in the last race. Ultimately he broke with Miss Paget in 1954, after having &#145;had enough&#146; of her difficult behaviour  (Munting, 122). His boxes did not remain empty for long. He attracted some outstanding animals, including Mill House, who in 1963 won the Cheltenham Gold Cup, the Hennessy, and the King George, and Diamond Edge, twice a Whitbread winner, in 1979 and 1981. His favourite, however, was the diminutive Mandarin who arrived in 1954 with a reputation as a poor jumper but under Walwyn's tuition won the Hennessy and King George in 1957, the King George again in 1959, the Hennessy again in 1961, and the Cheltenham Gold Cup the following year. In 1973, following the death of Peter Cazalet, the queen mother transferred her horses to Saxon House and Walwyn went on to win 150 races for her.<br>
<br>Walwyn had a remarkable career. In addition to his five training titles (he won again in 1957&#150;8 and 1963&#150;4) his horses brought him the prestigious Hennessy and Whitbread chases seven times each, the Grand Military gold cup also seven times, the King George VI five times, the Cheltenham Gold Cup four times, the Champion Hurdle and the Scottish Grand National twice, and the Aintree Grand National once. Ironically for a man brought up near Chepstow racecourse he never won the Welsh Grand National. Overall he trained the winners of 2188 races over jumps and hurdles. To celebrate his 2000th winner Warwick racecourse held a Fulke Walwyn Day.<br>
<br>Walwyn lived for his horses. He understood them and treated each one of his string as an individual animal. He was a wizard with doubtful legs, had unswerving patience, and never hurried an injured horse back into serious training. His was an intuitive art, and when asked the secret of his success he always acknowledged the contributions of his staff, many of whom stayed with him for decades. The lads, he explained, were closest to the horses, and a good one could tell a trainer much about the animals for which he was responsible. Nevertheless he disliked delegation. He had infinite patience with horses, less with people, and jockeys who failed to ride to orders or who were too hard on his horses could expect a fierce blast even before they dismounted. Yet he was also quick to praise. If a jockey had ridden a good race he would be the first to say so. He rode out every day until he was sixty-six, only then choosing to accompany his horses to morning exercise in a Land Rover.<br>
<br>Walwyn died of bronchopneumonia and ischaemic heart disease at Saxon House on 18 February 1991, a year after retiring and handing over the running of the stables to his wife, who, with his daughter, survived him. He was appointed CVO in 1983 but probably would have been more honoured by the posthumous renaming of the Kim Muir memorial chase&#151;the three-mile race for amateur riders on the opening day of the Cheltenham National Hunt festival&#151;as the Fulke Walwyn challenge cup chase. A memorial service, attended by Queen Elizabeth, the queen mother, was held at the church of St Michael and All Angels, Lambourn, Berkshire, on 11 March 1991.<br>
