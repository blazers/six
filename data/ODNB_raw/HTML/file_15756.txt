<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Knollys,  Hanserd</span>  (1598&#150;1691), <span class="occ">Particular Baptist minister and author</span>, was born in Calkwell, near Louth in Lincolnshire, but grew up in Scartho, near Grimsby (also in Lincolnshire). His father, Richard Knollys, was vicar of two churches in Grimsby and Scartho. The first name of his mother is unknown but his maternal grandparents were Richard Hanserd and Christobel Sutcliffe.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlylife"></a>Education and early life</h2>Hanserd Knollys was educated at home by a private tutor and later at Grimsby grammar school and St Catharine's College, Cambridge. The precise date of his matriculation (as a pensioner) is unclear with the sources being inconsistent on the point. Some authorities, including <span class="italic">Alumni Cantabrigienses</span> itself, indicate 1629, but it was more probably in 1627. From his own brief account of his days at Cambridge it is plain that Knollys was already greatly concerned with spiritual matters, and it was at Cambridge that he came under the influence of puritans, whose works, he reports, he spent a good deal of time reading. Knollys later taught at Gainsborough grammar school, but after his ordination by the bishop of Peterborough as deacon on 29 June 1629 and then, the following day, his ordination as priest, he was given a small living at Humberstone (Lincolnshire). On 22 May 1632 he married Anne Cheney of Wyberton (<i>d</i>. 1671), near Boston, Lincolnshire, &#145;a holy, discreet woman, and a help meet for me, in the ways of her household, and also in the way of holiness; who was my companion in all my sufferings, travels, and hardships that we endured for the gospel&#146;  (Knollys and Kiffin, 8&#150;9). The marriage lasted almost forty years and produced seven sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Some time after his marriage, probably about 1636, Knollys came to the view that the wearing of a surplice, the use of the sign of the cross at baptism, and the admission of those known to be wicked to the eucharist were all improper, and resigned his living. Thinking well of Knollys the bishop of Lincoln, John Williams, was keen that he should not resign and offered him a better living. Knollys refused. However, with the full knowledge of the bishop he did continue to preach. The bishop's toleration is not altogether surprising: he was already well known for his toleration of puritans. Furthermore Knollys's particular objection to practices considered either non-biblical and / or high church, would have gained a sympathetic hearing from the fundamentally anti-Laudian Williams. Knollys's disagreement with established religion, however, deepened to the point where he came to the view, in his words, that &#145;my ordination received from the Bishop was not right, and though I had preached some years by virtue of that ordination, I had not received any seal from Christ of my ministry&#146;. Knollys therefore renounced not only his living but his ordination itself and determined &#145;not to preach any more, until I had a clear call and commission from Christ&#146;  (Knollys and Kiffin, 9). Such a call came, it seems, after extended discussions with the puritan minister John Wheelwright, who convinced Knollys that he should seek righteousness by grace. It was at this point, Knollys later stated, that he &#145;began to preach the doctrine of free grace, according to the tenor of the new and everlasting covenant, for three or four years together, whereby very many sinners were converted, and many believers were established in the faith&#146;  (ibid., 16).<h2>
<a name="Americansojourn"></a>American sojourn</h2>In 1636 Knollys was arrested by order of the court of high commission and taken to the house of the man who served the warrant but, Knollys later wrote, &#145;God helped me to convince him, and he was so greatly terrified in his conscience that he set open the doors and let me go away&#146;  (Knollys and Kiffin, 16). Knollys then fled with his family to London where he spent some considerable time before boarding a ship for Boston, Massachusetts. In the <span class="italic">Life</span> he describes a hard sea passage lasting fourteen weeks. During the passage, according to Governor Winthrop, one of Knollys's children died.<br>
<br>Knollys's time in Boston was relatively short: he himself indicates that he was in America &#145;about four years&#146;  (Knollys and Kiffin, 17), though it may have been slightly less than this. According to White, Knollys may not have arrived in Boston before the summer of 1638, and he arrived back in London on 24 December 1641. His time in America was not particularly easy. He arrived without means of support and with very little money, living in a house that a friend had loaned him. He became unpopular in Boston itself on account of alleged antinomianism, an unwelcome reputation that did not diminish when, upon moving to Pascataquack (Piscataqua) where he gathered a church, he was charged with, and apparently admitted to, sexual misconduct. (It is worth noting that Wheelwright had also departed for Massachusetts in 1636 and he too quickly became involved in the antinomian controversy there. Though documentary evidence to support the conclusion is lacking, then, it may have been that Knollys's association with his old spiritual adviser continued during this time.)<br>
<br>There were other troubles as well, including a significant dispute with another exile, Thomas Larkham, which resulted in charges of inciting a riot. Knollys got himself into further trouble for criticizing the Massachusetts magistrates and as a result was forced to leave the area and move to Long Island, though here too a protest was filed against him. Perhaps somewhat fortunately Knollys was at this time called home by his ageing father, a call which he answered, and thus ended what must have been a far less than happy sojourn.<h2>
<a name="Englandandfurtherdissent"></a>England and further dissent</h2>On returning to London in December 1641 Knollys once again faced financial hardship from which he was rescued, he later reported, by some Christian friends. One of these was Dr John Bastwick, a determined presbyterian, who like Knollys had previously found himself on the wrong side of the law. Despite this initial act of friendship, however, Knollys and Bastwick were later to engage in bitter doctrinal dispute on the question of church government. These Christian friends provided free lodgings and in addition some money. Preferring, Knollys wrote, to work for a living than to be maintained by such charity he returned to school teaching, at first by taking on some former pupils of a deceased schoolmaster who had lived nearby and then by becoming master of the free school in the parish of St Mary Axe. Times appear to have been happier and he reports considerable success in gathering 140 day scholars and sixteen boarders. Knollys left this employment, however, to become a preacher in the parliamentarian army. As uncompromising as ever, it seems, he felt constrained to leave the army too once he &#145;did perceive the commanders sought their own things more than the cause of God and his people, breaking their vows and solemn engagements&#146;  (Knollys and Kiffin, 20). Again he returned to London and again he was arrested for unlicensed preaching. However, though he was kept several days in gaol, he was released after giving an account of himself to the authorities. About this time he was preaching also in Suffolk, for which again he was arrested and was again, according to his own account, acquitted and indeed given permission by parliament upon the petition of the inhabitants of Ipswich to preach in the region without hindrance. However, following another disturbance, probably near Woodbridge, during which he was &#145;stoned out of the pulpit&#146;, his efforts became once more concentrated in London  (ibid., 22). Tensions continued and further arrests followed.<br>
<br>By 1644 it seems that Knollys became a member of Henry Jessey's congregation. Jessey was the minister of an Independent church in London, a church which has a strong claim to being the first Independent church in the capital, the founder of which was Henry Jacob. By the time Knollys joined the group this congregation had already suffered some internal dispute on the question of both the mode and timing of baptism (it was really the latter rather than the former that was the central issue in early Baptist controversies). This controversy quickly touched Knollys and his wife, who both refused to have their new-born son baptized. Jessey himself originally adopted a view in favour of infant baptism (by immersion); however, when the question was revisited, his views changed and he was subsequently himself baptized by Knollys in June 1645, laying himself open to the charge of Anabaptism.<br>
<br>Knollys himself &#145;gathered&#146; a church in 1645, one of the first Particular Baptist congregations anywhere  (Knollys and Kiffin, 25). This met next door to St Helen, Bishopgate, where on 10 August 1645 he was heard to pray for the Leveller leader John Lilburne; he was evicted from the property and moved his activities to Finsbury Fields. From there the church moved to Coleman Street, George Yard, Whitechapel, and finally to Broken Wharf, Thames Street. Knollys maintained his association with this congregation for the rest of his life, though in his own words &#145;I was absent from the Church sometimes upon just occasions, and with their leave, or forced from them by violent persecution&#146;  (ibid., 23). Along with another former Church of England clergyman Benjamin Cox he subscribed to the second edition of the confession of faith issued by the London Baptists in 1646. Also in 1646 came <span class="italic">An Appendix to a Confession of Faith</span>, written by Cox, but probably expressing the views of the whole London Baptist group. &#145;The high Calvinist soteriology and a refusal to admit any to communion who had not been baptised as believers&#146; are evident throughout that document  (White, 9).<br>
<br>Throughout this time Knollys continued teaching to provide the means of support for himself and his family, though he took on other posts too. Between 1645 and 1660 he held several offices including examiner at the customs and excise, a post he relinquished on 29 March 1653. He was clerk of the check until 23 May 1655. It was during this time that he studied with Christian Ravis from whom he learned Hebrew. Knollys also returned to Scartho, his home, where, on 12 October 1658 he was installed as vicar of St Giles, a post he held for some time without relinquishing his leadership of the London church. Knollys' ministry in Scartho is a surprising turn of events: he had, after all, resigned from the Church of England a dozen years earlier and was by this time quite clearly in the nonconformist camp. How Knollys himself accommodated two apparently divergent sets of views is unclear, and one can only assume that his father's term in the same church meant that, as a Knollys, he was accepted even if he was known to hold rather different views. (Cheney Knollys, Hanserd's son, was later to serve in the same parish.) Quite how unusual this arrangement was in the late 1640s is not entirely clear; however, we do know that some nineteen Particular Baptists were ejected from other livings during the period from 1660 to 1662.<br>
<br>Thomas Venner's insurrection in January 1661 and the subsequent clampdown it brought once more led to Knollys's arrest. There is no hard evidence that Knollys was in substantial sympathy with the views of Venner or the Fifth Monarchists, but he was nevertheless judged guilty by association on at least two counts. Both have an element of plausibility: first, a number of Venner's followers had previously belonged to Knollys's congregation and some fourteen of them, though not Knollys himself, had signed the Fifth Monarchist manifesto, <span class="italic">A Declaration of Several of the Churches of Christ</span>; and second, Knollys had visited the Fifth Monarchist visionary Anna Trapnell, though what the purpose of this visit was is unclear. There was hence certainly some smoke, if not an obvious fire, and Knollys was subsequently committed to Newgate prison where he remained for eighteen weeks. The <span class="roman">Act of Pardon</span> which accompanied the restored king's coronation gave him his freedom. His continued association (loosely at least) with, and preaching at, All Hallows Church, a focal point of millenarian excitement in London, however, meant that he remained under suspicion, with the result that he fled first to the Netherlands and then to Germany where he remained, he reported, for &#145;two or three years&#146;  (Knollys and Kiffin, 25). During this time he had substantial property confiscated in London, despite, he claimed, winning a legal battle relating to this matter. After this time he returned to London via Rotterdam and once back in London resumed his teaching; by the time of his death he had built up a substantial school.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>On 19 May 1670 Knollys was again arrested during a meeting at George Yard and was sent to Bishopsgate compter, but was allowed to preach to the prisoners. He was soon set at liberty again. The last twenty years of his life are left uncharted in his autobiography. But it is plain they were hard for him physically, emotionally, and spiritually. He struggled against illness, the loss of family through sickness and death (his wife died on 30 April 1671), and his own doubts. In his preface to Knollys's <span class="italic">Life</span>, William Kiffin suggests that Knollys did write more, but that the latter part was lost. From other sources, however, it is plain that Knollys became a central figure in the first steps towards the consolidation and formal organization of the Baptist movement. For example, together with Kiffin, he was among the first London signatories who called for the assembly of churches held in London from 3 to 12 September 1689. It was here that the impetus towards the consolidation of the Baptist movement really took hold. He attended also the assemblies of 1690 and 1691. He died on 19 September 1691 and was buried in Bunhill Fields, London.<br>
<br>As a key figure in the early growth of the Baptist movement, especially the Particular Baptists, Knollys's influence should not be underestimated. Even if, as now seems probable, he did not himself convert Jessey to the Baptist cause, he was at least a partner in the discussions and central to developments. His extended period as minister of an Independent congregation in London brought some stability, as did his drive towards final organization, while his undoubted learning was put to the task of providing some theological undergirding of positions that were emerging.<br>
<br>Knollys was a prolific author. One of the more important of his works is his autobiography, published posthumously as <span class="italic">The life and death of that old disciple of Jesus Christ and eminent minister of the gospel, Mr Hanserd Knollys who died in the ninety third year of his age; written in his own hand to the year 1672 and continued in general, in an epistle by Mr William Kiffin, to which is added his last legacy to the church</span> (1692). This work provides a firsthand account of the trials and strains, as well as the beliefs, of a seventeenth-century English dissenter and as such provides a window on the turbulent and somewhat unstable political and religious world which he inhabited. The same is true of his several polemical works such as his <span class="italic">A Moderate Answer to Dr Bastwick's Book called &#145;Independency not God's Ordinance&#146;</span> (1645), which outlines his views on the nature of the Christian congregation and places the same in the direct context of the seventeenth-century debate regarding episcopacy and church government in general. The following year, 1646, Knollys published <span class="italic">The Shining of a Flaming-Fire in Zion</span>, another polemical work, this time aimed at a book by &#145;Mr Saltmarsh&#146;. Knollys's work disputes Saltmarsh's interpretation of a number of <span class="roman">New Testament</span> texts relating to baptism and in the course of doing so again both outlines his own views on the issue and places them in the broader context in which they were formed. His writings on the book of <span class="roman">Revelation</span> are particularly informative, for they indicate further (and in dramatic form) the extent to which polemics were an important part of the world that Knollys inhabited. This is seen especially in <span class="italic">An Exposition of the Whole Book of the Revelation</span> (1689) and <span class="italic">An Exposition of the Eleventh Chapter of Revelation</span> (1679) which illustrate clearly enough the widespread fears of Catholic plots. Unsurprisingly in both these works Knollys reflects the standard protestant view of his day, namely that the archvillain of <span class="roman">Revelation</span> is the pope and that the book as a whole outlines the struggle between the true church and its enemies. He also published a number of grammars of the Greek, Latin, and Hebrew languages.<br>
