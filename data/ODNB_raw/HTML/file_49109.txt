<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Knight family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1680&#150;1897), <span class="occ">ironmasters</span>, came to prominence with the activities of <a name="cosubject_49106"></a><span class="headword">Richard Knight</span>  (1659&#150;1745)<span class="occ"></span>. He was the son of Richard Knight of Madeley, Shropshire, and he learned his trade while working at the Lower Coalbrookdale forge. He then moved to take over the Morton forge on the River Roden, also in Shropshire. Here he met and married Elizabeth (1671&#150;1754), the daughter of Andrew Payne of Shawbury, a member of a prominent Shropshire family involved in the iron industry. They had four sons, two of whom followed their father into the iron trade. At various times Richard Knight held furnaces at Flaxley in the Forest of Dean, Willey in Shropshire, and Ruabon in north Wales. He also owned several forges in Shropshire and the Stour valley.<br>
<br>Richard Knight's interests in the iron industry of the midlands were further expanded when he entered the &#145;Ironworks in Partnership&#146;, which was dominated by the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47491/', "Foley family (per. c.1620&#150;1716)")</script>. The group comprised several ironmasters who brought their ironmaking properties together to form an important company, which was a major force within the British charcoal iron industry. Also from about 1698 Richard Knight operated the Bringewood furnace and forge and these were later linked with the Charlcotte furnace.<br>
<br>By 1725 Richard Knight had left the Ironworks in Partnership in order to expand his ironmaking interests in the Stour valley. This he achieved with the help of his son <a name="cosubject_49107"></a><span class="headword">Edward Knight</span>  (1699&#150;1780)<span class="occ"></span> when they entered into a partnership with Sir Thomas Lyttleton of Hagley Hall. Lyttleton brought Hales furnace into the partnership while the Knights contributed forges at Cookley and Whittington, both situated on the River Stour. The pig iron from Hales could be refined at the Stour forges to make wrought iron. This iron then found a ready market among the smiths and nailers of the midlands.<br>
<br>Richard Knight seems to have exhibited much drive and enthusiasm in building up his ironmaking empire. He was certainly not afraid of switching his resources from area to area and managed to build up a large personal fortune through his activities in the iron trade. He died in 1745, five years after his retirement from the active management of the family's ironworks.<br>
<br>The Knight family's interest in the iron trade now lay in two distinct and separate partnerships. The Bringewood partnership held furnaces at Bringewood and Charlcotte in Shropshire and the forge at Bringewood. The Stour partnership held Hales furnace and a series of forges along the River Stour; it was dominated by the Knights and from the late 1730s was totally in the hands of the family. From the retirement of Richard Knight the iron business had been managed by his sons Edward and <a name="cosubject_49108"></a><span class="headword">Ralph Knight</span>  (1703&#150;1754)<span class="occ"></span>, who married Mary Dupa. Edward Knight was the innovator and in the late 1730s and early 1740s he built a plating mill at Bringewood to produce plate to be tinned at one of the family's Stour forges. This was one of the earliest tin-plate making concerns in Britain. In 1726 Edward married Elizabeth James, heir of Olton End, Warwickshire. The marriage produced three sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Ralph Knight died in 1754 and Edward Knight was then later helped in the management of the works by his sons, <a name="cosubject_49109"></a><span class="headword">James Knight</span>  (1735&#150;1808)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_49110"></a><span class="headword">John [i] Knight</span>  (1740&#150;1795)<span class="occ"></span>. James was unmarried, but John [i] married Henrietta Cunyngham. The successful operation of all the Knight family's ironworks allowed a period of expansion in the 1740s and 1750s, when Aston furnace and a forge at Bromford, near Birmingham, were purchased. The four furnaces owned by the family gave it an important position in the British iron industry and in the late 1750s the Knights produced about 8 per cent of Britain's total pig iron output.<br>
<br>Edward Knight had the foresight to adapt to the changing conditions in the iron industry during the 1750s. Charcoal iron was now competing with coke iron, whose manufacture was spreading quickly. Edward Knight used his home at Wolverley House, Worcestershire, as the centre of his operations and Wolverley forge was one of the most important parts of his ironmaking empire. It was here during the 1750s that Edward Knight introduced the manufacture of wrought iron using coke iron from Shropshire. Edward Knight was one of the first ironmasters to use coke iron at a forge, so demonstrating the acceptability of coke iron and heralding its dominance over charcoal iron.<br>
<br>Edward Knight retired from his business interests in 1771 leaving the furnaces and forges to be managed by James Knight, John [i] Knight, and their uncle Abraham Spooner. This took place during a period of great uncertainty as the charcoal iron industry came under increasing pressure from the spread of the manufacture of iron using coke as a fuel. The activities of the Bringewood partnership ended in 1779 and by 1785 all the family's charcoal-fired furnaces had been finally blown out. Edward Knight died in 1780.<br>
<br>The death of John [i] Knight in 1795 allowed his son <a name="cosubject_49111"></a><span class="headword">John [ii] Knight</span>  (1765&#150;1850)<span class="occ"></span> to take a prominent position in the Stour partnership. He had a most dynamic disposition for he immediately drew up plans to modernize the family's forges. John [ii] Knight applied the new methods of making wrought iron with coke to the forges. However, the death of James Knight in 1808 prompted a dismemberment of the partnership. The Spooner family took over the ownership of the properties around Birmingham, leaving John [ii] Knight with a reduced number of forges along the River Stour. Knight now concentrated his resources at one site on the Stour. This was the Cookley ironworks, where the manufacture of wire and tin plate was introduced alongside the production of wrought iron. After successfully modernizing Cookley John [ii] Knight seems to have searched for further challenges using money generated by the sale of shares in the Cookley concern. This took the form of purchases of land on Exmoor and in 1830 Knight took up residence in the area at Simonsbath House. His first wife was Helen Charlotte Weir. John [ii] Knight's considerable talents and energies were now being channelled away from the iron trade and into a scheme for taming and farming parts of Exmoor's wild lands. This interest in Exmoor was financed by selling some of his holdings in the family business to outsiders. However, Knight did not realize all his schemes for Exmoor since the health of his second wife, Jane Elizabeth Winn, daughter of the first Baron Headley, began to fail, which prompted a move to Jersey and then, later, another to Rome, where she died in 1841.<br>
<br>The sale of shares in the Cookley ironworks left the Knight family as a minority holder in the partnership. However, deaths among the partners in the late 1870s and early 1880s forced <a name="cosubject_49112"></a><span class="headword">Sir Frederic Winn Knight</span>  (1812&#150;1897)<span class="occ"></span>, John [ii] Knight's eldest son, to become managing partner. At the age of sixty-nine Frederic Winn Knight became the manager of the Cookley Iron and Tinplate Works, although he acknowledged that previously he had taken no interest in its management. He was educated at Charterhouse School (<i>c</i>.1823&#150;1828) and at the age of twenty-nine took over the management of the Knight estates on Exmoor. Frederic Winn Knight married Maria Louisa Couling Gibbs in 1850 and they had one son. He was a man of great determination and almost boundless energy. In the same year that he took over the running of the Knight estates he was elected MP for West Worcestershire. Frederic Winn Knight represented the constituency for forty-four years and while an MP he was parliamentary secretary to the Poor Law Board in 1852 under Lord Derby's administration and again in 1858&#150;9 under Lord Palmerston. His only commercial experience before the management of Cookley was gained as a director of the Bank of London and the National Provincial Insurance Association. Frederic Winn Knight was knighted in 1886 for public services as a member of parliament and a justice of the peace. He seems to have inherited the family trait of making bold decisions, for in 1886 he moved the iron business from Cookley to Brockmoor at Brierley Hill in the Black Country. He died at 19 Marlborough Buildings, Bath, on 3 May 1897. He was survived by his wife. The new works was operated by a new limited company with Knight involvement into the early years of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>The Knights are a unique family within the story of the British iron industry. Although other midland families, such as the Foleys and the Darbys, had a long involvement in the iron trade, not one can match the activities of the Knights, which stretch from the seventeenth century to the twentieth.<br>
