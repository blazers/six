<span class="headword">Webber,  William Southcombe  Lloyd</span>  (1914&#150;1982), <span class="occ">composer and organist</span>, was born at 274 King's Road, Chelsea, London, on 11 March 1914, the son of William Charles Henry Webber, a self-employed plumber, and his wife, Mary Winifred Gittins. His father was a considerable authority on pipe-organ building, and from an early age the younger William was taken to see famous organs all over the country, developing an almost obsessional interest in the instrument. Aged thirteen he broadcast a recital from St Mary-le-Bow in London, and by the age of fourteen he was well known throughout the country as a recitalist. Webber won an organ scholarship to Mercer's School in 1925 and the Sir John Goss scholarship to the Royal College of Music in 1931. It was at this time that he changed his surname to Lloyd Webber, as there was another organist at the Royal College with a similar name. He studied composition with Ralph Vaughan Williams and the organ with Dr Henry Ley. In 1933 he obtained the fellowship diploma of the Royal College of Organists, becoming the youngest person ever to do so.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Lloyd Webber maintained an interest in the organ, becoming successively organist at Christchurch, Newgate Street (1929&#150;32), St Cyprian's, Clarence Gate (1933&#150;9), All Saints, Margaret Street (1939&#150;48), and Westminster Central Hall (1958&#150;82). As a performer, he was much admired. A former curate of All Saints remarked that he was &#145;an organist of rare distinction. His playing had about it a vitality and colour and crispness which were unequalled&#146;  (Williams, 117). At the Royal College of Music he played Max Reger's fiendishly complicated <span class="italic">Phantasie und Fuge &uuml;ber B-A-C-H</span> from memory, only a week after purchasing a copy of the score. This raw talent never left him; as a reviewer in the <span class="italic">Musical Times</span> noted on one performance, &#145;Dr Lloyd Webber really must not give up the instrument that was his first enthusiasm &hellip; we cannot afford to spare native ability such as that&#146;  (Farmer). He gained his BMus in 1933 and his DMus from the London College of Music in 1938. In 1942 he married Jean Hermione Johnstone, a violinist and pianist who too was a pupil of Vaughan Williams. They met at All Saints, Margaret Street, where Jean was one of several sopranos who had been drafted in to sing in the choir in the wartime absence of the boys. They had two sons, Andrew (<i>b</i>. 1948), a popular composer, and Julian (<i>b</i>. 1951), a cellist. Life as a professional musician during the Second World War and in its immediate aftermath was difficult. Lloyd Webber was forced to supplement the meagre income he made from composing with various academic posts. From 1942 he taught as professor and examiner in theory and composition at the Royal College of Music, and he became the director of the London College of Music in 1964. He was appointed CBE for his services to music education in 1980.<br>
<br>Lloyd Webber wanted to make his living as a composer, but as he noted in an interview in the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> shortly before his death, &#145;it became basically a matter of finance. It's very difficult to make a living out of composition unless you succeed in the kind of work that Andrew does&#146;  (Gillard). As a composer, Lloyd Webber can be seen very much as a man in another age. His style is post-Romantic, echoing Rachmaninoff, Sibelius, and Franck, but never mere pastiche. Ironically, his own harmonic language is, in places, almost as daring as that of composers who were experimenting with the serialist and avante-garde techniques that he deplored, and yet he felt his style to be at odds with what was expected of composers at the time. His unwillingness to promote himself as a composer, in an era that heralded musicians such as Benjamin Britten, Michael Tippett, and William Walton, meant that most of his music did not receive the attention that it deserved until after his death. There were too many exceptional British composers active at the time for the music of the rather reserved Lloyd Webber to make any real impact. The reviewer and critic Felix Aprahamian noted, &#145;It was the same in France. We've all heard of Debussy and Ravel, but contemporary with these were at least twenty marvellous French composers &hellip; too many of them to find room at the top&#146;  (Campbell, 4). Lloyd Webber took each rejection as a profound and bitter blow. He all but ceased composing between 1960 and 1980, but, as the small number of works that date from this period demonstrate, the criticism of his music that he so painfully endured did not diminish his ability to compose, but rather his desire to do so.<br>
<br>At heart, Lloyd Webber was a miniaturist. He had a great capacity for expressing himself in a short space of time, and often much emotion is distilled in brief, intense statements. This leads some way towards an understanding of the brevity of much of his output, which consists largely of chamber music, songs, and works for solo instruments. Among his orchestral music, the tone poem <span class="italic">Aurora</span> (1951), depicting the arrival of the Roman goddess of the dawn, is his only real symphonic statement. Lloyd Webber seems to have been proud of this piece, given that he would talk about it with family and friends&#151;something that he rarely did in the case of any of his other works. There are a large number of sacred works, comprising short anthems, motets, and canticles and two settings of the ordinary of the mass&#151;the <span class="italic">Missa princeps pacis</span> (1962), written for the choir of Westminster Cathedral, and the <span class="italic">Missa sanctae Mariae Magdelenae</span> (1979). In addition to this, there are three larger-scale oratorios, of which <span class="italic">St Francis of Assisi</span> (1951) is of note.<br>
<br>Lloyd Webber died at Beaumont House, Beaumont Street, Westminster, London on 29 October 1982, having suffered a heart attack; his wife, Jean, survived him. With him died virtually all knowledge of his ability as a musician and composer, save for that of his family and a few close friends. By the beginning of the twenty-first century his music had begun to undergo something of a renaissance, and it was only posthumously that he came to be regarded by some as &#145;One of the finest all-round musicians this country has produced this century. A fine and refined composer whose contribution &hellip; was of considerable significance&#146;  (Hesford).<br>
