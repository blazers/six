<span class="headword">Crawfurd,  (John) Oswald Frederick</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>John Dangerfield]</span>  (1834&#150;1909), <span class="occ">writer and diplomatist</span>, born in Wilton Crescent, London, on 18 March 1834, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6651/', "John Crawfurd (1783&#150;1868)")</script>, diplomatist, and his wife, Anne Horatia (<i>d</i>. 1855), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21996/', "James Perry")</script>, editor of the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, and god-daughter of Horatio Nelson. Educated first at Eton College, Crawfurd then matriculated at Merton College, Oxford, in 1854 but left the university without taking a degree. Appointed on 23 January 1857 to a junior clerkship in the Foreign Office, he was sent in April 1866, having served in Madeira, as acting consul to Porto in Portugal. He became consul there on 13 January 1867 and filled the post competently, though not energetically, for the next twenty-four years. On 1 January 1890 he was made CMG.<br>
<br>While in Porto, Crawfurd spent his leisure time mainly in sport and literary work. In addition to several novels he published three sympathetic but sketchy studies of Portuguese life which are of interest for their accounts of the Portuguese peasantry and rural customs: <span class="italic">Travels in Portugal</span>, under the pseudonym John Latouche (1875; 3rd edn, 1878), <span class="italic">Portugal Old and New</span> (1880), and <span class="italic">Round the Calendar in Portugal</span> (1890).<br>
<br>Crawfurd's last two years in Portugal (1890&#150;91) were a period of great controversy. The &#145;ultimatum&#146; of Lord Salisbury to Portugal of 11 January 1890, the result of a dispute between Britain and Portugal over the territories known later as Zambia and Malawi, led to a wave of anti-British feeling, more violent in Porto than in other areas of Portugal. Crawfurd's house on the east side of the city was stoned, and there were demands for the withdrawal of his exequatur, co-ordinated by the Portuguese pressure group the Patriotic League of the North. He carried on with his duties until the demonstrations subsided, and then resigned on 17 June 1891. He then returned to England and spent his retirement in writing.<br>
<br>Crawfurd married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1899), younger daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9863/', "Richard Ford")</script>, author of the <span class="italic">Handbook to Spain</span>; they had one son, who died in infancy. In 1902 he married again, this time to Amelia (Lita) Browne, daughter of Hermann von Flesch Brunningen.<br>
<br>Although writing was for Crawfurd merely a recreation, his literary activity was diverse. A novelist, essayist, poet, and anthologist, the author of around forty volumes, he was also a frequent contributor under his own name and under pseudonyms to <span class="italic">The Times</span> and leading reviews. He edited the <span class="italic">New Quarterly Magazine</span> for some years, as well as <span class="italic">Chapman's Magazine of Fiction</span>. He was also a publisher, being an original director of <span class="italic">Black and White</span>, founded in 1891, and, through his friendship with Frederic Chapman, was a director and then managing director of Chapman and Hall&#151;a post for which he lacked obvious qualifications. Of his novels, <span class="italic">Sylvia Arden</span> (1877) was once the best-known. In others, such as <span class="italic">The World we Live in</span> (1884), <span class="italic">In Green Fields</span> (1906), and <span class="italic">The Mystery of Myrtle Cottage</span> (1908), he dealt with political and social questions, and a penchant for settings in remote parts of Britain is often shown. In the 1870s he published some fiction under the pseudonym John Dangerfield, and he also used the pseudonym George Windle Sandys. His verse plays, <span class="italic">Two Masques</span> (1902) and <span class="italic">The Sin of Prince Eladane</span> (1903), show competence in diction and prosody but lack dramatic values. He also compiled <span class="italic">Laws of Opposition Bridge</span> (1906).<br>
<br>Crawfurd was a typical minor writer of the later Victorian era, who also played a small but significant role in diplomatic history. He died at Montreux, Switzerland, on 31 January 1909; his second wife survived him.<br>
