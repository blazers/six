<span class="headword">Yonge,  Walter</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1579, <em>d.</em> 1649), <span class="occ">politician and diarist</span>, was baptized on 16 April 1579, the second son and heir of John Yonge (<i>d</i>. 1612), of Colyton, and his wife, Alice (<i>d</i>. 1631), daughter of Richard Starre of Seaton, Devon. Yonge is thought to have descended from a junior branch of the family of the fifteenth-century judge Thomas Yonge. His immediate forebears came from Berkshire at the end of that century in the person of his great-grandfather and namesake, who bought several manors in east Devon. Yonge's grandfather John married the heir of Colyton. His father was a prominent merchant who engaged in the first trading ventures to Africa. Yonge went to Magdalen College, Oxford, matriculating in 1599, but took no degree. In 1600 he entered the Middle Temple, and was called to the bar, but it is not known how far he practised. On 6 February 1601 he married Jane (<i>d</i>. 1655), daughter and coheir of Sir John Peryam of Exeter (and niece of Sir William Peryam, chief baron of the exchequer). They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>For the first part of his adult life Yonge lived at Upton Helions near Crediton, Devon, but because his elder brother, John, died early he succeeded to Colyton and the family's other manorial holdings on his father's death in 1612. He continued the family practice of purchasing manors, and like his father he was interested in overseas trade. In 1624 he invested in the Dorchester Company, an attempt to combine profit with consolidating godly settlements in New England. Yonge also made a notable contribution to local affairs. In 1625 he bought some land in trust under a charity which bore his name, for the benefit of the poor of Crediton; the charity was still operating 250 years later. Yonge was sheriff of Devon in 1628, and quartermaster-general to the Devon militia in 1635; he served as a JP for the county from 1622 until his death. He produced a manual listing the parliamentary statutes under which the justices worked, with the level of evidence and the penalties prescribed for each offence. In 1642 parliament ordered it to be printed for public use, as <span class="italic">A Justice of the Peace, his Vade-Mecum</span>.<br>
<br>This was Yonge's only published work, but for most of his life he kept a diary (now in the British Library), which is an important historical record. The volumes dating from before the civil war illustrate the growing popular criticism of the royal government. Always apprehensive of &#145;popish&#146; conspiracy, Yonge became increasingly suspicious of sacramentalist tendencies in the English church. He thought religion should focus on the elucidation of scripture. He was concerned about restrictions on preaching as early as 1606, when he objected to a licensing scheme outlawing independent lecturers, though he also noted parliament's attempts to ameliorate the rules. In 1622 he was dismayed by the government's suppression of anti-Catholic sentiment, and the instructions to ministers to &#145;preach but once a Sabbath &hellip; and only in their own cures&#146;. He was a stern advocate of moral discipline, believing that mixed dancing and stage plays &#145;tended to the high provocation of God's wrath&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 15, 64). He deplored the king's support for Sunday sports, and applauded parliament's opposition to them.<br>
<br>In the 1620s Yonge's diary was preoccupied with the Thirty Years' War. In January 1621 he cited parliament's declaration urging James I to go to war to recover the palatinate for his daughter, Elizabeth of Bohemia. But later Yonge had to record the sequence of ignominious failures of English armies in their belated interventions, followed by parliament's efforts to impeach the duke of Buckingham in 1626. Yonge is also suggested as the originator of a separate, detailed record of that controversial parliament  (BL, Add. MS 22474). War accentuated the problem of finance, and Yonge disapproved of any kind of extra-parliamentary taxation. He believed that the benevolence of 1622 should have been raised &#145;in a legal course of Parliaments&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 61). He absented himself from the commission to implement the forced loan in 1626, and noted the resistance in other counties. He kept reports of the ensuing prosecutions, and indicated his belief that it was the king who was infringing the law. In the 1630s Yonge called the judges who defended ship money &#145;pro-rege&#146;, and those who opposed it &#145;pro-patria&#146;  (diary, BL, Add. MS 35331, fol. 68<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Yonge had many reasons to stand as an MP when in December 1640 the Long Parliament approved the petition of Honiton in Devon for its electoral rights to be revived. Yonge owned a manor in Honiton parish. And he clearly had a high opinion of parliament's capacities. Puritan and &#145;country&#146; sympathies may well have influenced the restoration of borough franchises in 1640. Yonge was related to one of the opposition leaders, William Strode, and must have been a welcome recruit in the house. He supported early radical demands for a parliamentary voice in ministerial appointments. On 18 December 1641 he made the &#145;startling suggestion&#146; that the bill of tonnage and poundage should include a proviso that Sir Henry Vane be retained as treasurer of the navy, against the king's wishes  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, ed. Coates, xxxi).<br>
<br>Yonge naturally became a parliamentarian in the civil war. He kept a parliamentary diary from September 1642 to December 1645  (BL, Add. MSS 18777&#150;18780). It is a valuable record of the progress of the war and the state of opinion in parliament, but adds little to knowledge of Yonge's own views. He did play a significant part in the settlement of religion. In June 1643 he was one of twenty MPs named to the assembly of divines. He also sat on a subcommittee of sixteen MPs producing draft ordinances from the assembly's work for parliament to consider. In July 1643 he went to Scotland with the English commissioners. It is not clear whether he supported Scottish theocratic presbyterianism, or parliament's preference for a less restrictive, Erastian church. But his faith in the individual analysis of scripture was further revealed when the royalists in Devon captured a &#145;seditious lecturer&#146; at his house in 1644  (Cliffe, 87). Yonge included detailed reports of sermons in his parliamentary notebooks. A separate collection, &#145;Reports of sermons in London, 1642&#150;4&#146;, is attributed to his second son, Walter (BL, Add. MSS 18781&#150;18782).<br>
<br>Yonge also specialized in committees on legal matters, and chaired the committee to turn parliament's ordinances into statutes after the war. This was an awkward proposition. But Yonge compiled a notebook of precedents suggesting that parliament held residual authority in the state. And he concluded that because parliament represented the whole kingdom, it could be regarded as the true, binding legislative power, independently of the king. Finally Yonge assisted the parliamentarian cause through his experience in naval affairs and military supply. He became a victualler of the navy after the outbreak of war, and was still acting in that capacity in October 1648.<br>
<br>Yonge's attitude to the army's purge of parliament in December of that year is uncertain. He had already begun to withdraw from parliamentary activities, and does not appear on the list of secluded members. He died in November 1649, and was buried at Colyton on 26 November. His widow, Jane, was buried there on 17 April 1655. His eldest son, Sir John (1603&#150;1663), was one of the secluded MPs in 1648, and was made a baronet at the Restoration, though the family remained nonconformist in religion.<br>
