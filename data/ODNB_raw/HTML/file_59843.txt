<span class="headword">Riddell,  Hannah</span>  (1855&#150;1932), <span class="occ">medical missionary</span>, was born on 17 October 1855 at 9 The Barracks, Barnet, Hertfordshire, the only daughter of Daniel Riddle (1810&#150;1889) (he always spelt his name differently from his wife and daughter) and Hannah Wright (1814&#150;1886), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hunt. Daniel was born in Glasgow, the son of a weaver. He joined the army in 1837 and served in India and China. In 1853 he was appointed a staff sergeant in the militia and posted to Barnet. After retiring from the army in 1877 he took his family to live in Oystermouth near Swansea. Here they rented Russell House where Hannah ran a boarding-school for young ladies until she became bankrupt soon after her father's death in 1889. After release from bankruptcy she went to Liverpool in October 1889, where she was appointed deputy superintendent at the YMWCA.<br>
<br>Hannah was in Liverpool for less than a year before joining the Church Missionary Society (CMS) which in 1888 had decided to start sending women missionaries abroad. Apart from her orphaned niece, Ada Wright, to whom she was devoted, Hannah had few ties in England and accepted her posting to Japan with enthusiasm. She arrived in Kobe on 16 January 1891, where she stayed for several months before being sent to Kumamoto in Kyushu. A strong, forceful woman over 6 feet tall, Hannah was soon at odds with the small band of British missionaries stationed there, most of whom she regarded as lacking drive and ambition. They in turn found her pushy and extravagant, and disliked her practice of ignoring orthodox channels by writing directly to CMS headquarters in London in order to achieve her aims.<br>
<br>Soon after arriving in Kumamoto, Hannah visited the Honmyoji Temple, a favourite gathering place for lepers, where for the first time she encountered leprosy &#145;in every degree of loathsomeness&#146;  (report to CMS, 1 Dec 1891, Archives of the CMS). Profoundly shocked by the experience, she discovered that little or no provision was made for the victims of leprosy, a disease prevalent in Japan until effective drugs were developed in the 1940s.<br>
<br>Hannah decided to build a hospital in Kumamoto devoted to the care of lepers, and energetically set about raising the necessary funds. She received only lukewarm support from her fellow missionaries who felt that such a venture detracted from their primary task of converting the &#145;heathen&#146; to Christianity. But, despite many difficulties, the Hospital of the Resurrection of Hope was finally opened on 12 November 1895.<br>
<br>Over the next few years Hannah's relations with her missionary colleagues steadily deteriorated. The CMS eventually decided to remove her altogether from Japan, but Hannah, determined not to abandon her patients, instead resigned from the society in 1900 and thereafter directed the hospital independently until her death. Money was a constant problem, but she established an impressive network of support, and donations (many of them very small) came in from Japan, England, and America. The hospital's precarious income did not deter Hannah from living in a lavish style that many people considered inappropriate for a missionary. She vigorously justified such expenditure by claiming that unless she appeared to be a lady of class and substance, she would not be taken seriously by those in a position to underpin her work.<br>
<br>Along with most of her contemporaries (including many distinguished doctors) Hannah had a minimal understanding of the pathology of leprosy. She erroneously asserted that the only way to eliminate the disease was by strict sex segregation. But she did influence official and public attitudes to leprosy. The result was more humane treatment of its victims. Thanks in part to her impassioned lobbying of the Japanese government the first legislation to provide for the care, rather than control, of lepers went through the Diet in 1907, and over the next few years five national leprosaria were built. She also initiated leper relief work in Kusatsu and Okinawa. Articulate and energetic, Hannah was a tireless traveller and lecturer in the promotion of her cause. She won both moral and financial support from many influential figures in Meiji Japan and, most important, from the imperial family. For her contribution to the fight against leprosy she was awarded the medal of the Blue Ribbon in 1906 and the order of the Sacred Treasure (sixth class) in 1922. Hannah died on 3 February 1932 at 436 Furushinyashiki, Kumamoto, and was buried in Kumamoto the following day. After her death the hospital was continued under the direction of her niece, Ada Wright, until its closure in 1941.<br>
