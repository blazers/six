<span class="headword">Hildyard,  James</span>  (1809&#150;1887), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born on 11 April 1809 at Winestead in Holderness, Yorkshire, the eighth of ten sons of the Revd William Hildyard, nine of whom became Cambridge graduates and six fellows of their colleges. He was educated under Dr Samuel Butler at Shrewsbury School from 1820 to 1829. From 1826 he was the head of the school, and in April 1829 was the chief person in a rebellion over the boys' diet known as the &#145;Beef Row&#146;. In October of the same year he was entered as a pensioner of Christ's College, Cambridge, where, through the influence of the master, Dr John Kaye, he was at once elected to a Tancred divinity studentship, then worth the large sum of about &pound;113 a year: he was ordained deacon in 1830. Hildyard won a Browne medal in 1830&#150;33, and the members' prize in 1832. In 1833 he graduated BA as senior optime in mathematics, second in the first class of the classical tripos, and second chancellor's medallist, and was immediately elected fellow of his college. He was ordained priest in 1834. In 1840 he became Hebrew lecturer and tutor. He proceeded MA in 1836, and BD in 1846. In 1843 he was senior proctor.<br>
<br>During fourteen years' residence Hildyard became prominent as a university politician who relished acrimonious disagreement. Nevertheless he fought hard to improve the method of college tuition, and wrote more than one pamphlet against the system of private coaching. He wrote and spoke in favour of voluntary theological examinations for ordination candidates. He spent some time on a laborious edition of some of the plays of Plautus, with Latin notes and glossary. For two years, 1843 and 1844, he was Cambridge preacher at the Chapel Royal, Whitehall, when large congregations were present, and a printed selection from his sermons had a rapid sale. About this period he successfully fought the battle of the black gown <i>versus</i> the surplice, his opponent being the Revd Frederick Oakeley, a prominent ritualist who afterwards became a Roman Catholic priest. Hildyard's foreign travels included tours in Greece and Turkey. At Athens he caught a fever, and narrowly escaped being bled to death by King Otho's German physician. In 1846 he married Elizabeth Matilda, only daughter of George Kinderley of Lincoln's Inn, to whom he had been engaged for seven years, and in June of that year accepted the college living of Ingoldsby, Lincolnshire. He found the church and parsonage in a ruinous condition, but in the course of two or three years he restored the church, and built a new rectory at a personal cost of almost &pound;3000. He was always a consistent advocate of the revision of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, and his <span class="italic">Ingoldsby Letters</span> (4th edn, 1879) was an important (if characteristically intemperate) contribution to contemporary debate on the subject. He also published numerous pamphlets and sermons. He died at Ingoldsby rectory on 27 August 1887.<br>
