<span class="headword">Trench, Sir  Frederick William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1777&#150;1859), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was the elder son of Michael Frederick Trench (1746&#150;1836) of Heywood, Ballynakill, Queen's county, and his wife, Anne Helena, daughter and heir of Patrick Stewart of Killymoon, co. Tyrone. Richard Le Poer Trench, second earl of Clancarty, was his third cousin. After attending school in Drogheda, Trench entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1793; he matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, aged nineteen, in 1797, when he also enrolled at Lincoln's Inn.<br>
<br>Commissioned an ensign and lieutenant in the 1st foot guards on 12 November 1803, Trench became lieutenant and captain on 12 November 1807. In the 1806 general election he was returned as member for Mitchell, Cornwall; the patron of the seat, Sir Christopher Hawkins, having sold this and other seats to men pledged to the Grenville administration. Trench vacated his seat, however, in January 1807, and was appointed to the quartermaster-general's staff in Sicily. He also served in the Walcheren expedition in 1809, and at Cadiz, June&#150;August 1811, under Lieutenant-General Thomas Graham; but after being appointed assistant quartermaster-general in the Kent district, and promoted major, he returned to England.<br>
<br>On 21 February 1812 Lord Roden brought Trench into parliament for Dundalk, on the death of the sitting member, but a series of votes by Trench against the administration and his support for Catholic emancipation caused Roden to drop him at the general election in October, whereupon Trench vainly sought Lord Grenville's assistance. On 23 November 1813 he was made deputy quartermaster-general to the expeditionary force sent to the Netherlands under Graham, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel; this was another speedy promotion, but in 1814, when the war ended, he was placed on half pay.<br>
<br>Trench enjoyed the &#145;most affectionate&#146; friendship of the fifth duke of Rutland over a period of fifty-five years, &#145;uninterrupted by one moment of coolness&#146;  (will), until the duke's death in 1857. It was the duke who brought him into the Commons again, on a vacancy at Cambridge in November 1819. He retained the seat until 1832. During this period he appears to have been involved in the Ordnance Survey of Ireland. On 27 May 1825 he was promoted colonel and appointed aide-de-camp to the king. In May 1829 Wellington made him storekeeper of the ordnance in the ministerial reshuffle after Huskisson's resignation, an appointment Mrs Arbuthnot regarded as &#145;so very Tory&#146;  (Bamford and Wellesley, 2.277). He was made KCH in 1832, and was automatically promoted major-general on 10 January 1837, lieutenant-general on 9 November 1846, and general on 25 June 1854.<br>
<br>Although Trench was unsuccessful in contesting Scarborough on the Rutland interest in 1832 Peel, whose &#145;disinterested, and devoted supporter&#146; he avowedly was (BL, Add. MS 40597, fol. 393, 30 Dec 1846), named him secretary to the master-general of the ordnance in his short-lived administration of 1834&#150;5. Trench secured Scarborough in the ensuing general election, held it until 1847, and returned to the Ordnance under Peel's second ministry (1842&#150;6). In the 1842 recess he visited Rome, and in 1845 he toured Spain and Portugal.<br>
<br>Though assiduous in promoting the interests of his Cambridge electors Trench seldom spoke in the Commons and then usually on Irish questions. On 6 April 1827, having performed a <i>volte face</i>, he opposed Catholic emancipation: having been &#145;for years &hellip; a daily witness of the evils which arose from the system pursued by the Irish Catholics&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 2</span>, 17.274), he put forward a policy for Ireland that included the employment of the poor by government, measures for improving agriculture and education, paying the Catholic clergy, and widening the franchise; but he was groaned down. It was, he believed, &#145;the infinite subdivision of land&#146;  (ibid., 18.1421) that caused Ireland's ills. But when in March 1829 Peel and Wellington introduced a Roman Catholic relief bill, Trench's devotion to them compelled him to turn again, and give a reluctant consent. (Similarly in 1844 he supported Peel's Maynooth seminary grant.) Opposing the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> in 1831 as &#145;rash, improvident, and revolutionary&#146;, he defended the character of his Cambridge electors as &#145;persons of opulence and independence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 4.743&#150;6).<br>
<br>Trench made his mark, however, as a self-appointed expert on public architecture, a &#145;Gentleman who fancies Himself a Man of Taste&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 38380, fol. 271). Already in 1815 he had proposed a vast pyramidal monument to British naval and military victories over France (designed by Philip and Matthew Cotes Wyatt) on the site that later became Trafalgar Square. In July 1824 he launched a project for a quay or embankment on the north side of the Thames from Westminster to Blackfriars (again drawn out by Philip Wyatt); despite much criticism in March 1825 he introduced a bill to authorize its construction, but he was checkmated by riverine interests. As a member of a select committee on the design of the new law courts at Westminster early in 1824, Trench employed Philip Wyatt yet again to put on paper his idea, &#145;far more beautiful and extensive&#146; than that of John Soane, the official architect  (Trench). On another committee for the improvement of the Commons' accommodation later in that session he vainly urged a sweeping general plan, but he did secure minor improvements in a revised plan the following year.<br>
<br>Trench was active in Hume's committee for a more commodious Commons in 1831, promoting Benjamin Wyatt's rebuilding proposals. During the same period he joined in the barrage of criticism of Nash's rebuilding of Buckingham Palace, which he proposed converting to a national gallery of art. His hostility to Nash's design had begun in 1825 when he had urged George IV to build, in Hyde Park, a scheme (drawn by Philip Wyatt) that Mrs Arbuthnot (wife of the minister responsible for the crown estate) described as &#145;the worst plan of a house I ever saw, &amp; quite colossal &hellip; It is the most ridiculous plan I ever saw for, added to it, is the idea of a street <i>200 feet</i> <i>wide</i> extending from the end of Hyde Park opposite the New Palace to St Paul's!!&#146;  (Bamford and Wellesley, 1.420). The king expressed his &#145;warmest approbation&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 38380, fol. 172), but the prime minister rebuffed Trench very sharply.<br>
<br>Trench's hour of triumph came some two decades later and was preceded by two further rebuffs. In 1841, when metropolitan improvement was again being debated, he revived his Thames quay scheme, into which he introduced a railway, in an open <span class="italic">Letter to Lord Duncannon</span>, the public works minister; he again urged it on the royal commission of 1844, but with complete lack of success. Likewise his projects for improving Piccadilly and the National Gallery in the early 1840s were stillborn. But his long-maturing design for mounting a giant equestrian statue of the duke of Wellington, sculpted by his old friend Matthew Cotes Wyatt, on the Constitution Hill arch (opposite Apsley House), was (thanks to Lord Melbourne's carelessness and the queen's reluctance to embarrass Wellington) carried out in 1846 with the duke of Rutland's support, despite the opposition of <span class="italic">Punch</span> and the government; there it remained until 1883. Wellington himself, who thought &#145;that it was the damnedest job from the beginning&#146;, was regarded as &#145;a mere cat's-paw of that impudent Irish pretender&#146;  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 1.106).<br>
<br>Trench died unmarried, at 81 Marine Parade, Brighton, on 6 December 1859, about a month after making a will bequeathing his Irish property to the eldest of his four sisters, and over &pound;11,000 in 3 per cent consols to his other relatives; he advised his executors to dispose of his letters &#145;as they may think best, I believe there is no disposal more judicious than the fire&#146;  (will).<br>
