<span class="headword">Menpes,  Mortimer Luddington</span>  (1855&#150;1938), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born &#145;inartisticly&#146;, as he put it himself, on 22 February 1855 in Port Adelaide in South Australia. There he was educated at the grammar school and for a time attended classes at the school of design under John Hood. He was nineteen in 1875 when he arrived in England to continue his studies at the National Art Training School, South Kensington, under Sir Edward Poynter. He took up etching and in 1880 exhibited two drypoints at the Royal Academy exhibition where, over the next twenty years, he exhibited over thirty-five etchings and paintings.<br>
<br>Like Walter Sickert who had enrolled at the same time at the Slade School of Fine Art, London, Menpes was bowled over by his first meeting with James McNeill Whistler: &#145;If you want to see some fun Menpes, come with me.&#146; Completely falling under his spell, Sickert and Menpes by 1881 had become Whistler's studio assistants, and were permitted under his strict guidance to print up a number of etchings. Menpes's own work at this time closely imitated Whistler and together with Sickert they would record a now vanished Chelsea. Whistler was a judge of the Crystal Palace exhibition, so not unnaturally he said, &#145;You have the Gold Medal, Menpes and Du Maurier the Silver&#146;  (Menpes, 29). In 1883&#150;4 Menpes and Sickert travelled with Whistler to St Ives in Cornwall, and Menpes later recorded that invariably Sickert would paint alone whereas Menpes stuck to the master  (ibid., 140). He found himself part of an inner circle whose sole duty was to fight for and protect the master. However, by 1888 Menpes was becoming increasingly critical of Whistler and the relationship began to disintegrate. Menpes, who hated quarrels, recorded, &#145;For Whistler when he forgave at all, forgave completely. All was happiness and sunshine&#146;  (ibid., 153). On 27 April 1875 Menpes had married, at All Souls, Marylebone, Rosa Mary Grosse (<i>d</i>. 1936), and when their youngest child was born in 1887, Whistler, as a gesture of friendship, agreed to be godfather; she was christened Dorothy Whistler Menpes. However, a year later Menpes committed an unpardonable act when he announced he was going to Japan&#151;&#145;Japan was reserved for the &#147;master&#148;&#146;  (ibid., 39). When he returned in 1888 with an exhibition of his drypoints from his Japanese tour at Dowdswell's Gallery, London, Menpes refused to sign himself &#145;Pupil of Whistler&#146;. Whistler, in turn, ignored Menpes completely and resigned from the Royal Society of British Artists after the exhibition.<br>
<br>Outside the Whistler circle, Menpes would have been forgotten but for an article in the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> (1 December 1888) entitled &#145;The home of taste&#146; focusing on Menpes's decoration of his new house at 25 Cadogan Gardens in Kensington which had been built for him by the architect Arthur Heygate Mackmurdo (1851&#150;1942). (Photographs of the interior of the house were included in an article in volume 17 of <span class="italic">The Studio</span>, 1894.) Whistler immediately hammered the final nail into Menpes's professional coffin by referring to him as an &#145;Australian immigrant of Fulham who like the kangaroo of his country is born with a pocket and puts everything in it&#146;  (Menpes, xxiii). The International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers was formed in February 1898 with Whistler elected president. Sickert's and Menpes's names were put forward and answered by a firm &#145;no&#146; from Whistler. Whistler died on 17 July 1903; the funeral took place on 23 July at Chelsea Old Church and Menpes, who had long since been cast in the role of &#145;enemy&#146;, was gracious enough to attend and pay his respects. After all his rejections Menpes repeated plaintively, &#145;Whistler did not mean to hurt me&#151;he was really very fond of me&#146;  (Pocock, 130) and produced as a memorial to their friendship <span class="italic">Whistler as I Knew Him</span> (1904), a long and affectionate memoir, and a series of etched portraits of the stinging butterfly. The Leicester Gallery also gave an exhibition, by way of memorial, of Menpes's personal collection of Whistler drypoints.<br>
<br>Three years before Whistler's death Menpes went out as a war artist to South Africa for the British periodical <span class="italic">Black and White</span>. In 1901 he published <span class="italic">War Impressions</span>, the first of a series of books illustrated in colour from his sketches, with, in most cases, a text written by his daughter Dorothy. The series included <span class="italic">Japan, a Record in Colour</span> (1888, 1901), <span class="italic">France, Spain and Morocco</span> (1893), <span class="italic">World's Children</span> (1903), <span class="italic">The Durbar</span> (1903), <span class="italic">Venice</span> (1904), <span class="italic">India</span> (text by F. A. Steel, 1905), <span class="italic">The Thames</span> (text by G. E. Mitton, 1906), <span class="italic">Paris</span> (1907), <span class="italic">China</span> (text by Sir H. A. Blake, 1909), <span class="italic">The People of India</span> (text by G. E. Mitton, 1910), <span class="italic">Lord Kitchener</span> (1915), and <span class="italic">Lord Roberts</span> (1915). Of his five children, Claude, Walter, Toby, Maudie Rose, and Dorothy, the last married into the Flowers Brewery family and had a son, Richard, born in 1910. A pastel portrait of Richard was drawn by Menpes in 1916.<br>
<br>During 1907 Menpes founded the Menpes Fruit Farm Co. at Pangbourne in Berkshire where he lived in his house, Iris Court, until his death there on 1 April 1938.<br>
<br>Menpes's obituary refers to him as a &#145;painter, etcher, raconteur and rifle shot&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 April 1938). He described his early life as that of a &#145;rolling stone, travelling all over the world in record time, being unsurpassed even by Jules Verne and that as a result of meeting Whistler he had cultivated some of his mannerisms&#146;.<br>
