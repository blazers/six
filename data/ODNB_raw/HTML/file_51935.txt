<span class="headword">Cory, Sir  George Edward</span>  (1862&#150;1935), <span class="occ">chemist and historian</span>, was born on 3 June 1862 at 9 Palatine Place, Stoke Newington, London, the son of George Nicholas Cory and his wife, Susannah Emma Flowers. His father followed a variety of occupations and never settled long in one place. Cory's early schooling was consequently fragmentary, and at the age of thirteen he was put to work. During the next few years he employed all his spare time in studying, using popular manuals and self-educators, and in 1879 he entered St John's College, Hurstpierpoint, where he remained for three years. He then went to work for Sir William Siemens at Woolwich, where he was engaged first in testing transatlantic cables, and then in electric lighting; he helped to install the first arc lamps in London, at the Savoy opera-house.<br>
<br>With the aim of resuming his academic studies, in 1884 Cory began teaching at St John's College, and moved subsequently to Northwich grammar school, and then to a private school in Cambridge. In 1886 he became a non-collegiate student and attended university lectures for the science tripos (in chemistry, physics, and anatomy), taking his BA two years later and an MA in 1892. He was admitted to King's College in 1888, and was university demonstrator in chemistry (1888&#150;91). He was elected a fellow of the Chemical Society and began to study for a medical degree, but never completed it.<br>
<br>In 1891 Cory went to South Africa to take up the post of vice-principal of Grahamstown public school. He became public analyst for the Eastern Province, and in 1894 was appointed lecturer (later professor) in chemistry at St Andrew's College, Grahamstown, where he designed a new laboratory. In 1904 he became the first professor of chemistry at the newly founded Rhodes University College, Grahamstown. In 1895 he married, in South Africa, Gertrude Blades, the second daughter of C. M. Blades, the public analyst for Northwich, Cheshire. They had three sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Cory's strong interest in the history of the Eastern Province&#151;where the first British settlers had arrived in 1820&#151;soon grew into a systematic research programme, displacing any chemical studies and becoming his life's work. He interviewed elderly settlers and native African chiefs, photographed historical sites, and sought out collections of historical documents housed throughout the region. The work, aided by financial support from the estate of Cecil Rhodes and from the Union government, was eventually published in six volumes entitled <span class="italic">The Rise of South Africa</span> (5 vols., London, 1910&#150;30; vol. 6, Cape Town, 1940). Cory also edited the diary of the Revd Francis Owen, an early missionary (1926).<br>
<br>Cory earned wide recognition as a historian. He was awarded an honorary DLitt from Cambridge in 1921, and in the following year he was knighted for services to science and literature. He visited England in 1922, when he was elected a fellow of the Royal Historical Society. He was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Empire Society in 1933. A cheerful and kindly man, he presented a somewhat dishevelled appearance, and enjoyed singing, walking, and bowls. He was known as a vivid speaker and a good teacher.<br>
<br>In 1925 Cory retired from Rhodes University College where&#151;despite his historical interests&#151;he was still professor of chemistry. He was then appointed professor emeritus. He was subsequently also appointed as honorary archivist to the Union government of South Africa, and moved to Cape Town, where he worked daily at the Cape Archives until shortly before his death in Cape Town on 28 April 1935.<br>
