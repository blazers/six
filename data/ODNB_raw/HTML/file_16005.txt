<span class="headword">Lang,  John Dunmore</span>  (1799&#150;1878), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and politician in Australia</span>, was born on 25 August 1799 at Greenock, Renfrewshire, the eldest of the four children of William Lang (1768?&#150;1830), a small landowner, and Mary Dunmore (1770&#150;1844). He was educated for the ministry at the Largs parish school (1807/8&#150;1811) and the University of Glasgow (MA 1820, DD 1825), and was licensed to preach in 1820. In 1823 he emigrated to be the first Presbyterian minister in Sydney.<br>
<br>The following year Lang made the first of nine visits to Britain, seeking government support for colonial education, recruiting clergy and schoolmasters, and promoting migration to Australia. On his second visit he married a cousin, Wilhelmina Mackie (1812&#150;1891), on 25 August 1831. The marriage was happy and in all his controversies Lang was comforted by a warmly harmonious family life, though this was marred by tragedies involving his children; of ten five died in infancy.<br>
<br>In 1833&#150;4 Lang again returned to Britain. As always on voyages, he wrote&#151;this time <span class="italic">An Historical and Statistical Account of New South Wales</span> (1834). Revised editions appeared in 1837, 1852, and 1875. In 1835 he commenced a weekly, <span class="italic">The Colonist</span>, which ran until 1840. The <span class="italic">Colonial Observer</span> (1841&#150;4) and <span class="italic">The Press</span> (1851) were also Lang papers. Lang next visited Britain in 1836&#150;7. In 1832 he had formed the presbytery of New South Wales with other ministers, all of whom he had recruited. Too many were over-fond of the bottle and most of the others were unwilling to prosecute their fellows. Lang determined to enrol sufficient new clergy to outvote the backsliders and their abetters. He obtained twelve Presbyterian clergymen and, in Germany, three Lutheran missionaries and ten lay assistants.<br>
<br>Back in Sydney, Lang imprudently and schismatically established a new church court instead of relying on the increased numbers in the presbytery of New South Wales to discipline the delinquent ministers. On his next visit to Britain the rival courts combined to form the synod of Australia, which Lang joined on his return in 1841. But he was quickly affronted when it criticized his ministry, and he abandoned it, denouncing it as &#145;a mere synagogue of Satan&#146;. He also renounced his government stipend, convinced that state support of religion produced a multitude of evils. He could do so because his congregation at the Scots Church was perhaps as large and wealthy as all other Presbyterian congregations combined.<br>
<br>In June 1843 Lang was elected to the legislative council, beginning a parliamentary career that lasted until 1869. He was elected to the legislature seven times, three times topping the poll, and defeated only once.<br>
<br>In 1846 Lang again sailed for Britain to promote emigration. His continual theme for the next three years in books, pamphlets, lectures, and newspaper articles was that the grinding poverty of Britain could be relieved by the boundless opportunities in Australia. He proposed that reputable migrants who paid their own fares receive a grant of crown land. Prolonged correspondence and interviews at the Colonial Office failed to secure this concession, which was in fact illegal. Lang nevertheless recklessly arranged for about 270 migrants to sail in the <i>Fortitude</i> in September 1848, promising them they would receive free land in proportion to their passage money. By a dishonest manoeuvre he then vainly tried to trick the colonial governor into granting the migrants land on their arrival. He thus destroyed his reputation with the Colonial Office and saved it with the Australian public at large only by blustering falsehoods. Despite this fiasco, Lang dispatched six vessels with more than 1200 migrants before he returned to Australia in 1850.<br>
<br>In lectures in Sydney in April 1850 Lang declared that Australia should at once become a republic. He believed strongly in local self-government and abhorred the aristocratic influences in English society and politics. He set out his arguments in pamphlets and two large, learned books, <span class="italic">Freedom and Independence for the Golden Lands of Australia</span> (1852, 1857) and <span class="italic">The Coming Event! or, Freedom and Independence for the Seven United Provinces of Australia</span> (1870).<br>
<br>In 1851 Lang falsely accused a political opponent of dishonesty and, though he apologized for his error, was convicted of malicious libel and sentenced to four months' gaol. In 1855, when greatly provoked, in a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Convicts' Bank</span>, he charged a prominent banker with &#145;malice prepense of the foulest character imaginable &hellip; and a degree of low-bred brutal malignity worthy only of an incarnate demon&#146;. That was criminal libel and it earned Lang six months in gaol, which he spent comfortably in the residence of the gaol's governor.<br>
<br>In 1850 Lang had established the synod of New South Wales with ministers he had enlisted on his recent visit to Britain. He then settled them throughout the colony. In 1865 this synod joined in the general Presbyterian union, which combined the Free Churchmen with those supporting the established Church of Scotland.<br>
<br>From 1874 Lang suffered several small strokes, but they did little to hinder his activities, and he made a strenuous round-the-world journey in 1874&#150;5. He died, after a massive stroke, on 8 August 1878 at the Australian College, Jamison Street, Sydney. He was accorded a state funeral on 10 August, and was buried at the Devonshire Street cemetery.<br>
<br>Above all, Lang was a Presbyterian minister. Yet he cooperated willingly with other protestant clergymen, especially Baptists and Congregationalists, often more cordially than with fellow Presbyterians. Always parading as an upright man, he frequently condemned the sins of those in public life, including the fornication of Governor FitzRoy. Many hundreds of the poor, the homeless, and the bereaved remained deeply grateful to him as benefactor and friend. His achievements in promoting education and immigration bear comparison with those of any of his contemporaries but would have been much greater had his intense inner drive not been compounded with an equal impulse to castigate opponents or even those merely lukewarm towards his designs. His long parliamentary career included many electoral triumphs and he witnessed the achievement of almost all his political aims: the end of transportation, the separation of Victoria and Queensland, the introduction of responsible and democratic government, radical land reform, national education, and the abolition of state aid to religion.<br>
<br>In addition to his larger books, Lang published more than a hundred polemical, religious, or political pamphlets, and almost every day, it seems, he wrote an article for the press or at least a letter to the editor. His writings, though repetitious and egotistical, are nevertheless always vigorous and informative and often tinged with powerful sarcasm. These, together with innumerable lectures given in Sydney or in the bush on his never-ending colonial journeyings, must have had a large influence in inculcating the liberal and secular values which were dominant in Australia by the end of the nineteenth century.<br>
