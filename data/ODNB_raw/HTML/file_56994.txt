<span class="headword">Powys,  Llewelyn</span>  (1884&#150;1939), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 13 August 1884 at Rothesay House, South Walks, Dorchester, the fifth son and eighth child among the eleven children of Revd Charles Francis Powys (1843&#150;1923), vicar of Montacute, Somerset, and his wife, Mary Cowper Johnson (1849&#150;1914). His mother was the daughter of the Revd William Cowper Johnson of Yaxham, Norfolk, who was related to the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6513/', "William Cowper (1731&#150;1800)")</script>. Llewelyn Powys's elder brothers were the novelists <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35598/', "John Cowper Powys (1872&#150;1963)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40705/', "Theodore Francis Powys (1875&#150;1953)")</script>. Llewelyn Powys was educated first at Sherborne preparatory school (1895&#150;9) and then at Sherborne School, Dorset (1899&#150;1903), before he went on to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (1903&#150;6). At none of these places did he show an aptitude for scholarship. He was a slow starter, and his personality, indulged by his older sisters and brothers, responded mainly to nature, companionship, and passing pleasures. This was shown in the cultivation, at Cambridge, of important early friendships, such as that with Louis Wilkinson, and with his founding of an epicurean society, the Club of the Honest Cods, in 1904. But it also resulted in his &#145;ploughing&#146; the Cambridge tripos and having to re-sit the finals for a pass BA degree in November 1906.<br>
<br>On leaving Cambridge, Powys drifted rather forlornly into schoolmastering, first at Broadstairs and then at Bromsgrove (1907), before becoming a private tutor to a family at Calne, Wiltshire (1908) (which he described in <span class="italic">Confessions of Two Brothers</span>). Partly to release him from the drudgery of an uncongenial profession, his brother John arranged for him to visit America on a lecturing programme in December 1908. Here he spoke on the English poets and on some contemporary writers in Philadelphia and in New York state for four months, but was ill-equipped to cope with the task. He returned disheartened to school teaching at Sherborne preparatory school (1909), where his brother Littleton had become headmaster.<br>
<br>On 3 November 1909 the direction of Llewelyn Powys's life suddenly changed when he suffered a serious haemorrhage due to contracting pulmonary tuberculosis. In December he was sent to Clavadel sanatorium, Davos Platz, Switzerland, where he remained for sixteen months. In addition to combating his illness, he had the leisure to read extensively and to cultivate the writing skills which he needed to fulfil his ambition to be a writer. His admired brother John encouraged him in this pursuit, and Powys began to keep a diary which became a remarkable testament to his life's struggle at this time, and a quarry for some of his later writing.<br>
<br>On returning to England, Llewelyn Powys spent a summer and autumn of recuperation at the family home at Montacute and with his brother Theodore at East Chaldon, Dorset (a period about which he wrote revealingly in <span class="italic">Skin for Skin</span>). A return to Switzerland in early 1912 brought on a further haemorrhage when Powys unwisely walked over a mountain pass between Arosa and Davos, but he recovered sufficiently to return to England in March. Here, in convalescence in the summer and winter of 1912&#150;13, he began writing in earnest &#145;for the papers&#146;&#151;mostly stories and vignettes in the style of Guy de Maupassant, the first of which to be published was &#145;Death&#146; in the <span class="italic">New Age</span> in April 1913.<br>
<br>In 1914, after his mother's death and to help his recovery from consumption, Powys travelled to join his brother William on his farm in the East Africa Protectorate. However, with the outbreak of the First World War and his brother volunteering to fight, he was left to manage a stock ranch, and so remained in Africa for the duration of the war. In 1916 he published <span class="italic">Confessions of Two Brothers</span>, which was written with John and in which Llewelyn's section consisted of short autobiographical fragments.<br>
<br>After the war Powys returned to England for a year and then sailed for America, where he spent another five years, mostly in New York but also in California. He gained a considerable reputation between 1921 and 1924 on the east coast, through his journalism and book reviews for periodicals such as <span class="italic">The Dial</span>, <span class="italic">The Freeman</span>, and <span class="italic">The Mentor</span>, as well as for notable New York newspapers such as the <span class="italic">New York Evening Post</span> where he wrote vividly about his experiences in Africa. <span class="italic">Ebony and Ivory</span>, his first book, containing some of the early stories of 1912&#150;13, came out in America in 1923, with <span class="italic">Black Laughter</span>, which made his name there, following in 1924.<br>
<br>On 30 September 1924 Llewelyn Powys married Alyse Gregory (1884&#150;1967), the managing editor of <span class="italic">The Dial</span>, and returned with her to England and to a coastguard cottage on a Dorset headland called the White Nothe near Weymouth. There were no children. Powys published the autobiographical <span class="italic">Skin for Skin</span> in 1925 and <span class="italic">The Verdict of Bridlegoose</span>, about his experiences in America, in 1926. In 1927 Powys and Gregory briefly returned to New York, where Powys was appointed visiting critic of the <span class="italic">New York Herald Tribune</span> (books section) for a four-month period, at a time when his reputation in America was at its height. He also began an affair with the poet Gamel Woolsey (1895&#150;1968), which resulted in a miscarried pregnancy. Powys's letters to Woolsey were published as <span class="italic">So Wild a Thing</span> in 1973; her letters to him were published in 1983.<br>
<br>After returning briefly to England, Powys and Gregory travelled through Europe to Palestine. In consequence of this visit Powys, who for most of his life was an anti-Christian rationalist, wrote three books of religious observation, including <span class="italic">The Cradle of God</span> (1929), a survey of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, and <span class="italic">The Pathetic Fallacy</span> (1930), a &#145;study of Christianity&#146;. The culmination of this period was <span class="italic">Impassioned Clay</span> (1931), a philosophical meditation on the origin and purpose of the human condition, which Powys always regarded as one of his most important works. While Powys was brought up in the Christian faith he spent much of his life rejecting its tenets. He was a convinced agnostic and humanist who nevertheless believed in a cosmic &#145;mystery&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1931 Powys and Gregory travelled in the West Indies, but for much of the 1930s Powys was ill with recurring bouts of blood-spitting and digestive disorders. In 1931 he and his wife moved to Chydyok, a cottage on the Lulworth estate between East Chaldon and the sea, next door to Powys's sisters, Gertrude, a painter, and Philippa, a poet. In December 1936 they travelled to Clavadel, Switzerland, for a last bid to save his health. In these years Powys was a prolific writer of essays and articles for local and national papers, on country themes, literary by-ways, and rationalist thought. Some of these were collected in books such as <span class="italic">Dorset Essays</span> (1935), <span class="italic">Somerset Essays</span> (1937), and <span class="italic">Rats in the Sacristy</span> (1937). In Switzerland he continued with this intensive output of work, composing lovingly recalled reminiscences of his Somerset childhood, in the collection <span class="italic">A Baker's Dozen</span> (1939), and re-imagining his early life in a quasi-autobiographical novel, <span class="italic">Love and Death</span> (1939), which drew on his affair with Woolsey.<br>
<br>On 2 December 1939 Llewelyn Powys died in Clavadel of a burst duodenal ulcer, and was cremated in Davos. After the Second World War his ashes were brought back to Dorset and buried on the cliffs above the sea near Chydyok. In 1949 a stone was erected over the ashes, carved by the sculptor Elizabeth Muntz, with wording from <span class="roman">Isaiah</span>, &#145;The Living. The Living. He Shall Praise Thee&#146;.<br>
