<span class="headword">MacCurtin,  Hugh</span> <span class="st"> [Aodh Bu&iacute; Mac Cruit&iacute;n]</span>  (1680?&#150;1755), <span class="occ">poet and antiquary</span>, was born near Liscannor in the parish of Kilmacrehy, co. Clare. Nothing is known of his immediate family except that his father was named Conchobhar &Oacute;g Mac Cruit&iacute;n. The MacCurtins were one of the hereditary learned families of medieval Irish society and acted as antiquaries to the O'Briens, lords of Thomond, from the fourteenth century, a role which had evolved into that of scribes and notaries by the seventeenth century. MacCurtin was educated locally, at least partly in the school run by Andrew MacCurtin, a relative and fellow poet.<br>
<br>Some fifty poems by Hugh MacCurtin are extant. His corpus includes encomiastic verse addressed to patrons and written in the obsolescent syllabic metres employed by the professional bards of earlier centuries; Jacobite verse written in the stressed metres of popular song and intended for a mass audience; and a small number of works dealing with more personal themes. MacCurtin worked as a scribe and teacher, and there is evidence to suggest that the prominent patriot Charles Lucas may have been one of his pupils. His early compositions include laments for Daniel O'Brien, fourth Viscount Clare, and Charles O'Brien, fifth Viscount Clare, two brothers who were successive colonels of the <i>r&eacute;giment de Clare</i>, an Irish regiment in the French service. A poem which denounced those who took an oath abjuring the Pretender (James Francis Edward Stuart) probably dates from 1709. MacCurtin married and had at least two daughters, but the poem beginning &#145;<i>Is trua do ch&aacute;s a shuaircbhean bhre&aacute;</i>&#146; suggests that the marriage was not a success. Addressed to an unnamed woman, it expresses the poet's sorrow that he must leave her and return to &#145;three women&#146; in co. Clare, presumably his wife and two daughters.<br>
<br>By 1713 MacCurtin had moved to Dublin where he found employment copying and translating Irish manuscripts. His patrons there included William Hawkins, Ulster king of arms; the Revd Anthony Raymond, an aspiring historian and friend of Jonathan Swift; and Aaron Crossly, author of <span class="italic">The Peerage of Ireland</span> (1724). While in Dublin, MacCurtin associated with the literary circle grouped around the poet and schoolmaster Tadhg &Oacute; Neachtain, and published his first book, <span class="italic">A Brief Discourse in Vindication of the Antiquity of Ireland</span> (1717), which is little more than an abridged translation of Geoffrey Keating's <span class="italic">Foras Feasa ar &Eacute;irinn</span>. MacCurtin was imprisoned about this time and, in 1749, Charles Lucas alleged that the detention was a consequence of the trenchant criticism of Sir Richard Cox's <span class="italic">Hibernia Anglicana</span> contained in MacCurtin's <span class="italic">Discourse</span>. This seems unlikely since Cox, a leading tory, was out of favour with government after 1715, and the large number of prominent Jacobites whose names appeared on MacCurtin's list of subscribers may have been a more relevant factor.<br>
<br>MacCurtin had returned to co. Clare by 1721, but in 1724 he composed a lament on the death of Edmund Byrne, Roman Catholic archbishop of Dublin, at the request of Tadhg &Oacute; Neachtain. What is arguably his best known poem, <span class="italic">&#145;Ar aonach m&aacute; th&eacute;id sin ar uair de l&oacute;&#146;</span>, a satire on the social pretensions of ignorant but newly prosperous peasants, also seems to date from the 1720s. MacCurtin left Ireland about 1727 and travelled to the Irish Franciscan college at Louvain where his second book, <span class="italic">The Elements of the Irish Language Grammatically Explained in English</span>, was published in 1728. This is a work of considerable scholarship, but it is clear that MacCurtin drew heavily from an unpublished manuscript grammar by Francis Walsh.<br>
<br>MacCurtin crossed into France later in 1728 and enlisted in the <i>r&eacute;giment de Clare</i>, a unit which contained many soldiers from his native county. A work composed during his period of military service, <span class="italic">&#145;Is grinn an tsollamhain ch&iacute;m f&eacute;n Nollaig seo&#146;</span>, anticipates a French invasion of Britain and the execution of George II. After his discharge in 1729 he proceeded to Paris where he assisted Conchobhar &Oacute; Beaglaoich with the preparation of <span class="italic">The English Irish Dictionary</span>, the first dictionary of its kind, which was published in 1731. It is likely that MacCurtin's assistance in the preparation of the dictionary was largely clerical, but he contributed an initial dedicatory poem. He appears to have remained in France until 1739 when he returned to co. Clare.<br>
<br>MacCurtin spent his final years as a schoolteacher in his native parish of Kilmacrehy and appears to have written little after 1745. He died in 1755 and is variously reported to have been interred in Kilmacrehy churchyard, and in Kilvoydane churchyard, near Corrofin, co. Clare. The latter may be the more likely resting place as his daughters were living nearby in 1761.<br>
