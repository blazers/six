<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stewart family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1110&#150;<em>c.</em>1350), <span class="occ">nobility</span>, traced its descent from <a name="cosubject_26510"></a><span class="headword">Walter Fitzalan</span>  (<em>c.</em>1110&#150;1177)<span class="occ"></span>, third son of Alan son of Flaald, a favoured supporter of Henry I, who was descended from the hereditary stewards of Dol in Brittany. Walter's elder brother William was lord of Oswestry and Clun in Shropshire, and ancestor of the Fitzalans who were later earls of Arundel. Walter entered the service of David I, king of Scots, about 1136, and towards the end of David's reign became the king's <i>dapifer</i>, or steward, an office which was to be held heritably. Walter was granted extensive lands by the Scottish king and his grandson Malcolm IV (<i>r</i>. 1153&#150;65): Renfrew, with the district later to become Renfrewshire, the northern half of Kyle (the central portion of Ayrshire), together with sizeable estates in Berwickshire, Roxburghshire, and Haddingtonshire. On these lands Walter and his immediate descendants settled knights and other military fief-holders recruited from the Welsh border country where the Fitzalans were well established. The head of the family, from Walter Fitzalan's time onward, became one of the most powerful barons of the Scottish kingdom, a position symbolized by the Stewarts' possession of Renfrew Castle and burgh and by their building Dundonald Castle and founding the Cluniac priory (later abbey) of Paisley.<br>
<br>Walter died in 1177, his heir, from his marriage to Eschina, evidently of a family native to southern Scotland, being Alan [<a name="cosubject_58280"></a><span class="headword">Alan son of Walter</span>  (<em>c.</em>1150&#150;1204)<span class="occ"></span>], who served William the Lion (<i>r</i>. 1165&#150;1214) as <i>dapifer</i> until his death in 1204 and whose daughter Avelina married Duncan, sometime earl of Carrick. Alan added the Isle of Bute to the family lands, probably building the first castle of Rothesay. <a name="cosubject_58281"></a><span class="headword">Walter son of Alan</span>  (<em>c.</em>1198&#150;1241)<span class="occ"></span>, was the third hereditary steward and adopted the more dignified title <i>senescallus</i> on reaching his majority <i>c</i>.1219. He was a considerable benefactor of Paisley Abbey and held office as justiciar of Scotia (that is, Scotland north of Forth) between 1232 and 1241. A close alliance between the families of Stewart and Bruce, lords of Annandale, may be traced from Walter's time and continued until the early fourteenth century. Both his sons played a prominent part in the national life of mid-thirteenth-century Scotland. The elder, <a name="cosubject_58282"></a><span class="headword">Alexander of Dundonald</span>  (<em>c.</em>1220&#150;1282)<span class="occ"></span>, held the stewardship from 1241 until about the time of his death. He seems to have commanded the armed force which, at Largs, in October 1263, successfully defended Scotland against attempted invasion by H&aacute;kon IV, king of Norway. It seems to have been in Alexander's time that the Stewarts acquired the lordship of Cowal, with a castle at Dunoon. Moreover, the style <i>senescallus</i> <i>Scotie</i>, &#145;stewart of Scotland&#146;, now replaced the older <i>dapifer regis Scotie</i>, &#145;steward of the king of Scotland&#146;, thus indicating a major office of state, significant in a national context.<br>
<br>Walter's younger son, <a name="cosubject_58283"></a><span class="headword">Walter  Bulloch Stewart</span>, earl of Menteith  (1225<span class="mult">x</span>30&#150;<em>c.</em>1293)<span class="occ"></span>, whose epithet came from the Gaelic <i>ballach</i>, &#145;freckled&#146;, married Mary, possibly daughter of Murdoch (Maurice) the elder, who had held the earldom of Menteith until 1213, when he had resigned it into the hands of King William, who granted it to Murdoch the younger, the previous earl's brother. In the 1230s the earldom was inherited by the younger Murdoch's daughter Isabel, who married Walter Comyn, recognized as earl in right of his wife. In 1260 the Countess Isabel, widowed since 1258, was deprived of the earldom, which was bestowed by Alexander III on Mary and Walter Bulloch. Earl Walter was the first member of the family to adopt <i>senescallus</i>, Stewart, as a surname, despite not holding the office personally. After his time it was normal for younger sons and their own direct descendants to use this surname. Alexander of Dundonald, to judge from a Paisley Abbey charter, evidently made the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela; his oldest surviving son was baptized James, hitherto an uncommon personal name in Scotland. <a name="cosubject_26476"></a><span class="headword">James Stewart</span>  (<em>c.</em>1260&#150;1309)<span class="occ"></span>, the fifth stewart, was in the forefront of Scottish politics throughout his tenure of the stewardship, as councillor under Alexander III, as one of the six guardians elected by the magnates after the king's death in 1286, as a supporter of Robert (V) de Brus (known as the Competitor) when he made his claim to the Scottish throne in 1291, as sheriff of Ayr and intended sheriff of a wide area of south Argyll under King John's abortive scheme of 1293, as negotiator of peace terms with Edward I in 1296, as a principal leader in the independence struggle between 1297 and 1304, and finally as a supporter of Robert Bruce (the Competitor's grandson) when he was made king in 1306. He married Egidia (Gelis), a sister of Richard de Burgh, earl of Ulster, and with her he acquired a landed estate near Coleraine. His younger brother, Sir John Stewart of Jedburgh, married the heir to the barony of Bunkle in Berwickshire and was ancestor of the Stewarts of Bunkle. Sir John commanded the Scottish archers under Wallace at the battle of Falkirk (1298), and was killed there with all his men.<br>
<br>James Stewart died on 16 July 1309, leaving as heir a younger son, <a name="cosubject_26511"></a><span class="headword">Sir Walter Stewart</span>  (<em>c.</em>1296&#150;1327)<span class="occ"></span>, who commanded one of the four Scottish brigades at Bannockburn in 1314, after which battle he was knighted. A year later Walter was given the eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3754/', "Robert I")</script>, <a name="cosubject_39581"></a><span class="headword">Marjorie Bruce</span>  (<em>c.</em>1296&#150;1316)<span class="occ"></span>, in marriage, a union which brings out the extent to which, along with James, lord of Douglas, Thomas Randolph, earl of Moray, and John of Menteith (a younger son of <a href="#cosubject_58283">Walter Stewart, earl of Menteith [<i>see above</i>]</a>), Walter Stewart had become one of the closest counsellors and most highly trusted and favoured supporters of Robert I. He took a leading part in the Scots' recovery of Berwick upon Tweed (1318) and in a successful defence of the town against the determined onslaught of Edward II's forces in 1319. In December 1318 Walter was present in parliament when the succession to the throne was entailed upon his son Robert (born probably on 2 March 1316), failing male heirs of Robert I's body. His name appears immediately after those of the earls at the head of the famous letter addressed to Pope John XXII in April 1320 by the nobles of Scotland (the declaration of Arbroath). When Robert I's son, David II, having reigned for over half a century and been married twice, died childless in 1371, Robert Stewart duly succeeded, as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23713/', "King Robert II")</script>. Walter Stewart died at Bathgate Castle, Linlithgowshire, on 9 April 1327.<br>
