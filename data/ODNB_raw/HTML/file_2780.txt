<span class="headword">Bois,  John</span>  (1561&#150;1644), <span class="occ">biblical translator</span>, was born on 3 January 1561 at Nettlestead, Suffolk, the only child to live to adulthood of William Bois (1513?&#150;1591), rector of West Stow, Suffolk, and his wife, Mirabel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pooley (<i>c</i>.1513&#150;<i>c</i>.1601). William Bois, an early protestant and a scholar (he was a foundation fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge), who originated in Yorkshire, gave his son an ideal start as a <span class="roman">Bible</span> scholar. By five John Bois had read his <span class="roman">Bible</span> through, by six he could write Hebrew, and he learnt Greek. Home education was supplemented by the grammar school at Hadleigh, Suffolk, whose master, John Still, was also master of St John's College, Cambridge. Still was probably influential in Bois's being admitted to St John's aged fourteen. Bois records that he was admitted on 12 November 1575, but also that his parents sent him to Cambridge on 27 February, presumably 1576, and that he was admitted on 1 March; he had matriculated in the Easter term of 1575. Andrew Downes, fellow of the college and regius professor of Greek, delighted in his knowledge of Greek and gave him special tuition in the most demanding Greek authors. After six months Bois was chosen as a scholar, and he it was who composed Greek epistles for various college occasions. He graduated BA early in 1579, and in 1581, aged twenty, he was elected fellow. Though he had smallpox at the time, Downes and his tutor carried Bois in his sickbed to be admitted, almost costing him his life but ensuring he lost no seniority. He proceeded MA in 1582.<br>
<br>Bois thought of studying medicine but, imagining he had every disease of which he read, gave it up. Yet his constitution was strong. He often walked the 20 miles from college to his mother's house for dinner, reading as he walked if he fell in with tedious company. Throughout his life he was careful of his health. He picked and rubbed his teeth so assiduously that, in his biographer Anthony Walker's phrase, &#145;he carried to his grave almost an Hebrew alphabet of teeth&#146;  (Allen, 147), that is, about two-thirds of his teeth. He ate only dinner and supper, with nothing in between except occasional aqua vitae and sugar for wind, and would allow an hour or more for digestion, either sitting or walking. Following three precepts for health from William Whittaker, a master of St John's for whom he wrote a funeral oration, he always studied standing, never studied in a window, and never went to bed with cold feet.<br>
<br>If health was a fetish, study was a passion. Bois frequently worked from four in the morning until eight at night in the university library; even in old age he studied eight hours a day. Elected lecturer (praelector) on 2 January 1582 and Greek lecturer on 4 November 1588 (re-elected 1590, 1593, and 1595), he proceeded BTh in 1590 and was appointed principal lecturer on 4 July 1595. He supplemented normal teaching with a voluntary 4 a.m. lecture in his chambers. He became a thoroughly dutiful senior dean (appointed on 11 December 1593), and when a senior fellow (from 11 June 1593) he initiated the practice of moderating after set speeches. The college gave him &pound;100 when he left for a life in the church and marriage.<br>
<br>Bois's career in the church was, like the man, modest. He was ordained deacon at Norwich on Friday 21 June 1588, and priest by dispensation the following day. When his father died in 1591, his mother wished to stay at West Stow, so, through the patronage of her brother, Bois took the living, but resigned it when she went to live with the brother. By this time one Holt, rector of Boxworth, some 6 miles from Cambridge, had died, providing a dowry and a spouse for one of his daughters (her name is lost). He gave her the patronage of the living, and requested some friends that, &#145;if it might be by them procured, Mr Bois of St John's might become his successor by the marriage of his daughter&#146;  (Allen, 137). Bois and Miss Holt, it seems, had not met. Bois was instituted to the living on 13 October 1596 and married Holt's daughter on 7 February 1597 or 1598.<br>
<br>Bois's exemplary conduct as rector and from 25 August 1615 as a prebend of Ely is fully described by Walker. He prayed that he might live only so long as he could preach, and serve God and his people as minister. Taking nothing but his <span class="roman">Bible</span> into the pulpit, his ambition was always to be understood by all. Although he published nothing of his own, he remained a scholar and a teacher. At Boxworth he established a weekly study circle with eleven or twelve other ministers. He usually kept a scholar to help with his children's education and that of the poorer local children, and he took in children of gentlemen as boarders and students.<br>
<br>Bois's lasting claim to fame is that he alone of the men who worked on the King James <span class="roman">Bible</span> made notes on some of the discussions. Though some of the Cambridge fellows were jealous, thinking they needed no help from the country, Bois was appointed in 1604 to the second Cambridge company to work on the <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span>. His old mentor, Downes, was also a member. Walker, who had his information from Bois but is not wholly reliable, thought parts were done individually. Bois, he writes, &#145;showed me the very copy he translated by&#146;, and adds, &#145;but, to my grief, I know not which part&#146;  (Allen, 139). At this time Bois spent six days a week at St John's and one in his parish. He undertook a second part, presumably of the <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span>, this time having commons in another college. By the end of 1608 James I was hurrying the work to a conclusion. The Cambridge, Oxford, and Westminster companies each sent a copy of their work to London, and their delegates reviewed the work. Bois and Downes went from Cambridge, probably as representatives of the <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span> group, though Walker writes that they were the only two to go from Cambridge and that they met with &#145;four fellow labourers&#146;. Bois's priceless notes were long thought lost, but a copy was discovered in Corpus Christi College Library (MS CCC 312, Fulman collection). A second copy was found in the British Library (Harley MS 750); this, though in some ways inferior because of weaknesses of the copyist, appears to be a copy of Bois's original, and shows that the Fulman manuscript was a copy of a copy.<br>
<br>Bois was always a note taker and maker. After hearing a sermon, for instance, he would note the date, text, and preacher and much of the content. His notes of the discussions have the same qualities and are personal memoranda on nearly 500 points in the epistles and <span class="roman">Revelation</span>: the text at issue is recorded and the discussion of it summarized with occasional references to his own views if they differed from those of his colleagues. They reveal the highly scholarly nature of discussions which characteristically focused on the meaning of the original. His interest is always in the problem rather than the eventual solution adopted for the English of the 1611 <span class="roman">Bible</span>.<br>
<br>The notes contain frequent references to St John Chrysostom. Both Bois and Downes contributed extensively to Sir Henry Savile's multi-volume edition of Chrysostom, and the page references in the notes show that they were made after the publication of the 1610 volume and before the publication of the 1611 volume. Sadly, the work on Chrysostom led to an estrangement between Downes and Bois. Downes, by now a cantankerous old man, thought Savile preferred Bois's work to his own and remained unreconciled with his former pupil at his death.<br>
<br>In 1628 Bois moved to Ely, though he retained the living of Boxworth until 1636. The following year he became rector of Thorpe Parva. His marriage was not always smooth. Bois left money matters to his wife and unawares found himself in debt. To clear this, he sold at great loss &#145;his darling&#146;, his library. Perhaps because of this there was strife between the two of them and he was rumoured to have thought of going overseas. Although his wife's temper was not always the best, things mended, and at her death on 16 May 1642 Bois described her as his &#145;dearest wife, with whom, in blameless marriage, I have lived five and forty years and more&#146;. They had four sons and three daughters; the second son, John, and oldest daughter he saw married, the latter, Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1599, <i>d</i>. 1638), to William Walker, father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68212/', "Anthony Walker (bap. 1622, d. 1692)")</script>.<br>
<br>Bois's inclination for fame was as slight as his learning was great. In his will of 6 June 1643 (copied in Walker's manuscript) he was most careful of his books and papers. Some borrowed books were to be returned with his apologies for having filled their margins with annotations. His own books and papers were to be &#145;skilfully regarded &amp; duely looked unto&#146;. Among the papers was an incomplete collation of commentaries intended to have covered the whole <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, eventually published in 1655 as <span class="italic">Veteris interpretis cum Beza aliisque recentioribus collatio in quatuor evangeliis, &amp; Apostolorum Actis</span>. Of sums totalling &pound;244 in his will, &pound;80 went to the poor of Boxworth and Ely, and &pound;20 to reparation of the church at Boxworth. Bois's youngest daughter, Anne, already had &pound;500 following her mother's death. Bois died at Ely on 14 January 1644 and was buried there on 6 February. Of his children, only John and Anne survived him.<br>
