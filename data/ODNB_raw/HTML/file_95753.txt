<span class="headword">Scott,  Margaretta Mary Winifred</span>  (1912&#150;2005), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born at 6 Mandeville Place, Westminster, on 13 February 1912, the daughter of Hugh Arthur Scott (1878&#150;1951), music critic, and his wife, Bertha Eugenie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Casano (1878&#150;1965). Her mixed Scottish, French, and Spanish ancestry may have accounted in part for the attractively exotic strain in some of her earlier work in particular. She was educated at the convent of the Holy Child Jesus, in Cavendish Square, London, and studied acting first with Rosina Filippi and then at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. She shared a scholarship there with Celia Johnson, who became a lifelong friend, and she was awarded the Kendal prize.<br>
<br>Scott's seventy-year career in the theatre began when, aged fourteen, she appeared as Mercutio's page in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> at the Strand Theatre, London. This was followed by a season with the Repertory Theatre, Hull, before she started her West End career proper in <span class="italic">Her Shop</span> at the Criterion in July 1929. With her stunning dark beauty, eloquent voice, and versatility, she quickly established herself as a popular stage star with a wide emotional range, appearing in about fifty productions during the following decade. Though she graced many modern plays, such as <span class="italic">The First Mrs Fraser</span> and Emlyn Williams's <span class="italic">A Murder has been Arranged</span>, in which, one critic noted, she &#145;played the heroine with an emotional assurance beyond her 18 years&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 21 April 2005), she made her major impact in Shakespearian roles. For instance, at the Haymarket in 1931 she played first the Player Queen in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, and then succeeded Fay Compton as Ophelia, and in the following year was a notably fiery Viola in <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> at the Garrick. However, she was probably most tenaciously associated with the Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park, where, in four seasons (1933, 1934, 1936, and 1937), she played many leading roles, famously Olivia and Viola (in all four seasons) in <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span>, Hermia in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>, Juliet in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, and Rosalind in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>. She also played prolifically in the West End, had seasons at the Old Vic and at Stratford, and during the Second World War, when she wasn't starring in <span class="italic">Major Barbara</span> for Birmingham Repertory Theatre or at the Aldwych in <span class="italic">Watch on the Rhine</span>, she was touring in <span class="italic">Quiet Weekend</span> for ENSA, as Marcia contemplating weedkiller for her golf-mad husband.<br>
<br>As she entered middle age Scott evinced a most commanding authority, allied to her still potent beauty, in a series of notable character roles including Katherine Parr in <span class="italic">The Young Elizabeth</span> at the New Theatre, 1952; Gertrude to Peter O'Toole's <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> at the Bristol Old Vic, 1958; Mrs Rossiter in the ripe drama of Victorian corruptions <span class="italic">The Right Honourable Gentleman</span> at Her Majesty's, 1965; Jocasta to Derek Jacobi's Oedipus in <span class="italic">Oedipus Rex</span> at Birmingham Rep, 1972; and Lady Bracknell in <span class="italic">The Importance of being Earnest</span>, at the Old Vic, 1980. She was back at the Open Air Theatre in 1985 as the wheelchair-bound Madame Desmemortes in <span class="italic">Ring around the Moon</span>, and in her last role, as the imperious Mrs Hepworth, in the Chichester revival of <span class="italic">Hobson's Choice</span> (1995), she was grateful to have a week off in a very hot August because of the burden of her period costume. For someone aged eighty-three this seemed little to ask.<br>
<br>If there was some slight slackening of Scott's stage work in the 1950s this was due to the importance she attached to family life. On 14 September 1948 she married the composer of film scores and much decorated RAF flying ace John de Lacy Wooldridge (1919&#150;1958), with whom she had two children, Susan and Hugh. Her marriage was cut tragically short by John Wooldridge's death in a car accident. In the late 1950s and early 1960s she also taught at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, winning the respect of many students who went on to become famous.<br>
<br>Though the theatre was her first allegiance Scott also had distinguished careers in film and television. Apart from an uncredited part in Alexander Korda's <span class="italic">The Private Life of Don Juan</span> (1934) she made her film d&eacute;but in <span class="italic">Dirty Work</span> (1934), in which she and Basil Sydney played a pair of upper-class crooks, and in many of her films she vividly espoused a haughty aristocratic demeanour, often ruthless, sometimes merely opportunistic. Of her nearly thirty films, among the most memorable were <span class="italic">Things to Come</span> (1936), as Roxana, Ralph Richardson's mistress in this science-fiction classic; <span class="italic">The First Gentleman</span> (1948), as the prince regent's mistress helping him on with his boots; the snobbish Mrs Dixon in John Guillermin's excellent thriller <span class="italic">Town on Trial</span> (1957); and a mother-in-law from hell in <span class="italic">A Woman Possessed</span> (1958), an unusually classy vehicle for the infamous Danziger brothers. She was a less minatory presence as Marcia in <span class="italic">Quiet Wedding</span> (1941), a gracious heroine opposite Anton Walbrook in <span class="italic">The Man from Morocco</span> (1945), and the Empress Eug&eacute;nie in the supremely idiotic <span class="italic">Idol of Paris</span> (1948), which she would later recall with a chortle of horror. But perhaps her finest work on film was as the coldly sensual, but humanly understandable Alicia in <span class="italic">Fanny by Gaslight</span> (1944), giving possibly the most stylish performance in any of the Gainsborough melodramas.<br>
<br>Scott embraced television early and played Beatrice in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span> (1937); she later recalled playing Portia in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> (1947) when Robert Adams, the first black actor to appear in Shakespeare on British television, playing the Prince of Morocco, dropped in a dead faint at her feet, and she was left improvising (this being live TV), &#145;Help, ho! the Prince!&#146;  (McFarlane, 517). Though she appeared in many popular series, the one for which she was perhaps most famous was <span class="italic">All Creatures Great and Small</span> (1978&#150;90), in which she played the benign aristocrat, Mrs Pumphrey, owner of the pampered Pekinese, Tricky-Woo. There was, however, a great deal of more challenging work than this in all the acting media, and she left her mark in them all.<br>
<br>As well as devotion to her family and to a large circle of friends, to many of whom she was Peggy, Scott also gave tirelessly of her time to many theatrical charities, including service on the board of the Actors' Charitable Trust, which managed Denville Hall, the retirement home for former actors. Further, and&#151;given her imposingly patrician acting persona&#151;surprisingly, she was a founder signatory (and the last surviving one) of the actors' union, Equity, in 1934. Though she was known for playing malevolent mistresses and dangerous dowagers, she was a woman of great warmth, kindness, and good humour, enormously respected for both her professional and her personal qualities. She died at her home, 30 Molyneux Street, St Marylebone, London, on 15 April 2005, of pneumonia and breast cancer, and was survived by her daughter, Susan, an actress, and son, Hugh, a theatre director.<br>
