<span class="headword">Boxall,  John</span>  (1524/5&#150;1571), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was born at Bramshott, Hampshire, but the identity of his parents is unknown. He was admitted scholar of Winchester College in 1538 at the age of thirteen and proceeded to New College, Oxford, where he was admitted scholar on 9 October 1540 and fellow exactly two years later (vacating in October 1554). It is presumed he graduated in arts at a foreign university, as he supplicated for incorporation as MA at Oxford on 11 July 1554; at the same time he supplicated for the degree of BTh, which was conferred on 15 July. By February 1558 he had proceeded to the doctorate. He appears to have received no benefice before Mary's accession, but was thereafter amply supplied. In 1554 he was admitted rector of Bishop's Hatfield, Hertfordshire. On 15 October he was elected warden of Winchester College (vacated 9 November 1556). He composed a eulogistic account of the first two years of Mary's reign, to the time (spring 1555) when an heir to the throne was expected  (BL, Royal MS 12.A.XLIX); this may have brought him recognition at court. In the same year he published a sermon preached before convocation in St Paul's Cathedral on 22 October. On 26 October he was presented by the crown to a canonry in Winchester Cathedral (vacated by February 1558). His formal move into the crown's service came on 23 September 1556 when he was appointed to the council &#145;at large&#146; and also as master of requests and a councillor of that court. He probably owed his promotion to Stephen Gardiner, though explicit evidence is lacking. He was at once sent to take part in negotiations with the French over disputed territory in the marches of Calais; he was also (31 October) named a tax collector for Calais. On his return he was named as &#145;umpire&#146; in a case before the court of requests  (<span class="italic">Ancient State</span>, ed. Hill, 175).<br>
<br>Boxall evidently gave satisfaction in these tasks, as on 21 December he was further promoted to membership of the privy council. Between 28 and 30 March 1557 he succeeded Sir William Petre as one of the two principal secretaries. He subsequently (7 April 1558) received a patent for this office, with an annuity of &pound;100 back-dated to 25 March 1557. It was the first time that the secretaryship had been thus formally conferred, an important stage in the development of the office even though Boxall's tenure of it was unremarkable. His inexperience was such that for several months Petre continued to draft state correspondence. Subsequently Boxall's main concern was foreign affairs, his colleague Sir John Bourne handling home matters. Boxall's secretaryship was dominated by the French war, and his chief business was with Thomas Gresham, arranging finance in the Low Countries, and Sir William Pickering, hiring troops there. In March 1558 Bourne resigned, leaving Boxall sole secretary for the rest of the reign. In September King Philip asked Boxall to be among those sent to treat for peace with the French, but the queen replied that he and the others whom the king named were too ill to leave their chambers; Arundel and Thirlby went instead.<br>
<br>Boxall's ecclesiastical career meanwhile advanced in breadth, if not in eminence. By 21 December 1556 he had become archdeacon of Ely (suggesting that Bishop Thirlby was his patron in a more general way). The queen gave him the deanery of Peterborough on 24 June 1557, and on 1 October the rectory of Overton, Hampshire. On 2 December he was instituted to the deanery of Norwich (vacated by 16 May 1558). On 20 December he was presented to the prebend of Newington in St Paul's Cathedral, in the crown's gift on this occasion. On 19 March 1558 he was appointed dean of Windsor with the associated deanery of Wolverhampton, and on 21 July he became register of the Order of the Garter. By 25 June 1557 he had acquired the prebend of Ilton in Wells Cathedral. On 3 November he was presented by the crown to the prebend of Grantham Borealis in Salisbury Cathedral. On 5 December he was collated to the prebend of Stillington in York Minster. He also held the rectory of Bolton Percy, Yorkshire. With others he was granted wardship of the heirs of Sir Thomas Cornwallis and the earl of Pembroke (31 January and 5 July 1557) and on 21 May 1557 he received a reversionary grant of lands. On 18 July 1558 he was licensed to retain ten gentlemen or yeomen beyond any to whom he was already entitled, and on 17 October, a month before Mary's death, he was authorized to apply her signature by stamp. The queen and Cardinal Pole named him an overseer of their respective wills.<br>
<br>Boxall's secretaryship was immediately terminated at Elizabeth's accession. In the days on either side of Mary's death he co-operated amicably with his successor, Sir William Cecil, in handing over the papers of the office, though having to make the astonishing revelation that some documents left in the late queen's death chamber had been used to seal her corpse. It was afterwards suggested by Nicholas Sander that Elizabeth was particularly anxious to retain Boxall's services. But while Mary was still alive, Philip II's envoy noted that Elizabeth thought &#145;muy mal&#146; of him  (Rodr&iacute;guez-Salgado and Adams, 322). Boxall tried to dissuade the queen from giving her assent to the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>. On 2 November 1559 Archbishop Parker was required to administer to him the subsequent oath; on his refusal he was deprived of all his remaining benefices. On 18 June 1560 he was committed to the Tower, where he was allowed some liberty in associating with the other prominent Catholic prisoners. In September 1563 the Tower was evacuated because of plague, and Boxall and Thirlby were committed to Parker's personal custody. Boxall spent the rest of his life in the archbishop's various residences. In June 1564 the council refused him permission to live elsewhere because one of the other Catholic prisoners had broken parole. In July 1569, while at Lambeth, Boxall asked to be allowed to visit his eighty-year-old mother, who was &#145;dangerously diseasid&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 12, fol. 12). Boxall died at Lambeth Palace on 3 or 4 March 1571; his brothers Edmund and Richard were his executors. Boxall was a staunch Catholic, but his disapproval of the Marian persecution gained him esteem from his opponents; Richard Hilles, reporting his death to Bullinger, described him as &#145;a man of much moderation &hellip; and of gentle disposition&#146;  (Robinson, 2.183).<br>
