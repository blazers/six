<span class="headword">Lewis,  Joseph</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1750&#150;1774), <span class="occ">poet and ivory-turner</span>, was born of untraced parentage, at an unknown date, possibly in Wales. By 1750 he was already living in London, but lines he wrote in praise of Sir John Philipps suggest that he may have spent his childhood in the neighbourhood of the Philipps family estate in Carmarthenshire. The poem acknowledges &#145;How good he's been to me in Infant Years&#146;  (&#145;An Acrostick&#146;, Lewis, <span class="italic">Lucubrations</span>, 25), which might mean that Sir John, who was well known for his support of local schools, saw to Lewis's elementary education. Lewis worked throughout his career as an artisan; he was described in 1754 as &#145;an illiterate raw Lad &hellip; a mechanic&#146;  (Rizzo, <span class="italic">Bulletin of Research in the Humanities</span>, 83), later as &#145;a poor ivory-turner&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1758), and his poems frequently reflect the vicissitudes of a working man's life. Lewis's first traceable activity in London, however, is in 1750&#150;51 as editor of the <span class="italic">Westminster Magazine</span>, under the pseudonym Lancelot Poverty-Struck. Most of its articles were reprinted from contemporary periodicals, but several poems can be identified as the work of Lewis himself.<br>
<br>Lewis's pseudonym represents both his public persona and his chronic condition. He lamented in 1773 that &#145;Poverty has stuck so close to me all my Life time: that Providence never trusted me with more Than Six Guineas at one period of Time&#146;  (Rizzo, &#145;Found: Joseph Lewis&#146;, 286). By 1752 he was married and living in the parish of Covent Garden, notorious then as a squalid, crime-ridden district. A son Joseph was baptized there on 17 December 1752. Lewis published two books of verse. The first, <span class="italic">Mother Midnight's Comical Pocket-Book</span> ([1753?]), appeared under the pseudonym Humphrey Humdrum, esq., but his authorship is attested by &#145;The Author's Epitaph&#146;, an acrostic spelling out the name &#145;Joseph Lewis&#146;, and confirmed by Ralph Griffiths in a handwritten note in the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>. His authorship of the second, <span class="italic">The Miscellaneous and Whimsical Lucubrations of Lancelot Poverty-Struck</span> (1758), follows from his assertion in it that he was author of the <span class="italic">Pocket-Book</span>. The second collection is said to have originated when, &#145;not having sufficient employment at his business to supply his family with bread&#146;, he thought of earning money by writing begging letters in verse. His success encouraged him to write other poems, until he had accumulated so many that &#145;he was advised and enabled by some of his friends to print them&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1758). Lewis's own account is somewhat different. He identifies himself in both books as &#145;Mother Midnight's merry grandson&#146;, alluding to the pseudonym Mrs Midnight adopted by Christopher Smart in <span class="italic">The Midwife</span> and for <span class="italic">Mrs Midnight's Oratory</span>, and he was apparently involved with Smart's ventures in the 1750s, but claims that he was &#145;abandoned by his antient and venerable Grandmother&#146; for some misdemeanour, and was therefore &#145;oblig'd to commence Author for a small Livelihood&#146;  (Lewis, <span class="italic">Lucubrations</span>, 93).<br>
<br>While the <span class="italic">Pocket-Book</span> consists largely of <span class="italic">Oratory</span> material, Lewis's &#145;lucubrations&#146; comment satirically on topical events and personalities, and depict with pungent realism and comic inventiveness the daily life of lower-class London. The struggles and humiliations of the author himself as he battles to keep his family from starvation are recounted with unquenchable humour. &#145;The Humble Petition of Lancelot Poverty-Struck&#146; to David Garrick is typical: trade is bad, creditors are pressing, his wife Sarah is pregnant with a third child, while<blockquote>
<div>Cold and Hunger closely pinches,<br>
</div>
<div>And kills his Family by Inches.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>An effusive &#145;Acrostick&#146; to Garrick which follows indicates that Lewis's plea was successful  (Lewis, <span class="italic">Lucubrations</span>, 10&#150;15). Although <span class="italic">Lucubrations</span> earned the commendation that there was &#145;in almost all of the pieces a strain of natural genius&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1758), the struggle against poverty continued. A street ballad of the 1760s shows &#145;Lancelot&#146; desperate again but still clowning:<blockquote>
<div>By my friends turn'd adrift,<br>
</div>
<div>I am at my last shift<br>
</div> (&#145;A Song on myself, by Lancelot Poverty-Struck&#146;, Madden Ballads, 3, CUL)</blockquote>In 1768 Lewis tried a new method of soliciting help: he inserted a series of advertisements in the <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span> (April&#150;May) under the heading &#145;Real Calamity&#146;, describing in doggerel verse the hardships of &#145;the poor Poet&#146; (now lame) and his &#145;distressed Family&#146;, and inviting donations. At that time he was living in Holborn, &#145;at Mr Jones's, a Baker in Field Lane&#146;  (Rizzo, <span class="italic">Bulletin of Research in the Humanities</span>, 81.86). He amassed over &pound;10 in a few weeks by this device, but his troubles were not over. In a real letter sent in 1773 to Oliver Goldsmith from St Bride's workhouse, Hoxton, he explains how he and his family had been forced to take refuge in the workhouse. He had thirteen children by then but was unable to work because of swelling in his legs and lack of money to buy tools: &#145;I have got a Galloping consumption in my Pocket in this distressed Hotel: and have nothing to cheer my heart: or raise a Smile on the Countenance of my Wife and Children&#146;. He was seeking money also to print a tract on the &#145;Oppressor of the poor&#146;, and planning to write a description of workhouse life, &#145;all Tragi Comic from Morning till Night&#146;  (Rizzo, &#145;Found: Joseph Lewis&#146;, 285&#150;6). Apart from an acrostic by him praising a Dr Wolf Joseph Yonker, dated 1774 but sent to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> by an anonymous contributor in 1785, that is the last heard of Lewis.<br>
