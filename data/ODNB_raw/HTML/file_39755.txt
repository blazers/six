<span class="headword">Carter,  Thomas</span>  (1690&#150;1763), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Hollybrook, co. Dublin. He was the only surviving son of Thomas Carter (<i>c</i>.1650&#150;1726), a lawyer and MP, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Houghton (<i>c</i>.1660&#150;1696), and descended from Thomas Carter, armiger, born in the reign of Edward IV. Following his early education at Mr Wall's school in Dublin he matriculated at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1707 and graduated BA in 1710. He entered the Middle Temple, London, in 1708. He became an attorney of the court of king's bench, Dublin, and clerk of the crown and protonotary in the same court following his father's purchase of that office in 1717 for the sum of &pound;4000 (it remained in the family until 1790). In 1718 he was admitted a bencher of King's Inn, and from 1737 to 1741 served as treasurer there.<br>
<br>Carter married in 1719 Mary (<i>c</i>.1700&#150;1780), the daughter and coheir of Thomas Claxton, armiger, of Dublin, and his wife, Mary Pearce, the sister of Lieutenant-General Thomas Pearce, military governor of Limerick; she brought Carter a dowry of &pound;3000. The couple had two sons, Thomas Carter (<i>bap</i>. 12 July 1720), MP for Old Leighlin, and Henry Boyle Carter (<i>bap</i>. 21 Nov 1726), and three daughters, one of whom, Frances, married Philip Twysden, bishop of Raphoe.<br>
<br>Carter was MP for Trim, Meath, from 1719 to 1727, and was returned as a member for Hillsborough, Dungarvan, and Lismore in 1727; he elected to sit for Hillsborough, and held the seat until 1761. In 1723 he obtained the reversion of the office of second serjeant-at-arms from his father (the office was in the Carter family from 1692 to 1753). In April 1725 William, Lord Berkeley, master of the rolls, appointed Carter his deputy and obtained permission to sell him the reversion of that office, much to the disapproval of Hugh Boulter, Anglican primate of Ireland, who was promoting the English interest, that such an important office could be purchased by an Irishman.<br>
<br>Carter was a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Lord Chancellor Midleton. By September 1725 he had allied himself with Midleton's son St John Brodrick, who headed an influential party in the Commons. They proposed to the viceroy, Lord Carteret, to undertake the king's business in parliament, but as he rejected their plan they opposed practically everything his parliamentary managers initiated.<br>
<br>On 6 May 1727 Carter was appointed second examiner in chancery. In 1729 he acquired Castle Martin, co. Kildare, as his family seat, and from 1730 to 1752 he was judge and ranger of the curragh of Kildare.<br>
<br>By the end of the 1720s Carter had been won over to the Dublin Castle party, and he was approached by the duke of Dorset, appointed viceroy in June 1730, to secure his support. Dorset assisted him in his purchase of the mastership of the rolls in 1731&#151;for which Carter paid in excess of &pound;11,000&#151;made him his chief parliamentary manager, and entrusted him with the care of his son, Lord George Sackville, in his absence. Dorset recognized that Carter was due further reward for the considerable expense in purchasing this office, and the following May the king granted him an additional &pound;500 per annum to his office of clerk of the crown and protonotary. It was in 1731 that Carter commissioned Sir Edward Pearce, his wife's cousin, to build him a magnificent house, with the finest staircase hall in Dublin, opposite Archbishop Boulter's residence in Henrietta Street, where much government business was conducted.<br>
<br>In 1732 Carter was raised to the privy council, and when Speaker Gore died in February 1733 he was among the candidates most acceptable to Dublin Castle; however, the position went to Henry Boyle, a close friend and godfather to his younger son. When Walpole sent instructions to Dorset to attempt the repeal of the <span class="roman">Sacramental Test Act</span> of 1704 (which prevented protestant dissenters from holding public office, from receiving a military commission, and from enjoying full civil rights), Carter and Boyle were against it, and Dorset soon realized this proposal would fail.<br>
<br>Carter now had a substantial income. He had inherited about 4000 acres in co. Meath from his father, following the latter's death in 1726. In addition to this he inherited the extensive Roscommon estates in and around Trim which his father had acquired in 1702 when he married Isabella, the widow of the celebrated Wentworth, fourth earl of Roscommon. Carter's estates realized &pound;4000 per annum and his combined offices a further &pound;7500 per annum.<br>
<br>Carter was still at the height of his political career when in 1745 Lord Chesterfield, as viceroy, described him as &#145;the leading person in the [Irish] Parliament&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 3.638). However, in 1748 he was seriously ill and wished his eldest son to be granted the reversion of the office of master of the rolls. He approached Lord Harrington and then George Stone, primate of Ireland, but the latter, who wanted his nominee to occupy the post, refused to countenance the suggestion. Carter, who believed he had a right to determine the reversion because of his purchase, was resentful, and this drove him into opposition and led to his co-ordinating an intensive campaign against Stone.<br>
<br>For many years Carter had been in charge of financial business in the Commons, as chairman of the committees of supply and ways and means. In 1753 he opposed the claim of the crown to dispose of unappropriated revenue in the Irish exchequer and engineered the defeat of this money bill. This incurred the king's displeasure, and as a result Carter was dismissed from his office as master of the rolls in 1754. Although a settlement followed the next year when Carter was appointed principal secretary of state, keeper of the privy seal, with an additional salary of &pound;1200 per annum (which office he held until his death), he remained dissatisfied and was regarded by Dublin Castle as one who was most against English interests in Ireland.<br>
<br>The earl of Shelburne described Carter as &#145;a man of a very original character, whose uncommon sagacity and shrewdness as well as depth of understanding, would have distinguished and advanced him in any country&#146;  (Fitzmaurice, 1.239). His shrewd judgement of character is well illustrated by his advice to the duke of Dorset: &#145;whatever he did with his son never to put him into the army&#146;  (ibid.). Lord George Sackville was later to face a court martial and was found &#145;unfit to serve his Majesty in any military capacity whatsoever&#146;  (A. C. Valentine, <span class="italic">Lord George Germain</span>, 1962, 68). Speaker Pery attributed to Carter the ingenious invention of conveying libels in toasts which afterwards gained circulation through the newspapers, while Walpole characterized him as &#145;an able, intriguing man, of slender reputation for integrity&#146;  (Walpole, 1.192). Plowden's <span class="italic">Historical Review</span> refers to Carter's talent for &#145;keeping the table in a roar of laughter by his archness, vivacity and wit&#146;  (Plowden, 1.310).<br>
<br>Carter also made significant contributions to farming and country pursuits, not sparing any expense to bring them to perfection. He imported the best breed of cattle and built several mills for grinding corn. He died while staying with his son at Rathnally House, near Trim, on 3 September 1763 and was buried at St Patrick's Cathedral at Trim.<br>
