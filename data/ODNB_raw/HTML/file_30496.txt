<span class="headword">Atkinson,  Robert</span>  (1839&#150;1908), <span class="occ">philologist</span>, born at Gateshead on 6 April 1839, was the only child of John Atkinson, who was a grocer there, and his wife, Ann. After education at the Anchorage grammar school close to his home from 1849 to 1856, he matriculated at Trinity College, Dublin, on 2 July 1856, but he spent the years 1857 and 1858 on the continent, principally at Li&egrave;ge. There he laid the foundation of his knowledge of the Romance languages. On his return to Ireland he worked as a schoolmaster in Kilkenny until he won a Trinity College scholarship in 1862. From this time his academic progress was rapid. He graduated BA on 16 December 1863, and proceeded MA in 1866 and LLD in 1869. In 1891 he received the honorary degree of DLitt. On 28 December 1863 he married, at Gateshead, Hannah Maria (<i>b</i>. 1838/9, <i>d</i>. in or after 1908), fourth daughter of Thomas and Elisabeth Whitehouse Harbutt of the town. Their only child, Herbert Jefcoate Atkinson, became a civil engineer.<br>
<br>In 1869 Atkinson became university professor of the Romance languages, and from 1871 until near his death he filled at the same time the chair of Sanskrit and comparative philology. His masterly powers of linguistic analysis made him an admirable teacher, notably of composition in Latin and Romance tongues, while the immense range of his linguistic faculty proved to be of great benefit to his pupils. He also taught Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu, and other Indian tongues. He was a brilliant Hebrew scholar, and Persian, Arabic, and several languages of central and western Asia were familiar to him. In all the many forms of speech that he studied he acquired a mastery of colloquial idiom and of pronunciation, as well as of the literary style. In his later years he devoted his leisure to Chinese, and at his death he had completed a dictionary of that tongue. The key which he intended to accompany it, however, and without which it could not be used, he did not live to complete. The manuscript was presented by his widow to the library of Trinity College, Dublin.<br>
<br>A scientific philologist, Atkinson was always intent upon analysis of the structure of a language rather than on its literature. He impressed on his pupils the principle of law in language, as opposed to theories of &#145;sporadic changes&#146;. In this he long anticipated Brugmann and the new school of philologists.<br>
<br>The most important outcome of Atkinson's study of Romance languages was a scholarly edition of a Norman-French poem attributed to Matthew Paris, and entitled <span class="italic">Vie de Seint Auban</span> (1876). It showed &#145;his chronic hatred of incompetence&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 74). In Sanskrit learning Atkinson confined himself to the language of the Vedas and to Sanskrit grammar, planning and partially writing a Vedic dictionary, and learning by heart, as Pandits had done for twenty-four centuries, the whole of the intricate masterpiece of the great grammarian Panini. In addition Atkinson was an advanced scholar in Coptic, the Christian descendant of the ancient Egyptian language. In two communications to the Royal Irish Academy  (<span class="italic">Proceedings</span>, 3rd ser., 3.24, 225) in 1893, he subjected to searching examination a series of Coptic texts recently published by Professor Rossi and M. Bouriant, protesting against their tendency to &#145;play hieroglyphics&#146; with Coptic texts. In the decipherment of the ancient Egyptian language there is room, no doubt, for conjecture and hypothesis: in Coptic, he claimed, the rules of accidence and syntax are fully known, and editing and translation should proceed with scientific regularity.<br>
<br>On 11 January 1875 Atkinson was elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy, and in March became a member of its council. In 1876 he was chosen librarian. Secretary of council from 1878 to 1901, he was then elected president (1901&#150;6). Meanwhile in 1884 he was Todd professor of the Celtic languages in the academy, and delivered an inaugural lecture on Irish lexicography on 13 April 1885. His Celtic work was that of a pioneer, being undertaken before many fundamental principles of old Irish grammar were recognized, and he edited two documents of the utmost importance for the student of the history of the Irish language. The first was <span class="italic">The Passions and Homilies from the Leabhar Breac</span>, with translation and glossary (Dublin, 1887; an important source for Middle Irish), to which he appended the &#145;Todd introductory lecture on Irish lexicography&#146;. The second was Keating's <span class="italic">Three Shafts of Death</span> (<span class="italic">Tr&iacute; bior-gaoithe an bh&aacute;is</span>, Dublin, 1890), with glossary and appendices on the linguistic forms. He also wrote valuable introductions and analyses of contents for several of the manuscript facsimiles issued by the Royal Irish Academy, including <span class="italic">The Book of Leinster</span> (1880), <span class="italic">The Book of Ballymote</span> (1887), and <span class="italic">The Yellow Book of Lecan</span> (1896). In his introduction to the last  (p. 4) Atkinson restricts the value of medieval Irish texts to folklore and linguistics, claiming that they contain &#145;a very small quantity of what may be called imaginative literature&#146;. This view, shared by such members of the Trinity &#145;establishment&#146; as Professor Edward Dowden, so incensed Lady Gregory that she spent two years in the Royal Irish Academy Library translating saga tales, which she published as <span class="italic">Cuchulainn of Muirthemne</span>, &#145;a seminal book for writers of the literary renaissance&#146;  (U. O'Connor, <span class="italic">Celtic Dawn</span>, 1984, 150&#150;51). With Dr John Bernard, later bishop of Ossory, Atkinson edited for the Henry Bradshaw Society in 1898 <span class="italic">The Irish liber hymnorum</span> (2 vols.). A <span class="italic">Glossary to the Ancient Laws of Ireland</span>, which he prepared for the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span> in 1901, was severely criticized by Whitley Stokes. To Irish, Atkinson added a knowledge of Welsh, and contributed a paper &#145;On the use of the subjunctive mood in Welsh&#146;  (<span class="italic">Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy</span>, 1894).<br>
<br>Atkinson's varied energies were by no means confined to philology: he was an accomplished botanist, a fine violinist, and an exponent of ju-jitsu. In 1907 his health failed. He died on 10 January 1908 at his residence, Clareville, Rathmines, near Dublin, and was buried at Waltonwrays cemetery, Skipton, Yorkshire.<br>
