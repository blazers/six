</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Adderley,  Charles Bowyer</span>, first Baron Norton  (1814&#150;1905), <span class="occ">politician</span>, born at Knighton House, Leicestershire, on 2 August 1814, was the eldest son of Charles Clement Adderley (1780&#150;1818) and his wife, Anna Maria (<i>d</i>. 1827), daughter of Sir Edmund Burney Cradock-Hartopp, first baronet, a descendant of Oliver Cromwell. On the death without issue of his great-uncle, Charles Bowyer Adderley of Hams Hall, Warwickshire, on 12 April 1826, Charles succeeded to the great family estates round Birmingham, elsewhere in Warwickshire, and in Staffordshire. He was subsequently taken from school at Redland near Bristol, and placed under a clerical tutor of low-church views, who deepened the evangelical convictions with which his parents had imbued him. In 1832 he became a gentleman commoner at Christ Church, Oxford, where he maintained his piety and acquired a knowledge of music and art, and a love of tobacco and horse-back riding&#151;he rode daily until he was eighty-eight, and hunted for many years. At Christ Church he began, too, a lifelong friendship with John Robert Godley, who greatly influenced him. He took a pass degree in 1835.<br>
<br>From 1836 to 1841 Adderley mainly spent his time in travel, study, and the management of his estates. He sought to develop his property on enlightened principles. When he came of age in 1835 the estate at Saltley near Birmingham supported a population of 400, which grew to 27,000 in his lifetime. He planned the streets of the town in 1837 so as to avoid the possibility of slums, and hence may be called the father of town planning. In providing, endowing, and supporting places of worship in Saltley he spent &pound;70,000. He gave Adderley Park to Birmingham; in 1847 he promoted the foundation of the Saltley Church Training College (in which he maintained a lifelong interest) and in 1852 he founded the Saltley Reformatory on the model of that at Mettray, near Tours, in France.<br>
<br>The family residence at Hams Hall was not far from the home of Sir Robert Peel at Drayton Manor, Tamworth. Peel urged Adderley to enter parliament and in June 1841 he was elected as a tory for Staffordshire North. He held the seat through eight elections, retiring in 1878. Adderley opposed Peel's free trade policy of 1846, although he formally abandoned protection at the general election of 1852. At first he took little part in debate, but wrote occasionally&#151;on general topics in the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> in 1848 and on colonial subjects in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> in 1854.<h2>
<a name="Colonialquestions"></a>Colonial questions</h2>Gradually colonial questions roused Adderley's enthusiasm, and he soon gave important services to the cause of colonial development. In 1849 he was involved with his friends Godley, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, Gladstone, and George William, fourth Baron Lyttelton, in the Church of England colony of Canterbury in New Zealand. In the same year he strenuously resisted Lord Grey's proposal to transport convicts to the Cape, and elaborated his argument in a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Transportation not Necessary</span> (1851). To Adderley's advocacy the Cape colonists assigned the government's abandonment of its threat to send Irish political convicts among them, and by way of gratitude they named Adderley Street after him. Penal colonial settlements were abrogated in 1852, partly owing to Adderley's activity.<br>
<br>Meanwhile in 1849 Adderley helped Wakefield to found the Colonial Reform Society for promoting colonial self-government, and he became its secretary. In <span class="italic">The Australian Colonies Bill Discussed</span> (1849) he urged complete delegation of powers to the colony while throwing on it the cost of any imperial assistance. The independent constitution of New Zealand was drafted at Hams Hall in 1850 and the constitution of the other colonies followed this precedent. In <span class="italic">Some Reflections on the Speech of Lord John Russell on Colonial Policy</span> (1850) Adderley declared that principles of self-government could alone yield &#145;thriving colonies, heartily and inseparably and usefully attached to England&#146;. He powerfully developed his views in <span class="italic">The Statement of the Present Cape Case</span> (1851); in his <span class="italic">Remarks on Mr. Godley's Speech on Self-Government for New Zealand</span> (1857); in his letter to Disraeli on <span class="italic">The Present Relation of England with her Colonies</span> (1861; 2nd edn 1862); and finally in his <span class="italic">Review of &#145;The colonial policy of Lord John Russell's administration,&#146; by Earl Grey [1853], and of subsequent colonial history</span> (3 pts, 1869), a comprehensive survey of the progress of colonial freedom. At the age of ninety, in his <span class="italic">Imperial Fellowship of Self-Governed British Colonies</span> (1903), he enunciated anew his lifelong conviction that &#145;colonial self-administration and imperial fellowship&#146; are &#145;co-ordinate elements&#146; in &#145;true colonial relationship&#146;.<h2>
<a name="ServiceinConservativegovernments"></a>Service in Conservative governments</h2>In Lord Derby's first administration of 1852 Adderley, having moved the motion on the Cape which led to the fall of Russell's government, refused the secretaryship of the Board of Control, and continued to advocate as a private member of the House of Commons social and educational as well as colonial reforms with a political independence which earned him the epithet of liberal conservative. In 1852 he introduced a reformatory schools bill, for bringing refractory children or young criminals under educational control. In 1853 he opposed with great foresight the abandonment of the Orange River Sovereignty. In 1854 he was responsible for the <span class="roman">Young Offenders Act</span> (a part of his &#145;reformatory&#146; policy), and he introduced the <span class="roman">Manchester and Salford Education Bill</span>, in which a local education rate was first proposed. In <span class="italic">Punishment is not Education</span> (1856) and in his <span class="italic">Tract on Tickets of Leave</span> (1857) he pushed further his plea that education might cure crime more effectively than punishment.<br>
<br>On the formation of Lord Derby's second ministry in February 1858 Adderley was appointed vice-president of the education committee of the privy council. His office also constituted him president of the Board of Health, and a charity commissioner. The educational situation was peculiarly interesting. On 21 June 1858 Adderley, in moving the education vote, gave the first official estimate of the cost of a national system of elementary education: he put the amount at a million pounds per annum. At the same time he pointed out that that was the first day on which the University of Oxford was conducting its middle-class examinations throughout the country, and was thereby inaugurating a new correlation of the universities to national life. Next day the first royal commission on elementary education was announced.<br>
<br>During his brief term of office Adderley consolidated the accumulated minutes of the council on education, prepared the way for the revised code, passed a <span class="roman">Reformatory Act</span> amending that of 1854, and (faithful to the principle of devolution) passed a first <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span>, the term &#145;local government&#146; being his own invention.<br>
<br>In March 1859 Derby's ministry was defeated on a second reading of its <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>. A dissolution followed, leaving the Conservatives in a minority. In the event Lord Palmerston became prime minister. The outbreak of war in New Zealand in 1860 moved Adderley deeply, but he advised the colonists to provide an army of their own, while urging that all parts of the empire should give mutual help in case of need. In the same year he introduced without success an education bill which aimed at making education compulsory. In Derby's third administration of 1866 Adderley became under-secretary for the colonies, and was immediately confronted by the difficult case of Governor Edward John Eyre whom he controversially defended from the attacks of John Stuart Mill and others. In the same session he carried through the House of Commons the <span class="roman">British North America Act</span> (1867), which created the dominion of Canada. Amid his parliamentary occupations, Adderley published <span class="italic">Europe Incapable of American Democracy</span> (1867), in which he sought to reconcile his Conservative faith with advanced ideas of social freedom and progress.<br>
<br>Adderley continued in office when Disraeli succeeded Derby as prime minister. He resigned with his colleagues in December 1868, and was made KCMG the next year by Gladstone, the new prime minister, who was a personal friend. &#145;I am glad our opponents decorate our bench,&#146; remarked Disraeli. Adderley was made chairman of the sanitary commission which reported in 1871 and led to the passing of the <span class="roman">Public Health Acts</span> of 1872 and 1875. He took a prominent part in opposing Irish disestablishment.<br>
<br>When Disraeli returned to office in February 1874, Adderley became president of the Board of Trade, but owing to his frank independence, which the prime minister feared, he was not admitted to the cabinet. &#145;Single-heartedness, unfailing temper, and unwearied zeal&#146; characterized his departmental work. The amendment of the merchant shipping law was his first official concern in the House of Commons, and he was brought into painful conflict with Samuel Plimsoll. Adderley's bill of 1875 was assailed by Plimsoll and withdrawn. In 1876 another bill which legalized a &#145;loadline&#146; usually named after Plimsoll, although Adderley claimed it as his own, was introduced and passed. On 8 March 1878 Adderley retired from office with a peerage, taking the title of Baron Norton. In the same year he presided at the Cheltenham meeting of the Social Science Congress, and he was a frequent speaker in the House of Lords on education and colonial and social questions. In 1880 he refused an offer of the governorship of Bombay. In his speech in the upper house on the education code of May 1882 (reprinted as a pamphlet) he practically advocated free education and protested against the complexity of the code with its detailed system of payment by results. He sat on the reformatory and industrial schools commission (1883) and on the education commissions of 1883&#150;4 and 1887. In 1884 he played some part in effecting a compromise between the two houses on the Liberal government's <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>.<h2>
<a name="Religiousviews"></a>Religious views</h2>Norton had long played an active part in religious affairs. As early as 1849 he had published a devotional <span class="italic">Essay on Human Happiness</span> (rev. edn 1854). In his <span class="italic">Reflections on the Rev. Dr. Hook's Sermon on &#145;the Lord's Day&#146;</span> (1856) he dwelt on the need for popular parks, gardens, and reading-rooms for Sunday recreation and religious contemplation. A strong churchman, he nevertheless advocated in 1889 a union between the Church of England and the Wesleyans, and he developed an aspiration to heal protestant schism and stay controversy in <span class="italic">High and Low Church</span> (1892, 2nd edn 1893). His hope of reconciling apparently opposing social as well as religious forces found expression in his <span class="italic">Socialism</span> (1895), in which respect for manual labour and zeal in social service and social reform were shown to harmonize with Conservative and Christian feeling. In his <span class="italic">Reflections on the Course from the Goal</span> (1898, 2nd edn 1899) he discussed the formation of character. His religious views kept him in touch with all classes of thinkers, and neither doctrinal nor political differences affected his private friendship. With Gladstone especially he was long on cordial terms. Cobden and Bright were among his political friends, and he reckoned Archbishop Benson, Cardinal Manning, Dr Dale, and Edward King, bishop of Lincoln, among his intimate acquaintances. To the end of his life Norton wrote long letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span> on his favourite themes of social reform, education, and colonial affairs. He was not a brilliant writer or speaker, and was reckoned by political colleagues to be tenacious and outspoken to the verge of obstinacy and bluntness, but his views were enlightened, generous, and far-seeing, and they influenced the progress of public opinion. He was in addition a skilled musician and a competent art critic.<br>
<br>Adderley married on 28 July 1842 Julia Anne Eliza (<i>d</i>. 1887), daughter of Chandos Leigh, first Baron Leigh of Stoneleigh. There were ten children&#151;five sons and five daughters. He was succeeded, as second Baron Norton, by his eldest son, Charles Leigh Adderley. His youngest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54554/', "James Granville Adderley (1861&#150;1942)")</script>, became vicar of Saltley in 1904. Lady Norton died on 8 May 1887. Norton died at his home, Hams Hall, on 28 March 1905, and was buried in the family vault in Lea Marston church, Warwickshire. The Norton Memorial Hall at Saltley was erected in his memory.<br>
