<span class="headword">Brett,  Edwin John</span>  (1828&#150;1895), <span class="occ">journal editor and publisher</span>, was born in White Horse Lane, Canterbury, the son of Thomas Brett (<i>c</i>.1777&#150;1867), British army officer, and his wife, Mary. At fourteen he was apprenticed to a watchmaker, but soon moved to London, where he worked as an artist-engraver. By the age of sixteen he was engraving for Henry Vizetelly's <span class="italic">Pictorial Times</span>.<br>
<br>Brett joined a radical Chartist circle that included Feargus O'Connor and George Augustus Sala, the latter friendship continuing until his death. He was present at the Kennington Common Chartist demonstration on 10 April 1848, and later claimed that its failure was decisive in his later shift towards mainstream politics. On 4 January 1849 he married Eliza (1832&#150;1893), daughter of Henry Archer, a Clerkenwell butcher. Brett found a valuable professional mentor in Herbert Ingram, publisher and Liberal MP, but his proposed take-over of the editorship of the <span class="italic">Illustrated Inventor</span> was thwarted on 8 September 1860 when Ingram drowned in Lake Michigan.<br>
<br>Brett gained his first editorship in 1864, presiding over Edward Harrison's <span class="italic">English Girl's Journal and Ladies' Magazine</span> with William Emmett. When it folded the following year they parted acrimoniously, and went into competition with each other in the expanding market for boys' periodicals. Brett then joined the Newsagents' Publishing Company (NPC) at 147 Fleet Street, and inaugurated an era of astonishing success with a series of best-selling periodicals. With aggressive marketing and shrewd identification of his target readership, he garnered profits that only his lack of interest in bookkeeping prevent historians from estimating. Under his management the NPC developed a new sub-genre in &#145;penny-dreadful&#146; fiction that placed juvenile heroes in tales of sensational brutality. These publications came under attack for their glamorization of highwaymen and housebreakers.<br>
<br>By 1866 this success had allowed Brett to found <span class="italic">Boys of England</span> at 173 Fleet Street, a weekly whose blend of thrilling fiction and factual articles enjoyed popularity until its closure in 1899. It adopted a somewhat spurious moral tone, repackaging lurid narratives within the dignifying context of imperial heroism. Articles exhorted boys to participate in outdoor games and surrender their pocket money to the journal's lifeboat subscription fund (Brett named the vessel after himself). By January 1868 the periodical had proved popular enough for him to target a slightly older readership with <span class="italic">Young Men of Great Britain</span> (1868&#150;72), a &#145;healthy, moral, instructive and amusing companion for every age&#146;. Brett became agony uncle to thousands of boys who sought his advice on broken voices, bad breath, and the propriety of using tinted writing paper. He eventually gave the paper its own etiquette column.<br>
<br>As 173 Fleet Street became &#145;The Boys of England Office&#146;, Brett nurtured a new respectability. He found homes for several street orphans, helping them to honest careers. The prestige of his papers was further enhanced when he took advantage of the bankruptcy of the adventure novelist Captain Mayne Reid, signing him as a regular contributor and saving the author from ruin.<br>
<br>During the 1870s Brett expanded into other markets, overseeing the production of popular romantic fictions under such titles as <span class="roman">Wedding Bells</span> (1870&#150;79) and <span class="roman">Something to Read</span> (1881&#150;99). His <span class="roman">English Ladies' Novelettes</span> (1891&#150;2) became the <span class="roman">Princesses' Novelettes</span>, which survived until 1904. By this time Brett was dividing his time between two residences, Burleigh House, at 342 Camden Road, and Oaklands, on the Isle of Thanet. Financial success allowed him to indulge his passion for arms and armour, and over thirty years he acquired nearly a thousand items of militaria. After the death of Eliza Brett on 30 May 1893, he occupied himself with the collection, for which he published a lavishly illustrated catalogue in 1894. This formed the basis of the Christies catalogue when he began to sell the collection at auction on 18 March 1895. After a long illness Brett died at Burleigh House on 15 December 1895, leaving an estate worth &pound;76,538 to his nine children. The majority of his publishing empire was left to his eldest sons, Edwin Charles and Edgar Percy, who continued to manage its titles until the business collapsed in 1909. Brett was buried in the family vault in Highgate cemetery on 19 December 1895.<br>
