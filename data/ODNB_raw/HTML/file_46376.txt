<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jones,  (William) Kennedy</span>  (1865&#150;1921), <span class="occ">newspaper manager and editor</span>, was born on 4 May 1865 at Glasgow, the son of Henry Jones of Newry, co. Down, and his wife, Jeanie Kennedy of Ayr. He married Hetty, daughter of James Staniland of Birmingham, in 1892, and was the father of one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>K. J., as Jones was known, was educated at Glasgow high school, leaving at sixteen to start a career in newspapers. He worked first as a reporter and sub-editor in Glasgow, notably with <span class="italic">The News</span> and the <span class="italic">Evening News</span>. He later moved south, and took with him the advantages of a practical apprenticeship in journalism and a sure instinct for the human-interest story that would sell newspapers.<br>
<br>After brief engagements in Leicester and Birmingham, Jones sought work in London. <span class="italic">Morning</span>, which he helped to start in 1892, failed to prosper, but the experience convinced him that there was a market for a halfpenny morning daily if the right formula could be found. Jones moved to T. P. O'Connor's <span class="italic">Sun</span> as news editor after a few months but, in 1894, undeterred by lack of capital, he gambled boldly, acquiring with Louis Tracy, assistant editor of <span class="italic">The Sun</span>, an option to purchase the London <span class="italic">Evening News</span>, then running at a loss despite a respectable circulation of about 100,000. The idea was to sell it on quickly to Alfred Harmsworth, whom Jones had identified as a potential buyer.<br>
<br>The sale secured Jones a 7&frac12; per cent stake in the profits of the <span class="italic">Evening News</span> and, after a short interval, the editorship, which he retained until 1900. The paper was completely refashioned, with political coverage reduced to make way for sport, prize competitions, serialized fiction, and the kind of eye-catching feature articles with which Harmsworth had successfully entertained the readers of <span class="italic">Answers</span>. Its fortunes were transformed, and Harold Harmsworth was soon referring to the <span class="italic">Evening News</span> as &#145;our gold brick&#146;  (Pound and Harmsworth, 172).<br>
<br>Alfred Harmsworth, with no previous experience of newspapers, allowed Jones to steer his early ventures as a proprietor. At Jones's suggestion the Glasgow <span class="italic">Daily Record</span> was acquired in 1895 as the first of a projected chain of provincial dailies. This project, however, was soon eclipsed by the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, launched in May 1896, flagship of a new style of popular journalism which originated in Jones's vision of a halfpenny paper produced in London and wired to provincial cities for printing, distribution, and early-morning sale. Though not burdened with the routine duties of editorship Jones was given overall responsibility for content and style. The runaway success of the <span class="italic">Mail</span> owed much to Harmsworth's abrasive, ambitious deputy. It was typical of Jones that he should boast of his part in transforming journalism, once a profession, into &#145;a branch of commerce&#146;. He had an instinct for news that would make newspapers sell. War, which &#145;not only creates a supply of news but a demand for it&#146;, featured prominently, as well as funerals, football results, and the &#145;First-class Murder&#146;  (Jones, 173, 198&#150;201).<br>
<br>As his newspaper empire expanded Harmsworth came to rely on Jones's shrewd commercial judgement and his aggressive business mentality. Jones appeared to relish his reputation as Harmsworth's hard man and minder. &#145;He had&#146;, it has been observed, &#145;almost none of the elements of personal popularity&#146; and &#145;many enemies whose existence seemed to give him pleasure&#146;  (Pound and Harmsworth, 173&#150;4). When more subtle skills were required, however, Jones was adept, acting in 1908 as an intermediary in the negotiations which led to Harmsworth's purchase of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. His intervention was critical in enabling Harmsworth to snatch the prize from Arthur Pearson's grasp at the eleventh hour. Jones then modernized the <span class="italic">Times</span> printing works, but was denied the editorial influence which he had anticipated. In 1912, following a period of ill health, he sold his newspaper interests. After two further years as chairman of Waring and Gillow, the London furniture store, Jones retired from business.<br>
<br>Jones entered politics in April 1916 as an independent candidate at the Wimbledon by-election. His robust radical right-wing campaign led to a substantial protest vote against the wartime party truce, sending a clear message to the ailing Asquith government &#145;on behalf of the Do-it-now party&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 26 April 1916). Elected unopposed as Unionist member for Hornsey a few months later, Jones spent his remaining years in parliament. He took an unpaid appointment with the Ministry of Food in 1917 and, after the war, showed a particular interest in London's traffic and transport problems. His <span class="italic">Fleet Street and Downing Street</span>, published in 1919, is a useful source, not only for the origins of popular journalism in Britain, but also for relations between politicians and the press.<br>
<br>Jones died of pneumonia at his home, 123 Victoria Street, London, on 20 October 1921 and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 24 October, after a memorial service at St Margaret's, Westminster. His wife survived him.<br>
