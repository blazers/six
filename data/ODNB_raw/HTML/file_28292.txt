<span class="headword">Villiers, Sir  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1585&#150;1626), <span class="occ">government official and administrator</span>, was the second son of Sir George Villiers and his first wife, Audrey (<i>d</i>. 1587), daughter and heir of William Saunders of Harrington, Northamptonshire. <a name="cosubject_28292"></a><span class="headword">Sir George Villiers</span>  (<em>c.</em>1544&#150;1606) came of a family which had been settled at Brooksby in Leicestershire from at least 1235. A prosperous <span class="occ">sheep farmer</span>, he was the eldest son of William Villiers and Colett, daughter and heir of Richard Clarke of Willoughby, Warwickshire, and widow of Richard Beaumont of Coleorton, Leicestershire. He served as sheriff of Leicestershire in 1591&#150;2, was knighted in 1593, and represented his county in parliament from 1604 until his death on 4 January 1606. He had four daughters from his first marriage and two sons, the eldest of whom, Sir William, obtained a baronetcy in 1619. Sir George's second marriage, about 1590, was to his beautiful but penniless first cousin by the half-blood, Mary (<i>c</i>.1570&#150;1632), daughter of Anthony Beaumont of Glenfield, Leicestershire, with whom he had four children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28299/', "John Villiers, Viscount Purbeck")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28293/', "George Villiers, first duke of Buckingham")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28287/', "Christopher Villiers, first earl of Anglesey")</script>; and Susan Villiers, who married William Feilding, first earl of Denbigh. Sir George's widow was created countess of Buckingham for life on 1 July 1618, and had two more husbands: first Sir William Rayner and then Sir Thomas Compton.<br>
<br>Edward Villiers matriculated as a fellow-commoner from Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1601. About 1612 he married Barbara, one of the daughters of Sir John St John of Lydiard Tregoze in Wiltshire, with whom he had ten children. A captain and muster-master in the Leicestershire militia by 1614, in the following year he resigned his positions after a scandal involving regimental funds. His fortunes were dramatically transformed by the rise to royal favour of his younger half-brother, George. Soon after George Villiers was ennobled, Edward was knighted (7 September 1616), and on 23 December 1617 he became master of the mint at the behest of his brother, who was by then earl of Buckingham. He held this lucrative office, which was thought to be worth between &pound;1500 and &pound;2000 per annum, until August 1619, after which time he shared its duties with another man. At various times between 1618 and 1622 he was tipped to become comptroller of the household, master of the wardrobe, master of the jewel house, and even lord deputy of Ireland, but further preferment temporarily eluded him.<br>
<br>By the early 1620s Villiers was settled in Dean's Close, Westminster, but he also purchased the manor of Baggrave, in his native Leicestershire, for which in October 1620 he paid &pound;6900. He was well able to afford such a sum, for in addition to the income from his office he ruthlessly exploited his kinship with Buckingham for financial gain. For example, in 1620&#150;21 the Irish magnate Richard Boyle paid him &pound;4500 for the earldom of Cork and a viscountcy for his eldest son. Villiers also invested heavily in several projects, most notably the farm for the sole manufacture of gold and silver thread. He sank &pound;4000 into this scheme, for which he derived an annual return of at least &pound;500. This valuable source of income was threatened in August 1619 when several silkmen refused to enter into bonds promising to give over their trade. Villiers urged that they be imprisoned to which the attorney-general, Sir Henry Yelverton, agreed, fearing that to refuse would incur the anger of Buckingham. In November 1620 Villiers persuaded the lord chief justice, Sir Henry Montague, to pay Buckingham &pound;20,000 for the lord treasurer's staff and a peerage. Buckingham was so pleased at this valuable service that he arranged for Villiers and his sons by his wife, Barbara, to be allowed to inherit the title of Viscount Grandison, which on 3 January 1621 was bestowed upon Barbara's childless uncle, Sir Oliver St John.<br>
<br>Villiers was elected to parliament for Westminster in December 1620, undoubtedly on the interest of Buckingham, the borough's high steward, but in the following month he was sent to the Palatinate bearing James I's message of support for his son-in-law, the beleaguered elector, Frederick V. During his absence Villiers was denounced in the Commons for his part in imprisoning those silkmen who had earlier refused to enter into bond. News of this development reached him while he was abroad, and it was only with the greatest reluctance that he crossed the channel. On his return Buckingham advised him not to take his Commons seat until the House of Lords had exonerated him from any ill-dealings. Villiers accordingly delayed his entrance until after Yelverton and the patentees had been examined, but he failed to wait until he was formally cleared and entered the house prematurely on 2 May, prompting calls for him to be ejected. Rather than suffer such an indignity, he withdrew voluntarily. The Commons were finally notified that he had been cleared on 4 June, but on this day parliament adjourned for the summer, so he could not resume his seat until it reassembled in November. In September he was again sent to the Elector Frederick to persuade him to disarm his forces and leave the Dutch army, which he had joined. On his return to England in the following month Villiers reported that his mission had succeeded and that Frederick had agreed to renounce the throne of Bohemia in return for the restoration of the upper Palatinate.<br>
<br>Villiers's financial interests had been damaged by the king's cancellation of the gold and silver thread patent following the parliamentary outcry in 1621. For this reason, in 1622 Buckingham procured for him a 21-year lease of the import duties on gold and silver thread. However, in order to secure this grant Villiers was first required to surrender his co-mastership of the mint. He eventually did this in July 1623, but by then the grant on the import duties had been undermined by the erection of a company of goldwiredrawers. He therefore persuaded the king to grant him office as joint warden of the mint, which was not as lucrative as his previous position, and an annuity of &pound;500. Moreover, he also coerced the new Goldwiredrawers' Company to pay him an additional annuity. Despite these generous arrangements, he resented the new company, and in March 1624, having been once again elected to parliament for Westminster, he helped thwart the Goldwiredrawers' attempt to obtain statutory recognition of their charter, although his call to suppress the indigenous manufacture of gold and silver thread went unheeded.<br>
<br>In April 1625 Villiers and his departmental colleagues were joined in commission to execute the office of master of the mint after the previous incumbent was dismissed. By this time, however, he was no longer much interested in the mint, as he had been promised appointment as lord president of Munster. His letters patent were sealed on 27 May 1625, and orders were given to allow him a lump sum of &pound;3000 as a reward for his former services. He was also granted 500 acres of the Forest of Dean for industrial exploitation. Before leaving England he sold Baggrave and sat in parliament for a third time as member for Westminster. He reached Waterford in October and, lacking an official residence, rented the college of Youghal from the earl of Cork. Early in the new year he endeavoured to billet and clothe survivors of the ill-fated Cadiz expedition whose ships had put in to Youghal. In June 1626 he complained that he had &#145;shipwrecked&#146; his own credit in this service. On 2 September he fell sick at Youghal, possibly from dysentery contracted from those he had sought to assist. He died in the early hours of the morning on the 7th and was buried the following day in the newly built chapel at Youghal. By the terms of his will, drafted on 31 August 1625, he entrusted his estate and the settlement of his debts, which were substantial, to his widow, as his eight surviving children were under age. His eldest son, William, succeeded Sir Oliver St John as second Viscount Grandison in 1630; he was father of Barbara Villiers, duchess of Cleveland. Sir Edward's second and third sons, John and George, succeeded as third and fourth viscounts Grandison; a fourth son, Sir Edward, was father of Edward Villiers, first earl of Jersey. Villiers's widow died in 1672.<br>
