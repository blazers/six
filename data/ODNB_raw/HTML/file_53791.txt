<span class="headword">Ellison, Sir  Gerald Francis</span>  (1861&#150;1947), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 18 August 1861, the second son of Canon Henry John Ellison (1813&#150;1899) and his wife, Mary Dorothy (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Jebb). He was educated at Marlborough College and entered the army in 1882. He passed out from the Staff College, Camberley, in 1889, thereafter holding a series of staff appointments at the War Office and at Aldershot. On 3 January 1894 he married Lilian Amy (1861/2&#150;1949?), only child of Colonel Robert Bruce. They had a son and a daughter. For his services in South Africa during the South African War, Ellison was mentioned in dispatches and awarded the queen's medal with four clasps. He had earlier advertised his status as an outstanding &#145;thinking&#146; soldier by the publication of a book, <span class="italic">Home Defence</span> (1896), which in the previous year had won the gold medal of the Royal United Services Institution.<br>
<br>The defeats and disappointments of the British army at the hands of the Boers prompted a long-overdue radical examination of the army and a series of recommendations for its reform. Ellison played an important part in this exercise, demonstrating outstanding gifts as an administrator. A three-man committee comprising Lord Esher, Admiral Fisher, and Sir George Clarke (later Lord Sydenham) was constituted in November 1903 and given the task of reorganizing the War Office. Ellison was appointed the committee's secretary. In four months the committee produced a whole series of far-reaching recommendations. Clarke, who was later to criticize Ellison, acknowledged the secretary's outstanding contribution to the committee's report. Even more interestingly, R. B. Haldane was to write that &#145;he recognized [Ellison's] hand in much of the Report&#146;  (Haldane, 184). When Haldane was appointed secretary of state for war in the Liberal government in December 1905, Esher counted it &#145;a great stroke&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journals and Letters</span>, 2.126) that they had &#145;nobbled&#146; the minister by persuading him to appoint Ellison as his principal private secretary. Ellison held the post until 1908.<br>
<br>Historians have speculated and disagreed about the precise degree of influence that Ellison exercised over Haldane, and how much he was responsible for the form and content of Haldane's army reforms of 1906&#150;7. Haldane stated in <span class="italic">An Autobiography</span> (1929) that when first he became minister for war, he was &#145;instructed&#146; by Ellison. Also, that Ellison was &#145;one of those who co-operated in advising me&#146; in fashioning the reforms  (Haldane, 184, 189). But neither Ellison in his memoirs nor Haldane suggested that the reforms were based upon ideas supplied by Ellison. This claim was made by Clarke in a letter to Esher: &#145;the whole scheme is from Ellison's book&#146;  (21 March 1906, Esher MSS). Haldane, in a letter to his mother, had described his exact working method. Ellison, he stated, was &#145;an enthusiastic convert to my scheme of reform&#146; and was &#145;working out the details&#146; from notes supplied by Haldane  (29 Jan 1906, Haldane MS 5875, fol. 37). On the available evidence, the fairest conclusion would seem to be that Haldane emphasized the political primacy of economy in his reform measures, which Ellison acknowledges, but &#145;undoubtedly, in a two-way flow of opinions, both men were influenced by each other&#146;  (Spiers, 77).<br>
<br>After leaving Haldane, for the next three years (1908&#150;11) Ellison served as director of army organization at the War Office. Then he was appointed to the staff of General Sir Ian Hamilton, the inspector-general of overseas forces, a position Ellison held until the outbreak of the First World War. Hamilton commented with obvious satisfaction on how the two men &#145;worked hand in glove &hellip; our qualities usefully complement one another&#146;  (Hamilton, 1.7). It was natural that, when Hamilton was given the command of the Dardanelles expedition, he should have asked for the services of Ellison. He needed &#145;an organizer of outstanding calibre&#146; and &#145;a real business man at the head of our mission&#146;  (ibid., 1.280, 2.6). Typically, Kitchener insisted that Ellison could not be spared from staff work at home, but later relented.<br>
<br>The failure of the Dardanelles campaign did not hinder Ellison's career as an outstanding staff officer. With the substantive rank of major-general he served first at Aldershot from 1916 to 1917 and later at the War Office as deputy quartermaster-general and inspector of general communications. In 1923 he was promoted lieutenant-general. His service was recognized by a series of decorations: CB (1904), CMG (1916), KCMG (1919), and KCB (1922). He retired from the army in 1925, shortly thereafter publishing a second book, <span class="italic">The Perils of Amateur Strategy</span> (1926). His costive and discreet &#145;Reminiscences&#146; appeared in thirty parts over an eight-year period in the <span class="italic">Lancashire Lad</span> (1931&#150;9), the journal of the Loyal regiment (North Lancashire), of which he was appointed colonel in 1926.<br>
<br>Ellison, who had been a Royal United Services Institution trustee since 1920, made his home at Canons House, Canon Street, Taunton, where on 28 October 1947 he died of cerebral thrombosis, at the age of eighty-six. Ellison was no flamboyant character. It was his professional competence that inspired the respect and affection of his peers. The importance of the contribution he made to the improvement of the British army in the decade before the First World War deserves to be acknowledged.<br>
