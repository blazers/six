<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Home, Sir  Everard</span>, first baronet  (1756&#150;1832), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born at Hull, Yorkshire, on 6 May 1756, the son of Robert Home (1713&#150;1786), a former army surgeon, of Greenlaw Castle, Berwickshire, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1795), daughter of Colonel Alexander Hutchinson. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13647/', "Robert Home")</script>, the painter, was his brother. Educated at Westminster School where he was a king's scholar, Home gained a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1773, but chose instead to become a surgical pupil of his brother-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14220/', "John Hunter (1728&#150;1793)")</script>, surgeon at St George's Hospital, London. Hunter had married Home's sister Anne [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14215/', "Hunter, Anne")</script>] in 1771 after a seven-year courtship during which Home had come to know him well. Home qualified through the Company of Surgeons in 1778 and was appointed assistant surgeon in the new naval hospital at Plymouth. In 1779 he went to Jamaica as staff surgeon with the army, but on returning to England on half pay in 1784 he rejoined Hunter at St George's as assistant in teaching, research, and clinical practice, living in Hunter's house in Green Street, Leicester Square. He was elected FRS on 15 February 1787 and in the same year he became assistant surgeon at St George's Hospital. For his first published medical work, <span class="italic">A Dissertation on the Properties of Pus</span> (1788), he received the gold medal of the Lyceum Medicum Londinensis, a medical society founded by Hunter and George Fordyce. In 1790&#150;91 Home read lectures for Hunter and in the following year he succeeded Hunter as lecturer in anatomy. Also in 1792 he married Jane Thompson, daughter of the Revd Dr Tunstall, and widow of Stephen Thompson. They lived in Leicester Square near Hunter's house and there were two sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Home joined the army in Flanders in the spring of 1793, but returned just before Hunter's sudden death on 16 October 1793. He then became surgeon at St George's Hospital and was also joint executor of Hunter's will with Matthew Baillie, Hunter's nephew. In 1793&#150;4 they saw Hunter's important work, <span class="italic">On the Blood, Inflammation and Gun-Shot Wounds</span>, through the press and in 1794 Home approached Pitt's government to secure the purchase for the nation of Hunter's large collection of anatomical and pathological specimens. After protracted negotiations the collection was purchased for &pound;15,000 in 1799 and presented to the College of Surgeons. In 1806 the collection was moved from Hunter's gallery in Castle Street to form the Hunterian Museum at the new site of the college in Lincoln's Inn Fields. Home was chief curator and William Clift, who had worked with Hunter since 1792, was retained as resident conservator. Clift also had charge of Hunter's numerous folios, drawings, and accounts of anatomical and pathological investigations, which were essential for a clear understanding of the collection.<br>
<br>In the years following Hunter's death Home built up a large surgical practice and published more than one hundred papers of varying quality, some very good, mainly in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span>. The society awarded him its Copley medal in 1807. He gave the Croonian lectures fifteen times between 1794 and 1826. As Hunter's brother-in-law and executor he had great influence at the Royal College of Surgeons where he was elected to the court of assistants in 1801, an examiner in 1809, master in 1813 and 1821, and its first president in 1822. Having, with Matthew Baillie, endowed the Hunterian oration, he was the first Hunterian orator on 14 February 1814 and again in 1822. He became keeper and a trustee of the Hunterian Museum in 1817 and was professor of anatomy and surgery at the college from 1804 to 1813 and again in 1821. His <span class="italic">Lectures on Comparative Anatomy</span> were published in 1814 with a volume of plates from drawings by Clift. A further volume of lectures followed in 1823 accompanied by microscopical and anatomical drawings by Bauer and Clift. Two more volumes appeared in 1828. This work, although lacking in structure, is an important record of Hunter's investigations, especially the last two volumes.<br>
<br>Home drew heavily on Hunter's work in the papers and books which he published after Hunter's death. Before the collection was presented to the Company of Surgeons in 1799 Home arranged for Clift to convey to his own house Hunter's folio volumes and fasciculi of manuscripts containing descriptions of the preparations and investigations connected with them. He promised to catalogue the collection, refusing help, but, despite repeated requests, only a synopsis appeared in 1818. B. C. Brodie says that Home was busily using Hunter's papers in preparing his own contributions for the Royal Society. Home himself later stated that he had published all of value in Hunter's papers and that his one hundred articles in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> formed a <i>catalogue raison&eacute;e</i> of the Hunterian Museum. Home destroyed most of Hunter's papers in 1823.<br>
<br>A select committee was set up by parliament after Home's death to enquire into the details of this act of vandalism. Clift told this committee in 1834 that Home had used Hunter's papers extensively and had claimed that Hunter, when he was dying, had ordered him to destroy his papers. Yet Home, who was not present at Hunter's death, had kept the papers for thirty years. Clift also declared that he had often transcribed parts of Hunter's original work and drawings into papers which appeared under Home's name. Home produced a few of Hunter's papers which he had not destroyed and Clift had copied about half of the descriptions of preparations in the collection, consequently enough of Hunter's work survives to suggest that Home had often published Hunter's observations as his own. Although the full extent of Home's plagiarism cannot be determined, there is little doubt that it was considerable and this seriously damaged his reputation.<br>
<br>Home's friend Astley Cooper said that he had a good deal of genius and great mental quickness. He was a competent surgeon; his examinations at the college were good and he was an excellent teacher, but his destruction of Hunter's papers was unwise as it led to the unfounded belief that he did nothing himself. Home's best work is in his surgical books, especially his <span class="italic">Practical Observations on the Treatment of Ulcers on the Legs</span> (1797), based on his military experience. In character he was vain, overbearing, and violent in language. He wanted to be recognized as the equal of Hunter and tried without success to fill his place. Yet, although disappointed, he received many honours never accorded to Hunter. In 1808 Home was appointed sergeant-surgeon to George III. He also established a personal friendship with the prince regent who on 2 January 1813 created him baronet. In 1821 Home became surgeon to the Royal Chelsea Hospital and in 1827 he resigned the surgeoncy at St George's Hospital, becoming consulting surgeon. He died in his apartments at Chelsea Hospital on 31 August 1832 and was buried in the hospital burial-ground.<br>
