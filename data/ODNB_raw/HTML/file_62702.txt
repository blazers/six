<span class="headword">Talbot,  James Robert</span>  (1726&#150;1790), <span class="occ">vicar apostolic of the London district</span>, was born at Shrewsbury House, Isleworth, Middlesex, on 28 June 1726, the fourth son in a family of six sons and three daughters of the Hon. George Talbot (<i>d</i>. 1733) and Mary (<i>d</i>. 1752), daughter of Thomas, fourth Viscount FitzWilliam of Merrion. The younger brother of George, fourteenth earl of Shrewsbury, he was educated at Twyford School in Hampshire, a famous Catholic establishment run by the secular clergy, before being sent abroad in 1738 to the English College, Douai.<br>
<br>Ordained at Cambrai on 19 December 1750, Talbot joined the Douai teaching staff as professor of philosophy and later of theology. From his private income, he established a preparatory school at nearby Esquerchin and became its first president. In 1759 Richard Challoner, vicar apostolic of the London district, was taken seriously ill and requested Talbot as coadjutor, hoping that his aristocratic connections would make him an effective intermediary with the government and provide funds for impoverished Catholics. Talbot was consecrated by Challoner on 24 August 1759 as titular bishop of Birtha.<br>
<br>Challoner recovered, but thereafter stayed put, writing devotional and controversial works and ministering to his flock in London. Meanwhile, Talbot carried out episcopal visitations and confirmations throughout the district, covering all parishes every year and earning a reputation for eloquence as a preacher. He was very close to his younger brother, Thomas Joseph Talbot (1727&#150;1795), who in 1766 was appointed coadjutor bishop in the midland district. While being conscientious and devout pastors, both brothers were diffident and fearful of the limelight.<br>
<br>Talbot's proneness to self-effacement was intensified when he became a target of informers, scheming to exploit for gain the widely disregarded penal laws against Catholics. In 1768 Talbot was indicted for the offence of saying mass as a priest, only to be acquitted on a technicality. This did not deter Talbot from founding a Catholic school and mission at Old Hall Green, Hertfordshire, in October 1769. Then in February 1771 he was brought to trial at the Old Bailey alongside John Fuller. The lord chief justice, William Murray, later first earl of Mansfield, threw out the case as no evidence was offered about ordination. Talbot and Fuller were the last Catholic priests in England to be tried for the offence; in 1775, after informers had reported his presence at St Edmund's College, Ware, officials unsuccessfully searched the lofts for him.<br>
<br>The task of lobbying the government to ease civil disabilities against Catholics was undertaken not by Talbot but, from 1778 onwards, by the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/73617', "Catholic Committee")</script>. The committee's efforts secured the passing that year of a limited <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Act</span>, depriving informers of their rewards; that led to the No Popery riots of 1780, instigated by Lord George Gordon. The aged Challoner died shortly afterwards, in 1781, and Talbot succeeded him as vicar apostolic; an inborn lack of decisiveness dogged him for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Talbot corresponded regularly with the president of Douai, William Gibson, over whose regime he had jurisdiction. He took exception successively to the college's curriculum, discipline, and financial extravagance, but he lacked the strength of will to dismiss Gibson. Likewise, he omitted to control the Catholic Committee, which strove to disclaim certain religious tenets which protestants found objectionable and proposed an oath of allegiance to the crown. Unsettled by these moves, which in his view usurped the bishops' functions, in 1787 Talbot joined the committee in the fruitless hope of reining it in. He thought about having a coadjutor appointed, but failed to apply formally to Rome. He moved from London to reside quietly in a convent at Hammersmith; his mind began to fail, and he lost so many teeth that he could scarcely be understood.<br>
<br>Talbot died on 26 January 1790 at the convent, declaring on his deathbed that if he were to recover he would take stern measures against the committee. He was buried at St Paul's, Hammersmith (his remains were reinterred at St Edmund's College, Ware, in 1900). For his piety and his generosity to any number of charities from his inherited wealth he earned the name of the Good Bishop Talbot. His appearance is unknown, as he was too modest to sit for his portrait.<br>
