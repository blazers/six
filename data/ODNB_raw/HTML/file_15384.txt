<span class="headword">Kennedy,  John</span>  (1789&#150;1833), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in Kilmarnock on 3 October 1789, the son of a prosperous hand-loom weaver. After a sound elementary education under a teacher named Thomson he began work with his father. While at his loom, however, during the day he had his book conveniently placed for study, and his evenings also were occupied with literature. From 1807 to 1815 he was in the Royal Ayrshire militia, serving in both Great Britain and Ireland. Having settled again in Kilmarnock he was in frequent collision with the authorities through the vehemence of his political criticisms. In early 1820 he suffered two short periods of imprisonment as a result of his association with radicals who were plotting to muster in arms against the government. Fortunately he managed to prove his innocence.<br>
<br>Eventually Kennedy qualified as a teacher. After a short engagement in Kilmarnock he was appointed schoolmaster at Chapel Green, near Kilsyth, Stirlingshire, where he settled in July 1820 with his young wife, Janet Houston, whom he had married on 14 July. He speedily made a favourable impression as a teacher while, socially, his frankness of utterance both provoked keen opposition and secured him much esteem.<br>
<br>By 1820 Kennedy had published two volumes of verse and poems in several provincial periodicals. In 1826 he published <span class="italic">Fancy's Tour with the Genius of Cruelty, and other Poems</span>. In the leading piece he studies &#145;what man has made of man&#146;, drawing upon sacred and profane history from the time of Cain to that of Claverhouse. Several other poems are noteworthy: that on Horace for its reminiscences and its critical opinions, while that entitled &#145;Andra the Bard&#146; is practically a defence of lowland Scots as a literary instrument. All display satirical force rather than poetical grace.<br>
<br>Kennedy died suddenly at Kilsyth on 4 October 1833, leaving a widow and three daughters, from a family of six, unprovided for. <span class="italic">Geordie Chalmers, or, The Law in Glenbuckie</span>, a satirical novel, was published immediately after his death. Manifestly based on personal experience, this book is valuable as a vivid, if somewhat caustic, delineation of nineteenth-century Scottish rural life.<br>
