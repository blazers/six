<span class="headword">Pearl,  Cora</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Emma Elizabeth Crouch]</span>  (1835?&#150;1886), <span class="occ">courtesan</span>, was the second daughter of the six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45895/', "Frederick William Nicholls Crouch (1808&#150;1896)")</script>, a composer, and his wife, Lydia Pearson, a singer. Her date and place of birth are disputed, as she is believed to have forged her birth certificate, giving the date as 23 February 1842, and the place as Caroline Place, East Stonehouse, Plymouth. It seems likely that she was actually born in London in 1835, the family moving to Plymouth about 1837. Her father, whose most successful composition was &#145;Kathleen Mavourneen&#146;, deserted his family in 1845 and emigrated to the United States in 1849. In 1847 she was sent to a convent school in Boulogne, where she acquired an imperfect command of French. Having returned to England in 1856, she claimed to have been seduced by a diamond merchant in London, and assumed the name Cora Pearl. By 1858 she had returned to France, and engaged in a series of liaisons with notable men in Paris, including Achille Murat, Victor Mass&eacute;na, the prince of Orange, the duc de Mornay, and Gustave Dor&eacute;. The longest of her <i>affaires</i> was with Prince Napol&eacute;on (&#145;Plon-Plon&#146;), who provided her with a house in the rue de Chaillot, known to her admirers as &#145;Les Petites Tuilleries&#146;. She also entertained the prince of Wales on one of his many visits to Paris. Ostentatious and vulgar, she had neither modesty nor restraint; nor did she have any great liking for men, whom she exploited ruthlessly. For a time her taste in clothes and furnishings set the fashion in Paris, her horses and carriage being particularly admired. She was not considered beautiful, having red hair and a round face, from which she acquired her nickname, &#145;La Lune Rousse&#146;, but her figure was accounted exceptional. She had a reputation for offering adventuresome sex to her clients. She made her only stage appearance as Cupid in Offenbach's opera <span class="italic">Orph&eacute;e aux enfers</span>; for her d&eacute;but the theatre, the Bouffes-Parisiennes, was filled with her admirers, including many members of the Jockey Club; but on the twelfth night she was hissed and never returned to the stage. She also had literary ambitions, a story appearing under her name in <span class="italic">Ficelles Litt&eacute;raires</span> in 1868. She herself is recognizable in Ouida's novel <span class="italic">Puck</span> (1870).<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in 1870, Cora Pearl left France for London, but, being refused admission to the Grosvenor Hotel, she returned to Paris where she converted her house into a hospital, tore up her sheets for bandages, and spent large sums of money on the care of the wounded which she hoped, vainly, to recoup from the commissioners. Her lover at this time was Alexandre Duval, the son and heir of a successful butcher and restaurateur, who was reputed to have spent his entire fortune, in the region of 17 million francs, on her. When his money was gone, she dismissed him, and he shot himself, although not fatally, in her house. The resulting scandal caused her to be expelled from France for a time. Despite the large amounts of money that passed through her hands, by 1873 she was in financial difficulties and was obliged to sell her house and its contents. Her last years were lived in increasing poverty, supported by regular but inadequate contributions from members of the Jockey Club. Virtually destitute, she began writing her memoirs, and, following the example of her professional predecessors, Harriette Wilson and Teresia Constantia (Con) Phillips, sent round advance notices to her former clients offering to omit their names in return for payment. The resulting narrative, which used false, but recognizable names, disappointed the prurient in its lack of detail. It was accepted for publication by Jules L&eacute;vy, and was issued four months before her death. She died from cancer, at 8 rue de Bassano, Paris, on 8 July 1886, and was buried in the Batignolles cemetery.<br>
