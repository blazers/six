<span class="headword">Beckett,  Allan Harry</span>  (1914&#150;2005), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, was born on 4 March 1914 at 294 Central Park Road, East Ham, London, the son of George William Harry Beckett, accounting clerk, and his wife, Emma Louise, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stokes. He was originally given the first name Basil, soon changed to Allan. He was educated locally in east London and at London University, where he graduated in engineering. After serving an apprenticeship with Sanders and Foster, steel work and structural engineers, in 1936 he became an engineering assistant with A. J. Brindle, consulting engineers.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 Beckett volunteered for service. In January 1940 he was posted to no. 13 war party for training as a sapper. He was selected as a potential officer and commissioned at no. 2 Railway Training Establishment where he was greatly influenced by Lieutenant-Colonel W. T. Everall, who had gained inventive experience repairing railway bridges, destined to be invaluable in Normandy. Under Everall, Beckett produced drawings and design models for bridging companies in the field and won a reputation for getting things done.<br>
<br>Planning for a return to the continent began after Dunkirk. Winston Churchill must have recalled the landings on open beaches at Gallipoli in 1915. In his historic minute of 30 May 1942 to Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, chief of combined operations, outlining the basic design of a landing dependent on a floating roadway connecting pierheads for unloading cargo vessels that would rise and fall with the tide, he urged that this problem be solved immediately, concluding his note, &#145;Don't argue the matter. The difficulties will argue themselves.&#146; In September 1943 at Quebec the allied high command agreed that the assault across the Channel should take place on a Normandy beachhead not later than May or June 1944. Artificial harbours, codenamed Mulberry, would supply the armies until the great port of Cherbourg should receive troops and their weapons from across the Atlantic.<br>
<br>Much experimentation on the various components was by then in progress, the floating roadway and pierhead taking shape at Wigtown, where the rise and fall of the tide was similar to that in Normandy. As a member of the War Office transportation group, Beckett kept a close eye on developments, which were a well-kept secret. (The supremacy of the Royal Air Force ensured that the Germans gained little knowledge of what was afoot.) In particular he provided technical advice for the two floating roadways known by the codename Whale. Everall was able to design a pontoon bridge able to ride a rough sea without over-stressing any of its components. Beckett was advised by him to strengthen the moorings of the British and American bridges. This led to Beckett's invention of mooring shuttles for severe weather. Known as Camel, they had trumpet-shaped restrainers (later called kite anchors).<br>
<br>In the weeks before D-day the Mulberry components had to be assembled all over the country, ending up at Marchwood, near Southampton, and Richborough (once used by the Romans). On 2 June 1944 Beckett set sail with a tow from the Isle of Dogs and attached himself to 21st army group, the British invading force, as technical adviser in the field. He arrived at Arromanches, the only disturbance being attacks from German E-boats. During the early days of the landings he became concerned about the skill of the American &#145;seabees&#146; who were trying to complete their floating roadways before the British. His advice to anchor them &#145;As tight as a lady's bodice&#146; was ignored. When a storm began to blow on the evening of 19 June a number of caissons and an ill-conceived floating breakwater broke up the American Mulberry, rendering it useless. The British Mulberry now became the only artificial harbour for unloading stores and equipment for the allied forces in the battle area. It continued to be used until Antwerp, the nearest port to the German frontier, had been cleared of mines by 19 November 1944.<br>
<br>Beckett was made a military MBE for his work on the indispensable floating roadways and received a &pound;3000 award for his invention of the kite anchor. With this money he was able to build a house in Farnborough, Kent, where he lived until his death. After being demobilized in 1946 he became a partner with Sir Bruce White, Wolfe Barry &amp; Partners. He now began to play an important role in port construction. He was responsible as senior partner for the development of techniques for the mini hydraulic model studies as a tool for designing new ports and their application for Brunei, Dammam in Saudi Arabia, and Tripoli in Libya. He was responsible for London's flood mitigation proposals including a feasibility study and subsequent design of lifting sector gates for the Thames Barrier.<br>
<br>Beckett married Ida Gwladys James in 1949, and they had two sons, Michael and Tim, and a daughter, Si&acirc;n. Tim Beckett followed in his father's footsteps as a civil engineer. When Allan Beckett retired in 1987 he became consultant to Beckett Rankine, a firm of marine consulting engineers set up by Tim Beckett with Sir Bruce White's grandson, Gordon Rankine. Allan Beckett was himself a keen yachtsman and had kept his boat afloat throughout the war. He liked to sail in the English Channel, exploring the tidal waters. At the same time he kept abreast of engineering developments. In 1977 he had built a cupro-nickel yacht. Even in his early eighties he was experimenting with new types of breakwater and lifesaving equipment. He died at his home, Thistledown, Wood Way, Farnborough Park, of peripheral vascular disease, on 19 June 2005, a year after he had been present at Arromanches for the unveiling of a memorial to the engineers and contractors who were involved in the building of Mulberry. He was buried in Oare churchyard, almost in sight of the Thames estuary where the Whale convoys sailed to the Channel. He was survived by his wife and their three children.<br>
