<span class="headword">Stevens,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1662&#150;1726), <span class="occ">translator and antiquary</span>, was born in London, the son of Richard Stevens, page of the backstairs to Queen Catherine of Braganza. In view of his later statement that he was brought up to speak Spanish from infancy, and given that his father had earlier served the first earl of Clarendon in Madrid, it is likely that his mother was of Spanish origin. Queen Catherine's chapel in London was served by English Benedictines from St Gregory's, Douai, and Stevens is recorded as having attended their school at Douai <i>c</i>.1675. Though his Benedictine education inspired him with a lifelong interest in monastic history, he aspired at first to a military career, and appears to have served in the force sent to quell Monmouth's rebellion  (Murphy, 452). When the second earl of Clarendon was appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland in 1685 Stevens accompanied him to Dublin as one of his gentlemen-at-large. When Clarendon left office in 1686 he recommended Stevens to his brother, Lord Rochester, as &#145;an honest and sober young fellow, and a pretty scholar&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of &hellip; Clarendon</span>, 1.653). On Rochester's nomination Stevens was appointed in January 1687 to be collector of taxes at Welshpool, with a brief covering mid-Wales and the borders. His staunch loyalty to James II made his position there untenable after the revolution of 1688: escaping to France he volunteered enthusiastically for the Jacobite force which landed at Bantry in May 1689. In Dublin, though penniless and abandoned by his former patrons, he eventually obtained a commission in Fitzjames's regiment and served throughout the ensuing war. His journal, not published until 1912, is all the more valuable an eyewitness account for having been written by a Jacobite who was not an Irishman. While admiring the endurance and courage of the Irish rank and file, he was shocked by the irresponsibility of many of the younger officers, Jacobites by convenience, not conviction. His regiment redeemed its flight at the Boyne by a heroic defence of Limerick.<br>
<br>Following the evacuation of the Jacobite forces by the terms of the treaty of Limerick, Stevens found temporary refuge and employment in Lisbon, joining his brother Richard, who accompanied Queen Catherine on her return to Portugal in 1692. By 1695, however, he was back in London, where he settled down to make a living as a professional writer, putting his command of Spanish and Portuguese to practical, though not lucrative, use. His first two publications, translations of works by Manuel de Faria y Sousa and Francisco Manuel de Mello, introduced English readers to Portuguese writing of their own time. The version of de Mello's <span class="italic">Carta de guia de casados</span> (<span class="italic">The government of a wife</span>, 1697) was dedicated to Queen Catherine. Over the next thirty years he published over twenty translations, mainly from the Spanish, in addition to histories of Spain and Portugal and a painstakingly researched Spanish dictionary. He satisfied the contemporary taste for books of travel by making available some of the classics of the <i>conquista</i>: accounts written from an Iberian, rather than an English point of view. Though self-deprecating about his literary style, he produced a lively and successful translation of Quevedo's comic satires. His revision of Shelton's version of <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> gained in accuracy what it lost in artistic unity. He preferred fact to fiction, and required a tale to carry a moral. The austere and devout Quevedo, champion of absolute monarchy, was his favourite writer, and in 1709 he recruited him to the tory cause by translating two of his political works in defence of Dr Henry Sacheverell.<br>
<br>Stevens's only regular paid employment was as editor from 1712 to 1715 of the <span class="italic">British Mercury</span>, a four-page weekly gazette published by the Sun Fire Office as a means of attracting policy holders. His meagre earnings in Grub Street were spent in pursuit of his consuming interest in monastic history. His abridgement in English of Dugdale's <span class="italic">Monasticon Anglicanum</span> (1718) was followed by a two-volume supplement (1722&#150;3), containing some 500 additional monastic charters in English translation. It improved on Dugdale by covering the mendicant orders and including biographical accounts of monastic writers, and for the first time it treated pre- and post-Reformation monastic history as a continuum. Stevens did not attempt the task of historical interpretation (partly to avoid the charge of Catholic bias), and his presentation of the documents in English translation rather than in the original Latin did not please the academic purists (such as Thomas Hearne), but these criticisms are outweighed by the scale of his single-handed achievement as a collector of scattered material who opened up the monastic past to a non-professional readership. He also published translations of Bede's <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical History</span> (1723), and of Louis Al&eacute;mand's <span class="italic">Histoire monastique d'Irlande</span> (1722).<br>
<br>This dedication to scholarship cost Stevens's dependants dear. When he died in London on 27 October 1726 he left his wife and his sister, Catharine Sabina Stevens, with almost no means of support. In February 1729 the <span class="italic">Flying Post</span> reported his widow as being &#145;in the utmost distress&#146;, having been left a legacy of under &pound;20. His surviving manuscripts were purchased from her by his friend John Warburton, the antiquary. Catalogued for the Warburton sale of November 1759, they bear witness to the catholicity of Stevens's antiquarian interests.<br>
