<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gokhale,  Gopal Krishna <span class="st"> [Gopalrao]</span></span>  (1866&#150;1915), <span class="occ">politician and Indian nationalist</span>, was born on 9 May 1866 in Kotluk, a village in the Ratnagiri district of the Bombay presidency, the second son of Krishnarao Shridhar Gokhale (<i>d</i>. 1879), a minor district official from a respected but poor Chitpavan Brahman family, and Valubai, otherwise Satyabhama (<i>d</i>. 1881), the daughter of Bhaskar Pant Oka of the same district. He had four sisters and an elder brother, Govindrao, who supported him through his education after the early death of their father. Gokhale's first arranged marriage took place when he was fifteen but his wife, Savitribai (<i>d</i>. 1891), suffered from &#145;white&#146; leprosy and they did not live together or have children. As was not uncommon, he married a second wife, Radhabai, in 1887; with her he had two daughters, Kashibai and Godavari. Radhabai died in 1900, giving birth to a son who survived only a fortnight.<br>
<br>Gokhale matriculated from a school in Kagal, near Kolhapur, in 1881 and studied successively at Rajaram College, Kolhapur, Deccan College, Poona, and Elphinstone College in the University of Bombay, from which he graduated in 1884 with a second-class BA in mathematics. While considering his future in the light of his financial constraints he undertook coaching and toyed with the idea of entering the Indian Civil Service, or of taking up engineering, and even began (but did not complete) the course for a law degree in Bombay. Finally, in 1885, he decided on teaching and joined the New English School and the Deccan Education Society, which had been founded in Poona by Vishnushastri Chiplunkar and B. G. Tilak. Later in 1885 the society established Fergusson College in Poona as an affiliate of the University of Bombay; there Gokhale taught mathematics, economics, and English literature. In 1886 he became a life member of the Deccan Education Society. In the last years of the 1880s personality differences among the members and division over political and social reform culminated in a split which led to Tilak's departure and to Gokhale's becoming secretary. He dominated the affairs of the society until political commitments led to his withdrawal in 1902 and retirement in 1904, having fulfilled his pledge to serve for twenty years.<br>
<br>Gokhale became involved in the ferment of ideas and activities that distinguished Poona in the 1880s and 1890s. He came under the influence of M. G. Ranade in 1886 and thereafter followed the direction of his interests. Under Ranade's prompting Gokhale became secretary of the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha and editor of its <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal</span> in 1887 and wrote extensive and detailed critiques of the economic issues of the day. For two years from 1886 he contributed to the <span class="italic">Mahratta</span>, an English-language newspaper of the Deccan Education Society, until Tilak took it with him when he left the society. Gokhale also edited from 1888 the English sections of the <span class="italic">Sudharak</span>, a Marathi weekly which promoted a mainly social and religious reformist position, which was opposed by Tilak and many of the city's conservative Brahman &eacute;lite. In the same vein Gokhale delivered his first public speech, &#145;India under British rule&#146;, in Kolhapur in 1886, and first spoke at the Indian National Congress in 1889, where the following year he urged the reduction of salt duties. He was secretary of a regional Congress body, the Bombay provisional conference, in 1893&#150;4, and a joint secretary of the Congress for its 1895 Poona session along with Tilak, whose base in the city enabled him to disrupt the holding of the social conference session immediately afterwards and to assume control of the Sarvajanik Sabha the following year. Gokhale was instrumental in setting up the alternative Deccan Sabha which ensured for him a regional political base, demonstrated by his election to the presidency of the municipality of Poona in 1902&#150;3 and 1905&#150;6. In 1905 he also established the Servants of India Society, an organization of people dedicated to working for the national good as &#145;national missionaries&#146;.<br>
<br>Gokhale moved into the national limelight in 1897 when he gave evidence on Indian administrative costs before the Welby commission in London. While there he denounced the administration's handling of the plague in Poona, but being unable to obtain corroborating evidence he later retracted his statements. The set-back was temporary: elected to the Bombay legislative council in 1899 for Tilak's former seat he moved in December 1901 to the imperial council, where he remained until his death. He quickly developed a reputation as a critic of the annual government budgets and became a focus of an opposition group within the council; his stance was reinforced by his hostility to Curzon's <span class="roman">Universities Bill</span> in 1903&#150;4 and to Minto's measures banning seditious meetings and restricting press freedoms in 1908 and 1910. As a member of the council he accepted nomination as a CIE in 1904, though in 1914 he declined promotion to KCIE. Following the moderate Congress strategy of attempting to influence decision making about India by lobbying in Britain, he toured Britain before the general election in 1905 to promote Indian issues. When the Liberals came into government he visited Britain in 1906 and 1908 to seek to influence the approach of the secretary of state, John Morley, to constitutional reforms. After the implementation of the Morley&#150;Minto reforms in 1909 Gokhale used the new powers available to Indian members in the imperial council to continue his criticism of the budgets and unsuccessfully to introduce measures for compulsory and free elementary education in 1910, 1911, and 1912. In 1912 he was appointed a member of the public services commission, but he died before its report was submitted.<br>
<br>In the early years of the new century Gokhale, Pherozeshah Mehta, and others coalesced as a &#145;moderate&#146; group within Congress, opposed to the &#145;new party&#146; or &#145;extremists&#146; led by Tilak. Differences surfaced over strategies of opposition to Curzon's partition of Bengal. While Gokhale's presidential address to the 1905 Benares Congress accepted boycott as a tactic in extreme situations, others wanted a more general application. The division over this and other issues led to the Congress splitting at the 1907 session at Surat and to the retention of organizational control of Congress by Gokhale, Mehta, and other moderates. By this stage Gokhale's political objectives were clear: accepting the role of providence in ensuring the good of India, he wanted India to be governed on the model of the self-governing colonies of the British empire. He advocated the spiritualization of political life, by which he seems to have meant, since he was initially a rationalist and an agnostic, the application of moral and ethical codes to public work: &#145;Love of country&#146;, he wrote in setting up the Servants of India Society, &#145;must so fill the heart that all else shall appear as of little moment&#146;  (Mathur, 360). His dedication to the national good appealed to M. K. Gandhi, whose activities in South Africa he championed from their first meeting in 1896. Gokhale supported Gandhi's passive resistance in 1909. In 1912 he visited South Africa to reinforce Gandhi's activities, and when Gandhi decided to return to India permanently Gokhale advised him to undertake a year of travel and quiet observation before deciding on his course of action. For Gandhi, Gokhale was his &#145;political guru&#146; and &#145;the most perfect man on the political field&#146;. Gokhale's death in Poona from protracted diabetes-induced asthma on 19 February 1915 left Gandhi free to pursue his own direction. In his lifetime Gokhale's difficult nationalist project was to work within&#151;but certainly never for&#151;the structures of British governance. In the process he opposed government measures and developed a style of nationalist politics based upon a rational and dedicated patriotism whose desired end was secular self-government.<br>
