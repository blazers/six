<span class="headword">Turquand,  William</span>  (1818/19&#150;1894), <span class="occ">accountant</span>, was born in either 1818 or 1819. His father is thought to have belonged to a family of French &eacute;migr&eacute;s who fled from the French Revolution, but no records of his early life have survived. The elder Turquand was one of the first official assignees to be appointed under the <span class="roman">Bankruptcy Act</span> of 1831 (before that he had been a City stockbroker). William also held the post of assignee in 1846&#150;7, at 13 Old Jewry in the City of London, but soon afterwards he set up in private practice. The insolvency connection no doubt continued to be a source of profitable work for his business.<br>
<br>By 1852 Turquand was running a firm of &#145;accountants, arbitrators and referees&#146;  (<span class="italic">Post Office London Directory</span>, 1035) in partnership with a Mr Edwards. This may have been William Edwards (<i>d</i>. 1884), who from 1843 undertook the training of a number of accountants who were later to achieve success in the City. The partnership was short-lived, as about 1856 Turquand merged his share of the practice with that of Youngs &amp; Co. The latter had been established in 1840 by John Young (<i>d</i>. 1888), the son of a farmer of Windmill, near Gordonstown, who had been joined in London by his brother Alexander Young (<i>d</i>. 1907). In 1857 the new firm of Turquand, Youngs &amp; Co. amalgamated with J. E. Coleman &amp; Co. During the 1840s James Edward Coleman had established a considerable reputation as a City accountant and was often appointed by the Bank of England to investigate the solvency of suspect businesses, including Trueman and Cook, colonial brokers. When giving evidence to the select committee on the <span class="roman">Bank Acts</span> (1857&#150;8), Coleman calculated that his twelve largest insolvency assignments in 1857 had liabilities totalling &pound;6,726,840.<br>
<br>The union of the three practices created a firm of considerable eminence under the style Coleman, Turquand, Youngs &amp; Co., with offices in Tokenhouse Yard in the City of London. In 1861&#150;4 Edwin Waterhouse worked as a clerk in their offices to gain experience of accountancy, and recalled how he had initially called &#145;at Mr Turquand's private house in Mansfield Street where I found him busy on some important railway work which had taken one of his partners to America&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 71). In an era before the establishment of professional qualifications for accountants, the partnership established a reputation for probity and, as Waterhouse wrote, gained a number of important clients:<blockquote>I was occasionally sent to the offices of the London &amp; North Western Railway to assist in Mr Coleman's work as a public accountant in the service of the auditors. Mr Coleman was connected also with the London, Chatham &amp; Dover Railway, then carrying out its metropolitan extensions, and I gained not a little experience in examining into the trade claims for loss of business on change of premises. (ibid., 74)</blockquote>When Coleman retired, shortly after the merger, Turquand became the senior partner; expansion resulted in a new style, Turquand, Youngs, Weise, Bishop, and Clarke, which led <span class="italic">The Accountant</span> (15 December 1888) to comment that this was &#145;one of the largest firms of its kind in London, indeed the world&#146;.<br>
<br>Turquand rose to prominence because of his abilities as a liquidator, a fact recognized in his appointment, in 1866, as joint liquidator of Overend, Gurney &amp; Co. The 1867 report from the select committee on <span class="roman">Limited Liability Acts</span> calculated that Coleman, Turquand, Youngs &amp; Co. were currently winding up twenty-nine of the 259 companies then in liquidation and that this represented &pound;18.4 million of the &pound;92.1 million involved. In 1877 Turquand observed that he personally had been responsible for the liquidation of sixty-two businesses, among which were the West of England Bank, London and Colonial Bank, London and Scottish Bank, British Provident Insurance Company, Commercial and General Assurance Company, Defender Assurance Company, and Leeds Banking Company, while his firm had administered a further 140. These included the Albert Insurance Company, Collies of London, and the European Insurance Company, which took more than twenty clerks and assistants five years to complete.<br>
<br>The firm prospered under Turquand's leadership and its fee income rose from &pound;19,627 in 1859 to &pound;36,072 in 1873, although the importance of the Overend Gurney assignment revealed itself in a peak of &pound;90,287 in 1868. The partnership was not so successful during the 1880s, when its fee income levelled at about &pound;27,000&#150;&pound;28,000 per annum. By this time auditing was assuming a greater importance, but Turquand was reluctant to undertake this work and left most audit appointments to his fellow partners. John Young, for example, audited the Caledonian Railway, the Cambrian Railways, and the Great Western Railway of Canada.<br>
<br>In 1855 Turquand took part in an important legal case, <i>Royal British Bank v. Turquand</i>, which helped to establish the principle that a third party in dealing with a company need not examine its internal organizational rules in order to ensure that officers have authority for such dealings. Based upon his commercial standing in the City, Turquand assumed a leading position in the accountancy profession, and became the first president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales upon its formation in 1880. He had been a leading member of the Institute of Accountants in London from its foundation in 1870, when he was elected its vice-president. On the retirement of William Quilter in 1877, Turquand succeeded him as president. He gave evidence to the 1877 select committee on the <span class="roman">Companies Acts</span> of 1862 and 1867, but during the 1880s took a lesser role in the profession's affairs. <span class="italic">The Accountant</span> (31 March 1894, 291) described him as &#145;a perfect gentleman, with not only the best reputation out of his office, but &hellip; in it&#146;.<br>
<br>Turquand had a wife called Ada, but nothing else is known about his domestic life. He died aged seventy-five, on 20 March 1894, at his home, 20 Norfolk Street, Park Lane, London.<br>
