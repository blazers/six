<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pratt,  Hodgson</span>  (1824&#150;1907), <span class="occ">peace campaigner and co-operative movement activist</span>, born at Bath on 10 January 1824, was the eldest of five sons of Samuel Peace Pratt and his wife, Susanna Martha Hodgson (<i>d</i>. 1875). After education at East India College, Haileybury, where he won a prize for an English essay in his first term, he matriculated at London University in 1844. In 1847 he joined the East India Company's service at Calcutta. In 1848 he became assistant magistrate and collector at Murshidabad, and the following year he married Sarah Caroline Wetherall, daughter of an Irish squire. In 1851 he was superintendent of the land revenue survey of Monghyr, in 1853 he was joint magistrate and deputy collector there, and in 1854 he became under-secretary to the government of Bengal and inspector of public instruction there.<br>
<br>Following Sir Charles Wood's establishment of national education for India, Pratt became inspector of public instruction for the lower provinces. He was concerned to stimulate the educational and social development of the province of Bengal, and urged on the Bengalis closer relations with British life and thought. In 1851 he helped to found the Vernacular Literature Society, which published Bengali translations of standard English literature, including Macaulay's <span class="italic">Life of Clive</span>, <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span>, Lamb's <span class="italic">Tales from Shakespeare</span>, and selections from the <span class="italic">Percy Anecdotes</span>. Pratt acted as the society's secretary until 1856. He also started a school of industrial art in Calcutta. In 1857 Pratt was at home on leave and at the close of that year he contributed to <span class="italic">The Economist</span> articles and letters dealing with Indian questions, social, political, educational, and religious, which were published collectively in a pamphlet. He founded, with Mary Carpenter, the National Indian Association, supporting nationalist demands for self-government, and remained closely involved with it until 1905. The spread of the Indian mutiny recalled Pratt hurriedly to India, which he left finally in 1861; he resigned from the Indian Civil Service in 1863.<br>
<br>On settling in Britain, Pratt immediately threw himself into the industrial co-operative movement, in association with Edward Vansittart Neale and George Jacob Holyoake. He was a member of the first central board of the modern co-operative movement and, with Thomas Hughes, was a guarantor of the London Co-operative Agency, established to supply wholesale to southern co-operative societies. In 1874 he helped to establish a London branch of the Co-operative Wholesale Society and throughout the 1870s and 1880s he worked to found new stores and societies in metropolitan and suburban London. Pratt was elected chairman of the council of the Guild of Co-operators (1878), established to disseminate co-operative knowledge, and later succeeded Benjamin Jones as its secretary. Pratt originated the idea of the International Co-partnership Alliance, supported the Labour Co-partnership Association, founded the Co-operative Permanent Building Society in 1884, and advocated the formation of a co-operative college to provide craft, technical, and academic education.<br>
<br>In 1864 Pratt met Henry Solly and became a member of the council of the Working Men's Club and Institute Union (founded by Solly in June 1862). In its interest he travelled up and down the country, encouraging struggling branches and forming new ones. He was president from 1885 to 1902. With Solly he also started trade classes for workmen in St Martin's Lane, London, in 1874. In 1867 he was a vice-president with Auberon Herbert, W. E. Forster, George Joachim Goschen, and others of the Paris excursion committee, through whose efforts over 3000 British workmen visited the Paris Exhibition of that year.<br>
<br>At the same time Pratt, who had a perfect command of French, was an ardent champion of international arbitration. On the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 he pleaded for a peaceful settlement of the dispute. Two years later he joined in an appeal to M. Thiers, the French premier, for the release of Elis&eacute;e Reclus, the geographer, who had supported the commune and been taken prisoner. In 1880 he joined William Phillips and others in founding the International Arbitration and Peace Association, and became first chairman of the executive committee. Four years later (1 July 1884) he founded, and for some time edited, the association's <span class="italic">Journal</span> (later entitled <span class="italic">Concord</span>). On behalf of the association he visited nearly all the countries of Europe and helped in the formation of many kindred continental societies&#151;in Belgium, Italy, Germany, Austria, and Hungary. He took part in many international peace congresses at Paris and elsewhere from 1889 onwards. For the association Pratt produced translations of works by Elie Ducommun and Descamps, published respectively as <span class="italic">The Programme of the Peace Movement</span> (1896) and (summarized in English) <span class="italic">The Organisation of International Arbitration</span> (1897).<br>
<br>Notwithstanding his disinterested and retiring disposition, Pratt's persuasive advocacy of international arbitration and industrial co-operation was appreciated by governments and peoples at home and abroad and he was recommended for the Nobel peace prize in December 1906. He was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, vice-president of the National Association for the Promotion of State Colonisation (1886) the Sunday Society, and the Workmen's Peace Association, and an executive member of the Travelling Tax Abolition Committee.<br>
<br>In 1892 Pratt married his second wife, Monica, daughter of the Revd James Mangan DD LLD. He spent the last years of his life at Le Pecq, Seine et Oise, France, and died at his home, 12 avenue du Pavillon, Sully-Le-Pecq, on 26 February 1907. His wife and their daughter survived him. He was buried in Highgate cemetery. The Hodgson Pratt memorial fund was established in 1910, awarding annual scholarships to the co-operative college and prizes for essays on peace; an annual Hodgson Pratt memorial lecture was also founded.<br>
