<span class="headword">Rook,  Arthur James</span>  (1918&#150;1991), <span class="occ">dermatologist and author</span>, was born on 15 May 1918 at Cobham, Surrey, the elder child of Sir William James Rook (1885&#150;1958) and his first wife, Millicent, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Baker (1888&#150;1939). His father, a successful sugar broker, was knighted for his services as director of sugar at the Ministry of Food during the Second World War. Rook and his younger sister, Constance, were therefore born into a well-to-do family. At Charterhouse (which he attended from 1931 to 1936) early prowess at languages gained him entry to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he changed to medicine. From there he went to do his clinical studies at St Thomas's Hospital, London, graduating MB BChir in 1942. On 11 July 1942 he married (Frances) Jane Elizabeth Knott (1920&#150;1990), a physiotherapist, and daughter of Frank Alexander Knott, a doctor. Together they made a perfect pair. They had three sons: a farmer, a professor of microbiology, and a queen's counsel.<br>
<br>From 1942 to 1946 Rook did military service in the RAF, rising to the rank of squadron leader. He then returned to St Thomas's Hospital to join the inspiring team of G. B. Dowling and H. J. Wallace in the dermatology department. During these training years he spent a formative six months at the H&ocirc;pital St Louis in Paris, and also wrote important clinical papers (on keratoacanthoma, and blistering eruptions, the subject of his MD thesis in 1950). In 1950 he was appointed as a consultant dermatologist at Cardiff Royal Infirmary, and then in 1953 he moved to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, where he spent the rest of his working life. The family lived in Cambridge, and also for many years in a moated house in Steeple Bumpstead, Essex, where many enjoyed their hospitality.<br>
<br>Rook was a prodigious worker; he quickly acquired a very wide experience and knowledge of all aspects of dermatology, and was much admired by patients and colleagues. Even with all his other interests clinical dermatology remained uppermost for him. But added to this he had a great breadth of knowledge of all aspects of medicine and of the biological sciences, coupled with a superb memory. Apart from his excellence as a clinician his major contribution was as a disseminator of this knowledge. He was in the forefront of those who appreciated the importance of the advances in science to dermatology, and also the important messages that clinical dermatology had for basic scientists. This influence was conveyed in many ways. His teaching, mainly of postgraduates, was inspiring: always some new light cast on a clinical situation and with an infectious sense of the excitement of it all. He was quiet in manner and speech, never flamboyant, and with an engaging smile and sense of humour. He was always generous with his time and resources. His correspondence was voluminous and international. From 1958 he organized courses for trained and for trainee dermatologists at a time when such courses were an exciting novelty.<br>
<br>Where Rook truly excelled was as an author and editor. Early in the 1960s he started to collect material for a textbook of paediatric dermatology. He found he had so much material that it could readily be expanded into a major book covering all aspects of dermatology. With Dr D. S. Wilkinson and Professor F. J. G. Ebling, a zoologist, as co-editors, the <span class="italic">Textbook of Dermatology</span> first appeared in 1968. Rook himself wrote about a third of the 2000 pages. This book quickly established itself as one of the most important sources for trainee and practising dermatologists, as well as for other physicians and scientists. Rook spoke or read several languages, and always insisted that coverage of the literature must be multilingual. His worldwide reputation was affirmed by the eighteen foreign societies which honoured him as an honorary member or in other ways. The <span class="italic">Textbook</span> went through six editions before the end of the century, for four of which he remained the senior editor. By its sixth edition it had grown to 4000 pages in four volumes.<br>
<br>Not content with one major work, Rook co-authored or edited several other books on clinical dermatology. These included monographs on hair and on botanical dermatology. He was a distinguished editor of the <span class="italic">British Journal of Dermatology</span>, which he transformed. Later he was president of the British Association of Dermatologists, at whose annual meetings the Arthur Rook oration became the principal guest lecture. He also had a great interest in the history of medicine and wrote, with Graham Cannon and Margaret Carlton, the definitive <span class="italic">History of Addenbrooke's Hospital</span> (1991). His portrait, painted by Patrick Phillips in 1974, hangs in the British Association of Dermatologists House, Fitzroy Square, London.<br>
<br>Rook largely retired from clinical practice in 1977 because of Parkinson's disease. This, and his wife's long terminal illness, marred his latter years, but did not stop his writing activities. He died of a heart attack in Cambridge on 30 July 1991, and was cremated at Putney Vale crematorium in London. He was survived by his three sons.<br>
