<span class="headword">Seeley,  Robert Benton</span>  (1798&#150;1886), <span class="occ">publisher and author</span>, was born in Ave Maria Lane, London, and baptized on 30 March 1798 at St Faith's under St Paul's. He was the third of the twelve children of Leonard Benton Seeley, bookseller and publisher, and his wife, Harriet. His parents had come from Buckingham, where his grandfather had sold books since at least 1744. Leonard Benton Seeley's London business, established in 1784, acted as agent for the British and Foreign Bible Society in its early days, and served the more general literary demands of the evangelical community. Robert Seeley entered the business as a child, and continued the family religious tradition when he took control of the Crane Court shop in 1826 in partnership with William Burnside, later moving the business to Fleet Street. About 1830 he married Mary Anne Jackson (1809&#150;1868), also &#145;an earnest evangelical&#146;  (Wormell, 5), whose brother John Henry Jackson was one of the partners in Seeley, Jackson and Halliday; they had four daughters and six sons. The firm established a reputation for &#145;taste and elegance&#146; (<span class="italic">Publishers' Circular</span>, 15 June 1886, 601&#150;2; Seeley was among the founders of that periodical). Both Daniel and Alexander Macmillan worked for him and Burnside during the 1830s, before starting their own firm. The <span class="italic">Christian Guardian</span> and the publications of the Church Missionary Society, as well as numerous theological books, appeared under their imprint.<br>
<br>Seeley's theology was a premillenarian eschatology and his church party evangelical; his party politics were tory. His authorship centred on history and theology. In 1834 <span class="italic">Essays on the Church by a Layman</span> argued that scriptural authority justified the established church: &#145;As [God] gave [England] a pure and scriptural church at first; gave he also wealth, and power, and prosperity, as a closely-connected consequence&#146;  (cited in Lewis, <span class="italic">Lighten their Darkness</span>, 22). Other works were evangelical biographies, such as his lives of Hannah More (1838), John Newton (1843), and Henry Martyn (1855). A leading figure in the Christian Influence Society in the 1830s and 1840s, he helped found the Church Pastoral Aid Society in 1837 and the Society for Improving the Condition of the Labouring Classes in 1844, and supported Shaftesbury's campaign for factory acts. Seeley opposed economic liberal ideas such as <i>laissez-faire</i>: he believed they impugned the character of God.<br>
<br>Seeley remained active in the publishing business until 1857, when it was taken over by his second son, Richmond Seeley. Robert Benton Seeley then embarked on an unsuccessful venture as newspaper proprietor in partnership with his eldest son, <a href="#cosubject_25026">Leonard Benton Seeley [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Also during these retirement years he wrote a popular history of the life and reign of Edward I, <span class="italic">The Greatest of All the Plantagenets</span> (1860; rev. edn, 1872), a work that, with his biographical writing, may have influenced his third son, the historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25025/', "Sir John Robert Seeley (1834&#150;1895)")</script>. His influence has also been traced to John Ruskin's knowledge of the &#145;condition of England question&#146;  (Harris, 13). Robert Benton Seeley died at his home, 59 Hilldrop Crescent, Camden Road, London, on 31 May 1886.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_25026"></a><span class="headword">Leonard Benton Seeley</span>  (1831&#150;1893), <span class="occ">barrister and writer</span>, was Robert Benton Seeley's eldest son. He was educated at City of London School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1852 and MA in 1855. He was elected fellow of Trinity College in 1854 and called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in the following year. He practised as a conveyancer and equity draftsman, and in addition from 1862 to 1869 he was professor of modern history at Bedford College for Women, London. He wrote a number of popular biographies including <span class="italic">Horace Walpole and his Works</span> (1884), <span class="italic">Fanny Burney and her Friends</span> (1890), and <span class="italic">Mrs Thrale, afterwards Mrs Piozzi: a sketch of her life and passages from her diaries, letters &amp; other writings</span> (1891). He died of a heart attack in the open street across from Chancery Lane, London, on 30 October 1893, leaving a widow, Caroline Blackwell Seeley.<br>
