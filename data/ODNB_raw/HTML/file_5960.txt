<span class="headword">Collins,  William Lucas</span>  (1815&#150;1887), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was born at Oxwich, Glamorgan, where he was baptized on 23 May 1815, the only son of Revd John Collins (<i>d</i>. 1854), rector of Ilston, Nicholaston, and Penrice, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lucas. He was educated at Rugby School (1829&#150;33), among the first generation of pupils under Thomas Arnold, and at Jesus College, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1833, gaining second-class honours in classics in 1838, and graduating BA in 1838 and MA in 1840. Ordained in 1840, he was presented in the same year to the crown living of Cheriton, Glamorgan, which he held until 1867. On 9 April 1840 he married Anna Frances, daughter of John Wood of Berth-lwyd, near Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire. Their eldest son, Clifton Wilbraham Collins, was born in 1844.<br>
<br>Collins served as curate at Great Houghton, Northamptonshire (1853&#150;62), where he lived at the rectory and became a diocesan inspector of education. In 1867 he was presented by Francis Jeune, the low-church bishop of Peterborough, to the living of Kilsby, Northamptonshire. He exchanged this for the rectory of Lowick, near Thrapston, Northamptonshire, in 1873, which from 1876 he held in combination with the vicarage of Slipton. From 1870 he held an honorary canonry at Peterborough Cathedral.<br>
<br>As well as being a country parson Collins had a literary career, which began soon after his ordination when he became a regular contributor to <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>. His early articles were on university life, but he came to make a speciality of articles on the ancient public schools, his <span class="italic">Etoniana</span> being published separately in 1865 followed by <span class="italic">The Public Schools</span> (1867). The latter, a self-conscious attempt to record the traditions and history of the &#145;Clarendon&#146; schools on the eve of changes in their government and character, is notable for its revisionist account of Arnold's influence at Rugby, Collins taking issue with Arnold's liberal eulogists, whom he thought had unfairly denigrated the latter's predecessors. He also assigned importance to the example of Spencer Thornton, an evangelical schoolboy contemporary. John Blackwood encouraged him to take up reviewing; his perceptive reviews of George Eliot's novels were his most significant work. He also edited for Blackwoods a successful series, <span class="roman">Ancient Classics for English Readers</span>, to which he contributed several volumes, including those on Homer's <span class="italic">Iliad</span> (1870) and Thucydides (1878). Collins died at Lowick rectory on 24 March 1887 and was survived by his wife.<br>
