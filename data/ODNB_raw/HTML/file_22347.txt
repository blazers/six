<span class="headword">Pix <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Griffith]</span>,  Mary</span>  (<em>c.</em>1666&#150;1709), <span class="occ">playwright and novelist</span>, probably born in Nettlebed, Oxfordshire, was the daughter of Roger Griffith and his wife, Lucy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Berriman. Her father may have been the Revd Roger Griffith who was vicar of Padbury and headmaster of the Royal Latin School in Buckingham, but this cannot be proved. Her mother came from Soundess in the parish of Nettlebed, Oxfordshire. Her parents were both English. Giles Jacob commented that Mary &#145;by her Mother's side was descended from a very considerable family, that of the <i>Wallis's</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Poetical Register</span>, 1719, 1.203), but there is no other evidence of this connection. From 1684 she seems to have lived in London and on 25 July 1684 she married George Pix (<i>b</i>. 1660), a merchant tailor from Hawkhurst, Kent, at the church of St Benet Fink, London. There is record of the baptism of a son, George, on 26 June 1689 at Hawkhurst. He appears to have died the following year. There may have been at least one other child of the marriage, as there is a baptismal record of a William Pix, son of George and Mary, in 1691 at St Andrew's, Holborn, in London.<br>
<br>Mary Pix was a prolific playwright. Between 1696 and 1706 seven plays bear her name, either in the dedication of the printed play text, or on the title-page. A further five anonymous texts are now generally attributed to her by critics  (<span class="italic">Plays</span>, lix&#150;lxi). Her first published work, however, was a novel, <span class="italic">The Inhumane Cardinal, or, Innocence Betrayed</span> (1696). The plot conforms to the contemporary conventions of the genre, featuring the seduction of an innocent girl by a cynical older man, aided by a treacherous older woman. Steeves describes this novel as a &#145;masterpiece of faulty plot construction&#146;  (ibid., xii). Pix's writing skills were more suited to drama. In the same year, she had two plays produced on the London stage: a tragedy, <span class="italic">Ibrahim, the Thirteenth Emperour of the Turks</span>, performed by Christopher Rich's patent company at Drury Lane, followed by a comedy, <span class="italic">The Spanish Wives</span>, at Dorset Gardens Theatre, also by Rich's company.<br>
<br>Pix's next comedy, <span class="italic">The Innocent Mistress</span>, was staged in 1697 by the rival theatre company run by Thomas Betterton at Lincoln's Inn Fields. It is possible that this move was connected to Pix's dispute with one of Rich's leading actors, George Powell, who plagiarized her play <span class="italic">The Deceiver Deceived</span>, producing his own version entitled <span class="italic">The Imposture Defeated, or, A Trick to Cheat the Devil</span> (1697). <span class="italic">The Deceiver Deceived</span> was staged later in the season at Lincoln's Inn, introduced by an indignant prologue by Pix, which focused on the theft of her work. Charles Gildon, a contemporary critic, was of the opinion that Mrs Pix's version was superior: &#145;I think the Scene where the Blind Man's Wife make's Love before his Face, is better manag'd in Mr. <i>Powel</i>'s Play, than here, tho' in general, this is the better Play&#146;  (Gildon, 178). Pix was evidently supported by William Congreve in this controversy, as he is described in a contemporary account as leading a group of actors and friends to heckle a performance of Powell's play: &#145;they fell all together upon a full cry of Damnation, but when they found the malicious Hiss would not take, this very generous, obliging Mr. <i>Congreve</i> was heard to say, <i>We'll find out a New way for this Spark</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Animadversions on Mr. Congreve's Late Answer to Mr. Collier</span>, 1698, 34). Pix was to remain loyal to Betterton's company for the rest of her writing career.<br>
<br>A further five tragedies and three comedies are attributed to Pix. The last of these, a three-act comedy entitled <span class="italic">The Adventures in Madrid</span>, was produced about June 1706 at the Queen's Theatre, Haymarket. Her only other literary work, apart from a few minor pieces of poetry, was <span class="italic">Violenta, or, The Rewards of Virtue: Turn'd from Boccacce into Verse</span> (1704). This is an interpretation in verse of the eighth book of the second day of Boccaccio's <span class="italic">Decameron</span>. It is not clear whether Pix translated from the original Italian, or used an English edition.<br>
<br>Although her plays were less popular than those by some of the other professional women playwrights of this period, notably Aphra Behn and Susanna Centlivre, Pix achieved moderate success. Two of her plays, <span class="italic">Ibrahim</span> and <span class="italic">The Spanish Wives</span>, were revived well into the eighteenth century. Her comedies are generally ingeniously plotted, if somewhat conventional in characterization and theme. Her tragedies rely heavily on extravagant emotional rhetoric, well suited to actresses such as Elizabeth Barry, who played many leading roles for Pix. As an anonymous contemporary critic observed, Pix was sometimes unable to master the technicalities of blank verse: &#145;some of her Verses are worse than Prose, she knows not what Scanning means, nor did she ever use her Ear to judge of their awkard [<i>sic</i>] running&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Comparison between the Two Stages</span>, 1702, 82). Gildon, however, while acknowledging that <span class="italic">Ibrahim</span> may lack &#145;the Harmony of Numbers&#146;, credits the play with &#145;a Quality, that at least ballances that Defect, I mean the Passions&#146;  (Gildon, 111). Although her work preserves contemporary dramatic conventions of plotting and characterization, it frequently gives a stronger emphasis to the female perspective than was the norm in this period. None the less, her female characters are almost always polarized into one of two stereotypes: weak women who are easily manipulated by men, or sexually experienced viragos. She supported the general trend towards reforming the perceived immorality of the stage at the end of the seventeenth century, claiming in the prologue to <span class="italic">The False Friend, or, The Fate of Disobedience</span> (1699)<blockquote>
<div>Amongst Reformers of this Vitious Age,<br>
</div>
<div>Who think it Duty to Refine the Stage:<br>
</div>
<div>A Woman, to Contribute, does Intend.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Her plays are not overtly political in subject matter, but she often tacitly endorses whig political theory in her tragedies by presenting a critique of the destructive nature of arbitrary tyranny. Her work frequently depicts the &#145;citizen&#146; class, or bourgeoisie, in a favourable light, marking the transition towards a more sympathetic portrayal of the city in drama in the eighteenth century.Pix appears to have been generally well liked. She features in a number of contemporary accounts, usually characterized as fond of food and wine, and consequently rather rotund in build. In 1697 an anonymous play, <span class="italic">The Female Wits</span>, was staged at Drury Lane, satirizing Pix, Catharine Trotter, and Delarivier Manley, who had all recently come to prominence as playwrights. While the portraits of Trotter and Manley are malicious, that of Pix is less so. Mrs Wellfed, the Pix persona, is described in the cast list as &#145;a fat Female Author, a good sociable well-natur'd Companion, that will not suffer Martyrdom rather than take off three Bumpers in a Hand&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Female Wits</span>, 1704). There is some evidence that she was a friend of Elizabeth Barry, as she is linked with the actress in <span class="italic">The Players Turn'd Academicks</span> (1703).<br>
<br>Mary Pix died in 1709, and was probably buried on 19 May, as there is a burial record on that date for a &#145;Mrs. Mary Picks&#146; in the parish register of St Clement Danes Church, London. Advertisements appeared in the <span class="italic">Post Boy</span> of 26&#150;28 May and the <span class="italic">Daily Courant</span> of 25 May 1709 for a special performance of Centlivre's play <span class="italic">The Busie-Body</span>, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London, for the benefit of Pix's estate. She does not appear to have left any children.<br>
<br>Mary Pix's writings have not been the focus of much critical attention since her death. She is not included in John Duncombe's famous encomium to accomplished women, <span class="italic">The Feminiad</span>, (1754) nor in <span class="italic">Biographium faemineum</span> (1766). Where she is mentioned in general histories of the stage, her work is often dismissed as mediocre, as in Charles Dibdin's evaluation: &#145;all her productions &hellip; were too slight to be permanent&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Complete History of the English Stage</span>, 1797, 4.345). Her drama was championed, however, by John Doran in the nineteenth century, who asserted that her comedies are &#145;full of life&#146; and her tragedies &#145;more than brimful of loyalty&#146;, adding &#145;later dramatists have not disdained to pick up some of Mrs. Pix's forgotten incidents&#146;  (<span class="italic">&#145;Their Majesties' Servants&#146;: Annals of the English Stage from Thomas Betterton to Edmund Kean</span>, 1888, 1.242). In the late twentieth century, interest revived in early modern women writers, but the work of Mary Pix has still not received as much attention as that of some of her contemporaries. Her skill as a dramatist, especially in her comedies, has yet to be fully appreciated.<br>
