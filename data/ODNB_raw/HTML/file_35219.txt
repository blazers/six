<span class="headword">Newsam, Sir  Frank Aubrey</span>  (1893&#150;1964), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, the third son of William Elias Newsam and his wife, Alice Mary Chambers, was born on 13 November 1893 in Barbados, where his father held a modest civil service post. From Harrison College, Barbados, he went to St John's College, Oxford, in 1911, with an open scholarship in classics. After taking his degree in 1915, with second classes in classical moderations and <i>literae humaniores</i>, he was commissioned in the Royal Irish regiment and later served with the 1st battalion 30th Punjabis. He saw active service in Ireland (where he was wounded in the Easter rising), Belgium, France, the Punjab, and Afghanistan. He was awarded the MC and was mentioned in dispatches. On demobilization he taught classics at Harrow for a short time; and then in July 1920, having passed the civil service examination, he joined the Home Office.<br>
<br>Newsam began in the children's division. Although this was perhaps the one division in the Home Office least suited to his taste, his energy and strong personality soon made an impression. His career followed an unusual pattern. In 1924 the permanent under-secretary of state&#151;the formidable Sir John Anderson&#151;chose him as his private secretary, came to trust him, kept him in that post for three years after his promotion to principal in 1925, and then appointed him as principal private secretary to the home secretary. Newsam held this key post for five years, serving Sir William Joynson-Hicks, J. R. Clynes, Sir Herbert Samuel, and Sir John Gilmour. As Anderson, who was clearly destined for greater things, devoted more and more of his time to non-Home Office matters, and as he was succeeded in 1932 by a Treasury nominee who knew little of the Home Office, Newsam became a powerful and authoritative figure at the centre of the office. He also learned a good deal about the ways of politicians and parliament.<br>
<br>Newsam at last returned to ordinary divisional duties in 1933 as assistant secretary in charge of a new division. For a start, he handled the controversial bill which became the <span class="roman">Betting and Lotteries Act 1934</span>, but his main task was to address the problems caused by the disorders resulting from the activities of the British Fascists. He had a large responsibility for the <span class="roman">Public Order Act 1936</span>, which proved to be effective. In 1938 he moved to head the criminal division and set about preparing a major criminal justice bill, which in the event had to be put off until 1948.<br>
<br>At the beginning of the war Newsam, now an assistant under-secretary of state, went for a few months to Tunbridge Wells as the principal officer to the regional commissioner located there, but was brought back to take overall charge of the criminal and aliens divisions. Then in April 1941 he was promoted to be the deputy under-secretary of state with special responsibility for security. The permanent under-secretary of state, Sir Alexander Maxwell, was totally unlike Newsam in character, but they worked well together, especially over the detention of suspect British subjects and aliens under defence regulation 18B and the wartime aliens order. When the Americans came into the war Newsam took the lead in negotiations about handling criminal offences by members of the US forces, resulting in the <span class="roman">United States of America (Visiting Forces) Act 1942</span>. Finally, as the war came to an end, he worked hard and effectively on the restoration of the Channel Islands after the German occupation.<br>
<br>The police service, however, was becoming Newsam's prime interest. There were too many small police forces unable to provide the specialist services which were increasingly needed. Following some rolling up under wartime powers, the <span class="roman">Police Act 1946</span> abolished, at a stroke, nearly all non-county borough forces, and made provision for further amalgamations. Separate from this, Newsam headed a committee of police and local authority representatives studying the whole future shape of the service. In particular he secured agreement on new schemes of training for all recruits and on setting up a new national staff college, this last project becoming something of a personal crusade. It gave him great satisfaction to secure for the college's permanent home a magnificent house at Bramshill, near Hartley Wintney, with enough land for new buildings. In 1947 he was the first chairman of the board of governors, and kept this post for the rest of his career.<br>
<br>In 1948 Newsam succeeded Maxwell as head of the office. The home secretary at the time was Chuter Ede. He had already seen a good deal of Newsam, and concurred in his promotion. But the two men were utterly unlike, and Ede did not altogether trust Newsam's judgement. Although there was no open falling out Ede saw to it that he remained firmly in charge, and the relationship, for three years, was a somewhat uneasy one. Newsam got on well with three other home secretaries under whom he served&#151;Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, Gwilym Lloyd-George, and R. A. Butler. Newsam was a man of action, and ready when necessary to give tough advice and to take tough decisions. But on the fundamental issue which underlies so much of the work of the Home Office&#151;the balance between public order and individual liberty, between the powers of the state and the interests of the citizen&#151;in the end, like his predecessor, he would always tend towards seeking a liberal solution.<br>
<br>A principal concern throughout was advising the home secretary on capital cases. Newsam was gravely concerned when Maxwell-Fyfe, contrary to his recommendation, decided to let the law take its course in the case of Derek Bentley. He was also shaken by the discovery in 1953 that a convicted murderer, Christie, might have committed the crime for which Timothy Evans had been hanged in 1950. He worked out a distinction between capital and non-capital murder, and saw his concept embodied in the <span class="roman">Homicide Act 1957</span>. But it did not last&#151;unlike the provision in that act which introduced into English law the defence of diminished responsibility.<br>
<br>Newsam was not greatly interested in organization, but he was a born leader. He chose people he could trust, without much regard for rank, and gave them considerable authority. He tended to concentrate his own energies on the aspects of the Home Office which particularly appealed to him&#151;notably crime and criminal law, prison administration, emergencies, and especially the police, with occasional bursts of activity in the aliens department. One spectacular intervention was when it came to be known that an individual who was claiming political asylum was being forcibly detained on a ship in the Thames. Newsam sent his lawyers to obtain a writ of habeas corpus from the lord chief justice, and the commissioner of police then led a boarding party of 120 policemen to rescue the individual.<br>
<br>Newsam chaired (with some enthusiasm) the state management districts council, and also the fire brigades advisory council. But he really came into his own as chairman of the official committee on emergencies. Most of the problems arose from strikes, when it was a question of doing everything possible to maintain essential supplies and services. There was, though, one grave emergency of a different kind. The east coast floods in 1953 killed 300 people and affected 25,000 houses. Newsam sat at the centre directing the activities of large numbers of troops and civilians on repairs and defences, R. A. Butler later writing that &#145;Newsam had almost literally taken charge of the country &hellip; and secured achievements that would have surprised Canute&#146;  (Butler, 199).<br>
<br>Newsam contributed to one embarrassing heritage. On his advice the home secretary, Lloyd-George, authorized an intercept on the telephone of a known criminal in order to help the bar council in an inquiry into the professional conduct of a barrister. The row which erupted when it became known that an intercept had been used for this purpose led Butler, who had succeeded Lloyd-George, to set up the Birkett committee inquiry into the scope of telephone tapping.<br>
<br>Newsam retired in 1957, well beyond the normal age. He had never served outside the Home Office, apart from his few months in Tunbridge Wells which were, technically, under the Ministry of Home Security, and had never had much to do with other permanent secretaries and the central departments. Within his own field, though, he had been an extremely effective operator. Quick to go to the heart of a problem, a superb chairman of a meeting, an eloquent (if not very witty) speaker, he had a strong personality and tremendous drive. If at times he showed impatience with those who differed from him, he would in the end always listen. Quite good-looking, with a touch of the Caribbean, he had about him an aura of power and authority. In conversation, he would sometimes come out with an unexpected bit of knowledge, or quote by heart some passage from Aeschylus. But he also drank quite a lot, was an inveterate gambler on horse-racing, and enjoyed dancing and social occasions. Butler summed him up as &#145;an original&#146;.<br>
<br>On 28 December 1927 Newsam married Natalie Janet Elsie 
    (Jean; <i>b</i>. 1898/9)
  , daughter of James McAuslin, monumental mason of Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. When the war came she went to live in Wylye, Wiltshire, developed a taste for country living, and rarely went to London. Newsam went to Wylye most weekends, but not all, and continued to live in London after he retired. She survived him. Although they did not see much of each other they remained on good terms. There were no children.<br>
<br>Newsam was appointed CBE in 1933, KBE in 1943, KCB in 1950, and GCB in 1957. He was a commander in the Norwegian order of St Olaf. He published <span class="italic">The Home Office</span> in 1954. His health had begun to deteriorate during his last year or two in office, and his only major commitment in retirement was to serve as a highly regarded member of the newly formed police committee of the British Transport Commission. He died of cancer at his London home, 25 Blomfield Road, Paddington, on 25 April 1964.<br>
