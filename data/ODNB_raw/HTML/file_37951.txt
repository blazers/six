<span class="headword">Shaw <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Essex]</span>,  Hester</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1586?, <em>d.</em> 1660), <span class="occ">midwife</span>, was probably baptized in Allhallows parish, London, on 11 April 1586, the only recorded daughter of Nicholas Essex, gentleman. She began practising midwifery in London about 1610 and was licensed by the bishop of London before 1634. In that year Mrs Shaw and Mrs Whipp led a petition of sixty midwives of the City in opposition to Peter Chamberlen the elder, a man-midwife who planned to incorporate the midwives under his governorship. The petition, which was presented both to the king and to the College of Physicians and referred to the archbishop of Canterbury, alleged that Chamberlen had pecuniary interests in keeping midwives ignorant so that he could take on their difficult cases. The petition was successful in aborting Chamberlen's scheme; however, it did not result in an improvement of the ecclesiastical licensing system, as the midwives had hoped.<br>
<br>In January 1650 Hester Shaw's house in Tower Street was destroyed by a gunpowder explosion while she was attending a childbirth. Sixty-seven people were killed, including her son-in-law and three grandchildren. Shaw claimed to have lost all her midwifery earnings in the explosion, and a total of over &pound;3000. She also claimed that her minister, Thomas Clendon, had attempted to confiscate three bags of her money, worth &pound;953 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. These had been blown out of her house and taken into his for safe keeping. She explained the minister's ill treatment of her as revenge for her withdrawal of an annual gift of &pound;8 to the parish church when she found out that he had attempted to publish her charity. In 1653 Clendon complained of her allegations in his pamphlet <span class="italic">Justification Justified</span> and she returned with <span class="italic">A Plaine Relation of my Sufferings</span> and <span class="italic">Mrs. Shaw's Innocency Restored</span>. Affidavits taken before the lord mayor, a personal friend of hers, indicate that public opinion was on her side. She was described by Clendon as a woman &#145;by many reputed Religious, having by her good education, and volubility of tongue, and natural boldness, and confidence, attained some ability in prayer, and in speaking of matters of Religion&#146;.<br>
<br>Hester was married to John Shaw, the churchwarden of Allhallows parish, before 1 April 1610, when their daughter Elizabeth was born. Elizabeth became Dame Bludden, and Hester had at least one other daughter, who married George Farrington. John Shaw died before 1643. Hester Shaw was buried in Allhallows parish on 18 June 1660.<br>
