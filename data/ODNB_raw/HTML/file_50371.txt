<span class="headword">Jackson,  Clement Nugent</span>  (1846&#150;1924), <span class="occ">sports administrator</span>, was born in Simla, India, on 2 April 1846, the second son of Lieutenant-General George Jackson (1812&#150;1889), of the Bengal staff corps. Educated at Somerset College, Bath, in 1864 he was awarded a scholarship to Magdalen Hall, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1869 and proceeded MA in 1871, having taken third-class honours in classics. He remained in Oxford as a private tutor, and also held a tutorship at Magdalen Hall, which he retained when the hall was transformed into Hertford College in 1874. He was a university proctor in 1881 and held a fellowship of Hertford from 1881 until 1886, when he relinquished it on his marriage to Ada Louise Martin on 15 July. He continued to teach for Hertford, was re-elected to a fellowship in 1897, and was college bursar from 1887 until 1914. Jackson played a large part in the successful establishment of the new college; during its early days he was &#145;the man whom everyone knew, consulted and respected&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hertford College Magazine</span>, 9, 1914, 46).<br>
<br>As an undergraduate, Jackson was an outstanding athlete and cricketer. In 1865 he set a world record of 16 seconds for the 120 yards hurdles on the &#145;unsuitable&#146; Marston track, and in 1867 he won the high hurdles for Oxford against Cambridge in the first match of the series to be held in London. His athletic career was ended by an accident sustained while racing W. G. Grace over hurdles: &#145;I spiked a hidden oyster shell when going full bat in a hurdle handicap after the seven-leagued legs of W. G. Grace&#146;, recalled Jackson  (Lovesey, 29), and &#145;from that day onward I never ran, never tasted an oyster, and never spoke to W. G. the Great&#146;  (quoted in P. Matthews, ed., <span class="italic">The Guinness Book of Track and Field Facts and Feats</span>, 1982, 149).<br>
<br>While his own participation in sport was limited to annual fishing trips to Norway, and to coaching the Hertford eight from a bicycle on the river bank, Jackson became an energetic sports administrator both inside and outside Oxford. He became the senior treasurer of the university athletic club in 1869, and it soon became a rule &#145;that any bankrupt club went to Jacky, and in a year or two it was showing a healthy balance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hertford College Magazine</span>, 9, 1914, 47). He became senior treasurer of the rugby and association football clubs (1886), and later of lawn tennis (1900) and lacrosse (1903). The acquisition of the Iffley Road running ground in 1876 and of the football ground in 1899 were described as his two greatest triumphs, both &#145;practically unaided efforts, for &hellip; he never liked divided control&#146;  (ibid.). Jackson was an early supporter of the idea of amalgamated college clubs, and was treasurer of Hertford's clubs from 1883 to 1913.<br>
<br>Jackson was well known for his guidance of individual athletes at Oxford, and his nephew A. N. S. Strode-Jackson won the 1912 Olympic 1500-metre title as an Oxford undergraduate. One of the athletes he encouraged was Montague Shearman, who organized a conference in Oxford in 1880 to discuss the future of amateur athletics. Jackson, as &#145;guide, philosopher and friend of the OUAC&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hertford College Magazine</span>, 9, 1914, 46) gave his powerful support to this meeting, and to the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92495', "Amateur Athletic Association (AAA)")</script> which was formed from it, and of which Jackson was treasurer until 1910. It was his intervention at the meeting which ensured that the definition of an amateur which the new association adopted did not exclude &#145;mechanics, artisans or labourers&#146; from competition, unlike the definition supported by the metropolitan Amateur Athletic Club. Had the more exclusive definition of an amateur been adopted, a split in amateur athletics would have been likely; instead the new AAA was quickly accepted as the national governing body for the sport.<br>
<br>Jackson died on 28 October 1924 at his home, 12 Norham Road, Oxford, after a long period of ill health and seven years of paralysis caused by a stroke. His widow, the author of <span class="italic">Gordon League Ballads for Working Men and Women</span> (1897), survived him. A subscription provided two C. N. Jackson memorial cups, one competed for at the Oxford and Cambridge sports, and the other at the AAA championships. An undergraduate of the 1870s wrote in his memory, &#145;If a man is to be measured by his influence on other men Jackson must be accounted a great man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hertford College Magazine</span>, 14, 1925, 7).<br>
