<span class="headword">Olpherts, Sir  William</span>  (1822&#150;1902), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 8 March 1822 at Dartry, near Armagh, the third son of William Olpherts (<i>d</i>. 1876) of Dartry House, Blackwatertown, co. Armagh, and his wife, Rosanna, daughter of Dr Macartney. He was educated at Gracehill School and Dungannon Royal School, and then at Addiscombe College, from which he passed out as a cadet in 1839. He joined the headquarters of the Bengal artillery at Dum-Dum on 24 December 1839. Following the outbreak of disturbances in the province of Tenasserim in Burma, he was sent with four guns to Moulmein in October 1841. Nine months later he returned and immediately went on field service to subdue an insurrection that had broken out near Saugor. For his conduct during an engagement at Jhirna Ghat on 12 November 1842 he was mentioned in the dispatch written by the officer commanding the artillery. Olpherts qualified as an interpreter in Indian languages, and in April 1843 was given command of the 16th Bengal light field battery stationed at Nowgong in Bundelkhand. Later that year he joined General Sir Hugh Gough's expedition against Gwalior in north central India. His battery formed part of the wing of the army commanded by General Gray; it was heavily engaged in the fighting at Punniar on 29 December 1843, and Olpherts was mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>For his services in the Gwalior campaign Olpherts received the bronze decoration, and was selected by Lord Ellenborough, the governor-general, to raise and command a battery of horse artillery for the Bundelkhand Legion. He was at once detached with the newly raised battery to form part of Sir Charles Napier's army in Sind, which he joined after an arduous march of 1260 miles across India. He then participated in several engagements with the warlike tribes inhabiting the hills bordering Sind. In 1846 he took part in the capture of the hill fort at Kot Kangra during the First Anglo-Sikh War, attracting the attention of Sir Henry Lawrence, and was later appointed to raise a battery of artillery from the men of the disbanded Sikh army. He then commanded a battery of artillery in the service of the nizam of Hyderabad in the Deccan, but was soon recalled in February 1845 to take the lucrative post of commandant of artillery with the Gwalior contingent. In 1851 he joined the Peshawar garrison, under the command of Sir Colin Campbell, and participated in an expedition against the trans-border Pathan tribes, for which he was later awarded the frontier medal. Olpherts returned to England on furlough in May 1852 and was appointed an orderly officer at Addiscombe College.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of the Crimean War, Olpherts volunteered in January 1855 to fight against the Russians and was selected to join Sir William Fenwick Williams at Kars. He visited the Crimea <i>en route</i> for Kars, and then travelled via the Black Sea and the Zigana Mountains to join his new command. He escaped capture at Kars as he was placed in command of a force of 7000 Turkish troops detached to guard against a possible Russian advance from Erivan by the Araxes River. He was recalled to the Crimea and took command of a brigade of Bashi-Bazoukhs serving in the Turkish contingent. When hostilities ended in 1856 he returned to India and took command of a horse artillery battery at Benares.<br>
<br>Olpherts served throughout the suppression of the Indian mutiny (1857&#150;9) and was heavily involved in the fighting in northern India. On 4 June 1857 his battery, acting under the orders of General James Neill, opened fire on the 37th native infantry regiment which mutinied while being disarmed at Benares. Olpherts's battery was charged on three occasions during the confused fighting which ended with the complete rout of the sepoys. He then accompanied Sir Henry Havelock's column during the advance on Cawnpore and in the relief of the city of Lucknow, when he greatly distinguished himself in action. On 25 September he fought on horseback with the 90th regiment when it entered the city of Lucknow during a difficult engagement in which two guns were captured from the enemy. Despite intense musketry fire, Olpherts displayed great gallantry when he succeeded in bringing up horses and limbers to carry off the captured ordnance. Two days later he once again demonstrated his considerable personal bravery when, along with Colonel Robert Napier, he led a small party which rescued the wounded with the embattled rearguard and brought several guns into the security of the residency. Sir James Outram, commanding the residency at Lucknow, wrote: &#145;My dear Heroic Olpherts, bravery is a poor and insufficient epithet to apply to a valour such as yours&#146;. Until Sir Colin Campbell relieved the defenders on 21 November 1857 Olpherts acted as brigadier of artillery, and following the evacuation of the residency shared, under Outram, in the defence of the advance position at the Alambagh. In March 1858 he took part in the siege and capture of Lucknow by Campbell, and was once again mentioned in dispatches for conspicuous bravery. Following the end of the campaign he received the brevets of major and lieutenant-colonel, was awarded the Victoria Cross for his distinguished conduct on 25 September 1857, and was made a CB. His dash and valour in action had also earned him the sobriquet of Hell-Fire Jack from the men under his command.<br>
<br>Olpherts volunteered to serve under Brigadier Sir Neville Chamberlain during the 1859&#150;60 punitive expedition against the Wazirs on the north-west frontier, completing twenty years of continuous active service. He married Alice Maria, eldest daughter of Major-General George Cautley of the 5th Bengal European light cavalry, on 3 June 1861; they had one son, William Cautley, and three daughters; Lady Olpherts survived her husband. Between 1861 and 1868 he commanded the artillery at Peshawar and Rawalpindi, and then returned home on furlough; while there he was presented with a sword of honour by the city and county of Armagh. In 1872 he returned to India and commanded successively the Gwalior, Ambala, and Lucknow brigades. He finally left the subcontinent in 1875, on attaining the rank of major-general. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 1 October 1877, general on 31 March 1883, and in 1888 became colonel commandant of the Royal Artillery. He was made KCB in 1886 and GCB in 1900. Olpherts died at his residence, Wood House, Hamlet Road, Upper Norwood, London, on 30 April 1902, and was buried with full military honours at Richmond cemetery, Surrey.<br>
