<span class="headword">Cuff,  John</span>  (1708?&#150;1772?), <span class="occ">optician and microscope maker</span>, was the son of Peter Cuff (<i>b</i>. 1676), watchmaker and member of the Broderers' Company. It is possible that his mother was Rebecca, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Crichlow (<i>b</i>. 1675), who married a Peter Cuff, watchmaker, of the parish of St Martin Ludgate, London, at St Benet Paul's Wharf in 1698. Cuff was apprenticed to James Mann, optical instrument maker, in April 1722 and admitted into the freedom of the Spectacle Makers' Company in January 1730. It is from his likely ages on these dates (thirteen and twenty-one respectively) that the year of his birth has been estimated, though it is possible that he served a previous apprenticeship, perhaps with a clock- or watchmaker given his father's profession and the reputation he later gained for microscopes of all-metal construction.<br>
<br>For nearly twenty years from 1738 Cuff occupied a shop under the sign of the Reflecting Microscope and Spectacles on the north side of Fleet Street, London, three doors east of Crane Court, where the Royal Society had met since 1710. There he made and sold, both retail and wholesale, optical instruments, barometers, thermometers, mathematical instruments, and other curiosities. The microscopes he made included the standard models of the day and several innovative designs, including the perfected &#145;microscope for viewing opake objects&#146; and the solar or camera obscura microscope, both of which were invented by Johannes Lieberk&uuml;hn and first demonstrated in London in 1739. Cuff's solar microscopes, with their ability to project a magnified image onto a screen, proved popular and were widely used in public lectures of the time.<br>
<br>Cuff was closely associated with Henry Baker FRS, his advocate if not patron, who included descriptions and plates of Cuff's instruments in his works on microscopy, including the highly successful <span class="italic">Microscope Made Easy</span> (1742). It was for Baker that Cuff made his double reflecting microscope in 1743. This was a great improvement on its predecessors, being made entirely of brass, supported by a single side-pillar of rectangular cross-section, and having a fine-threaded focus: it was widely copied at home and abroad, and had a strong influence on subsequent designs, microscopes with such characteristics now being referred to as &#145;Cuff-type&#146;. Cuff also made an aquatic microscope, which was used to study the properties of specimens in water&#151;an activity made all the more popular in salons and drawing-rooms of the time after Abraham Trembley's discovery of the amazing regenerative properties of the polypus in 1740. It was this type of microscope that John Ellis used to compile his <span class="italic">Natural History of the Corallines</span> (1755).<br>
<br>Cuff was a frequent visitor to meetings of the Royal Society, but failed to secure the required number of votes for election when put up in 1743. He had as little success in the commercial sphere, though his excellence as a workman was highly regarded. He was declared bankrupt in 1750, but raised enough money from the sale of his household effects to continue trading. The arrival in 1757 of Benjamin Martin in the shop next door prompted him to flee some time between July and September from the sign of the Reflecting Microscope and Spectacles, and he moved along Fleet Street to the sign of the Double Microscope, Three Pair of Golden Spectacles, and Hadley's Quadrant, opposite Salisbury Court. He was there for little more than a year before being forced to give up shopkeeping and sell his stock-in-trade at auction. However, he continued to make instruments to order and to take on apprentices. In 1764 he was a signatory to the petition against John Dollond's patent for achromatic lenses.<br>
<br>Cuff had a number of trade cards and advertisements printed, along with several pamphlets, many of which were also translated into French (this was unusual for the time, but possibly not unconnected with Henry Baker's enthusiasm for the language), where he appears as &#145;Jean Cuff, opticien, faiseur de lunettes &amp; de microscope&#146;. The pamphlets are mainly illustrated descriptions of his microscopes, but also include a &#145;description of a Gregorian telescope&#146; and a poetic piece of 1747 entitled &#145;Verses Occasion'd by the Sight of a Chamera Obscura&#146;.<br>
<br>Details of Cuff's death are as uncertain as those of his birth. He served as an assistant at the court of the Spectacle Makers' Company from 1749, having served as its master for one year, to 5 October 1770, when he was discharged at his own request. William Cox, his last apprentice, had been with him since 1767, and was turned over to Charles Lincoln in 1771. A John Cuff was a member from December 1768 to March 1772 of masonic lodge 125, which met at the Bishop's Blaze in Shoreditch. In May 1772 letters of administration were issued for a John Cuff of West Dawlish in Somerset, a county in which there were several clockmakers by the name of Cuff.<br>
<br>Signed examples of Cuff's instruments can be found in the principal collections: they include not only microscopes and other optical instruments but also barometers, which he may have made himself or more likely sold on after adding his signature. Cuff has long been identified as one of the sitters in a portrait by Zoffany now in the Royal Collection, Windsor Castle. There is little evidence to support this identification: when first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1772 the portrait was called <span class="italic">An Optician with his Attendant</span>; in a rough draft of the inventory of Kew (<i>c</i>.1800) it appears as <span class="italic">Mr Cuff</span>, but in the published inventory as <span class="italic">A Mathematician</span>; when lent to the Royal Institution in 1827 it was hung as <span class="italic">Two Old Men</span>; subsequently it has been known as <span class="italic">The Lapidaries</span>. In 1859 a pencil note was visible on the stretcher reading &#145;Dollond the Optician in the Strand London&#146;.<br>
