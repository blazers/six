<span class="headword">Witt, Sir  Robert Clermont</span>  (1872&#150;1952), <span class="occ">art collector</span>, was born at Champion Hill, Camberwell, London, on 16 January 1872, the eldest of the six children of Gustavus Andreas Witt (<i>b</i>. 1840), wool merchant, and his wife, Johanna Frederiko Helene de Clermont. His father was born in Hamburg of a merchant family; his mother was of Huguenot descent. He was educated at Clifton College, Bristol, and New College, Oxford, where he obtained a second-class degree in history in 1894; he became an honorary fellow in 1942. He served in the army during the Matabele (Ndebele) uprising in 1896 and acted as war correspondent with Cecil Rhodes. After returning to London he qualified as a solicitor and eventually became senior partner in the firm of Stephenson, Harwood, and Tatham, making it one of the most prominent firms of solicitors in London.<br>
<br>Witt was a man of great energy who contrived to combine with his professional career a lifetime of intense activity in the cause of art, which was his governing passion. He made no claim to be an authoritative critic, but as early as 1902 he published the critically acute <span class="italic">How to Look at Pictures</span>, which was several times reprinted during his lifetime. In 1903 he co-operated with Lord Balcarres (afterwards the earl of Crawford), Claude Phillips, D. S. MacColl, and Roger Fry in founding the National Art Collections Fund. He was the first honorary secretary of the fund (1903&#150;20), then chairman (1920&#150;45), and saw it grow into an organization of great national importance. When he retired from the chairmanship in 1945 he was made its first president and in his honour a special exhibition of the principal acquisitions made for the nation by the fund was organized at the National Gallery. Witt was also a trustee of the National Gallery (1916&#150;23, 1924&#150;31, 1933&#150;40); trustee of the Tate Gallery (1916&#150;31); and of the Watts Gallery, Compton, Surrey. In 1932 he collaborated with Samuel Courtauld and Lord Lee of Fareham in founding the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London, and remained a member of its committee of management until his death. In October 1933 the university conferred on him an honorary DLit.<br>
<br>When still undergraduates both Witt and his future wife, Mary Helene (1871&#150;1952), daughter of Charles Marten, stockbroker, began collecting photographs and reproductions. They were married on 15 April 1899. Their hobby led during their long married life to the formation of the vast Witt library of photographs numbering at that time three-quarters of a million. On 28 November 1944 Witt executed a deed of gift making over this library to the Courtauld Institute, but continued to administer it himself at his home, 32 Portman Square, where he had turned his spacious house into a reference library; all the walls in the rooms, passages, and even the bedrooms were crowded with shelves containing dark green boxes of photographs always readily available to students and collectors. At Witt's death the library was transferred to the premises of the institute (then at 19 and 20 Portman Square) which also benefited by the bequest of his large collection (4000) of old master drawings, planned as a complement to the Library of Reproductions, and making the whole &#145;an incomparable weapon of scholarship&#146;. Witt concentrated his relatively limited resources on buying works by lesser-known or unfashionable, and therefore less expensive, artists. In this way he built up a formidable group of drawings by Guercino and Gainsborough, as well as many others of great beauty and rarity. The collection has since been extensively enlarged through a fund which came to the institute as his residuary legatee.<br>
<br>Witt published a catalogue of painters and draughtsmen represented in his library in 1920 and a supplement in 1925. His conception was copied abroad, notably in the United States where he personally helped Helen Frick to create on the same lines what is now the Frick Art Reference Library, New York, and in Tokyo by Professor Yukio Yashiro.<br>
<br>In the course of forming his library and collection Witt acquired an encyclopaedic knowledge of art and of the whereabouts of art treasures throughout the world. This knowledge he placed freely at the disposal of students and collectors, the value of his contribution being enhanced by his quality as a speaker and lecturer. He was an active controversialist on art subjects, and in the dispute over the pictures of Sir Hugh Lane his solicitor's training made him an outspoken defender of the strictly legal interpretation of the rival claims of London and Dublin. He played a prominent part in the organization of the annual winter exhibitions of foreign art at Burlington House in the 1930s, writing the introduction to the souvenir catalogue of the Italian exhibition of 1930.<br>
<br>Witt found time to show himself a devoted son of his school and college and to serve as the vice-president of the Institute of Industrial Psychology. A man of spartan habits, he never wore an overcoat and uncomplainingly bore many years of severe arthritis which compelled him to use crutches. He loved young people and in his old age and in great pain would go swimming with them when on holiday. He died at his home in Portman Square, London, on 26 March 1952, having retained to the end his interest and vigour. He was appointed CBE in 1918 and knighted in 1922, as well as receiving honours from Belgium, Holland, Italy, and Spain.<br>
<br>In the formation of his vast reference library Witt had the enthusiastic help of his wife, Mary Helene, who survived him by only a few months. Their only child, a son, John (<i>b</i>. 1907), followed his father as senior partner in his firm of solicitors and also on the board of the trustees of the National Gallery, of which he was chairman when the arrangements were completed with the Irish government for the exhibition of the Hugh Lane pictures in Dublin.<br>
