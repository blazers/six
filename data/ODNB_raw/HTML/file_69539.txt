<span class="headword">Jones, Sir  John Lewis</span>  (1923&#150;1998), <span class="occ">intelligence officer</span>, was born on 17 February 1923 at 8 Quality Row, Shotton Colliery, Easington, co. Durham, the son of Isaac Jones, a coalminer, and his wife, Isabel Raine. He was educated at Nelson grammar school in Cumberland and in 1940 went to Christ's College, Cambridge on a scholarship. During the Second World War he served in the Royal Artillery (1942&#150;6). He returned to Cambridge to complete his studies, taking a first in part two of the historical tripos and a certificate in education. In 1947 he joined the Sudan government service as a teacher, transferring in 1951 to the ministry of education where he became the establishment officer. In 1948 he married Daphne Redman (<i>d</i>. 1988), whose father also served in Sudan; they had no children.<br>
<br>In 1955 Jones returned to Britain and accepted an offer to join the military intelligence department (MI5), serving first in Hong Kong and then Singapore (1959&#150;61). After returning to London, he carried out the first feasibility study to computerize MI5's records. He then moved to the overseas branch, which was responsible for supervising the work of MI5 agents abroad: although it was the internal Security Service, MI5 also had responsibility for security in the British empire. In 1968 Jones was seconded to the Ministry of Defence as director of the moribund British services security organization in Germany. He revitalized it, and was appointed CMG in 1972.<br>
<br>When he returned to Britain, Jones was for a short time director of the overseas branch before becoming head of F branch, which dealt with counter-subversion, and later the operations branch. A rising star, he was appointed deputy director-general of MI5 in 1976, and in 1981 the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, made him director-general. He had not come up in the traditional way through the more prestigious K branch (responsible for countering Soviet espionage), and Peter Wright described him &#145;as an F branch man through and through, and his appointment perfectly illustrated the decisive shift in MI5's centre of gravity&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 12 March 1998), away from concern with the external security threat, and towards the &#145;enemy within&#146;.<br>
<br>Jones was director-general of MI5 during perhaps the most controversial and politically motivated period of its history. Encouraged by Thatcher, the agency targeted groups it considered a subversive threat to national security. These included coalminers, left-wing trade unionists, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and the National Council for Civil Liberties. Resources were diverted to countering subversion from what Jones called &#145;the far and wide left&#146;. Peter Wright resented this move because it deflected attention from his own obsession, the Soviet penetration of MI5.<br>
<br>Shortly after Jones became director-general the prime minister learned that Anthony Blunt, keeper of the queen's pictures, had confessed fifteen years earlier to being a Soviet spy. On that occasion the matter had been covered up to save the queen and the security establishment from embarrassment. Jones advised the prime minister that she should not name Blunt, on the grounds it might dissuade other spies from confessing in return for immunity. Thatcher rejected this advice and publicly unmasked Blunt on the floor of the House of Commons. Jones had also to deal with the highly embarrassing case of Michael Bettaney, the middle-ranking MI5 officer who tried to offer his services to the KGB. Moscow Centre, which feared a set-up, did not respond to Bettaney's overtures, and treated his original approaches to the KGB in London with great suspicion. Bettaney tried again, but the KGB double agent Oleg Gordievsky eventually exposed his treachery. The subsequent security commission report was critical of MI5 for failing to spot the potential troublemaker in its ranks, particularly when it became known that Bettaney was a heavy drinker. Jones was not personally criticized, but the case led to a demand for reforms in both vetting procedures and management. Jones, who had been created KCB in 1983, resigned in 1985. He subsequently served as chairman of civil service selection boards. He lived in Boston, Lincolnshire, where he took a considerable interest in local issues and was a member of the Boston golf club. He was an intensely private man, and only his closest friends knew of his real job. In his later years he developed emphysema, which contributed to his death in Pilgrim Hospital, Fishtoft, Boston, on 9 March 1998.<br>
