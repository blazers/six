<span class="headword">Hall <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Waddington]</span>,  Augusta</span>, Lady Llanover  (1802&#150;1896), <span class="occ">promoter of the Welsh national revival</span>, was born on 21 March 1802 at T&#375; Uchaf, Llanofer, Monmouthshire, the youngest daughter of Benjamin Waddington (1749&#150;1828), landowner, and of Georgina Mary Ann (1771&#150;1850), daughter of John Port of Ilam, co. Durham, and a great-niece of Mary Granville 
    (Mrs Delany; 1700&#150;1788)
  . Of her five sisters, three died in infancy and another, Emilia, died in 1819 at the age of twenty-five. Her surviving sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3945/', "Frances Bunsen (1791&#150;1876)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53760/', "Bunsen, Christian Karl Josias von")</script>] married Christian Karl Josias von Bunsen, Baron von Bunsen, Celtic scholar and later Prussian ambassador to Britain. Augusta and her sisters received a wide-ranging education at home under the direction of their accomplished mother. On 4 December 1823 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11945/', "Benjamin Hall (1802&#150;1867)")</script> of Aber-carn and Hensol, industrialist and politician, son of Benjamin Hall (1778&#150;1817), the industrialist. She became Lady Hall in 1838, when her husband was created a baronet; in 1859 he became Baron Llanover of Llanover and Abercarn. Both their sons died young, and their only surviving child, Augusta Charlotte Elizabeth, married John Arthur Edward Jones (Herbert) of Llan-arth Fawr in 1846.<br>
<br>Although Lady Llanover was a talented editor and illustrator, and a well-connected and accomplished hostess within the London parliamentary circle, she is mainly remembered for her contribution as patron of the language, literature, and national institutions of Wales. Her interest in all things Welsh was fostered both by contact with the Welsh-speaking tenants of her father's estate, and through the influence of Lady Coffin Greenly of Titley Court, Herefordshire, a patron of the emerging national literary revival of the time.<br>
<br>It was through Lady Greenly that Augusta Hall met the leading figures of this movement, and became an enthusiastic supporter. A vivacious and resolute personality, her reputation in Wales was established in 1834, when she won first prize for an essay at the Cardiff eisteddfod on the preservation of the language, literature, and traditional dress of Wales, and received the honour of ovate of the national Gorsedd of Bards. She subsequently adopted the pseudonym Gwenynen Gwent (&#145;the bee of Gwent&#146;). In the previous year, the Abergavenny Cymreigyddion Society, a Welsh literary society that was to play a major role in the revival of interest in Welsh and Celtic scholarship, had been established. Augusta Hall and her husband soon became its chief patrons. She also played an active role as patron of the Welsh Manuscript Society, formed under the auspices of the Cymreigyddion. She built up an extensive library at Llanofer and, in 1853, secured the manuscripts of Edward Williams (Iolo Morganwg), which were transferred to the National Library of Wales in 1916. She assisted and patronized Maria Jane Williams of Aberpergwm in preparing for publication a collection of Welsh airs, and supported Lady Charlotte Guest in her translation of the <span class="roman">Mabinogion</span> legends. She was a patron of the Welsh Collegiate Institution at Llandovery, established in 1848, and subscribed to and supported the publication of many Welsh books, including the financing of the first periodical for women in Wales, <span class="italic">Y Gymraes</span>, in 1850.<br>
<br>Llanover House, completed in 1837, became the centre of a wide cultural circle that encompassed many leading scholars of Wales and Europe. Poets and authors, antiquarians, musicians, prominent clergymen, politicians, diplomats, and members of the royal houses of Europe all spent time at Llanofer. The household was staffed by Welsh-speaking personnel, and the traditional Welsh seasonal celebrations held there became renowned. Llanofer estate was populated almost entirely by Welsh speakers, ensuring the survival of the language in this Anglicized area for another half-century or more. At Aber-carn, the school that Lady Llanover directly supervised taught through the medium of Welsh, and it was there also that she and her husband endowed an Anglican church, which was transferred to the Welsh Calvinistic Methodists in 1862 following the refusal of the vicar to conduct the services in the vernacular. At that time she personally supervised the preparation of a revised version of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> for use at the new church. A fervent protestant, she later endowed other Welsh dissenting chapels at Llanofer and Aber-carn. Her interest in the continuation of Welsh traditions led her to employ a resident harpist and to establish a harp manufactory at Llanofer. She was also an ardent supporter of the Welsh woollen industry, which is reflected in her design for a Welsh national costume, the creation of which she is credited with. Her other interest was temperance, and it was owing to her influence that several public houses on the Aber-carn and Llanofer estates were converted into temperance inns.<br>
<br>During the 1860s Lady Llanover published a major work, <span class="italic">The Autobiography and Correspondence of Mrs Delany</span> (1861&#150;2), and a housekeeping manual, <span class="italic">Good Cookery &hellip; and Recipes Communicated by the Hermit of the Cell of St Govan</span> (1867), which contained her well-known illustrations of Welsh peasant dress. She also illustrated a children's book, <span class="italic">The Paper People</span>, by Mrs Shaw Lefevre, and, with others, illustrated <span class="italic">The Literary Remains of the Reverend Thomas Price (Carnhuanwc)</span> (1854&#150;5), edited by her friend Jane Williams (Ysgafell) of Talgarth.<br>
<br>Lady Llanover survived her husband by over twenty-eight years. During her widowhood she spent some time in London and Bath, but lived mainly at Llanofer, where she continued to support Welsh literature and other Welsh causes. In her latter years and afterwards, some commentators ridiculed her rather eccentric zeal for Wales and the Welsh, yet at her death tributes were paid to her long-standing and active role as a leading patron of the Welsh literary and national movement. She died at Llanover House on 17 January 1896 and was buried there six days later.<br>
