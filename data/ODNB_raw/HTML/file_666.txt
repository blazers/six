<span class="headword">Armstrong,  William, of Kinmont</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1569&#150;1603), <span class="occ">border reiver</span>, was made famous by the poem &#145;Kinmont Willie&#146;, which recounts his dramatic rescue from Carlisle Castle in 1596, as found in Sir Walter Scott's <span class="italic">Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</span>. In 1593 Sir Thomas Musgrave of Bewcastle cited &#145;Will of Kinmont&#146; as one of the most infamous &#145;ryders and ill-doers upon the borders&#146;  (NL Scot., Armstrong MS 6112) and traced his descent from &#145;Ill Will&#146; Sandy Armstrong, a notorious reiver of the early sixteenth century, though his immediate parentage is unknown. Will's own connections with other prominent border surnames were consolidated by his marriage in or before 1583 to the daughter of Hutchin Graham. William Fraser claimed that seven sons came from this union, though only five&#151;Jock, Geordie, Francis, Thom, and Sandy&#151;are mentioned in the state papers. He also secured a crucial link with the English border administration by marrying his daughter to Thomas Carleton, constable to Lord Warden Henry Scrope.<br>
<br>On 23 October 1569 Armstrong (listed by his alternative toponym, &#145;of Morton Tower&#146;) pledged to obey the king and wardens, with Lord Maxwell standing as surety. He seems to have kept his word until 25 May 1579, at which time he appeared before the privy council to submit himself for his feud with Thomas Turnbull of Bedrule. In midsummer that year he and 400 Armstrong associates were said to have murdered Uswald Dod and seized 800 cattle and 1000 sheep in a foray. Armstrong's reputation as a reiver was established by July 1583, when Scrope unsuccessfully demanded his delivery by the laird of Johnstone, the Scottish warden. The English warden later reported that Armstrong and 300 adherents had committed six murders and stolen 400 cattle, 400 sheep, and 30 horses on 30 August.<br>
<br>Will Armstrong's reputation may have inspired the laird of Buccleuch and the earl of Angus to take him to Stirling on a military expedition against the earl of Arran in 1585. He and his sons effectively ransacked the town, even removing &#145;the iron gratings from the windows&#146;  (Fraser, 1.169). Despite his disorderly tendencies Will appears in the privy council's list of border landowners (14 August 1590) permitted to rent property within the Scottish &#145;debateable land&#146; &#145;and also the lands of Cannabye, adjacent thereto&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 4.799). His apparent reformation is further hinted at in February 1591, when Lord Maxwell again pledged to guarantee his tenant's good behaviour. On 4 December 1594 he effected a similar&#151;but ultimately non-binding&#151;arrangement with Thomas, Lord Scrope, whereby Armstrong would assume responsibility for 300 men.<br>
<br>Armstrong remained active as a freebooter, earning Scrope's enmity for his continual raids and &#145;the many outrages done by his followers&#146; in Cumberland  (Bain, 2.114). As the Scottish wardens were unwilling to surrender him Scrope ordered his deputy, Thomas Salkeld, to cross the Liddell River and seize Armstrong after a truce day in March 1596. This violation of march law&#151;which stipulated that fugitives could not be apprehended on a day of truce&#151;led to complaints from Buccleuch, keeper of Liddesdale. When these were ignored, Buccleuch personally organized a rescue expedition of 80 men, many of whom were English agents with insider's knowledge of Carlisle Castle, where Armstrong was incarcerated. With minimal damage the company infiltrated the castle in the early morning of 13 April and successfully retrieved him while both Scrope and Salkeld were in residence. This action heightened tensions between the two kingdoms, with Queen Elizabeth angrily demanding that King James surrender Buccleuch.<br>
<br>Armstrong continued to court controversy by abducting and ransoming the English captain, Sir Thomas Musgrave of Bewcastle, on 3 July 1596, which led to his own imprisonment by the king. He was free by 10 July 1600, when he sparked off another international incident by his purchase of a mare that had been stolen in England by Scottish thieves; this transaction drew a full-scale English raid of 200 horse and 80 foot, culminating in a skirmish at Kinmont Tower. The last mention of Armstrong is in a letter from Scrope to Robert Cecil (4 January 1603), in which the warden complains that, &#145;since his release, [Armstrong] has spoiled the 2 towns of Heskettes [High and Low Hesket in Cumberland]&#146;  (Bain, 2.816). His notoriety was such that the king was rumoured to have considered employing him in a retributory attack on the citizens of Edinburgh following the December riot of 1596.<br>
