<span class="headword">Loiseleur,  Pierre</span>  (1530&#150;1590), <span class="occ">Reformed minister</span>, was born at Lille; nothing is known about his family background, although he inherited the title of sieur de Villiers. He studied law at the University of Orl&eacute;ans in 1552 and went on to become an <i>avocat</i> at the <i>parlement</i> of Paris. Having become a protestant in a time of increasing religious persecution, Loiseleur left about 1557 for Geneva, where he became friends with Th&eacute;odore de B&egrave;ze. He also married; his wife, Jeanne, was the daughter of Charles de Brichanteau, seigneur de St Martin and seigneur de Nigerets.<br>
<br>Loiseleur had returned to France by 1558 and travelled in the entourage of Jean d'Andelot to Brittany, where with Jean Fleury he was regarded as the evangelizer of the duchy and responsible for establishing its Reformed congregations, in particular at Croisic. His career during the 1560s remains shadowy; there are suggestions that he entered the service of William, prince of Orange, and went to the Netherlands, although in April 1568 he was recorded as being at Bayeux. In 1572 he took up the ministry of the church of Rouen, where he probably became a friend of the English presbyterian Thomas Cartwright, until his residence was abruptly terminated by the massacre of St Bartholomew's day. According to Crespin, Loiseleur sheltered with his wife and seven young children at the ch&acirc;teau of &#145;la Riuiere&#146;, 2 leagues from the city, before fleeing to England.<br>
<br>In December 1572 Loiseleur was appointed by the French church in London to give thrice-weekly lectures in theology and doctrine. During his time in England he completed the translation into French of the annotations to B&egrave;ze's <span class="roman">New Testament</span>; the book was published in London in 1574 by Thomas Vautrollier as <span class="italic">Jesu Christi D. N. Novum Testamentum interprete</span> and was dedicated to Henry Hastings, third earl of Huntingdon. It went through five editions as well as Latin and English translations, the latter being completed by Laurence Tomson in 1576. In 1575 Loiseleur delivered a series of theology lectures at the inns of court and in the same year was offered the post of professor of theology at Leiden. He remained in England, however, received a doctorate of theology from the University of Oxford in July 1576, and was for a while resident at Christ Church, Oxford.<br>
<br>Loiseleur was active in the affairs of the French exile community in London, and following the death of Jean Cousin he was elected in October 1574, with Robert le Ma&ccedil;on de la Fontaine, to be one of the church's ministers. His name appears in the consistory minutes in connection with matters of discipline until September 1577. Loiseleur played an active role in the controversy arising from the charges of heresy brought against the Spanish-born theologian Antonio del Corro, which alienated the latter from the exile churches. Corro had been in part discredited through his association with another native Spaniard of uncertain orthodoxy, Casiodoro de Reina, and Loiseleur was later to lead the opposition to Reina's appointment as minister of the Lutheran congregation in Antwerp in 1579.<br>
<br>Loiseleur's political connections with France meant that he played an important role in representing Huguenot interests at the English court. His activities were reported on by the French ambassador, who noted with some relish the rebuke the minister received from Queen Elizabeth for his celebration of a Huguenot victory over the French crown in March 1575. Loiseleur's links with members of the privy council meant that envoys of William of Orange gained access to court, and in 1576 the minister mediated in a disagreement between the prince and the queen.<br>
<br>In 1577 Loiseleur moved to the Netherlands to become court preacher to William of Orange, but his political abilities also became increasingly in demand, as he assumed the responsibilities of William's secretary, Marnix van St Aldegonde, when the latter was absent on diplomatic missions. A pamphlet in 1583 even suggested that peace could only come to the Netherlands if Orange and his evil genius, Loiseleur, were locked up in a room together. The minister had arrived in London impoverished, but he prospered in the service of Orange, purchasing the castle of Westhoven on the island of Walcheren in 1583. Loiseleur's enemies attacked him for maintaining a coach, and for the expensive clothes and jewels worn by his wife and daughters. None the less Orange relied heavily upon the minister for advice, although this also prompted criticism. Probably Loiseleur's most important contribution in the service of Orange was as the ghost writer of the political tract <span class="italic">Apologie ou defense de &hellip; Guillaume &hellip; prince d'Orange contre le ban &amp; edict publi&eacute; par le roy d'Espagne</span> (1581). Virulently hostile to Philip II, it made a substantial contribution to the &#145;black legend&#146; of Spanish atrocities, not least through a number of fabrications maligning Philip's character, while presenting detailed justifications for the actions of William of Orange. An English translation was published at Delft in 1581 and in London in 1584. Loiseleur's engagement in religious affairs continued after the prince's death, and he was involved in the attempts to restore religious unity in Utrecht (1585) and in the dispute over the political activities of the theologian Adrian Saravia (1587).<br>
<br>Loiseleur was intermittently active in connection with English &eacute;migr&eacute;s to the Netherlands. He took part in the presbyterian ordination of Walter Travers at Antwerp in 1578, a service he also extended to the nonconformist Robert Wright in 1581, and was concerned with the activities of the separatist Robert Browne and his followers in 1582. But although he had remained in contact with the English court, his decision to counsel William of Orange to pursue a closer relationship with the French rather than uphold the English cause in the Netherlands alienated his English allies. Orange's continued support for the duc d'Anjou as ruler of the Netherlands, even after his abortive attempt to seize power in 1583, was encouraged by Loiseleur and overshadowed the final months of the prince's life. The unpopularity of this policy even led some contemporaries to suggest that Loiseleur had been partly responsible for the assassination of Orange in 1584.<br>
<br>Henri of Navarre (the future Henri IV) invited Loiseleur to enter his service after the death of Orange, but he remained in the service of William's son, Maurice of Nassau, for whom he conducted diplomatic missions. It was following one such mission that he was taken ill on 25 November 1590; he died the following day. He was buried in St Pieterskerk at Middelburg on 28 November.<br>
