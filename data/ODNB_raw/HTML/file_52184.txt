<span class="headword">Barrow,  Samuel</span>  (1625?&#150;1683), <span class="occ">physician and lawyer of the army</span>, was the eldest of the seven children of Samuel Barrow, a lawyer of Burwell, in Cambridgeshire, and his wife, Judith, daughter of George FitzGeffrey of Bedford. Although the exact date and place of his birth are not known, the <span class="italic">Visitation of Essex</span> of 1634 states that he was then about nine years old. He may have attended school at Charterhouse. On 6 July 1639, at the age of about fourteen, Barrow entered Trinity College, Cambridge, as a pensioner, becoming a scholar in 1641, and BA in 1644. According to Sir Thomas Clarges, he was &#145;ejected out of Trinity Colledge in Cambridge for his affection to his Majesty&#146;  (Baker, 651). This may have taken place in 1644. It is not known where he studied medicine.<br>
<br>In February 1654 Barrow was appointed physician to the armies in Scotland and in December 1659 judge-advocate of the army. In the unstable period after the death of Cromwell in 1658 he became one of the closest advisers of General Monck; he was recommended to the general's brother, Nicholas, as &#145;a very discreet gentleman&#146;  (Baker, 651). When Monck marched south on 30 December 1659, Barrow rallied support for the general on the way. In London Monck was ordered by the Rump Parliament to take action against the hostile City, but Barrow was instrumental in persuading him to demand a full parliament with the recall of the secluded members, a decision which led inevitably to the restoration of the monarchy.<br>
<br>Barrow was sent to Breda with Clarges to negotiate with the king. Clarges was knighted on the spot, but, strangely, not Barrow. The reason may have lain in the rumour about the &#145;Doctor's relations with Cromwell&#146;  (Routledge, 5.27). In August 1660 Barrow was appointed physician-in-ordinary to the king, with a fee of &pound;100 a year, and the next year judge-advocate-general to the first permanent establishment of guards. In June 1666 Barrow's old friend Sir William Clarke was mortally wounded in a battle at sea, and in July 1668 Barrow married the widow, Lady Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1695), daughter of Thomas Hyliard of Hampshire and Elizabeth Kimpton.<br>
<br>Although Barrow wrote nothing of consequence, he was regarded as an authority on the events of the time. He was consulted by Thomas Skinner (or Skynner), a biographer of Monck, and encouraged Sir Thomas Morgan to write his <span class="italic">A true and just relation of Major-General Morgan's progress in France and Flanders with the 6,000 English in the years 1657 and 1658</span>. It was written in 1675 but not published until 1699. Barrow greatly admired John Milton, and his Latin verses in praise of <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>, signed &#145;S. B., M. D.&#146;, were prefixed to the second edition of 1674. He may have been of help to the poet after the Restoration, but there is no evidence of any close friendship between the two.<br>
<br>When Barrow became ill in 1681, he resigned the post of judge-advocate in favour of his stepson, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5496/', "George Clarke (1661&#150;1736)")</script>. He died on 21 March 1683, and was buried in All Saints' Church, Fulham, Middlesex, on 25 March. In his will of 1676 he left all his property to his wife, apart from small gifts to brothers and sisters. No portrait of Barrow exists, but John Aubrey described him as a good-humoured man: &#145;He much resembled and spoke like Dr. Ezerel Tong&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 1.94).<br>
