<span class="headword">Dillon, Sir  James</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1600, <em>d.</em> in or after 1669), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was probably born at Kilfaughny, co. Westmeath, the eighth and youngest son of nineteen children of Theobald, first Viscount Dillon of Costello-Gallen (<i>d</i>. 1624), an extensive landowner in Connaught and co. Westmeath, and his wife, Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1638), daughter of William Tuite of Tuitestown, co. Westmeath. Nothing is known of his education or youth. He was twice married. His first wife was Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. before 1653), daughter of Thomas Plunkett of Rathmore, co. Meath. They had two sons, Ulick and James, both of whom predeceased him. His second marriage, to Mary (<i>d</i>. before January 1665), daughter of Roger Jones of Sligo and widow of Major John Ridge of co. Roscommon, was childless.<br>
<br>Dillon had an estate of 2500 acres in Mayo and Roscommon, but he seems to have lived near Athlone. He was the senior member of his family resident in co. Westmeath, which he represented in parliament in 1634&#150;5 and from 1640 until his expulsion as a rebel in 1642. In 1641, after the disbandment of Wentworth's &#145;new army&#146; in which he was a captain, he was authorized to recruit a regiment for service in the Spanish army from the soldiers affected. His investment of &pound;1000 in this project was lost when the scheme became a casualty of the growing conflict between King Charles I and parliament. This setback, possibly coupled with the belief that he was acting in accordance with the king's wishes, involved him with Lord Maguire and others in the conspiracy that preceded the 1641 rebellion. He made the radical proposal to seize Dublin Castle, but then withdrew from the plot, probably on the insistence of the commander-in-chief of the army, the earl of Ormond, that it was unhelpful to the king's cause.<br>
<br>After the outbreak of the 1641 rising Dillon was sent to the midlands as governor of Longford and Westmeath. Initially he exercised a restraining hand on the rebels, many of whom were his kinsmen, before reluctantly following his fellow Old English Catholics into revolt. He remained very much on the moderate wing of the confederacy. He was appointed colonel of an infantry regiment in the Leinster army. The prestige and wealth of his family made him the dominant military leader in west Leinster, where he recruited and provided sustenance for more than 1000 men. Throughout 1642 he invested Athlone, the key midland fortress on the Shannon. His forces twice broke into the east town but failed to dislodge the Connaught president, Viscount Ranelagh, from his stronghold in the castle west of the river. Dillon did not oppose Ormond's relief of the town in the summer, but in January 1643 he took part in an unsuccessful attack on a second relief force at Rathconnell, near Mullingar, as it retired to Dublin having evacuated Ranelagh and the remnants of his garrison. He then occupied east Athlone, and eventually gained the castle after his royalist nephew, Viscount Dillon, to whom he was closely allied, became president of Connaught in 1644. Smaller strongholds in the midlands were also brought under his control. In 1643 he helped negotiate a truce with Ormond, who recommended him as &#145;person of honour and good affection&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Confederation</span>, ed. Gilbert, 4.355). His regiment took part in Castlehaven's fruitless offensive in Ulster (1644). He joined Taaffe in reducing pro-parliament strongholds in co. Roscommon in 1645, and was present the following year with his regiment when Preston took Roscommon and Jamestown. Competition for quarters and ideological differences embittered his relations with Owen Roe O'Neill, who responded to his lethargic military performance with the sarcastic suggestion that he &#145;forego a military career, as not suiting to his humours, and at ease at home court ladies for which he was a fit instrument&#146;  (Gilbert, <span class="italic">Contemporary history</span>, 2.72). In 1646 the seizure of Athlone by O'Neill's supporters briefly drove him to side with Ormond, but he soon reverted to the confederacy, recovering the town and eventually the castle with Preston's help. He escaped from the battle of Dungan's Hill (1647), leaving his regiment to be destroyed with the rest of the Leinster army. His efforts to re-form it made slow progress, and by 1649 he could only muster 100 men in addition to two companies supplied to the Drogheda garrison. He served under Ormond in 1649&#150;50. In 1651 he was much criticized by other royalist leaders for his hasty surrender of Athlone to the parliamentarians. His own surrender followed in 1652. He forfeited his estate, but was permitted to take a regiment to Spain, from which he was sent to France to support the Bordeaux Fronde. His Franciscan brother, Father George Dillon, persuaded him to surrender the ch&acirc;teau of Lormont to the duc de Vend&ocirc;me in 1653. His regiment then entered the French army, and he was promoted to brigadier-general. His change of allegiance met with the approval of the exiled Charles II, who later acknowledged his loyalty. He served in the army of Flanders and fought with distinction at the battle of the Dunes (1658). His regiment was disbanded in 1664. He returned to the British Isles, where Charles II granted him a pension of &pound;500. In 1664 he sought a licence for the distribution of a new artificial fuel in Ireland. In 1666 he obtained a pass for Flanders, from where he corresponded with Ormond in Irish, evidently performing an intelligence-related role during the war with France and Holland.<br>
<br>The date and place of Dillon's death are unknown, but he was still in receipt of his pension in 1669. Much of his estate seems eventually to have reverted to his nephew, Thomas, fourth Viscount Dillon, who was presumably his heir.<br>
