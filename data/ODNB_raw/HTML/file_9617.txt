<span class="headword">Fitzmaurice,  Thomas</span>, sixteenth baron of Kerry and Lixnaw  (<em>c.</em>1502&#150;1590), <span class="occ">landowner and rebel</span>, the fourth son of Edmund Fitzmaurice, tenth baron of Kerry and Lixnaw (<i>d</i>. 1543), and his wife, &Uacute;na, daughter of Tadhg MacMahon. He was born in co. Kerry, probably at Clanmaurice. As a younger son Fitzmaurice was sent to the continent where he was trained as a soldier; he settled in Milan and served under the German emperors in the imperial army. Following the sudden death of his brother Gerald, the fifteenth baron of Kerry and Lixnaw, in July 1550, he inherited the ancestral estates in Clanmaurice, Kerry. He returned from Milan about a year later, having been told of his inheritance by a childhood nurse.<br>
<br>Fitzmaurice initially met with opposition from a John Fitzrichard, who disputed the inheritance for nearly two years. The latter, however, dropped his claim in 1552. In October 1553 Mary I confirmed Kerry in his estates, granting him all the manors and privileges of his predecessors. Reputedly a very handsome man, he was married shortly after his arrival to Lady Margaret (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1564), second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9560/', "James fitz John Fitzgerald, thirteenth earl of Desmond")</script>, and More, daughter of Sir Mulroney O'Carroll. They had four sons and one daughter. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9616/', "Patrick Fitzmaurice")</script>, the eldest son, was sent to England as a guarantee of Kerry's loyalty. Kerry remained loyal and in September 1553 he received a personal appeal from the queen to assist Sir Anthony St Leger, lord deputy, in the reform of Ireland and sat in the House of Lords in 1557, 1560, and 1568. He became consumed with the defence of his lands from Gerald Fitzgerald, fourteenth earl of Desmond, and James fitz Maurice (Desmond's cousin), who sought to exert their traditional suzerainty over Munster's nobility. Accordingly, during James fitz Maurice's rebellion Kerry remained loyal to the crown, aiding Sir John Perrot, president of Munster, in suppressing the rebellion in autumn 1572. Such loyalty facilitated the return of his son Patrick from England about 1572 and earned Kerry a place on the government's list of &#145;those who mislike the Geraldines in Munster&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/47/36).<br>
<br>Yet by the mid-1570s Kerry was engaged in a kind of <i>rapprochement</i> with Desmond. The influx of new English settlers seeking to establish landed claims in Munster&#151;such as Sir Peter Carew, who claimed Clanmaurice by right of inheritance&#151;threatened Kerry and inched him closer to his former enemies, who faced a similarly uncertain future. In summer 1574 Kerry, along with much of Munster's nobility, signed a document supporting Desmond's disapproval of Elizabeth I's policy in Munster. This was not tantamount to a military alliance, however. Kerry continually complained to Sir William Fitzwilliam, lord deputy, or to Thomas Butler, eleventh earl of Ormond, of Desmond's exactions and alleged that the earl had turned his son against him. He did not support Desmond's rebellion (1579&#150;83), but threatened rebellion himself to secure his interests and served the crown as a well-placed informer.<br>
<br>Kerry notified the crown of the arrival of Desmond's foreign aid at Smerwick in September 1580. Desmond responded by laying siege to several castles in Clanmaurice. Kerry, however, held fast and in September 1581 presented himself, with his brother-in-law, the earl of Clancare, to Arthur Grey, Baron Grey of Wilton, lord deputy, in Dublin; the officials there were taken aback by the dress and demeanour of these far-flung lesser nobles. The Fitzmaurices had traditional links with neighbouring Gaelic clans and Kerry, after the death of his first wife, married Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1582), daughter of MacCarthy More. He then married Penelope, daughter of Conor O'Brien, third earl of Thomond. His position became untenable: the government's impositions, coupled with Desmond's exactions, had ruined his country. Kerry's role in the murder of a contingent of soldiers at last pushed him into rebellion in May 1582.<br>
<br>Kerry's defection worried government officials. They feared a major foreign invasion was imminent but doubted if such &#145;an ould man, wise, and of great experience&#146; would support Desmond's desperate actions  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/92/18). Foreign support was not forthcoming and Kerry surrendered by March 1583. Though his association with Ormond spared him a traitor's death, he was watched closely after the rebellion: his extreme poverty, his son's imprisonment, and his displeasure with the settling of planters so near his lands made him a prime candidate for rebellion. He sat in the parliament of 1585&#150;6, but died in Clanmaurice, co. Kerry, on 16 December 1590. He was denied burial in his ancestral tomb, which instead housed a garrison, and was buried in the tomb of Bishop Philip Stack in Ardfert Cathedral. His son Patrick Fitzmaurice succeeded him as seventeenth baron of Kerry and Lixnaw.<br>
