<span class="headword">Sutton,  Daniel</span>  (1735&#150;1819), <span class="occ">smallpox inoculator</span>, was born on 4 May 1735 in Kenton, Suffolk, the second of eight sons (there were also three daughters) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38269/', "Robert Sutton (bap. 1708, d. 1788)")</script>, surgeon, apothecary, and inoculator, and his wife, Sarah Barker of Debenham. He trained under and worked for his father until about 1760. He then became an assistant to an Essex doctor, and returned to his father late in 1762 or early in 1763. Disagreeing with him over the patients' preparatory period before inoculation, which he proposed to reduce from a month to eight or ten days, and recommending an open-air regime instead of confinement indoors following inoculation, Sutton left to set up his own practice at Ingatestone, Essex, in October 1763.<br>
<br>In his first year of independent practice Sutton earned 2000 guineas. He inoculated 923 people in the first twenty weeks of 1765 and by late September had three inoculation houses at Ingatestone for different classes of patients paying 6, 4, or 3 guineas. By the end of the year two inoculation houses had been opened in London and in conjunction with his father and brothers Sutton had begun setting up partnerships throughout the country with &#145;Eminent physicians and surgeons daily applying &hellip; to be appointed partners for particular counties, or for foreign parts&#146;. The income of the practice in 1765 was &pound;6300.<br>
<br>In May 1766 in Maldon, Essex, Sutton performed his first mass or general inoculation. In one day 487 inhabitants were inoculated, thereby curtailing an epidemic. About the same time he purchased Maisonette, a country house and grounds in Ingatestone. A few weeks later he appeared at Chelmsford summer assizes, charged with causing an epidemic then raging in the town. Since all the doctors in Chelmsford practised inoculation it was impossible to prove him responsible and Sutton declared the prosecution to have been founded on the envy and malice of his enemies in the medical profession. In July and August further successful general inoculations took place in Maidstone, Kent, and Ewell, Surrey. In 1766 Sutton personally inoculated 7816 people. The total number inoculated by him, his assistants, and partners in the three years 1764&#150;6 amounted to almost 20,000 without, it was claimed, a single death directly attributable to the treatment.<br>
<br>Events continued to move rapidly. By 1767 Sutton's method was becoming known on the European mainland, where it was recommended by Sir John Pringle. In August 1767 Sutton was granted a coat of arms with the motto &#145;Safely, quickly and pleasantly&#146;. He also married Rachel, widow of William Westley of Shepton Mallet, Somerset, and daughter of Simon and Frances Warlock of Antigua and Westminster. They were to have one son, Daniel, born in 1768, and a daughter, Frances. The inoculating business had now reached its zenith with forty-seven &#145;authorized&#146; partnerships (including Sutton, his father, and six brothers) in England, Ireland, Wales, the Netherlands, France, Jamaica, and Virginia in 1768.<br>
<br>By about 1769 Sutton began to be superseded as first-choice inoculator of the wealthy by Thomas Dimsdale. Having successfully demonstrated the safety of his method of treatment so that it was being adopted by inoculators throughout the country, Sutton had already unwittingly performed his greatest service in the fight against smallpox. At the time of his father's death in April 1788 he and his brothers were still &#145;very eminent in the practice&#146;, and in 1796 he published <span class="italic">The Inoculator</span>, in which he explained his method and displayed his contempt for the medical establishment. In his final years he witnessed the introduction of vaccination, in 1798, and the rejection of inoculation by the majority of doctors. He died in semi-obscurity at his London residence in Hart Street, Bloomsbury Square, in February 1819.<br>
