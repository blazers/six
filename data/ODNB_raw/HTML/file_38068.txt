<span class="headword">Tilden, Sir  William Augustus</span>  (1842&#150;1926), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 15 August 1842 at 163 Arlington Street, Regent's Park, London, the elder son (there were no daughters) of Augustus Tilden, a clerk of the Bank of England, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Henry Balls of Cambridge. He was educated at schools in Kidderminster, Bedford, and East Dereham. When Tilden was fifteen, he was apprenticed for five years to Alfred Allchin, a London pharmacist, and attended lectures at the Royal College of Chemistry and the Pharmaceutical Society. Between 1863 and 1872 he worked as a demonstrator at the Pharmaceutical Society under Professor John Attfield; he also obtained a BSc in chemistry (1868) and a DSc (1871) from the University of London. Tilden became senior science master at Clifton College, Bristol, in 1872 and was elected to the chair of chemistry at the newly founded Mason College in Birmingham (later the University of Birmingham) eight years later. In 1894 he replaced T. E. Thorpe as professor of chemistry at the Royal College of Science, which became part of the Imperial College of Science and Technology in 1907, two years before Tilden retired in 1909.<br>
<br>In 1875 Tilden found that nitrosyl chloride could be used to characterize terpenes, compounds which are found in turpentine and other essential oils. Thereafter, the terpenes and related compounds were Tilden's major interest. One important consequence of this research was his discovery in 1884 that isoprene (the building block of natural rubber) could be prepared by passing turpentine oil vapour through a red-hot iron tube. Much later, in 1892, a sealed bottle of this isoprene was found to contain yellowish lumps which appeared to be similar to natural rubber. Tilden even vulcanized this forerunner of synthetic rubber with sulphur, but did not pursue this line of research in the absence of any pressing need for rubber. In his later years Tilden also studied the specific heat of metals over a wide range of temperatures, and the history of chemistry. He published seven textbooks, the most enduring being his <span class="italic">Introduction to the Study of Chemical Philosophy</span> (1876), and four historical works, including a biography of the chemist Sir William Ramsay (1918).<br>
<br>Tilden was president of the Institute of Chemistry (1891&#150;4) and of the Chemical Society (1903&#150;5). He was elected FRS in 1880, and was awarded the Davy medal in 1908. Honorary degrees were bestowed by the universities of Dublin and Birmingham, and the Victoria University of Manchester, and Tilden was knighted in 1909. In 1869 he married Charlotte Pither (<i>d</i>. 1905), daughter of Robert Bush of St Helier, Jersey. They had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64603/', "Philip Armstrong Tilden")</script>, architect and garden designer. In 1907 he married Julia Mary, daughter of C. W. Rami&eacute; of St Helier, who survived him. Tilden died at his home, The Oaks, 57 Murray Road, Northwood, Middlesex, on 11 December 1926.<br>
