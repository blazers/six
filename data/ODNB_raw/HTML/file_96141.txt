<span class="headword">Fisher,  Herbert Albert Laurens</span>  (1865&#150;1940), <span class="occ">historian and politician</span>, was born at 3 Onslow Square, London, on 21 March 1865.<h2>
<a name="Familyandeducation"></a>Family and education</h2>In his posthumously published <span class="italic">Unfinished Autobiography</span> Fisher painted a charming picture of the family into which he was born. He was the eldest son of Herbert William Fisher (1826&#150;1903) and his wife, Mary Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jackson (1841&#150;1916). They were a large family; a younger brother was distinguished in later life as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33147/', "Admiral Sir William Wordsworth Fisher")</script>. His mother was the daughter of the fourth of the legendary Pattle sisters, and was herself a considerable beauty. She was painted as the heroine of G. F. Watts's <span class="italic">Una and the Red Cross Knight</span>, and was photographed by Julia Cameron, her aunt. The young Fisher tried to evade his great-aunt Julia's attentions, since the two-minute exposures of mid-Victorian photography were a trial to the patience of a small boy. But these family links meant that Fisher was born into what Noel Annan a century later described as the intellectual aristocracy&#151;Leslie Stephen was an uncle, F. W. Maitland a brother-in-law, and Vanessa Bell and Viriginia Woolf were cousins. <br>
<br>Fisher's father was a barrister by profession, but in Fisher's childhood occupied the glamorous post of private secretary to the prince of Wales. He had served as the prince's tutor when the latter had been an undergraduate at Christ Church, and was called on to act as his private secretary from 1860 to 1870. Such was his discretion that little of the life of the court washed over the young Fisher (though his second name, Albert, was bestowed on him by his princely godfather); perhaps more important to the formation of the historian was the sight of Froude and Carlyle walking past the house in Onslow Square. More important than either in Fisher's own memory were the pleasures of life in the family house in the New Forest. <br>
<br>Fisher suffered sunstroke when taking the scholarship examination for Winchester College, and therefore attended Winchester as a commoner (1878&#150;84). None the less, he was recognized as a superior intellect from the first, though he was himself inclined to note the fact that he had fagged for Edward Grey, the future foreign secretary, as the most striking fact about his school career. Family tradition destined Fisher for Christ Church, but Winchester tradition reserved the school's best scholars for New College; the school prevailed and Fisher emerged head of the roll. In retrospect, he thought his education too narrow, too classical, and too lacking in science, but acknowledged that it had given him a literary deftness and an aptitude for careful drafting that later stood him in good stead. <br>
<br>Fisher's undergraduate years were not wholly happy, largely because he was slightly but persistently unwell for much of the time. Academic success did not wholly compensate. He was an excellent classicist, but &#145;the bright particular star&#146; of his generation was, as he recalled, Gilbert Murray, and it was Murray who walked off with all the prizes. It is possible that Fisher was in any case beginning to tire of classical studies. For all that, he gained a first class in classical moderations (1886) and in Greats (1888), and in the autumn of 1888 both he and Murray were elected to fellowships at New College; Murray remained his closest friend for the rest of his life, and was a fellow editor of the <span class="roman">Home University Library</span> as well as a political ally.<h2>
<a name="Collegetutor"></a>College tutor</h2>At that time a fellowship was considered as a prize for a clever young man to aspire to, in the way that fellowships by examination at All Souls still are. There was as yet no understanding that a prize fellowship was more likely to lead to an academic career than to any other. Fisher was uncertain whether to follow his father to the bar, and certainly hankered for life on a wider stage than that offered by the life of a tutorial fellow of an Oxford college. However, he was the eldest of eleven children; his family was under financial pressure from the illness of one of his siblings, and the financial security of academic life was welcome. Even then, he was unsure what his intellectual bent might be. Of the two subjects that he had studied for Greats, he first and very briefly taught philosophy, but soon decided that it was not for him. He saw no future for himself as an ancient historian, however, as much because he thought the field itself was closed, as because he had lost his taste for it. <br>
<br>With the encouragement of Frederick York Powell, Fisher set out to become a modern historian. Graduate studies scarcely existed in England at that time, and Fisher went off to Paris and G&ouml;ttingen for further study. It was in Paris that he found himself particularly at home, enjoying the cultural riches of the city to the full. As a historian he benefited both from his induction into the sober and minute techniques of research pioneered by the &Eacute;cole des Chartes and from the inspired flights of speculation that he heard from Renan and Taine. His capacity for making friends of his French and German hosts, as well as among the expatriate English, was impressive in itself and does much to explain why so many of his colleagues felt that history's gain was diplomacy's loss. Among the young Englishmen whom he met in Paris, he particularly enjoyed the company of the artist Will Rothenstein. <br>
<br>As a history tutor and lecturer in turn-of-the-century Oxford, Fisher taught long hours and over a vast territory: until the 1920s tutors might see twenty students a week, and Fisher taught English and European history from the classical world to the late nineteenth century. Among his claims to fame, one was that in those years he taught every member of Lord Milner's &#145;kindergarten&#146;, the clever and ambitious young men that Milner recruited to govern South Africa with him. Fisher was a very much admired teacher, and a meticulously well-read lecturer; even so, he was a fluent writer and apparently possessed of boundless stamina. A revised edition of G. W. Kitchin's <span class="italic">History of France</span> in 1892 was followed after an interval by a steady stream of works on Napoleon and the political system produced by Napoleon's domination of Europe. Alongside these interests, however, he preserved an interest in the medieval and early modern world. <br>
<br>So in 1898 there appeared <span class="italic">The Mediaeval Empire</span>. <span class="italic">Studies in Napoleonic Statesmanship: Germany</span> followed in 1903; volume 5 of Longman's <span class="italic">Political History of England</span> in 1906, covering the reigns of Henry VII and Henry VIII. <span class="italic">Bonapartism</span> (1908) was delivered as a series of lectures at the University of London, and <span class="italic">The Republican Tradition in Europe</span> (1911) as the Lowell lectures in Boston the previous year. The most successful work of those years was the account of Napoleon that he wrote for the <span class="roman">Home University Library</span> (1913). Fisher had a considerable talent for the depiction of personality; his short memoir of his brother-in-law Frederick William Maitland, whose <span class="italic">Constitutional History of England</span> he published in 1908, and whose <span class="italic">Collected Papers</span> he edited in 1911, had already shown this, and <span class="italic">Napoleon</span> was widely thought to be the best brief study of its subject that had appeared in any language.<h2>
<a name="MarriageIndiaandSheffield"></a>Marriage, India, and Sheffield</h2>Fisher's visit to the United States in 1910 began something close to a love affair with North America. One of the many non-academic careers that Fisher might easily have had would have been in the Foreign Office, and relations with the United States would have been a natural field of interest. But the path from the study to the political stage initially led eastwards rather than across the Atlantic. Many of Fisher's relatives had had connections with the Indian subcontinent; and on 6 July 1899 Fisher married Lettice [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41132/', "Fisher, Lettice (1875&#150;1956)")</script>], the daughter of Sir Courtenay Ilbert. Ilbert was then a parliamentary draftsman; in an earlier career as a lawyer in India, he was the author of the ill-fated and contentious <span class="roman">Ilbert Bill</span> that would have extended the authority of Indian magistrates over British residents in India. The Ilbert family was as fascinated by politics as Fisher's own family was by the arts, and Lettice Ilbert's interests were firmly in the family tradition. As Mrs Fisher, she was one of the leading Oxford campaigners for female suffrage (and founder of the National Council for the Unmarried Mother and her Child), and through her Fisher entered a wider and more political world than Oxford would have prepared him for. In 1912 he was appointed a member of the royal commission that inquired into the provision of public services in India. It was a demanding appointment for someone who could not bear to pronounce on any subject that he had not thoroughly researched and kept him busy until the commission reported in 1917. <br>
<br>The appointment that led to the more dramatic change in his career, however, was to the vice-chancellorship of the University of Sheffield. He was appointed in 1912, but took up residence in spring 1914, after returning from the royal commission's visit to India in 1913. Fisher was a natural administrator, and felt neither overworked nor undervalued in the new roles that the post of vice-chancellor thrust upon him. His ability to master a brief may or may not have been inherited from his lawyer father, but it was quite out of the ordinary. His ability to put aside whatever preconceptions about higher education one might have expected him to have acquired at Winchester and Oxford was impressive, too, though less surprising against the background of half a century of Oxford initiatives in university extension and adult education. <br>
<br>The University of Sheffield was, like many of the new civic universities, the mature product of a Victorian college that had initially been devoted to the applied sciences appropriate to its setting&#151;in this case, metallurgy and mining in particular. The university was established by royal charter in 1905, with four departments: of arts, pure science, applied science, and medicine. The first of these was the weakest, and Fisher devoted some effort to bringing it up to standard, but in general he felt that the best thing to do was to work with the grain of the institution itself. He was careful to avoid snobbish comparisons between the glamorous social life of the metropolis and life in the provinces, but some dry diary entries recording dinners with local worthies suggest that he occasionally felt the contrast pretty sharply. <br>
<br>Fisher's work at the university was disturbed, but not stopped, by the outbreak of war in August 1914; nor was it stopped by service on the Bryce commission investigating the supposed atrocities committed by German forces in Belgium. He had always thought that local industry and the university should work in close co-operation, and he had already set up a university scientific advisory committee to encourage the application of research to the needs of industry. After the war began he worked with the lord mayor of Sheffield and the leaders of the cutlery industry to turn the city's talents to wartime production. When he asked about the production of steel helmets&#151;a military necessity in trench warfare, but an item of equipment that had not been needed since the seventeenth century, a Sheffield manufacturer observed that he had been making dish-covers for years and the general principle must be much the same.<h2>
<a name="PresidentoftheBoardofEducation"></a>President of the Board of Education</h2>All this was interrupted in December 1916 by a bolt from the blue: an invitation from Lloyd George to join his newly formed coalition government as president of the Board of Education. The political world was far from alien territory to Fisher. He had a wide acquaintance among intellectually minded politicians such as Morley, Asquith, and Balfour. He had known Lloyd George socially for some years and they had liked each other, so that he was not intrinsically a surprising choice for the post. Some younger colleagues who knew Fisher after the war, such as Richard Crossman and Lionel Robbins, were surprised by Fisher's friendship with Lloyd George; Robbins, indeed, was moved to quote Walter Roche's description of Fisher as like &#145;a good man who had inadvertently entered a brothel&#151;and rather enjoyed it&#146;  (Buxton and Williams, 113). This underestimates Fisher's lifelong taste for politics, and ignores the impact of his Ilbert relatives, in whose veins ran a taste for political controversy. What was a surprise was that Lloyd George, who had been put in power essentially in order to prosecute the war more successfully, should appoint a president who would have his eyes fixed on peacetime reform. Indeed, Fisher had little enthusiasm for the war. He had argued for a compromise peace with Germany not only at the moment when Lloyd George was made prime minister to pursue an unconditional German surrender, but to the prime minister himself. The president held a cabinet post, the post later occupied by the secretary of state for education, and Fisher did much to turn the Board of Education into the department it subsequently became. <br>
<br>Fisher was returned unopposed as the Liberal member for Sheffield Hallam in a by-election, and settled into his new occupation; in 1918 he was elected for the combined universities' seat in the Commons, which he held until he left the house in 1926. Given good relations with one's permanent civil servants, the life of a cabinet minister need not be very burdensome, at any rate at that time, and Fisher did not find it so. He was aided by two very distinguished permanent officials, Sir E. K. Chambers and J. W. Mackail. In his autobiography Fisher gave a self-deprecating but not wholly unconvincing account of his own initial success in the post; he had a very good memory, and astonished the House of Commons by delivering his maiden speech on the education estimates; on 21 April 1917 he spoke for over two hours without notes and without hesitation. The performance secured his authority over his hearers once and for all. <br>
<br>The energy and diplomatic skill which had impressed the citizens of Sheffield were now devoted to mastering the school system of England and Wales. Fisher toured the country to find out for himself what standards were like in the elementary schools of the great cities and the village schools of the countryside. He brought to the task the right temperament and the right political inclinations. The system of public education was locally administered, and at that date locally financed; as a result it was everywhere underfinanced. Although it was in some areas a scene of enlightened experiment, in others it was a scene of grudging acquiescence in the need to educate working-class children at all. Fisher neither wished to sweep away local control, nor to leave everything in local hands. He saw the virtues of good elementary schools and the weaknesses of bad ones, observing after one visit to London that the gap between the best and worst elementary schools was much wider than the gap between the best of them and Eton or Winchester.<h2>
<a name="TheEducationAct1918"></a>The Education Act, 1918</h2>The Board of Education contained a good deal of talent, and the so-called Fisher <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1918 owed a good deal to the permanent officials of the board, and more remotely to a long history of debates over the nature, purpose, and financing of public education. None the less it was Fisher who nursed, shaped, and argued for the act. Not only did it determine the character of public education until the Butler <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1944, it contained several features beyond its successor's ambitions. The most important feature of the act was that it made central government the major paymaster of primary and secondary education. Thereafter, central government contributed 60 per cent of teachers' salaries&#151;the major part of any education budget&#151;and local education authorities 40 per cent. This achieved several things, not all of them an obvious part of Fisher's goals. The goal he had in mind was the institution of decent salaries for teachers and a consequent elevation of their social standing. Soon afterwards a proper pension scheme was instituted as well. A change that might have been less to his taste was the steady transfer of power from localities to central government. Once the board paid the piper, the board increasingly called the tune. <br>
<br>In some areas Fisher himself hankered after greater uniformity. Before he left office he made an abortive attempt to bring denominational schools under the control of local authorities, in the hope of diminishing the obscurantism and acrimony that had long disfigured discussion of the role of religion in public education. In the circumstances of 1918 chaos was a greater threat than over-centralization, and a strong, clear statement of the guiding principles of public education was worth having, especially when embodied in useful financial and administrative measures. Fisher established the school certificate examination that among other things replaced the fifty-five separate examinations previously used by professional organizations to assess the skills of school-leavers, and an examination that later blossomed into the higher certificate and A-level examinations that set a national standard for would-be university students. To help badly off students attend university, he created a system of state scholarships. To help the universities themselves he established the system of arm's length state support through the University Grants Committee that lasted for more than half a century. He performed a particularly important service for Oxford and Cambridge. <br>
<br>By setting up the Asquith commission Fisher ensured that those universities could receive government funding in the way that other universities did, but without allowing government intervention in the lives of their constituent colleges. The delicate balancing of the government's interest in tertiary education and the universities' interest in their own autonomy was something of a triumph. The one area in which he had little success, and in which England is still unlike Germany and the Scandinavian countries, was that of allowing children to stay at school while working part-time. Fisher thought it wrong that children were in school full-time until the age of fourteen and were then, aside from those in academic streams, wholly cut off from education. His act provided for a system of half-time schooling after the age of fourteen when conditions allowed, but they never have allowed. A bleak assessment would be that Fisher was one of many ministers who have failed to create the secondary school system needed by modern Britain; a less bleak assessment might be that the combined effects of local religious prejudices and English assumptions about the needs of children from different social classes made any more extensive reform impossible. <br>
<br>Even before the fall of the Lloyd George government in October 1922, Fisher found himself in difficulties. The financial crises of the post-war years meant that the education estimates were constantly under threat from the Treasury, and from the notorious Geddes committee. Fisher fought his corner as best he was able, but many of his plans for smaller classes and better-paid teachers were thwarted. The final fall of the coalition government posed a more direct and personal problem for Fisher. He held his parliamentary seat at the general election of 1922 and retained it until 1926, but now that he was out of the government he had no secure income. For the next two years he supported his family mostly by journalism. He was only fifty-eight, and could not afford to retire even if he had wished to. He did not want to become a history professor, and he felt that he was in any case not sufficiently abreast of his subject decently to do so. He regretted his loss of office a good deal on more directly political grounds, and in particular to be deprived of the influence in foreign affairs that he had exercised as a member of the cabinet. He served in the British delegation to the League of Nations from 1920 to 1922, and could have been a force for good for many years if events had turned out otherwise. Indeed, in April 1923, at the instigation of Lloyd George, he explored German sentiment on reparations, and in the following year returned to Boston to give a second set of Lowell lectures, with a side-visit to Canada that was a diplomatic triumph. It was not with any very great enthusiasm, therefore, that he accepted election as head of his old college in January 1925 and retired from parliament the next year. &#145;I fear it may come to that&#146; is said to have been his acknowledgement of one attempt at congratulation on his new position  (private information).<h2>
<a name="WardenofNewCollegeOxford"></a>Warden of New College, Oxford</h2>Fisher was perhaps intellectually the most distinguished warden that New College has elected in its six centuries of existence; he was certainly the most distinguished in recent centuries. Richard Crossman, who was to all intents and purposes sacked by Fisher in the 1930s, none the less referred to his &#145;greatness as a Warden&#146; in an essay on his former head of house  (Crossman, 5). Although he decried (to the young Isaiah Berlin) the college to which he had returned as &#145;one enormous mausoleum&#146;  (private information, quoted in Ignatieff, 60) bereft of the bright and energetic young men whom the war had destroyed, he was an effective head of the college, and under his leadership the college enjoyed something of a golden age. A mausoleum was in any event an unkind description of a place that contained Lionel Robbins, G. H. Hardy, and J. B. S. Haldane. <br>
<br>The role of a college head suited Fisher: he brought a feeling of the wider world to cloistered precincts, and his intellectual eminence usefully intimidated the idler sort of undergraduate. He was no longer the young tutor of thirty years earlier, but he was still a spellbinding lecturer. He took a deep interest in the prospects of the undergraduates, and made sure that they met the right people from the outside world, either at dinner or in other ways. Weekends were devoted to house parties at which Lloyd George, Virginia Woolf, or Elizabeth Bowen might be present, with dinner for eighteen on Saturday and lunch for awestruck undergraduates on Sunday. He was mocked behind his back for too often beginning his sentences with &#145;When I was in the cabinet &hellip;&#146;, but it was an admiring mockery, and half a dozen of the young men in due course held cabinet office themselves. <br>
<br>Fisher's notebooks are full of accounts of visits to college properties, and he kept up a large correspondence with old members of the college; but the job could not occupy all his time and attention, and he served on many committees of the great and the good outside Oxford. In addition, he was elected president of the British Academy in 1928, and was active in the academy's affairs for many years. He served for several years as chairman of the Rhodes Trust, and very successfully. It is not, on the other hand, altogether easy to tell whether the oft-made comment that he was an excellent chairman because he did not much mind being outvoted was quite intended as a compliment. <br>
<br>Fisher wrote as swiftly and persuasively as ever. As well as <span class="italic">James Bryce</span> (1927) and <span class="italic">Paul Vinogradoff: a Memoir</span> (1928), he wrote an odd little book on Christian Science and its founder Mary Baker Eddy, <span class="italic">Our New Religion</span> (1929). As a rationalist of the high and dry kind, Fisher had every reason to be irritated by the spectacle of Christian Science, but why he chose to attack this target in particular remains unclear. The book aroused tremendous indignation among Christian Scientists, and even those of Fisher's colleagues who admired its ironic style, and shared its author's belief that a contempt for modern medicine is dangerous, wondered whether he had not gone too far in his portrait of the movement's founder. In spite of its notoriety, the book was a failure from the sales point of view: its American critics persuaded most wholesalers not to sell the book and denied it a <i>succ&egrave;s de scandale</i>. Fisher may have underestimated the offence the book would cause because he was himself an agnostic in religious matters; in private letters he described himself as an atheist, and said firmly to his friends that religion &#145;rots the mind&#146;  (J. Hart, <span class="italic">Ask me No More</span>, 1998, 204). He wore his disbelief lightly, and did not set out to embarrass the devout, but he may have thought Christian Science so preposterous that he failed to appreciate the devotion of its followers to their creed and its founder. His friends and family remembered his life of Mrs Eddy as the one book he really enjoyed writing, however. A greater success was Fisher's contribution to the genre that sixty years afterwards became fashionable as &#145;counterfactual history&#146;; in a collection of essays entitled <span class="italic">If it had Happened otherwise</span> (ed. J. C. Squire, 1931), Fisher enjoyed himself on the question of what would have happened &#145;if Napoleon had escaped to America&#146;.<h2>
<a name="AHistoryofEurope"></a>A History of Europe</h2>It was not until the 1930s, when he was almost seventy, that Fisher settled down to write the book for which he is remembered. His <span class="italic">History of Europe</span> (3 vols., 1935) was an instant best-seller, and was a staple in the diet of schoolchildren and their elders for thirty years. He wrote it very quickly, considering that it covers the history of the entire continent from the ancient world until 1934; and after its publication Fisher took advantage of reprintings to add an epilogue bringing his judgements up to date with events down to the end of 1937. The appearance of ease is illusory; the effort of composition almost killed him. After five years of constant and intense hard work, he suffered a breakdown, and thereafter had to work more gently. <br>
<br>
<span class="italic">A History of Europe</span> remains a monument to a sensibility and a style of thought that has become old-fashioned but is neither incomprehensible nor outdated. As technical history, the work showed the defects one might expect in a book whose author had ceased to be a professional historian two decades before, and professional historians were quick to note them. Most of Fisher's readers readily forgave him the odd slip and misstatement, however. For the <span class="italic">History</span> was what David Ogg called it a few years later, &#145;an intensely moral book&#146;  (Ogg, 194) infused with an anxious liberal humanitarianism. Like many books, it is best read backwards; Fisher's judgement on the fragile condition of European civilization in the 1930s, on the catastrophic consequences of the First World War, and on the human capacity for irrational self-destruction casts its light on the earlier volumes as much as on the last volume. <br>
<br>It is a highly readable book, though the modern reader may flinch a little at the way Fisher awards good and bad marks to statesmen, cultures, economic policies, and political arrangements in the past, less perhaps because we have ceased to make such judgements than because we would rather insinuate them than openly deliver them. It was a liberal historiography that drove the <span class="italic">History</span>. The primacy of politics over economics and ideology is not flatly asserted, but events are invariably narrated in such a way as to suggest that they are forces to be managed and contained by political talent, and not themselves determinant. Political talent itself was not treated by Fisher as something simple, stable, or always admirable: ruthlessness and steely determination are not intrinsically attractive qualities, but they are often needed in politics. That the liberal democracies of the western Atlantic littoral had accommodated successfully to the pressures of industrialization and the globalization of the economy, Fisher did not doubt. He was equally sure that their success was at best fragile and precarious. His calm certainty about what constituted a humane and successful society, offset by a deep uncertainty about the chances of such a society surviving the onslaughts of militarism and nationalism, makes the <span class="italic">History</span> as readable as ever three-quarters of a century after it was written. <br>
<br>Younger and more left-wing critics disliked the <span class="italic">History</span> for predictable reasons. In the eyes of any Marxist it was theoretically na&iuml;ve, and its political vision equally so; no Marxist could agree that political leaders had the freedom of manoeuvre that Fisher appeared to allow them, nor accept that Edwardian Liberalism was the last word on political morality. Even a middle-of-the-road Liberal half a century younger than Fisher might have found too much anxiety and too little aggression in Fisher's Liberalism. He was a defender of the policy of appeasement until the bitter end, even though he admired Winston Churchill as a politician and statesman and threatened to resign from the British Academy when that body flinched at the idea of electing Churchill as a member. In the Oxford by-election of 1938, when A. D. Lindsay, the master of Balliol, stood as an &#145;anti-Munich&#146; candidate against Quintin Hogg, Fisher sided with Chamberlain and Hogg in order to give Germany a further opportunity to see reason. The wish to give appeasement every chance of success was not so obviously foolish as it appears in retrospect. <br>
<br>Fisher's public service and intellectual distinction were appropriately marked when he received the Order of Merit in 1937. It was, even so, something of a valedictory tribute, and not simply because he was seventy-two years old, with his serious intellectual, political, and educational life behind him. He represented a view of the world that had by this time lost much of its authority. His politics were those of radical Liberals such as John Morley and Lord Bryce; they were classless, rationalist, and not altogether democratic. Although he lectured to working-class audiences with great success, Fisher was not at home in a world of class or &#145;tribal&#146; politics. By the same token, the <span class="italic">History</span> is the testament of a rationalist liberalism that looks shallow to enthusiasts for history written from the bottom up, as much as it does to Marxists, or to psycho-historians hoping to apply the insights of Freud or Jung to historical narrative. In the Oxford of his day Fisher was uniquely distinguished among heads of house, and possessed of a rare administrative competence; none the less, he presided over a late flowering of an educational style and of educational ideals that the Second World War swept away. <br>
<br>When the Second World War broke out two years after the award of the Order of Merit, Fisher took up the kind of burden that came naturally to him. He chaired an appeal tribunal examining the claims of conscientious objectors, and it was while he was in London to attend a meeting of the tribunal that he was knocked down and fatally injured by a lorry. Contrary to college legend, he was not a victim of the blackout&#151;only of his habitual inattention to the physical world around him. He died in St Thomas's Hospital, London, on 18 April 1940. He left a widow and a daughter, <a href="#cosubject_96141">Mary Bennett [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Fisher was a strikingly handsome man, who looked every inch at home in the parts he played. A stiff but attractive portrait by William Nicholson, which hangs in the hall of New College, suggests the truth of David Ogg's observation that on first sight Fisher appeared to be a public institution, but on closer inspection emerged as a truly human being. <br>
<br>Fisher's daughter, <a name="cosubject_96141"></a><span class="headword">Mary Letitia Somerville Bennett <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Fisher]</span></span>  (1913&#150;2005), <span class="occ">civil servant and college head</span>, was born on 9 January 1913 at 37 Norham Road, Oxford. She was educated at Oxford high school and Somerville College, Oxford, where she obtained a second in classical moderations in 1933 and a first in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1935. One of her close friends was Isaiah Berlin, then a young prize fellow at All Souls. After graduating she gave tutorials in Roman history and started research on the Roman grain supply. In 1941 she joined the staff of the Joint Broadcasting Committee, a wartime propaganda organization, and later transferred to the transcription service of the BBC. In 1945 she joined the Colonial Office, where she initially joined the Mediterranean department, and later the east African department. She left the civil service after marrying, on 17 September 1955, a Colonial Office colleague (and musicologist), John Sloman Bennett (1914&#150;1990), son of Ralph Bennett, veterinary surgeon. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>After her marriage Mary Bennett served as secretary of the Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies and a part-time teacher at Westminster Tutors, and served on the selection board of the Elizabeth Nuffield Trust. She was an unexpected choice as principal of St Hilda's College, Oxford, in 1965, but an inspired one. Her unflappability, attention to detail, great interest in young people, and liberal tolerance were qualities highly appropriate to a college head in an age of financial strain and increasing student assertiveness. (It was thought by some of her colleagues that she indeed encouraged her students to take part in demonstrations and sit-ins.) A reassuring figure, she frequently conducted interviews with a cat on her lap, a distraction that helped calm even the most anxious of students. She oversaw a period of expansion, including a doubling of the number of fellows and the erection of several new buildings, before her retirement in 1980. When the move to open the men's colleges to women students was first mooted&#151;by New College, as it happened&#151;she shared the hostility to the idea of the principal of Lady Margaret Hall, Dame Lucy Sutherland, seeing it not as a move to expand women's access to higher education but as a self-interested device to get &#145;stupid men out and clever girls in&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 21 Nov 2005). She subsequently changed her mind, and thought St Hilda's was being much too slow in following suit. It was only after her death that her old college started to admit men. In retirement in Alma Place, Oxford, and Thursley, Surrey (where she had inherited a cottage after her mother's death), she pursued historical research relating to her forebears, including her maternal grandfather, Sir Courtenay Ilbert, and her paternal great-grandfather, John Jackson, a professor at Calcutta Medical College, published in <span class="italic">The Ilberts in India</span> (1995) and <span class="italic">Who Was Dr Jackson?</span> (2000). She remained active until near the end of her life. She died on 1 November 2005 at Rock Cottage, Highfield Lane, Thursley, Surrey, of breast cancer.<br>
