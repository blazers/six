<span class="headword">Middleton,  Elizabeth</span>  (<em>supp. </em><em>fl. </em>1637), <span class="occ">supposed poet</span>, has been claimed as author of a 173-stanza poem &#145;The Death, and Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, as it was Acted by the Bloodye Jewes, and Registred by the Blessed Evangelists&#146;, surviving in a manuscript volume assumed to belong to her (Bodl. Oxf., MS Don. e. 17). As such she has been cited as an example of an emerging category, that of early modern women writers whose work circulated privately among contemporaries, only to slip from view until rediscovered in the later twentieth century, and her work seemed representative of a sub-strand of devotional composition which exhibited very broad religious sympathies. The date 1637 appears on the title page of the first entry in the volume, a staunchly protestant prose treatise, &#145;A Soveraigne Antidote agayst Dispayre&#146;, while the third and final entry is an unattributed portion of William Austin's poem &#145;Ecce Homo&#146;, which had been known by 1628 and first published in 1635. &#145;The Death, and Passion&#146;, which is introduced by an apparent dedication, &#145;To Mrs Sara Edmondes Elizabeth Middleton wished all Health and Happynes&#146;  (fol. 13) and an acrostic poem on the name of the former, borrowed stanzas from &#145;Saint Peters Complaint&#146; by the Jesuit Robert Southwell, published after his death in 1595.<br>
<br>The &#145;curiously ecumenical nature of the manuscript volume&#146;  (Greer and others, 94) has led to Elizabeth's being tentatively identified as one of the Middletons of Denbighshire, who combined adherence to the Church of England with puritan and parliamentarian sympathies and contact with exiled Catholics; also prominent in the London mercantile and legal circles, the family had associations with leading poets and playwrights. The most likely candidate for the author of &#145;The Death, and Passion&#146; has seemed to be Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Middleton (1586&#150;1666) of Chirk Castle, a puritan active in the government of north Wales, and his second wife, Mary Napier (<i>d</i>. 1655). Born on 24 January 1619, she married Sir George Warburton of Warburton and Arley, Cheshire, and had six children. Nothing is known of her personal tastes or talents, but her sister Mary (<i>b</i>. 1620) was said to be both pious and learned. However, there were other Elizabeths among the Middletons, and this Elizabeth was only eighteen in 1637. Moreover, many of this name but from other families were baptized in London in the first decades of the seventeenth century. Likewise, there were many Sara Edmondes in the city; the suggestion that the woman referred to in the acrostic was the former Sara Harington, wife of Sir Thomas Edmondes the diplomat and a neighbour in Essex of the future Lady Warburton's grandfather Sir Thomas Middleton (1550&#150;1631), is implausible since her title was &#145;Lady&#146; and not &#145;Mistress&#146;.<br>
<br>Whoever she was, the claims of Elizabeth Middleton as a poet have been questioned. First, closer examination of &#145;her&#146; poem indicated she was largely a copyist rather than an author. Apart from plagiarism from Southwell, 130 stanzas were lifted (with one or two slight alterations in a still more Catholic direction) from another Catholic work, Ralph Bullokar's <span class="italic">A True Description of the Passion of Our Saviour Jesus Christ</span> (1622). Even the striking imagery used when talking of Judas, which indicates both familiarity with and loathing of the mercantile world, may not be original, although an extended final section depicting the thieves crucified beside Jesus may reveal an authentic voice. Such a conclusion would still invest Elizabeth Middleton with significance as an exemplar of a female copyist of Catholic leanings but eclectic tastes, expressing her piety in a medium and artistic style similar to that found in the contemporary community at Little Gidding. However, the discovery of further manuscripts in similar style to, and duplicating much of the content of MS Don. e.17, which seem to be by the same scribe but which carry different dedications by different dedicators, appear to have reduced Elizabeth Middleton to a bystander. That scribe is now revealed with some certainty as John Bourchier (<i>b</i>. 1604/5), a Lincolnshire clergyman and a moderate Calvinist with polished calligraphic skills and some poetic ability. Elizabeth Middleton's role, if any, was probably as commissioner of the manuscript volume: in that she would embody another important contribution of women to early modern literature&#151;that of patronage.<br>
