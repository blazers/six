<span class="headword">Grubb,  Wilfrid Barbrooke</span>  (1865&#150;1930), <span class="occ">missionary and explorer in Paraguay</span>, was born at Ferryhill, Liberton, Edinburgh, on 11 August 1865, the third of five children of John Barbrooke Grubb (1823&#150;1893), chemist, and his wife, Ann Mary Lang (1825&#150;1916). He was of Scottish descent, though both parents were by birth English and by denomination Anglican. He was educated at George Watson's College, Edinburgh. Not scholarly, he excelled at games. By the age of sixteen he was showing interest in religion. Two probable influences on his choice of career were the writings of the Scottish religious author Henry Drummond (1851&#150;1897) and the visit to Edinburgh in 1883 of the American evangelist Dwight Lyman Moody. Having initially contemplated overseas mission service in Africa, on or around his nineteenth birthday Grubb offered himself to the South American Missionary Society (SAMS), an Anglican organization. The society accepted him for service a year later. In the intervening period he was a lay reader and undertook other parish duties in Chobham, Surrey. In March 1886 he set sail for the society's mission base on Keppel Island in the Falklands.<br>
<br>From Keppel missionaries evangelized among the indigenous Yahgan people of Tierra del Fuego, some of whom were brought to the island for that purpose. For three years Grubb worked as a lay catechist. During this time, and largely at the prompting of Waite Hockin Stirling, first bishop of the Falkland Islands, SAMS began a new attempt (earlier efforts having proved unsuccessful) to extend its operations further into the interior of Chile, and also into Paraguay. In September 1889 Adolpho Henricksen, the leader of the Paraguayan mission, died, not long after commencing work. The society nominated Grubb as his replacement. Before he departed from Keppel in November Grubb became engaged to Mary Ann Varder Bridges (1870&#150;1922), daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70135/', "Revd Thomas Bridges")</script>, former SAMS missionary. Their engagement lasted eleven and a half years.<br>
<br>Grubb's destination was the Paraguayan Chaco, a vast, remote region, arid in parts but also with extensive areas of forest and pasture. The Chaco was sparsely populated by diverse groupings of indigenous peoples. Grubb's main priority was to locate a suitable site for a mission base. He spent much of 1890 exploring the region. Despite its remoteness the Chaco was not untouched by Western influences. Following a disastrous war that ended in 1869 the Paraguayan government, bankrupt, sold huge tracts of land to overseas business interests. By the late 1880s cattle ranches had been established, as had factories processing quebracho logs for tannin. Inevitably these developments had implications for indigenous peoples. They also affected the conditions for missionary work. Grubb's initial attempts to find a suitable permanent mission base were not successful. In late 1891, however, the representative of an English company operating in Paraguay offered land at Makthlawaiya free of charge to the mission. Grubb took advantage of this offer, and over the next four years expanded both the size of the mission and the range of its activities.<br>
<br>Grubb was fascinated by the Chaco and its people. He took every opportunity to explore and to record his observations. He later wrote that &#145;there is a sense of freedom and novelty in such a life, which people who are in normal touch with civilisation cannot possibly understand or appreciate&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Church in the Wilds</span>). He believed, not unjustifiably, that his presence among the local Lengua Indians gave him special insight into their lives. They appear, in the main, to have liked and respected him. He enhanced his reputation among them by surviving a potentially fatal assault by an ostensibly friendly Indian associate.<br>
<br>Although the mission's primary aims were evangelization and the building up of an indigenous church, Grubb insisted that the Lengua should acquire skills necessary to adapt to the demands of Western farming and industry. If they were to survive as a people, he surmised, some at least would need to become wage labourers. He intended that the mission would look after their interests, negotiating with foreign businesses and with the Paraguayan authorities on their behalf until they were able to do so themselves.<br>
<br>The number of converts remained small and some SAMS officials and supporters questioned Grubb's emphasis on &#145;industrial&#146; training; but Stirling was supportive, as was his successor as bishop from 1902, Edward Francis Every. Grubb was becoming an important asset to the society. On his first furlough, in 1896, he undertook an extensive series of promotional tours throughout England, Scotland, and Ireland. These appear to have been successful, not least because of the information about South America that Grubb was able to impart to his audiences. He was a good speaker, and illustrated his talks with lantern slides, photographs, and Lengua &#145;curios&#146; brought from Paraguay. By the time of his next furlough, in 1899&#150;1900, Grubb was becoming better known, both as a missionary and as an explorer. He presented a paper on the Chaco and its people at the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in January 1900. Returning to South America via Canada and the United States enabled him to publicize further the work of the mission and also, in New York in April, to address an international ecumenical conference on foreign missions. In 1901 he began work on a book. Based mainly on his correspondence and reports, this was published three years later as <span class="italic">Among the Indians of the Paraguayan Chaco</span>.<br>
<br>Also in 1901 Mary Bridges, who had been living with her family in Tierra del Fuego, joined Grubb in Buenos Aires. There they were married on 15 May 1901, and they spent three years together in the Chaco. Thereafter they were apart for long periods as she returned to Scotland, where their two daughters were born: Bertha in 1904 and Ethel (known as Molly) in 1909.<br>
<br>Committed to what he described as the &#145;temporal welfare&#146; of indigenous peoples, Grubb founded in 1900 a local organization to that end, the Paraguayan Chaco Indian Association. This represented a further step towards making the mission at Makthlawaiya into a self-sufficient, co-operative Christian community. However, he was by now restless and keen to evangelize and explore more widely afield. In 1909, back in London again, he secured from the general committee of SAMS permission to begin planning a mission in the Argentinian Chaco.<br>
<br>At this time the London publishing firm of Seeley &amp; Co. approached the committee, suggesting that the story of the Paraguay mission had the makings of a bestseller (with royalties that would accrue to the society). In 1911 Seeley issued <span class="italic">An Unknown People in an Unknown Land</span>. Packed with incident and ethnographic detail and not excessively religious in tone, the book made Grubb's reputation as an expert on the indigenous peoples of South America. He also published articles in learned journals and, in 1914, a further book, <span class="italic">A Church in the Wilds</span>. In June 1919 the Royal Geographical Society elected him an honorary fellow.<br>
<br>Grubb's renown helped attract recruits and funds for SAMS's work. The strain of constant travel and difficulties in setting up an &#145;industrial&#146; mission in the Argentinian Chaco adversely affected his health. Nevertheless, with other Anglican missionaries and clergy, he argued for further expansion of missionary activity in South America, in part to prevent recurrence of atrocities such as those Roger Casement exposed in the Putumayo region of Peru in 1912.<br>
<br>Grubb's health broke down and he returned home in August 1912. He recovered and resumed work in June 1913, but his thoughts turned increasingly to retirement and reunion with his wife, Mary, and their daughters, in Scotland since 1909. Not until October 1921, however, his health failing, did he finally leave South America for the last time, to settle in Lasswade, near Edinburgh. Shortly after his arrival Mary Grubb became ill, and died on 9 January 1922. Grubb continued to live at Lasswade until his death there, at his home, Springbank Lodge, on 28 May 1930. His funeral took place at St John's Church, Edinburgh. He was buried at Liberton, next to his wife, on 31 May.<br>
<br>Grubb's mission strategy represented in part an attempt to ameliorate the harmful effects of Western expansion on the indigenous peoples of the Chaco. He regarded those peoples as both childlike and independent-minded, and he viewed them with a scientific as well as a missionary eye. Through lectures, articles in journals, and books he conveyed information about Paraguay to a very wide audience (some of his writings have been translated into Spanish). In the 1920s and 1930s Seeley &amp; Co. issued many books about his life and work. These were aimed at both adults and children and they almost invariably presented the &#145;Livingstone of South America&#146;, as he had become widely known, as an exemplar of British Christian courage, endurance, and humanitarianism.<br>
