</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bantock, Sir  Granville Ransome</span>  (1868&#150;1946), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 7 August 1868 at 44 Cornwall Road, Notting Hill, London, the eldest son of an eminent surgeon and gynaecologist, George Granville Bantock (1837&#150;1913), and his wife, Sophia Elizabeth (Bessie) Ransome (1843&#150;1909). George Bantock had been born in Sutherland, where his father became gamekeeper for the infamous second duke on his Dunrobin estate. Granville Bantock's mother, from an East Anglian entrepreneurial Quaker family, was a munificent and vivacious theatre-loving woman.<br>
<br>Bantock was educated privately in London. It was not until his mid-teens that he acquired the all-abiding musical intent that led him to clash with his father over a career in the Indian Civil Service. He was then sent to the London City and Guilds Institute to study chemical engineering, but was eventually permitted private lessons in harmony and counterpoint at Trinity College of Music and on 22 September 1888 entered the Royal Academy of Music, where his primary subjects were composition and harmony under Frederick Corder. Notwithstanding a flagrant musical na&iuml;vety, he was the first recipient of the Macfarren scholarship, and was eventually appointed sub-professor in harmony. On leaving, he was given the unprecedented privilege of a complete concert of his music.<br>
<br>On leaving the Royal Academy in 1893 Bantock founded the periodical <span class="italic">New Quarterly Musical Review</span>, which ran for three years. In 1893 he conducted a burlesque, <span class="italic">Bonnie Boy Blue</span>, around the country. He then began a more lasting association with the Gaiety Company, run by George Edwardes: first on two provincial tours with <span class="italic">A Gaiety Girl</span> by O. Hall and <span class="italic">In Town</span> by A. Russell and J. T. Tanner in 1894; then abroad, with dates in the USA and Australia into 1894&#150;5&#151;characteristically, he returned with multifarious mementos, including a monkey. Over the next few years he continued to work in musical comedy, and even produced a couple of &#145;hit&#146; music hall songs. The following year he toured with Stanford's <span class="italic">Shamus O'Brien</span> around north-west England and Ireland.<br>
<br>Still unsuccessful at obtaining an academic appointment, Bantock organized two London concerts of works by himself and other young British composers&#151;the first on 15 December 1896 to some furore. There followed a stint conducting incidental music for French plays at the Royalty Theatre, London, during May and into June 1897. Then at the beginning of June he took up an appointment as musical director at the Tower Gardens, New Brighton, Cheshire. This period proved to be a turning point in his life. First, on 9 March 1898, he married Helen Francesca Maude (1868&#150;1961), daughter of Carl Adolph Herman Schweitzer. Bantock's wife was a poet and artist and was to provide numerous texts for songs and vocal works. The couple set up home at Liscard: two sons, Angus and Raymond, were born during their stay on the Wirral. Second, Bantock quickly transformed the military band at New Brighton into an orchestra of national reputation with programmes to rival those of Dan Godfrey in Bournemouth and August Manns at the Crystal Palace. He not only performed major orchestral works, but also devoted whole concerts to contemporary, often British, composers (invariably with them as guest conductors). He formed his own local choral society and took up an appointment with the Runcorn Choral Society in September 1897. He now too began to mature as a composer, escaping the dominating influence of Wagner in particular. The first of six sets of <span class="italic">Songs of the East</span> was begun just weeks after his meeting with Helen in March 1896, and <span class="italic">Elegiac Poem</span> (1898) and <span class="italic">Helena Variations</span> (1899) were highlights amid continuing, more sprawling conceptions like <span class="italic">Christus</span> (1900).<br>
<br>In 1900, backed with prestigious recommendations, Bantock became principal of the Birmingham and Midland Institute School of Music. The midlands were to become his musical home for most of his remaining career: another son, Hamilton, and a daughter, Myrrha, were born soon after the family's move south. (There was also to be another son from a later love affair with the singer Denne Parker, and it is thought there were other extra-marital liaisons.) He soon transformed the school into a vibrant musical centre, and also took up appointments with orchestral and choral societies in Liverpool, Wolverhampton, Birmingham, and Worcester. In 1908 Bantock replaced Elgar as Peyton professor of music at Birmingham University and began intertwining the teaching of the two establishments into one enterprising, broad-based system of education, with many prominent figures becoming associated with their work. Conspicuously active in the musical life of his adopted city, he was instrumental in the early establishment of a city orchestra. His involvement in the competitive festivals movement as a composer and arranger of test pieces and as a much travelled judge now also became a major aspect of his work. Though Bantock's personality possessed a strong streak of conservatism (he loathed jazz), this, like his later concern with brass bands, partly reflected his evolved political inclinations and commitment to the labour movement, which included work for the Workers' Educational Association and writing, at Keir Hardie's request, <span class="italic">Labour March</span> and other compositions for the Trades Union Congress.<br>
<br>Despite all his academic responsibilities, it was during his years in Birmingham that Bantock composed the body of work that constitutes the core of his reputation, including his best-known pieces, the tone-poem <span class="italic">Fifine at the Fair</span> (1911) and the overture <span class="italic">The Pierrot of the Minute</span> (1908). His music revealed an abiding fascination with world literature. This was manifest in orchestral works like <span class="italic">The Witch of Atlas</span> (1902) and <span class="italic">Dante and Beatrice</span> (1910), as well as in his many settings of poetry, of the Romantics in particular. From student days he had been drawn to the culture and philosophy of the East: <span class="italic">Omar Khayyam</span>, a setting of Edward FitzGerald's poem, is often regarded as his finest work. Its three parts were at first performed separately: the first at Birmingham (1906), the second at Cardiff (1907), and the final part at Birmingham again (1909). There were subsequently complete performances, notably at the Queen's Hall, London, and in Vienna.<br>
<br>Bantock also made fruitful use of oriental and Near Eastern literature, as in the charming if less ambitious string quartet <span class="italic">In a Chinese Mirror</span> (1933), and in his many settings of Chinese poets. Classical antiquity was the inspiration of some of his other excellent works, notably the <span class="italic">Pagan Symphony</span> (1923&#150;8) and <span class="italic">Sappho</span> (1906). Though fascinated by more arcane spiritualities, he turned to biblical material for his <span class="italic">Song of Songs</span> and the second of his three innovative choral &#145;symphonies&#146;, <span class="italic">Vanity of Vanities</span> (1913). He involved himself with English, Welsh, and Irish song, but his Scottish ancestral connection especially engendered a number of major scores. The most important of these were the enchanting <span class="italic">Hebridean Symphony</span> (1915) and the folk opera <span class="italic">The Seal-Woman</span> (1924), with a libretto by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40314/', "Marjory Kennedy-Fraser")</script>.<br>
<br>Although Bantock's works had long been out of favour, he was knighted in 1930. He retired from Birmingham in 1934 and moved to London to continue work and touring for Trinity College. He recorded a set of &#145;mood&#146; pieces plus a couple of more weighty works such as <span class="italic">Four Chinese Landscapes</span> (1936); the glory of his last years, the twenty-minute <span class="italic">Celtic Symphony</span> (1940), was also recorded on disc.<br>
<br>&#145;GB&#146;, as he was known, was bearded and of broad bearing; a charismatic and much loved figure, genial and kindly, open-minded and full-hearted, energetic and enthusiastic, and known for his engaging sense of humour, eccentricities, and all-consuming fads. Cultured and linguistic, he corresponded with and befriended many of the most significant artistic figures of the period. He was conspicuously generous in his support of fellow composers at home and abroad. He was one of the first advocates of Sibelius, to whom he played host on his visits to England; and in gratitude, Sibelius dedicated his third symphony to Bantock and happily accepted the first presidency of the Bantock Society.<br>
<br>A prolific composer, noted for his commanding orchestration, Bantock left behind a wide-ranging <i>&#339;uvre</i>, essentially Romantic, sometimes of grand conception, often expressly programmatic and inspired by poetic, heroic, and exotic themes. For some, his work was composed with an all-too-easy facility, lacking both self-critical restraint and an individual voice, and was too much steeped in late Victorian and Edwardian Romanticism to survive beyond its time. For others, he left behind a fascinating range of music, including works to rival even the best of his more illustrious compatriots. He arguably remains one of the most unfairly neglected figures in twentieth-century British music.<br>
<br>Bantock died in All Saints' Hospital in London on 16 October 1946, after a fall following a minor operation. His ashes were later scattered on Moelwyn above Coed-y-bleiddiau, where the family had spent so many happy holidays. In 1972 his daughter Myrrha published <span class="italic">Granville Bantock: a Personal Portrait</span>.<br>
