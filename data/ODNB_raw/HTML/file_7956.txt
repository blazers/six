<span class="headword">Doveton, Sir  John</span>  (1768&#150;1847), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, was born in St Helena, the youngest of six children (four sons and two daughters) of Jonathan Doveton (1733&#150;1792), a planter and factor on St Helena who returned to England with his family and settled at Richmond, Surrey, and his wife, Mary Harper. His elder brothers included Gabriel Doveton (1760&#150;1824), who became a major-general in the Madras native infantry and was MP for Lancaster, and Richard Doveton (1764&#150;1823), a cavalry officer in India, who was made CB in 1815.<br>
<br>After joining the forces of the Madras presidency as a cadet in 1782, Doveton entered the 1st Madras light cavalry as a cornet on 5 December 1785. He served all through the three campaigns of Lord Cornwallis against Tipu Sultan, and was promoted lieutenant on 12 June 1792. He also served in the campaign of Lieutenant-General George Harris against Tipu Sultan during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War of 1799. He specially distinguished himself at the head of part of his regiment in the rapid pursuit of the notorious warlord Dhundia Wagh, under the direction of Colonel Arthur Wellesley.<br>
<br>Doveton was promoted captain on 8 May 1800, major on 2 September 1801, and lieutenant-colonel on 15 October 1804. In 1808 he was appointed to command the expedition against Bhangarh Khan, whose camp at Amritnair he stormed on 28 December. On 14 June 1813 he was promoted colonel, and in the following year appointed with the rank of brigadier-general to command the Hyderabad contingent, which was officered by Englishmen and kept under the control of the East India Company's government, while paid by the nizam. This force, which comprised nearly 10,000 men, was cantoned round Aurangabad, and was soon brought to a high pitch of efficiency by Doveton. In the Pindari war, conducted by the marquess of Hastings, the Hyderabad contingent played an important part.<br>
<br>Doveton's most important services were rendered during the Third Anglo-Maratha War of 1817&#150;18. The Bhonsla ruler of Nagpur, Apa Sahib, who had succeeded his cousin after having him strangled, lent a ready support to the peshwa's scheme of assisting the Pindaris to overthrow British power in India. He therefore directed his troops, who were chiefly Arab mercenaries, to attack the British resident, Richard Jenkins. Though the resident's escort, commanded by Colonel Scott, beat off the assailants from the fortified hill of Sitabaldi in November 1817, its position soon became critical. Doveton, on hearing of this, advanced by forced marches on Nagpur, which he reached on 12 December. On the following day Apa Sahib surrendered himself, but his troops refused to surrender likewise. After a fierce battle, in which Doveton lost 141 men killed and wounded, the Arabs were defeated with a loss of 75 guns and 40 elephants. But they still held the city and palace of Nagpur, which Doveton attempted to storm on 24 December. The attack was repulsed, and Doveton lost over three hundred men in the assault. Yet the obstinacy of his attack terrified the Arab soldiers, who soon after agreed to evacuate the city. For his share in these operations, Doveton was made a CB on 14 October 1818 and a KCB on 26 November 1819.<br>
<br>In April 1819 Doveton commanded the forces which besieged and captured Asirgarh. On 12 August the same year he was promoted major-general. The following year he resigned his command and retired to Madras. He was promoted lieutenant-general and made a GCB on 10 January 1837. He died at his house in Madras on 7 November 1847, aged seventy-nine. He is to be distinguished from his namesake, who was also born in St Helena and pursued a military career in India, Sir John Doveton (1783&#150;1857).<br>
