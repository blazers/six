<span class="headword">Caroe, Sir  Olaf Kirkpatrick Kruuse</span>  (1892&#150;1981), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born in London on 15 November 1892, eldest of the three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32298/', "William Douglas Car&#246;e (1857&#150;1938)")</script>, architect and son of the Danish consul in Liverpool, and his wife, Grace Desborough (<i>d</i>. 1947), daughter of John Rendall, barrister. From Winchester College, where his maternal uncle Montague Rendall was headmaster, he won a demyship to read classics at Magdalen College, Oxford, entering in 1911. In 1914, on the outbreak of war, he enlisted in the Royal West Surrey regiment, rising to the rank of captain.<br>
<br>To his delight, Caroe spent the whole of the war in India. There, in addition to rather tedious military duties, he began to learn Urdu and Pashto and explored Indian architecture and landscape. India held for him a certain magic, a mixture of Edwardian duty and the thrill of the exotic preserved from childhood readings of Kipling and Flora Annie Steele. He was determined to return after the war. His regiment went home in November 1919 and two months later, on 10 January 1920, he married his pre-war girlfriend, Frances Marion 
    (Kitty; <i>d</i>. 1969)
  , eldest child of Atherton Gwillym Rawstorne, bishop of Whalley. Later the same year, having topped the post-war service examinations, he returned to India as a member of the Indian Civil Service. Kitty, to whom he was devoted, followed in 1921 with the first of their two sons.<br>
<br>In October 1923, after three years' service in the Punjab, Caroe managed to obtain a transfer to the Indian political service and was posted to the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) as city magistrate of Peshawar. Postings in Mardan and Kohat followed, before, in 1929, he was appointed secretary to the NWFP chief commissioner. In April 1930 he was dispatched as acting deputy commissioner to Peshawar when the city was paralysed by crowds protesting against the arrest of the brothers Dr Khan Sahib and Abdul Ghaffar Khan, local leaders of the Indian National Congress. Caroe reoccupied the city peacefully on 5 May, but trouble flared again and in one incident he ordered troops to fire on an unruly crowd, killing about a dozen people. Although the government saw no need to censure him (and indeed confirmed him as deputy commissioner and in 1932 appointed him CIE), the affair was subsequently invoked by the Congress as proof of his antipathy to Indians.<br>
<br>In 1933 Caroe was appointed chief secretary to the North-West Frontier Province government and then, in 1934, deputy secretary to the government of India's foreign (external affairs) department. In July 1939 he was promoted to foreign secretary. In this capacity he made official visits to Afghanistan and Nepal and focused attention on India's vulnerable north-eastern frontier, the beginning for him of an abiding interest in Tibetan autonomy. Appointed CSI in 1941, he was promoted to KCIE in 1944 and KCSI in 1945.<br>
<br>In March 1946 Caroe was appointed governor of the North-West Frontier Province. The province had a new Congress ministry headed by Dr Khan Sahib which, to Caroe's eyes, showed dangerous signs of interfering with the executive. The viceroy, Lord Wavell, was sympathetic, but privately he believed that Caroe had not adjusted to the idea of Britain leaving India. As Caroe tried to guide and discipline the new ministry, rumours spread that he favoured the Muslim League. This was not true (he had a particular dislike of Jinnah), but he felt constrained to warn Khan Sahib that, given his Pathan constituency, he ought not to appear to be taking instructions from plains-dwelling Hindus&#151;advice which led to Nehru's charge that he was unfit to be governor. As popular opposition to the ministry swelled, Caroe pressured Khan Sahib to go to the polls, further antagonizing Nehru. No election could be fair, Nehru argued, while an anti-Congress governor held sway. Stung by the accusation of partiality, Caroe refused to offer his resignation, but he was tired and, as a slightly built, sensitive man, he appeared to his colleagues to be close to collapse. In June 1947 Mountbatten succeeded in persuading him to take two months' leave while a provincial referendum was held. Caroe understood this to be a temporary expedient, but afterwards, even though the province had voted to join Pakistan no offer came for him to return to duty. With hindsight Caroe was glad he went when he did. He thought partition a dreadful mistake, but consoled himself that he at least had retained friends on all sides, including the Khan brothers and eventually even Nehru. In old age he was proud to have been the only British ex-governor invited back as a state guest by both Pakistan and India.<br>
<br>In retirement in Sussex Caroe championed Tibetan independence and, after the Lhasa uprising of 1959, founded the Tibet Society of the United Kingdom, which assisted in the resettlement of Tibetan refugees. He was also a leading member of the Royal Central Asian Society and the Conservative Commonwealth Council. Among his friends he counted Harold Macmillan and Lionel Curtis, for the latter of whom he wrote extensively in the <span class="italic">Round Table</span>. He published several books, including <span class="italic">Soviet Empire</span> (1953), intended as a riposte to left-wingers who condemned only capitalist forms of imperialism; <span class="italic">The Pathans</span> (1958), which gained him the degree of LLD from Oxford; and, with Sir Evelyn Howell, a translation from the work of the seventeenth-century Pashto poet Khushhal Khan (1963). A devout Anglican, he also chaired the Chichester diocesan pastoral reorganization committee.<br>
<br>In January 1969 Kitty died, plunging Caroe into loneliness. He continued to write on central Asian affairs, but increasingly concentrated on putting the record straight about his service in the North-West Frontier Province. He reworked numerous drafts of an autobiography and responded in point-by-point detail to memoirs and monographs published on the transfer of power era. Caroe died on 23 November 1981 in hospital, and was privately cremated on the 27th. He was survived by his two sons, Richard and Michael.<br>
