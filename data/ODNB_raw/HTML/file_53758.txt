<span class="headword">Moorosi <span class="st"> [Morosi]</span></span>  (<em>c.</em>1795&#150;1879), <span class="occ">ruler of the Ngwe (Putili) and warrior</span>, was born, oral evidence suggests, at Mohale's Hoek in the south of what became Lesotho. His father, Mokuoane, Ngwe (Putili) ruler, became a vassal of the Sotho leader Moshoeshoe in the late 1820s. When Moorosi succeeded to the relatively small chiefdom some years later he acknowledged Moshoeshoe as his suzerain, but sought as much independence as possible, and in 1846 moved south of the Orange River. When that area was annexed by the British in 1850 he returned to the south of what later became Lesotho, to a rugged mountainous area close to the Orange River. He aided Moshoeshoe against the forces of Sir George Cathcart in 1851&#150;2, and fought with the Sotho against the Orange Free State in the wars of 1858 and 1865, gaining a reputation as an able military leader, a good shot, and a skilled rider. Towards the end of 1865 he retreated to a natural fortress, a mountain with three almost sheer rocky sides which rises above the junction of the Quthing and Orange rivers. He soon found that his territory was part of the area which had come under British protection as Basutoland.<br>
<br>After Cape Colony took over Basutoland in 1871 Moorosi was at first little troubled by the magistrate of Cornet Spruit, but in May 1877 a separate magistracy was created at nearby Quthing. Early the following year the tactless new magistrate, Hamilton Hope, issued a writ against some subjects of Moorosi's son Lehana (Doda) who had not paid tax, then insisted on referring the matter to Moshoeshoe's successor, Letsie. That matter blew over, but later in the year Hope's successor, John Austen, arrested Lehana, this time on a trumped-up charge of stock theft. Lehana was gaoled at Quthing prior to being sent away, but was sprung from gaol on his father's orders. Moorosi then refused to surrender him. In February 1879, anticipating that Moorosi would go into full-scale rebellion, Austen abandoned the magistracy, which Moorosi's men then pillaged.<br>
<br>Moorosi then mobilized his forces on his natural stronghold, to which Cape colonial forces laid siege. Numerous attempts were made to take the mountain, but Moorosi's people put up valiant resistance, which included a number of daring sorties from the mountain. In September Colonel Brabant of the Cape mounted rifles met Moorosi part way up the mountain to persuade him to end his resistance, and another such meeting took place the following month, when Sir Gordon Sprigg (1830&#150;1913), the Cape prime minister, met Moorosi, but on each occasion the chief refused to surrender unconditionally. In late November the commanding officer of the Cape mounted rifles led the final assault, which began with artillery bombardment, took three days, and included the use of scaling ladders. Forty-three members of the colonial force were killed before the mountain was taken on 20 November. Moorosi himself died that day, along with most of the other defenders. His head was cut off and exposed on a pole, then sent to King William's Town. After protest from Whitehall it was returned for burial with his body on the mountain which still bears his name.<br>
