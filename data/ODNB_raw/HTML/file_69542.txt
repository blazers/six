<span class="headword">Nuthall,  Betty May</span>  (1911&#150;1983), <span class="occ">tennis player</span>, was born at Sutherland House, Kingston, Surrey, on 23 May 1911, the daughter of Stuart Nuthall, a club proprietor, and his wife, Mary Madge James. Her parents were both keen tennis players and taught her to regard the game &#145;as one of the most important &hellip; as well as <i>the</i> jolliest, in the world&#146;. Coached by her father, she was &#145;never allowed to knock a ball about just for the sake of doing so&#146;, but had always to improve  (Nuthall, 13&#150;14). The intensive training produced results: she developed into a &#145;fine aggressive player&#146; and won the British junior singles championships three times in succession  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 10 Nov 1983). She became a familiar figure in British tennis from the age of nine, and spectators queued early for her Wimbledon d&eacute;but in 1927, when she defeated the German Cilly Aussem. She went on to beat the reigning American champion, Anna (Molla) Mallory, before losing to Helen Jacobs in the quarter-finals. In 1927 she also became, at sixteen, the joint youngest finalist in the history of the US ladies' singles championship, when she was beaten 6&#150;1, 6&#150;4 by Helen Wills Moody. For this match she served underarm, as she was then accustomed to do, but she soon afterwards made the change to overarm. She also reached the final of the ladies' doubles at Forest Hill that year, and became the youngest player to represent Britain in the Wightman cup, when she defeated Helen Jacobs in her first match. In all she made eight Wightman cup appearances between 1927 and 1939.<br>
<br>When she was still only seventeen, Nuthall went into print with a textbook for the beginner, <span class="italic">Learning Lawn Tennis</span> (1928), to which her mother wrote a preface. But she proved unable to sustain the remarkable momentum built up in 1927. Her only major title in the next two years was the mixed doubles at the US championships in 1929. As a result she was bypassed for the Wightman cup team in 1930. She marked her omission by becoming the first British player to win the US ladies' singles championship, defeating the top seed, Anna McCune Harper, in the final 6&#150;1, 6&#150;4. Nuthall also won the ladies' doubles title with Sarah Palfrey. She enjoyed another remarkable year abroad in 1931, when she won the ladies' doubles and the mixed doubles at both the American and French championships. She also reached the final of the ladies' singles in France. The defence of her US singles title at Forest Hill ended in a semi-final defeat by her Wightman cup team-mate and occasional doubles partner Eileen Bennett Whitingstall.<br>
<br>In 1932 Nuthall retained the mixed doubles at the French championship, with Fred Perry, and the following year she secured her third and final ladies' doubles title in the US championship. In 1933 she also reached the semi-final of the ladies' singles at Forest Hill, impressing onlookers by pushing Helen Wills Moody to three sets, 2&#150;6, 6&#150;3, 6&#150;2. In five of the seven years during which she was at her peak (1927&#150;33) Nuthall was ranked in the world's top ten.<br>
<br>Nuthall was a good tactical player, equipped with &#145;aggressive forcing strokes&#146; and an especially powerful forehand  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 10 Nov 1983). She played at speed and hit hard, with good judgement of line and length. Ultimately, though, she lacked the strategic awareness of opponents' strengths and weaknesses that is the mark of enduring champions. Despite her success abroad, in particular at Forest Hill, Nuthall never advanced to the final stages at Wimbledon. There was special disappointment in 1931, when she was defeated in straight sets in the quarter-final by Helen Jacobs. Nuthall later married Franklin C. Shoemaker and made her home in the United States. She died in New York on 8 November 1983.<br>
