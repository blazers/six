<span class="headword">Leybourne,  George</span> <span class="st"> [<em>performing name </em>Champagne Charlie]</span>  (1842&#150;1884), <span class="occ">music-hall entertainer</span>, popularly known as Champagne Charlie, was born on 17 March 1842 in Stourbridge, Gateshead, the son of Joseph Leybourne, a currier and sometime theatre musician, and his wife, Isabella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bullerwell. Leybourne's early life remains obscure and misreported, but he is known to have moved to London with his family at the age of three. Poorly educated, he worked first as an engine fitter or engineer, and began his career as an entertainer in his late teens under the stage name Joe Saunders, playing the smaller music-halls and penny gaffs of London's East End and the provinces. He married Sarah Ann Fisher, a former dressmaker's apprentice, on 12 March 1865 in London. A versatile performer, he was by then appearing under his real name at the major metropolitan halls, singing and dancing in a variety of styles.<br>
<br>In 1866, already enjoying considerable popularity, Leybourne became a major star with the hit song &#145;Champagne Charlie&#146;, written in collaboration with Alfred Lee. Typical of a new genre of commercially produced music-hall songs and performed with a self-assertive comic realism, it celebrated the exploits of the swell, a lordly man about town of resplendent dress, confident air, and heroic appetite for champagne and admiring women. Leybourne was one of a new generation of young male stars in the same style&#151;the <i>lions comiques</i>&#151;but secured his prominence with a well-publicized contract with the music-hall proprietor William Holland at London's Canterbury Hall in 1868. In return for the sensational annual salary of &pound;1500, Leybourne was obliged to play the swell off as well as on stage, appearing richly dressed at all times, driving to engagements in a carriage and four, and plying his public with champagne provided by the wine shippers. Tall, handsome, and with a &#145;curious faculty of filling the stage&#146;, Leybourne scandalized polite society with his vulgar appropriation of upper-class dress and manners, but offered a compelling model for young lower middle- and working-class male aspirants to gentility, who popularized the Champagne Charlie hat in his honour. (The Salvation Army paid homage by converting his hit into a hymn.) In 1869&#150;70, in acknowledgement of his own working-class roots and in a rare political statement, Leybourne gave benefit performances in support of the Nine Hours Movement for a shorter working day. He did not, however, reduce his own work schedule. Widely employed in London, he also undertook frequent provincial tours, living out the same flamboyant and demanding persona and establishing himself as a national as well as a metropolitan favourite. He made his family home in London, though he moved several times; recorded addresses include Islington and Kennington (a music-hall artists' colony). There were allusions to a country estate. Leybourne was accused of sharp practice by fellow artists, and proprietors complained of his unpunctuality, but his public loved him. According to an oft-repeated story, in private he despaired of the emptiness of fame and the absence of true friendship amid the enthusiastic crowds, yet he remained the good fellow of his most successful stage role; dubbed &#145;honorary high almoner to the profession&#146;, he was notably generous with hand-outs as well as drink. Leybourne enjoyed success with other song hits&#151;&#145;The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze&#146; (1866), &#145;Up in a Balloon&#146; (1868), &#145;If ever I cease to love&#146; (1871)&#151;but continued to style himself the Original Champagne Charlie. His later career is difficult to assess. He seems to have retained his popularity, but his health declined and his appearances became more sporadic. He ventured into management in minor London halls and experimented with a double act with his daughter, Florence. (Florence later married the music-hall star <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32394/', "Albert Chevalier")</script>; Leybourne's other child, George junior, became Chevalier's manager.) Reports of Leybourne's increasing indispositions attributed them to consumption, but his death certificate records exhaustion and abscess (perhaps cirrhosis) of the liver. Much indebted, he died on 15 September 1884 at his home, 136 Englefield Road, Islington, London, and was buried at Abney Park cemetery, Stoke Newington, on 20 September.<br>
<br>In keeping with music-hall's increasing pretensions to respectability, later spokesmen for the industry disavowed Leybourne and the <i>lions comiques</i> as &#145;the most vulgar and objectionable creatures&#146; who &#145;gloried in sex and drink&#146; and &#145;turned the music halls into veritable sinks&#146;. More recent scholarly critics have not liked Leybourne and his kind any better, interpreting their songs in praise of the aristocratic style as a dilution of an older, more combative working-class consciousness and a damning example of music-hall's social conservatism. The upper-class swell and his variants have none the less proved a durable type in the popular repertory, and Leybourne himself underwent some rehabilitation in the 1944 film <span class="italic">Champagne Charlie</span> (featuring comedian Tommy Trinder in the name part), though this paid scant regard to historical accuracy.<br>
<br>Leybourne was a product of the music-halls' first great boom, and his career exemplified the opportunities and hazards of stardom in a prototype modern capitalist entertainment industry. Embodying traditional elements of male licence in carnivalesque pursuit of the good time, his characterizations also gave voice to the more culturally assertive mid-Victorian lower classes in an era of increased earnings, greater leisure time, more and cheaper consumer goods (including champagne), and the extension of the franchise. Leybourne's style of &#145;magnificent cheek&#146; was that of the common man on the rise in a modern liberal democracy, though any delusions were undercut by a strong note of parody.<br>
