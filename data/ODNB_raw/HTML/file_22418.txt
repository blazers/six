<span class="headword">Pocahontas</span> <span class="st"> [Matoaka, Amonute; <em>married name </em>Rebecca Rolfe]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1596&#150;1617), <span class="occ">Algonquian Indian princess</span>, was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71111/', "Chief Powhatan (or Wahunsonacock) (d. 1618)")</script> of the Virginia Algonquian nation. Probably named Matoaka at birth, she was a prepubescent youngster and her father's favourite daughter and known as Pocahontas&#151;translated by William Strachey as &#145;little-wanton&#146;  (Strachey, 113) or in modern terms &#145;playful one&#146;&#151;when she, according to Captain John Smith, saved his life after the Powhatans captured him in December 1607. Anthropological evidence suggests that she more likely performed a symbolic role in a Powhatan adoption ceremony or a peripheral role in an alliance that Powhatan attempted to form with Smith, who misunderstood the message. Thereafter she frequently visited James Fort, where she turned naked cartwheels, cavorted with the English boys, and began to learn English. According to Smith, she also provided the Jamestown colonists with essential food and, at risk of her life, crucial information about her father's intended attacks on the colony. Many years later Smith attested to Queen Anne that &#145;during the time of two or three yeeres, she next under God, was &hellip; the instrument to preserve this Colonie from death, famine and utter confusion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Works</span>, 2.259).<br>
<br>Pocahontas's contact with the outpost temporarily ended with Smith's return to England in the autumn of 1609 and the resumption of Anglo-Indian warfare. Between 1609 and 1612, according to Strachey, Pocahontas was married for two or more years to an American Indian captain named Kocoum; if so, the fate of her marriage and of her husband remain mysterious. Presumably she was unmarried in April 1613, when Captain Samuel Argall bribed the Patawomeck natives with whom she was then living to entice her aboard his ship. Argall detained Pocahontas as a hostage to end Powhatan's attacks on the colonists and to force his return of English prisoners and weapons. Powhatan soon capitulated, inaugurating nearly a decade of peace between the principal antagonists in coastal Virginia.<br>
<br>While in captivity at Jamestown, Pocahontas succumbed to the proselytizing of Reverend Alexander Whitaker and the romantic entreaties of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24018/', "John Rolfe (1585&#150;1622)")</script>, a survivor of the famous shipwreck on Bermuda in 1609 and a recent widower. In early April 1614, Whitaker reported, she &#145;openly renounced her countrey Idolatry, confessed the faith of Jesus Christ, and was baptised&#146;  (Hamor, 59&#150;60) and renamed Rebecca. At about the same time Rolfe asked the governor's permission to marry &#145;one whose education hath bin rude, her manners barbarous, her generation accursed, and &hellip; discrepant in all nurtriture from my selfe&#146;  (Hamor, 64). John Rolfe and Rebecca were married at Jamestown in April 1614. The following year she gave birth to a son, Thomas.<br>
<br>The Virginia Company of London recognized in the Rolfes a unique opportunity to offset some of the colony's discouraging reputation. Investors and trustworthy migrants shunned an outpost that had a harsh climate and few amenities, little promise of prosperity (Rolfe's experiments with West Indian tobacco had just begun), and a frightful mortality rate from disease and American Indian hostility. Pocahontas was living proof that Indians not only could be friendly neighbours but, with proper encouragement, could become almost indistinguishable from English men and women. And in contrast to earlier Powhatan visitors to England, Pocahontas claimed nobility: her father was variously described as a prince, king, or emperor. She was also a practising Christian, wore fashionable clothing, spoke fluent English, and carried herself with the grace and dignity befitting a &#145;lady&#146;. She was married to an English gentleman and was raising their son in accordance with English customs. The company directed Sir Thomas Dale to bring Pocahontas to England.<br>
<br>In June 1616 the Rolfes and perhaps a dozen Powhatans arrived in London, where Pocahontas was lodged in the Bell Savage on Ludgate Hill, an old hostelry and former theatre named for the Savage family which had originally owned it. The Indian princess was suddenly the talk of the town and much in demand at quasi-public functions. The queen received her at Whitehall; the bishop of London hosted a dinner in her honour at Lambeth Palace; King James treated her &#145;graciously&#146; at a masque by Ben Jonson; and the Dutch artist Simon de Passe engraved her portrait. By the autumn of 1616 the Rolfes had moved from London's noxious air to a house in the suburban village of Brentford, where she had a poignant visit from John Smith. She had been told after his departure from Virginia that he was dead: &#145;your Countriemen &hellip; lie much&#146;, she lamented. But now that Pocahontas was in England and knew that he was alive, she wanted to call him &#145;father&#146; and him to call her &#145;childe, and so I will bee for ever and ever your Countrieman&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Works</span>, 2.261).<br>
<br>It was to be a short &#145;for ever&#146;. Pocahontas's health deteriorated rapidly in the winter of 1616&#150;17. In mid-March 1617 the Rolfes boarded ship for Virginia, but Pocahontas, suffering probably from tuberculosis or pneumonia, was too weak to travel. She was put ashore at Gravesend, Kent, where &#145;she came &hellip; to her end and grave&#146;  (Purchas, 19.118). Her body was interred on 21 March 1617 in the chancel of St George's Church. Pocahontas had played a key role in early Indian&#150;English contact in Virginia and contributed significantly to the survival of the first permanent English colony in America. In the final year of her life she was the leading exemplar of English efforts to Anglicize the Native Americans.<br>
<br>John Rolfe, fearing that his son could not survive the ocean voyage, left him in the care of Sir Lewis Stukeley in Plymouth and subsequently of Henry Rolfe, John's youngest brother, in London. In the 1630s, many years after his father's and maternal grandfather's deaths, Thomas, then about twenty years old, migrated to Virginia, where he spent the remainder of his life. He prospered by growing the variety of tobacco his father had introduced on lands that had originally belonged to his mother's kin. In Virginia, Thomas married Jane Poythress and left numerous descendants who cherished their lineage from the Indian princess.<br>
<br>Pocahontas's eventful life soon entered American legend. Drawing especially on the accounts of the Indian princess in Captain John Smith's <span class="italic">Generall Historie</span> (1624), historians, dramatists, poets, and novelists since the eighteenth century have fashioned disparate versions of her life. Early Virginia narratives often featured her prominently in the colony's founding and eventual success because of her conversion to Christianity, her marriage to an Englishman, and their union's brief promise of an amalgamated Indian&#150;English society. Nineteenth-century authors emphasized&#151;and argued the authenticity of&#151;her rescue of Smith, with northern writers generally sceptical, southern writers generally supportive. Numerous painters, printmakers, and sculptors were also inspired by her short but dramatic life, as epitomized in two prominently displayed works in the United States Capitol: a bas relief (1825) of her rescue of Smith, and a painting (1840) of her baptism. Recent biographies and novels, by contrast, have stressed her cultural marginality. Perhaps the most widely disseminated but least accurate representations are two animated feature films by Walt Disney studios: <span class="italic">Pocahontas</span> (1995), on her life in Virginia and romance with John Smith, and <span class="italic">Pocahontas II</span> (1998) on her visit to England, in which, healthy and happy, she returns to Virginia.<br>
