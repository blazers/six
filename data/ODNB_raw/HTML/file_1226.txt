<span class="headword">Ballantine,  James</span>  (1807/8&#150;1877), <span class="occ">stained-glass artist and writer</span>, was born in Edinburgh, the son of James Ballantine, a brewer, and his wife, Margaret Anderson. He served an apprenticeship with David Roberts, then working as an Edinburgh house decorator and theatrical scenery painter, and also studied draughtsmanship at the Trustees' Academy in Edinburgh. His specialization in the neglected art of glass staining was almost certainly the result of time spent at an English studio&#151;perhaps in Newcastle upon Tyne&#151;and clearly gave him sufficient confidence in his mastery of the medium to set up his own company in Edinburgh in 1837 and publish <span class="italic">A Treatise on Painted Glass</span> in 1845. Despite advocating domestic use of stained glass and criticizing &#145;antiquing&#146; of new glass, this work was conservative in approach and did not advocate any radical departures in terms of subject matter or technique.<br>
<br>Early successes included a number of windows for the House of Lords (1843), a set of armorial windows based on David Roberts's designs for the Scott monument, Edinburgh (1847), and an extensive scheme for St John's Episcopal Church, Edinburgh (1850s). The 1850s also brought controversy when Ballantine's scheme for Glasgow Cathedral was overruled by a committee which favoured the enamelled glass produced by the royal Bavarian glassworks in Munich. Pompously declaring the Munich glass superior to any native product, the committee ensured a national outcry and a consequent flurry of commissions to salve the injured pride of Ballantine. Notable later work included windows for Ibrox parish church, Glasgow (<i>c</i>.1863), the choir of St Giles's Cathedral, Edinburgh (1874&#150;7), and Dunfermline Abbey (from 1873). The last two, based on designs by Robert Herdman and Joseph No&euml;l Paton respectively, are of particular note and did much to vindicate the quality of indigenous glass staining.<br>
<br>In parallel with his business career, Ballantine enjoyed a considerable reputation as a poet and writer. Recognized as an authority on Robert Burns, he wrote songs and verses of his own which owe much to Burns's idiom. These appeared periodically in <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> and were then collected and published from 1843 in a series of monthly parts as <span class="italic">The Gaberlunzie's Wallet</span>. Songs such as &#145;Bonnie Bonaly&#146;, &#145;Ilka Blade o'Grass&#146;, and &#145;Castles in the Air&#146; were among the most popular songs of their time, but seem to have enjoyed no enduring success. Other notable publications include the <span class="italic">Miller of Deanhaugh</span> (1845) and <span class="italic">Lilias Lee</span> (1871), a tale in Spenserian verse. His <span class="italic">Life of David Roberts, R.A.</span> (1866) is a fulsome eulogy of the man whose brushes he had once cleaned and who set him on the path to become the chief revivalist of Scottish ecclesiastical stained glass. Ballantine died at Harrender Lodge, Edinburgh, on 18 December 1877, aged sixty-nine; he was survived by his wife, Henrietta, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Miller; his legacy was sustained by his son Alexander and grandson, James, both successful stained-glass artists. Another son, James, was a house painter.<br>
