<span class="headword">Congreve,  Richard</span>  (1818&#150;1899), <span class="occ">positivist</span>, was born at Leamington Hastings, Warwickshire, on 4 September 1818, the third son of Thomas Congreve, a farmer, and his wife, Julia. After attending the school run by his uncle Walter Bury in Boulogne, he spent five years (1832&#150;7) at Rugby School, acquiring the moral earnestness, religious latitudinarianism, and political Liberalism characteristic of its headmaster, Dr Thomas Arnold. In 1837 Congreve entered Wadham College, Oxford, on a scholarship; he earned his BA with a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1840, and proceeded MA in 1843. His social idealism found expression at the Oxford Union, of which he was president in 1841, and in &#145;the Decade&#146;, a debating society which included his Rugby contemporaries Arthur Hugh Clough and Matthew Arnold. Congreve took clerical orders in 1843, was elected a fellow of Wadham in 1844, and after a period as an assistant master at Rugby, returned to Wadham in 1848 as a tutor. In the following years he was active in the struggle for university reform with A. P. Stanley, Benjamin Jowett, Mark Pattison, and Goldwin Smith, colleagues he at times found insufficiently ardent.<br>
<br>Congreve's impatience with compromise on many issues accounts for his attraction to the systematic ideas of Auguste Comte. After the revolution of 1848, Congreve visited the philosopher in Paris several times and was encouraged by him to study the positivist philosophy, polity, and religion in relation to British history and politics. Determining to do so free of Oxford's constraints, Congreve resigned his fellowship in June 1854 and moved to Wandsworth, Surrey, planning to earn his living by tutoring. Marriage in the same year to his cousin Maria, daughter of J. Bury, a Coventry surgeon, provided unquestioning devotion that helped him withstand the coming storm of criticism.<br>
<br>Maria Congreve's family in Warwickshire had known George Eliot, and when she and George Henry Lewes settled in Wandsworth in 1859 they became friends of the Congreves and gave moral and financial support to the positivist mission. Congreve could also count on encouragement from three former Wadham pupils&#151;Frederic Harrison, John Henry Bridges, and Edward Spencer Beesly. Early fruits of his positivist studies were his tendentious notes to a new edition of Aristotle's <span class="italic">Politics</span> (1855); his endorsement of temporary dictatorship in modern Europe in <span class="italic">The Roman Empire of the West</span> (1855); and two anti-imperialist pamphlets, <span class="italic">Gibraltar</span> and <span class="italic">India</span> (1857). Comte, who had urged him to write the first, demanding Britain's immediate surrender of Gibraltar to Spain, was so gratified by it that in 1857 he appointed Congreve head of his British disciples. They were, however, few in number, and all subject to ridicule. Undeterred, Congreve published a translation of Comte's <span class="italic">Cat&eacute;chisme positiviste</span> in 1858, expounding the &#145;religion of humanity&#146;, and in 1866 earned membership of the Royal College of Physicians, solely as a prerequisite for the positivist priesthood. Meanwhile he was drawing fire for supporting the trade unions' struggle for legal status, and advocating Irish independence, a liberal foreign policy, and parliamentary reform.<br>
<br>In written controversy Congreve could hold his own, but when he delivered an important series of public lectures on positivism in 1867 even his friend George Eliot found his delivery &#145;chilling&#146;. Although also aware of his limitations, in 1870 Harrison, Bridges, and Beesly, with others now calling themselves positivists, leased a small hall at 19 (now 20 Rugby Street) Chapel Street, off Lamb's Conduit Street, London, as a meeting-place and accepted Congreve's leadership. He moved to nearby Mecklenburgh Square, and soon began administering Comte's version of baptism. There were hymns and invocations to Humanity and pronouncements on political issues. By 1877 Congreve had completed volume four of the British positivists' four-volume translation of Comte's <span class="italic">Syst&egrave;me de politique positive</span>. Given all this activity, he was understandably irritated by the slackness of Comte's successor in Paris, Pierre Laffitte. By declaring his independence from the Paris leader in 1878, Congreve precipitated a schism in his own movement that had been long brewing. He remained at Chapel Street while his most distinguished followers, Harrison, Bridges, and Beesly, opened their own centre, Newton Hall.<br>
<br>Following the schism, Congreve introduced additional rituals, justifying T. H. Huxley's jibe that positivism was &#145;Catholicism minus Christianity&#146;. But he eschewed sacerdotal garb: his photographs in his <span class="italic">Historical Lectures</span> and the third volume of his <span class="italic">Essays Political, Social and Religious</span> (both edited by his wife in 1900) show a benevolent-looking, patrician gentleman. In his last years he wrote largely on religious subjects, and despite chronic bad health, led his small congregation until his death at Home Lodge, Worsley Road, Hampstead, London, on 5 July 1899. His widow stayed on at their last address, 55 Palace Gardens, Kensington, until her death in 1915. Only then did the rival positivist congregations unite.<br>
