<span class="headword">Corfe,  Joseph</span>  (1740&#150;1820), <span class="occ">singer and organist</span>, was born in Salisbury on 25 December 1740 and baptized on 9 February 1741, the son of Joseph Corfe (<i>b</i>. 1705). The family had evidently lived there since 1692, when his paternal grandfather (John, (<i>d</i>. 1743)) was appointed a lay vicar of the cathedral. Of the five sons in the next generation, all but Corfe's own father were musicians. It is hardly surprising therefore that the boy was brought up as a chorister under Dr John Stephens, then organist of Salisbury Cathedral, and subsequently apprenticed to him. In 1759 Corfe was made a tenor lay vicar, and, with the encouragement of James (Hermes) Harris, he became increasingly involved in the musical life of the city; he also sang regularly at the Three Choirs festival between 1764 and 1768 (and elsewhere later). On 14 April 1766 he married Mary Bernard, and the first of their six children, four sons and two daughters, was born the following year; only three, however, were still alive when Corfe made his will in 1814.<br>
<br>When Stephens died in December 1780 Corfe made an unsuccessful bid for the organistship of the cathedral, which post eventually came his way on the death of the victorious candidate, Robert Parry, in July 1792. In the meantime, however, his vocal ability (supported no doubt by the interest of Robert Lowth, bishop of London, to whom he had been introduced by Harris) had gained him, in February 1783, a place as gentleman of the Chapel Royal. Six months later he was elected a member of the Royal Society of Musicians, in whose admissions records he is described as &#145;Director of the Concert&#146; at Salisbury. This latter appointment&#151;regarded by some simply as a consolation prize for his earlier having failed to gain the cathedral organistship&#151;evidently gave rise to much acrimonious dispute among local music lovers, a vivid account of which is to be found in the diary of John Marsh. From numerous other references in the same source, it is clear that Corfe was not only an accomplished vocal soloist, but also a competent organist and violinist who could, as need arose, play the double bass as well.<br>
<br>Though a service in B[flat] and one or two anthems were still in use some fifty years after his death, Corfe is of no consequence as a composer, and most of his published work consists of arrangements, either of Scottish folksongs or of music by well-known composers of the period (such as Sacchini, Paisiello, Haydn, and Pleyel); for example, three sets of <span class="italic">Twelve Glees</span> (1791&#150;8) and two volumes of <span class="italic">Sacred Music</span> (1800?). He was also the author of <span class="italic">A Treatise on Singing</span> (1799) and a book entitled <span class="italic">Thorough Bass Simplified</span> (1805). In November 1804 Corfe resigned his post of organist of Salisbury Cathedral in favour of his eldest surviving son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6313/', "Arthur Thomas Corfe (1773&#150;1863)")</script>, a pupil of Benjamin Cooke and Clementi. Another son, John (<i>b</i>. 1769), had been active on the London musical scene as singer, cellist, and double bass player in the Drury Lane orchestra, but was apparently dead by 1799. Joseph Corfe himself died at his home in Salisbury on 29 July 1820 and was buried in the north-west transept of the cathedral.<br>
