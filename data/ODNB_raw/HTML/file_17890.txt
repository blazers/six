<span class="headword">Mallet,  Robert</span>  (1810&#150;1881), <span class="occ">civil engineer and scientist</span>, was born at Ryder's Row in Dublin on 3 June 1810, the son of John and Thomasina Mallet. His father came from Devon in 1780 to join his uncle's brass and copper founding business. Mallet received his early education at Bective House in Dublin and entered Trinity College, Dublin, in December 1826, where he studied mathematics and science, graduating BA in 1830.<br>
<br>In 1831 Mallet became a partner in his father's works, the same year marrying Cordelia Watson (<i>d</i>. 1854); the marriage produced three sons and three daughters. He took charge of the Victoria foundry, greatly expanding it and securing large contracts for much of the railway plant, permanent way materials, and ironwork required in the building of the main lines of railway in Ireland. An early undertaking was the raising and strengthening of the 133 ton roof of St George's Church in Dublin, for which he was in 1841 awarded a Walker premium by the Institution of Civil Engineers. In 1836 the firm of J. and R. Mallet erected a number of swivel bridges over the River Shannon. Contracts were also completed for Guinness &amp; Co., the brewers, including boring a deep artesian well, the construction of steam barrel-washing machinery, and large sky coolers. Mallet was elected an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1839, being transferred to member in 1842. He surveyed the River Dodder in 1841 and devised a scheme to provide a supply of pure water to parts of Dublin city, and to secure a reliable summer water supply to the paper mills along the river. (A similar scheme was eventually built in the 1880s.) Between 1845 and 1848 he supplied and erected the ironwork at many of the railway termini, as well as engine sheds, workshops, and a 200 ft span timber viaduct over the Nore in co. Kilkenny. His foundry supplied the castings for the first Fastnet Rock lighthouse (1848&#150;9); the structure was replaced in 1904. Mallet invented the buckled plate, which he patented in 1852 (No. 557). Such plates were used widely in structures, particularly for flooring, where they combined maximum strength with minimum depth and weight. In 1854, during the Crimean War, he designed and had built two large siege mortars capable of firing 36 inch shells to distances of over 1 mile, but no opportunity arose to use them before the conclusion of a peace treaty with Russia in 1856.<br>
<br>In 1860, with the completion of the trunk railway lines in Ireland, engineering work became scarce, and Mallet closed the foundry and moved to London, where he had begun to establish himself as a consulting engineer. He lodged with a Mrs Daniel, and in 1861 married her daughter Mary, his first wife having died in 1854. He edited the <span class="italic">Practical Mechanic's Journal</span>, 1865&#150;9, wrote extensively for <span class="italic">The Engineer</span>, and gave evidence as a scientific witness in patent cases. In 1863 he reported on the Hibernia and other Ruhr collieries in Germany, and in 1864 was involved in an abortive scheme to connect Dublin's main line railway termini. He investigated the use of the Thames Tunnel by the East London Railway, and the possibility of damage to the Royal Observatory at Greenwich.<br>
<br>Mallet's investigations in physical geology were directed towards four main areas: glacial flowage (1837&#150;45), geological dynamics (1835 onwards), seismology (1845 onwards), and vulcanology (1862 onwards). Between 1850 and 1858, he coined no less than eight terms with the prefix &#145;seism-&#146;, including seismology. His classic paper to the Royal Irish Academy in 1846 on earthquake dynamics is regarded as one of the foundations of modern seismology. He investigated the great Neapolitan earthquake of December 1857 and established the first principles of observational seismology. With his eldest son, John W. Mallet, he compiled a <span class="italic">Catalogue of the World's Earthquakes</span> (1852&#150;4) and a <span class="italic">Seismographic Map of the World</span> (1857), both published by the British Association.<br>
<br>Mallet published at least eighty-five papers, on such diverse topics as the corrosion of iron, alloys of copper with tin and zinc, atmospheric railways, the application of water power, fouling of iron ships, earthquakes, and volcanoes. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1854. He received a Telford medal and premium from the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1859, and the Cunningham medal from the Royal Irish Academy in 1862. In the same year, the University of Dublin bestowed on him an honorary master of engineering degree, followed two years later by an honorary LLD. He was awarded the Wollaston medal of the Geological Society in 1877.<br>
<br>Mallet died at Enmore, The Grove, Clapham Road, London, on 5 November 1881. He was buried at Norwood cemetery, London, on 6 November. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
