<span class="headword">Osbaldeston,  Richard</span>  (1691&#150;1764), <span class="occ">bishop of London</span>, was born on 6 January 1691, and baptized on 13 January at Hunmanby, Yorkshire, the second son of Sir Richard Osbaldeston (1665&#150;1728) of Havercroft, Yorkshire, and his second wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1697), daughter and coheir of John Fountaine, of Melton, Yorkshire. He was educated at Mr Lambert's school at Beverley before being admitted a pensioner at St John's College, Cambridge, on 2 June 1707. He graduated BA in 1711, as 16th on the tripos list, and proceeded MA in 1714 and DD in 1726. He was elected fellow of Peterhouse on the Park foundation on 26 July 1714, which he resigned on 22 March 1715. He was ordained deacon by Sir William Dawes, archbishop of York, in September 1714 and priest early the next year.<br>
<br>Osbaldeston was an ambitious and wealthy whig cleric in Yorkshire. In 1715 he was favoured by William Henry Bentinck, second earl of Portland, with the rich living of Hinderwell, which he resigned in 1747; the same year he was appointed vicar of Hunmanby, the large parish where the Osbaldestons held the manor, a living that he retained until 1762 and where he built a new rectory. While a chaplain to both George I and George II (appointed 23 February 1725, reappointed 1727) he was made rector of Folkton in 1727 (a sinecure worth nearly &pound;900 p.a. and held until 1762), and was dean of York from 19 September 1728. His main achievement at York was collecting the money for a new pavement in the minster and having Richard Boyle, third earl of Burlington, and William Kent lay it; he also officiated at the marriage of Laurence Sterne. He himself married, at Hutton Buscel, Yorkshire, on 30 July 1733, Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1694, <i>d</i>. 1748), daughter of Thomas and Elizabeth Farside of that parish. She was buried on 10 April 1748, having been known, apparently, for her piety. In the words of William Coates:<blockquote>
<div>Smooth as the gentle stream her passions flow'd,<br>
</div>
<div>Her Lord, her Love, her only Rapture GOD.<br>
</div> (Coates, 61)</blockquote>On 4 October 1747 Osbaldeston was consecrated bishop of Carlisle. He remained in this manageable diocese for fifteen years and ran it with a modest efficiency, thanks to the assistance of the Revd Dr John Waugh, chancellor of the diocese and dean of Worcester, and his chaplains John Brown and Gustavus Thompson. Though he acted as one of George III's first tutors, Osbaldeston spent most of his summers in Carlisle. The sharp exchange of letters with his successor, Bishop Charles Lyttleton, about the decrepit state of the main episcopal residence, Rose Castle, should not count too much against him; Osbaldeston had an interest in building and had spent &pound;1000 on the repair of the castle, selling timber from the park to reimburse himself. It seems likely that the castle was starting to fall into disrepair only in the last few years of Osbaldeston's episcopate as age and ambition for a translation made him opt to spend more time on his estate at Hutton Buscel, where two ordinations were conducted. Until then his pastoral concern is undeniable. In 1753 he conducted an episcopal visitation of the cathedral and made several recommendations for improvements. He attended the coronation of George III as bishop of Carlisle and held the <span class="roman">Bible</span>.<br>
<br>As a Pelhamite loyalist Osbaldeston set his hopes on a return to York as archbishop. He applied to the duke of Newcastle for the northern primacy twice, on neither occasion with success. On 13 March 1757 he stressed his &#145;many connexions&#146; in Yorkshire  (BL, Add. MS 32870, fol. 271); on 14 August 1761 the best he could say was that &#145;my family and I for many years past have never failed to do all in our power for the service of the present government&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 32927, fol. 30). He finally achieved promotion the following year, when on the death of Bishop Hayter he was translated to London as his replacement, &#145;to nobody's joy that I know of&#146;, as Richard Hurd waspishly remarked  (<span class="italic">Works of William Warburton</span>, ed. R. Hurd, 7 vols., 1788&#150;94, 1.84). He was in possession for only two years but managed to leave his mark on the diocese, principally by holding a visitation in 1763. Osbaldeston was a discerning patron. He recommended Hurd for preferment, made the historian John Jortin first his domestic chaplain and then archdeacon of London, and in 1762 nominated C&eacute;sar de Missy one of the French chaplains to the king. He took an immediate interest in the see of London's supervisory role over the British colonies in North America, where he attempted to uphold church and crown interests, for instance recommending to the Board of Trade in May 1762 that all vestrymen in North Carolina declare their conformity to the liturgy of the Church of England. Osbaldeston had already become involved in colonial Anglicanism before his elevation as bishop of London. Acting for Bishop Thomas Sherlock he had ordained Samuel Seabury as priest on 23 November 1753. As bishop, Osbaldeston lived in Frith Street while putting in hand plans for the rebuilding of Fulham Palace.<br>
<br>Osbaldeston died on 15 May 1764 and was buried in Hutton Buscel church on 29 May. His second wife, Lucy Digby (1723/4&#150;1793), daughter of John and Jane Digby of Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire, died on 11 April 1793, aged sixty-nine. He had no children with either wife and his estate at Hutton Buscel passed to his brother Fountayne Wentworth Osbaldeston (1696&#150;1770). He presented communion plate to most of the parishes where he had been incumbent. Osbaldeston's only publications were three sermons, his papers having been burnt on his instructions, and this has not helped his posthumous reputation. Archbishop Thomas Secker was reported to have considered him in &#145;every way unequal to the situation&#146; of running the London diocese  (Chandler, 197). One of his archdeacons, Charles Moss, was in no doubt, however, of Osbaldeston's merit: &#145;a general knowledge of the world, and of business, a gentlemanly address and deportment, a just sense of his own dignity and a becoming zeal for the interests of religion, are valuable qualities in a Christian Bishop&#146;  (Moss, 20).<br>
