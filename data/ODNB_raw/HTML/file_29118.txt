<span class="headword">Weston,  Edward</span>  (1565?&#150;1635), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was the son of William Weston of Lincoln's Inn and Ellen, daughter of the martyr <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26598/', "John Story (d. 1571)")</script>, and was born in London. He matriculated from Lincoln College, Oxford, on 20 March 1579, and was there placed under the private tuition of the Catholic John Case. After five years at Oxford he ended what Wood calls &#145;his conversations with the Muses&#146; without taking a degree and entered the English College, Rheims, in 1584. From there he proceeded to the English College, Rome, in the spring of 1585, and in 1586 signed a petition of fifty students on behalf of the Jesuit administration against a faction of malcontents. After being ordained priest at the Lateran on 26 March 1589 he was made doctor of theology at the University of Monreale, Turin.<br>
<br>Weston returned to Rheims on 7 June 1592 as lecturer on cases of conscience, but moved to Douai the following year to prepare for the return of the English College to that town. He continued to lecture there until 1602, when he was described by the spy John Fawther as &#145;a proper man of person and of all sort of knowledge and learning&#146;, adding, &#145;They make the comparison betwixt him and Campion to be equal&#146;. That year he published <span class="italic">De triplici hominis officio</span> &#145;against atheists, politiques and sectarians&#146;, with particular mention of John Reynolds of Oxford in his preface. He was then sent to labour on the English mission in the Durham district, where he spent some ten years.<br>
<br>On Weston's return to Douai, on 23 September 1612, he was caught up in the controversy on the oath of allegiance, supporting Cardinal Bellarmine against the Benedictine Thomas Preston (alias Roger Widdrington). In reply to the latter Weston drew upon his correspondence with the cardinal for his <span class="italic">Iuris pontificii sanctuarium</span> (1613). The following year he published a manual of controversies in two parts under the general title of <span class="italic">The Trial of Christian Truth</span>: the first part treated of faith, in 1614, and the second of hope, in 1615. But he failed to bring out his promised sequel on the further virtues of charity and religion. Instead, he was involved in the political troubles of his college, as he supported his colleague William Singleton in opposition to the president of Douai, Matthew Kellison, on the question of the oath of allegiance. For this he was summoned to the internuncio at Brussels on 6 August 1617 and to Rome on 28 August. Thus it was under a shadow that he departed from Douai and was appointed canon of the collegiate church of St Mary at Bruges.<br>
<br>Some years later Weston again appears on the side of the Jesuits in the controversy between the two Jesuits, John Fisher (or Percy) and John Sweet, and the two protestant ministers, Daniel Featley and Francis White. In 1624 he published a book, <span class="italic">The Repair of Honour</span>, in the form of a letter to the Jesuits, noting that their dispute had brought about the conversion of two earls to the Catholic church. Weston went on to publish two further books in Latin, <span class="italic">Theatrum vitae civilis ac sacrae</span> (in 5 vols.) in 1626 and <span class="italic">Iesu domini nostri coruscationum &hellip; enarrationes</span> in 1631. He died at Bruges in 1635.<br>
