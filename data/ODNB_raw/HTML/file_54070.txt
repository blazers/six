<span class="headword">Miller,  William John Clarke</span>  (1832&#150;1903), <span class="occ">mathematician and medical administrator</span>, was born on 31 August 1832 at Beer, south Devon, the son of Reuben Miller, a dissenting minister, and his wife, Ann. During his childhood he was educated at the village school, where he is said to have developed a love of books and of nature. His dissenting parents would not allow him to be educated at a conforming establishment, and at the age of fifteen, in August 1847, he entered the newly created West of England Dissenters' Proprietary School, Taunton. There mathematics and classics were held in equal esteem and Miller became proficient in both, though mathematics became his passion. Years later a fellow pupil remembered his characteristic posture as &#145;book in hand, probably Euclid's <span class="italic">Elements</span>&#146;  (Record, 39).<br>
<br>Miller became a mathematics master at the Taunton school about 1850. During his first year as a student there the school had formed a connection with the University of London which enabled it to award University of London degrees, and he graduated with mathematical honours in 1854. He then taught at several institutions before becoming vice-principal at the Congregational Huddersfield College in 1861. He was married; his wife, who outlived him, was called Harriette Emma.<br>
<br>During the early 1850s a group of students and masters from the Taunton school started sending questions and solutions to the mathematical department of the <span class="italic">Educational Times</span>, a monthly journal of education, science, and literature (founded 1847); Miller's first contribution appeared in September 1850. The journal had a strong educational focus, and the editors wanted to see model solutions given to problems that juniors would encounter during their studies. However, Miller, who had greatly wanted to study at Cambridge but been prevented from doing so by his parents' religious stance, valued the journal more for the access it might give him, and others like him, to higher-level mathematics. In 1857 he wrote to the editors to express his desire to see original research flourishing in their journal via the publication of genuine unanswered questions. The editors published his letter and expressed approval of his sentiments, but professed themselves unable to fulfil its aims. In 1862 Miller, by now a major contributor to the journal, himself became its mathematical editor and was able put into practice the policy that he had first called for five years earlier.<br>
<br>One of Miller's early decisions as new editor of the mathematical department (which comprised a substantial portion of the journal) was to issue, as a separate reprint, <span class="italic">Mathematical Questions with their Solutions from the &#145;Educational Times&#146;</span>. For the first volume (June 1864) he put together a formidable list of subscribers, including George Boole, Arthur Cayley, Augustus De Morgan, and James Joseph Sylvester. In subsequent volumes, which appeared regularly at biannual intervals, the range of contributors grew rapidly, including a substantial number of fellows from the Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin colleges, and many of the questions posed were of an original nature. By the tenth volume Miller's publication had developed a genuinely international reputation, and included contributions from several eminent continental mathematicians; later it also drew contributors from the United States.<br>
<br>Though he held the editorship concurrently with his vice-presidency of Huddersfield College, Miller was assiduous and painstaking in his approach to the editorial task, sending out solutions to be scrutinized before publication, and correcting some of them himself (notably including those of such distinguished mathematicians as Sylvester and W. K. Clifford). The problems that he himself put forward were highly regarded by leading contemporaries. His journal was innovative and sometimes at the frontier of research; thus, many problems on probability theory occurred in the earlier volumes. In 1875 a separate volume was issued, exclusively devoted to geometrical problems and edited by Thomas Archer Hirst. By 1889 Miller could count 500 contributors drawn from four continents.<br>
<br>Miller remained mathematical editor of the <span class="italic">Educational Times</span> for thirty-five years. This occupation was by nature of a hobby, for professionally he made his living first as a teacher, and later as a medical administrator. He was appointed general secretary and registrar of the General Medical Council in 1876, whereupon he left Huddersfield; he remained in post until ill health forced his resignation in 1897, the same year as he gave up his editorship. His administrative abilities were greatly appreciated by the medical community, and the General Medical Council gave him a gratuity of &pound;1000 on his retirement.<br>
<br>During his editorship Miller collected likenesses of several hundreds of his mathematical contributors, forming a unique visual record of nineteenth-century mathematical life. He sold his collection in the late 1890s to the American David Eugene Smith, with the hope that it would not be dispersed. (The collection is now in Columbia University, New York, to whom it was bequeathed by Smith.) An indefatigable correspondent, in conjunction with his editorial work Miller also acted as a mathematical intelligencer at large, regularly receiving and passing on much mathematical news. His focus on editorial work was not his preferred choice. At a number of points in his career he attempted, without success, to break into the higher echelons of the mathematical professoriate, notably in the 1860s when he sought to become professor of mathematics at Owens College, Manchester. In later life he expressed regret that he had not forsaken editing for a more auspicious career. His services to mathematics were none the less remarkable for that.<br>
<br>In 1896 Miller had been struck with aphasia, due to pressure of work, and he continued to suffer from this condition until his death. He died on 11 February 1903 at Castle Nursing Home, Kingswood, near Bristol, after a bout of influenza and bronchitis.<br>
