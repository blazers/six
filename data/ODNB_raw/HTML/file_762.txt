<span class="headword">Ashley,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1734&#150;1805), <span class="occ">conductor and bassoonist</span>, was probably born in London, although it is impossible to place or date this with certainty. Little is known of Ashley's musical training and his earlier professional years. He was a bassoon player of considerable ability and may have held an appointment in a wind band of the militia, for Charles Burney described him as &#145;of the Guards&#146;  (Burney, 12). He was a member of the Royal Society of Musicians (1765) and made free of the Worshipful Company of Musicians (1771; livery, 1792; elected warden, 1802; and master, October 1803 to October 1804).<br>
<br>Ashley rose to prominence as assistant conductor at the 1784 commemoration of Handel in Westminster Abbey and was involved in the festivals of 1785, 1786, and 1787. Together with Samuel Harrison he revived the Lenten oratorios at Covent Garden Theatre in 1789, offering programmes (on Wednesday and Friday evenings) modelled on the successful repertory of the Handel festivals. Ashley assumed sole direction in 1793, and retained this position until his death.<br>
<br>With a successful season likely to gross several thousand pounds, the oratorios provided a generous income, and Ashley took care to please his socially diverse audiences. Contemporary reviews praised the &#145;magnitude and merit of his arrangements&#146;; he, in turn, well read the temper of the times. While Handel, represented by complete oratorios as well as &#145;selections&#146;, remained the mainstay of his programmes, so satisfying established taste, Ashley also allowed for novelty. Concertos and chamber works met the growing demand for instrumental music and each season vocal and instrumental soloists new to London audiences appeared alongside such favourites as Gertrude Elizabeth Mara, Angelica Catalani, and Elizabeth Billington, and John Braham and James Bartleman. He played on the nationalistic fervour aroused by the French Revolution and the wars with France by including new songs with patriotic or bellicose sentiments and, season after season, invariably ended each programme with a stirring doxology comprising Arne's &#145;Rule Britannia&#146; and an elaborate arrangement of &#145;God Save the King&#146;. Hindsight, however, shows the major landmarks to have been the first performances in England of Haydn's <span class="italic">Creation</span> (28 March 1800) and Mozart's <span class="roman">Requiem</span> (27 February 1801), and by regularly bringing choral music to the general public in an age which otherwise lacked such opportunities Ashley's oratorio ventures ultimately may be seen as an early stimulus to the enthusiasm for choral activities that swept the country later in the century.<br>
<br>Between 1788 and 1793, and again in 1801, Ashley promoted &#145;grand musical festivals&#146; in provincial centres from Portsmouth to Newcastle upon Tyne during the summer months. These two- to four-day events featured London principals augmented by local rank-and-file singers and instrumentalists, and the programmes again imitated the Handel festivals.<br>
<br>Ashley married Mary Jane at St George, Hanover Square, on 14 February 1769. The family resided in London&#151;at 4 Pimlico Terrace, Chelsea, to about 1800, shifting to Abingdon Street, Westminster, where Ashley died on 14 March 1805 and his widow on 22 December 1809. Ashley's brother-in-law Richard Jane (<i>b</i>. 1740), who died on 5 April 1809, at Abingdon Street, has been misrepresented as Jane Ashley a brother, and erroneously described as a bassoon player.<br>
<br>John Ashley's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_759"></a><span class="headword">General Christopher Ashley</span>  (1769&#150;1818), was born in London on 9 November 1769. He studied the violin with Felice Giardini and F. H. Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mon and was apprentice to his father from 1784 to 1791. He was a member of the Royal Society of Musicians (1791) and the Worshipful Company of Musicians (1800; livery and steward, 1803). In 1790 he began a 25-year stint as leader at the Covent Garden oratorios. He was engaged at Ranelagh and the Concerts of Ancient Music, and led the orchestra at many of his father's far-flung festivals. In 1805 he succeeded his father as manager of the Covent Garden oratorios, assisted by his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/761/', "John James Ashley (1771&#150;1815)")</script>. He joined his younger brothers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/758/', "Charles Jane Ashley (1772&#150;1843)")</script> and <a href="#cosubject_762">Richard Godfrey Ashley [<i>see below</i>]</a> in their provincial enterprises between 1806 and 1815. General Christopher Ashley married Sarah Chandler on 22 March 1804. He resided in London at James Street, Westminster, and at 12 King's Row, Pimlico, where he died on 21 August 1818.<br>
<br>John Ashley's fourth son, <a name="cosubject_762"></a><span class="headword">Richard Godfrey Ashley</span>  (1774&#150;1836)<span class="occ"></span>, was born in London on 8 September 1774. He was best known as a viola player, although from his first appearance at the Covent Garden oratorios in 1793 he usually performed there on the &#145;double drums&#146;. He participated in his father's and brothers' undertakings until 1818 but appeared only irregularly in the oratorios after 1805. Throughout his life he was in demand at major festivals, leading the violas at the Three Choirs festival (1811), Oxford (1813), York (1823), and Chester (1829). He was a member of the Royal Society of Musicians (1796) and the Worshipful Company of Musicians (1800; livery 1802). He married Elizabeth Palmer at St George, Hanover Square, London, on 1 April 1816 and resided in London at Beaver Street, Pimlico, and at Park Place, Chelsea, where he died on 11 October 1836.<br>
