<span class="headword">Strong,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1654), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was probably a native of Dorset (and possibly the son of Timothy Strong), although Durham and Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire, have also been given as his birthplace by his modern biographers. He was educated, as of Dorset, at the University of Cambridge. Early in 1631 he graduated BA from St Catharine's College and on 28 February he was elected a fellow; he proceeded MA in 1634. It appears that even at this early age Strong had embraced the puritan stance in his religious beliefs as well as in his attitude towards church polity, for at a hearing in July 1634 he was alleged to have said that Archbishop William Laud had sinned against the Holy Ghost and, perhaps more subversively, that there would soon be no bishops in England. Consequently he was suspended that year from his fellowship at St Catharine's, deprived of his degrees, and banished from the university.<br>
<br>In 1640 Strong became the rector of Moor Crichel, near Wimborne, Dorset, but he fled to London in 1643 when the royalist forces obtained ascendancy in the county. In London Strong received a warm reception at the parish of St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street, and soon became a lecturer there. On 13 June 1644 the vestry ordered that the churchwarden &#145;shall lend Mr Strong &pound;30 to be deducted &pound;6 a quarter from his lecture&#146;  (London, Guildhall Library, MS 3016/1, fol. 241), and a year later, on 7 July 1645, the vestry again resolved that &#145;care might be taken by the vestrymen to provide soe for Mr Strong that they might not lose the benefit of his ministry&#146;  (ibid., fol. 263). He had a cordial relationship with the vicar, Andrew Perne, and upon Perne's resignation the House of Commons appointed Strong to be the minister of the parish, on 14 October 1647.<br>
<br>In the meantime Strong had rapidly become a prominent divine at Westminster as well as in the City. He was to preach frequently before the houses of parliament and the civic leaders of London; some of his sermons were separately published. In 1645 he was appointed one of the seven preachers at Westminster Abbey to have morning exercises in place of the traditional daily service. Later in the year, upon the death of Edward Peale of Dorset, Strong was chosen in his stead as a member of the Westminster assembly of divines. He appeared in the assembly on 13 January 1646 and took the protestation, and on 16 January he took the solemn league and covenant and subscribed. In August 1648 he was appointed a trier of ministers for the twelfth classis in the province of London under the new presbyterian church government. He was likewise a weekday lecturer at St Margaret's, Westminster, in 1649. It appears that as late as 1648, when he was appointed a trier and preached before the lord mayor and aldermen at St Paul's a sermon published as <span class="italic">The Vengeance of the Temple</span> (1648), there was no sign that Strong had become an Independent. However, in the middle of 1650, he drafted, according to Thomas Bakewell in his <span class="italic">A Plea for Mr Strong's Church-Members</span>, eight articles, all of which are clearly the fundamental tenets of Independency or congregationalism, and imposed them upon his parishioners to subscribe; and &#145;til they do it, he is resolved to debar them from the Lords Table, if not wholly forsake them&#146;  (Bakewell). Apparently Strong attempted to turn the parochial church into an Independent congregation. It was probably as a result of this conflict that he left St Dunstan-in-the-West and gathered his Independent church at Westminster Abbey; its members elected him their pastor on 9 December 1650. Subsequently, in the early 1650s, Strong became a leading Independent divine in church affairs. On 2 January 1651, at the desire of Oliver Cromwell, Sir Henry Vane conferred with him concerning his going to Scotland, undoubtedly as chaplain to the English army, and on 29 July 1652 he was one of the Independent ministers called to a meeting at Cromwell's house in the Cockpit about sending godly persons to preach the gospel in Ireland. Earlier in the latter year he had joined other Independent divines in presenting to the Rump Parliament their proposals for the propagation of the gospel, which were, in effect, an Independent design for religious settlement; on 20 March 1654, when the Independent church polity had been finally established, he was appointed one of the commissioners for the approbation of public preachers, commonly known as triers, under the Cromwellian protectorate.<br>
<br>In spite of the fact that Strong eventually embraced the Independent church polity, he was a moderate and perhaps even a conservative man in his religious thought. Unlike his radical Independent brethren such as John Goodwin, he unequivocally upheld the power and authority of the magistracy not only in civil affairs but also in matters of religion. It was the ordinance of God, Strong would argue, that &#145;there should be a Magistracie; they are called the <i>shields of the earth</i>&#146;; for as &#145;it is not good there should be an Anarchie&#146;, magistrates were necessary &#145;to restrain men of giddy spirits, who are like the <i>children of Belial</i> without a Yoke&#146;  (<span class="italic">XXXI Select Sermons</span>, 1656, 386). He complained that &#145;it is woful liberty, a liberty of sinning&#146; that some men now &#145;call all into question&#146; and &#145;cry down instituted worship&#146; as &#145;but forms&#146;  (ibid., 246, 250); and he maintained that &#145;a bounding of mens spirits by the word is not bounding of the spirit&#146;  (ibid., 629). It is true that like many of his puritan brethren Strong was profoundly affected by Christian eschatology and at times of political crisis spoke in apocalyptic language. He even attempted to determine the time of the coming of Christ's kingdom. However, he was not reluctant to denounce the radical claims of the Fifth Monarchy Men. If &#145;the Kingdoms of the earth shall become the kingdom of the Lord and his Christ&#146;, Strong asked, &#145;then what need have you to be disquieted because some of your inferiour injudicious mistaken ends be not brought about&#146;  (ibid., 679)? In early November 1653, when the Fifth Monarchy Men in and out of the Barebones Parliament attempted to destroy what they called the Antichristian national ministry, Strong told the London magistrates in his <span class="italic">A Voice from Heaven Calling the People to Perfect Separation</span> (1653) that &#145;I do never fear Antichrist more then when he professes to fight under Christ's banner&#146;, and he appealed to the citizens of London: &#145;<i>Let all those that fear God</i> unite <i>against this common adversary</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Voice from Heaven</span>, foreword and p. 26).<br>
<br>Strong died suddenly in late June 1654 and was buried in Westminster Abbey on 4 July. His funeral sermon was preached by the presbyterian divine Obadiah Sedgwick. He was survived by his wife, Damaris, to whom was granted administration of his estate on 22 August, and some children whose names are not known. A William Strong of Dorset, admitted pensioner at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 3 July 1652, was perhaps his son. After Strong's death his works were published from his notes transcribed by Elizabeth, Lady Carr (afterwards wife of Nathaniel Rich). It was said that Strong had left &#145;all his notes under a Character of his own devising&#146; and that it was impossible for any one to publish anything &#145;by his own notes&#146;, but his widow protested that Strong had used the characters of the stenographer John Willis, only adding &#145;here and there some of his own, sufficiently known to, and understood by that person of honour &hellip; to whom he committed his notes&#146;  (Strong). Following the Restoration his remains were disinterred in 1661 and thrown into a pit in the churchyard of St Margaret's, Westminster.<br>
