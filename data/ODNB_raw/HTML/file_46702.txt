<span class="headword">Eleanor</span> <span class="st"> [Eleanor of Brittany]</span>, <i>suo jure</i> duchess of Brittany  (1182<span class="mult">x</span>4&#150;1241), <span class="occ">princess</span>, was the elder daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10533/', "Geoffrey, duke of Brittany")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46701/', "Constance, duchess of Brittany")</script>, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/704/', "Arthur, duke of Brittany")</script>. At her father's death in August 1186 she was heir to the duchy, and Philip Augustus, king of France, claimed her wardship. However, Arthur's birth on 29 March 1187 and the procrastination of Henry II temporarily reduced her diplomatic value. As part of his ransom terms from Leopold, duke of Austria, in June 1193, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23498/', "Richard I")</script> arranged for Eleanor to marry the duke's son, but her journey to join him under the care of Baldwin de B&eacute;thune in 1194 was interrupted on news of Leopold's death. In 1195 plans for marrying her to Louis, the French royal heir, were discussed but again the match was unsuccessful. Duchess Constance then pressed for her release from royal custody and by the time of Richard's death on 6 April 1199 Eleanor was living in France with her mother and brother. But further misfortune befell her in August 1202 when she was captured at Mirebeau along with Arthur by her uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14841/', "King John")</script>.<br>
<br>Because of her claims on the Angevin and Breton successions and John's fear that she would transmit them by marriage, Eleanor was once again placed in protective custody from which she never emerged, despite efforts over several years by Philip Augustus and the Bretons to negotiate her release. In 1203 John had her moved to England and imprisoned in various strongholds, including the castles of Corfe (Dorset), Burgh (Westmorland), and Bowes (Yorkshire). One order for her maintenance provided for cloth, &#145;not however of the king's finest&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rotuli litterarum clausarum</span>, 2.168), but otherwise she was treated with consideration. She spent some time with the queen and the king of Scotland's daughters, hostages for a treaty. John also continued to use her as a diplomatic pawn: for example, in her sole surviving letter, clearly written with royal consent in 1208, she is styled &#145;duchess of Brittany and countess of Richmond&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rotuli litterarum patentium</span>, 91). In 1214, when John attempted to regain his continental lands, she accompanied him to Poitou, and there are occasional hints of continued support for her in Brittany. Eleanor returned to England and her latter years were spent in further comfortable confinement at various locations, including Marlborough, Gloucester, and Bristol, where she had apartments in the keep between 1224 and 1234, and again from 1238 or 1239 until her death. Her name occurs occasionally in royal accounts, and those of the constable of Bristol Castle from the 1220s furnish considerable detail on her household and lifestyle during her captivity, providing an early example of this form of documentary evidence. She was visited once or twice a week by the bailiffs and four leading citizens to ensure her welfare, while she also enjoyed the company of chaplains and serving ladies, and a typically varied, high-protein, aristocratic diet. This included many different types of freshwater and sea fish and abundant supplies of meat; the main beverages mentioned are ale and milk. Still unmarried at her death on 10 August 1241, Eleanor was first buried at St James's Priory, Bristol, but her body was later moved in accordance with her will and Henry III's instructions to Amesbury convent.<br>
