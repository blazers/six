<span class="headword">Freeman,  John Peere  Williams-</span>  (1858&#150;1943), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, was born on 13 April 1858 at Hamble Cliff, near Southampton, the youngest son of Frederick Peere Williams-Freeman (1815&#150;1870), landowner, of Greatham, Sussex, and his wife, Augusta Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1897), daughter of Captain Henry Edward Napier RN FRS. He was educated at Haileybury College and at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich (1876&#150;8). He obtained a commission in the Royal Artillery, but resigned it soon afterwards for family reasons and studied medicine, first in London at University College Hospital and then at Durham University, taking the degree of MB in 1885 and MD in 1888. From 1889 until 1928 he practised at Weyhill, Hampshire, and held also several clinical appointments. On 16 November 1897 Williams-Freeman married his cousin, Mabel Christiana, daughter of Charles George Napier; they had one son and five daughters, the son and one daughter dying in infancy. On retirement he went to live at Botley, Hampshire, but eventually returned to his former region, living at Thruxton, near Andover.<br>
<br>Although of no mean standing in the medical profession, it was as an archaeologist that Williams-Freeman earned his chief claim to recognition. From youth onwards his interests were widespread; he was a clear and original thinker and an accurate observer. In 1901 he met a near neighbour, Percy Farrer, who stimulated his growing interest in the prehistoric earthworks around Weyhill. Other contacts followed and in 1915 he published his book <span class="italic">Field Archaeology as Illustrated by Hampshire</span>, a model of its kind. It was the first book to attempt to set prehistoric man in his natural environment of vegetation, a method that in time became standard procedure.<br>
<br>Williams-Freeman did no excavation but was first and foremost a field archaeologist, having himself invented that term. In the course of his medical practice he was able to observe the countryside and its natural features. He particularly noted the reaction of the crops to silted-up prehistoric ditches and the like, and realized, before air photography, how informative air photographs would be to the prehistorian. He often discussed these matters with O. G. S. Crawford, and when eventually chance put before him a set of air photographs of his own region, he showed them to the latter, to whom it fell to develop an important new technique. Crawford's works <span class="italic">Air Survey and Archaeology</span> (1924) and <span class="italic">Air Photography for Archaeologists</span> (1929) followed.<br>
<br>Williams-Freeman was essentially an alert-minded countryman, bringing to bear upon archaeology a good brain well disciplined by professional training. Although one of the last and best of the amateur, that is, part-time, archaeologists of the nineteenth century, he belonged rather to the twentieth in his methods and outlook, which were those of modern professional archaeologists. He died at his home, Tarvers, Thruxton, on 20 December 1943.<br>
