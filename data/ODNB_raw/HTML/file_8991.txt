<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Evans, Sir  William David</span>  (1767&#150;1821), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born in London on 25 May 1767, the son of John Evans and his wife, Janet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Butterfield. Educated at Harrow School (1779&#150;80), on attaining his sixteenth year he was articled to a Warrington solicitor, in whose office he relieved the tedium of business hours by courting the muses. He was admitted an attorney in February 1789, and practised at Leigh, Lancashire. In 1790 he married Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1832), daughter of Peter Seaman of Warrington. After being admitted as a student of Gray's Inn, on 29 January 1789, he was called to the bar in February 1794. He joined the northern circuit, residing in Liverpool, and practised there several years as a special pleader and conveyancer. He published an enlarged edition of <span class="italic">Salkeld's Reports</span> (3 vols., 1795), <span class="italic">Essays on the Action for Money Lent and Received</span> (1802), <span class="italic">A General View of the Decisions of Lord Mansfield in Civil Causes</span> (2 vols., 1803), and <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Law of Obligations and Contracts, from the French of Pothier</span> (2 vols., 1806). He moved to Manchester in 1807, and established a lucrative practice. His <span class="italic">Letter to Sir S. Romilly on the Revision of the Bankrupt Laws</span> (1810) influenced subsequent legislation. He strongly favoured Roman Catholic emancipation, and in 1813 published <span class="italic">Letters on the Disabilities of the Roman Catholics and Dissenters</span>. In 1813 he was appointed the first Manchester stipendiary magistrate. In 1815 he was appointed vice-chancellor of the county palatine court of Lancaster, holding these offices concurrently until 1818. Meanwhile he published more legal works including <span class="italic">The Practice of the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster</span> (1814), <span class="italic">A Charge to the Grand Jury at Preston</span> (1817), <span class="italic">A Collection of Statutes Relating to the Clergy, with Notes</span> (1817), and <span class="italic">A Collection of the Statutes Connected with the General Administration of the Law &hellip; with Notes</span> (8 vols., 1817 and later editions). He collected material for other works, but did not live to finish them. Sir Charles Harcourt Chambers's <span class="italic">Treatise on the Law of Landlord and Tenant</span> (1823) was compiled from his notes, and he left a manuscript &#145;Life of the chancellor d'Aguesseau&#146; which Charles Butler used in his work on d'Aguesseau.<br>
<br>In 1817 Evans unsuccessfully applied for a vacant judgeship, but in 1819 he was appointed recorder of Bombay (at &pound;7000 a year) and was knighted. On the voyage out he wrote <span class="italic">A Treatise upon the Civil Law</span> and initiated a weekly literary publication to entertain his fellow passengers. He began his duties in India with great promise of success, but fell victim to a pre-existing condition, presumably aggravated by the climate, and died at Bombay on 5 December 1821.<br>
