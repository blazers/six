<span class="headword">Squire,  John</span>  (1780&#150;1812), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, eldest son of Dr John Squire (1732&#150;1816) of Ely Place, London, who founded in 1788 the Society for the Relief of Widows and Orphans of Medical Men, was born in London. Educated at Charterhouse School under Dr Matthew Raine, and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, he was commissioned second lieutenant, Royal Engineers, in January 1797, and promoted first lieutenant on 29 August 1798.<br>
<br>In August 1799 Squire embarked with the expedition under Sir Ralph Abercromby for The Helder. He was wounded in the action of 10 September, and also took part in those of Bergen and Alkmaar on 2 and 6 October. He returned with the army to England at the end of October.<br>
<br>In 1801 Squire went to Egypt, and served throughout the campaign under Abercromby and under General (afterwards Lord) Hutchinson. He was at the battle of Alexandria on 21 March, the capture of Rosetta on 8 April, the capture of Fort St Julien after a three-day siege on 19 April, and the siege of Alexandria in August, and its capitulation on 2 September. With Captain William Martin Leake, Royal Artillery, and William Richard Hamilton, he deciphered the Greek inscription on the so-called Pompey's pillar at Alexandria.<br>
<br>At the end of the Egyptian campaign Squire obtained leave and, with Leake and Hamilton, made a tour through Syria and Greece. After leaving Athens for Malta in the brig <i>Mentor</i>, laden with some of the Elgin marbles, Squire's party was wrecked on the island of Cerigo on 17 September 1802, and narrowly escaped death. By strenuous exertions many of the marbles and some of the party's journals, plans, and papers were recovered. Wherever Squire travelled he kept a full and accurate journal. On Squire's arrival home early in 1803 he and Leake presented to the Society of Antiquaries a memoir on Pompey's pillar, which was read on 3 February by Dr Raine of Charterhouse School, who had suggested characters to replace the eighteen which had been entirely obliterated.<br>
<br>Squire was promoted captain lieutenant in February 1803, and second captain on 19 July 1804. He was employed in the southern military district on the defences of the coast of Sussex. On 1 July 1806 he was promoted first captain, and appointed commanding royal engineer in the expedition to South America. He accompanied Sir Samuel Auchmuty to La Plata, landing in January 1807. Squire conducted the siege operations at Monte Video, which, on a practicable breach being made, was carried by storm on 3 February. He was also commanding royal engineer under Major-General John Whitelocke in the operations from 28 June to 5 July which culminated in the disastrous attack on Buenos Aires and the humiliating terms by which Monte Video was given up, and the expedition returned to England. Although Squire received the thanks of Whitelocke in his dispatch, he bore witness for the prosecution at the court martial held in London in March 1808.<br>
<br>In April 1808 Squire accompanied Sir John Moore's expedition to Sweden, and in the summer he went with Moore's army to Lisbon, taking part in all the operations of the campaign, which terminated on 16 January 1809 in the victory of Corunna. He embarked the same night with the army for England, and arrived in February. In April he was sent by Castlereagh in a frigate on a secret mission to the Baltic, to report on the defences and importance of the island of Bortholm as a defensive naval station.<br>
<br>On 28 July of the same year he sailed, as commanding royal engineer to Sir John Hope's division, with the army under the earl of Chatham to the Scheldt. On 30 July he reconnoitred, with Captain Peake RN, the channel and shores of the East Scheldt. He took an active part in the siege of Flushing, and was present at its capture on 14 August, before returning to England in December.<br>
<br>In 1810 Squire published anonymously <span class="italic">A short narrative of the late campaign of the British army, &amp;c., with preliminary remarks on the topography and channels of Zeeland</span>, a careful study of the geography and history of the campaign, with outspoken criticism of its conduct and able proposals for operations which might have been successful.<br>
<br>On 28 March 1810 Squire joined Wellington's army in Portugal. He was employed in the lines of Torres Vedras, and on their completion was, in October, appointed regulating officer of no. 3 district, from Alhandra to the valley of Calhandrix. On the retreat of Mass&eacute;na in March 1811 Squire accompanied Marshal Beresford's corps to the relief of Campo Mayor on 25 March. At the end of March his resourcefulness in constructing bridges across the Guadiana River and making a breach in the defences of Olivenza contributed to the latter's capture on 15 April. His services were equally great at the two sieges of Badajoz in 1811 (5&#150;12 May and 25 May &#150; 10 June) and on both occasions Wellington mentioned him in dispatches.<br>
<br>On 21 June 1811 Squire was attached to Lieutenant-General Sir Rowland Hill's corps in Estremadura. He took part in the battle of Arroyo Molino on 28 October, when the French general, Girard, suffered an overwhelming defeat. His assistance was acknowledged with thanks by Hill in his dispatch, and Squire was promoted on 5 December to brevet major for his services. In March 1812 Squire and Burgoyne, alternating twenty-four hours' duty in the trenches, were the two directors of the attack at the third siege of Badajoz under Sir Richard Fletcher. After the capture of Badajoz by assault, on 6 April, Wellington mentioned Squire in his dispatch, referring to the assistance he rendered to Major Wilson and the 48th regiment in establishing themselves in the ravelin of San Roque. Squire was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel on 27 April, and was awarded the gold medal for Badajoz.<br>
<br>Squire continued to be attached to Hill's corps, which then attempted to destroy the French bridge of boats at Almarez. But his exertions and fatigue at the siege of Badajoz had greatly exhausted him; and, having repaired the bridge of Merida, he was hastening to join Hill when he fell from his horse and was carried to Truxillo. There he died of &#145;fever and prostration&#146; on 19 May 1812. Seldom was the loss of an officer of his rank more deplored.<br>
