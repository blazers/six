<span class="headword">Benson,  Richard Meux</span>  (1824&#150;1915), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and theologian</span>, was born on 6 July 1824 at Bolton House, Russell Square, London, the second son of Thomas Starling Benson (1775&#150;1858) and his third wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1859), only child of Richard Meux. He was baptized at St George's, Bloomsbury. His father was the high sheriff of Surrey and rented a succession of country houses where he could occupy himself in hunting, shooting, and fishing. Shortly after Richard's birth the family moved from Camberwell to Sanderstead Court, near Croydon, soon moving to North Cray Place, Kent. In 1833 they moved to Sketty Park, near Swansea, and eventually settled in 1839 at the Manor House, Teddington, Middlesex. Mrs Benson's father owned a noted London brewery and claimed royal descent from Anne, sister of Edward IV. The strong evangelical faith in which she raised her sons had been nurtured in her upbringing among the influential evangelicals known as the Clapham Sect.<br>
<br>Mrs Benson allowed Henry Roxby, her eldest son, who was to become a general and colonel of the 17th lancers, to be educated at Harrow School, but Richard was educated at home by tutors. In 1841 he spent the summer in Germany with his half-sister Sarah Benson and the following year they spent the winter in Rome, where they quickly made friends among the intelligentsia. Benson's fluent Italian enabled him to converse easily with Pope Gregory XVI in a private audience and to develop his theological acumen in conversations with leading theologians.<br>
<br>Benson went up to Christ Church, Oxford, in October 1844. When he arrived the Oxford Movement&#151;which had already attracted him&#151;was in crisis. E. B. Pusey, regius professor of Hebrew, was still prohibited from preaching in the cathedral of which he was a canon and Newman's conversion to Roman Catholicism was impending. Benson was indifferent to outward success and came under Pusey's influence at this time of apparent d&eacute;b&acirc;cle. Benson remained a loyal disciple of Pusey throughout his life. In 1846 Pusey nominated him to a studentship, and he was admitted on 24 December along with his friend H. P. Liddon; he retained his studentship until death. He took his BA degree (second class in <i>literae humaniores</i> and mathematics) in 1847. In 1848 he won the Kennicott Hebrew scholarship and was ordained deacon by Bishop Samuel Wilberforce, becoming assistant curate of St Mark's, Surbiton. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1849 and graduated MA in the following year.<br>
<br>In 1850 Benson accepted the college living of St James, Cowley, a sparsely populated parish extending from the eastern side of Oxford to the small village of Cowley. The prayer and study that accompanied his pastoral work enabled him to pioneer a form of ministry through which he would exercise great influence as a spiritual guide for half a century. After immersing himself in Ignatian spirituality, Benson led the first retreat for Anglican clergy at Cuddesdon in July 1858. He was also preparing to pioneer an unprecedented form of missionary endeavour in India, a brotherhood that would bear witness to native people by living the ascetic life among them. As he was about to sail plans were announced to develop Cowley Common as a suburb of Oxford, and at the urging of Bishop Wilberforce he agreed to remain in order to serve the new population.<br>
<br>Within a few years Benson emerged as the key figure in a movement to found an Anglican religious order for men, to which John Keble had given impetus in a sermon of July 1863. Several orders for women had been founded in the previous two decades. In the spring of 1865 an American priest, C. C. Grafton (later bishop of Fond du Lac), who had been attempting to found a community with O. S. Prescott, came to Oxford to participate. Benson was successful in obtaining the approval of Bishop Wilberforce for &#145;a Congregation of Priests and Laymen, giving up the world, living by simple rule and devoting ourselves to prayer, study and mission work&#146;  (Woodgate, 64). Grafton and Benson were joined by S. W. O'Neill and they spent 1866 establishing the life of the community. The Society of St John the Evangelist came into being when the three priests made their life vows of poverty, celibacy, and obedience on 27 December and Benson was elected superior. In 1868 the community moved into the mission house at 16 Marston Street, Oxford. In 1870 the parish was divided and Benson became the vicar of the new parish of Cowley St John.<br>
<br>Benson did not imitate a traditional model of the religious life, but crafted a synthesis. The ordered life of liturgical prayer and community was derived from the Benedictine heritage, and the emphasis on solitary prayer in the cell and asceticism from the contemplative orders. But the mobility and availability for evangelistic and pastoral work reflected the charisms of the Society of Jesus and the modern apostolic congregations.<br>
<br>In the next two decades Benson exhibited the full range of his extraordinary versatility. Fully active as the pastor of a rapidly expanding parish, he was at the same time establishing the society on the foundation of a monastic theology and spirituality, the power and originality of which is evident in <span class="italic">The Followers of the Lamb</span> (1900) and the addresses and commentary on the rule of life in <span class="italic">Instructions on the Religious Life</span> (1927, 1935, 1951) and <span class="italic">The Religious Vocation</span> (1939). His influence spread not only through his preaching, retreats, and immense correspondence but also through parochial missions. This was a form of ministry that he had pioneered from 1862, adapting methods developed by the Lazarist Fathers in France in the eighteenth century, and those of Robert Aiken and Richard Twigg, Anglican priests who used revivalist techniques to encourage &#145;Catholic&#146; churchmanship. In his writing he especially devoted himself to spiritual commentary on scripture and the liturgical year, notably <span class="italic">Bible Teachings</span> (1875), <span class="italic">Spiritual Readings</span> (1879&#150;82), and <span class="italic">The Final Passover</span> (1884, 1893&#150;5).<br>
<br>Benson was a small, wiry man of formidable stamina, with an ascetic's indifference to comfort or appearance. Although his personal reserve and prophetic intensity could be intimidating, he was known for a rich and sardonic sense of humour and the remarkable tenderness he could show. His letters reveal a wide and cultivated mind with a lively interest in current affairs, literature, poetry, music, and history. In his preaching he habitually soared to heights where few could follow, but in the more intimate setting of retreat the immediacy of his inspiration and his spiritual passion made an indelible impression on his hearers. His monastic experience and his absorption of patristic theology and the writings of the mystics gave rise to an uncompromising insistence on orthodoxy as a living reality that could only be appropriated through prayer and worship. Benson's loyalty to the Church of England was undeviating, but his critique of the entire system of Christendom that had been inaugurated under Constantine was very radical. He believed that a renewed apostolic Christian community could emerge only from the disintegration of Christendom, and criticized political schemes for disestablishment as partial and unrealistic. Much of his motivation for foreign mission stemmed from his hope that the younger churches could forge more authentic expressions of Christianity.<br>
<br>Benson was resistant to some of the later developments of the Oxford Movement. His unwavering focus on spiritual conversion excluded sympathy with Christian socialism. Developments in biblical criticism did not impress him; he mordantly referred to <span class="italic">Lux mundi</span>, the volume of essays edited by Charles Gore in 1889, as <span class="italic">Lux mundana</span>, worldly light.<br>
<br>In 1870 Benson went to the USA to establish a branch of the society in Boston; work in India began in 1874 and in South Africa in 1883. By 1884 the society had attained maturity, and its rule and statutes were formally approved by Bishop Mackarness of Oxford, who accepted the position of visitor. Two years later Benson relinquished his responsibilities as vicar.<br>
<br>The era of his leadership drew to a close in 1890 when Benson resigned as superior. Administration of the society had become complex and he had reservations about the institutional development of religious life. He left for a long mission tour in India and then Canada, finally settling in Boston in 1892, where he was to stay until recalled to Cowley in 1899. His later years bore fruit in <span class="italic">The War Songs of the Prince of Peace</span> (1901), a spiritual commentary on the psalter. He continued to be active in preaching and retreat conducting for several years until the onset of blindness and crippling rheumatism curtailed his ministry. He died at the mission house in Oxford on 14 January 1915, and was buried two days later in the cemetery adjoining the parish church of St Mary and St John.<br>
