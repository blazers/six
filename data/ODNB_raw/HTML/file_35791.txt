<span class="headword">Robinson,  Frederick William</span>  (1830&#150;1901), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born in Spitalfields, London, on 23 December 1830, the second son of William Robinson (1796/7&#150;1873), a baker, latterly of Elmore House, St James's Road, Brixton, who owned much house property in London, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> St John (1789/90&#150;1852). After an education at Dr Pinches's school at Clarendon House, Kennington, Surrey, where Henry Irving, Conrad Hume, Edward Clarke, and J. L. Toole were also pupils, he acted for some time as his father's secretary. He married, on 12 July 1853, Rosalie Jane (1835&#150;1913), daughter of John May Stephens, with whom he had twelve children.<br>
<br>Robinson's first novel, <span class="italic">The House of Elmore</span>, begun before he was eighteen, was published in 1855. It met with success and was followed by more than fifty others, most of which were popular and reprinted at least once. <span class="italic">Grandmother's Money</span> (1860) secured him fame, which was maintained in an anonymous series of semi-religious novels, among them <span class="italic">High Church</span> (1860), <span class="italic">Church and Chapel</span> (1863), <span class="italic">Carry's Confession</span> (1865), and <span class="italic">Beyond the Church</span> (1866). He was equally successful with three works of a different character: <span class="italic">Female Life in Prison, by a Prison Matron</span> (1862), <span class="italic">Memoirs of Jane Cameron, Female Convict</span> (1863), and <span class="italic">Prison Characters Drawn from Life</span> (1866). These were based upon actual records and were so realistic in treatment that they were considered actual documentaries of social history. Donations for prisoners were forwarded to him, and his revelations led to improvement in the conditions of prison life. (These works have on occasion been wrongly assigned to Mary Carpenter, the philanthropist.)<br>
<br>Robinson, who adopted William as a middle name, was also a pioneer in novels of low life, which included <span class="italic">Owen, a Waif</span> (1862), <span class="italic">Mattie, a Stray</span> (1864), and <span class="italic">Milly's Hero</span> (1865). Among his later works of fiction the best were <span class="italic">Anne Judge, Spinster</span> (1867), <span class="italic">No Man's Friend</span> (1867), and <span class="italic">The Courting of Mary Smith</span> (1886). <span class="italic">Poor Humanity</span> (1868) was dramatized by the author and played with some success at the Surrey Theatre in London with William Creswick in the chief role of a returned convict. Robinson's last complete novel, <span class="italic">The Wrong that was Done</span>, appeared in 1892, and a volume of short stories, <span class="italic">All they Went through</span>, was published in 1898. He also contributed to the <span class="italic">Family Herald</span>, <span class="italic">Cassell's Magazine</span>, and other periodicals, and for some years wrote dramatic criticisms for the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, and other papers. His novels appeared in the three-volume format, and when that genre fell out of favour his popularity waned. A disciple of Defoe and Dickens, he wrote too rapidly for the fullness of his powers to be best expressed.<br>
<br>In 1884 Robinson brought out a weekly penny magazine, <span class="italic">Home Chimes</span>, which was heralded by a sonnet from Theodore Watts-Dunton, contained contributions by Algernon Charles Swinburne, Moy Thomas, and Phil Robinson, and introduced several young authors such as J. M. Barrie, Jerome K. Jerome, and Israel Zangwill. In February 1886 the paper was converted into a fourpenny monthly and was carried on in that form until the end of 1893. Robinson's friends of an older generation included, besides Swinburne and Watts-Dunton, Ford Madox Brown, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Philip Bourke Marston and his father, and Sir Henry Irving. Chess-playing was among his accomplishments.<br>
<br>Robinson died at Elmore House, St James's Road, Brixton, London, on 6 December 1901 and was buried in Norwood cemetery in London. His wife and six sons and five daughters survived him.<br>
