<span class="headword">Prevost, Sir  George</span>, first baronet  (1767&#150;1816), <span class="occ">soldier and governor-in-chief of British North America</span>, was born on 19 May 1767 in New Jersey, America, the eldest son of the five children born to Augustin Pr&eacute;vost, a French-speaking Swiss protestant who served in the British army in Canada, and his wife, Nanette (Ann), the daughter of Chevalier George Grand, a wealthy Amsterdam banker. He was educated in England and in continental Europe before in 1779 he entered the army. He became a captain on 9 June 1783, took a company in the 25th foot on 15 October 1784, and was promoted major in the 60th (Royal American) foot on 18 November 1790. On 19 May 1789 he married Catherine Anne, the daughter of Major-General John Phipps, RE; they had four children who survived infancy, including a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22738/', "George Prevost (1804&#150;1893)")</script>. Shortly afterwards Prevost was sent to the West Indies with his regiment. He became lieutenant-colonel on 6 August 1794. In that and the following year he commanded the troops in St Vincent and saw much active service, in 1796 being twice wounded. On 1 January 1798 he became a colonel, and on 8 March brigadier-general.<br>
<br>In May 1798 Prevost was nominated lieutenant-governor of St Lucia. He spoke fluent French and set himself to conciliate the French population and to reform the disorganized law courts. Following a petition by the local people he was appointed civil governor on 16 May 1801. In the following year poor health compelled his return to England. On 27 September 1802 Prevost was appointed captain-general and governor-in-chief in Dominica. In 1803 he helped retake St Lucia from the French, and in February 1805 prevented their taking Dominica. On 10 May 1805 he again obtained leave to visit England, was placed in command of the Portsmouth district, and on 6 December 1805 was created a baronet. He was now major-general and on 8 September 1806 became colonel commandant in his regiment. In 1808&#150;9 he was second in command when Martinique was captured. In January 1808 he was promoted lieutenant-general.<br>
<br>As relations with the United States deteriorated, the imperial government replaced civilian with military governors in British North America. One such appointment was Prevost's, in 1808, as lieutenant-governor and commander-in-chief of Nova Scotia, where he increased his reputation as a colonial administrator. He helped undermine the American trade embargo by naming customs-free ports in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, action widely applauded in Anglophile and soon to be neutral New England. In the political arena Prevost's governorship uncannily foreshadowed his later regime in Lower Canada&#151;except for his championing the claims of the Anglican church in Nova Scotia. By avoiding arbitrary positions, he dissociated himself from his predecessor, Sir John Wentworth, whose strident defence of the royal prerogative had antagonized the house of assembly, and he won over the house leader, William Cottnam Tonge, by appointing him assistant commissary for the Martinique expedition. Conciliation produced a useful militia act, generous supply for defence purposes, and, for the most part, placid politics. As in Lower Canada, the assembly voted him money for a testimonial gift.<br>
<br>On 14 February 1811 Prevost was, at a critical juncture, chosen to be governor of Lower Canada, and governor-in-chief of and military commander in British North America, in succession to Sir James Henry Craig.<br>
<br>Craig had imprisoned, without bail or trial, the leaders of the assembly's majority grouping, the <i>parti canadien</i>, and had removed their militia commissions. He had treated the Roman Catholic bishop with suspicion and threats. With war against the United States imminent, Prevost wisely adopted the opposite approach of thoroughgoing conciliation. The commissions were restored and <i>parti canadien</i> men favoured by patronage, their leader, Pierre-Stanislas B&eacute;dard, even being appointed to the bench in 1812. The bishop was promised legal recognition by London (achieved 1817) and had his government stipend raised. The governor distanced himself from the ruling English party, rarely socializing or consulting with its leaders, even when they were executive councillors. Conciliation paid handsome dividends. Senior Roman Catholic clergy were indefatigable in inculcating loyalty among the French-speaking population. Over several legislative sessions Prevost secured legislation strengthening the militia by sanctioning various levels of conscription for active service, granting lavish funds for defence purposes, and authorizing the circulation of up to &pound;1,500,000 in army bills, a form of paper money. The Canadian militia played an important role in repelling the two American invasions of Lower Canada in the battles of Lacolle (November 1812) and Ch&acirc;teauguay (October 1813).<br>
<br>On 18 June the United States declared war; on the 24th the news reached Quebec. Prevost acted promptly, yet showed every consideration to American subjects then within his jurisdiction. When the news of the repeal of the orders in council was received he concluded an armistice with the American general; but it was disavowed by the United States, and the war went on. Through Prevost's influence Canada made it primarily a defensive war. Although he was nominally commander-in-chief, he mostly left the conduct of the war to others, and his own appearance in the field on two occasions was followed by the humiliation of the British arms. With Sir James Yeo he went to Kingston, and on 27 May 1813 concerted the attack on Sacketts harbour. A brilliant attack was made by the British troops&#151;the Americans were already routed&#151;when Prevost, seized with doubt, sounded the retreat. The scheme of invading New York state, in September 1814, was likewise due to Prevost. The Canadian forces had been reinforced by Peninsular War veterans; the army and fleet were together to attack Plattsburg. The attempt ought to have been successful, both by land and sea. But by some error the <i>Confiance</i> was sent into action alone, and Prevost, instead of giving her immediate support, suddenly decided to retreat.<br>
<br>Prevost continued his conciliatory policy throughout the war. Despite opposition from the appointed legislative council, he forwarded home articles of impeachment against chief justices James Monk and Jonathan Sewell passed by the assembly early in 1814. When he refused to suspend them, the lower house did complain that its privileges had been violated, but soon made amends by reiterating its belief in the overall &#145;wisdom of his excellency's administration&#146;  (cited in Christie, 2.165).<br>
<br>Prevost's neutrality was the last straw for English party leaders. In the spring of 1814 they attempted to persuade the prince regent to order his recall. Letters attacking the governor's appeasement of &#145;factious&#146; elements as preparing the way for another Ireland and portraying his military strategy as that of a cowardly fool appeared in the <span class="italic">Montreal Herald</span> (1814&#150;15), two sets of which, by &#145;Nerva&#146; (Samuel Gale) and &#145;Veritas&#146; (unknown), were subsequently published as pamphlets. Much of the military information was supplied by shocked and disgusted Peninsular War veterans.<br>
<br>On 21 January 1815 Provost met the new parliament of Lower Canada, and soon announced that peace had been concluded. The assembly proposed presenting him with a service of plate to the value of &pound;5000, &#145;in testimony of the country's sense of his distinguished talents, wisdom, and ability&#146;. The legislative council, however, declined to assent to the bill. In closing the session Prevost announced that he was summoned to England to meet the charges arising out of his conduct before Plattsburg. On 3 April he left amid numerous addresses from the Canadians. The English remained aloof, indeed sullen.<br>
<br>Prevost reached England in September, and, on learning that he had been incidentally condemned by the naval court for his actions at Plattsburgh, he obtained from the duke of York permission to be tried in person by court-martial. But the consequent anxiety ruined his health, and he died of dropsy in London on 5 January 1816, a month before the day fixed for the meeting of the court. He was buried at East Barnet, Hertfordshire. At the urging of Lady Prevost the prince regent publicly expressed his regard for Prevost's services, and granted the family additional armorial bearings, although nothing could be done legally to clear Prevost's name.<br>
<br>Prevost seems to have been cautious to a fault, wanting in decision, always anticipating the worst; but he was straightforward, well-intentioned, and honest. There seems to be little room for questioning his success in civil affairs, and he was an efficient soldier while he filled subordinate rank.<br>
