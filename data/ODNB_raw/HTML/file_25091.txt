<span class="headword">Senlis,  Simon (I)  de</span> <span class="st"> [Simon  de St Liz]</span>, earl of Northampton and earl of Huntingdon  (<em>d.</em> 1111<span class="mult">x</span>13), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the third son of Landri de Senlis, lord of Chantilly and Ermenonville, and a lady Ermengarde. The derivation St Liz (<i>de sancto Licio</i>) appears to be an attempted etymology for Senlis (<i>Silva necta</i>). His elder brother Guy de Senlis (<i>d</i>. 1124), a generous benefactor to Notre Dame de Senlis and St Martin des Champs, inherited the patrimony, his sons becoming prominent supporters of the Capetian kings, with three in succession holding the title of grand butler of France. Another brother, Hubert, became a canon of Notre Dame, Paris. Both the foundation charter of Sawtry Abbey, founded by his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25092/', "Simon (II) de Senlis (d. 1153)")</script>, and the late register of St Andrew's Priory, Northampton, believed Simon (I) to have come to England in 1066 and to have been patronized by William I; but his absence from <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> (1086) suggests that his arrival, or at least his endowment, took place under William Rufus.<br>
<br>Little is known about the career of Simon de Senlis, and it is unknown whether he aided Rufus during the serious baronial insurrections of 1088 in favour of his brother Robert Curthose. Nevertheless, he was distinguished enough to receive in marriage <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49353/', "Maud (or Matilda) (d. 1131)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7208/', "David I")</script>], daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28646/', "Earl Waltheof")</script> and Countess Judith, niece of William the Conqueror, and was granted, probably in right of his wife, the earldoms of Northampton and Huntingdon, in or before 1090. The semi-legendary tract about the Countess Judith, <span class="italic">De comitissa</span>, written in the later years of Henry II's reign and incorporated into the account of the life and martyrdom of Waltheof compiled at Crowland <i>c</i>.1219, records an implausible tradition that the king had initially wished to give the widowed Judith and her lands to Simon, son of Ranulf the Rich, who had come with his elder brother Garnier (in fact Simon (I)'s uncle) and forty knights. Refusing Simon on account of his lameness, however, Judith and her daughters fled from the king's anger into the Ely marshes.<br>
<br>According to the <span class="italic">De comitissa</span>, Simon de Senlis made a successful pilgrimage to Jerusalem. This was almost certainly after the first crusade, for Suger notes that Simon was captured during William Rufus's Vexin campaign of 1098 against the Capetian heir-apparent, Louis, and subsequently ransomed. Earl Simon witnessed Henry I's charter of liberties issued at his coronation on 5 August 1100 and may have accompanied Henry on his campaign against Robert de Bell&ecirc;me's castle at Tickhill in 1102. He attests royal charters in England from 1100 to 1103, in 1106 and 1107, and in 1109 and 1110.<br>
<br>At Northampton Earl Simon probably constructed the first castle and walled the considerable settlement that had expanded beyond the earlier defences. Although the earliest surviving fabric of the round church of the Holy Sepulchre in Northampton dates to the second quarter of the twelfth century, it is possible that its foundation was inspired by Simon's pilgrimage. Here he also founded the church of All Saints and the Cluniac priory of St Andrew (between 1093 and 1100) as a dependency of La Charit&eacute;-sur-Loire. When Hugh of Leicester, steward of Countess Maud, established monks of La Charit&eacute; at Preston Capes (<i>c</i>.1090) in emulation of his lord, Earl Simon granted them the endowments of the secular college at Daventry to which they subsequently moved (between 1107 and 1108). The earl also made grants to Lincoln Cathedral.<br>
<br>Simon de Senlis embarked on a second journey east, but died at La Charit&eacute;, &#145;the eldest daughter of Cluny&#146;, and was buried there in the great new priory church. It is possible that his body was subsequently moved to the priory of St Neots, which he had patronized. The date of his death is uncertain. He attests a grant of Henry I to Bath Abbey on 8 August 1111 at Bishop's Waltham, as the king was crossing to Normandy, and this may mark the earl's own outward voyage. By midsummer 1113, however, David of Scotland was recognized as earl of Huntingdon, marrying Simon's widow, Maud, although the earldom of Northampton reverted to the crown.<br>
<br>Simon de Senlis had three known children: Simon (II), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28647/', "Waldef")</script>, who became abbot of Melrose (1148&#150;59), and Matilda, who married Robert fitz Richard of Tonbridge. Countess Maud's younger sister Judith (or Alice) married Ralph de Tosny in 1103.<br>
