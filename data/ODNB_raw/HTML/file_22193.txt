<span class="headword">Phips <span class="st"> [Phipps]</span>, Sir  William</span>  (1651&#150;1695), <span class="occ">adventurer, army officer, and colonial governor</span>, was born on 2 February 1651 at Phips plantation, Jeremisquam Neck, Nequasett, Maine. He was the son of James Phips (<i>c</i>.1609&#150;1651&times;5) of Mangotsfield, Gloucestershire, and Mary, whose origins are unknown. James Phips was a migrant to the northern Massachusetts frontier, a farmer, fur trader, and gunsmith. William was one of the youngest of seven known children of these parents. Eight known younger half-siblings were born after his father died, and his mother married her husband's former partner John White some time between 1651 and 1655. Phips's early life was marked by &#145;limited material comfort and considerable insecurity&#146;  (Baker and Reid, 11). In later years his lack of education and social training prevented his full acceptance into the &eacute;lite circles of colonial Boston. Tall and corpulent, he had a domineering personality and was prone to angry outbursts, and to occasional violence when his authority was challenged or thwarted.<br>
<br>Phips apprenticed himself to a ship's carpenter when he was eighteen. He did not learn to read or write until he moved to Boston in 1673 to work as a shipwright. Nevertheless, the Phips family had transatlantic kinship and mercantile ties that facilitated his career. In Boston he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1706), widow of a Boston merchant, John Hull, and daughter of Captain Roger Spencer. They had one adopted child, Spencer (Bennett) Phips, Mary's nephew, who was lieutenant-governor of Massachusetts in 1732&#150;57.<br>
<br>Kinship ties enabled Phips to gain financial support for an expedition to the Bahama Banks in 1684 in search of sunken Spanish treasure. He suppressed two mutinies when the expedition failed and the crew wanted to turn to piracy. The duke of Albemarle enabled him to outfit another expedition in 1687 to search for the sunken <i>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Concepci&oacute;n</i>, which had recently been sighted. This voyage was an astounding success, and Phips's crew harvested treasure worth some &pound;250,000, of which his own share totalled &pound;11,000. In honour of this achievement he was knighted by James II on 28 June 1687. Phips spent the winter of 1687&#150;8 on another expedition to the <i>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora</i> under the command of Sir John Narbrough, who died at sea that spring. He returned to Boston in June 1688 and was sworn into office as provost marshal-general in charge of military affairs for the dominion of New England in July. Following a confrontation with the governing council he travelled to London. Since the recent deaths of Narbrough and Albemarle had left him without patrons, he allied himself with Increase Mather, who was in London petitioning for the restoration of the Massachusetts charter.<br>
<br>Following the secession of William III and Mary II to the English throne in February 1689, Phips returned to Boston, arriving in May, one month after Bostonians had overthrown and imprisoned the dominion governor Edmund Andros. Phips was baptized and became a communicant of Mather's North Church in Boston on 23 March 1690. He was soon made a freeman and major-general in a campaign against the French colony at Port Royal (Acadia). He won an easy victory over the French, who immediately surrendered. But having promised his protection to the French general, he dishonourably imprisoned the garrison and allowed his troops to ravage and plunder the settlement. In August 1690 he led an attack on Quebec with thirty-four vessels and 2300 New England troops. Lacking adequate supplies and plagued by severe weather and an outbreak of smallpox, the planned conquest was a dismal failure. In March 1691 Phips returned to London, where Increase Mather was still lobbying for the restoration of the original Massachusetts charter. Negotiations resulted in a new charter for Massachusetts and the nomination of Sir William Phips as royal governor.<br>
<br>In May 1692 Governor Phips arrived in Boston to find the gaols filled and the courts paralysed by increasing numbers of accusations of witchcraft. He created a special court of oyer and terminer, which accepted testimonies of spectral evidence to convict twenty-six people, of whom nineteen were executed. As criticism of the witchcraft trials mounted, Phips commissioned twelve clergymen, including the Mathers, to examine the validity of testimonies detailing spectral visitations in the shape of accused persons. The committee reported on 15 June 1692 that such evidence was unreliable and inadmissible for conviction. When the witch-hunt threatened to disable his government, and when his wife was accused of witchcraft, Phips placed a moratorium on the trials on 12 October 1692. He dissolved the court of oyer and terminer, and on 25 November the newly constituted superior court of the judicature opened trials on the remaining witchcraft cases. Some months later he issued a general pardon to all persons convicted of witchcraft, released the accused, and banned all publications concerning witchcraft. Despite the ban, Cotton Mather published his disingenuous <span class="italic">Wonders of the Invisible World</span> (1693), which upheld the judgments of the magistrates during the witch trials. Appearing with the governor's imprimatur, the book irrevocably damaged Mather's reputation and contributed to Phips's political isolation.<br>
<br>During the witch trials Phips was preoccupied with plans for another assault on Quebec. Political battles at home, however, and controversies with the neighbouring governors of New Hampshire, New York, and Rhode Island, prevented the realization of his military and entrepreneurial plans for the northern frontier. Summoned to appear before the privy council, he sailed for London on 17 November 1694. The charges against him focused on his violation of the <span class="roman">Navigation Acts</span>, his use of office for personal gain, and two assaults, one for allegedly caning the customs collector at Boston. Phips never defended his case before the privy council. He became ill and died in London on 18 February 1695. He was buried on 21 February at St Mary Woolnoth, Lombard Street. His wife survived him and in 1701 married Peter Sargeant. She died on 20 January 1706.<br>
