<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fraser,  Francis Charles</span>  (1903&#150;1978), <span class="occ">zoologist and museum administrator</span>, was born on 16 June 1903 at Glenturret, Station Road, Dingwall, Ross-shire, Scotland. He was the youngest of the six sons (there were also four daughters) of James Fraser (<i>d</i>. 1910/11), master saddler and blacksmith, and his wife, Barbara Anne Macdonald. He was educated at Dingwall Academy and Glasgow University (1921&#150;1924), from where he graduated with a BSc (honours) in zoology. His first job was demonstrator in the department of geology at Glasgow University from 1924 to 1925.<br>
<br>Fraser's academic potential, coupled with a good nature and ready humour, secured him, in 1925, a position as zoologist with the Colonial Office's <i>Discovery</i> investigations committee to quantify, using scientific methodology, the whale stocks around the Falkland Islands. On finding out Fraser's first name Stanley Kemp, the director of research, told him: &#145;we've got one of those already; you'll be Jimmy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs FRS</span>, 289). Between 1925 and 1933 Jimmy Fraser travelled to the Antarctic three times and, in 1942, he was awarded the polar medal. Much of his research concentrated on the biology of the species on which baleen whales fed; his first major publication was &#145;On the development and distribution of the young stages of krill (<i>Euphausia superba</i>)&#146; in <span class="italic">Discovery Reports</span>, volume 14 (1936).<br>
<br>In 1933 Fraser was appointed assistant keeper in the department of zoology at the British Museum (Natural History). He was put in charge of the osteological room, the mammalian skeletal material and marine mammal collections. Thereafter his research was mainly devoted to cetology (study of whales). He was actively involved in choosing public exhibits for the New Whale Hall and, in particular, installing the 93 ft long life-size model of the blue whale in 1938.<br>
<br>In 1936 Fraser was awarded the DSc from Glasgow University. On 30 June 1938 he married Anne Nuttall (<i>b</i>. 1906); they had no children. During the Second World War he was seconded to the Admiralty. Shortly after rejoining the museum he participated in the Danish Atlantide expedition to west African waters from 1945 to 1946. It was from this time that Fraser became involved with identifying the animal remains from archaeological excavations in Britain leading to the museum's becoming a major repository. But it was Fraser's efficient re-organization of the skeletal collections as well as his scholarly publications that brought him to the attention of the museum's managers, and he was promoted to deputy keeper of zoology in 1948 and keeper of zoology in 1957. He was an effective administrator, yet sensitive to the needs of the staff at a time when the museum was undergoing expansion, and in 1962 he was made CBE.<br>
<br>Fraser relinquished the keepership in 1964 to concentrate on whale research. He took immense pleasure in talking about cetaceans not only to colleagues but whenever answering enquiries from the public. He discovered a mechanism for determining the age of cetaceans by counting the number of concentric rings in the wax plugs in their ears. With his assistant, Peter Ernest Purves, he elucidated the hearing mechanism of marine mammals using pioneering techniques. The result was a series of papers, co-authored with Purves, and culminating in a major review, &#145;Hearing in cetaceans&#146; in <span class="italic">Bulletin of the British Museum (Natural History)</span>, zoology series, volume 7 (1960). Fraser was elected FRS in 1966 for this work, but his relationship with Purves had become strained. He retired from the museum in 1969 but continued his research until shortly before his death from stomach cancer at Beckenham Hospital in Kent on 21 October 1978. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>In the course of his career Fraser published nearly eighty scientific papers. In particular he produced for the museum four <span class="italic">Reports on Cetacea Stranded on the British Coasts</span> for the years 1927&#150;66 (published 1934&#150;74) and wrote (with H. W. Parker) <span class="italic">Guide for the identification and reporting of stranded whales, dolphins, porpoises and turtles on the British coasts</span>, first published in 1949. With J. R. Norman, another museum zoologist, Fraser wrote one popular work: <span class="italic">Giant Fishes, Whales and Dolphins</span> (1937).<br>
