<span class="headword">Boso</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1178?), <span class="occ">papal official and cardinal</span>, was by the sixteenth century thought to be an Englishman, but was more probably a Tuscan by birth, from Lucca or Pisa, and may have been a canon of Bologna. The only argument in favour of the tradition that he was related to Pope Adrian IV is that he appears in the curia as scriptor and datary of papal letters in 1149, the year when the future pope Adrian was appointed cardinal-bishop of Albano by Eugenius III. There is also the tradition that he accompanied the cardinal-bishop of Albano on his legation to Scandinavia in 1152&#150;4, and it is certainly true that in this period there is no evidence of Boso's presence in Rome. However, Boso's English contacts may not have been made in the course of this journey but rather through Cardinal Guido da Pisa. Six months after the death of Cardinal Guido (1149), who had been papal chancellor, he is found dating papal letters. He was created cardinal-deacon of Santi Cosma e Damiano in 1156. Whether or not he was English has not been finally resolved. He was later said to have been the friend of successive archbishops of Canterbury, Theobald and Thomas Becket. But these acquaintanceships may have been made during Canterbury legations to Rome, rather than in England. Boso was, however, a firm supporter of Becket's cause in the 1160s.<br>
<br>Boso came to prominence in the important office of papal chamberlain, to which he was appointed by Pope Adrian IV, to whom he was certainly close in temperament and purpose. He conducted a vigorous campaign to restore the papal patrimony in the Campagna and Sabina. He received the oaths of fealty from papal vassals and he had troops at his command. Between 1157 and 1159 Boso, as chamberlain, was effectively the head of the papal household and representative of the pope in both the city and the patrimony; this position explains the important part that he played on the death of Pope Adrian in September 1159, when he tried to secure the election of a pope who would continue Adrian's policies. Boso ceased to be chamberlain under Alexander III, but he accompanied Alexander to France during the schism which followed the disputed election of 1159, and, in 1177, to Venice on a mission to make peace with the emperor Frederick Barbarossa. He was promoted cardinal-priest of Santa Pudenziana by Alexander. His importance to curial administration is attested by his revision of the <span class="italic">Liber censuum</span> but he is also of crucial importance for his revision of and contribution to the <span class="italic">Liber pontificalis</span>. The biographies of Eugenius III, Anastasius IV, Adrian IV, and Alexander III are first-hand accounts and without Boso, knowledge of the twelfth-century popes would be meagre indeed. His account of Alexander III ends at Easter 1178 and, as he ceased to subscribe as cardinal after July 1178, it may be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that he died in that year.<br>
