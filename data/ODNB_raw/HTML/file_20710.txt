<span class="headword">Oliphant,  Laurence, of Gask</span>, styled ninth Lord Oliphant  (1691&#150;1767), <span class="occ">Jacobite army officer</span>, son of James Oliphant (<i>d</i>. 1732), laird of Gask, and Janet (<i>d</i>. 1729), daughter of the Revd Anthony Murray of Woodend, Perthshire, was born on 29 December 1691 at Williamston, Perthshire. The Gask branch of the Oliphants descended from William Oliphant of Newton, Perthshire, second son of Colin, master of Oliphant, slain at Flodden. Some of their lands were traditionally &#145;held on the tenure of a yearly gift of White Roses&#146;  (Lang, 129); the Gask estate itself came into their hands in 1625. Oliphant married Amelia (or Am&eacute;lie) Anne Sophia Murray (1698&#150;1774), second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19729/', "William Nairne, styled second Lord Nairne")</script>, in 1719; they had one son, also Laurence, the father of the poet Carolina, who fittingly married back into the Nairnes in time for the restoration of their title in 1824. The Oliphants were a strongly royalist and Jacobite family, and in the rising of 1715 Laurence was commissioned as a lieutenant in Lord Rollo's Perthshire horse, in which capacity he was present at the battle of Sheriffmuir; subsequently he acted as adjutant while James VIII and III (James Francis Edward Stuart, Jacobite claimant to the throne) was at Scone. After the failure of the rising he lay low for a while, but was back at Gask by March 1718 at the latest. The Gasks received a call for support from the Jacobite leadership in Scotland in 1719, but the rising was over too rapidly for anything to transpire. On the death of his father on 18 April 1732, Oliphant succeeded to the Gask estates. His political outlook led to the appointment of the Jacobite poet William Meston to be young Laurence's tutor in 1736. The family continued to display its support for the exiled Stuarts, and in the early 1740s (possibly for Charles Edward Stuart's twenty-first birthday in 1741) Ebenezer Oliphant, Gask's younger brother and an Edinburgh silversmith, gave Prince Charles a &#145;beautiful rococo canteen of silver-gilt travelling cutlery&#146;  (Lenman, 106). In 1745 Gask was asked to subscribe &#145;for a new edition of Fordun's Scotichronicon&#146;  (Oliphant, 102): later, in exile, Gask's antiquarian interests would find solace in the holdings of the Scots College in Paris.<br>
<br>By 9 August 1745 Gask had heard of the rising, and he and his son took long walks &#145;along the upper terrace of the old garden&#146;  (Anderson, lxxx) to decide which of them would fight. In the end both did, joining the prince at Blair Atholl on 31 August: the next day, Oliphant made his wife factor over his estate, and brought a letter from the prince to Lord George Murray requesting his support. His own tenants were unwilling to follow, and Gask appears to have inhibited them from harvesting their corn, a prohibition gracefully removed by a cut of Prince Charles's sword. In September the Gasks, together with Viscount Strathallan, raised two troops of the Perthshire horse, the first cavalry of the Jacobite army; Strathallan was overall commander, while Gask served as lieutenant-colonel. The horse were present at the battle of Prestonpans, but took no part in the action. While the prince's army was in England, Gask acted as lieutenant-governor of Perth: in this capacity, he held the council house with only nineteen men against an infuriated Hanoverian mob on 30 November. Eventually relief arrived, and Gask remained in post until 6 February, when he reluctantly retreated in the face of overwhelming force. Besides personal bravery, he also displayed guile: after the battle of Falkirk, he accompanied Viscount Strathallan in the guise of a peasant to secure information concerning the extent of the Jacobite victory. At Culloden, after Viscount Strathallan's death, Gask led the horse out of action to final dispersal at Ruthven. He was in hiding thereafter for seven months at Moy, Birkhall, Glenisla, and Strathdee together with his son, who touchingly recalled their experiences many years later. On one occasion, they were close enough to government troops for their servant to hear one soldier say &#145;That's Oliphant&#146;, but Gask's potential attacker was bought off with an opportune gold piece  (Graham, 209).<br>
<br>On the death of Charles, seventh Lord Oliphant, on 19 April 1748, Gask laid claim to the title, which was, however, assumed by William Oliphant. On his death on 3 June 1751, he apparently named Gask his heir, but David Oliphant of Bachilton succeeded instead, and indeed Gask may not have been entitled to the honour in law; however, the peerage was emptily confirmed to him by James VIII and III on 14 July 1760. His estate, under the management of the barons of the exchequer, was purchased by his kinsman Oliphant of Condie in 1753, and Gask took a lively interest in its affairs. In exile, he took the alias John Whytt, and lived in considerable poverty, moving from Versailles to Corbeil in 1755 &#145;in hopes of having everything Cheaper&#146;  (Tayler, 212); his grandson apparently died from malnutrition in 1757. None the less, in 1759 he could still gather for a celebration with other Scots and Irish exiles in Paris on 10 June, James's birthday. In 1763 Gask's wife was granted a pension of &pound;111 by George III, and Oliphant &#145;returned to his ancestral home, apparently with the tacit consent of the government&#146;  (Smith, 12), although the attainder remained. He died at Gask on 1 April 1767. His son went on to become one of the last Jacobites: when the larger part of the Scottish Episcopal church finally accepted the inevitable and disowned Jacobitism on Charles's death in 1788, young Laurence sacked his (now juring) episcopal chaplain. With Lord Ogilvie, the Gasks were &#145;perhaps the last partisans of the alliance between France and Scotland&#146;  (Oliphant, 428), ideological episcopalian Jacobites of undiluted vigour and a distinctly Scottish world view.<br>
