<span class="headword">Ranby,  John</span>  (1703&#150;1773), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, the son of Joseph Ranby of St Giles-in-the-Fields, London, innkeeper, was apprenticed to Edward Barnard, foreign brother of the Company of Barber&#150;Surgeons, on 5 March 1715, paying him the sum of &pound;32 5<i>s</i>. On 5 October 1722 Ranby's surgical skills were examined. His answers were approved, and he was ordered the seal of the Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company as a foreign brother. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 30 November 1724. He married, in 1729, Jane, the elder daughter of the Hon. Dacre Barrett-Lennard. Queen Caroline, according to Lord Hervey, &#145;once asked Ranby whilst he was dressing her wound if he would not be glad to be officiating in the same manner to his own old cross wife that he hated so much&#146;  (Hervey). Ranby was appointed surgeon-in-ordinary to the king's household in 1738, and in 1740 he was promoted sergeant&#150;surgeon to George II. He became principal sergeant&#150;surgeon in May 1743, and in this capacity accompanied the king during the German campaign of that year. Ranby was present at the battle of Dettingen, where the duke of Cumberland, the king's second son, was one of his patients.<br>
<br>In 1745 Ranby's influence with the king and the government of the day was sufficient to ensure the passing of the act of parliament constituting a Company of Surgeons distinct from that of the barbers. His exertions in promoting this separation were rewarded by his nomination as the first master of the newly founded surgeons' company, a special favour, as he had never held any office in the old and united Company of Barber&#150;Surgeons. Joseph Sandford, the senior warden of the old company, and William Cheselden, the junior warden, took office under him as the first wardens. Ranby presented a silver loving cup to the company to mark his year of office, and it is still in the possession of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. He was re-elected master of the company in 1751, when the company entered into occupation of their new theatre in the Old Bailey, and for a third time in 1752. Ranby was appointed surgeon to the Chelsea Hospital on 13 May 1752 in succession to Cheselden. He became a controversial figure as a result of his role during the last illnesses of Queen Caroline, in 1737, and of Robert Walpole, earl of Orford, in 1745  (see <span class="italic">A Narrative of the Last Illness of the Earl of Orford</span>, 1745). Ranby had a large surgical practice, and the surgeon introduced by Fielding into his novel <span class="italic">Tom Jones</span> (1749) is said to be him. He is also mentioned in Fielding's <span class="italic">Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon</span> (1755). It has also been claimed that Ranby served as the model for the hero in Hogarth's <span class="italic">Rake's Progress</span>  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 29). Ranby was a man of strong passions, harsh voice, and inelegant manners. Queen Caroline called him &#145;the blockhead&#146; before submitting to the operation from which she died.<br>
<br>Ranby's writings include <span class="italic">The Method of Treating Gunshot Wounds</span> (1744), an account of some of the surgical cases which came under Ranby's care when he served under Lord Stair in the German campaign, terminating at the battle of Dettingen, and &#145;Three curious dissections by John Ranby, esq., surgeon to his majesty's household and F.R.S. 1728&#146;, printed in William Beckett's <span class="italic">Collection of Chirurgical Tracts</span> (1740).<br>
<br>Ranby died on 28 August 1773, after a few hours' illness, at his apartments in Chelsea Hospital, and was buried in the south-west portion of the burying-ground attached to the hospital, in a square sandstone tomb with a simple inscription.<br>
<br>A natural son of the surgeon, <a name="cosubject_23107"></a><span class="headword">John Ranby</span>  (1743&#150;1820), <span class="occ">pamphleteer</span>, assumed the name of Ranby by royal licence in exchange for that of George Osborne, in 1756. Educated at Eton College, he stated that he knew Richard Watson, afterwards bishop of Llandaff, at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was admitted on 26 May 1761; however, he did not graduate. Ranby, who was admitted at Lincoln's Inn in 1762, &#145;huzzaed after Mr. Wilkes&#146; in 1763, but developed into a partisan pamphleteer on the tory side. In 1791 he published <span class="italic">Doubts on the Abolition of the Slave Trade</span>, which James Boswell (who called Ranby his &#145;learned and ingenious friend&#146;) highly commended. In 1794, in his <span class="italic">Short Hints on a French Invasion</span>, he deprecated the general tendency to panic. Three years later he supported Bishop Watson in his controversy with Gilbert Wakefield, and in 1811 he attempted to explode the theory of the increasing influence of the crown. In later life he lived first at Woodford in Essex, where he befriended Thomas Maurice, the orientalist, and then at Bury St Edmunds, where he died on 31 March 1820. He was buried at Brent Eleigh in Suffolk, and a monument was placed there commemorating him and his wife, Mary, daughter of Edward Grote and Mary Barnardiston. Mary Ranby died on 3 January 1814.<br>
