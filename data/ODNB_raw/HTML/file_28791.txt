<span class="headword">Warren,  Samuel</span>  (1781&#150;1862), <span class="occ">Wesleyan Methodist minister</span>, was born either in Great Yarmouth or Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, the son of Samuel Warren, a sea captain. In 1806 he married his first wife, Anne (1778&#150;1823), daughter of Richard and Elizabeth Williams; they had a daughter and six sons, the eldest of whom, also <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28792/', "Samuel Warren")</script>, became a noted novelist. Anne died in 1823; Warren's second wife, Jane, survived him. Warren was an apprentice on his father's ship when it was captured by the French in May 1794. After some eighteen months as a prisoner of war he took up nautical studies in Liverpool. There he became a Wesleyan Methodist in 1800, entering the ministry two years later. He gained the degrees of MA (1818) and LLD (1825) from Glasgow University, produced a standard manual of Methodist law (1827), and commanded respect, if little influence, in the Wesleyan hierarchy.<br>
<br>In 1834 Warren unexpectedly emerged as the leading figure in a controversy that resulted in a major secession from Wesleyan Methodism and the formation of the Wesleyan Association (designated Wesleyan Methodist Association in 1839). The immediate cause of this division was the proposed establishment of the first Wesleyan Theological Institution. At the Wesleyan conference of 1834 Warren headed the unsuccessful opposition to this proposal and particularly objected to the further concentration of power in the hands of Jabez Bunting, the nominated president of the institution and the dominant Wesleyan figure of this period. Some connexional leaders alleged that Warren was motivated by his failure to secure a teaching post at the institution. The publication of Warren's conference speech (September 1834) and his refusal to defend it at the Manchester special district meeting led to his suspension from ministerial duties as superintendent of the Manchester Oldham Street circuit (22 October 1834).<br>
<br>These proceedings prompted a widespread protest movement that originated in south Lancashire, where the Grand Central Association, the forerunner of the Wesleyan Association, was formed in Manchester (6 November 1834). Originally known as Warrenites, the protesters also campaigned in defence of the local, lay-dominated Methodist institutions against the central powers of the exclusively ministerial Wesleyan conference. During the ensuing bitter contest, in which the Wesleyan authorities expelled all dissidents, Warren failed in his application to the court of chancery for restoration to the Oldham Street circuit pulpits (March 1835). He was formally expelled from the Wesleyan conference in August 1835.<br>
<br>The Wesleyan Association, the earliest reported membership of which was 21,275 (1837), elected Warren president at its first annual assembly (August 1836). It quickly became apparent, however, that Warren himself had serious reservations about the democratic character of this new body. He sought to check this tendency by promoting union with the Methodist New Connexion, but he was defeated at the annual assembly of 1837. Shortly afterwards he resigned from the Wesleyan Association (October 1837). The final twist in his public life occurred in the following year when he was ordained in the Church of England. He was inducted into the living of All Souls, Ancoats (December 1840), a languishing cause in a slum parish, where he remained until his death at Polygon Avenue, Ardwick, Manchester, on 23 May 1862.<br>
