<span class="headword">Peacock,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1581), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was the son of Thomas Peacock, burgess of Cambridge (<i>d</i>. 1541), and his wife, Alice (<i>d</i>. 1546/7), and was born in Holy Trinity parish, Cambridge. He was elected to a fellowship at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1533/4, graduated BA that year, MA in 1537, and BTh in 1554. He should not be confused (as in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>) with the Thomas Peacock who was active as a stipendiary priest in Ipswich in the 1530s and 1540s, as the Cambridge Peacock was active in college and university life throughout this time, and was not ordained until Mary's reign. Of conservative religious opinions, he was among the &#145;appellants&#146; at St John's who unsuccessfully objected to the managerial regime of the college's evangelical master John Taylor in 1542. Peacock's mother died over the winter of 1546&#150;7, and left him a house and two tenements in Cambridge. In 1547 he took up a fellowship at the newly founded Trinity College (joining several other refugees from St John's). Trinity, then under the mastership of John Redman (himself a former Johnian), was still loyal to the conservative traditions of the institutions it had swallowed up, King's Hall and Michaelhouse. During the royal visitation of the university in 1549, Peacock was identified by the protestant visitors as one of a group of hardline papists at Trinity, where there was &#145;such a nest of them as the like cannot be espied within the realm&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 10/7/10, fols. 39&#150;40). Once Redman himself had been induced to subscribe to the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> (apparently with some reservations), resistance collapsed. Peacock appears to have remained at Trinity throughout Edward VI's reign, notwithstanding the increasingly uncongenial doctrine and liturgy of the Church of England.<br>
<br>The accession of Queen Mary in 1553 must have come as a great relief to Peacock, and certainly did his career no harm. It was only now that he finally took his BTh and entered holy orders. He also found considerable preferment at the hands of the bishop of Norwich, Thomas Thirlby (himself a native of Cambridge, from the same parish as Peacock, namely Holy Trinity), who made him his chaplain and gave him a canonry at Norwich in 1554. When Thirlby was translated to Ely later that year, he took Peacock with him, collating him to the rectory of Little Downham in 1555 and to a canonry at Ely in 1556 (in place of that at Norwich). In his capacity as Thirlby's chaplain, Peacock assisted at the trial for heresy of William Wolsey and Robert Pygot at Ely, preaching (on <span class="roman">1 Corinthians</span> 5) at their burning on 16 October 1555. Peacock clearly had continuing links with Cambridge University: on 1 April 1555 he signed the articles which bound the university to Roman Catholic doctrine; and during Cardinal Pole's visitation of the university, he preached before the visitors at Great St Mary's on 11 January 1557, &#145;inveighing against heresies and heretics as Bilney, Cranmer, Latimer, Ridley, etc&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 8.266). In January 1558 Thirlby presented him to the rectory of Barley (near Royston, Hertfordshire).<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1557, Peacock was elected president of Queens' College, Cambridge, where his tenure was brief and controversial. In March 1559 a dispute over fellowship elections became so embittered that both parties wrote to the university's chancellor, Sir William Cecil, in an attempt to have their position vindicated. Although the quarrel was over the implementation and interpretation of the statutes regarding elections, the underlying issues seem to have been both personal and religious. The minority appealing against Peacock suggested that the president and his supporters were rushing through improper elections in order to get people into the college ahead of the imminent restoration of protestantism. In a coda to this accusation, the dissidents charged him with paying &pound;10 over the odds for a piece of land purchased for the college from a friend of his supporters among the fellowship, one Thomas Leete. Refusing to subscribe to the royal supremacy, which was restored by Queen Elizabeth in 1559, Peacock was stripped of his ecclesiastical preferments, although by resigning the presidency of Queens' in May he avoided the indignity of expulsion. Thereafter it might have been thought that he lived out his life obscurely in Cambridge, as in 1563 he made a grant of 20<i>s</i>. a year to the churchwardens of Holy Trinity parish, and in October 1581 he gave &pound;20 to the city corporation to support a monthly dole for prisoners in the Tolbooth. However, he makes one remarkable appearance out of the shadows. A letter written in 1567 by none other than Nicholas Sander, a leading Catholic refugee on the continent, indicates that Thomas Peacock was one of four English priests who met the grand inquisitor in Rome in 1564 and personally received from him faculties to reconcile schismatics to the Roman Catholic church. Peacock certainly returned to Cambridge thereafter, but it is not known what use, if any, he made of these special powers. He left no will, so his donation to the city in 1581 may well have represented the disposal of his worldly goods, and he probably died soon afterwards.<br>
