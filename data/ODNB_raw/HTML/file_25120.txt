<span class="headword">Seton,  George</span>, fourth Lord Seton  (<em>c.</em>1508&#150;1549), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the second surviving son of George, third Lord Seton (<i>d</i>. 1513), and Janet Hepburn (<i>d</i>. 1558), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13006/', "Patrick Hepburn, first earl of Bothwell")</script>. Seton's elder brother, also named George, died in infancy. He succeeded, aged about five years, to the family lands and titles on the death of his father at the battle of Flodden (9 September 1513), and was served heir in Seton, Wintoun, and Tranent in Haddingtonshire and in Winchburgh, Binning, Hartshead, and Clents in Linlithgowshire.<br>
<br>On account of his youth Seton played little part in the turbulent politics of the minority of James V, and he entered public life only in 1526 when nominated a member of the <i>pro judicibus</i> committee in parliament. In July 1528 he aligned with the king against Archibald Douglas, sixth earl of Angus, and accompanied James from Stirling to Edinburgh as he moved against the earl. As a crown supporter he was named among the session of the lords of council convened by James on 6 July. In October 1528, together with other crown adherents in Haddingtonshire, Seton was charged with clearing Lothian of Angus and his supporters, and with ensuring that Angus's castle of Tantallon was isolated from supply in preparation for a royal siege.<br>
<br>Seton's subsequent public career under James V was unspectacular, being characterized by consistent loyal service for which he received a steady flow of royal patronage. This included the erection of his Linlithgowshire properties into the free barony of West Niddrie in 1541 and the erection of his town of Tranent into a burgh of barony in 1542. Following James's death in December 1542 Seton was associated closely with the regime of the regent, James Hamilton, second earl of Arran. In January 1543 Arran entrusted him with the custody of Cardinal David Beaton, who was confined briefly in Seton Castle. Seton's importance in Arran's government was underlined in March 1543 when he was nominated to the privy council, and he supported the regent in his negotiations for the marriage of Queen Mary to Edward, prince of Wales, formalized in the treaty of Greenwich. Seton subsequently followed Arran into his association with Cardinal Beaton and the pro-French party, for which his lands and castle at Seton were burned during the earl of Hertford's invasion of Scotland in 1544. Despite this Seton remained firm in his adherence to the pro-French party, a stance possibly strengthened by Beaton's feuing to him of valuable church properties in Linlithgowshire, and on 26 June 1545 he signed a band confirming Scotland's alliance with France.<br>
<br>Seton married twice. His first marriage, contracted on 10 April 1527, was to Elizabeth Hay, daughter of John, first Lord Hay of Yester, and his first wife, Elizabeth, eldest daughter of George Douglas, master of Angus. Their sons were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25121/', "George Seton")</script>, who succeeded as fifth Lord Seton, and John and James; and their daughters were Jean, Marion, Margaret, Beatrix, and Eleanor. Elizabeth Hay was dead before February 1539, when Seton was betrothed to Marie Pieris, a Frenchwoman in the retinue of Mary of Guise, second queen of James V. They had two sons, Robert and James, and a daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70083/', "Mary Seton")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69949/', "Queen's Maries (act. 1548&#150;1567)")</script>], who in 1548 accompanied Queen Mary to France and served her as one of the four Marys. Seton died on 17 July 1549 at Culross in Perthshire and was buried there, but his remains were later reinterred in the choir of his family's collegiate church at Seton. Among contemporaries he had the reputation of an excellent falconer. Marie Pieris survived him, and married before October 1554, Pierre de Clovis, seigneur de Bryante; she died around 1576.<br>
