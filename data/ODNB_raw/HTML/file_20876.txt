<span class="headword">Osborne,  Francis</span>, fifth duke of Leeds  (1751&#150;1799), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born and baptized on 29 January 1751 in the parish of St James's, Westminster, the only surviving son of Thomas Osborne, fourth duke of Leeds (1713&#150;1789), politician, and Lady Mary Godolphin (<i>d</i>. 1764), daughter and eventual heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10877/', "Francis Godolphin, second earl of Godolphin")</script>. Styled marquess of Carmarthen, he was educated at Westminster School (1764&#150;7), and matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 11 June 1767; he was created MA on 30 March 1769 and DCL on 7 July 1773. A member of the Royal Society from 1773, he was also proud of his literary knowledge and even dabbled in amateur playwriting. &#145;If his knowledge was not profound it was miscellaneous and extensive&#146;, noted one memorialist  (<span class="italic">Political Memoranda</span>, ii); another that he was &#145;most polite and pleasing in his manners, with a sweet temper and an excellent understanding, happily cultivated&#146;  (Doran, 258). On 29 November 1773, at Holdernesse House, Hertford Street, London, he married Lady Amelia D'Arcy (1754&#150;1784), daughter and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7147/', "Robert D'Arcy, fourth earl of Holdernesse")</script>, and Mary Doublet, countess of Mertola (<i>d</i>. 1801). They had two sons and a daughter, but the marriage ended in scandal in December 1778 when the marchioness ran off with Captain Jack Byron (<i>d</i>. 1791), father by a subsequent marriage of the poet Byron. After obtaining a divorce on 31 May 1779, Carmarthen married, on 11 October 1788, at Hanwell, Middlesex, Catherine (1764&#150;1837), daughter of Thomas Anguish, master in chancery, and Sarah Henley; they had a son and a daughter.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer17741783"></a>Early career, 1774&#150;1783</h2>In 1774 Carmarthen was returned at a by-election for the borough of Eye in Suffolk. The seat was made available as compensation for his father's surrendering of the office of chief justice on eyre north of Trent. &#145;My father&#146;, he noted, &#145;did not much approve the plan; but seeing my wish to come into the House of Commons, merely to oblige me consented&#146;. In view of the burgeoning American crisis, Carmarthen was &#145;convinced of the necessity of strengthening government&#146; and &#145;had no scruple in voting uniformly with them&#146;, the sole exception being a vote in the minority on 28 April over the Massachusetts petition, as he &#145;could by no means approve of the rejecting it unheard&#146;. He spoke four times in favour of the bills to regulate the government of Massachusetts during May, but did not attend the debates on the <span class="roman">Quebec Bill</span>. At the general election of 1774 he took advantage of an electoral interest at Helston in Cornwall which he had inherited from his grandfather Lord Godolphin. He was returned only to be unseated on petition on 15 March 1775. Of this second brief spell in the Commons he recalled that &#145;I took no active part &hellip; on account of the uncertainty of my situation; however, I voted with the government except upon Lord North's conciliatory plan&#146; on 20 February 1775  (<span class="italic">Political Memoranda</span>, 1&#150;4).<br>
<br>Carmarthen had already decided that in the event of losing his seat in the Commons he would request elevation to the Lords. On 15 May 1776 he was called up in his father's barony as Lord Osborne of Kiveton. He held court appointments as a lord of the bedchamber (1776&#150;7) and lord chamberlain of the queen's household (1777&#150;80). Having been made a privy councillor in 1777, he was also appointed lord lieutenant of the East Riding of Yorkshire the following year. He gradually became dissatisfied with Lord North's administration, and dated his change of heart to the time of Admiral Keppel's court martial in January 1779. Having also become a convert to economic reform, he resigned his place at court on 31 December and was summarily dismissed from his lord lieutenancy on 8 February 1780. Now an active member of the parliamentary opposition, he was on friendly terms with lords Shelburne and Rockingham, though belonging to the faction of neither. He published two political pamphlets advocating changes in men and measures, entitled <span class="italic">A Letter to the Right Honourable, Ld. Th[urlo]w</span> (1780) and <span class="italic">An Address to the Independent Members of both Houses of Parliament</span> (1782). He was restored to the lord lieutenancy at the insistence of the Rockingham administration in March 1782, and with the further change of ministry in July was appointed by Shelburne as ambassador-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary at Paris. He did not proceed to France, however, and resigned in April 1783 in the wake of Shelburne's fall.<h2>
<a name="Foreignsecretary17831791"></a>Foreign secretary, 1783&#150;1791</h2>As an opponent of the Fox&#150;North coalition of 1783 Osborne was ideally placed to be recruited by William Pitt, who was desperately short of cabinet material as he tried to establish a viable ministry during the constitutional crisis precipitated by the defeat of the <span class="roman">East India Bill</span>. On 23 December 1783 Osborne was appointed secretary of state for foreign affairs in Pitt's administration. He succeeded his father as fifth duke of Leeds on 23 March 1789, and was elected a knight of the Garter on 15 December 1790, though for some reason he was never formally invested with this honour. Within Pitt's cabinet he remained something of a makeweight, proving an undistinguished foreign secretary. It was widely believed that the prime minister was the driving force behind foreign policy, as had clearly been the case in the commercial treaty with France of 1787. Conversely, Leeds's guiding principle was hostility to France. He was therefore delighted by the revolutionary turmoil of 1789. &#145;I defy the ablest heads in England&#146;, he wrote in July, &#145;to have planned, or its whole wealth to have purchased, a situation so fatal to its rival, as that to which France is now reduced by her own intestine commotions&#146;  (duke of Leeds to duke of Dorset, 31 July 1789, BL, Add. MS 28064).<br>
<br>The duke of Leeds resigned as foreign secretary over the Ochakov affair of 1791. This complicated episode has often been glossed over as a minor incident. Indeed a contemporary journal described the affair shortly afterwards as being probably &#145;of small importance in the eyes of posterity&#146; and &#145;already almost forgotten at home&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Register</span>, 1793, 33). But the dispute over Russian retention of Ochakov&#151;a Black Sea port captured from the Turks in 1788&#151;nevertheless marked an early appearance of the Eastern question in British diplomacy. Pitt, supported by Leeds, aimed at a complex diplomatic realignment involving Prussia and Poland, with additional support from Denmark. The scheme encountered difficulties because the true objectives could not be revealed in public for fear of undermining confidential negotiations still under way. It was na&iuml;vely hoped that Russia would back down in the face of a show of British naval force in the Baltic, and that Ochakov would be returned to Turkish control. This would open up new trade routes from Poland, in turn smoothing the path for her cession of Danzig to Prussia. The overriding objective was the strengthening of the British&#150;Prussian relationship, but the brinkmanship involved proved unpopular. The parliamentary opposition led by Charles James Fox adopted an anti-war and pro-Russian stance, so Pitt wisely decided to back down. Leeds resigned in a fit of pique, believing his position to have been seriously undermined by the change in policy. Yet, the absurdity of continuing bellicosity towards Russia became apparent when Denmark refused to open her ports to the British navy, thus negating a key strategic element in the original scheme.<h2>
<a name="Latercareer17921799"></a>Later career, 1792&#150;1799</h2>Although he retained precious little political influence, Leeds suffered occasional delusions of grandeur, the most notable of which occurred in the summer of 1792, when he convinced himself that he might form a ministry of national unity as first lord of the Treasury, with Pitt and Fox serving under him as secretaries of state. The affair ended in a farcical interview with George III on 14 August. The notion of appointing a neutral figure to the Treasury struck the king as absurd: &#145;it would be awkward for Mr Pitt &hellip; to descend to an inferior situation &hellip; and that whoever was the First Lord must either be a cipher or Mr Pitt appear as a <i>commis</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Political Memoranda</span>, 189). In fact Leeds had been the dupe of an elaborate plan by Fox to counter the equally devious machinations of Lord Loughborough that were destabilizing the whig opposition. When Leeds reported that George III had also informed him that Pitt had not recently broached the subject of coalition, this confirmed the suspicions of the opposition leadership and simultaneously exposed Loughborough's self-seeking ambition. The affair was terminated by a confrontation between the duke and the prime minister. Leeds was astonished at Pitt's brazen assertion that &#145;there had been no thoughts of any alteration in the government, that circumstances did not call for it, nor did the people wish it, and that no new arrangement, either by change or coalition, had ever been in contemplation&#146;  (ibid., 194). Once Leeds had relayed this information to members of the opposition, they supplied him with sufficient details of the earlier approaches to Loughborough to confirm beyond &#145;all doubt that Mr Pitt's saying &#147;No change had been in contemplation&#148; was not strictly true&#146;  (ibid., 196). The duke of Portland concluded that the affair had demonstrated that Leeds did not have &#145;any weight with Pitt, or in the Closet, or anywhere&#146;  (Portland to Fox, 21 July 1792, BL, Add. MS 47561, fol. 120). Lord Malmesbury noted acerbically that Leeds had been &#145;carried away more by his imagination and sanguine hopes, in which his string of toad-eaters encourage him, than by reason and reflection&#146;  (Harris, 2.470&#150;73).<br>
<br>Leeds spoke for the last time in the Lords on 30 May 1797, during the debate on the duke of Bedford's motion for the dismissal of the Pitt ministry. On this occasion he gave limited support to the notion of a change in administration, ridiculing the idea that &#145;the existence of the constitution was inseparably connected with the continuation of the present ministry in power&#146;, but he also distanced himself from the more radical opponents of government by declaring that parliamentary reform was &#145;a most dangerous remedy to resort to&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 32.762&#150;3).<br>
<br>Leeds died of erysipelas at his house in St James's Square, London, on 31 January 1799, aged forty-eight, and was buried in All Saints' Church, Harthill, Yorkshire. George William Frederick (1775&#150;1838), his elder son by his first marriage, succeeded as sixth duke. One obituary commended the late duke's amiable manners and personal integrity, but inadvertently drew attention to the shortcomings of his political career by describing him as a man of &#145;higher talents than he was generally supposed to possess&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 69/1, 1799, 169). Indeed, his vanity had long been a standing joke in society. So frequent were his references to his time at the Foreign Office that some acquaintances had taken to placing bets on how long it would be before he mentioned it in conversation.<br>
