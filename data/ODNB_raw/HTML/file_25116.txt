<span class="headword">Seton,  Alexander</span>  (1814&#150;1852), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Mounie, Aberdeenshire, on 4 October 1814, the second but eldest surviving son among the five sons and three daughters of Alexander Seton (<i>d</i>. 1850) of Mounie and his wife, Janet Skene, daughter of Skene Ogilvy, minister of Old Machar, Aberdeenshire. He was descended from <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25115/', "Sir Alexander Seton, Lord Pitmedden")</script>. He was educated at home until the age of fifteen, and then studied mathematics and chemistry for some months under Ferdinando Foggi at Pisa.<br>
<br>On 23 November 1832 Seton was gazetted second lieutenant in the 21st Royal North British Fusiliers, and the following year was sent with part of his regiment to Australia. He returned to Scotland on leave in 1838, and was promoted first lieutenant on 2 March. He rejoined his regiment in India, and received a company on 14 January 1842. Shortly after he exchanged into the 74th highlanders and was stationed at Chatham. There he studied for two years in the senior department of the Royal Military College, and in November 1847 received a first-class certificate. In 1849 he went to Ireland as assistant deputy quartermaster-general of the forces there. He held this post until 24 May 1850, when he was promoted major. Proficient in several languages, he was a studious officer, with literary and artistic interests.<br>
<br>On 7 November 1851 Seton obtained the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and shortly afterwards was ordered to take command of the drafts destined for the Cape of Good Hope, where his regiment was engaged in the Cape Frontier War. He sailed in the steam troopship <i>Birkenhead</i>, headed for Algoa Bay, which on the morning of 26 February 1852 struck a rock off Danger Point, south of Cape Town, and foundered in little more than ten minutes. Out of 638 persons, 445 were lost, Seton himself being killed by the fall of part of the wreck. He died unmarried, and his property descended to his younger brother, David Seton (1817&#150;1894).<br>
<br>Survivors from the <i>Birkenhead</i> described the remarkable coolness and discipline of the troops under Seton's command during the ship's last moments. The women and children were safely disembarked onto a cutter. &#145;I never saw an embarkation conducted with so little noise and confusion&#146;, a surviving officer reported  (Addison, 20). Seton's order that the men on deck should stand fast while the disembarkation took place, and not risk swamping the cutter in a bid to save their own lives, was calmly obeyed. This enabled all the women and children to survive. The king of Prussia ordered that the official account of the sinking should be read out to each of his regiments, as an exemplary instance of military discipline. Although the troops' calmness in the face of death was widely applauded, no medal or promotion was awarded, and David Seton complained of the slowness of any form of official recognition. At the instigation of Queen Victoria a memorial was placed in the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, in 1859, &#145;to record the heroic constancy and unbroken discipline shown by Lieutenant-Colonel Seton, 74th Highlanders, and the troops embarked under his command&#146;  (ibid., 3). Their deed was also commemorated by Sir Francis Doyle in his poem &#145;The Loss of the Birkenhead&#146; in <span class="italic">Return of the Guards and other Poems</span> (1866). In 1892 a painting by the marine artist Thomas M. Hemy, reproduced as a print, represented the scene on the deck of the sinking ship, labelled by Rudyard Kipling as the &#145;Birkenhead drill&#146;. School reading books recorded the <i>Birkenhead</i> disembarkation as a heroic example of &#145;women and children first&#146;. Layers of sensational embellishments and fictions were cut away in a detailed account prompted by the fiftieth anniversary of the sinking. But Seton's coolness, and the effectiveness of his orders in preserving the women and children's lives, were reaffirmed and seen not as evidence not only of military discipline but also of heroic and chivalric self-sacrifice.<br>
