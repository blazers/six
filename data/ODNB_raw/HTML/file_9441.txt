<span class="headword">Finch,  Robert</span>  (1783&#150;1830), <span class="occ">antiquary and connoisseur of the arts</span>, was born in London on 27 November 1783, the son of Thomas Finch (<i>d</i>. 1810), barrister of the Inner Temple and fellow of the Royal Society, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1827). His father's family seems to have been remotely connected with the Finches, earls of Winchilsea and of Aylesford. Robert Finch attended St Paul's School, 1795&#150;8, and was thereafter tutored before matriculating at Balliol College, Oxford; he graduated BA in 1805 (MA 1809). He was ordained deacon in 1807 but there is no record of his having proceeded to priest's orders. He served curacies, principally at Maidstone. Two sermons published there in 1809, &#145;The Crown of Pure Gold&#146; and &#145;Protestantism our surest bulwark&#146;, failed to launch his clerical career, but his father's death left him well enough off to leave his curacy and take pupils.<br>
<br>He was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1809. In 1813 he travelled in Portugal and from 1814 lived on the continent, mainly in Italy. His manuscript journals show him a cultivated but doggedly observant traveller, expert in Italian history and antiquities. Allegedly for reasons of administrative convenience when crossing frontiers he assumed, about 1815, the title of lieutenant-colonel. Finch's transparent imposture was frequently challenged, but service in the 16th light dragoons became his settled delusion. It was in the character of &#145;Colonel Finch&#146;, reminiscing on his military career in Portugal, that he was first encountered by Mary Shelley in Rome in April 1819, who dubbed him &#145;Colonel Calicot Finch&#146; after a character in Thomas Moore's <span class="italic">The Fudge Family in Paris</span> (1818). Finch recurs in the correspondence of the Shelley circle at this period as a boastful, irascible fellow, but his ample journals have proved a useful source of information on their continental acquaintance. Finch delighted in knowing prominent people, but they usually noted his vanity and pretensions. He extended patronage and hospitality to English artists in Italy&#151;Severn, Eastlake, Etty, and Pennethorne among them&#151;and Crabb Robinson knew him well in later years. His main claim to literary remembrance is having sent a description of Keats's death to Gisborne; it was passed on to Shelley, who was much moved by &#145;the heart rending account of the closing scene of the great genius&#146;.<br>
<br>A small place in the footnotes of Romantic scholarship gives this pretentious ass a lingering reputation that his collections would never have justified. Funds deriving from Finch's parents' urban property north of Holborn, though less extensive than he wished, enabled him to assemble a collection of works of art. A small gallery of pictures showed but limited discrimination. Its contents (many now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford) have mostly been deposed from Finch's optimistic attributions to major artists. A &#145;jackdaw&#146; collection of coins and Napoleonic medals is also in the Ashmolean, but is of no special interest. His library, strong in Italian works, is now divided between the Taylor Institution and the Bodleian Library, Oxford; the latter also holds his journals, correspondence, and collections on classical subjects.<br>
<br>It was as the Revd Robert Finch rather than as a supposititious officer of dragoons that he died in Rome on 16 September 1830, ending his days at the Palazzo del Re di Prussia&#151;a location that must have gratified his innocent vanity. In 1820 he had married Maria, eldest daughter of Frederick Thomson, of Kensington. There were no children of the marriage, but Finch took as his heir the young Henry (Enrico) Mayer, whose parents he had met in Italy. He developed a &#145;purely paternal&#146; affection for the boy (who became a prominent liberal educationist in Italy). Mayer acted as his amanuensis, and inherited a life interest in Finch's collections; in 1840 he arranged a transfer of the Finch collections to the University of Oxford, which, after his death in 1877, became the ultimate beneficiary of Finch's will. Finch's obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> notes that he was an occasional contributor, as he was also to the <span class="italic">British Critic</span>. Some Latin poems of his were printed abroad, but his published writings were few. Finch's widow erected an imposing gothick monument to him in the English cemetery in Rome.<br>
