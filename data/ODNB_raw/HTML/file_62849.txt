<span class="headword">Darwall,  John</span>  (1796&#150;1833), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was the son of the Revd John Darwall (<i>d</i>. 1828), the incumbent of St John's Chapel, Deritend, and master of the Free School (King Edward VI Grammar School) in Birmingham, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whately. At the age of five he was sent to a preparatory school, and from eight he was educated by his father at the grammar school. In 1808 he was placed under the tuition of the Revd John Cooke, the school's headmaster, and took great pleasure in classical learning. His father, grandfather and great-grandfather had been Church of England ministers, and his own religious learning was equally noted.<br>
<br>On leaving school in 1813, Darwall became a pupil of George Freer, surgeon to the General Hospital, Birmingham, and founder of the Birmingham orthopaedic charity. A serious-minded student, with little interest in amusements, Darwall claimed never to have entered a public ballroom and openly condemned &#145;frivolous diversions&#146;  (Conolly, 493). In October 1816 he gained further surgical training in London, attending John Abernethy's lectures and ward rounds at St Bartholomew's Hospital. In May 1817 he became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. His case notes demonstrate an early interest in medicine, not just surgery. Not content with the &#145;superficial manner&#146;  (ibid., 495) in which medicine was at that time taught in the capital, he travelled to Edinburgh the following autumn.<br>
<br>At Edinburgh Darwall studied physic under James Gregory, anatomy with Alexander Monro III and John Barclay, materia medica with James Home and physiology with John Gordon. He joined the Edinburgh Medical Society, where he made some close friends, but generally pursued his studies in a manner that was detrimental to both his social life and health. He returned to Birmingham after his first winter in Edinburgh to assist his former master, Freer, whose health was declining. During the summer of 1820 he began investigations into the health of working people in Birmingham, visiting them in workshops and in their homes. He presented his findings before the Edinburgh Medical Society in 1820, later developing the study into a thesis, <span class="italic">De Morbis Artificum</span> (1821), a decade before Charles Thackrah published what became the classic English study on occupational health. He contributed &#145;Diseases of Artisans&#146;, among five other entries, to the four-volume <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia of Practical Medicine</span> (1831&#150;5), edited by John Forbes, Alexander Tweedie, and John Conolly. During his second winter in Edinburgh he became acquainted with Conolly, the mental health pioneer, who wrote Darwall's biography. The two graduated together in August 1821. Some months prior to taking his degree, Darwall married Mary, the only daughter of Philemon Price, of Birmingham. Immediately on graduating Darwall returned to Birmingham to establish himself in practice. Two years later, Conolly settled in Stratford and the two continued their friendship for the remainder of Darwall's life.<br>
<br>Appointed physician to the Birmingham General Dispensary, Darwall was anxious to build his practice. He treated many poor patients free of charge at his home, often prescribing for more than eighty in a single morning. He used the newest technologies, including the stethoscope, and kept careful notes on all his cases, especially those that ended fatally. He wrote many articles for periodicals, including the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal</span>, some of which reveal his use of the microscope and attention to pathology. For two years he assisted Dr James Copeland in editing the <span class="italic">London Medical Repository</span>, contributing reviews of German medical literature and monthly reports on prevalent diseases. His association with <span class="italic">The Repository</span> ended in 1827 following his success in private practice, but his business concerns never disappeared. He rarely ventured outside Birmingham, though in 1824 he travelled to London where he pursued medical matters with George Birkbeck and Mr Abernethy. He also briefly visited Gloucester to view the town's asylum and hospital. His articles on dropsy, nervous disease, and medical topography in the <span class="italic">Midland Medical and Surgical Reporter</span>, which he edited with Charles Hastings, convey much about Birmingham and its region. His <span class="italic">Plain Instructions for the Management of Infants</span> (1830) referred to cases he treated while serving in the Birmingham Orthopaedic Hospital (established 1817), and reveals his conservative medical approach. In 1831, on the death of Gabriel De Lys, he was elected physician to the General Hospital, Birmingham, thereby fulfilling his ambition to join the district's leading hospital, which his father had served as house clergyman. On assuming his post, he instituted clinical lectures.<br>
<br>Outside his medical practice, Darwall supported the establishment of both a general and medical library in Birmingham, and the town's botanical gardens. He was a governor of the grammar school. He attended meetings of the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge, occasionally delivering lectures, and joined the Medical Benevolent Society. &#145;Zealously attached to the Church of England&#146;, he was also a strong Tory in politics  (Conolly, 531, 534). He regarded the rise of popular movements in an age of reform with considerable anxiety and the state of the country in the early 1830s &#145;filled him with dejection and distress&#146;  (ibid., 535), physically affecting his digestion, circulation, and sleep, to the point that he discontinued frequenting reading-rooms, so as to avoid the newspapers.<br>
<br>Darwall's condition, already vulnerable due to overwork, deteriorated rapidly when a final illness struck on 30 July 1833, soon after undertaking the post-mortem examination of a patient in the general hospital who had died of a &#145;medullary sarcoma of the bronchial glands&#146;. Having contracted an infection, he woke early the following morning with a fever, and his condition gradually deteriorated over the next eleven days. He died on 10 August 1833 and was interred in the family vault at Christ Church, Birmingham, on 16 August. He was survived by his wife and their two daughters. Conolly described him as &#145;pale, restless, sad&#146;, his letters often revealing &#145;a most deplorable depression of mind&#146;. He was of middle stature, &#145;strongly made, but without clumsiness or corpulency&#146;, had light brown, straight hair and small grey eyes, but with a penetrating countenance. His quick walk and general rapid movements were described by Conolly as indicative of his general character. Possessing a &#145;somewhat ungraceful figure&#146;, he was &#145;socially awkward&#146; and prone to a &#145;severe and sarcastic mode of public address&#146;, though scrupulous in his dress and agreeable in his conversation. In private society, with young persons, and with ladies, he was &#145;animated and even playful&#146;  (Conolly, 500&#150;01). In his last years, &#145;He was fastidious as to the society of females, indifferent to music, he never played cards, and conviviality had no charms for him&#146;  (ibid., 527). Despite Conolly's memoir, Darwall's untimely death deprived him of the wider recognition that the significance of his work in several fields warranted.<br>
