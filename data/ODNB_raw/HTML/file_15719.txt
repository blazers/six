<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Knight,  Gowin</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1713, <em>d.</em> 1772), <span class="occ">physician and inventor of geomagnetic instruments</span>, was baptized at Corringham, Lincolnshire, on 10 September 1713, the son of the local vicar Robert Knight and his wife, Elizabeth. In 1724 the family moved to Leeds, where Knight was educated at the grammar school. In 1731 and 1735 he won scholarships to Magdalen Hall and then to Magdalen College; he studied natural philosophy and medicine at Oxford until 1741. Soon afterwards he went to London, where he spent the rest of his life. In 1750 he moved from Lincoln's Inn Fields to Crane Court, Fleet Street; from 1756 he lived at the British Museum.<br>
<br>By 1744 Knight was practising as a physician in London, and had embarked on the research that won him world renown for his magnets and compasses. He developed techniques for magnetizing steel bars by a repetitive process of stroking them with other magnets to build up their strength. Cheaper and more reliable than natural lodestone, these artificial magnets vitally affected subsequent experimental investigations into magnetic phenomena, popular and educational performances, and navigational practices. Knight also transformed traditional maritime compasses into precise instruments. He thus contributed to the introduction of natural philosophical techniques into navigation, and helped consolidate the increasingly influential role of the Royal Society on mercantile voyages of imperial exploration.<br>
<br>Between 1744 and 1750 Knight gave several spectacular demonstrations of his magnetic bars and compasses at the society, and was rapidly acclaimed as an international expert. He published several papers in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>, which he later edited into a discreet advertising brochure (1758). Made a fellow in 1745, he was awarded the prestigious Copley medal in 1747 for&#151;as the president expressed it&#151;helping the British people &#145;to increase and promote greatly our foreign trade and commerce, whereby we are provided at home with the fruits, the conveniences, the curiosities and the riches of the most distant climates&#146;  (M. Folkes, presidential address, Royal Society journal book, 19.366). Largely because of the commercial significance of navigation, Knight gained social prestige as well as financial reward by promoting his bars, compasses, and other inventions. He exemplified contemporary upwardly mobile entrepreneurs who carved out new types of career in a commercializing society.<br>
<br>Adopting discreet, gentlemanly techniques of self-advertisement, and protecting his methods by secrecy, Knight sold his magnetic inventions privately and also through the instrument dealers George Adams and Jean Magellan. He targeted the quality end of the market for instruments of natural philosophy, warding off cheaper imitations by a signed certificate. He sold three sizes of expensive steel magnetic bars, ranging in price from 2&frac12; guineas a pair to 10 guineas for a pair 15 inches long. He also invented portable cases for storing his bars to prevent the loss of their strength, exceptionally powerful magnets made from iron and linseed oil, and a variation compass for natural philosophers to measure the patterns of terrestrial magnetism. He constructed an impressive wheeled device made from two magazines, each comprising 240 magnetic bars, for magnetizing steel bars more easily than with the laborious stroking procedure. Displayed to eminent visitors at the British Museum, this machine was subsequently used by Michael Faraday. Knight also patented a mechanical window blind and invented a naval sounding device.<br>
<br>After examining a compass damaged during a freak storm, Knight emphasized the benefits a philosophical approach could bring to navigational problems. Following extensive experimentation, he introduced two greatly modified maritime instruments: a steering compass for indicating a ship's course and an azimuth compass, designed in collaboration with John Smeaton, for measuring the angle of variation (the angle at a particular place between geographical north and the direction in which a compass needle is pointing). Knight mounted his compasses in durable non-magnetic brass instead of the usual casings made from perishable wood and iron nails, and he made slender rectangular needles from hard, permanently magnetized steel, which would not rust. His other numerous innovations designed to increase accuracy included revolutionizing the needle's suspension and incorporating a finely divided brass scale. His high-quality instruments were expensive, but could yield far more precise measurements than older models. However, they were more suitable for a philosopher's private study than the rolling deck of an ocean-going ship: bad weather curtailed his own trials at sea.<br>
<br>Knight negotiated lucrative contracts to supply the Royal Navy with magnets and compasses. Benefiting from contacts made through the Royal Society, he convinced naval experts of the value of his inventions, and the board of longitude awarded him &pound;300 in 1752. Later that year, after a perfunctory testing programme, the Admiralty board ordered all ships being fitted for foreign service to be supplied with one of Knight's compasses. Navigators agreed that Knight's bars were greatly superior to natural lodestone for remagnetizing compass needles. They were initially enthusiastic about his compasses: fitting out the <i>Endeavour</i>, James Cook wrote to the Admiralty, &#145;Doctor Knight hath got an Azimuth Compass of an Improv'd con[s]truction which may prove to be of more general use than the old ones&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Journals of Captain James Cook</span>, ed. J. C. Beaglehole, 1955, 1.clxix). But experienced mariners increasingly accused Knight of designing an instrument that performed badly at sea, particularly in stormy weather. Knight constantly implemented modifications, and, in the face of increasing competition from rival compass makers, became the first to seek protection by patenting a revised model of his azimuth compass in 1766. Despite continued criticism from seafarers, Knight's compasses remained official issue for all the ships in the Royal Navy until well into the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>In 1748 Knight produced a theoretical treatise on natural philosophy, republished by John Nourse six years later, entitled <span class="italic">Two Simple Active Principles, Attraction and Repulsion</span>. Using Newton's suggestions in the <span class="italic">Opticks</span>, Knight sought to explain all natural phenomena&#151;light, heat, and gravity as well as magnetism&#151;by aethers made up of elementary attractive and repulsive particles. Knight claimed that these particles cluster round one another to build up larger corpuscles of varying size and net force, which combine to produce fluids and solids of different characteristics. For this Newtonian text he also drew on his own experiments and on continental research into metallurgy and mining. Knight's densely written book was little referred to by his contemporaries, though some Victorian scientists revived interest in his ideas. Benjamin Franklin judged Knight &#145;the greatest Master of Practical Magnetics that has appear'd in any Age&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Papers of Benjamin Franklin</span>, ed. L. W. Labaree, 1963, 6.103), but never quite found the &#145;Leisure to peruse his Writings with the Attention necessary to become Master of his Doctrine&#146;  (ibid., 1961, 4.256).<br>
<br>Knight was elected a member of the Royal Society council in 1751. He achieved an increasingly influential position in the society, though he was defeated by seventy-six votes to ninety-one when he competed with Thomas Birch for the post of secretary. For a few years, Knight was active at the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce. In 1756 he successfully applied for the post of principal librarian at the newly founded British Museum, which was largely controlled by fellows of the Royal Society. Knight remained at the museum until his death, sixteen years later. For &pound;200 a year, he acted as live-in caretaker, responsible for displaying the exhibits and supervising public access. He played a key role in the adoption of the Linnaean system of classification, and participated in international correspondence networks to enlarge the collections.<br>
<br>Knight became publicly recognized in polite society as a man of importance. Participating in &eacute;lite circles, he contributed to John Fothergill's reforming medical club and journal, and invested with him in a financially disastrous Cornish mining venture. Also close to Birch, Benjamin Wilson, Henry Baker, and John Pringle, Knight dined with influential statesmen and aristocrats, and was discussed by the king. Wilson, a schoolfriend from Leeds, portrayed him in an etching and an oil painting. Knight was increasingly reputed to be reclusive and ill-tempered, antagonizing visitors, staff, and trustees at the museum, where he very probably lived alone. Critics&#151;including Samuel Johnson and Edmund Stone&#151;deplored his marketing strategies and his secretiveness, and he became involved in a bitter priority dispute with John Canton. Knight persistently refused to divulge his magnetizing techniques, although partial accounts were published after his death. He died in his rooms in the museum on 8 June 1772, and was buried in London at either St George's, Bloomsbury, or the parochial cemetery near the Foundling Hospital.<br>
