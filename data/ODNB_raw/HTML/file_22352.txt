<span class="headword">Plant,  Thomas Livesley</span>  (1819&#150;1883), <span class="occ">commission agent and meteorologist</span>, was born at Low Moor, near Bradford, and baptized on 26 February 1820 at Wibsey, Yorkshire, the son of George Halewood Plant, iron merchant, and his wife, Ann Livesley. After schooling at St Cuthbert's College, Ushaw, near Durham, he moved in 1844 to Birmingham, where he married, on 21 June 1845, Jane Horne, the daughter of William Wallis Horne, a builder. In 1849 Plant set up an advertising system for W. H. Smith &amp; Son, which, as commission agent, he supervised until 1881, and he acted as agent for various other firms. One of his two sons followed him in this business.<br>
<br>Before arriving in Birmingham, Plant had developed an interest in meteorology, and from about 1837 he kept systematic records. As well as publishing <span class="italic">Meteorology: its Study Important for our Good</span> (1862), he read two papers at meetings of the British Association and lectured on the subject in various towns. Plant was a prolific correspondent to the local press on meteorological subjects, and contributed meteorological information to <span class="italic">The Times</span>. He also campaigned to provide Birmingham with a pure water supply, and worked to establish the post of medical officer of health for the growing town.<br>
<br>When he retired Plant and his wife moved to Devon Cottage, Alcester Road, King's Heath, near Birmingham, Worcestershire, where a niece cared for the elderly couple. It was from that station, on 31 August 1883, that he boarded the train for his usual journey into Birmingham, only to suffer a heart attack from which he had died by the time the train reached New Street Station, Birmingham. He was survived by his wife.<br>
