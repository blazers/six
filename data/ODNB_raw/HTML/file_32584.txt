<span class="headword">Couper, Sir  George Ebenezer Wilson</span>, second baronet  (1824&#150;1908), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, born at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 29 April 1824, was eldest of the six children of Sir George Couper, first baronet (1788&#150;1861)&#151;then military secretary to Nova Scotia's governor, Sir James Kempt&#151;and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1880), daughter of Sir John Wilson, judge of common pleas. The father was subsequently comptroller of the household and equerry to the duchess of Kent. The second son, Major-General James Kempt Couper (1827&#150;1901), served in the Indian Staff Corps, and the fifth son, Henry Edward (1835&#150;1876), captain of the 70th foot, saw service in the Indian mutiny of 1857.<br>
<br>In 1839, after education at Sherborne School and at Coombe, Surrey, Couper entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Passing out with distinction in 1842, he was gazetted to the 15th regiment as an ensign, but on receiving a nomination to a writership in India he went instead to East India College, Haileybury, and, at the close of 1846, joined the Bengal civil service.<br>
<br>Couper was first posted to Dinajpur in eastern Bengal as an assistant magistrate, but was transferred to the Punjab on its annexation in 1849 and, at the relatively young age of twenty-five, was made assistant commissioner at Jhelum. Thereafter his rise through the ranks was rapid, something which the satirical <span class="italic">Charivari's Album</span> of 1875 attributed in part to the charmed childhood he had spent in the duchess of Kent's household. Certainly Couper had influential friends. Lord Dalhousie, governor-general and &#145;oldest and dearest friend&#146; of his father, took a keen interest in him, and, as shown in his <span class="italic">Private Letters</span> (1910), reported frequently to his father on his progress. On 29 April 1852, while on furlough, Couper married Caroline Penelope (<i>d</i>. 1910), daughter of Henry Every of the Life Guards and his second wife, the Hon. Caroline Flower; she was granddaughter of Sir Henry Every, ninth baronet, of Eggington Hall, Burton upon Trent.<br>
<br>In 1853 Couper was transferred to Calcutta as under-secretary to the government of India, first in the home and finance department and then in the foreign department. On the annexation of Oudh in February 1856 he was appointed secretary at Lucknow to the chief commissioner, Sir James Outram, staying on to serve his successor, Sir Henry Lawrence. Through the uprising of 1857, of which Oudh was at the epicentre, Couper was with Lawrence, serving as his aide-de-camp as well as his chief secretary until the latter's death at the residency on 4 July. He continued these positions with Sir John Inglis, and finally, after the relief, with Outram again. During the siege of Lucknow, Couper put his early military training to good use and won high praise from his chiefs. He was the author, save for the mentions of himself, of Inglis's celebrated dispatch of 26 September 1857 reporting the death of Lawrence, which he later reprinted for private circulation with selections from his own speeches on the uprising, but omitting Inglis's references to himself (1896). He also wrote the text to Captain C. H. Mecham's <span class="italic">Sketches of the Siege of Lucknow</span> (1858).<br>
<br>The viceroy, Lord Canning, rejected Outram's recommendation of Couper as his successor to the chief commissionership of Oudh, on the ground that Couper had been only twelve years in the service. Instead, in April 1859, after furlough, Couper was posted to Allahabad as chief secretary to the government of the North-Western Provinces. On 18 May 1860 he was made a CB. In the following year he succeeded to his father's baronetcy and in December 1862 returned to Oudh as judicial commissioner. From April 1871 he acted as chief commissioner of the province, and was confirmed in the appointment in December 1873. In that office he presided over the revision of the land revenue assessments, pursuing the post-1857 &#145;Oudh policy&#146; and securing the position of the <i>talukdars</i> (local landed magnates), of whom he was an ardent supporter.<br>
<br>On the retirement of Sir John Strachey in July 1876, Couper was made acting lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces, while retaining his control of Oudh, thereby accomplishing the amalgamation of Oudh with the larger province. On 17 January 1877 Couper became the first &#145;lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces and chief commissioner of Oudh&#146;. After two decades of cosseting by the British the <i>talukdars</i> were deeply suspicious of the change, and it was only Couper's assiduously cultivated image as the <i>talukdars'</i> friend that enabled its smooth implementation. Couper's administration became known for its conservation of resources or, as his detractors labelled it, its parsimony. His handling of a serious famine in 1877&#150;8 invoked widespread public criticism, including a blistering assault conducted by the Anglo-Indian newspaper the <span class="italic">Statesman and Friend of India</span> on the administration's delay and meanness in establishing relief works for the starving. Couper was stung by the attacks, but stuck to his argument that economy in relief was both morally and financially sound; the tax rises necessary to fund widespread gratuitous relief for the indigent would, he believed, impoverish the independent classes in society and retard India's progress.<br>
<br>Economy notwithstanding, Couper initiated a policy of canal and light railway construction for the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, although some of the local benefits of this were lost to a subsequent ruling by the government of India that railways should not be provincial undertakings. Couper also developed the provincial agricultural department so that it became a model for other provinces; and he encouraged Indian industrial enterprises, such as the &#145;Couper&#146; paper mills at Lucknow.<br>
<br>Couper was created KCSI in January 1877, and CIE a year later. Due to retire in January 1882, he had hoped to extend his term by another year but, regardless of the appeals of the Oudh <i>talukdars</i>, Lord Ripon, the viceroy, was only prepared to offer him another three months. He therefore retired in April 1882. He declined the proposal of the Husainabad endowment trustees, Lucknow, to erect a statue in his memory, and as an alternative they built a clock tower, as a symbol of progress and order.<br>
<br>After residing at Cheltenham for a few years Couper settled at Camberley. He died on 5 March 1908, at 11 Duchess Street, Portland Place, London, and was buried in St Michael's churchyard, Camberley. Couper's wife died on 28 November 1910 and was buried beside her husband. They had five sons and four daughters; one of the latter, who lived for barely a month, was born in the Lucknow residency during the siege. The eldest son, Sir Ramsay George Henry, succeeded as third baronet.<br>
