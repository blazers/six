<span class="headword">Fitzpatrick,  William John</span>  (1830&#150;1895), <span class="occ">biographer</span>, was born at Thomas Street, Dublin, on 31 August 1830, the son of John Fitzpatrick, a successful tallow chandler. His father, whose profession gave rise to Fitzpatrick's nicknames of the Knight of Tallow and the Historian of Greece (grease), left William John an adequate income on his death. Fitzpatrick was educated first at a protestant school and later at the Jesuit-run Clongowes Wood College, co. Kildare; he was throughout life a pious Catholic. He early displayed a talent for investigative journalism, focusing in particular on the secret history of eminent persons. In 1855 he published his first book, a solid if unimaginative tome on Valentine Lawless, Lord Cloncurry, a former united Irishman and activist on behalf of Irish Catholics. <span class="italic">The Life, Times and Contemporaries of Lord Cloncurry</span> displayed to the full Fitzpatrick's Catholic nationalist sympathies, and enjoyed a modest success. From this point on his output was prolific, though very uneven in quality.<br>
<br>A series of letters to <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> in 1855, followed by a pamphlet in 1859, contending that the Waverley novels were in fact written by Sir Walter Scott's brother, Thomas, a regimental paymaster in Canada, proved a deeply unwise venture. Thomas Scott's daughters denounced the claim in a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> of 5 June 1857. In 1859 Fitzpatrick brought out <span class="italic">The Friends, Foes and Adventures of Lady Morgan</span>. Based on a series of sketches published in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, the work was marred by haste, repetition, and lack of style. A companion volume published in 1860, <span class="italic">Lady Morgan, her Career, Literary and Personal</span>, exhibited the same defects. However, his next book, a two-volume &#145;life and letters&#146; of Bishop James Doyle of Kildare and Leighlin, the famous Catholic controversialist JKL, published in 1861, was much better, and it remains essential reading both for the life and the times of that powerful personality.<br>
<br>By this date, Fitzpatrick had begun the work of investigation for which he is best known&#151;the inner or secret history of Ireland before the Union. A short piece published in 1859 and entitled <span class="italic">Lord Edward Fitzgerald, or, Notes on the Cornwallis Papers</span> was followed by <span class="italic">The Sham Squire and the Informers of 1798</span> (1866), which went through many editions and reprints. The key questions addressed in these works were firstly, the identity of the person who &#145;set&#146; (that is, informed on the whereabouts of) the leading united Irishman, Lord Edward Fitzgerald, thus leading to his arrest (during which he was mortally wounded), and secondly, the role of the numerous spies and informers in the pay of Dublin Castle in the years 1798&#150;1800. These works are characterized by maddening repetition and infuriating digressions, but they also contain much of interest. Later books included <span class="italic">The Life and Times of Dr Lanigan</span> (1873), a <span class="italic">Life of Charles Lever</span> (1879), and <span class="italic">The Life of Father Tom Burke</span> (1885), but these were uneven in quality and perhaps only his study of Father Burke, James Anthony Froude's polemical opponent, is still cited.<br>
<br>In 1888, Fitzpatrick published an important edition of the correspondence of Daniel O'Connell, a work of learning and scholarship. Gladstone reviewed it in the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span> (30.149), claiming that the author had shown O'Connell to the English public &#145;as a great and good man&#146;. <span class="italic">The Correspondence of Daniel O'Connell with his Life and Times</span> also won Fitzpatrick recognition in Rome: he received from Pope Leo XIII the insignia of the order of St Gregory the Great.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Correspondence</span> was followed in 1892 by another equally valuable work, <span class="italic">Secret Service under Pitt</span>. Fitzpatrick had been granted access to the relevant Irish state papers for the 1790s, he had worked assiduously among them, and the book, admired by W. E. H. Lecky, confirmed and expanded with incontrovertible documentary evidence the suggestions first advanced in <span class="italic">The Sham Squire</span>. It established that it was the Catholic barrister, Francis Magan, reporting to his controller, the &#145;sham squire&#146;, Francis Higgins, who had &#145;set&#146; Lord Edward Fitzgerald for a fee of &pound;1000, and other inducements. Fitzpatrick's works on the 1790s sold over 16,000 copies and were much in favour with the burgeoning Catholic middle classes in late nineteenth-century Ireland. It may be added that Fitzpatrick's expos&eacute; of the informers in the united Irish conspiracy chimed well with contemporary denunciations of the Fenian movement by the Irish Catholic hierarchy, and that his revelations concerning the sordid side of the negotiations surrounding the Union influenced W. E. Gladstone's attitude towards that event.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Secret Service under Pitt</span> was Fitzpatrick's last important work. In 1895, shortly before his death, he published a study (later forgotten) of the Irish wit, Father James Healy (equally forgotten); a book on Archbishop Murray, the early nineteenth-century Catholic prelate of Dublin was left in draft form; and a <span class="italic">History of the Dublin Cemeteries</span> was completed by his son after Fitzpatrick's death and published by the Catholic cemeteries committee in 1900.<br>
<br>Fitzpatrick was long actively interested in the work of the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Dublin Society. In 1876 he was appointed honorary professor of history at the Royal Hibernian Academy of Arts. He was also accorded the honorary degree of LLD by the Royal University of Ireland. He served twice as high sheriff for co. Longford and as JP for co. Kildare and co. Dublin.<br>
<br>Fitzpatrick was married and had a family of at least two daughters and one son: but he kept his private life resolutely private. He died at his home, 49 Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin, on Christmas eve, 24 December 1895, after a short illness. Fitzpatrick's labours in his special field of study&#151;the secret history of the 1790s&#151;and his editions of JKL's and O'Connell's correspondence constitute a serious addition to historical knowledge. He was no stylist, and haste and repetition mar all his works but he was a popularizer; and his books did sell. Judged solely on sales, William John Fitzpatrick was among the most successful Irish writers of the nineteenth century.<br>
