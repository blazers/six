<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fiennes,  Gregory</span>, tenth Baron Dacre  (1539&#150;1594), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9414/', "Thomas Fiennes, ninth Baron Dacre (b. in or before 1516, d. 1541)")</script>, nobleman and murderer, and Mary (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1576), daughter of George Neville, Baron Bergavenny. He was baptized at Hurstmonceux, Sussex, on 25 June 1539. Following the execution of his father in 1541 the wardship of his elder brother Thomas Fiennes was acquired by Thomas Darcy, Baron Darcy of Chiche, lord chamberlain to Edward VI. His brother died in August 1553 and Gregory Fiennes's wardship was subsequently awarded to his mother and her third husband, Francis Thursby, esquire, of Congham, Norfolk. He and his sister Margaret were restored by act of parliament in 1558, he becoming tenth Baron Dacre, by which time he had married Anne Sackville [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9409/', "Fiennes, Anne (d. 1595)")</script>], daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24447/', "Sir Richard Sackville")</script>, whose substantial endowment helped to restore Dacre's depleted fortunes. Their only known child died before reaching adulthood. Dacre was summoned to parliament in January 1563.<br>
<br>According to William Camden, Dacre was &#145;a little crack-brained&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), and he certainly appears to have been a weaker character than his mother, sister, and wife. Despite the lack of an heir and differences in character, both husband and wife attested to the happiness of the marriage. Dacre does not appear to have played any active role in political life, although he and his wife had close associations with the court. He was interested in fine buildings. According to John Stow (who called him Gyles) he purchased and rebuilt Stourton House in Westminster, which provided his wife and him with a convenient London residence. Dacre also acquired Thomas More's house in Chelsea, Middlesex, from John Paulet, second marquess of Winchester, his wife's stepfather, for &pound;3000 in 1575. He played a ceremonial role in the entourage accompanying Edward Fiennes de Clinton, earl of Lincoln, to France to ratify the confederacy of Blois in 1572. His wife complained that she and her husband were kept in subjection by his mother, and there was undoubtedly tension caused by the attempts of the dowager baroness and his sister to prevent the alienation of Dacre lands. The latter two may have been anxious to prevent the diminution of the estates, especially as Margaret was heir.<br>
<br>In his will Dacre wrote of the &#145;hard measure&#146; likely to be offered to his wife after his death by his heirs, which the document was designed to prevent. This will, written in November 1586, left all his lands not subject to an entail and all his personal property to his wife, who was made his executor. It appears to embody the success of his wife in supplanting the influence of her in-laws. Dacre died on 25 September 1594 at the house at Chelsea and was buried in the Old Church there. His title and entailed estates were successfully claimed by his sister Margaret, who had married Sampson Lennard, esquire, of Chevening, Kent.<br>
