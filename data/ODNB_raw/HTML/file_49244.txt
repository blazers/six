<span class="headword">McNeill,  (Florence) Marian</span>  (1885&#150;1973), <span class="occ">folklorist</span>, was born on 26 March 1885 at Holm, Orkney, the third of four children of Daniel McNeill (1839&#150;1918), a minister of the Free Church of Scotland, and his wife, Jessie Janet Dewar. She received her formal education in Orkney where among her schoolfriends she numbered the future poet and critic Edwin Muir. Marian McNeill graduated MA from Glasgow University in 1912. Before her graduation she travelled in Europe, working as an <i>assistante anglaise</i> at the Lyc&eacute;e des Jeunes Filles, Marseilles (1910&#150;11), and then at the Kottbus H&ouml;here M&auml;dchenschule in Germany.<br>
<br>On her return to Scotland in 1912, Marian McNeill was appointed organizer of the Scottish Federation of Women's Suffrage Societies, and in the following year became secretary of the Association for Moral and Social Hygiene, which had been founded in 1870 by Josephine Butler. After the First World War she returned abroad, working as a private teacher of English in Athens (1919&#150;20), during which time she regularly attended social gatherings and poetry readings at the home of the famous Greek poet Angelos Sikelianos. She went back to Scotland to become a freelance journalist and writer. Her first book <span class="italic">Iona: a History of the Island</span> was published in 1920 and enjoyed considerable popularity, reaching a seventh edition in 1991.<br>
<br>During the 1920s and 1930s Marian McNeill came into regular contact with many leading figures of the Scottish literary renaissance. In 1932 she founded the Clan McNeill Association of Scotland. She also involved herself closely with the politics of Scottish self-government, becoming vice-president of the Scottish National Party. Journalistic contributions to a host of publications including <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>, and <span class="italic">Scottish Field</span> provided her with a regular income. In 1929 she joined the staff of the Scottish National Dictionary Association, as a researcher based in Aberdeen. In that year also her reputation as an authority on Scottish culinary matters became established with the publication of her <span class="italic">The Scots Kitchen: its Traditions and Lore with Old-Time Recipes</span>. It was the first of several works on Scottish food, which included <span class="italic">The Book of Breakfasts</span> (1932), <span class="italic">Recommended Recipes</span> (1948), and <span class="italic">The Scots Cellar: its Traditions and Lore</span> (1956). <span class="italic">The Scots Kitchen</span> is an important work, &#145;full of good scholarship, good wit in its application, and is an excellent and comprehensive survey of the theory and practice of cookery in a country that has always been a responsive friend to France&#146;  (<span class="italic">TLS</span>, 27 June 1929).<br>
<br>A thinly disguised autobiographical novel, <span class="italic">The Road Home</span>, appeared in 1932; it was to be Marian McNeill's only venture into fiction. In 1957 however she produced the first volume of her <i>magnum opus</i>, <span class="italic">The Silver Bough: a Four Volume Study of the National and Local Festivals of Scotland</span>. The first volume covered Scottish folklore and folk beliefs, and the second and third volumes provided a calendar of Scottish national festivals. The first volume in particular became a standard work, although there were initial critical misgivings in academic circles. In 1962, for example, the reviewer for the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> observed of volume 3 that:<blockquote>although sound enough where it describes what is generally known and traditional, [it] inspires less confidence when the alleged origins are given, and the sources from which Miss McNeill derives her information on this score are not made altogether clear, nor does her bibliography assist her. (<span class="italic">TLS</span>, 5 Oct 1962)</blockquote>McNeill was quick to defend her position in a lengthy reply, claiming the work was based on &#145;living lore acquired, or more correctly imbibed in my childhood in my native Orkneys&#146;. The final volume of <span class="italic">The Silver Bough</span> (1968) covered the local festivals of Scotland; reviewers once more attacked McNeill's methods and historical accuracy. But Marian McNeill was held in high regard by the Scottish literary establishment, and in the late summer of 1968 the Arts Council for Scotland gave a party for her and the poet Helen B. Cruickshank, both authors being &#145;in their ninth decade&#146;. In 1962 she had been appointed MBE in the new year honours list. Undeterred by her critics Marian McNeill continued to write about Scottish food, publishing in 1971 a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Highland Cookery</span> in which she continued to extol the virtues of the Scottish larder. Marian McNeill died at her Edinburgh home, 31 St Albans Road, on 22 February 1973 at the age of eighty-seven.<br>
