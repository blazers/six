<span class="headword">Ford, Sir  Edward William Spencer</span>  (1910&#150;2006), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was born on 24 July 1910 at The Hall, Repton, Derbyshire, the son of Lionel George Bridges Justice Ford (1865&#150;1932), headmaster of Repton School, later headmaster of Harrow School and dean of York, and his wife, Mary Catherine, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36409/', "Edward Stuart Talbot")</script>, bishop of Winchester. The cricket writer William Justice Ford was his uncle. Ford was the fourth (twin) son. There were also two daughters. His twin, Christopher, was killed at Anzio in January 1944, while serving as a major in the Grenadier Guards.<br>
<br>Ford was educated at Eton College as a king's scholar and excelled at sport. (For many years he was the oldest surviving member of an Eton or Harrow Lord's cricket team, and cricket remained an abiding pleasure to him all his life.) From Eton he moved on to New College, Oxford (where he was an open scholar). He took a first in classical moderations in 1931 and a second in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1933. He was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1937. His already burgeoning reputation as a counsellor was at that time being tested during a brief appointment as private tutor to the young King Farouk of Egypt, where it seems that his wise words may have fallen on deafer ears than at other stages of his life. He practised at the bar until 1939 then served throughout the Second World War in the Grenadier Guards. He was mentioned in dispatches twice, seeing action at Dunkirk and in north Africa, Italy, and Belgium.<br>
<br>In 1945, while instructing at the Staff College in Haifa, Ford was invited to join the three-strong team of private secretaries in King George VI's household at Buckingham Palace. He accepted with alacrity and worked happily for two sovereigns, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II, throughout the ensuing twenty-two years as assistant private secretary, with first Sir Alan Lascelles and then Sir Michael Adeane as principals. Ford's mixture of wisdom, humour, knowledge, and self-effacement fitted him ideally for the task, and he was a popular and jovial member of the royal household, known by many as the Pasha. On 1 December 1949 he married Virginia Polk (1918&#150;1995), elder daughter of the leading banker <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32044/', "Robert Henry Brand, Baron Brand")</script>, and widow of John Metcalfe (Jack) Polk, of the family of the American president of that name. Virginia was a niece of Nancy Astor. Ford's marriage, an exceptionally happy one, was based from 1963 to 1982 at Virginia's Palladian house, Eydon Hall, in Northamptonshire, which she inherited from her father. Virginia had already had two sons with Jack Polk, and was mother to two more with Ford.<br>
<br>In 1967 came the other, besides his marriage, defining moment of Ford's life. Adeane was due to retire in 1972, and the private secretarial succession was complicated by the two contenders, Ford and Charteris, being close in age. Ford, typically, made way for Charteris. This caused him much sadness, but it was done with the good grace, good humour, and dignity that were variously his hallmarks. The move though, was not the end of his connection with the queen. He remained until the end of his life her valued correspondent (in one of his letters he coined the phrase &#145;annus horribilis&#146;, later used by her to describe the events of 1992, a poor year for the royal family's fortunes), adviser, and friend. And he retained, together with some vivid memories, a lifelong admiration for the queen and the duke of Edinburgh. In this respect his guardianship of the Order of Merit from 1975, as secretary and registrar, was impeccable. His notes on candidates, successful and otherwise, made good reading and reflected the extraordinary breadth of his knowledge on matters cultural and scientific, to name but two, which was the envy of his many friends. He was also, at various times, high sheriff and a deputy lieutenant of Northamptonshire, secretary of the Pilgrims Trust (1967&#150;75), and, to his delight, prime warden of the Goldsmiths' Company in 1979. He had been made an MVO in 1949 and CB in 1952, knighted KCVO in 1957 and advanced to KCB in 1967, and in 1998 he was made GCVO.<br>
<br>Virginia predeceased him, after a long illness, in 1995 but Ford, who had devotedly cared for her, recovered from this blow and continued to make energetic forays from his base in Little Venice into London society, country houses, family occasions, and, even in his nineties, homes abroad where he was entertained by the great and good. When asked how he entered one hostess's swimming pool in his exceedingly old age, he replied &#145;I always dive&#146;. Such was the man that his interlocutor was not surprised. He died, still entirely in control of his faculties, of a heart attack at his home, 23 Blomfield Road, Westminster, on 19 November 2006, and was survived by his two sons and a stepson, one stepson having predeceased him. The queen and the duke of Edinburgh were among those who filled the Guards' Chapel, Wellington Barracks, London for a memorial service on 28 February 2007.<br>
