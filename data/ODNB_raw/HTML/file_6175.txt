<span class="headword">Cooke,  Robert</span>  (1549/50&#150;1615), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the son of William Gayle, also known as Cooke, of Beeston, Leeds, where he was baptized on 23 July 1550. (The name Cooke seems to have originated from the employment of generations of the Gayle family.) After attending Leeds grammar school, he matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford, on 5 April 1567, aged seventeen, graduated BA on 27 June 1573, and was unanimously elected as a probationer fellow on 2 December that year. Appointed proctor in 1582, he carried out his duties conscientiously. A speech given on 10 April 1583 on his resignation vividly described the state of the university and the difficulties and animosity Cooke had encountered as proctor. Apparently he was not too discouraged. He proceeded BTh in 1584 and was appointed college bursar shortly afterwards.<br>
<br>Highly respected for his learning and skill in debate, Cooke seemed set for a long university career. But in June 1590 he resigned his fellowship and on 18 December was instituted vicar of Leeds on the presentation of the parishioners. He succeeded the aged Alexander Fawcett, who may have had popish sympathies and seems not to have been a preaching minister. Cooke's arrival signalled more than a routine change in personnel. Since 1570 protestant sympathies had been gradually gaining ground. The energetic town merchants were seeking to further the town's economic, political, and religious development, and with the aid of Henry Hastings, third earl of Huntingdon, who negotiated a reduction in price, they were able to secure the advowson in 1588. Cooke's uncle, Ralph Cooke, was a leading figure in Leeds, but his appointment shortly afterwards may also have reflected the earl's influence. In his new position, ironically, Cooke found himself in a dispute with Christ Church, Oxford, over property in the town, to which both the parish church and the college had claims. The matter was resolved in 1596 by Matthew Hutton, archbishop of York.<br>
<br>Cooke's brand of puritan piety seems to have agreed well with the hopes of many of his influential parishioners; there is evidence from wills of the affection and respect in which they held him. He also found it necessary to arrange for the construction of galleries in the church, but these proved inadequate to accommodate the growing numbers of townspeople who attended Sunday services. Cooke also became a trustee of Wakefield grammar school.<br>
<br>Cooke was a zealous opponent of Catholicism; his <span class="italic">Censura quorundam scriptorum</span> (1614), dedicated to William James, bishop of Durham, strove &#145;to detect the numerous forgeries and unauthorized insertions made by Roman Catholic editors or transcribers in the works of the Fathers&#146;  (Taylor, 77). A manuscript once in the Leeds museum of Ralph Thoresby contained &#145;A learned disputation between Robert Cooke, B.D., and Cuthbert Johnson, alias William Darrell, before his majesty's council, and other learned men at York, an 1610&#146;. Latterly Cooke was assisted by a curate, his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6154/', "Alexander Cooke")</script>, a militant puritan who would succeed him as vicar. On 20 July 1614 he was collated by Bishop James to the sixth prebend of Durham Cathedral. Robert Cooke died in Leeds on 1 January 1615, and was buried at Leeds parish church the following day.<br>
