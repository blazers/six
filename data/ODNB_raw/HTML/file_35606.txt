<span class="headword">Prendergast, Sir  Harry North Dalrymple</span>  (1834&#150;1913), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22716/', "Thomas Prendergast (1807/8&#150;1886)")</script> of the Madras civil service, and his wife, Lucy Caroline Dalrymple, was born in India on 15 October 1834. On their mother's death in 1839, Harry and his brother Hew were sent to Brighton to live with their grandfather, Major-General Sir Jeffrey Prendergast, Madras army. Educated at Cheam School and at Brighton College, Harry followed Hew to Addiscombe College and Chatham. He obtained a commission in the Madras engineers in 1854.<br>
<br>Prendergast took part in the Anglo-Persian War (1857), and in the Indian mutiny served with the Malwa and Central Indian field forces. During the battle of Mandasor (21 November 1857) he saved the life of Lieutenant Dew, and was severely wounded. For this and for heroism at Bhima and Betwa he received the Victoria Cross. Aide-de-camp to Sir Hugh Henry Rose, Prendergast saw constant action until, perilously wounded a second time, he was invalided home in April 1858. Thereafter, his left arm was virtually useless, not that that stopped him volunteering (unsuccessfully) for the Austrian army in 1859 to fight the Italians or for the Second Opium War in 1860: &#145;I can play cricket so I can fight&#146;, he protested. In 1867 he was, however, appointed field engineer to the Abyssinian expedition, saw action at Magdala, and, mentioned by the commander-in-chief as having rendered singularly valuable assistance, was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel. Prendergast had married at Bangalore on 11 October 1864 Emilie Rachel Simpson. They had five children; their daughter Ella married Sir Harry Aubrey de Vere Maclean.<br>
<br>In 1878 Prendergast led the Indian sappers sent to Malta and Cyprus at the time of the congress of Berlin. Then followed a series of posts and commands: military secretary, Madras (1878&#150;80), the Western Districts (1880&#150;81), the Ceded Districts (1881&#150;2), quartermaster-general, Madras (1882&#150;3), the British Burma division (1883&#150;4), and the Hyderabad subsidiary force (1884&#150;5). Emphasis on musketry, mapmaking, and manoeuvres showed Prendergast a modern major-general and explain his eyebrow-raising selection in October 1885 to lead the Burma field force; no Madras officer had been entrusted with field command since 1857. Equally unusual were his instructions from the viceroy, Lord Dufferin, to take the capital and dethrone King Thibaw &#145;rather by the display than the use of force&#146;. Prendergast had to overcome modern blockhouses guarding the Irrawaddy and reach Mandalay before the Burmese could block the river. Fierce fighting at Minhla (17 November) showed that, outmatched in everything but courage, Burma intended to fight. But the Third Anglo-Burmese War, the most audacious example of forward policy in India, was launched so rapidly that Prendergast seized every vantage point first. Unconditional surrender was offered on 27 November, Mandalay occupied on the 29th and the royal family deported that night.<br>
<br>Prendergast was showered with congratulations and created KCB, but annexation (1 January 1886) provoked extensive insurgence. With a 9000-man force, Prendergast was suddenly expected to conquer a kingdom the size of France, with no cavalry, no mules, and no reinforcements. War correspondents gleefully attacked military inadequacies and ruined several reputations, Prendergast's included. Although promoted lieutenant-general (1886) and general (1887), he remained unemployed from April 1886. Through the kindnesses of friends, he filled in as acting resident in Travancore, Mysore, Baroda, and Baluchistan. Relegated to the supernumerary list, however, he quit India in 1892, aged only fifty-seven.<br>
<br>While Prendergast supported campaigns for imperial conscription and cadet corps in schools, bitterness proved preferable to boredom. Many saw his GCB (1902) as the army making amends; 1908 saw him appointed colonel commandant, Royal Engineers. But he would never be commander-in-chief in India, as some had once hoped. This self-effacing soldier died of pneumonia, at his residence, 2 Heron Court, Richmond, Surrey, on 24 July 1913 and was buried four days later at Richmond cemetery.<br>
