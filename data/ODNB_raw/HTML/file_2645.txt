<span class="headword">Blewitt,  (John) Octavian</span>  (1810&#150;1884), <span class="occ">writer and literary administrator</span>, was born on 3 October 1810 at St Helen's Place, Bishopsgate, London, the son of John Edwards Blewitt (<i>d</i>. 1860), merchant, and Caroline, daughter of Peter Symons, mayor of Plymouth. Much of his childhood was spent in Cornwall at Marazion House, the home of his great-uncle Hannibal Curnow Blewitt. He was educated at Plymouth grammar school, and then pursued a medical career, spending his five-year apprenticeship partly with his uncle Mr Dryden, assistant surgeon of the Devonport Dockyard, and partly with Mr Pollard of Torquay. He went to London in 1833 to continue his medical studies at St George's Infirmary, Hanover Square, but never qualified. After spending some time in tutoring Sir James Clark's son in classics he went with a patient to Madeira, staying at Funchal for eight months, and subsequently travelling in Egypt, Greece, Turkey, and other countries. In the latter part of 1837 and early 1838 he resided in Italy, an experience he put to good use writing two works in Murray's <span class="roman">Handbooks for Travellers</span> series, one about central Italy published in 1843, and the second, which came out a decade later, about southern Italy. He married Anne Roper Howard (<i>b</i>. 1811), a widow, daughter of David Edward Williams, on 12 September 1846 in London.<br>
<br>After repeated petitions Blewitt was elected in 1839 secretary of the Royal Literary Fund, a post he held until his death. It was the most influential position on the committee and through it he became an adviser to the governors of Charterhouse School. More significantly, the appointment meant that he was consulted by Gladstone and other prime ministers on civil-list pensions, and for forty-five years he was under-secretary for literary patronage. His staunch Anglicanism&#151;he wrote <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Happiness Arising from the Exercise of the Christian Faith</span> at the age of twenty-two&#151;was reflected in his stern moral attitude to applicants to the fund. During his term of office beneficiaries had to be of known good character, and no grant was given to an author's widow without the production of a marriage certificate. However, he was a kindly man, and he and his wife would occasionally receive and aid impoverished authors at their own door.<br>
<br>Blewitt's secretaryship came at a crucial time for the Royal Literary Fund, which had been criticized for its methods of accounting for and distributing its funds. He gained a reputation for diligence in the fund's affairs, keeping good accounts and careful records, and he recognized the importance of the fund's archives, spending many years getting them into good order. Yet he was dogged in his defence of the fund's ways which forced authors to write begging letters for meagre grants, and he refused to accept the case for reform put by Charles Dickens and Charles Wentworth Dilke between 1852 and 1858.<br>
<br>Probably the most influential of Blewitt's contributions to periodical magazines was an anonymous article in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> in April 1871 about the revision of the pension list. However, he was a regular contributor to many other periodicals, and for twenty-nine years edited the news section of <span class="italic">Gardiner's Chronicle</span>. He was a FRGS (1839) and was created knight of the order of Leopold by the king of the Belgians, who was a guest at the annual fund-raising dinner in 1872. Octavian Blewitt died on 4 November 1884 at his home, 133 Elgin Crescent, London, and was buried in Paddington cemetery on the 11th.<br>
