<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Higgins,  Matthew James</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Jacob Omnium]</span>  (1810&#150;1868), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, the youngest child and only son of Matthew Higgins and Janette, daughter of James Baillie, second son of Hugh Baillie of Dochfour, Inverness-shire, was born on 4 December 1810, at Benown Castle in co. Meath. His father died soon after his birth and he was reared by his mother. He was educated at a private school near Bath and at Eton College. On 22 May 1828 he matriculated from New College, Oxford, but never graduated. At college he preferred hunting to study. He afterwards travelled much in Spain and in Italy, where his three sisters lived in Naples, after their marriage to Italians. In 1838&#150;9 he visited British Guiana, where he had inherited an estate, and repeated the visit in 1846&#150;7. This experience enabled him to keep his estate in good order during the critical period which followed the abolition of slavery, and to write four effective pamphlets upon the difficulties of the sugar-producing colonies in 1847 and 1849. His first publication, however, was &#145;Jacob Omnium, the Merchant Prince&#146;, an amusing satire on mercantile dishonesty published in <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span> (August 1845). Jacob Omnium quickly became a popular public figure and Higgins's best-known <i>nom de plume</i>. W. M. Thackeray contributed to the same number; the men met, when both enquired about the other's <i>nom de plume</i>, and became close friends. Thackeray's ballad &#145;Jacob Omnium's Hoss&#146; (<span class="italic">Punch</span>, 15, 251) celebrated an episode in which Higgins was involved which led to the end of the Star Chamber; the ballad effectively caught Higgins's formidable powers as a controversialist:<blockquote>
<div>His name is Jacob Homnium, Exquire;<br>
</div>
<div>And if I'd committed crimes,<br>
</div>
<div>Good Lord! I wouldn't ave that mann<br>
</div>
<div>Attack me in the <span class="italic">Times</span>.<br>
</div> (G. N. Ray, <span class="italic">Thackeray: the Age of Wisdom</span>, 1958, 46)</blockquote>In 1847 Higgins was in Ireland assisting the famine relief committee; Jacob Omnium's long letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> (22 April 1847; reprinted in Higgins's <span class="italic">Essays on Social Subjects</span>) excoriated idle landowners, both Irish and English. Higgins followed Peel into free trade and stood as a Peelite at Westbury in 1847, being defeated by James Wilson. He never again contested a seat, but he aided the Peelites by writing for their paper, the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, until it folded in 1854, and he often attended the Commons; with J. R. Godley he was especially active in attacking whig colonial policy.<br>
<br>Higgins also wrote frequently for <span class="italic">The Times</span> under a variety of pseudonyms, including Jacob Omnium, Civilian, Paterfamilias, West Londoner, Belgravian Mother, Mother of Six, and John Barleycorn. Higgins was an amusing writer with a hard and quite radical edge. Comfortably off, he wrote because he liked to write. On 2 July 1850 his income increased when he married Emily Blanche, daughter of Sir Henry Joseph Tichborne of Tichborne and widow of the eldest son of Mr Bennett of Pythouse, Wiltshire (which house the family for a time also gained). The Higginses moved from 1 Lowndes Square to 71 Eaton Square, London. They had four children, one of whom died in infancy. Higgins was in every sense a prominent social figure (he was 6 feet 8 inches, too tall even to join the Life Guards), well known for his writing since his <i>noms de plume</i> were mostly flags rather than disguises, and a member of many metropolitan clubs and societies, including the Philobiblon Society and the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95111', "Cosmopolitan Club")</script>. He bought both pictures and horses as an expert. He wrote effectively on administrative reform and on reform of the army, especially with respect to military education and the purchase of commissions, being an early champion of the abolition of that practice (1857). He also wrote for the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, and for the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span> during Thackeray's editorship.<br>
<br>In 1863 Higgins quarrelled with <span class="italic">The Times</span> when the paper dropped the line of attack which, with Higgins, it had hitherto pursued against Lieutenant-Colonel Crawley during the latter's court martial for his treatment of Sergeant-Major Lilley and his wife in India; Higgins's correspondence about the rupture was published privately, as a pamphlet. Subsequently Higgins wrote for the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, developing the genre of chatty titbits. His family interest also made him active in attacking the Tichborne claimant. A &#145;man of noble and amiable presence&#146;  (Leslie Stephen in <span class="italic">DNB</span>), Higgins was an important figure in London literary society in the 1850s and 1860s, &#145;the author of not a few reconciliations&#146;  (Stirling Maxwell, lxix). His health suffered some decline and he took the waters at Homburg. He was taken ill after bathing at Kingston House, near Abingdon, Berkshire, and died there six days later on 14 August 1868. Survived by his wife and three children, he was buried near his younger son in the Roman Catholic cemetery in Fulham. His <span class="italic">Essays on Social Subjects</span> was first published privately in 1856, and published in 1875 with a memoir by Sir William Stirling Maxwell.<br>
