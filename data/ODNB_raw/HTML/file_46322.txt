<span class="headword">Jones,  David Martyn  Lloyd-</span>  (1899&#150;1981), <span class="occ">Calvinistic Methodist minister</span>, was born on 20 December 1899 in the family home at Donald Street, Cardiff, the second of three sons of Henry Lloyd-Jones (<i>d</i>. 1922) and his wife, Magdalene Evans (1872&#150;1951). The family owned a shop and milk-round business first at Llangeitho, Cardiganshire, then in August 1914 at Regency Street, London.<br>
<br>Lloyd-Jones won a scholarship in 1911 to Tregaron county school, from there gaining a place in January 1915 at Marylebone grammar school. He became a medical student at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, in October 1916. At Bart's he received his MRCS and LRCP in July 1921, later gaining his MB and BS (with distinctions) and MD. In October 1921 Lloyd-Jones was selected by Sir Thomas Horder, physician to the royal family, as his junior house physician.<br>
<br>While fulfilling his duties at Harley Street, Lloyd-Jones saw the emptiness of the world around him. At some point in 1923&#150;4 he was converted to Christianity and decided to enter the Christian ministry. As he told Sir Thomas Horder, who tried to dissuade him, &#145;when you and I as doctors have done all that we can do for our patients, they still have to die. I am going to deal with that part of a man that never dies&#146;  (Harrison, 98).<br>
<br>Lloyd-Jones formally accepted a call to Bethlehem Calvinistic Methodist Chapel, Sandfields, Aberafan, south Wales, on 22 December 1926, and on 8 January 1927 married another physician, Bethan Phillips (1898&#150;1991). They had two daughters.<br>
<br>Until July 1938 Lloyd-Jones ministered successfully in Aberafan. He preached from the <span class="roman">Bible</span> emphasizing the great Reformation themes of God's person, man's sin, God's free salvation, justification by faith alone, and the sufficiency of scripture. The church was soon full, and he preached to packed churches wherever he went. With his clear expository preaching style he was much sought after.<br>
<br>In 1938 Lloyd-Jones became colleague and then assistant to G. Campbell Morgan at Westminster Chapel, London. The war years were difficult, and the congregation dwindled to 200. As sole pastor in 1943 Lloyd-Jones began to build on the work. By the mid-1950s 2000 churchgoers regularly attended his ministry and were enthralled by his biblical message. The historian G. M. Trevelyan, after hearing Lloyd-Jones preach on &#145;the limit of man's knowledge and the power of Christ&#146;, congratulated him saying, &#145;Sir, it has been given to you to speak with great power&#146;  (Dudley-Smith, 68). Emil Brunner, the Swiss reformed theologian, called him &#145;the greatest preacher in Christendom today&#146;. His ministry at Westminster Chapel continued until he retired due to ill health in 1968.<br>
<br>Lloyd-Jones had three preaching styles: teaching for believers (morning services), evangelistic (evening services), and doctrinal (Friday night meetings). Like Charles Spurgeon before him, Lloyd-Jones's written sermons sold in their thousands, the most significant being his mammoth expository series on <span class="roman">Romans</span> and <span class="roman">Ephesians</span> and the sermon on the mount.<br>
<br>Lloyd-Jones was influential in reformed evangelical circles, playing an important role in a number of organizations: these included the Inter-Varsity Fellowship, the Leicester Ministers Conference, the Evangelical Library, the Evangelical Movement of Wales, the London Bible College, and also the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students. In later years Lloyd-Jones was no stranger to controversy, proposing in 1966, for example, that evangelical churches should leave their denominations, and his Westminster Chapel seceded from the Congregational Union.<br>
<br>In later years Lloyd-Jones remained active: preaching, editing his sermons, and advising ministers on practical and doctrinal matters. He died peacefully in his sleep on 1 March 1981 in Ealing, London, and was buried on Friday 6 March in the Cardiganshire town of Newcastle Emlyn.<br>
