<span class="headword">Shee, Sir  William</span>  (1804&#150;1868), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in Finchley, Middlesex, on 24 June 1804, the eldest son of Joseph Shee, a merchant of Thomastown, co. Kilkenny, and Laurence Pountney Place in the City of London, and his wife, Teresa, daughter of John Darell of Scotney Castle, Kent. He was educated at a French school in Somers Town run by Abb&eacute; Carron, an associate of the religious and political writer F&eacute;licit&eacute; Robert de Lamennais. In 1818 he went to St Cuthbert's College, Ushaw, near Durham, where his cousin Nicholas Wiseman (afterwards the first cardinal archbishop of the restored English Catholic hierarchy) was a student. Later he also attended lectures at the University of Edinburgh, and became a member of the discussion group known as the Speculative Society. On 31 May 1823 he became a student at Lincoln's Inn, where he studied law in the chambers of Thomas Chitty, a well-known special pleader and legal writer. He was called to the bar on 19 June 1828.<br>
<br>Shee gradually built up an extensive legal practice and worked on the Maidstone sessions, becoming serjeant-at-law on 19 February 1840. He received a patent of precedence in Trinity vacation 1845, and was appointed queen's serjeant in 1857. On 26 December 1837 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1861), second daughter of Sir James Gordon, bt, of Gordonstown and Letterfourie, Banffshire. They had several children, including <a href="#cosubject_25283">George Darell Shee [<i>see below</i>]</a> and Henry Gordon Shee QC, recorder of Burnley and judge of the Salford Hundred court of record.<br>
<br>Shee was a moderate and consistent Liberal throughout his life. Soon after his call to the bar he spoke eloquently in favour of Catholic emancipation at a great protestant gathering which was held on Pennenden Heath, near Maidstone, on 24 November 1828. At the general election of July 1847 he stood unsuccessfully for parliament for Marylebone. In July 1852, however, he entered the House of Commons for co. Kilkenny, which he represented until parliament was dissolved in March 1857. Shee spoke for the first time on 12 November 1852, during the debate on the report on the address  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 123, 1852, 139&#150;41). In the absence of the Irish land reformer and radical politician William Sharman Crawford, Shee took charge of the <span class="roman">Tenant Right Bill</span>, which he reintroduced on 25 November 1852. On 7 December he made a long speech on Sir Joseph Napier's <span class="roman">Tenants' Improvement Compensation Bill</span>. On the same day the <span class="roman">Tenant Right Bill</span> was read a second time, but it was subsequently condemned by the select committee, to which it and Napier's scheme of Irish land reform had been referred. On 16 February 1854 Shee brought in a bill which, with the exception of three clauses, was the exact counterpart of Sharman Crawford's bill of the previous session, but it met with little encouragement. On 13 June 1854 he moved for leave to bring in a bill to amend the laws relating to the temporalities of the Church of Ireland, and to increase the funds for religious education and church buildings in Ireland. This motion was rejected, however, after a debate of three nights, by a majority of eighty-six votes. Convinced of the impossibility of carrying Sharman Crawford's bill through parliament, and with his blessing, on 20 February 1855 Shee brought in a <span class="roman">Tenants' Improvement Compensation Bill</span>, founded on two of Napier's bills as amended by the select committee of 1853. This bill was equally unpopular, however, and was eventually dropped. Because he was seen to have abandoned Sharman Crawford's measure, Shee lost his seat as MP for Kilkenny in the general election in April 1857, and was again defeated there at the general election in May 1859. In 1860 he refused the offer of the chief-justiceship of Madras and in September 1862 was nominated as a candidate at the by-election for Stoke-on-Trent, but received only thirty-two votes.<br>
<br>Shee was an earnest and conscientious advocate, and an able, if occasionally ponderous, speaker. His breadth of legal knowledge and common-sense approach won the approval of his fellow lawyers and he acted as counsel in many famous trials of the day, such as the <i>Roupell case</i>. He conducted the defence of William Palmer (1824&#150;1856) and was criticized for saying in his speech that he believed Palmer to be innocent.<br>
<br>On 19 December 1863 Shee was appointed by Lord Westbury a justice of the court of queen's bench in the place of Sir William Wightman, and on 10 June 1864 he was knighted  (<span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, 22 Dec 1863, 6645; <span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, 14 June 1864, 3072). He was the first Roman Catholic to be promoted to the English bench since the revolution of 1688.<br>
<br>Shee edited several editions of Lord Tenterden's <span class="italic">Treatise of the Law Relative to Merchant Ships and Seamen</span> and Samuel Marshall's <span class="italic">Treatise on the Law of Insurance</span>. He also wrote <span class="italic">Reflections on the Trial of the Prince de Polignac</span> (1836), <span class="italic">The Act for the more effectual Application of Charitable Donations and Bequests in Ireland (7 &amp; 8 Vict. c. xcvii.</span> (1845), and a number of other works, including pamphlets on church appropriations and endowments (1849), <span class="italic">The Irish church: being a digest of the returns of the prelates, dignitaries, and beneficed clergy</span> (1852; 2nd edn, 1863 or 1864), a work on the <span class="roman">Merchant Shipping Acts</span> of 1854, and <span class="italic">Papers and letters on subjects of literary, historical, and political interest, and speeches at public meetings, in parliament, and at the bar</span>, (vol. 1, 1862, privately printed) and <span class="italic">Papers, letters, and speeches in the House of Commons on the Irish land question with a summary of its parliamentary history from the general election of 1852 to the close of the session of 1863</span> (1863). The last was, in effect, the second volume of Shee's <span class="italic">Papers and letters</span>, but though &#145;vol ii&#146; appears on the original cloth cover, it is absent from the title-page.<br>
<br>After sitting on the bench for little more than four years, Shee died from an attack of apoplexy on 19 February 1868 at his residence, 5 Sussex Place, Hyde Park Gardens, London. His wife predeceased him on 11 October 1861, aged forty-five.<br>
<br>Their eldest son, <a name="cosubject_25283"></a><span class="headword">George Darell Shee</span>  (1843&#150;1894)<span class="occ"></span>, born in London on 12 July 1843, was educated at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he graduated LLB in 1866. He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 6 November 1862, and was called to the bar on 30 April 1867. He joined the south-eastern circuit, became district probate registrar for East Suffolk, and in July 1883 was appointed recorder of Hythe. He was the author of <span class="italic">A Remonstrance</span> (1886), which was addressed to Sir Charles Gavan Duffy, in reply to his attack on Sir William Shee in a book entitled <span class="italic">The League of the North and South</span>. On 14 October 1873 he married Jane, eldest daughter of Harry Innes of Thomastown. He died at his home, Landguard Lodge, Felixstowe, Suffolk, on 15 December 1894; his wife survived him.<br>
