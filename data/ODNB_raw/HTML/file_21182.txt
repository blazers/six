<span class="headword">Palmer, Sir  Geoffrey</span>, first baronet  (1598&#150;1670), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born in Carlton, Northamptonshire, the eldest son of Thomas Palmer of Carlton and Catherine, daughter of Sir Edward Watson of Rockingham in the same county. He matriculated as a pensioner from Christ's College, Cambridge, in December 1612, graduated BA in 1616, and proceeded MA in 1619. Admitted &#145;specially&#146; to the Middle Temple on 14 June 1616, he was called to the bar on 23 May 1623. Palmer declined to serve as a reader in the spring and summer terms of 1626, and was fined. At an unknown date he married Margaret, daughter of Sir Francis Moore, serjeant-at-law, of Fawley, Berkshire. They had four sons: Thomas, who died young, Lewis (1630&#150;1713), Geoffrey (1642&#150;1661), and Edward, and two daughters, Elizabeth and Frances.<br>
<br>Elected to the Long Parliament in 1640 for Stamford, Lincolnshire (when he was a junior member of the queen's counsel), Palmer left a career in conveyancing for high law and politics. He joined the committee to hear the petitions of the ministers of London on church government on 23 January 1641, and the committee for ecclesiastical affairs on 9 February. As a manager of Strafford's impeachment in April he gave legal opinions on points of law and made interventions on behalf of the accused's procedural rights. He advocated moderation on the articles concerning arbitrary government, and signed the protestation of 3 May in defence of the protestant religion. After an act was passed perpetuating the life of the parliament he joined Edward Hyde and Viscount Falkland in supporting the king against his new council. In July he negotiated the queen's terms for settling the banishment of priests and retaining her Roman Catholic chaplains.<br>
<br>Palmer's political views changed during the debates on the grand remonstrance on 22&#150;3 November 1641. After the remonstrance was passed in the early hours of 23 November and John Hampden moved to print it, he rose and shouted &#145;I do protest!&#146;  (Bruce, 128). The commotion that followed nearly caused bloodshed in the excited atmosphere of the Commons. Palmer was threatened with expulsion, but the vote against him failed. Speaking after midnight on 24 November he called the majority &#145;A Rabble of inconsiderable persons, set on by a juggling Junto&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, ed. Coates, 187), and was committed to the Tower, from where he was released on 8 December. After the vote authorizing the militia ordinance on 30 April 1642 he withdrew from the house and became commissioner of array for his county.<br>
<br>Palmer was awarded the degree of DCL by Oxford University in 1643 and was a member of the royalist parliament which met in the city on 22 January 1644. He was one of Charles's commissioners for the negotiation of the abortive treaty of Uxbridge in January&#150;February 1645 and a later negotiation in December of that year that was stillborn. Appointed solicitor-general on 3 November 1645, he remained in Oxford during the siege of the city. Upon its fall he had letters of composition for compounding his estates when he surrendered them on 22 June 1646; his fine was eventually set at &pound;500 in September 1648. During the 1650s Palmer was able to practise law in London, obtaining licences to move cases and appear as a witness. He seems to have given legal advice to various peers. Committed to the Tower on 9 June 1655 on suspicion of raising forces against Cromwell's government, he was probably released in the following September.<br>
<br>At the Restoration Palmer was made attorney-general on 31 May 1660, was elected bencher of the Middle Temple in the following month, and later served as its treasurer. He was knighted on 1 June, conferred with a baronetcy on 7 June 1660, was appointed serjeant in October of that year, and was active as crown legal counsel and in the preparation of prosecutions. In 1662 he was prominent in the trial of the regicides, taking depositions and handling the maintenance and discharge of the prisoners. Although Palmer was quite favourable to Lambert, Ludlow characterized him as one &#145;of the tyrant's bloodhounds, at the bar&#146;, thirsting for the blood of innocent lambs  (<span class="italic">A Voyce from the Watch Tower</span>, ed. A. B. Worden, CS, 4th. ser., 21, 1978, 315).<br>
<br>Palmer became an intimate part of a circle of friends recruited by Hyde, now earl of Clarendon, from his former inn, the Middle Temple, who collaborated on enacting parliamentary legislation. In parliament he was a strong supporter of the royal prerogative and argued against compromise with opponents. He had his son Geoffrey elected MP for Ludgershall, Wiltshire, in March 1661 by forcing the sheriff to deliver the election writ to his agent there. His son Lewis was elected MP for Higham Ferrers. Palmer was briefly appointed chief justice of Chester in late 1661. An active attorney-general, he held the office until his death. He was also recorder of Boston in 1662&#150;70, and chief justice of the common pleas temporarily in 1666.<br>
<br>In 1663 Palmer edited the law reports of his father-in-law, Sir Francis Moore, which he gave to the Middle Temple Library. A volume of cases partly drawn from his own manuscript reports appeared under his judicial imprimatur as <span class="italic">Les reports de Sir Gefrey Palmer, chevalier et baronet</span> in 1678. They consist of cases chiefly in the king's bench between 1619 and 1629, which he collected and edited as a young attorney and barrister. Published posthumously, this work set a new standard for law reports as it named the barristers and judges for each statement made. Whether Palmer did more than edit them is doubtful.<br>
<br>Palmer died on 5 May 1670 at his house in Hampstead Fields, Middlesex, where his hospitality was famous among contemporaries. He lay in state at the Middle Temple and his funeral had a great train of nobles and judges to Carlton, where his remains were buried alongside those of his wife (who had predeceased him) in the parish church. Lewis, his eldest surviving son, succeeded him in the baronetcy. His rich collection of political and legal manuscripts and printed books went to his grandson Geoffrey. Palmer gave generously to the poor of Northamptonshire, Middlesex, and Rutland, and to the Hospital of the Blessed Jesus in Rutland, for which he established a charitable trust.<br>
