<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ray,  Edward Rivers <span class="st"> [Ted]</span></span>  (1877&#150;1943), <span class="occ">golfer</span>, was born at Marais, Grouville, Jersey, on 6 April 1877, the son of Stephen Ray, a mariner who captained an oyster trawler, and his wife, Mary Ann Arm. In common with the other boys of the village of Grouville (from where also came Harry Vardon), he swung a makeshift golf club from a very early age. Ray's own first club was made by his father and was unusual, even by Grouville standards, in using, for the head, a wooden pin of the kind used by Jersey fishermen for mending nets. The shaft was a simple thorn stick. With this and other home-made implements Ray and his fellow villagers practised obsessively, when not caddying, on the links at Grouville, and this was to prove, as Ray confessed years later in his book <span class="italic">Inland Golf</span> (1912), invaluable training for his future career. His golfing enthusiasm was encouraged by George Boomer, the headmaster of La Moye School, which he attended.<br>
<br>Ray turned professional in 1894, aged seventeen, and was employed as a club-maker at the Royal Jersey Golf Club before working briefly as professional to a small club outside St Malo. He played in the open championship at Sandwich in 1899, and became the professional at Churston Golf Club in Devon, where he met his wife, Edith Hooper. His first major success came in 1903, when he was runner-up in the <span class="italic">News of the World</span> match play championship to James Braid, an outcome that was repeated in 1911. In 1912 he lost again in the final, this time to fellow islander Harry Vardon, but gained ample compensation by winning the open championship at Muirfield in the same year, where his winning score of 295 equalled the championship record set by J. H. Taylor three years previously. His book <span class="italic">Inland Golf</span>, with suggestions on the techniques necessary for inland (as distinct from links), courses appeared shortly after his open victory.<br>
<br>In 1913 Ray and Vardon toured North America under the sponsorship of Lord Northcliffe, proprietor of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>. They travelled 35,000 miles in three months, and played forty-one well-paid exhibition four-ball matches, of which they won all but one. In the US open championship at the Country Club, Brookline, both Ray and Vardon shared the lead at the end of four rounds with the young Boston amateur Francis Ouimet, but the following day, in perhaps the most famous play-off in the history of golf, the unknown American Ouimet saw off his two illustrious British rivals. Play-offs had not been kind to Ray: in 1912 he lost both the German and Belgian opens in this way.<br>
<br>On returning to the USA in 1920, Ray once again found himself in close competition with Harry Vardon for the open title, and in a raging storm became one of only three Britons to date (Vardon and Tony Jacklin were the others) to win open championships on both sides of the Atlantic. At forty-three Ray was then also the oldest winner of the American title, until overtaken by Raymond Floyd in 1986. In the open championship itself, Ray had an excellent record: he finished in the first six on seven occasions apart from his solitary triumph, and came second by one stroke to Jim Barnes at Prestwick in 1925. He played his last open at Prince's, Sandwich, in 1932, aged fifty-five, and his last tournament victory came in the Hertfordshire open in 1935. Like almost all the great professional champions of his era, Ray also held a club position and, having succeeded Harry Vardon as professional at Ganton, Yorkshire, in 1904, he moved south in 1912 and for much of his career was attached to the Oxhey Park Golf Club at Watford Heath, north of London.<br>
<br>In 1926 Ray was appointed captain of a British Isles team which played an American team at Wentworth in what was a precursor of the Ryder cup. He also played three times in the Ryder cup itself, on the first occasion as replacement captain when Abe Mitchell was struck down with appendicitis on the way to catch the boat at Southampton.<br>
<br>Ray was a founder member of the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA), established in 1901 to protect and promote the interests of golf professionals. In later years he took an active role on the executive and it was Ray who persuaded the earl of Wilton to donate &pound;500 to the PGA coffers when the organization faced a financial crisis immediately after the First World War. The executive committee minutes of the PGA show that Ray proposed a way of determining how many qualifying places for the open should stem from each qualifying section. He also seconded a motion in 1927 that those clubs that held gate-money tournaments should donate a proportion of the profits to the PGA benevolent fund. He was the major shareholder and a foundation director of the Professional Golfers' Co-operative Association, established in January 1921. The idea behind this successful enterprise was to buy golf equipment in bulk at discounted prices from the manufacturers and sell on to individual club professionals so that they could compete with the sports stores. Ray was a man of fierce integrity. When, in 1925, he was accused of leaking confidential information from executive committee meetings, he not only satisfied his colleagues that he had refused to answer questions from the press, but also insisted that an inquiry be held.<br>
<br>A huge, lumbering man with enormous hands, Ray was outgoing and ebullient, always prepared to voice his opinion, but with a relaxed attitude to life and golf. Once, when teaching, he was asked by a young pupil how the latter could gain more distance: &#145;hit it a bloody sight harder, mate!&#146; was Ray's legendary response. Ray himself was always a powerful player who often finished off-balance after some of his long shots. He pioneered the high-flying approach, favouring the niblick (akin to a number nine iron) for shots to the flag. Surprisingly for such a big man, he was an excellent putter, with a delicate stroke around the greens. This touch served him well at lawn bowls, another sport at which he excelled. Most pictures of him in action show the buttoned-up jacket (even in the August heat of the central United States), trilby hat, and, very often, a characteristic pipe clenched between his teeth. He died at the Peace Memorial Hospital, Watford, on 26 August 1943.<br>
