<span class="headword">Philip <span class="st"> [Philips]</span>,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1580&#150;1647), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born in Sanquhar, Dumfriesshire, Scotland. Privately educated, he then studied at the Scots College in Paris until 1602 and in Rome, where he was among the first students in the new Scots College. After his ordination he returned to Scotland to serve the Catholics secretly until he was captured and imprisoned. After his release he went to France, where in 1617 he became a member of the Oratory in Paris, under the guidance of its founder, Pierre de B&eacute;rulle. In 1625 he was appointed to be one of the Oratorian chaplains permitted to enter England, under the treaty for the marriage of Charles I and Henrietta Maria of France, to minister to the queen's large household. When Charles I demanded the expulsion of most of the French entourage in 1626 Henrietta insisted that Philip remain as her confessor, which appointment he retained even after a number of French Capuchins staffed her chapels when the household was reorganized. During the following years he became the informal head of a small circle of Scottish Catholic peers at the court, such as Robert Maxwell, first earl of Nithsdale, James Hamilton, second earl of Abercorn, and George Seton, third earl of Winton. Later, with other Catholic barons, they would be accused by the covenanters of fomenting trouble in Scotland.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, with the approval of King Charles, Philip arranged to have an agent appointed by Pope Urban VIII as papal representative at the court of Henrietta. In December 1634 Gregorio Panzani, of the Roman Oratory, took up residence in London as agent. In his memoirs he described his mission only as &#145;an experiment how far the two churches could be brought towards union&#146;. He noted that Philip had several discussions with Charles, &#145;where he inferred the necessity of reunion&#146; and tried &#145;to level the way and remove prejudices&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Gregorio Panzani</span>, 165, 186&#150;7). Furthermore, in the summer of 1636 Sir William Hamilton, Abercorn's younger brother, became the queen's agent in Rome so that a &#145;mutual agency&#146;, under Philip's sponsorship, was to exist for the next five years. In January 1637 George Con, a Scottish priest, replaced Panzani and encountered unexpected problems, partly because the protestants at court were startled to hear that Con was expecting to be later created a cardinal. For this reason Philip openly declared that he had no interest in a red hat. Count Carlo Rosetti, the last agent, came in August 1639, when a Scottish crisis had forced Henrietta to seek aid from her brother in France. Clearly without Charles's awareness Philip spoke to Rosetti of a possible conversion of the king, if a large papal loan were forthcoming, but nothing was accomplished.<br>
<br>In spring 1640, when Philip was said to be about sixty, a major crisis overshadowed his future at court. In a letter to a French friend that was intercepted by parliament he described the queen as in grave danger and in need of Louis's aid. Articles of impeachment were drawn up that denounced him as a leader of a popish conspiracy at court and other misdeeds, such as influencing young Prince Charles towards popery. In the Commons, on 30 October 1640, John Pym accused him of corresponding with &#145;dangerous persons&#146; and demanded that he appear to testify. Then on 2 November the Lords ordered him to appear to answer about an imaginary role in the Irish insurrection. When he refused to swear by a &#145;heretical&#146; <span class="roman">English Bible</span>, he was confined in the Tower for a year and these dubious charges were circulated in print. From March 1642 until July 1644 he stayed with the queen in her journeys to assist the royalist cause. It is worth noting that the nuncio in Paris recommended him for the office of vicar apostolic in Scotland, but he returned to France in poor health. Late in 1646 he became gravely ill with a fever and was visited privately by the queen. Later she praised his twenty years of service as &#145;a prudent and discreet man who would never suffer her to be pressed to any passionate undertaking under pretence of doing good for Catholics&#146;  (Clarendon, 5.167&#150;8). He died at the Oratory in Paris on 4 January 1647, and was buried there.<br>
