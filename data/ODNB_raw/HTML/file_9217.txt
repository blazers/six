<span class="headword">Fawcett,  Benjamin</span>  (1715&#150;1780), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, was born on 16 August 1715 at Sleaford, Lincolnshire, the youngest of ten children. He was educated at home, then in 1738 he went to Philip Doddridge's academy at Northampton. While he was there, Bryan Connell, a Roman Catholic, was found guilty of murder. Doddridge sent Fawcett to Chester to find an alibi for Connell, but in vain. Connell was hanged in 1741. When Thomas Steffe, Samuel Stodden's assistant at Pauls Meeting, Taunton, another pupil of Doddridge, died of smallpox, Stodden asked Doddridge to suggest a replacement. In February 1741 Fawcett was invited, and had arrived by June. A year later, on 16 June 1742, he was ordained in a crowded church including forty ministers, and Doddridge preached. Doddridge wrote to his wife saying Fawcett's future wife was &#145;a genteel agreeable girl about 23 and will have a good &pound;1,400&#146;  (14 June 1742, Nuttall, 150, no. 754). On 29 July 1742 Fawcett married Sarah Knight (1719/20&#150;1774), who worshipped with her family at Pauls Meeting.<br>
<br>Fawcett was friendly with Risdon Darracott, minister at Wellington and another Doddridge pupil. They both sympathized with George Whitefield, which brought the criticism of other ministers; this criticism reflected on Doddridge, who supported them. The three of them corresponded throughout their lives. In 1744 Fawcett wanted his own church, and in August he visited the church in Kidderminster to preach. Fawcett was given a unanimous call to the ministry on 17 March 1745. The Taunton church was upset and wrote to Doddridge &#145;at present wee are a very unhappy people&#146;  (Nuttall, no. 1050). Fawcett revived the congregation at Kidderminster by visiting every church family, questioning them about their faith, and by attending all the church organizations; he divided the children into groups and catechized monthly. Doddridge visited Fawcett at Kidderminster, finding &#145;He has upward of 300 catechumens of all ages, has received 60 communicants into church within a year and a half&#146;  (ibid., no. 1209). Fawcett was so successful that in 1754 a larger church was built at a cost of &pound;1000. For the next twenty-five years he preached to a full church, three times on Sundays and once in the week. He seldom rose after 5 a.m., to which he attributed his good health.<br>
<br>Darracott died on 14 March 1759 and Fawcett preached his funeral sermon at Wellington. In 1771 Fawcett published a funeral sermon for Francis Best, a church trustee, with a detailed narrative of his murder, as well as over twenty other items, including an abridgement of Baxter's <span class="italic">Everlasting Rest</span> in 1759. In 1777 he published <span class="italic">Candid Reflections on the Different Modes of Explaining the Trinity</span>, which was meant to heal, but there were suspicions that he had Unitarian sympathies. Some in his congregation, who were doctrinally more heterodox, objected to Fawcett's successor, John Barrett, and opened their own church in 1782, the New Meeting.<br>
<br>The Fawcetts had four sons and four daughters: Sarah was born in Taunton and the others in Kidderminster. Their mother died on 11 February 1774, aged fifty-four, and Fawcett married on 27 February 1775 Hannah Short (<i>d</i>. 1786). Fawcett died at Kidderminster on 18 October 1780 and was buried in St Mary's old churchyard on 23 October. &#145;His two sons, brother and nephew were mourners&#146;  (<span class="italic">Practical Works of Job Orton</span>, 2.629). The funeral sermon was preached by Thomas Taylor, a native of Kidderminster, friend of Fawcett, and minister of Carter Lane, London.<br>
<br>Fawcett's son Samuel, born on 15 June 1751, trained at Daventry Academy and was ordained at Beaminster on 26 June 1776. He was invited by the members of New Meeting, Kidderminster, to become their minister, but he declined. In 1801 he became minister of the reopened Unitarian church at Yeovil until 1816. He died at Yeovil on 14 December 1835, aged eighty-four. Fawcett's church in Kidderminster became Baxter United Reformed Church in 1972, and Pauls Meeting, in the same year, became Taunton United Reformed Church.<br>
