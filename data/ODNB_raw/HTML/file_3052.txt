<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bowes,  John</span>, Baron Bowes of Clonlyon  (1691&#150;1767), <span class="occ">lord chancellor of Ireland</span>, was born possibly either in Surrey or in Ware, Hertfordshire. He was the second son of Thomas Bowes of Bishopsgate Street, London, a member of the Turners' Company; his mother's surname was North. He entered the Inner Temple in 1712 and was called to the bar in 1718. He went to Ireland in 1725 &#145;in the train of&#146; the new lord chancellor, Richard West, and enjoyed the patronage of Philip Yorke, subsequently Lord Hardwicke, with whom he had studied law  (Duhigg, 307). Bowes was called to the Irish bar in Michaelmas 1725 and appointed third serjeant in 1727. At this time he seems to have seen Irish office as a stepping-stone to advancement in England, and complained particularly of the lack of conversation in a society where &#145;drinking is the business of their leisure hours&#146;  (Bowes to Sir Dudley Ryder, 12 July 1727, PRONI, T 3228/1/1). He became second serjeant in 1728, solicitor-general in 1730, and in 1731 MP for Taghmon, co. Wexford. When the lord chancellorship fell vacant in 1739 Bowes was one of two candidates recommended by Archbishop Boulter and by Henry Boyle, who cited his parliamentary services. However Sir Robert Walpole and Hardwicke chose Robert Jocelyn, whom Bowes succeeded as attorney-general. He became chief baron of the exchequer in 1741 and lord chancellor in 1757. In 1758 he was created Baron Bowes of Clonlyon, co. Meath. He served as a lord justice in 1765 and in 1766.<br>
<br>Bowes was a strong supporter of the English interest in Ireland, hostile to Jonathan Swift and later to Charles Lucas. In the Dublin riot of 3 December 1759 the crowd tried to force on him an oath to oppose the rumoured union of Ireland and Great Britain; he subsequently pressed for the city authorities to be punished for their inaction. When a new dispute arose in 1760&#150;61, about the transmission of finance bills from England, Bowes sharply criticized what he saw as the opportunism of leading politicians, and blamed the money bill dispute of 1753&#150;6 for unsettling the government of the kingdom. In 1757 he opposed proposals to register Roman Catholic clergy on the grounds that this would imply legal recognition. His much quoted judgment, that the law did not suppose any such person to exist as an Irish Roman Catholic, was delivered about 1759 in the case of a Roman Catholic merchant, Laurence Saul, prosecuted for harbouring a woman from relatives who wished to make her conform to the Church of Ireland.<br>
<br>Bowes was regarded as a highly effective speaker, both in court and in the Commons. His performance as prosecutor in the trial for murder of Lord Santry in 1739 was particularly praised. The dedication prefacing a new edition of the Irish statutes in 1762 commended him for making the court of chancery &#145;a terror to fraud and a protection and comfort to every honest man&#146;, while John Scott exempted him from the criticisms he directed at other lord chancellors  (Ball, 2.172). By contrast B. T. Duhigg, writing forty years after Bowes's death, in the context of a polemic against the eclipse of Irish lawyers by English placemen, condemned him as the partial tool of political faction. An anonymous poem published in 1730 mocked him as:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">a great beau<br>
</div>
<div>that here makes a show<br>
</div>
<div>and thinks all about him are fools<br>
</div> (Ball, 2.111)</blockquote>Bishop Edward Synge of Elphin described him as &#145;an old fop&#146;  (to Alicia Synge, 27 June 1752, in <span class="italic">The Synge Letters</span>, ed. M.-L. Legg, 1996, 424). He suffered badly from gout; in 1759 he was said to be in &#145;a miserable state of health, with legs bigger considerably at the ankle than at the calf&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Correspondence of &hellip; Mrs Delany</span>, 3.554). He died, unmarried, on 22 July 1767 and was buried in Christ Church, Dublin. His brother Rumsey Bowes of Binfield, Berkshire, erected a marble monument to him in the cathedral's crypt.<br>
