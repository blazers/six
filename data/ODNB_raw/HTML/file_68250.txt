<span class="headword">Boothby,  Frances</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1669&#150;1670), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was the first woman to have an original play professionally staged in London: her tragicomedy, <span class="italic">Marcelia, or, The Treacherous Friend</span>, was performed by the King's Company early in 1669 and published in 1670. The imminent performance of <span class="italic">Marcelia</span> was noticed in a letter from Elizabeth Cottington to Walter Aston, written in January 1669. &#145;I shall tremble for the poor woman exposed among the critticks&#146;  (Clifford, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2.60), she continued, with well justified fears: Boothby's only other known work, a poem lamenting the play's failure, is also preserved in the papers of the Aston family. <span class="italic">Marcelia</span> is a conservative work, showing the defeat of upstarts and the triumph of aristocratic values. In portraying the fall of an ambitious favourite, it perhaps alludes to the recent fall of Clarendon, and in depicting a king who is (temporarily) false in love, it contributes to the widespread, but as yet tactful, theatrical criticism of the king's morals.<br>
<br>Boothby's identity is a mystery: even her forename is known only because it is preserved by Gerard Langbaine  (Langbaine, 26&#150;7), and almost the only certainty is that she was not (as has been suggested in Bell, Parfitt, and Shepherd, 31), the Frances Boothby, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Milward, who married Sir William Boothby in 1653, for this Frances died the following year. The only clues are the two relatives to whom she addresses her works: <span class="italic">Marcelia</span> is dedicated to Lady Yate, the most prominent recusant of Worcestershire, and the poem is addressed to her &#145;Cosen&#146; Anne Somerset, a daughter of Walter Aston  (Clifford, <span class="italic">Poetry</span>, 228&#150;9). The Yates and Astons were linked by marriages with the Gage family of Firle Place, Sussex.<br>
<br>Although Sir William Boothby's first wife cannot be the author, his family is the only one of that name likely to have the exalted connections which Frances mentions. Lady Yate and Sir William's uncle Richard Boothby of Potters Marston did, indeed, have a common ancestor in Ralph Sacheverell of Morley, Derbyshire. Another relative of Sir William, the prosperous merchant Walter Boothby of Tottenham, had a daughter named Frances, born in the mid-1630s and still alive in 1690.<br>
