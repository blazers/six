<span class="headword">Egerton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cavendish]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>, countess of Bridgewater  (1626&#150;1663), <span class="occ">writer</span>, second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4946/', "William Cavendish, first duke of Newcastle upon Tyne (bap. 1593, d. 1676)")</script>, and his first wife, Elizabeth Bassett (1599&#150;1643), spent her childhood in the shelter of her father's immense wealth. From her earliest years, she was, like her siblings (and later, her prolific stepmother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4940/', "Margaret Cavendish")</script>), encouraged to write by William Cavendish, himself the author of plays, poems, advice to his pupil (the future Charles II), and manuals on horsemanship. He was also patron to such seventeenth-century writers as Ben Jonson, James Shirley, and William Davenant. The earliest of Egerton's manuscript compilations (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. poet. 16; Yale University, Beinecke Library, Osborn MS b. 233), consonant with the works of the literary coterie that surrounded her cultivated father, is an anthology of poems and dramas co-authored with her sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5261/', "Jane (later Lady Jane Cheyne)")</script>. The best-known section, &#145;The Concealed Fansyes&#146;, is a drama (present only in the Bodleian exemplar) that has, since the twentieth century, been accorded scholarly attention.<br>
<br>After her marriage in 1641 to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8588/', "John Egerton, later second earl of Bridgewater (1623&#150;1686)")</script>, she remained, with her sisters Jane and Frances (later countess of Bolingbroke), at Welbeck, her father's Nottinghamshire seat, despite her mother's death, and even after Cavendish, an important military figure in Charles I's camp, left England for the continent with her brothers. In 1645 she and her sisters twice entertained Charles at Welbeck, where they also experienced its possession by parliamentary forces. By late 1645 she moved to Ashridge, the Egerton family seat, and was thereafter largely sheltered from the ravages of the civil war, from which the Egertons succeeded, for the most part, to distance themselves. Her very successful marriage was ended on 14 June 1663 by her sudden and dramatic death at thirty-seven while being delivered of her tenth child during a visit to her husband, who had been placed in the custody of John Ayton, gentleman usher of the black rod after being challenged to a duel by Lionel Cranfield, third earl of Middlesex. She was buried at Ashridge, Hertfordshire. Although he survived her for over twenty years, Bridgewater never remarried; ironically, his extraordinary epitaph for her (recorded most prominently by Ballard), and particularly its mention of her private writings, has brought her belated notice.<br>
<br>Shrouded from public view by her family during her lifetime, Egerton nevertheless claims attention today for a number of manuscripts described in family accounts though long kept in private hands. In various forms, some of these have found their way to public depositories: letters exchanged with family members (Nottingham University Library, Portland collection); the literary anthology co-written with her sister Jane in the early 1640s (Bodleian and Beinecke libraries); the deeply pious manuscripts written later in her life, her &#145;Loose Papers&#146; (British and Huntington libraries); and her &#145;Meditations&#146; (Hunt. L.).<br>
<br>Fair copies of Egerton's posthumously bound &#145;Loose Papers&#146; were apparently made for each of her children. The exemplar that descended to Samuel Egerton Brydges was sold to the British Library in 1836 (Egerton MS 607). Two other fair copies remain in the possession of the family, although facsimiles of these copies are housed at the Huntington Library (EL 8376; EL 8377). The title-page of each of these three copies bears the statement in John Egerton's hand that the manuscript was &#145;Examined by JBridgewater&#146;, and the extent of this examination is suggested by the inclusion, in each, of four entries by him (which are attributed to him, however, in only one copy). The originally &#145;Loose Papers&#146; that constitute this manuscript contain original, unobjectionable prayers and meditations, many on domestic subjects; moving meditations, or essays, composed during the illness or after the death of three of Egerton's children; and essays on marriage and widowhood that open a highly unusual window on the thinking of a seventeenth-century woman.<br>
<br>A partial fair copy of &#145;Meditations&#146; (RB 297343), as well as a facsimile of the author's holograph of this compilation (EL 8374), is also held at the Huntington Library. Emendations, in the holograph, in John Egerton's distinctive hand, are carried over to the fair copy, providing clear evidence of his interference in his wife's work. A number of leaves in the folder containing the holograph seem to provide John Egerton's directions for copying the manuscript. That such interference was not limited to husband and wife can be shown by interpolations by the second earl in manuscripts by his oldest son, later the third earl.<br>
