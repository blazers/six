</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wells, Sir  Thomas Spencer</span>, first baronet  (1818&#150;1897), <span class="occ">gynaecological surgeon</span>, was born at St Albans, Hertfordshire, on 3 February 1818, the eldest of the four sons and one daughter of builder Joseph William Wells (1794&#150;1856) and his wife, Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1846), daughter of William Wright, of Bermondsey. Wells's formal education began at St Albans Abbey School. On leaving St Albans in 1835, Wells decided on a surgical career, undertaking a year's pupillage with Dr Michael Sadler in Barnsley. Wells followed Sadler on rounds, used his mentor's library, and learned medical bookkeeping and dispensing. Wells then moved to Leeds and was apprenticed to the parish surgeon Mr Marsden. Attending the poor, Wells, still only nineteen, gained substantial surgical experience and assisted in numerous childbirths. He also attended Leeds medical school for lectures and demonstrations, including those of Joseph Garlick, William Hey, and Thomas Pridgin Teale senior. Like many ambitious would-be surgeons, Wells recognized the importance of travelling to hospitals and schools to broaden his education. Despite limited moneys, he went to Trinity College, Dublin, in the summer of 1837 to study with physicians Robert Graves and William Stokes, surgeon Philip Crampton, and ophthalmologist Arthur Jacob.<br>
<br>At Dublin, one of the leading British medical schools, the traditional emphasis on identification of symptoms was giving way to revolutionary changes generated from the Paris clinics, where prognoses and diagnoses were increasingly based on correlations between physical signs and autopsy findings. These French methods helped to elevate the status of surgery just as Wells entered the profession. He absorbed this new approach and in 1839 received recognition for his prize-winning essay on bronchotomy (tracheotomy) delivered at the Dublin Medico-Chirurgical Society.<br>
<br>After two years in Dublin, Wells moved to London to walk the wards of St Thomas's Hospital. During his two years there, he amassed experience in hospital practice and surgery. He was congratulated for completing the best series of post-mortem reports for 1839&#150;40, and in 1841 was admitted as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons.<br>
<br>Wells was enamoured of the London medical environment, but on leaving St Thomas's he still lacked the financial and social resources to acquire a metropolitan appointment. In September 1841 he accepted the Royal Navy post of assistant surgeon, with a guaranteed salary and the opportunity to hone his skills. Wells was dispatched to Britain's main foreign naval hospital in Malta, where he treated a wide range of infectious diseases and injuries, as well as establishing a civilian practice and publishing in Britain's leading medical journals. In 1844 he became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons.<br>
<br>Wells left Malta in 1846, and for the next decade led a nomadic life. From mid-1846 until mid-1848 he undertook several voyages aboard HMS <i>Ceylon</i>, <i>Locust</i>, <i>Hibernia</i>, and <i>Trafalgar</i>&#151;and compiled reports that were published in British medical journals. On shore leave Wells reinforced his professional profile by presenting foreign findings to his London colleagues. In 1848 he was promoted to surgeon and granted two months' leave in Paris to study the treatment of gunshot wounds. At this point his career took a noticeable turn toward civilian practice.<br>
<br>Following his initial Parisian stint, Wells requested a further six months' break for continental travel. In Paris he attended Dupuytren's and Malgaigne's clinics and became interested in the work of Bernard and Magendie, especially in pathology and ophthalmology. Wells also visited Vienna and other leading centres of clinical and laboratory medicine. Shortly afterwards the navy again granted him leave, this time to accompany the ailing marquess of Northampton to Egypt, where Wells became interested in malaria. By then he was clearly looking beyond the navy and towards a more comfortable London existence. Nevertheless, in 1851 he was commissioned as surgeon and sanitary officer to HMS <i>Modeste</i> with the Mediterranean Fleet. Again, Wells made the best of the opportunity and further developed his interest in public health, becoming a strong proponent of quarantine and vaccination.<br>
<br>By 1853, however, Wells had tired of naval life. On 16 July that year he married Elizabeth Lucas Wright, daughter of James Wright, a solicitor; they had five daughters and a son, Arthur Spencer Wells, private secretary to the chancellor of the exchequer from 1893 to 1895. Ambitious and accomplished, Wells wanted to return to London permanently. Furthermore, his health was poor, and he obtained leave to visit mineral springs in Germany. On his return to London he continued to receive half pay from the navy while establishing a private practice in prestigious Grosvenor Square, where he at first concentrated on ophthalmic surgery. What Wells still lacked at this time was one of the highly desirable hospital appointments that usually guaranteed metropolitan success. Wells, it appears, lacked the necessary social connections. However, in 1854, he received two lesser, but crucial, appointments: he became attached to the Grosvenor Place school of medicine (affiliated with St George's Hospital) as lecturer in surgery and gained a position as surgeon to the dispensary of the Samaritan Free Hospital for Women and Children.<br>
<br>The Samaritan was Wells's making. There, over the next two decades, Wells developed a reputation as Britain's leading &#145;women's surgeon&#146;, as well as helping to develop gynaecology as a distinct medical specialism. The Samaritan was one of the first generation of small hospitals that specialized in the treatment of women. They were commonly started as shoestring affairs and, in this instance, the hospital had no in-patient facilities. Wells's professional standing enabled him to experiment, carrying out innovative surgery that would eventually place the Samaritan among the world's leading gynaecological institutions. In addition, he became editor of the <span class="italic">Medical Times and Gazette</span>, a position that further enhanced his professional standing.<br>
<br>At this juncture, then, it seems curious that Wells should have volunteered for a civilian posting with the army in the Crimean War. Perhaps an annual salary of &pound;1500 appealed to a young man whose other positions were chiefly honorary. He and his wife went initially to the large hospital in Smyrna and later to Renkioi in the Dardanelles. Their first child, Helen, was born there in 1855. This sojourn was curtailed in April 1856, when the British Admiralty discovered that while still receiving half pay Wells was in full army employ. Ordered back to London to prepare for duty, he resigned.<br>
<br>During his time at the military front line Wells had come to rethink the limits of surgery. He now saw the abdomen as operable. In civilian practice, abdominal surgery was largely viewed as tantamount to murder, yet in battle the abdomen was frequently ripped open, and the surgical attempts to save lives sometimes succeeded. Wells returned to the Samaritan with a new confidence in the potential of abdominal surgery and the conviction that new approaches could be applied to the treatment of women.<br>
<br>Wells's place in medical history is most securely attached to his pioneering work in abdominal surgery, particularly in the development of ovariotomy, an operation that entailed removing diseased ovaries and Fallopian tubes. While a handful of surgeons had previously attempted this dangerous procedure with minimal success, Wells placed it within the surgical canon. Although ovariotomy was highly controversial, in a small hospital like the Samaritan Wells had greater autonomy than would have been the case in one of the larger, more hierarchical teaching hospitals. On his return from the Crimea he obtained his own hospital beds. The Samaritan was beginning to draw attention from leading consultants such as Sir William Fergusson and Wells was willing to demonstrate his techniques to them. Enormous ovarian cysts had been beyond the surgical scope and were frequently treated palliatively by repeated tapping. Wells sought a cure and turned to ovariotomy, a move that won him the backing of James Young Simpson, the renowned Edinburgh obstetrician who himself had already attempted ovariotomy.<br>
<br>Wells had witnessed his first ovariotomy while assisting Isaac Baker Brown at the Middlesex Hospital in 1854. The patient died, and Wells was discouraged, but nevertheless he attempted his own ovariotomy in December 1857. The operation was disappointing because the consulting surgeons Wells had gathered to observe and assist persuaded him to abandon the procedure when they discovered the extent of adnexal masses. That woman died from the cyst and on autopsy Wells decided the tumour would have been operable. He improved his technique, and shortly afterwards in February 1858 a patient of his survived the operation. This launched Wells on a series of operations that would over three decades establish ovariotomy as an acceptable procedure. He utilized the <span class="italic">Medical Times and Gazette</span> to publicize his own and other cases, applying cumulative medical statistics to demonstrate that mortality rates resulting from the surgery were declining and that ovariotomy was a justifiable, life-saving procedure. Wells was meticulous about presenting his failures as well as his successes. By 1880 Wells had completed his thousandth ovariotomy and had made an immense contribution to the development of gynaecology.<br>
<br>Although ovariotomy continued to be a controversial procedure, it came to be used as a &#145;cure&#146; for a variety of female maladies. By the 1870s and 1880s some surgeons began to carry out o&ouml;phorectomies, the removal of healthy ovaries, in the belief that these could cure uterine fibromata, dysmenorrhoea, and &#145;menstrual epilepsy&#146;  (Moscucci, 157). Opponents argued that this led to the &#145;unsexing&#146; of women, as it &#145;deprived women of their true essence and prevented them from fulfilling their proper role in society as mothers and moral leaders&#146;  (Moscucci, 159). Wells, too, denounced o&ouml;phorectomy, claiming in 1891 that &#145;The o&ouml;phorectomists of civilization touch hands with the aboriginal spayers of New Zealand&#146;  (Moscucci, 158). He was also vociferously opposed to the salpingo-o&ouml;phorectomy (removal of the ovaries and fallopian tube) devised by Robert Lawson Tait. The two were bitter rivals and the dispute over &#145;Tait's operation&#146; did nothing to help matters; it also divided the medical profession for many years.<br>
<br>Wells also maintained his interest in public health. In London he pleaded for legislation to govern waste disposal, water supply, and housing. He also became a prominent proponent of cremation as a more efficient, hygienic method of disposing of the dead. In surgery, he adopted Listerian antisepsis from 1878.<br>
<br>Although Wells performed controversial surgery and supported such causes as cremation, he was none the less a man of the establishment. In 1871 he became a member of the council of the Royal College of Surgeons, was the Hunterian professor in 1877, vice-president in 1879, and president in 1883, when he gave the Hunterian oration. In Ireland in 1886 he was made an honorary fellow of the King and Queen's College of Physicians and of the Royal College of Surgeons. Leiden and Bologna universities presented him with honorary medical degrees. Wells, who was acutely mindful of social as well as professional conventions, was awarded a baronetcy in 1883. From 1863 to 1896 he served as surgeon to Queen Victoria's household. Wells's publications include <span class="italic">Diseases of the Ovaries</span> (1865), <span class="italic">Diagnosis and Surgical Treatment of Abdominal Tumours</span> (1885), <span class="italic">Surgery Past, Present and Future</span> (1872), <span class="italic">The Revival of Ovariotomy &hellip;</span> (1884), and <span class="italic">Modern Abdominal Surgery: with an Appendix on the Castration of Women</span> (1891).<br>
<br>In addition to his house in London, Wells owned a country house with substantial gardens at Golder's Hill, North End, Hampstead, and became an accomplished horseman. He died from an apoplectic fit at the Hotel du Cap d'Antibes, near Cannes, on 31 January 1897. Wells's body was cremated at Woking and his ashes were buried in Brompton cemetery.<br>
