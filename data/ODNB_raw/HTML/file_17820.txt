<span class="headword">Maitland,  Edward</span>  (1824&#150;1897), <span class="occ">author and spiritualist</span>, was born on 27 October 1824 at Ipswich, the second son of Charles David Maitland (1785&#150;1865) and his wife, Elizabeth Adye Miller. His father had been a captain, Royal Artillery, serving in battle at the end of the Napoleonic War, a Cambridge graduate, and from 1828 until his death a perpetual curate at St James's Chapel, Brighton. Maitland was the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17819/', "Charles Maitland (1815&#150;1866)")</script> and Brownlow (1816&#150;1902) and nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17830/', "General Sir Peregrine Maitland (1777&#150;1854)")</script>, a distinguished soldier and colonial governor. His family were evangelicals and his adverse reaction to their strict principles of belief appears to have coloured his thinking later in life. Maitland was educated first at Morris's large private school in Brighton (1839&#150;43) and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, from 1843 to 1847 (BA 1847). Although intended by his father for the church, he was beset by doubt and emigrated to America in 1849, where he settled for a time in California among the goldminers (&#145;forty-niners&#146;), and eventually to Australia where he became a commissioner of crown lands. He married Esther Bradley (1834&#150;1856) in 1855, in New South Wales, but within a year was widowed and left with an infant son, Charles (1856&#150;1901); Charles Maitland eventually became a surgeon-major in the Bombay medical service, but Maitland apparently took no part in his upbringing.<br>
<br>Maitland returned to England in 1858, having delivered a lecture in Sydney on 9 January 1858 entitled &#145;The meaning of the age: a farewell lecture&#146;, which was later printed in Brighton, Sussex. He intended to devote himself to literary work and searching for a perfect system of thought by which to rule his life. The ensuing ten years are undocumented, but by the late 1860s he emerged to become a contributor to several journals, including <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, <span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>, and the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>. In 1868 he published <span class="italic">The Pilgrim and the Shrine, or, Passages from the Life and Correspondence of Herbert Ainslie, B. A., Cantab.</span>, a largely autobiographical novel which was well received. This resulted in his moving into society where he was favourably regarded by his contemporaries Richard Monckton Milnes, first Baron Houghton, and Sir Francis Hastings Doyle. <span class="italic">The Higher Law</span> followed in 1869, a religious romance, and <span class="italic">By and By: an Historical Romance of the Future</span> (1873) which emphasized mystical material and was set in an African utopia.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">By and By</span> attracted the attention of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15615/', "Anna Kingsford (1846&#150;1888)")</script>, a 27-year-old woman with advanced views on vegetarianism, anti-vivisection, and women's rights, but also possessed of strong poetical tendencies; she invited him to visit her and her husband, Algernon Kingsford, at their home at Atcham in Shropshire, where Algernon was a curate and later vicar. In 1874, Anna Kingsford successfully sought permission to study medicine at the University of Paris, and after escorting her there her husband invited Maitland, a connection of the Kingsford family, to be her protector in France. Maitland was a large man with a high domed head and Florence Fenwick Miller recorded in her autobiography that he was, at the time of his Paris sojourn, &#145;old (55 or so), plain, heavy, and dull of conversation&#146;  (Miller, 303). During the next six years Maitland began to explore the mystical side of his nature. In 1876 he first saw the apparition of his father, then he experienced other visitations from the dead, which convinced him he was a mystic and had a special spiritual sensitivity. This led him to believe that he had had many past lives, that he had lived in trees and animals, and that in previous incarnations he had been the emperor Marcus Aurelius, St John the Evangelist, and the prophet Daniel. As evidence for these phenomena he relied on a strange medley of so-called inspirations, revelations in dreams, passive writing, and harking to spiritual voices. In 1880, at the conclusion of Anna Kingsford's medical studies, the two returned to London, where she successfully practised medicine for a time, but continued, under Maitland's influence, to explore the supernatural. They published together <span class="italic">The Perfect Way: on the Finding of Christ</span> (1882), based on a course of Maitland's lectures. She and Maitland joined the British Theosophical Society, of which Kingsford soon became president, but after a philosophical altercation with Madame Blavatsky, the founder of nineteenth-century theosophy, they broke away and founded the London lodge of the Theosophical Society. In 1885 they founded the Hermetic Society, relying on mystic revelations, as opposed to the occult of Blavatsky, and specifically refuting her concept of Mahatmas. In the same year Maitland published <span class="italic">The Hermetic Works</span>, a translation of the works of Hermes Trismegistus.<br>
<br>After Anna Kingsford's death in February 1888, Maitland lived alone in studios at 1 Thurloe Square, London, where he claimed to receive continual &#145;illumination&#146; from her, and devoted himself to founding the Esoteric Christian Union, and editing <span class="italic">Clothed in the Sun, being the Book of the Illuminations of Anna (Bonus) Kingsford</span> (1889); <span class="italic">The New Gospel of Interpretation</span> (1892); and <span class="italic">Anna Kingsford: her life, letters, diary, and work, by her collaborator &hellip; with a supplement of post-mortem communications</span> (2 vols., 1896). The latter was not well received. Florence Fenwick Miller, who knew them both well, wrote in the <span class="italic">Woman's Signal</span> (14 October 1897) that the book was more about Maitland and his spiritual revelations than about its subject, and that &#145;the Anna Kingsford that I knew, the clever, intelligent woman &hellip; was absolutely non-existent in the book&#146;.<br>
<br>After the biography Maitland experienced a physical and mental breakdown; in 1896 he went to stay with Colonel Currie at The Warders, Tonbridge, Kent, where he suffered the loss of speech, and died on 2 October 1897. In her obituary notice Fenwick Miller quoted from, and agreed with, <span class="italic">The Athenaeum's</span> assessment that &#145;He was a man of fine feeling and much intellectual power, but he lacked balance and drifted into various crazes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Woman's Signal</span>, 14 Oct 1897). Maitland was buried in Tonbridge cemetery on 5 October 1897.<br>
