<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pecock,  Reginald</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1392, <em>d.</em> in or after 1459), <span class="occ">bishop of Chichester and religious author</span>, was born in Wales, probably about 1392, and as a young man was associated with the diocese of St David's. There is, however, no evidence to support the tradition that he was born at Laugharne, Dyfed.<h2>
<a name="EarlycareerinOxfordandLondon"></a>Early career in Oxford and London</h2>Pecock was a fellow of Oriel College, Oxford, by December 1414. He must have achieved the degree of BA by then, and so was almost certainly studying at Oxford during at least part of the period 1407&#150;11 when Archbishop Thomas Arundel (<i>d</i>. 1414) attempted to inhibit free discussion of theological issues in the university. Arundel's action was part of a strategy designed to counter the spread of heretical doctrines associated with John Wyclif (<i>d</i>. 1384) and his Lollard followers. In 1411 fellows of Oriel were divided between support for and resistance to Arundel. In an election for provost in 1417 Pecock voted with Henry Kayll and John Martill, fellows who had supported Arundel. Also voting with this group was John Carpenter (<i>d</i>. 1476), later bishop of Worcester and an important future ally. In 1417&#150;18 Pecock paid for the hire of schools from Stapledon Hall (Exeter College), Oxford, probably in connection with fulfilling academic requirements for the degree of master of arts. He was awarded the degrees of MA and BTh, and is last recorded at Oriel on 31 July 1424. He received from Oxford University the degree of DTh about 1445, apparently being exempted from the academic requirements for the degree, according to Thomas Gascoigne, a full but very hostile source. In his <span class="italic">Liber de veritatibus</span>, Gascoigne described him as having had a leprous appearance that reflected his &#145;mental leprosy&#146;, that is, his heresy.<br>
<br>While at Oriel, Pecock went rapidly through all the various stages of ordination between 21 December 1420 and 8 March 1421. His first benefice was the rectory of St Michael's Church, Gloucester, to which he was admitted on 25 October 1424 by the presentation of St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester. Possibly he resided in the rectory house in Eastgate Street. There is no evidence for the tradition in modern biography that Pecock secured the patronage of Humphrey, duke of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1447), on leaving Oxford. On the contrary, it may be significant that Pecock's first benefice was in the diocese of Philip Morgan, bishop of Worcester (<i>d</i>. 1435), who, like Pecock, was an Oxford graduate from St David's.<br>
<br>Pecock resigned the rectorship of St Michael's on 1 September 1431, in order to become master of Whittington College, a London college of priests founded in 1424 by the executors of Sir Richard Whittington, mercer and mayor of London. Thereby Pecock also became rector of the church of St Michael Paternoster Royal, which was served by the college. The appointment came when the college was still in the process of foundation. The college was supervised by Whittington's chief executor John Carpenter, common clerk of London, until his death in 1442, when governance passed to the Mercers' Company. Possibly Pecock had come to his notice through the agency of his Oriel College ally, also called John Carpenter. The two namesakes were certainly associates and may have been kinsmen. It must, however, have been the London John Carpenter who oversaw and approved Pecock's appointment.<br>
<br>By 1443 Pecock was a feoffee in a transaction of land associated with the foundation of a new chapel and hospital dedicated to the Virgin Mary and the Nine Orders of Angels at Isleworth, Middlesex. The instigator of this project was John Somerset (<i>d</i>. 1454), physician and chancellor of the exchequer to Henry VI. In 1446, moreover, Pecock became a founder member of an associated fraternity whose objective was to set up a perpetual chantry for Henry VI, Queen Margaret, and the founders. Pecock's associates in this venture were prominent in court, church, and city circles, and included the influential London clerics William Lichefield and Peter Hynford (probably Hyrford), Nicholas Ashby, bishop of Llandaff, John Somerset, and John Colop and Richard Hakeday, both of whom, like Pecock, were associates of John Carpenter, common clerk.<h2>
<a name="Earlywritingsandcontroversies"></a>Early writings and controversies</h2>Despite Arundel's efforts to eradicate the Wycliffite heresy early in the century, Lollards were present in London when Pecock became master at Whittington. London may have been a centre for Lollard book production, particularly the area around St Paul's, close by Pecock's parish. Pecock was aware that the heretics circulated books among themselves, particularly the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and theological works in English. He studied Lollard doctrine in order to refute it. Grasping the importance Lollards placed on the written word, especially on vernacular writings, he decided to try to counter the heresy by composing and circulating vernacular books of his own. This was a different strategy from that of Arundel, who had prohibited the discussion of theological questions in the vernacular, and it made Pecock vulnerable to prosecution himself.<br>
<br>While he was at Whittington College, Pecock worked on some of the theological works which were to be examined at his heresy trial. He wrote part of <span class="italic">The Reule of Crysten Religioun</span> in 1443  (New York, Pierpont Morgan Library MS 519; ed. W. C. Greet, EETS, o.s. 171, 1927). He also wrote part of <span class="italic">The Repressor of Over Much Blaming of the Clergy</span>  (CUL, MS Kk.4.26; ed. C. Babington, Rolls Series, 19, 1860) while at Whittington, and probably some or all of <span class="italic">The Donet</span>  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Bodley 916; ed. E. V. Hitchcock, EETS, o.s. 156, 1921), an offshoot of <span class="italic">The Reule</span>. He records that he often worked on several books at once, and it is clear from the surviving texts that he was a habitual self-citer and cross-referencer. These aspects of his practice of composition make it difficult to date or even sequence his works.<br>
<br>In 1441 Pecock was nominated in the will of the London John Carpenter, together with William Lichefield, to choose books for the Guildhall Library (another of the Whittington charities) from the testator's private collection. His interest in providing books for those of limited financial means is attested by the survival of his <span class="italic">Poore Mennis Myrrour</span>  (BL, Add. MS 37788; part edited in E. V. Hitchcock, <span class="italic">The Donet</span>), a digest of <span class="italic">The Donet</span> intended for those of modest means and education, though there is no evidence that it circulated widely. He shared these interests with John Colop, who developed a scheme for circulating books for &#145;common-profit&#146;.<br>
<br>Pecock's interest in the circulation of theological writings, like his own prolific output, was motivated by his conviction that reasoned expositions of Christianity in English could counter the spread of heterodox ideas in Lollard books. He may have known some Lollards personally, and may have chosen to debate with them rather than to prosecute them. In his late work <span class="italic">The Book of Faith</span>  (Cambridge, Trinity College, MS B.14.45; ed. J. L. Morison, <span class="italic">Reginald Pecock's Book of Faith</span>, 1909), he claimed to have engaged in debate with important members of the sect. He also claimed that his writings had been read by some Lollards. In <span class="italic">The Repressor</span> he wrote that he had conducted an inquiry into personal and sexual morality among Lollards, in order to expose the hypocrisy of their claims to honest living.<h2>
<a name="BishopofStAsaphandChichester"></a>Bishop of St Asaph and Chichester</h2>Pecock's tenure at Whittington College ended when he was provided to the see of St Asaph on 22 April 1444. The temporalities of the see were transferred to him on 8 June, and he was enthroned bishop at Croydon on 14 June 1444. Gascoigne wrote that he was promoted through the influence of secular lords. Pecock's involvement with John Somerset's foundation of a chapel under royal patronage, and his connection with John Carpenter of Oriel, also an associate of Somerset's and at one time clerk and chaplain to the king, may have provided an entry for Pecock into royal spheres of influence and thus made him a candidate for a see.<br>
<br>It appears that Pecock was largely an absentee bishop, continuing to reside in London. There is no firm evidence that he visited his diocese. The bishop's palace and houses, burned by Owen Glyn D&#373;r in 1402, had still not been rebuilt. It appears that he continued to pursue his interests in London. These included mounting a defence of absentee bishops who (like himself) did not preach to their flocks in their dioceses. Probably in 1447, he delivered a sermon at Paul's Cross in London, arguing that prelates were not obliged to preach in their own dioceses, but that their duties did involve explicating complex points of doctrine. Afterwards he distributed his conclusions in English on this and the other contentious matter of bishops' payment of first-fruits.<br>
<br>Traditionally the butt of anti-clerical criticism, absentee bishops were a particularly sensitive issue during this period, when court prelates such as Adam Moleyns (<i>d</i>. 1450) were the targets of anti-Lancastrian action. By seeming to defend such bishops Pecock became vulnerable to popular anti-clericalism. Controversy ensued, including the charge that his conclusions were heretical, and as a consequence Pecock appeared before Archbishop John Stafford of Canterbury (<i>d</i>. 1452), threatening to sue his opponents for defamation. A record of the statement that Pecock made to Stafford has survived as the <span class="italic">Abrenunciacio Reginaldi Pecok</span> in the notebook of William Mede, monk at the Charterhouse at Sheen  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Bodley 177, fols. 11&#150;13<i>r</i>; part edited under the erroneous title <span class="italic">Abbreviatio Reginaldi Pecok</span> in C. Babington, <span class="italic">The Repressor</span>, 2.615&#150;9).<br>
<br>Pecock explained that his motive had been to defend bishops against undue criticism. Gascoigne, keen to associate Pecock with unpopular court bishops, claimed that Pecock sent copies of his conclusions to Walter Lyhert, bishop of Norwich (<i>d</i>. 1472), Adam Moleyns, bishop of Chichester, and the papal subdeacon Vincent Clement. Pecock said that he believed he had the support of bishops, and if Gascoigne's testimony is correct, it is possible that Pecock expected Moleyns and Lyhert to use their influence at court, and the papal subdeacon to support his defence of bishops' payments of first-fruits to the pope.<br>
<br>Pecock said that he was only prepared to recognize opposition presented in academic form. Indeed, his opponents as named by Gascoigne were highly educated, graduate clerics: William Millington, Thomas Eborall, John Burbach, Hugh Damlett, Gilbert Worthington, William Lichefield, and Peter Hyrford. As well as sharing opposition to Pecock, several of them held powerful positions as rectors of London churches (Eborall was Pecock's successor at Whittington College), and some were involved with new educational and religious foundations. Pecock apparently preached on the issue again in 1449, and instigated a preaching campaign in his diocese.<br>
<br>While bishop of St Asaph, Pecock continued to be associated with a network of powerful courtiers and London citizens, particularly through transactions associated with the foundation dedicated to the Nine Orders of Angels. Such connections may be sufficient to explain his provision to the see of Chichester by a bull of Pope Nicholas V (<i>r</i>. 1447&#150;55) dated 23 March 1450. When he was enthroned as bishop of Chichester on 31 May 1450, he became one of very few Welsh clerics to hold English sees in the fifteenth century. The vacancy had arisen because the previous incumbent, Adam Moleyns, the unpopular associate of the disgraced William de la Pole, duke of Suffolk, had just been murdered. The view that William de la Pole was one of Pecock's patrons at this time was retailed later by Pecock's enemies, Gascoigne in particular. There is no evidence to support it. However, this representation of Pecock as one of a corrupt circle against whom popular feeling was legitimately strong was an important element in his downfall.<br>
<br>No register survives either from Pecock's time as bishop of St Asaph or from his tenure of Chichester. The fact that the authorities later suspected that Pecock's writings might be circulating in the latter diocese suggests that Pecock may have been more involved in affairs in the diocese of Chichester than he had been in those of St Asaph. However, as bishop of Chichester, Pecock continued to write. He was at work on part of <span class="italic">The Folewer to the Donet</span>, a sequel to <span class="italic">The Donet</span>  (BL, Royal MS 17 D.ix; ed. E. V. Hitchcock, EETS, o.s. 164, 1924) about 1453, when he wrote a passage that suggests that the controversy over non-preaching bishops was still not concluded. According to Gascoigne, Pecock was brought before John Kemp (archbishop of Canterbury, 1452&#150;4) to defend his conclusions. Gascoigne also claimed that Pecock returned to the theme in a letter to the Franciscan friar William Goddard, in which Pecock called modern preachers &#145;pulpit-bawlers&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Accusationsofheresy"></a>Accusations of heresy</h2>As bishop of Chichester, Pecock attracted the suspicion of authorities outside the church, and his activities and opinions were brought to the attention of the crown. On one occasion, according to Gascoigne, an unnamed Oxford scholar, convicted of heresy, confessed to William, abbot of Abingdon, that he had learned all his heresies from Pecock, and Pecock's friends were obliged to protest his innocence to the king. In another incident, in 1456, Pecock reputedly wrote a letter to Thomas Canynges, mayor of London, that was forwarded to the king. Allegedly Pecock claimed that he and his English books had adherents among the magnates of the kingdom. His letter was thought to manifest an undermining of the faith and insurrection in the kingdom, and Pecock was expelled from the council chamber.<br>
<br>John Beaumont, Viscount Beaumont (<i>d</i>. 1460), also wrote to Henry VI about Pecock, probably in 1457. In a letter that survives in the register of Richard Asshton, abbot of Peterborough, he said that it was rumoured that the bishop of Chichester was imprinting pernicious doctrines against the faith in men's hearts, and he urged the king to demand that the archbishop of Canterbury and his fellow prelates should commission university scholars to investigate Pecock's writings. Beaumont&#151;appointed Queen Margaret's steward while Henry VI was suffering from a bout of insanity, Prince Edward was an infant, and the queen feared that Richard, duke of York (<i>d</i>. 1460), might seek to claim the throne&#151;was probably acting in Margaret's interests. He may have thought that action against an unpopular prelate would help to restore royal authority. Pecock was an ideal target, both because he had himself attracted anti-clerical feeling, and also because he had tried to repress criticism of bishops in ways which appeared to compromise the authority and teachings of the church. In his letter to the king Beaumont represented the exceptional act of prosecuting a bishop for heresy as a measure that would devolve to the honour, authority, and long continuance of the Lancastrian dynasty. This suggests that an important motive behind Pecock's prosecution was the political one of bolstering the position of the Lancastrian dynasty.<h2>
<a name="Trialandconviction"></a>Trial and conviction</h2>The process of examining Pecock's writings had begun by October 1457, by when Pecock had delivered certain of his English works to Archbishop Thomas Bourchier (<i>d</i>. 1486). The suspect texts were English and Latin writings which had been in circulation over the previous two decades or more. Pecock declined to stand by earlier, uncorrected works that had gone into circulation, guaranteeing only those written in the previous three years. He submitted for examination nine books which had evidently been recently revised. During this process Pecock complained to Bourchier that many were preaching and teaching that the views expressed in his books were heretical. Opposition had been expressed at Paul's Cross in London and throughout the province of Canterbury, even though the case was <i>sub judice</i>. On 22 October 1457 Bourchier issued a citation to all the clergy in his province, calling Pecock's accusers to make their case before himself, and to desist otherwise from public comment.<br>
<br>The most substantial survival from the examination of Pecock's writings is John Bury's <span class="italic">Gladius Salomonis</span>, a refutation of the first book of Pecock's <span class="italic">Repressor</span>. Bury addressed his work to Bourchier and marked it for the attention of John Lowe, bishop of Rochester (<i>d</i>. 1467), described as the archbishop's calm and stalwart companion in troubled times. On 11 November 1457 the masters of Oxford University requested the opportunity to examine Pecock's works, and asked for inspection copies. Pecock had allegedly asked for his works to be examined by his academic equals, but the masters' request need not be seen as the public support that he may have hoped for from the university, so much as a calculation of political self-interest on their own part. In a general procession in Oxford, on 17 December 1457, Pecock's books were denounced, and perhaps even burnt, before the chancellor, Thomas Chaundler (<i>d</i>. 1490).<br>
<br>The process of examining Pecock's writings concluded with the formulation of a list of heresies which Pecock was given the opportunity to abjure. In late November or early December 1457 he appeared before Bourchier and other bishops, and admitted to and revoked his heresies and errors in a signed statement. He then made a public recantation of his heresies in English at Paul's Cross and committed his books to a fire.<br>
<br>The details of the heresies vary in the sources. All copies of the recantation record two points of heresy concerning the authority of the church: that the church could err in matters of faith, and that Christians need not hold to the determinations of a general council of the church on matters of faith. Four other points, not attested in all sources, relate to the apostles' creed. These were that it was not necessary to believe in Christ's descent into hell; in the Holy Ghost; in the holy Catholic church; and in the communion of saints. A seventh point is attested in the <span class="italic">Registrum abbatiae Johannis Whethamstede</span> only, that it was not necessary to believe in any other sense of scripture than the literal sense. John Foxe cites a point not attested in the medieval sources, that it was not necessary to believe in the materiality of the body of Christ in the sacrament. The heresies listed have the appearance of travesties of some of Pecock's statements in <span class="italic">The Book of Faith</span>, rather than being genuine points of theological heterodoxy. There is no record that Pecock attempted to contest the charges.<h2>
<a name="Lossofepiscopalsee"></a>Loss of episcopal see</h2>It is possible that Pecock thought it advisable to accept the offer of recantation, believing that once he had abjured he would be allowed to resume his bishopric. Bourchier may have indicated as much. Indeed, after Pecock's recantation the archbishop sent John Stokes, bishop of Ely, to absolve him and restore him to his see. This was ratified on 13 June 1458 in a bull of Pope Calixtus III (<i>r</i>. 1455&#150;8). The evidence suggests that the crown opposed his reinstatement, supporting the view that Pecock's prosecution served Lancastrian political interests. A letter sent to Bourchier in the king's name, dated 17 September 1458, claimed that the bull was contrary to the <span class="roman">Statute of Provisors</span> and the royal prerogative. The archbishop was commanded to convene a meeting to consider the legal redress available to the crown. Thomas Bird, Pecock's successor in the see of St Asaph, Robert Stillington, a canon of Wells, Hugh Damlett, Pecock's long-standing opponent, and other doctors of divinity or law numbering about twenty in total, recommended that the king should request Pecock's removal from Chichester on the grounds that his translation to the see in 1450 had been void because he had been a heretic at that time. On 27 September 1458 the crown offered Pecock a pension on condition that he would renounce his claim to his see. If he did not, an appeal would be made to Rome. Probably Pecock refused. On 8 January 1459 Pope Pius II (<i>r</i>. 1458&#150;64) provided John Arundel (<i>d</i>. 1477), the king's physician and chaplain, to the see of Chichester, which was considered vacant because Pecock had been a heretic when translated to the see.<h2>
<a name="Attempteddestructionofwritings"></a>Attempted destruction of writings</h2>Meanwhile the church authorities were seeking out any adherents of Pecock and copies of his works. Thomas Bourchier asked all bishops in the province of Canterbury to search for and seize any books by Pecock, and to note the names of their owners. Two of Pecock's alleged adherents, Thomas Lempster and John Harlowe, were casualties. In both cases the influence of the crown in the process against them is apparent.<br>
<br>After his recantation Pecock came under suspicion of hiding his writings for posterity. In response to the concerns expressed by the crown and certain nobles and prelates, Pius II issued a mandate on 7 April 1459 ordering an investigation into the alleged concealment of the books by Pecock and others. If Pecock was found to be concealing his works he should be sent to Rome for punishment or, if it was not possible to punish him in this way, he should be deprived of all the trappings of the episcopal order. It is clear from the pope's mandate that the authorities sought to extinguish Pecock's influence by taking his writings out of circulation.<br>
<br>Archbishop Bourchier issued a warning to adherents and put in hand, under the close eye of the crown, the final arrangements for depriving Pecock of the status of bishop. Pecock was sent to Thorney Abbey near Peterborough. On Bourchier's instructions he was to be assigned a private chamber and was to be allowed no visitors unless they were authorized by the king or archbishop. The only books he was to be allowed were service books, a psalter, a legendary, and a <span class="roman">Bible</span>. He was not permitted to have writing materials. In all likelihood he died at Thorney, in or shortly after 1459.<br>
<br>The attempts to eradicate Pecock's literary influence were evidently partially successful. From references in his extant writings and in the prosecution documents it appears that Pecock wrote many works that have not survived (a list of works presumed lost is provided by Green, 238&#150;45). Apart from the six books mentioned above only a few fragments are extant: the material related to the preaching scandal in the <span class="italic">Abrenunciacio Reginaldi Pecok</span>, and extracts apparently from <span class="italic">The Boke of Sygnes</span> printed by John Foxe, <span class="italic">Commentarii rerum</span>, 1, fols. 199<i>v</i>&#150;200<i>r</i>. Pecock's correspondence with William Goddard is last recorded in the seventeenth century. Nevertheless, one of the most remarkable achievements of Pecock's career is the sheer volume of what has survived. Despite the zealous campaign against him, his six surviving works comprise an extant <i>&#339;uvre</i> larger than that of any other identified author of original Middle English prose.<h2>
<a name="Explanationfordownfall"></a>Explanation for downfall</h2>Convicted of heresy on the evidence of his writings, Pecock became the only bishop before the Reformation to lose his see as a heretic. The explanation for Pecock's downfall has been a matter for debate. The tradition in modern historiography that he was a victim of a Yorkist plot because he was an associate of William de la Pole, duke of Suffolk, yielded to the view that the motive for his prosecution was theological rather than political. Both interpretations have been challenged in the light of Beaumont's letter and other prosecution documents (preserved in Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 789), which reveal that the impetus came from the crown. In this interpretation the Lancastrian dynasty saw the prosecution of Pecock as an opportunity to restore its royal authority by directing powerful anti-clerical feeling to its own ends.<br>
