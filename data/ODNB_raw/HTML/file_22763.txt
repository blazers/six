</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Price,  Robert</span>  (1655&#150;1733), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was born in the parish of Cerrigydrudion, Denbighshire, on 14 January 1655, the second son of Thomas Price (<i>d</i>. before 1670) of Gilar, Denbighshire, and Margaret (1633/4&#150;1723), daughter and heir of Thomas Wynne of Bwlchybeudy, Denbighshire. He was educated at Ruthin grammar school before entering St John's College, Cambridge, on 28 March 1672, aged seventeen. He entered Lincoln's Inn on 8 May 1673. In 1677 Price joined Lord Lexington on a journey to Europe, which saw him visit Paris in the spring of 1678, and then move on to Florence and Rome. While in Rome one of Price's legal texts was mistaken for an English <span class="roman">Bible</span> and he was carried before the pope; on explaining the situation he presented the book to the pope, who placed it in the Vatican Library. Price returned home in 1679 and on 23 September married Lucy (<i>d</i>. 1736), the eldest daughter and coheir of Robert Rodd, of Foxley, Yazor, Herefordshire. They had two sons and a daughter. Price was called to the bar on 28 October 1679. When his wife's father died in 1681 Price bought out the other Rodd coheirs and established himself at Foxley. He also erected and endowed an almshouse for six poor people in the parish of Cerrigydrudion.<br>
<br>Price had a successful legal practice, numbering among his clients such influential figures as the first duke of Beaufort, a leading Welsh territorial magnate. Beaufort was presumably important in obtaining for Price several local offices which became available as the tory reaction set in during Charles II's later years. He became a common councilman at Hereford in 1682, and under the new Hereford charter of 1683 he was named an alderman, and in the following year became recorder of New Radnor and attorney-general for south Wales. At the general election following the accession of James II, Price was returned as a court supporter on 19 March 1685 at Weobley. Price became steward to Queen Catherine of Braganza. Local office also came his way as he became steward of Shrewsbury and he replaced a Beaufort opponent as town clerk of Gloucester in September 1685. In 1686 he became a member of the council in the marches of Wales. James II's first declaration of indulgence was a turning point in Price's career as his refusal to read it led to his dismissal as town clerk of Gloucester. Both Lord Chancellor Jeffreys and the king were politely rebuffed when they closeted Price in an attempt to persuade him to support repeal of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>. As a result he lost his place as steward of Shrewsbury under the new charter of January 1688, but he kept his other places and was approved by James II's agents as a court candidate for the abortive elections due in 1688.<br>
<br>Price supported the revolution of 1688, subscribing &pound;20 to the Herefordshire loan to the prince of Orange. However, his election campaign for the convention of 1689 was derailed by the discovery that in James II's records he was accounted a supporter of repealing the test and penal laws. He petitioned against his defeat, but with little chance of success he withdrew the petition. There were other distractions, too, at this time as in November 1690 Price received &pound;1500 in damages in a suit against &#145;Mr Neale, the groom porter's son&#146;, for &#145;enticing&#146; away his wife and &#145;getting her with child&#146;  (Luttrell, <span class="italic">Brief Historical Relation</span>, 2.131).<br>
<br>Price was re-elected for Weobley in 1690 and retained his seat with one short interruption until 1702. He soon carved out a new career for himself as a tory critic of the government in parliament, which he combined with legal advocacy in the law courts. Thus he spoke on the <span class="roman">Treason Trials Bill</span> in 1692; on the <span class="roman">Bill of Accounts</span> and the <span class="roman">Indemnity Bill</span> in 1693; and acted as defence counsel for Lord Mohun during his trial for the murder of the actor William Mountford in 1693. More famously, he was at the forefront of attempts to prevent the king from granting large estates in Wales to his Dutch favourite the earl of Portland. Price opposed the grant in the Treasury, arguing his case in May 1695. On 14 January 1696 he presented a petition from the freeholders and inhabitants of Denbighshire against the grant, and secured an address to the king which persuaded him to find an alternative means of rewarding Portland. Price's speech on this occasion was subsequently published after the king's death in 1702 under the title <span class="italic">Gloria Cambriae, or, The Speech of a Bold Briton in Parliament Against a Dutch Prince of Wales</span>. He cited General Monck in support of his opposition to including an abjuration oath in the bill establishing a Board of Trade in January 1696. Price was a notable opponent of proceeding against the Jacobite plotter Sir John Fenwick by parliamentary bill of attainder. He refused the voluntary association in 1696. In 1699 he was one of those members who compiled a blacklist of those voting against the <span class="roman">Disbanding Bill</span> which was later published.<br>
<br>The inclusion of some tories in the ministry in 1700 saw Price appointed a Welsh judge, as second justice on the Brecon circuit, an appointment he himself thought due to the influence of Robert Harley. However, it was with the accession of Queen Anne that he achieved important office. In June 1702 he was created a serjeant-at-law, and on 24 June he was named as a baron of the exchequer, and henceforth he had to give up his parliamentary career. However, he retained his interest in politics, helping Harley to lobby against the tack in November 1704. As a judge, Price gave a minority opinion in February 1705 in the <i>Ashby v. White</i> case, arguing that a writ of error could be refused as it was not a right but an act of grace from the prince. According to Thomas Hearne, Price delivered a charge to a Hampshire grand jury in 1705<blockquote>in which he took notice of the slanders and aspersions of the fanatic party in the libels etc cast on the Church of England, and reminded them that the present liberty which they enjoyed was purely the effect of the bounty of the Church of England. (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 2.28)</blockquote>Given the tone of such public pronouncements, Price's hopes, opined to Harley, of being raised to the court of common pleas in August 1705 were bound to remain unfulfilled. His prospects improved under the ministry headed by Harley from 1710 to 1714 but Harley seems to have used Price as a Welsh parliamentary whip and he was not promoted.<br>
<br>Following the accession of George I, Price was reappointed to office, the result no doubt of his cultivation of the reversionary interest to the throne through his sons. Price was one of the judges sent to Carlisle to preside over the trial of Scottish Jacobites in December 1716; while there he suffered from gout, his fellow judge Tracy reporting that he had a &#145;little weakness remaining in his feet&#146;  (BL, Stowe 750, fol. 226). In 1717 he built a new house at Foxley. Again he was willing to provide a minority opinion from this bench, this time in January 1718 against the king's belief that he could educate his grandchildren. On 20 October 1726 he was promoted to be a justice of common pleas, and he was reappointed following the accession of George II in the following year. Price died at Kensington on 2 February 1733, and was buried at Yazor in Herefordshire. His elder son, Thomas, who had succeeded him as MP for Weobley in 1702, died in Genoa in 1706, leaving the other son, Uvedale Tomkyns Price, as his heir. His daughter, Lucy, married Bampfield Rodd.<br>
