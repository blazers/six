<span class="headword">Stephen, Sir  George</span>  (1794&#150;1879), <span class="occ">lawyer and slavery abolitionist</span>, was born on 17 January 1794 on St Kitts, West Indies, the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26373/', "James Stephen (1758&#150;1832)")</script>, later master in chancery, and his wife, Anna (<i>bap</i>. 1758, <i>d</i>. 1796), the daughter of Henry Stent. His parents returned to England with him when he was an infant. He was educated at private schools at Clapham Common and Cheam. At the age of fifteen he began training under a surgeon to qualify for an army medical appointment, but on the prospect of peace in 1813 he was sent to Magdalene College, Cambridge, with a view to becoming a physician. He showed more taste for hunting than for study, however, and was removed after two years and placed in the office of J. W. Freshfield, afterwards solicitor to the Bank of England. On 17 March 1821 he married Henrietta (1797&#150;1869), the daughter of Revd William Ravenscroft; they had seven children.<br>
<br>During five years' articles, Stephen managed his firm's extensive bankruptcy business and, when he began practice on his own, the firm handed much of that business to him. During the parliamentary inquiry in 1820 into the conduct of Queen Caroline he was employed by the government to collect evidence against her on the continent.<br>
<br>In 1826, declining remuneration, Stephen was retained by the House of Commons to investigate allegations that slaves were being traded at Mauritius. That had been made unlawful in 1807, but slavery itself was still prevalent in some British colonies, notably in the West Indies. Stephen, following his father, had become prominent in the Anti-Slavery Society and was its honorary solicitor. Hitherto, the committee had worked towards abolition by direct persuasion of parliamentarians; in 1831 Stephen proposed appealing to the people. His proposal was rejected by the committee but taken up by James Cropper and others, who provided funds. A small working group, including Stephen, employed agents to arrange and address public meetings and to inspire press publicity, the formation of local societies, and the promotion of petitions. The ensuing agitation persuaded the government: the act to abolish slavery in British colonies was passed in 1833. Stephen was knighted in 1838 for his services.<br>
<br>Stephen was solicitor in a scheme for the relief of paupers in contempt of court, without remuneration, and also acted for a society for the purchase of reversions; however, he quarrelled with the directors and was dismissed, losing a considerable sum. Disliking aspects of his profession, resenting its inferior social status, and struggling somewhat in his practice, he decided in 1847 to abandon it. He was called to the bar at Gray's Inn on 6 June 1849 and settled at Liverpool, where he acquired a fair practice in bankruptcy cases.<br>
<br>But Stephen's work fell away on a change in the system, and in 1855 he emigrated to Melbourne, Victoria, where he joined his two younger sons. He was admitted to practise as a barrister there on the same day (9 August 1855) as was his eldest son, James Wilberforce (1822&#150;1881), who emigrated with him and afterwards became a judge of the supreme court of Victoria.<br>
<br>Stephen built a house named Helenslea (now a school) in Glen Eira Road, Caulfield, near Melbourne. He obtained some practice, principally in insolvency work, and was appointed queen's counsel on 12 June 1871. A prominent Anglican, he died on 20 June 1879 at Helenslea and was buried in St Kilda cemetery, Melbourne, on 23 June.<br>
<br>Stephen was a man of considerable abilities and force of character. He was upright and outspoken, but a hot temper and a talent for seeing the worst side of people and his profession involved him in many disputes and injured his career. He wrote many books and pamphlets, mostly on aspects of religion, law, or slavery. <span class="italic">Adventures of a Gentleman in Search of a Horse</span> (1835), a light exposition of the relevant law, and <span class="italic">Adventures of an Attorney in Search of Practice</span> (1839), shrewd and wryly amusing, were particularly successful. His <span class="italic">Anti-slavery Recollections</span> remains a major authority.<br>
