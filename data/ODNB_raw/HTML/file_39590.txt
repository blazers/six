<span class="headword">Cetshwayo <span class="st"> [Cetewayo]</span> ka Mpande</span>  (<em>c.</em>1826&#150;1884), <span class="occ">king of the Zulu</span>, the eldest son of King Mpande (<i>d</i>. 1872) and Ngqumbazi, daughter of the Zungu chief Mbondi, was born at his father's Mlambongwenya homestead near Eshowe.<br>
<br>As a young man Cetshwayo secured the succession to the Zulu kingdom (founded by his uncle Shaka) after the fratricidal battle at Ndondakusuka in 1856 in which he defeated and killed six of his brothers, including his chief rival, Mbuyazi. Thousands of Mbuyazi's followers were killed or fled southwards to Natal. In 1861, in an attempt to bolster his authority against possible usurpers from the south, Cetshwayo invited Natal's secretary for native affairs, Theophilus Shepstone, to recognize his future succession, and the colony became increasingly involved in Zulu affairs. From then Cetshwayo increasingly took control of the kingdom, although he only became king formally in 1872 when his father died. Cetshwayo had a considerable number of wives, many of whom he married to forge diplomatic ties. His chief wife was the daughter of Seketwayo, chief of the Mdlalose; but it was another spouse, Novimbi Msweli, a commoner, who gave birth in 1868 to the son who was to succeed him, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53757/', "Dinizulu (sometimes spelt Dinuzulu)")</script>.<br>
<br>At the time of Cetshwayo's accession, Zululand was still a comparatively self-sufficient, independent state, although it was beginning to feel pressures from traders and missionaries, and especially from Transvaal Afrikaners encroaching on the river valleys of the north-west in search of grazing. Hoping to secure Natal's support against the Transvaal and to stave off usurpers Cetshwayo invited Theophilus Shepstone to preside over his formal installation in 1873. Shepstone took the opportunity to impose unilateral &#145;guidelines&#146; on the king; these provided the justification for the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879, when the British high commissioner, Sir Bartle Frere, who saw the kingdom as an obstacle to the confederation of southern Africa and believed Cetshwayo to be instigating a pan-African conspiracy to overthrow white rule, presented Cetshwayo with an ultimatum demanding <i>inter alia</i> the disbanding of his army within thirty days, and the implementation of these coronation laws. Compliance would have spelt the destruction of the kingdom and on 11 January 1879 British troops invaded Zululand.<br>
<br>After a series of early British defeats, the most spectacular being that at Isandlwana, the Zulu were finally defeated on 4 July at the first battle of Ulundi, and Cetshwayo was captured and exiled to the Cape. Largely as a result of his brilliant diplomacy and the influence of carefully cultivated supporters, as well as the sympathy his imposing presence aroused when he appeared before Queen Victoria in mid-1882, at the beginning of 1883 the king was returned to a Zululand torn by civil war between his supporters and the chiefs the British had appointed in his stead.<br>
<br>Restored to a portion of his former kingdom, and confronted by a large number of powerful enemies, Cetshwayo was unable to re-establish peace. On 20 July 1883 his followers were defeated at the second battle of Ulundi and most of his senior councillors killed. Cetshwayo again fled but when British troops entered the country, he surrendered himself to the protection of the British resident commissioner. He died in captivity at Eshowe on 8 February 1884&#151;of heart disease, according to the military doctor; his followers believed he had been poisoned. He was buried in a sacred grove in the Nkandhla forests, southern Zululand.<br>
<br>Cetshwayo was much maligned in his lifetime, but later historians have generally seen him as a highly intelligent and dignified man, who ruled his people well. After his death continued turbulence led to the British annexation of Zululand in 1887 and its incorporation into Natal ten years later.<br>
