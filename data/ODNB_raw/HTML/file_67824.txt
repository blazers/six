<span class="headword">Dresdel,  Sonia</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Lois Obee]</span>  (1909&#150;1976), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 5 May 1909 in Hornsea, East Riding of Yorkshire, the daughter of John Henry Obee (<i>b</i>. 1868/9), a music-seller, and his wife, Florence Binks. Shortly afterwards the family moved to Grimsby and thence, in 1915, to Aberdeen, where she was educated at the girls' high school, and in 1926&#150;7 studied briefly at the university before opting for a stage career; she entered the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1930. Having completed her training and won the Kendal prize, she made her professional d&eacute;but in 1931 as Rosalie Quilter in Walter Ellis's farce <span class="italic">Almost a Honeymoon</span>. She subsequently worked in provincial repertory theatres, seen as the accredited apprenticeship for any aspiring performer, throughout the 1930s. She was engaged for the 1931&#150;2 season at the New Theatre, Northampton, then spent five years with the White Rose Players at Harrogate, and finally acted in similar companies managed by H. M. Tennent in Edinburgh and Glasgow. In August 1939 she joined the Old Vic company, first appearing at the Buxton festival as Abigail in Norman Ginsbury's <span class="italic">Viceroy Sarah</span> and reappearing with them in October at the Streatham Hill Theatre, London, and later on tour, in this and other parts, including Lady Capulet in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, Judith Anderson in G. B. Shaw's <span class="italic">The Devil's Disciple</span>, the Duchess de la Tr&eacute;mouille in his <span class="italic">Saint Joan</span>, and Olivia in Oliver Goldsmith's <span class="italic">The Good-Natured Man</span>. She again toured with the Old Vic in 1940 and 1941, playing Viola in <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span>, Portia in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, Lady Faulconbridge in <span class="italic">King John</span>, and the eponymous heroine in an adaptation of Du Maurier's <span class="italic">Trilby</span>.<br>
<br>In September of the following year this early promise came to fruition with an outstanding interpretation of Hedda Gabler at the Mercury&#151;a sensitive, highly intelligent performance which drew rhapsodic praise from no less fastidious a critic than James Agate. Dresdel followed it in November with a shrewdly calculating Millamant in William Congreve's <span class="italic">The Way of the World</span>, also directed by Ashley Dukes at the Mercury, in 1943 with an exquisitely flirtatious Clotilde in his version of Henry Becque's <span class="italic">La Parisienne</span> at the St James's, and in January 1944 scored an even more remarkable success, particularly in box-office terms, as Olivia Russell in Joan Morgan's <span class="italic">The Dark Potential</span> at the Q. Retitled <span class="italic">This was a Woman</span> for its transfer in March to the Comedy, this melodramatic story of a homicidally paranoid and manipulative suburban housewife ran in war-damaged London for almost a year. It was a success which proved a mixed blessing in that it identified Dresdel with the persona of the villainess or heartless conniver and initiated a strain of type-casting which never quite deserted her. It also created a pattern for the next phase of her working life, characterized by leading roles in a succession of unmemorable plays for West End commercial managements&#151;leavened by occasional revivals such as W. S. Maugham's <span class="italic">The Sacred Flame</span> at the St Martin's in November 1945, in which she played the repressed Nurse Wayland, and Lev Tolstoy's <span class="italic">The Power of Darkness</span> at the Lyric in April 1949, in which she was cast as the murderous, adulterous Anisya, and several productions at the Arts Theatre Club. Other highlights during this period were her appearances at two Edinburgh festivals&#151;in 1950 as Juno in the premi&egrave;re of James Bridie's <span class="italic">The Queen's Comedy</span> and in 1955, when she repeated her Hedda&#151;a tour of Australia with James Parish's <span class="italic">Message for Margaret</span> in 1951, and in 1958 a further tour of South Africa and Kenya with <span class="italic">Hedda Gabler</span> and Ugo Betti's <span class="italic">The Queen and the Rebels</span>.<br>
<br>The year 1959 signalled an exploratory change of direction, which in the event led nowhere, when Dresdel was appointed director of productions for a season at the Harrogate Theatre, presenting a weekly repertory of routine farces and thrillers interlarded with rather more ambitious fare in plays by John Osborne, Ugo Betti, Terence Rattigan, No&euml;l Coward, Aldous Huxley, and Frederick Lonsdale. Returning to the Old Vic in November 1961 as Christine Mannon in Eugene O'Neill's <span class="italic">Mourning Becomes Electra</span>, she gave an electrifying performance which the <span class="italic">Times</span> reviewer described as &#145;a bravura display of Christine's rattlesnake charms and quick threatening tensities&#146;  (22 Dec 1961) and which persuaded another commentator to designate her &#145;actress of the year&#146;. Between October 1963 and August 1965 she appeared in five productions at the Mermaid, enabling her to demonstrate some of the versatility for which the majority of her stage work allowed little scope: as Varvara Stavrogin in Albert Camus's version of Dostoyevsky's <span class="italic">The Possessed</span>, Amalia in Luigi Pirandello's <span class="italic">Right You Are! (If You Think So)</span>, Jocasta in Sophocles' <span class="italic">Oedipus the King</span>, Queen Eleanor in John Arden's <span class="italic">Left-Handed Liberty</span>, and Georgina Tidman in Sir Arthur Wing Pinero's <span class="italic">Dandy Dick</span>. In the last decade of her life her most notable performances were as the erupting woman spectator in Robert Shaw's <span class="italic">The Man in the Glass Booth</span> at the St Martin's in July 1967 and Judith Bliss in No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">Hay Fever</span> at the Bristol Old Vic in August 1970. She also appeared frequently on television and rarely without distinction, whether in single plays, series, or classic adaptations, but was poorly served by the cinema, making only twelve films; only two, <span class="italic">The Fallen Idol</span> (1948, as the evil Mrs Baines) and <span class="italic">The Trials of Oscar Wilde</span> (1960, as Lady Wilde), offered her any creative stimulus.<br>
<br>Sonia Dresdel's leisure time was spent gardening at her home, Ransley House, Mersham, Kent. She died in the Kent and Canterbury Hospital, Canterbury, on 18 January 1976. In reviewing her career it is difficult not to account her an unlucky actress who never fully realized her considerable potential. Despite her obvious gifts&#151;a riveting stage presence, a dynamic yet velvet-like voice, and a sustained emotional power which some thought excessive, but was eminently theatrical&#151;she found herself progressively under-employed and under-extended, denied the opportunity in her prime to measure herself against the great tragic roles, so that one can only speculate upon what she might have made of Lady Macbeth, Ph&egrave;dre, or Medea. Nevertheless, she remained an accomplished artiste, who set an example of professionalism and left behind a worthy record of achievement.<br>
