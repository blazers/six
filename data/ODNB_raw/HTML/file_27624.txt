<span class="headword">Townshend,  George</span>, first Marquess Townshend  (1724&#150;1807), <span class="occ">politician and caricaturist</span>, was born on 28 February 1724 in London, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27618/', "Charles Townshend, third Viscount Townshend (1700&#150;1764)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27617/', "Townshend, Charles, second Viscount Townshend")</script>], politician, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68358/', "Etheldreda Townshend (c.1708&#150;1788)")</script>, the daughter and sole heir of Edward Harrison of Balls Park, Hertfordshire. George I was one of the sponsors at his baptism, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, 25 March 1725. The future chancellor of the exchequer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27619/', "Charles Townshend")</script> was his younger brother. He was educated at Eton College and St John's College, Cambridge, whence he graduated MA on 3 July 1749. Regarded by contemporaries as a very handsome man, Townshend is described by Sir Lewis Namier as &#145;warm hearted, sensitive and capable of enthusiasms, but unsteady and odd, intermittently ambitious, often disgruntled, quarrelsome, lacking in judgment, and burdened with an insuperable urge to ridicule, the resort of the intelligent under oppression&#146;  (Namier 549).<h2>
<a name="Earlymilitarycareer"></a>Early military career</h2>In summer 1743, while on the grand tour of Europe, Townshend joined the army in Flanders as a volunteer. Two years later he was offered the command of a regiment and in April was appointed captain in the 7th regiment of dragoons. He was serving under the duke of Cumberland, and his Pelhamite relations (his paternal grandmother was a half-sister of the duke of Newcastle) took the opportunity to foster this connection. His parents had separated in March 1741, and, unlike his brother Charles, he had remained close to his mother, a woman known for her wit and promiscuity, her dislike of Cumberland, and her sympathy for the Jacobite cause. To counter her influence, George Townshend was placed in the care of the Cumberland family, a move that was to benefit his military career. He served under Cumberland at Culloden on 16 April 1746, and in the following February he became aide-de-camp to the duke. At the same time he transferred to the 20th foot, and after fighting in the battle of Laufeld on 2 July he moved to the 1st foot; on 8 March 1748 he assumed the office of lieutenant-colonel. However, this stage of his military career was brought to an end by a disagreement with Cumberland, possibly over the treatment of another junior officer.<h2>
<a name="Parliamentarypolitics17491757"></a>Parliamentary politics, 1749&#150;1757</h2>In 1747, while in Flanders, Townshend was elected unopposed as MP for Norfolk, and it was politics that occupied his attention on his return to England. His first recorded parliamentary speech, in February 1749, was in the debate on the <span class="roman">Mutiny Bill</span> when he supported an attack made on Cumberland by Richard Lyttelton, a fellow officer. In the following year Townshend moved that courts martial should replace the commanding officer as the authority empowered to punish non-commissioned and private officers. This was another thinly disguised attack on Cumberland, and, though it was backed by the prince of Wales's party, it was defeated. This year also saw Townshend leave the army, reputedly over the refusal to allow him to stay and cultivate the whig interest in Norfolk. However, his dispute with Cumberland continued and was compounded in 1751 after the publication of a pamphlet titled <span class="italic">A Brief Narrative of the Late Campaigns in Germany and Flanders</span>; this criticized Cumberland's military capability, and was thought to have been written, or at least inspired, by Townshend.<br>
<br>For a short period Townshend became allied with the following of the prince of Wales. But after the prince's death in March 1751 he made peace with the Pelhams, and Newcastle counted him among his supporters. His animosity to Cumberland continued though, and when Henry Fox, his political agent, was appointed secretary of state and leader of the house, Townshend and his brother moved into opposition; they joined William Pitt and the Grenvilles in opposing the address on 13 November 1755. In autumn 1756 Townshend gained political prominence as the foremost supporter of an extension of the militia. He was motivated by his dislike of standing armies and by his determination to strike back at Cumberland. As champion of this populist issue and a respected member of the country gentlemen, he was a valuable asset to Pitt.<br>
<br>After the defeat of his <span class="roman">Militia Bill</span> in the Lords Townshend was responsible for an important innovation in the way the opinions of the voting public were utilized. He sent a circulating letter to the boroughs and corporations instructing them to advise their members to campaign for another militia bill. He was therefore responsible for popularizing a propaganda weapon that would prove invaluable to the parliamentary reform campaign of the 1780s.<br>
<br>During the early months of 1757 Townshend divided his time between resuscitating the <span class="roman">Militia Bill</span> and promoting a parliamentary inquiry into the loss of Minorca. Along with his brother he attempted to encourage opposition &#145;out-of-doors&#146; to the government, focusing on these two issues. His involvement in the ill-fated inquiry enabled him to score points against Henry Fox, particularly after Pitt's dismissal from the ministry.<br>
<br>On 28 June 1757 Townshend's <span class="roman">Militia Bill</span> received royal assent, and he deserved much of the credit for steering it through parliament and for ensuring that it was implemented effectively in the face of strenuous opposition from his father. However, although Townshend remained on good terms with Pitt and had formed a new connection with Bute, his political influence was short-lived, curtailed as it was by the Pitt&#150;Newcastle coalition. Townshend regarded the new administration as a union of competing interests, which had been formed without any declaration of a public system of measures. He was also incensed by the nominal position in the new ministry offered to his enemy Henry Fox. Townshend felt betrayed by his former ally, and he and his brother retired to the country. By now Townshend was married and the father of a growing family. On 19 December 1751 he had married, with a marriage portion of &pound;12,000, Lady Charlotte Compton (<i>d</i>. 1770), the second daughter of James Compton, fifth earl of Northampton, and his wife, Elizabeth Shirley, Baroness Ferrers in her own right. His wife, who had succeeded to her mother's title in 1747, inherited her father's title and his fortune on his death in 1754, since she was by then his sole heir.<h2>
<a name="Politicalcaricaturist"></a>Political caricaturist</h2>Townshend was acutely aware of the importance of propaganda and public opinion, and he used pictorial satire against his enemies to reinforce his political views. During the campaign for the <span class="roman">Militia Bill</span> he had adorned &#145;the shutters, walls, and napkins of every tavern in Pall Mall with caricatures of the Duke [of Cumberland] and Sir George Lyttelton, the Duke of Newcastle and Mr. Fox&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 37.444). Walpole was moved to observe that &#145;his genius for likenesses in caricature is astonishing&#146;  (ibid.). Inspired by the works of Hogarth and Italian <i>caricatura</i>, Townshend was said to have invented a new form of political caricature, depicted on cards. More importantly, according to Walpole, he was the first to introduce personal caricature into political prints. However, it is questionable whether this marked a watershed in visual satire. Diana Donald has argued that it is too simplistic to suggest that he initiated a shift which saw the old emblematic tradition being replaced by more sophisticated personal caricature. Yet Townshend does have a legitimate claim to significance in the development of satirical art. Donald states that his &#145;savage personal lampoons, once engraved and published, transformed <i>caricatura</i> from an innocuous amusement into an offensive weapon in the political feuds of the day&#146;  (Donald, <span class="italic">Age of Caricature</span>, 14). Even so, the full extent of his influence would not be seen until the 1780s&#151;when Gillray and Rowlandson reintroduced parody and the mock-heroic into visual satire.<br>
<br>It is doubtful whether Townshend's ability as a caricaturist advanced his career: George II was displeased by his foray into this world of &#145;low&#146; art, and his pointed satire quickly brought him a number of other enemies. In 1757 a pamphlet titled <span class="italic">An Essay on Political Lying</span> was published in reaction to a print by Townshend, probably by a hireling of Henry Fox. Moreover, the offence caused by his drawings was compounded by what his enemies regarded as his close association with Grub Street, demonstrated by the sponsorship of caricaturists and printsellers such as Mary and Matthew Darly. It was felt that by ridiculing members of his own class he was inciting the mob, and his support of petitioning as a political weapon gave further ammunition to his opponents.<h2>
<a name="ServinginQuebec"></a>Serving in Quebec</h2>Townshend was compensated for his failure to advance in political circles by the retirement of Cumberland. As Townshend's political estrangement from Pitt had been brief, this meant that a resumption of his military career was both a viable and an attractive option. When he applied to be reinstated in the army he was assisted by Pitt; on 6 May 1758 he was promoted to the rank of colonel and became aide-de-camp to George II. Pitt was also instrumental in securing his appointment in February 1759 as brigadier under Major-General James Wolfe, who was responsible for leading an expedition against French-held Quebec. Townshend sailed with Wolfe, reaching Louisburg harbour in May. The expedition then headed for Quebec and Townshend took part in the attack on Montcalm's camp at Montmorenci in late July. After this point, however, the relationship between Townshend and Wolfe deteriorated. Frustrated by their failure to make any real progress in Quebec, Townshend complained to his wife on 6 September from Camp Levi: &#145;General Wolfs health is but very bad. His generalship, in my poor opinion, is not a bit better: this only between us. He never consulted any of us till the latter end of August, so that we have nothing to answer for, I hope, as to the success of this campaign&#146;  (<span class="italic">Townshend MSS</span>, 309). When Wolfe did consult his officers an attack on the north side of the St Lawrence above Quebec was agreed upon. Some sources credit Townshend as the originator of this plan, but it has also been suggested that he advised against it as too hazardous. Townshend led the left wing at the battle on the heights of Abraham, and when Wolfe was killed and Monckton disabled, overall command devolved upon his shoulders. He abandoned the pursuit of the French army, preferring to focus on bringing Quebec to a speedy surrender, which it did on 17 September 1759.<br>
<br>Although Townshend returned as a hero, his victory was tainted by accusations that he had endeavoured to embellish his own part in the battle at the expense of Wolfe. Wolfe, killed heroically on the verge of victory, was a more easily accepted saviour of British Canada. Townshend, as a noted satirist, and a subordinate known to have been on bad terms with Wolfe, came out of the affair badly. Henry Fox and Cumberland were both implicated in the minor pamphlet war that ensued. Indeed Townshend was ready to challenge Lord Albemarle, Cumberland's prot&eacute;g&eacute;, to a duel, subsequently called off, for his part in the business.<h2>
<a name="Politicalcareer17601767"></a>Political career, 1760&#150;1767</h2>Ultimately, Townshend's friendship with Bute prevented the Quebec affair from damaging his political career, and in December 1760 he was sworn of the privy council. He also continued to see military service. Between February and December 1761 he was with the British army in Germany, and he spent much of the second half of 1762 on active service in Portugal. While abroad he corresponded with Bute, and on his return he made it clear that he supported the controversial peace treaty ending the Seven Years' War. However, though he was prepared to speak out on the main issues of the day, when in parliament his primary concern remained the militia.<br>
<br>On 14 March 1763 Townshend became lieutenant-general of the ordnance in the Grenville ministry. He was reasonably firm in his support for Grenville, and in the early days of the administration he did all that he could to persuade his brother to join him in government. However his encouragements succeeded only in alienating Charles. For his own part Townshend avoided becoming involved in the Wilkes affair and general warrants, but as a landowner in a &#145;malt county&#146; he staunchly supported the <span class="roman">Cider Act</span>. This, though, was the end of his career in the Commons as he succeeded his father as fourth Viscount Townshend on 12 March 1764. The death of his father seemed to initiate a process of reconciliation between Townshend and his brother. This was assisted by the fact that Charles was becoming disillusioned with life in opposition and was looking for a place in government. Townshend's own importance was now derived largely from the precocious talents of his brother. Their restored amity allowed him to exert a good deal of influence over his brother's actions. In May 1765 Townshend prepared the way for Charles's inclusion in the Grenville ministry, and on Grenville's fall Townshend was able to persuade Charles to refuse office with the Rockinghams. Charles James Fox claimed that Townshend was motivated by his continued bitterness towards Cumberland and pique at the failure of the Rockinghams to court him.<br>
<br>On the formation of the Chatham ministry, in which Charles was chancellor of the exchequer, Townshend offered his services to the government. After the abortive appointment of Lord Bristol, he became lord lieutenant of Ireland on 19 August 1767, a post to which he had long aspired. He owed his position to the influence of his brother Charles, but contemporaries also cited his connection with Lord Bute.<h2>
<a name="Irishviceroy17671772"></a>Irish viceroy, 1767&#150;1772</h2>During the short-lived Bristol administration in Ireland the Chatham ministry had indicated its determination to make inroads into the power of the Irish undertakers, namely the leading parliamentarians and landowners who undertook to manage government business in return for a share of patronage. But research by Thomas Bartlett has demonstrated that Townshend himself was responsible for the radical policies followed during his administration, though it is clear that the British ministry had been preparing for a change in the Irish system of government for some years. Some doubt remains as to whether Townshend was appointed as a resident lord lieutenant&#151;a measure that would make inroads into undertaker influence.<br>
<br>A failure to clarify the government's Irish policy at a succession of cabinet meetings meant that Townshend's administration began in a state of confusion. This situation was made all the more problematic by the death of Townshend's brother Charles on 4 September, thus removing his only genuinely sympathetic ear in the cabinet. As a result, at a time when sensitive handling of Ireland was vital, the British ministry did all it could to inflame the Irish parliament and damage Townshend's credibility.<br>
<br>The popularity of Townshend's administration was immediately dented by the British ministry's delay in appointing a new Irish lord chancellor, and then by its decision to recommend an Englishman for the post, thus alienating senior Irish legal officers. A simultaneous dispute occurred over the <span class="roman">Judges' Tenure Bill</span>, giving security of tenure to Irish judges during good behaviour, which Townshend, in his speech to the Commons, had announced would be approved by the British ministry. The secretary of state, Lord Shelburne, denied that Townshend had been given this authority, and when the British privy council altered the bill it was rejected.<br>
<br>Townshend's principal task on appointment was to secure an augmentation of the British army in Ireland, in order to bring Irish regiments up to the same size as their British counterparts. This process of standardization was made necessary by gains in the American mid-west and by the adoption of the fixed rotation of regiments in 1765, whereby regiments would rotate throughout the empire and therefore would have to be the same size. However, in Ireland the augmentation was unpopular, as Irish politicians feared that the army was being increased only in order for regiments to be sent abroad, thus denuding Ireland's defence against the Catholic threat. As a palliative Townshend was allowed to accept a bill to limit the term of the Irish parliament to eight years. But his failure to secure undertaker support&#151;as the British ministry refused to accept their patronage demands&#151;and the approaching general election made necessary by the new <span class="roman">Octennial Bill</span>, which made MPs more responsive to public opinion, ensured the defeat of the augmentation on 19 April 1768. Townshend eventually secured its passage on 21 December 1769, after introducing measures to quiet fears of Irish troop losses. But his disagreements with the leading Irish politicians had persuaded him that the reform of the Irish system of government was essential if British influence over its oldest colony was to continue.<br>
<br>Townshend's new system comprised several measures: the viceroy's constant residency; reform of the Irish revenue board; dismissal of recalcitrant office-holders; encouragement of the hereditary revenue; and the creation of a Dublin Castle party loyal to the viceroy. Yet, though parts of this programme were approved by the duke of Grafton, it was not until Lord North was appointed prime minister that Townshend had the full support of the British government. Indeed for a time it seemed likely that Townshend would be replaced by Lord Sandwich, a member of the Bedford group. However, in this case it seems that Townshend received direct support from the king, who had no liking for Sandwich because he was not a man of &#145;blameless character&#146;. It is probable that Townshend had endeared himself to the king through his determination to cut through factional politics in Ireland, putting himself and the Irish government at the king's service.<br>
<br>On 21 November 1769 the British government was given a clear indication of the need to reassert a measure of control over Ireland when the Irish Commons rejected a money bill, explicitly stating that this was because it had not originated in the Commons. Townshend, with the backing of an incensed British ministry, retaliated by proroguing the Irish parliament. The extended parliamentary interval allowed Townshend the opportunity to begin his reforms, but he was not helped by the unpopularity of the prorogation. The suspension of parliament was a political blow to Irish patriotic sentiment and an economic blow to Dublin's business community. The <span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span> printed regular attacks on Townshend and his administration, and Dublin also witnessed a pamphlet war. The anti-Townshend pamphlets written by opposition MPs were published together in <span class="italic">Baratariana</span>, a collection that included references to his caricatures. He was described as a &#145;Tyro of the graphic art&#146;, a man who mixed &#145;malevolence with levity &hellip; dedicating even his <i>smiles</i> to the injury of his companions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Baratariana</span>, 308, 351).<br>
<br>Townshend tried to repair some of this damage by holding balls in aid of Irish manufacture and by promoting Irish trade concessions. But his personal popularity remained low. He had alienated many Irish politicians through his wit and temper. His habit of carousing into the early hours of the morning in Dublin Castle with those not of the first rank was also frowned upon by the Irish &eacute;lite.<br>
<br>Nevertheless Townshend used the interval to his advantage, particularly after the North ministry, in cabinet meetings on 21 February and 24 December, approved his reform programme and thereby created a new board of accounts, dismissed John Ponsonby from the revenue board, and approved the revenue board's division. In order to test the paper majority of Townshend's newly formed Castle party, a short parliamentary session was called in February 1771. Townshend's reforms were vindicated, as the opposition was comprehensively defeated in a series of votes, and John Ponsonby resigned as speaker in frustration. However, public dissatisfaction was demonstrated in a riot outside the Commons. Townshend claimed &#145;that the cry amongst the mob was that the lord lieutenant had got a great majority, and was going to carry away their parliament&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calendar of Home Office Papers</span>, 3.211).<br>
<br>Townshend, having turned away from the undertakers' assistance, was now reliant on an ambitious group of men&#151;many of them with patriotic inclinations&#151;eager for reward. There was insufficient patronage to keep the new Castle party content, and as the next session approached it became clear that his majority was no longer solid. To counteract this problem Townshend began to turn to Lord Shannon, an old-style undertaker, who had never really been reconciled to life in opposition. However, though Townshend laid the groundwork for Shannon's return, he was not able to count on his support, and his government was defeated on several issues, most notably the division of the revenue boards. Shannon refused to return to government under Townshend, partly because of the viceroy's support for bills designed to bring relief to Ireland's Catholics.<br>
<br>Although the session ended quietly it was clear to the North ministry that Townshend's personal standing was preventing the completion of government dominance, and that his removal would restore a measure of calm to Irish politics. Henry Seymour Conway claimed that Townshend &#145;disdains too much to be a politician and will not take the trouble of managing, or let others do it&#146;  (PRONI, Annaghmore MSS, T 2812/12/25). Indeed his personal relations with some Irish politicians were at their lowest ebb during his last months in Ireland, and an argument with Lord Bellamont resulted in a duel in which Bellamont was shot and injured. Francis Andrews, provost of Trinity College and a government supporter, observed: &#145;It is rather odd that a man who had so many great things to give away, and gave them all to the people of the country, should not leave a friend behind him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Eighth Report</span>, HMC, 1.193). In reality, however, his departure was lamented by many Irish politicians, and he was attended by a sizeable crowd when he came to board his ship. Indeed Townshend's Irish friends continued to hold a dinner on the day of his birthday for years after he had left Ireland.<br>
<br>Townshend left behind a much-altered system of government. The lord lieutenant, being now resident, possessed a greater degree of control over his managers; individuals no longer held more than one principal office of the crown, and the lords justices had disappeared. Townshend had also increased the hereditary revenue, although this did not lessen the reliance of the Castle government on the Irish parliament. His reforms were a direct result of his own persistence, but at the same time he had been reliant on the support provided by the North ministry. In essence the British ministry had adopted a policy of direct rule over Ireland, with Townshend responsible for the implementation of this policy and its fine-tuning.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears17721807"></a>Final years, 1772&#150;1807</h2>On his return from Ireland Townshend was restored to his old office at the Ordnance. He remained a firm supporter of North and went into opposition on the formation of the Rockingham ministry. When the Fox&#150;North coalition was formed he returned again to the Ordnance. Throughout the remainder of his political life he remained exercised by a limited number of issues. The militia still concerned him, and added to this was now Ireland. He spoke on several occasions in the Lords on behalf of Irish trade concessions. This was a service that many Irish politicians recognized as their dislike of him was tempered in the years before his death.<br>
<br>Townshend's wife had died in Ireland, at Leixlip Castle, on 14 September 1770, and he married, on 19 May 1773, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1819), the daughter of Sir William Montgomery, first baronet, MP for Ballynekill, and his first wife, Hannah Tomkyns. They had six children. Townshend continued to climb the ranks of the army, becoming colonel of the 2nd regiment of dragoons on 15 July 1773, general on 20 November 1782, and field marshal in 1796. One of his most cherished ambitions was achieved on 31 October 1786, when he was created Marquess Townshend of Raynham. He held a number of other offices during the latter years of his life, including lord lieutenant and vice-admiral of the county of Norfolk, governor of Hull, governor of Jersey, and high steward of Tamworth. His wife was appointed mistress of the robes to the princess of Wales in 1795. But these honours could not disguise a rather lacklustre end to a tumultuous political and military life. He spent much of his time as a county squire, an advocate of the new farming techniques popularized by his grandfather. He died on 14 September 1807 at Raynham, Norfolk, where he was buried on 28 September. His wife survived him and died on 29 March 1819; he was succeeded as second marquess by his eldest son by his first marriage, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27625/', "George Townshend (1753&#150;1811)")</script>.<br>
<br>Excepting his Irish post, which in the eighteenth century was regarded as a curse as much as a blessing, Townshend never held high political office; indeed it could be said that he never aspired to it. Yet his achievements were to have a resounding impact. His involvement in introducing a more direct form of government in Ireland in 1767 marked a major step towards union. His sensitivity to propaganda and public opinion is also noteworthy. He was a significant political caricaturist, and his advocacy of the petitioning of MPs challenged the eighteenth-century notion of the relationship between MPs and their electors.<br>
