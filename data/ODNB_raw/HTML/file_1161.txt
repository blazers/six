<span class="headword">Baldwin</span> <span class="st"> [Baldwin de Meulles]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1086<span class="mult">x</span>90), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, is usually described in contemporary sources as son of Count Gilbert, brother of Richard son of Count Gilbert, or as Baldwin the Sheriff (of Devon) or Baldwin of Exeter. He was the second son of Gilbert, count of Eu and possibly also of Brionne. The latter was a son of Godefroy, an illegitimate son of Richard (I), duke of Normandy. One of the guardians of the young duke (the future king, William I), Gilbert was murdered either late in 1040 or in January 1041. His sons Baldwin and Richard escaped to Flanders, returning thence after the marriage of Duke William to Matilda of Flanders. William gave to Baldwin the lordships of Meulles and Le Sap. Baldwin's wife was a kinswoman of the duke. At a later date, in the chronicle of Forde Abbey, she is named as Albreda, but in a ducal charter of 1066 and in <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> as Emma. The Forde tradition may thus be an error, but the possibility that Baldwin married twice cannot be discounted. It has been suggested that Emma may have been a daughter of Richard Goz, vicomte of the Avranchin  (Keats-Rohan, 50).<br>
<br>Orderic Vitalis included Baldwin and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5445/', "Richard de Clare")</script>, ancestor of the Clare family, in his list of notable laymen at Duke William's court in 1066. His presence at the battle of Hastings is not attested, though, like that of his brother Richard, it is probable. In 1068 King William travelled to south-west England to deal with resistance there spearheaded by Gytha, mother of Harold Godwineson, and he ordered a castle to be built at Exeter, which he committed to Baldwin. The latter is found soon afterwards as sheriff of Devon, an office he evidently still held at the time of the <span class="roman">Domesday</span> Survey, and possibly retained until his death not long afterwards. In 1086 he was the major lay landholder in the county. His estates were concentrated round Exeter and Okehampton, where a castle is referred to in <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>, and they extended along the valley of the River Torre towards the north coast of Devon. They had been acquired from various pre-conquest landholders; this, together with a heavy obligation to knight service of more than 90 fees, suggests that military considerations had been very much to the forefront in the creation of what came to be known as the barony of Okehampton. Moreover, the fact that Baldwin's English estates were concentrated in the south-west, unlike those of many others of the greatest landholders, points to his having been most active at an early stage of the conquest, but not participating in the takeover of the midlands and the north; nor were his lands overall as valuable as those acquired by his brother Richard. His presence at the royal court is attested occasionally in the witness lists of royal documents.<br>
<br>The precise date of Baldwin's death is not known, but in Orderic's account of a terrifying vision of spectres of the dead experienced by a priest of Lisieux on 1 January 1091 there figured Baldwin and Richard his brother, who had died &#145;recently&#146;  (Ordericus Vitalis, <span class="italic">Eccl. hist.</span>, 4.236&#150;50). Baldwin's estates were divided between two sons: Robert succeeded to Le Sap and Meulles, and William fitz Baldwin to the lands in south-west England. There was a third son, Richard, and at least two daughters. An illegitimate son, Wiger, became a monk of Bec, a house with which Baldwin had strong family connections. His father, Count Gilbert, had been the overlord of Herluin, founder of the abbey, and Baldwin himself gave land to the abbey from his estates in Normandy and in England.<br>
