<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Toynbee,  Arnold</span>  (1852&#150;1883), <span class="occ">social reformer and political economist</span>, was born at 18 Savile Row, London, on 23 August 1852, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27647/', "Joseph Toynbee (1815&#150;1866)")</script>, an eminent aural surgeon, and his wife, Harriet Holmes. Toynbee owed much in his early years to the influence of his father, who, though he died when his son was only fourteen, had already inspired him with a love of literature and with the foundations of those social ideals which were afterwards the main interest of his life. Toynbee began his education at a preparatory school at Blackheath.<br>
<br>At the age of thirteen or fourteen a fall from his pony resulted in a severe concussion and recurring headaches, which were to plague him especially when he was under strain. Hence, rather than go to Rugby School as planned, Toynbee went to the Revd J. M. Brackenbury's school in Wimbledon, and following his father's death in 1866, spent two unfruitful years in an army preparatory school reading for the military academy at Woolwich. Strained relations with his mother and the lack of a clear sense of purpose meant that he spent the next few years attending some classes at King's College, London, and reading on his own at home and in various lodgings. Finally he came into a small inheritance from his father, enabling him to go to Oxford in 1873. He had a sharp intellect and strongly independent character, which enabled him to acquire an amount of knowledge in certain fields of study, and to develop a strength and originality of opinion very unusual at so early an age. However, according to his friend F. C. Montague, Toynbee at this stage &#145;imagined himself to have gone deeper and further than was really the case&#146;  (Montague, 10).<br>
<br>In January 1873 Toynbee matriculated as a commoner at Pembroke College, Oxford. In November of that year he competed for the Brackenbury (history) scholarship at Balliol. Though he was not successful, his work made a great impression on the examiners, and Benjamin Jowett of Balliol offered him rooms. Toynbee was keen to take up this offer, but the master of Pembroke raised objections. Following Jowett's advice, Toynbee left Pembroke and ceased to be a member of the university, though still residing at Oxford. In January 1875 he matriculated afresh, this time as a commoner at Balliol, though he had to abandon his plan to sit for Greats (the final examination in philosophy and ancient history) and instead read for an ordinary pass degree. As an undergraduate he was a considerable influence among his Balliol contemporaries.<br>
<br>Toynbee came at first under the influence of Ruskin, who may have stimulated Toynbee's initial interest in political economy. He joined with enthusiasm the North Hinksey diggers' project, where Ruskin hoped to teach Oxford men the value of labour in the service of the community. But he soon became an ardent disciple of T. H. Green and adopted Green's gospel of civic duty, which led to Toynbee's joining some of his Balliol contemporaries in tutoring the teacher-trainees of the Oxford Wesleyan Boys' School. Toynbee resolved a crisis of faith through Green's broad-church views, whereby duty replaced dogma as the main expression of faith. This, in turn, resulted in Toynbee's involvement with the Church Reform Union's campaign to strengthen the national character of the established church and democratize its government, especially at the parish level. The desire to assist in raising the material and moral condition of the mass of the population grew more and more to be the absorbing passion of his life, and it was in order to direct his own and others' efforts in this direction that he threw himself with great energy into the study of economics, and especially of economic history. In spite of his poor health, which caused frequent and serious interruption to his studies, Toynbee obtained such a mastery of economics that immediately after taking his degree (1878) he was appointed a tutor at Balliol in charge of the candidates for the Indian Civil Service. In the following year he married (26 June 1879) Charlotte Maria (1841&#150;1931), daughter of William Duncombe Atwood [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48428/', "Toynbee, Charlotte Maria")</script>], who was eleven years his senior.<br>
<br>Toynbee's Oxford lectures, primarily intended for his pupils but soon attracting a wider circle of hearers, dealt with the principles of economics and contemporary economic history. His main interest was the history of the great changes which had come over the industrial system of Great Britain between the middle of the eighteenth century and his own time. Keen to apply the new liberal principles of Green, he took part in charity organization (he was a poor-law guardian from 1881), co-operation, and adult education. He gave public lectures on the industrial problems of the day, which were attended by large working-class audiences in Bradford, Newcastle, Bolton, Leicester, and London.<br>
<br>The posthumously published volume of his works entitled <span class="italic">The Industrial Revolution</span> (1884) reveals the nature of Toynbee's interests. The first part of it, &#145;The industrial revolution&#146; proper, consists of the notes of his lectures delivered at Balliol on the industrial history of Great Britain from 1760, a subject on which he was collecting materials at the time of his death. Despite its fragmentary character and occasional inconsistencies, <span class="italic">The Industrial Revolution</span> is full of valuable research and acute observation. In effect, Toynbee made in his lectures a strong case for the study of economic and social history as deserving specialization in addition to the traditional political and constitutional history. Toynbee has been widely credited with having established the term &#145;industrial revolution&#146; as a proper historical concept. However, his intention was to extend the application of the whig argument contrasting the peaceful and gradual reformism of the &#145;English revolution&#146; with the violence of the French Revolution. Toynbee had adopted the positivist view of progress as encompassing all spheres of human activity and tried to show how industrialization had carried with it progressive political change, thereby rejecting the need for revolutionary politics. The popular addresses, including &#145;Wages and natural law&#146; and &#145;Industry and democracy&#146;, which compose the second half of the volume, are chiefly of interest as illustrations of Toynbee's character and aims as a social missionary. The eloquence, the religious fervour, the enthusiasm for the better organization of industrial society, and the genuine but not uncritical sympathy with working-class aspirations which were characteristic of him, are traceable even in the fragmentary remains of these lectures, which were largely extempore, and could in some instances only be pieced together after his death, from notes or from the reports of provincial newspapers. But the chief source of Toynbee's influence lay in the charm of his personality. His striking appearance, &#145;a face of almost Greek regularity of feature&#146;  (Milner, xiv), winning manners, and great power of expression aided by a melodious voice, above all his transparent sincerity and high-mindedness, won the respect and affection of all with whom he came into contact, whether as pupil, teacher, or fellow worker in social causes.<br>
<br>Since his undergraduate days Toynbee had been a friend of Jowett, master of Balliol. He was also closely associated with T. H. Green and Richard Lewis Nettleship. Following a brief stay in the summer of 1875 in east London, he was also associated with Canon Barnett, vicar of St Jude's, Whitechapel, and became a founder of the first university settlement, Toynbee Hall, which was established soon after Toynbee's death and named after him.<br>
<br>Toynbee belonged to the first generation of new Liberals who strove to preserve the political alliance between labour and Liberalism by means of producing a new mix of updated Liberal ideology. They combined the traditional values of free trade and self-help with Green's advocacy of greater intervention by the state in ensuring its citizens' welfare and with practical reform schemes which were to compete with radical socialism. Following Green's example, Toynbee entered municipal politics in 1882, when he stood unsuccessfully as a Liberal candidate for Oxford's north ward, where Green had held a seat until his death. He was opposed to the extreme individualism of some of the earlier English economists, and he came to reject the validity and utility of classical economics. He believed strongly in the power of free corporate effort, such as that of co-operative and friendly societies and of trade unions, to raise the standard of life among the mass of the people, and in the duty of the state to assist such effort by free education, by the regulation of the conditions of labour, and by contributing to voluntary insurance funds intended to provide for the labourer in sickness and old age.<br>
<br>In the last year of his life Toynbee was deeply interested in the agitation that was provoked by Henry George's book on <span class="italic">Progress and Poverty</span> (1880) and his lectures in the British Isles. Convinced of the one-sidedness of that remarkable work, and alarmed by what he considered the bad and misleading influence which it was exercising upon the leaders of working-class opinion, he did his best to combat the doctrine of land nationalization by speech and writing. Two lectures which he delivered on the subject, first in Oxford and then at St Andrew's Hall, Newman Street, London, were his last efforts as a teacher on social questions. For some time he had been greatly overworked, and the physical and mental strain of delivering the lectures in London to hostile audiences were held to have contributed to the complete breakdown of his health. He contracted meningitis and died at 3 Thornton Hill, Wimbledon, Surrey, on 9 March 1883 and was buried in Wimbledon churchyard. At the time of his death Toynbee, who had been made bursar of Balliol in 1881, was just about to be appointed a fellow of that college. Following his untimely death he was widely hailed as a modern martyr who had given his life in the service of the masses. In retrospect he is best remembered for having established the academic usage of the term &#145;Industrial Revolution&#146;, and as one of the leaders of early new Liberalism.<br>
