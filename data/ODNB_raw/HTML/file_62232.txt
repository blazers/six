<span class="headword">Culverwell family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1545&#150;<em>c.</em>1640), <span class="occ">merchants and religious radicals</span>, descended from William Culverwell of Wells, Somerset, and his wife (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Berney), who produced a remarkable family during the reign of Henry VIII. It included five surviving sons, three of whom gravitated to London and became citizens in the legal sense&#151;that is, by virtue of being &#145;made free&#146; of one of the livery companies.<h2>
<a name="Thefoundingbrother"></a>The founding brother</h2>
<a name="cosubject_62232"></a><span class="headword">Nicholas Culverwell</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1569)<span class="occ"></span>, the first to achieve success if not demonstrably the eldest, served an apprenticeship under <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37157/', "George Barne (c.1500&#150;1558)")</script>, later lord mayor of London and probably his mother's brother, and was made free of the Haberdashers in July 1549. He immediately married Elizabeth Joyce: their eldest child, Elizabeth, was baptized at St James Garlickhythe in September 1550. Six other children are known to have been born before 1563.<br>
<br>By 1553 Nicholas Culverwell had settled his family in the parish of St Martin Vintry. A convinced protestant probably from his prentice days he may, like his friends George and Thomas Heton, have been one the &#145;sustainers&#146; of the secret protestant congregation in Marian London, while in 1559 he entertained John Jewel (1522&#150;1571) following his return from exile. Rated that year in the high assessment for subsidy at &pound;90 he was thus officially counted amongst London's 500 richest citizens. His prosperity appears to have been based initially on the Gascon wine trade, but during 1559&#150;60 he attempted, with the aid of Lord Robert Dudley, to establish a government-sponsored company to regulate a new wool staple on the continent, on the grounds that the loss of Calais in 1558 had cancelled the ancient privileges of the Merchant Staplers. The latter, however, retaliated, negotiating a new government charter in early 1561 and transferring their activities to Bruges. The patent granted to Dudley was accordingly surrendered.<br>
<br>In October 1561 Culverwell bought from George Heton a large estate in Stratford-Bow and Bromley by Bow, Middlesex, and in 1566 contributed &pound;3 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. for the building of Sir Thomas Gresham's New Exchange, a sum which placed him within the top fifth of the 732 London merchants involved in the scheme. In 1568 he was one of a consortium which, partly under cover of a government contract for the importation of wine and salt, was responsible for providing help for the Huguenot cause in France. Accorded quasi-diplomatic status, Nicholas was sent to negotiate with Cardinal Ch&acirc;tillon, the mayor of La Rochelle, and Jeanne d'Albret, queen of Navarre. A letter mentioning his activities, found on the body of the prince de Cond&eacute; after the battle of Jarnac (13 March 1569), survives in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale de France.<br>
<br>Although clearly destined for a spectacular mercantile career Nicholas Culverwell died on 26 October 1569, probably in his early forties. His will, made four days earlier, contains generous bequests and set up two trusts under the auspices of the Haberdashers. A stock of &pound;100 was to provide five young freemen with &pound;20 each for five years, tax-free. A trust fund of &pound;200 was to be established in order to pay &pound;5 per annum to two poor divinity students, one at Christ's College, Cambridge, and the other at Magdalen College, Oxford, &#145;they to be called for ever by the names of the preachers of Nicholas Culverwell&#146;. The Haberdashers administers the trust to this day. Elizabeth was named sole executrix. Nicholas's four overseers were his brother Richard; the Marian exile John Bodley (father of Sir Thomas), with whom the family had established a lasting friendship; Thomas Heton; and Thomas Sampson, who had been deprived of the deanery of Christ Church for nonconformity in 1565. First to witness the will was the young John Field, on the brink of his career as London's most energetic and determined religious reformer.<h2>
<a name="Alliancesinmarriageandfaith"></a>Alliances in marriage and faith</h2>Nicholas Culverwell's profound impact on London's godly community was spectacularly reflected in the marriage alliances of the next generation. His daughter Elizabeth became the mother of the Church of England clergyman and author <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11133/', "William Gouge")</script>. His eldest son, <a name="cosubject_70078"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Culverwell</span>  (1551?&#150;1613)<span class="occ"></span>, graduated BA from Christ's College, Cambridge, in early 1572, matriculated at Heidelberg in October that year (possibly as a disciple of Thomas Cartwright), and in 1578 married Jane, one of the two recorded daughters of Thomas Sampson. He sold the major portion of the Stratford estate and died as rector of Cherry Burton, Yorkshire, and a noted preacher. Of Nicholas's two surviving younger daughters Cecilia (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1630) married Laurence Chaderton, first master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, while Susan (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1587) was married first to Cuthbert Fuller (<i>d</i>. 1579), brother of Nicholas Fuller, and then to William Whitaker, master of St John's College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>Of Nicholas Culverwell's &#145;London&#146; brothers, <a name="cosubject_72773"></a><span class="headword">Laurence Culverwell</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1562)<span class="occ"></span> became free of the Coopers by redemption (a money payment) in 1560. <a name="cosubject_64767"></a><span class="headword">Richard Culverwell</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1586)<span class="occ"></span>, apprenticed to John Elliott, factor to Sir Thomas Gresham during Mary's reign, became free of the Mercers in 1559, also settling in St Martin Vintry. He took over Nicholas's role within the London godly community and evidently became the mainstay of the politico-religious campaigns of John Field, while himself maintaining an extremely low profile. Despite his diligence in investigating &#145;the precisians&#146; Richard Bancroft discovered little in the early 1580s beyond the fact that they collected money &#145;for their brethren that travell for them beyond the Seas&#146; which was &#145;commonlye delivered to one Field a Preacher in the Citie, and one Culverwell in Tamyse streete&#146;  (Peel, <span class="italic">Tracts</span>, 12). Richard himself probably travelled widely on behalf of the Calvinist cause, bequeathing to his daughter a gold chain given to him by the queen of Navarre &#145;for the furtherance and defence of the gospel and such as sincerely profess the same&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/69). In 1583 he negotiated the land transactions necessary to establish the site of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, formally founded in 1584. Counted as one of Emmanuel's original benefactors, he bestowed upon it &pound;200 and many books, several of which survive in the college library.<br>
<br>Richard Culverwell died in February 1586, his will suggesting the extent to which he had been responsible for co-ordinating and financing godly stratagems since the death of Nicholas. There were bequests of &pound;2 or &pound;3 to nine leading London preachers, including Field, Robert Crowley, William Charke, Walter Travers, and Thomas Crooke, and the huge sum of &pound;350 was left in trust for distribution to the deserving godly, clerical or lay.<br>
<br>For a variety of reasons Richard Culverwell's death probably ended St Martin Vintry's influence over the affairs of the London godly. He himself had no son to succeed him. He and his wife, Anne (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Hopkins; <i>d</i>. in or before January 1598), had an only daughter, Judith, who in 1585 married the future Sir Thomas Smythe (<i>c</i>.1558&#150;1625) but died within days of her father. Laurence's only son, <a name="cosubject_70076"></a><span class="headword">Anthony Culverwell</span>  (<em>c.</em>1559&#150;1612)<span class="occ"></span> married Sybil, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53707/', "John Bodley (c.1520&#150;1591)")</script>, in 1582 as his first wife but was not regarded by Richard as the heir to his business interests and received only &pound;30 in Richard's will. Following Sybil's death, some time after 1584, he married Sarah Willis, who survived him. The days of organized radical protestantism were numbered by now. The death of John Field in 1588 and the appearance of the Martin Marprelate tracts thereafter prompted the relentless campaign which amongst much else destroyed the conference movement that Field had founded and guided for twenty years.<br>
<br>Their widows all long outlived the three Culverwell brothers. Alice, wife of Laurence, continued to run his business under the auspices of the Coopers and as Alice Luntley was remembered in Richard's will. Elizabeth, wife of Nicholas, died in 1589 or early in January 1590, appointing John Bodley sole executor and making bequests to Chaderton, Whitaker, and other leading Cambridge divines. Anne, wife of Richard, remained a widow ten years before marrying William Neale (<i>d</i>. 1600), auditor of the exchequer and a close friend of Walter Mildmay.<br>
<br>If Anthony did not inherit the mantle of Nicholas and Richard, the Culverwell genius was dispersed unto the third and fourth generations in the careers of William Gouge, Nathaniel Culverwell (<i>bap</i>. 1619, <i>d</i>. 1651), a Culverwell by double descent, and Alexander Whitaker, &#145;the Apostle of Virginia&#146;. Nathaniel's father, another <a name="cosubject_70077"></a><span class="headword">Richard Culverwell</span>  (1581/2&#150;1644)<span class="occ"></span>, was probably a grandson of either John or William Culverwell, the two brothers of Nicholas, Laurence, and Richard who never left Somerset. He matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, in April 1598 aged sixteen, as &#145;plebeian&#146; of Somerset. Graduating BA in 1602, he proceeded MA in 1607 and BD in 1617. He married Margaret Horton, daughter of the London merchant Thomas Horton and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Laurence Culverwell and sister of Anthony. Instituted on the crown's presentation to the rectory of St Margaret Moyses, Friday Street, on 30 March 1618 he was buried there on 12 April 1644. Of Nathaniel's siblings, the third Richard Culverwell (1621&#150;1688), was baptized at St Margaret Moyses on 21 April 1621 and died as rector of Grundisburgh, Suffolk.<h2>
<a name="Apillarofgodliness"></a>A pillar of godliness</h2>There remains the outstanding figure of <a name="cosubject_62231"></a><span class="headword">Ezekiel Culverwell</span>  (<em>c.</em>1554&#150;1631)<span class="occ"></span>, second son of Nicholas Culverwell, who graduated BA at Oxford in 1573, proceeding MA in June 1577. The Oxford records do not mention his college, but since his father endowed a preachership there in 1569 there can be little doubt that Ezekiel was sent to Magdalen, where Laurence Humphrey (whose biography of Jewel is the source for Nicholas's patronage of him) was president. He was ordained deacon and priest at Lincoln in 1585, before arriving in Essex as household chaplain at Leighs Priory, principal seat of Robert, third Lord Rich, in late 1586 or early 1587. Establishing a strong friendship with Richard Rogers, lecturer of Wethersfield, he joined the conference of nonconformist ministers around Braintree which had first met in 1582. He also persuaded his sister Elizabeth and her husband, Thomas Gouge, to send their son William to Felsted School, where the young Gouge was &#145;trained up three years under the public ministry of his uncle&#146;  (Gouge, &#145;A narrative&#146;, sig. A1) before departing for Eton in 1589. Culverwell's activities soon engaged Aylmer's attention: as &#145;preacher of Felsted&#146; he was amongst those who, some time in 1587, are recorded as having been suspended &#145;in his last visitation and since for the surplice&#146;  (Peel, <span class="italic">Seconde Parte</span>, 2.260).<br>
<br>Culverwell's position as Rich's chaplain could not protect him from the attentions of Aylmer's officials in the visitation of 1589. In a series of twenty-one articles, probably written by Thomas Rust, vicar of Felsted, his nonconformist practices were comprehensively scrutinized. Subsequent court hearings were admirably handled by Edward Stanhope, Aylmer's vicar-general, who refused to turn the case into a witch-hunt and ostensibly reconciled Culverwell and Rust (and their wives). Culverwell continued to preach at Felsted and a son, Ezekiel (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1606), was baptized in the parish church in March 1591. On 23 December 1592 Aylmer instituted Culverwell, on the presentation of Robert Lawson, to the Essex rectory of Great Stambridge. Nothing is known of his first wife but in 1598 he married Winifred (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Hildersham), widow of Edward Barefoot, a friend of his brother Samuel's from Cambridge and Heidelberg days, and possibly the sister of Arthur Hildersham.<br>
<br>Following the death of Arthur Dent, Culverwell saw through the press his treatise on the apocalypse, <span class="italic">The Ruine of Rome</span> (1603), adding a dedicatory epistle to Lord Rich. His reference to his &#145;near conjunction&#146; with his &#145;late brother&#146;  (sig. 1<i>v</i>) led to the erroneous assumption that Dent had married a Culverwell daughter. In April 1605 Culverwell solemnized at Great Stambridge the marriage of Mary Forth to John Winthrop, future governor of Massachusetts. Winthrop later recorded that it was Culverwell who had converted him to godliness and the two men continued to correspond long after Mary's death. Two of Culverwell's three surviving letters are preserved amongst the Winthrop papers.<br>
<br>After the Hampton Court conference in 1604 nonconformity again came under siege as James I pressed his bishops to demand subscription to the prayer book ceremonies as the badge of inclusion within the Church of England. Although undisturbed during Richard Vaughan's episcopate (1604&#150;7) Culverwell could not parry the demands of his successor, Thomas Ravis. On 20 March 1609 he was one of four Essex incumbents deprived by the high commission.<br>
<br>Culverwell apparently spent the rest of his life in London. In 1623 he published <span class="italic">A Treatise of Faith</span>, a comprehensive attempt to anatomize the scriptural basis of Calvinist belief and practice, which reached an eighth edition in 1648 and prompted a small spate of similar guides to godliness. Alexander Leighton accused Culverwell of Arminian errors in <span class="italic">A Friendly Triall of the &#145;Treatise of Faith&#146;</span> (1624). Scorning to name either Leighton or the title of his book, Culverwell penned <span class="italic">A Briefe Answere to Certain Objections Against the &#145;Treatise of Faith&#146;</span> (1626). Several shorter works were published after his death.<br>
<br>Culverwell lived out his last years as a widower. Winifred was buried at All Hallows Barkingside in November 1613 and all his children but one&#151;Sarah Barefoot, his executrix&#151;were dead when he made his will in July 1630. He was buried in the parish of St Antholin on 14 April 1631.<br>
<br>C. H. Garrett's <span class="italic">The Marian Exiles</span> (1938) has been castigated for suggesting that protestant activities abroad between 1553 and 1558 were in some sense an organized withdrawal and planning of a New Jerusalem, the experience of which led directly to the American colonial experiment three generations later. A career such as Ezekiel Culverwell's, which exactly spans the vital eighty years involved, nevertheless gives pause for thought. The child who was dandled on John Jewel's knee just after the death of Mary I lived on to inspire William Gouge, John Winthrop, and also Ezekiel Cheever (1616?&#150;1708)&#151;presumably a godson&#151;to whom he bequeathed &pound;10 and one third of his Latin books. New England's most celebrated schoolmaster, Cheever died in harness more than a decade after the death of Mary II: Ezekiel Culverwell's was thus a vital handshake in the dispersal of the nonconformist protestant tradition.<br>
