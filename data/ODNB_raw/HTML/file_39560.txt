<span class="headword">Walton,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1746, <em>d.</em> 1813), <span class="occ">painter and picture dealer</span>, was baptized on 5 January 1746 at Dickleburgh, Norfolk. Walton was the second of three children of Samuel Walton (1710&#150;1797), yeoman farmer, and his wife, Ann Newstead (1711&#150;1797). His father was also a churchwarden and overseer of the poor. Walton's early education is unknown, although the contents of his library, sold after his wife's death, indicate that he was able to read Greek, Latin, and French. In 1765, aged nineteen, Walton moved to London, although not apparently with the intention of becoming an artist. Walton's earliest recorded portraits&#151;of Mr and Mrs John Frere&#151;date from 1768 (priv. coll.). In 1770 he began studying art at the Maiden Lane Academy, in Covent Garden, London. It was about this time that he became a pupil of Johan Zoffany, to whom he was probably introduced by his friend Ambrose Humphreys, who featured in one of Walton's early group portraits, <span class="italic">William Mason and John Mason with Mr Humphreys Playing Cricket at Harrow</span> (1772; priv. coll.). While with Zoffany, Walton copied his <span class="italic">Beggars on the Road to Stanmore</span> of 1769&#150;70 (priv. coll.). In 1771 Walton was living at Great Chandos Street, Covent Garden, painting portraits in oil and miniatures, and often featuring close friends and family. At this time he took on an apprentice, the miniature painter Edward Miles (1752&#150;1828), of Great Yarmouth. Miles, who made a number of copies after Walton, remained with him until 1794. In 1771 Walton was elected a fellow of the Society of Artists, where he exhibited two portraits. In 1772 he was elected a director of the society, showing four works at that year's exhibition. He exhibited there again in 1773 and 1776.<br>
<br>On 10 September 1771 Walton married Elizabeth Rust (1746&#150;1828) of Wortham, Suffolk, the daughter of a wool draper, and herself a miniature painter. They did not have children. Shortly after the marriage Walton purchased Oak Tree Farm, in the village of Burgate, near Wortham, where he converted one of the cottages into a house and studio. There Walton apparently painted landscapes, although these remain unidentified. During the early to mid-1770s Walton seems to have worked principally as a portrait painter, among his most celebrated sitters being Edward Gibbon, whom he painted on no fewer than six occasions (including NPG). Other prominent sitters included the Revd William Gilpin, Horatio Walpole, first earl of Orford, and Lord Cornwallis. All these portraits were engraved during the artist's lifetime, the print after Lord Cornwallis reputedly hanging in virtually every household in Suffolk  (Farrer, 146). At some time during 1773 to 1774 it has been supposed that Walton travelled to Paris, making the acquaintance of the French artist Jean-Baptiste Sim&eacute;on Chardin. According to his friend Dawson Turner, Walton frequently went there &#145;with a view of studying or of buying pictures&#146;  (Turner, 22). In 1776 Walton exhibited his first genre subject, <span class="italic">A Girl Plucking a Turkey</span> (Tate collection), at the Society of Artists. This was followed by other genre subjects, notably <span class="italic">The Silver Age</span> (Yale U. CBA), <span class="italic">A Girl Buying a Ballad</span> (Tate collection), and <span class="italic">A Group of Figures with a Fruit Barrow</span> (priv. coll.), exhibited at the Royal Academy respectively in 1777, 1778, and 1779.<br>
<br>In November 1778 Walton was turned down for membership of the Royal Academy, allegedly because of his prior affiliation to the rival Society of Artists. Feeling snubbed, he showed only two more works there in 1779 after which he ceased to exhibit altogether. During the 1780s Walton devoted himself increasingly to his farm in Burgate. He also travelled to Yorkshire, where he painted portraits of important local families. Among his more significant portraits and conversation pieces of this later period are <span class="italic">William Crowfoot and the Burroughes Brothers Boating on the River Waveney</span> (<i>c</i>.1780; priv. coll.), <span class="italic">Sir Bellingham Graham, 5th Bt. and his Children</span> (<i>c</i>.1785; priv. coll.), and <span class="italic">Sir Robert Buxton and Lady Buxton with their Daughter Anne</span> (1786; Norfolk Museum Services). Walton also painted the figures in several sporting pictures by Sawrey Gilpin and George Barratt. By the early 1790s he was established as a picture dealer and adviser to some major private collectors, notably Lord Lansdowne, Lord Fitzwilliam, and Sir Thomas Beauchamp-Proctor, to whom he sold a Poussin from the collection of Sir Joshua Reynolds. Walton's expertise was apparently such that &#145;there was scarcely a picture of note in this country, with the history of which he was unacquainted&#146;  (Turner, 22). Walton continued to paint local Norfolk and Suffolk families well into the early 1800s, among his last works being an unfinished portrait of John Trew (priv. coll.), an old servant of his friends the Frere family, painted in 1810. By now Walton was in poor health, having contracted a fever &#145;which caused a great alteration in his appearance&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 12.4362). One evening in May 1813, on returning from a party to his London lodgings in New Bond Street, Walton complained of feeling ill. He was found dead in bed the next morning, the immediate cause of death being described as hydrothorax and pleurisy. His obituary appeared in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> on 13 May 1813. Walton was buried near his parents in the churchyard at Brome, Suffolk. His will, dated 29 March 1812, was proved on 4 September 1813 and on 6 December 1828, following his wife's death.<br>
