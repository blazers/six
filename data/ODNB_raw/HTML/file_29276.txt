<span class="headword">White,  Thomas</span>  (1830&#150;1888), <span class="occ">journalist and politician in Canada</span>, was born in Montreal on 7 August 1830, the son of Thomas White, a leather merchant, and Dorothea Smeaton. His father came from co. Westmeath in 1826, his mother from Edinburgh. He was educated at Montreal high school, began his working life in his father's business, and ended up in journalism, joining the staff of the official <span class="italic">Quebec Gazette</span> in 1852. In 1853 he married Esther Vine, of Quebec City; they had seven daughters and three sons. That same year the couple moved to Peterborough, Canada West, where, with his brother Richard, White conducted the <span class="italic">Peterborough Review</span>. After studying law for four years he returned to journalism in 1864, and with his brother took over the Hamilton <span class="italic">Spectator</span>, founded eighteen years before. In 1870 they bought control of the Montreal <span class="italic">Gazette</span>, the leading Conservative newspaper in Canada. Well-written and vigorous, it became the basis of White's growing importance in the ranks of the Conservative Party. An example of the <span class="italic">Gazette's</span> style is its comment on Edward Blake (17 April 1880), just before Blake became leader of the Liberal Party: &#145;Mr Blake differs with everybody but Mr Blake and he does not always agree with him&#146;.<br>
<br>In January 1874 White stood for an Ontario seat in the Canadian House of Commons but was defeated by six votes; the same ill luck dogged him in two Quebec by-elections in 1874 and 1875, but finally in 1878 he was elected for Cardwell, an Ontario constituency. The Conservative government of Sir John A. Macdonald had made a mess of the administration of the north-west, which led to the north-west rebellion of 1885; after it was over White was appointed minister of the interior to tidy things up.<br>
<br>White was remarkable. The pity is he had not been given the portfolio years before. He worked like a Trojan to understand and to remedy. One western MP said, &#145;We trusted him, for he had no purpose to serve save that of the country&#146;. That could well be his epitaph. After three strenuous years of work and travel across the Canadian west, he succumbed to pneumonia in Ottawa on 21 April 1888. His death stunned parliament. He had been like a son to Sir John Macdonald. Sara Jeanette Duncan said in the Toronto <span class="italic">Week</span> (26 April 1888), &#145;men turn over the memories of his kindly deeds, his painstaking service, his upright behaviour &hellip;&#146;. There are upright men in politics. Thomas White was one.<br>
