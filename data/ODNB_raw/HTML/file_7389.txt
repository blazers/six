<span class="headword">Deane,  Thomas</span>  (1651&#150;1735), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic convert</span>, was the son of Edward Deane of Malden, Kent. He matriculated from University College, Oxford, on 19 October 1669, the same day as his friend and future colleague Nathaniel Boyse, and subscribed the articles and took the oath of supremacy in the following month, when he was probably admitted a servitor. He graduated BA in 1673 and MA in 1676. He became a tutor in the college, of which he was elected fellow on 4 December 1684, and Greek lecturer. He &#145;declared himself a papist much about the same time that his master, Obadiah Walker, did&#146; in March 1686, &#145;whose creature and convert he was&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.450). Walker had been his tutor, and Deane, Boyse, and John Massey, future dean of Christ Church, Oxford, were known as Walker's &#145;three disciples&#146;. Royal permission was given to Deane, Walker, and Boyse to establish a Roman Catholic chapel in May 1686, instead of attending Church of England worship, a development described as &#145;a propaganda <i>coup</i> out of all proportion to the small numbers involved&#146;  (Tyacke, 613).<br>
<br>Deane was the author of <span class="italic">The Religion of Mar. Luther neither Catholick nor Protestant, Prov'd from his Own Works</span>, privately printed in Obadiah Walker's lodgings in Oxford in 1688. He contributed to a volume of congratulatory verse produced by the university for the birth of James II's heir, the prince of Wales, James Stuart, in 1688. To Deane has been attributed &#145;An essay towards a proposal for Catholick communion&#146; (London, 1704), but the real author was probably Joshua Basset.<br>
<br>After the landing of the prince of Orange in England, Deane and Massey withdrew privately from Oxford (30 November 1688) to avoid the tumult of the mob, and went to London. Deane's fellowship was declared vacant on 4 February 1689. He was once or twice committed to prison in London on suspicion of being a Jesuit or priest. On 18 December 1691 he stood in the pillory at Charing Cross under the name of Thomas Franks, a reputed Jesuit, for concealing a libel or pamphlet against the government, written by a person who lodged in the same house as himself. During the latter part of his life Deane was a prisoner for debt in the Fleet; but he died at Malden on 10 November 1735, having subsisted for some years mostly on charity.<br>
