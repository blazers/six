<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cooke, Sir  William  Fothergill</span>  (1806&#150;1879), <span class="occ">developer of electric telegraphy</span>, was born on 4 May 1806 at Ealing, Middlesex, one of two sons and two daughters of William Cooke (1776/7&#150;1857), surgeon, and his wife, Elizabeth Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fothergill. In 1822 William Cooke was elected physician to Durham Infirmary, a post he held until 1842. His son attended Durham School in 1822&#150;3, then Edinburgh University, before entering the Indian army, becoming an ensign. After five years in India he resigned his commission on grounds of ill health, and took up his father's profession, studying anatomy at Paris and then at Heidelberg, under Professor M&uuml;nke. He prepared the wax models which his father used for his own anatomy lectures in 1842.<br>
<br>Electric telegraphy came to Cooke's notice while he was at Heidelberg, several people having demonstrated its feasibility. Professor M&uuml;nke's lectures included a demonstration of telegraphic apparatus on the principle introduced by Baron Schilling in 1835. Hitherto, such experiments had been confined to the classroom and laboratory; Cooke realized the commercial possibilities, and conceived the idea of using the invention in connection with the various railway systems then developing. He abandoned his studies and devoted himself entirely to telegraphy. In 1836 he returned to England and conducted experiments with his friend and solicitor, Burton Lane. Cooke found that, although his apparatus worked across a room, it would not work through 1 mile of wire. He sought help from Michael Faraday and Peter Roget; neither could assist, but Roget, who knew of the work of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29184/', "Charles Wheatstone")</script>, referred Cooke to him.<br>
<br>Cooke and Wheatstone first met on 27 February 1837, by which time Cooke was negotiating with the Liverpool and Manchester Railway Company for the use of his (Cooke's) telegraphs. After one or two interviews, in which Wheatstone seems to have frankly revealed to Cooke all the work he had done towards perfecting the electric telegraph, a partnership was agreed upon between them, and duly entered into in May 1837. Wheatstone had neither taste nor leisure for business details, while Cooke possessed a good practical knowledge, much energy, and business ability of a high order. Wheatstone and Cooke's first patent, &#145;for improvements in giving signals and sounding alarms in distant places by means of electric currents transmitted through electric circuits&#146;, was signed by William IV on 10 June 1837. Cooke now proceeded to test the utility of the invention, the London and Blackwall, the London and Birmingham, and the Great Western Railway companies successively allowing the use of their lines for the experiment. It was found, however, that with five needles and five line wires the expense was too great, and in that form the electric telegraph was abandoned. In 1838 an improvement was effected whereby the number of needles was reduced to two, and a patent for this was taken out by Cooke and Wheatstone. Before a parliamentary committee on railways in 1840, Wheatstone stated that he had, conjointly with Cooke, obtained a new patent for a telegraphic arrangement. The new apparatus required only a single pair of wires instead of five, and was greatly simplified. The telegraph was still too costly for general purposes. In 1845, however, Cooke and Wheatstone succeeded in producing the single needle apparatus, which they patented, and from that time the electric telegraph became a practical instrument, and was speedily adopted on all the railway lines of the country. In the meantime, a bitter controversy arose between Cooke and Wheatstone, each claiming the chief credit of the invention. Cooke contended that he alone had succeeded in reducing the electric telegraph to practical usefulness at the time he sought Wheatstone's assistance, and on the other hand Wheatstone maintained that Cooke's instrument had never been, and could never be, practically applied. More of the actual work of invention was no doubt done by Wheatstone than by his partner, though Wheatstone agreed that he could not have succeeded commercially without Cooke's &#145;zeal and perseverance and practical skill&#146;. An arrangement was arrived at in 1843, by which the telegraph patents were assigned to Cooke, with the reservation of a mileage royalty to Wheatstone. Subsequently, Wheatstone sold all his rights in Great Britain, Ireland, and Belgium to Cooke for &pound;30,000. In 1846 the Electric Telegraph Company was formed in conjunction with Cooke, the company paying Cooke &pound;120,000 for the earlier patents.<br>
<br>On 5 June 1838 Cooke married Anna Louisa (<i>d</i>. 1891), daughter of Joseph Wheatley, a solicitor, at Treeton near Rotherham, Yorkshire; they had one daughter. For some years Cooke employed himself very actively in the practical work of telegraphy, but after his separation from Wheatstone he did not achieve much in the way of invention. He tried to obtain an extension of the original patents, but the judicial committee of the privy council decided that Cooke and Wheatstone had been sufficiently remunerated, and that the electric telegraph had not been so poor an investment as they had been led to believe by the press, the shareholders having received a bonus of &pound;15 per share, besides the usual dividend of four per cent on &pound;300,000. The Albert gold medal of the Society of Arts was awarded on equal terms to Cooke and Wheatstone in 1867; and two years later Cooke was knighted, Wheatstone having had the same honour conferred upon him the year before. Cooke subsequently lost all the money he had made from the telegraph in unsuccessful mining ventures in north Wales. A civil-list pension of &pound;100 p.a. was granted to him in 1871. He died at Castle Street, Farnham, Surrey, the home of his son-in-law, on 25 June 1879. He was survived by his wife.<br>
