<span class="headword">Fenning,  Elizabeth</span>  (1793&#150;1815), <span class="occ">convicted attempted murderer</span>, was born in Dominica in the West Indies on 10 June 1793. She was one of the ten children of William Fenning, infantry soldier from Suffolk, and his Irish wife. In 1796 the 15th foot, in which her father served, returned to Dublin; the Fennings moved to Red Lion Passage, London, where Fenning's brother was a potato merchant. Elizabeth, who was short but &#145;of the most perfect symmetry&#146;, was employed as a domestic servant from the age of fourteen, and in January 1815 entered the service of a tradesman, Orlibar Turner, of 68 Chancery Lane, London, as a cook.<br>
<br>On 21 March 1815 Turner, his son Robert, and daughter-in-law Charlotte all became very sick after dinner, having eaten some yeast dumplings prepared by Fenning. Roger Gadsden, one of Turner's apprentices, had eaten a piece of dumpling after dinner, although he had been strongly advised by Fenning not to touch it. Fenning herself ate some of the dumpling, and became so ill that her mother was summoned to her side. It was discovered that arsenic had been mixed into the dumplings, and suspicion fell on Fenning who was arrested. Her trial was heard at the Old Bailey on 11 April 1815. The evidence produced against her was that she had asked leave to make the dumplings, that she was alone in the kitchen during the whole of their preparation, that she knew of and had access to arsenic kept in Turner's office, and that the basic ingredients were not contaminated. Fenning pleaded not guilty, claiming that Mrs Turner disliked her and pointing out that she too had been made ill by the dumpling. Five witnesses to her good character were produced, but the recorder summed up against her and the jury found her guilty of attempted murder. She was sentenced to death, on hearing which she fell into a fit and was removed unconscious from the dock.<br>
<br>Popular opinion was largely in favour of Fenning's innocence, and strenuous efforts were made to procure a remission of her sentence. The day before the execution the case was reviewed by the Home Office, which concluded that the conviction was safe. Accordingly, on the following morning, 26 June 1815, Fenning was hanged, declaring on the scaffold, &#145;Before the just and almighty God, and by the faith of the holy sacrament I have taken, I am innocent of the offence with which I am charged&#146;. Many were convinced of her innocence, and as many as 10,000 people took part in her funeral procession five days later at St George the Martyr, Bloomsbury; her coffin was carried by six girls dressed in white.<br>
