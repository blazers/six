<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Foresythe,  Reginald Charles</span>  (1907&#150;1958), <span class="occ">jazz pianist and composer</span>, was born on 28 May 1907 at 15 Hetley Road, Shepherd's Bush, London, the son of Charles Albert Foresythe, a Yoruba (Nigerian) barrister, and his wife, Charlotte Annie Falk, an Englishwoman of German descent. The family lived in the small west African community in the Shepherd's Bush area of London. Foresythe received a public school education, and studied piano and composition. Throughout his life Foresythe used his upper-class British accent to achieve some measure of acceptance in an otherwise racially segregated world. In the 1930s in Britain he won respect in jazz circles for such bold and dazzling compositions as &#145;Serenade for a Wealthy Widow&#146;, &#145;Garden of Weed&#146;, &#145;Berceuse for an Unwanted Child&#146;, &#145;The Autocrat before Breakfast&#146;, &#145;Greener the Grass&#146;, &#145;Melancholy Clown&#146;, and &#145;Dodging a Divorcee&#146;. In <span class="italic">Just Jazz 3</span> Charles Fox says: &#145;Foresythe's music frequently possessed wit as well as sophistication, charm as well as ingenuity, and certainly nobody in this country worked harder to expand the boundaries of jazz&#146;  (Traill and Lascelles, 30).<br>
<br>On a visit to New York in 1937 Foresythe composed the music for some of the songs in that year's <span class="italic">Cotton Club Parade</span>, a lavish revue with a cast headed by Ethel Waters and Duke Ellington. With lyrics by Andy Razaf, Foresythe contributed the rhumba &#145;Chile: a South American Fantasy&#146;, performed by Duke Ellington's vocalist, Ivie Anderson, and &#145;Taps is Tops&#146;, performed by the Nicholas Brothers. In America in the 1930s, jazz giants such as Louis Armstrong and Fats Waller admired Foresythe and recorded his compositions. Earl Hines used Foresythe's &#145;Deep Forest&#146; as a signature tune on his first radio series. Charles Fox recorded:<blockquote>When I spoke to Hines about Foresythe he remembered him well, and agreed that if he had only stayed in the United States, instead of returning to Britain, he might easily have become an influential and important figure in jazz. Over here, of course, his ideas were considered to be &#145;too far out&#146; even by many musicians; he was looked on, in fact, as something of a musical eccentric. The result was that a very talented jazz composer failed to live up to his early promise. (Traill and Lascelles, 30)</blockquote>When the American singer Elisabeth Welch made London her home in 1933, she began looking for an accompanist. She recalls in <span class="italic">Brief Encounters: Lesbians and Gays in British Cinema, 1930&#150;71</span>:<blockquote>When I arrived in London I was offered cabaret and variety engagements, but I didn't know anyone who could accompany me. I was given Reggie's name and of course I'd heard about him in America and Paris. He was a sweet, simple, charming person. His appearance was always immaculate and elegant. He loved good food and talked with that wonderful English upper-class accent. When we made fun of his accent, he didn't mind at all. He had a great sense of humour about himself. We all loved him. I used to go almost two or three times a week to see him perform his famous &#145;New Music&#146; at the 400 Club, a very chic place in Leicester Square. Reggie was a &#145;confirmed bachelor&#146;. I do not recall a woman ever being associated with him. I know he had liaisons with men, but they were always very discreet. (Bourne, 41)</blockquote>At the height of his popularity Foresythe made several guest appearances in British films, including <span class="italic">Calling the Tune</span> (1936), for which he composed &#145;Evergreen Restaurant&#146; and performed it as a piano solo in the film. On his return to London from New York, Foresythe worked in Mayfair clubs until the outbreak of the Second World War. Over age for active service, he volunteered for the RAF anyway. In 1941 he became an intelligence officer in the RAF and served in north Africa.<br>
<br>In the 1930s Foresythe had been ahead of his time, but after the war time seemed to have passed him by. He was soon leading bands in obscure west country hotels and playing solo piano in drinking clubs in London's Soho and Kensington. His career ended in obscurity and alcoholism. He died, aged fifty-one, on 23 December 1958 from heart failure after a fall at his home at 174 Sussex Gardens, Paddington, London.<br>
