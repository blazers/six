<span class="headword">Erskine,  John</span>, nineteenth or third earl of Mar  (<em>c.</em>1585&#150;1653), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8867/', "John Erskine, eighteenth or second earl of Mar (c.1562&#150;1634)")</script>, and his first wife, Anna, daughter of David, Lord Drummond. Educated initially at home, Lord Erskine travelled in France as a youth; he was admitted to Gray's Inn on 22 May 1603 and was created MA at Oxford on 30 August 1605. He married Lady Jean (<i>d</i>. 1668), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12715/', "Francis Hay, ninth earl of Erroll (d. 1631)")</script>, on 6 February 1610; the couple had two sons and two daughters. Created a knight of the Bath on 2 June 1610, Erskine was a member of the privy council in July 1615 and in the same year was appointed governor of Edinburgh Castle. He was named an extraordinary lord of session in 1620. Following his father's death, on 14 December 1634, he succeeded as earl of Mar.<br>
<br>Mar's support for the covenanting regime of 1638 earned the king's displeasure, and he was deprived of his command of Edinburgh Castle. In 1641 he was forbidden to attend the privy council, but was reinstated by parliament in the same year. Nevertheless, he was soon accused, along with his son Lord Erskine, of reverting to the king's party. In 1645 the pair were said to have lavishly entertained the marquess of Montrose and the principal officers of his army at Alloa, Clackmannanshire, for which act the marquess of Argyll threatened to sack the family home. Mar's defence of compulsion attracted some sympathy, since the forces of Montrose had plundered the latter town and parts of his adjoining lands, and the earl feared further excesses on their part.<br>
<br>Under pressure from all sides, Mar's political allegiances appear influenced more by his precarious financial affairs than by high principle. His business ventures, which included a monopoly over the leather trade in Scotland, were largely unsuccessful. In 1638 he resigned his lands in favour of his son to avoid his creditors, and surrendered his heritable offices&#151;including that of sheriff of Stirlingshire&#151;to the king. Compensation of &pound;8000 was granted in November 1641, but probably never honoured. Equally, Mar suffered financially at the hands of the estates, largely owing to his son's continuing support for Montrose. From the sale of certain of his Scottish lands, the earl purchased an estate in Ireland, which he lost during the Irish rising. The value of his estate much depleted, Mar died between January and October 1653. His son John (<i>d</i>. 1668) succeeded as twentieth or fourth earl.<br>
