<span class="headword">Watkins,  Francis</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1723, <em>d.</em> 1791), <span class="occ">optician</span>, the fourth son of Jeremiah Watkins and his first wife, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Whitney), was baptized in the parish of Newchurch, Radnorshire, on 25 April 1723. At the age of fourteen he was taken to London and apprenticed to the instrument maker Nathaniel Adams at the Golden Spectacles, Charing Cross. Following his master's untimely death, Watkins completed his training under Edward Scarlett senior and Henry Walder at the Archimedes, Globe and Sun in Soho, where he remained until he was sworn free of the Spectaclemakers' Company in March 1746. In the following year he returned to his original master's premises at Charing Cross to trade on his own account under the sign of Sir Isaac Newton's Head.<br>
<br>Watkins developed his early trade among those wealthy gentlemen who, largely for reasons of &#145;polite learning&#146;, wished to partake in experimental philosophy. He began by arranging shilling demonstrations in electrical experiments to promote his own electrical machine, which he sold with an accompanying tract (<span class="italic">A Particular Account of the Electrical Experiments Hitherto Made Publick</span>, 1747). As time progressed, he became keen on optics, particularly the quality of images which, at this time, were not free of coloured effects. Following some experiments in late 1751, he criticized the teacher Richard Jacks who, together with another famous maker, George Adams senior, had designed an improved refracting telescope. Later Watkins designed and developed a microscope which he accompanied with a tract in French (<span class="italic">L'exercise du microscope</span>, 1754). He was assisted by two able apprentices: Addison Smith and Henry Pyefinch, who had joined him in 1750 and 1753 respectively.<br>
<br>Watkins's growing reputation caused John Dollond (1706&#150;1761), holder of a patent for achromatic lenses, to approach him with a view to financial partnership in a venture to market refracting telescopes with these object glasses, and a binding agreement was made, dated 29 May 1758. However, this monopoly was not viewed kindly by those makers who already sold achromatic telescopes. Realizing this, after John Dollond's death Watkins began to sell his own telescopes without declaring these sales to Dollond's son, Peter. The latter then paid Watkins &pound;200 to cease manufacture, thereby becoming sole patentee. Watkins continued manufacturing, and was sued. Peter Dollond's case was upheld: this alleged injustice motivated the Spectaclemakers' Company to petition the king in June 1764 to have Dollond's patent annulled on the grounds that Chester Moor Hall was the true inventor of the achromatic lens. Watkins was master of the company at this time, and the first signatory on the petition was his former apprentice and current partner in business, Addison Smith. Much acrimony ensued but the court upheld Dollond's right to the patent, since the original inventor had not shown any financial interest in his invention. Later, when Dollond became master of the Spectaclemakers' Company, Watkins adamantly refused to pay his dues.<br>
<br>In 1748 or 1749, soon after setting up at Sir Isaac Newton's Head, Watkins married the widow Clarinda Walder; they had two daughters, Frances (<i>b</i>. 1749) and Clarinda (<i>b</i>. 1753), but no male heirs. To ensure the continuity of his business, he invited his nephews, Jeremiah and Walter, to join him. These were the sons of his elder brother's marriage to Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mines, of Hereford. After some thirty-seven years of trading, Watkins retired to Richmond, though he retained an interest in both the business and his various properties at Charing Cross. He died in Richmond, Surrey, on 17 November 1791, and his nephews inherited the business. After Walter's death in 1798 the business was continued by Jeremiah until his death in 1810. It was then run on behalf of Jeremiah's widow, Charlotte, by William Hill, a reliable employee, until Jeremiah's son, another Francis, came of age in 1818. The partnership between Hill and the younger Francis Watkins lasted twenty-nine years until 1847, when both partners died. The Watkins business was exceptional in having traded for over a century, but in 1856 it was acquired from the family by the brothers C. A. and F. H. Elliott, the sons of William Elliott, a mathematical instrument maker.<br>
