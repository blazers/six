<span class="headword">Lowther, Sir  Gerard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1590&#150;1660), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was according to Sir William Betham the illegitimate son of Sir Christopher Lowther (<i>d</i>. 1617) of Penrith, Cumberland. Raised within the family circle, he is probably the Gerard Lowther who entered Queen's College, Oxford, in 1605. After call to the bar by Gray's Inn in 1614, he elected to pursue his fortunes in Ireland where two of his uncles, one of whom was also called Gerard, were to attain judicial office in the 1610s. The elder <a name="cosubject_17107"></a><span class="headword">Sir Gerard Lowther</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1624)<span class="occ"></span> was a younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17112/', "Sir Richard Lowther (1532&#150;1608)")</script> of Lowther, Westmorland, and his wife, Frances, daughter of John Middleton of Middleton, Westmorland. He entered the Inner Temple in 1580 and was called to the bar in 1590. Appointed a justice of common pleas in Ireland by patent dated 12 October 1610, he was recorded the following year as &#145;like to do good service&#146; in a court whose judges were characterized by age and infirmity  (Bewley, 3). A friend of Richard Boyle, earl of Cork, he was returned MP for Tallow, a borough in the earl's sway, in 1613. In 1616 he served as treasurer of King's Inns and in 1618 was knighted by the lord deputy. By then he had acquired land in co. Fermanagh and co. Tyrone under the Ulster plantation and he was granted market and fair privileges for Lowtherstown in co. Fermanagh. He married, first, Grace (1557/8&#150;1594), daughter of Alan Bellingham of Levens, Westmorland, and widow of Edmund Cliburn, and second, Anne Welbury (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Bulmer), daughter and coheir of Sir Ralph Bulmer of Wilton, Durham. There were no children by either marriage and at his death, on 14 October 1624, he bequeathed the bulk of his property to his nephew Richard Lowther and his godson the younger Gerard Lowther. He was buried on 16 October in Christ Church, Dublin.<br>
<br>Admitted to King's Inns, Dublin, in 1619, the younger Gerard Lowther was named attorney-general of Munster three years later at the salary of 20 marks a year. Through the influence of Richard Boyle, earl of Cork, he was made a baron of the Irish exchequer in 1628, where, for some years, he served on the same bench with his other uncle, Lancelot Lowther. With the removal from office of Dominick Sarsfield, the chief justice of the Irish common pleas, in 1633, the younger man, who had been knighted two years earlier, was destined to secure an even higher prize. Boyle pressed for the promotion of the new Sir Gerard to fill the vacancy, greasing the palm of Sir Thomas Wentworth, recently installed as Irish lord deputy, with the promise of &pound;1000 if he carried out his side of the bargain. The new chief justice, not for the last time, then altered his allegiance, attaching himself to Wentworth and helping to oversee the legal and administrative reforms that the latter was to implement. The fall from favour of Wentworth (now earl of Strafford) in late 1640 threatened Lowther's career with an abrupt termination. In February 1641 impeachment proceedings were commenced in the Irish parliament against four of Wentworth's most prominent Irish associates, including Lowther. The proceedings dragged on, but those directed against Lowther and Lord Chancellor Bolton were eventually dropped in June 1642.<br>
<br>Prominent in the business of the Irish privy council in the mid-1640s, Lowther emerged as a member of the faction opposed to accommodation with the Catholics of the confederation of Kilkenny. The impending collapse of the royalist cause in Ireland led to his changing sides yet again, surviving the change of regime after the trial and execution of the king to be confirmed in judicial office in 1651. He is best glimpsed in this final phase of his career as the author of the harangue delivered by him at the inauguration the following year of the special non-jury high court of justice set up to try assorted rebels, traitors, and malefactors, later printed in Edmund Borlase's <span class="italic">History of the Execrable Irish Rebellion</span> (1680). Though one of the commissioners of the great seal of Ireland in 1655&#150;6, Lowther's chameleon past earned him no special favours, and he was a conspicuous absentee from the Irish council on which he had previously served under Wentworth and Ormond. Throughout his career, as the Dublin statute staple records make clear, Lowther loaned substantial sums of money: &pound; 15,000 between 1628 and 1659. He married, first, in 1621, Ann (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1634), the daughter of Sir Laurence Parsons, whom he succeeded on the exchequer in 1628, and, second, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1658), daughter of Sir John King, the muster-master general of Ireland. Lowther died in Dublin on 3 April 1660 on the eve of the Restoration, and was buried at St Michan's Church, Dublin. He left no children.<br>
