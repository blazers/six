<span class="headword">Jones,  Harriet Morant</span>  (1833&#150;1917), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born in Guernsey on 2 January 1833. On her mother's side she was of French Huguenot descent. Nothing is known about her education. When she was appointed first headmistress of the Notting Hill high school, which opened in September 1873, she was forty years old. Emily Shirreff described her as &#145;a lady of great experience and ability&#146;  (Sayers, 17): she had run her own school in Guernsey, and she was apparently invited to take the headship of the second of the Girls' Public Day School Company's schools (the first had opened in Chelsea in January). She was to become one of the foremost headmistresses of her day. At first, in the one large schoolroom in Norland Square, Holland Park, she taught the top class all subjects except arithmetic. As there were only ten pupils when the school opened, she had just the one assistant, her sister, &#145;Miss Anna&#146;. By the end of the first school year there were some eighty children and Miss Jones set out to appoint her staff. She had the two essential qualities of a successful head: a genius for selecting promising teachers and keeping them happy, and a personality which won the respect of both parents and pupils. Although no real academic herself, she believed passionately in the education of women and in women working. Before the end of 1874 she had formed the ambitious idea of sending six of the pupils in for the Cambridge senior local examinations. She was against introducing non-academic subjects, such as needlework, into the curriculum. The school soon had a high academic reputation.<br>
<br>Living close to Miss Jones in Norland Square were her sister and her brother-in-law, the Revd Charles Du Port, chief inspector of schools. His daughter, Winifred, and another of Miss Jones's nieces, Edith Jones (alias de Grave), were to attend the high school. Winifred went up to Girton College, Cambridge, for two terms and then returned to teach the lower forms. Edith spent a year at Somerville College, Oxford, and did the Oxford examination for women.<br>
<br>Opinions vary as to Miss Jones's success as a teacher. Her specialist subjects were French and German. By the 1880s and 1890s, however, she was teaching scripture and history, and the schoolgirls of this era were decidedly less impressed than their predecessors, regarding the lessons as &#145;something of jokes&#146; and &#145;old-fashioned even by the standards of the day&#146;  (Sayers, 19). She stuck rigidly to her notes, which she went over again and again. In any case, her strength was by now reflected in the strength of her staff. By this date old girls of the school who had been at the women's colleges were being pressed by the head to return and take up appointments. One such, Mary Adamson, recorded how she was invited back to teach science, a subject Miss Jones was &#145;indifferent to, or even disliked&#146;  (ibid., 104). Miss Adamson was the teacher of Dame Harriette Chick. The teaching was at this time of a very high quality in all subjects. Before the end of Miss Jones's headmistress-ship, an inspector reported that &#145;every teacher of competence is only too glad, if she can, to obtain a post at Notting Hill&#146;  (ibid., 99). Many headmistresses were recruited from this source.<br>
<br>The physical features and the personality of Miss Jones have been described by many of the pupils, generations of whom knew her as Jonah. To look at she was imposing. She was tall, handsome, and impressive. She wore silk underskirts which rustled, and was often dressed in regal purple velvet, edged with fur, her black plaits forming a coronet on top of her head. She had a deep sonorous voice, and a &#145;stimulating and cheering personality&#146; which &#145;inspired all who worked under her&#146;. Miss Jones &#145;always saw before her the Golden Age in which the Victorians believed&#146;: in which not only were women to be properly educated, and to receive the Parliamentary vote, but the slums were to be cleared, unemployment to cease, and all abuses be reformed, and in all these things &#145;Notting Hillites would bear their worthy part&#146;  (Sayers, 18).<br>
<br>In 1887 she was co-signatory (with Frances Buss and Fanny Metcalfe) to a memorial to the University of Cambridge asking for the admission of women to degrees. In 1894 she gave evidence on behalf of the Association of Head Mistresses of Endowed and Proprietary Schools before the Bryce commission (on secondary education), and in 1897 and 1898 she served as third president of the association, following Miss Buss and Miss Beale. She had been a member of the council of the Maria Grey Training College from its early days in Bishopsgate and had an interest in the National Union of Women Workers. She retired in 1900. Harriet Morant Jones died at her home, 41 Norland Square, Holland Park, London, on 20 October 1917 and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
