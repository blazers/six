<span class="headword">Balmer,  George</span>  (1805&#150;1846), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born at North Shields, Northumberland, on 3 November 1805, and baptized on 5 January 1806 at Tynemouth, Northumberland, the second son of George Balmer (<i>c</i>.1767&#150;1829), house and ship painter, and Ann Reed (<i>d</i>. 1835), of Stannington, Northumberland. At the age of fourteen he decided to follow his father's trade and after serving an apprenticeship with the firm joined former Newcastle housepainter Thomas Coulson's decorating business in Edinburgh. Here he became acquainted with the work of fellow Coulson employee John Wilson Ewbank, and, inspired to try his own hand as a professional artist, returned to North Shields. In 1826 he sent his first work for exhibition, showing <span class="italic">A View of North Shields</span>, at the Northumberland Institution for the Promotion of the Fine Arts, Newcastle upon Tyne. He again exhibited at this institution in the following year, and showed no fewer than seven works at the first exhibition of Newcastle's newly opened Northern Academy, in 1828. He continued to exhibit at Newcastle for several years, and in 1830 sent his first work to the British Institution: <span class="italic">Fishing Lodge Near Inch Islay on the Tay&#151;Moonlight</span>. In 1831 he moved from North Shields to Newcastle, and in this year showed at the town's exhibition of watercolours one of his best known works, <span class="italic">The Juicy Tree Bit</span>, and collaborated in the production of another, <span class="italic">The heroic exploit of Lord Collingwood, when captain of the Excellent at the Battle of Cape St Vincent</span> (Trinity House, Newcastle), with his close friend John Wilson Carmichael. As far as can be determined he remained at Newcastle until late in 1833, when he decided to move to London. In 1834 he sent his first work for exhibition at the Suffolk Street Gallery of the Society of British Artists, London, and also exhibited at Newcastle. He then set off on a tour of Holland, thereafter proceeding up the Rhine, and travelling through Switzerland, making several studies of the Alps <i>en route</i>. He next went to Paris, where he spent several months studying at the Louvre, and copied the work of Cuyp, Claude Lorrain, Paul Potter, and Ruisdael. Back in London by 1835 he called on his friend and fellow artist John Wykeham Archer, and announced his intention of practising there. He remained in London until 1842, during which period he continued to exhibit at the British Institution and the Suffolk Street Gallery showing scenes of the continent and north-east England; among the former were <span class="italic">Scene Near Dordrecht</span> and <span class="italic">Haarlem Mere&#151;Moonlight</span>, and among the latter <span class="italic">Entrance to the Port of Sunderland</span> and <span class="italic">The Salmon Leap at Bywell</span>. Several of these works were bought by wealthy collectors, notably Harrison of Liverpool. In 1836 Balmer suggested to the engraver and publisher brothers Edward and William Finden a publication on <span class="italic">The Ports, Harbours, Watering-Places and Picturesque Scenery of Great Britain</span>. They accepted his proposal and many of his views of parts of north-eastern England appeared in a volume published in 1842. A short time after its publication Balmer inherited some property at Gateshead, co. Durham, and retired there without exhibiting again. He died at Bensham Grove, Bensham, Gateshead, on 10 April 1846 following an illness, and was buried in Jesmond old cemetery, Newcastle. He was predeceased by his wife, Mary Ann Cook (<i>d</i>. 1843), and survived by his only son, George. Balmer's reputation as a coastal painter was considerable in his day; his friend Archer observed in a long obituary in the <span class="italic">Art Union</span> of October 1846: &#145;My old friend was never so much in his element as when painting a stranded ship, an old lighthouse, or the rippling of the waves on a shingly coast&#146;.<br>
