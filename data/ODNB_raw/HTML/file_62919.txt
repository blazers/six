<span class="headword">Wood,  Abram</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1799), <span class="occ">Gypsy patriarch</span>, is a figure about whom information is meagre and mostly traditional. His surname is of English origin and it may be presumed that he migrated into Wales. His forename, like that of his wife, Sarah, is biblical, but his ancestry is completely obscure. However, a clear reference to Wood by name occurs in an interlude by Thomas Edwards (Twm o'r Nant), <span class="italic">Pleser a gofid</span> (1787), in which his &#145;cousin&#146;, Auntie Sal from the south, describes him as travelling &#145;Wales and England&#146;.<br>
<br>A colourful description of Wood was left by his great-granddaughter Saiforella:<blockquote>Abram was very tall, not so very lusty, and middling thin. His complexion was very dark, with rosy cheeks. His face was round as an apple, and he had a double chin and a small mouth&#151;very small for a man. He always rode on horseback, on a blood-horse, and would not sleep in the open, but in barns. He wore a three-cocked hat with gold lace, a silk coat with swallow tails&#151;sometimes red, sometimes green, and sometimes black&#151;and a waistcoat embroidered with green leaves. The buttons on the coat were half-crowns, those on the waistcoat shillings. His breeches were white, tied with silk ribbons, and there were bunches of ribbons at the knees. On his feet he wore pumps with silver buckles and silver spurs, and he wore two gold rings&#151;only two&#151;and a gold watch and chain. (Jarman and Jarman, <span class="italic">Y Sipsiwn Cymreig</span>, 65)</blockquote>This idealized description of Abram Wood no doubt preserves family memories; yet it accords well with more generalized accounts of Gypsy chieftains arriving on the continent.<br>
<br>Abram Wood and his wife, Sarah, had three sons, Valentine, William, and Solomon, and a daughter, Damaris. From the three sons descended a numerous progeny known in Welsh as &#145;Teulu Abram Wood&#146; (&#145;the family of Abram Wood&#146;): a name which rapidly became used for Gypsies in general in Wales, although other families also migrated into the country. Among his descendants were many colourful characters such as Alabaina, Sylvaina, Saiforella, and Ellen Ddu (Black Ellen), all celebrated practitioners of the arts of magic and fortune telling. A number of male descendants also took up the art of harp playing and included such well-known players of the instrument as John Roberts of Newtown (1816&#150;1894) and Jeremiah Wood (<i>c</i>.1778&#150;1867), who was family harpist to the Gogerddan family for fifty years. At least twenty-six harpists extending over six generations were descended from Abram Wood and it is probable that they preserved much traditional Welsh music which would otherwise have been lost. Black Ellen was notable among her own people as a teller of traditional folk tales and these were collected as narrated by her great-nephew Mathew Wood.<br>
<br>Abram Wood's first language was Romani and this was retained by many of his descendants down to the twentieth century, although it is now virtually lost. This speech was a pure and archaic form of Romani which was fully described by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35925/', "John Sampson")</script> in his monumental grammar <span class="italic">The Dialect of the Gypsies of Wales</span> (1926). This also contains a large collection of sayings, aphorisms, names, and riddles attributed to the Woods.<br>
<br>Abram Wood's death on 12 November 1799 is recorded in the parish register of Llangelynnin, Merioneth, where he is described as: &#145;Abram Woods a travelling Egyptian.&#146; His reputed grave in Llangelynnin churchyard has the later date of 1800.<br>
