<span class="headword">Wilson,  John Dove</span>  (1833&#150;1908), <span class="occ">legal writer</span>, was born at Linton, Roxburghshire, on 21 July 1833 and baptized (in an Episcopal chapel) on 7 October that year, the son of Charles Wilson, doctor, of Kelso (afterwards of Edinburgh), and his wife, Elizabeth Dove. He was educated at the grammar school, Kelso, and Edinburgh University, he studied law at Edinburgh, spent a session at Berlin University and was called to the Scottish bar in 1857. He married, on 12 June 1863 (according to Presbyterian rites) Anna Campbell (<i>d</i>. 1901), daughter of John Carnegie of Redhall. They had two sons and one daughter. He was appointed sheriff-substitute of Kincardineshire, taking up his residence at Stonehaven until 1870, when he was transferred to Aberdeen. This position he held with distinction for twenty years, establishing his reputation as an able lawyer and a conscientious judge.<br>
<br>Wilson, who wrote much in legal periodicals, had a profound knowledge of jurisprudence, and also revised and wrote a number of standard legal texts on Scots law, notably <span class="italic">The Practice of the Sheriff Courts of Scotland in Civil Causes</span>, which went to four editions (1869, 1875, 1883, 1891). He was an enthusiastic advocate of legal reform, especially in the matter of codification and the simplification of procedure.<br>
<br>Some of the reforms Wilson proposed were realized at a later date. He gave evidence before parliamentary committees on bills of sale and civil imprisonment, and aided various lord-advocates in the drafting of bills, particularly the <span class="roman">Sheriff Court Act</span> of 1876 and the <span class="roman">Bills of Exchange Act</span> of 1882. He took a prominent part in the movement for the codification of commercial law which began in 1884. In that year he received the degree of LLD from Aberdeen University.<br>
<br>On resigning his judicial office in 1890 Wilson was from 1891 to 1901 professor of law at Aberdeen. After studying Roman law for a season at Leipzig he revived the study at Aberdeen. He helped to found a lectureship on conveyancing, and to form a law library. In 1895&#150;6 he served as Storr's lecturer on municipal law at Yale University.<br>
<br>Wilson had a wide knowledge of French, German, and Italian, and published some verse translations. He was active in philanthropic work in Aberdeen and was president of the Aberdeen Philosophical Society. He died at San Remo, Italy, on 24 January 1908, and was buried at Allenvale cemetery, Aberdeen.<br>
