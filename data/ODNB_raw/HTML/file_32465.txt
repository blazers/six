<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Coates,  (Joseph) Gordon</span>  (1878&#150;1943), <span class="occ">prime minister of New Zealand</span>, was born on 3 February 1878 at Ruatuna, just outside Matakohe in Northland, New Zealand, the son of an English father, Edward Coates (1843&#150;1905), and his northern Irish wife, Eleanor Kathleen Aickin (1851&#150;1935). His family gave qualified support to the New Zealand Liberal Party, which dominated politics in New Zealand between 1891 and 1912.<br>
<br>Coates grew to maturity on the 2420 acre farm at Ruatuna that was slowly being reclaimed from forest and scrub. The area was isolated and not connected to Auckland by road or rail until the 1920s. It was served by a daily steamer from Helensville across the Kaipara harbour. There were few roads in Northland; contact with neighbours was by horse or punt. Telephones were slow to arrive. Coates had several years' schooling at Matakohe School, but the gentlemanly polish that he displayed in later years came from a governess employed by his mother to help educate her two boys and four girls, and special tutoring. Edward Coates was a manic depressive. His land was owned by his brother-in-law, and money was short. In the 1890s Edward withdrew from the community in which he had been a leading citizen, leaving the farm to his wife and children. By the time he was twelve Gordon carried many responsibilities. He could handle a gun and shot wild pigs, ducks, and pheasants. He played rugby, rode horses at shows, and attended the small local Anglican church. Gordon grew to 6 feet, with broad shoulders and a head of auburn hair. By the time he was elected to the Otamatea county council in 1905 (he was chairman between 1913 and 1916) Coates was a volunteer in the Otamatea mounted rifles and a vigorous supporter of the public works policies of the Liberal premier, Richard John Seddon, and his successor, Sir Joseph Ward.<br>
<br>In 1911 Coates stood for parliament for Kaipara as an independent Liberal, winning on the second ballot. He held the seat until his death. Believing that he had fulfilled his promise to his electors to support Sir Joseph Ward, he voted in July 1912 with W. F. Massey's Reform Party to topple the Liberal government, and became a Reform Party member before the 1914 election. Coates's early career in the house was undistinguished. He supported public works, particularly in the north, and championed kauri gum diggers who were exhausting their resource and who, after the outbreak of war in 1914, experienced reduced markets. Coates was no orator, but he possessed a genial informality that won him a wide circle of friends. He was best known as a handsome, eligible bachelor; nevertheless, there had been an earlier relationship with a Maori woman, with whom he was said to have had a son and a daughter. On 4 August 1914 he married a recent English immigrant, Marjorie Grace Coles (1891&#150;1973). They had five daughters.<br>
<br>Coates had acquired a love of the empire at his father's knee. He left for France in November 1916 with the 19th reinforcements to the New Zealand expeditionary force, holding the rank of captain. On 31 July 1917 he won a Military Cross at La Basseville, and a bar to his MC at Mailly-Maillet on 26 March 1918. Promoted to major, and carrying a wound to his leg which in later years gave him a sometimes rolling gait that opponents put down to drink, Coates returned from the front and was soon promoted by W. F. Massey to his cabinet. On 2 September 1919 he became postmaster-general and minister of justice. After Massey's re-election in December 1919 Coates was minister of public works, then minister of railways after 1923. As the youngest minister in an ageing cabinet, and possessing a war record, Coates attracted attention. He prioritized road and rail construction programmes and edged the state into a monopoly position as the producer of hydroelectricity. He was the obvious successor to Prime Minister Massey when he died in May 1925.<br>
<br>Described as a &#145;tall, lithe man, erect and soldierly in figure, a stranger to fatigue&#146;  (<span class="italic">Evening Post</span>, 21 July 1925), Coates was sworn as prime minister on 30 May 1925. He was to become the first New Zealand born premier to win a general election. His breezy informality became the subject of an extravagant advertising campaign, and in the December election he was returned with the largest majority in Reform's career. However, a lacklustre cabinet, declining commodity prices, and rising unemployment proved beyond Coates's control. A botched effort to fix dairy prices on the London market in 1926 damaged his reputation, even though the idea was not his. Some Reform supporters accused Coates of socialist interventions both in welfare and commerce. After an election in November 1928, when Reform lost its majority, Coates's government was toppled from office on a confidence vote by a resurgent Sir Joseph Ward, now seventy-three, who briefly enjoyed the support of the growing Labour Party. Ironically, Coates had originally entered parliament as a supporter of Ward. Coates led the opposition for three years until a threatened economic collapse forced him into coalition with Ward's successor, George Forbes. Coates served as minister of public works and employment, then, from 1933 to 1935, as minister of finance.<br>
<br>Coates displayed a degree of unorthodoxy, supporting retrenchment, devaluation of the New Zealand currency, then the establishment of a reserve bank. He promoted legislation to allow farmers to refinance loans at lower interest rates, so as to bring their overheads into line with reduced incomes. This incurred the wrath of those with money, and led to the intervention at the 1935 election of a third party, the Democrats, who split the conservative vote. Nothing, it seemed, could lift Coates's standing with those who had lost jobs or farms as a result of the slump. The national coalition was defeated in November 1935 by the Labour Party. It proceeded to introduce state housing, guaranteed prices for dairy farmers, and social security for all. Coates's readjustments to the economy and better overseas prices made Labour's reforms easier to afford.<br>
<br>In opposition after 1935, Coates was not chosen to lead the newly formed National Party (formed out of the Reform and United parties in May 1936). He spent more time with his family on the farm at Ruatuna. When war broke out he offered his services to the Labour government. On 16 July 1940 he joined Prime Minister Peter Fraser's war cabinet, becoming minister of armed forces and war co-ordination. Coates became a trusted confidant of Fraser's and a strong advocate of a non-partisan approach to New Zealand's wartime effort, first in the Middle East, Greece, and Crete, then, after December 1941, also in the Pacific theatre of war. Coates's reputation as a depression skinflint was gradually transformed for the better. He got credit towards the end of his life for being a solid, sensible, patriotic New Zealander who put country ahead of party. He has been seen since as a reformer who vigorously pushed the state into public works and banking, and with his rudimentary family allowances of 1926, nudged it into the area of income maintenance. After a lifetime of energetic activity and constant smoking Coates died suddenly on 27 May 1943 in his office in the parliament buildings in Wellington. He was buried at Matakohe church cemetery on 1 June. Appropriately, perhaps, it was Fraser's Labourites, more than his own colleagues, who mourned his passing. He was survived by his wife and daughters. Ownership of his farm subsequently passed to the New Zealand Historic Places Trust.<br>
<br>Coates moved with the ebbs and flows of New Zealand politics for more than thirty years. A vigorous proponent of state activity, he refused to accept that he was a socialist. Reviled by workers because of his depression policies, he was none the less friends with politicians of all stripes.<br>
