<span class="headword">Mocatta family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1671&#150;1957), <span class="occ">bullion dealers and brokers</span>, traces its origins in the City of London to <a name="cosubject_77019"></a><span class="headword">Moses Mocatta</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1693), who came from Amsterdam where his forebears, of Portuguese origin, were leading diamond-traders. Active as a merchant and diamond dealer in London by 1671, he established a significant presence by regularly acquiring Indian diamonds, often through the East India Company, and paying for them with silver and gold, which the company then shipped to India. From the outset the Mocattas closely identified with London's Jewish community and the Portuguese synagogue at Bevis Marks.<br>
<br>Moses Mocatta died at Amsterdam in 1693 leaving a widow, Rebecca (who was his niece), three daughters, and two sons; his business may have been in abeyance until his sons <a name="cosubject_60302"></a><span class="headword">Abraham [i] Mocatta</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1751)<span class="occ"></span> and Isaac (<i>d</i>. 1729, unmarried) came of age. By 1701 Abraham [i] was working as a general merchant, and later he also became a stockbroker; in 1710 he acquired a much coveted broker's medal, which had eluded his father, licensing him as one of twelve &#145;Jew brokers&#146; to do business on the royal exchange. Soon he emerged as London's premier silver broker.<h2>
<a name="Silverbroking"></a>Silver broking</h2>Abraham [i] Mocatta's transactions were of enormous extent; between 1713 and 1725 two-thirds of the Bank of England's loans against silver were made to him. Underpinning this was his work as exclusive bullion broker to the bank, the East India Company, and the Royal Mint. In 1717 he co-ordinated a gigantic but somewhat obscure transaction, probably for the bank's account, involving the purchase of 1 million ounces of silver against loans of &pound;300,000, as a step to support silver prices and stem silver exports. His significance within London's merchant community was such that in 1744 he joined the group of merchants pledging loyalty to George II and the support of &#145;public credit&#146; in the face of Charles Edward Stuart's claim to the throne. His commercial links with North America were important and in 1728 he offered to purchase land for a New York synagogue.<br>
<br>Abraham [i]'s marriage on 3 October 1712 to Grace (<i>d</i>. 1753), daughter of Abraham Levy Ximenes, produced no son but a daughter, Rebecca Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1737). Her second husband, whom she married in 1730, was <a name="cosubject_60303"></a><span class="headword">Moses Lumbrozo  de Mattos</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1759)<span class="occ"></span>, a London broker since about 1740, and they had a daughter and two sons, <a name="cosubject_60301"></a><span class="headword">Abraham [ii] Mocatta</span>  (1730&#150;1800)<span class="occ"></span> and Jacob. Mattos joined Abraham [i] in partnership, though they shared neither premises nor a trading name, but on the latter's retirement from the royal exchange in 1749 Mattos did not receive the broker's licence. It went instead to Mattos's son Abraham [ii].<br>
<br>Abraham [i] died at Bevis Marks in 1751 and was succeeded as leader by Mattos, who died in 1759. Abraham [ii] succeeded as head of the business and his reputation as London's premier bullion broker came to rival that of his grandfather. By 1763 he styled himself Abraham de Mattos Mocatta; he changed his name to Mocatta in 1791, thereby keeping the surname alive. His marriage in 1759 to Esther (1737&#150;1799), daughter of Isaac Lamego, resulted in a family of six sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>The role of exclusive broker in precious metals to the bank continued. Notably Abraham [ii] assisted with massive gold purchases required for the recoinage of gold guineas between 1773 and 1777 and was responsible for much of the daily management of the sterling exchange rate. His firm was known as Mocatta and Keyser from about 1777, when Alexander Isaks Keyser (<i>d</i>. 1779) was admitted a partner. However, it seems that Keyser took over the royal exchange licence in 1767.<br>
<br>Shortly after 1779 Asher Goldsmid, son of a London merchant of Dutch origin and son-in-law of Keyser, joined the partnership; his elder brothers, Abraham and Benjamin, were to be major government loan contractors during the French wars. Following his admission the business was restyled Mocatta and Goldsmid about 1782.<br>
<br>Abraham [ii] Mocatta died in London in January 1800 leaving estate of &pound;150,000; seventeen mourning coaches attended his funeral and he directed that for one year three men should watch over his grave. His sons appear as unremarkable businessmen and Goldsmid succeeded as senior. Three of Abraham's sons, Isaac (1765&#150;1801), Moses (1768&#150;1857), and Jacob (1770&#150;1825), had joined as partners; but Isaac was dismissed in 1793 for unauthorized speculation, and Moses chose to retire in mid-life to devote himself to social and philanthropic works and to study. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64318/', "David Alfred Mocatta (1806&#150;1882)")</script>, son of Moses, was an architect noted for his work for the London, Brighton, and South Coast railway. Another son, Isaac Lindo (1818&#150;1879), wrote tracts on Jewish moral teachings and social questions.<br>
<br>For the next forty years the Goldsmids dominated the business, especially Asher (<i>d</i>. 1822) and his sons Sir Isaac Lyon and Aron Asher. As though to underline the position, no Mocatta was called upon to give evidence to the 1810 select committee on the high price of bullion.<br>
<br>From 1840, when the bank ended its exclusive brokerage arrangements with Mocatta and Goldsmid thereby greatly diminishing the firm's significance (although such arrangements continued with the India Office), the firm once more came under the Mocattas' leadership. The senior was now <a name="cosubject_59421"></a><span class="headword">Abraham [iii] Mocatta</span>  (1797&#150;1880)<span class="occ"></span>, grandson of Abraham [ii] through his third son, Jacob. Abraham [iii] had joined as a partner in 1826. On 27 May 1818 he had married Miriam, daughter of Gabriel Israel Brandon; they had two sons and two daughters: the elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35050/', "Frederic David Mocatta (1828&#150;1905)")</script>, joined the firm about 1843 and was admitted a partner in 1849. Frederic married Mary Ada (1836&#150;1905), daughter of the politician Frederick David Goldsmid, in 1856; there were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Under their leadership the business was revitalized, and it now benefited from gold discoveries in California and Australia and the consequent shift of the world towards a gold standard. Abraham [iii] retired in 1859 and died at 35 Gloucester Place, Portman Square, in central London, on 21 April 1880. His son Frederic followed him into retirement in 1874 leaving an outsider, Sir Hector Hay, baronet (1821&#150;1916), and two nephews, Benjamin and Abraham (<i>c</i>.1853&#150;1891), to lead the business.<h2>
<a name="ContributionstoJewishsociallife"></a>Contributions to Jewish social life</h2>More than any other member of his family, Frederic made his mark away from the City, largely through his promotion of philanthropy and Jewish religion and culture. Educated at home he excelled at history and became fluent in five or six languages. As a young man he supported Jewish schools in London's East End and later extended his interests:<blockquote>the condition of the working classes of all creeds, the improvement of their dwellings, and the administration of charities&#151;Jewish and gentile, public and private&#151;with a view to promoting the independence of the poor, were amongst the principal objects which engaged his attention. (F. D. Mocatta, 17)</blockquote>Frederic was a founding member of the Charity Organization Society, which sought to prevent duplication of effort and promote proper management. He favoured the amalgamation of institutions to create more effective and viable units; he was the architect of the Home for Aged Jews and of the Jewish Orphanage. He also promoted the Charity Voting Reform Association and gave generously to charitable institutions ranging from the Factory Girls' Country Home Fund to the Philanthropic Society for the Reformation of Criminal Children. But his philosophy was to render the poor independent of charity and thus cure the causes of poverty. For this reason he opposed the provision of state pensions in old age. As a member of the Jewish Board of Guardians he was concerned with the welfare of Jewish immigrants in London's East End. He worked also for the well-being of Jews persecuted in Russia and Romania.<br>
<br>In promoting Jewish religion and culture Frederic published modestly, his best-known works covering Jews in Spain and Portugal and the Inquisition, but his support of the publications of others had more impact. At his death in January 1905 his large library was bequeathed to the Mocatta Museum and Library which from 1906 was located in University College, London, where it came to form a foundation for Jewish studies.<h2>
<a name="Leadingthebullionmarket"></a>Leading the bullion market</h2>The Mocattas returned to leadership of their firm in the twentieth century. In 1900 <a name="cosubject_75307"></a><span class="headword">Edgar Mocatta</span>  (1879&#150;1957)<span class="occ"></span>, great-grandson of Abraham [iii] and son of Abraham [iv] (1853&#150;1891), a partner who died tragically when young, and his wife, Florence Justina Cohen (1859&#150;1920), was admitted a partner. For much of the next fifty-seven years Edgar Mocatta was the City's leading authority on the bullion market and was dubbed the &#145;silver king&#146;. This reputation was won through transactions such as the 1913 rescue of the Indian Specie Bank, which was hopelessly over-extended through massive silver speculation, and through co-ordinating silver purchases of allied governments during the First World War. The British and Indian governments, together with the Bank of England, frequently sought his advice and confidential execution of sensitive transactions. He married in 1913 Mabel, daughter of Alfred Beddington of Cornwall Terrace, Regent's Park, London.<br>
<br>In 1957, after several difficult years for the London bullion market consequent to the effects of world war and changing patterns of demand and market procedures, the Mocattas sold their business to Hambros Bank ending almost 300 years of business as an independent entity. Edgar then joined Hambros' board but died at his London office, 7 Throgmorton Avenue, London Wall, on 30 September that year.<br>
<br>The Mocatta family, in particular Abraham [i] and his grandson Abraham [ii], dominated the London bullion market for most of the eighteenth century and thereafter played an influential part in it until the 1950s. Having accumulated wealth they were inevitably distracted into other areas of life and here their role, especially that of Frederic, in promoting Jewish culture was significant.<br>
