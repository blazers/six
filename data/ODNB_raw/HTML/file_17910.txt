<span class="headword">Malvern,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1422), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was probably born in or near the town of Malvern in Worcestershire. His origins remain obscure, but his presence at heresy trials held in the diocese of Hereford, in 1393, and his appointment at some point before 1398 as master of the hospital of St Catherine in Ledbury, Herefordshire, suggest that he came from this area. By 1393, when he took his place among the distinguished commissioners appointed to try the two Lollards, William Swinderby and Walter Bryt, Malvern had already served as a chaplain at Balliol College, Oxford. He had also graduated as a master of arts and doctor of theology, at Oxford University, and may, in addition, have obtained there the doctorate in medicine credited to him later in copies of his short tract, <span class="italic">Contra pestilenciam</span>.<br>
<br>Malvern owed much of his success to an early connection with Henry Bolingbroke, the future Henry IV, who retained him as one of his domestic physicians in 1395 and may have enlisted his professional services while attempting to restore order in the north ten years later. It is, however, possible that Malvern had actually travelled to York in 1405 to attend the leader of the rebel forces, rather than the king. Malvern was reputedly one of the last bystanders to whom Richard Scrope, archbishop of York, spoke before his execution outside the city walls, on 8 June, and is said to have known him well. If he had, indeed, been treating Scrope as a patient, the latter's parting words appear especially poignant. Not even Malvern's battery of cures, he remarked, could save the life of one who was now beyond earthly medicine; and so he had no further need of physic. Such a potentially embarrassing attachment had no apparent effect upon the upward trajectory of Malvern's career or the support of his royal patron, who continued to regard him with favour. In 1408, for instance, he was promoted to a canon's stall at St George's Chapel, Windsor.<br>
<br>Malvern's other distinguished patients included Richard Mitford, bishop of Salisbury, who employed him at considerable expense during his last illness in 1407. He also had links with Archbishop Thomas Arundel. He acted at the trial of John Badby before the archbishop in 1409, while the Lollard, William Thorpe, in his account of his interview with Arundel at Saltwood Castle in 1407, tells how when the laymen were dismissed, and the archbishop withdrew into a &#145;privy closet&#146;, among the clerics in attendance was &#145;a phisician that is clepid Maluerne&#146;  (Hudson, 29). That his practice was not confined to the narrow, theoretical world of academic medicine is evident from the survival of a vernacular receipt for a prophylactic for &#145;purging phlegm, choler and melancholy&#146; attributed to him; and, although it was composed in Latin for an educated readership, his plague tract likewise suggests a pragmatic approach to preventative medicine. It provides a succinct pr&eacute;cis of the scholarly literature and survives in many copies.<br>
<br>Medieval English physicians were customarily rewarded with lucrative benefices, and Malvern's impressive collection attests his skill as a practitioner. In addition to his mastership of St Catherine's Hospital in Ledbury, which he retained until after 1409, he held a succession of rectories, notably that of St Dunstan-in-the-East, London, which he occupied from 1402 until his death. His appointment as a canon of St Paul's Cathedral followed two years later, and he acquired and exchanged several other livings. Yet London, where the richest and most influential patients were to be found, remained his home. He died there between 12 and 14 March 1422, having requested burial at St Dunstan's, to which he left four of his books. These included a collection of sermons, a &#145;prophecy of Merlin&#146;, a copy of the <span class="italic">Golden Legend</span>, and works by Seneca and Guillaume d'Auvergne. To Balliol, his old college, went a book of commentaries on Aristotle's <span class="italic">Ethics</span> and <span class="italic">Politics</span>. His short, businesslike will contains no mention of any surviving relatives.<br>
