<span class="headword">Gamgee,  John</span>  (1831&#150;1894), <span class="occ">veterinary surgeon and inventor</span>, was born in the via de Pizzacotti, Florence, Italy, the fourth of the eight children of Joseph Gamgee (1801&#150;1894) and his wife, Mary Ann, daughter of John and Sarah West of Honiton, Devon. His elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10326/', "Joseph Sampson Gamgee (1828&#150;1886)")</script>, achieved fame as a surgeon in Birmingham; his younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33317/', "Arthur Gamgee (1841&#150;1909)")</script>, was an eminent biochemist; and his nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36486/', "D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson (1860&#150;1948)")</script>, was the celebrated scholar and naturalist. His father had built up a flourishing veterinary practice in Florence and was able to provide the best education for his children. After private tuition and schools in Florence, John and his elder brother were sent to Switzerland and Germany to complete their education and to become fluent in French and German as well as Italian.<br>
<br>In 1849 John Gamgee was entered for medical school in Italy when he heard that his brother Sampson, as he now chose to call himself, who had qualified as a veterinary surgeon, was about to enter University College, London, to train as a medical surgeon. Thereupon Gamgee changed his plans and decided to become a veterinary surgeon. He qualified from the Royal Veterinary College, London, in 1852, and then spent two years touring the continental veterinary schools and making a study of contagious diseases. On his return to London in 1854 he gave a series of extramural lectures and at some time after that was in practice for a brief period in Thirsk, Yorkshire. In 1856 he went to Edinburgh as an assistant to William Dick, who had founded the veterinary school there in 1823. Dick was sixty-three years of age and set in his ways. He was well regarded for his practical, clinical acumen but he was in no sense a scientist. By comparison Gamgee was aged twenty-five, a determined, cultured, well-travelled man who had firm ideas about the need for science in the training of veterinary students. They were incompatible and the appointment lasted for only one year.<br>
<br>Within a few months of his arriving in Edinburgh, Gamgee married, on 5 December 1856, Adeline (<i>b</i>. 1830/31), an actress and the daughter of Thomas Hartley, lieutenant in the Royal Welch Fusiliers, and his wife, Belinda Payne. Following his marriage Gamgee began to establish himself in the cultural and scientific life of the city. On leaving Dick's college he decided to set up a veterinary school of his own. He had no funds, but his enthusiasm to promote a scientific veterinary training won him influential support and he opened the Edinburgh New Veterinary College on 4 November 1857 in Drummond Street. William Dick was outraged and was further antagonized when he heard that Gamgee had applied for his school to be recognized by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. The college was the governing body of the profession and was nominally responsible for the examinations of the students of the London and Edinburgh schools. Dick had spurned that arrangement and although he himself wanted nothing to do with the governing body he was determined that the Gamgee school should not be recognized. It took Gamgee two attempts before the New Veterinary College was granted the royal sign manual on 31 March 1859.<br>
<br>Gamgee had a passionate interest in matters of public health and contagious disease. In 1862 he was appointed by the privy council to conduct an inquiry on cattle diseases. He urged the government to reform the cattle trade and to create an effective system of veterinary inspection. Looking for professional support he convened the first international veterinary congress, which was held at Hanover in July 1863. By now he was convinced that the uncontrolled importation of cattle would lead to disaster, and in two prophetic letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span> in November 1863 he warned that if cattle were imported from a Baltic port then Britain could expect rinderpest, a highly contagious, virulent disease of cattle. Eighteen months later the great cattle plague of 1865 broke out in the London dairies; it had been imported from the Baltic port of Revel. The plague was not recognized as rinderpest until Gamgee came down to London on 29 July, one month after the outbreak had started. The government had no effective statutory powers to control it and the royal commission that was set up in October failed to provide a solution. It was the <span class="roman">Cattle Diseases Prevention Act</span> of February 1866 that led to the eventual control of the epidemic by means that were essentially those advocated by Gamgee.<br>
<br>At the time of the cattle plague Gamgee was transferring his school to London, where it was known as the Albert Veterinary College. Unfortunately it failed in 1868, probably owing to Gamgee's not giving it the attention it required&#151;in that year he was in the United States investigating Texas fever. On his return to Britain he severed his connections with veterinary science and turned to thermodynamics. His interest in refrigeration led to his building ice-skating rinks in London and Southport and, for seven years from 1878, to consultancy work in the United States on the cooling of mines and offices and the building of refrigerator ships. Another of his projects was the &#145;zeromotor&#146;, a device for powering the ships of the United States navy from the thermal energy in sea water. It aroused much interest and even President Garfield inspected a model of it, but it was bound to fail because it violated the second law of thermodynamics, which Gamgee never could accept. The rest of his life was spent in promoting the zeromotor, which brought him nothing but disappointment and financial anxiety. He died at his home, 13 Springfield Road, Wimbledon, Surrey, on 19 December 1894, from heart failure, and was buried in Wimbledon cemetery. He was survived by his wife; there were no children.<br>
<br>Gamgee's erratic change of career was a great loss to the veterinary profession. He had made a distinguished contribution as an author of several books and numerous articles. He had founded the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Veterinary Review</span>, which set a new standard for a scientific periodical and foreshadowed the duty of a state veterinary service by publishing national disease statistics. Had he persisted he would surely have reached the pinnacle of his profession.<br>
