<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thompson, Sir  Benjamin</span>, Count Rumford in the nobility of the Holy Roman empire  (1753&#150;1814), <span class="occ">natural philosopher and philanthropist</span>, was born on 26 March 1753 at North Woburn, Massachusetts, the only son of Benjamin Thompson (<i>d</i>. 1754) and his wife, Ruth Simonds, daughter of an officer who had fought against the French and the North American Indians in the Seven Years' War. He was descended from James Thompson, who had gone to Massachusetts with John Winthrop in 1630. Thompson's mother married again when he was three, and reared a large family; a small legacy for Benjamin's maintenance came from his grandfather, who died in 1755. He went to school at Woburn, at Byfield, and then at Medford; he is said to have been especially interested in mathematics, and enthusiastic about mechanical contrivances.<h2>
<a name="Apprenticeshipsandabriefmarriage"></a>Apprenticeships and a brief marriage</h2>After leaving school at thirteen Thompson was apprenticed at the seaport of Salem, about 20 miles from home, to John Appleton, a storekeeper selling imported dry goods. However, in 1769 merchants in New England signed a non-importation agreement in protest against taxes levied upon them by the British government and this so damaged Appleton's business that he could no longer support Thompson. Briefly unemployed, the latter wrote memoirs on wind, light, and heat before, on 11 October 1769, Hopestill Capen of Boston wrote to Appleton for a reference, and duly offered Thompson a similar job. Soon, however, Capen was writing to Thompson's mother that &#145;he oftener found her son <i>under</i> the counter with gimlets, knife and saw constructing some little machine or looking over some book of science, than <i>behind</i> it arranging the cloths or waiting upon customers&#146;  (Brown, <span class="italic">Count Rumford</span>, 3); the story is told that Thompson lost this job in 1770 after an explosion when he was making fireworks to mark the repeal of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span>.<br>
<br>Less than a year later Thompson was apprenticed to the physician in Woburn, Boston, Dr Hay, with a view to becoming a general practitioner. With a friend, Loammi Baldwin, he constructed an electrical machine&#151;electrotherapy was then becoming fashionable and Benjamin Franklin's dangerous experiment with a kite (which the boys repeated) had made electrical science exciting. Thompson attended some lectures at Harvard, but never matriculated, and wrote out a timetable of medical study for himself. He does not seem to have been a very systematic student and early in 1772 his apprenticeship was terminated.<br>
<br>Thompson had already done some schoolteaching, at Wilmington and at Bradford, Massachusetts, and was now invited to teach in Rumford (now Concord), New Hampshire. The clergyman responsible for the invitation was Timothy Walker, whose recently widowed daughter Sarah (1739&#150;1792) had been married to the local landowner, Colonel Benjamin Rolfe. She soon fell in love with the young schoolmaster, handsome, auburn-haired, and nearly 6 foot tall, and about November 1772 they were married. Their only child, Sarah, was born on 18 October 1774. Thompson settled down as a landowner, at the same time cultivating John Wentworth, the royal governor of New Hampshire, who was interested in natural philosophy and in agricultural improvement. In 1773 the governor made him a major in the second provincial regiment, to the fury of experienced junior officers hoping in vain for promotion. Among Thompson's many talents, the capacity to recommend himself to the mighty was prominent.<br>
<br>Thompson began experiments on gunpowder which were to be a long-term interest, but in December 1775 he was brought before the local committee of safety and accused of being hostile to American freedom&#151;he had made no secret of his support for the established order. The case was dismissed but faced with threats from a mob Thompson fled to Boston, leaving his wife behind; he never saw her again. In Woburn and in Boston he was involved in covert and then overt support for the royal government, like many other loyalists or tories among the colonists. In March 1776 the British army withdrew from Boston; Thompson sailed for England in the frigate bringing the news from General Thomas Gage to the secretary of state, Lord George Germain.<h2>
<a name="Militarylife"></a>Military life</h2>Once in Britain Thompson presented himself as an expert on America rather than as a refugee and became the main contact between American loyalists in England and the British government, as private secretary to Germain. In 1779 he was appointed secretary for Georgia, a barren honour under the circumstances, and in September 1780 to the more profitable office of under-secretary for the colonies. In 1779 his research on gunpowder led to a cruise with the Royal Navy, when he became interested in signalling and in ship design, and then in 1781 to his first publication in the Royal Society's <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> and his subsequent election as a fellow. Amid rumours of embezzlement and treason, and blamed for what he saw as Germain's incompetence, in the summer of 1781 Thompson raised a regiment, the King's American dragoons, sailing with them to Charles Town, and then to New York. In camp at Huntington, Long Island, he became infamous for pulling down a church for fortifications, and building baking-ovens from the gravestones. When peace was made in 1783 he returned to England, retiring from the army on half-pay. On 17 September he went abroad, crossing the channel with his horses on the same packet as Gibbon.<br>
<br>At Strasbourg Thompson attended a review in uniform, and procured an introduction to Duke Maximilian de Deux-Ponts (or Zweibr&uuml;cken), whose regiment had fought for the Americans; the duke gave him warm letters of introduction to his uncle, the Elector Karl Theodor of Bavaria, who was trying to modernize his country and promptly offered Thompson a position at court. Returning to England Thompson secured permission to enter foreign service, and a knighthood from George III on 23 February 1784. Back in Munich he applied scientific analysis to the problems of clothing and feeding the Bavarian army, in which he was given the rank of colonel. In order to provide cheaper and warmer uniforms he investigated the insulating properties of cloth, and this led him to the discovery of convection currents in gases and liquids: he then realized that fabric where air was trapped would be warmest.<br>
<br>On new year's day 1790 Thompson rounded up the many and troublesome beggars of Munich into workhouses, where they were to manufacture suitable cloth and where nourishing meals were provided and there were schoolteachers for the children. Feeding these workers and the soldiers led him into studies of nutrition, and also into the improvement of fireplaces and stoves, with fuel economy and freedom from smoke as the objectives. He introduced potatoes into the Bavarian diet; his recipes for thick soups became famous, and he also promoted the drinking of coffee as an alternative to alcohol. Faced with idle and ill-paid soldiers he set garrisons to work growing vegetables for their own use and for the workhouses, while around them the engineers practised building walls and fortifications. In Munich he constructed the English Garden (out of the elector's former deer park) for the recreation of the inhabitants.<br>
<br>His successes led to Thompson's appointment as minister of war, minister of police, major-general, chamberlain, and councillor of state, and in 1792 he was created Count Rumford. His stoves were the ancestor of the kitchen range, and he also invented a photometer, for comparing light intensities against a &#145;standard candle&#146;, and then an improved lamp for use in his institutions. With all these exertions his health broke down. He went to Italy for sixteen months, returning in 1793 to Munich amid public acclamation.<h2>
<a name="Improvingthestove"></a>Improving the stove</h2>In the course of his duties as inspector-general of artillery Rumford oversaw experiments on cannon-boring, and found that enormous quantities of heat were generated by friction in the process. Heat, in the newest theory associated with Antoine Lavoisier's chemistry, was a weightless fluid element: Rumford's experiments convinced him of the truth of the older theory, that heat was the motion of the particles composing matter. Taking up his studies on convection he turned to the question of why water freezes from the top downwards. He found in a series of ingenious experiments that instead of contracting steadily as it cools, water reaches maximum density at about 41 &deg;F. Investigating radiant heat he concluded that black is the best colour for stoves, or for clothes in warm climates.<br>
<br>In 1795, anxious to publish his work, Rumford obtained permission to go to London. There his private papers were taken in a daylight robbery which he attributed to political enemies, perhaps in search of information about Bavaria. He spent two happy years in Britain, advising on fireplaces and chimneys. His studies on convection currents enabled him to eliminate downdraughts by installing a narrow throat and a smokeshelf, notably at Lord Palmerston's house in Hanover Square. He was appalled at the waste of fuel indicated by the clouds of smoke which hung over London. In the spring of 1796 he visited Ireland with Lord Pelham, suggested improvements to hospitals and workhouses, and was much acclaimed. In 1796 he gave the Royal Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Boston &pound;1000 each, the interest to be used for a gold and a silver medal to be presented every second year for research into light and heat and their applications. He was to be awarded the first medals by the Royal Society in 1802, but the American prizes were not awarded until after his death, and a simplification of the conditions in 1829.<br>
<br>In August 1796 Rumford was urgently recalled to Munich, upon which French and Austrian armies were converging. Accompanied by his unsophisticated daughter, and travelling dangerously from Hamburg, he found himself commanding the Bavarian army. The elector withdrew to Mannheim, leaving Munich in the path of the opposing armies. Rumford persuaded the Austrians, who were first on the scene, to camp outside the city; he then urged the French that, since there were no Austrians within it, they should not attack the city. Confined with a garrison of 12,000 soldiers, and menaced by artillery, he patiently negotiated with the two generals until after two weeks the French withdrew following a defeat elsewhere, at which point the Austrians also retired. In a bloodless victory against the odds he had saved the city and Bavarian neutrality, and in the course of the siege he had invented a portable field stove and set up soup kitchens throughout the city. Rumford's cockiness and enormous prestige made him enemies who detested this foreign royal favourite, and in 1798 the elector sent him as ambassador to London.<h2>
<a name="LondonParisandfinalyears"></a>London, Paris, and final years</h2>To Rumford's chagrin, and to the detriment of relations with Bavaria, George III refused to receive one of his own subjects as the representative of a foreign power. Deprived of diplomatic status, and despite his loyalism in the 1770s, Rumford sought a post in America, giving $2000 for poor children in Rumford. President John Adams contemplated making him superintendent of the military academy being set up at West Point, and eventually did propose that he become inspector-general of artillery&#151;having been assured that Thompson would decline. In London Thompson now found a new opportunity to use his gifts for promoting science and invention; he was the prime mover in setting up the Royal Institution in Albemarle Street. This became a great centre for research and fashionable public lecturing in the sciences, providing the laboratory where Humphry Davy, Michael Faraday, John Tyndall, and others did their fundamental work.<br>
<br>This was not really what Rumford had anticipated, though Davy did preach and practice his gospel of applied science, promoting industrial revolution. Rumford represented to the upper classes &#145;the essence of scientific philanthropy&#146;  (Berman, 11) and the proposals for the institution were approved at a meeting at Sir Joseph Banks's house (where Rumford had improved the chimneys) on 7 March 1799. Its aim was to diffuse knowledge, and introduce useful inventions; Rumford hoped that manufacturers would exhibit new devices (notably stoves), and that there would be lectures, especially concerned with heating and cookery. A steam central-heating system, a handsome lecture theatre to his design (with a separate entrance to the gallery, for artisans), and a basement laboratory were installed in the Albemarle Street premises, and Rumford lived there for a time, and then in leafy Brompton. He became sufficient of a celebrity to be lampooned by Peter Pindar (John Wolcot):<blockquote>
<div>Now to a Yankey tunes the willing lyre:<br>
</div>
<div>Spite of th'ingratitude of <span class="smallcap">COOKS</span> and &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>Strikes to <span class="smallcap">COUNT</span> <span class="smallcap">RUMFORD'S</span> <i>tuneful</i> name the strings,<br>
</div>
<div>Who from his fav'rite little <span class="smallcap">RUMFORD</span> came,<br>
</div>
<div>To build on <i>smoke</i> his fortune and his fame.<br>
</div> (Pindar, 2)</blockquote>There are also Gillray cartoons, one of Rumford warming himself in front of his fireplace, and another in which he is administering laughing gas in a lecture. (Occupations in his later years included designing a carriage with wide wheels, and a special coffee-pot.)<br>
<br>Rumford's great success was in appointing Davy, but Rumford's high-handed and dogmatic ways provoked resistance so that when he returned to Bavaria to greet Duke Maximilian, now elector, he left London in September 1801 under something of a cloud. He returned via Paris, where he was f&ecirc;ted, and after packing up in London he left for France in May 1802, never to return. His wife had died on 19 January 1792, and in Paris Rumford had met and fallen in love with Lavoisier's wealthy widow, Marie Anne Paulze (1758&#150;1836). He took her to Bavaria, where he recommended the transformation of the academy into another Royal Institution. They were married in Paris on 24 October 1805, but the marriage was not successful; his wife was far more sociable than Rumford, and they separated on 30 June 1809. Rumford lived thereafter at Auteuil, near Paris, where his daughter joined him from 1811. He died there on 21 August 1814, and was buried in the local cemetery.<h2>
<a name="Rumfordsplaceinthehistoryofscience"></a>Rumford's place in the history of science</h2>Rumford bequeathed money for a chair of physics at Harvard University, and &pound;1000 and his apparatus to the Royal Institution. Like Davy's, Faraday's, and Tyndall's, Rumford's is a story of the social mobility which science could bring: the farm boy and shop assistant became the Massachusetts Yankee at the courts of Europe. He spoke well German, French, Spanish, and Italian; he played billiards, against himself, and enjoyed chess; he was a good draughtsman; indifferent to literature, sculpture, and painting he had a great taste for landscape gardening. His daughter, Countess Rumford, returned to America and died in 1852.<br>
<br>In his <i>&eacute;loge</i> at the Institut de France on 9 January 1815 Georges Cuvier emphasized the revolutions, warfare, and conflicting loyalties which had dominated Rumford's life, and was mildly embarrassed by his pursuit of honours and wealth. He stressed the value of Rumford's practical inventions, with their scientific basis. Later, to Tyndall lecturing at the Royal Institution in 1883, Rumford's researches on the nature of heat put him firmly in the tradition leading to James Joule, conservation of energy, and modern thermodynamics. To the Americans George Ellis, his first editor, and Sanborn Brown, whose edition is now the standard, Rumford's failure to take the right side at independence is perplexing; indeed, with his various loyalties went a certain capacity for opportunism and underhand dealings. Certainly nobody could have risen as he did, in a world of patronage, without great ambition, charm, and determination; he seems to have preferred humanity in the mass to actual people, and had few friends. Brown places his researches on heat in their context, where the implications Tyndall saw were not perceived by Rumford or his contemporaries, and where the diversity and utility of his discoveries, based on research rather than empiricism, were most impressive. He has an important place in the origins of applied science.<br>
