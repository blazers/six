<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ogdon,  John Andrew Howard</span>  (1937&#150;1989), <span class="occ">pianist and composer</span>, was born on 27 January 1937 in Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire, the youngest in the family of three sons and two daughters of Howard Ogdon, teacher, who wrote about music, and his wife, Dorothy Mutton, a former secretary, who also encouraged her children's musicianship by ensuring that they learned the piano from an early age. John began piano lessons when he was four years old. His gifts were such that at the age of eight he went to the Royal Manchester (later the Royal Northern) College of Music as a pupil of Iso Elinson. After attending Manchester grammar school, he returned in his mid-teens to the college, where he found a gifted group of contemporaries&#151;Alexander Goehr, Harrison Birtwistle, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Elgar Howarth&#151;who were later known as the &#145;Manchester School&#146;. Ogdon took piano with Elinson, Claude Biggs, and Gordon Green, and composition with Richard Hall.<br>
<br>Ogdon's superlative sight-reading gifts and his phenomenal musical memory enabled him to tackle the most difficult scores virtually at sight, but his technical mastery was allied to a deep intellectual grasp, which soon marked him out as a re-creative musician of extraordinary range and depth. When he was still a child, his father had suffered a schizophrenic breakdown; it may well have been that this experience chastened Ogdon's own development: musically he was prodigiously gifted, and physically he was (so described by Goehr) &#145;a big, clumsy, untidy, roly-poly boy&#146;. His character was shy and reserved, his speech quietly withdrawn; only at the piano, it seemed, did his personality publicly flower, when he was overwhelming.<br>
<br>As a student Ogdon entered the Belgian Queen Elisabeth competition in 1956 but was unsuccessful. On graduating soon afterwards (with distinction in every subject), he gave Brahms's D minor concerto, conducted by Sir John Barbirolli, which prompted his Hall&eacute; Orchestra d&eacute;but at the age of twenty. Postgraduate work with Denis Matthews in London and Egon Petri (a pupil of Ferruccio Busoni) in Basel led, in 1958, to his playing Busoni's vast piano concerto from memory, conducted by John Pritchard, in Liverpool. The Busoni performance was much praised and on 8 August 1959, at less than forty-eight hours' notice, Ogdon made his Promenade Concert d&eacute;but in Franz Liszt's E[flat] concerto, after coming second in the Liverpool international piano competition, and a month before his Wigmore Hall d&eacute;but in London.<br>
<br>In July 1960 Ogdon married Brenda Mary, daughter of John Gregory Lucas, civil servant; they had a son and a daughter. Ogdon and his wife made a notable two-piano team. In December, Ogdon began his record career with a Busoni&#150;Liszt album for EMI. Although he later recorded for other labels, his main recorded legacy is with EMI. In January 1961 he took first prize in the Liszt competition, and he achieved world fame as joint winner (with Vladimir Ashkenazy) of the first prize at the Tchaikovsky competition in Moscow in 1962.<br>
<br>One of the most sought-after artists of his day, Ogdon travelled widely, notably to the USA and Russia, where he was adored. Unlike other virtuosi, he championed new and unusual music, including concertos written for him by Alun Hoddinott (with whom he founded the Cardiff music festival in 1967), Robert Simpson, and Gerard Schurmann, alongside standard repertory. He also found time to compose, among other music, a piano concerto, a symphony, solo piano works, and two string quartets. His immense energy ensured a full engagement book, yet his chain-smoking and excessive drinking, his unkempt appearance, and a tendency to overwork meant that the strains thus placed upon him took their toll.<br>
<br>In 1973 Ogdon began to exhibit symptoms of an alarming personality change. This previously gentle man became prone to degenerative mental and physical violence, eventually attacking his wife with such ferocity that she was hospitalized: he attempted suicide on numerous occasions. His condition at first eluded diagnosis, his treatment ranging from drugs and electric shock to psychotherapy. Some of his earlier treatment was experimental; he seemed to suffer from paranoid schizophrenic psychosis. Ogdon spent eighteen months in the Royal Maudsley Hospital in London; by 1977 he had improved enough to take his first teaching post, at Indiana University in Bloomington, where he stayed until 1980. Under care, he resumed concert-giving, which he had never really abandoned: an American doctor who had observed him for a year concluded that he was not schizophrenic but manic depressive and prescribed lithium, claiming Ogdon was an obsessive genius living a vital inner life against which the &#145;real&#146; world could appear remote.<br>
<br>The treatment was a success and, although never &#145;cured&#146;, Ogdon was able gradually to resume his career. His history meant that his condition was watched constantly; his earlier instability led to his affairs being taken over by the court of protection. Symptomatic of a new confidence was his recital in 1988 of the legendary three-and-a-half-hour solo piano work <span class="italic">Opus clavicembalisticum</span> by Kaikhosru Sorabji, which he also recorded. Ogdon was a fellow of the Royal Manchester College of Music (1962) and the Royal Academy of Music (1974), and an honorary fellow of the Royal Northern College of Music (1986). He was also a recipient of the Harriet Cohen international award (1960). His publications included contributory chapters to <span class="italic">Franz Liszt: the Man and his Music</span> (ed. A. Walker, 1976) and <span class="italic">Keyboard Music</span> (ed. D. Matthews, 1972).<br>
<br>In late July 1989 Ogdon complained of feeling unwell. He saw a new doctor, who asked if he had been diagnosed as diabetic and who arranged for him to be examined by several specialists some days later. But his condition worsened, and his wife found him unconscious on the morning of 31 July, the day of his first specialist visit. Rushed to Charing Cross Hospital in London, he was found to be in a diabetic coma. He had, moreover, contracted bronchial pneumonia, from which he died in hospital early the following day, 1 August 1989.<br>
