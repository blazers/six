<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Waterhouse,  Edward</span>  (1619&#150;1670), <span class="occ">heraldic writer</span>, was born in Greenford, Middlesex, the son of Francis Waterhouse, fishmonger, of Greenford and London, and Bridget, daughter of Morgan Powell; Edward was a great-nephew of Sir Edward Waterhouse, chancellor of the exchequer in Ireland (1535&#150;91). Francis Waterhouse had at one time been chosen chamberlain of London, but his appointment had been stopped, according to his son, &#145;by one of those orders that then were in date, to exclude those whom that power termed disaffected&#146;  (Waterhouse, <span class="italic">A Short Narrative of the Late Dreadful Fire in London</span>, 1667, 186). The younger Waterhouse was admitted fellow commoner at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 30 June 1635 but appears not to have taken a degree  (Venn, <span class="italic">Alum. Cant.</span>, 1.4, col. 344), though in 1668 he gained the degree of LLD <i>per literas regias</i>. During the interregnum he lived in Oxford, &#145;for the sake of the public library&#146;, according to Wood  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>: <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 2.163). By 1660, however, he had returned to London, where he resided at Sion College; he was still dwelling there for at least part of the year by 5 February 1665, the date on which he signed the dedication to his work <span class="italic">The Gentleman's Monitor</span>. He also had a house at Mile End Green and an estate at Greenford. Waterhouse married Mary, daughter and heir of Robert and Magdalen Smith, alias Carrington. After her death, he married Elizabeth, daughter of Richard and Christiana Bateman of Hartington, Derbyshire, and London. He outlived his second wife, with whom he had two daughters, Elizabeth and Bridget, and a son, Edward, who also predeceased him about 1659. In later life he was persuaded by Archbishop Sheldon to take holy orders, being ordained by faculty on 7 April 1668. He continued to reside at Greenford and London, where he became a &#145;fantastical preacher&#146;  (ibid.). He died in London on 30 May 1670 and was buried on 2 June at Greenford.<br>
<br>Although never a member of the College of Arms, Waterhouse had heraldic and historical interests, which are reflected in many of his works, such as <span class="italic">A Discours and Defense of Arms and Armory</span> (1660). His earliest work was <span class="italic">An Humble Apologie for Learning and Learned Men</span> (1653), in which he provided a historical survey of the contribution of learned men to human affairs, stressing the role of knowledge and reason in the workings of statecraft and the defence of true religion. These books reveal him as strongly influenced by Neoplatonic thought&#151;God was a &#145;divine and architectonick artist&#146;  (<span class="italic">Humble Apologie</span>, 10)&#151;as well as by neo-Stoicism. In the same year his <span class="italic">Two Brief Meditations</span> provide a sign of his future religiosity, as does <span class="italic">A Modest Discourse of the Piety, Charity and Policy of Elder Times and Christians</span> (1655). The majority of his writings, however, pertained to the history and fortunes of great families. A firm supporter of social distinction, Waterhouse was fascinated by distinguished ancestry, and in particular by the mutability of fortunes. His remarks on the vicissitudes of rank and prosperity have sometimes been seen as insightful sociological analysis in the tradition of the Tudor writer Sir Thomas Smith and of the Restoration political economists such as William Davenant, John Graunt, and Gregory King. More recent commentators have been less kind, seeing his work mainly as the pessimistic outpouring of a middle-aged man, beset by grief for his second wife and fixated on the impending extinction of his own direct line after the death of his son. On the other hand, Wood's contemporary assessment of Waterhouse as a &#145;cock-brain'd man&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>: <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 2.164) of small ability seems unduly harsh. Contemporaries such as John Wilkins thought highly enough of Waterhouse to propose him in 1663 for fellowship of the Royal Society, in which body Waterhouse was mildly active until 1664, paying his subscription until 1666. In that year occurred the great fire, which occasioned his last outpouring on the subject of impermanence, <span class="italic">A Short Narrative of the Late Dreadful Fire in London</span> (1667). This work, which described the fire as a divine judgment on London, and a sign of the impermanence even of buildings, also placed the conflagration in the context of other fires through history. He dedicated it to his kinsman and friend Sir Edward Turnor (1617&#150;1676), then speaker of the House of Commons.<br>
<br>Waterhouse was credited by Dugdale, who was almost certainly mistaken, with whole authorship of <span class="italic">The Sphere of Gentry</span> (1661) by the herald-painter Sylvanus Morgan, a peculiar work to which he doubtless contributed some parts, including the history of his family and its arms  (Morgan, 2.67). He also wrote a life of his great-uncle and namesake, the Elizabethan official, for David Lloyd's <span class="italic">State Worthies</span> (1670, 537). But Waterhouse's two most significant works were without question <span class="italic">Fortescutus illustratus</span> (1663), a learned commentary on the fifteenth-century jurist Sir John Fortescue's <span class="italic">De laudibus legum Angliae</span> (a text most recently studied by the great Selden) and <span class="italic">The gentleman's monitor, or, A sober inspection into the virtues, vices and ordinary means of the rise and decay of men and families</span> (1665), on which his modern reputation as an acute social theorist largely rests. The former work was approved for publication by several leading jurists, including Sir Matthew Hale and Sir Orlando Bridgeman. The latter work, dedicated to Sheldon, offers an analysis of social mobility within the more conventional medium of a critique of vices such as prodigal spending and the irresponsibility of heirs in preserving their family's fortunes.<br>
