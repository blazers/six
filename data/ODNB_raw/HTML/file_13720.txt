<span class="headword">Hope, Sir  Henry</span>  (1787&#150;1863), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the eldest son of Captain Charles Hope RN, who died commissioner at Chatham on 10 September 1808, and his wife, Susan Anne (<i>d</i>. 1802), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24755/', "Admiral Herbert Sawyer")</script>. He was cousin of Sir William Johnstone Hope, and great-grandson of Charles Hope, first earl of Hopetoun. Hope entered the navy in 1800 on the <i>Kent</i>, commanded by his cousin, W. J. Hope. After serving off the Egyptian coast, he was moved into the <i>Swiftsure</i> with Captain Hallowell, and was made prisoner when she was captured on 24 June 1801. He afterwards served in the <i>Leda</i> on the Mediterranean and home stations, and in 1804 in the <i>Atlas</i>, again with his cousin, W. J. Hope.<br>
<br>On 3 May 1804 Hope was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Adamant</i>. In 1805, in the <i>Narcissus</i>, he was present at the capture of the Cape of Good Hope, and on 22 January 1806 was made commander and appointed to the sloop <i>Espoir</i> in the Mediterranean. On 24 May 1808 he was posted to the <i>Glatton</i>, and afterwards commanded the frigates <i>Leonidas</i>, <i>Topaze</i>, and <i>Salsette</i>, all in the Mediterranean, cruising successfully against French privateers. During the latter half of 1811, in the <i>Salsette</i>, he was senior officer in the Greek archipelago, and at the request of Stratford Canning, the ambassador at Constantinople, on 29 November, drove on shore at Nauplia a French privateer which had taken refuge under the guns of the Turkish batteries.<br>
<br>In May 1813 Hope was appointed to the <i>Endymion</i> (48 guns); this was one of the few British frigates carrying 24-pounders, and it was thought it might contend on somewhat equal terms with the large American frigates. After eighteen months on the North American station, on the morning of 15 January 1815, she was in company with a small squadron under Captain John Hayes off Sandy Hook, New Jersey, when they sighted the American frigate <i>President</i> (56 guns). The accident of position and her superior sailing enabled the <i>Endymion</i> to bring her to action, while the other British ships were some distance astern. It was already dusk, and it seemed possible that the <i>President</i> might escape in the dark. The <i>Endymion</i>, however, stuck closely to the fleeing enemy even though her own rigging was so cut that about nine o'clock she was obliged to drop astern to repair damages. By then the <i>President</i> had received such damage that, on the <i>Pomone</i> and <i>Tenedos</i> coming up an hour later, she at once surrendered. To claim that the <i>Endymion</i> took the <i>President</i> single-handedly is an absurd exaggeration. Although her consorts had a very small share in the action, their close proximity, especially that of the <i>Majestic</i>, a cut-down 74-gun ship, terribly hampered the <i>President</i>'s manoeuvres and, by compelling her to defend herself in a running fight, enabled the <i>Endymion</i> to take up a deadly position on her quarter. Otherwise the result might have been different: the <i>Endymion</i> was smaller, less heavily armed, with a weaker crew; and, gallant officer and fine seaman as Hope was, Commodore Stephen Decatur, who commanded the <i>President</i>, also had a high reputation in the United States Navy. Despite this the victory, the first by a British force over one of the American super-frigates, was very welcome in Britain. Hope was the popular hero of the episode. The Admiralty gave him the gold medal, and the war medal to the <i>Endymion</i> alone. The merchants of Bermuda presented Hope with a complimentary letter and a silver cup, and the officers with a second cup, &#145;to be considered as attached to that or any future ship which might bear the gallant name of <i>Endymion</i>&#146;. In June 1815 Hope was nominated a CB, but he had no further service.<br>
<br>Hope married, on 21 July 1828, his first cousin, Jane Sophia, youngest daughter of his mother's brother, Admiral Sir Herbert Sawyer KCB. There were no children, and she died in August 1829. Hope served as naval aide-de-camp to the sovereign from 1831 to 1841; he became rear-admiral in 1846, vice-admiral on 2 April 1853, KCB on 5 July 1855, and admiral on 20 January 1858. He died at Holly Hill, Southampton, on 23 September 1863. Hope left personal property valued at under &pound;70,000, of which he bequeathed nearly half to religious and charitable societies, including &pound;4000 each to the Church Missionary Society, the Bible Society, and the London City Mission.<br>
<br>The capture of the <i>President</i> was deemed an event worthy of celebration; the <i>Endymion</i> was rebuilt and remained in service until 1860, while a replica of the <i>President</i> was added to the navy list. Both ships were frequently sent to the North American station as talismans. Hope was also a talisman, although he had a large fortune, and chose not to go to sea again; his contemporaries believed he had won &#145;perpetual fame&#146;  (O'Byrne, 438).<br>
