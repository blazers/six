<span class="headword">Strauss,  Gustave Louis Maurice</span>  (<em>c.</em>1807&#150;1887), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born at Trois Rivi&egrave;res in Lower Canada. Although a British subject, he asserted that he had &#145;a strange mixture of Italian, French, German, and Sarmatian blood&#146; in his veins. In 1812 his father moved to Europe, and about 1816 settled at Linden, near Hanover. Gustave was educated at the Klosterschule in Magdeburg, at the University of Berlin (where he took the degree of doctor of philosophy), and at the Montpellier school of medicine.<br>
<br>In 1832 Strauss visited Great Britain in the company of Legros, a wealthy Marseillais, who wished to inspect the industrial establishments of the country. He returned to Germany in 1833 to share in the liberal demonstrations against the government. Afterwards he succeeded in escaping to France, although the Prussian government sequestrated his property, which was not returned to him until 1840.<br>
<br>In 1833 Strauss went to Algiers as assistant surgeon to the French army. At first he was attached to the Foreign Legion, but in 1834 his connection with it was severed. After some years' service his health broke down, and he returned to France, only to be banished in 1839 for supposed complicity in a revolutionary plot. He then went to London, where he turned his hand to a variety of callings, including those of chemist, politician, cook, journalist, tutor, playwright, surgeon, author, and linguist. At this time he produced a <span class="italic">German Reader</span> (1852), a <span class="italic">German Grammar</span> (1852), and a <span class="italic">French Grammar</span> (1853). He also published some works on Islam, including <span class="italic">Moslem and Frank</span> (1854) and <span class="italic">Mahometism: an Historical Sketch</span> (2nd edn, 1857). He was also the first editor of <span class="italic">The Grocer</span> (1862), a weekly trade circular. Strauss was well known in London as the Old Bohemian, and was one of the founders of the Savage Club in 1857.<br>
<br>In 1865 Strauss published <span class="italic">The Old Ledger: a Novel</span>, which was described by <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> as &#145;vulgar, profane, and indelicate&#146;. In consequence he brought an action against that journal, which was settled by mutual consent. <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, however, repeated the original criticism on 7 April 1866, and Strauss brought a second action. In this his plea for free literary expression was met by a demand for equal latitude in criticism; the jury returned a verdict in favour of <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>.<br>
<br>In later life Strauss's circumstances became straitened, and through Gladstone's intervention he received a bounty from the civil list. In 1879 he was admitted into the Charterhouse as a poor brother, but after a short residence he applied for an outdoor pension, which was granted by the governors. His memoir, <span class="italic">Reminiscences of an Old Bohemian</span> (1882), &#145;liberally mingled&#146; fact and fiction  (<span class="italic">Life and Adventures of George Augustus Sala</span>, 124); it was followed by the perhaps more aptly titled <span class="italic">Stories of an Old Bohemian</span> (1883). Strauss also contributed to a wide range of periodicals, including <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> and the <span class="italic">Morning Advertiser</span>. Strauss died unmarried, on 2 September 1887, at Teddington.<br>
