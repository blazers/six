<span class="headword">Strutt,  Edward</span>, first Baron Belper  (1801&#150;1880), <span class="occ">politician</span>, born at his parents' home at St Helen's House, Derby, on 26 October 1801, was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26687/', "William Strutt (1756&#150;1830)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26683/', "Strutt, Jedediah")</script>] and his wife, Barbara (1761&#150;1804), daughter of Thomas Evans, also of Derby. His grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26683/', "Jedediah Strutt")</script>, a cotton spinner and inventor. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1823 and proceeded MA in 1826. He was president of the Cambridge Union Society and, after graduating, settled in London in order to study law (he attended the lectures of John Austin). He never took an active part in the affairs of the family firm (W. G. and J. Strutt), of which he was a partner. On 10 May 1823 he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn, and on 13 June 1825 to the Inner Temple, but he was not called to the bar. He married on 28 March 1837 Amelia Harriet, youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20935/', "William Otter")</script>, bishop of Chichester. They had four sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Strutt shared his father's interest in science, but devoted his leisure, while a law student in London, mainly to a study of social and economic questions. He became close to Jeremy Bentham (a friend of his father) and to James and John Stuart Mill, and under their influence his political views took shape. Strutt was not a doctrinaire philosophical radical, but his Benthamism ensured that he later refused to join the Anti-Corn Law League, owing to its &#145;sectional interest&#146;. On 31 July 1830 he was returned as a liberal for the borough of Derby but his parliamentary impact as a radical was minimal, although he did become a privy councillor in 1845. He retained his seat until 1847, when his election, with that of his fellow member the Hon. Frederick Leveson-Gower, was declared void on petition on account of bribery practised by their agents  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 98, 402&#150;14). On 16 July 1851 he was returned for Arundel in Sussex. That seat he exchanged in July 1852 for Nottingham, which he represented until his elevation to the peerage. From 1846 to 1848 he was chief commissioner of railways; in 1850 he became high sheriff for Nottinghamshire; and in December 1852 he became chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster in Aberdeen's coalition government, but resigned in June 1854 in favour of Earl Granville.<br>
<br>On 29 August 1856 Strutt was created Baron Belper of Belper in Derbyshire, an early instance of a family being elevated to the peerage whose wealth had been made in industry. In 1862 he received the honorary degree of LLD from Cambridge University. In 1864 he was nominated lord lieutenant of Nottinghamshire, and in 1871 he succeeded George Grote as president of University College, London, an office he held until 1879. He was also chairman of quarter sessions for the county of Nottingham for many years, and was highly regarded in that capacity, particularly by the legal profession.<br>
<br>Belper became a recognized authority on questions of free trade, law reform, and education and earned the respect of many eminent contemporaries, including Macaulay, John Romilly, McCulloch, John and Charles Austen, George Grote, and Charles Buller. In his later life he also developed an interest in science and literature. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 22 March 1860, and to fellowships of the Geological Society and the Zoological Society. From 1879 to his death he was also a vice-president of the Sunday Society. He died on 30 June 1880 at his house, 75 Eaton Square, London. He was succeeded, as second Baron Belper, by his son Henry Strutt (1840&#150;1914).<br>
