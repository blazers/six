<span class="headword">Randall,  Joseph</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1789), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and agriculturist</span>, is of unknown origins. In 1740 he started a boarding-school for boys at Heath, near Wakefield, which he described in detail in <span class="italic">An Account of the Academy at Heath</span> (1750). His school could accommodate 130 boarders, with a further 30 or 40 pupils boarded out in the village. The staff of ten masters and assistants taught an extensive range of subjects that included English, Latin, and history, mathematics, geography, astronomy, and natural and experimental philosophy. Randall's particular interests are demonstrated in the textbooks that he published for his pupils, the first of which, <span class="italic">A System of Geography</span> (1744), contained a brief history of the Quakers in North America, which was published separately in several editions. In 1750 he published a course of lectures on geography, astronomy, chronology, and pneumatics, and he clearly taught the practical as well as theoretical aspects of these subjects, for the school possessed apparatus for scientific experiments, including an orrery.<br>
<br>By June 1763 Randall had given up the school and moved to York, where he advertised places for six private boarders for a basic fee of 15 guineas a year. Here he also professed to resolve all questions relating to annuities, leases, reversions, livings, and matters of intricate accounts, and he interested himself in practical agriculture. His main interest was in the system of seed-drill husbandry devised by Jethro Tull and the associated need to prepare a good, well-drained seedbed. He designed four implements for this work: a drill (seed-furrow plough), a spiky roller to pulverize the soil, a potato planter, and a draining plough. They were not especially original (Randall cited William Ellis as the inspiration for his spiky roller) and they were criticized as complicated and poorly constructed. From the brief published descriptions they do not seem to have been very effective. Randall's influence, rather, lay in his contribution to disseminating knowledge about the new drill husbandry. He did this principally in two publications, published in 1764. The first was dedicated to the Society of Arts and entitled <span class="italic">The semi-Virgilian husbandry, deduced from various experiments, or, An essay towards a new course of national farming</span>; the second was <span class="italic">Construction and extensive use of a new invented seed-furrow plough, of a draining plough, and of a potato-drill machine, with a theory of a common plough</span>. Though verbose and diffuse these works did play their part in spreading the news of drill husbandry. Randall also claimed: &#145;I do, and will continue to instruct young gentlemen &hellip; in the mechanical and geometrical principles of all the implements of husbandry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Museum Rusticum</span>, 440&#150;41). Here, again, was his contribution to the spread of new ideas. Randall died at York on 8 August 1789, &#145;aged upwards of 80&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 59/2).<br>
