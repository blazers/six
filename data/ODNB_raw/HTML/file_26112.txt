<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Spence,  Thomas</span>  (1750&#150;1814), <span class="occ">radical and bookseller</span>, was born on the Quayside of Newcastle upon Tyne on 21 June 1750. His father, Jeremiah Spence, had arrived in Newcastle from Aberdeen about 1739, while his mother, Margaret Flet, his father's second wife, came from the Orkneys. Jeremiah, who fathered nineteen children, was at first a net-maker and later sold hardware goods from a booth on the Sandhill. Always a poor but hard-working man, he was deeply religious and encouraged his children to read the <span class="roman">Bible</span> daily. Denied a formal education and forced to work even as a child, Thomas began to read widely, and gradually educated himself enough to advance from being a clerk to becoming a schoolmaster in Haydon Bridge and Newcastle. While at Haydon Bridge he married a Miss Elliott from Hexham in the early 1780s. Although the marriage was apparently not a happy one, a son, William, was born soon afterwards. This son later went to London with his father and there helped him to distribute his radical tracts; he died as a teenager about 1797. Within two years of the death of his first wife in 1792 Spence married a servant girl in London, but this marriage soon broke down irretrievably, though Spence appears to have paid this second wife, about whom further details are unknown, a small weekly allowance after they separated.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer1775c1788"></a>Early career, 1775&#150;c.1788</h2>Although in many ways a committed educator, Spence was more interested throughout his life in educating poor adults than children, and he was not a great success as a schoolteacher. Barely 5 feet tall, slightly built, very poorly dressed, and physically unimpressive (a situation made worse by a stroke or attack of palsy which left him with a limp and a speech impediment), he did not immediately command respect. Very enthusiastic in putting over his own point of view, he was not very good at listening to others, and he could be aggressive when faced with disagreement or opposition. Once convinced of the rightness of his opinions, he could be obstinate in their defence and unwilling to countenance any objections. He insisted on speaking his mind freely and fearlessly, a practice which was admired by some and deplored by others. Warm in his attachment to his friends, he could be abrasive and hostile to those not convinced of what he regarded as the obvious rationality, truth, and benefit of his ideas and schemes for reform. Quite early in his career as a teacher he developed ideas on the teaching of English by means of a phonetic alphabet. He published several works explaining the virtue of his new alphabet for both the uneducated poor and foreigners learning the English language. The most important of these was <span class="italic">The Grand Repository of the English Language</span>, published in 1775. Despite the cool reception which this work received, Spence continued to propagate his phonetic alphabet for the rest of his life. Several of his later radical works were printed in this alphabet as well as in standard English, and modern philologists now treat his efforts seriously.<br>
<br>Spence's parents' and his own lifelong experience of poverty taught him to sympathize with the plight of the industrious poor and to condemn the idle rich. Influenced also by his wide reading, especially of James Harrington, he developed notions about the natural rights and the natural equality of all men, and he had a strong belief in the power of reason and the idea of progress. There was undoubtedly a secular and enlightened aspect to his thinking as well as a millenarian and religious streak that he gained not only from his father but from the sermons and published works of the Revd James Murray, an extreme Presbyterian who made congregational autonomy an article of faith. Murray was a Scot, educated at the University of Edinburgh, who was invited to establish a meeting-house in Newcastle, where he was an active preacher and writer from 1765 until his death in 1782. Spence became one of Murray's greatest admirers, and was influenced by his use of scriptures and his appeal to reason in order to justify the claim that all men were naturally equal in the sight of God and had an equal claim to the same natural and inalienable rights. In his sermons and his published works Murray taught the benefits of civil and religious liberty, sympathized with John Wilkes's campaigns, and criticized the government's handling of the American crisis. He and Spence combined in the early 1770s in a prolonged and eventually successful campaign to preserve the customary rights of the Newcastle freemen threatened by the town corporation's efforts to make money by enclosing and engrossing parts of the large Town Moor.<br>
<br>The protracted Newcastle Town Moor affair had a profound effect on Spence and led him to develop his land plan, which was to be the focus of all his later radical political writings. In 1775 he became a member of Newcastle's newly established philosophical society. The society showed an interest in liberal ideas and occasionally debated political questions. On 8 November 1775 Spence created some dissension when he gave a lecture to the society on &#145;the real rights of man&#146;. This was the first public occasion on which Spence vehemently denounced the evils of private property and proposed that each parish should control the land within its boundaries for the benefit of every inhabitant of the parish. Although his lecture was not well received when it was delivered, Spence proceeded to publish it without the permission of the society and, worse still, to hawk it about the streets of Newcastle. Despite the protests of some members, especially James Murray, Spence was expelled from the society. This did not prevent him from repeating his views in <span class="italic">The Poor Man's Advocate</span> (1779) and in <span class="italic">A Supplement to the History of Robinson Crusoe</span> (1782), nor from engaging in violent disputes in the several informal clubs and debating societies springing up in Newcastle.<h2>
<a name="Londonradical"></a>London radical</h2>Increasingly isolated in Newcastle following the death of Murray and, in 1788, of his publisher, Thomas Saint, in an unhappy marriage, and discharged for reasons unknown from his teaching post at St Ann's School in Sandgate, Newcastle, on 17 December 1787, Spence and his son moved permanently to London. Although he is often reputed to have arrived in London in 1792, there is some evidence that he was settled there by early 1788, but that he was unknown as he eked out a living in a series of casual labouring jobs. By 1792 he had emerged as a radical bookseller and author just as popular radicalism was reviving in London because of the excitement generated by the French Revolution. The ideas behind and example of events in France increased Spence's attachment to reason, natural rights, and progress, but also reinforced the millennial streak in his writings. It seems likely that he mixed with the various millenarian, deistical, infidel, and apocalyptic groups then flourishing in parts of the capital. Moreover, although more of a political theorist and propagandist than an activist, Spence also associated with the more extreme political radicals. He allowed the 12th division of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42297/', "London Corresponding Society (LCS)")</script> to meet on his premises, while he was the first member of the 30th division, was elected to the general committee of the society, received subscriptions and collected signatures for petitions, and published the society's <span class="italic">Report of the Committee of the Constitution</span> in June 1794. He also signed the first <span class="italic">Address</span> of the Society of the Friends of the Liberty of the Press, allowed the militant and shadowy Lambeth Loyal Association to perform military drill in a large room above his bookshop, and in 1796 he acted in concert with Thomas Evans, the secretary of the LCS and also one of the leaders of the more revolutionary Society of United Englishmen.<br>
<br>From 1792 Spence endeavoured to maintain himself by printing and selling handbills, tracts, periodicals, and pamphlets (many of his own composition), by producing copper coins, tokens, and medallions, and by keeping a bookstall or bookshop. His first stall was at the eastern corner of Chancery Lane and Holborn, from where he also sold saloop (a hot drink of milk, sugar, and powdered sassafras). He later moved to a bookshop, the Hive of Liberty, at 8 Little Turnstile, Holborn, and by early 1797 he was based at 9 Oxford Street and also kept a stall near the Pantheon in Oxford Street. Many of Spence's publications were developments and variations on his land plan. His Newcastle lecture was republished as <span class="italic">The Real Rights of Man</span> in 1793 and as <span class="italic">The Meridian Sun of Liberty</span> in 1796. Variations on the same theme appeared in many other pamphlets, including <span class="italic">The End of Oppression</span> (1795), <span class="italic">Thomas Spence's Recantation of the End of Oppression</span> (1795), <span class="italic">A Letter from Ralph Hodge to his Cousin Thomas Bull</span> (1795), <span class="italic">Description of Spensonia</span> (1795), <span class="italic">Rights of Infants</span> (1797), <span class="italic">The Constitution of a Perfect Commonwealth</span> (1798) (republished in 1803 as <span class="italic">The Constitution of Spensonia</span>), and <span class="italic">The Restorer of Society to its Natural State</span> (1801). He also produced between 1793 and 1795 a periodical, <span class="italic">One Penny Worth of Pig's Meat: Lessons for the Swinish Multitude</span>, later reprinted in three volumes, which reproduced selections from such writers as Harrington, Philip Sydney, John Locke, Richard Price, Joseph Priestley, and William Godwin, as well as a further version of his own <span class="italic">The Real Rights of Man</span>. Although somewhat repetitious, all of Spence's works were written in a fresh, vigorous, and direct manner. While he was undoubtedly fixated with his land plan, his writings could be ironic and humorous, and they invariably had attractive titles. His style was deliberately tailored to reach, inspire, and convert poor men, who were his target readers.<h2>
<a name="Thelandplanandotherpoliticalideas"></a>The land plan and other political ideas</h2>Despite his emphasis on rational argument, his clear and vigorous prose, and his tireless efforts to publicize his land plan, Spence failed to make the details of it clear to his contemporaries or many later historians. Many believed that he advocated the nationalization of land so that it could be placed under the control of the central government, although administered by parish councils. In fact, Spence was always hostile to giving so much power to central government and wished to devolve as much power as possible to the local level. Convinced that political rights alone, however extensive, could never prevent the rich landowners from dominating the poor masses, he wanted to place what he regarded as the source of all power&#151;land&#151;into the hands of all citizens, men, women, and children alike. Spence insisted that all private property had been secured by force, fraud, or theft. Its return to the people as a whole was a simple act of justice. All the land should be owned by parish corporations composed of every person who lived within the parish boundaries. At first he suggested that this land would be rented out annually to applicants chosen by lot, but after 1782 he decided that the land should be rented out annually to the highest bidder, who would not be able to pass this leased land on to their heirs or to sell it. Rivers, lakes, mines, forests, and other natural resources would be rented out in a similar fashion. From the rents which it received, each parish corporation would make a contribution to the limited costs of the national government and its courts of justice, would use a proportion of its income for a wide variety of parochial needs, including houses, roads, harbours, and bridges, for such public amenities as a parish hall, school, library, and hospital, and for the care of the sick, aged, and unemployed. On occasion Spence suggested that the national government might maintain a small professional army, but more often he favoured a citizen militia supported by each parish. After all its expenses were met, the rest of the rent collected by the parishes would be divided, every three months, between every man, woman, and child in the parish. Dire poverty would be virtually eliminated, since no one paid taxes and everyone received a proportion of the parish rent. Although Spence planned to eliminate utter destitution, he did not advocate complete economic equality. While he was prepared to see the people confiscate the land and all natural resources from the rich, he was ready to see the latter retain all their movable property, and he accepted that some citizens would be more active, resourceful, and fortunate than others and so their income and personal possessions might well differ. Industry and talent would be rewarded, but land, the true source of political power, would always be communally owned, and the tyranny of the few over the many would be ended for ever. While Spence possessed an inadequate understanding of the social, economic, and demographic complexities of the day and he was far too optimistic about the practicality of his land plan, he did reveal a greater awareness than all his radical contemporaries of the true sources of political power and the desperate plight of the industrious poor. His vision of a welfare state was more extensive even than that outlined by Thomas Paine.<br>
<br>Aside from his land plan, Spence did not neglect other more overtly political questions. His writings were full of comments on constitutional and political arrangements. He clearly rejected monarchy, aristocracy, and an established state church, and he favoured a democratic republic. He favoured a limited and cheap national government, the complete separation of the executive, legislative, and administrative branches of government, and a system of election for all those in positions of authority. He favoured annual elections, the secret ballot, the abolition of any property qualification for, and the payment of, representatives, and universal suffrage. He was quite prepared to grant the vote to all women as well as all men, though he believed women should be excluded from positions of political responsibility because of what he termed the delicacy of their sex. Although he hoped to achieve his aims by reasoned argument and peaceful means if possible, and he did not personally engage directly in any revolutionary conspiracy, he did realize that the landed &eacute;lite would probably not tamely surrender their property. In <span class="italic">The End of Oppression</span> he suggested that a few thousand men, guided by a leadership of honest, firm, and intelligent officers, who would themselves be inspired by a noble cause (Spence's land plan), would relatively easily overcome the resistance of the landed &eacute;lite, when the mass of the people clearly supported this cause.<br>
<br>Spence's radical publications and his involvement in radical politics got him into a great deal of trouble with the authorities. He was arrested three times between December 1792 and December 1793, but was released each time without going to trial. He was again arrested on 20 May 1794, on suspicion of treasonable practices, and was kept in Newgate prison for seven months without trial, an injustice the authorities could perpetrate because habeas corpus had been suspended. He was arrested again in 1798 and released soon afterwards, but was arrested again and this time convicted for publishing <span class="italic">The Restorer of Society to its Natural State</span>. Accused of seditious practices and disaffection, he defended himself with great courage and impudence. None the less, he was sentenced to a year in Shrewsbury gaol, where he suffered severely. This punishment did not silence him, because on his release he published <span class="italic">The Important Trial of Thomas Spence</span> (1803), complete with a reprint of the offending pamphlet and a reworking of his land plan.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>Spence was not easily intimidated, and he kept his ideas alive and in limited circulation in the inhospitable political climate of the early nineteenth century. In 1805 he published <span class="italic">The World Turned Upside Down</span>, and this was followed by several political broadsides and volumes of political songs. He reissued some of his earlier pamphlets in 1807 and as late as 1814 he began a new periodical, <span class="italic">The Giant Killer, or, Anti-Landlord</span>. Only two issues of this appeared in August before he died of a bowel complaint in Castle Street, off Oxford Street, London, on 1 September 1814. During his last years Spence attracted to him a group of disciples, who met as a Free and Easy Club in local taverns to discuss his ideas and sing his songs. This group included Thomas Evans, Arthur Thistlewood, and Allen Davenport. About forty of his followers attended Spence's funeral procession to the burial-ground of St James's, Hampstead Road, London, on 8 September 1814.<br>
<br>Although his last years were spent in obscurity compared to the years between 1792 and 1803, Spence's death was noted in many leading newspapers and magazines. After his death his small group of disciples, known as the Spencean Philanthropists, kept alive his ideas and were involved in such revolutionary activity as the Spa Fields riots of 2 December 1816 and the Cato Street conspiracy of 23 February 1820. Supporters of Spence's land plan were active in the 1830s in both the National Union of the Working Classes and the Chartist movement. Later still, he was wrongly acclaimed as an early socialist and as an advocate of the nationalization of land by the state.<br>
