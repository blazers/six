<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Glyn, Sir  Richard</span>, first baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1711, <em>d.</em> 1773), <span class="occ">drysalter and banker</span>, was baptized on 13 June 1711 at the church of St Andrew, Holborn, London, the second son of Robert Glyn (1673&#150;1746), an oilman and drysalter of Hatton Garden, London, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Maynard. He was educated at Westminster School before joining his father in his business as a wholesaler of the salt and chemicals used as preservatives and dyestuffs. He took his freedom by patrimony in the Salters' Company on 31 May 1733, and assumed control of the business in the following month, continuing after his father's death with Thomas Baskerfield as his partner.<br>
<br>Glyn married on 8 June 1736 Susannah (<i>d</i>. 1751), the only child and heir of George Lewen of Ewell, Surrey, former MP for Wallingford, Berkshire, to whom he was distantly related. They had three sons, Robert (1737&#150;1743), George (1739&#150;1814), and Richard (<i>d</i>. 1741). Susannah died on 5 February 1751, and he married secondly, on 23 March 1754, Elizabeth, the daughter of Robert Carr of Hampton, Middlesex, a silk mercer of Ludgate in the City, and an important connection for Glyn's trade in dyestuffs. Their two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10839/', "Richard Carr Glyn (b. 1755)")</script> and Thomas Glyn (<i>b</i>. 1757), both followed him as bankers. By the time of his second marriage Glyn was rising to modest prominence in the City; he later bought a country seat at Gaunts House, near Wimborne, Dorset. He was master of the Salters' Company in 1751, alderman for Dowgate ward from 1750 to 1772, and sheriff jointly with Charles Asgill in 1752&#150;3. After delivering a loyal address to George II on his return from Hanover, he and Asgill were knighted in 1752. He was lord mayor in 1758.<br>
<br>This relationship with Asgill probably introduced Glyn to Joseph Vere, Asgill's banking partner. In December 1753 Vere and Glyn formed a partnership with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12017/', "Thomas Hallifax")</script>, chief clerk at Martin's Bank, and in January 1754 opened in Lombard Street, as Vere, Glyn, and Hallifax, bankers. Glyn provided &pound;10,000 of the total capital of &pound;24,000, and remained a partner, in what was to become one of London's most successful private banks, until his death in 1773. He had no previous banking experience, but was able to introduce custom from the many rich silk merchants trading nearby. By 1757 the bank had prospered sufficiently to move into larger premises in Birchin Lane. During its early years the bank was hardly troubled by bad debt. It was the extension of trading on borrowed capital, linked to the geographical expansion of business into the provincial silk districts of Coventry and Derby, and particularly its involvement with the Scottish iron-foundry of Carron, that brought Glyn and Hallifax (Vere having died in 1766) to the brink of disaster.<br>
<br>In 1754 Glyn unsuccessfully contested parliamentary elections for one of the four City of London seats, but in 1758 was elected as MP for the City of London, which he represented for ten years. A moderate tory, opposed to John Wilkes during the 1760s, in 1768 he was defeated in London and, after a controversial campaign, elected as MP for Coventry. He was created baronet on 25 September 1759. In addition he served as president of Bethlem and Bridewell hospitals (1755&#150;73); vice-president (1762&#150;4) and president (1764&#150;8) of the Equitable Life Assurance Society; colonel of the Orange regiment of the city militia (1762&#150;73); and treasurer (1763&#150;70) and vice-president (1770&#150;73) of the Honourable Artillery Company. He was fervently anti-French, being a prominent member of an Anti-Gallican Society, and was awarded an honorary degree by Oxford University in July 1759.<br>
<br>Glyn died on 1 January 1773 of a slow fever. However, since his death followed so quickly after a disastrous few weeks in the summer of 1772 when Glyn and Hallifax's bank stopped payment, his doctor was obliged to issue a public statement to scotch rumours of suicide. Sir Richard's second son by his first marriage, George Glyn, succeeded as second baronet.<br>
