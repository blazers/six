<span class="headword">Spence,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1782, <em>d.</em> 1860), <span class="occ">political economist and entomologist</span>, was baptized on 1 October 1782 at All Saints, Bishop Burton, Yorkshire, the son of Robert Spence, husbandman, and his wife, Anna. He received his early education in natural history from the Revd Robert Rigby, vicar of St Mary's, Beverley, who instructed him in the Linnaean classification of plants. After attending Beverley grammar school, Spence served as an apprentice to merchants and shipowners, Carlill, Greenwood &amp; Co. at Hull. This combination of a rural upbringing and a commercial apprenticeship influenced his development both as a political economist and as an entomologist.<br>
<br>A year after taking up residence in the Drypool district of Hull in 1806, Spence produced his <span class="italic">Radical Cause of the Present Distresses of the West-India Planters Pointed out</span> (1807) and his <span class="italic">Britain Independent of Commerce</span> (1807). An avowed follower of the physiocrats or &#145;French economists&#146;, he proclaimed that agriculture was the most important source of a nation's wealth. Extremely contentious, <span class="italic">Britain Independent of Commerce</span> passed through six editions and netted Spence a profit of &pound;230 by late 1808. As one of about three dozen books and pamphlets spawned in reaction to Spence's opinions, James Mill's <span class="italic">Commerce Defended</span> (1808) laid the intellectual underpinnings of classical political economy. Moreover, Mill identified Spence's purportedly wartime, nationalistic cant as a critique of capitalism and an <i>apologia</i> for the landed interests. Spence responded with his <span class="italic">Agriculture the Source of the Wealth of Britain</span> (1808).<br>
<br>Inspired by Thomas Marsham's <span class="italic">Entomologia Britannica</span> (1802), Spence took up the study of entomology in 1805 and in the same year became acquainted with the Revd William Kirby. In 1808 Spence and Kirby began work on a popular introduction to entomology. About this time, Spence married Elizabeth Blundell (1779/80&#150;1855). In 1811 he entered a commercial partnership with Elizabeth's brother Henry, founding Messrs Blundell, Spence &amp; Co., paint and colour makers and general merchants. Despite these commitments Spence's interest in agriculture continued&#151;he was elected to the Holderness Agricultural Society in December 1811. The paper that he presented at his first meeting appeared as <span class="italic">Observations on the Disease in Turnips, Termed in Holderness &#145;Fingers and Toes&#146;</span> the following year. He subsequently served as both a vice-president (1814) and president (1815) of the society; and he dedicated his <span class="italic">Objections Against the Corn Bill Refuted</span> (1815) to his fellow members.<br>
<br>Pursuing entomological research, Spence spent the summer of 1812 in London at the library of Sir Joseph Banks. Having been elected a member of the Linnean Society in 1806, Spence published his first entomological paper in the society's <span class="italic">Transactions</span> in 1815. The first volume of his and Kirby's <span class="italic">Introduction to Entomology</span> appeared in the same year; and, following the battle of Waterloo, he took a four-month tour on the continent. After the publication of volume two of the <span class="italic">Introduction</span> in 1817, work on projected further volumes was seriously curtailed by Spence's affliction with severe headaches. With special permission from the commandant, he sought solace through solitary strolls along the ramparts of the citadel at Hull. Continued ill health, however, forced him to submit his unfinished manuscripts to Kirby, and to remove himself and his family to Exmouth, Devon, about 1820.<br>
<br>With the publication of the final two volumes of the <span class="italic">Introduction</span> in 1826, Spence and his family left Devon for the continent, where they enjoyed a semi-peripatetic existence for the next eight years. Summers were generally spent in Geneva, Lausanne, and Bern, and winters were spent in Florence, Pisa, and Rome. Often drawing on his continental experiences, Spence continued to publish articles on natural history. In the early 1830s, for instance, the <span class="italic">Magazine of Natural History</span> published his meteorological observations for Switzerland and Italy. In 1834 he read his paper, &#145;Observations on a mode practised in Italy of excluding the common house-fly from apartments&#146;, before the Entomological Society of London.<br>
<br>Spence and family returned from the continent in 1833, in time for the official launch of the Entomological Society of London. With his two sons, William and Robert Henry, Spence attended the first sitting of the society in November 1833. At Kirby's behest, he was elected honorary English member, in recognition of his contribution to the <span class="italic">Introduction</span>. His election marked the beginning of a long association with the society. In addition to serving on the council (1844, 1850, 1852&#150;3), the publication committee (1844&#150;52), and the library committee (1847&#150;9), he was a vice-president (1844&#150;6, 1853), and president (1847&#150;8). On his death, his son, William, presented his library to the society.<br>
<br>After his return to England, Spence resided briefly at Bristol, and sought improved health through excursions to Leamington. Eventually he settled at 18 Lower Seymour Street, Marylebone, and took a fairly active role in London's scientific life. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1834, and subsequently served on both its council and that of the Linnean Society. He published approximately twenty articles on natural history, his principal interests lying in physiology, economic entomology, and instinct/intelligence disputes. Although admired by Charles Darwin, his liberal, secular interpretation of animal instinct and intelligence had led to his one open disagreement with Hutchinsonian Kirby.<br>
<br>In late 1842, a sixth edition of volumes one and two of the <span class="italic">Introduction</span> appeared. Because of Kirby's age and declining health, Spence had been solely responsible for the necessary revisions. <span class="italic">The Gardeners' Chronicle</span> acknowledged it &#145;as the most entertaining accounts of the habits of insects that has ever been put into popular form&#146;  (2, 3 Dec 1842, 808). Perhaps again exhausted, Spence and his wife returned to Italy for 1843. By this time, Spence's many sojourns to Italy had made their mark on his family. In 1833 one of his two daughters, Eliza, married Louis Schmid, the <i>charg&eacute; d'affaires</i> to the court of Tuscany; two years later, his son, William, married a Florentine woman.<br>
<br>Although the <span class="italic">Introduction to Entomology</span> continued to be popular, Spence's declining health precluded active participation in scientific circles. The death of his wife in April 1855 and the onset of deafness resulted in his increasing reclusiveness. Consequently, by the time of his death, at his home in Lower Seymour Street on 6 January 1860, contemporaries had confused the details of his intellectual career. Perhaps misled by his early work on political economy, a number of obituaries erroneously eulogized him as a former member of parliament for Hull. Spence was buried at Bishop Burton.<br>
