<span class="headword">Darling,  Julia Rose</span>  (1956&#150;2005), <span class="occ">poet, playwright, and novelist</span>, was born on 21 August 1956 at 8 College Street, Winchester, Hampshire, the eldest daughter and second of five children of John Ramsay Darling, a science teacher at Winchester College, and his wife, Patricia Rosemary (Vicky), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Vickers, a nurse and a Quaker. She was educated at Winchester County High School for Girls and St Christopher's School, Hertfordshire, from where she was expelled at the age of fifteen. She then did a cordon bleu cookery course before studying fine art at Falmouth School of Art. She grew up in the house where Jane Austen died and remembered its being constantly visited during her childhood. When she plastered anti-apartheid and &#145;women's right to choose&#146; posters on the windows of the house, the Jane Austen Society complained. She later drew on her early experiences for her first novel, <span class="italic">Crocodile Soup</span> (1998).<br>
<br>In 1980 Darling moved to the north-east. She never returned south, falling in love with Newcastle&#151;the bridges, the architecture, and the way people talked. (She was also particularly attached to the Isle of Wight, where she went every summer with her family.) She worked with community arts in Pennywell, and set up the Women's Intellectual Group (WIG). In the same period she created the political cabaret <span class="italic">Sugar and Spikes</span> with Ellen Phethean. She was always drawn to working collaboratively across a range of art forms: she worked with musicians, glass artists, and film makers. On 13 October 1984 she married Ivan Paul Spears, a 28-year-old trade union organizer later known as Ieuan Einion, and son of John Sears, furniture maker. After the birth of her two daughters, Scarlet (<i>b</i>. 1984) and Florence 
    (Florrie; <i>b</i>. 1986)
  , she started to write in earnest. Her first collection of poems, <span class="italic">Small Beauties</span> (1988), was published by Newcastle Libraries. Her group Poetry Virgins was formed to perform the poems in <span class="italic">Small Beauties</span>. She wrote a number of plays for the theatre (notably for Live Theatre, Quondam, and Northern Stage) and the radio. Her plays included <span class="italic">Doughnuts Like Fanny's</span> (2002), a comic play about the life of Fanny Cradock, <span class="italic">Attachments</span> (2002), and <span class="italic">Manifesto for a New City</span> (2004), a musical. She also wrote short fiction&#151;<span class="italic">Bloodlines</span> (1995) was a collection about different women coping with difficult lives. It was her publishers who encouraged her to embark on a novel. Like almost all of her writing, <span class="italic">Crocodile Soup</span> (1998) is the work of a comic spirit, a wholly unexpected tale of love, knowledge, and eccentricity, driven by endless invention. It brought Darling's work to a national readership and established her reputation.<br>
<br>In 1990 (her marriage having ended in divorce) Darling met her long-term partner, Beverley Anne (Bev) Robinson, and brought her daughters up with her; they made a welcoming home together in Heaton. The house was always teeming with friends, teenagers, neighbours, dogs, and cats. In 1995 Darling was first told that she had breast cancer. She dealt with cancer in an extraordinary way and passionately believed in living in the moment. She was the most uplifting and exhilarating of company.<br>
<br>Darling held a Royal Literary Fund fellowship at the University of Newcastle from 2000. Later, she became a fellow in creative writing and health there, enjoying the company of other writers enticed there by the innovative head of department, Linda Anderson: Jo Shapcott, Cynthia Fuller, Margaret Wilkinson, Linda France, Bill Herbert, Tom Shakespeare, Sean O'Brien, and Jackie Kay among others. She loved the sense of a writers' community. She belonged to many groups, yet still retained a strong sense of her own individuality. She was instrumental in establishing successfully Proud Words, the first gay and lesbian literary festival in England.<br>
<br>When her cancer returned Darling started writing poetry as a way of coping with the illness. She did an MA in creative writing at Newcastle University, specializing in poetry. Afterwards she produced two collections, edited by Jo Shapcott, <span class="italic">Sudden Collapses in Public Places</span> (2003) and <span class="italic">Apology for Absence</span> (2004), both inspired by her experiences. Having cancer made her work harder, as if she was attempting to cram it all in. In 2003, the year in which she won the prestigious Northern Rock Foundation writer's award, she published <span class="italic">The Taxi Driver's Daughter</span>, a witty novel about a family on the verge of collapse. Even when dealing with difficult subjects, her work exhibited both lightness of touch and humour. She believed that poetry should be a part of the life of every hospital; her last book was an anthology about illness, <span class="italic">Poetry Cure</span> (2005), compiled with Cynthia Fuller, which she hoped would be read by doctors and patients everywhere.<br>
<br>&#145;Dying is very surreal&#146;, Darling said. &#145;Death is such a palaver. Ho hum the nurses come&#146;  (personal knowledge). In her weblog, which appeared sporadically but was eagerly awaited, she wrote that there were positive things about dying&#151;one was that she was in no pain unless she tried to dance the hokey cokey, and another that you only had to &#145;do&#146; death once. The weblog was later dramatized on BBC Radio 4, produced by Sue Roberts, who produced many of Darling's radio plays, and acted by her close friend Charlie Hardwick. Darling took control of her own death. She chose her own funeral, burial plot, and gravestone. She said, &#145;You don't see many lesbian gravestones&#146;  (personal knowledge) and wanted to acknowledge her much loved partner and her daughters on hers. She managed to predict her own peaceful death in her poem <span class="italic">End</span>: she died at home on 13 April 2005 in the late afternoon, with the sun shining. She was survived by her partner, Bev, and her two daughters.<br>
