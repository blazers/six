<span class="headword">Townshend,  Charles Fox</span>  (1795&#150;1817), <span class="occ">founder of the Eton Society</span>, born at Balls Park, Hertfordshire, on 28 June 1795, was the eldest son of John Townshend (1757&#150;1833), member of parliament successively for Cambridge University, Westminster, and Knaresborough, and his wife, Georgiana Anne, daughter of William Poyntz of Midgham, Berkshire. George Townshend, second marquess, was his uncle, and John, the fourth marquess, was his younger brother. Charles James Fox was his godfather. Townshend was educated at Eton College (1807&#150;12) under John Keate.<br>
<br>In 1811 Townshend founded the Eton Society, which was both a debating society and a social club. Its members were originally known as the Literati, but afterwards the society was called &#145;Pop&#146;, from <i>popina</i>, &#145;eating-house&#146;, because its meetings were held in a room over the shop of Mrs Hatton, a confectioner. In 1846 this house was pulled down and the club removed to the Christopher, one of the inns of court. Keate approved the objects of the society, and the translation of <i>docti sumus</i>, &#145;I belong to the Literati&#146;, became one of his stock jokes  (Lyte, 403). The original number of members was twenty; it increased to thirty, but by 1816 had sunk to fourteen, and had it not been for the protest of the founder the society would probably have become extinct. Townshend's remonstrations had their effect, however, and the membership immediately recovered. He saw the society as more than merely a school club and in its early years Pop included many distinguished orators; some who had left the school continued to belong&#151;when W. E. Gladstone was a member in the 1820s a number of MPs were among the membership. Remarkable for having been run successfully by boys for more than a century, the Eton Society later assumed the character of a social oligarchy within the school rather than a debating society. Its founder proceeded to St John's College, Cambridge, and graduated MA in 1816. He died unmarried in Grosvenor Place, London, on 2 April 1817, while a candidate for the representation in parliament of Cambridge University. Townshend's early death, caused by consumption, was a severe blow to his father, who, encouraged by his son's achievements at Eton, had grandiose ambitions for his becoming leader of the whig party.<br>
