<span class="headword">Alexander,  Alexander <span class="st"> [Alick]</span></span>  (1849&#150;1928), <span class="occ">promoter of physical education</span>, was born in Liverpool on 14 May 1849, the second son of W. C. Alexander, a chief carpenter in the Royal Navy who had settled in Liverpool at the end of his period of service. Following an education at Liverpool College and the Liverpool Institute, he was apprenticed to the well-known gymnast John Hulley, the first director of the Liverpool Gymnasium. After completing his training he became a demonstrator of physical training there. The Liverpool Gymnasium at that time was one of the acknowledged centres of sporting life in Britain, attracting pupils from all over Britain, and from as far afield as America. Representatives of the local medical profession co-operated in directing the classes on a sound theoretical basis. The gymnasium was also made available to all the leading artistes who visited the city, and it was from these performers that Alexander acquired many of his skills. He became a highly skilled performer in all the branches of his art, a quality he possessed in common with that other great pioneer of gymnastics Per Henryk Ling. His speciality was what later became known as agility exercises; these were not in fashion in the gymnasiums at the time because they were not thought to be essential to general health. Alexander, on the other hand, maintained that they were useful because they developed such qualities as pluck, skill, endurance, and the art of co-ordinating mind and muscle. After the temporary closure of the gymnasium in 1870, Alexander travelled around Britain and Ireland giving demonstrations of his physical prowess and offering his services teaching fencing and gymnastics skills to public schools and military establishments. For a period his services were employed at various institutions in Ireland, including Trinity College, Dublin (1875). While in Ireland he met his eventual wife, Emily Adelaide, daughter of John and Mary Smith of Dublin.<br>
<br>In 1880 Alexander returned to his native Liverpool to take over directorship of the ailing Liverpool Gymnasium, which had been purchased by the philanthropist Samuel Smith and was run by the Young Men's Christian Association. With considerable energy and enthusiasm he taught classes in health and fitness, staged numerous public displays, and prepared teams to compete and exhibit their skills around Britain and occasionally abroad. He led a team visit to Stockholm in 1896 at the invitation of King Oscar of Sweden, and at the invitation of Quintin Hogg mounted a display to celebrate the opening of the gymnasium at Regent Street Polytechnic in London.<br>
<br>Alexander, who was Britain's answer to the renowned German strongman Eugen Sandow, achieved notoriety for feats of strength such as crushing an apple with one hand, bending pokers and bars of iron, and raising his entire body weight by means of one finger only, and by performing a variety of somersaults and tumbling tricks on the ground and on the rafters of the Liverpool Gymnasium. It was claimed that he could out-perform any of his contemporaries in these feats. Other regular stunts included placing an apple on the back of an assistant's neck and then slicing it in two with a single blow of a sword while his assistant remained unharmed. Notables impressed by these feats were often invited to feel his muscles. Accidents resulting from acquiring, rehearsing, and performing these tricks eventually took their toll, however, and are thought to have been responsible for his eventual blindness in later life.<br>
<br>Alexander championed what he termed a British system of physical training, and published at least sixteen books describing its methods. The system consisted of free movements and breathing exercises, military and musical drill, gymnastics, outdoor games, and swimming. He advocated that the system should be taught in elementary schools and gave evidence to the royal commission on teacher education in 1887. His ideas, which became popular at the time of the Edwardian movement for national efficiency, were later aired before the royal commission on physical training (Scotland) in 1902. With his wife, who was also a physical training instructor, he opened the physical training college for women at Southport in 1891 to produce teachers scientifically trained in its techniques; they jointly wrote <span class="italic">British Physical Education for Girls</span> (1910). In 1886 he helped to found the National Physical Recreation Society, of which Herbert Gladstone was president and Arthur Kinnaird the secretary, with the object of promoting physical recreation among the working classes. He also claimed to have invented bent handlebars for racing bicycles. Alexander (or Alick) Alexander died at his home, Innisfallen, 8 York Road, Birkdale, Southport, Lancashire, on 23 May 1928, and was buried on 29 May in Birkdale cemetery. He was survived by his wife.<br>
