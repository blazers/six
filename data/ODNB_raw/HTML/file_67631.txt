<span class="headword">Norton,  Frederic</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>George Frederick Norton]</span>  (1869&#150;1946), <span class="occ">singer and songwriter</span>, was born at 1 Sun Terrace, Great Cheetham Street, Broughton, Salford, Lancashire, on 11 October 1869, the son of George Norton, a cheese factor, and his wife, Ann Hunstone. He had at least one sister. Having worked originally as a clerk in insurance, he later became a professional singer, touring as an operatic chorister with the Carl Rosa Opera Company and making occasional appearances in the musical theatre. At the same time he wrote the music for a number of parlour songs, which he performed in recital with &#145;an agreeable voice and pleasing delivery&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Era</span>, 22 Nov 1902), and had the occasional number performed in West End musical comedies. In 1903 he was invited to Sandringham to entertain the king and queen with his songs at the piano (&#145;Mama's Baby Boy&#146;, &#145;The Camel and the Butterfly&#146;, &#145;Madcap Marjorie&#146;, &#145;Tatters and Tucks&#146;, &#145;Oh Mr Moon&#146;, &#145;Naughty Little Maid&#146;, and so on). In 1908 he was introduced by Mrs T. P. O'Connor to the artist and writer W. Graham Robertson, and the two composed the words and music to a musical fairy play, <span class="italic">Pinkie and the Fairies</span>, which, thanks to Robertson's high-theatrical connections, was produced as a Christmas entertainment at His Majesty's Theatre, with Ellen Terry and Mrs Patrick Campbell among its cast.<br>
<br>Norton later returned to His Majesty's Theatre to help Herbert Beerbohm Tree with his organization of Offenbach's score for <span class="italic">Orpheus in the Underground</span> (1912), but thereafter he worked as a singer in the Musketeers concert party and as an intermittent composer of songs for revue and music hall until he was once again recalled to work with Tree. This time the commission was a larger one, to provide the score for Oscar Asche's fairy-tale spectacular <span class="italic">Chu Chin Chow</span> (1916). <span class="italic">Chu Chin Chow</span> was a record-breaking wartime success in London, and went on to be seen in America and Australia and also on the cinema screen before returning for several revivals on the British stage and even as an ice show. Norton's score threw up the two most popular songs he had ever written&#151;the duet &#145;Any Time's Kissing Time&#146;, introduced by Courtice Pounds and Aileen d'Orme, and the baritone &#145;Cobbler's Song&#146;, which would remain a concert standard for more than half a century. It also included some rather more appreciable music from a composer whose usual produce was of the lightest kind, with such pieces as the lament &#145;I Long for the Sun&#146;, where the long phrased soprano lines seem to reach out in front of the singer. Norton made the most of his big hit, going on at various times in several of <span class="italic">Chu Chin Chow</span>'s principal parts, notably in Pounds's star role of Ali Baba.<br>
<br>Norton never wrote another piece of the scope of <span class="italic">Chu Chin Chow</span>. On the back of his hit he was hired to do the score for Lilie Elsie's pale and not very lingering comeback piece <span class="italic">Pamela</span> (1917), but thereafter he returned to the same kind of work he had always done, providing the occasional song for interpolation in scores by others and writing little tunes for such pieces as the amateur <span class="italic">The Willow Pattern Plate</span> or the children's Christmas show <span class="italic">Teddie Tail</span> (1920). <span class="italic">Chu Chin Chow</span>, however, ensured that his name appeared regularly on theatre bills right up to the end of his life. Norton never married. He died at his home, Hare Knap, Holford, near Bridgwater, Somerset, on 15 December 1946.<br>
