<span class="headword">Taylor, Sir  Robert</span>  (1714&#150;1788), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was the son of Robert Taylor (<i>d</i>. 1742), master mason and master of the London Masons' Company in 1733, who &#145;built himself a villa at Woodford in Essex and lived beyond his means&#146;  (Colvin, <span class="italic">Archs</span>., 962). Horace Walpole states that Taylor got nothing from his father, &#145;excepting some common schooling, a fee, when he went pupil to the sculptor Sir Henry Cheere, and just enough money to travel on a plan of frugal study in Rome&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anecdotes of Painting</span>, 5.192). The future Sir Robert was apprenticed in 1732 to Cheere, whose rococo style, especially in chimney-pieces, later greatly influenced his architecture. His father's death in 1742, the year he left for Rome, required his immediate return; he discovered that his father was bankrupt. This crisis undoubtedly persuaded Taylor to adopt a hard-working regime. His pupil George Byfield told the landscape painter and diarist Joseph Farington that &#145;Sir Robert Taylor had three rules for growing rich, viz: rising early, keeping appointments and regular accounts&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 4.841). Walpole comments that &#145;he never slept after four in the morning&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anecdotes of Painting</span>, 5.195).<h2>
<a name="Sculpturalcommissions"></a>Sculptural commissions</h2>Having been apprenticed to Henry Cheere, Taylor was working for him still in 1736&#150;7, when payments to him were recorded in Cheere's account at Hoare's Bank. He was admitted to the freedom of the Masons' Company by patrimony on 4 August 1744 and his emergence as an independent sculptor occurred in the same year, when, in competition with Roubiliac, Rysbrack, and others, he received the commission for the pediment relief on the newly built Mansion House. The choice of Taylor was made largely because of his City connections and the executed composition is certainly less accomplished in design than those proposed by Roubiliac and Rysbrack, as well as being carved with less finesse than works by his rivals. Later views of Taylor as a sculptor have, however, made too much of hostile remarks by contemporaries, and his later work shows him to have been an inventive artist whose designs were original and distinctive, even if their execution is often somewhat crude. His next major commission was that given by parliament for the monument to Captain Cornewall; this followed a Commons vote in 1747 after a debate in which the only figure to have emerged with any credit after the battle of Toulon was used as a focus for opposition to the government. Completed in 1755, the monument was then one of the largest in Westminster Abbey and was given a very prominent position at the west end, being moved in a truncated form to the cloisters only in the 1930s. Notwithstanding its later neglect, the monument attracted much comment as an &#145;illustrious instance of national gratitude&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 25, 1755, 90). With its rocky base, battle relief, and figures of Fame and Britannia flanking a palm tree, it recalled the French <i>pompes fun&egrave;bres</i> mentioned by P. A. Grosley, who thought that the &#145;pomp and magnificence displayed around it seem rather to suit a funeral decoration, than a standing monument&#146;  (Grosley, 2.67). Of all native-born sculptors until Wilton, Taylor showed the deepest familiarity with continental sculpture and his smaller monuments, such as that to General Guest (erected 1761) in the abbey&#151;praised by Vertue  (<span class="italic">Note Books</span>, 3.161) for its &#145;ornaments to the bust and beautyes of the Marble&#146;&#151;make intelligent use of the rococo motifs of Oppenord and Meissonier. (Given these French interests, perhaps the later bequest of his fortune to found an institute for the study of modern languages is not so surprising.) The French and Italian qualities of his sculpture are most evident in the book containing both his own designs&#151;some sketches as well as more finished drawings&#151;and drawings made in Rome after works by sculptors such as Pierre Legros the younger; this, along with his library, is housed in the Taylor Institution, Oxford. While Taylor was beaten by Peter Scheemakers in his bid to secure the commission for the Shelburne monument at High Wycombe in 1751, he successfully contended with the same rival sculptor for the unusual monument to Lord Somers at North Mimms, Hertfordshire. During the 1750s his workshop continued to produce modestly sized monuments such as those to Daniel Adey at Wotton under Edge, Gloucestershire, and Edward Manning in Kingston, Surrey; many of them are recognizable from their distinctive decorative features, recalling Taylor's chimney-piece designs.<h2>
<a name="Architecture"></a>Architecture</h2>It is uncertain when Taylor turned to architecture. He was wealthy enough to build himself a house at 66 Charing Cross after 1745. His first recorded architectural work is for interiors at 14 St James's Square (1748&#150;50) for Peter du Cane. By <i>c</i>.1750 he had designed 112 Bishopsgate Street for John Gore. In making the transition from sculptor to architect he must surely have made a study tour of the neo-Palladian architecture of Lord Burlington, William Kent, and Roger Morris. William Chambers later did the same when he established himself in London in 1755. As Taylor grew in stature, so does the pattern of his patronage become clear. His commissions came principally from the newly wealthy, principally bankers and directors of the East India Company, West Indian merchants and traders, lawyers and judges, and also soldiers and sailors who became wealthy through their exploits. In the course of his hard-earned career he was involved in a dozen public buildings, probably more than fifty country houses, and a very large number of town houses, in addition to groups or terraces of urban building.<h2>
<a name="Thevilla"></a>The villa</h2>Like Chambers, Taylor drew out of his Palladian observations ideas for the making of a Taylorian style applicable to the design of an evolving sequence of villas: Harleyford, Buckinghamshire (1755); Copfold Hall, Essex (1755); Barlaston Hall, Staffordshire (1756); Asgill House, Richmond (1761); Danson Hill, Kent (1762); Chute Lodge, Wiltshire (1768); Sharpham House, Devon (1770); Mount Clare, Surrey (1771); and Thorncroft, Surrey (1772). He clearly admired Roger Morris's astylar &#145;cubist&#146; villas of the 1730s, notably Combe Bank, Kent, Whitton House, Middlesex, and Westcombe House, Greenwich. Similarly, all Taylor's villas are astylar, without porticoes or orders. Volumetric movement is provided by the projection of canted or semicircular bays of varying height to the elevations. He favoured the use of rustication or vermiculation, as might a sculptor, to enliven the surrounds of windows and entrances, as at Chute Lodge, or the ground floor of Ely House, London, or later at the Guildhall, Salisbury (1788). His plans are compact, the rooms sometimes arranged around a stairwell, as in Campbell's Stourhead. In contrast to the neo-classical conformity outside and in of Chambers's villas, at first Taylor was influenced by his training under the arch-rococo Cheere, evident in the decorative trophies in the saloon at Harleyford, or the ornaments in the dining-room at Trewithen, Cornwall (1763). Among the few surviving designs by Taylor, those for chimney-pieces (Taylor Institution, Oxford) are in a rococo style commonly associated with Cheere as a sculptor. A parallel can be made with John Linnell the cabinet-maker, who was equally proficient in both the rococo and neo-classical styles.<br>
<br>By the 1770s Taylor had abandoned the rococo and was competing with Adam and Chambers. The ceilings of the octagonal saloon at Chute (1768), or the hall at Purbrook, Hampshire (1770), could be mistaken for something by Chambers. There can be little doubt that Taylor admired Chambers's Gower House, Whitehall (1765). As a colleague of Chambers, Taylor would have examined his works with care. Indeed, at Danson almost identical rooms by Taylor and Chambers (<i>c</i>.1770) are located cheek by jowl. Purbrook is a departure from the cubist villa model and reverts to the compact Palladian (tower) house theme of Morris's Combe Bank. However, the hall may claim to be the first columnar Roman atrium in domestic planning. Here Taylor has discovered his true m&eacute;tier based on his revived ideas of ancient Roman architecture, using the ornamental vocabulary of Palladio's fourth book of the <span class="italic">Quattro libri</span>. This is a result of the challenge to design new apartments for the Bank of England from 1765. In 1777 at Gorhambury, Hertfordshire, the hall was based upon the Pantheon via the Bank Stock Room, and its fa&ccedil;ade with a noble hexastyle Corinthian portico is Roman in spirit. If Taylor departed from the villa or enlarged villa norm at Gorhambury, so did he at the same time at Heveningham Hall, Suffolk, in an unusual palace or palazzo style that has been likened to a piece of urban architecture prefiguring John Nash's Regent's Park Terraces, and owing something to Chambers's Strand front of Somerset House.<h2>
<a name="Thetownhouse"></a>The town house</h2>Urban, not the least speculative, building in London was Taylor's principal source of wealth. He was involved in more than forty houses, and probably many more, including eighteen in John Street and Theobalds Road (1759&#150;61) and fourteen in Grafton Street (1768&#150;75). He eschewed the use of orders, preferring plain brick fa&ccedil;ades, as did Chambers. An exception was the stone fa&ccedil;ade of the astylar Ely House, Dover Street (1772), &#145;a masterpiece of street architecture &hellip; a narrow front that shall at once be self-contained and yet part of the street's elevation&#146;  (Hussey, 26). The interiors of his town houses cannot be dissociated from those in the country. His early rococo trade marks are octagonal glazing, rococo plasterwork and chimney panels, serpentine inset panels to doors, and chinoiserie fret balustrades to stairs. Busts on brackets or set in roundels owe much to the d&eacute;cor of James Paine, who was likewise a child of the rococo, and one whom Taylor regarded with respect. Always the staircases are spatially ingenious, influenced by those by Paine and Chambers. By the mid- to later 1760s, the period of the bank designs, Taylor was drawing on the ornament of ancient Rome, but would also have been aware that that was the case with Burlington and Kent. He favoured cross-vaulted passages and corridors. The walls of the ballrooms of 4 Grafton Street (<i>c</i>.1768) and The Oaks, Epsom (<i>c</i>.1770), have a columnar articulation based on an arched recess motif and combined with circular bas-reliefs, a style that could be by no other than Taylor.<h2>
<a name="TheBankofEngland"></a>The Bank of England</h2>This was the great public work of Taylor's career, as was Somerset House for Chambers. Walpole wrote of the bank rooms, that when &#145;M. de Calonne saw them, he pronounced them, with no exception but St Paul's the first architecture in London&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anecdotes of Painting</span>, 5.194). This cannot be disputed. His first essay, the bank buildings of 1764, was outside the main older complex, on the site of the present Royal Exchange. To the <span class="italic">Civil Engineer and Architect's Journal</span> (vol. 10, 1847, 340) it was &#145;a masterpiece of street architecture, not surpassed by any in Europe&#146;. It has never received its proper modern due. The following year Taylor tackled the problem of enlarging the bank proper. He did this by creating two blocks of offices extending the accommodation to east and west, tying them altogether behind a noble elevation of porticoes and attached columns, in its total elevation looking like the later Heveningham, which it may well have influenced. The eastern block contained his Roman Rotunda, a mini-Pantheon enclosed on three sides by vaulted columnar bank or transfer offices, and entered by a noble oval vestibule. Within the west block was a Garden Court or West Quadrangle, with the Court Room on its north side and the reduced annuity office in the south-west corner. What is remarkable about the transfer offices and the reduced annuity office is their evolutionary method of top-lighting, which later provided Sir John Soane with inspiration when he, too, was appointed bank architect following Taylor's death. Were it not for the destruction of Taylor's bank halls, he would undoubtedly be judged with Chambers, Adam, and Wyatt as one of the outstanding English architects of the second half of the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>In the course of Taylor's career, appointments and honours flowed in. He had been appointed surveyor to the Bank of England in 1764; in March 1769 he joined the office of works, succeeding Chambers in the post of one of the two architects of the works; in 1777 he became a member of the board of works with the title of master carpenter; in 1780 he was promoted master mason and deputy surveyor, again to Chambers; in 1788 he became surveyor to Greenwich Hospital, and he was also surveyor to Lincoln's Inn and the Foundling Hospital. In all these appointments he was exceptionally conscientious, a fact that would have pleased Chambers. His architectural practice was notable as he was the first English architect to take pupils, as opposed to apprentices. Among the better-known of these were Charles Beazley, George Byfield, S. P. Cockerell, John Nash, and William Pilkington. In 1782, following his public service as a magistrate, first in Westminster, then the City, on his election as sheriff of London he was knighted. He died at his house at 34 Spring Gardens, Westminster, on 27 September 1788 and was buried with extravagant pomp in St Martin-in-the-Fields. He was survived by his wife, Lady Taylor (1722/3&#150;1803), about whom further details are unknown; she died on 27 December 1803.<br>
<br>The study of Taylor's works has been made more difficult by the almost total loss of the paper contents of his office. His will of 4 January 1788 is extraordinary for its tiresome length of more than sixty pages. His executors were long-suffering. Of his fortune said to be more than &pound;180,000, he left bequests totalling about &pound;85,000, including &pound;50,000 to his only son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27067/', "Michael Angelo Taylor")</script>, who in 1792 commissioned for private distribution a set of thirty-two aquatint plates by Thomas Malton of his father's principal works. The beautiful drawings for these are in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. He generously rewarded the pupils in his office with &pound;5000 each. Surprisingly, his most famous bequest, to the University of Oxford, &#145;for erecting a proper Edifice &hellip; for establishing a Foundation for the teaching &amp; improving the European Languages&#146; (the Taylor Institution) took the form of a codicil which he failed to sign  (TNA: PRO, DEL 9/9, fol. 13). After a long dispute with Taylor's son the university eventually accepted a settlement of &pound;65,000 in 1835. The Taylor Institution is by C. R. Cockerell, the son and pupil of S. P. Cockerell, who was himself a pupil of Sir Robert Taylor.<br>
