<span class="headword">Hog,  Thomas</span>  (1628&#150;1692), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born at Tain, Ross-shire. His parents are unknown, though his biographer describes them as &#145;honest &hellip; native Highlanders, somewhat above the vulgar rank&#146;  (Stevenson, 9). He was educated at Tain grammar school and Marischal College, Aberdeen, from where he graduated MA in 1650. He was licensed in 1654 and became chaplain to John Gordon, earl of Sutherland. On 24 October that year he was ordained minister of Kiltearn, a parish 6 miles from Dingwall, on the shore of the Cromarty Firth, and soon gained a reputation for his ministerial abilities. Some time after 12 April 1656 he married a sister of John Hay of Inshock and Park.<br>
<br>Hog sided with the more extreme protesters during the 1650s religious controversy with the resolutioners, and on refusing to disown the protestation, was deposed in 1661 by the synod of Ross. He was forced to leave his charge in 1662 and retired to Knockoudie in Auldearn, Nairnshire, at the invitation of his brother-in-law John Hay. In July 1668 he was delated by the bishop of Moray for preaching in his own house and keeping conventicles. For these offences he was imprisoned in Forres, but was eventually released on the intercession of the earl of Tweeddale, upon giving bail to appear when called on. Nevertheless, Hog continued to preach: in 1674 he was delated again for seditious practices, and in August 1675 letters of intercommuning were issued against him, forbidding all persons to harbour or help him in any way. He was arrested in January 1677, and the following month was committed to the Tolbooth of Edinburgh, from where he was taken to the Bass Rock.<br>
<br>Hog's health deteriorated while he was in prison and a petition was made to the privy council to have him released. Archbishop James Sharp refused this plea, and is said to have removed Hog instead to a worse dungeon on the Bass. In October 1677, owing to some influence asserted on his behalf, he was brought back to the Edinburgh Tolbooth, and shortly afterwards the privy council ordered his release, provided he confined himself to Kintyre. It is unclear whether he was in fact released, for he was on the Bass in July 1679, when he was freed with other ministers under caution of 10,000 merks.<br>
<br>Hog seems to have continued in his former ways, and in November 1683 he was charged before the Scottish privy council with keeping house conventicles. As he refused to answer the charge it was held that he had confessed, and he was fined. In January 1684 he was banished from Scotland and given one month to leave; however, the redoubtable minister refused to bind himself not to preach during that month, and was in consequence given forty-eight hours to pack his bags. He travelled first to Berwick and then to London, perhaps intending to join those Scots who planned to emigrate to Carolina. However, he arrived in the capital at an inopportune moment and was arrested on suspicion of complicity with the duke of Monmouth's plot. He was subsequently released and in November 1685 fled to the Netherlands, where he met the prince of Orange and preached in The Hague.<br>
<br>Hog was one of the ministers who, on the announcement of James VII's indulgence to presbyterians, returned to Scotland in 1688, though he does not seem to have preached at this time. He was a member of the Church of Scotland general assembly in 1690, and in 1691 was appointed domestic chaplain to King William, though by then he was too ill to take up the appointment. The same year saw him restored to the parish of Kiltearn, as he is said to have predicted thirty years before would be the case. He died on 4 January 1692 and at his own request was buried beneath the threshold of his church door, with this inscription over the remains: &#145;This stone shall bear witness against the parishioners of Kiltearn if they bring an ungodly minister here&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fasti Scot.</span>, 7.42). Memoirs of his life were published by Andrew Stevenson in 1756, and transcripts of his sermons survive  (NL Scot.). A memorial church in his name was erected in Evanton village, Ross-shire.<br>
