<span class="headword">&Oacute;l&aacute;f Sihtricson</span> <span class="st"> [&Oacute;l&aacute;fr Sigtryggsson, Amla&iacute;b C&uacute;ar&aacute;n]</span>  (<em>c.</em>926&#150;981), <span class="occ">king of Dublin and of Northumbria</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25543/', "Sihtric C&#225;ech (d. 927)")</script> and, although her name and origin is uncertain, one record claims that his mother was named Orgiue (perhaps Eadgifu) and that she was the daughter of the Anglo-Saxon king Edward the Elder. &Oacute;l&aacute;f's career at the height of the viking age would be, for a time, triumphant before ending ultimately in failure, but his legend grew after his death, reaching an apogee as the model for Havelok the Dane. His father, Sihtric, had ruled as king of Northumbria since 921, after a reign as king of Dublin; in January 926, the West Saxon king <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/833/', "&#198;thelstan")</script> gave to him his sister in marriage. After Sihtric's sudden death in 927, and the annexation of Northumbria by &AElig;thelstan, it is assumed that &Oacute;l&aacute;f, who may have been born at York, was removed from Britain to Ireland.<br>
<br>In 941 &Oacute;l&aacute;f was accepted as king by the Northumbrians, and he led a raid on Tamworth in 943, where he was victorious. Edmund, the Anglo-Saxon king who had ceded Northumbria to &Oacute;l&aacute;f's predecessor, did not allow this challenge to go unanswered. He besieged &Oacute;l&aacute;f, together with Archbishop Wulfstan of York, in Leicester; the pair were able to avoid capture when they fled the town under the cover of darkness. A desire to forestall attacks from the south, and to have his kingship recognized, may have played some small part in &Oacute;l&aacute;f's decision to convert to Christianity in that same year; his sponsor was Edmund. This period of cordial relations did not long endure, and in the following year Edmund invaded Northumbria. &Oacute;l&aacute;f and another noble named Ragnall Guthfrithson were driven from the province. &Oacute;l&aacute;f then retired to Ireland, and was made king of Dublin, in the place of a Blacair Guthfrithson. He promptly allied with a claimant to the Irish high-kingship named Congalach mac M&aacute;el Mithig of the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill dynasty of S&iacute;l n&Aacute;eda Sl&aacute;ine. In 945 they attacked an invading army that belonged to Congalach's rival, another U&iacute; N&eacute;ill prince named Ruaidr&iacute; ua Canann&aacute;in of Cen&eacute;l Conaill, in the territory of Conailli (Louth); &Oacute;l&aacute;f and Congalach were victorious. During the temporary lull in the hostilities in 946, and without regard for his newly declared beliefs, &Oacute;l&aacute;f raided churches in Meath and Westmeath as well as along the River Shannon, culminating with the sack of the great monastery of Clonmacnoise. This period of leisure came to an end in 947, when Ruaidr&iacute; ua Canann&aacute;in personally led an army against Congalach and &Oacute;l&aacute;f, in revenge for the defeat of his army two years earlier. In a battle fought at Slane, Congalach and &Oacute;l&aacute;f were routed, with an immense slaughter of the men of Dublin. The defeat may have encouraged &Oacute;l&aacute;f's rivals, for in 948 the Blacair whom he had forced to abdicate Dublin three years earlier was in control of Dublin. Blacair attacked Congalach, but was defeated with 1600 men killed or captured.<br>
<br>Events now turned in &Oacute;l&aacute;f's favour. During his absence from Northumbria a member of the Norse royal house, Erik Bloodaxe, had established himself in Northumbria in opposition to the West Saxons; Erik was forced to abdicate, temporarily as it transpired, and in 949 &Oacute;l&aacute;f was invited to return by the Northumbrians. This second reign was no less fraught than the first, for &Oacute;l&aacute;f had to face two invasions from powerful foes. The first, in 949, was led by M&aacute;el Coluim I, king of Scots, as far as the River Tees in what was a great victory for the Scots. The second invasion was in 951 and the attacking force was a coalition of the Scots, Anglo-Saxons, and Britons of Strathclyde; this time, however, &Oacute;l&aacute;f was victorious. The real threat came from rivals, and in 952 Erik Bloodaxe returned to Northumbria. &Oacute;l&aacute;f was deposed in favour of Erik, who reigned for two years until he was slain in Westmorland by a Maccus son of &Oacute;l&aacute;f, who could have been a son of &Oacute;l&aacute;f Sihtricson, or of his predecessor, &Oacute;l&aacute;f Guthfrithson, or of another &Oacute;l&aacute;f altogether.<br>
<br>&Oacute;l&aacute;f returned to Dublin, where he spent the rest of his career. There was a new order in Ireland, for his old foe Ruaidr&iacute; ua Canann&aacute;in had been slain in 950, and his ally Congalach was now the undisputed high-king. This alliance, however, was fated for an unhappy end, and by 956 Congalach's success as high-king had begun to alarm Leinster and Dublin. &Oacute;l&aacute;f plotted with the men of Leinster to lure Congalach to a spot known only as &#145;Tech Guigenn&#146; located somewhere near the River Liffey, where he was slain in the company of his retinue. After this &Oacute;l&aacute;f was determined not to become a subject of the powerful U&iacute; N&eacute;ill princes, so the next quarter century was devoted largely to conflict with the various branches of that dynasty, and there is also some evidence that suggests the expansion of his lordship into those lands. In 960 a dynast of Clann Cholm&aacute;in named Carlus son of Conn, a descendant of the early tenth-century high-king Flann Sinna was slain at Dublin. In 967 &Oacute;l&aacute;f and Cerball mac Lorc&aacute;in, a prince of Leinster, raided Brega, in revenge for which Domnall ua N&eacute;ill of Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain, Congalach's successor in the high-kingship, led an army to Dublin where he unsuccessfully besieged the fortress for several months. Domnall was a special threat to &Oacute;l&aacute;f because he, unlike his contemporaries among the Irish, relied on his fleet in his campaigns. In the face of this threat &Oacute;l&aacute;f resurrected his alliance with S&iacute;l n&Aacute;eda Sl&aacute;ine, this time with Congalach's son Domnall. In 970 &Oacute;l&aacute;f and Domnall attacked the high-king at Kilmona (Westmeath), where the allies won a celebrated victory. Although Domnall ua N&eacute;ill escaped with his life, several of his allies did not, including the kings of Ulaid and Airgialla, together with several other lesser princes. &Oacute;l&aacute;f also had an ally in Murchad mac Finn, king of Leinster, whose daughter Gormflaith he married; in 970 they plundered Kells, and defeated the southern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill at Ardmulchan, Meath.<br>
<br>&Oacute;l&aacute;f was not without concerns. In 964 he had been defeated by the men of Osraige at Innistiogue (Kilkenny). A new enemy appeared in 975 in the person of M&aacute;el Sechnaill II M&oacute;r of Clann Cholm&aacute;in, who was to succeed Domnall ua N&eacute;ill as high-king in 980, when he attacked Dublin and, although he could not breach the fortress, savaged the town's sacred grove known as Caill Tomair (&#145;Thor's Wood&#146;). A more worrisome attack had come in 962 when <a name="cosubject_25544"></a><span class="headword">Sihtric Cam</span> <span class="st"> [Sigtryggr Cam]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>962), <span class="occ">warrior</span>, raided Dublin's territory. Sihtric's ships landed to the north of Dublin and raided from the sea to U&iacute; Colg&aacute;in (near Lusk). &Oacute;l&aacute;f led a force against him, but in the ensuing fray he was struck by an arrow through the leg (perhaps the origin of his epithet, which means &#145;the Crooked&#146;). His injury notwithstanding, &Oacute;l&aacute;f drove Sihtric back to his ships and out of his territory.<br>
<br>These relatively minor mishaps made little impression on &Oacute;l&aacute;f, who apparently feared neither human nor divine foes. He already had offended an important element of Irish society&#151;the church&#151;with raids on religious houses in the neighbourhood of Dublin, such as attacks on Kildare in 964 and a second in 967, when Abbot Muiredach mac F&aacute;el&aacute;in was slain. After 975 he began to war on two fronts. In 976 a Dublin force captured Augaire mac Tuathal, king of Leinster. The following year &Oacute;l&aacute;f ordered the slaying of Muirchertach, the son of the high-king Domnall ua N&eacute;ill, and Congalach, the son of his former ally Domnall mac Congalach. Augaire's freedom must have been secured in the meantime, for in 978 he was defeated and slain by &Oacute;l&aacute;f at the battle of Belan (Kildare). Belan was a significant victory for &Oacute;l&aacute;f, for the list of the notable slain includes princes throughout the province, and was matched in 979 with the capture of the provincial king of Leinster, Domnall Cl&oacute;en, who remained in captivity until the following year. This was a personal vendetta, for Domnall had slain &Oacute;l&aacute;f's father-in-law, Murchad mac Finn, in 972, in circumstances of treachery.<br>
<br>By 980 &Oacute;l&aacute;f could be considered one of the most powerful princes in Ireland. By the standards of the day he was an old man, well past his half-century, and his sons began to play a more active role. The continuing rise to power of M&aacute;el Sechnaill was troubling and the decision was made to take the fight to him, with the Dublin troops to be led by &Oacute;l&aacute;f's son Ragnall. Also in that force were troops from the kingdom of the Isles, and the men of Leinster, whose presence was probably compelled by the holding of their king as hostage at Dublin. Battle was joined at the ceremonial site of Tara; neither side emerged unscathed, but it went the worse for the invaders. Ragnall and the law speaker of Dublin were both slain, alongside a multitude of others, including princes of Leinster. M&aacute;el Sechnaill followed the fleeing troops back to the fortress of Dublin. After a siege of three days the stronghold capitulated and agreed to terms. The price was steep. The lands of the southern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill dynasties were freed from the payment of tribute, all the Irish hostages (including Domnall Cl&oacute;en) were released in addition to the payment of 2000 head of cattle, jewels, and treasures. In the aftermath of this disaster &Oacute;l&aacute;f abdicated in favour of his son Gl&uacute;niairn, who was M&aacute;el Sechnaill's half-brother, and, seeking comfort in religion, he retired to the monastery of St Columba on Iona, where he died in 981.<br>
<br>A summary of political events needs to be complemented with recognition of &Oacute;l&aacute;f as a patron of commerce and the arts. Dublin thrived during his reign, and was becoming one of the main trading towns of north-western Europe. &Oacute;l&aacute;f's sobriquet <i>c&uacute;ar&aacute;n</i> (&#145;shoe&#146;) refers to the production of footwear at Dublin, evidence for which survives in the shoe pieces uncovered during excavations at Wood Quay. &Oacute;l&aacute;f is also the first viking leader in Ireland for whom there is an indication of a court culture. He was a patron of the Icelandic poet Thorgils Grouse-poet and the Irish poet Cin&aacute;ed ua hArtac&aacute;in, who composed verses on the legendary history of the Hill of Skreen. His love of poetry and song may have inspired the legend of &Oacute;l&aacute;f as a poet. William of Malmesbury claims that &Oacute;l&aacute;f was present at the battle of &#145;Brunanburh&#146; (fought in 937), when he disguised himself as an itinerant poet, or skald, in order to spy out the battle order of the English. Unfortunately for a good story, there is little indication that &Oacute;l&aacute;f was even present at that battle.<br>
<br>Equally important was the fame and longevity of &Oacute;l&aacute;f's dynasty. Although his family lost control of Dublin during the eleventh century, they ruled in the kingdom of the Isles for several centuries; in the seventeenth century the merchants of Dublin claimed to be his descendants. The names of two of &Oacute;l&aacute;f's wives have survived. One was D&uacute;nlaith, the daughter of the famous U&iacute; N&eacute;ill prince, Muirchertach of the Leather Cloaks; their son was the Gl&uacute;niairn who succeeded his father and reigned until his murder in 989. The other known wife of &Oacute;l&aacute;f was Gormflaith, daughter of Murchad mac Finn, the provincial king of Leinster; their son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25545/', "Sihtric (Sigtryggr &#211;l&#225;fsson)")</script>, who succeeded his half-brother Gl&uacute;niairn and died in 1042. Other sons of &Oacute;l&aacute;f included: Ragnall, who was slain at the battle of Tara in 980; Harald, who was slain at the battle of Glenn M&aacute;ma in 999; Dubgall, who was slain at the battle of Clontarf in 1014; and possibly another son named Sihtric who is claimed to have raided Kells in 970. &Oacute;l&aacute;f also had three daughters whose names have been preserved: Radnailt, who was the mother of Muirchertach ua Congalaich of S&iacute;l n&Aacute;eda Sl&aacute;ine; M&aacute;el Muire, who was the wife of M&aacute;el Sechnaill II M&oacute;r and died in 1021; and Gytha, who married first an Anglo-Saxon noble and then, after being widowed, married the Norwegian king Olaf Tryggvason.<br>
