<span class="headword">Butler,  James</span>, first earl of Ormond  (<em>c.</em>1305&#150;1338), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50020/', "Edmund Butler (d. 1321)")</script> and his wife, Joan, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9645/', "John fitz Thomas Fitzgerald (d. 1316)")</script>, who was created earl of Kildare in 1316. He married in 1328 Eleanor de Bohun (<i>d</i>. 1363), daughter of Humphrey (VII) de Bohun, earl of Hereford (<i>d</i>. 1322), and granddaughter of Edward I, an alliance that augmented the Butlers' English properties. James's name may reflect his father's devotion to Santiago de Compostela, for in 1320 Edmund, his wife, and son were released from a vow to visit the shrine of St James. James, who was in Ireland when Edmund died at London, was summoned to England and by February 1323 was a yeoman (<i>valettus</i>) in Edward II's household. In 1325 the king granted him his lands and marriage before he was of full age and the court speeded his return to Ireland where his lordships in Munster and Leinster were threatened by Irish raids. The first steps of his career were thus taken during the ascendancy of the Despensers, who established links with several leading Anglo-Irish families. Their fall in 1326 left Ireland unstable and the new rulers of England uncertain of the allegiance of the magnates. James Butler was drawn into regional feuds and was among those who received reprimands from England between December 1326 and June 1328. At that point, however, his father's close relations with Roger Mortimer (Edmund had been justiciar of Ireland during Mortimer's lieutenancy in 1317&#150;18 and they had negotiated a marriage alliance in 1321), and the search for stability in Ireland on the part of the Mortimer regime, worked to his advantage. At the Salisbury parliament in October 1328, where Mortimer became earl of March, James Butler was created earl of Ormond and given a life-grant of the liberty of Tipperary, which in the event his descendants were to hold until 1716. At the same time his marriage to Edward III's cousin drew him towards the apex of aristocratic society.<br>
<br>The new earl's career was often dominated by campaigns against the native Irish who threatened his lands in Tipperary and south Leinster. In 1329, for instance, he burnt the territory of the &Oacute; Nuall&aacute;in family in Carlow in revenge for the capture of his brother; and in 1336 he made a compact with the &Oacute; Ceinn&eacute;idigh family of north Tipperary, in which they agreed to provide rent and military service, while Ormond accepted arrangements for mutual compensation between the Irish and the English settlers. His role in Irish marcher society was compatible with a career on a wider stage and could indeed be used to advertise his indispensability. The fall of Mortimer in 1330, and the resumption of grants made under his influence, rendered Ormond's gains of 1328 vulnerable. Faced by the strong methods of the justiciar, Anthony Lucy, the earl crossed to England and spent part of 1332 at his town of Aylesbury, subjecting Edward III to petitions in which he stressed his military services in Ireland, his relationship to the royal house, and the antiquity of his family and its possession of the butlerage of Ireland since the time of King John. As well as protecting his threatened endowments, he obtained financial rewards. His relations with Edward were further advanced when he led a retinue of 318 men from Ireland to the Scottish campaign of 1335.<br>
<br>Ormond died on 16 or 18 February 1338 at Gowran, Kilkenny, before his intention to endow a Franciscan house at Carrick-on-Suir in Tipperary was carried through. The Kilkenny chronicler, Friar John Clyn, an admirer of the Butler family, lamented his death: he was &#145;a generous and amiable man, elegant and courteous; in the bloom of youth the flower withered&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annals of Ireland</span>, ed. Butler, 28). Ormond was buried with his father at Gowran. Inquisitions taken at his death show that, besides his Irish lordships, he had property in ten English counties, all held jointly with his wife, who by 1344 had married Sir Thomas Dagworth. The earl was succeeded by his surviving son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4186/', "James Butler")</script>, who was granted his lands in 1347 while still under age.<br>
