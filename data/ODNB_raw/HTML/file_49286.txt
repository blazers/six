<span class="headword">Legge, Sir  Thomas Morison</span>  (1863&#150;1932), <span class="occ">factory inspector</span>, was born on 6 January 1863 in Hong Kong, the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16354/', "Reverend James Legge (1815&#150;1897)")</script>, missionary and Chinese scholar, and his second wife, Hannah Mary Willetts, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Johnstone (1822&#150;1881). He was educated at Dollar Academy, Clackmannanshire, at the City of London School, and at Magdalen College School, Oxford, to which he transferred when his father became the first professor of Chinese at Oxford University in 1876. In youth he suffered prolonged ill health following an attack of typhoid fever. Legge entered Oxford University as a non-collegiate student in 1882, migrating to Trinity College in 1884, where he graduated with second-class honours in the natural sciences (physiology) in 1886. He received his medical training at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, and graduated MB BCh in 1890. He gained his DPH (Cambridge) in 1893, and MD (Oxford) in 1894. Legge then studied public health on the continent, investigating sanitary arrangements in several cities and publishing his findings in <span class="italic">Public Health in European Capitals</span> (1896). The favourable reception accorded this work helped secure his appointment as secretary to the royal commission on tuberculosis (1896&#150;8). Following publication of the commission's report he worked briefly under Arthur Newsholme who was then medical officer of health for Brighton. In 1898, at a time of mounting public concern about occupational ill health, he was appointed the first medical inspector of factories. His initial salary was &pound;600 p.a.<br>
<br>Legge's appointment to the factory inspectorate formed part of a shift in policy on industrial regulation, one aspect of which was the introduction of specialist inspectors. Before assuming his duties Legge had no particular knowledge of industrial disease, but he tackled his duties with great energy and soon became a leading expert in the field. His early work on lead poisoning established a reputation which grew to encompass most industrial diseases. A chief inspector of factories, D. R. Wilson, described him as &#145;not only the pioneer, but the greatest living authority on occupational disease&#146;. Legge's professional achievement was to promote awareness of industrial health within the Home Office, to advance medical understanding of a number of occupational diseases, and to help raise health standards in the workplace.<br>
<br>In 1902, at the annual meeting of the British Medical Association, Legge was honorary secretary of the section of industrial hygiene and diseases of occupation. Three years later he was vice-president of the same section. In the same year, 1905, he was Milroy lecturer at the Royal College of Physicians, taking as his subject industrial anthrax. Legge sat on official committees on compensation for industrial diseases (1906&#150;13) and anthrax (1913&#150;18). He travelled widely on official business and lectured frequently on industrial medicine at venues including Manchester University (1920&#150;32), King's College, London (1920&#150;24), and University College, London (1922&#150;9). In 1919 he undertook a lecture tour of North America. He was appointed CBE in 1918 and given a knighthood in 1925; in 1923 he was the Royal College of Physicians' Bissett-Hawkins medallist.<br>
<br>Shy to the point of appearing rude, Legge possessed firm convictions and a strong social conscience. His official career ended on a point of principle. In 1921 he represented the British government on the advisory hygiene commission of the International Labour Office at Geneva, helping to draft an international convention to ban the use of lead paint inside buildings. When the time came to implement its terms the British government issued regulations which fell far short of the agreement it had signed five years earlier. Legge resigned his post in protest on 29 November 1926, explaining his decision in a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> (1 December 1926). At the time of his retirement his salary was &pound;1200 p.a. From 1930 Legge was medical adviser to the social insurance section of the Trades Union Congress.<br>
<br>Legge wrote <span class="italic">Thirty Years' Experience of Industrial Maladies</span> (1929); his <span class="italic">Industrial Maladies</span> (ed. S. A. Henry, 1934) was published posthumously. He co-authored <span class="italic">Cattle Tuberculosis</span> (1898) with Harold Sessions, and <span class="italic">Lead Poisoning and Lead Absorption</span> (1912) with Sir Kenneth Goadby. His <span class="italic">Industrial Poisoning from Fumes, Gases and Poisons</span> (1913) was a translation of a work by J. Rambousek. Legge contributed many papers to edited books and journals. Between 1919 and 1932 he was honorary consulting editor of the <span class="italic">Journal of Industrial Hygiene</span>.<br>
<br>In youth Legge was an accomplished swimmer and skater. In adulthood his main recreational interest was stained glass, a subject on which he was an authority. An enthusiast for the arts in general, he was a keen water-colourist, especially of industrial subjects.<br>
<br>Legge married Norah Elizabeth Mack of West Grinstead, Sussex, in 1904. They had two sons and one daughter. He died suddenly at his home, Wintergreen, in Warlingham, Surrey, on 7 May 1932. He was buried at All Saints' parish church, Warlingham.<br>
