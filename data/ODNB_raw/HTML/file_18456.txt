<span class="headword">Mayo,  Henry</span>  (1733&#150;1793), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was probably born in Plymouth; nothing is known of his parentage. He moved to London in 1756, when he was admitted to the Independent academy at Mile End Road. Having preached for a short time at Philip Doddridge's former chapel at Castle Hill, Northampton, he became, on 30 November 1762, the pastor of the Independent congregation in Nightingale Lane, Wapping, where he remained until his death. He was awarded the degree of MA by King's College, Aberdeen, in 1764, and LLD by Marischal College in 1772. He was twice married, first in 1764 to Jane Marder (<i>d</i>. 1766), a member of a Dorset family and the widow of Mr Martin, a West India merchant; they had one daughter. Mayo married again on 17 June 1766 at St George-in-the-East, London; his second wife was Jane Belpur, who died in or before 1796. They had three daughters. In 1785 he was chosen tutor in oratory and elocution at the Homerton Academy on the death of Thomas Gibbons, a post he held until his death, when it was discontinued.<br>
<br>Mayo took a prominent, if controversial, part in the dissenters' attempts to alter the terms of subscription required by the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> between 1772 and 1779. The London dissenting ministers, under the leadership of Edward Pickard, were prepared to accept a declaration of belief in scriptures as an alternative to subscription to the doctrinal part of the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> required by the act. Mayo took the view that a government did not have the right to lay down religious tests as a condition for toleration and preferred a complete repeal of the penal laws against dissenters. He was in a minority of one, and so resigned as secretary of the committee charged with the application and became a vociferous critic of the campaign, suggesting that the ministers had been bought off with the promise of a partial relief acceptable to the administration. He was especially critical of the involvement of some of them in the administration of the <i>regium donum</i>, an annual grant to poor ministers and their widows, partly on the grounds of its secrecy but principally because he saw it as a means of ensuring that the ministers involved did the government's bidding. His anonymous accounts of these matters in the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> in 1774 and 1775 are important, if partisan.<br>
<br>Mayo was the editor of the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, in which Edward Dilly and James Boswell were partners, from about April 1775 until the ownership changed about June 1783, and used the position to give extended coverage to a radicalism that was not confined to dissenting politics. He was interested in literary matters and was closely involved with Edward and Charles Dilly, the radical booksellers in the Poultry, at whose dinners he was a frequent guest and for whom he seems to have acted in an editorial capacity. Boswell, who had disapproved of Mayo's alterations to his <span class="italic">Account of Corsica</span>, first met him in this context in 1768 and records a number of subsequent encounters, including several with Samuel Johnson, at one of which in 1773 the two had a heated argument on toleration which led Boswell to dub him Johnson's literary anvil.<br>
<br>Mayo appears to have been a dogged, no-nonsense character, intolerant of compromise or evasion but nevertheless sociable. Boswell records that he gave a dinner for his friends once a week and dined abroad the other days. Theologically he was an orthodox Calvinist: he wrote against John Gill on infant baptism in 1766 and published an abridgement of a work of John Owen in 1768. He died at his house in Wellclose Square, London, &#145;after a long and painful illness&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 379) on 4 April 1793, and was buried in Bunhill Fields.<br>
