<span class="headword">Cope,  Richard</span>  (1776&#150;1856), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was born near Craven Chapel, Regent Street, London, on 23 August 1776, the son of James Cope and his wife, Martha. Before he was twelve he began work as a clerk in the excise, and subsequently served in various establishments until he became a student at the theological college, Hoxton Academy, in March 1798. After remaining there for more than two years, he received an invitation from the Independent congregation at Launceston in Cornwall. He preached his first sermon there on 28 June 1800 and was ordained in the church on 21 October 1801. He married Anne Davies at St James's Church, Piccadilly, on 30 June 1801; they had five sons and two daughters. Cope remained in the post at Launceston until 1820, having concurrently kept a boarding-school with great success. In June 1819 he helped to form the Home Missionary Society with his colleague Ingram Cobbin.<br>
<br>From 1820 to 1822 Cope filled the post of tutor in the Irish Evangelical College, Manor Street, Dublin, and also preached in many towns in the north of Ireland on behalf of the Irish Evangelical and London Missionary societies. After this brief change of occupation, he returned to England as minister of Salem Chapel, Wakefield, where he served from 1822 to 1829; following some unspecified dispute, twenty-six members of that congregation followed him to Quebec Chapel, Wakefield, where he was minister from 1829 to 1836. He next became minister of New Street Independent Chapel at Penryn, in Cornwall, from April 1836 until his death. He died at Penryn on 26 October 1856, and was buried on 31 October.<br>
<br>The degree of MA was conferred upon Cope at Marischal College, Aberdeen, on 12 March 1819, and the degree of LLD in 1826. He was elected FSA on 13 February 1824. His <span class="italic">Autobiography and Select Remains</span> (1857) was edited by his son. Cope also published several sermons and other works including <span class="italic">Adventures of a Religious Tract</span> (1820) and <span class="italic">Entertaining Anecdotes</span> (1828).<br>
