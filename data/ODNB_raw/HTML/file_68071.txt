<span class="headword">King,  Anne</span> <span class="st"> [<em>married names </em>Anne Dutton; Anne Howe, Lady Howe]</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1621, <em>d.</em> 1684<span class="mult">x</span>1701), <span class="occ">poet and literary muse</span>, was the youngest of four surviving daughters, and probably the youngest of the twelve children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15568/', "John King (d. 1621)")</script>, from 1611 bishop of London, and his wife, Joan Freeman (<i>d</i>. in or after 1621). Clearly there was a considerable gap in age between her and her eldest brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15564/', "Henry King (1592&#150;1669)")</script>, but the source for the claim that she was only five weeks old at her father's death on 30 March 1621 is not evident, and the balance of probability points to an earlier birth date. She was a beneficiary of her father's will, made on 4 March 1621, at which date she had already been given her portion. Many details of her life are elusive, but there is no doubt that she was well educated, that she developed her talents in Henry King's literary circle, and that she was known to and appreciated by many of her more distinguished contemporaries.<br>
<br>Possibly as early as 1633 Henry addressed a poem &#145;To my sister Anne King who chid mee in verse for being angry&#146;, paying her the compliment that her<blockquote>
<div>Quill [was] so sage<br>
</div>
<div>It Passion tunes, and calmes a Tempest's rage<br>
</div>
</blockquote>and requesting that henceforward, if he were aroused to anger, she should reprove &#145;That froward Spleene in Poetry and Love&#146; and &#145;Rhime me back againe into my Witts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems of Henry King</span>, 166).<br>
<br>She was regarded as equally accomplished as an artist: the clergyman&#150;poet Jasper Mayne commended &#145;Mrs Anne King's Table-Book of Pictures&#146;  (BL, Harleian MS 6931). James Howell, then a frequenter of London literary circles, wrote from Westminster on 3 February 1637 [probably 1638] of an encounter with Anne. Impressed by the King brothers, he had discovered that &#145;the same Genius diffuseth itself also &hellip; among the sisters&#146;; &#145;an Epitaph and an Anagram of her own composure and writing&#146;  (Howell, 311&#150;2) captured his imagination, inspiring him to write verse &#145;For the admitting of Mistress Anne King to be the Tenth Muse&#146;. His favourable opinion lingered: in March 1643 he drew up a mock will, leaving his intellectual interests, as appropriate, to Edward Herbert, Lord Herbert of Cherbury, Sir Kenelm Digby, Archbishop James Ussher, and Lord George Digby, and &#145;my poetry, such as it is&#146; to Anne &#145;who I know is a great minion of the Muses&#146;  (ibid., 324).<br>
<br>As a single young woman Anne probably lived in the households of her siblings, particularly Henry and Dorothy, who married Sir Richard Hubert of Langley, Buckinghamshire. From 1643 Henry, deprived of his briefly held bishopric of Chichester and without a settled home, also lodged with family and friends. Ten years later he singled out Anne as the one &#145;from whome during my misfortunes since the losse of all I had at Chichester, I received speciall significacon of her love&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems and Psalms by Henry King</span>, cxii). Some time in 1647 Henry established an informal praying community, observing the liturgy of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, in the adjacent parish to Langley at Richings Park near Eton, Berkshire, the home of Lady Salter, widow of Sir William (or Walter) Salter and niece of Brian Duppa, bishop of Salisbury. Although about 1648 Anne married, as his second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75377/', "John Dutton (1594&#150;1657)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72340/', "Dutton family")</script>] of Sherborne, Gloucestershire, she remained or became a key member of the Richings &#145;college&#146;. At the time of their marriage, Dutton, a wealthy man with a reputation for learning, was in the middle of lengthy negotiation over his fines as a &#145;delinquent&#146;. Religious and scholarly inclination may have combined with family obligations and convenience to encourage Anne to linger at Richings and Langley. Henry King's 1653 will reveals that she was the family member best acquainted with his financial affairs; it was to her that he left the French <span class="roman">Bible</span> he had inherited from his friend John Donne. When the scholar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11914/', "John Hales")</script>, who served as chaplain to the &#145;college&#146;, left Richings in November 1655, only to die six months later, it was Anne who drew his picture for the benefit of the community. She &#145;did so&#146;, according to Izaak Walton, &#145;in black and white boeth &hellip; exilently well as [to the finenes] to the curiousnes &hellip; as well to the likenes&#146;. In verse written underneath Anne sought to counter any accusation of presumption, affirming that<blockquote>
<div>I did contend with greater zeale then Art,<br>
</div>
<div>This shadow of my phantie to impart.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>She hoped she might be excused, being a woman and &#145;working only from memory&#146;. Walton, who later gleaned several anecdotes from her about her friend Hales, found her &#145;a most generous and ingenious lady&#146;  (Butt, 271). The portrait does not survive.<br>
<br>John Dutton died on 14 January 1657 and was buried at Sherborne five weeks later. The monument Anne erected there celebrated the learning, prudence, and meekness of the man to whom she had been married for eight years. In 1658 she also lost her sister Dorothy Hubert. At some point thereafter she married, again as his second wife, Richard Grobham Howe (1621&#150;1703) of Great Wishford, Wiltshire, widower of Lucy St John (<i>d</i>. 1658). Howe, a longstanding but inactive MP, was knighted about 1665 and succeeded his father as second baronet about 1671. Lady Howe was left a picture by Sir Anthony Van Dyck in the will of her nephew Henry King in 1671, and a ring by Izaak Walton in his will written in 1683. The following year she belatedly erected a monument to Lady Hubert containing the final extant example of her verse. In a &#145;Choice peece of destruction&#146;, Death had aimed her &#145;Dart&#146; and &#145;Malice&#146; at an exceptionally witty and sweet woman; Anne, &#145;endeer'd in Blood and Heart / [had] felt the stroke and still weep's for ye smart&#146;  (Greer, 182). She herself died in or before 1701: Sir Richard's will of 19 December that year makes no mention of her.<br>
