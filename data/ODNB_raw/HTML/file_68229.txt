<span class="headword">Lloyd,  John</span> <span class="st"> [St John Lloyd]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1630&#150;1679), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born in Brecon, the son of Walter Lloyd. He was a brother of William Lloyd, archdeacon of south Wales, and is believed to be the brother of Mother Margaret Bruno Lloyd of Paris. On 16 October 1649 he entered the English College at Valladolid after studying humanities at Ghent and on 7 June 1653 was ordained a secular priest. On 17 April 1654, after the completion of his studies in philosophy and theology, he was sent to conduct missionary work in south Wales and served various Catholic communities on the Glamorgan&#150;Monmouthshire border. From this period he lived at the home of Walter James, a Roman Catholic from &#145;Treivor&#146; in St Maughan's parish, Monmouthshire, and was also associated with the Turberville family of Pen-llin in Glamorgan, the Carne family of Nash in the same county, and the Williams family of Llan-ffwyst, Monmouthshire.<br>
<br>With the persecution of Catholics as a result of the Popish Plot accusations Lloyd was arrested at the house of his patron, John Turberville of Pen-llin Castle, near Cowbridge, on 20 November 1678. He was imprisoned in Cardiff and brought before Judge Richard Bassett of Beaupre and charged with saying mass at Llandeilo Gresynni, Pen&#150;Rhos, and Treivor. He was then committed to gaol, possibly in the Black Tower of Cardiff Castle where, shortly afterwards, he was joined by the Jesuit Philip Evans. His persecutors had to wait several months before they found witnesses willing to testify against him or produce any evidence of his being a priest. The gaol calendar for May 1679 names Samuel Hancorne of Colwinston, Benjamin Browne of Cardiff, and Margaret and John Nicholls as those who came forward to testify against him, the witnesses in the original recognizances taken at Monk Nash on 7 April being excused from presenting evidence. It has been conjectured that &#145;a friend of Lloyd had paid their forfeits of &pound;20 each in the hope of saving the priest's life&#146;  (Lewis, 63). In May 1679 Lloyd and Evans were brought before the spring assizes in the shire hall in Cardiff and both were found guilty of high treason as seminary priests under the statute of 27 Eliz. I.<br>
<br>The execution of Lloyd and Evans was delayed until 22 July 1679, during which time both men were allowed out of prison, and it was believed that they would be reprieved. On 28 May the privy council had nevertheless issued an order to execute all condemned priests, though the two were not informed until 21 July. Consequently on 22 July the two priests were put in a cart and with their arms tied behind them were taken to the gallows field in Cardiff. When the two men arrived at their place of execution they knelt down, kissed the post, and cited a prayer from St Andrew: &#145;Welcome good Cross&#146;  (<span class="italic">Short Memorandums</span>, 5). Evans was the first to be executed and Lloyd shortly afterwards. During the proceedings he &#145;stood by with as much constancy and cheerfulness as any man could have&#146; and before his execution he addressed the crowd and briefly explained the reason why he was prepared to suffer for his religious beliefs: &#145;I believe in the Holy Catholick Church, and those three Virtues, Faith, Hope and Charity: I forgive all those that have offended me; and if I have offended any body I am heartily sorry for it, and ask them forgiveness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Short Memorandums</span>, 5&#150;6). After this speech he was, like Evans, hanged, disembowelled while still conscious, decapitated, and quartered.<br>
<br>The executions were to have a significant impact upon the Catholic community in south Wales and &#145;the total disruption of Catholic life that the persecution caused, was to inflict a grievous blow upon the Church from which it was to take nearly a century to recover&#146;  (Lewis, 62). Shortly after the executions <span class="italic">Short Memorandums</span>, about Evans and Lloyd, was published at London. On 25 October 1970 Pope Paul VI canonized Lloyd as one of the forty martyr saints of England and Wales.<br>
