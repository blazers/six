<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bishop,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1554&#150;1624), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic bishop</span>, was born at Brailes, Warwickshire, the eldest son of John Bishop (<i>c</i>.1509&#150;1601) and Helen Onsley (<i>d</i>. 1588). His family was armigerous and came originally from Yorkshire; they remained on the same estate at Brailes, faithful to Catholicism, until 1830. He was sent to Oxford at the age of sixteen, probably to Gloucester Hall or Lincoln College. He went down without taking a degree and is recorded next at the English seminary then at Rheims, which he left on 16 February 1579 for Rome, where he continued his studies at the English College. He was ordained in Rome in September 1581 and was then sent back to Rheims, and thence on the mission to England.<br>
<br>When Bishop landed at Rye with two other priests he was immediately captured. He was able to tell the officials at the port that he was a merchant, but when asked next what he traded in he had no answer ready and was arrested. As Godfrey Anstruther comments: &#145;he seems to have had something of the simplicity of the dove&#146;  (Anstruther, 1.38). He was committed to the Marshalsea and was condemned to death in 1583 on the false charge of plotting the death of the queen. He certainly came very close to death at this point, but the government wished to avoid too many martyrdoms, largely to improve its relations with France, and so Bishop and a number of other priests were, in 1585, loaded into a boat and dropped off on the coast of France. He went to Paris and enrolled as a student at the Sorbonne, where he eventually took the degree of doctor of divinity. Throughout his subsequent career his ideas were strongly influenced by mildly Gallican or &#145;Sorbonnist&#146; ideas, especially on matters of papal power, the independence of national churches, and the rights of the secular clergy. When the persecution in England abated somewhat he returned to resume his work there as a missionary priest, leaving Rheims on 15 May 1591.<br>
<br>Bishop gradually grew to prominence on the English mission among the secular clergy, who were at this time developing a hostility towards what they saw as the excessive influence of the Society of Jesus on their arrangements in England and on the wider politics of the mission, especially in terms of the relations of Catholics with the queen. In 1598 the pope was persuaded by the Jesuits to appoint George Blackwell, a secular priest, as archpriest or head of the mission in England. This immediately inflamed a section of the secular clergy and they deputed Bishop and Robert Charnock to go to Rome to appeal against this appointment. So began the archpriest or appellant controversy, which rumbled on for the rest of Elizabeth's reign. Bishop and Charnock arrived in Rome on 11 December 1598 and were almost immediately arrested at the behest of Robert Parsons, the leading English Jesuit, who saw them as factious and unrepresentative of Catholic opinion. They were put on trial, and Bishop was now banished again, this time by the pope from Rome, with the additional exclusion that he should not return to England. Bishop was as much affected by the pope's ban as he had been by the queen's, and after the papal position on the appellants had softened he was back in England, by 31 January 1603, when he headed a list of thirteen Catholic priests who made a profession of loyalty to the queen. This was in itself an action which was part of the archpriest controversy, in that it was intended to highlight the disloyalty of the Jesuits. Despite this declaration of obedience he was arrested in England again in 1603, shortly after the accession of James I, but was soon released.<br>
<br>Bishop seems to have worked largely as a missionary priest in his own area, the midlands. He was reported as being in Herefordshire in 1605, when he was staying at Trevil Park with a Francis Bishop, who was perhaps a kinsman, and in Oxfordshire in 1610. About this time a government spy described him as &#145;tall of stature, flaxen hair, broad-faced, somewhat pale, somewhat gross, an enemy of the Jesuits&#146;  (Anstruther, 1.38). It was during the reign of James I that Bishop wrote his five contributions to the polemical literature of the time, mainly in answer to the anti-Catholic writings of the protestants William Perkins and George Abbot. As a controversialist Bishop was thorough and disputatious, but hardly original or lively. Bishop was imprisoned for a third time in England in 1611, but refused to take the oath of allegiance, although his reason for doing so was not because he supported papal power in temporals (which in taking the oath he would have denied), but because he did not wish to alienate the pope from the secular clergy and thus strengthen the Jesuits. On his release from prison Bishop went again to Paris, where he became a member of Arras College, which was a new postgraduate society for the English secular clergy. Here his Sorbonnist tendencies were reinforced, and he continued to study and write.<br>
<br>The death of the last surviving Marian bishop, Thomas Goldwell, in 1585, who in any case had not exercised his office since the accession of Elizabeth I, had left the English Catholics without a bishop. The appointment of Blackwell as archpriest, against which Bishop had struggled so hard, had been an attempt to overcome the problem. But the obvious solution was to appoint a new English bishop. When the third archpriest died in 1621 this point was successfully raised in Rome and the pope, who now favoured the English seculars, chose William Bishop as the first post-Reformation bishop to the English. Few can have had such perfect revenge on their professional rivals as Bishop, for his appointment represented the final triumph of the anti-Jesuit appellants. Bishop took as his see Chalcedon, a Greek city <i>in partibus infidelium</i>. So started the tradition, later enshrined in English law, by which Catholic bishops avoided English sees in their titles. According to Peter Heylin the story was that the Jesuits persuaded James I to object to the pope's giving the new bishop an English title, and so it was through their jealous machinations that the curious foreign designation was adopted  (Heylin, 2.96&#150;7). In truth, however, it would have been needlessly provocative to have used an English diocese, and perhaps also geographically confusing, since Bishop's faculties extended to the whole country. The appointment, however, did not have the effect of reuniting the English Catholics, although this became clearer during the period of Bishop's successor.<br>
<br>Bishop was consecrated in Paris on 4 June 1623 and set out for England on 29 July, arriving at midnight on the coast of Kent after a three-day voyage. At nearly seventy years old he then walked 13 miles until he reached a Catholic safe house. His term in office was brief. He had time to appoint a chapter and to travel around administering the sacrament of episcopal confirmation, which the country had been deprived of for so long. He also entered into conflict with the Scots, over whom his jurisdiction was at first claimed to extend. But before he could begin a projected visitation of his flock he died, on 13 April 1624, at Bishop's Court, or Hall, Essex, the home of the courtier Sir Basil Brook. He may have been buried at St Pancras, Middlesex.<br>
