<span class="headword">Dickinson,  John</span>  (1782&#150;1869), <span class="occ">paper manufacturer and inventor</span>, was born on 29 March 1782 probably in London, the eldest of nine children of Captain Thomas Dickinson RN (1754&#150;1828) and his wife, Frances de Brissac (1760&#150;1854). John Dickinson's father was superintendent of transports in the ordnance service, Woolwich, with quarters at the Tower of London, a post in which he was preceded by his father, Captain John Dickinson RN (1723&#150;1783). The Dickinson family were from Northumberland and claimed a distant connection to the American politician John Dickinson (1732&#150;1808), whose family had emigrated in the mid-seventeenth century. John's mother was of French Huguenot descent, the daughter of a silk weaver of Spitalfields, London, with publishing and printing connections.<br>
<br>Dickinson was privately educated until 1797, when he was apprenticed to Thomas Harrison, a stationer of Leadenhall Street and Cornhill, London, on the recommendation of the king's printer Andrew Strahan. When he was admitted to the livery of the Stationers' Company in 1804 Dickinson was trading from an office at 2 Walbrook selling paper to such clients as the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, the publishers Longmans, and booksellers Hatchards. With the financial backing of Strahan by 1805 he had moved to 39 Ludgate Street and had taken on an apprentice.<br>
<br>Dickinson's first patent (no. 3030, 1807) was for a cannon cartridge paper that was &#145;non-smouldering and non-explosive&#146; and this was successfully used by the Board of Ordnance during the Napoleonic wars. A second patent followed soon after (no. 3056, 1807) for the &#145;mechanical cutting of paper reels&#146; to be used on a paper-making machine developed by Henry Fourdrinier and Bryan Donkin. Dickinson's most important patent for paper making (no. 3191, 1809) was for a cylinder-mould machine that <blockquote>comprised a hollow perforated brass cylinder covered with a fine wire mesh partly immersed in a vat of pulp in which it rotated, picking up fibres from a wet sheet which was taken off at the biggest point on a wet felt</blockquote>to form a continuous sheet. There was better strength, smoothness and quality because the fibres were &#145;arranged in a horizontal and parallel direction&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1809 Dickinson purchased his first mill at Apsley near Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire, with financial backing from George Longman (1776&#150;1822), a member of the publishing family and MP for Maidstone, with whom he formed the business partnership of Longman and Dickinson. Situated beside the River Gade, the Grand Junction Canal, the London&#150;Aylesbury road (and from 1837 the London and North Western Railway) the mill was well placed for allowing rags&#151;the raw material needed for paper&#151;to be brought in and for products to be distributed easily. The partnership also took a lease on 63 Old Bailey as a London headquarters and showroom. In September 1810 Dickinson married Ann (1789&#150;1874), daughter of Harry Grover, a banker, of The Bury, Hemel Hempstead, and his wife, Sibylla Ehret. With financial assistance from Grover, Dickinson purchased Nash Mill, south of Apsley, and settled at Nash House.<br>
<br>Dickinson's innovations and improvements included the introduction of a vacuum into the paper-making cylinder and extra rollers to squeeze water from the paper, resulting in better drainage and greater speed. He also devised a means of removing lumps and iron out of the &#145;stuff&#146; to produce a smooth, better quality sheet of paper, particularly suitable for book printing. Later he developed two-ply paper for copper-plate printing using two moulds on the same paper-making machine.<br>
<br>The company was successful and continued to expand. In 1818 Dickinson bought Batchworth Mill, Rickmansworth, where rags were processed to produce half-stuff. By 1824 Nash and Apsley mills used steam power to produce paper, the first paper mills in the country to do so. Special punch cards for use with Jacquard looms were produced at Home Park Mill, built in 1826. In 1830 Croxley Mill, Rickmansworth, was built by Dickinson and by 1837 he had built another half-stuff mill in Manchester to process waste from the cotton mills. Other developments Dickinson worked on were a security paper containing silk threads, pre-paid envelopes for use in the new postal system, and gummed envelopes. He patented many improvements until 1855.<br>
<br>Between 1825 and 1840 Dickinson took 22 Bedford Row as his London residence. Abbot's Hill, a house overlooking Nash Mills, was completed in 1836 to Dickinson's design and this became the family home. There he entertained scientific and literary friends, including leading publishers and distinguished authors. In March 1845 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. He voiced his opinions loudly and campaigned against the excise duty imposed on paper and against the coal taxes levied in London. He was not a churchgoer but was philanthropic and charitable and he subscribed to build a church, school, and other buildings.<br>
<br>The Dickinsons had seven children. Their eldest surviving son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7606/', "John Dickinson (1815&#150;1876)")</script>, did not join the business but the husbands of their two daughters became partners in the company: Frederick William Pratt Barlow (1815&#150;1883), who married Frances Elizabeth (Fanny) Dickinson (1814&#150;1881) in 1840; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33040/', "John Evans (1823&#150;1908)")</script>, who married Harriet Ann Dickinson (1823&#150;1858), his cousin, in 1850. Evans, who was son of John Dickinson's sister Anne and her husband Arthur Benoni Evans, became the driving force for technical development after John Dickinson retired from the business in 1859, at the age of seventy-six.<br>
<br>Dickinson went to live at 39 Upper Brook Street, London, where he continued to entertain literary and artistic friends. He died there on 11 January 1869 and was buried at Kensal Green on 18 January 1869. A very wealthy man, he had successfully taken paper making from a handcraft into an efficient manufacture. Described as energetic, hard-working, inventive, and practical, he could be severe. He left Abbot's Hill to his eldest surviving son, John, but a greater legacy was the firm of John Dickinson, which was incorporated as a limited company in 1886, and which in 2004 celebrated the bicentenary of Dickinson's establishment of the business.<br>
