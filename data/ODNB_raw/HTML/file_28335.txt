<span class="headword">Vivares,  Francis</span>  (1709&#150;1780), <span class="occ">landscape engraver</span>, was born on 11 July 1709 in St Jean-du-Bruel, north of Montpellier, the third son of Jean Vivares, who abjured his protestant faith to remain in France. At two years old Francis was sent to Geneva and then, aged eighteen, to London. According to George Vertue, who noted details of Vivares's career in 1741, his &#145;profession was originally a Taylor&#151;this he was brought up to did follow to mans estate, and in London was a Master Taylor faild&#151;or broke went away to Paris&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 6.195). In France Vivares studied drawing and etching; he then returned to London where in the 1730s he worked in the Marlborough Street studio of the Venetian painter Jacopo Amigoni. The Swiss engraver Joseph Wagner lived with Amigoni and published his paintings, and Vivares presumably assisted Wagner with some of the prints that he engraved between 1733 and 1738. In 1739 Wagner and Amigoni left for Venice where Wagner established a print shop and published one set of prints signed by Vivares.<br>
<br>In 1739 the Huguenot printseller James Regnier published a drawing book designed and engraved by Vivares. By this time Vivares had married Anne Charieux (<i>d</i>. 1744?), and in September 1739 their first child, Marie, was born. Their sons Jacques and Jean followed in 1742 and 1743 and in 1743 Vivares stood godfather to the son of his close friend John Rocque at the Huguenot church of Spring Gardens. In 1740 he had begun to work for Arthur Pond and Charles Knapton, who were publishing an influential series of prints of picturesque landscapes by Gaspar Poussin, Claude, and other seventeenth-century masters, copied from paintings in British collections. Vivares undertook twelve of their earliest prints for 3 guineas a plate. His next association was with the landscape painter and printseller Thomas Smith of Derby. Fifteen large prints by Vivares after paintings by Thomas Smith were published between 1743 and 1749. In 1745 Vertue, who spoke of the pair as joint &#145;undertakers&#146; (or publishers), noted &#145;4 Views done at Derby of Dunington Cliffe Anchor church Hopping Mill Ware &amp; Lym Park by Smith &amp; Vivares&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 6.201). It seems likely that this pioneering set of picturesque English scenes was literally &#145;done&#146; at Derby, for in September 1744 his son <a href="#cosubject_28336">Thomas Vivares [<i>see below</i>]</a> was baptized in that town. Francis was the only parent named and it is possible that Anne died in childbirth.<br>
<br>Francis Vivares took Peter Benazech as his apprentice in 1746, by which time he was probably back in London. He had married a woman named Elizabeth by spring 1748; their child David was baptized at St Anne's, Soho, in December. By March 1749, when he launched a subscription for his first solo publication, Vivares was established at the Golden Head in Porter Street, Leicester Fields. By 1752 he had a print shop in Newport Street, near Long Acre, and he remained in this house (subsequently numbered 13 Great Newport Street) until his death. Here he sold &#145;all sorts of Italian, French and Flemish Prints of the best Masters&#146; as well as prints by himself and his pupils. In 1755 he took a second apprentice, William Hebert and, on 31 January, a third wife, Susanna Parker (<i>d</i>. 1792). With her he had at least three children of whom the eldest, Elizabeth, proved to be a gifted artist. Vivares was elected a fellow of the Society of Artists but he only exhibited in 1766 and 1768. His children did extremely well in the competitions held by the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce, with Thomas, Mary, Francis junior, and Elizabeth all winning prizes for drawing or engraving. Theirs must have been a family business in the fullest sense. By the 1760s it was thriving. Vivares published drawing books, books of ornament, and swags and borders for use in print rooms, as well as his own landscape engravings. These were very highly esteemed and his prints were collected by contemporary connoisseurs (a two-volume <i>&#339;uvre</i> compiled by Viscount Fitzwilliam survives in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, for instance). He usually published a pair of major landscapes every year. Vivares was widely considered to be the best engraver of Claude, but he also interpreted a number of modern painters including George Smith of Chichester, Thomas Gainsborough, and the Venetian visitor Francesco Zuccarelli (a connection probably owed to Vivares's acquaintance with Wagner, Zuccarelli's publisher in Venice).<br>
<br>When the poet Thomas Gray visited the picturesque landscapes of northern England in 1769, he noted that &#145;at the alehouse where I dined, in Malham, Vivares the landscape painter, had lodged for a week or more&#146;. Vivares had published two prints after his own drawings of scenes around Malham in 1753, but it is possible that Gray was not mistaken about Vivares's occupation and that he painted landscapes as well. Nicholas Thomas Dall, who was the scene painter at Covent Garden Theatre, lodged with Vivares from 1764 to 1770, during which time he exhibited many northern views. In June 1763 Vivares visited the German engraver Johann Georg Wille in Paris: &#145;c'est un fort brave homme. Je l'aime&#146;, wrote Wille. A few months later Vivares supplied Wille with some English-made copper plates and burins. He visited Wille again in 1776 with his wife, &#145;et nous les avons vus avec plaisir&#146;. Vivares continued to work until his death on 26 November 1780. A part of his stock of prints was sold by auction on 25 October 1781. The print on which Vivares had been working when he died, <span class="italic">The Enchanted Castle</span> after Claude, was completed for his widow by William Woollett. Susanna Vivares had probably always run the shop and she continued to sell and publish prints from Newport Street until her death in 1792.<br>

<a name="cosubject_28336"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Vivares</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1744), <span class="occ">designer and landscape engraver</span>, the son of Francis Vivares, was baptized at All Saints' Church, Derby, on 4 September 1744. He may have been named after Thomas Smith of Derby, with whom his father was collaborating at the time of his birth. He was trained as an engraver by his father and between 1760 and 1766 won a succession of prizes for drawing or engraving from the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce. He exhibited drawings and engravings with the Free Society in 1764 and 1782 and with the Society of Artists in 1782. He married first Hannah Allen on 18 June 1783 and second Sally Lucas on 1 January 1786, both at St Pancras Old Church. Some of his working life was spent in Paris, where he engraved landscapes after P. Royer and Adrian Zingg.<br>
