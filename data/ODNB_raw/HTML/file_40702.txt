<span class="headword">Roberts,  William Edward <span class="st"> [Michael]</span></span>  (1902&#150;1948), <span class="occ">college head, literary scholar, and poet</span>, was born in Bournemouth on 6 December 1902, the eldest of four children of Edward George Roberts, a Bournemouth shopkeeper who also owned a small farm in the New Forest, and his wife, Henrietta Mary Sellers. He began his education in a New Forest village school before moving in 1914 to Bournemouth School on a scholarship, and then to King's College, London (1920&#150;22), where he took a BSc in chemistry, and to Trinity College, Cambridge (1922&#150;5), where he took a BA in mathematics, read widely in literature, philosophy, and history, and briefly became a communist. It was at Cambridge that he became known as Michael, because of his admiration for the Russian poet&#150;scientist Mikhail Lomonosov, and it was as Michael Roberts that he wrote his books and made his reputation.<br>
<br>Roberts was an educator all his adult life, except for the war years. He began as a physics master at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle upon Tyne, in 1925, moved to Mercers' School, London, in 1931 as senior maths master, but returned to Newcastle in 1934 to be sixth-form master at the grammar school. The following year he married the biographer and critic <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72888/', "Janet Buchanan Adam Smith (1905&#150;1999)")</script>, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36139/', "Sir George Adam Smith")</script>. There were three sons and a daughter of the marriage. From 1941 to 1945 he worked in London for the European service of the BBC; in 1943&#150;4 he provided programmes addressed to the editors of the clandestine press in occupied Europe. In March 1945 he returned to education as principal of the College of St Mark and St John in Chelsea, where he remained until his death.<br>
<br>Roberts in the classroom was a strenuous, intimidating figure&#151;tall, gaunt, hawk-faced&#151;who demanded more of his students than they thought they had in them. His classes were eclectically brilliant, like his mind; he taught not simply physics or maths, but a whole world of thought&#151;literature, politics, history, whatever he thought important at the moment. Weak students feared his scathing censure, but the best remembered him with gratitude. In his physical life Roberts's strenuousness led him to mountaineering (he was elected to the Alpine Club in 1936), and he made climbing a part of the education of his students. During school holidays he led parties of schoolboys on expeditions to the Lakes and the Alps that made extreme demands on both leader and followers, and as principal of St Mark and St John he continued to climb with students.<br>
<br>During the early 1930s Roberts began to establish a reputation as editor, critic, and poet. Two anthologies that he edited, <span class="italic">New Signatures</span> (1932) and <span class="italic">New Country</span> (1933), were the first collections of writings by his contemporaries to be published, and they did much to identify the Auden generation. These anthologies were followed by <span class="italic">Critique of Poetry</span> (1934), a book of essays that brought his scientist's rigour of thought to the analysis of poetry, rather in the way two other scientifically trained critics of the time, I. A. Richards and William Empson, did.<br>
<br>It was in those years that Roberts met T. S. Eliot, who became his editor at Faber and Faber and his close friend. His first book for his new publisher, <span class="italic">The Faber Book of Modern Verse</span> (1936), was an influential and long-lived anthology that included American as well as English poets, and helped to establish the literary definition of &#145;modern&#146; as transatlantic. (Equally long-lived was his <span class="italic">Faber Book of Comic Verse</span>, 1942, which remained in print for almost fifty years.)<br>
<br>In his other books for Faber, Roberts turned away from the literary and political preoccupations of his generation to consider broader philosophical issues. <span class="italic">The Modern Mind</span> (1937) is a study of the effects of science on language, and on attitudes toward religion, poetry, and science itself. <span class="italic">T. E. Hulme</span> (1938) is a study of the thought of the early twentieth-century philosopher. His last two books, <span class="italic">The Recovery of the West</span> (1941) and <span class="italic">The Estate of Man</span> (1951), deal with the future of mankind and of the earth, each book beginning with a scientist's concern for the husbanding of the world's resources, but expanding to include the social and moral implications of material problems.<br>
<br>Eliot regarded Roberts as the Hulme of his era. Like Hulme, he was a social philosopher out of step with his time, who valued conservative concepts such as tradition, order, and authority as essential to a civilized society (though unlike Hulme he retained his liberal social concerns for the poor and the powerless). Most of all Roberts shared with Hulme and Eliot a belief in the social necessity of religious faith. <span class="italic">The Recovery of the West</span> concludes that &#145;no civilization can be firm unless it is built on an enduring faith&#146;, and that &#145;for Western Europe there is no reputable and enduring faith except Christianity&#146;. Those seem always to have been his deep convictions.<br>
<br>Those convictions were fundamental to Roberts's remarkable work as principal of the Church of England training college of St Mark and St John. When he assumed the principalship in 1945 the college had been battered by war and vandalism, and its members consisted of a single teacher and a dozen students. His task was to restore the physical college, and to recruit a faculty and a student body; but he had also to create a new training programme suitable to post-war needs and compatible with the college's church affiliation. He succeeded admirably in these tasks, against great odds, before his tragically early death, from monocytic leukaemia, in Hammersmith Hospital on 13 December 1948. He was buried four days later at Mortlake cemetery.<br>
<br>During his lifetime Roberts wrote three volumes of poems: <span class="italic">These our Matins</span> (1930), <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1936), and <span class="italic">Orion Marches</span> (1939). His poems do not express the full range of his thought and feeling, and in that sense he was a minor poet, though a gifted and committed one. They speak primarily of his tragic sense of life in images of strain and conflict, of failure and death. This is especially true of the many fine poems he wrote about climbing, which was for him a personal symbol of the human qualities he most valued: strenuous effort, personal responsibility, and courage for its own sake.<br>
<br>In his obituary of Roberts, Eliot wrote: &#145;He remains &hellip; a rather lonely figure in his time: his ideas were not fashionable, nor are they sympathetic to any but a small minority now&#146;. That judgement continues to be true. But if he was isolated, it was a voluntary isolation. In a collective time he chose to be an independent thinker, neither right nor left, but himself.<br>
