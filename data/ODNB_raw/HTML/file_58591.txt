<span class="headword">Irving,  Lydia</span>  (1797&#150;1893), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was born on 15 May 1797 in Wellbury, Yorkshire, the eldest daughter of Hannah and John Irving; her father was clerk to W. Fry &amp; Co., Tea Dealers and Poultry, London. She was brought up by her grandparents, who were both strict Quakers, until their deaths, when she returned to her parents' home.<br>
<br>In July 1825 Lydia Irving joined the British Ladies Society for promoting the reformation of female prisoners, which had been founded in 1821 by Elizabeth Fry as an expansion of her Newgate committee. Lydia immediately began to visit White Cross Street prison. From January 1826 she helped audit the society's accounts and in December 1836 she became sub-treasurer of the society. In 1828 she was instrumental in gaining funding from the Navy Board to purchase the gifts given to each woman on board the transport ships, which prior to this had been funded entirely by the British Ladies. Subsequently, she became a member of the convict ship subcommittee, visiting most of the ships to distribute the gifts of useful articles&#151;which included aprons, a knife and fork, and needlework implements and materials&#151;before they sailed.<br>
<br>A Quaker herself, Lydia Irving was regarded by Elizabeth Fry as one of her closest friends and helpers. In 1838 Lydia accompanied Elizabeth and Joseph Fry to France with Josiah Forster and William Allen, in the service of the Friends, although she and Elizabeth Fry also visited women's prisons there. Irving was also an overseer at the Ratcliff and Barking monthly meetings of the Society of Friends and later at Devonshire House.<br>
<br>After the death of Elizabeth Fry in October 1845 the British Ladies Society carried on with its reform work. In her memory the Elizabeth Fry Refuge was founded, for penitent females of the servant classes. It was run by a subcommittee of the British Ladies Society which Lydia Irving joined on 1 April 1850; by 1852 she was the assistant secretary to the refuge. She resigned from the society in 1877, when the onset of blindness made prison visiting impossible. A member for more than fifty years, she was held in high esteem by other members, who relied on her administrative skills and long experience, and her retirement was marked by the presentation of a <span class="roman">Bible</span>. In 1881, by way of appreciation for all her hard work, the British Ladies presented Lydia with &pound;40; a further &pound;20 was promised annually.<br>
<br>Lydia Irving had lived at 9 Hardwich Place, Commercial Road, London, but towards the end of her life she resided with her niece, Louisa Dodshon, also a member of the British Ladies Society, at 11 Victoria Grove, Stoke Newington, London, maintaining her strict adherence to the principles and dress of the Society of Friends to the end. Two years before her death at Stoke Newington on 22 February 1893, the British Ladies Society amalgamated with the Elizabeth Fry Refuge.<br>
