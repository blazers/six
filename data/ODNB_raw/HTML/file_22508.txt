<span class="headword">Pont,  Timothy</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1574&#150;1611), <span class="occ">map maker and chorographer</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22507/', "Robert Pont (1524&#150;1606)")</script>, minister of the Church of Scotland, and his first wife, whose name is uncertain. Later sources give it as Katherine Masterton, but this may be a confusion with Robert's mother. Timothy had one brother, Zachary, and four sisters, Helen, Margaret, Catherine, and Beatrix. He had three stepbrothers, James, Robert, and Jonathan, born to his father's second or third wife, Margaret Smyth. The earliest documentary evidence of Timothy is dated 1574, when his father, then provost of Trinity College, Edinburgh, granted him, by charter, church lands in Forfarshire (Angus). He followed in his father's footsteps by matriculating from St Leonard's College, St Andrews, in 1580 from where he graduated BA in 1583. In 1592 or shortly thereafter Timothy was commissioned by Lord Menmuir, master of the metals, to visit and report on the mines and minerals of Orkney and Shetland. A letter from the dean of Limerick dated 1596 refers to Pont's having travelled all over Scotland. In 1600 or 1601 Timothy was appointed minister of Dunnet, Caithness; his elder brother Zachary officiated in the adjoining parish of Bower. Timothy was minister of Dunnet until at least 31 May 1611, on which day a bond records him as minister and refers to his wife, Isobell Blacadder.<br>
<br>Pont travelled throughout most of the mainland and islands of Scotland, recording some 20,000 place names on sketch maps and compiling detailed textual records of local history, economy, and genealogy, following contemporary chorographical practice. While some of his maps survive in manuscript, his texts are known only in transcription, so that many texts can be attributed only tentatively to him. An exception is &#145;Cuninghame topographized&#146; (<i>c</i>.1604&#150;1608), transcribed and attributed to Pont by Sir James Balfour of Denmiln, who was instrumental in getting Pont's maps engraved and published.<br>
<br>Pont's maps have attracted much more attention than his texts. Seventy-eight of his manuscript maps survive on thirty-eight sheets (NL Scot.). They were probably compiled between 1583 and 1596. With one or two possible exceptions his maps were not published in his lifetime. Following his death, lack of interest among his heirs, the economics of publishing, and copyright difficulties may all have militated against their publication. However, before 1629 Pont's manuscript maps were acquired by James Balfour, whose neighbour in Fife, Sir John Scot of Scotstarvet, had been approached by Willem Blaeu in Amsterdam for assistance in obtaining maps of Scotland for publication. Probably the entire collection of Pont's manuscript maps was passed to Blaeu in the early 1630s.<br>
<br>Blaeu engraved the more legible of Pont's maps without further reference to Scotland; these amounted to at least thirty-five plates, including one or two plates already in hand. Nevertheless, large gaps remained in his coverage of Scotland, and Pont's rougher drafts were too imperfect to be copied by Dutch engravers. Some of Pont's manuscripts, mainly his earlier and rougher working documents rather than the well-finished drafts already engraved, were returned to Scotland. (It is not known what happened to the rest, but they may have been lost in the fire which destroyed Blaeu's premises in 1671.) Before 1636 Robert Gordon of Straloch in Aberdeenshire began to collaborate with Scot on the completion of Blaeu's coverage and to compile maps for his own purposes. Over a period of some twelve years Gordon, with the support of church and state, prepared at least five and possibly as many as ten further draft maps for engraving in Amsterdam and inclusion in the Blaeu <span class="italic">Atlas</span>, using Pont's maps as virtually his sole source, except in his native north-east. He also drafted the map of the whole of Scotland, while his son, James Gordon of Rothiemay, compiled a new map of Fife. It was Pont's work in the field, however, which laid the foundations for this later work and which resulted in Scotland's becoming one of the most comprehensively mapped countries of Europe. On the death of Robert Gordon the Pont manuscript maps were passed to his son, James, and eventually to Sir Robert Sibbald, geographer to Charles II. After Sibbald's death in 1722 they were deposited in the Advocates' Library in Edinburgh, where they were catalogued by George Paton and later by Caleb Cash. They subsequently passed, with the rest of the Advocates' general collection, to the newly created National Library of Scotland. Some of the maps seen by Robert Gordon have not survived.<br>
<br>The forty-seven regional maps of Scotland published in Blaeu's <span class="italic">Atlas novus</span> (1654) provide almost complete coverage of the country excepting Angus and represent, therefore, a more extensive historical source for place names and their geographical locations than Pont's surviving manuscript maps, which cover only part of the country. Nevertheless, Pont's manuscripts are primary sources, and afford a rare opportunity for comparing the seventeenth-century printed map against the original observations.<br>
<br>Pont's motive for drawing his maps is unknown. He may have seen his work as a complement to that of William Camden. Pont and Camden were working at much the same time and knew of each other's activity. Camden's name appears on a Pont manuscript, and in his <span class="italic">Britannia</span> (1608) Camden excuses the brevity of his chapter on Scotland on the grounds of work in hand by someone else in Scotland. There is little information about Pont's methods of map compilation, other than what can be deduced from the extant manuscripts. There have been suggestions that he used survey techniques requiring instruments, but there is no independent evidence for this, and such techniques would have been difficult or impossible to use for a man working alone and at some speed. Pont seems to have simply transferred the mental image of what he saw on the ground to paper, locating settlements, churches, mills, castles, and large houses in relation to the rivers and streams which ran through the landscape, and in effect making sketch maps by eye. He used symbols, albeit rather inconsistently, to identify some named places. His manuscript maps contain much additional information, including sketches of prominent buildings, names of occupants, and textual entries on a range of subjects. Pont was a chorographer, not a topographic surveyor, and his maps should be understood, not as free-standing works, but as part of a larger chorographic record of Scotland, and he was perceptively described in 1776 as &#145;the great chorographer of Scotland&#146;  (Nicolson, 84).<br>
<br>The date and whereabouts of Pont's death, like those of his birth, are not known, but he may have died by 1614, by which time he had been replaced as minister of Dunnet. A plaque was erected to his memory in Dunnet church about 1912.<br>
