<span class="headword">Hobhouse,  Emily</span>  (1860&#150;1926), <span class="occ">social activist and charity worker</span>, was born on 9 April 1860 at St Ive, in Cornwall, the fifth of the six surviving children of Reginald Hobhouse (<i>d</i>. 1895), archdeacon of Bodmin, Cornwall, and his wife, Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1880), daughter of Sir William Salusbury-Trelawny, eighth baronet. Her youngest brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33906/', "Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse (1864&#150;1929)")</script>, and they maintained their childhood companionship in later life. Her uncle was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33902/', "Arthur Hobhouse, Baron Hobhouse (1819&#150;1904)")</script>; he and his wife, Margaret or Mary, provided for her materially and supported her campaigning work. Emily was educated at home by her mother and governesses, with one term at school in London in 1876. She remained at home, living in a way that was typical for unmarried women of her class, caring for her parents and doing parish work, but after her father's death she broke away from that life and went to the USA and Mexico to do philanthropic work for Cornish miners who had emigrated. She went to the mining town of Virginia, Minnesota, and although she found that the few Cornish miners there had little need of her help, being set apart by their &#145;sobriety, energy, skill and work&#146;  (Fry, 47), she undertook various mission welfare and temperance projects. After a broken engagement to an American businessman, John Carr Jackson, and the loss of much of her money, she returned to England in 1898.<br>
<br>Hobhouse became interested in the struggle for women's emancipation, and in November 1898 was elected to the executive of the Women's Industrial Council (founded in 1894). She worked as an investigator for the council, producing reports on child labour, and in 1900 was involved in a scheme to set up a company providing housing for &#145;educated working women&#146; in London  (<span class="italic">Women's Industrial News</span>, Dec 1900). She was also a supporter of the women's suffrage movement, although she did not endorse the militancy of the suffragettes.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of the South African War (11 October 1899) Hobhouse became a member of the South African Conciliation Committee, launched on 1 November 1899 with Leonard Courtney as its president, one of a number of organizations formed to combat the often violent &#145;jingoism&#146; of the war's supporters. She was the honorary secretary of its women's branch, formed early in 1900, and organized a number of protests against the war. Anger and concern about the effects of the war increased during 1900, after reports reached Britain of the British army's scorched-earth policy, which drove Boer women and children from their farms to be housed in refugee camps (subsequently described as concentration camps).<br>
<br>Emily Hobhouse set up a philanthropic committee, the South African Women and Children Distress Fund, to collect money to help the women and children, and, despite the reservations of her friends and family, travelled to South Africa in December 1900 to investigate conditions and to distribute funds. She obtained military permission to visit some of the camps and spent several months travelling between different camps in the Orange River and Cape colonies. She saw at first hand the disease and death, especially of children, that had resulted from overcrowding and lack of food and medical facilities. She worked with local women to improve conditions in those camps to which she was given access, and returned to Britain in May 1901. She travelled back on the same ship as Sir Alfred Milner, the British high commissioner, from whom she was surprised to learn that he had been sent more than sixty reports of her activities in South Africa.<br>
<br>Hobhouse and other members of her committees campaigned extensively to publicize the conditions in the camps, often against officially orchestrated hostility. She had some correspondence with members of the British government, including St John Brodrick and Joseph Chamberlain, and her report to the South African Distress Fund was published in June 1901. Influenced by Hobhouse, with whom he had had an interview, the Liberal leader, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, asked in a speech on 14 June: &#145;When is a war not a war? When it is carried on by methods of barbarism in South Africa&#146;  (Wilson, 349). Hobhouse's report had become a famous indictment. The government responded by appointing six women as a committee of inquiry into the camps, headed by Millicent Fawcett. Although conditions in many camps had been improved since Hobhouse's visits, the Fawcett committee shared her opinion about the lack of suitable accommodation and the poor organization of the camps, and their report, published in February 1902  (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1902, 67), made many of the same recommendations that she had made almost a year earlier.<br>
<br>Emily Hobhouse was refused membership of the committee, and when she tried to re-enter South Africa in November 1901 was not allowed to land, and was forcibly transferred to another ship and deported. She returned to South Africa in 1903 and set up various resettlement and rehabilitation projects, including the establishment of industrial schools for lace-making, spinning, and weaving, and in 1907 was appointed an adviser to manage public funds for the schools. Her co-worker and the honorary treasurer of the Boer Home Industries was the Quaker Anna Ruth Fry (1878&#150;1962), who compiled the first of the three memoirs of Hobhouse's life (1929).<br>
<br>In 1907&#150;8 the organization of the schools was taken over by the new governments in Transvaal and the Orange River Colony and Hobhouse resigned her post, returning to Europe in October 1908. In honour of her work for South Africa, Hugo Naud&eacute; was commissioned to paint her portrait, which was hung in the Pretoria Museum of Cultural History. She maintained friendships with many of the Boer leaders and others in South Africa, including Olive Schreiner and Mahatma Gandhi.<br>
<br>Emily Hobhouse lived mainly in Italy until the outbreak of the First World War, when her commitment to pacifism found practical expression in her work for the international women's movement for peace, and she worked at its secretariat in Amsterdam for three months in 1915. In 1916 she travelled through Germany and Belgium to investigate conditions for refugees, interned civilians, and prisoners of war, and met the German foreign minister, Gottlieb von Jagow (1863&#150;1935), who, she claimed, gave her the impression that he wanted her to suggest peace talks to the British authorities. She returned to England and helped to promote schemes for the exchange of prisoners of war.<br>
<br>After the armistice Hobhouse helped to set up a relief fund for enemy children&#151;the Fund to Aid Swiss Relief&#151;whose work was incorporated with that of the Save the Children Fund in April 1919, and she was also chairwoman of the Russian Babies' Fund. In September 1919 she visited Austria as a representative of the Save the Children Fund and compiled a report on conditions in Vienna and Leipzig; she set up a relief fund and oversaw its administration locally. For that work she was honoured by the city of Leipzig, and the German Red Cross gave her its decoration of second class. A marble bust of her was placed in the Rathaus of Leipzig, a copy of which was also sent to the war museum in Bloemfontein.<br>
<br>Hobhouse maintained her connections with South Africa, where subscriptions were raised to enable her to buy a house at St Ives, in Cornwall, in 1921, although she remained there only for two years, moving to London in 1923. She spent the last few years of her life working on an autobiography and a memoir of her work in South Africa, neither of which she was able to complete, although much of it has been published. A draft of the autobiography is held by the state archives in Bloemfontein. She published three accounts of the South African War: <span class="italic">War without Glamour, or, Women's War Experiences Written by Themselves, 1899&#150;1902</span> (1924); <span class="italic">The Brunt of the War and where it Fell</span> (1902); and a translation of the diary of Alida M. Badenhorst, <span class="italic">Tant'Alie of Transvaal (A.M. Badenhorst): her Diary, 1880&#150;1902</span> (1923).<br>
<br>Emily Hobhouse contracted pleurisy after a long illness and died in London on 8 June 1926. A memorial service was held for her at St Mary Abbots Church, Kensington, and on 26 October 1926 her ashes were buried at the Bloemfontein war memorial, South Africa, where only she, President Steyn, and General de Wet are buried. The ceremony testified to her status as a heroine among the Boer people and is recorded in a number of photographs, some of which are in Hobhouse family collections and others in the war museum at Bloemfontein. Her reputation remained strong in South Africa, where many tributes were published. J. C. Smuts wrote of her &#145;great spirit of human service&#146; and &#145;the strong and vivid personality which at times made her difficult to work with&#146;, concluding that &#145;She lies buried in the hearts of a grateful people&#146;  (Fry, 10&#150;11).<br>
