<span class="headword">Taylor,  John Ellor</span>  (1837&#150;1895), <span class="occ">curator and popularizer of science</span>, was born on 21 September 1837 at Levenshulme, near Manchester, the eldest son of William Taylor (<i>d</i>. 1864), a Lancashire cotton-factory foreman, and his wife, Maria Ellor (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1806, <i>d</i>. after 1895). He received minimal education, and was first employed at a locomotive works at Longsight, Manchester, about 1850. About 1852 he was bound apprentice there as a fitter and turner. Encouraged to private study in classical languages and natural history, he attended classes at Manchester Mechanics' Institution when seventeen, and a year later became a Wesleyan lay preacher.<br>
<br>Taylor's opinions obliged him to choose between a religious and a scientific career; geological studies led him to Norwich, where he began popular lecturing about 1858. He commenced sub-editing on the <span class="italic">Norwich Mercury</span> for Richard Noverra Bacon in 1863, and soon gained success as editor of its offshoot, the <span class="italic">People's Weekly Journal</span>, which he made a vehicle for his popular scientific effusions. He was scarred by smallpox while investigating social conditions attending a severe outbreak of the disease in Norwich. He married on 22 January 1867 Sarah Harriet (<i>b</i>. 1846/7), youngest daughter of William Bellamy, headmaster of the Boys' Model School, Norwich. They later had four daughters.<br>
<br>Together with John Gunn, Taylor established the Norwich Geological Society in 1864, and his original researches in Pliocene and Pleistocene deposits led to his election as fellow of the Geological Society of London in 1869. In 1870 he founded the Norwich Science-Gossip Club and by invitation catalogued the displays at Ipswich Corporation Museum, where he was appointed curator in 1872. Between 1872 and 1892 he delivered annual free lecture series in natural sciences in Ipswich (the material was later reworked as popular books), frequently commanding attendances of more than 450, meeting all expenses, and winning widespread affection. Robert Hardwicke appointed him editor of <span class="italic">Hardwicke's Science-Gossip Magazine</span> in 1872 (where he gained a national readership), and the following year introduced him to fellowship of the Linnean Society. He may have obtained a doctorate about 1874&#151;from about this date he identifies himself in book titles as a PhD. Taylor lectured in many parts of England, and through the Ipswich Scientific Society he guided a young intellectual circle towards industrial and technological innovation, so promoting enlightened governance of that town in the forthcoming generation. He helped assemble the founding group of the <span class="italic">East Anglian Daily Times</span> (1874), through which his lectures were widely disseminated.<br>
<br>Taylor was a companionable man of liberal and humane sympathies, and his teaching reconciled orthodox science with reverence for the divine principle in creation; his gifts of popular exposition were particularly admired by Professor Ray Lankester. Having enlisted Richard Wallace's patronage, he masterminded the creation of the new museum at Ipswich in 1881, soon afterwards receiving a testimonial of &pound;733 raised from public subscription in recognition of his public service and modest salary. R. S. Smythe promoted his successful lecture tour of Australia in 1885. Weakening health compelled him to resign his editorial duties and curatorship in 1893, and in September 1893 he was declared bankrupt, owing &pound;735. Taylor continued to lecture until two weeks before his death at his home, 3 Little Colman Street, Ipswich, on 28 September 1895. He was buried at Ipswich cemetery two days later. He was survived by his wife and four daughters.<br>
