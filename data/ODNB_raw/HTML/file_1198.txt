<span class="headword">Balfour, Sir  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1660), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer</span>, was the son of Colonel Henry Balfour (<i>d</i>. 1580), a member of the Balfour family of Pitcullo, Fife, and his wife, Christian Cant.<br>
<br>William Balfour followed his father's example by serving the Dutch in the Scottish brigade. By 19 February 1594 he had risen to lieutenant, and he was then advanced to the captaincy of Colonel Bartolt Balfour's company of 150 heavy infantry. Balfour seems to have returned to Britain at some point. On 15 April 1605 James VI and I supported a petition of Balfour's to the Dutch estates for a debt due to his father, describing him as &#145;notre serviteur domesticque&#146; (&#145;our household servant&#146;); Balfour had by that point also acquired a knighthood. From March to November 1605 he served as a captain in Scott of Buccleuch's regiment in the Netherlands. In 1608 he petitioned the estates again for money owed to his father and Captain David Cant, his uncle, but he met with no success. He served as sergeant-major of the Scots regiment on the Juliers campaign in 1610. Between 1613 and 1615, with the assistance of King James, the elector palatine, and the Dutch ambassador to Britain, Balfour managed to secure the payment of 2000 guilders in cash and 600 guilders per annum for his father's, his uncle's, and his own arrears. Balfour served as a captain of horse arquebusiers from 1615 or 1616 to 1624. In April 1621, as a cavalry captain in Nijmegen, he petitioned for eleven months' pay incurred between November 1618 and September 1619, while his petition noted that he had been absent once on business in England. In 1622 the Spanish captured him at Emmerich.<br>
<br>In 1625 Charles I requested that the estates lend him Balfour to command a company of Carabiniers, but the Dutch refused. Two years later, on 18 August 1627, the king approved Balfour as the earl of Morton's choice as his lieutenant-colonel, and again wrote to the Dutch for his services. This time he was released and served on the &Icirc;le de R&eacute; expedition under the duke of Buckingham. In January 1628 he and Colonel John Dalbier received orders to raise 1000 horse from Friesland. However, the estates refused permission for levying in the United Provinces because of their own needs in the war with Spain. Balfour and Dalbier moved their efforts to Emden in north Germany. Buckingham's death in July led to the refusal of bills of exchange for the regiment; thus the English could not support the 1000-man regiment. The Dutch had no desire for the unit, but agreed to pay for its quartering before it disbanded. Meanwhile Balfour had resigned his commission with his long-time employers, who reluctantly released him with a gold chain worth 1000 guilders and the promise to keep him in mind for future services.<br>
<br>Balfour's first wife, Helen, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19745/', "Sir Archibald Napier")</script> of Merchiston, died in December 1629, and at some later point he married a woman named Isabella (<i>d</i>. 1661). Balfour's concentration on serving Charles I in England during the personal rule proved to his advantage. The king appointed him a gentleman of the privy chamber, and he succeeded Sir Allen Apsley as lieutenant of the Tower of London on 18 October 1630 following the latter's death. In July 1631 the crown paid him for his recruiting efforts of three years earlier. From 24 September to 9 November Balfour went on a secret mission for the king observing French activities near Dunkirk. Balfour continued as a dedicated servant of the crown for some years. In 1633 with Sir William Parkhurst and Andrew Palmer he received a grant to make gold and silver money in the Tower for eleven years. That December the privy council named him one of the commissioners to investigate the complaints of the opponents of the soap monopoly. In January 1635 he was named to the commission examining the conduct of the keeper of the Fleet prison. In the following year he assisted with plague control in London and as a surveyor of the armoury's swords (which dragged on until 1641). His role as a royal gaoler involved him in the seizure of the papers of William Prynne and with conducting Bishop John Williams of Lincoln to Lambeth in 1637. His support for the crown continued with appointments to the council of war in June 1638 and to boards investigating illegal duties charged in Bristol and the fortification of the Isles of Scilly. In May 1640 he mobilized the London militia and reinforced the Tower garrison with some of them.<br>
<br>The king's defeat in the second bishops' war seems to have wrought a change in Balfour's attitude. The arch-Scotophobe Clarendon later wrote,<blockquote>from the beginning of [the Long] Parliament (according to the natural custom of his country), [he] forgot all his obligations to the King, and made himself very gracious to those people whose glory it was to be thought enemies to the Court. (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 1.477)</blockquote>Religious motivation, his presbyterianism, and anti-Catholicism probably played the largest part in his volte-face (in 1638 he struck a priest &#145;two or three sound Blows with his Battoon&#146; who was trying to convert his wife; Radcliffe, 2.166). But latent Scottish nationalism may also have had something to do with his change. Balfour served as the earl of Strafford's gaoler and sat beside him daily during his trial in the spring of 1641. He refused entry to Captain Billingsley's band of would-be rescuers of the condemned earl on 2 May and a few days later he spurned Strafford's offer of &pound;20,000 and a good match for his son for allowing him to escape. It was reported that Balfour voluntarily resigned the lieutenancy of the Tower on 22 December 1641 but it is likelier, given the king's confrontational attitude in the winter of 1641&#150;2, that his parting was forced; his departure from a post so vital to the security of the capital alarmed both the House of Commons and inhabitants of London.<br>
<br>Balfour's departure from a position of public trust proved only temporary. In the spring of 1642 he was given command of a horse regiment destined for service in Ulster, a command which would have combined religious commitment and self-interest (one newsbook indeed suggested that he had resigned the lieutenancy so that he could go to protect his estates there against the Catholic rebels). However, the war in England intervened and the parliament rapidly secured the sexagenarian Balfour's services. On 7 August 1642 he was appointed lieutenant-general of horse under the command of the earl of Bedford. In September he won a skirmish on the Severn. At Edgehill he commanded the reserve and performed a brilliant role in preventing a parliamentarian collapse. At the head of his and Stapleton's horse regiments he charged and broke Sir Nicholas Byron's foot brigade. Turning on Colonel Richard Fielding's foot brigade Balfour's command routed it. The cavalrymen then charged the royalist artillery, driving the gunners away and capturing some guns. However, Balfour lacked the equipment to spike the guns, so he had his men merely cut the guns' ropes. Before withdrawing Balfour attacked the guard protecting princes Charles and James.<br>
<br>In 1643 he missed the first battle of Newbury, having gone abroad to take the waters. In March 1644 Essex detached him to Sir William Waller's army with four regiments of horse and a regiment of dragoons (1500&#150;2000 men). At the battle of Cheriton on 29 March Balfour assisted Waller in defeating Sir Ralph Hopton's royalist army. In the pursuit on 30 March he captured Elizabeth, Lady Hopton, and 200 royalists. Afterwards he rejoined Essex and marched with him into Cornwall, having taken Weymouth and Taunton in June 1644. When Essex's army was surrounded Balfour managed to break out with the cavalry. He linked up with Lieutenant-General John Middleton, commander of Waller's horse. At the second battle of Newbury he commanded the right wing of the parliamentarian horse. On 28 October Sir Archibald Johnston and John Crew MP reported that &#145;Sir W. Balfour used great diligence&#146; in the battle  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1644&#150;5</i>, 76).<br>
<br>Essex reported Balfour ill on 7 November and requested a replacement. On 21 January 1645 the House of Commons ordered that Balfour receive &#145;fit recompense and acknowledgement of the faithful services done by him to the public&#146; as he left the army owing to the self-denying ordinance (which forced foreigners to resign)  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 4.26). Six days later the earl of Leven received orders to give Balfour's ten troops of horse who were serving in Ulster to the command of Lieutenant-Colonel George Munro. In mid-February Balfour undertook his last public service for parliament when he subdued a mutiny of three cavalry regiments (including his own) at Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. Suspicions about Balfour's loyalty to the English parliament arising from intercepted correspondence delayed the settlement of his arrears: the &pound;1677 awarded him in November 1646 went unpaid until late 1655. On 3 July 1650, as Cromwell's invasion of Scotland loomed, the Scottish parliament put Balfour in command of &#145;strangers or native volunteiris&#146;  (<span class="italic">APS</span>, 6, part 2.600). Although he does not seem to have acted on the commission his allegiance was with the Scots. In April 1651 his wife was given four weeks to leave England. Balfour lived in obscurity in Westminster in the 1650s, and died there, having made his will on 16 July 1660; he was buried twelve days later in St Margaret's, Westminster.<br>
<br>Two of Balfour's sons had, like their father and grandfather, served in the Dutch army; both had been killed in the civil wars, one in Somerset and one in Ireland, so that only one son, Charles, outlived Balfour. Charles was eventually succeeded by his son, Charles William (<i>d</i>. 1739). Sir William had four daughters. Isabel (or Isabella) married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1191/', "John Balfour, master of Burleigh (later third Lord Balfour of Burleigh)")</script>, in London in 1649, a marriage which the young man's father tried to get annulled. Emilia (<i>d</i>. 1683) married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26455/', "Alexander Stewart, fifth earl of Moray")</script>, in or before 1658. Susanna (or Susan) married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12074/', "Hugh Hamilton")</script> of Ballygally, co. Tyrone, Baron de Deserf in the nobility of Sweden and first Lord Hamilton of Glenawly in the peerage of Ireland; after his death she married Henry Mervyn of Trillick, co. Tyrone. Balfour's fourth daughter, Lucy, married Blayney Townley, another Irish settler. Their son Harry became the heir of Charles William Balfour and founded the family of Balfour of Townley Hall, co. Louth.<br>
