<span class="headword">Williams,  Edward</span>  (1781&#150;1855), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born in Lambeth, London, and baptized on 13 October 1781 at St Mary, Lambeth, the son of Edward Williams, an engraver, and his wife, Mary Ward (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1764). <span class="italic">The Coke and Perkin</span> (after John Hamilton Mortimer) from Chaucer's <span class="italic">Canterbury Tales</span>, published by J. R. Smith in 1787, shows his father to have been a competent engraver, but he was also an irresponsible roisterer, whose wife ran off with one of her many lovers, leaving the young Edward to the care of his maternal uncle, the engraver and painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28686/', "James Ward")</script>. Williams was not strictly a pupil of Ward, but some examples of his work demonstrate the influence of mezzotints by the latter, after the paintings of George Morland, who had married Williams's aunt Ann Ward. Williams was briefly placed with a carver and gilder, but soon began work as a picture maker, executing copies in the manner of the Dutch school of Ruisdael and Hobbema, later apparent in the strong colours and stormy skies, the watermills and woodland glades of his established style. Early original work by Williams is not well documented and was rarely signed. If present, &#145;E. Wms.&#146; was his most usual form of signature. Typical subjects included river and heath scenes, frequently painted under moonlight, which earned him the sobriquet of Moonlight Williams.<br>
<br>Edward Williams married Ann Hildebrandt (1780&#150;1851) (who was of German-Jewish descent) on 12 February 1806 at St Pancras Church, Pancras Road, London. They had six sons, who all became successful landscape painters, three of them adopting different names to avoid confusion: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2751/', "Henry John Boddington (1811&#150;1865)")</script>, who used the maiden name of his wife, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21953/', "Sidney Richard Percy (1821&#150;1886)")</script> and Arthur Gilbert (1819&#150;1895), who worked under their last forename. The other three sons, Edward Charles (1807&#150;1881), George Augustus (1814&#150;1901), and Alfred Walter (1824&#150;1905), retained their surname. The son and daughter of George Augustus were also painters: Walter Williams (1835&#150;1906) and Caroline F. Williams (1836&#150;1921). All worked in the family manner, showing at the Royal Academy and other London and provincial exhibitions. A reviewer of the British Institution exhibition noted that &#145;The Williamses (whose name is legion) have contributed a vast number of paintings of much merit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Observer</span>, 6 Feb 1859).<br>
<br>In 1846 Edward Williams moved from 100 Cromer Street, Brunswick Square, in the artists' quarter of London to 32 Castelnau Villas, a new house in suburban Barnes, Surrey; he was joined in this area by his six sons. Old Williams (as he was sometimes known) undoubtedly repeated popular themes, but some of his most authoritative work was produced late in his career. <span class="italic">On the Thames: Looking towards Putney</span> (exh. National Institution 1850) led one reviewer to observe that he &#145;never could have painted more effectively &hellip; the vapoury atmosphere and clouded sky in this picture is perfect, and not less true is the manner in which the [moon] light is broken on the trees, water, and near objects&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 12, 1850, 138).<br>
<br>Edward Williams died at his home in Barnes on 24 June 1855 and was buried in the Old Barnes cemetery. An obituarist noted that &#145;This agreeable painter &hellip; has trained what must almost be called a school of landscape painters in his sons &hellip; whenever family groups of painters are mentioned the name of Mr. E. Williams must reappear&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 14 July 1855). <span class="italic">Landscape with Figures by Moonlight</span> (1826) and <span class="italic">Village Forge&#151;Moonlight</span> (1847) by Williams are in the Tate collection, and <span class="italic">The Mill</span> is owned by the Castle Museum, Norwich, one of various provincial collections that hold examples of his work.<br>
