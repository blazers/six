<span class="headword">Malard,  Michael</span>  (<em>b. </em>1676), <span class="occ">religious controversialist and tutor in French</span>, was born at Vaurenard, near M&acirc;con, France, the son of Fran&ccedil;ois Malard, a doctor of Vaurenard; his mother later married a M. Patissier de la Fayette of Beaugeu. His parents were Roman Catholics and he was prepared for the priesthood but after serving for some years as pasteur at Belleville, Beaujolais, he came to England about 1700 and was converted to the protestant religion at the French church of the Savoy, London, on 15 April 1705. Shortly after his conversion differences with the French protestants, whom he offended by becoming an episcopalian, drove him abroad.<br>
<br>On his return to England, Malard earned a living by teaching but he also produced a series of bitter attacks on the French committee for the distribution of the &pound;15,000 that, since the beginning of William III's reign, had been annually allocated to the French protestants. His first extraordinary pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Case, and Humble Petition, of Michael Malard</span> (1717), not only accuses Claude Grost&ecirc;te de la Mothe of stealing Malard's certificates of ordination and references but also of inveigling him into a bigamous marriage. In 1718 Malard published further accusations of malpractice within the French committee in <span class="italic">The French Plot Found out Against the English Church</span>. Jean Armand Dubourdieu, one of the ministers in the French church of the Savoy, responded with <span class="italic">An Appeal to the English Nation</span> (1718), in which he accused Malard of repeated adultery and attributed the withdrawal of his allowance to his scandalous life. Malard nevertheless continued his attacks in further publications.<br>
<br>Malard also wrote several manuals on accidence in French grammar, and in <span class="italic">The French and Protestant Companion, or, A Journey into Europe, Asia, and Africa</span> (1718), which is dedicated to George I, Malard is described as French tutor to the daughters of the prince of Wales, afterwards George II. The <span class="italic">Companion</span>, a curious mixture of grammar, travel book, and anti-Catholic satire, is offered by Malard to British parents as a safely protestant means of learning the French language. It was reprinted in 1719 and 1722. It is not known when or where Malard died.<br>
