<span class="headword">Warde, Sir  Henry</span>  (1766&#150;1834), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, born on 7 January 1766, was the fourth son of John Warde (1721&#150;1775) of Squerryes, near Westerham, Kent, and his second wife, Kitty Anne (<i>d</i>. 1767), daughter and sole heir of Charles Hoskins of Croydon, Surrey. The family was descended from a younger branch of that established at Hooton Pagnell in Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Warde entered the army as an ensign in the 1st foot guards in 1783, and on 6 July 1790 was promoted lieutenant and brevet captain. In 1791 he accompanied his regiment to the Netherlands, but was so severely wounded at the siege of Valenciennes that he had to return to England. He rejoined his regiment in June 1794, and continued to serve with it, acting as adjutant to the 3rd battalion, until his promotion to a company, with the brevet rank of lieutenant-colonel, on 15 October 1794, when he was sent home. Warde served in the expeditions to Ostend and The Helder, and received the brevet rank of colonel on 1 January 1801. In 1804 he was promoted brigadier-general, and in 1807 took part in the expedition to Copenhagen. In 1808 he became major-general. On 28 May 1808 he married Molina (1776&#150;1835), daughter of John Thomas of Hereford. They had five sons including Henry John Warde, and a daughter, Harriett (<i>d</i>. 1874), who on 4 May 1826 married Francis North, sixth earl of Guilford.<br>
<br>Warde commanded the 1st brigade of foot guards sent to Spain in 1808 with the force under Sir David Baird, and returned to England in 1809 after the battle of Corunna. In 1809 he was sent to India, and served under Lieutenant-General (afterwards Sir John) Abercromby (1772&#150;1817) at the capture of Mauritius in 1810. He remained there for some time in command of the troops, and acted as governor from 9 April to 12 July 1811. In 1813 he was appointed colonel of the 68th foot, and promoted lieutenant-general. On the enlargement of the Order of the Bath on 2 January 1815 he was made KCB. On 8 February 1821 he was appointed governor of Barbados, in succession to Lord Combermere. He arrived at the island on 25 June, and continued in office until 21 June 1827. His administration was reportedly popular, although differences between the two branches of the legislature, the council and the house of assembly, at times made the governor's course difficult. The restlessness of the slaves, who were disturbed by rumours of emancipation, also occasioned him anxiety. In 1830 he became general, and in 1831 was appointed colonel of the 31st foot. On 13 September 1831 he was made GCB. He died at his residence, Dean House, near Alresford in Hampshire, on 1 October 1834, and was buried that month.<br>

<a name="cosubject_28715"></a><span class="headword">Sir Edward Charles Warde</span>  (1810&#150;1884), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born at Government House, Bangalore, India, on 13 November 1810, was Sir Henry Warde's second son. On 19 May 1828 he was gazetted second lieutenant, Royal Artillery, and on 30 June 1830 was promoted first lieutenant, Royal Horse Artillery. He obtained a company on 5 June 1841, and was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 17 February 1854. He commanded the siege train before Sevastopol until incapacitated by fever three weeks before the fall of the fortress; and on the conclusion of the war received, on 29 August 1857, the rank of colonel, taking command of the artillery at Aldershot. In 1859, when war with France seemed imminent, he was ordered to superintend the rearmament of Malta. In 1861 he was appointed to command the artillery in the south-west district, and in 1864 was selected to command the Woolwich district. An explosion at Erith destroyed the river wall and threatened to flood the country to Camberwell, and burst the great sewers just completed. In less than an hour Warde had taken measures which averted the catastrophe. He received the thanks of the government, and, on resigning the command in 1869, was made KCB (2 June 1869). He became major-general on 27 February 1866, colonel commandant on 29 March 1873, lieutenant-general on 17 November 1878, and general on 1 October 1877. On 24 August 1843 he married Jane (<i>d</i>. 1895), eldest daughter of Charles Lane, rector of Wrotham and rural dean of Shoreham, Kent; they had four sons and three daughters. He died at Brighton on 10 June 1884 and was buried at Wrotham, Kent.<br>
