<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Weber,  Carl Maria Friedrich Ernst  von</span>  (1786&#150;1826), <span class="occ">composer and conductor</span>, was born probably on 18 November (baptized 20 November) 1786 in Eutin, Holstein, the ninth of the ten children of the composer Franz Anton von Weber (1734?&#150;1812), and the first with his second wife, Genovefa Brenner (1764&#150;1798), an actress and singer. The baronial &#145;von&#146; seems to have been misappropriated by his father, and was used in good faith by the composer. He was a sickly child who retained all his life a frail form and a pronounced limp. In 1817 he married the singer Caroline Brandt; they had three children, the second of whom, Max Maria, became his father's first major biographer.<br>
<br>Weber's European fame dated from the triumphant premi&egrave;re of <span class="italic">Der Freisch&uuml;tz</span> in Berlin in 1821. By 1824 five different versions were playing in London, though these were travesties, burlesques, or other distortions. Nevertheless, the work's popularity led Charles Kemble, the manager of Covent Garden (where one of the versions was staged), to offer him a commission for an opera. Now mortally ill with tuberculosis, Weber accepted in the hope of making some money to keep his family after his death. He was further persuaded to accept and to go to England to conduct by his doctor's advice that he had only months to live, and hoped to supplement Kemble's niggardly offer of &pound;500 plus expenses with concerts in wealthy London homes. He was in ignorance of the conditions of the London stage that made impossible the production of a continuously composed German opera such as he was pioneering. He realized his mistake only when he received the first drafts from his librettist, the pantomime writer James Robinson Planch&eacute;, who persuaded him that an entertainment with lavish scenery and stage machinery, star singing, copious dialogue, and only an incidental role for music was what the English understood by opera. To help his task, he took 153 English lessons, and was not only able to express himself clearly (&#145;my little bit of English is incredibly useful to me&#146;, he later wrote to his wife, Caroline) but made very few errors in setting the text of <span class="italic">Oberon</span>. He was also commissioned by George Thomson of Edinburgh to contribute to the publishing venture of setting British folk-songs, and he wrote <span class="italic">Ten Scottish Folksongs</span> in 1825.<br>
<br>Weber arrived in England on 3 March 1826, and was made comfortable in Sir George Smart's house in Great Portland Street. On the 6th he visited Covent Garden, where the audience recognized him and cheered him repeatedly (&#145;Are these the <i>cold</i> English welcoming me?&#146;, he wrote to Caroline). Kemble further commissioned him to conduct some concerts, one of them of selections from <span class="italic">Der Freisch&uuml;tz</span> (a lithograph by J. Hayter shows him in three positions and using a roll of paper, as was the custom).<br>
<br>The first of sixteen <span class="italic">Oberon</span> rehearsals was on the 9th, and after various difficulties, caused chiefly by the singers, the first of twelve sold-out performances took place on 12 April. It was a triumph, but the effort brought Weber's health even lower. Despite all Smart's solicitude, and the attentions of Londoners who had observed his weakness with sympathy and admiration, he continued to sink. The late, cold spring and thick fogs hastened his decline. He gave many piano recitals in aristocratic houses, though often barely able to stand or get his breath, and managed to write some small pieces for which he was asked, including, as his last composition, an English setting of Thomas Moore's &#145;From Chindara's warbling fount&#146;. His letters home are cheerful, but his diary betrays his weakness and fright. His last concert was at a benefit for one of his <span class="italic">Oberon</span> singers, Mary Anne Paton, on 30 May. He insisted on planning to set off for home on 6 June, but was found dead on the morning of the 5th at 91 Great Portland Street, London.<br>
<br>The death certificate gave as the cause of death tuberculosis of the lungs and many secondary conditions. The body was embalmed and taken in a solemn procession on 21 June to Moorfields Chapel, where it rested until it was returned, largely at the insistence of Richard Wagner, to Dresden in 1844.<br>
