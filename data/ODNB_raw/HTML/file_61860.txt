<span class="headword">Dering <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Harvey]</span>,  Mary</span>, Lady Dering  (<em>bap. </em>1629, <em>d.</em> 1704), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was baptized at St Laurence Pountney, London, on 3 September 1629, the daughter of Daniel Harvey (1587&#150;1647), merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kynnersley (<i>bap</i>. 1601, <i>d</i>. 1655). Her father was described by his son-in-law as &#145;a Turkey merchant of very eminent loyaltie, prudence, integritie and generositie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries and Papers</span>, 109); her uncle William Harvey was the discoverer of the circulation of blood. Mary attended Mrs Salmon's boarding-school in Hackney, where Katherine Fowler (later Mrs Philips, &#145;the matchless Orinda&#146;) and Mary Aubrey, niece of the antiquary John Aubrey, were among her friends. About 1645 she made a clandestine marriage to her cousin William Hauke (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1625), who had been her father's apprentice. According to one account Hauke &#145;had bedded with her twelve months before the marriage was discovered&#146;  (Hasted, 7.469) but Sir Roger Twysden's near-contemporary account tells of her &#145;the very day returning him his ring, and disclayming it, and never suffering him to come neere her&#146;  (Twysden, fol. 95<i>v</i>). An annulment was obtained, and on 5 April 1648 Mary married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37354/', "Sir Edward Dering (1625&#150;1684)")</script> of Surrenden Dering, Pluckley, Kent.<br>
<br>In 1649 Mary was taking lessons with the composer Henry Lawes, who had known Dering's father and who, during the civil war, &#145;betook himself to the teaching of ladies to sing&#146;  (Hawkins, 4.56). When Lawes published his <span class="italic">Second Book of Ayres, and Dialogues</span> in 1655 he dedicated it to Lady Dering:<blockquote>Not only in regard of that honour and esteem you have for <i>Musick</i>, but because those Songs which fill this Book have receiv'd much lustre by your excellent performance of them; and (which I confesse I rejoice to speak of) some which I esteem the best of these <i>Ayres</i>, were of your own <i>Composition</i>, after your Noble Husband was pleased to give the <i>Words</i>. (Lawes, a2)</blockquote>Three charming airs in the style of her master&#151;&#145;When first I saw fair Doris eyes&#146;, &#145;And is this all? what one poor kisse?&#146;, and &#145;In vain, fair Cloris, you design&#146;&#151;bear the words &#145;The Lady <i>Deerings</i> Composing&#146;. All the other works in the book are by Lawes himself. Sir Edward, who wrote the words for all three of his wife's songs, was an accomplished poet and was known in the Katherine Philips circle as &#145;the noble Sylvander&#146;. It was rare for well-born amateurs to allow works to be published under their own names, and this is the first time that a woman composer is thus credited, so it is remarkable that in this Lawes volume the work of the Derings is so clearly acknowledged.<br>
<br>The marriage of the Derings proved a notably happy one. No more compositions by Lady Mary Dering were published, but she had seventeen children, ten of whom survived childhood. On his wedding anniversary in April 1684, two months before his death, Sir Edward wrote: &#145;after 36 years I believe we are not weary of one another, nor our children weary of either of us&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries and Papers</span>, 28). Lady Dering died at Surrenden Dering on 7 February 1704 and was buried in the family vault at Pluckley on 12 February.<br>
