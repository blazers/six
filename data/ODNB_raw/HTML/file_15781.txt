<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Knox,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1514&#150;1572), <span class="occ">religious reformer</span>, was born at Giffordgate in Haddington. His mother was a Sinclair, a name he occasionally adopted as an alias when in hiding, and his father was William Knox, whose family had a long and proud tradition of service to the earls of Bothwell. William, probably an elder brother, was the only other known member of his immediate family. John seems to have been educated in the local burgh school and, though not taking a degree, continued his studies at St Andrews University where he was taught by John Mair, the great scholastic thinker who had returned there in 1528. Pursuing a conventional career pattern, Knox entered the church, being ordained deacon and priest in the late 1530s by William Chisholm, bishop of Dunblane. Using his training in canon law, by 1540 he was practising as a notary in and around Haddington.<h2>
<a name="Firstencounterswithreform"></a>First encounters with reform</h2>In 1543 the fledgeling underground protestant movement within Scotland was given added impetus by Regent Arran's brief flirtation with evangelical reform. The authorized preaching tour of Lothian by Thomas Guilliame, a former Dominican prior of Inverness, provided Knox with his first introduction to protestant ideas. Nothing else is known about his conversion, though on his deathbed Knox asked to hear <span class="roman">John</span> 17, where, as he recollected, &#145;I cast my first ancre&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 6.643). The major formative influence upon the future reformer was George Wishart, whose rousing sermons in 1544&#150;5 had a revitalizing effect upon supporters of reform. By this time Knox had become a tutor in East Lothian to Francis and George, sons of Hugh Douglas of Longniddry, and Alexander, the eldest son of John Cockburn of Ormiston. Under his supervision the three boys studied Latin grammar and literature, the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and a catechism. Their fathers were members of the group of lairds supporting and protecting Wishart, and from about January 1546 Knox was one of the preacher's entourage, proudly carrying a two-handed sword during meetings. On the night of his arrest Wishart took the sword from Knox and ordered him back to his bairns, saying &#145;One is sufficient for one sacrifice&#146;  (ibid., 1.139). After his trial for heresy in St Andrews Wishart was executed there on 1 March 1546.<br>
<br>Believing he was in danger as one of Wishart's known associates, Knox went into hiding, even considering flight to Germany. This proved unnecessary, and at Easter 1547 he and his pupils entered St Andrews Castle. It was held during a protracted and half-hearted siege by protestant sympathizers who had murdered Cardinal David Beaton, partly in revenge for Wishart's death. Knox quietly resumed teaching his charges, lecturing in the castle chapel on the passage in the gospel of <span class="roman">John</span> that they had reached in their studies. This exposition was heard by two protestants, John Rough and Henry Balnaves, who tried to persuade Knox to become a preacher. He refused outright, protesting vehemently that he had not been called by God. Rough and Balnaves consulted Sir David Lindsay of The Mount, an advocate of religious reform who had been negotiating with the castle on behalf of the Scottish government. Rough then delivered a sermon explaining how a congregation could call its minister and concluding with a specific charge to Knox to accept such a call. Overcome, Knox burst into tears and ran off to his room. For several days he wrestled miserably with his conscience, before finally accepting his vocation.<br>
<br>During the siege the St Andrews parish church of Holy Trinity had been treated to two series of sermons, one putting the protestant case by Rough, and the other defending Roman Catholicism by John Annand, the principal of St Leonard's College in the university. With Annand getting the better of the argument, Knox had been supplying Rough with notes to refute his opponent's points. When Annand asserted that only the church could judge heresy, Knox challenged him, adding he could prove the pope was Antichrist and that the Roman church was &#145;the synagog of Sathan&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.189). Although his opponent refused, the congregation enthusiastically accepted the offer, insisting Knox speak so that the non-literate could follow his reasons. This left Knox with no option but to preach for the first time the following Sunday.<br>
<br>Knox's initial sermon, which the St Andrews wiseacres predicted would get him burnt for heresy, set the tone for the rest of his ministry. It was a hard-hitting attack striking at the roots of papal authority and brim full of fire and thunder. The chosen text, <span class="roman">Daniel</span> 7: 24&#150;5, spoke of the last beast, also identified with the Antichrist of the book of <span class="roman">Revelation</span>, signalling that even at this early stage Knox was interpreting the contemporary situation in apocalyptic terms. Most of the sermon argued that the papacy's doctrine and rules were contrary to the laws of God. With characteristic self-confidence, Knox concluded by challenging those present to refute him. The congregation included Mair, his former teacher, and John Winram, the subprior of St Andrews, as well as many other canons and friars. As part of his own reforming programme, Winram then staged a disputation in St Leonard's College upon issues raised by Knox's sermon. During this inconclusive debate, Knox faced the inept Franciscan John Arbuckle. Winram's burgh reformation continued with further sermons at Holy Trinity, university and priory men preaching in turn on Sundays and Knox during the week. In a radical departure, communion was administered in a reformed manner. The limited reformation within the ecclesiastical capital was brought to an abrupt halt by the arrival in July of a French fleet which recaptured St Andrews Castle. For the remainder of his life Knox retained a deep respect for Winram, even though the subprior remained within the Catholic church right up to 1559.<h2>
<a name="Inthegalleys"></a>In the galleys</h2>After the castle's fall the captured nobles were imprisoned in French castles while Knox and the other commoners were sentenced to serve on the galleys. The nobles, turning to Knox as their spiritual adviser, consulted him about the morality of escaping. The French galleys passed the winter on the Loire before returning to Scotland in the summer of 1548 to fight against the English invasion. In his later <span class="italic">History of the Reformation in Scotland</span> Knox gave few personal details of his nineteen-month captivity. He concentrated instead on incidents illustrating how the Scots upheld their protestant faith, including his own story of throwing overboard a picture of the Virgin Mary he had been ordered to kiss, though he first prudently checked he was not observed. While in Scottish waters Knox became so sick that he was not expected to survive. When asked if he recognized the Tay estuary he answered that he could make out the steeple of St Andrews parish church where he had delivered his first sermon and confidently predicted that he would preach there again before he died.<br>
<br>Although in the galleys and sometimes in chains, Knox had sufficient freedom to receive and read the treatise on justification written by Henry Balnaves during his imprisonment in Rouen Castle. Having himself been much comforted by its message, he summarized its contents for the protestants in St Andrews. In this first surviving piece of writing Knox employed themes and language which were to become his trademark. He assured the brethren that when Satan appeared about to triumph, he would be defeated, and, though the battle would be fierce, Christ the captain would prevail. He culled a string of images and quotations from <span class="roman">Isaiah</span> to emphasize the punishment awaiting those who condemn the law of God. Reflecting his enduring fascination with the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, Knox retained these references but omitted many of Balnaves's <span class="roman">New Testament</span> ones. Throughout his life Knox viewed contemporary politics through the prism of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> and paralleled his own experiences with those of the prophets, especially Isaiah and Jeremiah. His language and thought revolved around biblical concepts and his writings were saturated with <span class="roman">Bible</span> phraseology and imagery. Supremely confident that he understood the overall sense and unity of the scriptures, he did not hesitate to run together disparate texts. For Knox the <span class="roman">Bible</span> was essentially a message to be preached and, though careful and at times meticulous in his exposition, he was not a textual scholar.<br>
<br>During this early period of his life Knox developed the virulent anti-Catholicism which became one of his hallmarks. He was strongly influenced by Wishart's Zwinglianism but had also readily adopted Balnaves's Lutheran emphasis on justification by faith alone. Knox's personal experience of a saving faith rooted in the scriptures underpinned his spirituality throughout his life. It also upheld his calling to be a preacher which, at first accepted with reluctance, dominated his subsequent career.<h2>
<a name="RefugeinEnglandbetrothal"></a>Refuge in England: betrothal</h2>Knox was released from the galleys in February 1549, probably owing to English intercession with the French. He travelled directly to England where he was awarded &pound;5 by the privy council and sent to Berwick as a preacher. This garrison town played a critical role in the Anglo-Scottish wars then in progress. As a result of this &#145;rough wooing&#146; the English borough served as a refuge for Anglophile Scots. Knox was thus reunited with some East Lothian friends and became part of the colony of &#145;assured&#146; Scots tolerated by their English allies. His ministry improved the behaviour of the town's soldiers, removing the worst feuding and violence and helping to promote peace and quietness. During his two years at Berwick, Knox collected a core of committed protestants around him, and for them he composed one of the most gentle and pastoral of his writings dealing with the different aspects of prayer, <span class="italic">A Confession and Declaration of Praiers</span>, published in 1553. Drawing on his own experiences, including his sufferings in the galleys, he assured his readers that, even when all hope appeared gone, God answered their prayers and saved his people.<br>
<br>With the support of the zealous within his congregation, Knox introduced more radical liturgical practices than those prescribed in the 1549 <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, with communicants receiving bread instead of the customary wafer and sitting rather than kneeling. Judging by a surviving fragment, Knox felt free to draw up his own order of service. He joined in a protestant campaign, led by Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, attacking the Roman Catholic mass. Whether to offer a platform for his views or to censure them and his liturgical nonconformity, Knox was summoned before the council of the north. At Newcastle on 4 April 1550 he faced his ecclesiastical superior, the conservative Cuthbert Tunstall, bishop of Durham, supported by a group of scholars. Although hinting he would rather debate, Knox presented a scholastic paper. The first syllogism stated:<blockquote>All wirshcipping, honoring or service inventit by the braine of man in the religion of God, without his own express commandment, is Idolatrie: The Masse is inventit be the braine of man, without any commandement of God: Thairfoir it is Idolatrie. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.34)</blockquote>At the same time Knox penned a brief and simple summary of the Lord's supper, outlining the main points of belief. It denied the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation, stating that the communion elements were received spiritually, though not elaborating upon this eucharistic theology. The definition of how religion should be practised, contained in the syllogism, became the <i>leitmotiv</i> of Knox's thought. Resting upon an <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> viewpoint, especially the injunctions in <span class="roman">Deuteronomy</span>, it focused on the negative and exclusive. It asserted that any action not possessing a direct commandment from God was idolatry, and conversely that only those actions with a specific scriptural warrant were to be included within divine worship. By forcing everything into one or other category&#151;idolatry or true worship&#151;Knox left no room for grey or uncertain areas or for &#145;things indifferent&#146; to be regulated by the church. The adherence to a rigid biblical model was treated as a universal and absolute rule applying everywhere and at all times.<br>
<br>While at Berwick, Knox had met the family of Robert Bowes, the captain of nearby Norham Castle. Bowes's wife, Elizabeth, already a protestant, had sought the preacher's aid during recurring spiritual crises. Finding him helpful and comforting she became a close friend and encouraged his courtship of her fifth daughter, Marjory (<i>d</i>. 1560). Although the rest of the family did not approve, Marjory became formally betrothed to Knox in 1553. In his dealings with his mother-in-law the preacher drew on a reservoir of patience not normally evident in his public life. With compassion and tenderness he guided Mrs Bowes's tentative steps along her doubt-ridden inner journey of faith. In his pastoral letters to her Knox felt able to express his own religious uncertainties and fears for the future, providing a vivid contrast to the brash and self-confident assertions of his polemical writings. In the spring of 1551 Knox moved to Newcastle where he met John Willock, a fellow preacher and a future leader of Scotland's Reformation. Although the peace treaties of 1550&#150;51 had ended the Anglo-Scottish wars, many Scots within England had gravitated towards Newcastle, forming a nucleus of fellow countrymen around Knox. As at Berwick, Knox concentrated his attention on the committed core of his congregation. He occupied the pulpit of St Nicholas, the town's principal church, preaching in the presence of Newcastle's &eacute;lite. In October 1551, on an inspection tour of the north, Knox had in his congregation the duke of Northumberland. The man who was governing England for young Edward VI was sufficiently impressed to extend his patronage to the preacher. By the end of 1551 Knox had moved to London to become a royal chaplain, receiving a salary of &pound;40 per annum, with a roving preaching commission including sermons before the king and court.<h2>
<a name="Royalchaplain"></a>Royal chaplain</h2>Preaching before Edward VI during the late summer of 1552 Knox attacked the practice of kneeling at communion as part of a radical campaign pushing for additional revisions to the draft 1552 <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. As a result the privy council had its printing halted while the views of the royal chaplains were considered. Furious that changes could even be contemplated after parliament had approved, Archbishop Cranmer labelled Knox and his radical allies &#145;unquiet spirits&#146; bent on upsetting good order. He singled out the proposition so dear to Knox, that what is not commanded in scripture is unlawful, stigmatizing it as a heretical Anabaptist error. Cranmer was prepared, however, to draft an additional rubric for the new liturgy, explaining that kneeling to receive communion did not imply adoration of the elements, as maintained by Roman Catholic doctrine. Printed on an inserted slip in black, rather than the normal red, it became known as the &#145;black rubric&#146;. This represented a concession, but it was not the resounding liturgical victory traditionally attributed to Knox.<br>
<br>While still complaining about kneeling, Knox and the other royal chaplains signed a statement, the forerunner of the forty-two articles, acknowledging that the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> agreed with scripture. News of his acceptance reached the north and provoked criticism from his former congregations. In a letter to Berwick, Knox explained he was not prepared to break the bonds of Christian charity nor the authorized, uniform order of the church over kneeling at communion, and he recommended conformity to the new prayer book. The long epistle was full of the troubles faced by the elect, warning them to hold fast to the gospel message and anathematizing any who taught otherwise.<br>
<br>The kneeling controversy suggested to Northumberland that employing Knox in the south against the Anabaptists would make it easier to establish liturgical uniformity in the north. He also decided that, if the preacher were appointed bishop of Rochester, he could be used to propel his episcopal neighbour, the archbishop of Canterbury, in a more radical direction. Still angry over kneeling and possibly anxious to avoid becoming a cat's paw of Northumberland, Knox declined a bishopric in the Edwardian church. Much later he gave the reason for his refusal as foreknowledge of the problems Mary's accession would bring. In the short term Knox's behaviour infuriated his patron, who thought him ungrateful and impossible to please. The preacher had not assisted his cause by openly questioning the duke's religious sincerity. Despite such provocation Northumberland still tried to get &#145;poor Knox&#146; settled, and in February 1553 Knox was offered one of the best livings in London&#151;All Hallows, Bread Street. Knox publicly refused the benefice before the privy council, in April, and launched a diatribe against the lack of discipline within the Edwardian church. In his last sermon before the king he pointedly preached about the danger of godly princes being surrounded by ungodly advisers, drawing specific <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> parallels with certain courtiers.<br>
<br>While based in London, Knox had been befriended by a group of merchants and their wives, such as Anne Locke and Mrs Hickman. As well as the more prosaic gifts of hospitality and financial support, they provided the firm backing of a small godly community within which Knox thrived. Throughout his ministry Knox was able to share his own spiritual heights and depths with the close female friends he made in the towns and cities where he worked. When apart, they became his regular and trusted correspondents to whom he readily disclosed his secret hopes and fears. By calling upon his pastoral expertise to unravel their doubts and difficulties, they brought him to a deeper understanding of his own faith and gave him the confidence to help others to overcome their spiritual tribulations. Knox's considerable pastoral gifts formed a counterpoint to his abrasive polemical style and help to explain the loyalty and affection he evoked among many of his parishioners.<br>
<br>Despite his outspoken criticisms of the regime, Knox remained a royal chaplain and in June 1553 was sent to preach in Buckinghamshire and Kent. He was thus absent from the capital when Edward VI died, on 6 July. After the Roman Catholic Mary had triumphantly claimed the English throne, he chose not to return to London to join his fellow royal chaplains at Edward's funeral. Although Mary's regime strongly encouraged the departure of all the foreign protestants, Knox did not immediately leave the country. He returned to the north in the final months of 1553 but was too well known to stay there long. He went into exile at the start of the new year.<h2>
<a name="Explainingdefeat"></a>Explaining defeat</h2>In England during the opening months of Mary's reign, Knox wrote private letters as well as his <span class="italic">Godly Letter</span> and <span class="italic">Comfortable Epistles</span> to his former congregations; the latter were published in Dieppe once he had reached safety. In common with other clerical exiles Knox felt the need to counter the accusation that he had deserted his flock. His main task in these writings was to comfort those who remained and to explain the dramatic reversal of protestant fortunes when political power and control over the English church had been lost. This was a straightforward matter for Knox, who during all his ministry had stressed the apocalyptic struggle against Antichrist's forces and the imminent arrival of the plagues God sent to punish sin. Though underscoring the justice of divine punishment, unlike his fellow exiles Knox did not dwell on the positive aspects of suffering for the faith. With his deep reliance on the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> he placed the covenant model at the centre of his message, especially in the <span class="italic">Godly Letter</span>, which contained an extended comparison between England and Judah with himself in the role of Jeremiah. This emphasized twin points to his readers: the need to avoid idolatry&#151;participating in Roman Catholic worship&#151;and the call for repentance, which involved a national return to covenant obedience. It was not only religious apostasy which offended him. Particularly in the <span class="italic">Faithful Admonition</span> (July 1554), Knox bemoaned the loss of English political independence through Mary Tudor's marriage to Philip of Spain. Characteristically, his grief expressed itself through a vitriolic denunciation of England's queen. Although he did not advocate direct resistance, he did pray for a second Jehu, to overthrow this English &#145;Jezebel&#146;.<br>
<br>Knox had become closely identified with his adoptive land and, as he confessed to his mother-in-law in his <span class="italic">Exposition upon the Sixth Psalm</span> (1554), he was more deeply affected by England's plight than Scotland's troubles. During his English stay he had held his first continuous ministerial charges, thereby developing his confidence as a pastor and familiarizing himself with preaching every week. Among the committed protestants in Berwick, Newcastle, and the south, many of them women, he had discovered the spiritual support on which he relied so heavily. This experience encouraged his perception of the church as a godly minority surrounded by the actively hostile and the half-committed. The fear that hypocrisy would corrupt the faith and compromise the gospel message was greatly increased by his association with high politics in 1552&#150;3. In common with most of the religious radicals, by the end of Edward's reign Knox had become deeply disillusioned. He thought the pace of religious change had been too slow and that protestantism had become tainted by its association with Northumberland's regime.<br>
<br>This pessimistic interpretation of events during Edward's and Mary's reigns became locked deep in Knox's mind. He believed he had witnessed in his own times a repetition of the troubled history of <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> Israel. Through its official acceptance of protestantism the English kingdom had entered God's covenant, but like the Israelites had refused full obedience to divine commands. Therefore, God had punished England by replacing its godly prince with an idolatrous female tyrant. Although the circumstances were different, after Scotland's Reformation Knox continued to be haunted by the fear that this pattern would repeat itself.<h2>
<a name="GermanyandSwitzerland"></a>Germany and Switzerland</h2>Knox's four-year exile from Marian England crystallized his ideas and he developed much of the radicalism traditionally regarded as the chief characteristic of his thinking. With more leisure to write, he composed the bulk of his polemical writings during this period. In the atypical and hothouse atmosphere of the exile congregations he refined and put into practice his liturgical and ecclesiological ideas. Through his new contacts, the perspectives gained from his visits to other protestant communities in France, Germany, and Switzerland, and his discussions with their leading reformers, he experienced the diversity of international protestantism. For the remainder of his life he remained in contact with his European friends and acquaintances and valued his membership of this broad religious brotherhood.<br>
<br>At the start of 1554 Knox travelled via Dieppe to Switzerland to visit Heinrich Bullinger in Z&uuml;rich and John Calvin in Geneva, seeking advice on the English situation. The questions he put to them provide an indication of the direction in which his ideas were already moving. They touched upon the political authority of a minor (Edward VI) and a woman (Queen Mary), as well as the thorny problem of obedience when idolatry was being enforced (the re-Catholicization of England). In view of the extreme sensitivity of these subjects, the reformers gave Knox equivocal answers. Having visited Dieppe in April, to collect news and to publish the tracts written while on the run in Marian England, he returned to Geneva the following August, hoping to settle in Calvin's reformed city.<br>
<br>At this point the English exile community in Frankfurt asked Knox to become one of their ministers. The magistrates there had provided a church, and it was hoped that as many exiles as possible would join the congregation. After pressure from Calvin, Knox accepted the Frankfurt invitation in November 1554. Once there he became embroiled in the debates about the liturgy to be followed by the English exile church. The congregation reached a provisional settlement in February 1555, but the following month its arrangements were disrupted by the arrival of a large contingent from Strasbourg. The next Sunday, Knox, upset by the flouting of the agreement, preached an inflammatory sermon criticizing the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. In his attack upon the failings of the Edwardian church he censured named individuals, some of whom were present. The congregation polarized. In what Knox was convinced was a conspiracy against him, the opposing faction laid information before the Frankfurt magistrates concerning his writings. The unflattering comparison of Charles V to Nero ensured that the city council, anxious to keep the emperor's good will, requested Knox to leave. After an emotional sermon and a tearful farewell to about fifty diehard supporters, Knox left on 26 March 1555 for Geneva.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoScotlandmarriage"></a>Return to Scotland: marriage</h2>Knox's personal affairs next occupied his attention. He planned to return secretly to Northumberland to marry and bring his bride and mother-in-law back to Switzerland. Having sailed to the Scottish east coast in the autumn of 1555, he travelled to Berwick to meet Marjory and Mrs Bowes and the wedding was probably celebrated in the spring of 1556. Although the sweet-natured Marjory remains a shadowy figure, especially by comparison with her mother, her affection and unstinting support were crucial to Knox during their married life and he was devastated when she died in December 1560. Marjory's own learning enabled her to shoulder most of her husband's secretarial tasks, in addition to her own domestic duties. The couple had two sons, Nathaniel and Eleazer, who after their mother's death were brought up in England by her kin and eventually sent to St John's College, Cambridge, where both became fellows.<br>
<br>In 1555&#150;6 Knox's original plans were altered by his reception in Scotland. During the autumn, winter, and spring he preached to the underground churches, moving around Edinburgh and the Lothians, north to Angus, and west to Ayrshire and Renfrewshire. Members of the Scottish nobility protected him from persecution by the ecclesiastical authorities. When faced with heresy proceedings, Knox was able to appear in Edinburgh on 15 May 1556 surrounded by so many supporters that the process was quietly dropped. He was caught off guard by the rapid progress the Scottish reform movement had made since 1549. He found a network of well-organized &#145;privy kirks&#146; with a growing body of sympathizers who viewed his arrival as an opportunity to acquire experienced clerical leadership. Knox found himself giving advice about acceptable religious behaviour for Christians &#145;under the cross&#146;. His sermon on <span class="roman">Matthew</span> 4, letters to his &#145;sisters&#146; in Edinburgh, and his <span class="italic">Answers to Some Questions Concerning Baptism</span> reflected these pastoral concerns. Knox told his hearers not to attend mass, which he uncompromisingly labelled idolatry. By attempting to persuade the regent, Mary of Guise, to adopt a policy of reform, his 1556 <span class="italic">Letter</span> expressed the movement's political aspirations. The report of her cool and insulting reception of the <span class="italic">Letter</span> probably encouraged Knox to leave Scotland. Even when the protestant fourth earl of Argyll, head of Clan Campbell, offered him complete protection, he could not be persuaded to remain. At this stage Knox was extremely reluctant to become the leader of the Scottish reform movement, and he sailed for France early in the summer of 1556.<h2>
<a name="YearsinGeneva"></a>Years in Geneva</h2>By September 1556 Knox had returned to Geneva, which he regarded as his exile home. Having finally triumphed over his opponents in 1555, Calvin had, in Knox's admiring testimonial, transformed the city into the &#145;maist perfyt schoole of Chryst &hellip; In other places I confesse Chryst to be trewlie preachit; but maneris and religioun so sinceirlie reformat, I have not yit sene in any uther place&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 4.240). The Scot treasured this visible lesson in the implementation of discipline which he tried to reproduce when he returned to his native land. While Knox had been away, the radical group from Frankfurt had obtained a church in Geneva and in November 1555 formally constituted themselves as a congregation, electing Christopher Goodman and Knox as their ministers. By the time he had returned to accept this call, the congregation had already published a full liturgy, <span class="italic">The Forme of Prayers</span>, and was becoming the largest and most important of the English exile communities. Although Knox's own contribution was slight, the exiles produced the Geneva <span class="roman">Bible</span>, a new translation later officially adopted in Scotland. This dynamic congregation also boasted an efficient ecclesiastical organization which maintained strict discipline. By preserving their internal harmony as well as their zealous commitment, they provided Knox with a working model of a perfect reformed congregation. Although subsequently he strove hard, Knox was unable to replicate this achievement within Scotland. In his rose-tinted memory the entire Genevan experience remained as a tantalizing ideal of complete and successful reformation.<br>
<br>Knox's sojourn in Geneva was probably the happiest period in his life. In the midst of the English exiles Knox felt secure and valued and his domestic contentment was increased by the arrival in 1556 of Marjory, his wife, and the births of their two sons in 1557 and 1558. The deep friendships Knox made in the city sustained him for the rest of his life. He grew particularly close to Goodman, his ministerial partner, with whom he could share all his troubles and debate and formulate his political and theological ideas. Together they served a congregation of like-minded and deeply committed protestants, who responded to Knox's prophetic preaching and pastoral encouragement. In return the exiles furnished the intimate spiritual support that Knox craved, continually strengthening his sense of vocation while permitting him the freedom to travel. Leaving his charge in Goodman's capable hands, Knox could respond to what he understood as God's will whenever and wherever it called him.<br>
<br>Having left Scotland in the summer of 1556 Knox was faced, as he had been two years before in the English context, with the charge of abandoning others to face persecution while himself going into a safe exile. From Dieppe in July 1556 he sent his <span class="italic">Letter of Wholesome Counsel to the Brethren in Scotland</span> and maintained a steady correspondence with his Edinburgh &#145;sisters&#146;. He reiterated his advice to stand firm and renounce the mass and gave practical guidance on conducting clandestine worship. The reform-minded nobles, anxious to sustain the political momentum achieved during Knox's visit, wrote to him in Geneva in March 1557 asking him to return. Loath to leave Geneva, Knox hesitated, torn between conflicting roles; eventually he left Switzerland in September, after Calvin had sharply reminded him of his duty to Scotland. In October, on his arrival in Dieppe, there was a letter from the Scottish lords asking him to wait. This provoked an angry reply from Knox, accusing the nobles of contaminating the religious cause with political opportunism. It was an unfair charge, reflecting Knox's ambivalence about his own role rather than the situation within Scotland.<h2>
<a name="PoliticalwritingsTheFirstBlast"></a>Political writings: The First Blast</h2>During winter 1557&#150;8 Knox used his enforced leisure in Dieppe to write. He composed his most famous tract, <span class="italic">The First Blast</span>, while by translating into English and amplifying an <span class="italic">Apology</span> addressed to the French king he also publicized the persecution faced by the Huguenots. Between January and March 1558, when he returned to Geneva, he travelled through France visiting the protestant towns of La Rochelle and Lyons. Once back in the Swiss city <span class="italic">The First Blast</span> was printed anonymously, but Knox's name was placed on his later Scottish titles, <span class="italic">The Letter to the Regent Augmented</span>, <span class="italic">The Appellation to the Scottish Nobility</span>, and <span class="italic">The Letter &hellip; to the Commonalty</span>. Together these 1558 tracts constitute Knox's major political writings.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women</span> is the best-known, and least understood, of Knox's writings. Instead of the stirring image of serried ranks of marching women, the title more prosaically refers to non-natural (monstrous) female rule (regiment). The thinking of the English exiles, especially those based in Geneva, had been radicalized in response to the burnings of protestants by the Marian regime which had begun in 1555. By 1558 a number of Knox's friends, most notably his partner Goodman, had written tracts advocating resistance to the queen, and <span class="italic">The First Blast</span> was part of this campaign. Knox's main proposition was stated in the opening sentence of the main text:<blockquote>To promote a Woman to beare rule, superioritie, dominion, or empire, above any Realme, Nation or Citie, is repugnant to Nature; contumelie to God, a thing most contrarious to His reveled will and approved ordinance; and finallie, it is the subversion of good Order, of all equitie and justice. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 4.373)</blockquote>In the sixteenth century the assertion that women should not wield political authority at any level was neither novel nor particularly controversial. Several aspects of Knox's book, however, caused a considerable stir when it was published and have maintained interest ever since. In characteristic manner Knox presented his case in stark black and white terms, permitting no middle ground, and establishing a single immutable law to provide a moral imperative for radical action. He declared it was the law of God and of nature that women must not rule. Most unusually, instead of relying exclusively on the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, Knox cited as wide a range of authorities as he could muster to support this claim. He could thus dismiss the normal loopholes permitting female rule based upon custom or specific law codes. For Knox this law of God was a springboard for action, for if a woman had by mistake or ignorance been permitted to rule, she should be deposed forthwith.<br>
<br>The timing of <span class="italic">The First Blast</span> added to the notoriety created by its style of argument and revolutionary conclusion. Its main target was Mary Tudor, the Roman Catholic queen of England, but on her death in November 1558 she was succeeded by her half-sister, Elizabeth, the great hope of English protestants. Scotland was also experiencing female rule with the regent, Mary of Guise, governing on behalf of her daughter, Mary, queen of Scots. The universalized nature of Knox's arguments ensured they were regarded as a direct attack upon each of these women. In one sense this was not what he had meant, as he later tried (unsuccessfully) to explain to both Elizabeth and Mary, queen of Scots. The predicament arose because of Knox's general tendency to get carried away by an idea in the heat of writing, without pausing to consider all its ramifications. As Calvin later noted, Knox's &#145;thoughtless arrogance&#146; in <span class="italic">The First Blast</span> had unfairly brought opprobrium upon Geneva  (Robinson, 2.35). The Scot firmly believed his central ideas were revelations to be communicated: the prophet must deliver the message he had received from God. Although <span class="italic">The First Blast</span> was conceived within this general framework, its non-religious arguments and sources of authority were distinctive. Knox's dependence upon syllogisms and scholastic proofs was a reaction to the worsening English situation. He broadened his arguments in a desperate attempt to convince Englishmen of all religious persuasions to depose their queen. By targeting Mary's gender, he chose an undeniable and unalterable characteristic of her reign. The result was a generalized attack on all female rule, presented as a logical argument.<br>
<br>Even within the book, the preacher struggled to hold his prophetic thunder under control, and towards the end he poured forth his denunciation of Mary's idolatrous reign. In his mind the queen's &#145;monstrous&#146; rule, which denied the constraints imposed by her gender, was inextricably linked to her religious policy of re-Catholicizing England and persecuting protestants. In the light of this link, Knox was puzzled by the book's adverse reception among fellow protestants, and he wrote sadly to Anne Locke that it &#145;hath blowne from me all my friends in England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 6.14). He was equally surprised when Queen Elizabeth did not accept that he had written primarily against her half-sister. He was willing to recognize her royal authority on condition Elizabeth rested her claim upon divine providence which could override the general law forbidding female rule. In 1561 he offered a similar type of recognition to Mary, queen of Scots. While Knox saw no inconsistency between <span class="italic">The First Blast</span> and these offers, others did.<h2>
<a name="Thepoliticsofreligion"></a>The politics of religion</h2>The centrality of his religious preoccupations and their impact on his political thinking were demonstrated in Knox's four propositions for his projected <span class="italic">Second Blast</span>, published in July 1558. They envisaged the &#145;election&#146; of a ruler according to divine ordinance and allowed for the deposition and punishment of a tyrant. However, these broad principles were only applicable to kingdoms already in a covenant relationship with God. At the time of writing they applied to England, which had publicly embraced protestantism in Edward's reign even though it had committed apostasy under Mary; they did not extend to either Scotland or France, which in 1558 remained under Roman Catholic rule.<br>
<br>Such a crucial distinction meant that Knox's advice in his 1558 tracts for his fellow Scots was different from that to Englishmen. Since his return to Geneva in 1556 his personal correspondence and Scottish publications had betrayed an underlying ambiguity. On the one hand he sought the recognition of protestantism by the authorities. On the other he was fearful that the religious cause would be contaminated by political motives. In 1556 he had hoped Mary of Guise could be persuaded to implement religious reform, but he was far less sanguine when he reissued his <span class="italic">Letter to the Regent</span> with substantial critical additions in 1558. It accompanied <span class="italic">The Appellation</span> and <span class="italic">A Letter &hellip; to the Commonalty</span>, addressed to the Scottish nobility and Commons respectively. In the first tract Knox produced his own version of a constitutionalist theory previously employed by the German Lutherans and later adopted by the Huguenots. He explained that, because the Scottish nobility were &#145;magistrates&#146; in their own right, receiving their power directly from God, they owed a duty to uphold the laws of God and protect true religion. Specifically Knox urged the nobles to introduce protestant worship within Scotland, even if that entailed defying the crown. On the basis of the spiritual equality of all men and women, the preacher also appealed to the common people, who possessed no political authority of their own. He argued that, because the word of God was essential for salvation, the people were entitled to demand that the scriptures be preached to them. These were radical proposals which, if implemented, would have led to far-reaching consequences, but the Scottish tracts were not straightforward calls for revolution.<br>
<br>Knox's attention remained fixed primarily upon the English situation. Just before Queen Mary's death in November 1558, the open letter addressed to his old congregations at Berwick and Newcastle indicated his deep awareness of the apocalyptic struggle being waged between the forces of Christ and Antichrist. He treated his former parishioners as soldiers in this great battle and collected a list of English martyrs, published a few months later. Having been so direct in <span class="italic">The First Blast</span> about the need to depose Mary, within this pastoral context Knox was reluctant to urge outright resistance on his correspondents; he dwelt instead on the fearful consequences of God's further punishments, reminding Berwick of the fall of Calais, its sister fortress town.<br>
<br>The situation was transformed by Elizabeth's accession on 17 November 1558. In the tract that Knox rushed out in January 1559, just before leaving Geneva, the Scotsman stressed how the English should welcome this great act of divine mercy. Like <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> Israel, God had given the kingdom the opportunity to renew its covenant and rebuild Jerusalem. In response England must re-establish true religion, which meant introducing only those practices authorized in the scriptures and exercising discipline throughout church and kingdom. The compromises and half-hearted uncertainties which Knox believed had condemned the Edwardian Reformation must be left behind.<h2>
<a name="Theimplicationsofpredestination"></a>The implications of predestination</h2>Knox wrote his longest work in Geneva, during the summer, autumn, and winter of 1558. When he returned home the manuscript was left in the city and guided through the press in 1560 by his friend William Whittingham. Concerning the difficult theological doctrine of predestination, <span class="italic">An Answer to a Great Nomber of Blasphemous Cavillations</span> was a refutation section by section of a piece by an anonymous English Anabaptist, probably Robert Cooche. The latter's tract, entitled <span class="italic">The Confutation of the Errors of the Careless by Necessity</span>, had attacked Calvin's explanation of the decrees of election and reprobation, asserting that the Swiss reformer depicted a cruel God ordaining the majority of mankind to condemnation, and a human existence devoid of choice or responsibility. Knox's rebuttal of it differs from his other writings in its length and its aim of elucidating a single doctrine. He retained his normal, destructive, polemical style, sharpened by a personal edge because, having been friends with his adversary, Knox now labelled him a blasphemer and liar. Employing an atypical device, he explicitly followed Calvin's doctrinal lead, employing long quotations from the reformer's writings on predestination. Disguised by his robust language, Knox's own discussion was sometimes tentative or, when dealing with the reprobation of the wicked, not entirely consistent. Although neither theologically original nor penetrating, the work was an impassioned defence of God's election to salvation of the invisible church. For Knox this represented the foundation of his own and every Christian's faith, humility, and obedience and the bedrock upon which he grounded his sermons.<br>
<br>In Knox's mind predestination was associated with the cosmic battle between the two armies, the church of God and the synagogue of Satan. Although predestination was essentially a message of salvation and consolation, Knox was acutely aware that identifying the elect was not a simple matter. The reprobate might themselves display signs of faith and sanctification for a time, making it impossible in this world to distinguish them from the elect. Knox pressed home the point that the visible church was bound to contain many such hypocrites. Throughout his life this proposition provided a constant spur for him to be tireless in his admonitory preaching, and in his final years it came to dominate his thinking. In countering the charge that predestination removed the need to preach repentance and salvation, he explained the purpose of his sermons:<blockquote>for to those that have by publicke profession receaved Christ Jesus, be they elect, or be they reprobate, do appertein exhortations, threatening, the doctrine of repentance, consolation prophecying and revelation of things to come; but to those that yet remaine manifest enemies of the trueth, apperteine onlie the common calling to embrace the trueth, with the threatning of destruction if they continue unfaithfull. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 5.270)</blockquote>Whatever the eternal consequences for the listeners, the warnings must be given: this conviction lay at the heart of Knox's own vocation as a preacher. The vehemence of his attack on the Anabaptist flowed from the serious threat he was seen to pose to the fundamentals of the faith Knox preached. Once the Scot had identified such an enemy he was not prepared to compromise, discuss, or debate, only to denounce.<br>
<br>In response to the persecution in Marian England, especially the burnings, Knox developed a ruthlessness and an increasingly radical edge to his thinking. In his writings he demonstrated his mastery of polemical invective, creating rolling denunciations filled with hyperbole and biblical imagery. Having identified the failings of the Edwardian church, which had brought such divine punishment upon the country, he concluded that compromise had been disastrous and a complete and rapid reformation was the only viable policy. In his future dealings with both British kingdoms he was driven by the fear that the Edwardian mistakes would be repeated. He therefore demanded total and complete adherence to what he deemed to be the ordinances of God for his people. He also became obsessed by the threat from those secret enemies who undermined the church, the hypocrites. By the time he left the continent, Knox had become more convinced than ever of the need to apply one fundamental principle:<blockquote>In religioun thair is na middis: either it is the religioun of God, and that in everie thing that is done it must have the assurance of his awn Word, and than is his Majestie trewlie honourit, or els it is the religioun of the Divill. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 4.232)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Scotlandreformed15591561"></a>Scotland reformed, 1559&#150;1561</h2>Having been refused permission to enter or travel through England because of <span class="italic">The First Blast</span>, Knox sailed to Leith, where he docked on 2 May 1559. He plunged straight into the middle of a Scottish crisis. To secure radical ecclesiastical reform, the protestant nobles had placed increasing pressure on the queen regent and Roman Catholic hierarchy. The ending of the 1559 provincial church council removed any hope of an accommodation, leaving a deep religious divide. Tension mounted when the regent outlawed the leading protestant preachers. At this point Knox travelled to Perth, and in St John's Church preached a provocative sermon, &#145;vehement against idolatrie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.321), which provoked an iconoclastic riot. It signalled the beginning of the armed confrontation between the regent and the protestant lords of the congregation. Knox was immediately drawn into the centre of the rebellion, spreading the iconoclasm to the north Fife ports, and the climax came in a sermon on 11 June in St Andrews. Knox made his most decisive contribution as a preacher who could inspire fiery and militant zeal, but he also acted as the congregation's secretary, helping to compose their manifestos and handling their correspondence. In the quest for English support he maintained a low profile so as not to arouse Queen Elizabeth's displeasure.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1559 Knox became minister at St Andrews, a leading protestant centre. He accompanied the troops as a chaplain, and after their dispiriting retreat from Edinburgh his rousing sermon at Stirling on 5 November helped to rally the army. During this struggle Knox composed a narrative to justify the protestant cause which became the basis for his <span class="italic">History of the Reformation in Scotland</span>, not published until 1587. In his tale he painted the queen mother as the arch-enemy supported by the Roman Catholic clergy, who were described as agents of Antichrist. The regent's death on 11 June 1560, which opened the way for the peace secured by the treaty of Edinburgh on 6 July, provoked some of the most unpleasant of Knox's asides, revealing the fear and hatred he felt for opponents, and above all for Mary of Guise.<br>
<br>The summer of 1560 was a time of great triumph for Knox, when his dream of Scotland openly embracing protestantism was realized. In August the Reformation Parliament accepted the Scottish confession of faith and abolished papal jurisdiction and the celebration of the sacraments according to Roman Catholic rites. The protestant leaders were intensely busy as they strove to create a new church for the whole realm. Although extremely important as a figurehead, Knox was none the less a member of a team which together produced the key documents and the organizational framework for the new kirk. The first <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span> and probably the confession of faith were the work of a committee of six men, all called John: Willock, Spottiswood, Winram, Row, Erskine of Dun, as well as Knox. Scotland's kirk adopted the Geneva <span class="roman">Bible</span> and that exile congregation's liturgy became the <span class="roman">Book of Common Order</span>. These founding texts of Scottish protestantism were closely associated with Knox and vigorously championed by him. However, they reflect a variety of sources and influences and cannot be treated as exclusively his work. Even when credited with sole authorship, Knox drew upon existing church practice for <span class="italic">Orders of Fasting</span> (1566) and <span class="italic">Excommunication</span> (1569).<br>
<br>During that momentous summer in 1560 Knox became minister at St Giles's in Edinburgh. He enjoyed being at the heart of political affairs as the leading preacher in the nation's capital. It was a conspicuous and, for such an outspoken man, potentially perilous position and he was twice forced to withdraw from the city. Nevertheless, at the centre of an efficient national and international information network, he exploited to the full his watching brief to keep the church informed of developments between meetings of the general assembly. His general letter of 8 October 1563, telling all protestants to gather in Edinburgh to support those arrested for disrupting the mass at Holyrood, led to his being accused before the privy council of treasonably assembling the queen's subjects. He was acquitted after a spirited defence and later received the assembly's endorsement, though not all protestants agreed with his firm and independent line. Knox could rally contingents of zealous supporters, but his brand of militant protestantism alienated as many as it attracted in his own congregation and the burgh at large. This left him nostalgic for his fellow Genevan exiles, and in 1566 made him reluctant to leave the godly warmth of his Ayrshire sympathizers when he withdrew from Edinburgh. In his ecclesiology it also encouraged the emphasis on the faithful remnant constantly suffering persecution, and downplayed the all-encompassing national church.<br>
<br>Edinburgh town council demonstrated its appreciation by providing Knox with a well-furnished manse. He moved, shortly before his death, into the comfortable and spacious Netherbow property, now John Knox House. With his exceptionally generous stipend, worth &pound;566 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., and with even some of his servants' wages being supplied from royal tax revenues, he was one of the best-paid clergymen in the land. From 1562 John Craig worked as his assistant and the burgh's second minister. His appointment made it easier for Knox to act as a general assembly commissioner to undertake visitations, such as his three-month inspection in 1562 of churches in the south-west. In the running of the national kirk Knox was employed in such specific roles as drafting articles, letters, and liturgical documents, and though he carried out some visitations he never became a superintendent. He was asked to open or close the assembly with prayers or a sermon but never served as moderator, which required the diplomatic skills of chairmanship which he manifestly lacked. Knox's strength did not lie in routine administration, as his colleagues well understood. By shouldering these burdens themselves they freed him to pursue his calling &#145;to instruct the ignorant, comfort the sorrowfull, confirme the weake, rebuke the proud, by tong and livelye voyce&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 6.229). In his role as a prophet of wrath and judgment Knox became increasingly detached from the work of consolidation and the local implementation of reform which preoccupied the kirk in its first decade of existence.<br>
<br>In between his other duties Knox continued to write polemical tracts, directing his fire at the Scottish Roman Catholics. While on his 1562 visitation he held a public disputation on the mass at Maybole with Quentin Kennedy, abbot of Crossraguel, and the debate was subsequently published. Knox was also persuaded in 1568, though the result was not published until 1572, to refute a tract which James Tyrie, a Scottish Jesuit, had written to his elder brother, David Tyrie of Drumkilbo, to persuade him to return to the Roman Catholic church. It sparked a controversy about the nature of the true church which continued to rage after Knox's death. A more combative opponent, and one whom Knox declined to answer in writing, was Ninian Winzet, the Roman Catholic master of the grammar school at Linlithgow. Winzet had enjoyed pointing out the inconsistencies between the reformed kirk's theology and its practice and had criticized all its leaders. As part of his attack upon Knox, Winzet had ridiculed the highly Anglicized Scots which the reformer employed in his writings and his speech. It scored a polemical point at the time but has perhaps been taken too seriously by subsequent generations. Although he had acquired a slight English accent during his travels, Knox had no intention of abandoning his native tongue. The pragmatic adoption by the kirk of an English liturgy, the <span class="roman">Book of Common Order</span>, and of the Geneva <span class="roman">Bible</span>, a translation into English, had a far greater effect upon language within Scotland than either Knox's writings or his oratory.<h2>
<a name="RelationswithMaryqueenofScots"></a>Relations with Mary, queen of Scots</h2>The return to Scotland from France of Mary, queen of Scots, on 19 August 1561, transformed the reformer's political position and his outlook. On her first night in her native country Knox led a delegation to Holyrood Palace to sing psalms as a pointed reminder of Scotland's religious allegiance. The preacher feared the presence of a Roman Catholic queen in the country and was implacably opposed to the concession granted by the protestant nobles that she could hear mass in private. He supported those who unsuccessfully stormed the Royal Chapel to disrupt the queen's mass on 24 August, the first Sunday. With his fondness for startling hyperbole, Knox had asserted, &#145;That one Messe &hellip; was more fearful to him then gif ten thousand armed enemyes war landed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.276). As he let slip in a letter in October 1561 to his dear friend Anne Locke, he had even considered the extreme option of summoning the godly to arms. Such an unyielding approach brought conflict with his former allies, the protestant leaders of the congregation who were now the queen's closest advisers. With the focus firmly on the queen and the royal court, Knox found himself marginalized. This revived his deep-seated distrust of court politics as a mixture of sycophancy and the unprincipled pursuit of power, which had been formed in Edwardian England. Believing Scotland was engaged in a war against Antichrist, Knox was convinced that any compromise with Roman Catholicism would be disastrous because, as he warned in October 1561, &#145;by permission Satan groweth bold&#146;  (ibid., 6.131).<br>
<br>Despite the myth so firmly embedded in the Knoxian legend of a titanic struggle between the Roman Catholic queen and the protestant preacher, Knox's direct contacts with Mary were limited. His own <span class="italic">History</span> provides the main source for the four royal interviews, with their magnificent drama and memorable lines. Written in the bleak period of 1566, the narrative for 1561&#150;4 was spiced throughout with his biting assessments of royal policy and motives. Drawing on his English experience, Knox assumed that all Roman Catholic queens were Jezebels intent upon introducing idolatry and persecuting God's prophets and people. There was the additional danger, in his eyes, of a royal marriage bringing a Roman Catholic prince to rule in Scotland, as Philip II had in Mary Tudor's England. The reformer always viewed Mary Stewart as an enemy and believed that Scotland could not be safe while a Roman Catholic ruled. When the queen failed to act in &#145;character&#146;, he explained away her friendly or conciliatory gestures as &#145;craft&#146; or &#145;deceit&#146;.<br>
<br>The first interview took place at the start of September 1561, a few weeks after Mary's return. While defending his <span class="italic">First Blast</span>, Knox conceded that he accepted the queen's authority, though with his accustomed tactlessness he employed as an illustration St Paul living under the emperor Nero. When pressed by the queen on the wider issue of obedience, Knox endorsed the right of subjects to resist their rulers. The pair then sparred over the interpretation of the scriptures and how the true church could be recognized. Knox bluntly informed Mary that the Roman Catholic church was Antichristian and that the <span class="roman">Bible</span> contained self-evident truth. Yet, despite their lack of agreement on any topic, at the end of the interview Knox wished Mary well, even suggesting she might become a second Deborah. Though there was again no meeting of minds, the subsequent two interviews in December 1562 and April 1563 also ended on civil terms. In summer 1563 Mary and Knox were able to work together amicably to delay marital breakdown between the earl and countess of Argyll. However, fearful that it was a trap to lure him into preaching less critical sermons, Knox refused Mary's request to become her personal spiritual adviser at court.<br>
<br>The final interview in June 1563 was the most stormy, provoked by a sermon in which Knox had denounced a foreign, Roman Catholic marriage. Aware of the secret negotiations underway for a Spanish alliance, he explicitly cautioned the nobility that they banished Christ from the realm once they accepted an &#145;infidel&#146; to rule the kingdom. When the queen demanded what Knox had to do with her marriage and what role he had in the kingdom, he produced the famous reply &#145;A subject borne within the same &hellip; Madam. And albeit I neather be Erle, Lord, nor Barroun within it, yitt hes God maid me &hellip; a profitable member within the same&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.388). Justifying his harshness he explained that his duty as a preacher was to forewarn of dangers in blunt terms. In response to Mary's angry tears he clumsily assured her that he did not enjoy seeing her weep, but could not avoid speaking God's truth.<br>
<br>His sermons in St Giles's, which had lost none of their passion and charisma, enabled Knox to maintain a running commentary on political events during 1561&#150;5. He constantly called for repentance for the public sins which he believed were disfiguring Scotland. These were headed by the idolatry of the queen's mass, which was polluting the entire realm, and any association with the Roman Catholic powers of Europe, especially Mary's uncles of Guise, who were fighting the French protestants. To Knox's stern eye, vice and hypocrisy sprang from the frivolity and flattery of the royal court and its politics. These constant attacks alienated many protestant nobles whose participation in Mary's government and unwillingness to follow his political direction were denounced by Knox as a lack of religious zeal. Writing his <span class="italic">History</span> in 1566 with the certainty of hindsight, he accused the courtiers of betraying the gospel; they &#145;declyned from the puritie of Goddis word and began to follow the warld; and so againe to schaik handis with the Devill, and with idolatrie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.265). The most dramatic breach came after a bitter argument with Lord James Stewart, earl of Moray, when the two close friends refused to speak to each other for eighteen months. Knox's harsh condemnation of the politicians stands in contrast to his more generous understanding of the motives and actions of his clerical colleagues. He did not openly criticize those, such as John Winram or John Row, who had remained within the Roman Catholic church until the Reformation crisis before transferring to leading positions within the protestant kirk. Similarly, John Erskine of Dun's friendly and conciliatory attitude towards the queen did not provoke a censorious blast.<h2>
<a name="UpholdingGodscovenant"></a>Upholding God's covenant</h2>Although policy differences divided the protestant party at all levels, in his <span class="italic">History</span> Knox presented this as a split between the kirk and the courtiers. At the general assembly of June 1564 the divide was revealed in a debate between Knox and the queen's secretary, William Maitland of Lethington, over Mary's mass. The argument broadened to the question of the legitimacy of resistance to political authority and provoked Knox's clearest and most radical statements on that subject. Within a covenanted nation, such as Scotland, he maintained that the common people possessed a right to resist based upon the universal religious obligation to punish idolatry or other breaches of divine law. Knox considered that upholding the ten commandments was a public and political duty, not solely a personal, moral goal. The kingdom's willingness to punish those who broke divine law was the litmus test of its commitment to the covenant. This &#145;suppressing of vice &hellip; [and] abolishing of all suche thingis as myght nureise impietie within the Realme&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.264) was the national dimension of the ecclesiastical discipline enforced by the kirk. Since the queen's return Knox had increasingly focused upon this aspect of the covenant relationship. He had become convinced that Scotland was failing this test and called with increasing stridency for a change of heart. Such a rejection of its covenant obligation would bring the terrible plagues of divine displeasure. With a frightening sense of <i>dej&agrave; vu</i> Knox identified within Scotland the same lack of discipline in church and kingdom which had caused the downfall of Edwardian England.<br>
<br>In March 1564 Knox married his second wife, Margaret (1546/7&#150;<i>c</i>.1612), the seventeen-year-old daughter of Andrew Stewart, second Lord Ochiltree, a trusted friend and long-time supporter. With Knox aged fifty, the age gap was noted, though such discrepancies were common in second marriages. What excited greater interest, particularly from the queen, was his wife's distant royal connections because she was &#145;of the bludde and the name&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 6.533). The marriage was a happy one, with his &#145;yokefellow&#146; acting as secretary and nurse and comforter when he was ill. They had three daughters, Martha, Margaret, and Elizabeth, all of whom survived into adulthood, and the younger two themselves married ministers of the kirk.<br>
<br>Domestic happiness was unable to dispel Knox's growing sense of unease and powerlessness during Mary's personal reign. Having broken with many of the protestant nobles and deliberately rejected any close advisory role at the royal court, he concentrated upon his prophetic admonitions. From his earliest writings Knox had constructed a world of moral absolutes and imperatives which he had deduced from his interpretation of the scriptures. As he had explained to his friend John Foxe, &#145;to me it is yneugh to say that black is not whit, and man's tyrannye and foolishnes is not Goddes perfite ordinance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 5.5). He now found himself trapped within these constraints. The arrival of a Roman Catholic queen in Scotland had triggered his warnings about another Jezebel. Mesmerized by the fear that Scotland was reneging on its covenant commitments, he relied on the lessons he believed he had learned from the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> prophets and the downfall of Edwardian England. They dictated that any compromise with Roman Catholicism was anathema and only total commitment to the moral discipline of the nation and unwavering zeal for the protestant cause would avert disaster. Mindful of his earlier shortcomings as one of the Edwardian preachers sent by God to be the salt of the earth, he was determined that this time he would redouble his warnings and in Scotland not hold &#145;backe the salt where manifest corrupcion dyd appere&#146;  (ibid., 3.270).<h2>
<a name="CallingScotlandtorepentance"></a>Calling Scotland to repentance</h2>Knox's prophecies appeared to be coming to pass in the crisis over Mary's marriage to Darnley. His belief that many of the protestant nobility had abandoned their religious commitment encouraged him to rely on spiritual remedies rather than political resistance. Although convinced that the marriage posed a threat to protestantism, Knox did not join Moray and Argyll in open rebellion against the queen. Instead he used the pulpit to warn about the dangers facing kirk and nation. Darnley was present in St Giles's on Sunday 19 August to hear Knox's sermon on <span class="roman">Isaiah</span> 26: 13&#150;21. Mary's new consort was offended by the pointed references to Ahab not restraining the idolatry of his wife Jezebel and to God punishing his people by allowing them to be ruled by children and women. Knox was summoned to court and forbidden to preach as long as the royal couple remained in Edinburgh. Although the burgh council protested, Knox's preaching was probably restricted. Contrary to his usual practice, he wrote down and later published the offending oration, providing his only entire sermon text to survive. It encapsulated all the major concerns of this stage of his career.<br>
<br>Knox began by explaining that rulers had two tasks, to know God's will as revealed in his word and to implement his laws. With Scotland exhibiting the same disobedience as Israel had in <span class="roman">Isaiah's</span> time, similar disasters would surely follow. The country faced many enemies: open opponents, like the &#145;infidel&#146; Ottoman Turks and the &#145;idolatrous&#146; Catholics, and the more dangerous hidden foes&#151;the hypocrites and those who had turned their backs on God and his laws. Knox warned that the &#145;day of temptation&#146; was approaching fast. The godly would heed his warnings and demonstrate their obedience to God by humbling themselves, whereas the hypocrites would remain proud and scoff at God's prophets. The preacher reassured the faithful remnant that God would preserve them during persecution and, as the history of the church had demonstrated throughout the ages, in the long term they would triumph. It was a deeply pessimistic sermon reminiscent of Knox's sentiments a decade earlier during the burnings of the Marian martyrs, though the situations were not alike. Despite the militant language of fighting under the banner of Christ against the forces of Satan, this was not a call to arms. In a marked change from 1559&#150;60 Knox now advocated the spiritual weapons of prayer and humility and a reliance upon faith and hope, rather than armed confrontation.<br>
<br>During the autumn and winter of 1565 Knox left Edinburgh, and was probably travelling through the borders fulfilling the general assembly's commission to visit those areas without a superintendent. Having witnessed the queen's defeat of the rebellion known as the Chaseabout raid, and her espousal of policies favourable to Roman Catholicism, Knox was profoundly gloomy, assuming that Mary was implementing the Scottish section of a Roman Catholic conspiracy against European protestantism. In late 1565 rumours circulated that the French and Spanish monarchs had agreed at Bayonne to a crusade against the protestants. Mary, queen of Scots, was thought to be part of this league, backed by the pope and authorized by the Council of Trent. Knox even passed on details of a supposed Tridentine decree calling for the extermination of all protestants.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Order of a General Fast</span>, commissioned by the general assembly in December 1565, reflected Knox's preoccupations during these difficult months. Before the liturgy of the fast, a long doctrinal introduction explained its purpose. Parallel to <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> Israel, Scotland was a covenanted nation bound to uphold divine law against the threats of idolatry and social injustice. The fragility and vulnerability of the Reformation were emphasized and the dangers of lukewarm protestant commitment highlighted. A general public fast provided the ideal opportunity to demonstrate true repentance, thereby averting God's punishment of his people. The fast was a call for national repentance and the means by which the godly could demonstrate their obedience. It combined the two different concepts of the church, the comprehensive organization encompassing the covenanted nation with the persecuted faithful remnant.<br>
<br>The general assembly also asked Knox to compose a pastoral letter exhorting all ministers to remain in their charges despite arrears in their pay. It emphasized that a minister's vocation could not be abandoned in the face of difficulty or privation. Ironically, shortly afterwards Knox departed from his Edinburgh charge. Whether or not he had prior knowledge of the conspiracy, the preacher approved of David Riccio's murder on 9 March 1566, which he categorized as the slaying of an idolater whose influence upon the queen had been malign. However, in Knox's prayer written three days after the murder the dominant emotion was despair, not joy, as he begged God to release him from the miseries of the world. When Mary returned to the capital on 17 March, intent upon punishing the assassins, Knox departed. In a deeply depressed mood he withdrew to his friends and close personal supporters in Ayrshire, where he quietly spent the following months revising and extending his <span class="italic">History</span> to include the period 1561&#150;4.<h2>
<a name="Civilconflict15661570"></a>Civil conflict, 1566&#150;1570</h2>Knox's spirits were lifted by the birth of a daughter and the comfort provided by his fervent adherents in the south-west. Relieved to be outside the political and religious mainstream, by the autumn of 1566 he had agreed to act as Ayr's minister, though those in Edinburgh wanted him to resume his charge. He also welcomed the suggestion by his close friend Goodman that they resume their partnership, this time in a mission within Ireland. Although nothing came of this proposal, in December 1566 Knox obtained leave from the general assembly to visit his sons, who were living with the Bowes family in co. Durham. During his English trip he may have visited London to see members of his old Genevan congregation and to deliver the general assembly's letter concerning the controversy over vestments. He encouraged Goodman to write a pamphlet against wearing vestments and was in close touch with other radical English protestants who sought his advice on whether to secede by rejecting the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. Despite his trenchant criticisms of this liturgy, he counselled them to be patient and not separate themselves from the Church of England. Owing to his English travels Knox missed the upheavals of February&#150;July 1567&#151;Darnley's murder, Mary's marriage to Bothwell, the couple's defeat at Carberry, and the queen's imprisonment at Lochleven. For eighteen months he had withdrawn from public life into semi-retirement, his depression and quietism possibly linked to a bout of ill health.<br>
<br>By the end of June 1567 Knox had returned to Edinburgh, immediately making known his views on Mary's fate. In a sermon on 19 July he went so far as to demand her execution as an adulteress and murderess, presenting this as a test case of covenant obedience to demonstrate that, within Scotland, breaking the ten commandments would be punished, irrespective of rank. To the preacher it was a final chance for the Scots to prove their loyalty to the covenant. He therefore dismissed Mary's abdication as a half-hearted compromise which would store up future trouble. Ten days later in his sermon at James VI's coronation he struck a more optimistic note, comparing the new reign to that of Joash, the young <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> king. Moray became regent for the baby James and set about re-establishing the kirk on a firmer financial and constitutional footing, a cause dear to Knox's heart. To bolster these efforts, in December, Knox preached a rousing sermon at the opening of a parliament which re-enacted the 1560 Reformation legislation. Having buried his old quarrels with Moray, the preacher decided not to publish his <span class="italic">History</span>, which had documented them in bitter detail. Though advising the regent, Knox was reluctant to return to the heart of political affairs and seems instead to have contemplated retirement. In February 1568 he made the remarkable suggestion that he would like to serve again his former Genevan congregation, probably based in London, though it is difficult to imagine how he would have fitted into the Elizabethan church. During the next few years there was a marked deterioration in his health and he became increasingly melancholy, failing to write regularly to his friends and, when he did so, speaking of his imminent and longed-for death.<br>
<br>During summer 1568 Knox finished the first draft of his tract against James Tyrie. The debate gave him an opportunity to mount a spirited defence of the Scottish kirk. It was his most positive description of the achievements of the Reformation, resting upon an affirmation of a visible church coterminous with the kingdom. Knox asserted that, by publicly rejecting the Roman Antichrist of the papacy and by adopting the laws of God, the Scottish realm had affirmed its covenant relationship. It had thereby entered the same league made by Christ with the apostles, establishing a true apostolic succession for the church, not the historical continuity claimed by the Roman Catholics. On the awkward charge of doctrinal diversity among protestant churches, Knox blithely stated that there was European agreement on the principles of the faith, and within Scotland no controversy at all because the preachers agreed over doctrine. In contrast to this triumphalist note, the appendix which Knox added in 1572 was introspective and gloomy. It reflected his sense of being part of a persecuted minority rather than a leader of a vibrant national church. Stung by accusations of impropriety, Knox also appended a letter of 20 July 1554 to Elizabeth Bowes demonstrating that his relationship with his mother-in-law was entirely pastoral.<br>
<br>During a period of great upheaval in Scotland, Knox was unusually quiescent, taking no active part in the dramas which ended the queen's personal rule. Initially he seemed to have withdrawn to concentrate on writing, but after Mary's fall he returned somewhat reluctantly to Edinburgh. Although neither willing nor able to act once more as a revolutionary leader, he did resume an interest in political and ecclesiastical matters during Moray's regency. His declining health probably exacerbated a general feeling of disillusionment and a desire to finish his ministerial career.<br>
<br>Moray's assassination by James Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh on 23 January 1570 was an immense blow to Knox, arousing in him a vehement and abiding hatred for all Hamiltons. Conscious of echoes of the godly Edward VI's early demise, he interpreted the regent's death as a mark of divine displeasure. God's people had once more failed to appreciate his gifts, which Knox listed: Scotland had first been delivered from French tyranny, then from Roman Catholic idolatry, and finally from the rule of &#145;that wretched Woman, the mother of all mischief&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 6.569). Moray, in whom Christ's image had shone, had rescued the realm from disaster only to be murdered by the devil and his wicked servants. At the funeral on 14 February, Knox preached on the text &#145;Blessed are they that die in the Lord&#146;, reducing the congregation of 3000 to tears with his eulogy for the &#145;good regent&#146;.<br>
<br>In the last two years of his own life Knox grew increasingly bitter and isolated, feeling encircled by enemies and with the work of reformation seemingly in tatters around him. In October 1570 he suffered a slight stroke which weakened both his voice and his body. He saved his strength for the weekly sermon in St Giles's, which became the chief outlet for his views upon current affairs. With Scotland embroiled in civil war between Queen Mary's supporters and those of King James, in his customary way Knox reduced the struggle to polar opposites. By treating it as a religious conflict, he turned the queen's party into Satan's agents and castigated its protestant members as backsliders from their faith. In December 1570 he launched a particularly vitriolic attack on his previous ally, William Kirkcaldy of Grange, who held Edinburgh Castle for Mary. When Grange complained of Knox's slander to the city's kirk session a feud began between the two men. Relying on the generalized right of a minister to admonish sinners, Knox continued to use the pulpit to fight his case. His Ayrshire friends joined the dispute by writing a threatening letter to Grange defending Knox as &#145;the first planter and chief waterer of the Kirk amonges us&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 6.585). Within the Edinburgh congregation support was less wholehearted for the minister's outspoken stance, which served instead to deepen the existing divide between the political factions.<br>
<br>Rumours and propaganda leaflets circulated in the capital accusing Knox of undermining all political authority, of inconsistency in attacking female rule in <span class="italic">The First Blast</span> but then approving Queen Elizabeth, and more generally of being too good a friend to England at Scotland's expense. The preacher defended himself vigorously and urged the general assembly, to which some specific accusations had been addressed, to vindicate him. But although it supported him, the assembly did not provide the ringing endorsement which Richard Bannatyne, Knox's secretary, demanded. When clerical friends privately suggested he moderate his criticisms, Knox remained unrepentant, declaring, &#145;The kirk may forbid me preiching, but to stop my toung being in the pulpit it may not&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 6.590). Such an impassioned defence of his prophetic vocation was an indication of how Knox's world had contracted to the arena of his sermons.<h2>
<a name="Lastsermonsanddeath15711572"></a>Last sermons and death, 1571&#150;1572</h2>Knox's continued denunciation of the queen's party, especially the hated Hamiltons, made Edinburgh unsafe when it occupied the burgh in May 1571. Persuaded that his presence posed a threat to his supporters, Knox left for St Andrews. Writing to his Edinburgh congregation he likened himself to the prophet Jeremiah, reminding them that continued persecution was one of the signs of election. Lodged within the priory, Knox found a more conducive atmosphere in St Andrews, especially when surrounded by the admiring students of St Leonard's College, who lionized him. His health had deteriorated to such an extent that walking unaided was difficult and he could not travel to the general assembly. Though requiring to be helped into the pulpit, as his sermons progressed he came alive, vigorously beating the pulpit and causing his hearers to quake with fear at his warnings.<br>
<br>Knox's sermons expounded <span class="roman">Daniel</span> and were packed with topical allusions, especially attacks upon the occupiers of Edinburgh Castle, William Maitland of Lethington, and the Hamiltons. They offended Robert Hamilton, minister of St Andrews, who challenged Knox's condemnations. In reply the St Leonard's students staged a play depicting the castle's fall, which Knox had foretold and had yet to happen. It became a focus for the existing rivalry between St Leonard's and St Salvator's colleges, leading to bitter feuding within the university. Knox, entangled in this dispute, wrote in August 1572 to the general assembly solemnly warning the kirk against the bondage of the universities. Now deeply suspicious of anyone who opposed him, he became embroiled in further rows with John Rutherford, principal of St Salvator's College, and with John Douglas, the newly appointed archbishop of St Andrews. By now, even in St Andrews, Knox felt opponents were fighting him at every turn.<br>
<br>The news of the St Bartholomew's eve massacre of the Huguenots in August 1572 increased Knox's sense of being encircled by the enemies of true religion. His warm affection for, and continued contacts with, French protestants made it a particularly bitter blow which signalled worse disaster to come. With Edinburgh now safe, Knox accepted an invitation to return. Defending at all costs his calling to be a watchman, he made it a condition that his preaching should not be restricted. He continued his attacks upon those inside Edinburgh Castle, including a denunciation of William Maitland as an atheist. When he resumed preaching in St Giles's on 31 August his voice was so weak he was henceforth moved to the smaller Tolbooth section of the building. With grim determination he continued until his final sermon on 9 November 1572, delivered at the admission of James Lawson, his replacement. Afterwards he was too sick to leave his house, being afflicted with a violent cough which heralded the onset of bronchopneumonia. In his last fortnight he was visited by many of his supporters. Attended by his wife and friends, he died at 11 p.m. on 24 November. Two days later he was buried in the churchyard of St Giles's, at a funeral attended by many nobles, including the fourth earl of Morton. The newly appointed regent made his famous tribute, &#145;Here lyeth a man who in his life never feared the face of man; who hath beene often threatned with dagge and dagger, but yet hath ended his dayes in peace and honour&#146;  (Calderwood, 2.242).<br>
<br>Knox had made his will six months earlier, leaving his wife and daughters as executors, and it was proved at the commissary court on 13 January 1573. In addition to the usual testament noting his debts and making his bequests, he penned a &#145;legacy&#146;, a justification of his life and vocation addressed to the faithful, the papists, and the unthankful world. It rehearsed the prominent themes of his final years: the persecution and threat of martyrdom which he and the faithful remnant of the kirk had suffered; and the failure to heed his admonitions of punishment to come, especially the destruction of Edinburgh Castle. Knox defended his vocation, asserting that by preaching the death of Christ he had striven to beat down the pride of the proud and encourage the faithful, without seeking financial reward or being tainted by corruption. Sensitive to the criticisms of partiality, he declared he had never gone beyond the scriptures in his references to contemporary events. Finally, he called for the faithful to be constant, even in the midst of troubles, and they would find that God protected them as he had Knox.<br>
<br>Knox firmly believed that, like Ezekiel, he had been called to act as a watchman of the Lord forever crying warnings of the enemy's approach. In his declining years he had withdrawn into this watchtower mentality and identified as enemies all those who failed to share his views. Chronically ill and embittered, he clung to the idea of the church as a persecuted minority who, like the exiled Jews, would be vindicated in the end. While this biblical parallelism had fitted with his earlier experience of Marian exile and persecution, it seemed less appropriate for a period when the Scottish kirk was putting down its roots and the kingdom was ruled by protestant regents on behalf of a young protestant king. Knox's &#145;legacy&#146; formed a sad and defensive conclusion to his life, assessing the present in negative terms and full of fear for the future. It displayed little appreciation of his own vital contribution to the mighty achievement of planting a protestant kirk in his native land.<h2>
<a name="ImagesofKnox"></a>Images of Knox</h2>A proper likeness of Knox has always been difficult to construct. No contemporary portrait survives, though a verbal sketch was penned by his friend Sir Peter Young in 1579 indicating that Knox was short and stocky with broad shoulders. His dark blue eyes were set deep in their sockets under prominent eyebrows, and his narrow forehead was surrounded by black hair while a thick beard flecked with grey fell to his chest. Within his oval face, his long nose contrasted with a full mouth and large lips highlighted by his swarthy complexion. His normally grave countenance gave him an air of authority, but when angry his frown was deep and could be fearsome. By contrast the lineaments of Knox's personality have been less easy to draw. They have been dominated by his public role which has obscured the brief glimpses of the private individual also present in his writings. For Knox his calling as a preacher completely defined his life. His constant striving to live up to the responsibilities of his prophetic vocation allowed him no relaxation from his duty to act as the &#145;watchman of the Lord&#146;. Once in the pulpit he believed he was no longer master of himself, but became instead the mouthpiece of the Holy Spirit. He was proud of this calling and jealously defended his right to preach, sure that he was defending God's honour and not his own. In a revealing aside he defined humility not as a lack of pride but as a consciousness of sin, and in that sense he knew himself to be a humble man.<br>
<br>The stern preacher who thundered God's warnings with complete conviction frightened many of his hearers, causing some to tremble with fear. In tracts and sermons he confronted his audiences with a stark black and white world in which the choice between good and evil was plain with little excuse for following the wrong way. There was no distinction in Knox's mind between the doctrinal certainties found within his biblical texts and their direct &#145;application&#146; to the contemporary situation. He viewed his political commentaries as a necessary and natural consequence of his vocation. Since his Edwardian days, Knox had feared the contaminating influence of court politics. He therefore elevated direct speaking into a distinct virtue, condemning the use of tact or diplomacy as obsequious flattery or shoddy political compromise. As with all successful myths, the image of Knox as the harsh, ranting cleric has its element of truth, though it does scant justice to the charismatic preacher whose sermons could be more rousing than 500 trumpets sounding together.<br>
<br>Convinced he understood the &#145;sense&#146; of scripture and that the meaning of the word was self-evident to all who sought it, Knox found it extremely difficult to accept alternative interpretations. On the few occasions he recognized the need to apologize he did so clumsily, which sometimes made matters worse. This general inflexibility was linked to an absolute confidence in identifying the &#145;enemies of the evangel&#146;. His &#145;holy&#146; hatred for such people allowed him to dismiss out of hand any good points they might possess. In the final years of his life, Knox's attitude towards opposition from any quarter verged on paranoia. With his failing health, he became bitter and pessimistic about the future of protestantism, viewing death as a release from the onerous burden of his public duty.<br>
<br>Although certain of the righteousness of his cause, in private Knox could be assailed by doubt, lapsing into depression which would produce bouts of anger and frustration or withdrawal and relative passivity. During such periods he leaned even more heavily upon the support provided by his wives and an intimate circle of his spiritual sisters and brothers. In the glimpses afforded by his correspondence of these personal relationships a different Knox emerges. As a pastor he could be sympathetic, even tender, and extremely patient with the spiritual dilemmas facing his flock. In such contexts he was willing to moderate and adapt to the practical circumstances the moral imperatives that his pulpit rhetoric had declared were inflexible. Secure within the company of the godly, especially during his Geneva days, the gentler side of Knox flourished. This aspect of his personality helped to inspire the deep loyalty and affection so evident among his friends and supporters within his various congregations.<br>
<br>Although his writings were infused by <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> concepts and language, on his own admission Knox's spirituality began and ended with <span class="roman">John</span> 17. He found in this, the chapter of the fourth gospel containing Christ's prayer for his disciples before his betrayal, both a personal assurance of salvation and a complete world view. Knox's general apocalyptical perspective and an understanding of his vocation rested on the sharp distinction between Christ and the world running through the first sections of the chapter. In the remainder of the chapter Christ's celebration of being one with his followers, through which they are brought into the unity of the Father and the Son, underpinned Knox's ecclesiology, his predestinarianism, and his own faith. These key themes of covenant and apocalypticism, predestination and ecclesiology which Knox found entwined in <span class="roman">John</span> 17 provide the crucial link between the public and private aspects of his personality.<h2>
<a name="Knoxinnationalmemory"></a>Knox in national memory</h2>Almost immediately after Knox's death his supporters and detractors began the dispute which has continued ever since concerning his legacy and character. In 1573 John Davidson, a fervent admirer, published two poems which eulogized those aspects of his life which Knox had emphasized during his final years. Described as a model of uprightness, he was portrayed as a servant of God who, hated and persecuted by the world, had not flinched from his duty to rebuke sinners and defy tyrants. Accounts of Knox's last illness by his secretary Richard Bannatyne, and by his successor James Lawson, were published to demonstrate his &#145;godly death&#146;, thus vindicating his memory against Roman Catholic attacks.<br>
<br>The first publication in 1587 of Knox's <span class="italic">History</span> took place in London, where Andrew Melville and other Scottish presbyterians were in exile, and included book 5, covering 1564&#150;7, written by a continuator and giving greater prominence to Knox himself. The <span class="italic">History</span> has usually been read as the first of the great presbyterian histories of the Church of Scotland, which has tended to abstract it from its place among Knox's other writings and dislocate it from its contemporary contexts. Knox's fine eye for the telling, and often humorous, detail and his enjoyment in coining a pithy or alliterative phrase give his <span class="italic">History</span> great immediacy. Its lively narrative of a crucial episode in Scottish history has maintained interest in it both as a historical source and a literary work, ensuring a succession of editions down to the present. The impact of the <span class="italic">History</span> has been immense, and it continues to provide indispensable evidence for the period, especially the revolutionary crisis of 1559&#150;60.<br>
<br>Knox has been accused of giving himself undue prominence in this work. Yet the <span class="italic">History</span> is not an autobiography in disguise, for it conceals as much as it reveals about Knox's life; for example, it offers only a couple of sentences to cover his entire stay in England. It is instead a record of the Scottish struggle between the &#145;light of Christ's Evangel&#146; and Satan's &#145;kingdom of darkness&#146;. Knox was convinced that events in Scotland formed part of the cosmic battle between Christ and Antichrist. He fashioned his <span class="italic">History</span> within this apocalyptic framework, deliberately choosing to fill it with biblical imagery and metaphors. Knox's sections of the <span class="italic">History</span> (books 1&#150;4) were revised in the dark days of 1566, which strongly coloured both his interpretation and his memory of the events he was recording. Nevertheless, within the framework imposed by its purpose and interpretation, the <span class="italic">History</span> is a relatively reliable record, even though in many key instances, such as the famous interviews with Mary, queen of Scots, this is difficult to verify because there are no other full accounts.<br>
<br>The initial association of Knox's <span class="italic">History</span> with the Scottish presbyterian opposition was solidified in the 1620s and 1630s by David Calderwood, whose own <span class="italic">History of the Kirk of Scotland</span> depended heavily on Knox's papers and publications. This was so successful that Knox's authorship of the <span class="italic">History</span> was denied by Archbishop John Spottiswood in an attempt to retain Knox within the episcopal tradition as the acceptable Scottish reformer. These struggles produced the most enduring and influential of Knox's images, as the founding father of the Scottish Reformation and of presbyterianism.<br>
<br>Having acquired iconic status, it was inevitable that Knox should be claimed at one time or other by virtually all Scottish protestants and deemed an anti-hero and arch-heretic by the Roman Catholics. Although dismissed as a fanatic by the rational Enlightenment, Knox remained in view because of his appearance in William Robertson's influential <span class="italic">History of Scotland</span>, first published in 1759. The fight over Knox's memory became particularly bitter during the ecclesiastical divisions of the nineteenth century, especially after the Disruption of 1843 when the Free Church battled to claim the reformer for themselves. The dramatic visual impact of David Wilkie's 1830s paintings of Knox preaching in St Andrews in 1559 and celebrating communion during 1555&#150;6 reinforced the assumption that Knox had reintroduced apostolic purity to the kirk. Reflecting the revival of interest in Scottish history, the statues erected in Edinburgh's New College in 1896, and in Parliament Square in 1904 (now inside St Giles's), commemorate Knox as a preacher devoted to a rigorous biblicism.<br>
<br>Knowledge of the reformer was raised to a new level by David Laing's publication of the comprehensive six volumes of Knox's <span class="italic">Works</span> between 1846 and 1864. The corpus of material was completed in 1875 by Peter Lorimer's book <span class="italic">John Knox and the Church of England</span>, presenting the reformer as the founding father of puritanism and nonconformity. Strongly associated with the image of Knox the churchman, in its many guises, was that of the great anti-Catholic crusader, providing a model for a partisan protestant national identity within modern Scotland. Knox became an ideological patron for such anti-Catholic organizations as the Scottish Reformation Society, the Protestant Alliance, and the Orange order. Between 1909 and 1923 the Knox Club flourished, promoting Scottish Reformation history, and aiming to reduce Roman Catholic influence within Scotland and to defend the protestant succession to the throne. Among its publications were works by its vice-president, David Hay Fleming, for instance <span class="italic">The Last Days of John Knox</span> (1913).<br>
<br>Though he was firmly associated with Scotland, Knox's English and continental associations gave him an international reputation. He was included among the other major Reformation leaders in his friend Theodore Beza's <span class="italic">Icones</span> and is commemorated by a statue in Geneva's Reformation Wall, erected in 1917. He is remembered most widely throughout the presbyterian world in countless churches and several educational institutions from the United States to Korea. From the Elizabethan period Knox was enthusiastically adopted by the puritan wing of the Church of England and later by the nonconformist and dissenting traditions. Ever since Richard Bancroft's sermon at St Paul's Cross in 1589, Knox's political views have been vilified by their episcopal opponents as revolutionary and subversive.<br>
<br>A less controversial role for Knox to play was as patron of Scottish education, both at school and university levels. In the late nineteenth century his memory was employed to defend Scotland's system against &#145;Anglicizing&#146; tendencies and justify comprehensive educational provision. This image was connected to the earlier characterization of Knox as a champion of democracy, emphasizing his revolutionary political thought and principled defiance of royal authority. Such an interpretation owed much to the ground-breaking and highly influential biography by Thomas McCrie first published in 1813. By using Knox's own letters and tracts, McCrie depicted him as the personification of the spirit of the Scottish Reformation. His book became an immediate best-seller, provoking an upsurge of interest in Knox to complement the massive enthusiasm for Scotland's past generated by Sir Walter Scott. In 1825 this was given visual expression in the erection of a statue of the reformer mounted on a high pillar in the Glasgow necropolis. The Chartists even celebrated him as a forerunner of their movement. The emphasis upon his heroic qualities was carried a stage further by Thomas Carlyle, who immortalized Knox as the &#145;one Scotchman to whom, of all others, his country and the world owe a debt&#146;  (Carlyle, 133).<br>
<br>The most abiding popular picture of Knox places him in opposition to Mary, queen of Scots. As a deliberate foil to her romantic image, he has been employed by Mary's supporters and critics alike. The dramatic interviews between the pair became the best-known parts of his life, providing ideal material for large numbers of historical paintings, plays, and films. By treating Knox alongside Mary, greater emphasis was given to his relationships with, and attitude towards, women and upon his criticisms of court life. Over time these characteristics were transmuted within popular imagination into Knox the woman-hater and killjoy. In the late twentieth century this negative image was highlighted by Hugh MacDiarmaid's cultural circle as the main barrier to a positive Scottish national identity. More recently, the confidence brought by devolution and the growing interest in Scotland's history has permitted a more humorous acceptance of Knox the icon, though his name is still capable of stirring up controversy.<br>
