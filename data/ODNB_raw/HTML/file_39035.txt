<span class="headword">Player,  John</span>  (1839&#150;1884), <span class="occ">tobacco manufacturer</span>, was born at Saffron Walden, Essex, on 11 July 1839, the son of John Dane Player (1800&#150;1850), and his wife, Sophia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clare. His father, who died young, was a solicitor, and his mother was a schoolmistress. John left home about 1859 for Nottingham, apparently because of a connection with the solicitor Joseph Bright, who was to become an important figure in the town's business and civic life. Player was first employed as a general draper's clerk, but by 1862 he had a shop on Beastmarket Hill, overlooking the large market place, where he started as an agent for lace thread and for Prentice's artificial manures. His next-door neighbour was Ann Whiteley, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Goodacre, a milliner and lace dealer and a widow ten years his senior, whom he married on 16 August 1862. The couple had two sons.<br>
<br>Player soon added tobacco to his other lines, though the exact date is not on record. At that time tobacco was sold loose from jars, and weighed and handed over in small screws of plain paper, but Player quickly realized that customer loyalty to a particular type of tobacco was strong and he began to pre-pack his blends. Before very long tobacco took over as the main business of the shop. In 1877 it was so prosperous that Player purchased as a going concern the tobacco manufactory of William Wright, which had been established in Broad Marsh, Nottingham, in 1823, and already employed 150 workers. At this point Nottingham had nineteen firms engaged in the processing of tobacco, though there was no bonded warehouse for any kind of goods in the town.<br>
<br>The Player genius for advertising and marketing first appeared after the purchase of the Broad Marsh factory and was supported by a rapidly growing experience of the trade. A plain packet of tobacco containing a particular blend was obviously a ripe vehicle for a brand name to be printed on the packet. The first name to be registered was Gold Leaf; in 1877, when he first began manufacture under his own name, John Player also registered his first actual trademark, the familiar drawing of Nottingham Castle. Gold Leaf was evidently an immediate success for a Player price-list of 1881 shows a dozen other varieties of branded packet tobaccos. The Gold Leaf packet of 1885 was a work of art, printed in nine colours and gold; the gold design on the reverse was not unlike the later Picasso dove. All cigarette packets were originally soft and this led to the insertion of a small piece of plain card as a stiffener. Then more colour was introduced and the cigarette card soon became an art form in its own right. The manufacturer quickly recognized them as a major incentive to brand loyalty.<br>
<br>The most famous of all the Player trade marks was the sailor's head. In 1883 John Player was attracted to a painting of a bearded sailor produced by an artist called Wright of Clapham about thirty years earlier, when uniform had just been adopted by the Royal Navy. The portrait was being used by a small tobacco company, Parkins of Chester, to advertise their &#145;Jack's Glory&#146; brand. John Player immediately bought and registered the painting as a trademark. Over the years many variations of the background and frame appeared, including the lifebelt with two warships in the background. From the acquisition of the Wright business in 1877, Player's marketing and advertising methods were so successful that he was able to purchase some 30 acres of land in the then undeveloped suburb of Radford. On this site he built three factory blocks; production was transferred to the new site in 1884 but the whole factory was not occupied by Players until towards the end of the century.<br>
<br>John Player died of liver cancer on 9 December 1884 at 4 Branksome Terrace, Commercial Road, Bournemouth, at the early age of forty-five. For the next nine years the business was continued by family friends and senior employees, and during this interregnum the heirs were groomed to carry on the business. The eldest son, <a name="cosubject_48110"></a><span class="headword">John Dane Player</span>  (1864&#150;1950), <span class="occ">tobacco manufacturer</span>, was born at Beastmarket Hill, Nottingham, on 29 November 1864. His younger brother, <a name="cosubject_48111"></a><span class="headword">William Goodacre Player</span>  (1866&#150;1959), <span class="occ">tobacco manufacturer</span>, was born on 23 January 1866, also at Beastmarket Hill. The two sons were educated at Nottingham high school. Although John Player died before his sons reached their majority, he left a carefully prepared will in which two executors, Joseph Bright and a local bank manager, were appointed to oversee the business until the boys became twenty-five. When the business was incorporated in 1895 the sons became joint managing directors. At this time the share of the market held by John Player &amp; Sons Ltd was substantially smaller than that enjoyed by W. D. and H. O. Wills Ltd; and six years later, when the prosperity and independence of the British tobacco industry was threatened by the powerful American Tobacco Company, thirteen leading firms federated to form the Imperial Tobacco Company. Players's share of the capital was reckoned at only &pound;600,000 out of &pound;11.9 million. Nevertheless, J. D. Player was one of the original directors of the combine and was also appointed advertising manager to the parent company. His younger brother became a director following the first board meeting. Imperial Tobacco &#145;leaned heavily on the advertising skills of Messrs J. D. and W. G. Player&#146;  (Alford, 275), but this did not prevent the Players brands competing with those of other members of the group, nor apparently did it dilute the quality of the Nottingham firm's advertising.<br>
<br>John Dane and William Player both married in the final decade of the nineteenth century. The eldest son married Margaret Page, and they lived at Fernleigh, in Alexandra Park, Nottingham. In 1894 his brother William married Mabel Askley, and they had four sons, two of whom entered the firm, and also four daughters. William bought Lenton Hurst, in Nottingham, a house which subsequently became part of Nottingham University. He later acquired Whatton Manor, Whatton, 10 miles east of Nottingham, and made that his home.<br>
<br>Befitting their pre-eminence as Nottingham businessmen and philanthropists, the two brothers were made honorary freemen of the city of Nottingham in 1934. In that year John Dane Player was also made a deputy lieutenant for Nottinghamshire, having served as a JP since 1905. Having no children of his own, he was a benefactor of the Nottingham children's hospital, to which he gave &pound;50,000 for its rebuilding programme.<br>
<br>Father and sons had the reputation of enlightened employers. The popular practice of paying every employee an annual bonus on earnings was started in 1910, and holidays with pay were started in 1922. Sports clubs associated with the firm started in the early 1900s and led to a comprehensive welfare and sports organization with well-equipped grounds. The firm became noted for its high wages and excellent working conditions. John Player &amp; Sons, as it became known, continued to grow with the increasing demand for cigarettes. Under the leadership of the two brothers the workforce grew to a thousand by 1898, to 2500 by 1914, and to 5000 by 1928.<br>
<br>J. D. Player died at his home, Fernleigh, Alexandra Park, Nottingham, on 6 April 1950. His brother, William, died at Whatton Manor on 27 June 1959. Both were extremely wealthy at the time of their deaths: the elder son's estate exceeded &pound;2.5 million.<br>
