</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Murray,  Andrew Graham</span>, first Viscount Dunedin  (1849&#150;1942), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 21 November 1849 at Edinburgh, the only child of Thomas Graham Murray (1816&#150;1891), of Stenton near Dunkeld, Perthshire, writer to the signet and crown agent for Scotland, and his wife, Caroline Jane (<i>d</i>. 1906), daughter of John Tod, writer to the signet, of Kirkhill, Midlothian. On both sides Murray came from a legal background. His paternal grandfather, Alexander Murray of Murrayshall, had been an advocate. John Tod was one of the founders of the leading Edinburgh solicitors' firm of Tod, Murray, and Jamieson, in which Murray's father was a partner.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlylegalandpoliticalcareer"></a>Education and early legal and political career</h2>Murray was educated at a private school in Tunbridge Wells and was a Spencer scholar at Harrow School. From there he proceeded with a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a second class in classics in 1872. The effort he put in at school appears to have been diverted more into sports at Cambridge. Murray, together with a college friend, made a pioneering eight-hole golf course on Midsummer Common. He also further developed the skills at rackets he had shown signs of at school. His education thus far had also given Murray an English veneer which never wholly rubbed off, even in later life.<br>
<br>From Cambridge, Murray went to Edinburgh University where he passed through the ordinary law classes. He then spent, according to the usual practice, a year in his father's practice before being admitted to the Scottish bar in July 1874. It is worth noting that in choosing the bar he had given up his claim to &#145;probably the richest prize in the legal profession in Scotland&#146; of a partnership in this firm for the somewhat less certain career of an advocate  (<span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>, 22 Aug 1942). Murray was an early friend of R. L. Stevenson, who was admitted to the bar on the same day in the following year and who was said to have consulted Murray when writing <span class="italic">Weir of Hermiston</span>. Both were members of the Speculative Society at the university, in which Murray held the offices of librarian and president. On 1 October 1874 Murray married Mary Clementina (1857&#150;1922), seventh of the eight daughters of Admiral Sir William Edmonstone MP of Duntreath, Stirlingshire, fourth baronet. They had one son and three daughters. Murray's first wife was very active in the support of charitable and patriotic causes in Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Tradition had it that Murray spent the year at Tod, Murray, and Jamieson, studying Italian rather than law. Doubts were expressed about his ability to concentrate and at the start of his career as an advocate he &#145;enjoyed himself in every lawful manner&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scotsman</span>, 22 Aug 1942). Golf, dancing (&#145;hard and late&#146;), and shooting and fishing (though he lacked the patience for the latter and preferred games to both) helped to fill up the time left by the practice he had. In his physical prime Murray was tall, slender, and athletic, with a well-knit frame, muscular and energetic. Some of his energy was, nevertheless, obviously taken up by extensive legal reading. It was at this time that he read the work on feudal law by George Ross (his uncle by marriage). He later referred to this as having given him the grounding in the area in which he was to enjoy a leading reputation. Murray also brought together a number of advantages which ensured that by the mid-1880s he had a large and lucrative practice, specializing in conveyancing and patent cases. These included an ability to switch rapidly from one occupation to another and the gift of clear-headed, logical, and lucid exposition. Though he was not an orator, he excelled in arguing a case with imperfect preparation, not only because he was acute, but also due to his absence of nervousness. To these personal skills Murray at the outset added the backing of his father's firm and family legal connections.<br>
<br>In 1888 Murray was appointed advocate-depute in the crown office, and in 1890 he was considered for the vacant post of solicitor-general for Scotland. Passed over on this occasion in view of the stronger claims of Sir Charles Pearson, he was made sheriff of Perthshire, but he became solicitor&#150;general in 1891 when Pearson succeeded James Robertson as lord advocate. At this time he also became a queen's counsel. In October 1891 Murray was elected to parliament as a Conservative member for Bute, the seat Robertson had vacated on his elevation to the bench. This was the seat that Murray's uncle David Mure had represented some thirty years before. Murray had previously and unsuccessfully contested East Perthshire, also as a Conservative, at the 1885 general election. He represented Bute until he became a judge more than thirteen years later, and he was also lord lieutenant from 1901 to 1905. Murray was not, however, a natural constituency politician. In addition to not being an orator, he displayed either an absent-mindedness or a too-obvious exertion to make himself agreeable in this field of activity.<br>
<br>Out of office from 1892, Murray again became solicitor-general when the Conservatives returned to power in 1895. In the following year he succeeded Sir Charles Pearson, who had become a judge, as lord advocate, and he also became a privy councillor. Murray's friend and ally, Scott Dickson, became solicitor-general in his place. As lord advocate Murray earned a reputation as an excellent administrator, open to those he worked with and conciliatory in his approach to business. He was not, however, counted a great success as a parliamentary debater.<br>
<br>In 1903 Lord Balfour of Burleigh resigned over tariff reform, and as a consequence Murray succeeded him as secretary for Scotland with a seat in the cabinet. He accepted this appointment with some reluctance as it involved a cut in his official salary from &pound;5000 to &pound;2000, but he was reportedly mollified by the assurance that he would retain any claims to a judicial appointment that would have been his as lord advocate. In his short tenure of office Murray was involved in the negotiations which preceded the introduction of the <span class="roman">Churches (Scotland) Bill</span>. He was also brought into closer official contact with Edward VII and was credited with being a mentor to the king in Scottish matters for the remainder of the reign.<h2>
<a name="MemberoftheCourtofSession"></a>Member of the Court of Session</h2>In early 1905 Murray was appointed to succeed Lord Kinross, who had died, as lord president of the Court of Session and lord justice-general. His mother was present to see him take his seat. Just before taking up this position he was raised to the peerage as Baron Dunedin of Stenton in Perthshire. His friend Hugh Pattison Macmillan, later his biographer and colleague as a House of Lords' appeals judge, believed that this period in the chair of the first division of the Court of Session was the summit of Dunedin's career. Of his immediate predecessors, Robertson had been more interested in politics and Kinross had been prevented by ill health from exercising vigorous leadership. Dunedin, by contrast, was really interested in legal problems and believed strongly in the integrity of the law of Scotland. He was also able to &#145;breathe fresh life into his colleagues&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scotsman</span>, 22 Aug 1942) in a relationship helped by his accessibility to argument and a lack of vanity which allowed him to admit that his first view might be wrong. In his relations with the bar Dunedin did not continue to be an advocate when he became a judge and apparently enjoyed listening to a well-arranged presentation, interrupting only to clear away obscurities. As an example of Dunedin's courage in the pursuit of justice and readiness to brush aside technicalities, Macmillan cites the case of his willingness to arrange payment so that an appellant from the Court of Session who had run out of funds could take a case on to the House of Lords  (<span class="italic">Scottish Law Review</span>, 151). Dunedin had been in the majority in the case in question and the outcome saw this judgment overturned. In his opinions Dunedin tried to seek out the principle involved in a case and welcomed the opportunity to restate appropriate legal rules, which gave his judgments the authoritative reputation of being a storehouse of legal opinion. As a result, however, they were not always restricted to a statement of what was strictly necessary for a decision and were marked by occasional colloquialisms and circumlocutions.<h2>
<a name="Lordofappealinordinary"></a>Lord of appeal-in-ordinary</h2>In 1913 Dunedin was chosen to fill one of the two new positions as a lord of appeal-in-ordinary created to strengthen the supreme appeals court. Accepting this position removed him from a leadership role to one of playing his part in a team. He appears to have made the adjustment well and was thereafter involved in many of the landmark judgments handed down in his nineteen-year tenure. Commentators have seen a contrast between his work during this period and that of the other Scottish law lord at the time, Lord Shaw of Dunfermline. In the case <i>R. v. Halliday</i> in 1917 over the internment of a British citizen in wartime, Shaw, in the minority, emotionally invoked the liberty of the subject, while Dunedin, with the majority, was in favour of upholding the regulations regarding the defence of the realm. This approach to the law, &#145;pure and simple, touched, if at all by common sense&#146;  (<span class="italic">Law Journal</span>, 3 Oct 1942, 317), was also evident in Dunedin's agreement with the majority in <i>Bowman v. The Secular Society</i>, also in 1917, that a bequest to a rationalist society was legal. In this he was opposed by Lord Chancellor Finlay who appears to have thought that Christianity was in some danger. Dunedin presided in 1920 at the hearing of the <i>Attorney-General v. De Keyser's Royal Hotel</i>, probably the best-known of the wartime cases he was called upon to judge. He delivered the leading judgment that the company concerned was entitled to full compensation under the <span class="roman">Defence Act 1842</span> for the requisition of property for defence purposes. This judgment was to be superseded in 1939 by the more restricted provisions of the <span class="roman">Compensation (Defence) Act</span>. Other cases worth mentioning with which Dunedin was concerned and which reached the House of Lords included <i>Sinclair v. Brougham</i> (1914), in which he dealt at length with the problem of &#145;unjust enrichment&#146; and argued that English equity should be able to deal as well as other systems with the problem of equitable restitution. In <i>Lord Advocate v. Marquess of Zetland</i> (1920), one of the last cases to deal with the intricacies of Scottish feudal law, Dunedin, on ground he knew so well, was able to assist his colleagues in dealing with the abstruseness of the points at issue. Finally, <i>Cantiere San Rocco v. Clyde Shipbuilding and Engineering</i> (1923) allowed Dunedin to display his preference for the Scottish law of restitution as against the English law as it then stood.<br>
<br>Comparisons between the English and Scottish legal systems were a theme also in Dunedin's published writings. His letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> of 20 April 1927 discussed the rights of crown and subject under Scottish law and contained a comment characteristic of his terse, pungent, witty style: &#145;in England you have to find the remedy in order to discover the right, whereas in Scotland you have to find the right in order to discover the remedy&#146;. His &#145;Fifty years: the bench and the bar&#146;, published in the same newspaper on 18 February 1932, was a valuable reflective piece on legal developments in both countries which traced the replacement of feudal cases in Scotland by those generated by companies and workmen's compensation legislation; it also pointed out that a new class of scientific lawyer, concerned with patent cases, had left judges struggling to keep pace in this area. In all these developments Dunedin makes clear his firsthand experience or direct shaping involvement. He recounts, for instance, his ticking off by Joseph Chamberlain for inserting a clause in the Scottish version of workmen's compensation legislation which allowed the use of paid lawyers in such proceedings. Chamberlain had in the end to give way, having been brought to see that companies would simply use specially trained non-lawyers to the disadvantage of inexperienced employee litigants. Similarly, Dunedin's expression of regret at the passing of judges of high individuality and purely Scottish education such as Lord Deas echoes the belief at the Scottish bar that one reason for Dunedin's early success had been his courageous and tactful handling of the person whose outspokenness from the bench he had so much enjoyed.<h2>
<a name="Otheractivities"></a>Other activities</h2>Though more active in writing to the press in later life, and a source of information and guidance&#151;often, owing to his judicial position, not available for publication&#151;to the <span class="italic">Law Journal</span>, Dunedin was otherwise not a prolific writer. <span class="italic">A Digest of Registration Cases</span>, which first appeared in 1877, and the historical pamphlet <span class="italic">A short account of the principality of Scotland and the title of prince and steward of Scotland</span> (1892), are titles which can be mentioned.<br>
<br>In 1900 Dunedin became the keeper of the great seal of the principality of Scotland, an office he held until 1936. Many other honours were also bestowed on him in this later period in his life. He was awarded the GCVO in 1923 and created Viscount Dunedin of Stenton in 1926. Honorary LLD degrees were bestowed by the universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Toronto, Chicago, and Columbia, and that of DCL by Oxford. He was elected an honorary bencher of the Middle Temple, London, in 1910. In addition to being lord lieutenant of Bute, he was also a deputy lieutenant of the county of the city of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>In December 1922 Dunedin's first wife died and in July 1923 he married Jean (1885&#150;1944) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62139/', "Murray, Jane Elmslie Henderson")</script>], daughter of George Findlay, merchant, of Aberdeen. The second Lady Dunedin was probably best-known as the first director of Scottish War Savings from 1916 to 1923. She was created CBE in 1920 for her work in this position. Lady Dunedin had been assistant editor at Everyman from 1914 to 1916 and was to be editor in 1933&#150;4. She published works of her own also, such as <span class="italic">Three Aspects of the Russian Revolution</span> (1918).<br>
<br>Dunedin was reportedly very proud of his wife's achievements, and it is a matter for speculation how far his second marriage encouraged him in the discovery of new activities aside from the law and in his greater participation in current affairs through letters to the press. This is not to say that his early pace of social activity had abated before this time. Profuse hospitality, friendships in high social circles, and a lasting preference for dancing over more sedentary evening pleasures, all showed Dunedin's taste for the good life. Golf continued to be an interest. Dunedin was captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club in 1892 and of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers in 1893&#150;4. He was also a good tennis and billiards player and had some experience of coaching as a sport. Mechanical and technical things were another interest. Dunedin was a pioneer motorist, and he was also said to have been one of the first MPs to ride into Palace Yard on a bicycle. He was responsible for the design of his house, 7 Rothesay Terrace, Edinburgh. As he had been no orator in politics, so he was no raconteur on the after-dinner circuit, but he told a good story and reportedly gave after-dinner speeches in languages other than English. In addition to a good knowledge of French, which he spoke with a marked British accent, Dunedin took up the study of Romanian and German in middle age and enjoyed showing off his linguistic proficiency. To all these social qualities and activities must be added his wit. On Hugh Macmillan's appointment to be his House of Lords' colleague in 1930, for instance, Dunedin telegraphed &#145;heartiest congratulations to <i>myself</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scottish Law Review</span>, 151), most probably a reference to the inspiration Macmillan said he had derived from the older man's example.<br>
<br>Dunedin retired as an appeals judge in March 1932, having confided to Macmillan that his memory was failing. This was still not matched, however, by any comparable loss of interest in pursuing an active life. Dunedin became a keen amateur film-maker, and in 1935 he was appointed the first honorary fellow of the Cinema Institute, of which he was a founder patron. He also exhibited a marked wanderlust, travelling widely in different parts of the world.<br>
<br>Viscount Dunedin died in an Edinburgh nursing home on 21 August 1942, having been ill for some time previously, and he was buried three days later at Caputh churchyard in Perthshire. He was survived by his widow, who died in March 1944, and by two of his daughters from his first marriage.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Dunedin held a sequence of high offices, both political and judicial, on his way to becoming a law lord, and was the recipient of a range of honours. A unionist, his career was a product of the union from his education to his easy movement between the Scottish and English legal systems in later life, and beyond that his contact as an appeals judge with colonial cases. His place in history, however, is not that of a well-known public figure. Rather it is of the kind that fades more quickly from the public mind, namely that of a great lawyer of his generation. Hugh Macmillan ranks him with Inglis and Watson as the best that the Parliament House, Edinburgh, produced in the half century that Dunedin himself looked back on in his <span class="italic">Times</span> article of 1932. His judgments were seen as standing in the Scottish tradition of substance rather than form, and of principle rather than precedent. His varied and highly active life outside his profession, and his apparent wish to be counted a man of the world rather than as a legal scholar, should not detract from his obvious interest in the law as an intellectual exercise. In addition Dunedin was concerned above all with the sound and rational administration of the law. His rejection, after trying it out as a junior, of the parliamentary bar as too turbulent, and his preference for feudal and patent cases, are indicative of this; so too are the references to his contribution to legal development, especially with respect to workmen's compensation legislation, from his friend Lord Macmillan.<br>
