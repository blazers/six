<span class="headword">Plymley,  Katherine</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1758, <em>d.</em> 1829), <span class="occ">diarist, naturalist, and painter</span>, was baptized at Longnor, Shropshire, on 31 January 1758, the eldest child of Joseph Plymley (1716&#150;1802), apothecary, of the Bank House, Longnor, Shropshire, and Diana, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Flint (1725&#150;1779), a member of the Shropshire gentry family of Corbett. Her siblings were Joseph (1759&#150;1838), who became archdeacon of Shropshire in 1792, inherited the Corbett estates in 1804, and took the surname of Corbett in 1806; and Ann (1760&#150;1829), who studied botany. The Plymleys were part of the Shropshire enlightenment, and formed part of a social network which included the Darwins and the Wedgwoods. Both Katherine Plymley and her sister were educated at home, and lived all their lives together in the same house, where during their father's lifetime they assisted him in making and dispensing medicines. Neither of them married.<br>
<br>Katherine Plymley's written archive comprises 210 unlined notebooks in longhand: 34 are undated study notebooks, 29 are travel journals, 9 are memoirs of her father and her favourite niece, Jane (1788&#150;1807), written after 1802 and 1807 respectively, and 138 are diaries written between 1791 and 1827. She was a well-informed, astute, conscientious and, on occasion, witty observer and her writing is important for its revelation of feminine interests and experience within a particular social and cultural milieu. The study notebooks show her engaged in a programme of self-improvement which continued throughout her life. She read with method, and most contain a series of extracts from diverse texts, with discursive commentaries incorporated. They are not dated, which makes it very difficult to construct a narrative of Plymley's life or trace her intellectual development. However in some the content points to a date and the earliest of these was written in 1781. Central themes include religion and religious debate, moral philosophy, literature, biography, education, and travel. Although she made no overt demands for equal rights, a protofeminist thread runs through all Katherine Plymley's writing. She gave much thought to the dilemma of the single woman in a society that defined women by their relationships with men, and took polite but definite issue with anyone who opposed female education.<br>
<br>Both Plymley sisters were closely involved with the upbringing and education of their brother's thirteen children from his two marriages. This was a responsibility they welcomed: &#145;it has been a motive to endeavour to increase our own knowledge,&#146; Katherine Plymley wrote, &#145;that we may be more capable of informing them&#146;  (&#145;Memoirs of my father&#146;, fol. 3). One limit to her reading stemmed from the fact that, even in her own comparatively enlightened family, daughters were not taught classics. As a result some texts frustrated her. There was, she wrote in the face of the particularly irritating example of a passage in <span class="italic">The Pursuits of Literature</span> by Thomas Mathias, &#145;often great obscurity from perpetual quotations of Greek &amp; Latin authors&#146;  (study notebook, Penzance, 1803, Shrops. RRC, 1066/149). Her brother involved her in at least the social side of the research that led, in 1803, to the publication of <span class="italic">A General View of the Agriculture of Shropshire</span>, a report on the resources of the county that incorporated research material from a number of leading scholars, including William Withering, Thomas Telford, Joseph Babington (<i>d</i>. 1826), John Stackhouse, and Robert Townson. When people like this visited him, as Katherine Plymley remarked: &#145;my brother has the goodness to ask me &hellip; knowing I enjoy listening to such society&#146;  (diary, 19 June&#150;17 Aug 1809, Shrops. RRC, 1066/78).<br>
<br>The travel journals deal with a tour through north Wales to Anglesey in 1792; to Bath in 1794 and 1807; trips to London in 1796, 1804, 1813, and 1814; to London and Bath in 1795; to Oxford in 1801; to Penzance in 1802&#150;3; and to London and Cambridge in 1814. They describe the landscape Plymley passed through, often drawing on the picturesque idiom, and any notable sights or incidents that occurred <i>en route</i>. In 1792, for instance, on her way to Anglesey she visited Plas Newydd, home of Lady Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby, the &#145;Ladies of Llangollen&#146;, and in 1796 on her way to London she saw William Herschel's &#145;immense tellescopes [<i>sic</i>]&#146; at Slough  (&#145;Journey to London&#146;, 1796, Shrops. RRC, 567/5/5/1/8).<br>
<br>Once arrived at her destination, Plymley made excursions in the locality and these too were faithfully recorded. Her account of Trevithick's steam locomotive trials, written at Penzance in 1803, has been used to establish the number and extent of trials made. Her writing can convey a real sense of immediacy. In 1814 she mingled with the crowd in St James's Park to admire:<blockquote>the Chinese Bridge erected there &hellip; upon occasion of the Prince Regent's feast in honour of the Peace [with France] &hellip; I heard some of them speaking to each other, very coarse &amp; strong expressions of disapprobation of the expence this feast &hellip; had put the nation to. (&#145;Journey to London and Cambridge&#146;, 1814, Shrops. RRC, 567/5/5/1/31)</blockquote>She visited galleries and exhibitions, generally noting which works she liked and why, and she took enormous interest in the way people arranged their surroundings and the objects they displayed. The travel journals are littered with descriptions of interiors, both public and private.Katherine Plymley was inspired to begin writing diaries in October 1791, when the leading slavery abolitionist Thomas Clarkson (1760&#150;1846), a man she venerated, made the first of several extended visits to Longnor. There is no regular pattern to the amount of time covered by each diary. Some deal with just a few days or weeks; others cover several months. They are reflective far beyond what was needed for a day-to-day chronicle of events. The Plymleys were at the centre of the campaign for the abolition of the slave trade, and the progress of the abolition, especially &#145;the part taken by my Brother&#146;  (diary, 28 Jan&#150;21 March 1794, Shrops. RRC, 1066/25), dominates the earlier diaries. As time went by, however, she wrote more and more on everyday life. Although her diaries do give mundane quotidian details, many describe selected episodes and incidents. The range of subject material is vast, including sickness and health, fashion and manners, farming, landscape, estate management, economics, politics, pageantry, art, architecture, design, science, industry, and religion. The result is a succession of interwoven narratives that, while focusing on the minutiae of private experience, construct an extraordinary panorama of her life and times. On more than one occasion she declared that it was not her intention to discuss &#145;public affairs&#146;  (diary, 29 Dec 1797&#150;11 July 1798, Shrops. RRC, 1066/51), yet time and again they invade her accounts. While she deplored the violent turn of events in France, she applauded the principles of the French Revolution and supported calls for electoral reform in Britain. She believed in universal education and meritocracy, and was attracted to self-made men. There are numerous thumbnail character sketches, and several of her diaries and journals offer fresh information on the private lives of figures such as Clarkson and William Wilberforce. Plymley was well versed in the religious debates of her day and sympathetic to dissenting beliefs, especially Quakerism, although she remained a committed Anglican throughout her life. &#145;I have always respected the right of private opinion upon the most important of subjects,&#146; she wrote in 1812, &#145;this is a subject between God &amp; our conscience&#146;  (diary, 11 Nov&#150;22 Dec 1812, Shrops. RRC, 1066/95).<br>
<br>Katherine and Ann Plymley were keen students of natural history and their collection, which included minerals, shells, insects, dried plants, and lichens, was much admired. Katherine Plymley's specialism was entomology, particularly butterflies and moths. She reared, studied, and made paintings of over 400 varieties of insects, which were afterwards released back into the wild. The earliest dated painting was produced in 1797; many are undated however. She was at her most prolific between 1802 and 1806, when she worked closely with her niece Jane. Her paintings were arranged in loose-leaf albums, each dealing with a separate class of entomology. They were executed in direct response to the subject, with minimal under-drawing and scientific accuracy. Whenever possible she represented the whole cycle of each specimen on a single sheet along with the plants on which it fed. The richness of the colouring, the delicacy of the details, the overall composition, and the immaculate finish show a highly developed aesthetic sense and they are often very beautiful. Katherine Plymley learned many of her skills from her father who had &#145;superior excellence in painting subjects of natural history&#146;  (diary, 8 May&#150;29 June 1811, Shrops. RRC, 1066/86), and who contributed illustrations to Thomas Pennant's <span class="italic">British Zoology</span>. She researched her subjects in the latest publications and discussed her findings with eminent contemporaries, including Frederick William Hope. Katherine and Ann Plymley used their natural history collections to teach children: principally their nieces and nephews, but also the offspring of friends and acquaintances. Hope first encountered the Plymley sisters as a boy, and it is possible that Hope's friend Charles Darwin also met the Plymleys as a child.<br>
<br>In Katherine Plymley a free-thinking, progressive attitude was joined to an accentuated sense of social responsibility. She was acutely aware that society was undergoing rapid changes and she had strong views on the way forward. At the same time, she was a tolerant woman who respected the opinions of others: a reliable witness who strove to be &#145;active, social and temperate&#146;  (study notebook, undated, Shrops. RRC, 1066/154) and who rarely expressed anything like anger. &#145;I am, I think,&#146; she remarked, &#145;naturally of a temper the reverse of sanguine&#151;perhaps to a fault&#151;it is constitutional in me&#146;  (diary, 17&#150;30 Aug 1793, Shrops. RRC, 1066/18). She died at the Bank House, Longnor, on 2 September 1829, a few weeks after her sister. They are both buried in Leebotwood church, where their memorial celebrates them as:<blockquote>Women of superior minds which they had cultivated with great industry and devoted to the service of God and of their fellow creatures, no persons perhaps of equal means ever contributed more to the comfort of their nearer relatives or the wants of an extended neighbourhood.</blockquote>
