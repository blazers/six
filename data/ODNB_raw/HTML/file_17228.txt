<span class="headword">Luttrell,  Henry Lawes</span>, second earl of Carhampton  (1737&#150;1821), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born at Cranford, Middlesex, on 7 August 1737, the eldest son of Simon Luttrell, first earl of Carhampton (1713&#150;1787), landowner and politician, of Castlehaven, co. Cork, and Judith Maria (<i>d</i>. 1798), daughter of Sir Nicholas Lawes and Elizabeth Cotton. Educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford, Luttrell began his military career in 1757 as ensign in the 48th foot, rising in 1759 to lieutenant in the 34th foot and captain of the 16th light dragoons. In April 1762 he became a major and was made deputy adjutant-general of the British forces in Portugal; he received the local rank of lieutenant-colonel in October 1762 and in February 1765 was made lieutenant-colonel of the 1st regiment of horse.<br>
<br>In 1768 Luttrell entered politics as member for the Cornish borough of Bossiney. Thereafter Luttrell embarked on something of a personal crusade against John Wilkes, whom he attacked in his maiden speech. In 1769, after Wilkes's election for Middlesex had been declared void for the third time, Luttrell offered to stand if the government would ensure his return on petition. Although heavily defeated in the election on 13 April 1769 by 1143 votes to 296, the House of Commons carried a motion by 197 to 143 declaring Luttrell elected, which sparked popular outrage. Horace Walpole reported that Luttrell was hissed out of the theatre, assaulted as he left the house, and for several months &#145;did not dare appear in the streets or scarce quit his lodgings&#146;  (Walpole, 3.359). Luttrell was frequently attacked in print, particularly by the political satirist Junius who, representing the views of anti-court whigs, disparaged his election as an &#145;arbitrary appointment [which] invades the foundation of the laws themselves&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Junius</span>, 83, letter 15, to the duke of Grafton, 8 July 1769). Luttrell's personal unpopularity was compounded by his family's scandalous reputation. Junius compared his &#145;unnatural union&#146; with Middlesex to the clandestine marriage of Luttrell's sister, Anne Horton, to the duke of Cumberland  (ibid., 316, letter 68, to Lord Chief Justice Mansfield, 21 Jan 1772). Nevertheless, as reward for opposing Wilkes, Luttrell sought and received the position of adjutant-general in Ireland. In 1774 he resumed his former seat for Bossiney which he held until 1784. On 25 June 1776 he married Jane (<i>d</i>. 1831), daughter of George Boyd and Anne Hamilton of Dublin. He received a marriage settlement of &pound;20,000.<br>
<br>Luttrell's military career meanwhile had advanced apace: he became colonel (brevet) in August 1777 and major-general in November 1782. As adjutant-general in Ireland he displayed the same thrusting ambition and contempt for public opinion that he had in England. In 1779 he proposed a highly unpopular and unsuccessful scheme to bring the Irish Volunteers under government control. He was also active in Irish politics and sat for the borough of Old Leighlin from 1783 to 1787. During 1786 he was tasked with subduing agrarian Rightboy protesters in Munster, and went on a whirlwind tour with a special commission and 2000 soldiers. He attempted pacification both by a show of military force and by the negotiation of mutually acceptable levels of clerical tithe. The mission failed amid recriminations. His proposals for lower tithes were construed as sanctioning protests and the clergy complained that his failure to follow up his threats provoked a renewal of the disturbances. Nevertheless, he became colonel of the 6th dragoons in 1788, and in 1789 lieutenant-general of the ordnance in Ireland.<br>
<br>On the death of his father in January 1787 Luttrell, who had earlier quarrelled acrimoniously with his father over the settlement of Luttrellstown, co. Dublin, succeeded to the family titles and estates. In 1790 he re-entered the Westminster parliament for Plympton Erle and held that seat until 1794; thereafter the dangers of Irish insurrection and possible invasion occupied his attention. In March 1795 he advocated that armed loyalist associations should hold Dublin if its garrison moved against an invader. In May that year he was given unlimited authority to tackle the Defenders in Connaught. Here he encouraged magistrates to arrest men on suspicion, many of whom (estimates vary between 1300 and 200) were sent to serve on the fleet. Although brutally effective, his impetuous methods alarmed the viceroy, Lord Camden, who vetoed his plans for armed anti-Defender loyalist associations in October 1795. Camden later admitted that Carhampton had exceeded the laws in Connaught, and an indemnity act was passed early in 1796. When establishment of an Irish yeomanry was being canvassed in the summer of 1796, Carhampton toured various parts of Ireland to enlist support but, typically, portrayed the dangers in such lurid terms that he caused agricultural prices to plummet and actually encouraged disaffection. In October 1796 he became Irish commander-in-chief by default, the first choice to succeed General Cunninghame, Sir Charles Grey, having declined on health grounds. Carhampton zealously set about improving Ireland's defences but was overtaken by events when a French invasion fleet appeared at Bantry Bay in late December 1796. His handling of this crisis was subjected to heavy criticism, particularly the decision to abandon Cork. Afterwards Edward Cooke summed him up as &#145;quick, but flighty&#146;, and noted that: &#145;It is unfortunate but true that Lord Carhampton has different ideas about the defence of Ireland from every officer in the whole army&#146; (PRONI, Sneyd MSS, T3229/2/22, Cooke to Auckland, 9 Feb 1797; BL, Add. MS 33103, fol. 130, Cooke to Pelham, 3 Feb 1797). The northern commander, General Knox, criticized Carhampton for refusing to believe that republicans had infiltrated the militia. Knox also deplored Carhampton's impetuous behaviour, highlighting an undignified fracas in a Newry public house in April 1797 when he tore a green handkerchief from a United Irishman's neck. His reputation made him a target for the disaffected and there was a plot to assassinate him in May 1797, for which two men were executed, one the blacksmith on his own Luttrellstown estate. By now Camden was considering replacing him, telling the home secretary: &#145;with all the merit he possesses, there is certainly a degree of indiscretion in his character, that makes him unfit for the chief command of the army&#146;  (TNA: PRO, Home Office 100/68, fols. 233&#150;4, Camden to Portland, 28 April 1797). As a suitably experienced successor was again unavailable, Carhampton remained in command until November 1797 when he was replaced by Sir Ralph Abercromby; he was compensated with the master-generalship of the ordnance and was made a full general in January 1798.<br>
<br>Carhampton had opposed the union of Britain and Ireland when it was first mooted but by June 1799 Cornwallis reported that: &#145;he has sold Luttrellstown, and means to vote for the Union which he so loudly and indecently reprobated&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of &hellip; Cornwallis</span>, 3.112). He later had second thoughts about the sale of Luttrellstown and tried unsuccessfully to renege on the agreement with the purchaser, the wealthy Dublin bookseller Luke White  (T. Kemmis to Carhampton, 11 May 1802, PRONI, T 3404/37). Having purchased an estate at Painshill, near Cobham, Surrey, Carhampton re-entered parliament in June 1817 as MP for Ludgershall and held the seat until his death. He died at his home in Bruton Street, London, on 25 April 1821, survived by his wife and his only known child, a natural son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17222/', "Henry Luttrell (1768&#150;1851)")</script>. The title passed to his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17225/', "John Luttrell-Olmius (d. 1829)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17224/', "Luttrell, James")</script>]; his two other brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17224/', "James Luttrell (c.1751&#150;1788)")</script> and <a name="cosubject_17228"></a><span class="headword">Temple Simon Luttrell</span>  (1738?&#150;1803), <span class="occ">politician</span>, had predeceased him. Temple Simon Luttrell, probably born on 8 September 1738, had been educated with Henry at Westminster and on 26 April 1778 married Elizabeth Gould (<i>d</i>. 1803), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11152/', "Sir Henry Gould (1710&#150;1794)")</script>, judge. He sat as MP for Milborne Port from 1774 to 1780, and gained some notoriety during the war against America for his attacks on the Admiralty and for campaigning against the press gang. The violence of his speeches against Lord North, however, lost him his seat. He was arrested at Boulogne on 18 September 1793 and when his captors realized that his sister, Anne, had been married to the duke of Cumberland, they triumphantly announced him to be the king of England's brother. He was released on 14 February 1795 and died in Paris on 14 January 1803, leaving no children; his widow died in Kensington three months later on 21 May.<br>
