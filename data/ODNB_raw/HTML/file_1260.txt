<span class="headword">Bampfield,  Thomas</span>  (1622/3&#150;1693), <span class="occ">speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was a younger son of John Bampfield (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1650) and Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Drake. The Bampfields were one of Devon's leading gentry families, seated at Poltimore near Exeter. After attending Exeter College, Oxford, where he matriculated, aged seventeen, on 15 May 1640 but did not take a degree, Bampfield was admitted to the Middle Temple on 28 October 1642, and was called to the bar in 1649. Back in his native county he was made deputy recorder of Exeter in 1652, and succeeded Edmund Prideaux as recorder in 1654. He was first included in the Devon commission of the peace in 1653, and had been admitted to the quorum by 1656. He was a commissioner for ejecting scandalous ministers in the county from 1654, and this appointment accorded well with his presbyterian leanings. He provided &pound;100 for the building of a wall in 1657 in Exeter Cathedral that separated presbyterian and Independent congregations, and as a county magistrate was an advocate of the so-called reformation of manners.<br>
<br>Elected to the first protectorate parliament on 12 July 1654 for Exeter, Bampfield took little or no part in this assembly, and may have been initially reluctant to take the Recognition, imposed by the government on MPs as a test of loyalty to the new constitution. He and another MP went to discuss their scruples with Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell before concluding that to accept the Recognition was justifiable. He was returned again to the second Cromwellian parliament, and this time played a major role both in committees and in debate on the floor of the house. He reported from the large and emotionally charged committee that examined James Nayler, the notorious Quaker, and urged repeatedly that the committee's verdict that Nayler was a blasphemer be accepted and acted upon by the house: &#145;If you set this aside, and do nothing in it, I shall say it is no more Nayler's sin, but set it upon your doors&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Burton</span>, 1.33). On other matters before this parliament Bampfield demonstrated a country suspicion of the government, and was quick to detect any threat to the legislature by the executive.<br>
<br>In the parliament of Richard Cromwell, Bampfield was first appointed speaker on a temporary basis on 16 March 1659, and then on 15 April was elected speaker in his own right until the dissolution a week later. His severity in the chair was noted, as was his capacity to keep control of proceedings. It was probably his advocacy of parliament as a check on the government that recommended him as speaker, both to republicans as well as to Cromwellians. Later that year Bampfield presented to the revived Commonwealth government from the Devon gentry a petition calling for a free parliament, in effect recommending some kind of restored monarchy.<br>
<br>In 1660 Bampfield was elected to the Convention to represent both Exeter and Tiverton, but chose to sit for the former. He was a staunch supporter of a presbyterian church settlement, seeking to confirm ministers in their livings. He resisted the return of the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> of the Church of England. He helped draft a petition to the king in favour of clemency for John Lambert and Sir Henry Vane, and moved that &#145;the King should be desired to marry and that it should be to a Protestant&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 4.119). Although he lost his recordership of Exeter while the Convention was still in being he did not respond by modifying his advocacy of presbyterian inspired solutions to issues of public drunkenness and profanity. He saw new legislation on the excise and the militia as deliberate revivals of the authoritarian government style of the mid-1650s, and opposed the revival of the dukedom of Norfolk as &#145;an act of grace to those of the popish religion&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 4.155).<br>
<br>The corporation of Exeter retained respect for Bampfield even after his loss of office, voting him a small reward for his efforts in parliament on their behalf, but he probably read the omens correctly in not standing again for parliament. He kept a place on the Devon bench until 1665, but thereafter only re-entered public life briefly. He was listed as a supporter of James II in the failed election of 1688, and made an appearance on the hustings at the Exeter by-election of June 1689, but did not press his own candidature. From 1687 he was the leading member of an Exeter committee to administer a fund for presbyterian ministers. He was buried at St Stephen's, Exeter, on 8 October 1693.<br>
