<span class="headword">Lloyd,  William  Watkiss</span>  (1813&#150;1893), <span class="occ">classical and literary scholar</span>, the second son of David Lloyd of Newcastle under Lyme, was born at Homerton, Middlesex, on 11 March 1813. He was educated at the grammar school in Newcastle under Lyme, and made so much progress that the master, the Revd John Anderton, offered to contribute towards the fees of a university course. At the age of fifteen, however, he was placed in the counting-house of his cousins' tobacco manufacturing firm, Messrs John and Francis Lloyd, at 77 Snow Hill, London, where he stayed, rising to become a partner, until he retired from business in 1864. For a period of thirty-six years his days were devoted to uncongenial duties and his nights to books. At one time he lived at Snow Hill, and for many years never left London. With an inborn love for learning he added to a solid basis of Greek and Latin a wide knowledge of modern languages and literatures, as well as of ancient art, history, and archaeology. To these pursuits every leisure hour, even to the close of his life, was applied. The first-fruit of his studies was a historical and mythological essay entitled &#145;The Xanthian marbles: the Nereid monument&#146; (1845), followed by other contributions on subjects of Greek antiquities, some printed in the <span class="italic">Classical Museum</span>. In 1854 he supplied certain &#145;Arguments&#146; to Owen Jones's <span class="italic">Apology for the Colouring of the Greek Court in the Crystal Palace</span>. In the same year he was elected a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92790', "Society of Dilettanti")</script>, chiefly through the friendly offices of Monckton Milnes (afterwards Lord Houghton). Until his death he &#145;was one of the principal guides and advisers of the Dilettanti in their archaeological undertakings&#146;  (Cust, 187, 206), and acted temporarily as secretary and treasurer in 1888 and 1889.<br>
<br>As a labour of love Lloyd supplied essays on the life and plays of Shakespeare to S. W. Singer's edition of the poet published in 1856 (2nd edn, 1875). The essays show acute criticism and thorough knowledge of Elizabethan literature, and were collected by the author in a private reprint (1858, and reissued without the life in 1875 and 1888). A memoir on the system of proportion employed in the design of ancient Greek temples was added by him to C. R. Cockerell's <span class="italic">Temples of Jupiter Panhellenius at Aegina and of Apollo Epicurius</span>, published in 1860. The subject was also treated in <span class="italic">A general theory of proportion in architectural design and its exemplification in detail in the Parthenon, with illustrative engravings</span> (1863), a lecture delivered before the Royal Institute of British Architects on 13 June 1859, and his most original work. His literary interests then turned in a different direction, and he published <span class="italic">The Moses of Michael Angelo: a Study of Art, History, and Legend</span> (1863), followed by <span class="italic">Christianity in the Cartoons, Referred to Artistic Treatment and Historic Fact</span> (1865), in which artistic criticism is coupled with a free treatment of religious matters, and <span class="italic">Philosophy, Theology, and Poetry in the Age and Art of Rafael</span> (1866). In 1868 he married Ellen Brooker (<i>d</i>. 1900), second daughter of Lionel John Beale, and sister of Lionel Smith Beale. Ancient Greek history and art were the subjects of his next two publications: <span class="italic">The History of Sicily to the Athenian War, with Elucidations of the Sicilian Odes of Pindar</span> (1872), and <span class="italic">The Age of Pericles: a History of the Politics and Arts of Greece from the Persian to the Peloponnesian War</span> (1875), the second a complete conception of the social life and art of Greece at its highest point. In 1882 he delivered four lectures on the <span class="italic">Iliad</span> and <span class="italic">Odyssey</span> at the Royal Institution, of which he acted as one of the managers from 1879 to 1881. He was elected a member of the Athenaeum in 1875, and for many years was an active member of the committee of the London Library. He was a correspondent of the archaeological societies of Rome and Palermo.<br>
<br>Lloyd died at 43 Upper Gloucester Place, Regent's Park, on 22 December 1893 in his eighty-first year, survived by his wife, a son, and a daughter. Watkiss Lloyd was a remarkable instance of a lifelong devotion to learning, stamped by disinterested self-denial. Without a university training, and never recognized by any academic body, he had the strong qualities and some of the weaknesses of the self-taught. His books manifest conscientious industry, originality, and sound scholarship; but while his judgement was solid and his thought clear, he was not endowed with the faculty of expressing his ideas in attractive literary form. Power of condensation and artistic arrangement of materials were wanting. One half of his life was passed in solitude, but during the last half he mixed in the world, and the angularities of the student became softened. He was a charming talker, modest, unpedantic, and a staunch friend. In personal appearance he was tall and impressive; even to the end he was strikingly upright in carriage, and showed few outward signs of his advanced age. Lloyd produced a large number of other publications, including books and articles on ancient and modern architecture, Homer, Pindar, and Shakespeare (all of whose plays he believed were written in blank verse). He also left a large number of unpublished manuscripts, several of which he bequeathed to the British Museum.<br>
