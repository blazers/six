<span class="headword">Asgar the Staller</span>  (<em>d.</em> after 1066), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was, according to the figures given in <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>, the second-richest thegn in pre-conquest England below the rank of earl. His estate of over 300 hides of land was scattered over nine shires, the greatest concentration (some 160 hides) lying in Middlesex, Essex, and Hertfordshire. For these shires and their neighbours <span class="roman">Domesday</span> gives details of dependent relationships, showing how Asgar's wealth had attracted the commendation of many lesser thegns and free men. Even in Cambridgeshire, where he had no land of his own, such men had sought Asgar as lord. Indeed his two most interesting dependants are found there: the pre-conquest sheriff Ordgar, who sought Asgar's protection after 1066; and Asgar's steward, Sigar, who retained some of his land in 1086 as a tenant of Asgar's successor, Geoffrey de Mandeville, and was a juror in Thriplow hundred.<br>
<br>Two of Asgar's manors in Middlesex (Enfield and Edmonton with South Mimms) had formerly belonged to his grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52355/', "Tovi the Proud")</script>, patron of Waltham Holy Cross. The twelfth-century Waltham chronicle claims that much of Tovi's land had been lost by his son &AElig;thelstan, Asgar's father, but gives no reason; he may have been involved in the rebellion of Osgod Clapa, an associate of Tovi the Proud, in 1046. Some of the forfeited land, including Lambeth, in Surrey, and Hitchin, in Hertfordshire, passed to Earl Harold, who also took over the patronage of Waltham Holy Cross. Relations between Earl Harold and Asgar seem, however, to have been amicable; Leighs, in Essex, is said to have been given by Asgar to the earl. Nor did his father's disgrace hamper Asgar's career. His position as staller implies that he was a member of the royal household and he attests the Confessor's charters from 1059 to 1066, on occasion as the king's steward (<i>dapifer</i>) and as <i>procurator</i> of the royal household; a number of royal writs also include him in their address-clauses. He may have had some official position in London, possibly as portreeve (an office later held, like Asgar's land, by his Norman supplanter, Geoffrey de Mandeville). The <span class="italic">Carmen de Hastingae proelio</span> has an extraordinary story of Duke William's negotiations with Asgar at London in the aftermath of the battle of Hastings. Asgar, though so badly wounded that he had to be carried on a litter, nevertheless &#145;commanded all the chief men of the city and the affairs of the community&#146;  (<span class="italic">Carmen de Hastingae proelio</span>, lines 685&#150;6); and in order to gain access to the town, Duke William offered him the position of chief councillor in &#145;all the interests of the kingdom&#146;  (ibid., lines 689&#150;90), provided that William himself had merely the name of king. While the details of this tale may be no more than poetic licence, the tradition that Asgar had authority in the city of London may be reliable. What became of him after 1066 is unclear, but the Ely tradition that he was imprisoned by King William might suggest that he was involved in the rising at York in 1069.<br>
