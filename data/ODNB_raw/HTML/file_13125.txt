<span class="headword">Hesketh,  Henry</span>  (1636/7&#150;1710?), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Cheshire. He was admitted as a plebeian to Brasenose College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 26 May 1653, aged sixteen, and graduated BA on 13 October 1656. He was incorporated MA at Cambridge in 1664. He held the living of Ashton upon Mersey, Cheshire, between 1662 and 1663, and Long Ditton, Surrey, from 1662. From 1663 until his death he was rector of Charlwood, Surrey, having married Sarah Mulcaster, the daughter of his predecessor, the year before. In 1677 he bought the complete presentation rights to the church of Sts Peter and Paul in Nutfield, Surrey, which he later sold to William Hollingworth. On 11 November 1678 he was chosen vicar of St Helen, Bishopsgate. He also became chaplain to Charles II. Following the death of his first wife, Hesketh married again on 11 February 1687, at St Helen, Bishopsgate; his second wife was Mary Pillet of that parish.<br>
<br>Hesketh was a popular preacher and several of his sermons were printed, including one given before the lord mayor and aldermen of London on 9 September 1683 after the failure of the Rye House plot, and another given in the Chapel Royal on 26 July 1685, the day of thanksgiving for the defeat of the Monmouth rebellion. In the latter sermon he attacked the distinction both between the private and public person of the king as offering a justification for resistance, and, more controversially, between giving active and passive obedience. It was not loyalty, he argued, simply to disobey the laws but submit to their penalties. He also produced a number of other works, including a case of conscience, <span class="italic">The Charge of Scandal and Giving Offence by Conformity</span> (1683), which aimed at convincing nonconformists to return to the Church of England. He argued in this case that dissenters were already committing a greater sin, that of schism, by separating from the Anglican church than they could possibly incur by conforming and perhaps offering a scandalous example to others.<br>
<br>In spite of his earlier preaching efforts in support of James II, Hesketh took the oaths to William and Mary and enjoyed ecclesiastical promotion under the new regime. He never offered any explanation for this dramatic volte-face. He was appointed chaplain to King William and in 1690 he was nominated, but not consecrated, bishop of Killala. In January 1694 he resigned the vicarage of St Helen, Bishopsgate. He appears to have died in December 1710.<br>
