<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cooke,  Charles Wallwyn Radcliffe</span>  (1840&#150;1911), <span class="occ">politician and promoter of cider making</span>, was born at Hellens manor house, Much Marcle, Herefordshire, on 16 January 1840, the son and only surviving child of Robert Duffield Cooke (1795/6&#150;1882), landowner and farmer, and his wife, Mary Anne (1797/8&#150;1871), daughter of Edward Wallwyn, through whose family the Hellens property had descended. Educated privately, he matriculated in 1860 from Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he was elected a scholar and gained a second class in the moral sciences tripos in 1863, graduating BA in 1864. At Cambridge he won the university's Le Bas (1864) and Burney (1865) prizes for English essays. He had a reputation as a parodist, publishing a spoof undergraduate diary, purportedly of Samuel Pepys (1866), and a collection, <span class="italic">Thoughts on Men and Things</span> (1871), under the pseudonym Angelina Gushington. Admitted at Lincoln's Inn in 1869, he was called to the bar in 1872 and practised on the Oxford circuit. On 20 September 1876 he married Frances Parnther Broome (1850&#150;1891), daughter of J. H. Broome, vicar of Houghton, Norfolk. They had a son and three daughters.<br>
<br>Radcliffe Cooke, as he was generally known in public life, retired from legal practice on his father's death in 1882, when he inherited the family property at Hellens, Much Marcle, where he farmed and pursued his political interests. An active campaigner for the Conservative party at the general election of 1880, he was concerned at the party's lack of both organization and platform speakers to counter the Liberals. In an attempt to reinvigorate the party he founded the Constitutional Union, which aimed to bring together a younger generation of Conservatives. The party leadership encouraged him to seek a parliamentary seat, and he was elected for Newington West, in south London, at the general election of 1885 on a programme favouring imperial federation. He retained the seat until retiring in 1892, following his wife's death. On 15 April 1893 he married Katherine (1862/3&#150;1931), youngest daughter of George Coles, landowner, of Ventnor; they had one son. Early in August 1893 a vacancy in the Hereford city parliamentary seat arose when the sitting Gladstonian Liberal member W. H. Grenfell decided that he could no longer support his party's policy of Irish home rule. Standing as a Conservative, Cooke won the seat at the ensuing by-election, and sat as member for the city until his retirement in 1900.<br>
<br>Radcliffe Cooke recorded his impressions as a new MP in <span class="italic">Four Years in Parliament with Hard Labour</span> (1890). Its amusing account of the peculiarities of parliamentary life, and the unexpected demands on MPs&#151;arranging schoolchildren's visits to parliament and presiding over sporting clubs&#151;brought it reprintings. His maiden speech, in February 1886, opposing William Woodall's bill to extend the parliamentary suffrage to women, set the tone for his Commons career, his intervention being punctuated by laughter. In February 1897 he moved the rejection of the second reading of the women's suffrage bill introduced by Faithfull Begg when, for the first time, the House of Commons voted in favour of extending the franchise to women. He emphasized the small membership of the suffrage societies, and offered an extreme statement of the &#145;separate spheres&#146; argument for withholding the vote from women, contending that as men made the material framework upon which the state, empire, and even civilization were based, they should govern. Opponents relished drawing attention to his own reliance on women Primrose League canvassers during his election campaigns in Hereford. In a subsequent published exchange, the suffragist leader Millicent Fawcett, who reproved his jocular attitude to the subject, gave his arguments short shrift. Even sympathetic observers considered that his tendency to levity limited his success in parliament.<br>
<br>If Radcliffe Cooke lent little weight to the anti-suffrage cause, his energetic advocacy of the cider industry, which earned him the title the &#145;Member for Cider&#146;, had more tangible results. As a Herefordshire landowner and farmer active in local affairs&#151;he was chairman of the Herefordshire chamber of agriculture, founder of the Herefordshire Cattle Breeders' Association, a county councillor, and a promoter of friendly societies in the county&#151;he was keenly aware of the problems facing agriculture during the depression years of the late nineteenth century. There were signs, however, of the potential for reviving the cider industry, which had been in a long decline. Through articles in <span class="italic">The Field</span>, to which he was a longstanding contributor, and letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span> and Hereford newspapers, he publicized to farmers and landowners the economic potential of orchard cultivation and cider and perry making.<br>
<br>Radcliffe Cooke was a prime mover, in 1894, in the foundation of the National Association of English Cider Makers to promote cider and fruit growing, and to assist producers by, for example, negotiating reductions in what farmers regarded as the excessive freight charges levied by railway companies. In his evidence to the royal commission on agriculture in April 1895 he made the case for state assistance in the form of experimental fruit farms, grants to assist the planting of orchards, and encouragements to smallholders. One outcome was the foundation in 1903 of the National Fruit and Cider Institute at Long Ashton, near Bristol, which received grants from the board of agriculture and county councils to undertake research into the best systems of cultivation and manufacturing, and disseminate specialist knowledge, so that cider making could be placed on the same scientific basis as brewing. He was a member of the departmental committee appointed by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries to investigate the British fruit industry, whose report in 1905 noted the impetus which the revival of cider making had given to fruit growing.<br>
<br>These initiatives were a response to the political reality, which Radcliffe Cooke noted in his <span class="italic">Book about Cider and Perry</span> (1898), that parliament was unlikely to restore tariff protection to farmers. Agriculturists needed to respond by increasing the saleable products of the soil, and stimulating demand for them. He believed that cider provided such an opportunity, especially to small farmers for whom an orchard might yield a valuable crop and a cider-press a marketable product. But he insisted on the importance of quality, deploring the existing practice of using inferior varieties and damaged fruit, and haphazard, unhygienic methods of fruit storage and fermentation, which, together with adulteration, had harmed the reputation of the drink among consumers. He particularly urged the cultivation of those &#145;vintage&#146; varieties of apples and pears that were especially suitable for cider and perry production, and advocated rigorous cleanliness throughout the manufacturing process.<br>
<br>Radcliffe Cooke promoted cider and perry as potentially the regional wines of England (and Ireland) and saw an opportunity for small producers to supply niche markets, urging the country gentry to serve the local vintages at their tables; he ensured that Herefordshire cider was stocked in the bars at the Houses of Parliament. He also envisaged large-scale production of a more standardized product, of reliable quality, which could supply a mass market. He emphasized cider's health-enhancing qualities, pointing out that Herefordshire had experienced no recorded cases of Asiatic cholera. In his survey of English agriculture Rider Haggard visited Radcliffe Cooke's own cider mill at Hellens and admired the owner's tireless advocacy of the beverage, though baulked at his&#151;possibly flippant&#151;dietary recommendation that six unpeeled apples and a pint of cider should be consumed nightly before retiring to bed. Radcliffe Cooke's final contribution was the entry on cider (1910) in the eleventh edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, where he noted with satisfaction a doubling in production of cider and perry in the space of fifteen years.<br>
<br>Radcliffe Cooke could claim some credit for the boom in cider consumption at the turn of the twentieth century. His altruism on behalf of the industry was briefly called into question in 1898, when he advertised his own cider business; existing producers, rallied by Fred Bulmer (a radical, and opponent, in Hereford politics), accused him of using his privileged position to enter into competition with them, claims that subsided when the small scale of his operations became apparent. Rather, his entry into the trade reflected the financial problems that dogged his later years, which he claimed were brought about by his preoccupation with politics to the neglect of his personal interests. Although he continued to campaign as a Unionist free trader, and was latterly active in the National Service League, he was disappointed that the Conservative leadership had overlooked his services to the party and had failed to promote him to any official position. Following the party's defeat in the 1906 general election he attacked the aristocratic dominance of ministerial positions in the governments of Lord Salisbury and Balfour, and argued for the payment of MPs by the state  (<span class="italic">National Review</span>, March 1907).<br>
<br>By 1909, when a public testimonial of &pound;175 was presented to him on behalf of the county of Hereford for his services to cider and fruit growing, Radcliffe Cooke could no longer afford to remain at Hellens manor house. Hellens was let to tenants, and he moved his household to Westbury, St Andrew's Road, Great Malvern, Worcestershire, where he died on 26 May 1911, having suffered from heart disease. He was buried at Much Marcle where a memorial inscription in the parish church records that he &#145;restored a principal industry of his native county&#146;. Among those who paid tribute to him was his friend and neighbour Henry Weston (1850&#150;1917) of Bounds Farm, Much Marcle, whose own successful diversification into commercial cider making exemplified Radcliffe Cooke's vision for the industry.<br>
