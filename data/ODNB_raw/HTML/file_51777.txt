<span class="headword">Doreck,  Beata</span>  (1833&#150;1875), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born on 5 February 1833 in Mannheim, in the grand duchy of Baden, Germany, daughter of Herr Doreck, a jeweller. Her father provided her with a good education but he was opposed to her wish to train as a teacher, having the financial resources to enable her to remain at home without the need for employment. Her determination in pursuing her chosen career is evidence of her early sense of vocation. Beata spent three years at the normal school of Riboville, Alsace, and then went to nearby Colmar where she was examined for her diploma in teaching. Although she was only nineteen, her performance in the examination was so impressive that she was declared competent to take charge of a school without a period of probation, but she had already decided to go to England to take up a post as governess in a private family.<br>
<br>Beata Doreck arrived in England in 1857 and remained in this post for three years although it was not a happy period:<blockquote>It was her lot in this family to fall into the hands of employers who had neither the intelligence to appreciate nor the generosity to reward the remarkable talents which she devoted to her work. She often spoke, in after years, of the unworthy treatment she received while carrying out this engagement. (Payne, 157)</blockquote>She spent the next few years as a daily governess before opening her own school in 1866 at 1 Kildare Terrace, Bayswater, London, moving to 63 Kensington Gardens Square, Bayswater, in 1869.<br>
<br>During the 1850s England was a place of refuge for liberal Germans fleeing the repression of democratic activity following the failed uprising of 1848&#150;9. Froebel's ideas had been adopted by this group and the first kindergartens, opened in London and Manchester, were German speaking. However as Froebel's ideas became more widely known so a demand grew for kindergartens for English children. A major problem was the lack of English teachers who understood Froebel's ideas. At this time none of Froebel's works had been translated and very few English commentaries existed. It was recognized that the kindergarten movement needed the involvement of English teachers if it was to develop fully, although Maria Grey, in her address to the Froebel Society, 5 December 1876, acknowledged that &#145;Miss Doreck had lived long enough in England to understand the national peculiarities of thought and feeling&#146;  (p. 1).<br>
<br>The difficulties in finding suitable staff for the kindergarten she added to her existing school for girls and preparatory school for boys, led Beata Doreck to use her influence with her English and German colleagues to bring about the formation of the Froebel Society. The first meeting, chaired by her, was held at 63 Kensington Gardens Square on 4 November 1874, and she was subsequently elected president of the committee whose members included two of her close friends and colleagues, Frances Mary Buss and Joseph Payne. <span class="italic">The Report of the Froebel Society for the Promotion of the Kindergarten System</span>, June 1875, listed the methods by which the society hoped to achieve its aims, including lectures, public meetings, publications, specimen illustrations of kindergarten work, a register of kindergarten teachers, the establishment of a model kindergarten, and the formation of training classes. In addition, the members were to present papers at the monthly meetings and contact was maintained with Froebelian colleagues overseas.<br>
<br>Beata Doreck had been elected to the council of the College of Preceptors in June 1871 at the suggestion of Frances Mary Buss, who once said, &#145;We shall not have thorough education till we have the Kindergarten&#146;  (Ridley, 275). Perhaps the most important collaboration between the two women, who shared a great interest in teacher training, was the proposal presented to the College of Preceptors in October 1872 to establish a &#145;training class of lectures and lessons for teachers&#146;. The college subsequently established the professorship of the science and arts of education, to which Joseph Payne was appointed in January 1873. Payne commented that Beata Doreck was largely responsible for the details of the scheme. In September 1873 she and Frances Mary Buss were elected fellows of the college, the first two women to receive the honour. In April 1874 they both formed part of a deputation to the duke of Richmond, the minister responsible for education in Disraeli's administration, urging him to establish a training college for teachers, on a par with the College of Surgeons and the law institutions, under the auspices of the College of Preceptors.<br>
<br>Beata Doreck was also an early supporter of the Girls' Public Day School Company, founded in 1872, and bought shares in it, although the company's plan to open a school at Notting Hill near to her own was a potential threat to her livelihood. She was also involved in the work of the Schoolmistresses' Association and served as president for a year (1873&#150;4). She supported her own young teachers, mainly from the poorer middle class, by paying their college fees and before her death planned to take aspiring teachers into her home and to train them herself for a nominal fee. No written exposition of her ideas seems to have survived but a detailed account of her paper, <span class="italic">The Kindergarten in Relation to the School</span>, presented to the Froebel Society on 13 April 1875, is given in the society's minutes. The title refers to the Froebelian concept of harmony of development and the paper criticizes the abrupt break between kindergarten and school under the existing system. A preparatory transition class, incorporating the teaching of reading and writing, was desirable, and she argued that Froebel's principles were applicable to the teaching of <i>all</i> school subjects.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1875 Beata Doreck made a recuperative trip to Switzerland accompanied by her sister Anna Roth, Mme Dickerdorf, and Harriet Mann, a member of her staff. She fell ill with a fever at Interlaken and died at the Hotel Interlaken on 12 September 1875. &#145;&#147;Overwork&#148; was the emphatic comment on her case pronounced by the physician who attended her dying bed&#146;  (Payne, 157).<br>
