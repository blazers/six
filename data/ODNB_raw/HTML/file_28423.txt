<span class="headword">Wakeman <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Wiche]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1549), <span class="occ">abbot of Tewkesbury and bishop of Gloucester</span>, was probably born in Worcestershire. He was educated at Oxford, where he supplicated for the degree of BTh in 1511. He had been ordained acolyte in 1501, deacon in 1503, and priest in 1504, but otherwise little is known about him before he entered Tewkesbury Abbey in 1531. In all likelihood he had been a Benedictine monk for some time, since he soon became prior and was elected abbot on 27 April 1534. This was a turbulent time for monasticism in England, and impending religious change would be the main challenge facing the new abbot. On 31 March 1534, just a month before he gained royal assent to his election, Wakeman joined with others attending a meeting of convocation in subscribing to the royal supremacy, and in August 1535 Cromwell's commissioners arrived to &#145;peruse the inventory, appropriations and other muniments&#146; of Tewkesbury Abbey  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 9.3). Five and a half years later the information gained during that visit would facilitate the surrender of that house.<br>
<br>In the intervening years Wakeman seems to have done all in his power to mitigate the possible future damage to his community and to his own career. His election as abbot, however, seems to have been the subject of some concern since he subsequently expressed his gratitude to both Thomas Cromwell and Sir William Kingston, constable of the Tower and a prominent figure among the Gloucestershire gentry, for their support. Wakeman sent Kingston a letter of thanks, but he gave Cromwell a gelding and &pound;5 towards the purchase of a saddle. Wakeman then had the opportunity to demonstrate his loyalty to the king by receiving Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn during their progress through Gloucestershire in the summer of 1535. In the end, however, John Wakeman was not able to prevent the dissolution of his monastery, and he surrendered the abbey to Cromwell's commissioners on 9 January 1540. His ecclesiastical career was none the less to continue. On 3 September 1541 the diocese of Gloucester was established, with John Wakeman as its first bishop. Perhaps his efforts to ingratiate himself had been a success, or quite possibly his administrative experience and knowledge of the region made him the best candidate.<br>
<br>To some scholars it appears that Wakeman was given the bishopric as something of a &#145;retirement package&#146;, perhaps in thanks for some perceived loyalty during the tumultuous 1530s. In any event he repaid the king for his appointment by dutifully conforming to the changing official religious policies of Henry's last years, and by visiting his diocese on a regular basis. None the less, Wakeman's episcopate was less energetic than those of either his predecessors, Hugh Latimer and John Bell, in the diocese of Worcester, or his successor, John Hooper, in the diocese of Gloucester. Bishop Wakeman did conduct the requisite visitations, but there is no evidence of vigour. Perhaps he was a &#145;time-server&#146;, merely going through the motions and occupying the office of bishop to fund his retirement, or maybe his actions reflected the apparent ambiguity in official religion during that portion of Henry's reign. However, his performance as bishop can be read in another way. He was the first bishop of a new and very poor diocese. It may have taken some time to establish the ecclesiastical structure needed to administer the see effectively. Early in Edward VI's reign Wakeman conducted a more thorough visitation, perhaps owing to the increased clarity of religious policy under Protector Somerset. On the other hand, the difference may have been a result of the establishment over the previous seven years of a more effective diocesan administrative structure. In either case, the later visitation still fell far short of the standards set by Latimer or Bell, and Wakeman seems to have continued to turn a blind eye to traditional practices which he was supposed to discourage as harmful, even though they were not explicitly forbidden.<br>
<br>Focusing on Wakeman's episcopal administration, however, may misrepresent his role in the religious life of mid-Tudor England. Thomas Cranmer valued his learning sufficiently to ask him to participate in the project to create a new English translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and he was one of nine bishops chosen to &#145;attend upon the conduct of &hellip; [Henry VIII's] corps&#146; during the king's funeral  (Strype, 2/2, 291). John Wakeman's own death came in Forthampton, Gloucestershire, on 6 December 1549, nearly three years after Henry's, and he was probably buried in a small private chapel there. He had drawn up his will on 30 July that year, appointing as his executors his brothers Thomas and Richard, and making bequests to three nephews and a niece, as well as to servants. He also left 20 nobles to one Thomas Poyner, a student at Magdalen College, Oxford. Wakeman died a dutiful member of the English ecclesiastical hierarchy, but although he was careful to bequeath his soul to the Trinity alone, he was definitely not a proponent of evangelical reform.<br>
