<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Aston,  Francis William</span>  (1877&#150;1945), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born at Church Lane, Harborne, near Birmingham on 1 September 1877, the third of the seven children of William Aston, gun manufacturer, and his wife, Fanny Charlotte, daughter of Isaac Hollis, a gunmaker. From Harborne vicarage school he went to Malvern College and, in 1893, entered Mason College, Birmingham, to study for the London intermediate science examination. For some years he had had a workshop and a makeshift laboratory of his own in his father's house, and by the time he was awarded the Forster scholarship in 1898, to work with P. F. Frankland on the stereochemistry of dipyromucyltartaric acid esters, he was already an accomplished experimenter and a skilled glass-blower. During the tenure of his scholarship he was able also to take a course in fermentation chemistry, and between 1900 and 1903 worked as a chemist in a Wolverhampton brewery. During this period he continued his own work in his private laboratory in his spare time.<br>
<br>Already having considerable experience in high-vacuum technique, Aston became interested in the construction of X-ray tubes of novel design and in the phenomena of gas discharges at low pressure. This work attracted the attention of J. H. Poynting, professor of physics in the University of Birmingham (as Mason College had become), and in 1903 Aston became a research student in Poynting's department. In 1908 he detected a new &#145;primary cathode dark space&#146;; a phenomenon which now bears his name.<br>
<br>In 1909 Aston travelled round the world by way of Ceylon, Malaya, Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific islands, the United States, and Canada. He then held&#151;for one term&#151;a lectureship in physics at Birmingham. The brief appointment revealed him to be a reluctant (and rather poor) teacher, and in January 1910 he accepted the position of research assistant to Sir J. J. Thomson at the Cavendish Laboratory. He also became a member of Trinity College, Cambridge&#151;his home for the rest of his life. Thomson had been working on positive rays since 1906, and by 1910 he had reached the stage of applying the method of crossed electric and magnetic deflections in order to obtain the characteristic &#145;parabolas&#146; by means of which the first mass-analysis of the rays was achieved. Aston quickly made significant improvements to Thomson's apparatus and developed a camera capable of photographing the observed parabolas. Using the improved instrument, Aston became convinced that the technique provided solid proof that all molecules of a given substance shared an identical mass. However, in 1912, Thomson obtained two parabolas (mass 20 and mass 22) for neon. It seemed likely that this second line (assuming an atomic weight for neon of 20 rather than the commonly accepted 20.2) was either a neon hydride or a discrete element&#151;meta-neon. Thomson examined the first possibility, while Aston attempted to separate meta-neon by fractional distillation (inventing an extremely accurate quartz microbalance in the process). In 1913, the year he became a Clerk Maxwell scholar, he announced partial separation of a new element, with properties identical to neon. However, the First World War now interrupted work, and Aston went to Farnborough as a technical assistant at the Royal Aircraft Establishment.<br>
<br>The break gave Aston time to consider the neon problem afresh. In 1913 Frederick Soddy had postulated the existence of isotopes of radioactive elements in <span class="italic">Nature</span>, and Aston now began to suspect that natural isotopes of other elements might exist. On returning to Cambridge in 1919 to test this hypothesis, he developed the instrument that became known as the mass spectrograph, a huge improvement over Thomson's apparatus. Both electric and magnetic fields now caused deflections of the positive rays (ion beam) to occur in the same plane, with the deflection of the ions proportional to their charge to mass ratio (<i>e</i>/<i>m</i>). In striking a photographic plate these deflected ions then exposed a series of lines (the mass spectrum), where the position of the line represented an ion's mass and the intensity was proportional to its relative abundance in the original ion beam. Using the instrument, Aston showed that neon produced two spectral lines at mass 20 and 22, the former ten times more intense than the latter. Neon had two stable isotopes.<br>
<br>Using the mass spectrograph all the elements available in simple gaseous form were analysed within a very short time. The results with neon were confirmed, and the instrument was sufficiently accurate to show that the chemical atomic weight of the element was very likely to represent the average mass of all the atoms in the normal isotopic mixture. Not only elements such as chlorine of which the chemical atomic weight is far from integral on the oxygen scale, but others like bromine with a much more nearly integral atomic weight were shown to be mixtures of two or more species: the phenomenon of isotopy was in fact established as one of the basic phenomena of nature. Significant regularities emerged naturally from these observations&#151;the whole number rule, stating effectively that the masses of all atoms are integral multiples of the mass of the atom of hydrogen to an accuracy of at least 1 per cent, and the rule of odd and even, recording the fact that the mass numbers of the isotopes of odd-numbered elements are almost always odd and those of even-numbered elements predominantly even. These regularities were developed and given further precision as the result of later work, but from the first they contained the germs of significant truth.<br>
<br>Widespread acclamation greeted the publication of Aston's astoundingly simple but entirely revolutionary results, and honours came quickly. In 1920 he was elected first holder of one of the newly created research fellowships at Trinity College and received the Mackenzie Davidson medal of the R&ouml;ntgen Society; in 1921 he was elected FRS; in 1922 he received the Hughes medal of the Royal Society and the Nobel prize for chemistry; and in 1923 he was awarded the John Scott medal (Philadelphia) and the Italian Paterno medal, as well as being elected fellow of the (Royal) Institute of Chemistry and made an honorary LLD of the University of Birmingham. In 1922 he published his seminal <span class="italic">Isotopes</span>; it was followed in 1923 by <span class="italic">Mass-Spectra and Isotopes</span>.<br>
<br>Having obtained all the information on isotopes which his instrument could give by way of mass-analysis of the positive rays produced in gas discharges, Aston turned his attention for the next few years to the metallic elements. The technique here was more difficult, but he gradually mastered the art of producing &#145;accelerated anode rays&#146; and by 1925 analyses of fifty-six elements had been made. By this time a further generalization became obvious: odd-numbered elements are either simple elements or are constituted of two isotopes only. The distinction between even- and odd-numbered elements thus became more clearly discerned, for even-numbered elements frequently have many more isotopes than two.<br>
<br>In 1927 Aston was Bakerian lecturer of the Royal Society. He had just completed his second mass spectrograph and had obtained the first results with its aid. The resolving power of his original instrument had been insufficient for successful work with the heaviest elements and its precision of measurement was about 1 part in 1000. In the new instrument resolving power was improved by a factor of five, and accuracy had improved to 1 in 10,000; it showed the whole-number rule to be only approximate and the way lay open for a direct check of the Einstein law of equivalence of mass and energy. The application of the method of photometric comparison of intensities of mass-spectrum lines in 1930 made available for the first time a purely physical method of precision for the determination of chemical atomic weights. In the years 1927 to 1935 a complete resurvey of the elements was made with the new spectrograph and Aston's essential contribution to the subject was complete. In the latter year he further improved his spectrograph, increasing its accuracy of measurement by another large factor, but now many younger men were active in similar work and with the outbreak of war in 1939 he soon abandoned regular experimenting.<br>
<br>Aston's whole life was dominated by hobbies. That his research was a hobby is evident from the fact that he worked alone, never taking on a research student for help or training. (Indeed, only six of his 143 papers were collaborative efforts.) Travel was a lifelong hobby, particularly in order to observe an eclipse. Photography and the care of the Trinity College clock were scientific hobbies, music and the collection of Chinese porcelain cultural hobbies, and at various stages of his life cycling, motoring, tennis, swimming, skiing, and golf took him out of doors with enthusiasm&#151;and often with reward. He was also, for a time, music critic for the <span class="italic">Cambridge Review</span>.<br>
<br>Aston continued to receive many honours, including foreign membership of the academy of sciences of the USSR (1925) and the Accademia dei Lincei (1926), the honorary degrees of DSc (Dublin, 1929), PhD (Freiburg, 1930; Benares, 1937), and DL (Calcutta, 1938), a Royal medal of the Royal Society (1938), the Joykissen Mookherjee medal (Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, 1938), and the Duddell medal (Physical Society, 1944). He was president of the mathematics and physics section of the British Association in 1935. He died, unmarried, at the Evelyn Nursing Home, Cambridge on 20 November 1945. He left a large estate to Trinity College and several scientific organizations.<br>
