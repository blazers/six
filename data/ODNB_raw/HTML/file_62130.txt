<span class="headword">Barlas,  John Evelyn</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Evelyn Douglas]</span>  (1860&#150;1914), <span class="occ">poet and anarchist&#150;communist</span>, was born in Rangoon, Burma, on 13 July 1860, the third and only surviving son of John Barlas (1826&#150;1861), a merchant in the East Indies, and his wife, Elizabeth Anne (1835&#150;1878), the daughter of William Davis, a civil servant of the mint in Calcutta. Barlas was a direct descendant of the fifteenth-century Scots heroine Kate Douglas, who was known as Barlass, and also a distant relative of George Gilfillan on his mother's side. Barlas was barely a year old when his father died suddenly of apoplexy, and his mother took him back to Glasgow. By 1874, however, mother and son were living at 8 Belsize Crescent, London. Barlas first briefly attended St John's Wood School and then, in December 1874, entered the Merchant Taylors' School, where he stayed for three years, winning the Sir James Tyler English history prize for 1875. After his mother's death in 1878, Barlas took rooms in Great Russell Street, London, to study by himself. His earnest study of Marxist literature at the same time led to his conversion to socialism. He then went up as a commoner to New College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 16 October 1879.<br>
<br>Barlas was conspicuous at Oxford for his uncompromisingly radical views, for his extremely handsome and athletic personality, and for his histrionic talents. He was self-respecting and independent-minded in thought and action, and, although he characterized himself as &#145;one of those horrid proud people&#146;, in a letter of 1885 to Andr&eacute; Raffalovich, he was a humane person and a gentleman. He was thought to be an aristocrat in those days, possessing some &pound;20,000, with which he often assisted friends in need. Robert Harborough Sherard, his contemporary at New College and a lifelong friend, admits that he himself was saved by Barlas from death by starvation on more than one occasion. It was while Barlas was still an undergraduate that, on 25 June 1881, his early and romantic marriage took place, by special licence, to the beautiful Rangoon-born Eveline Honoria Nelson Davies (1861&#150;1934), a great-grandniece of Admiral Lord Nelson and fourth daughter of Horatio Nelson Davies, assistant commissioner at Thayetmyo, Burma. According to an unsubstantiated rumour, Barlas had literally carried away his future wife from a ship at Southampton bound for Burma, to which country she had been summoned by her father. Their first child, Evelyn Adelaide Isabella, was born in May 1882. In the same year he also entered the Middle Temple to become a barrister, but after keeping only four terms abandoned the idea of a legal career.<br>
<br>Having obtained his BA (a second class in <i>literae humaniores</i>) in 1884, Barlas went to Ireland, as professor of languages&#151;he was widely read in classical literature and in Hebrew, French, German, and Greek&#151;to St Stanislaus Roman Catholic College at Rahan, Tullamore. Here life was tranquil and he continued to write verse, a passion that had begun in 1876 while on a summer holiday in Yarmouth. However, in June 1885, three-year-old Evelyn died, and he and his wife returned to England, where Barlas obtained the post of assistant classical master at the local grammar school in Chelmsford, Essex, where he was regarded as a brilliant and inspiring teacher. He also made his presence felt in a different way, when he started a socialist society in Chelmsford, and was often seen distributing anarchist literature and preaching the socialist creed in public places, sporting a red ribbon in his buttonhole. He still found time to write poems or sonnets every day. In November their son Ernest Douglas Montague was born in his maternal grandparents' home in Lee, Kent.<br>
<br>Barlas left Chelmsford in December 1886, and apparently went to Crieff&#151;by now his family home. The months he spent in Perthshire were enlivened by his friendship with a fellow Scottish poet, John Davidson, the music critic and composer Frank Leibich, and E. T. Peberdy&#151;all of whom were teachers at the local Morrison's academy. His sixth book, <span class="italic">Bird-Notes</span> (1887) was dedicated to Peberdy and Davidson in memory of &#145;Happy days in the Highlands gladdened by the two best things in life&#151;Music and Literature&#146;. It is not known exactly when Barlas arrived in Egham, Surrey, where briefly he coached students in the army examination, but he was to remain at Vine Cottage, in nearby Englefield Green, until mid-1891. It was while he was there that a correspondence began with the poet John Gray, later Canon Gray, which continued until the end of 1892 and which saw the regular exchange of letters and their latest poems in manuscript.<br>
<br>As a socialist and supporter of the working classes, Barlas toured the country after leaving Chelmsford, preaching socialism, and offering help in getting up demonstrations in support of striking workers. Reputedly, Barlas was a good speaker and an able organizer. He was one of the demonstrators at Trafalgar Square on &#145;bloody Sunday&#146;, 13 November 1887, and received a severe blow to the head from a police truncheon and fell unconscious, bleeding profusely, at the feet of fellow-demonstrator Eleanor Marx. The blow caused permanent damage&#151;lifelong bouts of delirium and depression, and it was during one such bout of depression that, on the morning of 31 December 1891, Barlas fired a number of revolver shots near the Speaker's Green, at the House of Commons, announcing himself as an anarchist whose action had been to show his contempt for parliamentary democracy. He was promptly taken into custody by the police and a fortnight later his friends Oscar Wilde and H. H. Champion of the Social Democratic Federation stood surety for him, when Barlas was bound over to keep the peace. However, his mental state deteriorated and by September 1892 he was an inmate of James Murray's Royal Asylum, Perth. In March 1893 he was discharged, cured, but about a year later he was admitted to Gartnavel Royal Asylum near Glasgow, where he died twenty years later. According to a letter written to R. H. Sherard on 18 July 1914, during this period he wrote twenty-three dramas, twenty volumes of lyrics, an unspecified number of novels, and other writings. The present whereabouts of these manuscripts, however, as well as that of an unpublished autobiography, which A. J. A. Symons had seen about 1930, remain a mystery.<br>
<br>Of Barlas's eight known volumes of verses and dramas, seven appeared under the pseudonym Evelyn Douglas, and <span class="italic">Holy of Holies: Confessions of an Anarchist</span> (1887) was published anonymously. His first two volumes were issued through Tr&uuml;bner &amp; Co., London, but the rest of his works were printed at provincial presses in Chelmsford and Dundee, at his own expense and mostly for private circulation. They were reviewed neither widely nor well. However, in 1895 George Meredith praised Barlas's sonnets for their &#145;nobility of sentiment&#146; and maintained that they placed him in &#145;a high rank among the poets of his time&#146;. The first major writer to appreciate Barlas's work in print was the humanitarian and socialist author Henry S. Salt, contributing &#145;The poetry of John Barlas&#146; to <span class="italic">The Yellow Book</span>  (vol. 11, October 1896, 79&#150;90). It appears that Salt knew Barlas from the early days of the Social Democratic Federation, either personally or through his writings, since he included a selection of Barlas's poems in <span class="italic">Songs of Freedom</span>, an anthology he edited in 1893. Barlas's correspondence with Salt (some seventy letters) led Salt to declare that Barlas was also a thinker. He also visited Barlas at Gartnavel Asylum and, in 1925, edited a selection of his poems. Remembering Barlas in an autobiographical volume, Salt called him &#145;the Keats of the Socialist movement&#146;  (Salt). Other admirers of Barlas's work include Oscar Wilde; the American writer Hamlin Garland; the poet Ralph Hodgson; and Ramsay MacDonald, the future prime minister.<br>
<br>The most remarkable feature of Barlas's work is the conspicuous absence of his socialist and anarchist beliefs, which he so fervently preached in public life. Love&#151;of natural beauty, of a woman, of liberty and intellectual freedom&#151;and a notion of universal brotherhood are his chief themes. He possessed a fresh lyrical gift, an intense imagination, and original thought, with a masterly flair for painting word pictures. His shorter poems are delicate and simple, written with an effortless ease and admirable skill. His longer and descriptive poems are picturesque and fascinating.<br>
<br>Barlas died on 15 August 1914, of valvular disease of the heart. He was buried four days later in Glasgow necropolis. His widow died in 1934, and his only son, Ernest, died in 1952, after a successful career as a solicitor. His grandson, Richard Douglas, who died in 1982, retired as senior clerk in the House of Commons, having been knighted in recognition of his services to that very parliamentary democracy for which his grandfather had such great contempt.<br>
