<span class="headword">Fowler <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Felkin]</span>,  Ellen Thorneycroft</span>  (1860&#150;1929), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born at Summerfield, Racecourse, Chapel Ash, Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, on 9 April 1860, the elder daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33224/', "Henry Hartley Fowler, first Viscount Wolverhampton (1830&#150;1911)")</script>, and his wife, Ellen (1830&#150;1911), youngest daughter of George Benjamin Thorneycroft. Her sister, <a href="#cosubject_58975">Edith Henrietta Hamilton [<i>see below</i>]</a>, was also a writer. Although the household was strictly Methodist, Ellen Fowler was a member of the Church of England from childhood. She was educated at home for the most part, but at the age of seventeen attended Laleham School, Middlesex, for about one year. Until her marriage on 16 April 1903 to Alfred Laurence Felkin (1856&#150;1942), an inspector of schools, she lived at home with her parents at Woodthorne, Wolverhampton.<br>
<br>Ellen Fowler's first publication, <span class="italic">Songs and Sonnets</span> (1888), was followed by <span class="italic">Verses, Grave and Gay</span> (1891), and <span class="italic">Verses, Wise or Otherwise</span> (1895). In 1898 she won public commendation with her novel <span class="italic">Concerning Isabel Carnaby</span>. This was autobiographical in origin, as it dealt with &#145;the contrast between Methodist domesticity and high London society&#146;  (Sutherland, 231). The novel was noticed by William Robertson Nicoll, who encouraged her to devote herself to novel writing. Her best-known books followed one another in quick succession: <span class="italic">A Double Thread</span> (1899), <span class="italic">The Farringdons</span> (1900), <span class="italic">Fuel of Fire</span> (1902), <span class="italic">Place and Power</span> (1903), and <span class="italic">Kate of Kate Hall</span> (1904), the last-named a romance written in collaboration with her husband.<br>
<br>Ellen Fowler was seen as a brilliant and witty conversationalist. As a novelist she was regarded as a faithful chronicler of simple society; her novels are best remembered for their lively dialogue. Her place in English fiction might have been higher had the construction of her novels been more vigorous, and their range less narrow. Although one review commented that she neglected to address important contemporary issues such as women's suffrage in her books (&#145;the outlook of today, though hinted at, does not intrude&#146;; <span class="italic">TLS</span>, 15 March 1923, 178), she earned something of a feminist reputation from two of her later novels. <span class="italic">Miss Fallowfield's Fortune</span> (1908) deals with the lot of single women, and <span class="italic">Her Ladyship's Conscience</span> (1913) with an unconventional relationship between an older man and younger woman. Her last novel was <span class="italic">Signs and Wonders</span> (1926). She was a member of the Writers' Club and the Women's Athenaeum Club, and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.<br>
<br>After her marriage Ellen Fowler lived at Eltham, Kent, until 1916, when she moved to Bournemouth. During her later years failing health curtailed her writing. She died on 22 June 1929 at her home, Mershire Lodge, Marlborough Road, Bournemouth, survived only by her husband, as their marriage had been childless.<br>
<br>Ellen Fowler's sister <a name="cosubject_58975"></a><span class="headword">Edith Henrietta Hamilton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Fowler]</span></span>  (1865&#150;1944), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born at Summerfield, Racecourse, Chapel Ash, Wolverhampton, on 16 February 1865. On 23 June 1903 she married William Robert Hamilton (1869&#150;1954), a Church of England clergyman, at All Saints' Church, Knightsbridge, London. They had two sons: Gavin Robert Fowler Hamilton (<i>b</i>. 1905) and Henry Fowler New Hamilton (<i>b</i>. 1908). Edith's first publications were sharply amusing children's books, including <span class="italic">The Young Pretenders</span> (1895), illustrated by Philip Burne-Jones, and <span class="italic">The Professor's Children</span> (1897). Less well known than her sister, her adult novels also deal with the romantic problems of high-minded and politically active Christian members of the upper class. Her works in this vein include <span class="italic">For Richer for Poorer</span> (1905) and <span class="italic">Patricia</span> (1915). &#145;As in her sister's novels, the combination of snobbishness and spirituality is achieved with considerable polish&#146;  (Kemp and others, 138). She also wrote a biography of her father (1912). Edith Henrietta Hamilton died on 18 November 1944 and was survived by her husband.<br>
