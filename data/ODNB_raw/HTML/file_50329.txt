<span class="headword">Hopkins,  Charles Plomer</span>  (1861&#150;1922), <span class="occ">founder of missions to seamen and trade unionist</span>, was born on 7 March 1861 in Brewster, Massachusetts, USA, the son of an American master mariner employed for many years as a river pilot in Burma, and an English mother, Elizabeth. As a young child he and two sisters were brought to England to stay with maternal Cornish relatives, before being taken to Burma in 1867. In 1869 Hopkins travelled back to England to continue his education. He later recalled the effect on his future ministry of seeing officers' cruelty to the sailors who had befriended him on this voyage.<br>
<br>The dates of his attendance at Falmouth grammar school, then at Trinity College, London, after a spell in Heidelberg, are uncertain. He returned in 1882 to Rangoon as assistant organist at the Anglican pro-cathedral. Hopkins gave as the reason for his refusal of promotion as organist at Madras and of his interest in seamen an encounter with drunken midshipmen on his way to evening prayer. His discovery of their great neglect and his natural rapport with them prompted the bishop of Rangoon to appoint him to the vacant Rangoon seamen's chaplaincy, initially as a layman reading for holy orders. He was ordained deacon in 1884, and priest in 1885. Hopkins soon filled the seamen's church but his championing of seafarers' rights, especially after an incident where an overloaded ship sank, set him at odds with the shipping worthies on the chaplaincy committee. Things came to a head during the short Third Anglo-Burmese War in 1886; the bishop sent Hopkins to the seasonal chaplaincy at Akyab for six months to allow tempers to cool.<br>
<br>In what proved to be two years at Akyab Hopkins ran the parish, and opened a seamen's club. During this period he came to the conclusion that work among seamen could best be achieved by a band of men under religious vows. In 1888 malaria forced him to England for convalescence. He stayed briefly with the Revd Osborne Jay's parochial brotherhood, the ephemeral Society of St Paul (SSP) in Shoreditch. Within months he had taken vows and sailed to Calcutta as port chaplain and prior-provincial of the SSP, soon transmuted into his own Order of St Paul (OSP), recruited from the maritime community it sought to serve. Hopkins opened several seamen's clubs, and also established the Seamen's Friendly Society of St Paul, which grew rapidly, offering seamen-members legal protection as well as a religious rule. His bishop was in no doubt that it was a trade union. Hopkins's litigiousness (some thirty cases in five years) on behalf of seamen incensed local shipowners, some of whom, when other pressure failed, tried to get a young boy to make public accusations against him. This backfired against the instigators, and was dismissed in court, but dogged Hopkins as rumour for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Hopkins returned to Britain in 1894 to strengthen his community: he opened priories at Barry in south Wales, and Greenwich, and built Alton Abbey in Hampshire as a mother house. By 1900 the Indian priories had been closed. The <span class="roman">Colonial Clergy Act</span> (1874) prevented his functioning publicly as a priest in England, rumour probably encouraging the archbishop of Canterbury to withhold his licence. Instead, Hopkins became increasingly involved with the National Seamen's and Firemen's Union (NSFU), meeting its president, Havelock Wilson, in 1900. In 1910 he became secretary to the international committee of seamen's unions, and in this role he announced the start of the first international strike of seamen in June 1911. He kept Hermann Jochade of the International Transport Federation informed. Hopkins toured the country as a major NSFU speaker, and was key NSFU negotiator at its resolution. After the strike was over he was appointed a trustee of the NSFU, serving until 1922 as its troubleshooter and research specialist. His close involvement with merchant navy crewing issues during the First World War was rewarded with a CBE. Two publications by Hopkins, <span class="italic">Altering Plimsoll's Mark</span> (1913) and <span class="italic">The National Service of British Seamen, 1914&#150;18</span> (1920), offered detailed statistics and horrific examples to support the campaign to improve safety and conditions at sea. These were concerns he attempted to bring to the attention of seamen themselves with <span class="italic">The Seafarer's Annual</span> (1921).<br>
<br>Hopkins died at St Mawes, Cornwall, on 24 March 1922, after years of increasingly bad health, and was buried at Alton Abbey. At his death the OSP had dwindled to two brothers and one sister from a peak of around twenty members. It survived as a Benedictine community (and was depicted in fiction as the Order of St George in Compton MacKenzie's <span class="italic">The Altar Steps</span>). Although largely forgotten by the Church of England, his work influenced the formation of the Roman Catholic &#338;uvre de Mer (1893), a French organization for work among fishermen, and also of the Apostleship of the Sea (1895).<br>
