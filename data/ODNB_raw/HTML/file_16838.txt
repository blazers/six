<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Hugh</span>  (1588/9&#150;1667), <span class="occ">bishop of Llandaff</span>, was born in Cardiganshire; his parents have not been identified. Having matriculated as a servitor of Oriel College, Oxford, in 1607, he graduated BA on 12 November 1611 and proceeded MA on 30 June 1614, by which time he had been ordained. He was elected to a fellowship of Jesus College, Oxford, and proceeded BD in 1624 and DD in 1638. He became rector of St Andrews, Glamorgan, in 1617 and rector of St Nicholas in the same county in 1628. He was presented to the sinecure rectory of Denbigh in 1637 and to the rectory of Hirnant, Montgomeryshire, in 1638. He was appointed a canon and archdeacon of St David's on 19 October 1644.<br>
<br>There is scant trace of Lloyd during the civil wars and interregnum. Walker claimed that his benefices were sequestered and that he was allowed the customary fifth of his income for some years, but Matthews does not record him as a &#145;sufferer&#146;. In 1660 Lloyd was appointed to the see of Llandaff, perhaps principally because of his long-standing connection with the diocese and because the political situation needed appointees of such uncontroversial &#145;obscurity&#146;  (Green, 95&#150;6). Lloyd was also restored to the archdeaconry of St David's, which he held <i>in commendam</i>, and to his livings in Glamorgan and Montgomeryshire; he became a prebendary of Llandaff in 1660 and rector of Llangattock, Brecknockshire, in 1661. As bishop Lloyd left little mark. In October 1662 he wrote to his clergy urging them to manifest their religious zeal and their political loyalty in supporting free schools. White Kennett records some signs of Lloyd's concern to reconcile nonconforming clergy, such as Samuel Jones, former fellow of Jesus College and minister of Llangynwyd, and of his leniency. Lloyd allowed Richard Hawes, ejected minister of Leintwardine, to preach in public without subscription. Lloyd died in Llandaff at the age of seventy-eight on 7 June 1667 and was buried in the dilapidated Llandaff Cathedral.<br>
