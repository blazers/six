<span class="headword">Denton,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1626&#150;1709), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in the parish of Bradford, in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He was probably the son of John Denton (<i>fl</i>. 1613&#150;1642) of Manningham in the same parish, a clothier, who held 18 acres of land at Lilliecroft, Manningham, in 1613, and who signed the protestation oath to maintain the king, parliament, and the protestant religion in Bradford parish on 28 March 1642. On 4 May 1646 Denton was admitted as a sizar to Clare College, Cambridge, where he studied under David Clarkson. He matriculated later that year, graduated BA in 1649, proceeded MA in 1653, and became a fellow of Clare.<br>
<br>At Cambridge, Denton befriended John Tillotson, a subsequent archbishop of Canterbury, defending Tillotson's reputation in a letter to a friend, and tending him during a dangerous illness. They maintained a frequent correspondence thereafter, &#145;having contracted a most intimate friendship&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of &hellip; Tillotson</span>, 436). In 1653 Denton's degrees were incorporated at Oxford, but by the following year he was the rector of Oswaldkirk, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, the parish in which Tillotson shortly preached his first sermon. On 8 May 1654 he married Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1622, <i>d</i>. 1669), sister-in-law to the autobiographer Alice Thornton and eldest daughter of Robert Thornton of East Newton, Yorkshire, and his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Richard Darley of Buttercrambe. Their eldest son and heir, John, was baptized at Oswaldkirk on 5 September 1655. In November 1657 Denton was also described as vicar of Sherburn in the North Riding of Yorkshire.<br>
<br>In 1662 Denton was ejected from Oswaldkirk for nonconformity; Edmund Calamy lauded him as &#145;a very pious Man and a profitable Preacher&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.818). After the death of his first wife he married about 1670 Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1715), whose surname is unknown. The couple had four children, three of whose names are known&#151;John, Robert (<i>b</i>. 1676), and Ellen. On 16 May 1672 Denton was licensed as a presbyterian at Osgodby Grange in the North Riding of Yorkshire; he also applied, unsuccessfully, for a licence at East Newton, in the parish of Stonegrave. However, in June 1690 he was reordained in the Church of England by Thomas Barlow, bishop of Lincoln. Residing in East Newton by this time, he initially officiated as curate under Dr Thomas Comber, but was rector of Stonegrave by December 1690. In that year he began a volume, continued by his successors at Stonegrave, accounting for the yearly receipts and disbursements of the offertory. He was installed as prebendary of Husthwaite in York Minster on 1 December 1694 and was succeeded by his son Robert as rector of Stonegrave on 27 May 1700. Denton remained a close friend of the Thorntons, and on Alice Thornton's death in 1707 she bequeathed &#145;to my good brother Mr. John Denton&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography of Mrs Alice Thornton</span>, 338) &pound;5 in her will, requesting that he preach her funeral sermon. He died on 14 January 1709, in his eighty-third year, and was buried in Stonegrave parish church two days later, where his monumental tablet remains. He was survived by his wife.<br>
