<span class="headword">Hosain, Attia Shahid</span>  (1913&#150;1998), <span class="occ">writer and broadcaster</span>, was born on 20 October 1913 in Lucknow in United Provinces in northern India, one of five children of Shahid Hosain Kidwai. She belonged to one of the feudal landowning families, the <i>talukdars</i>, which in the twentieth century produced many prominent and distinguished men. Her father had studied at Christ's College, Cambridge, and the inns of court, and was a friend of Motilal Nehru, the father of Jawaharlal Nehru, and well known in political circles. Her mother came from a family of scholars and poets and was the founder of an institution for women's education and welfare that was still in existence at the end of the century. Attia Hosain was only eleven years old when her father died, and her mother took over all responsibility for the estate and for her children, bringing them all up strictly according to Muslim tradition. She had English governesses and attended La Martini&egrave;re School for Girls in Lucknow, but when she returned home had private tuition in Urdu and Persian and read the <span class="roman">Koran</span>. Hosain went on to the Isabella Thoburn College at the University of Lucknow, then the foremost college for women in India, and in 1933 became the first woman from a <i>talukdari</i> family to graduate. Nevertheless, she envied her brother who had been sent to Cambridge to study, met his friends when they returned, and was influenced by their left-wing politics and socialist and communist leanings. She attended the first Progressive Writers' Conference and could be called a fellow traveller. Although Hosain did not join the Communist Party, she remained an ardent socialist all her life.<br>
<br>Hosain married her cousin, Ali Bahadur Habibullah, the son of the vice-chancellor of the University of Lucknow, who was prominent in the nationalist politics of the time, and was herself swept up in the agitation for independence from British rule. Her early writing appeared in <span class="italic">The Pioneer</span>, then edited by Desmond Young, and also in <span class="italic">The Statesman</span>, the leading English newspaper in Calcutta. She was in England when India became independent in 1947, along with her husband, who was doing war repatriation work; he returned to India (and predeceased her), but she chose to remain in England with her two small children and began to earn her own living by broadcasting and presenting a women's programme on the Eastern Service of the BBC.<br>
<br>In 1953 Chatto and Windus published a collection of Hosain's short stories, <span class="italic">Phoenix Fled</span>, which John Connell described as &#145;little vignettes, precise, loving and exquisitely true in spirit and in fact&#146;. The <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> noted her unusual distinction and charm. In 1961 she published her only novel, <span class="italic">Sunlight on a Broken Column</span>, a portrait of her native city of Lucknow and of its feudal society's struggle to change, or else to retain, its beliefs and structure during the independence movement of the twentieth century. Of this society she wrote that &#145;They loved the city to which they belonged, and they lived and behaved as if the city belonged to them&#146;  (Hosain, 35).<br>
<br>Both books are marked by a rich and graceful English prose that reflects the ornate and formal traditions of Urdu and Persian literature, by their interpretation of feudalism that was Attia Hosain's background and that she considered noble and protective at best and cruel and unjust at worst, and by her ability to create characters who were aristocrats and born of privilege as well as those who served them and lived in grinding poverty. They are prose representations of busy Mughal miniatures with all their vivid detail of a way of life that lasted many centuries in India. The books enjoyed a resurgence of interest when Virago brought out new editions in 1988.<br>
<br>Attia Hosain's <i>&#339;uvre</i> is small because she was her own harshest critic and destroyed much of what she wrote. She also had a vivid, exuberant personality that enjoyed society&#151;she counted among her many friends Cecil Day Lewis and Compton MacKenzie&#151;and in London her Chelsea flat was open to friends and admirers from around the world. In 1961 she acted on the West End stage with Gladys Cooper in Peter Mayne's play <span class="italic">The Bird of Time</span>. Even towards the end of her life she found it difficult to refuse to receive a guest or decline an invitation. Her last public appearance, shortly before her death, was at Nehru House in London for the launch of a volume of short stories by Indian women writers living abroad; it was published as a tribute to her.<br>
<br>Attia Hosain died on 23 January 1998 in the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, Chelsea, London; she was survived by her son Waris Hussein, a theatre and film director, and a daughter, Shama Habibullah, a film-maker. Attia Hosain was remembered by all who knew her for her wit, her elegance, her cosmopolitanism (she had declared &#145;I am a universalist-humanist&#146;), her fierce championing of causes dear to her, and her legendary beauty that even when she was in her eighties could take one's breath away.<br>
