<span class="headword">Sutton,  Martin Hope</span>  (1815&#150;1901), <span class="occ">seed merchant</span>, was born on 14 March 1815 at Reading, the second of three sons (there were also three daughters, as well as a further son and daughter who died young) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46383/', "John Sutton (bap. 1777, d. 1863)")</script>, corn factor, and his wife, Sarah Norris (<i>d</i>. 1834). The name Hope was added because his father, in severe financial straits after the collapse of a Reading bank, welcomed the child's arrival as a hopeful sign for the future.<br>
<br>Although his elder brother was allowed to study medicine, after a brief education at Huntley's School and Greathead's School, Sutton at the age of twelve was obliged to join his father's business. As John Sutton's poor health was exacerbated by a drink problem&#151;which Martin's devoted efforts later cured&#151;Martin had great responsibility at an early age. He realized that far better returns could be achieved from seeds than from dealing in corn, but his father refused to let him study botany or to deal in seeds during working hours, and he pursued these activities in his spare time. He nevertheless built up a network of seed growers from among local market-gardeners, and the corn side of the business was phased out after Martin Sutton was made partner in 1836, aged twenty-one. In 1840 turnover came to &pound;1800 and profits to nearly &pound;580.<br>
<br>Until then Sutton had sold mainly agricultural seeds, but he steadily enlarged his range to include flower seeds for the suburban and country gardens that were by then becoming popular. He also advertised vegetables and ornamental plants, at first in handbills, from 1832, and later in catalogues. The introduction of the penny post in 1840 allowed him to create a mail-order system: each year he sent out thousands of these catalogues, which contained order forms, and he executed the resulting orders by return of post. By then he had embarked on a typically persistent and laborious campaign to bring about the improvement of seed quality throughout the country, but not until 1869 was the <span class="roman">Seeds Adulteration Act</span> passed into law.<br>
<br>In his younger days Sutton was sociable and quite a dandy. Then he became converted to more sober ways by Charlotte Trendell (1818&#150;1846), daughter of a Reading watchmaker, whom he married in 1844. A son and a daughter died soon after birth; Charlotte herself died of consumption in 1846, aged twenty-eight. Sutton was helped over his grief by months of exertion in fulfilling large government orders for Ireland after the outbreak of the great famine there, and by experiments to develop disease-resistant strains of potato. In 1848 he married Sophia Woodhead (<i>d</i>. 1894), daughter of William Warwick of nearby Whitley. They had five sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>During the 1850s annual sales rose from under &pound;5000 to &pound;35,000, and Sutton was asked to supply seeds to the royal gardens at Windsor, to give advice on crops in the home farm there, and to help with the laying out of the gardens at Osborne House, Queen Victoria's residence in the Isle of Wight. Thereafter he received a present from her each Christmas; he was also offered a knighthood, which he declined. His &#145;Royal Seed Establishment&#146; received royal warrants from both the queen and from the prince of Wales (later Edward VII). In 1856 Sutton issued the first <span class="italic">Amateur's Guide in Horticulture</span>, in five parts, the last of which provided a &#145;calendar of operations&#146; which enthusiasts could follow through the seasons. He wrote an article on laying down land for permanent pasture in the Royal Agricultural Society's journal for 1861.<br>
<br>Together with his younger brother Alfred, Sutton oversaw the steady growth of the firm, which in 1870 had sales of &pound;75,000 and which he boasted was the largest retail seed firm in Britain. A few years later he raised this claim to the most considerable business of its kind in the world, by turnover and by the number of customers. In 1871 his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36378/', "Martin John Sutton")</script>, became a partner, and two other sons later joined the partnership of Sutton &amp; Sons. As the father aged he fought a succession of running battles with his sons&#151;never face-to-face but by the exchange of notes and memoranda&#151;over issues such as the need to keep costs down and for them to pay ever more detailed attention to all aspects of the business. They in turn looked for some enjoyment out of their growing affluence, and fruitlessly campaigned for him to stand down; not until 1888 did he and Alfred retire, and Martin John Sutton become the senior partner. Turnover was then nearly &pound;170,000 and profit &pound;33,000. An equally sore point was the extent of Martin Sutton's charitable donations, which he increased from 5 per cent of his personal income in the mid-1840s to 20 per cent from the late 1860s onwards.<br>
<br>Sutton consistently refused to serve either as an MP or as a town councillor; instead he actively supported such religious bodies as the British and Foreign Bible Society, the Church Missionary Society, and the YMCA. As a young man he had been a Sunday school teacher and had thought of becoming a missionary; and he and Alfred subsidized the foundation of certain local schools. On the evangelical wing of the Church of England, he regularly met delegations and individuals of the same persuasion, and he freely handed out tracts that reflected his views.<br>
<br>A grandson by marriage characterized Sutton in his riper years as &#145;a direct-looking old gentleman with rather wide-set eyes, a bold and broad-based nose and patriarchal beard&#146;, easily mistaken for a nonconformist divine or even a street-corner evangelist  (Bashford, 180). While entertaining dignitaries in his home, he was accompanied by a footman who placed over his shoulders different thicknesses of cloak according to the temperature. Sutton died at his home, Cintra Lodge, Whitley, Reading, on 4 October 1901. The distance he had travelled socially since his early corn-chandling days may be seen from the eloquent words uttered by a clergyman son at his funeral: &#145;And he died mourned by the whole town and his eighteen indoor and outdoor servants&#146;  (ibid., 200). He was buried at Reading cemetery.<br>
