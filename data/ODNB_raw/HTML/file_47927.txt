<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clerk, Sir  John, of Penicuik</span>, first baronet  (1649/50&#150;1722), <span class="occ">landowner and coal owner</span>, was born probably at Penicuik in Edinburghshire, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/107331/', "John Clerk (1611&#150;1674)")</script>, merchant and art collector, and Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1630, <i>d</i>. in or before 1668), the daughter of Sir William Gray of Pittendrum. Clerk's father traded profitably as a merchant in Paris between 1634 and 1646, when he returned to Scotland and lived as a country gentleman. In 1646 he bought the barony of Penicuik, and had his son educated at home to prevent him acquiring immoral or profligate habits. Clerk succeeded his father as laird of Penicuik in 1674, and it was in that year that he married his first wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Hendersone of Elvingston (Haddingtonshire), a doctor of physic. Clerk subsequently extended his estates in Edinburghshire by purchasing further land, including the barony of Lasswade (adjacent to Penicuik) from Sir John Nicolson in 1696. He was a member of the Scottish parliament (separate from that of England until 1707) for Edinburghshire from 1690 to 1702, served as a lieutenant-colonel in the militia, and (after 1707) was a justice of the peace for the shire. He was created a baronet on 24 March 1679.<br>
<br>Clerk was a traditional landowner, but he was also an exponent of new agricultural organization and techniques, notably the consolidation of landholdings, soil improvements, and the commutation of payments in kind to money rents. To pay off the large debt incurred to buy the Lasswade estate, he began more systematically to exploit its extensive coal deposits. In consequence of dealing with the technical problems of extraction he also sought to increase output in an uncertain and competitive industry through new patterns of work discipline. In response to shortages of skilled labour in the coal and salt industries, a statute of 1606 (not repealed until 1799) had bound Scottish colliers for life to the owner of the coal, giving them the legal status of serfs but at the same time making them difficult to control by purely economic means such as wages. The special status of the colliers, and certain prominent cultural features such as shared leisure, contributed to their strong sense of identity.<br>
<br>As a coal owner Clerk treated his workers well in spite of their servile position. He insisted that his overseers and other tenants dealt fairly with the colliers and he provided housing for the workers and education for their children. Relations between Clerk and his employees were a good deal more amicable than those which obtained under the second baronet. However, in return Clerk demanded regular hard work coupled with adherence to strict Calvinist tenets of sobriety and morality. Himself an ardent Calvinist, apparently untroubled by doubt about his own rectitude, he waged a tireless campaign with the help of the local church against what he saw as the colliers' wanton idleness, their fondness for drink, their profane and brutal behaviour, and their dishonesty in exploiting the perquisites of their employment. One of his first acts as the new feudal lord of Lasswade was to proscribe sabbath breaking, profanity, and drunkenness among all his workers and tenants. He himself gave up alcohol around 1710 to help his gout and other ailments. Clerk took a close personal interest in mineral exploitation and was a source of advice to fellow coal owners in the Forth basin where most contemporary pits were located.<br>
<br>Clerk and his wife, Elizabeth, had seven children, including his heir, the second baronet, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5617/', "Sir John Clerk of Penicuik (1676&#150;1755)")</script>. After Elizabeth's early death at the age of twenty-five he remained a widower for nearly a decade. He then married Christian, daughter of the Revd James Kilpatrick of Carrington (Edinburghshire), with whom he had nine more children. Having managed his affairs with great frugality, on his death he was a substantial landowner in the richest part of Scotland and had provided well for his surviving children.<br>
<br>In his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> the second baronet wrote that his father had &#145;left a great many journals and writings under his hand which will, I hope, bear testimony to the regard he always had for religion, vertue and honesty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 8). Although a man with &#145;no great humour of talking&#146;, these manuscripts reveal that, in Clerk's desire systematically to generate profits and regenerate men, he combined different strands of early modern Scottish life. A product of his age in his religious and moral outlook, he was also an important transitional figure in terms of the regulatory framework that he sought to impose on his labour force (and akin to the iron manufacturer Abraham Crowley (1658&#150;1713)). A small but well-built man, Sir John Clerk died peacefully at Penicuik House in March 1722, aged seventy-two.<br>
