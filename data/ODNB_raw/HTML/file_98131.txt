<span class="headword">Freeman <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Mason]</span>,  Ann</span>  (1797&#150;1826), <span class="occ">Methodist Bible Christian preacher</span>, was born on 24 June 1797 in Northlew, Devon, the fourth of thirteen children of William and Grace Mason, a Devonshire farming family. At fifteen she was apprenticed as a dressmaker, before the family moved to a farm at Northcott in Sutcombe. It was here that she joined the Northcott Methodist Society with her sister Mary, which led to a rift in the family and the sisters' temporary exile from home. Within eighteen months of their return they had converted their mother, sister, and four brothers to Methodism. The radical Methodist sect of the Bible Christians (which broke away from Wesleyan Methodism in 1815 under the leadership of William O'Bryan and James Thorne) was highly influential in south-west England during the first quarter of the nineteenth century. Throughout 1816 Ann Mason heard various Bible Christian preachers, including Thorne, and attended their fifth quarterly meeting, which was held in her aunt's barn at Alsworthy on 1 January 1817. After the meeting she separated from the Wesleyan Methodists to become a class leader and preacher with the Bible Christians. She abandoned dressmaking in March 1818 and over the next year travelled as an itinerant preacher in Devon and Cornwall, speaking in the open air and walking over thirty miles a day, despite suffering from respiratory problems. She frequently experienced hostility to her preaching and in Brentor in June 1818 she recalled &#145;the parsons and parish-officers have searched for me, as though I was come to destroy the land&#146;  (Freeman, 12).<br>
<br>Methodist women preachers, such as Mary Fletcher and Sarah Crosby, played a crucial role in the eighteenth-century evangelical revival and were acknowledged by John Wesley as having an &#145;<i>extraordinary</i> call&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 5.257). However, Wesley's death in 1791 and the consolidation of the Methodist movement into &#145;a hierarchical, church-like organization&#146;  (Valenze, 20) resulted in a decline in women's status and restrictions on their preaching. As a consequence many women broke with the Wesleyan Methodists and joined groups like the Bible Christians, Primitive Methodists, and Independent Methodists, who remained committed to revivalist techniques. By 1824 about 30 per cent of Bible Christian preachers were women, although their influence declined during the first decade of the movement. Within this permissive atmosphere Ann Mason was a determined advocate of women's preaching and lamented that &#145;many females are kept in bondage by those who say, &#147;we suffer not a woman to teach&#148;; thus quoting Paul's words, and not rightly applying them&#146;  (Freeman, 14).<br>
<br>The first conference of the Bible Christians took place at Badash, Cornwall, in August 1819. Ann Mason wrote to the conference and met their leader William O'Bryan, correcting him on the doctrine of perfectionism and telling him that &#145;I knew his soul was not thus saved, and begged he would expect it&#146;  (Freeman, 25). Her willingness to question male figures of authority on theological matters continued throughout her career. In 1823 she received an appointment to London, where the novelty of female preachers attracted crowds to her meetings that took place in a converted billiard room on the Strand. On 28 April 1824 she addressed about a thousand people on a hill in Brighton, leading the Brighton <span class="italic">Herald</span> to comment that she &#145;delivers discourses with animation; she speaks fluently and in tolerably correct language&#146;  (Bourne, <span class="italic">Bible Christians</span>, 161). In London she re-established her acquaintance with Henry Freeman, a Devon preacher whom she had first met in 1820. The relationship seemed to accelerate Ann Mason's separation from the Bible Christians and the couple wrote to the conference in June explaining their desire to marry, their intended visit to Ireland, and their doubts over the sacraments (which in effect signalled their separation from the society). Their marriage took place on 9 August 1824. Writing to her sister a year later Ann commented &#145;we live and love, doing the will of God&#146;  (Freeman, 214). The couple sometimes preached together, but Ann Freeman generally travelled alone or with a female companion.<br>
<br>The Freemans toured Ireland during 1824&#150;5 and, despite frequent attacks, preached in the streets to Roman Catholics, Anglicans, and dissenters. By this time Freeman had contracted tuberculosis, but nevertheless she continued to attend several meetings each day, often miles apart. She returned to England at the beginning of 1826 to stay at her parents' house in Northcott, and died on 7 March 1826. She was buried at the parish burial ground of Sutcombe on 13 March. Freeman's journal, letters, and poems were reproduced in her <span class="italic">Memoir</span> which was edited and published by her husband later that year. The memoir provides an insight into a lifelong struggle to accommodate Ann Freeman's personal faith within formalized religion and her commitment to independent preaching, worship, and popular evangelism.<br>
