<span class="headword">Brandon <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Brandeis]</span>,  (Oscar) Henry</span>  (1916&#150;1993), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 9 March 1916 in Liberec, Bohemia&#151;then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, but shortly to become part of Czechoslovakia&#151;the only child of a banker in Prague whose family name was Brandeis. After secondary education in his native country he studied in Lausanne, Switzerland, and at the Charles University of Prague. In 1939, as Hitler's armies swept into Czechoslovakia, he decided, given his Jewish origins, to emigrate to England. His father had died in 1935 and his mother planned to join him as soon as he was settled: that this proved impossible was one of the great sorrows of his life, and fifty-four years later he was buried, by his own wish, beside his parents in Bratislava.<br>
<br>Arriving in England without a word of the language, Brandon enrolled at the London School of Economics and found employment of a sort in a briar pipe factory. He was lucky enough to fall in with Iain Lang, the foreign editor of the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, who encouraged him to aim at serious journalism. His first article for the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> appeared in December 1939, under the heading &#145;Economic havoc in Prague&#146;. A year later, the paper sent him, by now speaking English proficiently, on a three-month assignment to report on American defence industries. In the event, he remained working in the USA for four years and in 1943 he joined the staff of the paper, after which he became a war correspondent in north Africa, Italy, and France. At the end of the war he reported on the peace conferences and diplomatic meetings in Paris, London, and Moscow, as well as on the early stages of the United Nations in New York.<br>
<br>By the time he was appointed to the key post of Washington correspondent for the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> in 1949&#151;a move supported by Ian Fleming, then Kemsley Newspapers' foreign manager&#151;Brandon had come a long way from his modest beginnings. To a good brain and retentive memory he had added wide knowledge of the issues and personalities of post-war politics and diplomacy, and had also won a deserved reputation for discretion&#151;not a characteristic of most journalists. His own political inclinations, if any, were never made apparent, which is perhaps why so many politicians trusted him. As Washington correspondent for the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>&#151;a post he held until 1983&#151;he established and maintained a unique relationship with successive American political leaders and influential people. This enabled him to report with singular accuracy on the evolution over a period of thirty-four years of American foreign, defence, and economic policies, especially in the context of the Anglo-American alliance. Among the impressive list of his American contacts and friends were Dean Acheson, President John Kennedy and his wife, Jacqueline, and brother Robert, McGeorge Bundy (Kennedy's national security adviser), Robert McNamara, presidents Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan, Henry Kissinger (this was an especially close relationship), Katherine (Kay) Graham (the owner of the <span class="italic">Washington Post</span>), a long stream of British ambassadors, and many others. There was no other representative of a foreign media concern in Washington who enjoyed the access he did. Nor was this extensive network confined to the USA: because of his reputation and standing in Washington, he came to know, inform, and entertain leading British figures ranging from George Brown and Harold Lever to Edward Heath and Margaret Thatcher.<br>
<br>A journalist for a weekly paper is under less pressure than one filing two or three messages daily. Brandon was able to spend his week garnering information from friends and contacts, so that Sunday after Sunday he could reveal to his readers what was going on, or was due to go on, in Washington's seats of power. To those readers, that is, who read him. This was not popular journalism, in the modern and not always favourable sense. It was aimed at a relatively small group of politicians, policy-makers, diplomatists, and foreign-affairs communities in London, Paris, and perhaps Moscow. And for all its quality of content, this meant, especially as the readership of the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> widened, that his material often had to be rearranged, sometimes rewritten, by his London editors. The task was made doubly necessary by the fact that English was not his native tongue. He acquiesced in the practice, though he occasionally expressed regret at the loss of a treasured but abstruse allusion. He won numerous prizes for his journalism, and was appointed CBE in 1985.<br>
<br>The high esteem in which Brandon was held in Washington added greatly to the international lustre of the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, but his individualism did not make him always an easy colleague on his own ground, which he defended with an unshakeable sense of possession. A good skier, a respectable tennis player, and an interesting if somewhat slow-paced talker, he was welcome at many Washington dinner tables. But it was noticeable that on such occasions he tended to direct most of his attention to the newsworthy rather than to the lesser lights who might be present&#151;a habit common to many eager journalists. His marriage, in 1970, to Mabel Hobart Wentworth, former wife of Eric Wentworth, did much to smooth these rough edges and to induce a more relaxed manner. He was devoted to their daughter, Fiona. Mabel Brandon later became the social secretary to the White House during the first administration of President Reagan. The Brandons entertained extensively in a splendid house whose garden marched with that of the British embassy. No other foreign correspondent lived in such state, which may perhaps explain the rather grudging attitude towards him of some of Brandon's journalistic colleagues.<br>
<br>As well as his regular contributions to the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, Brandon wrote several books, most of them expanding ground already covered in his journalism. Thus <span class="italic">In the Red: how Sterling Came in from the Cold</span> (1967) described the events leading up to the devaluation of the pound that year. <span class="italic">The Retreat of American Power</span> (1973) analysed the foreign policy of Nixon and Kissinger, and was published in Britain, Germany, and Japan as well as in the USA. His autobiography, <span class="italic">Special Relationships</span> (1988), containing some shrewd judgements of men and events, was well received in America but made little impact in the UK. His last book was <span class="italic">In Search of a New World Order: the Future of US&#150;European Relations</span> (1992).<br>
<br>After his retirement Brandon continued to live in Washington, where he was made a senior scholar-in-residence at the Brookings Institute. He maintained his literary output with contributions to American publications, and also produced two small volumes of discussions of foreign policy, under the Brookings imprint. He was a cultivated man; his published interviews with artists and writers were proof, if such were needed, that his interests and range were by no means confined to politics. The kind of &#145;top people's&#146; journalism to which Brandon was recruited and which he continued to practise had become by the time of his retirement largely a thing of the past. But nothing should detract from his achievements at the height of his Washington career, when his insider knowledge was deemed to be so important that the Nixon administration authorized the tapping of his telephone. It was, in its disagreeable way, a special kind of tribute.<br>
<br>Brandon died at the Queen Square Neurological Hospital, London, on 20 April 1993, of a cerebral haemorrhage. After his death his widow and daughter, helped by donations from more than 150 friends in Britain and the USA, established the Henry Brandon memorial fellowships, one of whose aims is to take Czech and Slovak journalists to the USA to study the workings of a free press.<br>
