<span class="headword">Younger,  John</span>  (1785&#150;1860), <span class="occ">writer and shoemaker</span>, the youngest of the six children of William Younger, a shoemaker from the Scottish borders, and his wife, Jean Henderson, was born at Longnewton in the parish of Ancrum, Roxburghshire, on 5 July 1785. He had little formal schooling and from the age of nine worked at his father's trade. The poverty of his youth drove him to excel in poaching and angling. When conditions began to improve he married (9 August 1811) Agnes Riddle (<i>d</i>. 1856), and settled at St Boswells, some 3 miles from Longnewton, as the village shoemaker.<br>
<br>Having bought a copy of Burns for 6<i>d</i>. at St Boswells fair, Younger determined to try his own hand at poetry, although he did not publish anything until <span class="italic">Thoughts as they Rise</span> in 1834. He also wrote on angling, publishing <span class="italic">River angling for salmon and trout, more particularly as practised in the Tweed and its tributaries</span> (1840), which was highly praised by <span class="italic">The Field</span> for its &#145;practical&#146; value.<br>
<br>Although he was contemptuous of working-class movements, Younger despised the rich, a feeling possibly accentuated by the growing imposition by riparian owners of restrictions on who could fish their waters. He loathed the &#145;baronial hall&#146;. He had little time for classical Scottish literature, and regarded Sir Walter Scott with especial abomination. He dismissed the <span class="roman">Waverley novels</span> as &#145;old piper stories&#146;, &#145;dwarf and witch tales&#146;, and monstrous caricatures of Scottish manners. He was as keen an observer of men as of fish, and he became known as the &#145;Tweedside Gnostic&#146;, as well as being courted as the most proficient Scottish angler. His essay of 1847, &#145;The temporal advantage of the Sabbath &hellip; in relation to the working classes&#146; (published in 1851 as <span class="italic">The Light of the Week</span>), for which he was awarded a prize of &pound;15, presented to him by Lord Shaftesbury at a ceremony in London, was illuminated by vivid illustrations.<br>
<br>About 1849 Younger was appointed village postmaster, but the routine work proved beyond his patience, and in January 1856 he threw up the post and returned to cobbling. He died at St Boswells, very poor, but honest and industrious to the last, on 18 June 1860, and was buried in St Boswells kirkyard beside his wife, Nannie, whom he had often celebrated in his writings. He left some rich materials for a memoir of himself, to which he had given the title &#145;Obscurities in private life developed, or, Robinson Crusoe untravelled&#146;. These were recast into an <span class="italic">Autobiography of John Younger</span>, and published at Kelso in 1881.<br>
