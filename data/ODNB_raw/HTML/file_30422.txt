<span class="headword">Annandale,  Thomas</span>  (1838&#150;1907), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born at Northumberland Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, on 2 February 1838, the second son of Thomas Annandale, surgeon, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Johnston. Annandale was educated at Bruce's academy in Newcastle, and was afterwards apprenticed to his father. He continued his professional studies at the Newcastle Infirmary and then matriculated in 1856 at Edinburgh University; he graduated MD in 1860 and received the gold medal for his thesis on the injuries and diseases of the hip joint. In 1860 Annandale was appointed house surgeon to James Syme at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, and he was Syme's private assistant from 1861 to 1870. In 1863 he was admitted FRCS (Edinburgh) and he became a junior demonstrator of anatomy in the university under John Goodsir. He was also appointed in 1863 a lecturer on the principles of surgery in the extramural school of medicine, and he gave an annual course of lectures there until 1871, when he began to lecture on clinical surgery at the Royal Infirmary.<br>
<br>Annandale was admitted MRCS (England) on 15 July 1859, and FRCS on 12 April 1888; in 1864 he won the Jacksonian prize for his dissertation, <span class="italic">The malformations, diseases and injuries of the fingers and toes, with their surgical treatment</span> (1865). He was appointed assistant surgeon to the Royal Infirmary at Edinburgh in 1865, and acting surgeon there in 1871. He then became regius professor of clinical surgery at the University of Edinburgh, in 1877, in succession to Joseph Lister. He was made honorary DCL of Durham University in April 1902, and was surgeon-general to the royal archers, the king's bodyguard in Scotland, from 27 May 1900 until his death. He had joined the corps as an archer in 1870.<br>
<br>Annandale kept himself abreast of all the scientific changes which affected his profession. He took a keen interest in university matters and especially in the welfare of the students; he was prominent at the students' union and in the athletic club.<br>
<br>In 1874 Annandale married Eveline, the eldest daughter of the Edinburgh publisher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19889/', "William Nelson")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64902/', "Nelson family")</script>]; they had a family of three sons and three daughters. Annandale died suddenly on 20 December 1907, having operated as usual at the Royal Infirmary on the previous day. He was buried in the Dean cemetery, Edinburgh. The Annandale gold medal in clinical surgery was founded in his memory at Edinburgh University.<br>
