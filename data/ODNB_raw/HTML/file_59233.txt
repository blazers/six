<span class="headword">Douglas,  Margaret</span>, countess of Douglas, and duchess of Touraine in the French nobility  (<em>b. </em>before 1373?, <em>d.</em> 1450/51), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was the eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23714/', "Robert III (d. 1406)")</script> and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8063/', "Annabella, n&#233;e Drummond (d. 1401)")</script>, and thus the sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14587/', "James I")</script>. She married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7862/', "Archibald Douglas, fourth earl of Douglas and duke of Touraine (c.1369&#150;1424)")</script>, probably in the late 1380s. Archibald died in 1424 fighting for the French, having apparently entrusted the administration of Galloway to Margaret in his absence abroad and the rest of his estates to his eldest son. In 1426 James I gave Margaret a life grant of the lordship of Galloway, and she ruled for twenty-three years as widowed countess of Douglas and duchess of Touraine from her <i>caput</i>, Threave Castle. Galloway's snail-pace recovery from the disasters of the fourteenth century complicated her task.<br>
<br>Margaret had to live through the brutal conflict between successive kings of Scots and the Black Douglases. Stewart by birth and Douglas by marriage, she seems to have attempted to do her conventional duty by both. If as a ruler her horizon was confined to the promotion of family interests, this helped to bring some order into the countryside and economy. The few surviving charters written in her chancery at Threave or quoted in royal confirmations record her conduct of business. In eastern Galloway she enlarged the estates of the Stewarts and other relatives, while in the west she raised the lands of William Douglas of Leswalt to a barony. She endorsed and added to her husband's endowment of a chapel in Whithorn Cathedral and made her secretary and chancellor provost of the collegiate church of Lincluden, Kirkcudbrightshire, where she endowed a chaplaincy for the souls of her husband and their respective kin. She granted the Franciscans the tolls of Dumfries Bridge. This patronage, meagre by comparison with the prodigality of the Balliols in better times, bears witness to her limited means.<br>
<br>Margaret Stewart had three known children and probably a fourth, but she lost her younger son, her husband, and her son-in-law at the battle of Verneuil in 1424. Her elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7863/', "Archibald Douglas, fifth earl of Douglas and duke of Touraine")</script>, predeceased her, dying of plague in 1439. Her brother James I was murdered in 1437, and two grandsons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7927/', "William Douglas, sixth earl of Douglas and duke of Touraine")</script>, and his younger brother, were judicially murdered in 1440. This left Margaret in old age without any close male relative to protect her. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7928/', "William Douglas, eighth earl of Douglas")</script>, put pressure on her to resign Galloway. Dreading impoverishment, she petitioned the French king for a widow's portion from the duchy of Touraine. It was refused. In 1448 the English burnt Dumfries, threatening her border, and the next year she relinquished Galloway to the eighth earl. She is said to have died at Threave, apparently before April 1451, although the exact date is unknown. No chronicler romanticized Margaret. An elegant tomb with her recumbent effigy was erected at Lincluden collegiate church.<br>
