<span class="headword">Collop,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1625), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was baptized at Flitwick, Bedfordshire, on 4 July 1625, the son of John Collop, who was probably a mercer. Collop was educated at the Charterhouse and as an exhibitioner at Pembroke College, Cambridge, commencing studies in 1641 under the tutelage of William Quarles. Though it is difficult to be certain, it appears that Collop was licensed as a physician; at any rate he allowed himself the title of MD. Owing to the scarcity of marriage records during the Commonwealth period, it is difficult to establish when Collop's first marriage took place, though it can be said with greater certainty that he later moved to London, making a second marriage, to Anne Evington, about 1676.<br>
<br>Collop was the author of <span class="italic">Poesis rediviva, or, Poesie Reviv'd</span> (1656) (containing a lengthy dedication to Henry, marquess of Dorchester) and <span class="italic">Itur satyricum in Loyall Stanzas</span> (1660), a poem on the Restoration. His massive debt to Donne is evident throughout the corpus, though the imitation of Donne's verbal precision and intentional probing of the reader's habits of thought and moral complacency is not a match for Donne's incandescent intelligence or natural skill with language. Quite frequently Collop begins with an arresting, if syntactically awkward, couplet, yet is unable to develop the theme or build on the opening. His conciliatory attitude to the political and religious controversies of the day is found throughout most of his occasional verse. Basically a moderate royalist (he did not approve of cavalier excess) he also attempted to reconcile himself to Cromwell's power.<br>
<br>In religious matters Collop's conservatism was ill-matched to the 1650s and he took little pleasure in the sectarianism of the period, identifying the arguments of the rival parties as being based in attempts to gain temporal power and authority, unrelated to the divine. A popular tract, <span class="italic">Medici Catholicon</span> (1656, reprinted as <span class="italic">Charity Commended</span>, 1658 and 1667) pursues Collop's belief in toleration in religion. The opening of &#145;Sectaries&#146; neatly encapsulates his views on this subject and is also telling in terms of its strength and poetic allegiance:<blockquote>
<div>See of phanatique fowlers a fresh shole,<br>
</div>
<div>With baits of Liberty who decoy the Soul,<br>
</div>
<div>
<i>Copernicism</i> these by their whimsies prove;<br>
</div>
<div>Where all are giddy, how can the Earth not move?<br>
</div>
</blockquote>However unlike most of Collop's occasional verse, the poem ends strongly:<blockquote>
<div>All 'gainst Idolatry cry; yet all approve,<br>
</div>
<div>While they the idols of their Fancies love.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>This illustrates the difference between the Herbert-inspired religious lyrics, written from personal conviction, and the more awkward occasional verse.<br>
<br>Collop's range extended beyond the religious to include the less familiar genre of poems addressed to the physically hard-favoured mistress, including four poems to a yellow-skinned lady. &#145;On the Wearing of the Tag of her Blew Point&#146; begins with the memorable couplet<blockquote>
<div>Though like a Liquorish stick you're thin,<br>
</div>
<div>Yet all its sweetness is within.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Collop also wrote against quackery, including the common belief in the relation of the humours and elements to well-being, phlebotomy (bloodletting), purging, and the practising of non-licentiates:<blockquote>
<div>These like the Dogs in errors darker night,<br>
</div>
<div>Bark at the Moon, but cannot reach the light.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>&#145;Chymistrie&#146; is also criticized, as is the use of the occult (&#145;On Sigils&#146;), alchemy, astrology, and mysticism of all kinds. Occasionally Collop provides a lively metaphor such as in &#145;Man a Microcosm&#146; in which &#145;Our flesh is earth, our blood is as a Sea&#146;. Yet it is poems such as &#145;On Truth&#146; that portray Collop at his best, able to identify the folly of religious controversy, but frustrated by his lack of ability to change the temperament of the times in which he found himself, and cast adrift from the period when toleration was viable:<blockquote>
<div>See each Divine is but an advocate,<br>
</div>
<div>As if Religion was a temporal state:<br>
</div>
<div>They with illusion, forgeries, for it plead,<br>
</div>
<div>And do't like Lawy'rs, onely to be fee'd.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>
<span class="italic">Itur satyricum</span> is an attempt to praise the Restoration, yet a combination of platitude and verbal awkwardness limits its effectiveness as poetry, if not as an apposite and well-timed welcome, written by a man who had argued that Charles I had bargained away his own life on the beheading of &#145;<i>Wisdoms</i> Monopoly&#146;, the earl of Strafford.<br>
