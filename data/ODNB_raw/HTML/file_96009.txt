<span class="headword">Bolton, Sir  Frederic Bernard <span class="st"> [Tim]</span></span>  (1921&#150;2005), <span class="occ">shipowner</span>, was born on 9 March 1921 at 1 Lower Terrace, Hampstead, London, the only son among the four children of Louis Hamilton Bolton (1884&#150;1953), shipowner, and his wife, Beryl (<i>d</i>. 1977), daughter of Bernard Dyer. Usually known as Tim, he was educated at Rugby School, where his main achievements were sporting rather than academic. After leaving school he worked for six months on the broking side of his family firm, before enlisting for war service in July 1940. He was commissioned into the Welsh Guards, and from 1942 saw active service in the north African and Italian campaigns. He proved &#145;fearless and indefatigable&#146; according to the citation for the Military Cross awarded to him in 1945. After demobilization in 1946 he rejoined the family business, and on 19 April 1950 he married Valerie Margaret Barwick (<i>d</i>. 1970), daughter of George Short Barwick, company director. They had two sons.<br>
<br>In 1953 Bolton succeeded his father as chairman of the family business. Originally known as the Bolton Steam Shipping Company, the business had been established by his grandfather, Sir Frederic Bolton, who had started as a Lloyd's underwriter in 1874. The company specialized in small cargo vessels, all named after artists whose names began with R, such as <i>Raphael</i> and <i>Rubens</i>. Initially successful in trade with the Mediterranean, after 1945 it became an operator of tramp steamers and ore carriers and diversified into such other areas as broking, underwriting, and agency work, becoming the Bolton Group. Not all Bolton's attempts to broaden the business were successful, however; the acquisition of a stake in Transglobe Airways in 1966, for instance, which went into liquidation two years later. Bolton himself became a director of the Atlantic Steam Navigation Company in 1960, of BP's tanker division in 1968, and of British Rail's shipping operations (later Sealink) in 1970. The Bolton Group's core business of shipping dwindled steadily, however, as Britain's share of world trade declined and the industry was transformed by containerization, and the last two Bolton ships were sold to an American company in 1982. Bolton carried on as chairman of the group's remaining interests until his retirement in 1991.<br>
<br>Bolton achieved greater prominence through his role as a leading representative of the British shipping industry. He joined the general committee of Lloyds Register of Shipping in 1961, and by 1964 was a member of the Port of London Authority and also a very active chairman of the Chamber of Shipping's research committee. By 1965 he was vice-president of the chamber, and in 1966 became its second-youngest ever president. His impact was felt when he delivered &#145;a whirlwind speech which helped to knock half an hour off the usually sluggish ritual of the chamber's annual meeting&#146;, in which he posed searching questions about the performance of the industry, including &#145;are our management as efficient as they could be?&#146;, and &#145;have we too many small and family-dominated companies?&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 Feb 1966). When the Geddes report on the future of British shipbuilding was published in the following month, Bolton was quoted as saying that &#145;surely the problems of British shipping are the problems of Britain&#146;, and posed the question, &#145;why is this country not working any longer?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 25 Aug 2005). This gave a hint of his hostility to the strength of trade unionism in his industry, further demonstrated during the strike of the National Union of Seamen in May 1966, which he declared would be &#145;disastrous for the nation&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 May 1966).<br>
<br>From 1972 to 1975 Bolton was president of the British Shipping Federation, and he became president of the General Council of British Shipping (created through the amalgamation of the Chamber of Shipping and the British Shipping Federation) in 1975&#150;6. In this post he was vociferous in the campaign to prevent the extension of the national dock labour scheme to non-scheme ports and to all freight-handling services within 5 miles of the coast. The scheme dated from 1947 and had been a significant step in decasualizing dock labour, providing a minimum guarantee of earnings for dockers and safeguards against dismissal. Its proposed extension sought to prevent undercutting of the scheme by ports outside it that could recruit labour on a casual basis, and equally to stop inland container bases taking work away from scheme ports. Bolton instead argued that &#145;the crying need is for efficient, reliable and trouble-free ports&#146;  (<span class="italic">Port of London News</span>, Sept&#150;Oct 2005, 4). After intensive lobbying the extension bill was wrecked by amendments in the Lords. Bolton (who was knighted in 1976) was also president of the International Shipping Federation between 1973 and 1982. His last major posts were as chairman of the Dover Harbour Board (1982&#150;8) and chairman of the British Ports Association (1985&#150;8), in which posts he campaigned for the abolition of the national dock labour scheme, finally enacted by the Conservative government in 1989.<br>
<br>Tim Bolton was an enthusiastic and forceful figure with a &#145;deep sense of fun and cheerfulness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lloyd's List</span>, 14 Sept 2005), much respected in the shipping industry. He was perhaps an example of a &#145;third generation&#146; entrepreneur who accepted the &#145;aristocratic embrace&#146;, for despite his thoroughly industrial and urban origins he moved to a large farm at Pudlicote, near Charlbury in Oxfordshire, listed his recreations in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> as &#145;country sports&#146;, and for many years was joint master and chairman of the Grafton hunt. Between 1991 and 1995 he was treasurer of the West Oxfordshire Conservative Association. After his first wife's death he married, on 4 February 1971, Vanessa Mary Ann Robarts, a 31-year-old sales assistant and daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Anthony Vere Cyprian Robarts. With her he had a further two sons and two daughters. He died in his sleep while holidaying in the French Alps on 27 July 2005. His funeral took place in Chadlington, Oxfordshire. The service was preceded by a medley of Gilbert and Sullivan songs, and at the end the coffin was borne out to the theme tune of <span class="italic">The Archers</span>.<br>
