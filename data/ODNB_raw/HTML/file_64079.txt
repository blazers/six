<span class="headword">Worth,  Adam</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Henry J. Raymond]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1844&#150;1902), <span class="occ">criminal and art thief</span>, was born in eastern Germany to Jewish parents, who emigrated to Cambridge, Massachusetts, when he was a young child. Worth, who had no formal education, enlisted in the Union army in 1861 at the outset of the American Civil War. His first recorded crime was that of &#145;bounty jumping&#146;, the practice of deserting from one regiment and then signing up with another to obtain whatever bounty was on offer, which he refined to new levels by faking his own death at the second battle of Bull Run before re-enlisting under an assumed name.<br>
<br>At the end of the war Worth settled in New York and began his criminal apprenticeship as a pickpocket. With the patronage of the notorious fence Fredericka &#145;Marm&#146; Mandelbaum, he soon rose to prominence in the New York underworld, achieving distinction as a bank robber, forger, and gambler, and earning the nickname Little Adam, a sobriquet reflecting his small stature and large criminal pretensions. In November 1869, in partnership with &#145;Piano&#146; Charley Bullard, a talented pianist and safe-breaker, Worth tunnelled through the wall of the Boylston National Bank in Boston and extracted from the bank safe an estimated $200,000 in cash and securities. Pursued by the Pinkerton Detective Agency, the pair fled to England, where they met and formed an unlikely <i>m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois</i> with Kitty Flynn (<i>c</i>.1850&#150;1894), an attractive and ambitious Irish barmaid. Worth adopted the alias Henry J. Raymond, in ironic tribute to the highly respectable and recently deceased editor of the <span class="italic">New York Times</span>. After some years running an illegal gambling parlour in Paris, the trio settled in London, where Worth gradually built up an international criminal industry, of which he was the controller, banker, and principal beneficiary.<br>
<br>The detective William Pinkerton described Worth in a posthumous pamphlet (<span class="italic">Adam Worth, alias &#145;Little Adam&#146;</span>, 1904) as &#145;the most inventive and daring criminal of modern times&#146;, but he also noted that, in contrast to the vast majority of Victorian villains, Little Adam deplored violence, eschewed alcohol (at least initially), and displayed extraordinary loyalty to his associates and minions. Worth's earnings from forgery, robbery, and fraud enabled him to live the life (and adopt the views and even the accent) of a wealthy English Victorian gentleman, with an apartment in Piccadilly, a substantial mansion in Clapham, a string of racehorses, and a steam yacht. Kitty Flynn had two children attributed to Bullard (whom she had married) but who were widely believed to have been fathered by Worth between about 1869 and 1876. After Kitty Flynn left both men to marry a Cuban sugar millionaire, Worth married Louise Bohljahn about 1886, with whom he had two more children.<br>
<br>Worth's most famous crime was carried out in 1876, when he broke into the Mayfair premises of Thomas Agnew &amp; Sons, art dealers, and stole Thomas Gainsborough's portrait of Georgiana, duchess of Devonshire, which had been sold two weeks earlier for 10,100 guineas, then the highest price ever paid for a portrait at auction. He had initially intended to use the painting as ransom to extract an associate from Newgate prison. The plan came to nothing and instead, for romantic reasons that remain partly mysterious, he kept the portrait for the next twenty-four years, having designed a false-bottomed trunk in which to transport it. Worth himself described his relationship with the painting as an &#145;elopement&#146;.<br>
<br>The criminal network established by Worth, who would eventually become Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's model for the evil Professor Moriarty in the Sherlock Holmes stories, continued to expand profitably until 1892, when he was arrested in the course of a rash attempt to rob a mail carriage in the Belgian city of Li&egrave;ge. Worth was exposed, ruined, and sentenced to seven years' hard labour in the Prison de Louvain. His wife, hitherto ignorant of his real character, was placed in a lunatic asylum soon after hearing of his fate. Scotland Yard had learned, through informers, that Worth was the thief of the Gainsborough painting (which had been hidden in a warehouse before his disastrous attempted robbery in Li&egrave;ge), but all efforts to persuade him to surrender the painting, even when offered his liberty in exchange, were flatly rejected.<br>
<br>Worth obtained early release for good behaviour, but emerged from prison in poor health and broken in spirit. He soon contacted Pinkerton, his erstwhile adversary, and declared that he intended to return &#145;the Lady&#146;, less out of contrition than through a desire to provide for his two children. Protracted negotiations followed, at the culmination of which art dealer Morland Agnew travelled to a Chicago hotel and was presented with the portrait by an elderly bellboy widely believed to have been Worth himself, in disguise. Within hours of the painting's return to Britain it was purchased by the American millionaire J. Pierpont Morgan. Worth, who was by then drinking heavily, followed the portrait back to Britain. On 8 January 1902, four days after Morgan took possession of the masterpiece, Worth died at his residence at 2 Park Village East, in Camden Town, London; he was buried two days later, under the alias Henry J. Raymond, in an unmarked grave in Highgate cemetery.<br>
