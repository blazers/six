<span class="headword">Leslie <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Burr]</span>,  May Sybil</span>  (1887&#150;1937), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 14 August 1887 at Cloverfield, Woodlesford, Yorkshire, the daughter of Frederick Leslie, coalminer (and later bookseller), and his wife, Elizabeth Dickinson. She was educated at Leeds high school and on graduation in 1905 was awarded a West Riding county scholarship to study at the University of Leeds. She graduated with a first-class BSc degree in 1908 and the following year was awarded an MSc for research under H. M. Dawson. Her investigation, on the rate of reaction of iodine and acetone, has since become a classic in the field of chemical reaction kinetics.<br>
<br>In 1909 Leslie was awarded an 1851 Exhibition scholarship which she used to travel to Paris to work with Marie Curie on the extraction of new elements from the products of the radioactive decay of thorium. She spent two years at the Curie Institute, then returned to England to work for the year 1911&#150;12 at Manchester University with another famous pioneer researcher in radioactivity, Ernest Rutherford. There she continued her work with thorium and extended her studies to the element actinium. In 1912&#150;14 she taught at the Municipal High School for Girls in West Hartlepool, while commencing a study on ionization in non-aqueous solvents with Dawson at Leeds. In 1914, at a time when women rarely obtained academic positions other than at women's colleges, Leslie was appointed assistant lecturer and demonstrator of chemistry at the University College in Bangor, Wales.<br>
<br>In 1915, Leslie accepted a position as research chemist at the government explosives factory at Litherland near Liverpool. During the First World War, many male scientists had been called up for service in the armed forces and there was a desperate need for qualified research chemists to supervise the production of chemicals needed for the war effort. Her particular research elucidated the chemical reactions involved in the formation of nitric acid (a component for the synthesis of explosives) and as a result she was able to identify the optimum industrial conditions for the process. Increasing the efficiency of this process was so essential to maximizing explosives production that, after the war, she was awarded a DSc degree by the University of Leeds in recognition of her contribution. In 1916, she was promoted to chemist in charge of laboratory at Litherland. The following year, the Litherland factory closed and she was transferred with the same rank to the government factory in Penrhyndeudraeth, north Wales.<br>
<br>In 1920, Leslie was appointed to the University of Leeds as demonstrator in the department of chemistry, rising through the ranks to a position as lecturer in the department of physical chemistry in 1928. She was an active researcher, and she also wrote <span class="italic">The Alkaline Earth Metals</span> (1925) and co-authored <span class="italic">Beryllium and its Congeners</span> (1926), two titles in J. Newton Friend's comprehensive series, <span class="roman">A Textbook of Inorganic Chemistry</span>. Both books were published under her married name, M. S. Burr.<br>
<br>Leslie married Alfred Hamilton Burr (1885&#150;1933) a lecturer in chemistry at the Royal Technical College, Salford, on 29 September 1923. She resigned her position at Leeds in 1929 and moved with Burr to Scotland in 1931 when he was appointed head of the chemistry department at Coatbridge Technical College. Following Burr's death in 1933, she moved back to Leeds where her first project was the completion of her deceased husband's research on wool dyes. She also resumed research work with Dawson. Later, she was a sub-warden at Weetwood Hall, a women's residence, from 1935 to 1937. She was elected associate of the Institute of Chemistry in 1918 and fellow of the Chemical Society in 1920. She died of lung cancer at Mahlstan, Bardsey, near Leeds, on 3 July 1937, her early death possibly being the result of exposure to high levels of radiation during her time at the Curie Institute. She was cremated at Lawnswood crematorium on 6 July 1937.<br>
