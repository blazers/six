<span class="headword">Sowernam,  Ester</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1617), <span class="occ">author</span>, published a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Ester hath hang'd Haman, or, An answere to a lewd pamphlet entituled &#145;The arraignment of women&#146;: with the arraignment of lewd, idle, froward, and unconstant men, and husbands</span> in London in 1617. The pamphlet was a response to Joseph Swetnam's 1615 pamphlet <span class="italic">The Arraignment of Lewde, Idle, Froward, and Unconstant Women</span>, and was one of several published in the same year, including Rachel Speght's <span class="italic">A Mouzell for Melastomus</span> and Constantia Munda's <span class="italic">The Worming of a Mad Dogge</span>. Ester Sowernam is clearly a pseudonym: &#145;Sowernam&#146; presents a witty opposition to Swetnam, while &#145;Ester&#146; refers to the biblical figure Esther who saved her people, the Jews living in Persia, by revealing the plots against them of the Persian chief minister Haman who was consequently hanged. The actual identity of Ester Sowernam remains unknown. Since the early 1980s, when this text and others relating to early modern controversies about the nature of women attracted much feminist interest, there has been debate as to whether the author was a woman engaged in an early feminist argument, or a man taking a woman's point of view as part of a formal exercise in rhetoric or disputation, or in order to profit from exploitation of a fashionable controversy.<br>
<br>Sowernam's text itself is notable for its logical organization. Its opening contains a concise, lucid statement of purpose and method: first to &#145;deliver the worthinesse and worth of women; both in respect of their Creation as in the work of Redemption&#146; and to give biblical examples of women as &#145;gratious instruments&#146; of God; then, in the second part, to show how women have been valued in history; and finally to respond to &#145;all materiall objections&#146; against women and to &#145;arraigne&#146; all men such as Joseph Swetnam who are &#145;lewd, idle, furious and beastly disposed persons&#146;  (sigs. A2<i>v</i>&#150;A3<i>r</i>). Throughout, Sowernam uses logic and wordplay to refute Swetnam's (and traditional) railings against women, and to turn anti-women arguments back on themselves. She argues, for instance, that in the biblical account of the fall Adam was more culpable than Eve and that evil is more associated with masculinity than femininity since the serpent was &#145;of the masculine gender&#146;  (sig. B4<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Sowernam's pamphlet has literary and historical importance as an example of measured, witty polemic. It both employs and self-consciously criticizes seventeenth-century habits of arguing by means of analogy, dispute over biblical interpretation, classical logic, and play with language. It is a significant text, too, in that it has been a focus in the late twentieth century for debates over the importance of signature and the gendering of authorship. Read as a cultural artefact it offers an insight into the concerns and fashionable interests of urban, educated, middle-class women and men in the early seventeenth century.<br>
