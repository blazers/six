<span class="headword">Sutherland <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Denman]</span>,  Helen Christian</span>  (1881&#150;1965), <span class="occ">collector and patron of the arts</span>, was born on 24 February 1881 at 167 Cromwell Road, Kensington, London, the eldest of three children and the only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36373/', "Sir Thomas Sutherland (1834&#150;1922)")</script>, shipowner and Liberal Unionist MP for Greenock, and his wife, Mary Alice Morris (<i>d</i>. 1920), daughter of the Revd John Macnaught. Thomas Sutherland was a cultured man who loved the theatre, travel, and literature&#151;traits inherited by his daughter. She was educated at boarding-school in Barnet and afterwards at the Convent of the Assumption in Paris, whose frugality and order she loved. Though she appeared small and rather delicate, she even at an early age had a strong will and a desire for perfection.<br>
<br>On 11 February 1904 Sutherland married Richard Douglas Denman (<i>b</i>. 1876/7), and they set up home at Swan Walk, Chelsea. She occupied herself in voluntary work at the Lady Margaret Hall Settlement in Lambeth and in mixing among friends whom Denman introduced to her. The marriage failed and was annulled in 1913, after which she surrounded herself with their friends who included the Quaker Hodgkin family, and in particular Ellen and her husband, the archaeologist R. C. Bosanquet. Sutherland herself became a Quaker in 1914 or 1915. During the First World War she continued her social work, sheltering enemy aliens at a house in Vale Avenue.<br>
<br>On her mother's death in 1920, Sutherland, who had reverted to her maiden name, inherited a substantial fortune; her father left his own fortune to the King Edward's Hospital Fund when he died in 1922. She bought the lease on 4 Lowndes Square, London, and also rented a summer residence at Bamburgh Castle, Northumberland, to be near the Hodgkins and the Bosanquets. She also visited Paris, where she frequented exhibitions and began to buy pictures, including two by Courbet, several Persian miniatures, and works by Seurat and Andr&eacute; Derain. In 1925 she was introduced to Ben and Winifred Nicholson by her friend the painter Constance Lane, and began to buy works by them and by Paul Nash, Duncan Grant, and the French sculptor Aristide Maillol.<br>
<br>In 1929 Sutherland leased Rock Hall, near Alnwick, Northumberland. She gave up Lowndes Square and rented a flat in Grosvenor Square as a base for her frequent visits to London. Rock Hall was beautifully decorated and hung with a growing collection of art works that she regarded &#145;not as a collection but singly as particular delights, fresh experiences, sometimes as experiments&#146;  (Gray, 19). In the introduction to an exhibition of her collection held at Abbott Hall Art Gallery, Kendal, in 1964 Helen Knapp observed that &#145;Miss Sutherland does not collect as other people do: each painting, each object seems rather to be drawn to her than she to it; and becomes part of her and her ambience&#146;. Her patronage of artists, both in purchasing works and in offering other forms of support, was a major contribution to contemporary art in the 1930s. She was clear in her likes and dislikes, and concentrated on the works of those whom she knew and admired, whether professional or amateur. Among those whose work she supported were members of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98138/', "Ashingdon Artists")</script>, a group of, mainly, coalminers who had taken up art as part of a local adult education programme. Members visited Rock Hall, were introduced to artists in Sutherland's circle and, through her generosity, visited galleries in London in 1936.<br>
<br>Many guests stayed at Rock Hall, including the painter David Jones, whom Sutherland met in 1929 through a fellow art lover, Jim Ede. She was a demanding hostess whose personal regime impressed Winifred Nicholson: &#145;She had a cold bath every morning, walked every day &hellip; about twenty miles, lived on nothing but apples, grapes, pineapple and a little lettuce&#146;. But equally Sutherland impressed the painter because she &#145;carried with her a life of imagination, in which the most tangible objects were flowing streams, almost invisible new Moons, Chinese painters &hellip; the warbling of larks and wailing of curlews&#146;  (Checkland, 63). Politics and religion also played an important part in Sutherland's life: she rejoined the Church of England, though she later turned to Catholicism.<br>
<br>After the lease on Rock Hall ended Sutherland moved in 1939 to Cockley Moor, a Lakeland farmhouse above Ullswater. There, as in Northumberland, she involved herself in local issues and got to know local musicians and artists. In 1964, having become increasingly frail, she moved to a nursing home at Stoke Poges, in Buckinghamshire. She donated much of her library to Lancaster University and sold or gave away a large part of her collection, retaining just a few prized pieces, which she took with her. She died, of stomach cancer, on 29 April 1965 at Stoke Place Nursing Home. She bequeathed the remainder of her collection to Nicolete Gray. The importance of the works that Sutherland collected is reflected by their later acquisition by such major galleries as the Tate; the British Museum; the Scottish Museum of Modern Art, Edinburgh; and Kettle's Yard, Cambridge.<br>
