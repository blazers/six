<span class="headword">Fyffe,  William <span class="st"> [Will]</span></span>  (1885&#150;1947), <span class="occ">comedian and actor</span>, was born on 16 February 1885 at 36 Ferry Road, Dundee, the eldest child of John Fyffe (1864&#150;1928), ship's carpenter, and Janet Rhynd Cunningham (1858&#150;1949), music teacher. Shortly after Will was born his father left his job to form a touring company of actors who performed in a portable wooden theatre, called a geggy, which was assembled and dismantled at every venue. Will Fyffe started playing Little Willie in the stage version of Mrs Henry Wood's <span class="italic">East Lynne</span> but soon graduated to adult roles, appearing as Polonius when just fifteen. Geggy actors had to be versatile and quick learners because programmes changed nightly and in later life Will Fyffe attributed much of his success, especially in films, to this early training. He married Lily Wilcock (<i>c</i>.1884&#150;1917?), an actress, on 13 November 1905; they had two daughters. Fyffe left his father's company to gain experience in companies touring England and Wales but, as live theatre lost out to touring moving picture shows, decided to switch to the variety stage. His act followed the pattern set by earlier Scottish performers with songs in character interspersed with comic patter, and the years spent in England ensured that he was as readily understood there as he was in Scotland.<br>
<br>About 1920 Fyffe offered his most famous song, &#145;I belong to Glasgow&#146;, to Harry Lauder, and when Lauder turned it down Fyffe performed it himself at the Glasgow Pavilion. It was a huge success and led to a booking at the London Palladium. By 1921 he was topping the bill in London and in 1922 appeared in the first of his five royal command performances. His first wife had died in a shipping tragedy, and on 23 February that year he married the singer Emmeline Eugenie Pooley (1896&#150;1979); they had a daughter and son. In 1927 he made the first of many successful visits to North America and tours of Australia and South Africa followed. Not since Harry Lauder more than twenty years earlier had a Scottish comedian gained such acclaim; Fyffe and Lauder never performed together, but were friendly off-stage with shared passions for fishing and golf. Fyffe added quality of material and meticulous attention to detail to his flair for characterization. His widow wrote of his &#145;genius for living all his characters &hellip; which was shared by his genius for make up and dress to which he gave a lot of thought and attention&#146;  (Fyffe, 20 June 1955).<br>
<br>A young simpleton, Daft Sandy, was Fyffe's greatest creation, in whom he combined comedy and pathos to telling effect. His characters such as the drunk working man were drawn from life and it was a habit of his to go incognito into public places just to observe his fellow men. He was also a supreme pantomimist and co-starred with Harry Gordon in a series of productions at the Glasgow Alhambra in the 1940s which are considered classics of their kind. Fyffe was the main comic lead, always named Willie, while Gordon took the part of the dame. Throughout his career Fyffe took pride in the fact that his material could never be considered suggestive or offensive and famously walked out of a production on New York's Broadway after the first night because it was &#145;a dirty show&#146;  (House, <span class="italic">Music Hall Memories</span>, 46).<br>
<br>Fyffe made a number of films of which <span class="italic">Owd Bob</span> (1938), <span class="italic">The Brothers</span> (1947), and <span class="italic">Rulers of the Sea</span> (1939) are perhaps the pick. He completed the last in Hollywood and turned down a number of lucrative offers to remain in America in order to return to Britain at the outbreak of the Second World War. By December 1939 he was entertaining troops in France; he was appointed CBE in 1942 for his war work and efforts for charities over many years.<br>
<br>After an operation on his right ear in December 1947 Fyffe went to recuperate at the hotel he had bought in St Andrews. On 14 December he fell from the window of his suite and died in the local cottage hospital from the shock and injuries received. He was buried at the Western Necropolis in Glasgow on Wednesday 17 December 1947.<br>
