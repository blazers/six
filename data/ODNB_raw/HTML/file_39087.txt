<span class="headword">Jesse <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Harwood]</span>,  Wynifried Margaret <span class="st"> [Fryniwyd; </span></span> <span class="st"> <em>pseud. </em>F. Tennyson Jesse]</span>  (1888&#150;1958), <span class="occ">writer and criminologist</span>, was born Wynifried Margaret Jesse on 1 March 1888 at Holly Bowers, Chislehurst, Kent, second of three daughters of the Revd Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt Jesse (1853&#150;1927), a high Anglican clergyman, and his wife, Edith Louisa James (1866&#150;1941), second child of a self-made Cornishman. Jesse's paternal grandmother, a sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27137/', "Alfred Tennyson")</script>, had been engaged to A. H. Hallam (the subject of Tennyson's <span class="italic">In Memoriam</span>) at the time of his tragic death. With no settled career, her father often went abroad, sometimes taking the family, and she early imbibed the love of travel. Her mother seemed to cherish ill health and became increasingly erratic and bad-tempered. Jesse recalled an &#145;infinite succession&#146; of lodgings as a dreary feature of her childhood. Her formal education was mostly at various day schools, but from an early age she showed both an aptitude for art and the gift of independent thought. In her nineteenth year she went to study art under Stanhope and Elizabeth Forbes at the Newlyn School in Cornwall, where she acquired the name Fryniwyd, edited the colony's short-lived magazine, and exhibited a few pictures.<br>
<br>Realizing that her m&eacute;tier lay more in writing than in art, Jesse descended on London in 1911 and was soon contributing to leading dailies under her gender-neutral <i>nom de plume</i> F. Tennyson Jesse. In 1912 her short story &#145;The Mask&#146; was published to acclaim in the influential <span class="italic">English Review</span>. It attracted the attention of the successful playwright <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48546/', "Harold Marsh (Tottie) Harwood (1874&#150;1959)")</script>, who wanted to dramatize it (and who on 9 September 1918 married her), and of William Heinemann, who offered to publish her first novel. She later described <span class="italic">The Milky Way</span> (1913) as a light-hearted affair and a &#145;very bad book&#146;, but in a contemporary review in the <span class="italic">Daily News and Leader</span> Rebecca West said the author had shown herself &#145;a master of descriptive prose&#146;.<br>
<br>Jesse had been launched on a literary career that would span nearly forty-five years. Her <i>&#339;uvre</i>, of an uncommon range, was to include nine novels, three books of short stories, two of poems, and four volumes of <i>belles-lettres</i>, three plays (and another six&#151;including <span class="italic">Billeted</span>, 1917&#151;with Harwood), a history of Burma, and eight books on criminology.<br>
<br>Long wanting to fly, Jesse went up in a pusher-type aircraft over Lake Windermere. Unaware of any danger, she waved to people below and put her right hand into the invisibly spinning propeller just behind her. Seven unsuccessful operations to save her fingers followed, and to enable her to bear the pain she was prescribed morphia, to which she became addicted. She was fitted with a mechanical device, which she called her &#145;pandy&#146;, and courageously resumed her travels. In 1914 she persuaded the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> to send her to the Belgian front as a war correspondent, one of the few women then to achieve that status. Visits to France followed and the Ministry of Information asked her to write about the women's army; <span class="italic">The Sword of Deborah</span> (1919) was the vividly written result.<br>
<br>The twenties and thirties were decades of wide travel and of intense literary activity, with diversity the keynote. A success in one genre was followed by a move into another. &#145;That is why I have never been a best seller,&#146; Jesse once explained  (J. Colenbrander, &#145;Introduction&#146; to F. T. Jesse, <span class="italic">The Lacquer Lady</span>, 1984 reprint). In the highly respected <span class="italic">Murder and its Motives</span> (1924, rev. edn 1952), in which she illustrated the six motives with celebrated cases, she coined the word &#145;murderee&#146; to describe those who laid themselves out to be murdered. Francis Camps, an expert in forensic medicine, described her as one of England's greatest criminologists. Harry Hodge, publisher of the renowned <span class="roman">Notable British Trials</span>, recruited her as his first woman editor, and she produced six in the series, starting with Madeleine Smith in 1927 and including Rattenbury and Stoner (1935) and finally Evans and Christie in 1957. She attended trials and went to crime venues to soak up atmosphere.<br>
<br>A chance meeting in Burma, which led to Jesse hearing at first hand the story behind the British annexation of Upper Burma in 1885, gave rise to her most critically acclaimed novel. <span class="italic">The Lacquer Lady</span> (1929) is a remarkable vision of life at the royal palace with its splendours and its horrors seen through the eyes of a young woman who becomes the favourite of the Burmese queen. It was the Book Society's choice for January 1930 and the book Jesse felt she should live by.<br>
<br>Jesse's other well-known novel, <span class="italic">A Pin to See the Peepshow</span> (1934), was based on the Thompson&#150;Bywaters case. The hanging of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57562/', "Edith Jessie Thompson")</script> outraged her, as did injustice wherever it was found. She assiduously espoused the cause of women, firmly believing that women should hold any post of which they were capable. However, as early as 1919 she asserted: &#145;I am not, and never have been a feminist &hellip; never having been able to divide humanity into two different classes labelled &#147;men&#148; and &#147;women&#148;&#146;  (F. T. Jesse, <span class="italic">Sword of Deborah</span>, 1919, 7). In 1948 she and Harwood wrote a dramatized version of her novel, which led to a row with the lord chamberlain.<br>
<br>In 1939 Jesse and Harwood began a correspondence with friends in America in which they reported on the political events and their personal experiences during the first two years of the Second World War. The letters were published as <span class="italic">London Front</span> (1940) and <span class="italic">While London Burns</span> (1942). Another war book was <span class="italic">The Saga of the &#145;San Demetrio&#146;</span> (1942), a classic and moving account of a tanker set ablaze by a German raider and then reboarded and salvaged by some of her crew. It was later filmed.<br>
<br>There is compassion in Jesse's writing, even though she made so many of her fictional characters die. Her prose style is direct and engaging and her descriptive passages reveal a painter's eye. Her imagination was that of a poet, but always under control. She was very much a down-to-earth romantic.<br>
<br>Jesse was delicately built with golden hair when young, had large grey-green eyes, and was renowned for an aura which captivated men and women alike. She personally deprecated her looks&#151;&#145;It was the beauty of youth and it did not last long&#146;  (Colenbrander, 65)&#151;but Rebecca West said she had never seen a lovelier girl and claimed her to be one of the three great beauties of the time, the only flaw her voice&#151;West called it hideous, others stentorian, though it improved as Jesse grew older  (ibid., 78). She loved good conversation and regarded letter writing as a natural function, and her sense of humour illuminated both. She was generous with her time for her friends, but periodically crippling depression brought despair, distrust, the inability to work, and uncharacteristic unkindness, and even attempts at suicide. Three miscarriages and the strain of keeping her marriage a secret for several years&#151;her husband feared that he would lose access to his son should his married mistress hear of it&#151;also cast shadows over a relationship which nevertheless endured until Jesse's death. Jesse died of a heart attack on 6 August 1958 at her home, Pear Tree Cottage, 11 Melina Place, St John's Wood, London, and was cremated at Golders Green.<br>
