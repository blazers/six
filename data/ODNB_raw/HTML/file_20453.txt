<span class="headword">O'Brien,  Donough</span>, fourth earl of Thomond  (<em>d.</em> 1624), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20446/', "Conor O'Brien, third earl of Thomond (d. 1581)")</script>, and his second wife, &Uacute;na (<i>d</i>. 1589), daughter of Turlough Mac I Brien Arra of Arra, co. Tipperary. He was educated at Elizabeth's court and was described as &#145;as truly English as if he had been born in Middlesex&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1600</i>, 111). He was still at the court in 1577 when he was mentioned in a new patent granted to his father (7 October) as baron of Ibrickan in Clare. Shired by Sir Henry Sidney in 1565, the county was then added to the province of Connaught. Due to Donough O'Brien's persistence in seeking the county's removal from Connaught jurisdiction it was assigned to Munster in 1602. O'Brien succeeded his father as fourth earl of Thomond in 1581 and returned to Ireland the following year. By 1585 new arrangements for the government of the province, known as the composition of Connaught, were introduced. These involved the introduction of rent payments instead of dues and services, and abolished the names, styles, and titles of native Irish authorities. Thomond was declared overlord of the main portion of his lordship but did not secure a palatine jurisdiction like that held by the earls of Ormond or Desmond, though it was said that &#145;he lookith for like libertyes in <i>Toomond</i>&#146;  (Collins, 1.226). Rather, two large areas were put under the control of collateral branches of the O'Briens. Early suspicions of his loyalty on his return to Ireland may have stemmed from these divisions of patrimonial lands. However, he proved that his loyalty was in no doubt, shrewdly calculating that he had more to gain as an earl with an English-style title than as the Gaelic O'Brien. Accordingly he was assiduous in his attendance on the lord deputy, Sir John Perrot, in 1584, and in April 1585 he attended the parliament in Dublin. He keenly promoted English reforms and subdued rival O'Briens, and was appointed to the Connaught council in 1588.<br>
<br>Thomond played a prominent part as a staunch ally of the crown during the war against Hugh O'Neill, earl of Tyrone. In July 1595 he commanded a large force to the Erne fords and succeeded in penetrating the territory of Tyrone's ally Red Hugh O'Donnell in modern Donegal, but had to withdraw the following month. In September 1596 the then lord deputy Sir William Russell sent him to aid in the defence of Newry with five companies of foot soldiers and 145 horse. In 1597 he accompanied Russell and commanded in the campaigns of Russell's successor, Thomas, Lord Burgh, mainly on the borders of Ulster at the Blackwater Fort. For most of 1598 he was back in London during a year in which O'Neill's victories encouraged insurrection throughout Ireland. On 6 December he was given a royal warrant to command the forces of Munster, but under the jurisdiction of Sir Thomas Norris, lord president of the province.<br>
<br>In Clare, Thomond's brother Tadhg or Teige O'Brien of Dromore had been accused of seeking aid for the O'Neill cause from the king of Spain. He was imprisoned in Limerick and released on protesting his loyalty, but joined Red Hugh O'Donnell when, in 1599, he reinvested north Connaught and again invaded Clare. O'Donnell captured most of the castles, ravaged the countryside, and took prisoner Thomond's other, youngest, brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20447/', "Daniel O'Brien")</script>, who was defending the territory in his absence. On his return from England, Thomond spent three months in Kilkenny with his kinsman the earl of Ormond collecting forces and ordnance from Limerick to recover his possessions and avenge his brother's capture. That summer he laid siege to such castles as resisted. Dunbeg, defending the Bay of Dunmore, surrendered to him instantly but he had the entire garrison hanged in couples on trees. During the remainder of the year he accompanied the new chief governor, the second earl of Essex, on his Munster progress, was appointed governor of co. Clare on 15 August, and made a member of the Munster council on 22 September. He vigorously assisted Sir George Carew, president of Munster, in the prosecution of the war throughout 1600. In April, while in a parley with Owen McRory O'More which ended in a m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, he and Carew narrowly escaped capture and though Thomond received a pike wound in the back, he managed to save Carew's life. He was also in the thick of the action against Florence MacCarthy Reagh (confirmed as the MacCarthy More by Hugh O'Neill), helping to bring him to submission in May 1600. In June he was in Clare repulsing further O'Donnell raids. He entertained the new lord deputy, Mountjoy, at Bunratty Castle, which he was later to refortify and glaze. In February 1601 he held an assize in Limerick at which sixteen men were hanged. Again he went to England to pursue his causes, especially to get his patrimonial lands transferred into Munster. Fynes Moryson, Mountjoy's secretary, thought Thomond much preferred attendance at court to action in the field, a comment perhaps occasioned by the usual delays in England in getting reinforcements to Ireland.<br>
<br>At length Thomond set off from Bristol with 1000 foot and 100 horse and, though some of his ships were blown off course, made a landing at Castlehaven on 11 November 1601. He proceeded to encamp on the west side of Kinsale on Ballincubby Hill to prevent a junction between the besieged Spaniards and O'Donnell, and took a prominent part in the ensuing siege and battle. After the Spanish surrender he proceeded to mop up pockets of resistance in the Bantry Bay area. The siege of Dunboy (11&#150;18 June), which had been fortified by Donal O'Sullivan Beare and was resolutely held by its constable, Richard MacGeoghegan, was his last great military action. On its final capitulation on 18 June 1602 he hanged fifty-eight of the survivors.<br>
<br>Once again Thomond sailed for England and in recognition of his &#145;forward services&#146; his demand for the transfer of Clare was granted, despite the opposition of the lord deputy and the Irish council. He returned to Ireland in early October 1602 and, as a further reward, the queen ordered his name be placed next to those of the lord deputy and the lord chief justice in commissions of oyer and terminer and gaol delivery. In September 1603 his governorship of co. Clare was confirmed and he was appointed to the Irish privy council. On 30 July 1604 he was appointed constable of Carlow, and subsequently given a grant of that manor. In the 1613 parliament he strongly supported the protestant party in opposition to the recusants in the disputes over the election of the speaker to the Irish House of Commons, although he had previously blocked the attempt of the administration to exclude certain Catholic Munster peers from parliament. On 6 May 1615 he became lord president of Munster. He proved an energetic lord president, moved the presidency headquarters to Limerick, and acquired former plantation lands in co. Limerick. He became one of the sureties for Florence MacCarthy Reagh, who, since his surrender in 1600, had been in the Tower, where he wrote on the antiquities and prehistory of Ireland and dedicated these studies to Thomond.<br>
<br>Thomond was married twice, first to Eveleen or Ellen (<i>d</i>. 1583), daughter of Maurice Roche, Viscount Fermoy. By his second marriage, to Lady Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1618), fourth daughter of Gerard Fitzgerald, eleventh earl of Kildare, he had two sons, Henry, fifth earl (<i>d</i>. 1639), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20440/', "Barnabas or Barnaby O'Brien, sixth earl of Thomond (1590/91&#150;1657)")</script>. Tadhg O'Brien survived until at least 20 January 1642, while Daniel O'Brien, later first Viscount Clare, became a leading confederate. Elizabeth, countess of Thomond, died on 12 January 1618 and her husband on 5 September 1624. He was buried in St Mary's Cathedral, Limerick, where a fine monument with a marble incised inscription was erected to his memory by his son Henry; it was destroyed in 1642, and re-erected by Henry, the seventh earl, in 1678. In a letter of 27 September 1600 George Carey, Lord Hunsdon, had written:<blockquote>If the rest of the Irish nobility had followed the example of my noble friend the Earl of Thomond her Majesty's expenses and losses had never been as they are and will be. His services hath proceeded out of a true nobleness of mind and from no great encouragement received from hence. (Brewer and Bullen, 3.450)</blockquote>
