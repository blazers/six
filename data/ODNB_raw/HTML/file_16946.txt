<span class="headword">Loggon,  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1711, <em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1778), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was baptized on 29 July 1711 at Cradley, Herefordshire, the son of William Loggon and his wife, Anna. He had at least four brothers and a sister. Loggon matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, on 23 January 1730, graduated BA in 1733, and proceeded MA in 1736. He became curate of Eastrop and Sherborne St John, near Basingstoke. On 15 October 1740 he was elected usher of the free school of the Holy Ghost at Basingstoke by the corporation of Basingstoke, following a dispute over its patronage.<br>
<br>In 1743 he became curate of Stratfield Turgis in Hampshire, and on 18 July 1743, through the petition of Lord Portsmouth to the lord chancellor, he was appointed master of the free school of the Holy Ghost by letters patent. This ancient foundation was at the time in a ruinous condition, and in 1743 Loggon had the estate surveyed, and suggested that some of the income of the mastership be allocated for its improvement. In 1744 he presented a petition on the subject to Lord Hardwicke, and as he alleged that the corporation had wrongfully encroached on land owned by the foundation, he treated the town council with insolence. On 7 October 1745 the town clerk was authorized to take proceedings against him for neglecting his duties as schoolmaster, but as the inhabitants generally sided with Loggon nothing was done. In fact in 1747 the Sir John Deane lectureship was added to his preferment as master.<br>
<br>On 16 December 1746 Loggon was instituted to the rectory of Stratfield Turgis by George Pitt (afterwards Lord Rivers) of Stratfield Saye, a position he resigned in November 1748 on being presented, again by Mr Pitt, to the vicarage of Damerham in Wiltshire. He remained resident at Basingstoke and in periodic dispute with the corporation. He also appears to have undertaken duties as curate of the nearby parishes of Sherborne St John and Tunworth, providing both with &#145;double duty&#146; each Sunday. He died unmarried at Basingstoke about 1778, and was buried, in accordance with his wishes, in a sawpit, in the churchyard of Stratfield Turgis.<br>
<br>Loggon was eccentric in his habits, wore two shirts, and drank stale beer. He collected a large number of manuscripts, which he offered to the corporation of Basingstoke in return for a piece of plate; the corporation would not accept this condition, and the manuscripts passed to his nephew. His selected translation <span class="italic">Colloquies of Corderius</span> (1759), which he had written for use at the school of the Holy Ghost, were extremely popular, running into twelve editions in his lifetime.<br>
