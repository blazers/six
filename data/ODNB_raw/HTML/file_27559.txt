<span class="headword">Torporley,  Nathaniel</span>  (1564&#150;1632), <span class="occ">mathematician</span>, was born in Shropshire of unknown parentage and admitted to Shrewsbury's Free Grammar School as an &#145;oppidan&#146; in 1571. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 17 November 1581 as a &#145;plebeian&#146; and graduated BA on 5 February 1584. He then departed to France where his mathematical knowledge equipped him to serve as secretary to the famous French mathematician Fran&ccedil;ois Vi&egrave;te (1540&#150;1603). He was probably the link between Vi&egrave;te and the English mathematician Thomas Harriot; in a letter to Harriot from Paris, probably written in 1586, Torporley refers to his journey via Gravesend, Calais, and Amiens. He probably returned to Oxford in 1587 or 1588, and proceeded MA from Brasenose College on 8 July 1591.<br>
<br>Torporley entered holy orders and was appointed rector of Salwarpe, Worcestershire, on 14 June 1608, a living he held until 1622. He was also rector of Liddington, Wiltshire, in 1611. For most of the time, however, he resided chiefly at Sion College, on London Wall. Torporley's knowledge of mathematics and astronomy attracted the notice of Henry Percy, ninth earl of Northumberland, who may have supported him, although the only recorded payment dates from 1627. On 27 November 1605, just after the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot, Torporley was examined by the council for having cast the king's nativity. At Harriot's death in 1621 he was named in the will as overseer of Harriot's mathematical writings.<br>
<br>Apart from several mathematical works left in manuscript, Torporley published <span class="italic">Diclides coelometricae</span> (1602), in which he expounded a simplified spherical trigonometry designed for computing astronomical tables. While accepting the Copernican system, he briefly presented a bizarre explanation for the planetary orbits. The French astronomer J. B. J. Delambre, writing in 1821, found the entire book tedious, and described Torporley's so-called new and simplified astronomical tables as the most obscure and difficult which he had ever encountered. Torporley also designed a new type of semicircle, and his sundial and perpetual calendar was constructed by the instrument maker Charles Whitwell (<i>d</i>. 1611).<br>
<br>Torporley died in Sion College and was buried in the adjacent church of St Alphege on 17 April 1632. He left a nuncupative will dated 14 April, by which he bequeathed to Sion College all his mathematical books and manuscripts, astronomical instruments, notes, maps, and a brass clock. Administration was granted to his married sister, Susanna Tasker.<br>
