<span class="headword">Seagrave <span class="st"> [Segrave]</span>, Sir  Gilbert  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1254), <span class="occ">administrator and justice</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25041/', "Stephen of Seagrave (d. 1241)")</script> of Seagrave, Leicestershire, and Rohesia, daughter of Thomas Despenser. His elder brother, John, having died, Gilbert succeeded to his father's estates in Leicestershire, Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Nottinghamshire, and Derbyshire on his father's death in 1241.<br>
<br>The door to royal service was no doubt opened for Seagrave by his father, the justiciar. He was in Brittany before 1232, probably during Henry III's campaign of 1230&#150;31, and in 1233 he escorted from Northampton to Gloucester the proceeds of the fortieth from Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire. As part of the distribution of spoils on the death of Ranulf (III), earl of Chester, Seagrave received custody of the manor and castle of Newcastle under Lyme in December 1232, and in 1233 was granted Burton and part of Horncastle for his maintenance in the king's service. But when the father fell, so did the son; he had to surrender Newcastle and answer proceedings against him in June 1234. Although Stephen of Seagrave was back in the king's favour by 1236, Gilbert seems to have remained outside the favoured circle until after his father's death, when he was pardoned the relief due on his father's lands. He was appointed justice of the forests south of the Trent in May 1242 and governor of Kenilworth Castle from 1242 to 1244. There is no record that Gilbert acted as justice of the forest after October 1245. In 1248 he paid the king 100 marks to be quit of all claims arising from tenure of that office.<br>
<br>In 1251 Seagrave emerged again from obscurity, sitting as a justice in king's bench and as one of the justices to hear pleas in the city of London. In August 1253 he accompanied the king to Gascony where he continued to act as a justice, and in the following January he was sent home by the king as one of his messengers to ask for money from a parliament. He later rejoined the king, and was in Gascony on 16 June, and at Bordeaux as late as 7 September. Very soon afterwards, on a mission with Simon de Montfort to persuade Alexander III, king of Scots, to support Henry III's Sicilian enterprise, he started home through Poitou in the company of John de Plessis, earl of Warwick, and other nobles. Despite a safe conduct from Louis IX, the party was treacherously seized by the citizens of Pons in Poitou, where Seagrave fell ill, and died in prison before 8 October. On 12 October his wardships, and the wardship of his own lands during his son's minority, were granted to the king's son Edward.<br>
<br>By 30 September 1231 Seagrave had married Amabilia, daughter and heir of Robert of Chalcombe; she was still living in 1282. They had two children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25039/', "Nicholas of Seagrave")</script>, who became first Lord Seagrave, and Alice, wife of William Mauduit, earl of Warwick. Matthew Paris describes him as &#145;a man noble and rich and of fine character&#146;  (Paris, <span class="italic">Chron</span>., 5.463).<br>
