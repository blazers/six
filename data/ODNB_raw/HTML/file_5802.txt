<span class="headword">Coenred</span>  (<em>d.</em> after 709), <span class="occ">king of the Mercians</span>, succeeded his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52315/', "&#198;thelred")</script> as king in 704, when the latter retired to the monastery at Bardney. He was the son of the previous Mercian king, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30093/', "Wulfhere (d. 675)")</script>, but may have been too young to have been his father's immediate successor. &AElig;thelred seems to have remained an influential figure in the life of the new king: in 705 he summoned Coenred to Bardney and persuaded him to support and protect the exiled Bishop Wilfrid. According to the life of St Guthlac, there were serious Welsh raids into Mercia during Coenred's reign and he may have been recognized as overlord by the rulers of the kingdom of the Hwicce, for he attests the record of a grant of land in Warwickshire by &AElig;thelheard and &AElig;thelweard to an Abbess Cuthswith  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1177).<br>
<br>At some point in 704 or afterwards Coenred confirmed a grant of land at Twickenham to Waldhere, bishop of London, which shows that his power, like that of his predecessor &AElig;thelred, extended into Middlesex. In a letter which Bishop Waldhere wrote to Berhtwald, archbishop of Canterbury, in 704 or 705, he mentions that he had been summoned by Coenred to a meeting of bishops and noblemen who were to address the &#145;reconciliation&#146; of a certain woman named &AElig;lfthryth; he had declined to go, because he was uncertain of the archbishop's views on the issue (which was evidently a major controversy, although its details are now entirely unknown). St Paul's Church in London claimed that it had received a grant of privileges from Coenred, confirming an earlier grant by &AElig;thelberht of Kent; but the charter preserved in the archive  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1786) is clearly spurious, as are a series of diplomas in Coenred's name in favour of the abbey at Evesham  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 78, 79, 80). More convincing is a fragmentary record of a grant by Coenred to a nun named Feleburg of land in Herefordshire, which apparently passed into the possession of the minster at Much Wenlock in Shropshire  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1801).<br>
<br>Coenred is likely to have been a significant patron of the church, for he would appear to have been a deeply religious man; Bede tells the story of his fervent attempts to reform one of his noble companions, who fell ill and died after experiencing a vision of hell. William of Malmesbury claims that it was this episode which prompted Coenred in 709 to resign his kingdom and travel to Rome, but that is probably no more than an inference from Bede's narrative. Coenred had before him the example of his uncle &AElig;thelred, and that of an earlier West Saxon ruler, C&aelig;dwalla, who had abdicated in order to go as a pilgrim to Rome; moreover, other Anglo-Saxon rulers had been, and were to be, attracted by the idea of such pious rejection of their worldly status. Coenred was accompanied on his pilgrimage by Offa, the son of Sigeberht, king of the East Saxons; their arrival in Rome with a large following was significant enough to be recorded in the <span class="italic">Liber pontificalis</span>. Coenred was tonsured by Pope Constantine and spent the remainder of his life as a monk in Rome. The date of his death is unknown. He was succeeded as king by his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5000/', "Ceolred")</script>.<br>
