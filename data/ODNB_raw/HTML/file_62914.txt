<span class="headword">Morris,  William</span>  (1705&#150;1763), <span class="occ">antiquary and botanist</span>, was born on 1 May 1705 at Fferam in the parish of Llanfihangel Tre'r-beirdd, Anglesey, the third of five children of Morris Prichard (1674&#150;1763), cooper, tenant farmer, and small merchant, and Marged Morris (1671&#150;1752). Both parents were of Anglesey gentry stock. In 1707 William moved with his parents and three brothers to Pentre-eiriannell, a farm in the neighbouring parish of Penrhosllugwy, overlooking the Dulas estuary.<br>
<br>William was taught to read by his father and for a short time attended a school near the parish church. As well as helping his father on the farm it is more than likely that he also assisted him in running a sloop which traded on the coast of north Wales and as far as Liverpool. This activity eventually led him, in 1726, to that port, where, for the following ten years, he was employed by a Welsh merchant, Owen Prichard, a native of Anglesey, who through his marriage with Philipia Wright in 1718 had become stepfather to Fortunatus Wright (1712&#150;1757), the famous privateer.<br>
<br>In March 1737 Morris was appointed deputy comptroller of the customs and also comptroller of the coal duties at Holyhead, where his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19313/', "Lewis Morris")</script>, had been customs officer since 1729. William was to hold this post, with its short hours and long periods of inactivity, for the remainder of his life. On 5 February 1745 he married Jane (1719&#150;1750), daughter of Robert Hughes of Holyhead, the owner of a small estate in the parish of Llanfigel, Anglesey, which was subsequently inherited by William's son, Robert. Two other children were born of this marriage: William (died an infant in December 1748) and Jane. Morris's wife died and was buried on 2 May 1750; he did not remarry.<br>
<br>From early childhood Morris had been immersed in the folk culture of Anglesey, where poetry and music were still transmitted orally. Little is known of his literary pursuits while he was at Liverpool, but from there he began to correspond with his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19315/', "Richard Morris")</script>, who had settled in London in 1722, and with his brother Lewis in Anglesey, a correspondence which continued for the remainder of their lives. A substantial number of these letters has survived, and show how varied the Morrises' interests were.<br>
<br>While settled at Holyhead, William Morris's various interests became evident. He derived great pleasure from gardening and not only secured seeds and plants from various contacts in London but also from seamen, who at his request brought them from foreign lands. This led him to a serious study of botany. With the help of specialist books on the subject he began forming a catalogue of plants with their Latin, Welsh, and English names, and his search for specimens took him to Snowdonia and as far as Flintshire. Morris's life as a naturalist was in part inspired by his relationship with the young Thomas Pennant (1726&#150;1798), the famous naturalist, whom he assisted unsparingly. Not surprisingly Morris was the only subscriber from north Wales to Pennant's <span class="italic">British Zoology</span> (1766), which began to appear in parts before Morris's death. He formed his own collection of fossils, shells, birds, minerals, and such like, and through Pennant became acquainted with other botanists and naturalists in England, Ireland, and on the continent. This meant that when he discovered a unique fish, <i>Leptocephalus</i>, near Holyhead, not only was this recorded by L. T. Gronovius of Leiden in his <span class="italic">Zoophylacium</span>, but also it was named after Morris &#145;in memory of our worthy friend&#146;  (Pennant, 139).<br>
<br>Morris was also a staunch and reliable supporter of his brother Richard's literary and scholarly pursuits in London. This brother edited the Welsh versions of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> in 1746 and 1752, and secured the help of William and others to read the proofs. Richard Morris was secretary of the Cymmrodorion Society, established in 1751 and based in London, and his brother William participated fully in its activities, becoming a corresponding member.<br>
<br>Through the guidance and influence of his elder brother, Lewis, William Morris mastered the whole span of the Welsh bardic tradition. He formed his own collections of poetry and notably acquired a seventeenth-century manuscript which contained the poetry of the Welsh princes  (BL, Add. MS 14869). The collection ranged from the works of the fourteenth-century poet Dafydd ap Gwilym to that of his own eighteenth-century contemporaries. Morris's antiquarian interests extended from Celtic saints and Welsh proverbs to Welsh traditional music.<br>
<br>Although William Morris lacked the academic ability of his brother Lewis, the mainspring of the great Welsh literary revival of the first half of the eighteenth century, William, through his genial support and varied and general interests, was an integral part of that revival; and through his untiring correspondence he was an inspiration to the other members of the Morris literary and scholarly circle. He was nevertheless also fond of people and strove to help the needy. He died on 28 December 1763 at Holyhead and was buried the following day, probably with his infant son and wife in the churchyard at Holyhead.<br>
