<span class="headword">Malberthorpe, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1331/2), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was the son and heir of Sir William of Malberthorpe, lord of the manor of Mablethorpe, Lincolnshire, where in 1296 he was licensed to have a private chapel and from which his family took its name. Robert Malberthorpe seems to have been destined for the legal profession from the start, being recorded as a serjeant, or countor, in the common bench as early as 1299. By 1311 he was being employed by the city of London, while in 1313&#150;14 he was one of a number of leading serjeants, or <i>narratores</i>, to be retained by Thomas, earl of Lancaster. He remained active in the common bench until 1320, when on 1 August he was appointed a justice of king's bench, a promotion which T. F. Tout believed that Malberthorpe, together with such distinguished contemporaries as John Stonor and Geoffrey Scrope, owed to their &#145;distinction as advocates&#146;  (Tout, 369). In the same year Edward II granted Malberthorpe the wardship and marriage of Adam Welle, the heir to considerable estates in Lincolnshire and elsewhere. It is a measure of the grantee's professional earnings that he could undertake to pay 1800 marks for this, in six annual instalments. By 1326 he had been knighted.<br>
<br>Malberthorpe inevitably became involved in the administration of justice in the localities, being appointed to numerous commissions, especially for Lincolnshire and its neighbouring counties, as well as to one in November 1323 investigating corruption by royal and local officials in Derbyshire, Staffordshire, and Shropshire. He was also intermittently involved in national politics. In 1320 he was named&#151;along with Sir Bartholomew Badlesmere and Hugh Despenser the younger&#151;to commissions intended to help the Despensers deal with the opposition they faced from John Mowbray and his allies over their claims to the lordship of Gower. Then on 20 March 1322, following the battle of Boroughbridge, it was Malberthorpe who in the king's name passed judgment of death on the defeated earl of Lancaster&#151;an act for which he would need a pardon following Edward II's deposition. On 30 May 1323 he attended the great council at Bishopthorpe, near York, which negotiated a truce with the Scots, having been ordered &#145;to come with all speed by day and night to York there to await the coming of the king, who desires to have counsel and treaty with Robert and others of his council&#146;  (<span class="italic">CClR</span>, <i>1318&#150;23</i>, 712), while in 1324 he was appointed to a commission to inquire into those who had assisted the recent rebels in Shropshire, Staffordshire, Worcestershire, Gloucestershire, and Herefordshire, and to take ransoms and fines from those convicted.<br>
<br>Despite having apparently enjoyed the favour of Edward II, Malberthorpe continued to thrive during both the minority regime of Roger Mortimer and Queen Isabella and (from 1330) the majority of Edward III. He retained the wardship granted to him by the latter's father, and in July 1327 he was commissioned with other barons and justices to give &#145;effect to the statute annulling all fines, sales etc after the time of the exile of Hugh the elder and Hugh the younger made under distress&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1327&#150;30</i>, 153). In February 1329 he was involved in the sessions at the London Guildhall that judged the rebels led by Henry of Lancaster against the regime of Isabella and Mortimer. Malberthorpe had continued to serve as a justice of king's bench, and on 1 May 1329 he was made chief justice of that court, a position that he held until 28 October following. His replacement by Sir Henry Scrope was doubtless due to his having been appointed on 22 October a justice for eyres in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. Proceedings at Derby were not concluded until May 1331, but earlier that year Malberthorpe was recalled to Westminster, having been appointed a justice of common pleas on 18 January, a position he held into the following Michaelmas term. He had died by 21 January 1332, however, when the escheator was instructed to take his lands into the king's hand, as those of a tenant-in-chief. But no will or inquisition post mortem survives, and there is no record of his having married or had children.<br>
