<span class="headword">Oates,  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1614, <em>d.</em> 1683), <span class="occ">General Baptist preacher and Leveller</span>, was baptized at St Saviour's Church, Norwich, on 26 September 1614, the son of Titus Oates, a Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Anne. He is not to be confused with a namesake, the son of another Norfolk clergyman, born at Marsham in 1610. Nothing is known of Oates's youth, and we have only his own claim, reported by John Drew, that during the early 1640s he received &#145;a direct and lawful call from a church in Norfolke to a pastorall charge there&#146;  (Drew, 11). In 1647 hostile witnesses described him variously as a weaver and a button maker.<br>
<br>Oates was probably rebaptized by Thomas Lamb, the soapboiler, perhaps on the latter's visit to Norwich in early 1642. Oates's fame spread quickly: on 14 December 1643, at Westminster, John Lightfoot referred to him as a &#145;notorious anabaptist about Norwich&#146;  (<span class="italic">Whole Works</span>, 13.81). Oates continued there for some months, but visited London in early 1645, preaching at Lamb's church in Bell Alley. He seems to have joined that congregation soon after, and in September set off with Lamb on a missionary tour, giving sermons at Guildford and Portsmouth. This apprenticeship served, he struck out on his own in a career of itinerant evangelism which caused acute anxiety to the authorities in several counties.<br>
<br>In Essex, the following spring, it was noted that Oates &#145;hath been sowing his Tares, Bookmong, and wild Oates in these parts these five weeks without any controll, hath seduced hundreds, and dipped many in Bocking River&#146;; he was &#145;a lusty young fellow&#146; who &#145;traded chiefly with young women and young maids, dipping many of them, though all is fish that comes to his net, and this he did with all boldnesse, and without all controul for a matter of two months&#146;  (Edwards, 2.147&#150;8). This lurid picture probably owed much to the imaginations of the presbyterian ministers who painted it. But at the Essex quarter sessions at Chelmsford, in March 1646, Oates was certainly charged with unlawful assembly at Braintree and Bocking, in breach of the peace and in contempt of authority. Imprisoned for a time in Colchester gaol, he was reported to have been visited by large numbers of friends from London, some in coaches. In April he was acquitted of having caused the death of a young woman by immersing her in a river. At Terling he debated with John Stalham, who also recalled a sermon by Oates &#145;at the corner of a corn field in our town&#146;  (Stalham, preface). On 29 June he disputed for several hours with Ralph Josselin, vicar of Earls Colne, and the following morning commenced three days of exercises at Chelmsford. Essex magistrates seem not to have succeeded in stopping his activities, but the following year Oates turned his attention elsewhere.<br>
<br>In March 1647 Oates appeared in Rutland, where the parish ministers urged the authorities to act against him. But here, as in Essex, it was impossible to mobilize the machinery of the law when the political and military will to punitive action was wanting. Oates continued to win a following, partly on the basis of agitation around the issue of tithes; lay preachers thought it proper to &#145;live of the gospel&#146;, and he seems to have achieved success in this by passing his own hat among the audiences. By early December 1647 nineteen parish ministers of Rutland were complaining to parliament that he continued touring &#145;from town to town preaching and rebaptising very many and drawing a concourse of people after him&#146;. To Oates, they attributed much doctrinal deviancy, including the belief that Christ had died for all men and that the soul died with the body. And his meetings became more openly political: it was reported that the preacher had &#145;lately been a great dispenser and promoter&#146; of &#145;that seditious paper Called the <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span>, bringing or sending it to diverse places through the country, which he hath by himself or his agents brought or sent to several towns in the countie&#146;  (Betteridge, 207&#150;9). One of these agents was probably Robert Everard, an agent of Cromwell's regiment, who had published the agreement in November and was soon after active among the Baptists of nearby Leicestershire.<br>
<br>This turbulence evidently provoked the central authorities to act: on 11 December the House of Lords ordered that Oates be arrested and brought before them, but on the 31st they found it necessary to issue a second order, admitting that he had escaped, and instructing the sheriffs of Lincolnshire, Rutland, Leicestershire, and Northamptonshire to return him to London, should they succeed in apprehending him. Neither this, nor a further order of 22 January 1648, had much practical consequence. Rearrested in Rutland, Oates was bound to appear before the judges of assize; he did not attend, but was acquitted anyway on a technicality. In May 1648 the Lords received further news. Oates remained active in Rutland, unrepentant and highly politicized, having uttered &#145;most sedicious and treasonable speeches against monarchy itself&#146;: in another outraged petition the county ministers pleaded for &#145;the dissolving of the schismatical and mutinous meetings of his deluded followers&#146;  (Betteridge, 210&#150;11). But Oates continued on his way. At Barrow-on-Soar, Leicestershire, he had a hostile encounter with George Fox; it was probably about this time that an excursion to Lincolnshire provoked the pamphlet against him by John Drew, rector of Barrowby. And at Oakham, Rutland, some time during the first half of 1649, Oates's wife, Lucy (<i>d</i>. in or after 1697), a midwife from Hastings, gave birth to a baby boy, to whom they gave the name Titus [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20437/', "Oates, Titus (1649&#150;1705)")</script>].<br>
<br>On 30 October 1649 Oates disputed in public with William Sheffield, rector of Ibstock, at Leicester Castle. Here the proponent of anti-paedobaptism was said to have been reduced to silence, but this victory (if such it was) was not enough for the magistrates. For his speeches Oates was the following day incarcerated in the castle's dungeon, together with his associate, Ralph London. Soon, however, he was freed, and by February 1650 was commissioned chaplain to Colonel Pride's regiment, possibly through the influence of another General Baptist, John Mason, who had been made lieutenant-colonel about August 1648; this was one of the regiments which invaded Scotland in July 1650 and pursued the Scottish forces to Worcester the following year.<br>
<br>Like other political radicals, Oates opposed the trend in General Baptist churches towards the receiving of members with the laying on of hands (though he was later accused of inconsistency), and some time in 1653, being in the county, he intervened at the request of a Lincolnshire church who opposed their pastor's adoption of it. About May 1653 Oates was in London, disputing with John Spittlehouse, an open-membership Calvinistic Baptist who also espoused this practice. Perhaps a little later, Cromwell received a letter concerning the dissolution of the Rump and the new assembly on behalf of the congregation at the Stone Chapel, St Paul's, led by Edmund Chillenden. This was signed by Oates and other men, chiefly military figures.<br>
<br>Oates was again chaplain of Pride's regiment when it returned to Scotland in April 1654; his service may have been continuous from 1650. On 2 December he wrote from Aberdeen to Corporal Parkinson of Whalley's regiment<blockquote>in great heaviness to think how we made the hearts of the righteous sade &hellip; by our not answering there expectations; for we have promised to make them a free people, and that they should have free and sucksessive parlements, but parforme neither</blockquote>and enclosed a summary of a letter already sent to sympathizers in several regiments, urging them to meet at the Green Dragon in Edinburgh on 1 January  (Nickolls, 132). Papers found on Oates indicate his deep disquiet with the powers vested in Cromwell as lord protector. Perhaps, he wondered, the new regime might be better than it appeared; he struggled to suppress his fears, in the hope that some authoritative representative of the new order would allay his anxieties. These musings did not amount to any well-worked plan, but on 16 January 1655, as Monck reported, Oates was arrested. He was expecting trouble, complaining bitterly against the &#145;cry that is unjustly on me&#146;. There was &#145;not word of sedition&#146; in the letter circularized to soldiers: &#145;we intended nothing but was consonant to the ground and end of our warres, and the honest declarations we have made, and concluded in fine to offer our service in this matter in an humble petition to the Protector&#146;  (MS Rawl. A.34, fols. 49&#150;50).<br>
<br>The context, however, was one in which several high army officers in Scotland were planning a coup involving the enforced installation of Robert Overton as commander. Overton seems not to have been a party to the conspiracy, and it is also possible that Oates was merely an auxiliary, to whom the military plans were not confided. Still, he was courtmartialled, cashiered, imprisoned, and shortly afterwards taken to London. Here he was granted a reprieve, and perhaps the satisfaction he had sought, for on 31 March, Monck reported that &#145;yesternight Oates was with his highness, who gave him only a sharp reproof for his folly, upon promise of his faithful deportment for the future&#146;  (Firth, <span class="italic">Clarke Papers</span>, 3.31).<br>
<br>Very little is known about Oates after the Restoration. The government suspected him of involvement in the Yorkshire plot in 1663, but this is unlikely. On 29 June 1667, following a brief stay at Merchant Taylors' School, Titus Oates was admitted to Caius College, Cambridge; the following year his father abandoned the Baptists and was instituted to the rectory of Hastings. In 1673 he resigned and returned to London, rejoining his old denomination. In 1682 he visited Henry Danvers and may have been on the fringes of groups that were plotting against the government. He died on 6 February 1683, leaving his widow and sons Titus, Samuel, and Constant.<br>
