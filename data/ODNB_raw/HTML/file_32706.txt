<span class="headword">Daniel,  (Charles) Henry Olive</span>  (1836&#150;1919), <span class="occ">printer and college head</span>, was born on 30 September 1836 at Wareham, Dorset, the eldest son of the Revd Alfred Daniel, curate of Wareham, and his wife, Eliza Anne, daughter of Clement Wilson Cruttwell. In 1838 his father became perpetual curate of Frome, Somerset. Henry, as he was later known, was interested in printing from the age of ten; his first &#145;book&#146;, printed &#145;by the use of types and thumb and inking&#146;, appeared about 1845. He was educated at Grosvenor College, Bath, King's College School, London, and Worcester College, Oxford, where he was elected scholar in 1854. After taking his degree in 1858, with a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i>, he returned to King's College as classical lecturer in 1859. In 1863 he was elected to a fellowship at Worcester College, where he spent the remainder of his life. In 1864 he was ordained deacon. He was dean in 1865, vice-provost in 1866, junior bursar in 1870, and proctor in 1873. On 21 August 1878 he married his cousin Emily Crabb Olive (1852&#150;1933), an artist, and third daughter of Edmund Crabb Olive; they had two daughters, Rachel (1880&#150;1937) and Ruth (1884&#150;1961). Compton Mackenzie, who was engaged to Ruth, painted a vibrant portrait of the Daniels in his novel <span class="italic">Guy and Pauline</span> (1915).<br>
<br>Daniel began printing at Oxford in 1874, seventeen years before William Morris founded the Kelmscott Press. He exerted considerable influence, largely because of his adoption of the Fell type which had lain unused at the Clarendon Press for 150 years (thirty-six years previously Caslon's old-faced type had been revived by William Pickering and Charles Wittingham &#145;the nephew&#146;, for the Chiswick Press). Fell type was first used by Daniel in <span class="italic">A New Sermon of the Newest Fashion</span> (1876), the second book which he printed at Oxford. He also used a black letter, of which the first example is <span class="italic">The Growth of Love</span> (1890) by his friend Robert Bridges. Daniel first used a toy press; from 1850 to 1882 he used a small Albion press, and from 1882 onwards a large Albion hand-press, which was first used to print <span class="italic">Hymni ecclesiae</span> in 1882.<br>
<br>One of the most interesting productions of the Daniel Press, and perhaps the best-known, was <span class="italic">The Garland of Rachel</span> (1881), a celebration in verse of the first birthday of his daughter Rachel with contributions by Andrew Lang, Austin Dobson, Robert Bridges, Lewis Carroll, and Edmund Gosse. Emily Daniel contributed capital letters and other designs to the Daniel Press, and this was the first book in which large ornaments and illuminations by her were used. Some of Daniel's books were reprints, including <span class="italic">Desiderii Erasmi colloquia duo</span> (1880); <span class="italic">Hymni ecclesiae</span> (1882); <span class="italic">Sixe Idillia</span> of Theocritus (1883), probably translated by Sir Edward Dyer from the unique copy in the Bodleian Library; <span class="italic">Love's Graduate</span>, an attempt by Edmund Gosse to separate Webster's work from that of William Rowley in <span class="italic">A Cure for a Cuckold</span> (1885); William Blake's <span class="italic">Songs</span> (1885) and <span class="italic">Songs of Innocence</span> (1893); Robert Herrick's <span class="italic">His Flowers</span> (1891) and <span class="italic">Christmas</span> (1891); <span class="italic">Odes, Sonnets, and Lyrics of John Keats</span> (1895); and Robert Jones's <span class="italic">The Muses' Garden for Delights</span> (1901). Other books contain the work of contemporaries and friends, particularly the plays and poems of Robert Bridges, later poet laureate, comprising fifteen pieces printed between 1883 and 1903, and <span class="italic">Our Memories</span> (1893), consisting of personal reminiscences of Oxford by a number of senior members of the university. Richard Watson Dixon, Henry Patmore, Margaret Woods, Herbert Warren, Walter Pater, Laurence Binyon, and others are represented by one or more volumes. The smaller Daniel books are delicate, the larger, such as the <span class="italic">Keats</span> and Bridges' <span class="italic">Shorter Poems</span>, in five parts, are fine and handsome. But typographically none of them rivals the best work from later famous presses. Daniel had admirable taste, but had no serious intention of reforming or improving English printing. He was an amateur who aimed at pleasing himself and his friends by printing as well as his means would allow, rather showing how beautifully a book could be made.<br>
<br>Daniel was connected to Worcester College, Oxford, as provost from 1903 (the first to be elected by the fellows), and he wrote the college's history with W. R. Barker in 1900. He was remembered by J. C. Masterman, a scholar at Worcester when Daniel was provost, and later provost himself, as a &#145;venerable figure, belonging to the past rather than to the present&#146;  (Masterman, 46). In later life he was &#145;magnificent&#146;, his golden beard almost completely white, his complexion &#145;bright and sanguine&#146;, his bearing upright, and with the overall appearance of a &#145;Viking chief&#146;  (ibid., 46&#150;7). He was much loved and admired at Worcester, where he was thought of as a generous bursar and a &#145;gentle and understanding&#146; provost  (ibid.). He was chiefly responsible for the decoration of the college's chapel and hall, carried out from the designs of William Burges; the former is, perhaps, the most important example in Oxford of Pre-Raphaelite influence (Daniel's portrait is incorporated into the fresco on the north wall of the chapel). Daniel also took an interest in municipal affairs, and held office as councillor and alderman. He died at Oddington, near Moreton in Marsh, Gloucestershire, on 6 September 1919, and was buried in Holywell cemetery, Oxford. In 1920 Daniel's large press was presented by his wife to the Bodleian Library, and <span class="italic">The Daniel Press</span> (1921) was the first book to be printed in the library.<br>
