<span class="headword">Holdingham <span class="st"> [Haldingham]</span>,  Richard  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1278?), <span class="occ">cartographic patron and supposed map maker</span>, probably also named as Richard de Bello, is known for certain only as the author or at least the patron of the large and very detailed late thirteenth-century world map which is now preserved at Hereford Cathedral (known as the <span class="italic">Mappa mundi</span>). This bears an inscription in its lower left corner requesting prayers for &#145;Richard de Haldingham o de Lafford&#146; (&#145;Richard of Haldingham or of Lafford&#146;) who &#145;made and drew this history&#146; (&#145;fet e compasse cest estorie&#146;). Holdingham is a hamlet in the parish of Lafford, Lincolnshire, and Richard is described as of either place in order to make his identity clear to people unacquainted with Holdingham. Lafford is a prebend of Lincoln Cathedral, and Richard has been assumed to be also identifiable as Richard de Bello (of Battle, almost certainly Battle in Sussex) who was prebendary of Lafford in 1277 and who was also treasurer of Lincoln Cathedral by October 1270, until at least April 1278. He is first found as a canon of Lincoln in 1265; he died on 4 November 1278.<br>
<br>The map gives some prominence to Lincoln and also names Lindsey (meaning either the later Lindsey or possibly the county of Lincoln), and the map's patron must have been just such a well-educated man with Lincolnshire connections as Richard de Bello, who was a master of arts. A link with the Augustinian priory of Kirkham, Yorkshire, is also suggested by the presence on the map of this relatively minor religious house. Although the map has very possibly been at Hereford since the later middle ages, and certainly since 1682, Hereford has an inconspicuous place on it, added at an early date in the abbreviated form &#145;H'ford&#146;. There is no reason to associate Hereford with the prebendary of Lafford, the map's putative patron. One Richard de Bello was canon of Hereford from 1305 until he died in 1326, as well as being canon of Salisbury from 1298, but clearly he cannot be identified with his namesake, the canon of Lincoln. That the Hereford canon gave the map to Hereford remains a mere hypothesis; his ecclesiastical career was linked rather with the diocese of Salisbury, while the city of Salisbury is not included on the map.<br>
<br>World maps were not uncommon room furnishings in royal palaces and ecclesiastical institutions in the middle ages; one is listed in the mid-twelfth-century catalogue of the library of Lincoln Cathedral. Their ultimate source is maps from Roman imperial times, but in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries they received such modifications as the placing of Jerusalem in the centre, as on the Hereford map. The Hereford map is datable on stylistic and palaeographic grounds to about the very late thirteenth century. It includes Conwy and Caernarfon, whose castles were only begun in 1283 and not finished until about 1292, and it has therefore been suggested that it was made over a period of years. It does not have this appearance, however, and it may simply be a copy that updates but generally reproduces one that was written about the 1270s by, or rather for, Richard of Holdingham; despite the words &#145;made and drew&#146; (&#145;fet e compasse&#146;), Richard of Holdingham is hardly likely to have actually written and drawn the map himself, since it has mistakes that show a lack of understanding of what was being copied.<br>
<br>The discrepancies of date between the life of Richard of Holdingham who was prebendary of Lincoln, and the map that is now at Hereford, are best explained by the hypothesis that Richard commissioned a world map in the 1270s, and that this was copied in every detail (down to the inscription that names him) but with some additions (such as Conwy and Caernarfon) in the late 1280s or 1290s, shortly before being brought to Hereford.<br>
<br>There remains also the faint possibility that Richard of Holdingham was not the same as the prebendary of Lincoln; it is perhaps significant that the inscription does not refer to him as a master (of arts).<br>
