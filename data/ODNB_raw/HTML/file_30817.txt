<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bing,  Geoffrey Henry Cecil</span>  (1909&#150;1977), <span class="occ">barrister and politician</span>, was born on 24 July 1909 at Craigavad near Belfast, the only son and elder child of Geoffrey Bing, headmaster of Rockport School and Orange lodge supporter, of Rockport, Craigavad, co. Down, and his wife, Irene Hare Duke. He was educated at Tonbridge School and Lincoln College, Oxford, where he obtained a second class in modern history in 1931. He was Jane Eliza Procter visiting fellow at Princeton University in 1932&#150;3. He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple (1934), at Gibraltar (1937), the Gold Coast (1950), and Nigeria (1954).<br>
<br>Bing's early experience in Ulster gave him a hatred of discrimination and a willingness to defend human rights wherever they were threatened. He became a sort of joyful revolutionary, hurled himself into every scene where his interests were engaged, and always emerged with a good story, however sombre his report. In the mid-1930s he helped to give early strength to the Haldane Society and the National Council for Civil Liberties, founded by Ronald Kidd in 1934. He entered several prisons in fascist countries in search of the &#145;disappeared&#146;, and joined the International Brigades in Spain as a journalist, barely escaping at Bilbao.<br>
<br>Bing was himself very much at home in these left-wing and radical surroundings, and some of his own foreign exploits were aimed at investigating or enlarging an embryo story. He became one of the first anti-Nazis of the 1930s. Nevertheless, when he was called up in the Royal Signals in 1941, Bing's left-wing reputation was still such that he had no prospect save the most menial in a large home establishment. A serious political battle had to be fought in his favour before he was given any chance of worthwhile employment. He then entered an officer cadet training unit, from which he passed out top.<br>
<br>In 1943 Bing did experimental work with parachutes in the GSO2 airborne forces development centre. One of the experiments undertaken disfigured his face for many years. In 1943 he was a signals officer in north Africa and in 1944 accompanied the British liberation forces in western Europe with the rank of major. He was wounded and mentioned in dispatches. In 1940 Bing married Christian Frances, the former wife of Edward Archibald Fraser Harding, and daughter of Sir Ralph Barrett Macnaghten Blois, ninth baronet, of Cockfield Hall, Yoxford, Suffolk; they had two sons. His wife for a time helped Claud Cockburn with his left-wing newspaper <span class="italic">The Week</span>.<br>
<br>In 1945 Bing was elected Labour MP for Hornchurch, a seat he held until 1955. He was at once appointed as an unpaid junior whip. It was generally thought that this was a mistake for another man of a similar name, who was as much to the right of the party, and so acceptable to Ernest Bevin, as Bing was to the left. The appointment lasted for nine months and then was ended without comment. Bing's first marriage was dissolved in 1955 and in 1956 he married Eileen Mary, daughter of Frederick Cullen, alderman and parliamentary agent for Hornchurch; they had one adopted son.<br>
<br>Bing returned to the back benches where he became &#145;the unrestrained leader of a small group of radicals, never fully trusted by their colleagues and known as &#147;Bing Boys&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 April 1977). A committed supporter of communist China, he was nicknamed the Mandarin. He also specialized in Northern Ireland, the brewers' monopoly, and parliamentary procedure. In the years after the war his was almost the sole voice calling for help for the Ulster minority. He became adept at the parliamentary devices whereby any issue can be raised, perhaps late at night, which no deputy speaker can reject. Indeed, when Labour was in opposition he was called on by colleagues to guide them through the intricacies of this procedure.<br>
<br>At the bar (he took silk in 1950) Bing built up a small practice in west Africa where he met Dr Kwame Nkrumah, leader of the main party in the Gold Coast. In 1955 the programme for independence was already arranged and Nkrumah urgently needed a legal and constitutional adviser. Bing, having lost his parliamentary seat, got the job in 1956. In 1957 he was appointed attorney-general in Ghana (previously the Gold Coast) and was thus involved in many of the territory's problems. The British government seemed obsessed with the idea that all colonial civil servants would withdraw; Bing had to dissuade them. He also had to order Emil Savundra out of the country for fraud at a time when his true character was not known.<br>
<br>As Nkrumah's right-hand and trusted adviser, Bing played a controversial role &#145;whether it was to increase press restrictions, a new presidential constitution, or removing the Chief Justice, the elaborate legalism of Bing's mind would find a way to do it.&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 April 1977). When a <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> journalist was arrested Bing announced, on behalf of the Ghanaian government, that he could have any counsel he chose; when Christopher Shawcross QC arrived, Bing, on the orders of Krobo Edusie, the minister of the interior, announced that he was excluded&#151;an act which made it impossible for Bing ever again to work at the English bar. It is arguable that he should have resigned as attorney-general rather than act on Edusie's order.<br>
<br>Bing ceased to be attorney-general in 1961, whereupon he became Nkrumah's adviser. Emancipation of the African colonies was new and the one-party African state was unforeseen. Bing and Nkrumah thought that a liberated colony must try to establish an independent economy, an effort which seemed to require one-party dictatorship whether benign or evil. When Nkrumah was ousted by a <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> in February 1966 Bing was arrested and ill-treated. He had done no wrong and after some months was sent home. He had been appointed CMG in 1960. His aptly named memoir of Nkrumah's Ghana, <span class="italic">Reap the Whirlwind</span>, appeared in 1968. Bing died in London on 24 April 1977.<br>
