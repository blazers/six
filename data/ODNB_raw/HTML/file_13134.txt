<span class="headword">Hester,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1592), <span class="occ">distiller and translator</span>, lived for several years in London but nothing is known of his parentage or place of birth. One Hester family, location unknown, bore arms (argent on a bend sable three swans of the field); another shield of arms (a chevron between three horses' heads erased, a crescent for difference) is appended to Hester's <span class="italic">Short Discours</span> (1580), but the significance of this is not apparent. A follower of Paracelsus, John Hester is noticed first through his book <span class="italic">The True and Perfect Order to Distill Oyles</span> (1575). George Baker, a London surgeon, commended four distillers, including Hester, who &#145;is a painful [painstaking] travailer in those matters&#146;  (Baker, preface). Hester carried on business under the sign of the Furnaces (1581) or the Stillatory (1591), at his house on Paul's Wharf, on the Thames waterfront, south of St Paul's Cathedral, in the parish of St Benet Paul's Wharf.<br>
<br>Hester advertised his preparations by distributing printed broadsheets of folio size: one example (it bears Gabriel Harvey's signature and the date 1588 in ink) lists his stock-in-trade, mostly under the items' Latin names. The heading states that &#145;These oils, waters, extractions, or essence[s,] salts and other compositions are &hellip; ready made to be sold by John Hester&#146;, who was willing to give instruction in his art, &#145;for a reasonable stipend&#146;. &#145;Oils&#146; included cinnamon, aniseed, gum ammoniac, and <i>Fraxini</i> (probably manna ash, <i>Fraxinus ornus</i>). &#145;Waters&#146; included frankincense, honey, and (spirits of) hartshorn. &#145;Salts&#146; included ginger, sage, and mugwort (<i>Artemisia vulgaris</i>). &#145;Extracts or essences&#146; were such as rhubarb, Alexandrian senna (<i>Cassia acutifolia</i>), and agaric (from the fungus <i>Fomes officinalis</i>). &#145;The compositions of divers authors&#146; included flowers of sulphur and oil of camphor. Many items could have appeared in an English <i>materia medica</i> of the 1880s but &#145;Certain compositions of Leonardi Phirovanti&#146; belong to this earlier period: <span class="italic">La petra philosophale nostra</span> (&#145;The philosophers' stone medicine&#146;), and <span class="italic">Elixer vitae</span> (&#145;Elixir of life&#146;). Although virtually all these wares were medicinal or culinary, there were rare exceptions, such as &#145;Divers compositions of most strange [and] terrible fireworks, made by the Sp[age]rical art&#146; (alchemy), and &#145;a certain kind of pitch for trimmin[g] ships&#146;.<br>
<br>In the period 1575 to 1591 Hester was producing medical books. He edited <span class="italic">A Joyfull Jewell</span> ([1579]) by L. Fiorovantie, and translated from the Italian by Thomas Hill, but mostly he translated books from Latin or Italian into English, including one on the &#145;French pox&#146; (syphilis), and another on gunshot and other wounds. He translated two of Paracelsus's works as <span class="italic">The Key of Philosophie</span> (1580) and <span class="italic">114 Experiments</span> (1583?). His <span class="italic">Short Discours &hellip; uppon Chirurgerie</span>, translated from the work by L. Fiorovantie, was dedicated to the earl of Oxford, and <span class="italic">Sclopotarie</span> (1590) to Essex.<br>
<br>Hester is unlikely to have been wealthy. His name is absent from lay subsidy assessments; in 1586 he was assessed for two-fifteenths at the modest sum of 8<i>d</i>., when the highest rate in St Benet Paul's Wharf was 3<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. The dates of his death and burial have not been ascertained but administration of his estate, as late of St Benet Paul's Wharf parish, was granted to his widow, Elizabeth, on 29 August 1592. However, Hester's high reputation survived him. Gabriel Harvey, in his <span class="italic">Pierces Supererogation</span> (1593), named six men who had been foremost in their professions: &#145;a mathematical mechanician&#146; (Humphrey Cole), a shipwright (Matthew Baker), an architect (John Shute), a &#145;navigator&#146; (Robert Norman), a gunner (William Bourne), and John Hester, a chemist  (Grosart, 2.289). In <span class="italic">The Pearle of Practise</span> (1595), James Fourestier acknowledged that his material had been &#145;Found out by I[ohn]. H[ester].&#146;, though &#145;Since his death it is garnished and brought into some method by a wellwisher of his&#146;  (title-page): it had even been &#145;wanting a name (which I have given unto it)&#146;  (ibid., dedication). As to the numerous compounds contained therein:<blockquote>The greater part of them were prepared by John Hester &hellip; a man that spent much, and endangered his body, about such works, whereof many excellent men have enjoyed the benefit. &hellip; All which as not long since I bought of the survivor. (ibid., epistle to the reader)</blockquote>
