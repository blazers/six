<span class="headword">Warford,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1560&#150;1608), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born at Bristol. Little is known of his parents save that his mother was called Jane. He was admitted a scholar of Trinity College, Oxford, on 13 June 1574, graduated BA on 12 March 1578, was elected a fellow of his college in 1578, and graduated MA on 30 March 1582. He was reconciled to the Roman Catholic church at the English College, Rheims, on 7 November 1582 and remained there until sent to the English College at Rome on 13 August 1583. He took with him a glowing recommendation from Dr Barret, the president of Douai. He was ordained priest in the college chapel in Rome on 16 December 1584 and he remained there in the household of Cardinal Allen until 1588. After a visit to Spain he was sent to England on the mission in April 1591 and worked in Kent. He entered the Society of Jesus in Rome on 23 May 1594 and was penitentiary at St Peter's for some time. During his time in Rome between 1594 and 1599 he wrote his relation about the English martyrs, later collected by Christopher Grene and deposited among his transcripts at Stonyhurst. He left Rome in late 1599 for Lisbon, where he was confessor to the English College. He was in Cadiz until 1608 when, owing to ill health, he returned to Valladolid, which he had visited in 1594. He was the author of <span class="italic">A Briefe Instruction by Way of Dialogue Concerninge the Principall Poyntes of Christian Religion, Gathered out of the Holy Scriptures, Fathers, and Councels</span>, published under the name George Doulye at Seville in 1600, and of <span class="italic">A Briefe Manner of Examination of Conscience for a Generall Confession</span>, published under the same pseudonym (Louvain, 1604). Both works saw a number of later editions. He died at the English College, Valladolid, on 6 November 1608, and was buried at Valladolid.<br>
