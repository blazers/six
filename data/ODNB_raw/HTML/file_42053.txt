<span class="headword">Caplin,  Roxey Ann</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Emily Roxey Caplin]</span>  (1793&#150;1888), <span class="occ">corset maker, writer, and lecturer on health</span>, was born in Canada, the daughter of English settlers; Canadian Indians taught her canoeing and swimming as a child. Probably trained as a milliner, she married about 1835, and by 1839 was living in London. Her husband, Jean Fran&ccedil;ois Isidore Caplin (<i>c</i>.1790&#150;<i>c</i>.1872), used his knowledge of anatomy, gained as a Paris medical student, to treat spinal deformities. He moved to London about 1830. In 1838 he patented (no. 7640) a front-opening corset with a back adjusted by pulleys and wheels. In 1839 Madame Caplin appeared in the London Post Office directory as a &#145;wholesale and retail milliner and patentee of the mechanical corset&#146; (her name was given as Emily Roxey, then Roxey Ann from 1849).<br>
<br>From 1841 the couple were listed at 58 Berners Street, London. Jean Fran&ccedil;ois Caplin, called an orthopaedic corset maker and later an &#145;orthorachidiste&#146;, registered designs for a mannequin in 1841 and the Hygean or Corporiform Corset in 1849. However, the Athen&eacute;e des Arts de Paris's commendation stated that it was invented and manufactured by his wife. In 1843 the <span class="italic">Court Magazine</span> commented:<blockquote>Madame Caplin has made the manufacture of Corsets a complete study, embracing at once the several designs of anatomy, geometry, drawing and mechanics &hellip; the artist may be traced in all, and her system of measurement is at once perfect and infallible. (R. A. Caplin, <span class="italic">Health and Beauty</span>, frontispiece)</blockquote>The Caplins' knowledge of anatomy, fashion, and commerce created a highly successful product.<br>
<br>In 1849 Jean Fran&ccedil;ois Caplin lectured in Manchester on spinal deformities, then in the early 1850s, while retaining their London base, husband and wife had premises in Princes Street, and the Manchester Hygiaenic Gymnasium [<i>sic</i>] was run from their Pendleton home. Invalid boarders were cured by exercise, diet, and good corsetry. Its prospectus reassured parents that &#145;Independently of the maternal care of Madame Caplin, a well educated governess of the highest respectability, residing in the establishment, will devote her whole attention to the requirements and comforts of the young ladies&#146;  (J. F. I. Caplin, &#145;Prospectus&#146;).<br>
<br>Madame Caplin's corsets and Monsieur's portable gymnasium were awarded medals at the 1851 Great Exhibition and examples of their corsets survive in the Museum of London. Royal patronage followed, according to James Torrington Spencer Lidstone's <span class="italic">Londoniad</span> (1856), which described Madame thus:<blockquote>
<div>You'll an incarnation of the Graces meet<br>
</div>
<div>At No. 58, in Berners-street;<br>
</div>
<div>A deity in human form enshrined;<br>
</div>
<div>Gracious demeanour, and a courtly mien,<br>
</div>
<div>Learning and worth are thine, great Nature's queen.<br>
</div> (Lidstone, 60)</blockquote>Jean Fran&ccedil;ois Caplin became a doctor of medicine in 1854, perhaps for his electrochemical bath which used the principle of electroplating to expel poisons from the body. In 1855 he opened the Hygeinic Gymnasium and Kinesitherapic Institution for Ladies and Children, at 9 York Place, Portman Square, London, which soon became the Hydro-Galvano Therapeutic Institution. His many books describe the bath, with testimonies to its effectiveness for an astonishing range of illnesses.<br>
<br>Madame Caplin now advertised extensive alterations to Berners Street, to show her &#145;numerous inventions for the purpose of preserving the health and displaying the natural beauties of the female form&#146;  (R. A. Caplin, <span class="italic">The Needle</span>, 60). She also lectured upstairs in her Ladies Anatomical Gallery where, &#145;in addition to Canova's Anatomical Venus and the Venus de Medici, hundreds of magnificent models, executed with the utmost fidelity to nature, exhibit every organ of the body and the whole course of embryology&#146;  (ibid.). This was &#145;quite distinct from the rest of the Establishment, and a visit to one does not necessarily involve a sight of the other&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Roxey Caplin wrote her first book in 1856. <span class="italic">Health and beauty, or, Corsets and clothing, constructed in accordance with the physiological laws of the human body</span> gave a history of stays, culminating in her own Hygeinic Corset, which had been &#145;pirated or attempted by almost every staymaker in London and Paris&#146;  (R. A. Caplin, <span class="italic">Health and Beauty</span>, 51). <span class="italic">The Needle: its History and Utility</span> (1860) concentrated on the history of the needle since Homer's day, and the clothing it created. She noted &#145;so far as ornament is concerned&hellip; no genuine and earnest effort has yet been made to adapt the dress to the body, in such a manner as shall preserve the health and display the natural beauties of the human figure&#146;. She decried the appalling conditions in the clothing trades, but hoped the sewing machine would improve &#145;the condition of those whose woes have been so beautifully and pathetically described by dear Tom Hood&#146;.<br>
<br>Roxey Caplin ran her business at Berners Street until her death. In 1876 she co-wrote <span class="italic">Women in the Reign of Queen Victoria</span>. This praised the recent increase in physical exercise and work opportunities for women, but called for dress reform. From the 1870s she lived in Mortlake with her bookkeeper and three servants. Although she claimed to be a widow of sixty-four in the 1881 census, when she died of old age and gangrene at Cambridge Lodge, Mortlake, East Sheen, Surrey, on 2 August 1888, her death certificate gave her age as ninety-five.<br>
