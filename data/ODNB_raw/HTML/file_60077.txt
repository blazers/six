<span class="headword">Collins,  Edward Treacher</span>  (1862&#150;1932), <span class="occ">ophthalmologist</span>, was born at 1 Albert Terrace, Regent's Park, London, on 28 May 1862, the second son of Dr William Job Collins (<i>b</i>. 1818), a London physician; his father was of an old Warwick family, one of whom, Francis Collins, wrote Shakespeare's will, and his mother, Mary Ann Francisca, was the daughter of Edouard Treacher, of Huguenot stock. He was educated in London at University College School and at the Middlesex Hospital, received his medical diploma at the age of twenty-one, and was a house surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital from 1884 to 1887. He was then appointed pathological curator of the museum, and librarian, and remained in that position until 1894; he became FRCS in 1890. He also held a large number of appointments at other London hospitals while building up a private practice. Thereafter he held the post of senior surgeon in Moorfields until his retirement.<br>
<br>It was during his tenure of the curatorship that Collins laid the foundations of his subsequent career. This was the period of reorganization of surgery and medicine on the basis of specialization in practice as it is known today. Collins improved and built up the specimen collection, and observations in clinical pathology and the scientific principles underlying them became his major interest. Of his many published papers, at least 150 refer to histology or pathology, indicative of his persistence in research in the subject, and of the immense energy and steady industry with which he worked. He was especially interested in the evolution of the eye and its congenital aberrations, one of which (mandibulo-facial dysostosis) was originally described by him and at first carried the name Treacher Collins syndrome, though it has since been renamed Franceschetti syndrome as its wider developmental significance has become known. Collins often attended and took part in scientific as well as clinical meetings, and it was said that very frequently his remarks in a discussion were of much greater value than the paper that gave rise to them.<br>
<br>In addition to a long list of publications on ocular pathology, Collins wrote a number of influential books. Most of these dealt with medical topics, though one, <span class="italic">In the Kingdom of the Shah</span> (1896), described his visit to Persia in 1894 to operate on the eldest son of the shah. This working holiday was also his honeymoon, as before his departure he married Hetty Emily (<i>b</i>. 1870/71), daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel J. L. Herrick of Hawkes Bay, New Zealand; they had a son and a daughter. An important later publication was Collins's <span class="italic">History and Traditions of the Moorfields Eye Hospital</span> (1929), covering the hundred years up to 1904. Biographical details given in this work of some senior members of the hospital staff, with their abilities described in the most generous terms, were suspected by others to have led to the reported excessive pride of subsequent Moorfields staff and alumni, and its perceived undesirable effects on ophthalmology in England.<br>
<br>This undeserved criticism only serves to emphasize the most striking and admirable of Collins's traits: despite his eminence, he was entirely free from any greed for wealth or honours. He was an excellent teacher and took great pains to help and advance his pupils and younger colleagues in any way possible. Obituary notices state that he was without any envious thought, always willing to do anything to help a colleague, and that he never had a mean thought. His modesty was such that, when required to retire from his hospital appointment in his sixtieth year, he completed his day's clinical work and left without a word, even ahead of the due date, rather than face the fuss of a more formal farewell. His lack of ambition contrasts with his elder brother, William Job, who also became an ophthalmic surgeon; in addition William served as chairman of the London county council and as vice-chancellor of the University of London, and he was for some years a Liberal MP (for St Pancras and for Derby) and was knighted.<br>
<br>In addition to many other honours Collins was awarded the Nettleship medal (1915) and was Bowman lecturer (1921) of the Ophthalmological Society of the UK (OSUK), of which he held all the offices in turn. After his death the triennial Treacher Collins prize was established in his memory. Collins served on many national and local ophthalmic teaching and registration bodies, and was active in helping to found the precursor of the Faculty of Ophthalmologists, later to become the Royal College of Ophthalmologists. He spent much time in administrative work, and was intimately involved in the organization of Moorfields Eye Hospital, including its removal to the City Road site.<br>
<br>During his retirement from hospital work (from 1922 onwards) Collins played an active part in re-establishing the international congresses of ophthalmology which had been interrupted by the First World War. In recognition of his efforts he was made honorary president of the International Council of Ophthalmology, which succeeded in organizing the Thirteenth International Congress in 1929. Collins died at 16 Fitzroy Square, London, on 13 December 1932, and was buried on 17 December. After his death a memorial fund, built up by voluntary donations, was established with the aim of rebuilding the pathology department at Moorfields, to be named the Treacher Collins Pathological Institute. Despite sponsorship by the OSUK, the fund never reached the required level, and the proceeds were eventually devoted to the promotion of original work by younger members of the society.<br>
