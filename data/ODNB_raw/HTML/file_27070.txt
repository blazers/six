<span class="headword">Taylor,  Peter Alfred</span> <span class="st"> [PAT]</span>  (1819&#150;1891), <span class="occ">politician and radical</span>, was born in London on 30 July 1819, the eldest of the five children of Peter Alfred Taylor (1790&#150;1850), silk merchant, and his wife and first cousin, Catherine (<i>b</i>. 1795, <i>d</i>. in or after 1875), daughter of George Courtauld of Braintree, Essex. His uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46847/', "Samuel Courtauld")</script> instigated the celebrated Braintree case against church rates. He was educated at the school in West Hove, Sussex, run by the Revd J. P. Malleson, his cousin and the Unitarian minister at Brighton. It was through this connection that he met Clementia Doughty, who became governess to the Taylor family [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45468/', "Taylor, Clementia (1810&#150;1908)")</script>]. They married on 27 September 1842 and jointly undertook many activities in support of radical causes.<br>
<br>Taylor entered the family firm of Samuel Courtauld &amp; Co. in the late 1830s. He later became a partner, and it was the wealth from this family connection that enabled him to develop his radical interests and to support them financially. He grew up in the Unitarian circle centred on South Place Chapel, Finsbury, of which his father was a leading member. His father helped to bring PAT, as he was widely known, into a leading position in the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42282', "Anti-Corn Law League")</script>, where he met the leading radicals of the day.<br>
<br>In 1845 the Taylors met Giuseppi Mazzini, the Italian patriot, who made an indelible impression on them, and they became his close friends and supporters. A secret hiding place was prepared for Mazzini in the Taylors' home, in case his life should be threatened. In the late 1840s Taylor helped to found the Society of Friends of Italy, and as its first treasurer was its primary fund-raiser. The Taylors kept open house for leading radicals from Britain, Europe, and America, first, from the early 1850s, in Powis Place, Great Ormond Street, London, and then from 1861 at Aubrey House, Notting Hill Gate.<br>
<br>Taylor advocated a democracy in Britain, and was an early member of the Northern Reform Union, founded in 1858 to promote manhood suffrage. After unsuccessful candidatures at Newcastle upon Tyne (1858) and Leicester (1861), he was elected unopposed as an advanced Liberal MP for Leicester in February 1862. At his election, when his programme included abolition of church rates and separation of church and state, he was attacked as &#145;anti-everything&#146;. He was a member of the Emancipation Society, founded in 1862 to promote the cause of the northern states in the American Civil War, he supported Polish independence (1863), and he was a member of the Garibaldi committee, set up in 1864 to welcome the Italian patriot to Britain. He was a vice-president and one of the few middle-class supporters of the Reform League, constituted early in 1865 to campaign for manhood suffrage and the ballot, and appeared on league platforms during the parliamentary reform crisis of 1866&#150;7. He attempted to achieve unity with the National Reform Union, which sought the more limited aim of household suffrage. With J. S. Mill he was a parliamentary spokesman for the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42293', "Jamaica committee")</script>, formed in response to Governor Eyre's brutal suppression of riots in Jamaica in 1865.<br>
<br>After 1868 Taylor championed all the leading radical causes: women's suffrage, opposition to the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span>, payments for MPs, disestablishment of the church, land tenure reform, abolition of the game laws, the abolition of flogging in the army and navy, opening of museums on Sundays, opposition to compulsory vaccination, and press freedom. Critics saw his many causes as &#145;the very embodiment of faddism&#146;  (<span class="italic">Leicester Daily Post</span>). He attracted notoriety in 1871 by his identification with the republican cause; he supported Charles Dilke's motion opposing the dowry and annuity to Princess Louise. He was proprietor of the radical newspaper <span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, edited by William Minto, from 1873 to 1878.<br>
<br>In 1873 ill health forced Taylor to retire from London to Brighton, where he founded clubs for working men, notably the Nineteenth Century Club, a forum for advanced radical and secularist views. He stood down from parliament in June 1884. During his twenty-two years as MP for Leicester he had &#145;refused, though a wealthy and generous man, to subscribe to a single public object in Leicester, that it might be perfectly clear he was not buying his seat in the Commons&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 21 Dec 1891). In retirement he cut himself off from other radicals in 1886 by refusing to support Irish home rule. In 1875 he published an opulently bound history of the Taylor family. Taylor died at his home, 18 Eaton Place, Brighton, on 20 December 1891 and was buried at the extramural cemetery in Brighton on the 23rd. Clementia Taylor, his widow, survived him; there were no children. His funeral service was conducted by Dr Stanton Coit of South Place, thus maintaining a long family connection with that Unitarian congregation.<br>
