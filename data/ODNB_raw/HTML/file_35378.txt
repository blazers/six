<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pares, Sir  Bernard</span>  (1867&#150;1949), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born at Albury, Surrey, on 1 March 1867, the third son and seventh child of John Pares (1833&#150;1915), of independent means, and Katharine (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Back). From Harrow School&#151;to which he remained devoted throughout his life (along with cricket)&#151;Pares took a foundation scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge (1885), where he read classics, which never held his interest: as a consequence he was placed in the second class of part one of the tripos (1887) and in the third class of part two in 1889. After graduating he spent some years as a schoolmaster. His first visit to Russia was undertaken in 1898, after studying on his private income in France, Italy, and Germany, apparently in rapt pursuit of Napoleon's fields of battle. Finally his interest was sparked by the exotic that Russia represented in contrast to Britain; the challenge presented itself of reconciling two societies that had, for the better part of the previous century, found themselves in contention.<br>
<br>After marriage on 27 August 1901 to Margaret Ellis, daughter of Edward Austin Dixon, dental surgeon, of Colchester, Pares became a university extension lecturer at Cambridge. In 1906 he moved to firmer ground as reader in Russian history at Liverpool. Always very young for his age, at Liverpool he made his mark with his youthful exuberance, including composition of the university song book; he also unselfishly held open house, now graced with a growing family, to the undergraduates. It was typical of his impish humour that the first initials of his children spelt the family name: Peter (who became a diplomatist), Andrew (the army), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37834/', "Richard Pares")</script> (a historian), and two daughters: Elizabeth and Susan.<br>
<br>The year 1906 also saw the formation of the first Russian parliament&#151;the Duma&#151;albeit on a highly restricted franchise. Pares visited St Petersburg, rapidly befriended the more liberal representatives, wrote about it all for the British press, and came away utterly convinced that the constitutional experiment would succeed. This resulted in his first work, <span class="italic">Russia and Reform</span>, published in 1907, and in active work as secretary for the Anglo-Russian Committee in London, which arranged parliamentary exchanges between the two capitals. The strength of the book derived from his personal contacts; the weakness, here as elsewhere in his historiography, was the almost complete neglect of the economic and social undercurrents ultimately determining events. But Russian studies was still in its infancy and Pares its most dynamic pioneer. He was promoted to a chair in Russian history, language, and literature in the following year, a post he formally held until 1917. He also edited the <span class="italic">Russian Review</span> from 1912 to 1914. Meanwhile he spent as much time as practicable in Russia, and when war broke out in 1914 he was a natural choice as official observer to the Russian army. This too resulted in a publication&#151;<span class="italic">Day by Day with the Russian Army</span> (1915)&#151;and decorations: the Russian red cross, the soldier's cross, and the medal of St George, of which he was indubitably proud.<br>
<br>Early in 1917, as the old regime tottered into collapse, Pares was seconded to the staff of Sir George Buchanan, British ambassador in Petrograd. On Pares's view, as later published, &#145;the dynasty fell by its own insufficiency&#146;  (B. Pares, <span class="italic">History of Russia</span>, 1926, 471). He &#145;knew all the Ministers&#146; of the provisional government. Exciting possibilities thus opened up for realizing the dreams of 1906. However, as he later confessed: &#145;It was the most absurd time, for a country inexperienced in liberty, to make its first attempt at democratic government while the world war was still in progress, that is, while the world was ruled by force&#146;  (B. Pares, <span class="italic">The New Russia</span>, 1931, 38&#150;9). The seizure of power by the Bolsheviks and their dismissal of the constitutional assembly early in 1918 (after they lost the elections to that body) spelt disaster for Pares's dreams for the triumph of liberalism in Russia. At the request of the diplomatist Robert Hodgson, Pares went to Siberia, which was dominated by the less-than-liberal Admiral Kolchak, whom the British were backing blindly in a fruitless war against the Bolsheviks. Here Pares entertained the counter-revolutionary forces to lectures twice a week on the duty of Russia to others and the duty of others to Russia. As Hodgson recalled, even though the former was less popular than the latter, Pares none the less held his audience.<br>
<br>Russia, though a cruel disappointment, was, however, too much a part of Pares to be forsaken. In 1919 he was appointed KBE for his service, and from then until 1936 he held the key chair in Russian language, literature, and history at London University. His boundless energies and enthusiasm for things Russian saw him become editor of the <span class="italic">Slavonic Review</span> and simultaneously director of the fledgeling School of Slavonic and East European Studies at King's College, London, a position which he held until his retirement in 1939. Such distractions, not yet relieved by the emergence of the omnicompetent Dorothy Galton as his indispensable assistant, and the trauma of the changes in Russia inevitably slowed publication. But the stream of thought and work was blocked only briefly: in 1924 he issued an English translation of <span class="italic">Letters of the Tsaritsa to the Tsar</span>, followed in 1925 by a translation of Griboedov's <span class="italic">Gore ot uma</span> (&#145;The misfortune of being clever&#146;), and in 1926 by a delightful rendition into English of Krylov's political <span class="italic">Fables</span>. Although <span class="italic">The Fall of the Russian Monarchy</span> (1939) was well regarded, his most significant work was the popular <span class="italic">History of Russia</span> (1926). For all its neglect of diplomacy and economic change, it ran through several editions, and changes from one to the other edition illustrated Pares's shifting state of mind about the country, which for long he was prohibited from visiting, at least until 1935. Having abandoned the expectation that the regime would soon collapse, he resembled many Russians in exile and not a few British liberals in hoping very much that Stalin represented a return to old Russia in its symbolic reacquisition of the title Motherland in 1934, and in its new focus on industrialization&#151;though he was consistently firm in condemning the use of terror by the Bolsheviks. As with others of the left and centre, his concern at the rise of Hitler's Germany helped to divert criticism from the Soviet Union while Litvinov was charting the &#145;indivisibility of peace&#146; at the League of Nations in Geneva.<br>
<br>The revised edition of Pares's <span class="italic">History of Russia</span> (1937) thus na&iuml;vely saw something positive in the new constitution and in the execution of Zinoviev and Kamenev as spelling an end to advocates of world revolution. The edition of 1944 (which found him lecturing in the United States on behalf of the Ministry of Information) now acknowledged the Webbs' &#145;fundamental misapprehensions&#146; in lauding the Stalinist regime as a new civilization, but it also evinced signs of Pares's irrepressible Romanticism&#151;for example, in his passing comment: &#145;to know and love the people of Russia&#151;the two go together almost automatically for an Anglo-Saxon&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of Russia</span>, 4th edn, 1944, 11). The hopes that accompanied these sentiments reawakened by the common struggle against fascism had by no means been extinguished three years later, as the world drifted into the cold war.<br>
<br>The title of Pares's final and autobiographical work, entitled <span class="italic">A Wandering Student</span> (1948), inadvertently captures two significant features evident throughout his long life: a rootlessness and a youthful spirit which both, perhaps, explained an unhappy emotional life but which also account for the bursts of creativity from which many greatly benefited. Pares died of pneumonia at the Midtown Hospital on East 49th Street in New York on 17 April 1949, having lived in the United States for the previous seven years. His wife survived him.<br>
