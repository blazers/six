<span class="headword">Sedulius</span> <span class="st"> [Sedulius senior]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>7th&#150;8th cent.), <span class="occ">religious writer</span>, was probably an Irish exegete who wrote a commentary on Matthew's gospel, of which only a fragment survives. It has been postulated that he existed as a separate individual, earlier than&#151;and distinct from&#151;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50134/', "Sedulius Scottus")</script>, who flourished on the continent <i>c</i>.850 and also wrote a commentary on Matthew. This earlier Sedulius is known only from a brief citation from his <span class="italic">Tractatus Mathei</span>, concerning the fig tree cursed by Jesus. He identified the fig as the tree from which Adam and Eve had eaten the forbidden fruit. There is no proof that this earlier Sedulius was an Irishman, but that is likely: the same identification of the fig tree as that from which Adam ate occurs in other insular texts, and the extant fragment is quoted in a <span class="roman">Genesis</span> commentary, which itself is of probable Irish authorship. In addition, Sedulius appears to have been a popular name among the Irish at this period: the annals of the four masters (a seventeenth-century compilation from earlier sources) give the obits of six Irish churchmen named Siadhal&#151;presumably a Hibernicized form of the Latin Sedulius&#151;between 752 and 855.<br>
<br>There are two reasons for regarding Sedulius &#145;senior&#146; as being distinct from the better-known Sedulius Scottus. First, his commentary on <span class="roman">Matthew</span> is quoted by a <span class="roman">Genesis</span> commentary which itself has been handed down in a manuscript copied on the continent around the turn of the eighth and ninth centuries. Even if the manuscript is dated as late as possible, it would still be exceedingly unlikely that the fragment's author is identifiable with Sedulius Scottus, who was active in Francia <i>c</i>.850. This chronological point led Bernhard Bischoff to dub the <span class="roman">Matthew</span> commentator &#145;Sedulius senior&#146;, though care must be taken to distinguish him not only from Sedulius Scottus of the mid-ninth century, but also from the fifth-century continental Sedulius who composed a versified account of Christ's life. A second reason for regarding Sedulius &#145;senior&#146; as distinct from Sedulius Scottus is that the latter does not identify the forbidden tree from which Adam and Eve ate as a fig tree in his commentary on <span class="roman">Matthew</span>. The citation in the <span class="roman">Genesis</span> commentary must therefore be from a different work, probably by a different author.<br>
<br>The case for two separate Sedulii is not absolutely watertight. However, the notion that there could have been a single, long-lived individual who composed two commentaries on <span class="roman">Matthew</span>, one in Ireland and one on the continent, is highly implausible. Given the evidence for the popularity of the name among the Irish, combined with that for a significant quantity of biblical commentaries being composed by Irishmen at the time, the suggestion that there were two separate individuals is probably right. The floruit of Sedulius &#145;senior&#146; probably fell in the seventh or eighth century, the heyday of Irish biblical exegesis: the manuscript of the <span class="roman">Genesis</span> commentary provides a definite <i>terminus ad quem</i>. There is no evidence that he was ever a <i>peregrinus</i> (&#145;pilgrim&#146;) to the continent.<br>
<br>An Irish Sedulius who was a bishop somewhere in Britain took part in a synod held at Rome under Pope Gregory II in 721. But there is no more reason to identify the author of the <span class="roman">Matthew</span> commentary with him than with any of the other Sedulii named in the annals of the four masters.<br>
