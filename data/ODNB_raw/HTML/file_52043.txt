<span class="headword">Simpson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Way; <em>other married name </em>Leach]</span>, Dame  Florence Edith Victoria</span>  (1874&#150;1956), <span class="occ">controller of Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps</span>, was born on 9 October 1874, possibly in London, the daughter of Colonel Wilfred Fitzalan Way. Virtually nothing is known about her early years except that her first husband was Captain Henry Edmond Burleigh Leach; they were later divorced. In her role as a military wife she felt compelled to assist the war effort and in 1915 became a prominent member of the Women's Legion. At this time senior military personnel were experiencing a severe shortage of cooks. The inability to ensure that British troops were adequately nourished presented a potential problem for Britain's fighting performance in battle. Lady Londonderry, as president of the Women's Legion, stepped into the breach and offered to provide additional cooks for military service. The first party of Women's Legion military cooks arrived at a convalescent base on 3 August 1915. As a member of this initial party Florence Leach readily accepted responsibility for the staffing of army cookhouses. Such was her organizational ability that she became commandant of the cookery section of the Women's Legion between 1915 and 1917. Furthermore, on the formation of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps in 1917 she became controller of inspection for this organization and in 1918 was promoted to controller-in-chief. By this time the corps had received royal patronage and was given the new title of Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps. The corps contained approximately 57,000 women.<br>
<br>In recognition of her services Florence was appointed CBE in 1918 and DBE in the new year honours list of 1919. In the aftermath of the First World War senior members of Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps lobbied War Office officials in an attempt to establish a permanent women's service within the British armed forces in peacetime. However, the war cabinet adhered to the &#145;ten year rule&#146;. This maintained that a future conflict was unlikely to occur for at least a decade, the women's services (with the exception of the military nursing services) consequently being disbanded.<br>
<br>On her retirement from military service in 1920 Florence assisted in the formation of the Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps Old Comrades Association. On 12 January 1922 she married a widower, Edward Percy Simpson (1865&#150;1925), company director, the son of James Simpson, a civil engineer. Florence, as president of the Old Comrades Association, continued her work with the Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps. Following the Second World War this organization of old comrades was renamed the Women's Royal Army Corps Association.<br>
<br>By this stage the War Office had decided to retain a permanent women's service, primarily because of a severe shortage of manpower within the armed forces overall. Florence continued to demonstrate an interest in the lives and welfare of servicewomen, particularly those with whom she had served during the First World War. Described by her good friend Dame Helen Gwynne-Vaughan (the first director of the WRAF) as beautiful, elegant, and charming, Florence was also renowned for her organizational qualities and independence of spirit. In later life she lived with her stepdaughters on Moyeni Farm, Orange Free State, South Africa. On becoming ill, however, Florence decided to spend her final months at Arlesheim, Switzerland, in a private clinic, the Klinisch-Therapeutisches Institut. She died there on 5 September 1956.<br>
<br>As one of the first military dame commanders Florence Simpson nurtured the spirit of comradeship among those women who had served their country. More significantly, her involvement with the Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps provided a concrete foundation for the countless future generations of women who chose to follow her path.<br>
