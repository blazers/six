<span class="headword">Williams,  (Charles Hanson) Greville</span>  (1829&#150;1910), <span class="occ">industrial chemist</span>, was born on 22 September 1829 at Cheltenham, the only son of S. Hanson Williams, solicitor, and his wife, Sophia, daughter of Thomas Billings, also a solicitor. Greville Williams (as he was generally known) was educated privately and displayed an early interest in chemistry which seems to have displeased his father; on one occasion he spent his pocket money on a &#145;chemical chest&#146;, only to have it swept to destruction by his father's cane. Nevertheless, his first employment was as a consulting and analytical chemist in Cannon Street, London. He then spent three years as assistant to Professor Thomas Anderson at Glasgow University before moving to Edinburgh University to work under Lyon Playfair; he was then appointed to lecture on chemistry at the Normal College, Swansea. On 25 November 1852 he married Henrietta (<i>d</i>. 1904), daughter of Henry Bosher of Taunton. They raised four sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Williams returned to Glasgow to work for George Miller &amp; Co., manufacturing chemists, and developed his earlier work on quinolines, producing the first dye from this group: quinoline blue, or cyanin. This yielded a very attractive blue when dyed on silk, but it was unfortunately fugitive to light. Its sensitivity, however, made it of great value in the development of photography. It was at this time that Williams also discovered the unsaturated hydrocarbon isoprene, which some years later was recognized as a component of natural rubber.<br>
<br>In 1868 Williams moved south to be an assistant in the factory of Perkin &amp; Son at Greenford Green, Middlesex. The same year he left to join a partnership with John Dower and Eduard Thomas in the new Star Chemical Works at Brentford, Middlesex, which manufactured colours derived from coal tar. The uneconomic manufacture of magenta dye proved their financial undoing and the partnership went into liquidation in 1877. Greville Williams decided to retire from dyemaking; his eldest sons, Rupert Greville Williams and Lewis Greville Williams, set up Williams Bros. &amp; Co. in a new factory at Hounslow, largely producing those dyes which their father's company had manufactured. A third son, Francis, joined them in 1884, and the business was still in family hands when it celebrated its centenary.<br>
<br>During his time at the Star works Williams had followed his parallel interest in mineral chemistry, and in 1873 and 1877 he communicated two papers to the Royal Society. The earlier paper described his analyses of clear and coloured forms of beryl, and his conclusion that the green form (emerald) owed its colour to chromic acid. He included accounts of the fusion of beryl, quartz, and sapphire by the oxyhydrogen blowlamp, and reported that the brilliant flame of the blowlamp had damaged his sight even though he had worn dark glasses. In the second paper he proposed an improvement on the earlier processes which chemists had employed for such mineral analyses. In later years he continued to work on the chemistry of natural and artificial gems.<br>
<br>In 1877 Williams joined the Gas, Light, and Coke Company, London, as photometric supervisor, and he pursued his studies on the volatile bases derived from various hydrocarbons. He was admitted a member of the Chemical Society and elected FRS in 1862. In 1888 he was a founder member of the Society of Dyers and Colourists. He contributed to technical journals, handbooks, and dictionaries. Until disabled by rheumatism he was an expert draughtsman and calligraphist, an excellent game shot, and an enthusiastic angler. An obituarist described him as &#145;one of the most charming and versatile conversationalists it has been my good fortune to know&#146;  (<span class="italic">Athenaeum</span>, 767). In later life he became interested in the ancient Egyptian language. On retirement in 1901 he moved into the modest Bay Cottage, Smallfields, near Horley, Surrey, where he became something of a recluse, corresponding with, but seldom seeing, his former friends and colleagues. His wife died in 1904; he died on 15 June 1910 at Bay Cottage, and was buried at Streatham.<br>
