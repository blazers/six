<span class="headword">Adshead,  Stanley Davenport</span>  (1868&#150;1946), <span class="occ">architect and town planner</span>, was born at Bowden Vale, Bowden, Cheshire, on 8 March 1868. He was the second of eight children and eldest son of Joseph Adshead, an artist, and his wife, Eliza Davies. He was educated at Buxton, and on leaving school at sixteen was articled to the architect J. Medland Taylor in Manchester. Adshead described him as &#145;a relic of the Dickens era&#146;  (Powers, 106). He moved on to the office of Salomon and Eli in Manchester and later described the revelatory effect of his first visit to London during these years, when Bloomsbury appeared as &#145;something strange, fresh and pacifying&#146; in contrast to Manchester  (ibid., 109). He was determined to move, and in 1890 got a job with George Sherrin, where he learned from other assistants, notably H. V. Lanchester and E. A. Rickards. He followed Rickards into the office of Dunn and Watson and thence to Howard Ince, who was building a studio house in Maida Vale for the sculptor Alfred Gilbert. Several more moves ensued, with Adshead rising up an artistic scale to finish in the office of William Flockhart, which involved him in a four-year spell as clerk of works at Rosehaugh, Argyll, a vast eclectic mansion on the Black Isle. There he met his future wife, Mary Annie (1874&#150;1960), daughter of Andrew Blackie of Strathpeffer. They were married on 24 October 1900.<br>
<br>On his return to London in 1898 Adshead found a new occupation as a freelance perspective artist, drawing the schemes of other architects for competition and exhibition. His style for this work was atmospheric in a limpid way, avoiding the tricks then common in this important art of architectural persuasion. In 1900 he made the perspectives for five out of six of the entries in the competition for the new central criminal courts. In 1904 he finally won a competition in his own name for a library and technical school at Ramsgate, from which followed a pavilion in the same town, in which Adshead began to explore the late eighteenth-century revival style with which his architecture is largely associated. His practice failed to thrive, however, and he was happy to be offered the newly created chair of civic design at the University of Liverpool in 1909. This proposal came from the professor of architecture, C. H. Reilly, one of Adshead's associates in London at the turn of the century, who wanted to add town planning in a grand artistic style to the existing architectural curriculum. Adshead thus acquired a new career as a result of Reilly's insight and the sponsorship of William Hesketh Lever (later the first Lord Leverhulme), although there was a secondary motive in the hope that he would teach Liverpool students to make fine presentation drawings. Adshead and Reilly shared a mission to purify Edwardian classicism, which implied a greater sympathy with neo-classicism, including its grand urban schemes and attacks on late projects by Norman Shaw, who described them as &#145;tin-pot professors&#146;. Adshead was secretary of an evanescent &#145;Classical Society&#146; around 1907.<br>
<br>Adshead's subject became newly fashionable in the wake of the first <span class="roman">Town Planning Act</span> in 1909, and he was the first editor of the <span class="italic">Town Planning Review</span>, which promoted formal design in place of garden city vernacular. He broadened Reilly's propagandist thrust with sensitivity to places and their evolution, awakened in him by one of his colleagues, Ramsay Muir. Reilly's student and successor (in both his university chairs), Sir Patrick Abercrombie, believed that Adshead's synthesized and balanced approach, which combined the monumental, statistical, and legalistic aspects of the years before 1914, was the foundation on which the planning profession in Britain was based: &#145;He might appear contradictory or confusing in his verbal approach, but the final verdict showed an unerring logical and artistic sense&#146;  (quoted in Powers, 122). In 1914 Adshead left his half-time position in Liverpool for a new chair in civic design at University College, London, where he remained until retirement in 1935, becoming a colleague of Professor A. E. Richardson, whose architectural office was for a time housed below Adshead's London office and residence at 46 Great Russell Street.<br>
<br>Adshead's practice, in partnership with Stanley Ramsey (the author of the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> entry on Adshead), was commissioned in 1911 to design extensive new buildings to replace existing slums on the duchy of Cornwall estate, Kennington, London, in an initiative by Sir Walter Peacock, secretary to the prince's council. As Ramsey characterized their work:<blockquote>From the outset, Adshead insisted that it was to be a Royal Estate and he it was who laid down the broad principles of development. There remained, and do remain to this day, many fine examples of late eighteenth century and Regency buildings in the neighbourhood, and we decided that the architectural expression for the new buildings should be a modern transcript of these styles. (S. Ramsey, &#145;Our work together&#146;, MS, family papers)</blockquote>The main development consisted of terraces of two-storey houses in yellow London stock brick, some of which formed Courtenay Square, and a quadrangle of old people's dwellings. Additional sections, increasingly in flats, were inserted in the existing streetscapes until the end of the 1920s, and a new church of St Anselm was planned in 1914 and completed in modified form in 1933. It cannot be claimed that the Kennington work was influential as an alternative to the tenement type dwellings which constituted the majority model for slum clearance projects between the wars, but it was widely admired.<br>
<br>In 1917 Adshead was commissioned to build a workers' settlement for Dorman Long steel works at Redcar, called Dormanstown. Conventional in external appearance, the paired Georgian houses were in fact based on a steel frame, and a formal layout was proposed. Adshead and Ramsey also designed a number of smaller housing projects under the <span class="roman">Housing Act</span> of 1919, in Totnes, Brighton, and elsewhere. In the 1920s he continued to produce a small number of buildings similar in approach to the Kennington estate; the only exception, at the end of his career, was Scurr House, Stepney, in 1932, a tenement block with emphatic horizontal balconies which are modernist in style.<br>
<br>During the 1920s Adshead produced a number of published planning surveys of different parts of England, including south Tees-side, the Thames valley, west Essex, Scarborough, Teignmouth, and York, which were distinguished by his line drawings of landscape and towns. In 1930 he visited Northern Rhodesia to select and plan a site for the capital, Lusaka. Adshead's book <span class="italic">Town Planning and Town Development</span> (1923) was his major statement of the subject, and covered issues of regional planning, street layout, and the impact of the motor car and mobile leisure, illustrated with photographs of good and bad practice. In 1941 his book <span class="italic">A New England: Planning for the Future</span> proposed a nationwide rationalization of land use and transport; it was followed by <span class="italic">New Towns for Old</span> (1943).<br>
<br>Adshead and his wife had one child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60100/', "(Sylvia) Mary Adshead (1904&#150;1995)")</script>. She studied painting at the Slade School of Art and became well known as a mural painter with a strong, slightly na&iuml;ve style who executed a number of commissions for her father's buildings, and those of his contemporaries and pupils. Adshead, who was very tall, was described as &#145;rather of the dreamy and slow-moving type&#146;  (W. A. Downe, &#145;Some memories&#146;, <span class="italic">Sir Albert Richardson, 1880&#150;1964</span>, ed. A. Powers, S. Houfe, and J. Wilton-Ely, 1999). C. H. Reilly recognized Adshead's qualities when he wrote, &#145;The classical backbone of his thought has never prevented his appreciating the romantic interest of accidental things&#146;  (Reilly, 26). Adshead died at Chapel Cottage, Lower Ashley, New Milton, Hampshire, on 11 April 1946 of stomach cancer. His wife survived him.<br>
