<span class="headword">Ward,  Bernard Nicholas</span>  (1857&#150;1920), <span class="occ">headmaster and historian</span>, was born on 4 February 1857, the youngest of three sons and seventh of eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28713/', "William George Ward (1812&#150;1882)")</script> and his wife, Frances Mary (<i>d</i>. 1898), daughter of John Wingfield, prebendary of Worcester. The Ward family lived in a house, designed by Augustus Welby Pugin, at St Edmund's College, Old Hall Green, near Ware in Hertfordshire. Ward's father had taught moral philosophy and dogmatic theology there since 1846, the year following his conversion.<br>
<br>The year after Ward's birth his father moved the family to the Isle of Wight where he had come into an inheritance, but within three years he returned to Ware and remained there for another ten years. Bernard's earliest instruction was at home under the care of tutors, but he entered St Edmund's in August 1868 and remained there as a lay student until 1875. He planned to enter upon a business career, but first, accompanied by his sister Emily, he toured Canada and the United States. He had developed a taste for travel when, in 1873, he joined a pilgrimage to Paray-le-Monial. A year later he visited the shrine of St Edmund at Pontigny. His first visit to Rome was in 1877, and he returned in 1879 when he included Switzerland and Lourdes in his itinerary. Shortly afterwards he determined to become a priest.<br>
<br>In January 1880 Ward began his theological studies at Oscott College, Birmingham, where he was ordained deacon on Holy Saturday 1882. He then returned to St Edmund's as prefect of discipline and on 8 October 1882 was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Manning in the chapel of the Archbishop's House. In 1885 he was assigned the task of founding a mission at Willesden, where he worked until January 1888, when he accepted a position at Oscott as professor of science. In the summer of 1890, however, he returned to St Edmund's as vice-president and prefect of studies. He remained there until 1916.<br>
<br>When Herbert Vaughan became archbishop of Westminster in 1892, St Edmund's was in precarious financial straits, with a declining number of students. Vaughan considered closing the college, but first appointed Ward as president to see what might be done to save it. Ward proved to be a far-sighted and astute administrator. He was also generous in sharing his personal resources to benefit the college.<br>
<br>In 1893, to mark the centenary of St Edmund's, Ward founded <span class="italic">The Edmundian</span>, the college magazine, for which, until 1915, he wrote most of the editorial notes. Also in 1893 he published his <span class="italic">History of St Edmund's College</span>, thus launching his historical career. In April 1895 he was elevated to the rank of domestic prelate by Pope Leo XIII. In that year, in response to a request by Cardinal Vaughan, the Holy See gave permission for Catholics to attend English universities. Ward, hopeful that at least some students at St Edmund's would receive university degrees, began negotiations which led to the affiliation of the college with the University of Cambridge, &#145;on the understanding that a hostel subject to the ordinary laws of the University should be opened there&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Edmundian</span>, 12, 1920, 331). With the financial assistance of the duke of Norfolk, St Edmund's House was founded, and in 1897 studies were arranged at St Edmund's College for the Cambridge local examinations.<br>
<br>Ward was instrumental in founding an organization of Catholic headmasters which he served as secretary. On three occasions (1898, 1906, 1911), he hosted meetings of the group at St Edmund's. He was also a member of the education committee of the Hertfordshire county council. In May 1903, to mark the golden jubilee of the college chapel, he published his <span class="italic">Life of St Edmund</span>, as well as <span class="italic">Catholic London a Hundred Years Ago</span>.<br>
<br>In 1905 Ward was named a canon of the archdiocese of Westminster. In October 1907 a rumour circulated to the effect that he was to be the new bishop of Northampton. The appointment was never made, but he seems to have been unable to settle down again at the college. During the subsequent six years he nevertheless made his most significant historical contribution with <span class="italic">The Dawn of the Catholic Revival in England, 1781&#150;1803</span> (2 vols., 1909), <span class="italic">The eve of Catholic emancipation, being the history of the English Catholics during the first thirty years of the nineteenth century</span> (3 vols., 1911), and <span class="italic">The Sequel to Catholic Emancipation, 1830&#150;1850</span> (2 vols., 1915). These seven volumes have remained the most comprehensive study of Roman Catholic institutional life in the last quarter of the eighteenth and first half of the nineteenth centuries. Ward was inspired, at least in part, by the work of Canon Edwin Burton, vice-president of St Edmund's, whose <span class="italic">Life and Times of Bishop Challoner</span> (2 vols., 1909) he had read in manuscript form. His own research was carried out in England and also in Rome where he consulted documents at the English College as well as those which he was permitted to use at the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith. In 1909 he was elected a member of the Old Brotherhood of the Secular Clergy, an honour which he deeply appreciated.<br>
<br>In November 1915 Ward's health clearly began to fail. He formally resigned his office on 19 July 1916 and was appointed to the mission at Brook Green, Hammersmith. In 1917 he was named bishop of the new diocese of Essex. He was to serve initially as apostolic administrator of the designated territory until the new diocese could be organized. He was elevated to the episcopate, therefore, as titular bishop of Lydda. Within a few months it was determined that Brentwood would be the cathedral town of the diocese, and in October of 1917 Ward was enthroned there.<br>
<br>In spite of poor health, Ward proved to be an energetic bishop, visiting every church of the diocese as well as undertaking the annual visitation of all convents. New missions were opened, the cathedral chapter was formed, and churches were consecrated. In 1918 he published a volume on <span class="italic">The Priestly Vocation</span>, composed of lectures that he had given as president of St Edmund's. In March of 1919 he made his <i>ad limina</i> visit to Rome and later in the year, his last pilgrimage to Lourdes. He died during the night of 20 January 1920 and was buried, as he had requested, in the chapel of St Edmund's College on the 26th.<br>
