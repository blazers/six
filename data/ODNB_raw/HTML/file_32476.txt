<span class="headword">Codner,  Maurice Frederick</span>  (1888&#150;1958), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born in Stoke Newington, London, on 27 September 1888, the third son of William Squires Codner, iron merchant, of Abbotskerswell, Devon, and his wife, Ada Mary Payne. Codner was educated at the Stationers' Company School, but the details of his early career are not recorded. In 1913 he married Eleanor Marion, daughter of Thomas Fairfield, a captain in the mercantile marine, and during the First World War he served in France in the Royal Devon hussars. His parents owned property at Dedham, Essex, where in 1919 he was befriended by Alfred Munnings while out hunting. At some point Codner attended the Colchester School of Art, but is recorded by Munnings as working part-time as assistant curator three days a week at the Iveagh Bequest, Kenwood, London, in the late 1920s. Encouraged by Munnings, he abandoned his employment and soon became widely known for his portraits in oils of distinguished men and women. These were exhibited principally from 1929 at the Royal Society of Portrait Painters, of which he became a member in 1937, and in 1945 the honorary secretary, but also from 1928 at the Royal Academy and in many galleries in Great Britain and elsewhere. His work was always notable for its sincerity. He was singularly modest about its merits and in occasional moods of depression would regard his portraits merely as a way of making a living.<br>
<br>Codner had several public successes. His portrait of George VI in field marshal's uniform and Garter robes as captain-general of the Honourable Artillery Company (Armoury House, London), executed in 1951, was admired at the time and was the last portrait painted of the king. His portrait of Queen Elizabeth, the queen mother (1952), painted for the twenty-fifth birthday number of <span class="italic">Woman's Journal</span>, won the silver medal in 1954 at the Paris Salon, where in 1938 his portrait of Sir George Broadbridge, lord mayor of London, in his coronation robes (Guildhall, London) had received an honourable mention. Many of his portraits, however, were pre-eminently what are called good likenesses rather than a penetrating analysis of character. In this he was extremely successful and at his peak in the 1940s and early 1950s was producing ten to fifteen such routine portraits a year, his work being especially in demand for the board-rooms of businessmen and company directors. For these he was often assisted by his only son, John Whitlock Orby Squires Codner, whose own work (under the pseudonym John Whitlock) is virtually indistinguishable from his father's.<br>
<br>Among Codner's well-known sitters were Field Marshal Lord Alexander of Tunis (1946), Gwilym Lloyd-George (later Viscount Tenby; 1955), and the architect Sir Albert Richardson (1956; Art-Workers' Guild, London), but it was perhaps only with theatrical personalities that his portraits achieved anything like distinction. For the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London, he painted Sir George Robey in the role of Falstaff (1935), followed by a further version in the comedian's familiar make-up of bowler hat and red nose. Other portraits of actors and actresses included Athene Seyler, Evelyn Laye (1933), and Leslie Henson (1952). His portrait of the contralto Kathleen Ferrier (1946; National Portrait Gallery, London), with its theatrical lighting, lurid colours, and coarse brushwork, encapsulates both the best and the worst facets of his portrait style. With his occasional landscapes Codner felt that he had more freedom and in this was influenced by the example of Munnings, whose portrait of Codner, <span class="italic">Sketching at Wiston Bridge</span> (1935), is a striking tribute to their friendship. Open-air sketching was his great relaxation, as was the pleasure he shared with Munnings in riding and a love of horses.<br>
<br>In appearance Codner was extremely well groomed; tall, slim, with a neatly trimmed beard and moustache, closely cut hair, and a rather pronounced nose, he had the distinguished and rather theatrical air of the prosperous and successful artist. His studio, which adjoined his small house at 26 Temple Fortune Hill in Hampstead Garden Suburb, Middlesex, where he lived for his entire career, was a comfortable and workmanlike place, well adapted to his various sitters. This and his little garden full of roses and trees were his pride and joy. Maurice Frederick Codner died at Beaumont House, Beaumont Street, London, on 10 March 1958 and was buried at Dedham, Essex, in his much beloved Constable country.<br>
