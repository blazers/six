<span class="headword">Singleton,  Henry</span>  (1766&#150;1839), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in London into an artistic family on 19 October 1766. He lost his father before the age of two, and was brought up by his uncle, William Singleton (<i>d</i>. 1793), a pupil of Ozias Humphry (whom Henry painted: exh. Society of Artists, 1797), and painter of portraits, fancy heads, and miniatures. Another uncle, Joseph Singleton, exhibited miniatures at the Royal Academy between 1777 and 1783.<br>
<br>Henry Singleton was precocious: he worked as a professional portraitist from the age of sixteen, and exhibited at the Society of Artists in Spring Gardens in 1780 <span class="italic">A Soldier Returned to his Family</span>, a pen drawing, by &#145;Master H. Singleton, aged ten years&#146;. He attended the Royal Academy Schools from 1783, winning the silver medal in 1784 and the gold medal in 1788 for a painting from Dryden's ode <span class="italic">Alexander's Feast</span>. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1784 until his death, at the British Institution between 1806 and 1839, and at the Society of British Artists from its foundation in 1824.<br>
<br>A measure of Singleton's early promise was the commission he received from the Royal Academy in 1793 to paint a large portrait group of the academicians under their president, Benjamin West, <span class="italic">The Royal Academicians assembled in their council chamber to adjudge the medals to the successful students in painting, sculpture, architecture, and drawing</span> (RA). This complex and impressive composition contains forty portraits, with some evidently being added as late as 1798, and was engraved in 1802 by C. Bestland. However, Singleton never became an academician himself, and was unsuccessful in gaining an associateship, first in 1807 and again in 1811.<br>
<br>Singleton was first noted for large historical compositions from the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, Shakespeare, or contemporary historical events. Many were engraved in mezzotint on a suitably large scale by Gillbank and Charles Turner and published by James Daniell. Two of the best, <span class="italic">Paul I Granting Liberty to Kosciuszko</span> (1797) and <span class="italic">The Death of Captain Alexander Hood after Capturing the French 74 &#145;L'Hercule&#146;, 21 April 1798</span>, were engraved, the latter in colours, by Daniell himself (BM). Although Singleton remained a popular artist, whose works were always in demand, he never fulfilled his original promise as a history painter. His figures, compositions, and colour became relatively weak, and most of his sentimental and genre scenes, painted in a manner that blended the styles of George Morland and Francis Wheatley, were designed for stipple engravers such as W. Bond, Thomas Burke, James Godby, and Anthony Cardon. Singleton also provided book illustrations, and those done for Sharpe's classics and other serials have charm. He completed a series of cabinet pictures to illustrate Shakespeare shortly before his death.<br>
<br>Singleton remained an effective portrait painter, in a style somewhat influenced by Romney, and those of, for example, Lord Nelson and Admiral Vernon were engraved. A small but vigorous portrait by him of Lord Howe is in the National Portrait Gallery, London; a portrait group of James Boswell with his wife and family was lent by Ralph Dundas to the Edinburgh loan exhibition of Scottish national portraits in 1884.<br>
<br>In 1807 Singleton married William Singleton's only daughter (<i>d</i>. 1811). His sisters Maria and Sarah Macklarinan Singleton were also artists: the former exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1808 and 1820; the latter was a miniaturist who exhibited portraits at the Royal Academy between 1788 and 1813 and lived with Henry for twenty or thirty years, latterly at 4 Haymarket, London. He lived during the latter part of his life in Charles Street, St James's, London, in comfortable circumstances, and for some years was the oldest living exhibitor at the Royal Academy. He was in Paris briefly in 1813, but otherwise appears not to have travelled save for visits to the country. He died at the house of a friend at 7 Kensington Gore, London, on 15 September 1839, and was buried in the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields. A large collection of sketches is in the British Museum, and other works are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh, the Tate collection, the Ulster Museum, and Brighton Art Gallery.<br>
