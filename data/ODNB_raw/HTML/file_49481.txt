<span class="headword">Niven,  Frederick John</span>  (1878&#150;1944), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 31 March 1878 in Valpara&iacute;so, Chile, the youngest of the three children of John Niven, originally a sewed muslin manufacturer in Glasgow though temporarily in the British consular service, and his wife, Jane, daughter of George Barclay, a Baptist preacher. When Niven was five years old the family returned to Glasgow, where he was educated at Hutchesons' Boys' Grammar School.<br>
<br>His parents opposed Niven's wish to become a painter, and as a compromise he enrolled for evening classes in Glasgow School of Art while beginning an apprenticeship in a soft goods manufacturing warehouse. He later wrote in his autobiography: &#145;I was not enthusiastic about manufacturing &hellip; it was Charlie Maclean, head of the wincey department, who informed me, gazing at me solemnly one day, &#147;Freddy, the plain fact is that ye dinna gie a spittle for your work&#148; &#146;  (Niven, 26&#150;7). He left for more congenial employment with MacLehose &amp; Son, librarians and booksellers in Glasgow.<br>
<br>In 1899, because of lung trouble, Niven travelled to British Columbia, Canada, where he regained his health and led an energetic outdoor life. On his return to Glasgow he began a career in journalism. He moved to England and his first novel, <span class="italic">The Lost Cabin Mine</span>, appeared in 1908. In 1911 he married Mary Pauline Thorne-Quelch (<i>d</i>. 1968), who, as his editor's daughter, had typed his manuscripts. <span class="italic">Justice of the Peace</span>, his best-known novel, was published in 1914 and attracted critical praise, not least for its affectionate and detailed picture of Glasgow.<br>
<br>Found unfit for military service, Niven spent the First World War in London, working for a time in the War Office under the novelist John Buchan. In 1920 he returned to Canada with his wife to settle on the shores of Kootenay Lake, near Nelson, British Columbia, and became a full-time novelist. He produced a number of &#145;potboiler&#146; westerns and historical novels set in North America, but became respected as a Canadian novelist with the publication of his &#145;prairie trilogy&#146;, <span class="italic">The Flying Years</span> (1935), <span class="italic">Mine Inheritance</span> (1940), and <span class="italic">The Transplanted</span> (1944), which describe the opening up of the Canadian west through the eyes of expatriate Scots.<br>
<br>However, Niven also continued to write the realistic novels of Scottish urban life for which he is better known in Britain. Autobiographical elements can be traced in many of these, with their recurrent themes of Calvinism and maternal influence. <span class="italic">Justice of the Peace</span> is the story of a young man apprenticed in his father's textile warehouse but determined to become a painter. The father&#150;son relationship is well handled, though the portrait of the forbidding, neurotic mother has elements of melodrama. The eponymous mother in <span class="italic">Mrs Barry</span> (1933), in contrast, is perhaps implausibly good and heroic. Niven retained clear memories of his youth in Glasgow and returned to a warehouse setting for <span class="italic">The Staff at Simson's</span> (1937), a near-documentary novel which follows characters over twenty years.<br>
<br>Although he expressed great affection for Scotland, Niven remained in Canada for the rest of his life. After a series of heart attacks he died in hospital in Vancouver on 30 January 1944. His wife survived him.<br>
