<span class="headword">Craufurd,  Patrick <span class="st"> [Peter]</span>, of Auchenames</span>  (<em>c.</em>1704&#150;1778), <span class="occ">politician and landowner</span>, was the first surviving son of Patrick Craufurd (<i>d</i>. 1733), a wealthy Edinburgh merchant, and his second wife, Jean (<i>d</i>. 1740), daughter of Archibald Craufurd of Auchenames and Crosbie. The younger Patrick (or familiarly, Peter) Craufurd began life as a merchant like his father, and inherited a substantial fortune on the latter's death. About 1740 he married Elizabeth Middleton (<i>d</i>. 1746), daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49134/', "George Middleton")</script> of Errol, Perthshire, a London banker. By his marriage he acquired another fortune and a life interest in the estate of Errol, where he chiefly resided after his father-in-law's death in 1747. The couple had two sons, John (1742?&#150;1814) and James (<i>c</i>.1744&#150;1811). Elizabeth died on 19 July 1746, and on 22 April 1750 Craufurd married Sarah&#151;also known as Sally&#151;Sempill (<i>d</i>. 1751), eldest daughter of Hew, twelfth Baron Sempill. This marriage produced one daughter, Sarah (1751?&#150;1796), before the elder Sarah's death on 25 April 1751.<br>
<br>For much of his life Craufurd appears to have been a good-hearted and colourful, if rather na&iuml;ve, individual. While James Boswell described him as &#145;a very honest and a very generous man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Boswell's London Journal</span>, 9 Jan 1763, 130), Lord Eglinton wrote of him in 1760, when Craufurd was in his mid-fifties:<blockquote>[he] is drinking, hunting and whoring <i>com un possede</i>. I am an eye witness to the drinking, an ear witness to the whoring, and as he has just bought a terrier from a tailor in Ayr I can make no doubt he intends to commence foxhunter. Lord have mercy upon what Peter will cut flying over a five bar gate, with his flowing bob, jackboot, holster, bit and housing. (Eglinton to Bute, 26 Jan 1760, Bute MS 134/1)</blockquote>Craufurd had no compunction about using his wealth to help forge a political career. In 1740 he was adopted as opposition candidate for Ayrshire, and was elected in 1741, following a contest. In 1747 he was re-elected without a contest, but in 1754 faced serious opposition from James Mure Campbell, Lord Loudoun's cousin, and from Archibald Montgomerie, brother of the tenth earl of Eglinton. Despite using bribery on a massive scale Craufurd was eventually forced to join Eglinton in a coalition, but still suffered defeat when the duke of Argyll and the ministry threw their full support behind Campbell.<br>
<br>Out of parliament Craufurd divided his time between Scotland and London, where, through his close friend William Mure of Caldwell&#151;to whose judgement he deferred throughout his political life&#151;he became connected with the Bute circle. In 1758, with Bute's support, Mure proposed Craufurd as candidate for Ayr burghs; Argyll regarded Bute's intervention as a challenge to his own authority as &#145;manager&#146; of Scotland and a bitter quarrel resulted. Argyll used his interest against Craufurd, whose campaign, despite the use of extensive bribery again, appeared to be doomed. However, the accession of George III in October 1760 tipped the scales in Bute's favour, forcing Argyll to negotiate a series of electoral compromises that included Craufurd's return as MP in 1761, albeit for Renfrewshire rather than Ayr burghs.<br>
<br>In parliament, while relying on Mure for advice on Scottish affairs, Craufurd faithfully supported the Bute and subsequent administrations, with the exception of that of Rockingham, who listed Craufurd as &#145;doubtful&#146;. Craufurd disapproved of but did not oppose the window tax, and, while supporting the creation of a Scottish militia, felt that this should not happen until it could form part of a unified British militia.<br>
<br>Notwithstanding his own unruly behaviour, Craufurd was a thrifty man as regards his own fortune and estates, and deplored what he perceived as the profligate behaviour and extravagance of his sons: despite his evident affection for his elder son, John, he repeatedly quarrelled with him over financial matters. In 1766, to protect the Errol estate, Craufurd took out an inhibition against John, requiring him to entail the estate and prohibiting anyone from lending to him. A reconciliation followed, whereby the Errol revenues were made over to John, who in return assisted his father in his campaign for the 1768 general election. Craufurd's hold on Renfrewshire was insecure: his only residence there was the ruined castle of Auchenames and he was regarded as an Ayrshireman. He prepared for an expensive campaign, but when two opponents challenged him he seems to have handed over the management of the election entirely to John. After prolonged negotiations he stood down and gave his interest to William MacDowall, on condition that John should be the candidate at the next general election.<br>
<br>Thereafter Craufurd lived mainly in Edinburgh and in Bath. In 1771 he put John in possession of the Errol estate but later once again became increasingly and obsessively anxious about the need to provide safeguards in the form of an entail. He insisted on John's entailing his estates along with Craufurd's own, a step which John said &#145;I know I shall repent all the rest of my life&#146; and begged Mure to assist him in undoing  (Mure, 2.217). He was successful, but at the cost of another rift with his father. It was reported by David Hume in 1774 that Craufurd &#145;wanted nothing from you [John] except your friendship which he was sorry he could not obtain and it was the circumstance that embittered his remaining days&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2.283&#150;4). Hume's intervention nevertheless seems to have healed the breach, and Craufurd, despite failing powers, assisted John at the 1774 general election. Patrick Craufurd died in Edinburgh on 10 January 1778.<br>
