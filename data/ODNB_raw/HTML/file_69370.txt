<span class="headword">Roper,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1524), <span class="occ">legal official</span>, was the son of John Roper (<i>d</i>. 1487) of Swalecliffe, Kent, sometime sheriff of that county, and his wife, Margery, daughter and coheir of John Tatershall. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 8 July 1486, and called to the bar a few years later, perhaps before he was added to the commission of the peace for Kent in 1493. In Easter term 1498 he became chief clerk (or protonotary) of the king's bench by appointment of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10261/', "Sir John Fyneux")</script>, the chief justice, whose daughter Jane (<i>d</i>. 1544?) he had married by 1495. His tenure over the next quarter of a century coincided with an expansion of the court's business through the development of bill procedure, for which Roper was responsible, and of the substantive remedies over which Fyneux presided. It has been suggested that they headed a kind of &#145;Kentish mafia&#146; operating the court for their own profit. Profit they undoubtedly did. The tax survey of 1523 found that Fyneux and Roper had more personal wealth than any other lawyer in the land. And a number of fellow Kentishmen were preferred to clerical offices in the court while they held sway. On the other hand, their reforms undeniably improved the quality of justice and were overdue.<br>
<br>In 1518 Fyneux agreed to a resettlement of the clerkship on Roper and his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24074/', "William Roper (1495x8&#150;1578)")</script>, biographer of Thomas More, who held it until the reign of Elizabeth. Indeed, successive members of the Roper family were to enjoy the office by a succession of life estates until the seventeenth century. John Roper did not give up his legal practice by reason of his administrative duties. He read twice in Lincoln's Inn (in 1504 and 1508), is mentioned as counsel in the court of requests in 1505, was appointed counsel to the Cinque Ports in 1505, and was retained as counsel by the duchy of Lancaster from 1512; his signature as counsel is found on bills in chancery after 1515; and he was steward of the liberty of Battle Abbey by 1520. In 1519 he was commissioned to hear poor men's causes in Thomas Wolsey's remodelled court of requests. On 3 July 1521 he was appointed the king's attorney-general, an office that he held concurrently with the chief clerkship until he died.<br>
<br>The exchequer records give the date of Roper's death as 29 March 1524, which seems more likely than 7 April, the date given on his monument, since his successor as attorney-general was appointed on 1 April. He was buried in St Dunstan's, Canterbury, where his tomb chest still remains, but without the brass figures and inscription plate, which were long ago removed. He left four children. William, who became sole chief clerk of the king's bench, inherited a house at Eltham, Kent, as well as the one in Canterbury. The second son, Christopher (<i>d</i>. 1558/9), of Lynsted, Kent, and Gray's Inn, MP for Rochester in 1553, was father of John Roper, who was elevated to the peerage as Baron Teynham and settled the chief clerkship on trust in 1616. Eleanor (or Helen) married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19006/', "Sir Edward Montagu")</script>, chief justice of the common pleas, and his other daughter, Elizabeth, married first John Pilbarowe of Lincoln's Inn, baron of the exchequer, and then Leonard Sandell, clerk of the crown in the king's bench.<br>
