<span class="headword">Shorton,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1535), <span class="occ">college head</span>, is of unknown parentage and place of birth, although a northern origin is likely. He graduated BA from Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1501, is recorded as fellow of Jesus in 1503, and was elected fellow of Pembroke College on 25 November 1505, treasurer in 1509, and lector in divinity some time between 1509 and February 1511. Shorton's treasurership prepared him for his duties at St John's, of which he was officially designated master in its foundation charter (9 April 1511). He owed his preferment to John Fisher as his letter of thanks, dated 6 February 1511, makes clear. He remained master until an uncertain date in 1516. His main task was to supervise the building of the college, and his accounts survive between 31 January 1511 and 21 January 1516. Legal problems, including a boundary dispute with the King's Hall, also had to be resolved. At an unknown date he donated &pound;10 to the college to pave the hall.<br>
<br>On 21 October, most probably in 1516, the fellows of Pembroke College invited Shorton to return as master, stressing his virtue and learning, and the advantage to the college of having as master one who had been nurtured by it. They were correct in anticipating generosity. Shorton added properties near and at Orton Waterville, Huntingdonshire, to the manor and advowson of Orton already owned by the college. These were the manor of Chesterton Vescie, conveyed in 1518, and Rowse's estate, consisting of a messuage, three tofts and gardens, and 61 acres, conveyed in 1525. He also gave Pembroke chapel sets of white damask vestments for priest, deacon, and subdeacon, for the soul of Master William Thomson.<br>
<br>In the 1520s Shorton rose to eminence. He gained high-church preferments, some via the patronage of Cardinal Wolsey, for whose college at Oxford he selected some scholars. By 1527 he was dean of the cardinal's own chapel, and in that year was appointed canon and prebendary of St George's Chapel, Windsor. From 1529 he was dean of the collegiate college of Stoke by Clare, Suffolk, and archdeacon of Bath. He resigned the mastership of Pembroke in 1534 or early 1535. He was almoner to Queen Katherine of Aragon, and is reported to have spoken in her favour when consulted about her divorce from Henry VIII. Nevertheless, Shorton maintained amicable relations with Cromwell. He wrote on 27 June 1535 approving Cromwell's reformation of Stoke College, and bequeathed him five pieces of arras.<br>
<br>Shorton's will, dated 8 October 1535, requested burial at the college of Stoke by Clare, and left sums for the poor of twenty towns, including Newport, Essex, where he was master of St Leonard's Hospital, and to his tenants at Wells, probably Norfolk, and his parishes of Sedgefield, co. Durham, and Lowther, Westmorland. Noteworthy among the bequests was a gilt salt with a cover &#145;antyke&#146; to Thomas Legh, and the sum of &pound;40 to maintain highways in Essex. Separately he arranged for obits at Pembroke, St John's, St Catharine's, and Peterhouse, accompanied by distributions to the fellows. That at Peterhouse contains a reference to keeping the obit for twenty years &#145;or for so long as the king's laws will suffer it&#146;. In 1546 it was reported that he had left the funds to buy the greater part of a farm at Whittlesford to endow his obit at Pembroke. He died on or about 17 October 1535, and his will was proved on 8 November.<br>
