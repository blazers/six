<span class="headword">Warren,  Hardick</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1650), <span class="occ">hermetic philosopher</span>, is known only from what may be gleaned from a single printed pamphlet. Inspired by reading the work of William Lilly (p. 16), Warren wrote this work when a young man&#151;&#145;my tender years, which indeed are not many&#146;  (sig. A3)&#151;in his &#145;private chamber&#146; in London, on 9 November 1650. Entitled <span class="italic">Magick and Astrology Vindicated</span>, and carrying two recommendatory verses by &#145;W. A.&#146; and &#145;J. R.&#146;, it was published in 1651 by Nathaniel Brook at the Angel in Cornhill, and was Warren's first, and seemingly his only, published work. His text was part of the pamphlet debates characteristic of the literature produced during the civil war period in England. Written in direct response and reply to an earlier pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">A Brief Declaration Against Judicial Astrology</span> (1650) by John Raunce, to whom Warren refers as the &#145;Priests Champion&#146;  (p. 1), it is part of the upsurge in interest in the occult arts and sciences, alternative religions and Paracelsian medicine in England and Europe in the 1650s and 1660s. Warren claimed he was trying to unite being a natural philosopher, a Platonist, an astrologer, a stoic, a &#145;Hermet&#146;, and a Christian  (pp. 30&#150;31). He offered a passionate, Neoplatonic defence of natural magic and natural astrology, explicitly distinguishing them from various &#145;diabolical practises&#146;  (sig. A2<i>v</i>) with which they had become associated, such as &#145;Necromancy, Witchcraft and the rest&#146;  (p. 3). <br>
<br>Warren's Neoplatonic conceptual prism refracts his specific religious, scientific, and political understanding. He cites Plato as his authority for saying that magic &#145;is an Art of Worshipping God&#146;. Warren's magical religion is a form of antisemitic  (p. 6), mystical, Christianity; an ancient theology (prisca theologia) in which Christianity was articulated through its Egyptian, Hebrew, Persian, Babylonian, and Greek Platonic influences. He sees this magical religion as scientific, the &#145;practical part of natural philosophy&#146; involving: &#145;the investigation of those admirable Vertues, and occult Properties, which that infinite Wisdom hath bestowed and given to his Creatures; and how fitly to apply those things that are to work, to those things that are to suffer&#146;  (p. 5). Its investigative light is diffused from the &#145;first and true Light&#146; from the divine mind, God, through the angels, the intelligences, the celestials, finally into man's mind where &#145;it is made a bright discourse of Reason, and the knowledge of divine things, and wholly rational&#146;  (pp. 11&#150;12). Although the actual causal mechanism between the zodiac and its effect/signification is not discernible by reason, this does not lead Warren to question its scientific status. In his thinking it is comparable to the &#145;hidden Qualities&#146; in the magnet or digestion, which we experience, but of which we do not know the &#145;secret Cause&#146;. <br>
<br>This rational religion of natural magic is also a Paracelsian-influenced, physical medicine. &#145;Magick is the Connexion of Natural Agents and Patients&#146;, and:<blockquote>doth contain the whole Philosophy of Nature, which is that which bringeth to light the hidden Vertues, and drawing them out of Natures Bosom, and converting them to humane uses, by applying those things that work to those that suffer &hellip; it is nothing else but a mutual application of Natural Vertues, Agent and Suffering reciprocally. (p. 4)</blockquote>It is linked implicitly with the doctrine of signatures through the ability it gives its practitioner to perceive the &#145;shewing forth of virtue&#146; that God in his wisdom has infused into all inferior matter, the knowledge of which in turn, citing Ficino, &#145;may in some measure bring us to the true knowledge of the Divinity of Christ&#146;  (p. 5). <br>
<br>With regard to politics, Warren's pamphlet bears traces of the language of republicanism when he writes of the established churches and how their &#145;Sisypus Robberies of us the Commonalty (under specious pretence of a divine Right) with endless toyl&#146;. There are also Hartlibian overtones when he writes of the &#145;Public Good&#146; of making true natural magic available &#145;in thy own Dialect, not tyed in a Gardian knot of impossibilities&#146;. <br>
<br>Yet at the same time there is an &eacute;litism in Warren's thinking. For true understanding of the divine knowledge is &#145;found out and attained but by a very few&#146;, what he calls &#145;the true Sons of Minerva&#146;  (p. 4). As a consequence, his preferred system of government appears to be one born of a mystical union of church and state, in which a divinely appointed monarch rules through his Magi:<blockquote>the Giver of Forms distributeth them by the Ministry of Intelligences, which he hath appointed over his works, Governors and Keepers, unto whom this ability is entrusted in things committed to them, That every vertue of Stones, herbs, Minerals, and all the rest, might be from the Intelligences governing. (p. 7)</blockquote>There is however no sense of contract in this notion of sovereignty, or election of representatives. Instead Warren claims that the divine light that shines in man:<blockquote>is manifest by the <i>disposition</i> of the <i>body</i>, as the Peripateticks will have it, or which I conceive is more true, according to the pleasure of the Cause giving, which distributes to every one according to his Will, from thence it passeth the <i>fancy</i>, and as yet it is above the <i>senses</i>, and being only imagineable, at length it attains to the <i>senses</i>, and especially to that of the <i>eyes</i>, in that it is made a <i>visible clearness</i>, and is stretched forth in each of these prospicious bodies, in which it becomes a <i>colour</i>, and a <i>shining fireness</i>. (p. 12)</blockquote>It is by this distinctly physiognomical means that Warren's magi become known, especially by the look in their eyes.<br>
