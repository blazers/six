<span class="headword">Walsh,  John</span>  (1835&#150;1881), <span class="occ">poet and schoolmaster</span>, was born on 1 April 1835 at Belville Park, Cappoquin, co. Waterford, of which estate his father, William Walsh, was steward. He was educated at Cappoquin national school, where he became a monitor and then an assistant teacher. In January 1853 he entered the Marlborough Street Training School, Dublin, and in October 1854 was put in charge of the Cappoquin national school where he remained until early 1869, when he held a similar position at Whitechurch, co. Waterford. He married a Tipperary woman, Julia Kavanagh (not to be confused with the Tipperary novelist and biographer of that name, 1824&#150;1877). They had six children, including the minor poet Paul Walsh (<i>d</i>. 1891).<br>
<br>During his time in Dublin, Walsh came under the influence of the poet Robert Dwyer Joyce, who probably encouraged an interest in Irish legend and song. (Walsh is to be distinguished from the barrister John Walsh, who wrote verse for the same journal under the pseudonym Montanus. He was also unrelated to Edward Walsh (1805&#150;1850), poet and translator.) A national schoolmaster &#145;could not safely parade the authorship&#146; of poems of national sentiment  (<span class="italic">Irish Monthly</span>, 1892, 433) and thus Walsh had many <i>noms de plume</i>: in the <span class="italic">Irish Harp</span> (1863) he signed himself Lyrista; in <span class="italic">The Irishman</span>, Shamrock (and later Lismore); in <span class="italic">The Celt</span> (Kilkenny), Corner Stone; in the <span class="italic">Waterford Citizen</span>, A Cappoquin Girl; and in the <span class="italic">Irish People</span>, Kilmartin. In <span class="italic">The Nation</span> he wrote as J. J. W., J. W., and Boz. He also wrote for <span class="italic">The Emerald</span> in 1868, a journal edited by his brother-in-law Michael Kavanagh who had emigrated in 1848 to Washington, USA.<br>
<br>Walsh's poems have occasionally been anthologized, but as they are by turns sentimental and banal, most scarcely justify collection. His &#145;Lament of the Ejected Irish Peasant&#146;, however, printed in <span class="italic">Dublin University Magazine</span> (35/205, January 1850, 134&#150;5), was republished as a broadside, and his &#145;Drimin donn dilis&#146; (&#145;Dear brown cow&#146;) found its way into the edition of Stopford A. Brooke and T. W. Rolleston, <span class="italic">A Treasury of Irish Poetry in the English Tongue</span> (1900):<blockquote>
<div>Oh! <i>drimin donn dilis!</i> the landlord has come,<br>
</div>
<div>Like a foul blast of death has he swept o'er our home;<br>
</div>
<div>He has withered our roof-tree&#151;beneath the cold sky,<br>
</div>
<div>Poor, houseless, and homeless, to-night we must lie.<br>
</div>
<div>&hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>But they racked and they ground me with tax and with rent,<br>
</div>
<div>Till my heart it was sore and my life blood was spent:<br>
</div>
<div>Today they have finished, and on the wide world<br>
</div>
<div>With the mocking of fiends from my home I was hurled.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Both poems have more recently been anthologized in <span class="italic">The Hungry Voice: the Poetry of the Irish Famine</span> (1989, 77&#150;8).<br>
<br>In 1872 Walsh took charge of the national school in Cashel, co. Tipperary, where he died on 27 February 1881. He was buried in the graveyard attached to the ruins on the Rock of Cashel.<br>
