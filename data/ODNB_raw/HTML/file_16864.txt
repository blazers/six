<span class="headword">Gruffudd Llwyd, Sir</span> <span class="st"> [Gruffudd ap Rhys]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1335), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was the son of Rhys ap Gruffudd (<i>d</i>. 1284) and a great-grandson of Ednyfed Fychan (<i>d</i>. 1246), seneschal to Llywelyn ab Iorwerth, called Llywelyn the Great (<i>d</i>. 1240). Gruffudd's forebears had ties of service with the thirteenth-century princes, but his father had served Edward I in the wars of 1277 and 1282&#150;3. Rhys died in 1284, leaving his estates, including Tregarnedd, Anglesey, and Dinorwig, Caernarfon, and his share of lands at Llanrhystud, Cardigan, and Llansadwrn, Carmarthen, to his son. Gruffudd joined Queen Isabella's household and, a yeoman of the king's household by 1283, he soon began a long but not unbroken association with the crown as its leading servant in north Wales. In 1294&#150;5 he served in the forces engaged in suppressing the rebellion of Madog ap Llywelyn but before the end of 1295, &#145;by the malice of his enemies&#146; according to his own account  (Edwards, &#145;Sir Gruffydd Llwyd&#146;, 600), he began an imprisonment lasting six months. Whatever the reason for his detention, service in Flanders in 1297, when he led an infantry force from north Wales, was a means of earning renewed royal confidence in his fidelity. Thereafter he frequently served as a commissioner of array in north Wales, raising forces for Scotland, and he is found in attendance on the prince of Wales during the campaigns of 1301 and 1306. Knighted by 1301, he served terms as sheriff of each of the counties of Anglesey, Caernarfon, and Merioneth.<br>
<br>Gruffudd Llwyd played an important role in the difficult situation which confronted Edward II in 1315&#150;16. An army under Edward Bruce waged a forceful and destructive campaign in Ireland, and the Scots' emphasis on their kinship with the Irish raised fears that the Welsh, too, might be involved in a broad challenge to English authority. Commissioners sent to Wales to provide for the defence of the land were instructed to communicate with influential members of the Welsh community and were specially urged to consult Gruffudd Llwyd. He subsequently took part in discussions with the king's council at Clipstone, Nottinghamshire, &#145;concerning the state of the land of Wales&#146;  (Smith, &#145;Gruffydd Llwyd&#146;, 465), and these formed the basis of ordinances issued at the Lincoln parliament early in 1316 to meet Welsh discontent. Their promulgation was prompted by rebellion in Glamorgan, but it was feared in council that insurrection, fomented perhaps by intervention on the part of the Scots, might spread to other parts of Wales. Forces from north Wales raised for service in Scotland under Gruffudd Llwyd's leadership were turned back at Chester, on information transmitted by his chaplain, because they might be needed at home in the event of attack from Ireland.<br>
<br>Gruffudd appears to be one upon whose judgement and influence the king's council relied, but even at this time of conspicuous service he endured a long imprisonment which probably began with his detention at Rhuddlan in December 1316. In a petition of 1318 he asked that he might know the charges against him, on account of which he had already been incarcerated for eighteen months. The reasons for his detention are never stated, and the problem is made more intriguing by the existence of letters by Edward Bruce and Gruffudd Llwyd, derived from the papers of the seventeenth-century antiquary Robert Vaughan. Bruce made an appeal, based on the common ancestry of the Scots and the Welsh, for a combined endeavour by which the two peoples would be released from English oppression. While his incentive to extend the armed struggle to Wales is evident, Gruffudd's reply, promising a Welsh response to a Scots intervention, is difficult to understand. Whether he was inveigled into a positive reply, possibly by adversaries bent on discrediting him, or whether this was a serious aberration on his part is impossible to determine. Gruffudd's letter was written swiftly after Roger Mortimer of Chirk (<i>d</i>. 1326) resumed the office of justice of Wales, and an animosity engendered during Mortimer's first period in office, and intensified upon his return to Wales, may explain his action.<br>
<br>Their antagonism was undoubtedly an influence which mattered greatly during Edward II's conflict with his baronial opponents in 1321&#150;2. Mortimer and those associated with him won support among the Welsh communities of the marcher areas, but his alienation of the leaders of native society in the crown lands, where he had exercised authority as justice, remained a decisive influence. Between November 1321 and February 1322 Gruffudd Llwyd launched vigorous assaults on the marchers' positions and thereby contributed much to the king's triumph over his adversaries. He may well have been exacting retribution for earlier injustices.<br>
<br>Gruffudd was prominent in royal service in the period 1322&#150;6, and he was one to whom Edward turned for aid upon Roger Mortimer of Wigmore's return to the realm, with Queen Isabella, in September 1326. The king's capture in the Welsh march enabled Mortimer to establish a hold on the administration of the crown lands. Writs were issued summoning Welsh representatives to the parliament at which Edward would be deposed, but they met with a resistance that was particularly pronounced in Merioneth, where Gruffudd Llwyd was sheriff. There was a Welsh conspiracy to release Edward from Berkeley Castle, and Gruffudd Llwyd was one of thirteen imprisoned at Caernarfon on account of their reaction to the king's deposition. In 1331 with Gruffudd's support a close associate, Hywel ap Gruffudd, brought an action in the king's bench against William Shalford, alleging Shalford's complicity in the murder of Edward II. Gruffudd is not known to have been active thereafter, and when summoned for service in Scotland in 1335 he was excused, possibly on grounds of ill-health. He was dead by 12 July 1335. Gruffudd Llwyd married Gwenllian and had two sons: Gruffudd, who died in 1322 while serving in a force led to Scotland by his father; and Ieuan, a cleric, later archdeacon of Anglesey, who succeeded to Gruffudd Llwyd's estates. According to the genealogies he also had seven daughters.<br>
<br>Older accounts, on the basis of a mistaken impression of the events of 1321&#150;2, depict Gruffudd Llwyd as a Welsh patriot in resolute opposition to English authority. Even so, the poet Gwilym Ddu, in two poems composed during Gruffudd's imprisonment in 1316&#150;18, one of them indicating confinement at Rhuddlan, expressed his grief at the injustice inflicted upon his patron by the English. Casnodyn, in a poem to Gwenllian, prayed God's help to secure her husband's release from iron fetters.<br>
