<span class="headword">Seagrave <span class="st"> [Segrave]</span>,  Nicholas  of</span>, first Lord Seagrave  (1238?&#150;1295), <span class="occ">baron</span>, was the son of the justice <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25034/', "Gilbert of Seagrave (d. 1254)")</script> and his wife, Amabilia, ultimately the sole heir of Robert of Chalcombe, and grandson of the justiciar Stephen of Seagrave. Following Gilbert's death in 1254 his lands were granted to Henry III's son Edward, allowing provision for the widow's dower; Nicholas, the heir, was described as sixteen or seventeen years old. On 2 March 1257 Seagrave, described as the king's squire (<i>valettus</i>), was ill at Windsor with two other squires, and the king's bailiff was instructed to have necessaries supplied to them until they were well. In July Seagrave was described as receiving allowances in the royal household for three horses and three boys and their shoe money, and for meat, fish, wine, and candles. Still described as squire, he made a fine of 300 marks (&pound;200) to gain seisin of his father's lands and tenements on 18 April 1258, and performed homage.<br>
<br>Too young and inexperienced for prominence in the struggle between Henry III and the reformers during 1258&#150;9, Seagrave had protection while on pilgrimage to Pontigny in the spring of 1259, and on 28 October protection while crossing with the king to France; protection was renewed until midsummer on 28 December 1259, when he was described as having gone to Pontigny. On 31 March 1260 he was one of over a hundred barons and tenants-in-chief summoned to London three weeks after Easter, and on 16 September 1261 swore to serve the king faithfully. The following month he was summoned with horses and arms. Since he was principally a Leicestershire landowner, perhaps it is not surprising that Seagrave should have chosen to align himself with the supporters of Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester, whose following was largely drawn from the midlands, or that on 7 December 1261 he should have been required, along with Montfort, Earl Warenne, Hugh Despenser, and others, to put his seal within fifteen days to the peace made at Kingston between the barons and the king.<br>
<br>The chronicler Thomas Wykes lists Seagrave among the young lords who were prominent among Montfort's supporters in the spring of 1263; he was involved in the attack on the bishop of Hereford, Peter d'Aigueblanche, on 7 June. Ordered on 25 May 1263 to go to the king at Worcester in August, there to receive knighthood, and join the Welsh expedition, in December that year he was among the barons who agreed to refer their dispute with Henry III to the arbitration of Louis IX. When the French king's award, favourable to Henry, was followed by the outbreak of civil war, Seagrave fought at Lewes in May 1264, where he led the London contingent which was routed by the Lord Edward. From 17 June 1264 until 21 April 1265 Seagrave had custody of the castle of Rockingham and the forests between the bridges of Oxford and Stamford. He was summoned to Montfort's Hilary parliament of 1265. A would-be participant in a tournament at Dunstable planned for 17 February 1265, but prohibited because of its likely threat to public order, he took part in negotiations with the king for the release of the Lord Edward. He fought at Evesham in August 1265 and was taken prisoner. Henry III, describing Seagrave as &#145;the king's enemy&#146;, then gave his lands to his own younger son Edmund. Seagrave must either have escaped or secured his release, for he had a safe conduct to treat for peace in September 1266. Nevertheless, in 1267 he was among the rebels still holding out at Ely, and there was some suspicion that either he or his mother (who had married the royalist Roger de Somery, one of the counsellors responsible for the dictum of Kenilworth) had some responsibility for its fall. Seagrave was one of the rebels admitted to Southwark in April, and had a safe conduct in the summer of 1267 for those whom he would bring to court to make peace. He was finally pardoned on 1 July 1267. The disinherited rebels were allowed to redeem their lands on a sliding scale according to their level of participation in the civil wars, and Seagrave was among those charged five years' annual value. His debt to Edmund on this score was only settled shortly after his death in 1295.<br>
<br>Once pardoned, Seagrave was rapidly taken into royal favour. In May 1270 he had protection for four years as a crusader, and in January 1271 had four years' exemption from summonses to eyres, and was licensed to appoint attorneys. From 1277 until his death in 1295 he regularly received military summonses, against the Welsh in 1277, 1282, and 1294, and to accompany Edmund in Gascony in 1295; he was also summoned to a military council at Gloucester in 1287 and to parliament in 1283 and 1295. Letters of protection in 1285 covering his going overseas with the king, and his appointing attorneys later that year when &#145;gone to Ireland&#146;, testify to a life of vigorous activity. One reward that came his way was the grant, for 100 marks, of custody of lands of William de Ferrers on 18 May 1288.<br>
<br>By the late 1280s the distinction was sometimes being made between Nicholas of Seagrave the elder and Nicholas of Seagrave the younger, giving rise to ambiguity in contemporary documentation offering no such identification. The elder Nicholas, who was close to Edward I himself in age, was summoned to parliament and to military service in the latter half of 1295, so it must be assumed that he was thought fit for action until close to his death. T. F. Tout believed that it was the younger Nicholas who probably received the castles of Dumbarton and Ayr from James, the steward of Scotland, in 1291, but the elder was involved in the Scottish Great Cause, and it seems on balance likely that, whichever was involved, it was the same Nicholas who both received the castles from James, and sat with him and the bishop of Glasgow at Ayr receiving Scottish fealties in 1291. On 6 July 1291 Nicholas of Seagrave and Henry son of Nicholas of Seagrave had protection staying in Scotland on the king's service, and the elder Nicholas (named as such) similarly in April 1292. In the procedural discussions of the Great Cause, Seagrave's name is given among those recommending recourse to English rather than imperial law, and the superiority of primogeniture over proximity as a claim. On 20 June 1294 Nicholas of Seagrave was appointed, along with the bishop of Durham, the archbishop of Dublin, and Hugh Despenser, to negotiate with the German king and the archbishop of Cologne. Less strenuous appointments in 1290&#150;92 were to various judicial commissions including investigation of maladministration in the Isle of Man, and to inquire into weirs on the Trent.<br>
<br>Seagrave's wife, Matilda, was probably a member of the Lucy family. On 26 August 1288 a commission of oyer and terminer was appointed to hear the complaint of Nicholas of Seagrave the elder and Matilda his wife that forty-six named persons of both sexes had assaulted Matilda at Exhall, Warwickshire, thrown her out of her carriage, and taken away her long cart laden with victuals and other goods. The <span class="italic">Song of Caerlaverock</span> attributes five sons to Seagrave; the eldest of these was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25038/', "John Seagrave")</script>, variously described as over thirty and (more reliably) thirty-nine at his father's death. The second son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25040/', "Nicholas Seagrave")</script>, lord of Stowe. The elder Nicholas had died by 12 November 1295, and John had done homage for his father's lands by 10 December 1295. The terms of a grant on 14 July 1292 of a market and fair at Mountsorrel, Leicestershire, and of free warren on his demesnes, along with the particulars of his inquisition post mortem, show that the estates of the elder Nicholas of Seagrave were concentrated in Derbyshire, Warwickshire, Huntingdonshire, Leicestershire, and Northamptonshire. He was buried at Chacombe Priory, Northamptonshire. At an unknown date before his death Seagrave had relinquished the arms previously borne by his family, and had adopted instead the arms, sable a lion argent rampant crowned or.<br>
