<span class="headword">Hildelith</span> <span class="st"> [St Hildelith, Hildilid]</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>700), <span class="occ">abbess of Barking</span>, was a nun of unknown origin. Barking Abbey was founded in Essex, probably during the decade 665&#150;75, by Earconwald, before he became bishop of London (675?&#150;693); it was a double monastery, housing both monks and nuns, and its first abbess was Earconwald's sister, &AElig;thelburh. Bede treats the early history of Barking in some detail  (<span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 4.6&#150;11) because he had at his disposal a <i>libellus</i> (a &#145;little book&#146;, now lost) on the miracles of St &AElig;thelburh. Unfortunately, Bede does not supply a chronological framework for Barking's early history. According to John of Worcester, &AElig;thelburh died in 675 and was succeeded by Hildelith; and Bede, drawing on the lost <i>libellus</i>, reports that she presided over the monastery for many years  (ibid., 4.10). The date of her death is unknown. According to Bede, once again, Hildelith was energetic in the observance of monastic discipline, and undertook some reconstruction at Barking in order to accommodate within the church the relics of deceased members of the community. It was to Hildelith and her community of nuns that Aldhelm (<i>d</i>. 709/10) dedicated his massive prose <span class="italic">De virginitate</span>. From the structure of this work it is possible to deduce that many of these nuns were nobly born women who had divorced their husbands: one such was Cuthburh, sometime queen of Aldfrith, king of Northumbria (<i>d</i>. 705); Hildelith may have been another. Aldhelm's remarks imply that these nobly born women were remarkably well educated in the scriptures and in patristic literature. Another English scholar of the time, Wynfrith (subsequently known as Boniface), described in a letter addressed to Abbess Eadburh the details of a vision of heaven and hell seen by a monk of Much Wenlock, which had been told to him by Abbess Hildelith. Therefore, although little is known of Hildelith's life, it is clear that she enjoyed intimate contact with the outstanding scholars of the time, and may herself be presumed to have achieved a respectable degree of education.<br>
<br>A life of St Hildelith by John Tynemouth (which forms part of his massive <span class="italic">Sanctilogium</span>) is based principally on Bede, and adds nothing to knowledge of the saint's life. John says that she was venerated in the tenth century by Dunstan, &AElig;thelwold, and &AElig;lfheah, but there is no record of such veneration in pre-conquest calendars or litanies of the saints. In some post-conquest liturgical sources (principally from Barking itself) Hildelith's deposition is commemorated on 24 March; the early fifteenth-century ordinal of Barking Abbey gives instructions for the performance of daily offices on this date (as well as on the octave).<br>
