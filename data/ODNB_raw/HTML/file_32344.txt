<span class="headword">Chalmers,  James</span>  (1841&#150;1901), <span class="occ">missionary and explorer</span>, was born at Ardrishaig, Argyll, on 4 August 1841, the son of John Chalmers (1802&#150;1869), a stonemason from Peterhead. His mother, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Glen (1808&#150;1876), came from Luss on Loch Lomond. Brought up in Ardrishaig, Lochgilphead, and Glenaray, with three younger sisters, one of whom was adopted, he was educated at the village schools. Of these the most important was that run by the Scottish Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge in Glenaray under John MacArthur, where Chalmers frequently won prizes. He then went to Inveraray grammar school. He also learnt much from Gilbert Meikle, the young United Presbyterian minister at Inveraray, who encouraged his parishioners' interest in home and overseas missions. A letter from a Fiji missionary read to his Sunday-school class made Chalmers seriously consider becoming a missionary in September 1855, and at about the same time he took up a clerical apprenticeship with the Inveraray lawyers Maclullich and Macniven. During the powerful religious revival of 1859, which swept Argyll in the autumn, Chalmers underwent a religious conversion, and he was formally admitted a member of the United Presbyterian church in the spring of 1860. In November he joined the Glasgow City Mission, to earn money for his further education and ministerial training. Persuaded by Dr George Turner, a well-known missionary from Samoa working for the London Missionary Society (LMS), he applied to that society in February 1862 and was admitted for ministerial instruction to Cheshunt College in Hertfordshire in September.<br>
<br>A boisterous student who found formal learning ever more difficult, Chalmers remained at Cheshunt until June 1864. He then spent a final year acquiring a specific missionary training, chiefly at the LMS's Farquhar House, Highgate, in London, but also at Plumstead, learning the Rarotongan language under the missionary William Gill. In October 1865 he was ordained a Congregationalist minister. He married Jane K. Robertson Hercus (<i>d</i>. 1879), a schoolteacher, on 8 November 1865, and they set sail for the Pacific on 4 January 1866; they finally reached Rarotonga on 20 May 1867, after being shipwrecked on Niue and numerous other mishaps.<br>
<br>Like many volunteers inspired by David Livingstone, Chalmers had once thought of Africa, but from 1871 he was anxious to join the new LMS initiative in New Guinea. First, however, he spent ten years in Rarotonga, most of them in charge of the LMS institution and training Rarotongan agents. Recognizing the revolutionary impact of a European presence and the necessarily gradual penetration of Christian belief, he placed every confidence in his charges and was anxious to build up their independence rapidly in both church and state. &#145;They must act for themselves &hellip; Unless the natives are taught to look after their own Island and prepare for the future they will not be able to resist the pressure of the white faces&#146;, he wrote in his 1874 report  (Hitchen, 26). His methods were often seen as casual and unconventional, for he avoided genteel living and Anglicization, preferring instead the assimilation of missionaries into indigenous conditions of diet or housing where possible; he also encouraged the inculcation of the gospel through the ordinary experiences of everyday life. This attracted criticism from some colleagues devoted to the formalities of &#145;civilized&#146; life in &#145;raising&#146; the islanders, as well as from others who either drew the line at Chalmers's ready enjoyment of whisky or simply feared for his own and his wife's survival. However, many others were devoted admirers of Tamate, as the Rarotongans called him, and his friendships especially with the local people were powerful and lasting.<br>
<br>New Guinea, with its reputedly wild and cannibalistic tribes, had long been the goal of LMS expansion in the Pacific, and Chalmers's offer to go there was finally accepted in December 1875. He left Rarotonga in May 1877, and visited W. G. Lawes in October at Port Moresby before settling himself for two years at Suau Island. Subsequently he lived at Port Moresby for nearly a decade, at Toaripi (1889&#150;92; otherwise Motumotu), Saguane (1896&#150;1900), and for the last months of his life at Daru. In New Guinea, Chalmers felt genuinely fulfilled as a missionary. Perhaps naturally restless, certainly relishing the pioneering aspects of his journeys, and able to satisfy his endless curiosity about new landscapes or peoples, he also believed theologically and practically that the true missionary should be constantly breaking new ground. There was for him no conflict between pioneering as a white person and the European missionary's role. He travelled endlessly, especially by boat, visiting village after village, often as the first European to be seen there. Establishing peaceful contact and fixing on potential stations were the essential complements of training the native agents, who were to be placed as soon as possible. However, this conception of his task, while acceptable to the LMS under Joseph Mullens in the 1870s, became much less so under Ralph Wardlaw Thompson's secretaryship.<br>
<br>Chalmers's contribution to European knowledge of Papua New Guinea is still debated but was undoubtedly considerable. He gathered botanical and geographical information, especially around the Gulf of Papua. His ethnographic work brought a close friendship with the anthropologist A. C. Haddon, which in turn refined both men's investigations. Firsthand information, Chalmers believed, was a vital basis for his missionary strategy. From the mid-1880s he began to publish widely in learned journals such as the proceedings of the Glasgow Philosophical Society and the Royal Geographical Society, as well as with the Religious Tract Society. His first book, <span class="italic">Work and Adventure in New Guinea, 1877&#150;1885</span> (1885), and his <span class="italic">Pioneering in New Guinea</span> (1887), became especially well known. Although preferring English as the language of instruction, he nevertheless translated the synoptic gospels into Motu, which others like Lawes regarded as a potential lingua franca spreading out from Port Moresby.<br>
<br>His aim of &#145;New Guinea for the New Guineans&#146; led him to cultivate good relations with the British naval and consular officials, many of whom became heavily dependent on his influence and advice. Naturally this won &#145;the tyrant missionary&#146; enemies among some of the local traders and their supporters in the Australian press. Visiting Brisbane in 1883 he was active in the movement leading to the British imperial protectorate and to the official ending of Queensland's labour recruiting in New Guinea in 1885. He regretted the intrusion of outsiders while realizing its inevitability, and worked to minimize its impact, being as ready to help gold-diggers as government officials with advice which he believed would reconcile their interests and those of the Papuans.<br>
<br>Chalmers left New Guinea infrequently, visiting New Zealand in 1877 and again briefly after his wife's death in 1879. He hated the work of missionaries on furlough, referring to it in 1884 as &#145;the begging-friar business&#146; with its &#145;telling of excited painted tales &hellip; lying reports, [and] salted statistics&#146;  (Hitchen, 61&#150;2). Nevertheless, his visits to Britain in 1886&#150;7 to publicize New Guinea's needs, and in 1894&#150;5 during the LMS centenary, were regarded as missionary triumphs and made his a household name.<br>
<br>On 6 October 1888 Chalmers married Sarah Elizabeth (Lizzie) Harrison, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Large, old friend of his first wife and recently widowed. Happy enough with him she found the spartan conditions and loneliness during Chalmers's travels hard to bear. In the 1890s Chalmers attended particularly to the remote western districts on the Fly River, hoping to penetrate permanently well inland. He failed. With his energy and health declining, and his wife having died at Saguane, on 25 October 1900, he was forced to move to Daru. Finally, on 8 April 1901, on an expedition to Goaribari Island with the Revd Oliver Tompkins, Chalmers and his party were captured, clubbed, killed, and eaten.<br>
