<span class="headword">Odhran</span> <span class="st"> [St Odhran, Odran, &Oacute;ran]</span>  (<em>supp. </em><em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>563), <span class="occ">holy man and self-sacrifice</span>, lends his name (&Oacute;ran and Odran are alternative Gaelic forms) to a chapel and a graveyard on the island of Iona. The oldest extant version of his story, which resembles one told of St Finnbarr in the thirteenth-century revision of the Latin life of that saint, appears in a Middle Irish homily of the mid-twelfth century. According to this source, Odhran was one of the original companions of Columba. On their arrival on Iona from Ireland <i>c</i>.563, Columba said to his company: &#145;Someone among you should go down into the soil of the island to consecrate it.&#146; Odhran readily volunteered and Columba told him: &#145;No one will be granted his request at my own grave, unless he first seek it of you&#146;  (Herbert, 261). At this, Odhran promptly died. The graveyard on Iona, still called Reilig Odrain (&#145;the grave of Odhran&#146;) in modern times, is likely, therefore, to have been so called already in the mid-twelfth century. The cult of Odhran, which the homily places on a par with that of Columba in terms of its attractiveness to pilgrims, can be traced back much further. In his life of Columba (completed <i>c</i>.697), Adomn&aacute;n relates the story of B&aacute;et&aacute;n, a contemporary of Columba, which he says was told to him by the monk M&aacute;el Odrain, whose name means &#145;devotee of Odhran&#146;. Since, according to his own report, M&aacute;el Odrain was alive and adult very shortly after B&aacute;et&aacute;n's death, his name indicates that Odhran was commemorated in the circle of Iona within a generation of the date of his death given in the twelfth-century story.<br>
<br>The tale of Odhran's death had survived with few changes when Manus O'Donnell assembled his early Modern Irish life of Columba (<span class="italic">Betha Coluim Cille</span>) in 1532. By 1698, however, oral tradition, as recorded by William Sacheverell, told the story in order to explain the name of St Oran's Chapel, a twelfth-century structure which still stands some 100 yards south-west of the present abbey on Iona. Moreover, it was then said that Columba had dreamed that a famine could be ended only if a man were buried alive; that Odhran was so buried, upright, with the promise that his grave would be opened again after twenty-four hours; and that, when he was dug up, the still-living Odhran described the other world with such precision that Columba could trust him no longer in the land of the living and ordered him to be buried again. Eighteenth- and nineteenth-century writers give lines in Gaelic, clearly derived from oral tradition, said to report Odhran's blasphemous utterances on his emergence from his tomb: &#145;There is no wonder in death, and hell is not as it is reported&#146;; and the response of the shocked Columba: &#145;Dust, dust over Odhran's eye, that he may speak no more&#146;  (Adomn&aacute;n, 362).<br>
