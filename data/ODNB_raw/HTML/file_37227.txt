<span class="headword">Brooke,  Henry</span>, Baron Brooke of Cumnor  (1903&#150;1984), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at 40 Wellington Square, Oxford, on 9 April 1903, the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58961/', "(Leonard) Leslie Brooke (1862&#150;1940)")</script>, an artist, who was the author and illustrator of numerous children's books, and his wife, Sybil Diana Brooke (1870&#150;1957), daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32094/', "Revd Stopford Augustus Brooke")</script>. After attending preparatory schools he was educated at Marlborough College and at Balliol College, Oxford (1922&#150;6), where he gained a first in classical moderations (1924) and seconds in mathematical moderations (1924) and <i>literae humaniores</i> and was a tutor in philosophy (1926&#150;7). Encouraged by Alexander Dunlop Lindsay, the master of Balliol, he spent a year (1927&#150;8) working in a Quaker settlement for the unemployed in the Rhondda valley. After spending a year on <span class="italic">The Economist</span> he joined the Conservative Research Department, as a founder member, in 1929 and became its deputy director (1935&#150;7). On 22 April 1933 he married <a href="#cosubject_74600">Barbara Muriel Mathews [<i>see below</i>]</a>; they had two sons and two daughters. She was herself a woman of outstanding political acumen.<br>
<br>Brooke was elected to Hampstead borough council in 1936 and Conservative MP for Lewisham West in a by-election of 1938. On 7 May 1940 he made an ardent defence of Chamberlain in the parliamentary debate that brought Churchill to Downing Street. Following Brooke's defeat at Lewisham in 1945 he was recruited as the last deputy chairman of the Southern Railway Company before nationalization (1946&#150;8). He was a member of the church assembly during the 1940s, the Central Housing Advisory Committee (1944&#150;54), and the court of London University (1947). Following election to London county council in 1945 he served as leader of its Conservative group (1945&#150;51). He was returned as Conservative MP for Hampstead in 1950, but continued to serve on the London county council until 1955 and on Hampstead borough council until 1957.<br>
<br>In 1954 Brooke was appointed to the most influential ministerial post outside the cabinet, financial secretary to the Treasury. &#145;He is a very virtuous and conscientious man though unfortunately no speaker&#146;, the government's economic adviser noted  (Cairncross, 2.95). On the formation of the Macmillan administration in 1957 Brooke was promoted to the cabinet as minister of housing and local government, and as minister for Welsh affairs. It fell to him to implement two pieces of legislation enacted in 1956: the <span class="roman">Clean Air Act</span> and the more contentious <span class="roman">Rent Act</span>. Brooke was transferred in 1961 to the new post of chief secretary to the Treasury (retaining his cabinet status). Public expenditure, the civil service, the universities, and the arts became his responsibilities. To provide him with a salary he was additionally appointed paymaster-general. His hard-working and orthodox character was appreciated in the Treasury, where he helped to prepare some unpopular policies associated with the chancellor of the exchequer, Selwyn Lloyd. By 1962 Harold Evans, the prime minister's public relations adviser, considered him a contender for the premiership: &#145;he is much more human, much less dour and much less metallic than opinion believes&#146;  (Evans, 187).<br>
<br>Macmillan's &#145;night of the long knives&#146; resulted in Brooke's appointment as home secretary in July 1962. Instead of painstaking work with facts, statistics, and long-term treasury strategies he was plunged into deciding urgent and emotive issues at the Home Office. His declared priorities were to confront the crime wave and to reduce prison overcrowding by a new building programme; but his deliberative pragmatism was ill-suited to his new responsibilities. Brooke's twenty-seven months as home secretary proved peculiarly unsuccessful. He was involved in one rumpus after another, and became widely reviled. His difficulties were aggravated by the stubborn and authoritarian temper of the officials who advised him, and he was unlucky that his difficulties at the Home Office coincided with the heyday of the satire boom. He was pilloried in <span class="italic">Private Eye</span> and on the television programme <span class="italic">That Was The Week That Was</span>, which broadcast a biting sketch, on 30 March 1963, &#145;This is your life, Henry Brooke&#146;  (Carpenter, 253).<br>
<br>The first controversy, in July 1962, concerned a deportation order issued against Carmen Bryan, a Jamaican who had been convicted of shoplifting goods valued at &pound;2. Then in August Brooke banned an American Nazi from entering Britain, and was dismayed when the man nevertheless appeared in Gloucestershire. In September came the <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> of Dr Robert Soblen, who had been convicted in the USA of spying for Russia, and who slashed his wrists while on an Israeli airliner that then landed in London. The Home Office resolved to hand him to the Americans, although his offence was not covered by the <span class="roman">Extradition Act</span>. This controversial decision was forestalled by Soblen's fatal overdose of barbiturates, which somehow reached him in prison. In 1963 Brooke's reputation was further damaged by his handling of the case of Anthony Enahoro, a Nigerian chief detained under the <span class="roman">Fugitive Offenders Act</span> of 1881. After five angry parliamentary debates, and bitter criticism that Enahoro had not been granted political asylum, he was returned to Nigeria in May. Meanwhile the hapless Brooke had been further discomfited when the Home Office deported the American comedian Lenny Bruce twice within three days (April 1963).<br>
<br>In March 1963 Brooke met Sir Roger Hollis of MI5 and Sir Joseph Simpson of the Metropolitan Police to discuss rumours surrounding the war minister, John Profumo, whom Brooke's wife later described as &#145;a man who has sinned against our standards&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 Sept 2000). Brooke wished to prevent Profumo's associate Stephen Ward from making disclosures to Labour politicians or journalists, and instigated a wide-ranging police investigation. Ward was arrested on trumpery charges in June and after a show trial committed suicide, like Soblen, with barbiturates.<br>
<br>The state visit of King Paul and Queen Frederica of Greece proved a policing fiasco. After a noisy demonstration (10 July 1963) Brooke fulminated, &#145;The Queen of England has been booed tonight and I am furious&#146;  (Booker, 184). He told his constituents that &#145;a handful of communists, anarchists, beatniks, and members of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament&#146; was destroying Britain's reputation for hospitality. &#145;The demonstrators were shouting &#147;fascist police&#148; at masses of splendid London policemen who had to be taken off their proper work of fighting crime to &hellip; quell their filthy abuse&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 15 July 1963, 7c). In fact, these officers included a mentally ill sergeant from Savile Row police station, Harold Challenor, who planted half a brick on one of those arrested and together with other officers committed perjury to convict demonstrators. Although these improprieties were swiftly revealed, Brooke prevaricated until some of the innocent had endured prison for over a year. It had become evident that he was &#145;in the wrong job &hellip; an almost painfully straightforward man who worries his way ponderously through to his conclusions and then clings to them like grim death&#146;  (Watt, 693). His public statements often sounded dreary or petulant, and on such subjects as the <span class="roman">Commonwealth Immigration Act</span> were thought by some to be misleading. His unimaginative approach was typified by his insistence that the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra was not entitled to its prefix &#145;royal&#146;. He opposed all manner of &#145;sleazy stuff&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 694, 30 April 1964, 605). Accordingly he declined to reform the criminal laws prohibiting homosexuality and prostitution, despite the recommendations of Sir John Wolfenden's committee. &#145;Public opinion is not prepared for a change&#146;, he declared. &#145;At this time, when a growing number of people feel free to do anything not specifically condemned by Act, we should be slow to loosen up&#146;  (Raison). The latter remark was characteristic of his outlook.<br>
<br>To rally support for the Douglas-Home government before the general election of 1964 Brooke set out to prove that the Conservatives &#145;mean what we say about helping the young of our country to grow up straight&#146;  (Brooke to Sir A. Douglas-Home, 18 Feb 1964, TNA: PRO Prem 11/4848). This process began with the <span class="roman">Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act</span> of 1964, whereby the unauthorized possession of amphetamines became a criminal offence. Informed critics condemned the act as hurried and ill-conceived, and indeed it proved counter-productive: the illicit supply of amphetamines flourished, and they became the most common illicitly used stimulant in Britain for the rest of the twentieth century. Brooke's separate <span class="roman">Dangerous Drugs Act</span> of 1964 created a new offence, the cultivation of cannabis, and attempted to target people who permitted cannabis to be consumed on their premises. After drugs Brooke turned to pornography. During June 1964 the Home Office rushed through parliament a new <span class="roman">Obscene Publications Act</span> as well as the <span class="roman">Malicious Damage Act</span>, directed against mods and rockers.<br>
<br>The Conservatives lost the general election of 1964, and Brooke left office. His unpopularity resulted in a massive swing against him in Hampstead. Subsequently, during the general election of 1966, a concerted campaign from within and without the constituency encompassed his defeat. Some months later, in July, he had the consolation of a life peerage. Previously he had been sworn to the privy council (1955) and been made a Companion of Honour (1964). He was a quiet, friendly, honest, and steadfast man, who was regarded by his detractors as a cruel, deceitful ogre. His gentle, affectionate memoir of his father <span class="italic">Leslie Brooke and Johnny Crow</span> (1982) belies the public's view of him. Brooke, who latterly suffered from Parkinson's disease, died on 29 March 1984, at home at the Glebe House, Mildenhall, Wiltshire, and was cremated on 2 April.<br>
<br>Brooke's wife, <a name="cosubject_74600"></a><span class="headword">Barbara Muriel Brooke <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Mathews]</span></span>, Baroness Brooke of Ystradfellte  (1908&#150;2000), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 14 January 1908 at Llan-wern, Monmouthshire, the youngest child in the family of four daughters and one son of the Revd Alfred Augustus Mathews (1864&#150;1946), Anglican clergyman, and his wife, Ethel Frances (<i>d</i>. 1951), daughter of Dr Edward Beynon Evans, of Swansea. She was educated at Queen Anne's School, Caversham, and Gloucester Training College for Domestic Science before teaching in secondary schools. Her marriage, based on shared religious values, was very happy. She was a Hampstead borough councillor from 1948 to 1965, and joint vice-chairman of the Conservative Party Organization from 1954 to 1964, in which post she tried (largely unsuccessfully) to increase the number of women parliamentary candidates. Appointed DBE in 1960 and made a life peer in 1964, in the Lords she was front-bench spokesman on welfare. In 1969 she was elected president of the National Union of Conservative Associations. From 1960 to 1978 she was chairman of the governing body of Godolphin and Latymer School, Hammersmith, and was instrumental in organizing the school's withdrawal from the state sector, in face of the inner London education authority's plans for making it comprehensive in 1977. She was also active on numerous local and national committees. In the 1970s she withdrew from national public life to nurse her husband, but continued active in village affairs at Mildenhall, Wiltshire. She died on 1 September 2000 at Marlborough, Wiltshire, and was survived by her four children. Her elder son, Peter (<i>b</i>. 1934), was a Conservative MP and secretary of state for Northern Ireland (1989&#150;92) and for national heritage (1992&#150;4), while her younger son, Henry (<i>b</i>. 1936), became a lord justice of appeal in 1996, having been knighted in 1988.<br>
