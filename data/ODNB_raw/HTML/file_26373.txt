<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stephen,  James</span>  (1758&#150;1832), <span class="occ">lawyer and slavery abolitionist</span>, was born on 30 June 1758 at Poole, Dorset, the second of seven children of James Stephen (<i>bap</i>. 1733, <i>d</i>. 1779), dealer and conveyancer, and his wife, Sibella (1738&#150;1775), daughter of William Milner. He attended a series of schools, most of them for only brief periods of time on account of his father's indebtedness. In 1773 he was sent to Winchester College, but soon dropped out and returned to the family home at Kennington, London. There he was responsible for nursing his mother in the last stages of tuberculosis. Her death on 21 March 1775 was a profound psychological blow to her son, who religiously commemorated the anniversary of her passing. James now secured his father's permission to study law with the idea that he would practice in St Kitts, the residence of his uncle and godfather. He entered Lincoln's Inn on 23 September 1775 and studied at Marischal College, Aberdeen, for two years, until financial difficulties brought an end to his training. On his return to London he assisted with his father's meagre practice as a conveyancer.<br>
<br>Following his father's death in September 1779, Stephen became a reporter for the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, a position which he was to hold for &#145;little more than a year&#146; (probably from August 1780 to September 1781). His chief task was to report the debates of parliament, but also out of session to review books, plays, and exhibitions, and to cover important trials. He had two memorable assignments: the one to report Lord George Gordon's trial for high treason in February 1781, the other the notorious case of sexual assault in Somerset House involving Lord Edward Onslow in May 1781. Stephen returned to finish his legal education with the assistance of money inherited from his recently deceased uncle. After passing the bar on 26 January 1782 he made no serious effort to practise, but continued his studies and attempted to collect a legal library. On 17 June 1783 he married Anna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stent (<i>bap</i>. 1758, <i>d</i>. 1796), at St Leonard, Shoreditch; they had seven children, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26372/', "Henry John Stephen (1787&#150;1864)")</script>, legal writer, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26374/', "James Stephen (1789&#150;1859)")</script>, civil servant and abolitionist, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26371/', "George Stephen (1794&#150;1879)")</script>, lawyer and abolitionist.<br>
<br>In October 1783 Stephen sailed for St Kitts to be followed by his wife and family, stopping first in Barbados in December. At Bridgetown he witnessed a portion of the trial of four slaves accused and convicted of murder, an event which profoundly altered his life. The manifest injustice of the proceedings, the obvious innocence of the accused, and the knowledge that there was good reason to believe that a white man was the murderer led Stephen to vow never to own a slave and to become a committed opponent of slavery. In the West Indies Stephen made only a modest living. Much of his income came from defending American traders whose cargoes and ships had been seized for violations of the <span class="roman">Navigation Acts</span>. From these cases he seems to have saved enough to manage a trip home to England with his family in the winter of 1788&#150;9. After the outbreak of war with France in 1793, the seizure of neutral ships engaged in trade with the French colonies provided the basis for an enlarged practice, and Stephen was able to afford to return permanently to London in September 1794. He then took up practice in the prize appeal court of the privy council, where he remained until his appointment, on Spencer Perceval's influence, as master in chancery on 20 February 1811, the appointment having been delayed by Lord Chancellor Eldon.<br>
<br>The death of Stephen's wife in December 1796 led to a deepening of his religious convictions. In the following year he moved from Sloane Square to Clapham, where William Wilberforce, Henry Thornton, and several other prominent members of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42140', "Clapham Sect")</script> were resident. It was through this group that Stephen met Wilberforce's sister, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1816), the widow of Thomas Clarke. The couple married on 15 May 1800 and enjoyed a happy relationship. Stephen afterwards referred to his second wife as the &#145;friend of his Soul&#146;, whose frank criticism enabled him to see his faults and correct them. Her death on 18 October 1816 was to leave him deeply grieved.<br>
<br>Although Stephen made his living as a lawyer, his reputation and historical importance are derived from his association with Wilberforce and the Clapham Sect and his distinguished service to the anti-slavery movement. His first known pronouncements on the subject came at a debating society at the Coachmaker's Hall, Foster Lane, London, on 28 October 1779. As he later recorded in his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, the subject of whether slavery &#145;could be defended on principles of humanity and justice&#146; was then new to him. Having carefully prepared his remarks and having been inspired by new anti-slavery arguments which occurred to him while listening to another speaker, Stephen gave &#145;the best and by far the best received&#146; speech of his life to intermittent &#145;thundering bursts of applause&#146;. The audience condemned slavery by an overwhelming majority. He first became involved with Wilberforce while visiting England in 1789 and the two men formed a lasting friendship.<br>
<br>Back on St Kitts, Stephen supplied Wilberforce with information about the slave trade and the conditions of slavery. From 1794 he contributed anti-slavery propaganda to the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, and in 1799 he served as counsel for the Sierra Leone Company, presenting evidence before the House of Lords, in its unsuccessful effort to abolish the slave trade off the coast of that colony. He was elected a member of the London Abolition Committee on 23 May 1804 and worked steadily with that group until the achievement of its goal in 1807. In 1805 he helped to draft an order in council passed by Pitt's government on 15 August to prohibit the importing of slaves into the recently conquered Dutch colony of Guiana. In the following year Stephen provided Lord Grenville with the draft of a bill to abolish the foreign slave trade, which parliament passed and which effectively outlawed over three-quarters of the existing trade. Stephen's memorandum on the pros and cons of introducing a measure to abolish the British slave trade in 1806, in which he recommended an early dissolution of parliament, probably influenced the government to postpone the measure until a dissolution could take place. After the enactment of abolition on 25 March 1807 Stephen helped to organize the African Institution, intended to promote the civilization and trade of Africa and to enforce abolition, and served as one of its vice-presidents.<br>
<br>As the chief advocate and architect of the policy of blockading France, which the British government implemented by orders in council issued in January and November 1807, Stephen became invaluable to the government of the duke of Portland, who secured his election to parliament for the close Irish borough of Tralee on 25 February 1808. In 1812 he changed seats, becoming MP for East Grinstead, Sussex. Acutely aware of his want of a classical education Stephen spoke infrequently in parliament, mainly on issues relating to the anti-slavery movement and religion. As a parliamentary speaker Stephen lacked polish, wit, and humour, and was frequently too vehement in tone. Perhaps his greatest speech, and the only one to be published, came on 6 March 1809, in defence of the government's orders in council. Stephen later admitted that he was mistaken in this policy, which led eventually to war with the United States in 1812. Arguably Stephen's greatest contribution to the anti-slavery movement was his advocacy of slave registration and his drafting of the proposals for registering slaves on the island of Trinidad. This order, as finally passed on 26 March 1812, was later extended to the islands ceded by France at the end of the Napoleonic wars&#151;Mauritius, St Lucia, and Tobago. It also served as a model for the proposed registration of slaves in the older slave colonies.<br>
<br>The failure of Lord Liverpool's government in 1815 to support Wilberforce's <span class="roman">Registration Bill</span> led Stephen to resign his parliamentary seat in protest on 14 April 1815. His resignation freed him to write <span class="italic">The Slavery of the British West India Colonies Delineated</span> (2 vols., 1824, 1830) which gives a comprehensive and detailed picture of the British West Indian slave system in the early nineteenth century, and became the chief textbook for supporters of the anti-slavery movement. In <span class="italic">Crisis of the Sugar Colonies</span> (1802) Stephen had portrayed the financial distress of the older slave colonies and advocated that Trinidad be developed by free rather than slave labour. His most influential pamphlet remains <span class="italic">War in Disguise</span> (1805), which was significant in influencing the government's decision to revive the Rule of 1756, which prevented neutral traders from trading with the enemy when they could not do so legally in peacetime.<br>
<br>Stephen's <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, published in 1954, provide the best source for his life up to the departure for St Kitts, and an insight into his character and religious views. Strongly influenced by his mother he had a powerful sense of divine providence watching over and guiding human affairs, and seems to have relied heavily on private prayer for guidance. According to his son Sir James, Stephen was scarcely orthodox in his religious views, perhaps a Socinian. But his views were unorthodox in other ways as well. At a time when the Church of England did not offer prayers for the dead, he strongly believed in them and apparently had his own doctrine of purgatory. Like other prominent evangelicals, Stephen was an active member of the Church Missionary Society and the Bible Society.<br>
<br>In later years Stephen lived comfortably on the income from his office as master in chancery. From 1819 he maintained a second residence at Missenden, Buckinghamshire, and visited Bath from time to time for his health. In his last public act Stephen presided over a crowded meeting of the Anti-Slavery Society at Exeter Hall on 12 May 1832 and spoke with great effect. He died at Bath on 10 October 1832. Burial followed at Stoke Newington churchyard in a tomb which also contained the remains of his father, mother, two wives, and two daughters who died in infancy.<br>
<br>Described as a &#145;high-minded fanatic&#146; by Henry Adams, a &#145;third-rate debater&#146; by Lord Brougham, and &#145;the most learned, bitter, and extreme of anti-slavery pamphleteers&#146; by W. L. Mathieson, Stephen has until recently been underestimated. His role in the anti-slavery movement is now more justly appreciated by historians than at any time since his death. Thanks to the work of Roger Anstey, R. G. Thorne, and others, we have a much clearer picture of his active involvement in shaping the policy of the anti-slavery movement and his important role in the councils of the London Abolition Committee, the African Institution, and the Anti-Slavery Society.<br>
