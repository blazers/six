</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Volkhovsky, Felix Vadimovich</span>  (1846&#150;1914), <span class="occ">revolutionary and man of letters</span>, was born into a family of impoverished gentry in Poltava, eastern Ukraine, on 6 July 1846 <span class="smallcap">OS</span>, the son of Vadim Volkhovsky and his wife, Yekaterina. After spending his early childhood there and in Novgorod-Volynsk in western Ukraine he attended gymnasia in St Petersburg and Odessa before entering the law faculty of Moscow University in 1863. Serfdom had been abolished two years earlier, the &#145;great reforms&#146; appeared to be continuing, and Nikolay Chernyshevsky's inspirational novel <span class="italic">What is to be Done?</span> had just been published in <span class="italic">The Contemporary</span>. Then in a famous public event of May 1864 Chernyshevsky was condemned to hard labour in Siberia. Volkhovsky wrote an eye-witness account of this &#145;civil execution&#146; and began to move in the same circles as Dmitry Karakozov, whose attempt on the life of the tsar in April 1866 brought the great reforms to an end. Questioned by the authorities in the wake of Karakozov's attempt, he was held only to have run a self-help association for fellow students from his Ukrainian homeland.<br>
<br>Subsequently, however, Volkhovsky was formally arrested on three occasions: in February 1868 for co-founding the Rouble Society (whose purpose was to devote the eponymous monthly subscription to the publication of tracts for the common people); in April 1869 for associating with Sergey Nechaev (the advocate of strong-arm tactics whom Dostoyevsky was to excoriate in <span class="italic">The Devils</span>); and in August 1874 for running a circle in Odessa and Kherson whose members sought to propagandize local peasants and workers. Although he escaped indictment in 1868, after the other arrests he suffered years of preliminary detention in St Petersburg before being tried among Nechaev's associates in 1871 and again in the &#145;trial of the 193&#146; of 1877&#150;8. In 1871 he was acquitted, for he disagreed with Nechaev's advocacy of direct action (and the political trial of 1871 was one of the few in Russian history to be conducted with due attention to the law). In 1878, however, he was sentenced to exile in western Siberia. His hair, by this time, had gone grey, and his hearing had been severely impaired by his experiences in prison. His first wife, Mariya Osipovna Antonova (1848&#150;1877), whom he had married in July 1871, had died in Italy.<br>
<br>Volkhovsky was developing as a man of letters. He had started writing poetry at least as early as 1870 and published a good deal when he was in prison (getting it to the printer through his mother). In 1876 he published in Vienna one of the first socialist pamphlets ever to appear in the Ukrainian language. In May 1878 he drafted (in Russian) the defiant &#145;open letter&#146; that twenty-five of those indicted in the trial of the 193 submitted to the authorities after their conviction. Although in his first place of Siberian exile, Tiukalinsk, he was obliged to work as a sign-writer and house-painter in order to keep body and soul together, he secured permission to move to Tomsk in 1881 and there became heavily involved in the recently founded <span class="italic">Siberian Newspaper</span>. When the American investigator George Kennan visited Tomsk in 1885 and 1886 he helped him gather material for what was to become, in 1891, <span class="italic">Siberia and the Exile System</span>, one of the greatest of all indictments of the tsarist regime. In Tomsk he also edited a substantial collection of poetry under the title <span class="italic">Echoes of Siberia</span> (1889). But the authorities closed the <span class="italic">Siberian Newspaper</span>; his second wife, Aleksandra Khorzhevskaya (a fellow revolutionary whom he had married in Tiukalinsk) shot herself in December 1887; and his three-year-old daughter, Katia, died of pneumonia in early 1889. To find work he moved east, first to Irkutsk and then, after further harassment by the authorities, to Chita and Troitskosavsk.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1889 he made a bid for freedom, leaving Vera, his eight-year-old daughter, in Irkutsk and travelling surreptitiously to Russia's Pacific seaboard. After throwing himself on the mercy of British sea-captains at Vladivostok and Yokohama he reached Vancouver and wrote to George Kennan. The two men renewed their friendship. In July 1890 he moved on from North America to London, where the Newcastle lawyer Robert Spence Watson and the Russian <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;</i> Sergey Stepniak had just founded the Society of Friends of Russian Freedom and the periodical <span class="italic">Free Russia</span>. With help from Kennan and a family of Russian musicians he arranged for Vera to make her way from Irkutsk to London by the western rather than the eastern route (disguised as a boy to get across Russia's European frontier).<br>
<br>Thus the stage was set for Volkhovsky's British phase. It began in a blaze of publicity, for the story of his escape from Siberia was reported at length in <span class="italic">The Times</span> and his inside knowledge of Russian prisons was grist to the mill of both the country's leading newspaper and a number of British periodicals. Because of the foundation of the Society of Friends of Russian Freedom and the publication of Kennan's book on tsarist malfeasance in Siberia, the deficiencies of Russia's political system were receiving particularly extensive scrutiny in Britain at the time of Volkhovsky's arrival. He had started lecturing on his Russian experiences almost as soon as he arrived in Canada. In England he spoke throughout the country. In Newcastle, for example, he told a &#145;splendid audience&#146; at the Grand Assembly Rooms in February 1891 that in solitary confinement in St Petersburg he had almost forgotten how to speak and had struggled to retain his sanity  (<span class="italic">Newcastle Daily Leader</span>, 26 Feb 1891). Shortly afterwards he spoke &#145;for the first time in London before a purely Socialist audience, at William Morris's Socialist Club, Hammersmith&#146;  (<span class="italic">Free Russia</span>, May 1891). Such appearances remained part of his life until his health gave way for good.<br>
<br>As his deafness intensified Volkhovsky devoted more time to writing and editing. He served as a sub-editor and later the editor of <span class="italic">Free Russia</span>; he was a prime mover in the foundation, at the end of 1891, of the Russian Free Press Fund; between 1893 and 1899 he edited the forty-six issues of the fund's Russian-language &#145;flysheets&#146;; and he published <span class="italic">A China Cup and Other Stories for Children</span> (1891), letters to the press (such as those in his exchange with Vera Zasulich in <span class="italic">Labour Leader</span> and <span class="italic">Justice</span> in August and September 1896), and political essays such as the Russian-language <span class="italic">What the Constitution of Loris-Melikov Teaches</span> (1894) and the English-language &#145;Claims of the Russian liberals&#146; (in Sergius Stepniak, <span class="italic">Nihilism as it Is</span>, 1894). Perhaps his greatest single contribution to the promotion of Russian culture in England was inspiring Constance Garnett to learn Russian, a decision that led to her translations of most of the Russian classics.<br>
<br>He also excelled as an organizer. It was to his flat in Shepherd's Bush that the leader of the Russian exiles in London, Sergey Stepniak, was going for a key meeting when he was knocked down by a train in December 1895. Meetings at his various places of residence were to be still more important to Russian <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</i> when they no longer had Stepniak to lead them. When, for example, Vladimir Burtsev was arrested on the steps of the British Museum in December 1897 and charged with incitement to murder, it was from Volkhovsky's address, 176 Lancaster Road, Notting Hill, that the Russian exiles initiated his defence (via Spence Watson in Newcastle and, in due course, the leading barrister Lord Coleridge).<br>
<br>Despite the many difficulties of his life in London&#151;poverty, the unexpected death of Stepniak, the need constantly to watch out for tsarist agents (for Rachkovsky, the head of the Paris office of the Russian secret police, was hand in glove with Chief Inspector Melville of the special branch in London)&#151;Volkhovsky remained true to the principles he had adopted in the 1860s. He did not embrace terrorism and he was reluctant to cheapen himself even in debate. When, for example, he could have vilified the tsarist government in <span class="italic">Free Russia</span> in 1900 for criticizing British conduct in the South African War, he refused to do so on the grounds that supporting Britain in this instance meant supporting military intervention on the part of one country in the internal affairs of another. He wanted Russians to gain their freedom from the tsar, but not with the military assistance of foreigners. All he asked the British to do was &#145;to show active sympathy with the Russian aspirants to Freedom by materially and morally supporting the victims of tyranny, by educating public opinion, and, if possible, by preventing the British Government from taking any step which might be a support to the Russian official system&#146;  (letter to Spence Watson, 4 Jan 1900, Spence Watson papers).<br>
<br>At the beginning of the twentieth century Volkhovsky began to write for Russia's new Socialist Revolutionary Party and to spend significant periods of time with the party's <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;</i> leaders in Switzerland. He found the &#145;flattering comments&#146; which certain Socialist Revolutionaries made on his work in 1909 &#145;a great encouragement to a man who is doing his work <i>outside Russia</i> and thus is always afraid of losing touch with the real needs of the moment&#146;  (letter to Spence Watson, 4 June 1909, original emphasis). He was still in touch with the &#145;needs of the moment&#146; when he died, at his current residence, 30 Arundel Mansions in the Fulham Road in London, on Sunday 2 August 1914. He was cremated at Golders Green three days later in a non-religious ceremony that included addresses by both Prince Kropotkin and H. M. Hyndman. Viktor Chernov, the leader of Russia's Socialist Revolutionary Party, was surely right to identify indomitability as the keynote of his character.<br>
<br>Volkhovsky's daughter Vera studied at Somerville College, Oxford, between 1901 and 1903, worked for a time as a gym mistress in Cardiff, fell in love with Bertrand Russell, adopted a boy and a girl in Russia when living there in 1923&#150;4, and died in 1966. His papers sold for &pound;3291 at Sothebys in 1969.<br>
