<span class="headword">Pierson,  Henry Hugo</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Henry Hugh Pearson]</span>  (1815&#150;1873), <span class="occ">composer</span>, born at Oxford on 12 April 1815, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21715/', "Hugh Nicholas Pearson (1776&#150;1856)")</script>, then vicar of St Helen's, Abingdon, and later dean of Salisbury, and his wife, Sarah Maria (1781&#150;1858), the daughter of Charles and Sarah Ann Elliott of Clapham, Surrey. His brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14798/', "William Henley Pearson-Jervis")</script>, Charles Buchanan Pearson, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21714/', "Hugh Pearson")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21715/', "Pearson, Hugh Nicholas")</script>]. Until the age of sixteen he was educated at Harrow School, where he won the governor's prize for Latin hexameters. Shortly afterwards he studied medicine in London for two years. Despite his father's objection to a musical career he studied with Arthur Thomas Corfe (organist of Salisbury Cathedral), Thomas Walmisley, and Mozart's pupil Thomas Attwood. In 1836 he matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where his first published works, <span class="italic">Thoughts of Melody</span> (1839) and five <span class="italic">Characteristic Songs of Shelley</span> (1840), were apparently composed.<br>
<br>In 1839, after leaving Cambridge without a degree, Pearson went to Paris and then to Germany. In Leipzig he became acquainted with Mendelssohn and Schumann, and when he moved to Dresden early in 1841 he asked Mendelssohn for a letter of introduction to the Dresden Hofkapellmeister C. G. Reissiger, with whom he continued his musical studies. His overture to Schiller's <span class="italic">Maria Stuart</span> was successfully performed in Dresden. About this time he also received musical tuition from J. C. H. Rinck in Darmstadt and V. J. K. Tom&aacute;&#353;ek in Prague. In 1842 his six lieder (Burns, trans. Freiligrath), op. 7, were favourably reviewed by Schumann in the <span class="italic">Neue Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Musik</span> and by Lewinsky in the <span class="italic">Allgemeine Wiener Musik-Zeitung</span>. In July of that year he joined Shelley's widow, Mary, on a trip to Italy, during which she found him a troublesome companion. About this time he met the poet J. P. Lyser, with whose wife, Caroline (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Leonhardt), he soon became emotionally involved. He was in Vienna by late autumn 1842, and in March 1843 contributed an article, &#145;Deutsche Oratorienmusik in England&#146;, signed Henry Hugh Pearson, to the <span class="italic">Allgemeine Wiener Musik-Zeitung</span> (3, 1843, 121&#150;3). The issue of 22 April began with a short biographical article on him, which commented that, unlike W. S. Bennett, who had chosen Mendelssohn for his model, Pearson &#145;belongs wholly to the new-romantic school, in the best sense of the word&#146;  (<span class="italic">Allgemeine Wiener Musik-Zeitung</span>, 3, 1843, 197); it also remarked that, if he wanted, he &#145;could certainly have a great reputation as an organist&#146;  (ibid.), and mentioned that he had written a book on German musical life and activities, which seems, however, not to have been published. His later literary work included an edition of Schumann's <span class="italic">Musikalische Haus- und Lebens-Regeln</span> (1850) and an edition and translation of Beethoven's <span class="italic">Studies in Thorough-Bass</span> (1853).<br>
<br>Back in Dresden, Pearson wrote to Mendelssohn on 2 April 1844:<blockquote>I have been wandering about the Continent having staid some months in Italy (Venice &amp; Florence in particular) &amp; still longer at Vienna&#151;&amp; now I find it is nearly time to think of returning to old England &hellip; [Prince Albert] has been pleased to express his (sublime) admiration for some compositions of mine which were presented to him &hellip; Can you then be so kind as to write me a few lines intimating, that you consider me qualified to teach the science of composition, &amp; perhaps to direct the studies of others, in case they were committed to me? (Bodl. Oxf., MS M.D.M. d.39, xiii, 90)</blockquote>The new-romantic tendencies attributed to Pearson were rather those of Spohr, as his article of March 1843 implies, than of Wagner, with whose music he was scarcely in sympathy at that time, for in the same letter to Mendelssohn he observed, referring to Mendelssohn's <span class="italic">Antigone</span>, &#145;I do not know whether the Dresden taste will appreciate it seeing that Wagner has deteriorated it (the general taste) fearfully by his drum-trumpet-&amp;-thunder operas&#146;  (ibid.). Shortly after this he applied for the vacant Reid professorship of music at Edinburgh University, in succession to Sir Henry Bishop, and he wrote again to Mendelssohn on 13 April 1844:<blockquote>my principal opponent is <i>W. S. Bennett</i>, who is generally supposed to be a sort of prot&eacute;g&eacute; of yours &hellip; I think it is probable that you may exert your very great influence in his favour, &amp; I write to inform you that I am also a candidate for the place, in order that everything may be &#145;fair and above board&#146; as the sailors say&#151;. (Bodl. Oxf., MS M.D.M. d.45, xix, 201)</blockquote>However, he went on, ill-advisedly, to disparage Bennett. Mendelssohn's reaction is preserved in the draft of a letter to Professor Robert Jameson in Edinburgh in which he wrote (in English): &#145;he spoke in such a tone of Bennett, &amp; his character as well as his talents, that I did not chose to return any answer to his letter&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS M.D.M. d.45, xix, 225). Nevertheless, Pearson was the successful candidate, and was appointed on 1 June 1844. His tenure of the chair was short-lived; after eight months he returned to Germany and married Caroline Lyser (1811&#150;1899), who had by then obtained a divorce, and they settled in Vienna.<br>
<br>On 7 May 1845 Pearson's opera <span class="italic">Die Elfensiege</span>, to his wife's libretto, was given its premi&egrave;re at Br&uuml;nn (Brno), but, apparently in deference to his father's objections to the family name being associated with opera, he assumed the pseudonym Edgar Mannsfeldt (from his wife's family) for the publication of a piano arrangement of the overture and for other works that appeared at about this time. Pearson and his circle in Vienna seem to have created a deliberate cloud of obfuscation about Mannsfeldt's true identity, which resulted in a series of acrimonious exchanges in the press. In 1847 he moved to Hamburg, where on 22 February the following year his opera <span class="italic">Lelia</span>, with a libretto by his wife, based on her <span class="italic">Schneewitchen</span>, was produced and favourably reviewed. During these years Pearson was a controversial figure; a review of <span class="italic">Lelia</span> in 1848 referred to him as &#145;persecuted by opponents&#146;, and observed:<blockquote>In a few years Mannsfeldt will have obtained a considerable reputation for himself by main force, for he is not personally liked, since most people cannot accept his withdrawn, inward-looking nature and his manner of holding people at a distance. (<span class="italic">Wiener Allgemeine Musik-Zeitung</span>, 8, 1848, 163&#150;4)</blockquote>During the 1840s, and for the rest of his life, Pearson made a distinguished contribution to the literature of nineteenth-century song. He composed many pieces with German texts, though he continued to set verses by British authors in translation, and often included alternative English and German words. In 1852 he attempted to gain attention in his own country with the oratorio <span class="italic">Jerusalem</span>, performed at the Norwich festival. The work was stigmatized as a product of the &#145;New German School&#146; and violently attacked by many in the press, though G. A. Macfarren wrote a more balanced review in the <span class="italic">Musical Times</span> (27, 1852, 568). The oratorio was repeated in London the following year and at W&uuml;rzburg in 1862. Shortly after the Norwich d&eacute;b&acirc;cle, which Pearson deeply resented, he formally adopted the German spelling of his family name, which he had used informally since at least 1843. In 1854 he composed one of his finest large-scale works, the incidental music to part 2 of Goethe's <span class="italic">Faust</span>. This was given its premi&egrave;re in Hamburg and gained significant recognition on the continent. A selection from it was given at Norwich in 1857. During the 1850s Pierson spent time in Mainz and Frankfurt before settling in W&uuml;rzburg in 1857; then in 1863 he moved to Stuttgart, where in summer 1867 Hubert Parry studied with him briefly. Among his larger works published at that time was an overture, <span class="italic">Die Jungfrau von Orleans</span> (1867).<br>
<br>In 1869 Pierson made a final effort to win recognition in England. He presided at the organ in a performance at the Norwich festival of parts of his oratorio <span class="italic">Hezekiah</span>, which, like <span class="italic">Jerusalem</span>, was savaged by the critics; he never completed <span class="italic">Hezekiah</span>. The English musical press, especially the <span class="italic">Musical Standard</span>, contained many contributions both for and against Pierson at about this time. In April 1872 his opera <span class="italic">Contarini</span>, substantially composed almost twenty years earlier, was given its premi&egrave;re at Hamburg after a production in Paris had been aborted by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. This opera was revived as <span class="italic">Fenice</span> in 1883. Pierson died of a heart attack on 28 January 1873 in Leipzig, <i>en route</i> from Hamburg to Stuttgart, and his body was returned to his family for burial at Sonning, Berkshire. Some years after his death a number of his orchestral works, including <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, and <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, were given at the Crystal Palace concerts in London; but, apart from the glee &#145;Ye Mariners of England&#146;, his works were largely neglected in his native land and, according to his brother Hugh's article on him in the first edition of Grove's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Music and Musicians</span>, a vast quantity of his music remained in manuscript.<br>
