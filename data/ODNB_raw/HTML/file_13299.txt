<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hill, Sir  Rowland</span>  (1795&#150;1879), <span class="occ">postal reformer and civil servant</span>, was born on 3 December 1795 at 96 Blackwell Street, Kidderminster, third of the eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13313/', "Thomas Wright Hill (1763&#150;1851)")</script>, schoolmaster, and his wife, Sarah Lea (1765&#150;1842).<h2>
<a name="Earlylife"></a>Early life</h2>The Hill family, buffeted at times by economic adversity, was exceptionally close and indeed operated as a well-ordered regiment in pursuit of the group's self-advancement and in support of its belief in liberal causes, reform, and earnest improvement. For the Hills, progressive education was one great means through which these goals might be achieved. About 1803 Rowland entered Hill Top, his father's school in a Birmingham suburb, where despite the effects of scarlet fever which permanently weakened his health he developed his skills as a budding mathematician and mechanical engineer. At the age of twelve he became an assistant to his father, and in 1819 he helped his family to establish Hazelwood, a new school in Edgbaston. There the Hills assiduously implemented an innovative educational policy based on the ideals of representative democracy and competitive capitalism, not unlike the approach of Jeremy Bentham's <span class="italic">Chrestomathia</span>. On 27 September 1827 Hill married Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1881), daughter of Joseph Pearson, a Wolverhampton manufacturer and county magistrate; they had one son and three daughters. In the same year as his marriage, with the aid of three of his brothers he extended the family's experiments in education by opening the Bruce Castle School in Tottenham, Middlesex.<br>
<br>However, Hill grew increasingly frustrated in his role as a schoolmaster. He was not, after all, the great intellectual of the family. That role was played by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13286/', "Matthew Davenport Hill")</script>, the eldest brother. Furthermore, having abandoned any religious belief Hill was troubled by the fact that he had to take his pupils to church services and lead them in prayers. It is not surprising, then, that he began to look for other avenues to social progress and personal advancement. He considered an offer from the social reformer Robert Owen to manage one of his experiments in communal living, but rejected it. For a time part of his considerable energy was expended on work on a series of inventions and ideas, such as a rotary printing press, a scheme for pneumatic dispatch of messages, and road-building machinery. He also became involved in campaigns for colonizing South Australia, having produced in 1832 a paper on the subject with the characteristic title <span class="italic">Home colonies: a plan for the gradual extinction (by education) of pauperism and the diminution of crime</span>. By 1835 this activity bore fruit in Hill's appointment as secretary to the South Australian colonization commission, a government post which paid &pound;500 a year and which allowed Hill to turn over the management of the Bruce Castle School to his younger brother Arthur.<h2>
<a name="Postalreform"></a>Postal reform</h2>It was another issue which was to be the great cause of Hill's life, however. In January 1837 Hill published the first edition of <span class="italic">Post Office Reform: its Importance and Practicability</span>, after submitting the gist of his proposals privately to Lord Melbourne's government. In this pamphlet Hill undertook two tasks simultaneously. The first was to attack the current postal system as overly complicated, usually requiring the recipient of a letter to pay for postage based on the number of sheets the letter contained and the distance it had been conveyed. Under this system a letter of a single sheet sent from London to Birmingham cost as much as 9<i>d</i>. Matters were made worse by the fact that London was served by three separate delivery systems. Thus a Londoner might receive mail from three different letter-carriers. Elsewhere it was usually the case that mail had to be collected from local post offices and posted not, as later, in roadside boxes, but at the same local post offices or in &#145;receiving&#146; houses. Hill insisted that this unwieldy arrangement unfairly taxed the public and inhibited the expansion of trade and ideas. Hill's second goal in writing this pamphlet was to propose an alternative system of a standard prepayment for letters conveyed between principal towns and cities, regardless of the specific distance involved. Hill would later modify and improve details of this scheme, most importantly suggesting the use of stamps as one method of prepayment. However, his fundamental approach first presented in <span class="italic">Post Office Reform</span> remained unchanged for the rest of his life.<h2>
<a name="Pennypost"></a>Penny post</h2>When Hill put forth these proposals in 1837 he was a relatively obscure individual approaching middle age. By 10 January 1840&#151;the inauguration of penny post through which a letter of &frac12; oz might be sent anywhere in the country for 1<i>d</i>.&#151;he had become a nationally known figure whose ideas had become government policy and who was poised for a significant career in the Victorian civil service. How had the transformation come about? Due credit should be given to Hill, who was tireless in promoting his scheme and in organizing support among the public in general and the commercial and banking community in particular. However, it should be remembered that Hill was not the lonely crusader, single-handedly opposing myopic supporters of outmoded assumptions and practices, which some accounts of his life, and indeed at times his own rhetoric, might suggest. The Post Office had already been the object of criticism from men such as Robert Wallace, MP for Greenock, who in 1833 launched an effective reform campaign. Hill's campaign also benefited from the support of like-minded individuals such as Henry Cole and Edwin Chadwick. Hence the success of Hill's attack on the Post Office is partly explained by the fact that it was only one aspect of a wider utilitarian assault on existing institutions, which characterized the post-<span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> generation and which called for a sweeping review of current procedures and advocated changes based on principles of rationality and political economy.<br>
<br>Hill was convinced that his proposals for Post Office improvement required his direct supervision and involvement if their implementation was to be successful, and from 1839 to 1842 he was attached to the Treasury at an annual salary of &pound;1500 to carry out this assignment. Dismissed by the Peel government in September 1842 he was employed from 1843 to 1846 as first a director and then chairman of the London and Brighton Railway Company; however, he remained dedicated to the engine of reform and to driving that engine, and Peel's fall from office in 1846 was a welcome event which facilitated Hill's entry into the Post Office as secretary to the postmaster-general. In this position Hill was somewhat awkwardly inserted into the Post Office to serve as an arm of the department's political chief and a representative of the Treasury. The senior permanent official and the linchpin of the administrative structure remained the secretary to the Post Office. Nevertheless, problems and frustrations persisted. Although the penny post had stimulated a significant increase in the number of letters mailed&#151;19 per capita in 1860 versus 3 per capita in 1839&#151;Hill's projections of the impact of penny post on departmental finances proved inaccurate. He had predicted that gross departmental revenue would return to its pre-penny post level within five years. This prediction was not fulfilled until 1851. More seriously, during the first year the penny post net revenue fell by 69 per cent, and it was not until 1873 that the department was able to maintain consistently the &pound;1.6 million figure earned the year before the implementation of Hill's reforms.<h2>
<a name="Economicsofmaildelivery"></a>Economics of mail delivery</h2>Hill offered several explanations for this unexpected outcome. At times he attributed the blame to what he regarded as excessively costly railway contracts made after 1840 in the era of the decline of coaching companies. (One Post Office estimate held that railway conveyance of mail was almost four times as costly as conveyance by coach. Such estimates, of course, failed to take into consideration the improved speed of conveyance or the greater capacity of the railways to handle the weight of mails, which was three times larger after penny post.) Incensed by the situation Hill recommended that government loans to railway companies be contingent on their lowering their charges for the carriage of mail. In 1867 he carried the attack one step further by advocating nationalization of the railway industry as a way to escape from the imbroglio and to destroy the independence of the railway interest. He also attempted to account for the shortcomings of his reforms by claiming that both the efficiency of the Post Office and the effectiveness of his plans were severely diminished by the fact that a politician, the postmaster-general, headed the department. To Hill, such men&#151;relics of the old corruption&#151;simply lacked the necessary commitment and expertise for the task at hand. In a statement which reveals much about his view of the Post Office hierarchy and the crucial centrality of his place in that same hierarchy, he once lamented in his journal that &#145;The P.M.G. has &hellip; interfered with my department&#146;  (Perry, 8). Instead Hill favoured an arrangement whereby the Post Office would be managed by a board with himself as chairman.<br>
<br>Hill's real wrath was reserved for a group of permanent civil servants inside the bureaucracy, who had entered the Post Office before his arrival, and who, Hill claimed, intentionally frustrated improvements. The leader of this group was Colonel William Maberly, who had been secretary to the Post Office since 1836 and who remained sceptical as to the practicality of penny post. After a bitter power struggle Hill seemingly emerged triumphant in 1854 when his old enemy Maberly resigned, and Hill succeeded him in that important position at an annual salary of &pound;2000. Unfortunately for Hill a number of other opponents, including Anthony Trollope, John Tilley, and Frank Ives Scudamore, remained in their departmental positions. To counterbalance their influence, Hill relied on several relatives, including his brothers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13272/', "Edwin Hill")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54053/', "Frederic Hill")</script> and his only son, Pearson, who had been installed in Post Office jobs.<h2>
<a name="Personalityandfame"></a>Personality and fame</h2>What Hill never realized was that the reasons for the failure of postal reform to achieve all the results he so ardently desired lay elsewhere. As Daunton has convincingly demonstrated, Hill's analysis of the economics of mail conveyance was fundamentally flawed. Hill had overestimated the elasticity of demand for mail services and underestimated the staff size required to operate the system. The irony is that some of his opponents, such as Maberly, had a much more accurate view of the complexities of postal finance than Hill did. Moreover, Hill and his family failed to recognize the reality that despite his effectiveness as an outside critic of departmental weaknesses and adherence to the <i>status quo</i>, Hill was not temperamentally suited to manage a complex bureaucracy from the inside. Autocratic and prone to be suspicious, he never achieved any critical detachment from his obsessive belief that postal reform constituted the great cause of modern life and that everyone should adopt that same belief. (When Hill met Garibaldi at a banquet in 1864, the only topic he wished to pursue was the state of the Italian post office.)<br>
<br>Hill's dogmatic approach to issues, viewing all questions according to a rigid standard of his own making, was not well suited to a department which came into more frequent contact with the public than any other government agency and which faced issues that were often less than clear-cut. For example, as a committed advocate of free trade, Hill questioned the virtue of the Post Office's monopoly of mail conveyance. Yet one result of the monopoly was that it provided a certain level of service for the entire country. Similarly, Hill was adamantly opposed to &#145;cross-subsidies&#146;, the practice of using profits earned in one area of the Post Office's operations to cover losses incurred elsewhere. To Hill such a practice constituted an inequitable tax on the nation at large to the benefit of smaller interest groups or particular communities. Instead every aspect of the department's operations should be self-supporting. Yet this assumption ignored the fact that there were some areas of the Post Office's responsibilities, the overseas carriage of mails being an obvious case, where simply relying on market forces to ensure low contract costs, equally low postage rates, and a healthy profit would, if adopted, not work.<br>
<br>These outlooks also shaped Hill's ambivalent attitude toward questions of Post Office expansion into areas beyond simply the conveyance of letters. Although in principle he supported both a parcel post and the establishment of Post Office Savings Banks, he was not an enthusiastic advocate of either idea. With regard to the former he believed that the public would regard a parcel post as unjustifiably interfering with private enterprise. The parcel post was not established until 1883, long after Hill's departure from the department. With regard to the latter Hill envisaged that Post Office Savings Banks should operate on charges based on those of the money-order system in order that a suitable surplus might be attained. If this approach had been followed by those who actively campaigned for the establishment of departmental savings banks, namely Scudamore and George Chetwynd, the system's ultimate usefulness would have been severely limited, and it is worth noting that aside from the penny post very few of the changes associated with the remarkable expansion of the nineteenth-century Post Office were advanced by Hill.<br>
<br>These shortcomings did not prevent Hill from becoming quite literally a Victorian icon (statues of him were erected at Kidderminster, Birmingham, and at the Royal Exchange in London). His dedication and hard work at the Post Office and an effective public relations campaign had established his reputation as a major public figure. According to W. E. Gladstone, Sir Rowland Hill's great reform &#145;had run like wildfire through the civilised world; never perhaps was a local invention (for such it was) and improvement applied in the lifetime of its author to the advantages of such vast multitudes of his fellow-creatures&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). To John Stuart Mill, for example, Hill's reforms symbolized the benefits which were made possible through what Mill termed &#145;popular government&#146;. Hill reaped the rewards of this fame, including fellowship of the Royal Society in 1857, a knighthood in 1860, an honorary degree of DCL from Oxford University in 1864, and the first Albert gold medal given by the Society of Arts.<h2>
<a name="Retirementanddeath"></a>Retirement and death</h2>In 1864 Hill was forced to retire as a consequence of ill health, exacerbated by stress resulting from bitter policy disagreements over salary and promotion issues with Lord Stanley of Alderley, the postmaster-general, and an unsuccessful attempt to appeal over Stanley's head to Lord Palmerston the prime minister, who perceptively described Hill as the &#145;spoilt child of the Post Office&#146;  (H. Parris, <span class="italic">Constitutional Bureaucracy</span>, 1969, 129). None the less, honours continued to be heaped on Hill, including a &pound;20,000 parliamentary grant and the freedom of the City of London in 1879. After serving on the royal commission on railways in 1865&#150;7 Hill spent much of his retirement working on a history of the penny post and his memoirs, the latter published posthumously in 1880 with the aid of G. Birkbeck Hill. Sir Rowland Hill died on 27 August 1879 at Bertram House, his home in Hampstead in north London. Venerated in death as in life, he was buried in Westminster Abbey on 4 September.<br>
