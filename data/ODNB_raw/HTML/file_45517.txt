<span class="headword">Busk <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Blair]</span>,  Mary Margaret</span>  (1779&#150;1863), <span class="occ">writer and translator</span>, was born at Portland Place, London, in 1779, the daughter of Alexander Blair (1737&#150;1815/16), a wealthy nonconformist soap manufacturer and timber trade merchant from Birmingham, and his wife, Mary Johnson (1749&#150;1827). Her father, a proprietor of the Royal Institution, numbered among his friends the distinguished members of the Birmingham Lunar Society, and possessed homes in Staffordshire near his businesses and in Portland Place, where his wife was a society hostess. Mary Margaret married William Busk (1769&#150;1849), a barrister of the Temple (and later a member of parliament), at Beaconsfield on 2 August 1796. They lived in London, though they travelled frequently and at length on the continent, where Mrs Busk became very proficient in German, French, Spanish, and Italian. Their one child, a daughter, died in infancy in 1801.<br>
<br>By 1819 William Busk's financial position became difficult, due to election expenses and loans to family members, and his wife began to write for publication. Mary Busk's younger brother, Alexander Blair (one of twins), was an intimate college friend of the Scottish writer John Wilson, and it was through this connection that in the mid-1820s she became one of the very few women contributors to the early volumes of <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span>, beginning with an essay on Schiller in 1825, and running to thirty-two articles by 1838. At her best, as in &#145;Modern German school of irony&#146; (September 1835), she unfolds for the British public the genealogy of German idealist thought. During these years her reviews of continental works also regularly appeared in the <span class="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</span> and the weekly <span class="italic">Athenaeum</span>. While most women reviewers assumed either a genderless or male stance, Busk's reviews create &#145;complex personae&#146; in which the voices are &#145;so ironically self-conscious that we sense underlying mockery and deliberate confusion of gender&#146;  (Curran, 10) <br>
<br>Busk's first books, however, were two didactic works of fiction: <span class="italic">Zeal and Experience: a Tale</span> (1819) and the better-known <span class="italic">Tales of Fault and Feeling</span> (1825). A more congenial venue for her work appeared in the late 1820s, with the founding of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. Busk's insatiable reading in history and knowledge of languages allowed her to diffuse <span class="italic">A history of Spain and Portugal from <span class="smallcap">B.C.</span> 1000 to <span class="smallcap">A.D.</span> 1814</span> (1833), and translations of such works as Philip Siebold's <span class="italic">Manners and Customs of the Japanese</span> (1841). Her work as a historian culminated in the four extraordinarily detailed volumes of <span class="italic">Mediaeval popes, emperors, kings, and crusaders, or, Germany, Italy, and Palestine, from <span class="smallcap">A.D.</span> 1125 to <span class="smallcap">A.D.</span> 1268</span> (1854&#150;6).<br>
<br>In 1836 William Busk's business affairs became embarrassed, perhaps due to his gambling, and the couple may have legally separated to protect her income. Mrs Busk cancelled plans to publish a collection of poems and plays with Blackwood and instead successfully brought out the work by subscription. The two volumes of <span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span> (1837) have been remembered for &#145;Sordello&#146;, a narrative in tetrameter couplets that caused the young Robert Browning to rewrite his own long poem on the troubadour and delay publication of his <span class="italic">Sordello</span> until 1840. Afterwards William lived chiefly on the continent, and Mary Margaret took London lodgings for part of the year when she was not with him. When he died in Hamburg in 1849, she returned to a house in Queen Anne Street, London, though after seeing <span class="italic">Mediaeval Popes</span> through the press she published little. A lifelong asthmatic, she died at home on 11 January 1863. Along with London contemporaries such as Sarah Austin, Mary Margaret Busk served as an intermediary between intellectuals on the continent and in Britain, through both review essays and translations, and helped broaden the cultural climate after the end of the Napoleonic wars.<br>
