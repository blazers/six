<span class="headword">Rainolds <span class="st"> [Reynolds]</span>,  William</span>  (1544?&#150;1594), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and author</span>, was born at Pinhoe, Devon, the second son of Richard Rainolds, farmer, and elder brother of the puritan theologian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23029/', "John Rainolds")</script>. In 1555 Rainolds was admitted to Winchester College, after which he proceeded to New College, Oxford, where he held a fellowship between 1560 and 1572. During Elizabeth I's visit to Oxford in 1566 he was one of the members of the university to mark the occasion with learned poems. He received his BA on 17 June 1563 and his MA on 4 June 1567. Subsequently he became rector of Lavenham, Suffolk.<br>
<br>There is a romantic story about Rainolds's conversion to Catholicism in Fuller's <span class="italic">Church History</span>: the protestant Rainolds and his Catholic brother John were both so successful in their attempts to convert one another that they both changed their faith. The truth is probably rather more prosaic: John Pits states in his <span class="italic">De illustribus Angliae scriptoribus</span> that William Rainolds's conversion was due to the influence of the famous controversy between Thomas Harding and John Jewel. However, Fuller's account neatly characterizes the complicated intellectual, theological, and moral choices that faced men at Oxford in the 1560s. In 1572 Rainolds resigned his fellowship and went to live in Hart Hall. In 1575 he made a public recantation at Rome and was received into the Catholic church. On 16 August 1577 he arrived at the English College, Douai. In 1578 and 1579 there were journeys to Rheims (the new location of the English College), Louvain, and Paris. On 31 March 1580 he was ordained priest at Ch&acirc;lons.<br>
<br>William Allen, the president of the English College at Rheims, appointed Rainolds professor of scriptures and Hebrew and on 11 April 1581 he started to lecture on the epistles of St Paul. However, Rainolds's precarious health prevented him from carrying out his teaching duties very regularly. Pits dramatically relates how over-exertion brought Rainolds close to death: Rainolds, having burst a blood-vessel and vomiting blood, made a solemn promise that, on recovery, he would devote the rest of his life to writing in defence of the Catholic church; and that, indeed, became his main occupation in life. Together with Gregory Martin, William Allen, and Richard Bristow, Rainolds was involved in the translation of the Rheims <span class="roman">Bible</span> (<span class="roman">New Testament</span>, 1582, <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, 2 vols., 1609&#150;10), although Rainolds's contribution mainly consisted in answering controversial works by opponents in England. Ironically, one of these opponents was William's brother John. William Rainolds replied to the attack on Gregory Martin's preface to the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> by the Cambridge scholar William Whitaker. Whitaker's Latin treatise <span class="italic">Ad Nicolai Sanderi demonstrationes</span> (1583) provoked an English reply by Rainolds (<span class="italic">A Refutation of Sundry Reprehensions, Cavils, and False Sleights, by which M. Whitaker Laboureth to Deface the Late English Translation</span>, 1583), which, in its turn, elicited a reply by Whitaker in 1585. In 1584 Rainolds brought out a translation of William Allen's <span class="italic">Ad persecutores Anglos</span>. Under the pseudonym Guilielmus Rossaeus, Rainolds (probably with the co-operation of William Gifford) entered the debate about the future succession of Elizabeth I through his <span class="italic">De iusta reipub. christianae in reges impios et haereticos authoritate</span> (1590), in which he posits that &#145;heretics&#146; cannot be legitimate monarchs. When the Scottish minister Robert Bruce attacked the Catholic position on attendance at Church of England services in his <span class="italic">Sermons upon the Sacrament</span> (1590) Rainolds replied with his <span class="italic">A Treatise Conteyning the True Catholick and Apostolike Faith</span> (1593). His final and most substantial publication is <span class="italic">Calvino-turcismus</span> (1597), a 1000-page treatise in which he compares protestant articles of faith to the&#151;in his view&#151;untenable ideas of infidels. The work was published posthumously by William Gifford.<br>
<br>During the last years of his life Rainolds served as chaplain to the Antwerp beguines. He died at Antwerp on 24 August 1594.<br>
