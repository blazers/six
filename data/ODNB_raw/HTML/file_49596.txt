<span class="headword">Burn,  Andrew Robert <span class="st"> [Robin]</span></span>  (1902&#150;1991), <span class="occ">historian and classical scholar</span>, was born on 25 September 1902 at the rectory, Kynnersley, Shropshire, the son of Andrew Ewbank Burn (1864&#150;1927), rector of Halifax and dean of Salisbury, and his wife, Celia Mary (1866&#150;1959), daughter of Edward Richardson. From Uppingham School (1916&#150;1921) he proceeded as a scholar to Christ Church, Oxford, where his tutor was R. H. Dundas. After graduating with a first in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1925 he returned to teach in his old school, Uppingham, where he was senior classical master from 1927 to 1940. On 31 December 1938 he married Mary Wynn Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1910), daughter of Wynn Thomas, until her marriage assistant keeper in the Victoria and Albert Museum and a part-time teacher of Greek and Byzantine art.<br>
<br>In 1940 Robin and Mary Burn moved to Athens, where Robin was British Council representative until 1941. On 22 April 1941, as the German army advanced, they left Athens on the last civilian boat, and travelled via Crete to Egypt, where Burn was commissioned in the intelligence corps at general headquarters Middle East in Cairo. In 1942 he was involved in cipher-breaking German intercepts at an &#145;outstation&#146; of Bletchley Park at Heliopolis. In 1943 he was posted to Aleppo to interrogate escapers, mainly Greek, from Europe. The following year he was appointed second secretary in the British embassy to the Greek government in exile in Cairo, and worked briefly in Caserta for Harold Macmillan, at that time resident minister in the Mediterranean. After the liberation of Greece he returned with the embassy to Athens, where he experienced the communist rising and the siege of central Athens and the embassy. At Christmas 1944, in a time of emergency, he met Churchill and Eden on their visit to Athens. He never lost his love for Greece, its landscape, its culture, and its people, and the Greek government recognized this when it honoured him in 1970 with the silver cross of the royal order of the Phoenix.<br>
<br>In 1946 Burn returned to academic life when, on the invitation of A. W. Gomme, he accepted the post of senior lecturer in ancient history in the University of Glasgow. He remained there until his retirement in 1969, being promoted to reader in 1965. After his retirement the teaching of ancient history at Glasgow was incorporated in the departments of humanity (Latin) and Greek (later to be incorporated in a single department of classics), but before then history was still regarded as somewhat peripheral to the studies of classics students, and Burn was in effect a self-contained one-man department, with sole responsibility for the teaching of both Greek and Roman history at all levels. From 1958 to 1959 he was visiting Gillespie professor of the College of Wooster, Ohio, and from 1961 to 1962 he was a member of the institute of advanced studies at Princeton. From 1966 to 1969 he served as president of the Glasgow Archaeological Society.<br>
<br>Burn was a highly congenial teacher and colleague, and many newly appointed lecturers were grateful to him and his wife for the hospitality and encouragement which they provided in their Glasgow flat. He was noted for his fund of anecdotes, and for his dry humour.<br>
<br>In 1969 he retired from his Glasgow post to spend his final three teaching years as visiting professor at the American &#145;College Year in Athens&#146;, thus appropriately combining his love of teaching with his love of Greece. His last years were spent with his wife, Mary, in retirement in Oxford, where &#145;he was already a legend&#146; when he arrived  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 27 June 1991). In 1979 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and in 1982 Oxford awarded him the degree of DLitt. He continued to play an active part at seminars and meetings until his death of heart failure and old age at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Woodstock Road, Oxford, on 17 June 1991. After cremation on 21 June his ashes were interred at St Michael's Church, Summertown, Oxford, on 8 October 1991.<br>
<br>Apart from journal articles and reviews Burn published a large number of books. Indeed, he used to say that writing books was his hobby. Already, as a schoolmaster at Uppingham, he produced <span class="italic">Minoans, Philistines and Greeks, 1400&#150;900 B.C.</span> (1930), <span class="italic">The Romans in Britain: an Anthology of Inscriptions</span> (1932), and <span class="italic">The World of Hesiod: a Study of the Greek Middle Ages, c.900&#150;700 B.C.</span> (1936). During the war years he found time to publish two small books, <span class="italic">This Scepter'd Isle: an Anthology of English Poetry</span> (1940) and <span class="italic">The Modern Greeks</span> (1942). His Glasgow years saw the appearance of <span class="italic">Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic Empire</span> (1947), <span class="italic">Pericles and Athens</span> (1948), <span class="italic">Agricola and Roman Britain</span> (1953), <span class="italic">The Lyric Age of Greece</span> (1960), <span class="italic">Persia and the Greeks: the Defence of the West, c.546&#150;478 B.C.</span> (1962), <span class="italic">A Traveller's History of Greece</span> (1965), and <span class="italic">The Warring States of Greece: from their Rise to the Roman Conquest</span> (1968). After retirement he published, with his wife, Mary, <span class="italic">The Living Past of Greece: a Time-Traveller's Tour of Historic and Prehistoric Places</span> (1980). Many of these books were to be revised and reprinted, some under different titles. All were highly readable, and many remained for many years standard in their field, and figured prominently in students' reading lists. They ranged widely over ancient and modern, political and military, Greek, Roman, and oriental history, literature, archaeology, and topography, and combined sound scholarship with exceptional skill in communicating it to specialist and non-specialist alike. Burn was a popularizer in the best sense of that word. He enjoyed reading as much as he enjoyed writing. At the age of eighty-six, in accepting an invitation to review a book for the <span class="italic">Classical Review</span>, he wrote to the editor, &#145;I love reviewing now that I do no more serious work! Send me anything you think fit&#146;  (personal knowledge). Throughout his life he was a committed member of the Church of England, and, during his Glasgow period, of the Scottish Episcopal church.<br>
