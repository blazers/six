<span class="headword">Woodhouse, Sir  William</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1517, <em>d.</em> 1564), <span class="occ">naval commander and administrator</span>, was the second son of John Woodhouse of Waxham in Norfolk and Alice, the daughter of William Croft of Thorpe Market. Sir Thomas Woodhouse was his elder brother. As William's first service was as escheator of Norfolk and Suffolk in 1538&#150;9, he must by then have been twenty-one. Nothing is known of his upbringing or education, but from the fact that he was a younger son, took to the sea, and was subsequently a member of the St George's Company of Norwich, it may be presumed that he was apprenticed to a Norwich merchant. In 1542 he commanded one of the king's ships against Scotland. In December 1543 he was in command of the <i>Primrose</i>, a 240 ton, middle-ranking warship, and in 1544 had been promoted to the 300 ton <i>Minion</i>. He was knighted at Leith by the earl of Hertford in May of that year, and by the early part of 1545 was admiral of the narrow seas under Viscount Lisle as lord admiral, flying his flag on the <i>Great Bark</i> of 500&#150;600 tons. When the council for marine causes was established in 1546 he was appointed master of the naval ordnance, with a salary of 100 marks a year.<br>
<br>In May 1541 Woodhouse was granted various minor offices in and around King's Lynn, and was described as the king's servant. It is clear that he was building up a substantial landed estate around Hickling in his native county, by grants and preferential purchases of former ecclesiastical lands. He bought the priory of Igtham from its incumbent prior ahead of its dissolution in 1535, which is fair indication of the sharpness of his business sense, and received other substantial grants by purchase and exchange in 1542 and 1545. He also held the advowsons of several Norfolk churches. From 1546 to 1550 he was keeper of Queenborough Castle in Kent, and in December 1552 he became lieutenant of the admiralty, or vice-admiral, in succession to Sir Thomas Clere. He remained second in command of the navy for the remainder of his life. In the early part of Elizabeth's reign he was responsible for reorganizing and improving the system of &#145;shipkeeping&#146;, the provision of skeleton crews for ships laid up on a care and maintenance basis. He did not invent this idea, which had been in use since the early part of Henry VIII's reign, but after the loss of the ancient but imposing <i>Henry Grace &agrave; Dieu</i>, which was burnt at her moorings in 1553, it became obvious that security would have to be improved. He commanded the channel fleet when war broke out with France in 1557, and was at sea again in 1562, to clear the channel of pirates.<br>
<br>Woodhouse sat in the parliaments of 1545, 1547, and March 1553 for the borough of Great Yarmouth; as a burgess for Norwich in 1559; and as knight of the shire for Norfolk in 1558 and 1563. Rather surprisingly, he was not appointed to the commission of the peace until February 1554, but he served thereafter continuously until his death, being <i>custos rotulorum</i> from 1561. He was also a founder member of the Muscovy Company in 1555, a sign of his business links with London.<br>
<br>Woodhouse married twice. His first wife was Anne, daughter of Henry Repps of Thorpe Market. She had died by 1551 when he married Elizabeth, the daughter of Sir Philip Calthorpe, and widow of Sir Henry Parker. It looks very much as though his second marriage was a direct result of his improved wealth and status. According to the heraldic visitation of 1563, the children of his first marriage were Anne, Mary, Thomas, and Henry, and of his second Thomas, William, and Elizabeth, from which it may be deduced that the first Thomas did not survive infancy. He died on 22 November 1564, and was buried in Hickling church, where what is alleged to be his monument remains, although all the inscriptions are defaced. His brother, Sir Thomas, continued to occupy the family seat at Waxham, where he died in 1571, and his rather grander tomb (which does have an inscription) survives.<br>
