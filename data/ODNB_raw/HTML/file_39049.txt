<span class="headword">Smith,  Thomas James</span>  (1827&#150;1896), <span class="occ">manufacturing chemist</span>, was born in June 1827 in the small village of Whitfield, near Haydon Bridge, Northumberland, and baptized there on 17 June 1827, the eldest of four children of Horatio Nelson Smith and his wife, Jane. T. J., as Smith became known, was apprenticed to a dispensing chemist in Grantham, Lincolnshire, at a time when pharmacy had only just emerged as a distinctive practice from the three separate professions of physician, surgeon, and apothecary. He supplemented his skills by attending University College, London, from 1854 to 1855, passing the minor examination of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS) in June 1855. In August he passed the major examination, which enabled him to become a member of the RPS. He was formally elected on 6 February 1856 and six months later moved to Hull, Yorkshire, where he bought as a going concern the chemist's shop at 61 Whitefriargate.<br>
<br>At first a general retail pharmacist, Smith developed an interest in the properties of cod-liver oil. This was already in use in British hospitals for combating two of the scourges of the day, rickets and consumption. It normally had a deep brown colour and a strong and unpleasant fishy flavour. Smith aimed to find a method of making the product&#151;for which there was a keen demand&#151;purer and more palatable. His experiments, supported by correspondence with medical specialists, enabled him to market his own oil. He refined his product by blending different oils, then putting the 1&frac12; gallon bottles on a flat roof to be bleached by the sun, a process that also improved the taste.<br>
<br>The various sorts of cod-liver oil were imported to Hull from Norway, where specialists had evolved a process to remove the stearin (fat in its solid form). In 1860 Smith went to Norway to investigate this source of supply in person, being the first Englishman to do so. On this pioneering visit he bought 750 gallons of the best oil at a price 1<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. cheaper per gallon than in London, at the same time making contracts for further visits.<br>
<br>Back in Hull, Smith decided that the Whitefriargate shop was too small for the wholesale business to which he had now progressed, and he bought 10 and 11 North Church Street, converting them to a warehouse in 1860. In 1861 he rented premises&#151;a house, shop, and outbuildings&#151;at 10 North Churchside. He was by this time selling a superior product at a lower price than his competitors. In 1880 a London specialist wrote to Smith suggesting that he bottle the oil and sell it under a brand name. Smith's Paragon cod-liver oil thus came into being and the business continued to flourish. Also in 1880 Smith bought the freehold of the North Churchside premises with a &pound;500 loan from his father.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Smith had become an active member of Hull's civic community. He was a town councillor from 1875 to 1882 and again from 1885 to 1892. While on the council he founded the Hull branch of the Charity Organization Society, and served the Hull chamber of commerce for many years as honorary secretary and treasurer, two of them as president (1879&#150;80). He was also a member of the East Yorkshire Conservative Association. A natural development from his interest in medicine was his membership of the sanitary committee, which addressed the problem of pre-empting the epidemics to which Hull, as a growing immigration port and commercial centre, was vulnerable.<br>
<br>By his late sixties, Smith was suffering increasing ill health. He had never married, and lived at Hornsea, on the Yorkshire coast, with his spinster sister, Amelia Ann Smith (1839&#150;1905). In 1896 Amelia invited Smith's nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45687/', "Horatio Nelson Smith (1874&#150;1960)")</script>, who had lived with them as a boy and was then working with a firm of London drapers and woollen manufacturers, to join his uncle in the cod-liver oil business. H. N., as he was known, accepted the offer and arrived in Hull in January 1896 for a trial period. Six months later, on 1 July, he became a partner in T. J. Smith &amp; Nephew.<br>
<br>Smith was now a complete invalid, and on 3 October 1896 he died at his Hornsea home, 7 Wilton Terrace; he was buried at St Nicholas's Church, Hornsea. Amelia inherited her brother's half-share of the business, but decided to pass it to H. N. At the time of Smith's death, the firm had a staff of three and a turnover of &pound;3000, of which about &pound;2500 was from cod-liver oil. H. N. Smith was its chief, and it was he who developed the surgical dressings side of the business. Thomas Smith's enterprise was thus relatively modest, and his contribution to society was as much through charity and political administration as the wholesaling of cod-liver oil. It was left to H. N. Smith to have the greater vision that made Smith &amp; Nephew into one of Britain's most successful manufacturing companies in the twentieth century.<br>
