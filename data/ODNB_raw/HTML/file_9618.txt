<span class="headword">Fitzmaurice,  Thomas</span>, eighteenth baron of Kerry and Lixnaw  (1574&#150;1630), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9616/', "Patrick Fitzthomas Fitzmaurice, seventeenth baron of Kerry and Lixnaw (d. 1600)")</script>, and his wife, Joan or Jane, daughter of David Roche, fifth Baron Roche of Fermoy. The Fitzmaurice lands included the barony of Clanmaurice, north co. Kerry, and their main seat, Lixnaw, 10 miles north of Tralee in the same county. They were kinsmen of the Desmond Fitzgeralds and answerable to the earls of Desmond with whom, however, they were often in a state of feud. In the second Desmond rebellion (1579&#150;83) and again during the campaign against the earl of Tyrone (1594&#150;1603) the Fitzmaurices were in arms against the crown.<br>
<br>Thomas Fitzmaurice joined his father in the uprising of 1598 to overthrow the Munster plantation. His father died on 12 August 1600 and Lixnaw and Listowel castles were captured at the end of the year, the latter stronghold besieged for three weeks by Sir Charles Wilmot, who massacred the garrison. Kerry fled the region, and went to Ulster to seek aid from the northern insurgents O'Neill and O'Donnell. He was listed among the rebels &#145;not to pardon&#146; in a directive by the queen to Lord Deputy Mountjoy of 21 December 1600 as one of the &#145;ringleaders to many monstrous and unnatural outrages&#146;  (Brewer and Bullen, 3.499). In January 1601 the privy council advised Sir George Carew, president of Munster, that &#145;the son of the late Lord Morris of Lixnawe&#146; was among the rebel leaders who &#145;notwithstanding they are expulsed and driven to misery, are yet not unlike to save their heads a great while, in respect of the manner of their life and the disposition of the country&#146;. He was &#145;to receive them upon no conditions but upon the pardon of lives only&#146;  (ibid., 4.15&#150;16). On 11 May 1601 Carew noted that Kerry had commandeered twelve galleys to invade co. Kerry and was in no mind to avail of the pardon. Late in the year he returned to the south in the company of O'Donnell, regained Lixnaw, and was among the lords who pledged allegiance to Philip of Spain. When the northern forces were driven back Carew reported to the privy council how a few insurgents held out in co. Kerry, including &#145;McMorrice&#146; (Fitzmaurice)&#151;&#145;They live separated in small companies, seeking safety in every bush&#146;  (Brewer and Bullen, 4.405). Kerry persistently evaded attempts at capture, including a notable one by Captain Boys. In April 1603, however, it was reported that &#145;none in Munster are in action saving M'Morris [Fitzmaurice] &hellip; he is creeping out of his den to implore mercy from the lord deputy&#146;; &#145;he saith he never offended the king&#146;, the new monarch, James I  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1603&#150;6</i>, 22).<br>
<br>Kerry was at James's court in 1604, made submission for his own and his father's offences, and was pardoned. He was successful in repossessing all the lands belonging to his father and secured grants of the lands of lesser rebels by letters patent of 16 July 1604, confirmed on 1 July 1612. With his first wife, Lady Honora (<i>d</i>. 1600), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20446/', "Conor O'Brien, third earl of Thomond")</script>, he had at least one son, Patrick, and a daughter, Joan. A condition of the royal generosity to him was that his heir Patrick was taken away from him and brought up with Donough O'Brien, the protestant fourth earl of Thomond, as a protestant. By his second marriage, in 1615, to a daughter of Richard Power, fourth Baron le Power, whose name is variously given as Shile or Gyles, he had five sons (prominent in the wars of the 1640s) and three daughters.<br>
<br>Kerry attended the last and brief Irish parliamentary session of James's reign (April&#150;May 1615), but a quarrel over precedence broke out between him and lords Slane and de Courcy; it was eventually decided in his favour. There was little rapport between him and his son Patrick, yet he promised Patrick a good settlement on his marriage to Honora, daughter of Sir Edmond Fitzgerald of Cloyne. In the event he refused to fulfil his promise and, when Patrick complained, was charged and briefly incarcerated in the Fleet prison, by 1622. As he appeared to have promptly honoured his contract to Patrick he was allowed to return to Ireland but once there refused to acknowledge his bond. Suspected, in addition, of further treachery, by 1624 he was re-arrested in London. Because he was once more permitted to return to Ireland it is presumed that surety of his good faith in the matter of his son's marriage settlement must have been given. He died at Drogheda on 3 June 1630 and was buried in Cormac's Chapel, Cashel, co. Tipperary.<br>
