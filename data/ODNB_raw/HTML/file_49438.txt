<span class="headword">Jay,  John</span>  (1805&#150;1872), <span class="occ">building and civil engineering contractor</span>, was born on 22 January 1805 at Buckingham (now Buckenham Parva), Norfolk, the second son and sixth child of John Jay (1765/6&#150;1848), builder and innkeeper, and Susannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Armsby (1767/8&#150;1861). He married Esther Wilson (1806&#150;1888) on 25 May 1826 at St Matthew's, Bethnal Green, where he was then living; they are known to have had three daughters, two of whom, unmarried, survived Jay, and a son who predeceased them.<br>
<br>Described in earlier London commercial directories as a carpenter, by 1839 Jay was a &#145;builder&#146; capable of handling a &pound;20,000 railway construction contract (London Viaduct, Eastern Counties Railway), though whence he derived the necessary capital is unknown. In 1842 he won the contract to build Reading gaol but was declared bankrupt before the commission, which passed to George Gilbert Scott, could be undertaken. As a large-scale general contractor, Jay executed both public buildings and railway works during the 1840s. St Michael's Church, Stockwell (1840&#150;41), was followed by the Infant Orphan Asylum, Wanstead (1841&#150;3). In 1847 he put in tenders (unsuccessfully) totalling &pound;700,000 for building the North Kent Railway, and the Ashford&#150;Hastings line. By 1850 he had acquired wharves and premises (rateable value, &pound;557) at Macclesfield Road North, Finsbury, adjoining the Regent's Canal, and undertook the building of 343 houses on the nearby Packington estate leased from the Clothworkers' Company by James Rhodes, land that included brickfields. In 1854 when Jay petitioned that further leases should be made direct to him, the company's clerk observed that &#145;he is a man of considerable wealth and responsibility&#146;  (Clothworkers' Co. MSS, Packington Estate, bundle J).<br>
<br>In 1849 Jay had secured the contract for building the Great Northern Railway from King's Cross to the southern end of the tunnel under Copenhagen Fields against such experienced railway contractors as Brassey and Peto and Betts, despite the line engineer's warning that it would be &#145;highly objectionable and hazardous to the completion of the works to accept a tender at the low prices offered by Mr Jay&#146;  (TNA: PRO, RAIL 236/271, 201&#150;2). His use of steam engines enabled a thousand cubic yards of soil to be removed from the cutting daily. This contract was quickly followed by those for the 45 acre King's Cross goods station, and for the passenger terminus (1851, &pound;123,500), where he had a thousand men working on two immense sheds 800 ft long, 105 ft wide and 71 ft high, the double-span arched roof then the largest of its kind in the world. Paid in a conventional mix of cash and bonds, Jay insisted that he be allowed the contract price for his brickwork even after the brick excise tax was abolished in 1850. Although not in the international league of railway contractors, Jay, working relatively close to his London base, was a powerful competitor. In 1853 he was appointed contractor for the eastern portion of the Metropolitan underground railway (which was not started until 1860 for lack of capital); he took the largest shareholding (&pound;100,000), from which he sought to be relieved in 1858, implying that his resources were then stretched. It was at this time that he sold the unbuilt parts of his Packington estate holdings.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1850s Jay had numerous contracts in hand. The King's Cross works completed, in 1852 he secured that for continuing the new houses of parliament (at &pound;152,333), and was building St Olave's Grammar Schools, Southwark (nearly &pound;24,000). Despite a 44 per cent increase in his prices, the basis of his contract, he won the next stage at Westminster (&pound;94,929), as well as large warehouse contracts in the City (where he also rebuilt Clothworkers' Hall, 1856&#150;8, &pound;33,846), and Colchester Station for the Eastern Counties Railway. At Westminster he refused to exchange his prices contract for the more popular lump sum form; he completed the clock and Victoria towers (where the ironwork of the cresting bears his name)&#151;works involving the most advanced building technology&#151;together with the Old Palace Yard front. The superior quality of his materials and workmen was commented on, and according to his obituary he was &#145;widely known as a liberal and considerate employer, and a businessman of uprightness and integrity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Islington Gazette</span>). He won the friendship of the government surveyor, Henry Arthur Hunt, who became one of his executors. About 1860 the Jay family, with four resident servants, moved to Highbury Park House, Islington, standing in its own grounds.<br>
<br>On completing the structure of the palace at Westminster in 1861, Jay sought more lucrative undertakings. With at least one further substantial contract for City warehouses in his pocket, he took up his long-deferred Metropolitan Railway work, completed in 1863, which proved extremely laborious and cost about &pound;250,000 a mile. His last large contracts embraced both work on the Palmerston government's fortifications programme, including casemented barracks at Portland, and the &pound;600,000 Hither Green&#150;Tonbridge section of the South Eastern Railway. He appears to have retired from business about 1870, and died at his residence, Ashford House, Hornsey, London, on 28 December 1872, &#145;much esteemed for his social qualities and his genial bearing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Islington Gazette</span>). Jay, his wife, and his son were all buried beneath a richly carved sarcophagus in Abney Park cemetery, Stoke Newington, London; the chapel there, built in 1840, is Jay's first known building.<br>
