<span class="headword">Pym, Sir  Samuel</span>  (1778&#150;1855), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the son of Joseph Pym of Pinley, near Henley in Arden, Warwickshire, and his wife, a daughter of Thomas Arnott MD, of Cupar, Fife; his brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22928/', "Sir William Pym")</script>. In June 1788 Samuel Pym was entered on the books of the frigate <i>Eurydice</i> as captain's servant. After service on the home station, in the Mediterranean, and the West Indies, on 7 March 1795 he was promoted lieutenant of the sloop <i>Martin</i> with Captain William Grenville Lobb, whom he followed to the <i>Babet</i> and the <i>Aimable</i> in the West Indies. In January 1798, in one of <i>Babet</i>'s boats, he took <i>La D&eacute;sir&eacute;e</i>, of 6 guns and 46 men, in a bloody struggle, won at the cost of one man killed, another drowned, and Pym and all the rest wounded. In November 1798 he joined the <i>Ethalion</i>, one of four frigates which on 16&#150;17 October 1799, near Cape Finisterre, captured the Spanish treasure ships <i>Thetis</i> and <i>Santa-Br&iacute;gida</i>, with specie worth nearly &pound;700,000. As one of the lieutenants, Pym received over &pound;5,000 in prize money. On Christmas day the <i>Ethalion</i> was wrecked on the Penmarks, off the south-west point of Brittany. On 10 February 1801 Pym was made commander of the <i>Swan</i> on the Portsmouth station, and was posted captain on 29 April 1802. On 25 May he married a daughter of Edward Lockyer of Plymouth: they had at least one child. In April 1804 he was appointed to the <i>Mars</i> in the Bay of Biscay, and in June to the <i>Atlas</i>, one of the squadron with Sir John Thomas Duckworth in the battle of San Domingo on 6 February 1806; for this, with the other captains, Pym received the gold medal.<br>
<br>In October 1808 Pym was appointed to the <i>Sirius</i>, in which, under Commodore Josias Rowley, he had an important share in the capture of St Paul's in the island of Bourbon in September 1809, and of the island itself in July 1810.<br>
<br>Pym was then sent to blockade Mauritius as senior officer of a frigate squadron consisting of the <i>Sirius</i>, <i>Iphigenia</i>, <i>N&eacute;r&eacute;ide</i>, and <i>Magicienne</i>, with the brig <i>Staunch</i>, and suffered the worst British naval defeat of the entire 1793&#150;1815 wars (and the only French naval victory recorded on the Arc de Triomphe, albeit wrongly inscribed as Port Louis). Facing a French squadron of five more powerful frigates, Pym began well by seizing the fortified Isle de la Passe, commanding the approach to Grand Port. Going on to blockade Port Louis, he learned that two enemy frigates and a sloop, with a prize, had been lured into Grand Port, and he snatched at the chance of destroying them before they reunited with their squadron. Haste, however, led to disaster. Trying to attack with <i>N&eacute;r&eacute;ide</i> on 22 August, he ran <i>Sirius</i> aground. When the whole squadron attacked next day, <i>Sirius</i> and <i>Magicienne</i> grounded through failing to follow <i>N&eacute;r&eacute;ide</i>, whose captain alone knew the reef-strewn channel. <i>N&eacute;r&eacute;ide</i>, isolated, was battered into surrender; <i>Sirius</i> and <i>Magicienne</i>, stuck fast, had to be burnt on 25 August; and <i>Iphigenia</i> was captured on 27 August, when the rest of the French squadron arrived. His squadron annihilated, Pym and the survivors were taken prisoner. He was freed when Mauritius was captured in the following December, and a court martial acquitted him of blame for the catastrophe. He was appointed in February 1812 to the <i>Hannibal</i>, off Cherbourg, and in May to the <i>Niemen</i>, which he commanded for the next three years on the West Indian station.<br>
<br>Pym was nominated a CB on 4 June 1815; in 1830&#150;31 he commanded the <i>Kent</i> in the Mediterranean. Promoted rear-admiral on 10 January 1837, he was made a KCB on 25 October 1839. From 1841 to 1846 he was admiral-superintendent at Devonport, and in the autumn of 1845 commanded the experimental squadron in the channel. He became a vice-admiral on 12 February 1847 and admiral on 17 December 1852; he died at the Royal Hotel, Southampton, on 2 October 1855.<br>
