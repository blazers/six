<span class="headword">Skinner,  William</span>  (1778&#150;1857), <span class="occ">Scottish Episcopal bishop of Aberdeen</span>, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25679/', "John Skinner (1744&#150;1816)")</script>, bishop of Aberdeen, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1807), daughter of the Revd William Robertson, was born at Aberdeen on 24 October 1778, and educated at Marischal College, Aberdeen, and at Oxford University, where he matriculated from Wadham College on 3 March 1798, graduating BA in 1801, and MA, BD, and DD in 1819. Skinner was ordained by Bishop Samuel Horsley of St Asaph in March 1802. After returning to Scotland, he officiated as assistant, and then as colleague, to his father in the incumbency of the Scottish Episcopal church of St Andrew's, Aberdeen. In 1804 he married the youngest daughter of James Brand, cashier of the Aberdeen Banking Company.<br>
<br>On 11 September 1816 Skinner was elected by the clergy of the diocese as successor to his father in the see of Aberdeen, and was consecrated at Stirling on 27 October. George Gleig, primus of the church, sent a severe but fruitless reproof to the dean and clergy of Aberdeen for electing the son of their late bishop. Skinner was one of the bishops who attended the synod held at Laurencekirk on 18 June 1828 to revise the canons of 1811; thirty canons were adopted and duly signed on 20 June. In 1832 Skinner confirmed as many as 462 persons, and a first effort was made in the same year to circulate Episcopalian religious works in the Gaelic language. On 29 August 1838 he attended another synod held in St Paul's Church, Edinburgh, when the canons were again revised. Upon the death of Bishop James Walker, Skinner was unanimously elected primus by an episcopal synod held in St Andrew's Church, Aberdeen, on 2 June 1841. During his primacy Trinity College, Glenalmond, near Perth, was founded in 1844, and developed by the Episcopalians in Scotland as a place of education for young men studying for the church. In the previous year a serious controversy had sprung out of the refusal of Sir William Dunbar, minister of St Paul's Chapel, Aberdeen, to receive or to administer the sacrament in accordance with the Scottish ritual. Acting with the concurrence of his synod, Skinner excommunicated Dunbar on 13 August 1843. Among the many pamphlets written on this issue were <span class="italic">A letter to the managers of St Paul's Chapel by Sir W. Dunbar, to which is added Bishop Skinner's declaration</span> (1843) and <span class="italic">The Rev. Sir W. Dunbar versus the Right Rev. W. Skinner</span> (1849). Skinner did much during his primacy to consolidate the Episcopal party in Scotland. He died at 1 Golden Square, Aberdeen, on 15 April 1857, and was buried in the Spital cemetery on 22 April.<br>
