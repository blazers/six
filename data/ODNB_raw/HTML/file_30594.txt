<span class="headword">Barlow, Sir  (James) Alan Noel</span>, second baronet  (1881&#150;1968), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born in London on 25 December 1881, the eldest of the five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30595/', "Sir Thomas Barlow (1845&#150;1945)")</script>, who was created baronet in 1901, physician to the royal family, and his wife, Ada Helen (1843&#150;1928), daughter of Patrick Dalmahoy, writer to the signet, of Edinburgh. He was educated at Marlborough College and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, of which he was a scholar and later an honorary fellow, and took a first in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1904.<br>
<br>In 1906 Barlow was appointed to a clerkship in the House of Commons but a year later Sir Robert Morant, displaying his characteristic ability to spot men of talent, selected him as a junior examiner in the Board of Education. Here he rose to be private secretary to the parliamentary secretary in 1914, but not before he had married, on 6 April 1911, Emma Nora (<i>d</i>. 1989), the daughter of Sir Horace Darwin; they had six children. His wife was the granddaughter of Charles Darwin, whose <i>Beagle</i> diaries and autobiography she edited in 1933 and 1958 respectively, and it was she who fostered in Barlow an interest in science. Given his own strong artistic instincts this laid the basis for success in his later career&#151;a success not unhindered by his own family connections and his wife's relationship through marriage to Sir Edward Bridges, the future cabinet secretary and head of the civil service.<br>
<br>In 1915 Barlow was transferred to the Ministry of Munitions as private secretary to Christopher Addison in his capacity first of parliamentary secretary and then of minister. In 1917 Barlow was promoted to deputy controller of labour supply and a year later to controller of the labour department. He became well versed in the problems of industrial relations, and so after the war it was natural that he should join the newly founded and much overstretched Ministry of Labour, where he was initially responsible for demobilization and training before securing in 1924 a major promotion to principal assistant secretary in charge of the industrial relations department.<br>
<br>After 1929 Barlow's main responsibility reverted to training and it was in this area that he left his principal mark. His decisiveness and executive drive established a core of efficient and well-respected government training centres which could be, and were, rapidly expanded in war. His sensitivity to the antipathy of both the Treasury and the labour movement, however, allied to his own instinct (as a descendant of a family of Manchester cotton spinners) that industry should train its own workforce, meant that government in peacetime did little to remedy the country's chronic lack of skilled manpower.<br>
<br>In 1933 Barlow was selected, at the surprisingly late age of fifty-one, to be principal private secretary to the prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald. The appointment was not a success. The two men were temperamentally unsuited, and his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30596/', "Sir Thomas Dalmahoy Barlow")</script>, as a leading member of the Lancashire chamber of commerce, became embroiled in a major political row over the doctoring (to the government's advantage) of the chamber's evidence to the parliamentary committee on Indian constitutional reform. Barlow was transferred in 1934 to the Treasury, as under-secretary in charge of the supply divisions and thus public expenditure, a responsibility he retained when promoted to third secretary in 1939 and second secretary in 1942. During the war he also assumed responsibility for, and thereby became a member of an interlocking range of committees concerned with, the machinery of government.<br>
<br>At the Treasury Barlow's influence was largely covert, although it has been claimed that he was one of the six most creative reformers to leave a lasting mark on the modern civil service  (Chapman and Greenaway, 217). He shared the traditional Treasury distaste for public expenditure. The one major exception was educational expenditure, to which he was generally sympathetic, and he famously chaired the committee whose 1946 report, &#145;Scientific man-power&#146; (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1945&#150;6, 14, Cmd 6824), called for the doubling of scientific graduates and the establishment of a new technological university&#151;an unfulfilled ambition which caused resignations from the Conservative cabinet in 1953. He must also share the blame for failing permanently to adapt Whitehall to the greater interventionist role of post-war government in economic and social policy, and thus for what has been called &#145;<i>the</i> greatest lost opportunity in the history of British public administration&#146;  (Hennessy, 120). In the short term, however, his range of contacts&#151;not least in the scientific world&#151;ensured the flexibility of the wartime service, just as his contacts with the artistic world ensured that its interests were not wholly neglected by government in peace.<br>
<br>Barlow's contacts were consolidated and much of his work discharged in a range of London clubs, most notably the Savile and the Athenaeum, where he was well known as &#145;a man of the world, of the dining and card tables, of conversation and of appropriate silences&#146;  (Meynell, 238). This urbanity was somewhat at odds with his initial appearance, for as Austin Strutt noted &#145;with his heavy and lined face he could, peering through his glasses, appear a forbidding person&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Hugh Dalton even called him &#145;desiccated and sinister&#146;  (Pimlott, 700). To those who knew him, however, he was warm, sympathetic, even-tempered, and humorous, albeit ever ready to offer direct and forceful advice to whomever, and at whatever level, it was required. He was appointed CBE (1918), CB (1928), KBE (1938), KCB (1942), GCB (1947), and succeeded his father as second baronet in 1945.<br>
<br>Barlow retired from the Treasury in 1948. His economic and scientific interests were reflected by his membership of the Iron and Steel Board from 1946 to 1948 and his continuing membership of the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy. His academic contacts were maintained as a member of the court of the University of London between 1949 and 1956. Above all, however, his artistic interests were recognized by his appointment between 1948 and 1955 as a trustee of the National Gallery (where he served as chairman from 1949 to 1951) and as president of the Oriental Ceramic Society. He had himself an exceptional collection of Islamic pottery and Chinese ceramics, which he had started at the age of eighteen and from which he made many donations to the Ashmolean, Fitzwilliam, Victoria and Albert, and British museums as well as to the University of Sussex. Together with his love of old books and modern printing he also became interested in archaeology, particularly in his home county of Buckinghamshire. Here, as well as being a keen gardener, he farmed several hundred acres near Wendover; and it was at his farm, Boswells, that he died on 28 February 1968.<br>
