<span class="headword">Porter,  William Henry</span>  (1791&#150;1861), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born in Dublin on 5 March 1791, the son of a bookseller, William Porter (1757&#150;1841), of Willmount, Rathfarnham, and his wife, Susanna Bacon (<i>d</i>. 1828). From Porterstown School, Portarlington, he entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 1 July 1805; he was awarded a scholarship in 1808, and took his BA degree in 1810. Meanwhile he was indentured to Sir Philip Crampton and studied at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) and at the Meath Hospital, Dublin. He obtained the letters testimonial of the RCSI on 13 September 1814 and was elected a member of the college (equivalent to the later fellowship) on 10 November 1817, but did not take the MD of Trinity College until 1842. Porter married Jane (<i>d</i>. 1858), daughter of Cuthbert Hornidge of Russelstown, Blessington, co. Wicklow, in 1816, and they lived at 21 Kildare Street. They had two sons and five daughters. Their son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22566/', "George Hornidge Porter")</script> followed his father's profession with distinction. One of their daughters married Canon Leeper DD; another became the wife of Dr Robert Johns; a third married Robert Cooper.<br>
<br>In 1819 Porter was appointed surgeon to the Meath Hospital, then situated in the Coombe but scheduled to transfer to a new building half a mile away at Long Lane and Heytesbury Street. When the move eventually took place, on Christmas eve 1822, Porter and a colleague played an active part in the moving of patients, who were wrapped in blankets and carried in baskets specially made for the transfer. Their logistics were upset by a violent storm, and as the surgeons returned to the Coombe they found the empty baskets were useful to protect their heads from falling slates.<br>
<br>Porter earned a reputation as a courageous operator. He performed a caesarean section in 1835 (neither infant nor mother survived), was particularly skilled in the ligature of arteries, and removed a subdural haematoma with spectacular success, though he described trepanation in the conscious patient as a dreadful ordeal &#145;and fearful to behold&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dublin Medical Press</span>, 3, 1839, 301). He spoke against indiscriminate blood-letting, and said bluntly: &#145;I fear many a man has been bled once too often&#146;  (Doolin, 104).<br>
<br>A well-trained anatomist, Porter was one of a group who established the Park Street medical school (one of Dublin's many private schools), where he taught anatomy and surgery. He contributed numerous articles on general surgery, tracheotomy, fracture of the neck of the femur, hydrocele, and syphilis to the <span class="italic">Dublin Journal of Medical Science</span>, of which he was a co-editor. He published two books: <span class="italic">Observations on the Surgical Pathology of the Larynx and Trachea</span> (1826), and <span class="italic">Observations on the Surgical Pathology and Treatment of Aneurysm</span> (1840).<br>
<br>Porter was consulting surgeon to the City of Dublin Hospital; he also held a chair of surgery at the RCSI from 1836 to 1847 and was president of the college in 1838. He was an eloquent lecturer. We learn from a contemporary that<blockquote>he was no &#145;dry as dust&#146; teacher. His hearers were supplied from no ancient eroded cistern or stagnant pool, for he had that power, possessed by so few, of being able to strike the rock from which came the living water. (Ormsby, 197)</blockquote>He represented the college on the General Medical Council.<br>
<br>Porter was found dead in his bed on 28 April 1861. His sudden death was attributed to a ruptured thoracic aneurysm, though it may have been cardiac. An obituarist in the <span class="italic">Dublin Quarterly Journal of Medical Science</span> proclaimed his virtues: &#145;Classical as a writer; brilliant as a lecturer; earnest as a worker; and excellent as a man&#146;.<br>
