<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Holtby,  Winifred</span>  (1898&#150;1935), <span class="occ">novelist and feminist reformer</span>, was born at Rudston, Yorkshire, on 23 June 1898, the younger daughter of David Holtby (<i>d</i>. 1933), a prosperous farmer, and his wife, Alice Winn (1858&#150;1939), who served as alderman in the East Riding. An independent and precocious child, Holtby was encouraged in her literary ambitions while at Queen Margaret's School, Scarborough (1909&#150;16). After a year as a probationer nurse in a London nursing home, she went up to Somerville College, Oxford, in October 1917, but she left in July of the following year to join the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, and served in France until August 1919 as a hostel forewoman.<br>
<br>Returning to Somerville that October, Holtby encountered in her modern history tutorials the woman who was to become her closest friend and colleague&#151;Vera Brittain. Initial hostility gave way to a deep understanding in which their literary talent and ambition, similarity of experience (especially in war service), and leftist social and political views allowed them to help and encourage each other creatively. Physically and temperamentally they were very different, however: Holtby tall, fair, confident, gregarious, and equable; Brittain small, dark, pretty, shy, and volatile. These differences complicated and strengthened their friendship.<br>
<br>They left Oxford in 1921, with second-class degrees, and shared a flat in Doughty Street, London, while establishing parallel careers. Holtby's lively, stylish, witty articles and reviews soon gained her a high reputation as a journalist. She became a regular contributor (and from 1926 a director) of the feminist journal <span class="italic">Time and Tide</span>, and a friend of its founder and editor, Margaret Haig Thomas, Viscountess Rhondda. Joining Rhondda's Six Point Group, Holtby and Brittain quickly established themselves as influential young feminists. In her article &#145;Feminism divided&#146;, 1926, Holtby wrote:<blockquote>Personally, I am a feminist &hellip; because I dislike everything that feminism implies. &hellip; I want to be about the work in which my real interests lie &hellip; But while &hellip; injustice is done and opportunity denied to the great majority of women, I shall have to be a feminist.</blockquote>Holtby and Brittain also joined the League of Nations Union, lecturing widely on world peace, and in 1922 toured Europe to investigate post-war conditions. Both joined the Labour Party. Both published novels in 1923 and 1924. During 1926 Holtby visited South Africa for over five months to speak on behalf of the League of Nations Union. Appalled by the racism she observed there, she worked energetically against it for the rest of her life, giving moral and financial support to the black trade union movement. On her return to London she was invited by Brittain, who was now married, to join a household soon further enlivened by two children, one of them Shirley Williams, to whom Holtby became a beloved &#145;aunt&#146;. The two women had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances, many prominent as writers, feminists, and socialists.<br>
<br>Extremely generous and dutiful, Holtby sacrificed much time and energy to her friends and family. Yet her literary career of less than fifteen years was notably prolific. Her first two novels&#151;<span class="italic">Anderby Wold</span> (1923) and <span class="italic">The Crowded Street</span> (1924)&#151;established a recurrent theme: the quest for independence, and its cost. Realistic regional novels, they incorporated satire, an element which strengthened in her next three novels, <span class="italic">The Land of Green Ginger</span> (1927), <span class="italic">Poor Caroline</span> (1931), and <span class="italic">Mandoa, Mandoa!</span> (1933). Increasingly ambitious, all these novels are unpretentiously direct and witty in style, imaginative in using Holtby's own experience, and firmly focused on social and political problems. The latter two novels also moved away from Yorkshire, to London and an imagined Abyssinia respectively. Among the other seven books she published are a fine pioneering critical study of <span class="italic">Virginia Woolf</span> (1932); <span class="italic">The Astonishing Island</span> (1933), a satire; a feminist treatise, <span class="italic">Women and a Changing Civilisation</span> (1934); <span class="italic">Truth is not Sober</span> (1934), a collection of short stories; and a collection of poems, <span class="italic">The Frozen Earth</span> (1935). A play attacking the rise of fascism, <span class="italic">Take Back Your Freedom</span>, was published posthumously, as were a further volume of short stories and two selections from her lively correspondence.<br>
<br>During the last four years of her life Holtby fought gallantly against the depredations of renal sclerosis (Bright's disease). Before she completed <span class="italic">Mandoa, Mandoa!</span> she had been warned that her time was short, and her final novel was begun in the knowledge that she might not be able to complete it. Her courage and consideration were so remarkable that even close friends had no idea, until near the end, that she was seriously ill. Equally remarkable were the ambition and determination that pushed <span class="italic">South Riding</span> (published posthumously in March 1936 and awarded the James Tait Black memorial prize) to completion. Her final novel is also her masterpiece. Returning to a Yorkshire setting, Holtby wrote a rich regional study of social change and local government, drawing to some extent on her mother's experiences as the first woman alderman in the East Riding. Like George Eliot's <span class="italic">Middlemarch</span>, Holtby's novel weaves together a large number of characters and several plots to represent a complex society; illness and death are repeatedly present, but balanced against a characteristically vigorous optimism; and the quest for individual independence and fulfilment&#151;that long-established theme&#151;is here given its fullest and most impressive expression.<br>
<br>On her deathbed in a London nursing home at 23 Devonshire Street, Marylebone, Winifred Holtby was betrothed to the man she loved, Harry Pearson. She died on 29 September 1935, and was buried in Yorkshire at Rudston churchyard on 2 October 1935, one day after a memorial service in St Martin-in-the-Fields, London. Vera Brittain's <span class="italic">Testament of Friendship: the Story of Winifred Holtby</span> was published in 1940.<br>
