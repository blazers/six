<span class="headword">Corney,  Bolton</span>  (1784&#150;1870), <span class="occ">literary critic and antiquary</span>, was born at St Lawrence, Thanet, on 28 April 1784 and baptized in the parish church of St Lawrence, the son of Henry Corney (<i>d</i>. 1801) and his wife, Mary Stock. It has been stated that he served for some time in the revenue service, but this is doubtful and little is known of his early life and education. In 1803 he obtained a commission as ensign in the 28th regiment of foot, and in 1804 a medal for good marksmanship inscribed &#145;Royal Greenwich Volunteers&#146;. The middle portion of his life was spent at Maze Hill, Greenwich, where he held the post of first clerk in the steward's department at the Royal Hospital  (<span class="italic">Navy List</span>, 1840, 138). From this he did not retire until about 1846 or 1847, when he married Henrietta Mary Pridham, elder surviving daughter of Captain (afterwards Admiral) Richard Pridham of Plymouth; he then moved to 29 The Terrace, Barnes, in Surrey.<br>
<br>In early life Corney formed an attachment to literature, and after his move to Barnes he plunged more deeply than ever into his bibliophilic researches, and lived and died literally in the midst of his books. In <span class="italic">Researches and Conjectures on the Bayeux Tapestry</span> (1836), he contended that the tapestry was not executed until 1205, and his view was adopted by Dr Lingard  (J. C. Bruce, <span class="italic">Bayeux Tapestry Elucidated</span>, 11, 163). Edouard Lambert published a reply to Corney in <span class="italic">R&eacute;futation des objections faites contre l'antiquit&eacute; de la tapisserie de Bayeux</span> (1841). Corney's caustic criticism of Isaac D'Israeli in <span class="italic">Curiosities of Literature by I. D'Israeli Illustrated</span> (1837) prompted D'Israeli to reply in <span class="italic">The Illustrator Illustrated</span> (1838), whereupon Corney brought out a second edition of his work, &#145;revised and acuminated, to which are added, Ideas on Controversy, deduced from the practice of a Veteran; and adapted to the meanest capacity&#146;  (1838). The <span class="italic">London Metropolitan Magazine</span> thought the illustrations &#145;by far the best specimens of historical and bibliographical criticism that we have seen anywhere this many a day&#146;  (Allibone, <span class="italic">Dict.</span>). One hundred copies of the &#145;Ideas on controversy&#146; were separately printed. <span class="italic">On the new general biographical dictionary: a specimen of amateur criticism, in letters to Mr Sylvanus Urban</span> (1839) was a collection of letters which originally appeared in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, in which he severely criticized the earlier portions of the well known biographical compilation published under the name of the Revd Hugh James Rose. In the 1860s he published <span class="italic">Comments on the evidence of Antonio Panizzi, esq., before the select committee of the House of Commons on the British Museum, <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 1860</span> (in 1856 Corney, who had often clashed with Panizzi, protested to Palmerston against Panizzi's appointment as principal librarian); <span class="italic">The Sonnets of William Shakspere: a Critical Disquisition Suggested by a Recent Discovery</span> (by V. E. Philar&egrave;te Chasles, relating to the inscription which precedes the sonnets in the edition of 1609) (1862); and <span class="italic">An Argument on the Assumed Birthday of Shakspere: Reduced to Shape, 1864</span>.<br>
<br>Corney also edited, from a manuscript in his own possession, <span class="italic">An Essay on Landscape Gardening</span> by Sir John Dalrymple, one of the barons of the exchequer in Scotland (1823); <span class="italic">The Seasons</span> by James Thomson, with illustrations designed by the Etching Club (1842); Goldsmith's <span class="italic">Poetical Works, Illustrated, with a Memoir</span> (1846); <span class="italic">The Voyage of Sir Henry Middleton to Bantam and the Maluco Islands in 1604</span> (1855), for the Hakluyt Society, of which his son attested that he was one of the original founders in 1846; and <span class="italic">Of the Conduct of the Understanding, by John Locke</span> (1859). He was a frequent contributor to <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> and <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, and he made special collections concerning Caxton, which he placed at the disposal of William Blades  (Blades, <span class="italic">Life and Typography of William Caxton</span>, 7. xi, 282&#150;5; 2.259). He was a member of the council of the Shakespeare Society and the Camden Society, one of the auditors of the Royal Literary Fund, and a long-time member of the Royal Society of Literature.<br>
<br>Corney died at his home, 29 The Terrace, Barnes, on 31 August 1870 from &#145;natural decay&#146; and was buried in the parish cemetery on Barnes Common. He left an only son, Bolton Glanvill Corney, born in 1851, who became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons and was appointed government medical officer in Fiji.<br>
