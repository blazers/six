<span class="headword">Benham,  John Lee</span>  (1785&#150;1864), <span class="occ">stove manufacturer</span>, was born in Reading, Berkshire, on 3 November 1785, the second son of Avery Benham (<i>b</i>. 1753), whitesmith, and his wife, Ann Lee. In 1791 his father moved to London, where he set up in business as A. Benham &amp; Son, tinplate workers, of Commerce Row, Blackfriars Road. John worked for his father until 1817, when he bought an ironmonger's shop in Edward Street (which soon after became part of Wigmore Street), Marylebone, all manufacturing being done by his father. His first wife having died after giving birth to the second of two children, he married in 1818 Jane Kirkpatrick, from an old and well-connected Scottish family. A daughter, Emily, survived from his first marriage; five sons and two daughters were born of the second.<br>
<br>The nondescript area north of Oxford Street was being rapidly covered by large and elegant new houses for the gentry, complete with the new stoves and cooking and bathroom appliances designed for comfortable living. Benham was well aware of his market; he advertised his fancy lamps for the forthcoming coronation of George IV in <span class="italic">The Times</span> (14 July 1821), and in 1827 in <span class="italic">John Bull</span>; he advertised in the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> his portable shower bath for use in the bedroom, which he patented in 1830. In 1824 he took over premises formerly occupied by the bishop of Chichester, on the corner of Wigmore and Welbeck streets. The family occupied the upper part of the house and showrooms were laid out on the ground floor. Workshops were installed in the basement and cellars, though Benham had to weather opposition to this supposed desecration of a former bishop's palace. The Benhams' first and third sons, <a name="cosubject_46621"></a><span class="headword">James Benham</span>  (1820&#150;1885) and Frederick (<i>c</i>.1824&#150;1891), father of the traveller <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57169/', "Gertrude Emily Benham")</script>, went straight from school into the business; the second son, Edward, settled in Essex where he started a printing business in Colchester and was proprietor of the <span class="italic">Essex County Standard</span>. The junior sons, Augustus (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1826) and John (<i>c</i>.1830&#150;1899), were put into a coppersmithing business, but it could not support both of them, and John joined his brothers in his father's business. By 1848 James was married, to Eliza Horsey; they had at least two children.<br>
<br>The enlarged showrooms encouraged Benham to diversify beyond the domestic market. From the 1840s he secured several major contracts to fit up kitchens, most famously in 1841 that of the Reform Club. The entire cooking apparatus, made to the requirements of its chef Alexis Soyer, was manufactured at Wigmore Street. Benham was employing forty-four men by 1851, the year that he won medals for his extensive displays at the Great Exhibition. He was successful at the Paris exhibitions of 1855 and 1867, and the London Exhibition of 1862. When workshop space became inadequate for the ninety-three men labouring to fulfil his orders, he took over two adjacent houses, with land on which he built a fine modern factory. Much of the trade centred on the extremely successful range of &#145;combined&#146; cooking apparatus designed by Samuel Hazard Huntly, who was Benham's works manager from about 1850. A single fire heated one or more ovens, supplied steam to the boiling pans and hot water for washing up, and in certain instances, for laundries and hot baths. The arrangement was so efficient that, under test at the Royal Artillery barracks, Woolwich, all the food for 663 men, including their bread, was cooked, and hot water delivered for washing up, from 3&frac34; oz of coal per head per day, which worked out at a cost of 8<i>d</i>. per head per annum, a remarkably small sum, even allowing for the low cost of coal and the simple meals. By 1876 similar stoves were in use throughout the country, in twelve military barracks, sixty workhouses, twenty-two hospitals, several schools, and some of the larger West End department stores. When the Admiralty decided that henceforth sailors should have bread rather than pre-baked ship's biscuit, Huntly designed a compact stove with one furnace heating four ovens and four boiling pans; between 1859 and 1876 Benhams stoves were put into eighty-four ships of the British navy and some seventy other foreign and commercial vessels. Benhams' peak of success was 1874, when the partners, James, Frederick, and John, made a profit of over &pound;15,000, much of which they prudently reinvested.<br>
<br>John Lee Benham, whose ability and drive had underpinned this success, died at 19 Wigmore Street, London, on 10 March 1864. A Baptist, he was involved in many religious and philanthropic activities and his judgement and advice were widely sought. Seven Benhams had joined the new Bloomsbury Baptist Chapel at its opening in 1848, participating actively and generously in Baptist missionary, educational, and poor relief projects. James served as the first treasurer; from 1864 he was also steward in charge of its building fabric, and he rose to be senior deacon.<br>
<br>Huntly had departed and the firm was going through difficult times when James Benham died suddenly at 50 Wigmore Street, London, on 15 June 1885. Unwisely, the combined stoves were abandoned in favour of large boilers and steam appliances but the directors lacked experience in costing these and the heart of the West End was ill suited to their noisy manufacture. Losses were continuing to mount when Frederick Benham, a man of charm and humour but unable to impose order, died in 1891, whereupon Benhams was formed into a private company. (Frederick's daughter Gertrude Emily Benham became a noted traveller.) John's son Stanley J. Benham joined the business in 1892 and was appalled at the inefficiency and drunkenness accepted on the shop floor.<br>
<br>By the early years of the century the various directors were eager to sell the Marylebone leases and cancel their losses. The old company was quietly liquidated and a new one having the same name was formed with Stanley Benham and his cousin Walter Benham (<i>d</i>. 1908) as managing directors. Benhams' prosperity was restored by commissions to refit the galleys of warships prior to the First World War. They subsequently absorbed various smaller companies, the first of which, Johnson and Ravey, brought with it the royal warrant which surprisingly Benhams had not been given for their work on the royal yacht in 1898. The business continued under the command of various members of the Benham family and was absorbed into the Thorn Group after the Second World War.<br>
