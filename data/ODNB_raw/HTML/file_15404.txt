<span class="headword">Kenney,  Charles Lamb</span>  (1821&#150;1881), <span class="occ">author and playwright</span>, was born at Bellevue, France, on 29 April 1821, the last son of the Irish-born playwright <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15405/', "James Kenney (1780&#150;1849)")</script> and his wife, Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mercier (<i>c</i>.1780&#150;1853), the widow of the playwright and novelist Thomas Holcroft. He was named after his godfather, the well-known author Charles Lamb, and, according to his acerbic rival in the theatre Sir Francis Burnand, the name &#145;did a great deal for him&#146; in a public and literary life in which he moved in the most lofty of circles.<br>
<br>Kenney was educated at London's Merchant Taylors' School and in his early working days went through a variety of jobs: as a clerk in the Post Office, as a playreader for Covent Garden Theatre, as an all-purpose reporter and critic for <span class="italic">The Times</span>, as publicity man for the Great Exhibition (1851), as secretary, first to Sir Joseph Paxton during the Crimean War (1855) and then to Ferdinand de Lesseps in the early days of the Suez Canal project (1856), and latterly as a journalist again, this time on <span class="italic">The Standard</span>.<br>
<br>Throughout this time Kenney also wrote&#151;or, more accurately, for the most part translated and/or adapted&#151;a number of works, both for the printed page (<span class="italic">Fairy Tales and Romances</span>, 1849; <span class="italic">Travels in Southern Russia</span>, 1853) and for the theatre. While still in his early twenties he had a hand in some of the extravaganzas written by Albert Smith and Tom Taylor for the Keeleys at the Lyceum. He also further adapted Nathaniel Thomas Haynes Bayly's adaptation of a French play as <span class="italic">The Spitalfields Weaver</span>, in which the comic actor Johnnie Toole made his stage d&eacute;but under the Keeleys at the Haymarket in 1852, and which remained a perennial in Toole's repertory for many years. In 1859 Kenney married Rosa Stewart in Paris, and in the same year, with Sutherland Edwards, he provided the St James's Theatre with a burlesque of the Brothers Grimm's Swan Lake tale, <span class="italic">The Swan and Edgar</span>.<br>
<br>It was another adaptation from the French, however, which gave the multilingual Kenney his most significant success. The English Opera at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, had been struggling since the retirement of its famous managers Louisa Pyne and William Harrison, and in October 1864 a limited company fronted by the former concert promoter John Russell took over its management. Russell commissioned adaptations of Charles Gounod's <span class="italic">Le m&eacute;decin malgr&eacute; lui</span> and Jacques Meyerbeer's latest hit <span class="italic">L'Africaine</span> from Kenney before the limited company went under, at which stage Russell took over the theatre with an ambitious project of his own: the first faithfully adapted English version of a full-sized <i>op&eacute;ra bouffe</i> by Offenbach to be produced in Britain. He entrusted the adaptation of <span class="italic">La grande-duchesse</span> to Kenney. Russell's production proved a landmark, <i>op&eacute;ra bouffe</i> became the rage of the English and American stage for a decade, and productions of Kenney's highly praised version of <span class="italic">La grande-duchesse</span> were seen throughout the English-singing world for many years.<br>
<br>Kenney subsequently adapted Offenbach's <span class="italic">Barbe-Bleue</span> for Russell, <span class="italic">La princesse de Tr&eacute;bizonde</span> and <span class="italic">La belle H&eacute;l&egrave;ne</span> for John Hollingshead at the Gaiety, Emil Jonas's zany <span class="italic">Le canard &agrave; trois becs</span> for E. P. Hingston at the Opera Comique, and Offenbach's <span class="italic">La jolie parfumeuse</span> for Russell's erstwhile prima donna, Emily Soldene. At the same time he continued to turn out English versions of French and Italian operas, adding to his list between 1871 and 1875 <span class="italic">Don Pasquale</span>, <span class="italic">La fille du r&eacute;giment</span>, <span class="italic">Lucia di Lammermoor</span>, <span class="italic">Le nozze di Figaro</span>, <span class="italic">Un ballo in maschera</span>, <span class="italic">La muette de Portici</span>, <span class="italic">La favorita</span>, <span class="italic">Semiramide</span>, <span class="italic">Le domino noir</span>, <span class="italic">Ali Baba</span>, and <span class="italic">L'elisir d'amore</span>. He also translated the text to Verdi's <span class="roman">Requiem</span> into English. Among his other stage works were an English edition of L&eacute;o D&eacute;libes' little <i>op&eacute;rette</i> <span class="italic">Six demoiselles &agrave; marier</span> for Drury Lane, where it was produced with Lydia Thompson in the principal role in March 1867. He revised and modernized one of the old Keeley extravaganzas as a pantomime, <span class="italic">Valentine and Orson, or, Harlequin the Big Bear and the Little Fairy</span> (music by George Richardson), for Sefton Parry at the Holborn Theatre at Christmas 1867. Kenney's short farcical sketch &#145;with musical finale&#146; entitled <span class="italic">Our Autumn Manoeuvres</span> played as a curtain-raiser to Andrew Halliday's long-running adaptation of <span class="italic">Les mis&eacute;rables</span> at the Adelphi in 1871, with Henry Ashley and Mrs Alfred Mellon featured, and his comedietta <span class="italic">Maids of Honour</span> was produced by Horace Wigan at the Mirror Theatre in April 1875 with Fred Irish as the attraction.<br>
<br>Kenney was never an enthusiastic worker&#151;Burnand described him as &#145;epigrammatically brilliant and invariably, because constitutionally, lazy&#146;  (Burnand, 2.245)&#151;and the onset of what would be his final illness meant that he produced little in the last five years of his life. By June 1877 he was in such straits that Lord Dunraven, Tom Taylor, and Lord Londesborough organized a benefit matin&eacute;e on his behalf: Henry Kemble, Henry Neville, Charles Santley, Johnston Forbes Robertson, Henry Irving, Ellen Terry (in her London d&eacute;but), Sims Reeves, Mrs Alfred Mellon, and Mrs Henry Leigh featured in <span class="italic">A School for Scandal</span> to a packed house at the Gaiety.<br>
<br>Latterly Kenney contributed spasmodically to magazines such as <span class="italic">The Musical World</span> and published a translation, <span class="italic">The Correspondence of H. de Balzac</span> (1878), but he spent his final years as an invalid. He died at his home in Eldon Road, Kensington, on 25 August 1881, and was buried in the family grave at Brompton cemetery on 30 August. His two children, Charles Horace Kenney (1857?&#150;1909) and Rosa A. Kenney (1860?&#150;1905), both had careers on the stage.<br>
