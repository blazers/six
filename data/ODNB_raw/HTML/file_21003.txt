<span class="headword">Owen,  Henry</span>  (1716&#150;1795), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and biblical scholar</span>, was born at the home of his father, William Owen, gentleman, at the foot of Cadair Idris, near Dolgellau, Merioneth. Nothing is known of his mother. He was educated at Ruthin School, Denbighshire, and entered Jesus College, Oxford, on 10 April 1736, and graduated BA (1739), MA (1743), MB (1746), and MD (1753). He was ordained deacon and priest in 1746, and practised medicine for three years while a curate in Gloucestershire before giving it up because &#145;neither his feelings nor his health would suffer him to continue the profession&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 2.433). He served as curate to Sir Ralph Thoresby in Stoke Newington, Middlesex, both before, and then simultaneously upon, his presentation to the vicarage of Terling, Essex, in 1752, the gift of Sir Matthew Featherstonehaugh, whose chaplain he had been. He resigned Terling in 1760, when presented to the London rectory of St Olave, Hart Street, by the trustees of Sir Andrew Pickard. He married, on 3 September 1760, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1804), daughter of Robert Butts, bishop of Norwich. Shortly after he became chaplain to Shute Barrington, then bishop of Llandaff, who presented him to the vicarage of Edmonton, Middlesex, in 1775, which he held by a special dispensation along with St Olave's.<br>
<br>Though he began his literary career with a mathematical treatise, <span class="italic">Harmonica trigonometrica</span> (1748), and was elected to a fellowship of the Royal Society, Owen's principal publications were in the field of biblical criticism, to which he had devoted himself even when preparing for his MD. His <span class="italic">Observations on the Four Gospels</span> (1764) was a rather conservative account of the dating and nature of the gospels; more detailed and critical observations were left for <span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Present State of the Septuagint Version of the Old Testament</span> (1769), in which he was critical of the corruptions made to the texts by Jewish and Christian commentators, and called for a collation of all these variations in order to secure a reliable version that would meet the challenge otherwise made to its authority by critics of Christianity. He met the criticisms made of his approach by a Jewish scholar, Raphael Baruch, in his <span class="italic">Supplement to critica sacra</span> (1775), and produced an edition of the Cottonian manuscript of <span class="roman">Genesis</span> as edited by Grabe, <span class="italic">Collatio codicis Geneseos cum editione Romana</span>, in 1778. He continued this work, which he saw as a parallel to that of Benjamin Kennicott on the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, in <span class="italic">A Brief Account, Historical and Critical, of the Septuagint Version of the Old Testament</span> (1787). He also edited two works by friends as acts of piety: an edition of Xenophon's <span class="italic">Memorabilia</span> (1785), which had been left unfinished by Edward Edwards of Jesus College, Oxford, and a new, corrected edition of an antiquarian work on Anglesey by Henry Rowlands, <span class="italic">Mona antiqua restaurata</span> (1766), with notes by Lewis Morris, which Owen dedicated to Richard Fitzwilliam, sixth Viscount Fitzwilliam of Merrion.<br>
<br>Owen was preoccupied with defending Christianity against its enemies on the basis of two of the most favoured grounds for such apologetic in eighteenth-century England: the proofs of miracles and of prophecy, both of which drew on his biblical researches. He first defended the miracles recorded in the <span class="roman">Old</span> and <span class="roman">New</span> testaments as the rational superintendence of events overseen by the &#145;correcting hand of Providence&#146; in <span class="italic">The Intent and Propriety of the Scripture-Miracles Considered and Explained</span>  (1755; p. 71); he developed these arguments as Boyle lecturer, from 1769 to 1771, and published his lectures in 1773 under the same title as his earlier treatise. He was particularly concerned to refute David Hume, whose style he especially hated, denouncing &#145;our fastidious author &hellip; the mere arrogance of an insulting sarcarsm &hellip; this contemptuous adversary &hellip; the sophistry of his reasonings&#146;  (H. Owen, <span class="italic">The Intent and Propriety of the Scripture-Miracles</span>, 1773, 53). Owen's appeal was to testimony and history; he was indebted for his more philosophical arguments to Joseph Butler's <span class="italic">Analogy</span>. His defence of prophecy was also firmly historical in character, and appeared in 1789, with an impressive list of subscribers that included both archbishops and many heads of houses in Oxford and Cambridge, as <span class="italic">The Modes of Quotation used by the Evangelical Writers Explained and Vindicated</span>. Admitting that his argument might already appear old-fashioned, Owen made a detailed examination of the relationship between the prophecies of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> as these were fulfilled in the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, thereby satisfying himself that he had undone the chief objection to the Christian religion made by its enemies. In the same treatise he made certain of his moderate position by insisting that &#145;as I always disliked polemical divinity; so I am now especially too old to dispute about religion; and I live only for the hope it inspires&#146;  (H. Owen, <span class="italic">The Modes of Quotation</span>, v). This position was also apparent in a work that he had written for the instruction of non-university-educated clergy, <span class="italic">Directions for young students in divinity, with regard to those attainments, which are necessary to qualify them for holy orders</span> (1766), a work that also demonstrated why he had given up medicine for the church in his claim that:<blockquote>it is as far superior to all other professions, as the soul is superior to the body. For other professions relate only to the concerns of the body for the short term of its mental state: whereas this is employed in promoting the welfare and happines of the soul through the endless ages of eternity. (p. 2)</blockquote>He was close to the pious printer William Bowyer, who brought out many of his works, as did Bowyer's associate John Nichols, who praised Owen warmly in both his <span class="italic">Literary Anecdotes</span> and his <span class="italic">Literary Illustrations</span>.<br>
<br>Owen died on 14 October 1795 at his vicarage in Edmonton, Middlesex, where he was also buried; he was survived by his wife, who died at Bromley College on 18 June 1804, his son, Henry Butts Owen, to whom he had resigned the living of St Olave's in April 1794, and five daughters. Owen's life was dedicated to scholarship rather than to gaining preferment, as Nichols observed: &#145;Dr. Owen had, through his long and useful life, no other preferment &hellip; but he had a truly great and pious frame of mind&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 2.435). It was in order to provide for his five daughters that his son brought out an edition of Owen's sermons in 1797, noting that it was not worldly prosperity that his father had sought, as he had dedicated his life instead &#145;to the interests of sacred learning, and the advancement of Christian virtue&#146;  (H. Owen, <span class="italic">Sixteen Sermons on Various Subjects</span>, 1797, vi). A subscription list that covers some forty-six pages and contains the names of many divines and fellows of colleges is testimony to Owen's reputation for learning; the cultivation of Christian virtue was central to the message contained in the sermons, the last of which was a notably admonitory piece originally preached on a fast day during the war with revolutionary America.<br>
