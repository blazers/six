<span class="headword">Garscadden,  Kathleen Mary Evelyn</span>  (1897&#150;1991), <span class="occ">radio broadcaster</span>, was born on 18 February 1897 at 13 Nithsdale Gardens, Crossmyloof, Glasgow, the daughter of George Garscadden, accountant and businessman, and his wife, Maggie Jane Vint. She was educated at Hutchesons' Girls' Grammar School, Glasgow, before moving to London to train as a professional singer under Sir Henry Wood. She did not pursue her goal of becoming an opera singer and returned to Glasgow.<br>
<br>Garscadden's broadcasting career began when she acted as a singer, pianist, and announcer on her father's amateur radio station (5MG), located at 141 Bath Street, Glasgow. This station was later bought by the BBC when opening its first Scottish station (5SC) on 6 March 1923 at 202 Bath Street, the location of her father's business premises. Garscadden was invited by Herbert Carruthers (the BBC's first station director in Scotland, and organist in the church choir in which she sang) to join the BBC as a programme assistant in 1923. She sang in concerts and was involved in schools broadcasting, but the primary outlet for her talents was <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span>, which was broadcast daily at 5 p.m. BBC local stations were also opened in Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and Dundee, transmitting their own children's programmes. Broadcasting was local because of the limited power of the transmitters.<br>
<br>In the early years BBC staff became the friendly unseen &#145;aunts&#146; and &#145;uncles&#146; to young listeners. Garscadden was originally referred to as Auntie Cyclone by her fellow broadcasters because she sometimes read the weather forecasts. She was accompanied by Uncle Bert (Herbert Carruthers), Uncle Mungo (Mungo Dewar), and Uncle Alex (A. H. S. Paterson). She recalled that the BBC disapproved of her being called Auntie Cyclone because it was thought this might confuse children, and so she later became known simply as Auntie Kathleen. Her popularity turned her into a public celebrity. Crowds gathered at the studio to obtain her autograph, and she received a large volume of correspondence from listeners.<br>
<br>Garscadden retained vivid recollections of the excitement at hearing her voice transmitted from the studio in Bath Street. She produced serial plays, including the Scottish version of <span class="italic">Toytown</span>, and was also involved in the Radio Circle, a forerunner of Children in Need, which helped children's charities and kept the BBC in contact with its young listeners. On 1 November 1928 the Edinburgh and Dundee stations began to take <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span> from Glasgow, which Garscadden presented. The programme became an important fixture in the programme schedules because the BBC recognized that young listeners constituted its future adult audience. Garscadden believed in the Reithian concept that radio could be used to inform and educate, not just to entertain the audience. The coverage of music, literature, history, art, geography, and natural history was certainly appreciated by the programme's young and not so young audience&#151;in many homes the family listened together.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of the Second World War regional programme services disappeared and were replaced by a single Home Service from London, in which Scotland contributed material to <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span>. In 1940 Garscadden was appointed as <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span> organizer for Scotland, a post she held until her retirement. Favourite serials first broadcast during the war years included <span class="italic">Tammy Troot</span> and <span class="italic">Down at the Mains</span>. A separate fifty-minute Scottish <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span> was restored after the war with the introduction of the Scottish Home Service on 29 July 1945. Programme output was wide-ranging and included dramatized adaptations of classics, outside broadcasts, features on famous Scots, and music from the Glasgow Orpheus Choir. Wireless created many radio personalities, and Garscadden gave opportunities to aspiring actors, musicians, comedians, and entertainers. Many went on to become household names within and beyond Scotland. They included the actors Gordon Jackson, Fulton MacKay, John Grieve, Molly Weir, and Tom Conti; singers such as Moira Anderson and Sydney Devine; the entertainers Stanley Baxter, Jimmy Logan, and Rikki Fulton; and the impressionist Janet Brown. Andrew Stewart, an early participant on <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span>, went on to become controller of BBC Scotland in 1957.<br>
<br>Garscadden retired in June 1960 after thirty-seven years' service with the BBC. On 1 July members of the Broadcasting Council for Scotland placed on record their warm appreciation of her outstandingly fine record of service. She left the BBC at a time when children's programmes on radio were being scaled down because of television's increasingly powerful counter-attraction. She returned to give a talk about her childhood in the final <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span> programme in 1964. She continued to sing and give piano lessons to children in her small flat at Victoria Place, Station Road, Milngavie, and also took part in occasional programmes. She was presented to the queen in 1983 at the diamond jubilee of BBC children's broadcasting.<br>
<br>Garscadden was unusual in having worked during her long career as a presenter, broadcaster, programme organizer, and producer. She helped to inform, inspire, and stimulate that boundless world of the imagination in children fostered by the intimacy of radio. Her vast programme output complemented the formal work of the classroom. She conveyed her love of children over the years, and was a natural broadcaster who adhered to high professional standards. She was a legendary character in Scottish broadcasting, discovering many well-known personalities and endearing herself to generations of young listeners. She died of haematemesis at the Western Infirmary, Glasgow, on 20 February 1991 and was cremated at Clydebank crematorium, North Dalnottar, on 27 February. She was unmarried.<br>
