<span class="headword">Lucar,  Cyprian</span>  (1544&#150;1611?), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born in London, the eldest of several sons and a daughter of Emanuel Lucar (1494&#150;1574) and his second wife, Joan, daughter of Thomas Turnbull. Emanuel Lucar's forebears had their roots in the west country but he and his family lived in the parish of St Botolph, Billingsgate, in the city of London. He was an active and generous member of the Merchant Taylors' Company and its master in 1560&#150;61, the year in which Merchant Taylors' School was founded. He was one of the merchants who by Protector Somerset's order accompanied the lord mayor to Greenwich in support of a plot to place Lady Jane Grey on the throne, but suffered no punishment under Queen Mary for this act. He was a juryman at the trial of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton for complicity in the insurrection led by Sir Thomas Wyatt the younger in 1554, which sought to prevent the marriage of Mary with Philip of Spain. Throckmorton was found not guilty and in consequence the jurymen were summoned to the Star Chamber and committed to prison, Emanuel Lucar to the Tower of London, to be released on payment of &pound;1000 fine, his fellow jurymen to the Fleet.<br>
<br>Cyprian Lucar was admitted scholar of Winchester College in 1555 and was at New College, Oxford, in 1561&#150;3. In 1568 he entered Lincoln's Inn. He was still living with his widowed mother, brothers, and sisters in St Botolph's Lane at the time when he and Richard Madox paid a visit to Robert Norman, about 1581, to see his new magnetic dipping needle. The date of his marriage to Joan is unknown. She survived him, as did their son Anthony, who entered the Middle Temple, and his brother Mark, who succeeded to family property in Somerset.<br>
<br>In 1588 Lucar published <span class="italic">Three Bookes of Colloquies concerning the Arte of Shooting in Great and Small Peeces of Artillerie</span>, a translation of the first systematic treatise on ballistics written by Niccol&ograve; Tartaglia in 1537. Lucar himself contributed an appendix, somewhat longer than the original Italian text, containing allied material from some twenty continental and five English authors. In fact Lucar had been anticipated by William Bourne, whose <span class="italic">Arte of Shooting in Great Ordnaunce</span> (1587) was based on Tartaglia. Lucar also produced <span class="italic">A Treatise Named Lucarsolace</span>, a small volume on current surveying practice, illustrating the instruments and methods used, and including aspects of estate management. It was dedicated to William Roe, alderman of London, who had married Lucar's sister.<br>
<br>Lucar's death probably occurred in 1611; his will, proved that year, described him as &#145;of Isleworth in Middlesex&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/118). In it he requested that he be buried in St Botolph, Billingsgate, alongside his parents.<br>
