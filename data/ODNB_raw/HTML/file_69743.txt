<span class="headword">Wyndham, Sir  Hugh</span>  (1624&#150;1671), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest son of Sir Edmund Wyndham MP (1600/01&#150;1681) of Kentsford, St Decumans, Somerset, and his first wife, Christabella (<i>d</i>. 1658), daughter of Hugh Pyne MP of Cathanger, Somerset. His mother was governess to the infant Prince Charles, which led to later comments that Wyndham was Charles II's &#145;foster brother, they both sucked the same milk&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 7020, fol. 38). Wyndham was an active royalist in the civil war, receiving a knighthood at some date before 21 July 1645. He was captured at the siege of Bridgwater in 1645, and may possibly have entered Trinity College, Cambridge, on 8 October 1646. If he did enter the university, he soon abandoned his studies, for in April 1649 he was on board <i>The Guinea</i> when it was captured. Wyndham seems to have been disguised as a common sailor, and escaped to resume his royalist activities on board the <i>Santa Teresa</i>. When this ship was captured, he was sent to Pendennis Castle charged with high treason. While a captive he met his future wife, Joan (1631&#150;1694), daughter of Sir Francis Drake, first baronet, whom he married on 4 February 1650 at Buckland. The Drakes had important parliamentarian connections and Wyndham was able to compound for his estates, selling a small parcel of land before paying off the fine in January 1652. Wyndham was not involved in royalist plotting before the Restoration.<br>
<br>Wyndham was elected for Minehead at the 1661 general election. He was an opponent of religious toleration and in 1664 he was noted as a court adherent. On 16 October 1667 Wyndham complained to the Commons about the conduct of Lord Chief Justice Kelyng at the Somerset assizes. Wyndham, acting as chairman of the grand jury, and his fellow jurors were confronted by a case in which they found that a man had been killed <i>per infortunium</i> (through misfortune). Kelyng refused to accept this and ordered them to consider finding a bill either <i>billa vera</i> (well founded) or <i>ignoramus</i>. When the jury refused to alter their findings Kelyng fined some of them &pound;20 a man, and bound them to good behaviour and to appear before the king's bench. Wyndham replied that he would claim his privilege as an MP. The Commons investigated Wyndham's complaint, and on 13 December Kelyng was brought before the bar of the Commons. Upon hearing what Kelyng had to say Wyndham remarked that although the lord chief justice &#145;had given him some unhandsome passionate speeches, as that he was the head of a faction and that he would make [him] know he was now his servant&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of John Milward</span>, 169), since he had taken no notice of it in his defence he would forget it and forgive him. This no doubt helped the chief justice, for although the Commons passed resolutions affirming that the fining and imprisonment of jurors was illegal, it took no further action against the judge.<br>
<br>Wyndham remained a court supporter, remarking on 18 February 1668 that the new <span class="roman">Triennial Bill</span> was &#145;brought in, I had almost said with impudence&#146;  (Grey, 1.82) by Sir Richard Temple, third baronet. Following a petition of 10 December 1668 Wyndham was appointed customer of Bridgwater on 4 January 1669. Wyndham's father married for a second time in November 1669, and shortly beforehand he seems to have made over Kentsford to his son. Wyndham himself, however, was not a well man, and on 22 May 1671 his father wrote to Secretary of State Williamson informing him of his imminent journey to Somerset &#145;on account of the dangerous sickness of my son&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1671</i>, 260). Wyndham did not recover, dying on 20 July. He was buried at St Decumans, and his epitaph complained that he had &#145;lost fortune, blood [and] gained nought but scars&#146;  (Wyndham, 264) during his sufferings for the crown in the civil wars. His only son, Edmund, succeeded to the estate, dying childless in 1698.<br>
