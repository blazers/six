<span class="headword">Gray,  Henry</span>  (1826/7&#150;1861), <span class="occ">anatomist and author</span>, about whose family, childhood, and early education little is known except that his father was private messenger to George IV and William IV, and that he had one sister and two brothers, entered St George's Hospital, London, as a perpetual student in May 1845. There he showed early signs of his intense interest in anatomy and was described by his contemporaries as diligent, painstaking, and methodical. In 1848 he became MRCS (and soon became a fellow by examination) and in the following year was awarded the college's triennial prize for an essay on the nerves of the eye. He won the Astley Cooper prize in 1853.<br>
<br>In 1850, as a newly appointed house surgeon to St George's Hospital (where he later became lecturer in anatomy), Gray presented a paper to the Royal Society &#145;On the development of the optic and auditory nerves&#146;. This earned him the unusual distinction of being elected to a fellowship of the society at the age of twenty-five (1852). In 1854 he published <span class="italic">On the Structure and Use of the Spleen</span>, a substantial work of 380 pages, based on original observations. His famous <span class="italic">Anatomy, Descriptive and Surgical</span> (1858) was published by John W. Parker in England, and by Blanchard and Lea in the United States in 1859. No medical text has ever been so widely used by successive generations of medical students and doctors. By the time of its centenary, there had been twenty-six new editions by eight successive editors in Britain and eleven in the United States.<br>
<br>The success of the book was not due to an absence of rivals. There were already several texts on anatomy, the most famous being <span class="italic">Elements of Descriptive and Practical Anatomy</span> (1828) by James Quain. Gray's <span class="italic">Anatomy</span>, however, eclipsed all others, partly for its meticulous detail, partly for its emphasis on surgical anatomy, but most of all perhaps for the excellence of the illustrations, based on drawings by H. V. Carter, who assisted Gray with the dissections, and engraved by Messrs Butterworth and Heath with remarkable skill. The design of the book, and the skill with which the illustrations were interpolated in the text, could hardly have been improved. For a man in his early thirties it was a remarkable achievement. The book was well received by <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> and the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span>, but was savagely attacked by an anonymous reviewer in the <span class="italic">Medical Times and Gazette</span> of 1859, who dismissed it, in a ridiculous review for which the most likely reason was personal animosity or jealousy, as &#145;a book which is not wanted [and] is not even up to the mark of the existing vade-mecums. A more unphilosophical amalgam of anatomical detail and crude surgery we have never met with&#146;.<br>
<br>Gray was already working on the second edition when he caught smallpox from his nephew, developed the confluent form of the disease, and died at his residence, 8 Wilton Street, Belgrave Square, London, on 12 June 1861, aged thirty-four. It is a measure of Gray's single-minded devotion to anatomy and authorship that Gray's <span class="italic">Anatomy</span> continued to be not only an important book of reference but virtually a household phrase.<br>
