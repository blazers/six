<span class="headword">Cust,  Aleen Isabel</span>  (1868&#150;1937), <span class="occ">veterinary surgeon</span>, was born on 7 February 1868 at Cordangan Manor, co. Tipperary, Ireland, the fourth of six children of Sir Leopold Cust, baronet (1832&#150;1878), land agent, and his wife, Charlotte Sobieske Isabel (1835&#150;1914), daughter of Vice-Admiral Charles Orlando Bridgeman. Aleen was the granddaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6973/', "Sir Edward Cust (1794&#150;1878)")</script>. On the death of her father in 1878, her mother and Major Shallcross Fitzherbert Widdrington of Newton Hall, Northumberland, became her joint guardians. Aleen became a close friend of the Widdringtons, who recognized her independent spirit and gave her the moral support that she did not receive from her family. After a private education Aleen began training as a nurse at the London Hospital, but she gave it up and decided to become a veterinary surgeon. Her family disapproved, but she had a modest private income and in 1894, at the age of twenty-six, she proceeded to Edinburgh, adopted the surname Custance to avoid further embarrassment to her family, and for the next five years had a frugal existence as a student. Having spent the first year in gaining qualifications for entry, she was admitted to the New Veterinary College, Edinburgh (the school founded by William Williams in 1873, not to be confused with the New Edinburgh Veterinary College which John Gamgee founded in 1858 or the Edinburgh Veterinary College founded by William Dick in 1823). She eventually went on to qualify as Britain's first woman veterinary surgeon.<br>
<br>Aleen was a distinguished student, first in her classes and a gold medal winner in her first year. In May 1897 she was due to sit the first of her professional examinations but on receiving an application from Miss Custance the examinations committee of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons decided they did not have the power to admit women to their examinations. The council of the college was divided on the matter and when the minutes of the meeting were published in the <span class="italic">Veterinary Record</span> of 24 April 1897 the profession at large took up the debate. The college took counsel's opinion; they were advised not to admit the lady and to invite her to issue a writ of <i>mandamus</i>. Aleen wanted the proceedings to be held in Scotland but the college refused and she took it no further. She completed her training in 1900, and although she could not call herself a veterinary surgeon Professor Williams gave her a testimonial and recommended her for a post as an assistant to William Augustine Byrne (1865&#150;1910), who was in practice in co. Roscommon, Ireland. Byrne had qualified the previous year at the Royal Veterinary College, London, and on inheriting Castlestrange, a castle in Athleague, he set up in practice there. He was an engaging personality, handsome, witty, and popular both socially and professionally. The arrival of Miss Cust as his assistant caused consternation and scandalized the priesthood, but her competence and poise won her respect. There is reason to believe that they lived as man and wife and that she had two daughters, born in Scotland, who were later adopted. Aleen never married, though in 1904 she was engaged to Bertram Widdrington, son of her guardian.<br>
<br>As Aleen's reputation grew she became more widely accepted by the profession, but in 1905 she was again in conflict with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. She had been appointed by Galway county council to the part-time, official post of veterinary inspector under the <span class="roman">Diseases of Animals Act</span>. The college opposed the appointment because she was not a member, and the Irish department of agriculture would not approve it. The post had to be re-advertised, but when the county council again appointed Miss Cust the department agreed to a provisional arrangement whereby she was designated an &#145;inspector&#146;, but not a &#145;veterinary inspector&#146;. At that time she was living in Ballygar, several miles from Athleague, presumably in practice on her own account. When Byrne died in 1910 she took over his practice, which she ran from Fort Lyster, a house in Athleague. She made her visits riding side-saddle on an Arab stallion, or driving one of her several horses in a gig. When the day's work was done she would dress formally for dinner, and be waited on by her servants.<br>
<br>In 1915 Aleen left Ireland to offer her services during the First World War. She drove her own car to Abbeville in France and attached herself to an establishment of the Young Men's Christian Association. The probable reason for her going there was because it was close to the headquarters of the army veterinary and remount services. The hard-pressed veterinary corps was handling tens of thousands of horses in transit to and from the front, and it may be surmised that Aleen was keen to volunteer her considerable veterinary experience with horses, albeit unofficially. The records of her war service are sparse but there is one reference to Miss Cust in the war diary of Brigadier-General Garrat and another in the diary of Major-General Sir John Moore, the director of veterinary services in France. War Office records show that she was in the Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps from 14 January 1918 to 10 November 1918.<br>
<br>With the passing of the <span class="roman">Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act</span> of 1919, which forbade the exclusion of women from the professions, the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons could no longer refuse to consider Aleen Cust for membership. On receiving her application the examinations committee had the courtesy to require that she attend only the oral part of the final examination. She was awarded her diploma of membership on 21 December 1922, twenty-two years after completing her training in Edinburgh. Aleen had returned to Athleague after the war but was no longer welcomed in what became the Irish Free State, and in 1924 she retired to Plaitford in the New Forest. In the autumn of 1936, when her health was failing, she planned to spend the winter with friends in Jamaica. She arrived on 5 January 1937 but died on Kingston Island, probably of a heart attack, on the 29th, and was buried there.<br>
