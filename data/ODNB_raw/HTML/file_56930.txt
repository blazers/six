<span class="headword">Mawe,  John</span>  (1766&#150;1829), <span class="occ">mineralogist and dealer in minerals</span>, was born in Queen Street, Derby, the younger surviving son of Samuel Maw (1735&#150;1783), baker, and his first wife, Elisabeth Massey (<i>d</i>. 1777), originally from Leeds. He became a mariner in the late 1770s, and in 1790 he was appointed commander of the merchant vessel <i>Trent</i>, trading to St Petersburg. By 1821 he had visited Morocco, Jamaica, Bombay, and Tellicherry and once &#145;sounded on a coral reef in &hellip; Mozambique&#146;  (Mawe, <span class="italic">Companion</span>, 23). However, with the coming of the Napoleonic wars, he began &#145;finding a sea-faring life hazardous&#146; and &#145;after a favourable voyage &hellip; left off going to sea, and with other business, commenced collecting minerals and shells&#146;  (ibid., v).<br>
<br>In 1793 Mawe was briefly apprenticed to the Derby marble mason Richard Brown (1736&#150;1816), whose daughter, Sarah, he married in London on 1 November 1794<a href="#cosubject_56930"> [<i>see below</i>]</a>. They settled at 5 Tavistock Street, Covent Garden, trading as Brown, Son, and Mawe, mineral dealers, in a new &#145;petrifaction warehouse&#146; partnership.<br>
<br>The business's first surviving catalogue was issued about 1798. By 1799 Mawe was reported by a rival dealer as having &#145;been very successful &hellip; [and] a very busy man&#146;  (Elizabeth Forster to Philip Rashleigh, 9 Aug 1799, Rashleigh MSS). Certainly his activity in this period appears to have been frenetic. In 1800 he collected stratigraphically arranged specimens from Derbyshire for the cabinet of Charles IV (1748&#150;1819) of Spain, advised on the mineral exploration of New South Wales, and undertook a long mineral-hunting tour of the Scottish highlands. In 1802 the business moved to St Helens, Derby, where technologically advanced machinery for grinding and polishing stone and marble was installed. In the same year Mawe published his <span class="italic">Mineralogy of Derbyshire</span>, and visited Paris during the brief peace of Amiens. There he attended lectures at the &Eacute;cole des Mines and visited many of the leading French mineralogists, but struggled with the language, recording that he &#145;would rather go an East India voyage as a sailor &hellip; than &hellip; learn French&#146;  (Turner, 2.209). By 1804 Mawe claimed that collectors would &#145;find the largest Variety of Minerals and Shells in Europe&#146;  (Mawe, <span class="italic">Catalogue</span>, 1804) at his Covent Garden shop. In that year he also issued <span class="italic">A short treatise addressed to gentlemen visiting the south seas &hellip; with a view to encouraging the collecting of natural history</span>, which in later editions appeared as the entertaining <span class="italic">Voyager's Companion</span> (1821).<br>
<br>On 1 August 1804 Mawe set off on an ambitious voyage of commercial experiment to South America. In 1809 he was allowed by the prince regent of Portugal, later John VI (1769&#150;1826), to travel inland to the gold and diamond mining districts of Brazil, which were at the time closed to other Europeans by the Portuguese government. Mawe's many crises and adventures there were recorded in his best-selling <span class="italic">Travels in the Interior of Brazil</span> (1812), which went through several English editions, was translated into eight other European languages, and was on board the <i>Beagle</i> with Charles Darwin. However, the book caused later problems for other European visitors: members of the Portuguese government thought that many of the facts revealed should have remained unrecorded and so once again restricted access to the mining districts.<br>
<br>Mawe returned to London in 1810. In 1812 he opened a new shop at 149 Strand, close to Leigh and Sothebys auction rooms&#151;an important source of specimens. From this shop Mawe issued a series of publications, some in many editions, including <span class="italic">A Treatise on Diamonds</span> (1813), <span class="italic">Descriptive Catalogues of Minerals</span> (1815), <span class="italic">Familiar Lessons on Mineralogy and Geology</span> (1819), and <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Study of Conchology</span> (1822). He also opened a &#145;museum&#146; as a retail outlet in Matlock in 1815 and, following the death of his partner, another at Cheltenham in 1816, this time in partnership with his new son-in-law, Anthony Tissington Tatlow (1789&#150;1828). Nevertheless, Mawe still found time to travel in search of new specimens, as to Devon and Cornwall in 1817, and exchanged mineral specimens with Goethe in 1817&#150;18. He was elected a member of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall in 1814 and was awarded the diploma of the Jena Mineralogischen Gesellschaft in 1817. He was involved both in mining lead and in abortive attempts to set up the Derbyshire Mining and Peak Mining associations in 1825. Mawe died on 26 October 1829 at his shop in London, having helped establish commercial mineralogy in Britain. The identity of the executor of his will, Walter MacDowall (1796&#150;1865), London printer of his books, suggests that Mawe's publications were as important to him as his commercial success. Mawe was buried at St Mary-le-Strand on 2 November 1829.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_56930"></a><span class="headword">Sarah Mawe <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Brown]</span></span>  (<em>bap. </em>1767, <em>d.</em> 1846), <span class="occ">mineralogist and dealer in minerals</span>, was baptized at All Saints, Derby, on 9 June 1767, the daughter of Richard Brown and his wife, Ann Hind. Sarah Mawe often took charge of the London shop while her husband was away for long intervals. She became a highly competent mineral appraiser, purchaser, and identifier in her own right, and supplier of shells and fossils to naturalists in Europe and North America. While John Mawe was in South America, Henry Heuland, a rival dealer in London, wrote to the mineral collector Philip Rashleigh, &#145;dealers of Mineralogy in a few years will be very thin in this capital, and Mrs and Mr Maw will be the moon that shines on the Collectors. Indeed that Lady is quite grand now&#146;  (letter, 20 Dec 1808, Rashleigh MSS).<br>
<br>Sarah Mawe continued the business long after her husband's death. She was appointed mineralogist to Queen Victoria on the queen's accession in 1837 and continued to run the shop until 1840, when her old assistant James Tennant became sole proprietor. She died on 10 September 1846 in her Strand house, leaving a considerable estate, and was buried at St Giles's Church, Northampton. The Mawes had two children but their only son, John Saint Mawe (1797&#150;1820), died aged only twenty-two; Sarah requested in her will that she should be buried alongside him.<br>
