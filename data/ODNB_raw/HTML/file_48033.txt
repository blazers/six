<span class="headword">Mansfield,  Edward Dillon</span>  (1845&#150;1924), <span class="occ">headmaster</span>, was born on 12 February 1845, at Bathwick, Bath, Somerset, the eldest son of the Revd Joseph Mansfield, rector of Blandford St Mary, Dorset, and his wife, Emily (<i>n&eacute;e</i> le Poer Trench). He entered Marlborough College in August 1856, joining C.I. house (the former &#145;Castle Inn&#146; before the school's development). He left Marlborough in September 1864 and in the following month entered Trinity College, Oxford, where his father had been a member. He obtained a pass BA in 1867 (MA 1877). Mansfield became an assistant master at Clifton College, Bristol, in 1874. Appointed third form master, he became in the same year the inaugural master of the preparatory school, a post he held until 1883 when he left to become headmaster of Lambrook School, Bracknell, a private preparatory school founded by R. J. Burnside in 1860. He married Muriel Edith Campbell-Ross; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34862/', "Sir John Maurice Mansfield")</script> was their son.<br>
<br>Mansfield's success at Lambrook, where he set out to test his ideas of education, established his reputation among his fellow preparatory school headmasters. He was an outstanding leader in the affairs of the Association of Preparatory Schools (APS), the precursor of the Incorporated Association of Preparatory Schools, where he promoted his liberal and progressive ideas in the teaching of young boys. A sturdy champion of the reform of the curriculum and a critic of too early specialization, he played an important role in the negotiations with the public schools for the institution of the common entrance examination in 1904, being appointed with Herbert Bull to represent the APS on its board of management. It has been said that &#145;if Frank Ritchie [headmaster of the Beacon school, Sevenoaks] devised the machinery of the examination, Mansfield was the guiding spirit&#146;. With the help of Charles Darnell (of Cargilfield School, Edinburgh) he was also responsible for the setting up, in 1897, of the Oxford diploma course, run by M. W. Keatinge for the training of preparatory-school masters who were without a qualification.<br>
<br>Opinion varies concerning Mansfield's personality: he was said by some to be aloof but by others he was seen to be good with both boys and staff, showing understanding of their problems but showing &#145;no mercy to the shirker and evil doer&#146;. His teaching was of a high quality, being lucid in explanation, and he was capable of understanding boys' rudimentary problems. He was not in favour of the boys' use of translations and was himself a well-known writer of school books. He co-edited with Evelyn Abbott, a fellow Cliftonian master, a Greek grammar (1877), which went through several editions. He was a keen sportsman and played with, and coached, his boys at both cricket and rugby football, which he regarded as &#145;the cure for all boyish ailments&#146;. He was also a craftsman, and expert at wood-carving; he ensured that the boys, through the school curriculum, were encouraged to work in wood.<br>
<br>Mansfield retired from Lambrook School in 1904 and threw himself into local politics, becoming an alderman of Berkshire county council and a member of its education committee. He sat on governing bodies of secondary schools and the council of the University of Reading. He died on 10 November 1924 at his home at Pucks Wood, Finchampstead, Berkshire, survived by his wife.<br>
