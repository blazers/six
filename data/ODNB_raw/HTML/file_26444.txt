<span class="headword">Stevenson,  William Bennet</span>  (<em>b. </em>1787?, <em>d.</em> after 1830), <span class="occ">writer on South America</span>, is thought to have been born in 1787 but nothing more is known of his early life or family. He landed on the coast of Chile in Araucan&iacute;a, which was still Indian territory, in early 1804, intending to travel through the country. At Arauco he was arrested on the pretext that war had broken out between Spain and England. He was transferred successively to Concepci&oacute;n, Callao, and Lima, where he was confined in gaol for eight months among common criminals. His liberty was gradually increased and he was permitted to live in Lima and to travel to adjacent provinces. In 1808 he became private secretary to Count Ruiz de Castilla, president and captain-general of the audiencia of Quito. In 1809 he joined a brief revolt in Quito against Spain, and in December 1810 was appointed governor of Esmeraldas province. In 1811 he was again imprisoned by the Spaniards, in Guayaquil, and he subsequently moved to Lima. In 1818 he became secretary to Lord Cochrane and participated in many of his naval operations in the cause of the independence of Chile and Peru. After twenty years' residence in South America he visited England about 1824, but returned to Peru about the end of 1825. Late in 1827 he arrived in Greece, where he started a potato plantation employing up to 1500 workers, but ill health forced him to leave Greece in the summer of 1828. He is presumed to have been alive in 1830, but the date and place of his death are unknown.<br>
<br>While in England, Stevenson published the results of his experiences in a three-volume work entitled <span class="italic">A Historical and Descriptive Narrative of Twenty Years' Residence in South America</span> (1825). He later published a pamphlet <span class="italic">On the Disturbances in South America</span> (1830). His book provided detailed descriptions of Lima and Valpara&iacute;so, and is of great value for the period of South American independence from Spain (1808&#150;23), and as a source on Cochrane's activities. W. H. Prescott made considerable use of it in his <span class="italic">History of the Conquest of Peru</span> (1847), and later Peruvian commentators have regarded the book as the most important socio-political document written by a traveller of the period. Translations into French and German were published in Paris and Weimar respectively in 1826 and in Spanish in Madrid in 1917.<br>
