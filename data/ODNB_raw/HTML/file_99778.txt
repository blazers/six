<span class="headword">Thomas,  Marjorie Gwendolen</span>  (1923&#150;2008), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born on 5 June 1923 at 144 Hastings Street, Sunderland, the daughter of Alfred Evan Thomas, marine engine draughtsman, and his wife, Christina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Neish. She moved to Oldham, Lancashire, with her parents at the age of two. Although born in the north-east of England, and brought up on the other side of the Pennines, she was of Welsh and Scottish descent. Her parents were amateur musicians and it was with her mother that she had her first piano lessons before transferring to William Walton's brother Noel. After attending Hulme and Manchester grammar schools for girls, she won a scholarship to study piano at the Royal Manchester College of Music in 1940. But at the beginning of her second term she transferred to singing and was taught by Elsie Thurston, later the teacher of Elisabeth Harewood. After graduating in 1944, she taught at Stockport High School for Girls, where one of her singing students was Joan Bakewell.<br>
<br>Thomas quickly made an impact in Manchester and soon came to the attention of John Barbirolli, the permanent conductor of the city's Hall&eacute; Orchestra. A passionate Elgarian, Barbirolli was always on the lookout for young singers who could do justice to Elgar's music. After auditioning for him in 1944, Thomas was engaged to sing Elgar's <span class="italic">Sea Pictures</span> at Manchester's Albert Hall under his baton that November. In December 1945 she was invited by Barbirolli's arch-nemesis Sir Thomas Beecham to sing the role of Konchakovna for a broadcast performance of Alexander Borodin's <span class="italic">Prince Igor</span> for the BBC. It was during those sessions at the corporation's Maida Vale studios that she met the sound engineer Edwin Robert James Gower (1902&#150;1982), the son of Robert Gower, mechanical engineer, whom she married (following his divorce from Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gold) on 5 June 1947.<br>
<br>Impressed by her performance in Borodin's opera, Beecham asked Thomas to sing a group of songs at his London Delius festival at the Central Hall, Westminster, in 1946, and to sing the contralto part for the second of his three <span class="italic">Messiah</span> recordings, which he documented for Columbia in 1947. The next year, she gave birth to her only child, Eileen, before taking a year off singing. Her absence from the concert platform did not harm her career, and in 1950 (retaining her maiden name for professional purposes) she sang the role of Nancy in Benjamin Britten's <span class="italic">Albert Herring</span> at the Cheltenham festival and the part of Dryade in Richard Strauss's <span class="italic">Ariadne auf Naxos</span> at the Glyndebourne festival, which she revived for the company in 1953, the same year that she sang in Sidney Gilliat's and Frank Launder's film <span class="italic">The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan</span>, starring Robert Morley and Maurice Evans.<br>
<br>In 1951 Thomas sang for Sir Malcolm Sargent for the first time. Captivated by her luminous vocal timbre, he engaged her immediately and went on to become her most decisive influence. He regularly used her for performances with the Royal and Huddersfield choral societies, and considered her his ideal interpreter for his orchestration of Brahms's <span class="italic">Four Serious Songs</span>. In 1954 he chose her for the part of the Angel for his critically acclaimed EMI recording of <span class="italic">The Dream of Gerontius</span> with the Huddersfield Choral Society and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra. She then went on to record with Sargent Handel's <span class="italic">Messiah</span> (twice), Mendelssohn's <span class="italic">Elijah</span>, Vaughan Williams's <span class="italic">Serenade to Music</span>, and <span class="italic">The Gondoliers</span>, <span class="italic">Iolanthe</span>, <span class="italic">The Mikado</span>, <span class="italic">The Yeoman of the Guard</span>, <span class="italic">HMS Pinafore</span>, <span class="italic">The Pirates of Penzance</span>, and <span class="italic">Patience</span> by Gilbert and Sullivan. Of Sargent, she said that &#145;his interpretations always had such elasticity. He was always prepared to give soloists a great deal of freedom in interpretation and one never felt rushed or dragged back&#146;  (Aldous, 54&#150;5), qualities that she considered essential in any conductor.<br>
<br>In 1953 Thomas sang the roles of the Rhinemaiden Flosshilde and the Valkyrie Rossweisse for Rudolf Kempe's much-praised reading of Wagner's <span class="italic">Der Ring des Nibelungen</span> at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. There, she later sang the part of Magdalene in <span class="italic">Die Meistersinger von N&uuml;rnberg</span> under Rafael Kubelik, with whom she recorded Mahler's symphony no. 3 with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra for Deutsche Grammophon in 1967. In 1954 she took part in the English Opera Group's staging of <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> at Sadler's Wells, and the following year she sang at EMI's first stereo session for Bach's cantata no. 6 with the Bach Choir under Reginald Jacques. In 1960 Benjamin Britten invited her to sing Hermia in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> at Aldeburgh, the Holland Festival, and Covent Garden, and in 1963 she represented Britain in a performance of Bach's B minor mass at the Vatican with other international artists to mark the accession of Pope Paul VI. Six years later she sang for the investiture of the prince of Wales at Caernarfon.<br>
<br>In December 1973 Thomas left the concert hall and the opera house. Fittingly, the last work that she sang publicly was Handel's <span class="italic">Messiah</span> with the Huddersfield Choral Society, a performance later described as &#145;unlikely to be forgotten by those present&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 9 Oct 2008). After returning to her alma mater in Manchester as a singing teacher, she was invited by Sir Thomas Armstrong to succeeded Astra Desmond as professor of singing at the Royal Academy of Music, London, where she was later appointed its first head of vocal studies in 1984. She retired from teaching in 1990 but took up a number of hobbies, including gardening, knitting, tapestry, and lace-making. She lived latterly at 121 Coleraine Road, Greenwich, and died in London on 12 September 2008, survived by her daughter.<br>
<br>Marjorie Thomas was one of Britain's most distinguished twentieth-century singers. At the peak of her career, she worked with many of the world's leading conductors and was often their first choice when engaging contraltos and mezzo-sopranos. Her velvety tone meant that she was ideally suited to oratorio singing and was renowned for her interpretations of the Angel in Elgar's <span class="italic">Dream of Gerontius</span> and the alto part in Handel's <span class="italic">Messiah</span>. Like her predecessors, Dame Clara Butt and Kathleen Ferrier, she was a role model for many young singers and was celebrated by audiences on both sides of the Atlantic.<br>
