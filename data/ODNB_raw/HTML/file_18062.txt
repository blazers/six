<span class="headword">Markaunt,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1382&#150;1439), <span class="occ">benefactor</span>, was the son of John Markaunt and his wife, Cassandria. Markaunt's name, prefixed &#145;m&#146; (<i>magister</i>), is found in the records of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in accounts datable to 1413/14 and sporadically thereafter. From 1437 to 1439 he is regularly listed in an order of seniority placing him immediately below the master. Fellowship at Corpus entailed being in priest's orders, but the degree of BTh (found in later histories) is unsubstantiated.<br>
<br>Markaunt served the university as senior proctor during the year 1417, as is known from his citation in 1418, by name and office, in a petition of complaint made by the mayor and commonalty of Cambridge against the university. A paper of crude verses had been affixed to the mayoral gate by unruly scholars, and Markaunt was involved in the university's defence and counter-complaints arising out of that and other incidents. He subsequently added all the relevant documents to the compendium of texts of university records (mainly statutes and privileges), which he had gathered and indexed for his personal reference during his term of office. The resulting volume, usually known as &#145;Markaunt's Book&#146;, is not unique of its kind, but is of exceptional interest as the earliest relating to the university to have survived, predating existing series of registers. Markaunt was one of four witnesses appearing for the university at the &#145;Barnwell process&#146; of 14 October 1430, his age at the time given as forty-eight years.<br>
<br>The death of Markaunt &#145;nuper consortis et confratris Collegii Corporis Christi&#146;  (Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, MS 232, fol. 17<i>r</i>) is recorded as 19 November 1439. His will, made on 4 November, is largely quoted in the deed of acceptance of his legacy by the college of 1 August 1440, endorsing the conditions set out by the testator for the future management of the books of his bequest. These were to be kept separately as a lending library for the use of the master and fellows. Detailed rules governed the choice of custodians, the order of the borrowers' selection, and the prayers they then recited. The scheme had similarities to those for contemporary (cash) loan chests, and within the college operated in parallel with one such recent endowment. A full inventory of the seventy-six books by number, title, and identifying incipit, with a valuation list roughly classified by subject, accompany the copy of the deed of agreement prefacing the register of borrowers proper. Markaunt's library seems to have been largely dispersed soon after the borrowing register was discontinued in 1517. Five volumes remain in the college, subsumed into Archbishop Parker's manuscript collection. Another survival, strayed from the college before Parker's time, is &#145;Markaunt's Book&#146;, now after many vicissitudes in the university archives. Although misunderstanding of its purpose subsequently won for its compiler an unfounded reputation as an antiquary, modern scholarship still remains lastingly indebted to Markaunt for his transcripts and the records of his library.<br>
