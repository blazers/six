<span class="headword">Forbes,  William</span>  (1668<span class="mult">x</span>71&#150;1745), <span class="occ">lawyer and jurist</span>, was born possibly in 1668 or between November 1670 and January 1671, the elder of two children of Thomas Forbes (1629&#150;1687) and his wife, Isabel (1635&#150;1715), daughter of David Edgar of Keithock, Forfarshire, and widow of James Pitcairn. Thomas Forbes was of an old Aberdeenshire family with good connections in the burgh and university of Aberdeen. He studied at Leiden and Padua and was professor of philosophy in the University of Pisa from 1658 to 1659 and of medicine there from 1659 to 1662, before returning to Scotland.<br>
<br>Details of Forbes's early education are unknown; however, he did graduate AM from a university, probably St Andrews as a William Forbes matriculated at St Salvator's College there in 1685 and Thomas Forbes moved to St Andrews between January 1684 and May 1685, but the evidence is circumstantial. On 28 October 1688 a William Forbes, noted as a Scot aged twenty, matriculated at the University of Leiden. In 1690 Forbes prepared to compete for the position of regent in philosophy at Edinburgh, but was frustrated by ill health. He may then have remained in Edinburgh or returned to the Netherlands to study law; he was certainly in Edinburgh in 1694, when he prepared his mother's poll tax return. On 15 February 1696 he was admitted as a member of the Faculty of Advocates.<br>
<br>On 25 January 1700 Forbes married Margaret, the daughter of Alexander Lindsay, an Edinburgh wool merchant. The couple had two children: Thomas (<i>bap</i>. 1702), who became an advocate, and Janet (<i>bap</i>. 1708), who married Alexander Carmichael, a landowner in Leith. By February 1700 Forbes had been appointed an examinator of the Faculty of Advocates. He was clerk of faculty from January 1702 to January 1703, and joint clerk from November 1705 until the end of 1714. In 1705 the faculty agreed that Forbes should collect court of session decisions (eventually published as <span class="italic">A Journal of the Session</span> in 1714) and he was appointed joint keeper of the faculty library.<br>
<br>Following his marriage, financial pressure on Forbes may have led him to turn to writing: <span class="italic">A Methodical Treatise concerning Bills of Exchange &hellip; according to the Analogy of the Scots Law</span> appeared in 1703. The dedications and contents of the works show how Forbes tried to demonstrate his abilities not only to his colleagues but to politicians who he thought might be useful to him. <span class="italic">A Treatise of Church Lands and Tithes</span> (2 vols., 1705) and <span class="italic">The Duty and Powers of Justices of the Peace in this Part of Great Britain called Scotland</span> (2 pts, 1707&#150;8) were dedicated respectively to Sir Hew Dalrymple of North Berwick, lord president of the court of session, and his brother Sir David Dalrymple of Hailes, then solicitor-general. The latter work devoted special attention to the extended duties of justices regarding customs and excise following the union with England, and appeared at the same time as Forbes was seeking the new post of auditor of the exchequer to deal with excise-related questions. A further work concerned with the consequences of the union was <span class="italic">The Law of Election of Members of Parliament</span> (1710).<br>
<br>In 1708 Forbes had decided upon his major task, the writing of a:<blockquote>complete body of the law of Scotland, containing the harmony thereof with, and differences from the civil and feudal laws; and shewing how far the Scots and English law do agree and differ; with incident comparative views of the modern constitutions of other nations in Europe. (<span class="italic">Minute Book of the Faculty of Advocates</span>, 1.277)</blockquote>This book, &#145;The great body of the law of Scotland&#146;, was never published; the manuscript is in Glasgow University Library. However, Forbes's interest in comparing Scots with English law was well known and was a factor in his subsequent appointment at Glasgow.<br>
<br>In December 1713 Queen Anne assigned income in the sum of &pound;90 for the establishment of the chair of civil law at the University of Glasgow. Soundings about suitable candidates resulted in the report that &#145;Mr. William Forbes, Advocat &hellip; is Esteem'd a man very well skill'd in the Civil Law and Capable to teach the same, and &hellip; thought the fittest for that post&#146;  (<span class="roman">minutes of meetings of faculty</span>, 1701&#150;1717, 28 Jan 1714, U. Glas., Archives and Business Records Centre, MS 26632, 113). Among his strongest supporters at Glasgow was the rector, Sir John Maxwell of Pollock. Forbes was elected the university's first professor of civil law in February 1714. His teaching remit was identified as civil, feudal, canon, and Scots law.<br>
<br>On 18 February 1714 Forbes gave his inaugural lecture, on &#145;the nature, fortune, dignity, utility, and authority of the civil law&#146;. He followed this with a series of classes on &#145;the civil and Scottish laws&#146;, comparing Scots law with Roman law and explaining the contrast with English law. These were the first classes on Scots law to be taught in a university; previously Scots law, less prestigious than Roman law, had been taught privately by advocates in Edinburgh. His teaching on Scots law led to <span class="italic">The Institutes of the Law of Scotland</span>, published in two volumes in 1722 and 1730, the first dealing with private, the second with criminal law. However, attendance at his classes in Scots law seems to have been low; in 1716 he offered only civil law, and he had almost certainly given up Scots law by the 1730s.<br>
<br>Forbes's commitment to Scots law cannot be doubted but his professorship was controversial. He did not always teach at times required by the university, demanded full payment for teaching law to divinity students, and for some time feuded with his patron, Pollock, and the principal who had appointed him, John Stirling. He changed political allegiance several times, but by the 1730s had become an ally of Principal Neil Campbell and his patron, Archibald Campbell, earl of Ilay and manager of Scotland for Walpole. This possibly followed Campbell's appointment of Forbes's son, Thomas, as college advocate in 1728. Forbes was dean of the faculty from 1732 to 1734, and as library quaestor from 1736 to 1738 he acquired many Dutch and English texts. He represented the University of Glasgow at the general assembly of the Church of Scotland in Edinburgh in 1740. He died intestate at Glasgow on 27 October 1745, leaving &pound;4145, and 14,800 marks in bonds.<br>
