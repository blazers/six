<span class="headword">Kitson,  Alexander Harper</span>  (1921&#150;1997), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 21 October 1921 at Kirknewton, Midlothian, the son of Alexander Harper Kitson and his wife, Mary Lockhart, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Greig. His father, a lifelong trade unionist, had been a shale miner until, in the year Kitson was born, he was victimized after a lock-out; he then found a job in the coalmines but again, after the 1926 general strike, was blacklisted and hounded out of the industry. His mother's father, David Greig, was a railwayman and active in the National Union of Railwaymen at local and national level until he retired in 1937. With that family background the young Kitson grew up in a home that was dedicated to trade unionism and socialism&#151;and with the experience of economic deprivation and struggle.<br>
<br>Kitson went to the local elementary school at Kirknewton and left at fourteen to become a van boy with St Cuthbert's Co-operative Society in Edinburgh. The year was 1935, when high unemployment throughout Scotland meant that times were hard. Young Kitson had to cycle 15 miles to work every day, but there were few options. Two years later the Co-op moved him to a milk delivery round&#151;work that was organized by the Shop Assistants' Union, which Kitson joined immediately and in which, in the family tradition, he quickly became a shop steward. It was while he worked that milk round that Kitson met Tommy (later Sean) Connery (Big Tam, as he was known) who became his mate on the milk round. It was the beginning of a lifelong friendship between Kitson and Sean Connery, who later went on to a job as a scene-shifter at Edinburgh's King's Theatre, the first step on the ladder to Hollywood and fame as 007. Connery's father was then a member of the Scottish Horse and Motormen's Union, the organization Kitson was later to lead. Kitson moved from his job with the Co-op to take up work as a road haulage driver and joined the Horse and Motormen's Union. At the age of twenty-five he became a full-time official of the union&#151;the youngest the union had ever had. During the war he rose rapidly in the hierarchy of the Horse and Motormen. He wanted to join the navy but was rejected on medical grounds and was then conscripted under the wartime regulations of the Ministry of Labour to drive trucks carrying war supplies across the country. On 21 March 1942 he married Annie Brown (1921/2&#150;1997), a baker's confectioner and daughter of George Sutherland McLeod, a mason's labourer. There were two daughters of the marriage, Joyce and Irene.<br>
<br>By the early 1950s Kitson was a well-known figure at his union conferences, and in 1956 he was appointed national organizer. He was elected general secretary of the union three years later, in 1959. Six years after that he agreed to merge his union, with its 20,000 members, with the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU), then under the leadership of Jack Jones. The two men established a firm friendship and Jones appointed Kitson a senior executive officer of the TGWU in 1971. Effectively this placed Kitson as number three to Jones, with Harry Urwin as the deputy general secretary. Many observers then began to regard Kitson as a possible successor to Jones. But that did not happen. When Jones retired in 1977 Kitson fought Moss Evans for the succession but was heavily defeated by Evans. Yet that did not mar their relationship, and when Evans took over as general secretary he appointed Kitson as his deputy on the retirement of Urwin. Indeed when Evans became seriously ill in 1981 Kitson took over control of the TGWU and remained acting general secretary for a full year, holding the post during a critical biennial delegate conference of the union in that year.<br>
<br>Perhaps the most testing time for Kitson as number two in the TGWU was during the &#145;winter of discontent&#146; in 1978&#150;79, which eventually led to the fall of the Callaghan government and to Margaret Thatcher's premiership. Kitson worked closely with Evans, who later recalled Kitson's valiant attempt to avoid the worst impact of that period of intense industrial conflict. After weeks of the toughest negotiation with the road haulage employers at the end of December 1978, Kitson reached a compromise in the pay deal for the union's truck-drivers. He was convinced the deal would not only end the strike but much of the surrounding conflict as well. But the transport secretary, Bill Rodgers, vetoed the pay settlement. Kitson exploded and almost came to physical blows with the minister. To the end of his life Kitson held the view that had the Callaghan government allowed him to ratify that pay deal the industrial and political climate could have been transformed and the Callaghan government saved. Yet in some ways Kitson reached the high peak of his career in 1981, when he was acting general secretary of the TGWU and his union's representative on Labour's executive as well as chairman of the Labour Party that year. It was the year of the battle between Denis Healey and Tony Benn for the deputy leadership of the party. Unexpectedly Kitson steered his union vote away from Benn because, though well to the left, he had become persuaded that Benn and his followers might well destroy the Labour Party. With great political courage he led the union away from a vote for Benn&#151;probably the decisive factor in clearing the way for Healey.<br>
<br>By the time Kitson retired in 1986 he had completed an exceptional record of posts in the labour movement: twenty-one years a member of the Scottish TUC general council and its chairman in 1966, and seventeen years as a member of Labour's national executive and latterly head of its international committee. He was also a pioneering campaigner for Scottish devolution&#151;though not independence&#151;bolstered by his own claim that he had personally persuaded Harold Wilson to change course in the 1970s and support devolution, so launching the Labour Party in that direction. There was one serious blip on Kitson's record of delicate diplomatic balance between his left-wing politics and his pragmatism as a union leader. During a visit to Moscow in 1977 as a fraternal delegate from the Scottish TUC to celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the Soviet revolution, he was quoted in <span class="italic">Pravda</span> as declaring that the Soviets had done more to provide jobs for British workers than any British government that century. It was a declaration that landed Kitson in great trouble, not only with the British media but with his own party leaders in London. He was summoned back from Moscow on the orders of the Callaghan government. Somehow he managed to extricate himself from his troubles, though it always remained something of a mystery as to precisely how he escaped still greater embarrassment.<br>
<br>Outside trade unionism and politics Kitson's great love was the Heart of Midlothian Football Club, where he was chairman in 1993&#150;4. He became a justice of the peace and ended his life as chairman of the Lothian Region Transport Board, of which he had been a director since 1986. He died at the Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, on 2 August 1997, after a long battle against cancer. He was survived by his two daughters, his wife having predeceased him by a few weeks. His funeral was held at Warriston crematorium, Edinburgh, on 7 August 1997, and was attended by a host of Scottish Labour Party and trade union leaders.<br>
