<span class="headword">Postlethwayt,  James</span>  (1711&#150;1761), <span class="occ">writer on finance and demography</span>, was born on 29 April 1711 and baptized on 20 May at St Dunstan's, Stepney, Middlesex, the second son of John Postlethwayt (1671&#150;1729), victualler of Limehouse, and his wife, Rebecca, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Blundell (<i>b</i>. 1678). His elder brother was the noted economist and publicist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22599/', "Malachy Postlethwayt (1707&#150;1767)")</script>. He was educated at St Paul's School, London (<i>c</i>.1721&#150;9), and was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, on 25 June 1729. He left the university in 1732 without having graduated and entered the Middle Temple on 7 October 1734. By the mid-1750s he appears to have been acting as a personal clerk or secretary to the lord chancellor, Philip Yorke, first earl of Hardwicke, and as a trusted adviser to the duke of Newcastle, the future prime minister. It was probably through one of these connections that Postlethwayt was appointed one of the four chief clerks of the Treasury in July 1755, a post he retained until his death. On 9 September 1752 at St James's, Friern Barnet, Middlesex, he married Ann Escutt.<br>
<br>In 1759 he published <span class="italic">The history of the public revenue from the revolution in 1688 to Christmas 1753, with an appendix completing the same to Christmas 1758</span>. This work gained a considerable reputation during the second half of the eighteenth century as an authority for writers on the subject, containing as it did detailed summaries of annual supply, grants, and sinking fund accounts, together with short statements on &#145;the historical state of the Bank of England&#146; and &#145;of the South-Sea Company&#146;. It appears to have been extensively used by Sir James Steuart in <span class="italic">Principles of Political Economy</span> (1767; bk 4, pt 4, chap. 5) and by Adam Smith in <span class="italic">The Wealth of Nations</span> (1776; bk 5, chap. 3) and it remains one of the more valuable sources on the financial history of Great Britain for the period which it covers.<br>
<br>Also in 1759 Postlethwayt published <span class="italic">A comparable view of the diseases and ages, and a table of the probabilities of life, for the last thirty years</span>, which appeared as part 2 of <span class="italic">A Collection of the Yearly Bills of Mortality from 1657 to 1758, Inclusive</span> edited by Thomas Birch, then secretary of the Royal Society. Alongside other pieces, by John Graunt and Sir William Petty, Postlethwayt's study made a notable actuarial and demographic contribution to this work. Birch, together with George Bell, another writer on population, was one of those to elect Postlethwayt FRS on 7 February 1754; it is probable, therefore, that Postlethwayt was a contributor to this important collection at the invitation of Birch. Postlethwayt died on 6 September 1761 at Hatton Garden, London, where he had resided for at least the previous decade. He was buried on 11 September at St Andrew's, Holborn, and was survived by his wife.<br>
