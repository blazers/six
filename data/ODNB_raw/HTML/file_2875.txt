<span class="headword">Booth,  David</span>  (1766&#150;1846), <span class="occ">lexicographer and writer</span>, was born at Kinnettles, Forfarshire, on 9 February 1766. He was almost entirely self-taught, the whole amount paid by his father for his instruction being 18<i>d</i>. for one quarter at the parish school. In early life he was engaged in business, and for some years was manager of a brewery at Woodside, near Newburgh, Fife. Although the undertaking was not unsuccessful, his intellectual interests and love of literature led him to retire from it to become a schoolmaster at Newburgh.<br>
<br>Shortly before 1820 Booth moved to London, where, besides his involvement in general literary work, for several years he saw through the press the publications of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (SDUK). In 1818 he published <span class="italic">Tables of Simple Interest on a New Plan of Arrangement</span>, and in 1821 <span class="italic">The tradesman, merchant, and accountant's assistant, being tables for business in general on a new plan of arrangement</span>. He also turned to account his practical knowledge of brewing by writing for the SDUK <span class="italic">The Art of Brewing</span> (1829) and <span class="italic">The art of wine-making in all its branches, to which is added an appendix concerning cider and perry</span> (1834). The latter volume contains a description of the brewer's saccharometer, a device to which he had added a considerable number of refinements.<br>
<br>In 1806 Booth had published <span class="italic">An Introduction to an Analytical Dictionary of the English Language</span>. He was unable for some years to proceed further with the work, and the first volume of the dictionary, the only one published, appeared in 1830. Its special characteristics, as stated on the title-page, are that:<blockquote>the words are explained in the order of their natural affinity, independent of alphabetical arrangement; and the signification of each is traced from its etymology, the present meaning being accounted for when it differs from its former acceptation: the whole exhibiting, in one continual narrative, the origin, history, and modern usage of the existing vocabulary of the English tongue.</blockquote>An idea of Booth's idiosyncratic method of arrangement, which is not easy to follow, may be gathered from the following list of the first twelve words in their order of succession: microcosm, man, wife, woman, male, female, masculine, feminine, human, baron, virility, virtue. In its reductive ideas on etymology and word relationship Booth's work, like that of his contemporary Charles Richardson, shows the unfortunate influence of Horne Tooke, but lacking Richardson's mass of quotations had less value and little influence.<br>
<br>In 1831 Booth published <span class="italic">Principles of English Composition</span>, chapters 2&#150;4 being reprinted from the <span class="italic">Introduction to an Analytical Dictionary</span>, and in 1837 <span class="italic">Principles of English Grammar</span>. His other works include <span class="italic">Observations on the English Jury Laws in Criminal Cases</span> (1833), strongly condemnatory of the &#145;unanimous verdict&#146; system; <span class="italic">A letter to Rev. T. R. Malthus, being an answer to his criticism of Mr. Godwin's work on population</span> (1823); and <span class="italic">Eura and Zephyra, a Classical Tale, with Poetical Pieces</span> (1832). Dr Robert Blakey, who met Booth in October 1832 in Bloomsbury, recorded: &#145;He is one of the most extraordinary personages I have met for some time. He is not, I believe, five feet high, of very dark visage, eyes very red and watery, and presenting altogether an impish look&#146;. Blakey accepted Booth's invitation to have tea with him, and was somewhat shocked by his system &#145;of complete scepticism&#146; and his arguments against the Christian religion  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 75&#150;7).<br>
<br>Booth received a grant of &pound;50 from the Royal Bounty Fund, and was also assisted by the Literary Fund Society. He died at the house of his son-in-law, Mr J. G. Stuart, at Balgonie Mills, Fife, on 5 December 1846. He left a widow, one son, and two daughters.<br>
