<span class="headword">Goldstone, Sir  Frank Walter</span>  (1870&#150;1955), <span class="occ">trade unionist and politician</span>, was born on 7 December 1870 in Sunderland, the third son of Frederick Goldstone, stained-glass artist, and Sarah Trigg (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Blott). Educated at Diamond Hall council school in Sunderland, Goldstone became a pupil teacher in Sheffield and later trained at Borough Road Training College, Isleworth. In 1895 he married Elizabeth Alice Henderson of Whittingham, Northumberland; they had two children, a boy and a girl.<br>
<br>In 1891 Goldstone was appointed an assistant master at Bow Street council school in Sheffield, and continued to teach in that city until 1910. During those years he was also an active figure in the National Union of Teachers (NUT), being involved especially in a group within it, the National Federation of Class Teachers. This concerned itself with the remuneration of teachers, and Goldstone served as its president in 1902, and was also a founder and editor of its journal, the <span class="italic">Class Teacher</span>.<br>
<br>Elected to the executive committee of the NUT in 1904, Goldstone chaired its law committee two years later. He represented the union at meetings with the Board of Education and at meetings of the National Association of Education Committees. Increasingly influential within the NUT, he left teaching in 1910 to become a full-time official of the union, following his appointment as organization secretary. He subsequently held the two highest positions, as assistant secretary (1918&#150;1924), and as general secretary (1924&#150;1931).<br>
<br>Goldstone's political career began inauspiciously. He was selected Labour candidate for Sunderland shortly before the December 1910 election, a late replacement for R. J. Wilson (a prominent member of the Co-operative Society). He was nominally sponsored by the Fabian Society, but his expenses were paid by the NUT, which was not affiliated to the Labour Party. Goldstone consequently did not sign the party constitution. Although Ramsay MacDonald objected, party officials wanted to secure NUT support and so allowed the concession.<br>
<br>At the time of his election to parliament Goldstone's educational programme was summarized in a campaign leaflet: he stood for &#145;a national system of education with a free teaching profession; one register of teachers; increased salaries for rural and class teachers; an improved system of superannuation applied to all teachers working under local education authorities; a code of professional honour; a &#147;forward&#148; policy generally&#146;  (<span class="italic">DLB</span>). In 1911 he attacked the policies of Sir Robert Morant, the permanent secretary of the Board of Education, arguing that secondary schools and universities should be freely opened to all those who had the required ability. Down to 1914 Goldstone also pressed in the Commons for improved medical inspection for children and better educational facilities for disabled people, as well as promoting the 1914 bill to abolish the half-time system. In 1916 he was appointed to the departmental committee on juvenile education and employment (established by H. A. L. Fisher); and this recommended a standard school-leaving age of fourteen, with continuation classes for fourteen- to eighteen-year-olds. Goldstone also served on the departmental committee on scholarships and free places in 1918.<br>
<br>Goldstone was not a charismatic MP. He was overshadowed by other Labour figures in campaigns against &#145;boy labour&#146; and in favour of school meals and medical inspections. Keir Hardie none the less commented favourably on Goldstone's first session in parliament, when he criticized the government's <span class="roman">National Insurance Bill</span>. A reliable back-bencher and a good constituency MP, he asked pertinent questions and made careful speeches. On home rule he reflected the views of his many Irish-born constituents. As an MP for a shipbuilding constituency he managed to attack the arms race without advocating a small navy. He supported the war effort (working in the War Office) but continued to denounce militarism and xenophobia.<br>
<br>Such attributes made Goldstone an obvious choice for chief whip in 1916, when Arthur Henderson was appointed to the Board of Education in the coalition government. It helped that he was also mild, cheerful, and tactful. This allowed him in 1916 to raise the issue of Henderson's ambiguous position as both cabinet minister and secretary of the party, and to do so without attacking Henderson directly or focusing on the limited time which he devoted to educational issues. He was a member of the speaker's conference on the franchise, which supplied the blueprint for the 1918 <span class="roman">Reform Act</span>. He sat on the Burnham standing joint committee, which created a payments scale for teachers; the Tomlin commission on the civil service, which reported in 1931; and the joint committee of mayors and voluntary agencies, which administered the Miners' Relief Fund in the late 1920s.<br>
<br>Expanding educational opportunities was always more important than politics to Goldstone, and this became even more obvious after his election defeat in 1918. As a union official he was noted for solid organizational work, attention to detail, orderly exposition of the facts, and careful negotiation. In campaigns against educational cuts and in support of NUT policies, he deferred neither to government officials nor to fellow Labour politicians, but was always respectful to both. A traditionalist in some respects, he still wanted to raise the school-leaving age and extend opportunities. So far as Labour politics were concerned, he remained overshadowed by R. H. Tawney, MacDonald, and others in debates over educational policy. Although technically chair of Labour's education advisory committee, he was conspicuously absent from its deliberations (as he had been from the speaker's conference).<br>
<br>Goldstone was always somewhat distant from Labour colleagues; and his name seldom appears in the diaries, correspondence, and memoirs of Labour, Fabian, and socialist contemporaries. He was closer to NUT colleagues, but they too painted a picture of a neatly dressed, sincere, but rather formal bureaucrat (despite his liking for football and cricket).<br>
<br>Goldstone retired as general secretary of the NUT in 1931, when he also received a knighthood. He acted as principal of a tutorial college for three years, but played little further part in political affairs. His wife died at Ipswich in 1942. Goldstone was not distinguished as a propagandist for the Independent Labour Party, a great pamphleteer, or a prominent municipal politician. However, his form of political activism, enthusiasm for education, and attention to the details of union activity were important ingredients in the early Labour Party. He died at 12 Temple Road, Ipswich, on 25 December 1955.<br>
