<span class="headword">Gearing,  Harold William George</span>  (1912&#150;2005), <span class="occ">statistician and computer manager</span>, was born on 6 February 1912 at 3 Felix Road, Ealing, London, the fourth child of Charles William Edward Gearing, watchmaker, and his wife, Florence Eleanor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Foster. He won a scholarship to Ealing grammar school, but left at the age of sixteen to start work as an audit clerk in an accountancy firm. He continued his studies in evening classes at Regent Street Polytechnic, and completed his chartered secretary examinations in 1931. He won an evening student exhibition to the London School of Economics in 1931 and graduated BSc (Econ) in 1935, having won the Farr prize for statistics. After graduation he continued his part-time studies at the London School of Economics towards a master's degree, which was awarded in 1939. His first employment after graduation was as a statistician with the Co-operative Building Society, but in 1939 he joined the Metal Box Company in Acton, London, as a financial and cost accountant. He remained with Metal Box all his working life.<br>
<br>The manufacture of tin cans, one of Metal Box's primary products, was a protected industry during the Second World War, so Gearing was not called up, but instead joined the ARP as a night watchman. In 1941 he moved to Metal Box's Perry Wood offices in Worcester to manage their machine-accounting division, which was using automated accounting systems, in particular punched-card systems from Powers-Samas. During a short period at the Metal Box factory in Aintree, Liverpool, he met his future wife, Florence Grace (1908&#150;1990), daughter of Herbert John Parsons, branch manager. They married in Ealing on 17 January 1942, and had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>After the war Gearing moved back to London as Metal Box's head of budgets and financial accounts. His academic interests remained, and in 1951 he was a founder member of the Institute of Statistics. In July 1954 he attended a course at Northampton Polytechnic, in Northampton Square, London, on &#145;Computers with cost accounting and management control&#146;. These courses, which were organized by a group of individuals who would shortly go on to found the London Computer Group, were the first to look at commercial applications for the new electronic computers that would replace the electro-mechanical systems already in use. In 1956 he was asked to head a new division at Metal Box to investigate applications of the new technology and the potential benefits to the company. After much research, including the preparation of test programs on Northampton Polytechnic's Pegasus computer and a visit to IBM in the USA in 1956, an intention to order a Pegasus II was placed with Ferranti in 1961. In fact Metal Box subsequently took delivery in 1964 of a Ferranti Orion computer, which was installed in the Worcester office. This was one of the first computers to be used by a commercial company in the UK. Although Gearing used the new Ferranti language, NEBULA, provided by the manufacturer, he went on to extend the system using his own machine-code programmes. He reported on this increasingly sophisticated system at a conference organized by the International Federation for Information Processing in 1968, and presented a flexible report generator that provided Metal Box's management with accurate and timely financial reports, and which had the ability to respond quickly to changes in their requirements.<br>
<br>Gearing was a founder member of the British Computer Society (BCS). On 20 May 1957 representatives of the London Computer Group (in which he was now active) and the National Research and Development Corporation met at Metal Box's London offices and agreed to form the BCS. The BCS was incorporated in October 1957 and granted charitable status in 1966. Throughout the early years Gearing served on the BCS council and was joint founder editor with Eric Mutch of the <span class="italic">Computer Journal</span> and the <span class="italic">Computer Bulletin</span>. He was made an honorary fellow of the society in 1969. By the time of his death the society had more than 60,000 members.<br>
<br>Gearing retired from Metal Box in 1973, but continued to provide advice and expertise to a number of small companies, including one run by his son. He remained an active member of the BCS, and in 1991 became the first archivist of the Computer Conservation Society (&#145;a specialist group&#146; within the BCS) and put in much dedicated work collecting important documentation and artefacts from early British computing that were at risk of being lost. He remained a member of the committee of the Computer Conservation Society until his death.<br>
<br>Gearing was highly regarded by those who worked with him, and he provided support and encouragement both to new statisticians in the form of a series of lectures at Wolsey Hall starting in 1951, and also to the programmers and technicians who supported the systems at Metal Box. During one period he made the machine over to the manufacturer each night to test new programmes and was particularly concerned to see the programmers were properly looked after and well fed. In his spare time his interests included photography and music. Having lived latterly at 14 Croft Way, Steeple Morden, near Royston, Hertfordshire, he died on 4 September 2005 at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, from pneumonia and bowel cancer. A service of remembrance was held at St Peter and St Paul's Church, Steeple Morden, on 16 September 2005. He was survived by his son and daughter, his wife, Florence, having predeceased him.<br>
