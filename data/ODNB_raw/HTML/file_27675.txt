</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Treby, Sir  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1644, <em>d.</em> 1700), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was baptized at Plympton St Mary, Devon, on 1 January 1644, the eldest son of Peter Treby (<i>d</i>. in or after 1663), an attorney of common pleas, and his wife, Joan, daughter of John Snelling of Chaddlewood. Treby studied at Plympton School before entering Exeter College, Oxford, in June 1660. He left Oxford without a degree, and on 24 October 1663 he was admitted to the Middle Temple, where he was called to the bar on 2 June 1671. He became a bencher of his inn on 28 January 1681 and a reader in 1686, and was treasurer in 1689&#150;90. During the 1670s much of Treby's legal work came from his native county. On 15 November 1675 he married Anna Blount, a London widow; she was the daughter of Colonel Edward Grosvenor, with whom Treby remained on close terms after Anna's death, at some time before September 1677.<h2>
<a name="Entryintopolitics"></a>Entry into politics</h2>In March 1677 Treby was elected member of parliament for Plympton. His rival Richard Strode petitioned against the result, claiming that Treby had resorted to &#145;foul means&#146;  (Crossette and Henning). None the less, Treby kept his seat. There are signs in this period of Treby's support of nonconformists and their sympathizers in Plympton and elsewhere. He provided legal counsel to John Starkey, a bookseller whose publications were seized from Treby's Middle Temple chambers in late 1677; Starkey's shop would later become a gathering place for the whiggish <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92786', "Green Ribbon Club")</script>, with which Treby was associated. Despite Treby's apparent anti-court leanings, Plympton's corporation underscored their support of him when they named him their recorder and when they re-elected him to both parliaments of 1679.<br>
<br>In parliament Treby took the lead in matters concerned with the wool trade and other issues of importance in Devon. He sought wider responsibilities, but failed to win the chair of the committee of elections and privileges early in 1679. However, in November 1678 Titus Oates had revealed details of the Popish Plot, and the house named Treby to lead the committee of secrecy charged with its investigation. In May he reported the committee's evidence concerning James, duke of York, which gave courage to those, like Treby, who supported York's exclusion from the succession to the crown. Talk arose in June 1679 that Treby might be named the new speaker of the Commons. Nothing came of this, &#145;because being so short sighted, he cannot see to distinguish members in the house&#146;  (<span class="italic">Seventh Report</span>, HMC, 473).<br>
<br>When Charles II convened parliament in October 1680, Treby was named to the committee investigating those who had promoted the &#145;abhorrences&#146; of petitions to the king for summoning parliament. He also gained the chair of the elections committee, which he used to benefit those who shared his view of &#145;popery&#146; and the duke of York, and he continued to lead the committee investigating the Popish Plot. Treby again reported their findings to the Commons and then moved for the preparation of the second <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span>. He opposed any expedients by which York might be allowed to sit on the throne: &#145;not to make an utter exclusion of a popish successor is in plain English to have our throats cut&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 72, fol. 466).<br>
<br>In early December 1680 Treby was among the eminent lawyers prosecuting William Howard, Viscount Stafford, the first of the so-called &#145;popish lords&#146; tried in the House of Lords. At the same time he was appointed recorder of London after Sir George Jeffreys resigned. He was knighted on 20 January 1681; the next month the king commissioned him a justice of the peace for London and for his native Devon.<br>
<br>Plympton returned Treby to the third Exclusion Parliament in April 1681, where he helped to bring in the third <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span>. More sensationally, he reported to the Commons the information he had received from Edward Fitzharris about the plot. Treby and others hoped that by impeaching Fitzharris they might gain further testimony demonstrating the involvement of Thomas Osborne, earl of Danby, and the duke of York. Once the third Exclusion parliament had been dissolved, and thus any impeachment proceeding that might embarrass the king and his allies had been halted, Fitzharris was charged with treason. Treby joined Sir Francis Winnington and Henry Pollexfen to protect their most important witness from destruction. Treby tried to convince king's bench that it could not hear the case since Fitzharris still had an impeachment pending against him in parliament: for king's bench to take the case would be to remove the matter from a higher court into a lower one. These arguments failed to persuade the justices, who ruled that since parliament had been dissolved, the impeachment proceedings had ended. Fitzharris was tried, convicted, and executed in short order. Not long thereafter Francis Hawkins, chaplain of the Tower of London, published Fitzharris's purported confession, in which he alleged that Treby and others had tried to pressure him into giving false testimony. Treby is assumed to be the author of <span class="italic">Truth Vindicated</span>, in which he vigorously defended himself and others from &#145;so vain, so unlikely, and so foolish a slander&#146;  (Treby, <span class="italic">Truth Vindicated</span>, 23).<h2>
<a name="Opponentofthecourt"></a>Opponent of the court</h2>On 12 April 1681, within days of his return from the failed parliament at Oxford, Treby had made his second marriage, to Rachel (<i>d</i>. before December 1684), daughter of James Standish of Hatton Garden. Throughout this period he was active with the Green Ribbon Club, where he allegedly promoted a &#145;free state&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1680&#150;81</i>, 232) and suggested that James Scott, duke of Monmouth, the eldest illegitimate son of Charles II, should be king. In May 1681 Treby presented to the king an address from London requesting another parliament. The king bridled at this advice, remarking that the City meddled in business that did not belong to it.<br>
<br>In part owing to the City's pressure to summon parliament, Charles's legal advisers decided to attack London's charter by <i>quo warranto</i>. Treby, perhaps hoping to earn the king's favour for the City, made a most loyal speech when he presented London's new sheriffs at court in September 1682. But the <i>quo warranto</i> went on, and in February 1683 Treby &#145;argued very learnedly&#146;  (Luttrell, 1.249) in king's bench on the City's behalf. The heart of his case was that if a wrong had been done, it could only have been done by individuals, not by the corporation itself; such individuals, not the City, should be sued and punished. More creatively, Treby noted that the <i>quo warranto</i> was brought against the corporation by name yet charged that the corporation had been destroyed by the illegal acts it had done. He pointed to the logical contradiction of bringing a suit against a body which the same suit said did not exist. The judges brushed this complaint aside, observing that the corporation would only die when judgment was entered against it.<br>
<br>Judgment was indeed given against the City, though the court delayed entering it on record in hopes that London might be convinced to surrender its charter to the king. Some lawyers advised surrender, but Treby counselled the City to fight on, telling City leaders that surrender would violate their oaths to uphold the City's rights and that it would lead to worse legal trouble than enrolment of the judgment. Treby also believed that, given the City's good behaviour, the king would not press for surrender, but judgment against the charter was entered in October 1683 and the City's corporation ceased to exist. Treby thereby lost his recordership and was soon removed as well from the various county benches on which he served. In 1684, faced with <i>quo warranto</i> proceedings and seeing London's example, Plympton surrendered its charter and received a new one that left Treby out of the recordership there as well.<br>
<br>In 1683 Treby had worked unsuccessfully with Pollexfen and William Williams to defend the former London lord mayor Sir Patience Ward on charges that he perjured himself when he gave evidence supporting Sir Thomas Pilkington from the <i>scandalum magnatum</i> brought against him by the duke of York. In 1685 Treby joined another group of whiggish lawyers arguing on behalf of Thomas Sandys, sued by the East India Company for a breach of their trade monopoly. He argued, &#145;The prerogative is great; but it has this general and just limitation, that nothing is to be done thereby that is mischievous or injurious to the subject&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 10.386). Treby reasoned that though the king could create a trading company, he could not grant it exclusive commercial powers. Once again Treby's arguments limiting the king's authority over corporations failed to convince king's bench. These cases aside, Treby did not appear in as many of the politically sensitive trials of the early 1680s as other great lawyer&#150;MPs such as Williams, Pollexfen, and Winnington.<br>
<br>The one bright spot in this period was Treby's third marriage, on 14 December 1684, to Dorothy, daughter of Ralph Grainge of the Inner Temple. Together they had two children, a son, George, and a daughter, Maria, who died in infancy. Dorothy, however, died within a few years of their marriage. On 6 January 1693 Treby married Mary Brinley (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1663), who reportedly brought a &pound;10,000 portion. A second surviving son, Brinley, was born in 1698.<br>
<br>In elections to parliament in 1685 Treby again stood at Plympton against Strode, though this time Strode prevailed, in part because Plympton's 1684 charter had remodelled the corporation and thus destroyed Treby's political base. By then Titus Oates had been charged with perjury for the testimony he had given in the Popish Plot trials. Treby was initially assigned as Oates's counsel, and though Oates wrote pitiful letters pleading for his advice, he finally decided not to help the darling of the whig cause. He also refused, in 1686, to appear in the great test case of the king's claimed power to dispense with the penal laws, <i>Godden v. Hale</i>. But in 1688 he agreed to join many of England's most prominent lawyers to defend the seven bishops who had opposed James II's policy of religious toleration. Later that year, as the toleration effort unravelled, James sought to reconstitute London's corporation in its pre-surrender form in hopes of winning back lost political support. Twice James offered Treby his old recorder's office, and twice he refused.<h2>
<a name="InofficeunderWilliamIII"></a>In office under William III</h2>The arrival of William of Orange changed Treby's stance, and on 10 December he resumed his place as the City's recorder. The next day he was among those consulted by the provisional government about what should be done in the wake of James II's departure. At a meeting of London's aldermen on 16 December he was chiefly responsible for the defeat of a motion congratulating James II on his return to London, saying it would be inconsistent with the welcome extended to William. Four days later he led a City delegation to the prince of Orange and gave an obsequious oration to the man who, &#145;led by the hand of heaven, and called by the voice of the people, has preserved our dearest interests&#146;&#151;chiefly law and the protestant religion&#151;&#145;which is primitive Christianity restored&#146;  (<span class="italic">Speech to the Prince of Orange</span>).<br>
<br>Plympton, its old corporation revived, returned Treby to the Convention Parliament in January 1689. In the debate on the state of the crown he lashed out at James for his promotion of Catholics and his destruction of the corporations, adding that James had renounced the kingdom and could not be trusted. Only William, &#145;who under God, is our only remedy&#146;, could now take the throne  (Jones, 244). William named Treby solicitor-general in early March, and on 6 May 1689 he promoted him to attorney-general. In the Commons, Treby reported the new form of the oaths of supremacy and allegiance, helped to prepare the <span class="roman">Bill of Rights</span>, and was among those appointed to bring in a bill for reversing the judgment in the London <i>quo warranto</i>. More controversially, he joined the whigs who favoured the clause in the abortive <span class="roman">Corporations Restoration Bill</span> that would have barred most urban tories from local office. In March 1690 it first appeared that he had been defeated at Plympton's parliamentary election by his old foe Strode, but the Commons voided that return; he won the second vote two weeks later.<br>
<br>On 30 April 1692 Treby was installed as chief justice of common pleas and thereupon resigned the recordership and his seat in the Commons. In 1693 he presided in the trial of William Anderton for seditious libel, and in 1695 and 1696 he was among the justices who tried the association plotters. Treby gave his most important judicial opinion, in the widely watched bankers' case, in June 1695, in which he recommended reversing the exchequer decree for the bankers. He suggested that the court of exchequer had no power to compensate the bankers by ordering payments out of the Treasury. He was joined in this view by Lord Keeper Somers, who reversed the exchequer judgment. But in January 1700 the House of Lords took up the matter. When they consulted the judges, Treby again gave his opinion against the initial decree, but he and Somers were overruled as the Lords restored the original judgment. Throughout these years Treby often presided in the Lords as speaker when the lord keeper was absent or ill. In May 1700 he was among those briefly commissioned to hold the great seal itself after Lord Somers's removal.<br>
<br>In early December 1700 Treby, feeling ill, moved to Kensington for better air. He died there on 13 December, survived by his fourth wife and two sons. He was quietly buried in the Temple Church in an evening ceremony three days later. Sir John Holt, chief justice of king's bench, along with some of the other justices, served as his executor and as trustee for his sons. Treby left his wife and children with extensive properties in Devon, Cornwall, and Lincolnshire, large amounts of cash out on loan, and a house at Hatton Garden. The aldermen of Plympton, the town that gave him his start in law and politics, received rings from their late recorder.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Treby did not prevail in the major cases he argued during the 1680s, but this did not lead contemporaries to doubt his powers as a lawyer. Nahum Tate waxed lyrical on his abilities:<blockquote>
<div>For law, that does a boundless ocean seem,<br>
</div>
<div>Is coasted all, and fathomed all by him &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>His judgments he from Truth's clear fountain draws,<br>
</div>
<div>Respecting not the party, but the cause &hellip;<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Evelyn too called him &#145;a learned man&#146;  (Evelyn, 5.438), with good cause. Treby's arguments in the London <i>quo warranto</i> and the East India Company cases were notable for their creativity and precision, even if they did not succeed in law. His erudition was equally apparent in his annotations of Dyer's <span class="italic">Reports</span> and in his words from the bench, which showed his attention to procedural propriety and to logical rigour. His widow erected a monument to his finer qualities in the Temple Church. Unsurprisingly, the tory biographer Roger North did not care much for Treby, who he said &#145;was no fanatic; but, of the fanatic party, true as steel. His genius lay to free-thinking, and, conformably to his fellows at that time, made the scriptures and Christianity, or rather all religion, a jest &hellip;&#146;  (North, 2.9). Treby's support of foreign protestants as well as English ones suggests that North was probably right about his sympathy for nonconformists. He showed a consistent commitment to whig political goals in the 1680s. His anti-Catholic bigotry made him more credulous in accepting the evidence of a &#145;popish&#146; plot than his otherwise careful mind might have allowed; his abandonment of Oates in his hour of need points to his sense of political expediency if not to his personal loyalty to one whose wild allegations had fuelled Treby's rise to prominence.<br>
