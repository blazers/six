<span class="headword">Bevan <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Vaughan]</span>,  Bridget</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Madam Bevan]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1698, <em>d.</em> 1779), <span class="occ">educational benefactor</span>, baptized on 30 October 1698 at Merthyr church in Llannewydd, Carmarthenshire, was the youngest daughter of John Vaughan (1663&#150;1722) and his wife, Elizabeth Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1721), of Derllys, Carmarthenshire. She married Arthur Bevan (1689&#150;1743), of Laugharne, on 30 December 1721 at Merthyr church. Her husband served as recorder of the Carmarthen Boroughs (1722&#150;41), and as member of parliament for Carmarthen Boroughs (1727&#150;41), and was appointed judge of equity in north and south Wales in 1735. He died on 6 March 1743, and was buried at Laugharne church.<br>
<br>John Vaughan was a great patron of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK) and was responsible for the organization of the society's schools in Carmarthenshire between 1700 and 1722. His daughter inherited his interest in education and philanthropy and displayed this chiefly through her patronage of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15006/', "Griffith Jones")</script> and his system of circulating schools. Jones, rector of Llanddowror, was already renowned for his powerful preaching, and had served as schoolteacher for the SPCK school at Laugharne under John Vaughan's supervision. Building on this experience, and with the welfare of his parishioners foremost in his mind, he established his first school at Llanddowror in 1731; the schools multiplied greatly from then on and many thousands had received instruction by the time of Jones's death, in 1761. Madam Bevan provided him with financial support and acted as adviser and confidante. An attractive woman, she and her husband moved in fashionable circles in London and Bath, and were friends of Lord Chesterfield. These connections were to prove useful in enlisting support towards the upkeep of the schools.<br>
<br>Following the death of his wife in 1755, Griffith Jones moved to Madam Bevan's house at Laugharne, where his cantankerous nature led the servants to dub him &#145;Old Peevish&#146;. He remained there until his death, in 1761, after which Madam Bevan took sole responsibility for the management and upkeep of the circulating schools for the following eighteen years. During that time she displayed considerable business acumen and organizational skills. Although this period in the history of the circulating schools is usually afforded scant attention by historians, the number of schools increased under her direction, particularly in the more Anglicized areas of the country. By 1764 news of the success of this educational initiative had reached the ears of Catherine the Great of Russia, who ordered her ministers to make enquiries about the scheme.<br>
<br>This chapter in Welsh educational history effectively came to a close with the death of Bridget Bevan, at Laugharne, on 10 December 1779; she was buried at Llanddowror church on 17 December 1779. Her will, dated 27 October 1779, left the funds entrusted to her by Griffith Jones, along with her own personal estate, to ensure the continuance of the circulating schools. However, two of the trustees, her niece Lady Elizabeth Stepney, and nephew Rear-Admiral William Lloyd, disputed the will and took possession of the money. The remaining two trustees, George Bowen, of Llwyn-gwair, and Zachary Bevan, of Laugharne, took the case to chancery in an attempt to recover the funds for the benefit of the schools. The legal dispute lasted until 1804, when it was finally judged that Madam Bevan's will should stand, but by this time the circulating schools had already perished for lack of funds. The work undertaken by Griffith Jones and Bridget Bevan was, in a sense, continued by the new Sunday schools, established from the late eighteenth century onwards in Wales.<br>
