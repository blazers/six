<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stubbs,  Philip</span>  (1665&#150;1738), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and educationist</span>, was born on 2 October 1665 in the parish of St Andrew Undershaft, London, the son of Philip Stubbs, vintner, and his wife, Elizabeth Hillier. Having been a pupil at Merchant Taylors' School, London, from 1678 to 1682, he matriculated at Oxford as a commoner of Wadham College on 13 March 1683. He was made a scholar of the college on 26 September 1684, and graduated BA on 20 October 1686, proceeding MA on 15 June 1689 and BD on 3 July 1722. He was elected a fellow on 1 July 1691, moderator <i>novae classis</i> in 1688, and subdean in 1691. He was repetitioner of the Easter sermons in 1691. After ordination in 1688 he became a curate in the united parishes of St Benet Gracechurch and St Leonard, Shoreditch. From 1691 he was successively chaplain to Robert Grove, bishop of Chichester, and George, earl of Huntington.<br>
<br>In 1694 he became rector of Woolwich; at that time developments associated with the royal dockyard were changing the area from a fishing village to a town. There he married in 1696 Mary (1664&#150;1759), daughter of John Willis, rector of West Horndon, Essex. They had two surviving sons and one daughter. The concern he showed for the sailors probably led to his becoming the first chaplain of Greenwich Hospital for disabled seamen, and he simultaneously held other clerical posts. On leaving Woolwich in 1699 he became rector of St Alphage, London Wall, and in 1705 also of St James Garlickhythe in London. He relinquished these parishes in 1715 when he became archdeacon of St Albans; later he became rector of Launton, Oxfordshire (1719 until his death). He was elected FRS on 30 November 1703 and took an active interest in literature and archaeology. His responsibilities at Greenwich Hospital and the annual visit to his archdeaconry meant that he was absent from Launton for half the year and he employed a curate at the full rate of &pound;40 a year.<br>
<br>Richard Steele recalled the care he devoted to public worship:<blockquote>While being at St James's Garlick-Hill church I heard the service read so distinctly, so emphatically and so fervently that it was next to an impossibility not to be attentive. &hellip; The rector of this parish at that time was Mr Philip Stubbs, afterwards archdeacon of St Albans, whose excellent manner of performing the service was long remembered by the parishioners. (<span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, no. 147, 18 Aug 1711)</blockquote>Stubbs was also renowned as a preacher. He published many individual sermons and addresses, and in 1704 a collected volume. In one published sermon on <span class="roman">Revelation</span> 20: 13, the <span class="italic">Sea-Assize</span>, which had been preached at Greenwich and Woolwich on Advent Sunday, 28 November 1708, in memory of Prince George of Denmark, Stubbs was designated &#145;Chaplain of HM Navy in Ordinary and of her Royal Hospital for Seamen at Greenwich&#146;; another sermon, <span class="italic">God's Dominion over the Seas and the Seaman's Duty</span> (1701), preached at Longreach, Essex, on the <i>Royal Sovereign</i>, went to three editions and was translated into French for French seamen who were prisoners of war. He was an early supporter of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG), and compiled its first report in 1703. The society gave him a special vote of thanks and chose him to preach the sermon in St Paul's Cathedral on Trinity Sunday, 1711, the day the queen had appointed for SPG collections to be taken in the city churches. This sermon was afterwards published under the title <span class="italic">The Divine Mission of Gospel Ministers</span> (1711).<br>
<br>As an incumbent Stubbs cared for poor children. He was an early member of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, supporting its encouragement of charity schools. He established such schools in his London parishes, at St Alphage, London Wall, and St James Garlickhythe, and in Bicester, near his Launton parish, and he also paid &pound;2 a year to Bicester grammar school to support two boys from Launton.<br>
<br>Archdeacon Stubbs died at Greenwich Hospital on 13 September 1738 and was buried in the hospital's old cemetery. His tombstone survives there in the mausoleum.<br>
