<span class="headword">White,  Lydia Rogers</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1760, <em>d.</em> 1827), <span class="occ">literary hostess</span>, was baptized at St Augustine-the-Less Church, Bristol, on 28 January 1760, the youngest daughter of Stephen White (<i>d</i>. 1797), a Bristol merchant, and his wife, Cecil, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Basset, who inherited substantial property from her brother William Basset of Miskin, Glamorgan. Her surviving siblings were Ann (<i>bap</i>. 1756, <i>d</i>. 1845), who married Francis Saunderson MP (1754&#150;1827), of Castle Saunderson, co. Cavan, and Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1757, <i>d</i>. 1848), who married John Bennet Popkin (1756&#150;1804) of Kittle Hill, Glamorgan. Lydia White's father was sheriff of Glamorgan in 1785 and she and her sisters had connections with landed families both in Wales and Ireland.<br>
<br>She is first heard of in Bath where she was caring for her elderly father. In June 1780 Fanny Burney recorded at length an unsettling interview with a Miss White of Bath&#151;&#145;young &amp; pleasing in her appearance, not pretty, but agreeable her Face, &amp; soft, gentle &amp; well bred in her manners&#146;  (Rizzo, 4.144)&#151;who confessed to the author of <span class="italic">Evelina</span> that despairing of companionship she had been reading the infidels Hume and Bolingbroke and contemplating suicide. In June 1786, also in Bath, Betsy Sheridan (daughter of the elocutionist, sister of the dramatist) expressed distaste for the affectations of &#145;Miss White who seems determin'd to Rival Miss [Charlotte] Brooke with my father and to supply her place in my good graces&#146;  (Lefanu, 85).<br>
<br>Stephen White died in Queen's Parade, Bath, in January 1797, leaving the Welsh property to his daughters and so providing Lydia with a competency for life. In November 1798 Samuel Rogers (said to have proposed marriage to Miss White at some later date) wrote to his sister of &#145;a most charming and elegant woman about thirty-five, who, after having long excited the admiration of the Pump Room by her wit and her talents, shut herself up in her father's sick-room for two long years&#146;  (Clayden, 348). She was then living at Wick House, Richmond, on an income of &pound;1200. She is next heard of in Ireland, visiting the poet Mary Tighe at Dominick Street in Dublin and beginning lifelong friendships with Maria Edgeworth, Lady Morgan, and Thomas Moore.<br>
<br>Moore recalled a performance of <span class="italic">Comus</span> of about 1805 in which Lydia White took the part of the Lady and lords George and William Lamb the parts of the two brothers&#151;Lady Caroline Lamb became a particular friend and was probably the means by which Lydia White made Byron's acquaintance in 1813. She had already made a friend of Walter Scott during a long visit made in 1808; Scott described his guest to Lady Louisa Stuart as &#145;what Oxonians call a lioness of the first order, with stockings nineteen times nine dyed blue, very lively, very good-humoured, and extremely absurd&#146;  (Lockhart, 2.137). Seeing her off to the highlands, Scott professed himself impressed with her energy and physical hardihood.<br>
<br>By 1815 Lydia White was established in London as a society hostess at 113 Park Street, Grosvenor Square, where, as Scott recalled, she &#145;contrived to have every evening a very good literary melie and little dinners which were every entertaining&#146;  (Scott, 352). She entertained Scott, the Byrons, and Thomas Moore, who on a visit to Samuel Rogers annoyed his host by turning to Richard Brinsley Sheridan and exclaiming, &#145;Isn't it time to go to Lydia White's?&#146;  (Maltby, 70). In contrast to those of rival hostesses&#151;Lady Holland, Lady Cork, Lady Davy&#151;the lions of Miss White's &#145;menagerie&#146; seem to have been strictly literary. While always described as a bluestocking, she did not translate Greek or cultivate the sciences; her intellectual claims were based on reading and travel.<br>
<br>White was among the many flocking to Paris in 1815; in 1816 she was observed in Florence, in 1818 in Naples, and in 1819 in Venice. The writer Harriet Pigott travelled with her in Switzerland in 1818, finding in her companion &#145;a fund of amusement&#146; and commenting on her &#145;terrible bluism&#146; and &#145;red and white cheeks, a perfect mask, so thickly was the colouring laid on her delicate skin&#146;  (Pigott, 148). Pigott recorded that having failed with the archaeologist Sir William Gell, Miss White set her cap at the historian L&eacute;onard Sismondi&#151;who instead wed an Englishwoman (Jessica Allen) guiltless of &#145;employing a single artifice or manoeuvre&#146;. Miss Pigott observed in Miss White &#145;some information, much tact, and lady-like feelings&#146;  (ibid., 150, 149).<br>
<br>The good humour noticed by Scott also appears in the compliment paid by Bulwer Lytton in <span class="italic">Pelham</span> (1828):<blockquote>&#145;Miss White&#146;, said Lady Roseville, &#145;has not only the best command of language herself, but she gives language to other people. Dinner parties, usually so stupid, are, at her house, quite delightful. I have actually seen English people look happy, and one or two even almost natural&#146;.</blockquote>It is also implied in the well-known anecdote related by William Harness:<blockquote>On another occasion, at one of her small and most agreeable dinners in Park Street, the company (most of them, except the hostess, being Whigs) were discussing, in rather a querulous strain, the desperate prospects of their party. &#145;Yes,&#146; said Sydney Smith, &#145;we are in a deplorable condition; we must do something to help ourselves; I think we had better sacrifice a Tory Virgin.&#146; This was partially addressed to Lydia White, who at once catching and applying the allusion to Iphigenia, answered, &#145;Well, I believe there is nothing the Whigs would not do <i>to raise the wind!</i>&#146; (L'Estrange, 161)</blockquote>Lydia White's travelling was terminated by swelling in her legs. But the Park Street entertainments continued as described by Lady Charlotte Bury (in a passage that Anthony Trollope must have remembered when creating his Countess Neroni):<blockquote>Immovable from dropsy, with a swollen person and an emaciated face, she is placed on an inclined plane raised high upon a sofa, which put me in mind of the corpse of the late Queen of Spain at Rome, in the church of the Santa Maria Novella. (Bury, 2.200)</blockquote>She continued thus for several years: &#145;They may say what they will,&#146; said Samuel Rogers, &#145;but Miss White and Missolonghi are the most remarkable things going&#146;  (Dowden, 3.927). Little notice was taken when she finally died in late January 1827. &#145;Poor Lydia had asked a party to dine with her on Friday,&#146; wrote Lady Morgan, &#145;on Wednesday she was dead!&#146;  (Dixon, 2.235). When the Friday came, her guests arrived as usual. She was buried in St George's, Hanover Square, on 5 February 1827. No obituary has been located, and none of her contemporaries left a memoir of her. Instead, her memory survived in anecdotes which were collected by William Prideaux Courtney in the first and only memoir of Lydia White to appear, belatedly published in 1910.<br>
