<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Osler, Sir  William</span>, baronet  (1849&#150;1919), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 12 July 1849 at Bond Head, Tecumseh, Ontario, Canada, the sixth son and eighth child of the Revd Featherstone Lake Osler (1805&#150;1895) and Ellen Free Pickton (1806&#150;1906), daughter of a London merchant; both families were of Cornish origin. Featherstone Osler had spent several years in the Royal Navy before deciding to become an Anglican minister; he matriculated in 1833 at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, and following his graduation in 1836 he was ordained a deacon &#145;for the cure of souls in His Majesty's foreign possessions&#146; and sent with his new bride as a missionary to Upper Canada. Although his initial appointment was for five years, the family stayed and thrived. Featherstone Osler was disappointed that none of his sons followed him into the ministry. However, they included a successful businessman, a lawyer, and a high-court judge.<h2>
<a name="Canadianchildhood"></a>Canadian childhood</h2>William Osler, known as Willie, was originally destined for a career in the church. He was educated at the grammar school in Dundas, Ontario, whence the family had moved in 1857; at nearby Barrie grammar school; and, from January 1866, at Trinity College School, Weston. Although he was always a good student and became a prefect at Trinity, the most distinguishing trait to emerge from his schooldays was a strong proclivity for jokes and pranks which frequently got him into trouble and even led to his expulsion from school in Dundas. The sense of fun and mischief never left him.<br>
<br>In 1867 Osler entered Trinity College, Toronto, where he came under the influence of two men who awakened his passion for natural history and encouraged his switch from divinity to medicine. The Revd W. A. Johnson (1816&#150;1880), founder and warden of Trinity College, was an ardent field naturalist and microscopist; Dr James Bovell (1817&#150;1880) was a devout medical practitioner and teacher at Trinity College and at the proprietary Toronto school of medicine. Under the guidance of these two local worthies, Osler acquired a taste for science. His early publications were on algae, parasites, and other natural historical topics. He also began acquiring medical skills by assisting Bovell and another local practitioner, and enrolled in the Toronto school of medicine. Bovell gave him free access to his fine personal library and encouraged Osler's fascination with gross and microscopic anatomy.<br>
<br>In 1870 Bovell returned to the West Indies, where he eventually became ordained, and Osler went to the better medical school at McGill University, Montreal. There he became a favourite of his third formative teacher, Palmer Howard (1823&#150;1889), professor of medicine. Howard fostered Osler's interest in pathology and, like Bovell, shared his private library with his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Osler's thesis, now lost, analysed twenty post-mortem examinations, and included specimens and microscopic slides. It won Osler a prize, though his general academic record at McGill was good but not outstanding. He graduated MD CM from McGill in 1872.<br>
<br>Encouraged by Howard and the other McGill medical faculty to aspire to a teaching career in Montreal, Osler left in July 1872 for what was to be a two-year postgraduate stay in Europe, financed by his brother. His initial plan was to study ophthalmology and to return as a specialist. He spent his first year in London, attending clinics at University College Hospital and St Thomas's Hospital, and studying physiology and pathology at University College and the Brown Institute with John Scott Burdon-Sanderson, whom he was eventually to succeed as regius professor of medicine at Oxford. His flirtation with ophthalmology ended on learning from Howard that three practitioners intended to set up in the speciality in Montreal. He declined an offer to return to McGill to teach materia medica. Instead he continued his study of pathology in Berlin and Vienna; back in Canada in 1874, he was offered a lectureship in the Institutes of Medicine at McGill. At the age of twenty-five, he was younger than some of his students.<br>
<br>Osler spent a decade on the faculty of his alma mater. He taught physiology, histology, and pathology at the medical school, and parasitology at a local veterinary college; he attended patients on the smallpox ward at Montreal General Hospital and gradually developed a private practice. He also began to publish widely, mostly case reports, clinical lectures, or pathological observations. He made friends easily, especially with the students, whom he could formally counsel after 1877, when he was made registrar of the medical school. The following year he was elected attending physician at Montreal General; he celebrated his success by spending the summer in London, where he passed his membership of the Royal College of Physicians. He returned to London with Palmer Howard in 1881 for the Seventh International Medical Congress, which attracted most of the medical &eacute;lites of Europe. In 1884 he went back to Germany, where medical thinking had been transformed by the work of Robert Koch and others on bacteriology. Osler was cautiously receptive of the germ theory, but his own approach to disease continued to be clinical and pathological.<h2>
<a name="TeachingmedicineintheUnitedStates"></a>Teaching medicine in the United States</h2>While in Germany, Osler was invited to apply for the chair of clinical medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the USA. He was interviewed by the doyen of Philadelphia physicians, Silas Weir Mitchell, who happened to be in Europe also. Mitchell and Osler immediately recognized each other as kindred spirits, and Mitchell's enthusiastic recommendation smoothed the way for Osler's move to the conservative and inbred medical community in Philadelphia. It offered even more outlets than Montreal for a man of Osler's clubbable instincts, and Osler quickly became part of Philadelphia's medical and cultural life. He took an active interest in the fine historical collections in the library of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, and regularly attended the meetings of several local and national medical societies. He had been elected president of the Canadian Medical Association during his last year in Montreal; his presidential address in 1885, entitled &#145;The growth of a profession&#146;, elaborated themes that were to preoccupy him for the rest of his life. These included the notions that solidarity within the medical profession was an unmitigated good, that patients had nothing to fear from a powerful, well-educated, and self-regulating profession, and that the true future of medicine lay in the wise application of science. Earlier that year Osler delivered the Goulstonian lectures to the Royal College of Physicians in London. He was elected a fellow of the college in 1883, his first eligible year. He chose as his subject malignant endocarditis, a fatal disease that lent itself to close analysis of both its clinical and pathological dimensions. He also worked on diseases of the blood, the nervous system, typhoid fever, and, a recurring topic of interest to him, pneumonia.<br>
<br>During his Philadelphia years, Osler continued to perform frequent autopsies, but his skills as a clinical teacher also flourished. He was an excellent diagnostician with an admirable bedside manner and an ability to put patients at their ease. Although physically slight and possessed of an unimpressive, high-pitched voice, he nevertheless always commanded centre-stage in the ward or clinic. Medical students adored him, and he always had a few special favourites, whom he called his &#145;latchkeyers&#146;, students to whom he gave the key to his house so that they could use his personal library whenever they wanted. He was one of the founding members, in 1885, of the Association of American Physicians, devoted to improving the standards of medical practice and education. His private practice also grew, his consultations sometimes taking him as far afield as Chicago, Montreal, or Maine. Many of those he treated were doctors or medical students, who seemed to gravitate to him, but his patients included an increasing number of the rich and famous, including Walt Whitman, Sir Charles Tupper, and several occupants of the White House.<br>
<br>If Osler hesitated before leaving Montreal for Philadelphia, he had no difficulty accepting the call to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. Johns Hopkins University had been opened in 1876, but the medical school and hospital were delayed as the building plans were complicated and the money from the original bequest of Mr Hopkins began to run short. The medical facilities were eagerly anticipated, expected as they were to incorporate the latest scientific advances in both patient care and student education. Osler agreed in 1888 to let his name be put forward as physician-in-chief at the hospital and professor of medicine at the medical school. The formal offer was made in September 1888, which allowed Osler to wind down his Philadelphia commitments and move to Baltimore in May 1889, in time for the official opening of the hospital. The medical school still required further endowment; this was eventually secured, somewhat controversially, from four wealthy women who attached the condition that the medical school admit women medical students. Osler himself believed that nursing was a more suitable occupation for women, but he was prepared to accept them into the medical profession. One of the benefactors, Mary Garrett, further stipulated the even more daring requirement that the medical school admit no one without an undergraduate degree. Despite fears that few students, male or female, would turn up, the faculty agreed to the conditions, and the school was finally opened in 1893.<br>
<br>During his first four years in Baltimore, Osler had relatively few duties. The routine work in the hospital being performed by his residents, he was free to devote more time to writing. The principal result was his <span class="italic">Principles and Practice of Medicine</span>, published to great acclaim in 1892. Dedicated to his early teachers, Johnson, Bovell, and Howard, it was one of the last single-authored textbooks to cover the whole of medicine. Although Osler later complained that effecting the revisions for subsequent editions was a millstone around his neck, it turned a national physician into an international figure. It was eventually translated into French, German, Spanish, and Chinese and went through eight editions during Osler's lifetime, the eighth (1912) with the help of Thomas McCrae, who continued to edit subsequent editions after Osler's death.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Principles</span> finished, Osler promptly proposed marriage to Grace Linzee Revere Gross (1854&#150;1928), the wealthy widow of a prominent Philadelphia surgeon whom Osler had cared for during his final illness. Their first child, born almost exactly nine months after their marriage on 7 May 1892, died shortly after birth. They doted on their only other child, Edward Revere (1895&#150;1917), and never really recovered from his death in the First World War. Osler himself loved children and always had many young friends, who brought out his natural sense of fun and mischief. Although Revere was never a particularly studious boy, he and his father had a close relationship, cemented by frequent fishing trips together after Revere (dubbed Isaak Walton junior by Osler) developed a passion for angling.<br>
<br>Osler's years at Johns Hopkins were the busiest of his life. Under his guidance there emerged the first organized clinical unit in the English-speaking world, containing the best features of English schools and German clinics. Osler was the most visible of the four foundation professors at the medical school who were famously commemorated in John Singer Sargent's painting, and the early success of the school owed much to his energy and clinical teaching. He continued to publish clinical papers at an astonishing rate: in 1897, for instance, he wrote articles <i>inter alia</i> on mitral stenosis, gallstones, typhoid fever, tics, tuberculosis, cretinism, leprosy, pneumonia, and malaria. He was a frequent contributor to <span class="italic">Johns Hopkins Hospital Bulletin</span> and <span class="italic">Johns Hopkins Hospital Reports</span>, periodicals with which he was intimately associated during his Hopkins years. At the same time he relied on his associates to keep things running smoothly during his frequent absences from Baltimore. These were occasioned by his extensive consulting practice, his increasing demand as a speaker, his active participation in national and international medical meetings, and his regular trips to Europe. He was an ardent spokesman on behalf of public health, devoting a good deal of time to efforts designed to control tuberculosis.<br>
<br>As his income from royalties and his practice increased, Osler began to devote more time and money to building his library. He had developed a love for the writings of Sir Thomas Browne as a student, and he always made time each day for non-medical reading. This influenced his own literary style which, especially for his public addresses at commencements, medical gatherings, and the like, was memorably littered with allusions to great authors of the past. His collection of addresses aimed at medical students and young practitioners, <span class="italic">Aequanimitas</span> (1904), achieved instant popularity, was twice reprinted with additional speeches, and long served as a formal presentation gift to graduates of many medical schools. Two such public occasions were especially controversial. Osler's Ingersol lecture at Harvard, delivered in May 1904 and entitled &#145;Science and immortality&#146;, argued for the separate realms of faith and science, before an audience which expected him to reveal the depths of his own Christian faith. Although Osler always quoted liberally from the <span class="roman">Bible</span> when the situation demanded, he became an infrequent churchgoer in his later years, and carefully hid whatever faith he retained from public view.<br>
<br>&#145;The fixed period&#146;, his farewell address at Johns Hopkins in February 1905, inaccurately described Anthony Trollope's short story of the same name, and argued that men's best work is done before they reach forty and that perhaps it would be better for the world were they chloroformed at sixty. Although he later insisted that he was being light-hearted, the newspapers interpreted his speech as advocating forced euthanasia for the elderly. It was a curious way for a man in his sixth decade to end his American career and head for what he and his wife hoped would be a much quieter life at Oxford.<h2>
<a name="RegiuschairatOxford"></a>Regius chair at Oxford</h2>As a Canadian, Osler had always felt at least half-English, and he valued his association with the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal Society, to which he was elected a fellow in 1898. He had already turned down an approach to go to the University of Edinburgh, but the regius chair of medicine vacated by J. S. Burdon-Sanderson's retirement was too tempting to a man visibly tired by the hectic pace of his later American years. The chair carried prestige but little else: a modest salary of &pound;400 per annum and few duties, since Oxford did not possess a clinical school. Osler was especially pleased that the regius chair carried a studentship at Christ Church, college of John Locke and Robert Burton, two of his favourite authors. He was already financially secure, and although he could not avoid seeing some private patients he was more in need of leisure than income.<br>
<br>In fact Osler's English years were busy, though more as a medical statesman and literary figure than an active clinician. He and Grace purchased a big Victorian house at 13 Norham Gardens (which Osler nicknamed the Open Arms, so frequently did they entertain). Books much preoccupied him, not only his own growing library, whose cataloguing he began, but the Bodleian Library of Oxford University, where he became an honorary curator, and the Oxford University Press, which he served as a delegate. He was in constant demand as an eponymous lecturer, delivering the Harveian lecture and Lumleian lectures to the Royal College of Physicians, the Linacre lecture at St John's College, Cambridge, and the Silliman lectures at Yale. The last, entitled <span class="italic">The Growth of Modern Medicine</span>, delivered in 1913 but not published until after his death, were typical in their historical focus and their concern with assessing the problems and prospects of modern medicine.<br>
<br>Although he did much, Osler also learned how to say no. He declined the invitation to stand for parliament, to serve on the royal commission on vivisection, or to become president of several medical organizations. His testimony to the Haldane commission on medical education encouraged the eventual establishment of academic medical, surgical, and obstetric units in some British medical schools, and he was instrumental in founding, in 1906, the Association of Physicians of Great Britain and Ireland, modelled on the American group. At the same time he was suspicious of what was called the &#145;full time&#146; system, whereby academic clinicians would devote themselves entirely to research and teaching. He developed a close relationship with his brother regius at Cambridge, Thomas Clifford Allbutt, and became the figurehead founding editor of the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of Medicine</span>. He edited (also with the help of Thomas McCrae) a massive, seven-volume <span class="italic">System of Medicine</span>, and gently encouraged the development of science and medicine teaching at Oxford. No one was surprised when he was created a baronet in 1911.<br>
<br>The First World War proved cataclysmic to the Oslers. Osler devoted a good deal of time to war work, both as a consultant to military hospitals and as a participant in relief agencies. The influx of friends and old students serving in the Canadian army medical corps kept the Open Arms busy. Osler's former surgical colleague at Johns Hopkins and future biographer, Harvey Cushing, joined an American volunteer medical unit; by coincidence, he was at Revere's bedside when Osler's son died of shrapnel wounds in August 1917. Osler consoled himself increasingly with the planned catalogue of his library, which he bequeathed to McGill. The catalogue was finished long after Osler's own death, by his nephew W. W. Francis, the first Osler librarian.<br>
<br>Osler's seventieth birthday, in July 1919, was celebrated widely, and included the publication of a two-volume Festschrift and a special issue of <span class="italic">Johns Hopkins Hospital Bulletin</span>. &#145;Pity I had not died&#151;fine obituary flavor&#146;, he remarked. His own health had begun to fail during the latter years of the war, as he became subject to frequent pulmonary infections. One of these later in 1919 turned into a pulmonary abscess, from which he died on 29 December at his home in Norham Gardens, Oxford.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>At the time of his death Osler was without doubt the most famous and revered Anglophone doctor in the world. His reputation persists, despite the fact that he made no fundamental discoveries. He was, in his own terms, a transmitter rather than a transformer. The persistence of the Osler myth may be attributed to at least three factors.<br>
<br>First, Osler had a remarkably attractive personality. He had an infectious sense of humour, nowhere better seen than in the series of articles, some scurrilous, some semi-serious, which he published under the pseudonym Egerton Yorrick Davis, MD, Late US Army Surgeon. At the same time he could cope brilliantly with death and the dying, even if sometimes, like Uncle Toby, he whistled that he would not weep. Second, he was an outstanding teacher of clinical medicine who trained many of the academic leaders of the next generation. In an age when science increasingly influenced medical thinking and practice, Osler, with his commitment to the humanities, seemed to combine the science and art of medicine in a perfect mix. Third, he developed a graceful prose style which could make the commonplace sound profound, while espousing a vision of the medical profession which resonated with colleagues. Osler's vision of a literate, autonomous profession placing the needs of patients and of society more generally above those of self-interest seems idealistic and na&iuml;ve in the modern world; it still finds a ready audience.<br>
