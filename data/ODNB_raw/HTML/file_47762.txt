<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Zia ul Haq, Mohammad</span>  (1922&#150;1988), <span class="occ">president of Pakistan</span>, was born on 12 August 1922 in Jullundur in the pre-partition Punjab province of British India. He was born into a lower-middle-class Arain family. This was not the martial caste background from which the Indian army traditionally drew its Punjabi Muslim recruits. Zia was, however, able to take advantage of the widening of the army's base during the Second World War. He completed his studies at the &eacute;lite St Stephen's College in Delhi and, following a short period at the College of Combat, Mhow, joined the British Indian army in 1944. He was commissioned into the 13th lancers and saw service in Burma, Malaya, and Java. After the creation of Pakistan, he was posted to the armoured corps centre at Nowshera in the North-West Frontier Province.<br>
<br>Zia was profoundly influenced by his family's uprooting from their native Jullundur to Peshawar. He was thereafter to share many of the attitudes of the east Punjabi refugee community in Pakistan. These included distrust of India, a fierce national pride, and commitment to the cause of Kashmiri self-determination. Zia's personal piety, arising from his attachment to the puritanical Deobandi sect of Sunni Islam, was also to touch a popular chord.<br>
<br>Shortly after his marriage to his cousin Shafiqa in August 1950, Zia joined the Guides Cavalry. However, his military career really took off only after a highly successful period at the Command and Staff College in Quetta in 1955. He now rose steadily through the ranks; he was promoted brigadier in 1969 and seconded to Jordan, where he helped King Hussein's forces in their operations against the Palestine Liberation Organization. On his return home Zia commanded the 1st armoured division for three years. He was still relatively unknown, however, when in the spring of 1976 he became head of the Pakistan army. The prime minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, had promoted him over the heads of half a dozen more senior generals. Ironically, the very characteristics which had appealed to Bhutto, Zia's piety, patriotism, and professionalism, turned him into a successful coup-maker in the troubled period which followed the prime minister's alleged rigging of the 1977 national elections. Zia shared the important group of corps commanders' belief that the country was slipping into chaos. He also sympathized with the opposition Pakistan National Alliance's portrayal of the Bhutto regime as morally corrupt.<br>
<br>Zia launched the coup against Bhutto&#151;codenamed operation Fairplay&#151;on 5 July 1977. He served first as chief martial law administrator, and from September 1978 as president. Martial law was withdrawn on 30 December 1985, but Zia retained his post as chief of army staff and continued to wield power through the presidency. Unlike his predecessor Ayub Khan, who was hounded from office, Zia remained firmly in control until the end.<br>
<br>Zia's political survival rested on his skill in wrong-footing opponents, and on the favourable external environment following the December 1979 Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. This transformed him overnight from an international pariah to America's front-line ally in the fight against communism. The Reagan administration provided $3.2 billion of military and economic assistance, despite concerns over human rights abuses and Pakistan's clandestine nuclear weapons programme. The Pakistan economy also benefited from the large sums sent home by skilled migrant workers in the countries around the Persian Gulf. These amounted to about 40 per cent of total foreign exchange earnings, and enabled annual rates of economic growth in excess of 6 per cent during the Zia era.<br>
<br>The martial law era was punctuated by unfulfilled promises of national elections and by discussion of the relevance of democracy for an Islamic state. Zia maintained that a Western-style democracy was unsuitable for Pakistan. A 350-member nominated assembly, known as the Majlis-i-Shura, was formed at the end of 1981 to suggest plans of action for the establishment of an Islamic democracy. Zia eventually agreed to hold &#145;party-less&#146; elections in February 1985, following a referendum on his Islamic policies which was linked with his re-election as president. The eleven-party Alliance Movement for the Restoration of Democracy, which had mounted a major campaign in Sind in 1983 against the Zia regime, boycotted both the polls. Sind missed out on the prosperity of the Zia era partly because it did not export labour to the gulf. The sense of alienation felt by its populace was completed by Zia's hanging of Bhutto, Pakistan's first Sindhi prime minister, on 4 April 1979.<br>
<br>The Islamization process became the most identifiable feature of the Zia regime, and increasingly its <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>. It encompassed the areas of personal religious observance and dress codes, judicial reform, education, and the attempt to abolish interest from banking practices. The 1981 Ramadan ordinance made eating, drinking, and smoking in public a crime during the period of fasting. Prayer wardens were introduced some three years later to persuade and inspire persons to perform their daily prayers. Zia introduced special shariat courts, with the power to strike down any law found &#145;repugnant&#146; to Islam. In May 1981, for the first time in Pakistan's history, <i>&#145;ulama&#146;</i> (religious scholars) were appointed as judges. From 1979 theft, murder, adultery, and intoxication were subject to the Islamic penal code and laws of evidence. The enforcement of an Islamic code with respect to sexual crimes was especially controversial because of its discrimination against women. Cases arose in which female rape victims were convicted of adultery and publicly flogged, while their assailants went free. Further Islamization measures included the establishment in 1980 of an Islamic university in Islamabad and the massive expansion of mosque schools. Many of the later Taliban fighters in Afghanistan were to graduate from these schools. Provision of Islamic banking facilities through profit and loss accounts was introduced in January 1981. As a social welfare measure, the government sought to oversee the collection of zakat (alms) by compulsorily deducting this charity tax from bank accounts.<br>
<br>Islamization, which was stoutly opposed by women's groups and human rights activists, stirred up sectarian tensions between Sunnis and Shi&#145;a. It thus did not provide the ideological glue for Pakistani society for which Zia had hoped. The Shi&#145;a felt increasingly estranged from the state-sponsored Islamization process which encouraged Sunni legal practice.<br>
<br>Karachi experienced mounting ethnic violence from 1986 onwards. Ethnic allegiances had been encouraged by the party-less 1985 elections. Some writers have also claimed that Zia sought to undermine opposition to his regime in Sind by dividing and ruling on ethnic lines in the province. Clashes between <i>mohajirs</i> and Pushtuns, later extended to the Sindhi community. The growing lawlessness was encouraged by the ready availability of weapons and drugs as a result of the war in Afghanistan. Zia justified his dismissal of the hand-picked prime minister, Muhammad Khan Junejo, on 29 May 1988, in terms of the deteriorating security situation. Party-less elections were scheduled for November. However, Zia died on 17 August 1988, following the unexplained crash of his C-130 aircraft minutes after its take-off from Bahawalpur. Others killed in the crash included the US ambassador Arnold Raphel.<br>
<br>Zia's supporters viewed him as a pious Muslim who halted his country's moral decay and contributed to the collapse of the Soviet empire through support for the Afghan freedom fighters. Detractors condemn him as an intolerant and vindictive ruler who cynically manipulated Islam to remain in power. His popularity with certain sections of Punjabi society was demonstrated by the huge crowds of mourners at his burial on 20 August 1988 at the Faisal mosque in Islamabad.<br>
