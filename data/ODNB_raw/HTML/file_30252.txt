<span class="headword">Young,  Andrew</span>  (1807&#150;1889), <span class="occ">hymn writer and poet</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 23 April 1807, the second son of David Young, an Edinburgh teacher, and his wife, Margaret Merrilees. He had a brilliant career in the arts and theological classes at Edinburgh University, where he secured Professor John Wilson's (Christopher North's) prize for the best poem on the Scottish highlands. In 1830 he was appointed by the town council of Edinburgh headmaster of Niddrie Street School, where he taught for eleven years; when he started there were 80 pupils and when he left there were 600.<br>
<br>In 1838 Young wrote his well-known hymn &#145;There is a happy land&#146;, first published in James Gall's <span class="italic">Sacred Songs</span>, and afterwards copied into hymnbooks throughout the world. The words were written to an Indian air which he heard one night played on the piano by a lady. In 1840 he became head English master of Madras College, St Andrews, from which he retired in 1853 to Edinburgh, where he was until his death superintendent of the Greenside parish sabbath school, being also actively engaged in other philanthropic work.<br>
<br>Young was twice married. His first wife, Maria Isabella Mivart, whom he married on 20 April 1844, died in 1847. He then married on 7 August 1851 Christina Lothian Allan, niece of Sir William Allan. Many of Young's hymns and poems were contributed to periodicals. A collected edition was published in 1876 as <span class="italic">The Scottish Highlands and other Poems</span>. Young was found dead in bed at his home, 22 Elm Row, Edinburgh, on 30 November 1889, and his remains were interred in Rosebank cemetery, Edinburgh. His second wife survived him.<br>
