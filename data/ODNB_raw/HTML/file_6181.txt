<span class="headword">Cooke,  Thomas</span>  (1722&#150;1783), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and eccentric</span>, born in Hexham, Northumberland, on 23 October 1722, was the son of John Cooke, a shoemaker at Hexham. He received his education as king's scholar at Durham School, and afterwards entered Queen's College, Oxford (22 February 1743), where he never took a degree. He obtained the curacy of Embleton, Northumberland, and soon was brought into notoriety by the singularity of his religious notions. He maintained that the Jewish ceremonies were not abrogated by the Christian dispensation, and insisted on the necessity of circumcision, supporting his doctrine by his own practice. At this period he assumed the names of Adam Moses Emanuel.<br>
<br>On being deprived of his curacy Cooke moved to London, where he was known as the Bearded Priest, on account of his unusual appearance. Calling himself &#145;a Minister of Christ's Universal Catholick Church&#146;  (Baker, 1.145&#150;6) and urging the necessity of double Sabbath observance and regular mortification, he preached in the streets, and became an author; but as his unintelligible jargon did not sell he was reduced to great distress. Resorting to desperate shifts to relieve himself, he became notorious for soliciting subscriptions for works that were never published, and for helping himself to meals that had not been bought for him, contending that &#145;the goods of fortune should be held in common by all God's creatures&#146;  (ibid.), and producing a range of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew authorities in justification for his conduct. For two or three years he was confined in Bethlem Hospital (Bedlam).<br>
<br>On his release Cooke travelled through Scotland and went to Ireland in 1760. Ultimately he returned to the north of England, and until a few years before his death subsisted on a pension allowed him by the Society of the Sons of the Clergy. Here he occupied himself with writing odes, letters, epigrams, and strictures of one kind or another. His last undertaking involved a plan for the alteration of St Nicholas's Church in Newcastle, and &#145;a project for making, what he called, a grand universal Church upon true evangelical principles&#146;  (Baker, 1.145&#150;6). His death, which occurred at Newcastle upon Tyne on 15 November 1783, is said to have been occasioned by his copying the ascetic practices of Origen too closely.<br>
<br>Cooke published two dramatic works: <span class="italic">The King cannot Err</span> (1762), a comedy, and <span class="italic">The Hermit Converted, or, The Maid of Bath Married</span> (1771), also a comedy. Neither piece was ever performed on the London stage.<br>
