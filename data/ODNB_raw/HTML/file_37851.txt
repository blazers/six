<span class="headword">Phillips,  George</span>  (1806&#150;1877), <span class="occ">analytical chemist</span>, was born in 1806, probably in February. He was probably illegitimate. Nothing definite is known of his education and early life except that he was &#145;bred a grocer&#146;. On 17 February 1826 he received his first certificate of suitability for a post in the excise service. He was appointed &#145;expectant of excise&#146; on 17 April 1827, and to his first post as an assistant on 2 September 1827. Phillips's career was orthodox for the next sixteen years. He served in various parts of the country, reaching the grade of principal officer by 1833.<br>
<br>During this period he became interested in the adulteration of tobacco, an issue of considerable importance in the 1830s and 1840s. Many non-tobacco substances were being mixed with the leaf, causing loss to the revenue, and an act forbidding this was passed in 1842. In order to detect adulterants, a laboratory (the ancestor of the later laboratory of the government chemist) was set up at the excise department headquarters in Broad Street, London, in October 1842, staffed solely by George Phillips. Phillips had, he said, taught himself the principles of chemistry to enable him to detect adulteration. His confidence in his ability was borne out in practice, and by 1857 the amount of adulteration had been considerably reduced.<br>
<br>Phillips married twice, firstly Sophia, with whom he had two children, George (who became a tobacconist and wine merchant) and Elizabeth. Sophia died in August 1856, aged fifty. He married, secondly, a widow with at least two children, Hannah Gocher White (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Wills), on 30 October 1869. There were no children from the second marriage, and Hannah died in December 1876.<br>
<br>In 1844 Phillips gave evidence before the select committee on the tobacco trade. Despite his obvious scientific expertise, the board of excise seems to have had some doubts about his qualifications, and in 1845 instructed him and nine other officers to matriculate at University College, London, and to attend classes in general and analytical chemistry. This early example of government help for education continued until 1858, after which excise officers were trained by Phillips within the laboratory, and examined by outside assessors.<br>
<br>With Thomas Dobson, later secretary to the Board of Inland Revenue, Phillips also carried out a number of experiments of importance to the brewing industry (and to the revenue). The two men were presented by the Treasury with &pound;1000 between them for their services. Other important investigations were carried out by Phillips alone, into the determination of alcoholic strength and the use of methyl alcohol to denature ethanol.<br>
<br>Phillips continued to progress in the service, rising to the grade of surveying general examiner of the first class in 1853. In 1858 the laboratory was reorganized as a separate establishment by the Board of Inland Revenue, with which the excise had been merged; Phillips was appointed principal of this larger laboratory, testing many different substances including food, beer, and spirits, as well as tobacco. He published no major works, but wrote eighteen informative and valuable annual reports, put his name to several government papers, and took out two patents on analytical subjects.<br>
<br>On his retirement on 8 April 1874, Phillips was granted a pension at the rate of his full salary of &pound;750 p.a., for his &#145;peculiar and exceptional services&#146;. This was fully justified in view of his immense work in founding and raising his laboratory to the first rank of importance in the fight against adulteration of food and other substances. He died on 16 January 1877 at his home, 71 Tufnell Park Road, Islington, London; and was buried at Highgate cemetery on 22 January 1877, the burial place of his two wives, and other members of his family.<br>
