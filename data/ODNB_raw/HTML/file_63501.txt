<span class="headword">Chapman,  Charles</span>  (1752&#150;1809), <span class="occ">East India Company servant and emissary to Vietnam</span>, was born on 23 November 1752, son of Charles Chapman (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1796), army officer. After the obligatory attendance at a commercial academy, in his case at Hoxton, Chapman was appointed a writer in the East India Company's Bombay service in 1773. In 1775 he was permitted to go to Bengal, where his father, who had transferred to the company's service, had briefly been commander-in-chief. In Bengal, Chapman was employed in the governor-general's office, attracting the attention of Warren Hastings, who formed a high opinion of his abilities. In return, Chapman became a devoted adherent of Hastings for the rest of his life. Hastings's judgement of his subordinates was usually discriminating and Chapman seems to have been one of the ablest company servants of his generation. Later in his life, however, a friend observed that &#145;quickness and irritability &hellip; are inherent in his nature and mark his character&#146;  (J. Wiltshire to W. Hastings, 28 Dec 1806, BL, Add. MS 29181, fol. 368).<br>
<br>The arrival of two Vietnamese mandarins in Calcutta on a British ship in 1778 gave Chapman an opportunity for distinguishing himself. He volunteered to return to Vietnam with the mandarins as an emissary for the Bengal government. His offer was accepted and an expedition of two small ships was fitted out. Vietnam in 1778 was in a state of political disorder. The Nguyen regime in Annam, whose servants the mandarins were, was losing control to the rebel Tay-son movement and to the Trinh dynasty of the north. Chapman spent time both with the Tay-son leader and with the Trinh authorities now established at Hu&eacute;, capital of Annam. He eventually had to flee from Hu&eacute;, after what seemed at first to have been a favourable reception. He returned to Calcutta in February 1779. He then compiled both a narrative of his time in Vietnam and a report for the Bengal government. &#145;No country in the East&#146;, he wrote, &#145;and perhaps none in the world, produces richer or a greater variety of articles proper for carrying on an advantageous commerce.&#146; The Vietnamese he described as &#145;a courteous, affable, inoffensive race, rather inclined to indolence&#146;  (Lamb, 131, 133). He recommended the dispatch of a small military expedition to establish a trading connection and to frustrate French designs. These recommendations were not followed up.<br>
<br>Chapman's next diplomatic mission was to the Maratha ruler of Berar in central India from November 1781 to November 1783. In the 1770s the East India Company had been drawn into a war with the Marathas. Hastings had successfully negotiated to keep Berar, whose territories extended up to the frontier of Bengal, out of the war. By 1781, however, Hastings was turning his main effort for peace making with the Marathas to Sindhia, a rival of Berar. Chapman's mission was intended to reconcile Mudhoji Bhonsla, the Berar raja, to this initiative. Chapman remained at Nagpur, Mudhoji's capital, for two years, leaving when he felt that he was being treated &#145;with reserve and distance&#146;  (BL OIOC, H 219, p. 317).<br>
<br>Chapman's will reveals that he had a son called Henry, born out of wedlock, presumably with an Indian mistress. (It is possible that this was the natural child whose birth to &#145;Chapman and Elizabeth&#146; was recorded on 11 July 1779  (BL OIOC, N/1/3, fol. 48).) He remained in India after Chapman's return to Britain. Charles Chapman married Mary Williams in Calcutta on 18 February 1784; they appear to have had no children.<br>
<br>From 1786 to 1789 Chapman was on furlough in Britain. On his return to Bengal he took over the management of such assets as Hastings had left behind in India. This involved him in sensitive negotiations with Indians whom he invited to subscribe money to relieve Hastings's financial difficulties during his impeachment. Chapman rose in the Bengal civil service to become the most senior member of the board that managed the revenue of the province. In 1794, having been passed over for the presidency of the board, he chose to leave Calcutta, where he had been unable to save money, and take up a less prestigious but more lucrative appointment, managing one of the company's salt districts in the Ganges delta.<br>
<br>Chapman left India in 1801 with a comfortable fortune, estimated at &pound;70,000. He returned to Bath, where he had family connections, buying a small estate at Bathford on the outskirts of the city. He lived there with some of the children of his brother, who had died in one of the West Indian campaigns. Chapman bought himself into the House of Commons for the borough of Newtown in the Isle of Wight, which he represented from 1802 to 1805 without making any political mark. In the last years of his life he became increasingly addicted to gambling, a pastime for which he had as little aptitude as an &#145;untutored savage from the wilds of America&#146;  (J. Wiltshire to W. Hastings, 18 Dec 1806, BL, Add. MS 29181, fol. 354). Hastings was warned of heavy losses at Bath and of some &pound;5000 lost in a single session in London. Chapman died at home, Bathgate House, Bathford, on 22 March 1809 of the effects of a tumour on his thigh, leaving a much diminished fortune, put at &pound;10,000 in Britain with some property still in India.<br>
