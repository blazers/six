<span class="headword">Taylor,  Rayner</span>  (1747&#150;1825), <span class="occ">composer, organist, and singer</span>, was born in the parish of St Anne, Soho, London, on 27 November 1747, the son of William Taylor and his wife, Susan or Susanna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Petit. He received a thorough musical education as a chorister at the Chapel Royal under Bernard Gates and James Nares, singing at the funeral of George II and the marriage and coronation of George III. Taylor later related that at Handel's funeral (20 April 1759) his hat fell into the composer's grave and was buried with him.<br>
<br>A song by Taylor was performed at Marylebone Gardens in June 1764 and he worked there in the summer as a composer, singer, and organist until 1768. He spent a few months in the choir of Chichester Cathedral from autumn 1767, but was back at Marylebone by the following May. Taylor had settled in Edinburgh by June 1769 as a music teacher and harpsichordist at the Theatre Royal. By this time he was married and in July he sang with his wife and the castrato Giusto Ferdinando Tenducci in a performance of Thomas Arne's English opera <span class="italic">Artaxerxes</span>. Mr and Mrs Taylor spent only the theatre season of 1769&#150;70 in Edinburgh, where her singing but not her acting was praised. At their benefit in April 1770 the Taylors performed his little comic opera <span class="italic">Capochio and Dorinna</span>, to a libretto adapted from Pietro Metastasio, and Alexander Reinagle, his thirteen-year-old pupil, played a harpsichord sonata.<br>
<br>Taylor had moved to Chelmsford, Essex, by 24 January 1772 as a teacher of music and from that September he was also the organist at the parish church. He organized and performed in the annual races week concerts, for which he employed instrumentalists and singers from London and in which in the early years he was joined as a soloist by his wife. Taylor continued to write songs, including &#145;Chelmer's Banks&#146; for a play put on by local amateurs, but he also composed three large-scale anthems that were published in the <span class="italic">Cathedral Magazine</span> (1775&#150;7). His music for the burletta <span class="italic">Buxom Joan</span>, with a libretto by a Chelmsford shopkeeper, Thomas Willett, was performed at the Haymarket Theatre, London, in 1778 and by the Norwich Company in various East Anglian theatres. Taylor's <span class="italic">Six Sonatas</span> for harpsichord with violin and <span class="italic">Six Divertimentos Adapted for Young Practioners</span> were published by joint subscription in 1781, and the large number of female subscribers substantiates the &#145;enormous round of teaching&#146; that he remembered many years later  (Carr, 162). He was still organist at Chelmsford in January 1784, but by September the town had a new organist and Taylor was working in London.<br>
<br>Taylor's musical piece <span class="italic">The Fortune Tellers</span> was performed at Sadler's Wells in April 1784, and his burletta <span class="italic">Circe and Ulysses</span> at the Royal Circus that July. The following summer he became musical director at Sadler's Wells and for seven seasons he composed and compiled music for entertainments, topical spectaculars, and harlequinades. Particularly successful were <span class="italic">The Gates of Calais</span> (1786), based on William Hogarth's painting, and <span class="italic">Champ de Mars</span> (1790), an optimistic response to the French Revolution. In 1790 Taylor failed for the second time to obtain an organist's post in a City church, losing on both occasions to a less skilful woman. He appears to have left Sadler's Wells during the summer of 1791, when the theatre had financial problems and was undergoing a change of management, and that summer he worked as organist and song composer at the Apollo Pleasure Gardens.<br>
<br>Taylor decided to emigrate with his family to America and was there by September 1792, when he gave a concert in Richmond, Virginia, with his pupil Miss Huntley. He worked briefly in Baltimore and Annapolis, where he included <span class="italic">Capochio and Dorinna</span> in a concert, before settling in Philadelphia in 1793. There he remained for the rest of his life as composer, singer, teacher of music, and organist at St Peter's and later St Paul's episcopal churches. Alexander Reinagle had become musical director of the new theatre in Chestnut Street and Taylor assisted him in composing, arranging, and orchestrating music for shows imported from London and for new musical works. In December 1799 he collaborated with Reinagle on a monody on the death of George Washington. His comic afterpiece <span class="italic">Buxom Joan</span> was successfully revived in 1801, but his most ambitious theatre piece was the &#145;grand romantick drama&#146;, <span class="italic">The &AElig;thiop</span> (1814; Yellin, &#145;Music for <i>The &AElig;thiop</i>&#146;, 249). Many of Taylor's songs were published in the United States. He became a naturalized American citizen in October 1809, having married Mary Shocor on 6 September of that year; their infant son, Rayner, lived for only fourteen months. Taylor continued to sing in concerts, pleasure gardens, and clubs, mainly performing lighter pieces of his own composition. He died in Philadelphia on 17 August 1825 and was buried in St Peter's churchyard there. Rayner Taylor was a skilful and versatile composer and an outstanding organist, described by Alexander Reinagle as the equal of the great C. P. E. Bach.<br>
