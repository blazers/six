<span class="headword">Maret,  Philippe</span> <span class="st"> [Philip Marett]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1637), <span class="occ">legal official in Jersey</span>, was born in the parish of Trinity, Jersey, the second son of Charles Maret and his wife, Marguerite, daughter of Noel Le Cerf. He graduated BA from Merton College, Oxford, in 1598. Although his enemies later claimed that he spent time in Spanish seminaries, there is no evidence for this. Maret served as receiver-general in Jersey from his nomination by the governor, John Peyton, on 21 January 1608 until 1615 and concurrently as solicitor-general from 1607 until 1613. He became attorney-general on 14 October 1613 and held that office until 1616.<br>
<br>Controversy surrounded Maret for most of his life, complaints being frequently made about his tenure of office in the island. The two main issues were his combination of the offices of receiver-general and attorney-general and his appointment to those offices by Peyton. Maret's main opponent was the bailiff Jean Herault, who claimed that the right of presentation lay with the king and not (according to his patent) the governor, with whom Herault was already in dispute. Following the discovery in May 1616 that a paper relating to a court case in progress had been removed by Maret, he was summoned to the royal court of Jersey by the <i>d&eacute;nonciateur</i>. Having initially refused to comply, Maret finally entered the court, with his hat on, while the senior jurat, Philippe De Carteret, seigneur of St Ouen, was giving his opinion, and interrupted him, accusing De Carteret of having sent his men to his house by night to assassinate him. Maret was subsequently ordered to ask pardon publicly of God, the king, and the court for his contempt of court, and he was fined 50 crowns for insulting De Carteret. On his refusal to pay he was suspended from office as attorney-general and ordered to appear within forty days before the privy council. In the meantime De Carteret's brother Elie was sworn in as attorney-general on 13 June. In July, Maret was committed by the council to the Gatehouse prison. When he returned to Jersey, he told the court that his case had not been tried, but the bailiff had a letter from the secretary of the council to the effect that Maret had been ordered back to acknowledge his offence. Since he refused to do this he was imprisoned in Jersey, first in Mont Orgueil and then in Elizabeth Castle. From there he petitioned the king that the case be heard before the commissioners Conway and Bird who were coming to Jersey, and he complained, falsely, that he had been fettered and manacled during his imprisonment in the island. In 1617 he brought before the commissioners charges of tyranny and corruption against Herault and charged his enemies, especially De Carteret, of ousting him from office without reason in order to advance their own candidate as attorney-general. The commissioners declared all his charges to be unfounded. In June 1618 Maret was twice ordered to acknowledge his offence and make public submission, the second time on pain of banishment from Jersey.<br>
<br>Maret was often accused by his opponents of being a papist, but there is no evidence for this charge. He always claimed to support the introduction of Anglicanism to Jersey, and he represented the side favouring it at the inquiry before the privy council in 1614 as to whether the Calvinist form of church government should be continued in the island or the Anglican form adopted. He was involved in a protracted dispute with the Calvinist colloquy of the island, and in 1617 he complained that he had been persecuted for a long time by the elders and consistory of the parish of St Helier and been suspended from the Lord's supper.<br>
<br>In 1628 Maret married Martha Lempri&egrave;re, the widow of Elie Dumaresq, seigneur des Arbres in the parish of St Brelade. In the same year he bought the Fief des Arbres from his two stepsons and moved to La Haule. He had one child, Philippe. In 1629 he was elected jurat; although the election was disputed, he remained in office until his death. He became deputy lieutenant-governor in 1632, being sworn in by Lieutenant-Governor Francis Raynsford on 28 January. Maret died on 8 January 1637 at La Haule, and was buried two days later in the church of St Brelade.<br>
