<span class="headword">Detrosier,  Rowland</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Rowley Barnes]</span>  (1800?&#150;1834), <span class="occ">freethinking radical and popular lecturer</span>, was born in London, the son of a Manchester merchant, Robert Norris, and a Frenchwoman named Detrosier. His parents abandoned him soon after his birth and he was adopted by a Swedenborgian tailor from Hulme in Manchester, Charles Barnes, who brought him up as his own son, naming him Rowley Barnes. Following only rudimentary education (at Sunday school and the Manchester Benevolent Vegetarian Institute) he began work in a warehouse at the age of nine. Aged twelve, he was apprenticed to a fustian cutter but six years later, in 1818, gave up this trade to work first at a cotton factory as a maker-up of twist, then at a throstle mill as a reeler and bookkeeper. Despite the ravages of a trade depression and the expense of a wife (whom he married when he was nineteen) and a growing family, he saved enough to buy books, pamphlets, and apparatus and taught himself grammar, rhetoric, French, Latin, mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, botany, and geology. However, by 1821 he was in severe distress and was saved only by the patronage of John Shuttleworth, a local Unitarian and radical, who secured work for him as a salesman and clerk at Benjamin Naylor's cotton-spinning factory. The upturn in his fortunes coincided with his parents' decision to reveal the truth about his upbringing, and Rowley Barnes became Rowland Detrosier.<br>
<br>Shuttleworth's intervention opened up the opportunity for Detrosier to indulge in his passion for education. His great natural talents for speaking and writing had already been displayed at Hulme and Salford Swedenborgian Sunday schools, where he taught science from the age of sixteen. During the early 1820s he lectured widely across the north of England, and especially at Hulme and Salford Mechanics' Institutes, promoting independent working-class self-education to his artisanal audiences. The period 1824&#150;6 also saw him briefly successful in partnership with Marshall, a manufacturing chemist. When the business failed, Detrosier was forced to return to his earlier career, this time as a clerk and buyer to a foreign house in the cotton-twist trade.<br>
<br>Detrosier had been brought up in the Swedenborgian Chapel of the New Jerusalem but as a young man joined the strict vegetarian and teetotal Bible Christian movement of Joseph Brotherton. Recognizing his didactic talents, Brotherton sought Detrosier a position and installed him as minister in the recently raised Brinksway Chapel, near Stockport (ironically nicknamed the Beefsteak Chapel for its adherents' vegetarianism). The ground had been prepared by his earlier lecturing and Detrosier's following became enormous. Encouraged by this, he issued his first publication, <span class="italic">A Form of Public Worship on the Principles of Pure Deism</span> (1827). In this work he proclaimed the utility of morality and the need for a society of universal benevolence.<br>
<br>Detrosier owed his conversion to deism to the strong local presence of Richard Carlile's freethinking movement and it was in the course of debate with militant zetetics some time between 1820 and 1822 that he embraced Paineite radical politics. Although he quickly moved to the centre of working-class radical and republican politics, Detrosier did not become an atheist. Nevertheless, his Enlightenment deism was strong enough to lead Brotherton to eject him from his ministry at the Brinksway Chapel in September 1827.<br>
<br>Detrosier returned to working-class education and accepted the presidency of the self-governing and self-financed New Mechanics' Institution, in Poole Street, Manchester, in March 1829. Although he was not an Owenite, Detrosier's help was sought by the fledgeling Owenite trade union movement under John Doherty and its <span class="italic">Co-Operative Journal</span> records many of his lectures on science and morality in 1829&#150;30.<br>
<br>Detrosier's work at Poole Street also attracted the interest of Francis Place and members of the Place&#150;Bentham circle. He was encouraged to take up lecturing as a full-time career, with a stipend collected for him by Place; and Shuttleworth arranged to have his lecture <span class="italic">On the Necessity of an Extension of Moral and Political Instruction among the Working Classes</span> published in 1831, attracting attention from Lady Byron and Jeremy Bentham. Bentham sent letters and books, encouraging Detrosier in his new belief that moral progress must precede political progress and schooling him in the dangers of untutored democracy. Place chose Detrosier, a Lockean and now a convert to political economy, to serve as secretary of the National Political Union in October 1831, thus confirming his entry into middle-class radical politics. This new milieu secured Detrosier the friendship of John Stuart Mill and introductions to Carlyle, the Saint-Simonian Gustave d'Eichtal, George Birkbeck, and J. A. Roebuck. It also resulted in Detrosier being asked to appear before the factory commission in 1833. He assisted in the preparation of Southwood Smith's report.<br>
<br>Although not a Saint-Simonian, Detrosier accompanied Gregorio Fontana and Gioacchino Prati on their English mission of 1834, as interpreter. This ensured his removal from his lectureship at the London Mechanics' Institution, where he had taught meteorology and pneumatics. A new benefactor, Robert Mordan, found him a position at the New Mechanical Hall of Science in Finsbury, and Detrosier supplemented this by paid writing. He caught a cold returning from his inaugural lecture at the New Stratford Institute, rapidly weakened, and died at his home, in Seymour Street, near Euston Road, London, on 23 November 1834, leaving his body to science.<br>
<br>Detrosier was a child of the Enlightenment, valuing reason above demagoguery. Although he was drawn into ultra-radicalism, popular education and science, not politics, was his sphere, and deism, not atheism, his creed.<br>
