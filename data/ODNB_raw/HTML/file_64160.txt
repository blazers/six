<span class="headword">Trench, Sir  David Clive Crosbie</span>  (1915&#150;1988), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born at Quetta, India, on 2 June 1915, the son of William Launcelot Crosbie Trench, an irrigation engineer, and his wife, Margaret Zephanie Huddlestone. He was educated at Tonbridge School and from 1935 to 1937 at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he gained a reputation as a sportsman and respect both as a student journalist and social activist, in his third year running a camp for the unemployed. Joining the colonial service in 1938, he was posted to the British Solomon Islands protectorate. A secondment in Fiji to the secretariat of the western Pacific high commission, to which he was to return as high commissioner, was followed by secondment to Tonga from where he was recalled in September 1942 to be district officer, Guadalcanal, after the Americans under General Vandergrift began the difficult campaign to dislodge the Japanese. Within a year he was acting resident commissioner and commanding officer of the Solomon Islands defence force, the youngest combatant unit in the empire. He remained in this post until 1946. The defence force was responsible for reconnaissance, the rescue of crashed American airmen, and liaison with the &#145;coast watchers&#146;, who manned observation posts behind the Japanese lines. Respected by the islanders whose loyalty was crucial, fluent in the local pidgin, bold and quick-witted, Trench earned the American Legion of Merit in 1943 and the Military Cross in 1944. In 1944 he married Margaret Gould, an American nursing officer. They had one daughter.<br>
<br>The war over, Trench, appointed secretary to the protectorate government in 1947, enthusiastically planned the rehabilitation and development of the Solomons, displaying his strength as a generalist for whom human relationships outweighed institutional structures. He earned a place at the Joint Services Staff College in 1949, after which he was posted to Hong Kong where he worked initially as assistant and deputy defence secretary, and clerk of councils. After promotion in 1956 he served as deputy financial secretary and as commissioner for labour and mines, gaining a valuable insight into both Communist and Kuomintang communities whose politics were powerful in the trade unions movement.<br>
<br>Highly regarded, Trench's attendance at the Imperial Defence College in 1958 was followed by promotion to deputy colonial secretary, Hong Kong, in 1959. His circle of friends was wide, among both Chinese, with whom he spoke Cantonese easily, and expatriates, whose company he particularly enjoyed at the American and foreign correspondents' clubs where his ready humour and deep belly laugh were appreciated. His own background also gave him an empathy with staff transferred from other colonies, sometimes regarded as interlopers. Consolidating his reputation as a forthright and innovative administrator, in 1961 he was given an opportunity to show his paces back in the Western Pacific, where the high commission was now located in the Solomon Islands.<br>
<br>Welcomed enthusiastically as &#145;ol' friend bilong yumi&#146;, Trench encouraged the Solomons to catch up with what was happening elsewhere by accelerating constitutional development. His understanding of Melanesian society and the difficulties of administering isolated communities in a scatter of islands led him to promote progress by a steady series of comparatively short steps, starting with the election of a majority of unofficial members to the legislative council.<br>
<br>In 1964 Trench returned to Hong Kong as governor. Always a social reformer, he actively promoted low-cost housing and the improvement of factory working conditions. He also sought ways to involve the growing and sophisticated middle class, for whom Hong Kong was both home and future, in areas of government which concerned them without creating the democratic institutions which might have encouraged local conflict between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang. His attention to tertiary education resulted in the widespread growth of local tertiary institutions and a university grants committee. Seeking a representative and active grass roots level of local administration, Trench appointed a working party of middle seniority staff, some with experience of other dependencies, to report.<br>
<br>To Trench's regret their recommendations had to be shelved when the shock waves of Mao Zedong's cultural revolution spilled over the frontier. Students were among the first both to express dissatisfaction with the <i>status quo</i> and to become aware of the reality of 1997 and the end of the New Territories lease. 1966 and 1967 were troubled years in Hong Kong with strikes and spasmodic riots, including demonstrations outside Government House. A big man in every sense, Trench was firm and cool, insisting on a low police profile. With his colonial secretary, Michael Gass, he established under his direct control a strong team of able staff, irrespective of seniority, who effectively began to win the hearts and minds of the people. Trench commented at the time that &#145;people make an awful fuss about these disturbances because we have so few of them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Keesing's Contemporary Archives</span>, July 1967). There was, indeed, less than a 2 per cent outflow of bank deposits from what was already a significant and fast growing economy.<br>
<br>On retirement to Dorset, despite the ill health of his wife, Trench selflessly put to local use his administrative skills and experience. He served as county councillor, from 1973 to 1981 as chairman of the Dorset Area Health Authority, and as deputy lieutenant. He never commented on those who had followed him in Hong Kong and never lost the respect of those who had served under him. He was appointed CMG in 1960 and advanced to KCMG in 1962 and to GCMG in 1969. He died at his home, 6 Allen Close, Child Okeford, Dorset, on 4 December 1988.<br>
