<span class="headword">Bardsley,  John Wareing</span>  (1835&#150;1904), <span class="occ">bishop of Carlisle</span>, was born at Keighley, Yorkshire, on 29 March 1835, the eldest son of the Revd James Bardsley (1805&#150;1886) and Sarah Wareing. He had six brothers, all of whom were ordained. He was educated at Burnley and Manchester grammar schools, and entered Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA in 1859 and MA in 1865. He was awarded a Lambeth DD in 1887. On 24 April 1862 he married Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1833), daughter of the Revd Benjamin Powell of Wigan; they had a family of two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Bardsley was ordained deacon in 1859 and priest in 1860. He was curate successively of St Anne's, Sale (1859&#150;60), and of St Luke's, Liverpool (1860&#150;61), before becoming the perpetual curate of St John's, Bootle (1864&#150;71). Between 1861 and 1864 he was secretary of the Islington Protestant Institute, where he gained popularity as a lecturer and preacher. From 1871 to 1887 he was the perpetual curate of St Saviour's, Faulkner Square, Liverpool, and on J. C. Ryle's appointment as bishop of Liverpool, Bardsley became his domestic chaplain and archdeacon of Warrington. In 1886 he was offered, but refused, the living of Islington parish church, and became instead archdeacon of Liverpool. A popular archdeacon, he became known as an industrious organizer and a fluent preacher.<br>
<br>In 1887 Bardsley became bishop of Sodor and Man, where he developed the theological college. It had been re-established by his predecessor in 1878, and in 1889 Bardsley transferred it to Bishopscourt as Bishop Wilson's Theological School (closed in 1943). In 1892 he was translated to Carlisle, and in his enthronement sermon made clear his intention of not being the bishop of a party, and of being interested in mission rather than controversy. In the following year he formed a sustentation fund for the poor incumbents of the diocese and a retirement pension fund for older clergy. As a bishop he won a reputation as &#145;a firm administrator, a wise counsellor and above all, a faithful friend&#146;  (<span class="italic">Church and People</span>, 16, 1904&#150;5, 151) and was much respected by his clergy. Bardsley was a lifelong total abstainer and his simplicity was shown in his use of &#145;Carlisle&#146; and not &#145;Carliol&#146; in his episcopal signature. Although a moderate evangelical himself, he was tolerant of Anglo-Catholic practice. He travelled in the Middle East, particularly to the Holy Land, and when in Egypt in 1898 had an attack of food poisoning from which he never fully recovered. He died of heart failure at his episcopal residence, Rose Castle, outside Carlisle, on 14 September 1904, and was buried at Raughton Head. From a memorial fund a monument was placed in Carlisle Cathedral and &pound;1300 given to the Bishop Bardsley Memorial Clergy Pension Fund.<br>
