<span class="headword">Gower, Sir  Thomas</span>, first baronet  (1584&#150;1651), <span class="occ">local politician</span>, was born in Stittenham, Yorkshire, the son of Thomas Gower and Mary, daughter of Gabriel Fairfax of Steeton. Stittenham had been the family estate since the twelfth century. Gower married Anne, daughter of John D'Oyley, on 28 May 1604, and the couple had five sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46974/', "Thomas Gower (1604/5&#150;1672)")</script>, D'Oyley, Howard, William, and Edward, and one daughter, Margaret. In 1620 Gower was high sheriff of Yorkshire, and he was created baronet on 2 June 1620. Anne, Lady Gower, died on 28 October 1633, and he later married Mary, a widow with a daughter and a granddaughter, both also called Mary.<br>
<br>In the decade of unrest before the civil war the Gower family appeared to be co-operating with the king's opponents. In 1629 Sir Thomas was fined &pound;50 in the court of Star Chamber. In 1632 he made some critical remarks about Sir George Radcliffe, the king's attorney for the council of the north and a friend of Thomas Wentworth, the lord president. Wentworth attempted to cite Gower for contempt but Gower fled with his family to London and established himself in Holborn. Wentworth's officers attempted to arrest him but he claimed that the council of the north had no authority to arrest him outside its jurisdiction. Gower became somewhat of a hero in Holborn for his defiance of the king's prerogative court. Wentworth appealed to the privy council in December, accusing Gower of &#145;many contempts&#146; and &#145;scandalous words&#146; to Radcliffe, and claiming that the council could not rule in the north without &#145;coercive power &hellip; to compel the parties to an answer&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1631</i>, 450&#150;51). Gower was returned to York by the privy council and he spent several months in confinement. In 1640 he and his son Thomas signed a petition drawn up by Yorkshire gentry requesting the king to cease billeting soldiers in citizens' homes without their consent. The document cited the petition of right as justification for the protest.<br>
<br>Despite their previous activities Gower, with his five sons, joined the royalist forces in June 1642. He also lent the king &pound;1500. During the confusion of the war that year Sir Thomas Gower and Lord Thomas Savile were arrested by the earl of Newcastle on suspicion of complicity in a plot to seize Queen Henrietta Maria on her journey from the coast to York, and to deliver her to parliament as a hostage. Savile was confined in Newark Castle for six months, but he later refuted the charge before the king at Oxford. Savile was repudiated, and Newcastle publicly apologized for arresting him. Gower was not convicted or punished, and there is general doubt concerning the validity of the charges. The <span class="italic">Journal of the House of Lords</span> recorded in 1647 an order in parliament that the treasurers of Weavers' Hall were to repay Thomas Gower &pound;6000 &#145;for the payment of private soldiers&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>addenda</i>, <i>1625&#150;49</i>, 707). In the latter years of the conflict the elder Gower served in Newark garrison for the king.<br>
<br>During the interregnum both Gower and his son were declared delinquent and were forced to compound, the father paying a &pound;200 fine. On 13 June 1651 Gower's wife, Mary, at that point in good health, following the agreement in their marriage settlement, made a will leaving her estate to her daughter, Mary, wife of Francis Topham of Upper Bradley, Yorkshire, and giving substantial bequests to five great-granddaughters, daughters of Mary and George Spencer. She died within a few weeks, however, and the will was proved on 13 August. Gower himself died on 20 October that year and was buried at St Margaret of Huttons Ambo, North Riding of Yorkshire.<br>
