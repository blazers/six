<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Picton,  James Allanson</span>  (1832&#150;1910), <span class="occ">politician and author</span>, was born on 8 August 1832 in Liverpool, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22218/', "Sir James Allanson Picton (1805&#150;1889)")</script>, and his wife, Sarah Pooley (<i>d</i>. 1879). His early education was at Liverpool high school and at the city's mechanics institute. At the age of fifteen he entered the office of his father, who was an architect in Liverpool. In 1850 he resolved to study for the ministry and was accepted by Lancashire Independent college at Manchester. He simultaneously attended Owens College at Manchester. This brought him into contact with Alexander John Scott, principal of Owens College from its opening in 1851. In 1831 Scott had been deposed from the ministry for heresy by the general assembly of the Church of Scotland. Scott's influence can be traced among a number of leading Independent ministers of liberal views and intellectual gifts through the 1860s and 1870s, but in none more than in Picton, who held him in very high esteem. In particular he followed Scott in emphasizing the human nature of God manifested in Christ and the sacredness of all the created world.<br>
<br>Picton followed a course at Owens College that led to his taking an MA at London University in 1855. He then made an academic tour of Halle, Heidelberg, and Leipzig, returning to play a principal part in the defence of Dr Samuel Davidson, his tutor at Lancashire College, who was accused of heresy. Having thus identified himself with theological liberalism, Picton found difficulty in securing a call to ministry in an Independent (Congregational) church. In 1857, however, he became minister of Cheetham Hill church, Manchester, where he promoted popular lectures. In 1862 his sermon, &#145;Christian law of progress&#146;, attracted an accusation of heresy against Picton himself. He removed to Gallowtree Gate Church, Leicester, in that year, continuing his commitment to popular education and becoming president of the Leicester Library and Philosophical Society. He moved to St Thomas's Square Chapel, Hackney, in 1869.<br>
<br>Picton was one of the chief promoters of the so-called Leicester Conference, a meeting for liberal Congregationalists which was held to coincide with the Congregational Union's autumn assembly at Leicester in 1877. The meeting was the focus of the tension between the conservative evangelical strengths of traditional Congregationalism and the theological liberalism of ministers such as Picton and, at that time, Peter Taylor Forsyth. Liberalism itself was diverse; Picton represented that strand of it which minimized the importance of the sacraments and of trinitarianism, arguing that the church should be held together by spiritual union rather than rituals and creeds. Part of the criticism of the Leicester Conference platform, designed to bring together those &#145;who value spiritual religion, and who are in sympathy with the principle that religious communion is not dependent upon agreement in theological, critical or historical opinion&#146;, was that it served as a stalking horse for unitarianism. Other critics simply lamented the undue influence of F. D. Maurice on the participants.<br>
<br>Although some of those who supported the Leicester Conference had seen in it an opportunity to use the Congregational principle of tolerance to bring liberal and conservative theology together within the Congregational Union, the majority of the assembly were critical of the most radical aspects of liberalism. People such as Picton, and his friend and fellow minister Mark Wilks, moved away from the formal circles of the Congregational Union after the Leicester meeting. Picton made a farewell speech to organized Congregationalism at the spring assembly of 1878, and his name was withdrawn from the <span class="italic">Congregational Year Book</span> in 1879 on technical grounds. Wilks's name continued on the list until his death but Picton, after an initial complaint about the way he had been treated, moved into politics and writing, relinquishing his ministry in Hackney. In his complaint to the Congregational Union, Picton described himself as a &#145;well-known Independent minister&#146;, and no doubt felt that he could continue as such with or without formal sanction. His writings became more historical and philosophical in their themes. He lectured at the South Place Ethical Society and developed his interest in Spinoza, publishing a handbook to his ethics in 1907.<br>
<br>Picton was a lively writer, both in his books and in more ephemeral publications. His journalism included contributions to the <span class="italic">Christian World</span>, the <span class="italic">Theological Review</span>, the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>, the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>, <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, and the <span class="italic">Weekly Despatch</span>, a radical journal for which he supplied frequent leading articles.<br>
<br>After Picton's withdrawal from the Congregational Union he took up public life in London as a member, from 1870 to 1879, of the first London school board, where he was joined by Wilks; he also acted as a magistrate. Through the influence of his Leicester friends Picton became the successful Liberal candidate there in 1884, succeeding Peter Alfred Taylor, whose opinions he largely shared.<br>
<br>Although he was not an unqualified admirer of Gladstone, Picton spoke in support of him and the <span class="roman">Irish Home Rule Bill</span> of 1886. He took an interest in the plight of crofters in Scotland. He opposed vaccination. His preferred strategy in parliament, especially in opposition, was to pursue ministers with questions rather than to speak in debates. His speech in an education debate of 1885 revealed his support for kindergartens, phonetic teaching of reading, and the Froebel philosophy of education. He often asked questions on religious issues, which were usually critical of the Church of England and supportive of nonconformist rights.<br>
<br>Picton was small in stature and given to complex argument, which did not help him to dominate the house. His predisposition to radical views and general angularity seem to have kept him from office, and he retired from the House of Commons in 1894 at a comparatively early age and went to live at Caerlyr, Capel Ulo, near Penmaen-mawr, Caernarvonshire. He learned Welsh and was a member of the county council until 1909. He continued to write, though the distance from London made his regular contribution to the <span class="italic">Christian World</span> impossible. In these later years his religious views were heavily influenced by rationalism, but he retained a sense of the transcendent. For Picton, God was present in people and the created world. While rejecting the divine inspiration of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> he emphasized its intrinsic authority and ability to inspire people, but only within Christian cultures. These views are set out in his books <span class="italic">The Bible in School</span> (1901) and <span class="italic">Man and the Bible</span> (1909). He believed that the sacred scriptures of other religions played a similar role in their respective countries. He equated the kingdom of God with &#145;the triumph of rational socialism&#146;.<br>
<br>Picton was twice married. His first wife was Margaret Beaumont of Manchester and his second wife, whom he married in 1866, was Jessie Carr, daughter of the publisher Sydney Williams. Of his four sons, one survived him. After his death at Caerlyr on 4 February 1910 he was cremated at Liverpool, the nearest crematorium, and one of the first three in England (cremation being at that time still a radical gesture).<br>
