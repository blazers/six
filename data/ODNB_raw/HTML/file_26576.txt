<span class="headword">Stone,  John Hurford</span>  (1763&#150;1818), <span class="occ">radical and printer</span>, was born at Taunton, in Somerset. After losing his father in childhood, he was sent to his uncle, William Hurford, coal merchant and common councilman in London, and, with his younger brother William, he appears to have succeeded to his uncle's business.<br>
<br>A Unitarian and member of Richard Price's congregation in Hackney, Middlesex, Stone became friends with Joseph Priestley and imbibed the radical political ideas associated with both men. A member of the London Revolution Society, on 29 September 1790 he presided over the reception of two delegates from the Nantes Jacobin Club, who were impressed by Stone's grasp of European languages and literature. In February 1792 he offered his services to the French diplomat Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand, who was on a mission in London to secure British neutrality in the impending European conflict. He entertained Talleyrand in his Hackney home, where the French envoy met Priestley, Charles James Fox, and Richard Brinsley Sheridan. Stone also corresponded with J&eacute;r&ocirc;me P&eacute;tion, then mayor of Paris, and secured his support for the establishment of a sal ammoniac factory there. It was primarily for this purpose that he moved to Paris with his wife, Rachel Coope (about whom further details are unknown), arriving on 18 April 1792. He became involved with the British expatriate community and particularly <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29509/', "Helen Maria Williams (1759&#150;1827)")</script>, whom he had probably met in the early 1780s, being a subscriber to her <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1786) and a fellow member of metropolitan nonconformist circles. Stone applauded the French republic and, while abhorring the bloodletting of the September massacres, described them as a deterrent for counter-revolutionaries. On 18 November he presided over the British expatriates' celebrations of French military victories. He feuded with the Welsh radical David Williams. In May 1793 Stone testified for General Francisco del Miranda, who was arraigned for treason but acquitted. Meanwhile he established a printing house, the Imprimerie Anglaise, which in July produced Joel Barlow's epic, <span class="italic">The Vision of Columbus</span>.<br>
<br>With the arrest of all British subjects by the decree of 9 October, Stone was imprisoned with his wife, but they were released on 30 October because of his political principles. At liberty for most of the terror, Stone advanced 12,000 francs to secure the escape from prison of St&eacute;phanie de Genlis's husband. She later refused to honour this debt and accused Stone of stealing money and manuscripts from her. Stone was denounced as an agent of Pitt, and he and Rachel were rearrested on 24 April 1794, but freed the next day on condition that they left the country. In July he was divorced by his wife and in the same month accompanied Helen Maria Williams and Benjamin Vaughan to Switzerland, where they remained for six months. Critics speculated on the nature of Stone's relationship with Williams, though the latter subsequently maintained that Stone, also a close friend of Williams's wider family, had merely been provided with &#145;an asylum in his misfortunes, a thing common amidst the storms of revolution&#146;  (Kennedy, 126). Throughout this period Stone continued to write to his brother William, discussing business and politics. These letters were to be the foundation of the prosecution's unsuccessful case against William for treason in January 1796, and their incriminating nature meant that Stone could never return to Britain. After the terror he lived in Paris with Williams, who sank 40,000 francs into the printing business. In 1798 William Cobbett published an intercepted letter from Stone to Priestley, prompting the latter to repudiate Stone's desire for a French invasion of Britain. From 1795 Stone's press produced works by Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson, and Constantin de Volney, among others. He was ruined in 1812 by the cost of producing the thirty-volume <span class="italic">Voyage de Humboldt et de Bonpland</span>. In 1796 Stone published his own <span class="italic">Letter to Dr Priestley</span>, in which he defended the French Revolution, and, in 1806, a defence of Unitarianism under the pseudonym Photinus. Naturalized a French citizen along with Williams in 1817, Stone died the next year in Paris, and was buried in the city's P&egrave;re Lachaise cemetery, where Williams was later interred.<br>
