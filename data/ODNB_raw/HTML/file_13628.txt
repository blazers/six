<span class="headword">Holyoake,  Henry</span>  (1657&#150;1731), <span class="occ">headmaster</span>, was probably born in Warwickshire, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13629/', "Thomas Holyoake (1616&#150;1675)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13627/', "Holyoake, Francis")</script>], physician and former clergyman, and Anne his wife; his grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13627/', "Francis Holyoake (1566x73&#150;1653)")</script>. In 1672 he was elected to a choristership at Magdalen College, Oxford; he matriculated on 12 March 1674 at the age of seventeen. From 1676 to 1681 he was a clerk and sub-librarian there. He graduated BA on 22 October 1678, proceeded MA on 4 July 1681, and was chaplain of his college from 1681 notionally until 1690, although he left with the fellows ejected by James II and did not return.<br>
<br>On 7 February 1688 Holyoake was appointed headmaster of Rugby School. Despite the smallness of his salary and other disadvantages, he was credited with &#145;recovering the creditt and reputation of the schoole&#146;  (Rouse, 377), and was the first to engage an assistant master. Among his pupils was Edward Cave, whose precocity led to his becoming a general scapegoat, until eventually even the headmaster turned against him and (allegedly) sent him away. Cave, however, would recall Holyoake as &#145;universally esteem'd for his singular learning and humanity&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 126). Meanwhile Holyoake was instituted successively to the Warwickshire rectories of Bourton upon Dunsmore on 30 June 1698, Bilton on 31 August 1705, and Harborough Magna on 9 November 1712.<br>
<br>Holyoake died unmarried at Rugby on 10 March 1731 and was buried in St Mary's Church, Warwick, where he had erected an inscription written by himself to his own memory and that of his father and grandfather. His domestic establishment had been managed by his cousin Judith Holyoake, to whom he left a legacy on the express ground of her having been &#145;very serviceable and seemingly kind&#146; to the boys. He bequeathed &pound;30 to the daughter of Widow Harris, his &#145;tripe-woman&#146;, the interest on &pound;200 to the poor of Rugby after the death of his cousin Elizabeth Holyoake, and all his books and family portraits (none of either being extant) to Rugby School  (Colvile, 430).<br>
