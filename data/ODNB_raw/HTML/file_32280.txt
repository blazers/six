<span class="headword">Cannon,  Herbert Graham</span>  (1897&#150;1963), <span class="occ">zoologist</span>, was born on 14 April 1897 at Wimbledon, Surrey, the third of the four children of David William Cannon, a compositor in the firm of Eyre and Spottiswoode, and his wife, Alice, the daughter of Charles Graham, who owned and drove one of the first horse-buses to run in south London.<br>
<br>When Cannon was about five years old the family moved to Brixton. He attended the local council school, from where he won a scholarship to Wilson's Grammar School in Camberwell. Following a serious accident at the age of sixteen, when he fell from a window while sleepwalking (and suffered several compound fractures), he found strenuous exercise impossible. In 1916, being unfit for war service, Cannon went up to Cambridge as a choral scholar of Christ's College to read for the natural sciences tripos. In 1918 he passed part one with first-class honours in zoology, chemistry, and physiology. Instead of continuing with part two, he obtained leave of absence to take up a temporary post as naturalist in the board of fisheries laboratory at Conwy, returning to Cambridge in January 1919 to complete the three years of residence necessary for the BA degree.<br>
<br>For a while Cannon thought of taking up research in experimental zoology, for which he was well qualified. However, he was unable to get a post in Cambridge and, encouraged by his experiences at Conwy with a variety of living marine animals, he turned his attention to the problems of interpreting animal structure and the nature of animals' developmental processes in terms of their functional significance and adaptational value.<br>
<br>In 1920 Cannon was appointed a demonstrator in the department of zoology at Imperial College, London, under Professor E. W. MacBride, a powerful and provocative advocate of the Lamarckian view of the evolution of organisms through the inheritance of acquired characters. Through MacBride, Cannon became friendly with W. T. Calman, deputy keeper of zoology in the British Museum (Natural History), and an authority on Crustacea, a subphylum which appealed strongly to Cannon as material for research; and in 1922 he began the long series of skilful investigations of the embryology, feeding mechanisms, and general anatomy of the Crustacea which established his reputation as a zoologist.<br>
<br>In 1926 Cannon was appointed to the chair of zoology at Sheffield University, where in the space of five years he published several important papers, three in collaboration with Sidnie Milana Manton (1902&#150;1979). It had long been known that many crustaceans can feed by filtering small organisms from the surrounding water, and that by complicated limb movements they can themselves generate feeding currents, thus drawing food to their mouths. Together with Manton, Cannon studied the structure and motion of the limbs in relation to feeding currents made visible through the movements of particles and dyes. Limb movements were analysed by stroboscopic viewing and the sites of filtration and particle transfer traced by microscopic examination of sections of animals with their limbs carefully preserved in their natural relationships.<br>
<br>In 1927 Cannon married Annie Helen (Nannie), a zoologist, and graduate of Edinburgh, the daughter of Edwin J. Fyfe of Edinburgh. The couple had four children, and the marriage was happy.<br>
<br>Cannon was regarded as a fine lecturer. He used plain language delivered with an actor's generous use of gestures and emphasis, and he was watchful of the responses of his audience. Forthright and uncompromising in the defence of his beliefs, and quick to react to criticism, he was nevertheless warm-hearted and generous. He took an especial pleasure in beautiful things, whether they were natural or artefacts. His main hobby was the collection and annotation of elegantly worked swords and furnishings, on which he was an authority. In his later years his thoughts turned to evolutionary topics, and he wrote <span class="italic">The Evolution of Living Things</span> (1958) and <span class="italic">Lamarck and Modern Genetics</span> (1959).<br>
<br>Cannon was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1927 and a fellow of the Royal Society in 1935. He died in St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, on 6 January 1963, shortly after being flown home from Las Palmas, where he had become seriously ill while on a recuperative voyage.<br>
