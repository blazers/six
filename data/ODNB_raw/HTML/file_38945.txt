<span class="headword">Pringle,  John Quinton</span>  (1864&#150;1925), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Glasgow on 13 December 1864, the second son and second child in the family of seven sons and one daughter of James Christie Pringle (1837&#150;1896), a railway employee, and his wife, Jane Bowie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davidson (1840&#150;1893). He lived in Glasgow all his life except during the years 1869 to 1874 when the family lived at Langbank on the River Clyde, near Port Glasgow, where his father was stationmaster. He left school in 1876 and was apprenticed to an optician until 1878. In 1896 he set up his own business as an optician and repairer of small items of domestic equipment at 90 Saltmarket, Glasgow.<br>
<br>In 1883&#150;5 Pringle attended evening classes in art organized by the Glasgow schools board and was awarded a bursary to attend evening classes at the Glasgow School of Art, which he did from 1885 to 1895, supplemented by some early morning classes. Among his fellow students was Charles Rennie Mackintosh. His final session at the school was in 1899&#150;1900. He won the South Kensington national competition gold medal for life drawing in 1901.<br>
<br>As the subjects for his oils and watercolours Pringle took themes from his home and near by, his family and one or two friends, old buildings and back courts, and the street near the tenement where he lived; his portraits at that period have an intensity rare in Scottish painting and recall the work of William Dyce and the Pre-Raphaelites. He was a pioneer in depicting townscapes and back courts seen unromantically, rendering them with a detached viewpoint and restrained affection. He adopted the technique of applying paint using the square brushstroke which derived from the French <i>plein-air</i> painter Jules Bastien-Lepage, whose work was shown at the Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts in 1883 and 1886. For the rest of his life he used the square brushstroke, later diluting the oil paint with turpentine to get a consistency almost like watercolour.<br>
<br>Pringle began to paint fanciful pictures in the late 1880s. <span class="italic">Children at the Burn</span> (1889, Tate collection), for example, is a landscape painting to which figures of children were later added. Girls and young women featured frequently in his landscapes. In the mid-1890s he began to paint miniatures, usually commissioned portraits. Some paintings of the period 1895 to 1905 have something of the flavour of Glasgow art nouveau. After opening his own shop he seems to have painted less, though his keenness to make pictorial experiments increased. From about 1906 he heightened his palette and his brushstrokes became looser and sometimes smaller, akin to the technique of the French neo-impressionists: he would not have seen work by Georges Seurat or Paul Signac but probably saw examples of Henri Le Sidaner's paintings, similar to neo-impressionism, shown at the Glasgow Institute between 1903 and 1906.<br>
<br>In 1910 Pringle made his only visit to the continent, staying at Caudebec in Normandy for ten days painting landscapes. His output was probably less than 100 oils, mainly small in scale. On only three occasions was his work shown outside Scotland during his lifetime: some miniatures were on view at the fifteenth secessionist exhibition in Vienna in 1902 and three works were shown in &#145;Twentieth century art: a review of modern movements&#146;, an exhibition at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, London, in 1914, probably on the initiative of Fra Newbery, director of the Glasgow School of Art, who had a high regard for Pringle's art and greatly regretted that he did not paint full-time. Pringle's sister died in 1911 and he did not paint again in oils until 1921. In 1922 sixty-eight of his works were shown in an exhibition which was highly praised at the Glasgow School of Art, and one, <span class="italic">Muslin Street</span> (1895&#150;6, City Art Centre, Edinburgh), was bought for presentation to a public gallery. Later, also in his lifetime, a landscape, <span class="italic">Caudebec</span>, was presented to the Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum. His other notable paintings include <span class="italic">Back Court (Bartholomew Street), Glasgow</span> (watercolour, 1887, British Museum, London), <span class="italic">Two Figures at a Fence</span> (1904, Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum), <span class="italic">Poultry Yard Gartcosh</span> (1906, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh), <span class="italic">Children at Play</span> (1906) and <span class="italic">Tollcross, Glasgow</span> (1908, both Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow), and <span class="italic">The Window</span> (1924, Tate collection). There is a miniature by him in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.<br>
<br>Pringle gave up his optician's business in 1923 but had only a short time left to paint, as he died, unmarried, in East Kilbride, near Glasgow, of liver cancer on 21 April 1925. He was buried in Sandymount cemetery, Shettleston, Glasgow. The Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum has a large collection of his works, and there are works by him in most major art galleries in Scotland.<br>
