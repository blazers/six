<span class="headword">Dill, Sir  Samuel</span>  (1844&#150;1924), <span class="occ">classical scholar and educationist</span>, was born on 26 March 1844 at Hillsborough, co. Down, the eldest son of the Revd Samuel Marcus Dill (<i>d</i>. 1870), DD, Presbyterian minister of Hillsborough, later professor of systematic theology and first president of Magee College, Londonderry, and his wife, Anna Harrison, daughter of James Cowan Moreland, of Hillsborough. The family of which he came was founded by a soldier of Dutch descent in William III's army, and gave noted ministers, writers, and controversialists to Irish Presbyterianism. One of his brothers became headmaster of Foyle College, Londonderry.<br>
<br>Dill was educated in Belfast at the Royal Academical Institution and the Queen's College, where he took his degree in arts in 1864. He then went, as a scholar, to Lincoln College, Oxford, and obtained first classes in classical moderations (1867) and in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1869). In 1869 he was elected fellow and tutor of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Later he became librarian and dean of the college, and was made an honorary fellow in 1903. In 1877 Dill was appointed high master of Manchester grammar school&#151;this being the last appointment to that post made by a president of Corpus. During his headmastership the school was reorganized; new buildings were erected and school societies developed. Dill was equally effective as administrator and teacher. His liberal conception of education is illustrated by his development of the teaching of modern subjects, and by the connection that he established between the school and working boys' clubs. He attached particular importance to developing the corporate life of the school outside the classroom. A former pupil, Gordon Hewart, described him as &#145;one of the very few men who appear to the boy to be heroes, and throughout life never lose that character&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 27 May 1924). In 1884 Dill married Fanny Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Cadwallader Morgan of Shrewsbury. They had three daughters.<br>
<br>Dill resigned his headmastership in 1888 and devoted himself to the preparation of his first book. In 1890 he returned to the Queen's College as professor of Greek. As a member of the Belfast University Commission, he took a large share in transforming the college into a university in 1909. He was chairman of the viceregal committee of inquiry into primary education (1913&#150;14), whose unanimous report he drafted. A supporter of the claims of teachers for decent salaries and security of tenure, he influenced Irish education by his work as a member, and later as chairman, of the intermediate Board of Education. He was a man of strong religious feeling. A Presbyterian by birth, in his later years he became more identified with the Church of Ireland. His views were unionist, but he took no part in politics, being on friendly terms with H. H. Asquith and receiving a knighthood from the Liberal government in 1909 for his services to education.<br>
<br>Dill was best known as a writer. His literary power and productiveness gave him a high rank among the ancient historians of his day and country. In 1898 he published <span class="italic">Roman Society in the Last Century of the Western Empire</span>, which was followed in 1904 by <span class="italic">Roman Society from Nero to Marcus Aurelius</span>. Then at the age of sixty he turned to a wide and ill-mapped field. His <span class="italic">Roman Society in Gaul in the Merovingian Age</span>, edited and published posthumously in 1926 by his son-in-law, the Revd C. B. Armstrong, showed much of his old gift but also the lack of his finishing touch. Although not research in the technical sense, Dill's works were founded on a thorough study both of the primary and secondary sources. Less histories of a period than studies of the life of societies in dissolution or in spiritual crisis or decay, they reveal his moral and religious sympathies. Their interest, combined with the lucidity and charm of their style, attracted the general reader as well as the scholar.<br>
<br>Dill received the honorary degrees of LittD from the University of Dublin, and of LLD from Edinburgh and St Andrews. He resigned his professorship in 1924, and died at Montpelier, Malone Road, Belfast, on 26 May of that year.<br>
