<span class="headword">Oakes,  John Wright</span>  (1820&#150;1887), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born on 9 July 1820 at Sproston House, near Middlewich, Cheshire. He was educated in Liverpool and studied art under John Bishop at the Liverpool Mechanics' Institute. He was then apprenticed to a house decorator and followed this trade until about 1846, when he turned full-time to painting. At about the same time, or shortly afterwards, he married. His wife had a successful corset-making business, and it may have been her wealth, rather than a growing reputation, that enabled him to relinquish his trade.<br>
<br>Oakes's earliest works were fruit pieces. He first exhibited at the Liverpool Academy in 1839 with <span class="italic">Fruit</span>, priced at 5 guineas. About 1843 he began painting landscapes, making studies among the sand dunes and beaches of the Wallasey peninsula. An early work was entitled <span class="italic">Sketch on the Lancashire Coast</span>. Oakes began modestly but developed &#145;a brilliant, almost unerring, sense of composition, a fine perception of light, atmosphere, and colour and the poetry of nature&#146;  (Bryan, <span class="italic">Painters</span>, 4.31). Many of his landscapes were dark and heavy in colour, but these characteristics were less evident in his larger and finer canvasses. As he progressed he made less use of heavy impasto and bitumen, artifices common in his earlier works. His favourite locations were in Scotland, Ireland, Devon, and particularly Wales, where he painted many pictures of mountain, moorland, and coastal scenery. A few pictures of Swiss subjects, painted during a foreign tour, were much less successful than the studies of countryside that he knew well, such as north Wales and Anglesey.<br>
<br>In 1846 Oakes exhibited ten landscapes of local or Welsh subjects at Liverpool Academy, of which he was elected an associate the following year. He became a full member in 1850 and served as its honorary secretary from 1853 to 1855. A man of &#145;practical sagacity&#146;  (Bryan, <span class="italic">Painters</span>, 4.30), he was described as &#145;probably the best secretary that the Academy ever had&#146;  (Marillier, 183). The practice of pricing pictures in the academy catalogue was introduced during his regime. In 1855 he moved to London and afterwards seldom exhibited in Liverpool. The Walker Art Gallery possesses one of his landscapes, <span class="italic">A North Devon Glen</span>, depicting a group of cattle in a shady pool lit by an autumn sun.<br>
<br>In 1847 Oakes sent <span class="italic">Nant Frangcon, Carnarvonshire</span> to the British Institution; it was his first work to be exhibited in London. It was followed in 1848, at the Royal Academy, by <span class="italic">On the River Greta, Keswick</span>. Thereafter he was represented at the Royal Academy almost every year until his death, exhibiting a total of ninety works there. He also sent twenty-eight pictures to the British Institution, eleven to Suffolk Street, and over twenty-four to galleries elsewhere in London. Oakes painted in watercolours as well as oils, and in 1874 he was elected an associate of the Institute of Painters in Water Colours. He resigned in 1875, doubtless prompted by ambition to be elected an associate of the Royal Academy. He was elected ARA the following year, but was never elected a full academician. Among his best works were <span class="italic">The Bass Rock in Calm</span> (1867), &#145;a fine sunset picture&#146;  (Marillier, 187); <span class="italic">Moreton Mill</span> (1869), a sea piece with fishing boats on a transparent green sea; and <span class="italic">The Reaper's Rest</span> (1886), a large canvas depicting swallows circling over a pool of water, against a background of cornfields and trees.<br>
<br>Oakes was &#145;of sturdy appearance, more like a sea-captain than a painter, much marked by small-pox&#146;  (Bryan, <span class="italic">Painters</span>, 4.31). Serious and retiring by nature, he habitually wore an elegant frock coat and black satin waistcoat. He was unusual in that he did not allow people to watch him paint, although he did sketch with other artists, notably his close friend John Bishop. From 1881 Oakes suffered chronic ill health due to asthma, which greatly interfered with his art. He nevertheless continued to paint, and in 1883 he was elected an honorary member of the Royal Scottish Academy. Oakes died at his residence, Leam House, 34 Addison Road, Kensington, on 8 July 1887, and was buried in Brompton cemetery. He left a daughter, Emily. There was a sale of his remaining pictures at Christies on 10 March 1888, which realized almost &pound;4000. His painting <span class="italic">The Warren</span> was exhibited posthumously at the Royal Academy that year.<br>
