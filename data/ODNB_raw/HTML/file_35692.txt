<span class="headword">Rawson, Sir  Harry Holdsworth</span>  (1843&#150;1910), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, second son of Christopher Rawson of Woolwich, JP for Surrey, and his wife, Frances Emily Wright, was born at Walton on the Hill, Lancashire, on 5 November 1843. He was at Marlborough College from February 1854 to Christmas 1855. Rawson entered the navy on 9 April 1857, and was appointed to the <i>Calcutta</i>, flagship of Sir Michael Seymour, on the China station. He served through the Second Opium War, being present in the <i>Calcutta</i>'s launch at the capture of the Taku (Dagu) forts in 1858, and in 1860 he was landed as aide-de-camp to Captain R. Dew of the <i>Encounter</i>, with whom he was present at the second capture of the Taku forts, at the battle of Palikiao (Baliqiao), and at the taking of Peking (Beijing).<br>
<br>Rawson saw much active service against the Chinese rebels; for the capture of Ningpo (Ningbo), which he afterwards held for three months against the rebels with 1300 Chinese under his command, and for Fungwha (Fenghua), where he was severely wounded, he was mentioned in dispatches. He was also thanked on the quarter-deck for jumping overboard at night in the Shanghai River to save life. Rawson was promoted sub-lieutenant on 9 April 1863, and lieutenant a month later. In the same year he was one of the officers who took out to Japan the gunboat <i>Empress</i>, a present from Queen Victoria to the emperor and the first ship of the modern Japanese navy. Rawson then qualified as a gunnery lieutenant, and after serving a commission as first lieutenant of the <i>Bellerophon</i> in the channel, was appointed in January 1870 to the Royal yacht, on which on 7 September 1871 he was promoted commander. In August 1871 he gained the silver medal of the Royal Humane Society for saving life at Antwerp. He married on 19 October 1871 Florence Alice Stewart, daughter of John Ralph Shaw of Arrowe Park, Cheshire; they had five children.<br>
<br>As commander Rawson served two commissions in the <i>Hercules</i>, in the channel, and in the Mediterranean, and on 4 June 1877 he was promoted captain. In the November following he was appointed to the <i>Minotaur</i>, as flag captain to Lord John Hay, commanding the channel squadron; and, after going to the Mediterranean in 1878, he received the thanks of the Admiralty for a report on the capabilities of defence of the Suez Canal. He hoisted the British flag at Nicosia, Cyprus, and was for a month commandant there. Following this service he was again flag captain in the channel squadron, this time until March 1882, and he was then appointed to the troopship <i>Thalia</i> for the Egyptian campaign, during which he served as principal transport officer. He was awarded the third class of the Osmanieh, and the CB. From February 1883 to September 1885 he was flag captain to Lord John Hay, at that time commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, and in October 1885 he became captain of the steam reserve at Devonport, where he remained until 1889. He was a member of the signal committee of 1886, was captain of the battleship <i>Benbow</i> in the Mediterranean from 1889 to 1891, and became an aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria in August 1890, a position he held until promoted to flag rank on 14 February 1892.<br>
<br>Rawson was a member of the international code signals committee from 1892 to 1895; in 1893 he was one of the umpires for the naval manoeuvres, and in May 1895 he was appointed commander-in-chief on the Cape of Good Hope and west coast of Africa station, with his flag in the cruiser <i>St George</i>. He held this command until May 1898, and during it organized and carried out two expeditions. In August 1895 he landed at Mombasa the naval brigade which, with a force of askaris, captured Mweli (some 15 miles from the coast), the stronghold of Mbarak bin Rachid, a Mazaria chief. In August 1896, following the unexpected death of Sultan Hamed bin Thwain, part of Rawson's squadron bombarded the palace at Zanzibar and deposed the claimant, Seyyid Khalid. Rawson received the Brilliant Star of Zanzibar, first class, in acknowledgement from the sultan; his action was officially approved, and he received the thanks of the Admiralty. In February 1897 he landed in command of a naval brigade from his squadron, with which, together with a force of Hausa, he advanced to Benin city to punish the massacre in January of British political officers, led by J. R. Phillips, the acting consul-general. In March Benin was captured and looted, then accidentally burnt. Rawson was created KCB in May 1897. On 19 March 1898 he was promoted vice-admiral.<br>
<br>Rawson commanded the channel squadron from December 1898 to April 1901, after which he was appointed president of the committee which investigated the structural strength of torpedo-boat destroyers. This was his last naval service. In January 1902 he was appointed governor of New South Wales, &#145;a post for which his tact, kindliness, and good sense were sturdy qualifications.&#146; Lady Rawson died in the Red Sea on 3 December 1905, while on passage to Australia. Despite this personal tragedy Sir Harry was a successful and popular governor, and in 1908 his term of office was extended by one year to May 1909. He was promoted admiral on 12 August 1903, and retired on 3 November 1908; he was made a GCB in June 1906 and a GCMG in November 1909. He died at 3 Devonshire Terrace, Marylebone, London, following an operation for appendicitis, on 3 November 1910, and was buried at Bracknell parish church on 8 November, a memorial service being held at St Margaret's, Westminster.<br>
