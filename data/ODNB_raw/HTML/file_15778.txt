</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Knox,  Alexander</span>  (1757&#150;1831), <span class="occ">theological writer</span>, was born in Londonderry, in the north of Ireland, on 17 March 1757, the son of Alexander Knox (<i>d</i>. 1770), a man of independent property and a leading member of the corporation of Londonderry, who was descended from the Scottish family to which the celebrated reformer John Knox belonged. His mother, whose name is unknown, died in 1792. Knox's lifelong poor health prevented him from passing through a regular course of school education, but his later writings and reputation for learning attest to his thorough grounding through extensive reading at an early age in the classics and divinity, as well as general literature.<h2>
<a name="DebttoMethodism"></a>Debt to Methodism</h2>A seminal influence on Knox's early religious development and later life was his boyhood and youthful contact with the founder of Methodism, John Wesley, who had enlisted his parents into one of his societies in Londonderry in 1765, during the course of his tenth visit to Ireland. Wesley wrote twenty letters between 1776 and 1785 to the young Alexander Knox (addressed as &#145;My Dear Alleck&#146;) that were full of religious and practical advice. Knox was an intelligent but very delicate youth. From his earliest years he &#145;had been afflicted with attacks of epilepsy, attended by depression of spirits of the most painful character&#146;  (<span class="italic">Thirty Years' Correspondence</span>, 2.24). Wesley convinced him of the providential nature of his afflictions as designed &#145;to balance the natural petulance of youth&#146; (1 April 1777; ibid., 25). Knox was for a time a member of one of Wesley's societies, but a growing spiritual independence caused him to withdraw before the age of twenty. He remained an admirer of Wesley's original system, arguing that &#145;never, elsewhere, except in the Apostles themselves, and in the sacred books they have left, were the true foundation, and the sublime superstructure of Christianity, so effectually united&#146;  (to Joseph Butterworth, 25 Sept 1807; <span class="italic">Remains</span>, 1.74). Likewise, to his friend John Jebb, Knox insisted that in &#145;John Wesley's views of Christian Perfection, are combined, in substance, all the sublime morality of the Greek Fathers, the spirituality of the mystics, and the divine philosophy of our favourite platonists&#146;  (19 July 1804; <span class="italic">Thirty Years' Correspondence</span>, 1.143). Knox insisted, however, that it was to his mother rather than to John Wesley that he owed his early religious education and &#145;whatever I have gained of true peace&#146;  (to Mr Butterworth, 25 Sept 1807; <span class="italic">Remains</span>, 1.70). He found that the &#145;methods of Methodist piety were so much pointed to present effects, to the producing something new, that they seemed, when at all resorted to, to disturb my animal spirits too much&#146;. A Sunday spent worshipping with the Methodists in Liverpool in 1802, on account of the dryness of Anglican pulpit discourse in the locality, convinced him &#145;that a quieter, more equable, more gradual course, was the one indicated for me to walk in&#146;  (ibid., 71). In the same letter he made clear that &#145;I never called Mr. Wesley, Rabbi&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Knox's lifelong personal devotion to Wesley's memory, his abiding sense of Wesley's providential role in recalling the contemporary church to an emphasis on holiness of life, and the importance of emotion in religion, however, were only partially offset by his own later, independent thinking on the primitive church and a high-church emphasis on apostolic order and authority. To the end Knox defended Wesley against a variety of different critics. In 1802 he published a defence of Wesley against a Calvinistic clergyman, John Walker, fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, who had published <span class="italic">Expostulatory Address to the Members of the Methodist Society in Ireland</span>. Knox's published remarks on this publication elicited a &#145;defence&#146; from Walker. In 1822 he composed a defence of Wesley against Robert Southey's life of him as <span class="italic">Remarks on the Life and Character of John Wesley</span>; Southey himself was so impressed with Knox's defence that he decided that any new edition of his own biography of Wesley should carry it as an appendix. Moreover Knox kept up his Methodist connections, befriending and becoming the patron of the young Adam Clarke, a Methodist preacher who became a notable Orientalist. He also attended the annual Methodist conference in Ireland as late as 1807.<h2>
<a name="Publiclife"></a>Public life</h2>Knox became active in political life during the 1790s. He was a friend of moderate parliamentary reform at the beginning of that decade, and remained an advocate of Roman Catholic emancipation and of a moderate endowment of the Irish Catholic priesthood. However, alarmed by events in France and at the proceedings of the United Irishmen (with which he had some early connections) and by the unrest and subsequent rising of 1798, he moved in a more conservative political direction. In 1798 he was appointed private secretary to the chief secretary for Ireland, Robert Stewart, Lord Castlereagh. His political skills as an administrator in this post were underpinned by a profound historical understanding of the philosophical principles of government and the peculiar conditions of Ireland, and were reflected in his <span class="italic">Essays on the political circumstances of Ireland during the administration of Lord Camden; with an appendix containing thoughts on the will of the people</span> (1799), which was written at intervals between 1795 and 1797 and originally intended as papers &#145;for insertion in newspapers, or for circulation in the form of handbills&#146;.<br>
<br>Knox's public career was cut short in August 1799, when, as he later recalled, &#145;I was obliged from nervous disposition to leave Ireland&#146;  (Baird Evans, 24). He had the highest respect for Lord Castlereagh, whom he praised as &#145;the honestest and perhaps the ablest statesman that has been in Ireland for a century&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remains</span>, 4.31), and Castlereagh reciprocated his regard. As late as 1811 Castlereagh was pressing Knox, unsuccessfully, to write the history of the Union so as to confront &#145;the demons of the present day&#146;  (ibid., 539). Castlereagh had urged Knox not to resign, and later urged him to accept an offer to represent his native city, Londonderry, in the United Kingdom parliament. Knox was not dissuaded from his original intention and entirely abandoned public life. Some far-fetched reasons, relating to apparent blemishes in his private life, have been adduced for his decision. The literalness of Knox's own admissions in a fragmentary diary (only part of which survives: see <span class="italic">Remains</span>, 4.41&#150;5, 55&#150;61), wherein he upbraided himself for having involved himself in scenes of dissipation from early manhood until about 1797, has been questioned by G. T. Stokes. Knox has been the subject of gross, racy, and unreliable anecdotes from hostile sources, perhaps originating in disapproval of his changing political allegiances in the 1790s. For example, William Fitzpatrick, who sneeringly referred to Knox as having &#145;made himself useful as a scribe during the reign of terror&#146;, alleged that Knox underwent an act of bodily self-mutilation prompted by &#145;the madness and illegality of&#146; an unrequited passion for the beautiful young wife of the chief secretary, Robert Peel  (Fitzpatrick). This story is discredited by the fact that Peel only assumed the post in 1812 and was unmarried at the time when Knox is supposed to have fallen for his wife.<h2>
<a name="Religiousretirement"></a>Religious retirement</h2>Whatever the truth in respect of disorder in Knox's private life it can be safely assumed that it was his overriding theological interests and craving for solitude that lay at the root of his decision to retire. As his evangelical friend Hannah More noted, &#145;Having been a grand instrument in accomplishing the great work of the Union, he turned his back upon politics and politicians, and lives in a religious retirement&#146;  (H. More to W. Wilberforce, 24 Sept 1804, Bodl. Oxf., Wilberforce MS d. 15, fol. 71). Knox lived the last thirty years of his life in retirement, either at Bellevue, Delgany, outside Dublin, at the residence of the La Touche, a Huguenot banking family, or in his own bachelor quarters at 46 Dawson Street, Dublin. His life was one almost of a hermit, interrupted only by occasional visits to the country homes of friends. He was always plagued by a melancholy and at times neurotic temperament. None the less, in view of reports both of his brilliance as a conversationalist and of his being a gentleman of refined and exquisite taste, the image of an eccentric recluse and invalid requires modification. Moreover, it is significant that his health notably improved on his retirement and that after 1803 his epileptic fits disappeared and his state of nervousness diminished.<h2>
<a name="Highchurchmanship"></a>High-churchmanship</h2>It was during the long, later years of his retirement that Knox emerged as a profoundly original religious thinker, earning the sobriquet &#145;the sage of Bellevue&#146;, while his friend J. S. Harford called him &#145;the Plato of Bellevue&#146;. One of the most formative personal contacts of his life after that of John Wesley was his close friendship with John Jebb, bishop of Limerick from 1823, whom he first met when Jebb was at Londonderry School. The names of Knox and Jebb became inextricably linked as representatives of a theological school. Knox used his close contacts with Charles Agar, archbishop of Dublin (1801&#150;9), and Charles Brodrick, archbishop of Cashel (1801&#150;22), to smooth the clerical career of the young Jebb. The two friends toured England together in the summer of 1809.<br>
<br>Knox's theological position has been the subject of discussion, most notably by G. T. Stokes and Yngve Brilioth. Although he was influenced by the Methodist system and maintained close contacts with the so-called Claphamite evangelicals&#151;notably Hannah More and William Wilberforce&#151;Knox was a high-churchman of sorts but kept his distance from the &#145;high and dry&#146; contemporary variant of high-churchmanship. Knox, like Jebb, was distinctly high-church in his teaching on the sacraments, insisting on the reality of the efficacy of sacramental grace in both baptism and the eucharist, as exemplified in his <span class="italic">On the Doctrine Respecting Baptism Held by the Church of England</span> (1820) and in <span class="italic">An Enquiry on Grounds of Scripture and Reason into the Use and Import of the Eucharistic Symbols</span> (1824). Knox defended the English Reformation on Catholic grounds, regarding it as a restoration of the early church as a court of appeal. He identified much more with the eucharistic doctrine of Nicholas Ridley than that of Thomas Cranmer. He took a high-church line in asserting that the catholicity of the Church of England was based on its unbroken episcopate and on the merits of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. For Knox the main strength of the Anglican liturgy lay in its apparent mediation of the piety of the early church. One of the abiding themes of his thought was gratitude for what he regarded as the providential escape of the Church of England from various attempts, whether from the direction of Geneva or Rome, to despoil her of her liturgical and apostolical inheritance. Those eighteenth-century establishment figures who went astray into Arianism or Socinianism or in the direction of dissent&#151;such as Samuel Clarke, Benjamin Hoadly, and Theophilus Lindsey&#151;did so, he argued, because they &#145;seem never to have been capable of feeling the peculiar excellencies of our liturgical forms&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remains</span>, 1.98). His view of Anglican catholicity was also rooted, as he showed in a letter, &#145;On the fathers of the Christian church and on Catholic tradition&#146;  (ibid., 277&#150;313), in his application of the celebrated dictum of St Vincent of Lerins&#151;<i>quod ubique, quod semper, quod eadem</i>&#151;as the doctrinal standard of the Church of England. Newman's later idea of the <i>via media</i> found expression in Knox's words to Jebb in a letter of 1813: &#145;What perverse influence the nickname of Protestant has had upon our Church &hellip; It will perhaps be at length discovered, that there is a <i>medium</i> between the two extremes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Thirty Years' Correspondence</span>, 2.122).<br>
<br>Knox aligned himself with high-churchmanship and against evangelicalism in his understanding of the doctrine of justification. In opposition to Joseph Milner and other Anglican evangelical exponents he wrote &#145;Letter to Mr Parken on justification&#146;, in which, like Wesley, he criticized the &#145;forensic&#146; doctrine of justification. In contrast Knox defined justification as the acquisition of a condition of inward or interior&#151;and not merely outward or formal&#151;righteousness, and identified baptism with justification. He sought to read this interpretation of justification as a moral change into the articles and homilies of the Church of England. At the same time Knox was sensitive to evangelical charges of formalism against high-churchmen. He reacted strongly against sterile forms of the establishmentarian high-churchmanship of his day. In a memorable passage in a letter to a friend he made clear his position:<blockquote>Now, I am a Churchman in grain&#151;not a Tory Churchman, for that is a disease in the Church, not its constitutional turn; nor yet a Whig Churchman, for they do not value enough the distinguishing features of our Establishment. But, if I may use the term, I am a primitive Churchman. (<span class="italic">Remains</span>, 4.206&#150;7)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Evangelicalism"></a>Evangelicalism</h2>This outlook brought Knox closer to Anglican evangelicals as well as to Methodists. In a letter of 1816, &#145;On the situation and prospects of the established church&#146;, Knox condemned the spirit in which &#145;the present champions for what they think high church orthodoxy, are combating their &#147;Evangelical&#148; opponents&#146;, lamenting that in this quarter &#145;inward religion is little less than systematically exploded&#146;  (ibid., 1.58). Thus when during the so-called Blagdon controversy over Sunday schools, in 1802, Hannah More endured the obloquy of some high-churchmen Knox privately defended her as &#145;one of the most truly evangelical divines of this whole age&#146;  (Roberts, 3.161). Knox even went so far as to claim: &#145;Hannah More and I are substantially of the same school, that is, we both make it our object to pass through the form of Godliness to the power thereof&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remains</span>, 4.174&#150;5). More reciprocated Knox's compliments, regarding him as &#145;the most intellectual and spiritual man I ever knew&#146;  (H. More to W. Wilberforce, 24 Sept 1804; Bodl. Oxf., Wilberforce MS d. 15, fol. 75). Knox's closeness to More was also revealed by the close hand that he had in her publication <span class="italic">Hints towards Forming the Character of a Young Princess</span> (1805). He was friendly towards, but kept a critical distance from, the leading high-church faction in the church, the so-called Hackney phalanx. He admired individuals in that group but disliked what he regarded as their rigidity and narrowness, even claiming in 1816 that the &#145;old high church race is died out&#146; (A. Knox, &#145;On the situation and prospects of the established church&#146;, 1816, in <span class="italic">Remains</span>, 1.54).<br>
<br>Knox and Jebb certainly parted company with most contemporary high-churchmen in their regard not only for evangelicalism and some puritan worthies such as Richard Baxter but also for the more religious strain in the latitudinarian tradition, as exemplified by Sir Matthew Hale, lord chief justice in Charles II's reign, and notably the whig historian Gilbert Burnet, bishop of Salisbury under William III. In his preface to Jebb's edition of <span class="italic">Lives, Characters, and an Address to Posterity by Gilbert Burnet, Late Bishop of Sarum</span> (1833) Knox approved Hale's tenderness towards nonconformists on the ground that it proceeded from &#145;puritanic presuppositions&#146; rather than &#145;latitudinarian indifference&#146;  (p. lii). Knox's high regard for Burnet and historic latitudinarianism puzzled his Anglican evangelical friends as well as stricter high-churchmen. Hannah More, bemused by a present that Knox left her to give to William Wilberforce&#151;Burnet's <span class="italic">Lives</span>, &#145;of which he is very fond&#146;&#151;observed:<blockquote>His chief delight is in contemplation and inward religion; but he is not in all points in our way. He is of the Platonic Christian school, a disciple of Cudworth, Lucas, Whichcote, Scougal, Worthington, and Joseph Mede. In our disputes, however, I tell him that while Leighton and Baxter are his favourites, we shall not quarrel much. (H. More to W. Wilberforce, 24 Sept 1804, Bodl. Oxf., Wilberforce MS d. 15, fols. 70&#150;71)</blockquote>After Jeremy Taylor, Knox's favourite spiritual authors were Henry Scougal (<span class="italic">Life of God in the Soul of Man</span>), John Worthington (<span class="italic">On Resignation</span>), and Richard Lucas (<span class="italic">Inquiry after Happiness</span>). Knox's influence on the Claphamite circle of Anglican evangelicals was such, however, that Henry Thornton privately conceded to Hannah More that evangelicals like themselves had much to learn from the &#145;manliness and sublimity&#146; exhibited in the religion of Knox and Jebb but &#145;which we lamentably want&#146;  (H. Thornton to H. More, 9 Sept 1809 CUL, Add. 1/L4, fols. 104&#150;5). Some Irish evangelicals on the other hand were less tolerant of Knox's departure from accepted evangelical doctrinal norms than their English Claphamite counterparts.<h2>
<a name="RomanCatholicism"></a>Roman Catholicism</h2>Knox's attitude to the Roman Catholic church and the question of reunion was also distinctive and the subject of controversy. Anglican evangelical friends, whom he strove to persuade into supporting Catholic emancipation, could be taken aback by his conversational championing of aspects of Roman Catholic teaching and by his eirenicism towards the Church of Rome. In a work defending the idea of Catholic emancipation Knox urged his protestant contemporaries to recognize the debt that the Church of England owed to the Roman Catholic church as &#145;having been the instrument of so much good to us&#146; in terms of liturgical and devotional treasures  (A. Knox, <span class="italic">An Answer to the Rt Hon. P. Duigenan's Two Great Arguments Against the Full Enfranchisement of the Irish Roman Catholics</span>, 1810, 41). Like Wesley, Knox was an avid reader of Roman Catholic devotional writers such as Thomas &agrave; Kempis, M. De Renty, and Fran&ccedil;ois de Sales, even complaining in a letter to Hannah More in December 1806 that protestantism was deficient in producing saints and saintliness. On the other hand Knox regarded his espousal of the Vincentian rule as the strongest barrier possible against the claims of the Roman Catholic church, which he regarded as being a &#145;mental yoke&#146; enslaving the individual conscience. He responded respectfully and cordially, but in the negative, to the plan for reunion of the churches put forward by the Roman Catholic controversialist James Doyle, bishop of Kildare and Leighlin, in 1824. In a letter to Thomas Newenham, in which he recorded his conviction on the impossibility of any such union unless the Church of Rome parted &#145;with its essence&#146;, Knox none the less asserted in favour of the Roman Catholic church:<blockquote>I neither join in the charge of idolatry with which it is so customary to brand her; nor do I censure her tenets on many points which she has been condemned by Protestant controversialists. In many of these instances, I humbly think there is more truth on her side than on theirs. (A. Knox, <span class="italic">Letters on the Re-Union of the Churches of England and Rome</span>, [1824], 28&#150;9)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Death"></a>Death</h2>Knox, who never married, died in Dublin on 17 January 1831. A major treatise on the epistles to the <span class="roman">Romans</span> and <span class="roman">Hebrews</span> on which he had laboured fitfully since 1817 remained uncompleted. Some of his evangelical friends, including the Revd Thomas Kelly, claimed that in his very last years and on his deathbed he abandoned what they regarded as the erroneous points in his theories, had a conversion experience, and embraced doctrinal evangelicalism. The claim, propagated in an article in the evangelical <span class="italic">Christian Observer</span> in August 1836, was publicly rejected by others of Knox's friends, such as James Hornby, and by a reviewer in the high-church <span class="italic">British Critic</span> in 1838, while Bishop Jebb's nephew John Jebb considered it based on &#145;the most profound ignorance of that venerable person's character&#146;  (J. Jebb to J. Hornby, 2 Oct 1836; TCD, MS 6398, letter 53). A monument to Knox was erected, at some time after his death, in St Ann's Church, Dublin, where he used to worship. A stained-glass window dedicated to his memory was erected in the same church in the early 1860s.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>Knox has been claimed as a religious prophet and as &#145;a Christian Socrates&#146; whose influence was as disturbing to protestant divinity as &#145;a comet upon the orbit of our globe&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remains</span>, 1). He has been compared to Samuel Taylor Coleridge as an original religious thinker and credited with anticipating Coleridge's famous distinction between the reason and the understanding. More controversially he has been viewed as a bridge between Wesley and Newman. There was enough in Knox's theological principles and teaching to give some credence to Stokes's contention that Knox, along with his friend Jebb, was a harbinger of the Oxford Movement. James Hornby, who edited the four volumes of Knox's <span class="italic">Remains</span> (1834&#150;7), was the first to make this claim, arguing that there was no catholic doctrine for which the authors of <span class="italic">Tracts for the Times</span> were then contending that Knox had &#145;not been fighting over, and winning solid ground for, during the whole of the present century&#146;  (Hornby to Newman, 31 March 1840; <span class="italic">The Letters and Diaries of J. H. Newman</span>, ed. C. S. Dessau and others, 31 vols., 1973&#150;7, 7.288). Certainly Knox's high doctrine of the Christian priesthood and apostolic succession, together with his advanced sacramental teaching, marks him out as a genuine precursor of the Tractarians. His view of justification as an &#145;imparted&#146; rather than &#145;imputed&#146; source of &#145;righteousness&#146; also closely foreshadowed Newman's position in his <span class="italic">Lectures on Justification</span> (1838). Building on the evidence of these similarities Stokes famously asserted that &#145;Wesley begat Knox, and Knox begat Jebb, and Jebb begat Rose and Pusey and Newman&#146;  (Stokes, 190).<br>
<br>Stokes, however, overstated his case in making Knox the fount or origin of the Oxford Movement, and in his estimate of the extent of Wesley's influence transmitted by Knox on Newman (who in fact had a low opinion of Wesley). Newman conceded that Knox had played a part in the broader preparation of the ground that enabled the Oxford Movement to take root in the 1830s: &#145;Could we see the scheme of things as angels see it, I fancy we should find he has his place in the growth and restoration (so be it) of Church principles&#146;  (Newman to S. Rickards, 9 Feb 1835; J. H. Newman, <span class="italic">Letters and diaries</span>, 5.27). Stokes, however, overlooked Newman's and especially Keble's reservations about Knox's teaching. Newman, while conceding to Robert Wilberforce in June 1838 that he had &#145;read very little&#146; of Knox, remarked that he &#145;seems to say dangerous things &hellip; I should be unwilling to think him more than an eclectic, though that is bad enough. Froude did not like him. I think his works on the Eucharist have done much good&#146;  (D. Newsome, <span class="italic">The Parting of Friends</span>, 2nd edn, 1993, 197). Taking his cue from Froude's criticisms, Newman later hardened his attitude against Knox, telling the editor of Knox's <span class="italic">Remains</span> bluntly:<blockquote>I deliberately formed the opinion from the various works of his which I read, that he did not hold the Apostolical Succession in the sense in which Mr Froude held it; and that he entertained opinions less strict and definite than the Catholic Church teaches. (Newman to Hornby, 13 April 1840, J. H. Newman, <span class="italic">Letters and diaries</span>, 7.303)</blockquote>E. B. Pusey's biographer H. P. Liddon drew attention to &#145;the slight use&#146; that the Oxford school made of Knox's writings, explaining that:<blockquote>the Tractarians felt that they could not claim him as a whole; and they were certainly not indebted to him for anything which they knew of Catholic antiquity or Catholic truth. But they did occasionally use him as being a witness in dark times, to portions of the truth which they were reasserting; and in this sense he may be described as a precursor of the Oxford revival. (Liddon, 262)</blockquote>Similarly Dean Church immediately challenged Stokes's argument as being built upon insufficient material. Church concluded: &#145;The Oxford men found their doctrines where Wesley in his younger days found them, and where Knox found them afterwards, but quite certainly they did not find them through Knox or Wesley&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 7 Sept 1887).<br>
<br>The mature Tractarian estimate of Knox can be compared to that of the young W. E. Gladstone before he had quite abandoned the traces of his own early evangelicalism. Gladstone's development from a youthful evangelicalism to a high-church position was influenced by his reading of Knox's religious writings, but initially his view of Knox was ambivalent. In a private memorandum composed on 24 May 1835 he praised the way in which Knox had &#145;in the first place vindicated, one may almost hope for ever, against the outrages of the scoffer and the saturnine contempt of formalism, the great and essential doctrine of an inward and vital religion&#146;. However, as well as criticizing Knox's &#145;denial of a forensic justification&#146; Gladstone found Knox's religion to be too &#145;individualised&#146;, recognizing &#145;no brotherhood&#146;. &#145;There are few temperaments,&#146; he concluded, &#145;which could afford to adopt this isolated method of religion, without serious perhaps fatal detriment&#146;  (Gladstone papers, BL, Add. MS 44724). Despite Gladstone's misgivings Knox has proved a seminal religious thinker of the period.<br>
