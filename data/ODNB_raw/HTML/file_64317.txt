<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Johnston,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1792&#150;1817), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor and radical</span>, was a half-pay officer in the armed forces. Some time before the 1790s he married a Miss Home, niece of Francis Home, physician. By at least 1811 he owned property in North Charlotte Street in Edinburgh's expanding New Town. Between 1792 and 1794 he was resident at 20 North Frederick Street, also in the New Town, another indication of his gentle status. Henry Cockburn later noted that Johnston had been &#145;a respectable man, and a gentleman in his manners&#146;  (Cockburn, 118).<br>
<br>Although Johnston chaired the meeting which saw the birth of the Scottish Friends of the People, held in Edinburgh on 26 July 1792, his importance in Scottish and Edinburgh radical circles was principally owing to his establishment of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Gazetteer</span> in September 1792&#151;one of only two radical papers founded in Scotland in the 1790s. (The other was the <span class="italic">Caledonian Chronicle</span>.) Two months later he was voted the thanks of the Friends of the People at a meeting in Edinburgh of delegates from constituent radical societies throughout Scotland. In the proposals for the paper Johnston promised early and impartial news of international events; to convey early and prompt intelligence of public abuses; full coverage of important developments in the worlds of commerce, the arts, sciences, politics, and amusements of the nation; and to devote special attention to events in France. This last promise was given added importance because of the hostile comment on, and coverage of, the French Revolution and French military fortunes in the rest of the contemporary Scottish press. In July of the following year delegates of all the radical societies of the county of Renfrew voted thanks to both the radical papers for &#145;the impartial manner in which they disseminated truth and political knowledge&#146;  (Meikle, 129 n. 1). <span class="italic">Look before ye Loup</span>, a loyalist pamphlet of 1793, also alluded to the eagerness with which French news carried by the <span class="italic">Gazetteer</span> was digested by weaver radicals. The proposals also made clear the reformist intent of the paper. It was, they declared, attached to the &#145;British constitution for which our fathers shed their blood&#146; and &#145;not to those defects produced by time and by the efforts of bad men&#146;  (NA Scot., RH 2/4/64, fol. 320).<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Gazetteer</span> quickly became the mouthpiece of the Scottish Friends of the People, being used as the vehicle for the circulation of radical addresses and motions and the advertisement of radical pamphlets and handbills, as well as the dissemination of information about radical activities throughout the British Isles, not least Ireland. As early as November 1792 one informant from Montrose told Lord Advocate Robert Dundas that they believed the paper &#145;has done more hurt than anything else&#146;  (NA Scot., RH 2/4/65, fols. 156&#150;7). Copies of both the <span class="italic">Gazetteer</span> and the <span class="italic">Caledonian Chronicle</span> were also regularly forwarded to the home secretary, Henry Dundas, in London. From November Johnston's mail was being intercepted and he was being &#145;closely watched&#146; by the authorities (NA Scot., RH 2/4/65, fols. 48&#150;53; RH 2/4/68, fols. 11&#150;12).<br>
<br>Although he was, by late 1793 certainly, a supporter of universal suffrage and annual parliaments, Johnston's temperament and disposition were those of a moderate. In a series of letters to the leading Scottish radical William Skirving, written some time before the third general convention of the Scottish Friends of the People, held in the Scottish capital in the autumn of 1793, he urged a posture of &#145;candour, firmness and constitutional integrity&#146;. He also counselled the need for unanimity and a conciliatory attitude towards those who supported more moderate measures of reform. In the same correspondence he characterized his position as that of &#145;intrepid moderation&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 23.65&#150;70).<br>
<br>Johnston displayed essentially the same attitude at both the first and the third conventions of the Scottish Friends of the People. At the former, held in Edinburgh in December 1792, he proposed two resolutions, the first of which recommended that all radical societies expunge from the roll of membership any individual who acted &#145;illegally, tumultuously, or in any way to the disturbance of the public peace&#146;. The subject of the second was the defence of those who, despite having behaved &#145;legally and orderly&#146;, found themselves &#145;prosecuted by the arm of power for adhering to the cause of the people&#146;. The previous month had seen a series of riots in Dundee, Perth, and other places in Scotland, which appeared to ministers and their supporters to be linked to, if not promoted by, the Friends of the People. As chairman of the convention&#151;this was a rotating office&#151;Johnston also led a number of delegates to Goldsmiths' Hall to sign a loyal address being promoted by a newly established loyal association in the capital, the Goldsmiths' Hall Association. In 1793 Johnston was no longer a delegate but a visitor to the convention. He participated in a debate on 29 October opposing a proposal to petition the king on the subject of reform as unconstitutional and likely to lead to &#145;ruin&#146;  (NA Scot., JC 26/276). He later claimed that he did not attend from 19 November, when the convention was reconvened following the arrival in Edinburgh of several English radicals. He was, however, present on 30 November. By this stage the convention, under the influence in part of the bolder English delegates, had taken on a more strident radical edge, symbolized by the change of title, on 23 November, to the British Convention of the Delegates of the People, Associated to Obtain Universal Suffrage and Annual Parliaments.<br>
<br>Johnston's caution was reflected in the contents of the <span class="italic">Gazetteer</span>. Against a background of official anxiety about radical activity and a marked disposition to use the courts to suppress it, it is striking that the paper escaped hostile attention, at least from ministers, until the end of 1793, by which time Johnston had severed his links with it. On 22 January 1793 the editor declared that he had refused to publish a letter from a &#145;constant Reader&#146; in Montrose on the ground that it &#145;seems to espouse Republican sentiments, with which we can never coalesce&#146;. Johnston's enthusiasm for the venture, moreover, dampened in February after he was called, along with the paper's printer, Simon Drummond&#151;also a member of the Friends of the People&#151;to attend the high court of justiciary to answer a charge of contempt of court for a report in the paper of the trial of three journeymen printers for sedition in the previous month. Although Johnston claimed that he had been ill at the time of publication (15 January 1793)&#151;a story lent weight by an inflammation of the eye which prevented his initially attending court&#151;both he and Drummond were found guilty and sentenced to three months' imprisonment. Johnston also had to find sureties for &pound;500 for three years for good behaviour on his release. Bonds for that purpose were entered into by fellow radical James Campbell, a writer to the signet, and Francis Home, his wife's uncle. That Johnston was chastened by this experience was evident when he refused in March 1793 to publish resolutions in the paper opposing the war against France drawn up by Thomas Fyshe Palmer, who was himself to become a victim of judicial repression later in the same year. Johnston had taken the precaution of submitting the resolutions to his lawyer, &#145;who rejected them in <i>toto</i>&#146;  (NA Scot., RH 2/4/70, fol. 82).<br>
<br>By March 1793 Johnston was exploring ways of divesting himself of the paper. On 27 March one of Lord Advocate Robert Dundas's regular informants wrote that he had &#145;certain information&#146; that the <span class="italic">Gazetteer</span> and <span class="italic">Caledonian Chronicle</span> were to be given up, unless a plan was settled on for their rescue  (NA Scot., RH 2/4/70, fols. 139&#150;40). A meeting of radicals, including Skirving, was held for this purpose on the following day. Johnston was willing to give up the paper for &pound;400 in ready cash; he claimed to have invested around &pound;700 in its establishment. There appears to have been considerable support for some sort of rescue package, from Skirving and from radical societies outside of Edinburgh, reflecting the value of the paper to the movement. There was, however, no quick solution. On 2 April Johnston was succeeded as publisher by <a name="cosubject_64317"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Scott</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1793), <span class="occ">printer and radical</span>. By June it was being reported that Johnston was about to leave for America. His terms were by now considerably easier; he was willing to make over to Scott the types and printing apparatus upon payment of simple interest on the sum he had invested. The principal was not to be paid back for at least three years. On 20 June Johnston's terms were agreed to by the Edinburgh general committee of Friends of the People; &pound;500 was to be raised through subscriptions to fund running expenses, and this money was to be managed by committee.<br>
<br>In 1794 Johnston, together with Campbell and Home, was forced to answer a petition in the High Court that his sureties for good behaviour should be forfeit because of his attendance at the British convention of radicals. In the counter-petition, Johnston claimed to have lost a considerable sum through his involvement with the <span class="italic">Gazetteer</span>. He also claimed that his health and family had suffered considerably through his imprisonment. He also declared that the paper had already been proving profitable when he gave it up, and showed every sign of becoming more so. This may have been special pleading to gain favour from the court. What is certain is that under Scott's management&#151;and facing harassment of potential advertisers and readers&#151;the paper lurched from one financial difficulty to the next. In July the price of the paper was raised to 4<i>d</i>. from the original 3&frac12;<i>d</i>. At some time in October or November Scott wrote to Maurice Margarot explaining that only a loan would enable him to continue publication of the paper. Scott also claimed to be publishing between 1000 and 2000 copies per edition, a relatively modest total for the period. There is also a hint in another letter from Scott to Margarot from around the same time that Johnston had continued to provide the paper with financial support  (NA Scot., JC 26/270). The only help the British convention provided was to recommend that radical societies do all in their power to raise money and send it to the editor, or at least to remit payment for the paper in advance.<br>
<br>The action to have Johnston's sureties for good behaviour declared forfeit was dropped. Scott and the <span class="italic">Gazetteer</span> were not so lucky. Scott was charged with seditious libel for reports on the British convention carried in the <span class="italic">Gazetteer</span> for 26 November and 3 and 10 December 1793, and for a paragraph entitled &#145;An extraordinary instance of public spirit in the cobler of Messina&#146;, which could be read as encouraging the assassination of the &#145;oppressors&#146; of the country  (NA Scot., JC 26/281). Scott was outlawed for non-appearance. He fled to London where he was arrested but subsequently released on agreeing to act as a government spy. Johnston nursed a strong sense of injury about his prosecution for contempt of court in 1793 over many years. In 1817 he presented a memorial to the first division of the court of session in which he declared again his innocence. Details of the date or place of his death are unknown.<br>
