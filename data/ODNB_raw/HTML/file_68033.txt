<span class="headword">Barlowe,  Jerome</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1528&#150;1529), <span class="occ">Franciscan friar and writer</span>, is an obscure figure. The one incontrovertible record of Barlowe is that he was sighted on the road north from Attleborough to Bishop's Lynn in June 1529. Cardinal Wolsey's agents exacted this information as they made enquiries in East Anglia for Barlowe and his companion William Roy. Having lost the trail in Yarmouth, they met a man from Lincolnshire at Langley Abbey who claimed to have spotted the fugitives. Roy hid his face and went off the road; Barlowe, &#145;who had a red head&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 4/3, 5667), was more forward and asked the way to Lynn. Afterwards, Roy and Barlowe were reported to have caught a ship in Lynn for Newcastle, where, the agents told Wolsey, they intended to continue the pursuit.<br>
<br>Roy and Barlowe were the prime suspects for the production of <span class="italic">Rede me and be Nott Wrothe</span>, a truculent satire against Wolsey, written in octosyllabics interspersed with rhyme royals, and published anonymously, without printer's mark, in Strasbourg in 1528. The printer, Johann Schott (active 1500&#150;44) published nothing in English except this and another work by Roy in the same year. Questioned on oath by Wolsey's representative Hermann Rinck, Schott confessed to printing 1000 copies each of the two English books, but said he had received no payment from Roy and Barlowe. Wolsey's men searched for the collaborators in various centres of book production, Strasbourg itself, Frankfurt, Antwerp, and lastly Cologne, where Roy and Barlowe were expecting (it was said) to collect the money. The attribution of <span class="italic">Rede me and be Nott Wrothe</span> was repeated by Thomas More in 1530 and has largely been taken as read since.<br>
<br>Tyndale in the <span class="italic">Parable of the Wicked Mammon</span> (1528) provides the fullest surviving account of Barlowe. He identifies him, like Roy, as a lapsed observant friar of the Franciscan convent at Greenwich. Barlowe (Tyndale says) had arrived in Strasbourg from Worms in 1527, professing his new baptism and promising to give up the friar's life of idleness. According to Tyndale, Roy &#145;gate [Barlowe] to him and sett him a werke to make rimes&#146;  (Tyndale, sig. A3<i>r</i>). It is possible, therefore, on Tyndale's evidence, to see Barlowe as the proper author and poet of <span class="italic">Rede me</span>.<br>
<br>The tract, written as a dialogue, contains topical references to the murder of Richard Hunne and the burning of Tyndale's <span class="roman">New Testament</span> by the bishop of London. Much of the dialogue is given over to a scurrilous anti-clerical attack on Wolsey, but what made it scandalous to More was the reference to the mass as dead and buried.<br>
<br>Jerome Barlowe has sometimes been confused (including in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>) with William Barlow. It is conceivable that it was Jerome and not William who wrote an anti-protestant work called the <span class="italic">Lutheran Factions</span>, and recanted to Henry VIII in 1533. It is also conceivable that William, not Jerome, participated in the production of <span class="italic">Rede me</span>, since the recantation refers to &#145;the Treatyse of the Buryall of the Masse&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Cleo E IV, fol. 121). Scholarship is divided on these questions.<br>
