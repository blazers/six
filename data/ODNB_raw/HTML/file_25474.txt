<span class="headword">Shrubsole,  William</span>  (1729&#150;1797), <span class="occ">Independent minister and mastmaker</span>, was born at Sandwich, Kent, on 7 April 1729 and baptized at St Clement's, Sandwich, on 18 April, the son of Edward Shrubsole and Mary Chapman, who had married on 1 July 1726. In February 1743 he was apprenticed to George Cook, a shipwright at Sheerness, whose daughter Margaret (<i>d</i>. in or after 1796) he married in 1757. He was converted to a religious and godly life by reading a work of Isaac Ambrose, and in 1752 he was asked to lead the small Independent congregation at Sheerness on Sunday afternoons. In 1763 the congregation erected a meeting-house, and Shrubsole frequently acted as their minister. About 1767 he began regular public preaching in Sheerness and other towns in Kent. In 1773 he was appointed master-mastmaker at Woolwich but later in the year he was promoted at Sheerness. There, in 1784, a new chapel was built for him, which was enlarged in 1787. In 1793 he had a paralytic stroke and a co-pastor was appointed.<br>
<br>Shrubsole's most popular work was <span class="italic">Christian Memoirs</span> (1776), an allegorical work in the style of Bunyan, featuring representations of John Wesley and George Whitefield; the countess of Huntingdon was among the subscribers. The book was written, as Shrubsole explains, to divert his mind after being bitten by a mad dog in 1773. A second edition (1790) contained an elegy written in 1771 on the death of Whitefield; a third edition (1807) was edited by his son, with a life of the author. Shrubsole also published a pamphlet arguing for increased pay for shipwrights (1770) and wrote on infant baptism (1794). With Samuel Denne he was the author of <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of Rochester</span> (1772). He died at Sheerness on 7 February 1797 and was survived by his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_25476"></a><span class="headword">William Shrubsole</span>  (1759&#150;1829), <span class="occ">bank clerk and hymn writer</span>, who was born at Sheerness on 21 November 1759. He became a shipwright in Sheerness Dockyard and later an officer's clerk. In 1785 he went to London as a clerk in the Bank of England, and eventually he was appointed secretary to the committee of Treasury. He was one of the first secretaries of the London Missionary Society and contributed to the Religious Tract Society [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42118', "Founders of the London Missionary Society")</script>]. He published hymns in various religious publications from 1775 to 1813. His best-known hymn, &#145;Arm of the Lord! awake, awake&#146; (1795), is attributed in some works to his father. His hymn &#145;Bright as the sun's meridian blaze&#146; was written in 1795 for the London Missionary Society. Shrubsole, who had a daughter, Mrs Cunliffe, died at Highbury on 23 August 1829 and was buried in Bunhill Fields. He was not connected with William Shrubsole (<i>bap</i>. 1760, <i>d</i>. 1806), the composer and organist.<br>
