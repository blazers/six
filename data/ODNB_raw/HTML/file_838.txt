<span class="headword">Aitken <span class="st"> [Atkine]</span>,  James</span>  (1612/13&#150;1687), <span class="occ">bishop of Galloway</span>, was born in Kirkwall, Orkney, the third son of Henry Aitken, commissary and sheriff of Orkney and Shetland, and Elizabeth Buchanan. He attended Kirkwall grammar school before moving on to the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated MA on 23 July 1636. During the next two turbulent years of the covenanting revolution he completed his formal education at Oxford, where he studied divinity under John Prideaux of Exeter College. He returned to Scotland as chaplain to James, marquess of Hamilton, who was high commissioner to the Glasgow assembly of 1638 that abolished episcopacy and the royal supremacy in the Church of Scotland. Aitken was presented to the charge of Harray and Birsay, Orkney, on 27 July 1641 and officially admitted on 26 June 1642. He married Alison, daughter of Thomas Rutherford of Hunthill; they had four daughters.<br>
<br>Alerted to an order for his deposition and apprehension by his kinsman Sir Archibald Primrose, the clerk of council and later lord register, for his pledge of loyalty to the crown and support for the ill-fated royalist military campaign led by the marquess of Montrose in 1650, Aitken sought refuge in the Netherlands between 1650 and 1653. He returned to Scotland during the relative calm of the Cromwellian interregnum and lived in Edinburgh between 1653 and 1660. After the Restoration his fidelity to the royalist cause was rewarded, on 15 May 1661, by a grant of &pound;100. After accompanying Thomas Sydserf, the bishop of Orkney, to the court of Charles II in 1661 he was presented to the rectory of Winfrith, Dorset, by the bishop of Winchester. According to Anthony Wood he remained there for the next sixteen years.<br>
<br>On 1 November 1676 Aitken was appointed bishop of Moray. A letter patent to that effect was issued on 5 June 1677; episcopal consecration, however, was delayed until 28 October 1679. This did not prevent him from playing a conspicuous role in the convention of estates that met in Edinburgh in June 1678. He was translated to the see of Galloway on 6 February 1680 but received a dispensation permitting him to live in Edinburgh &#145;because it was thought unreasonable to oblige a reverend prelate of his years to live among such a rebellious and turbulent people&#146;  (Keith, 282). He took a prominent part in the parliaments that met in the capital in July 1681, April 1685, and April 1686, where he vociferously opposed repeal of the penal laws against Roman Catholics. Aitken died of apoplexy in Edinburgh on 15 November 1687 aged seventy-four, and was interred in Greyfriars Church; his funeral sermon was preached by Bishop John Hamilton of Dunkeld.<br>
