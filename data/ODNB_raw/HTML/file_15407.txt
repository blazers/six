<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kennicott,  Benjamin</span>  (1718&#150;1783), <span class="occ">biblical scholar</span>, was born at Totnes, Devon, on 4 April 1718 and baptized there on 20 April, the son of Benjamin Kennicott (<i>bap</i>. 1688, <i>d</i>. 1770), barber and parish clerk of Totnes, and his wife, Elizabeth Sage (<i>d</i>. 1749/50). He was educated at the town's grammar school for seven years, as a foundation boy. Apart from his books Kennicott as a youth was passionate about bellringing; he drew up regulations for the practice of the Totnes ringers in 1742 and gave a brass eight-light candlestick for the use of the ringers in the belfry. His first appointment was that of master of the blue coat, or charity, school of Totnes, where he attracted notice by some short poems, particularly &#145;On the Recovery of the Hon. Mrs. Eliz. Courtenay from her Late Dangerous Illness&#146;, printed in 1743 and 1747.<h2>
<a name="Academicandclericalcareer"></a>Academic and clerical career</h2>Subscriptions were opened to finance Kennicott's studies at Oxford, and mainly through the Courtenays of Powderham, Ralph Allen of Bath, and the Revd William Daddo, master of Blundells's School at Tiverton, he matriculated as a servitor from Wadham College, Oxford, on 6 March 1744. His undergraduate notes display a precocious familiarity with a comparative approach to scripture. He was Pigott exhibitioner in 1744 and 1745, Hody (Hebrew) exhibitioner from 1745 to 1747, and <span class="roman">Bible</span> clerk from 3 May 1746. In order to be eligible for a fellowship at Exeter College, as he had not resided long enough to qualify in the usual way, he was made (in accordance with the recommendation of the earl of Arran, chancellor of the university) BA, by decree, without examination, on 20 June 1747 and was duly elected to a fellowship, which he held until 1771. His subsequent degrees were MA (4 May 1750), BD (6 December 1761), and DD (10 December 1761); he was elected FRS in 1764. In politics he was loyal to the Pelhamite whigs and benefited from their patronage.<br>
<br>Having taken holy orders Kennicott was Whitehall preacher in 1753, vicar of Culham, Oxfordshire, from 21 September 1753 to 1783, chaplain to Bishop Robert Lowth of Oxford, in 1766, and Radcliffe librarian at Oxford from 27 November 1767 until his death. He initially discharged his librarian's duties conscientiously and helped to remedy the library's state of disrepair; he persuaded the trustees to acquire an illuminated Iberian <span class="roman">Bible</span> of 1476, subsequently known as &#145;Kennicott's <span class="roman">Bible</span>&#146; and one of the Bodleian Library's greatest treasures. In July 1770 he was appointed to a canonry at Westminster Abbey but soon resigned it for the fourth stall at Christ Church, Oxford (installed 1 November 1770). On 3 January 1771 Kennicott married Ann (<i>d</i>. 1831), sister of Edward Chamberlayne (<i>d</i>. 1781), later secretary of the Treasury, and sister-in-law of William Hayward Roberts, provost of Eton College. From 1771 to 1781 Kennicott held the vicarage of Menheniot, Cornwall, which was given to him as a fellow of Exeter College by the dean and chapter of Exeter on the recommendation of Bishop Lowth. He conscientiously resigned this preferment in 1781 because of his inability to reside in the parish. He was also a member of the Royal Society of Science at G&ouml;ttingen, the Theodore-Palatine academy at Mannheim, and the Royal Academy of Inscriptions at Paris.<h2>
<a name="Hebrewscholar"></a>Hebrew scholar</h2>Kennicott was instructed in Hebrew by Professor Thomas Hunt, and the greater part of his life was spent in the collation of Hebrew manuscripts with the object of producing a definitive original text of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>. Robert Lowth, always his major patron, first inspired him with a desire to test the accuracy of the Hebrew text of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>. With his formidable knowledge of Syriac, early Latin, the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span>, and the Samaritan <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span> it was recognized that he was very well qualified for the task. His critical examination of manuscripts, initially in the British Museum and the libraries of Oxford and Cambridge, began in 1751, and when Thomas Secker, then bishop of Oxford (and also a member of Exeter College), urged him in March 1758 to undertake their collation he agreed to the request. In return Secker, when archbishop of Canterbury, gave Kennicott his unstinting support and friendship when for a time he nurtured a project for producing a revised Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Meanwhile in 1753 Kennicott issued <span class="italic">The State of the Printed Hebrew Text of the Old Testament Considered: a Dissertation</span>, and in 1759 he brought out a second dissertation on the same subject. He identified his object thus:<blockquote>to compare Scripture with itself, to explain a difficult phrase or passage by a clear one, that bears some relation to it, to consider the natural force of the Original Words, the tendency of the Context, and the Design of the Writer; to compare the most ancient editions of the Original, with one another, and with the best copies of the most celebrated versions. (vol. 1, p. 12)</blockquote>These volumes were translated into Latin by W. A. Teller and published at Leipzig, the first in 1756, the second with additions in 1765.<br>
<br>Kennicott's scholarly endeavours attracted support in Britain and beyond. In England subscriptions amounted to &pound;9119 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.; in France the duc de Nivernois (a former French ambassador to the court of St James) patronized him and helped him to gain access to Parisian manuscript collections in 1767; the king of Denmark offered him the use of six ancient manuscripts; four quarto volumes of variant readings were sent to him on the king of Sardinia's orders; and the stadholder of the Netherlands made an annual donation of 30 guineas. His first report, <span class="italic">On the Collation of the Hebrew Manuscripts of the Old Testament</span>, was forwarded to the subscribers in December 1760 and a similar statement appeared each year until 1769. This annual summary afforded him an opportunity to defend the accuracy of his own collations, the Hebraic scholarship of the staff assisting him, and to print lists of subscribers.<br>
<br>Kennicott's labours culminated in the production of his <span class="italic">Vetus Testamentum Hebraicum cum variis lectionibus</span>, the first volume published at Oxford in 1776, the second in 1780. These were two superb folios complete with parallel Samaritan and Hebrew texts and <i>apparatus criticus</i>. To the second volume was annexed <span class="italic">Dissertatio generalis</span>, on the manuscripts of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, which was published separately at Oxford in the same year and reprinted at Brunswick in 1783 by Paul Jacob Bruns, a native of L&uuml;beck, who had been employed by Kennicott in collating manuscripts on the continent. A copy of the entire work was personally presented by Kennicott to George III. Lowth called the 1776 variorum <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> &#145;a work the greatest and most important that has been undertaken and accomplished since the Revolution of Letters&#146;  (Hepworth, 145).<h2>
<a name="ReceptionofVetusTestamentumHebraicumcumvariislectionibus"></a>Reception of Vetus Testamentum Hebraicum cum variis lectionibus</h2>Kennicott's second volume, of 1780, concluded that &#145;none of the variants was a threat to essential doctrine or increase[d] historical knowledge&#146;, but none the less his biblical scholarship provoked appreciable controversy. Though he took pains to deny it, his work seemed like a dire threat to the familiar Authorized Version. The first exchanges followed on from publication in 1753 of <span class="italic">The State of the Printed Hebrew Text</span>. Fowler Comings at once replied with <span class="italic">The printed Hebrew text of the Old Testament vindicated: an answer to Mr Kennicott's dissertation</span> (1753) and Julius Bate issued <span class="italic">The integrity of the Hebrew text and many passages of scripture vindicated from the objections and misconstructions of Mr Kennicott</span> (1754). Bate's involvement as a leading Hutchinsonian was indicative of that grouping's concern that the work undertaken by Kennicott (&#145;the English Ezra&#146;, as he called him) was destabilizing a time-honoured text with the unintended consequence of fostering unbelief. Kennicott responded anonymously with the pamphlet <span class="italic">A word to the Hutchinsonians, or, Remarks on three extraordinary sermons lately preached before the University of Oxford</span> (1756), which disparaged contemporary Hutchinsonian politics and refused to take their scholarly endeavours seriously. This work in turn prompted a defence and counter-attack by George Horne, then a don at University College. Thomas Rutherforth, regius professor of divinity at Cambridge, was also drawn in, producing a pamphlet on the second <span class="italic">Dissertation</span> (1761), in which he backed a recommendation that senate in Cambridge should support Kennicott's work, yet refrained from retracting earlier claims that the project was &#145;in many instances injudicious and inaccurate&#146;.<br>
<br>Controversies were also generated on the other side of the channel. In 1771 there appeared <span class="italic">Lettres de M. l'Abb&eacute; de &#151; ex-professeur en H&eacute;breu &hellip; au Sr Kennicott</span>, purporting to have been printed at Rome and sold in Paris, and an English translation was produced by William Stevens in 1772. It treated Kennicott and his project with learned disdain and made a particular charge that he had much underestimated the Jewish role in preserving and transmitting the text. It lambasted the imaginary corrections, describing them as &#145;follies, ignorant productions, omissions &hellip; which only deserve contempt and derision&#146;  (p. 147). In reply there appeared (possibly by Kennicott himself) <span class="italic">A letter to a friend occasioned by a French pamphlet lately published against Doctor Kennicott etc.</span> (1772), stating that the <span class="italic">Lettres de M. l'Abb&eacute; de &#151;</span> were the composition of Capuchins in the convent of St Honor&eacute;, Paris. It is more likely to have been written by Ignatius Adophus Dumay, Jewish by birth, who had been for four years chief collator to Kennicott and who also produced a powerful manuscript critique of his former employer's project, particularly the quality of the assistance that he had received. Bruns published at Rome in 1782 a Latin version of <span class="italic">A letter to a friend</span> and added some correspondence of his own. In Italy there appeared a censure upon Kennicott's letters in <span class="italic">Des titres primitifs de la revelation par Gabr. Fabricy, Romae</span> (2 vols., 1772). Kennicott remained largely aloof from these assaults. Sure of his patrons and his enterprise, he clearly did not feel either would be adversely affected by silence on his part, and he relied on replies by followers and admirers.<br>
<br>Many of Kennicott's chief opponents were Germans, notably J. D. Michaelis, whose <span class="italic">Bibliotheca orientalis</span> (pt 11) contained a severe criticism of his first volume on the grounds that he too easily disregarded vowel points and accents and had an unfortunate predilection for facilitating readings. Kennicott sent out a long Latin epistle to Michaelis (Oxford, 1777; reprinted Leipzig, 1777) inserted into the twelfth part of the <span class="italic">Bibliotheca orientalis</span>. After publication of his second volume Kennicott drew up a brief defence in Latin, <span class="italic">Contra ephemeridum Goettigensium criminationes</span> (1782). The four volumes of J. B. de Rossi's <span class="italic">Variae lectiones veteris testamenti</span>, published at Parma in 1784&#150;8, with a supplement of 1798, form a supplement to Kennicott's volumes of 1776 and 1780, and include codices which the latter had missed.<h2>
<a name="Reputationandfinalyears"></a>Reputation and final years</h2>The scale of textual criticism (he had consulted and collated 615 manuscript versions and 52 printed editions) gave Kennicott a European reputation that transcended national and denominational boundaries, his labours constituting a milestone &#145;in a more systematic and comprehensive examination of the formation of the biblical text and canon by subsequent scholars&#146;  (Ruderman, 23). His pertinacity offset an unpropitious start in life, and through careful organization and working to schedule he completed his great undertaking in his lifetime. But with indomitability went an arrogant streak that repeatedly generated hostility to his scholarship and ambition. He always found it hard to take his detractors and their charges seriously and he relied principally on powerful allies like Secker and Lowth to protect as well as patronize him.<br>
<br>Many of Kennicott's other published works were in response to critical attacks occasioned by his preaching and, in due time, his academic renown. Early in his career he fell foul of William King, the Oxford Jacobite, and caustically defended Exeter College for its pro-whig line in the notorious Oxfordshire election of 1754 in <span class="italic">A letter to Dr. King, occasion'd by his late Apology, and in particular by such parts of it as are meant to defame Mr Kennicott</span> (1755). Kennicott gave ammunition to his detractors with his <span class="italic">Christian fortitude: a sermon preached before the University at St. Mary's, Oxford, 25 Jan. 1757</span> (1757), to which there were several fierce replies. He also wrote anonymously <span class="italic">Remarks on the 42 and 43 Psalms</span> (n.d., 1765?), which was soon followed by a similar treatise on psalms 48 and 89. These, when translated into Latin with an appendix by Bruns, were published by J. C. F. Schultz at Leipzig in 1772. Another anonymous tract was <span class="italic">Critica sacra, or, A Short Introduction to Hebrew Criticism</span> (1774). <span class="italic">Remarks on Select Passages in the Old Testament. With Eight Sermons</span> (1787) was published following directions in Kennicott's will.<br>
<br>Kennicott suffered badly from gout towards the end of his life and was walking on two sticks by 1781. After a lingering illness he died at Oxford on 18 August 1783, and was buried in Christ Church Cathedral, close to the grave of Bishop Berkeley, on 21 August. Ann Kennicott long survived her husband, and died on 25 February 1831. She was very friendly with Richard Owen Cambridge, Mrs Garrick, Hannah More, and Fanny Burney, and after marriage had learned Hebrew, in order to assist her husband in his edition of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>: &#145;She was to him hands and feet, and eyes and ears, and intellect&#146;  (H. Roberts, 1.291). During her widowhood she had a warm friendship with Bishop Shute Barrington and there was even talk of their marrying after his wife died. She was also on intimate terms with Bishop Beilby Porteus and his wife and she frequently stayed with them at Fulham and in Kent. She moved closer to the evangelical camp in the early nineteenth century and was a strong supporter of the abolition of the slave trade and of the Windsor branch of the Bible Society. In memory of her husband and for the promotion of the study of Hebrew she founded two scholarships at Oxford, and her name is included in the bidding prayer among the benefactors of the university.<br>
