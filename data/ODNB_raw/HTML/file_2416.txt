<span class="headword">Bingham,  Richard, the younger</span>  (1798&#150;1872), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2415/', "Richard Bingham, the elder (1765&#150;1858)")</script>, and his wife, Lydia Mary Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Douglas. He was educated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1821 and MA in 1827. He was ordained deacon in 1821, and priest in 1822, and became curate to his father in his incumbency of Holy Trinity Church, Gosport. Here he remained for over twenty-two years. He married, on 4 May 1824, Frances Campbell, daughter of J. Barton, of Mount Pleasant, Jamaica, and took pupils.<br>
<br>Bingham published by subscription two small volumes of sermons in 1826 and 1827, and in 1829 <span class="italic">The warning voice, or, An awakening question for all British protestants in general, and members of the Church of England in particular, at the present juncture</span>. He seceded from the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1831, on account of its readiness to co-operate with Socinians, and soon after published an account of the circumstances. He issued by subscription a volume entitled <span class="italic">Sermons</span> (1835), and in 1843 <span class="italic">Immanuel, or, God with Us</span>. Twelve years later he produced the standard edition of his ancestor, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2410/', "Joseph Bingham")</script>, <span class="italic">The Works of the Rev. Joseph Bingham, MA</span> (10 vols., 1855).<br>
<br>In 1844 Bingham was presented by the trustees to the perpetual curacy of Christ Church, Harwood, Bolton-le-Moors; during his incumbency he lost (28 February 1847) his eldest daughter, Frances Lydia, aged twenty-one, and his youngest son. Frances Bingham had published <span class="italic">Hubert, or, The Orphans of St Madelaine; a Legend of the Persecuted Vaudois</span> (1845), and at the time of her death left remnants which were published by her father in 1848 as <span class="italic">Short Poems, Religious and Sentimental</span> and passed through two editions. Bingham became in 1853 curate at St Mary's, Marylebone, the rector of which was John Hampden Gurney, to whom he afterwards dedicated <span class="italic">Sermons</span> (1858). In 1856 he became vicar of Queenborough in the Isle of Sheppey. In 1870 he retired from this living to reside at Sutton, Surrey, where he died on Monday 22 January 1872.<br>
<br>Bingham was an energetic advocate of liturgical revision, and a member of the council of the Prayer Book Revision Society. In 1860 he published <span class="italic">Liturgia recusa, or, Suggestions for revising and reconstructing the daily and occasional services of the United Church of England and Ireland</span>. He supplemented this volume by an elaborate model of a liturgy, <span class="italic">Liturgi&aelig; recus&aelig; exemplar: the prayer book as it might be</span> (1863), with a dedication to Lord Ebury, which reflected Bingham's evangelical inclinations. Bingham also published <span class="italic">The Gospel According to Isaiah</span> (1870) and <span class="italic">Hymnologia Christiana Latina, or, A Century of Psalms and Hymns and Spiritual Songs</span> (1871).<br>
