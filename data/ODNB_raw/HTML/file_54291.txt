<span class="headword">Maxwell,  Herbert</span>, first Lord Maxwell  (<em>c.</em>1390&#150;1453), <span class="occ">courtier and landowner</span>, was the eldest son of Sir Herbert Maxwell of Caerlaverock and his wife, Katherine, daughter of John Stewart of Dalswinton. The younger Herbert succeeded his father in 1420 and was knighted at the coronation of James I in 1424. His main estate was Caerlaverock in Dumfriesshire, and he may have carried on significant building work on the castle there; he also owned lands in Roxburghshire, Haddingtonshire, Perthshire, Lanarkshire, and Renfrewshire (where in 1450 he had royal licence to build a castle at Mearns). The extent of his possessions made him one of the leading Scottish barons in the 1420s and 1430s, and about July 1445, along with several other similarly prominent nobles, he assumed a peerage title, as first Lord Maxwell. At this time he was an adherent of the Black Douglases, as indeed he had probably been throughout his formative years&#151;his father was steward of Annandale to the fourth earl of Douglas&#151;but when the tide turned against the Douglases after the killing of the eighth earl by James II in 1452, Maxwell appears to have been loyal to his monarch rather than to his patron. He died in late 1453, however, before the final manoeuvres by the crown against the Douglases. He is said to have married first a daughter of Sir Herbert Herries of Terregles; they had (probably) three sons and a daughter. He and his second wife, Katherine (<i>c</i>.1410&#150;1468&times;78), daughter of Sir William Seton and widow of Sir Alan Stewart of Darnley, had five sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>The eldest son of Maxwell's first marriage, <a name="cosubject_54290"></a><span class="headword">Robert Maxwell</span>  (<em>c.</em>1410&#150;1485)<span class="occ"></span>, succeeded his father as second Lord Maxwell in 1454. He made a bond of friendship to the Boyds which may have led him to support their removal of the young James III from Linlithgow to Edinburgh in July 1466. While they were pardoned, the action led to their fall in 1469; Maxwell may have escaped direct censure, although (like his father) he was seldom at court but occasionally attended parliament. He yielded the office of steward of Annandale, for which an annual fee was paid by the crown, in his eldest son's favour in 1455. About 1425, probably when a minor, he married Janet (<i>fl</i>. 1425&#150;1486), daughter of Sir John Forrester of Corstorphine (<i>d</i>. 1450), the chamberlain of James I. They had at least five sons and two daughters; two further sons are recorded. Maxwell died about April 1485. In 1478 he had resigned the barony of Maxwell in favour of his eldest son, John, whereafter John was sometimes styled Lord Maxwell, but he was killed in 1484. His marriage <i>c</i>.1454 to Janet, daughter of George Crichton, earl of Caithness (<i>d</i>. 1454), was of great potential importance because of the standing the Crichtons then enjoyed at court. The couple had seven sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>The eldest son, <a name="cosubject_54291"></a><span class="headword">John Maxwell</span>  (<em>c.</em>1455&#150;1513)<span class="occ"></span>, succeeded his father and grandfather, and is normally styled fourth Lord Maxwell. His family was engaged in some of the feuds which troubled public order during the later years of James III's reign. In 1479 a dispute in Nithsdale between &#145;the lord carlaverok&#146; and William Douglas of Drumlanrig was one of those singled out in parliament as needing to be settled. And the Maxwells had a bitter feud with another Dumfriesshire family, the Murrays of Cockpool. It was probably in 1486, a year after both sides had recorded assurances that they would not bring the other to harm, that the Murrays waylaid the fourth Lord Maxwell and his followers, killing his uncle and others. A concord was sealed on 4 September 1486, whereby the Murrays undertook to attend at Dumfries or Edinburgh market cross in linen clothes and seek Maxwell's forgiveness, and also to have masses sung for the souls of the slain. Nevertheless, the fourth lord's decision to join the rebels against James III in 1488 (apparently taken only shortly before the battle of Sauchieburn) may have been heavily influenced by the support the king was giving to Cuthbert Murray of Cockpool. Maxwell established himself at James IV's court thereafter, and performed occasional service as one of the king's council in judicial affairs throughout the reign. He was active in the property market and persuaded some lairds of south-west Scotland to give him bonds of manrent. Research has suggested that these bonds, which first appear in the 1440s, show lairds who had been recently raised to the peerage seeking to enhance their status over minor lairds by securing written personal promises of loyalty, often for life, in return for maintenance of the subscribers' interests. Maxwell and his sons also persuaded some local religious houses to appoint them as bailies of their property. He was killed at the battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513, along with three of his brothers. About 1491 he married Agnes (<i>fl</i>. 1491&#150;1530), daughter of Sir Alexander Stewart of Garlies. They had four sons, the eldest of whom, Robert, succeeded as fifth Lord Maxwell, and four daughters; Maxwell may have fathered two illegitimate sons.<br>
