<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Taylor,  Desmond Christopher  Shawe-</span>  (1907&#150;1995), <span class="occ">music critic</span>, was born at 92 Lower Leeson Street, Dublin, on 29 May 1907, the elder of the two sons of Francis Manley (Frank) Shawe-Taylor (1869&#150;1920), of Castle Lambert, co. Galway, magistrate and high sheriff for co. Galway, and his wife, Agnes Mary Eleanor (1874&#150;1939), eldest of the three daughters of Christopher Ussher, of Eastwell, co. Galway. He was a great-nephew of (Isabella) Augusta, Lady Galway, playwright and literary patron, and a cousin of the art collector Sir Hugh Lane. A happy childhood was violently interrupted by his father's murder at the hands of the IRA, and he was taken to England and sent to Shrewsbury School. He went up to Oriel College, Oxford, where he graduated with a first in English in 1930, and then spent some time in Germany and Austria before beginning in 1933 to contribute musical, literary, and (as Peter Galway) film reviews to various London journals, including the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>. During the war he served in the Royal Artillery, and on demobilization in 1945 he returned to the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> as music critic, with a distinguished group of writers who included his old friend <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35901/', "Edward Sackville-West")</script>. Together and with another friend, the painter (Edward) Eardley Knollys, they bought a Queen Anne rectory at Long Crichel, near Wimborne in Dorset, where they were later joined by Raymond Mortimer. There Shawe-Taylor wrote a slim but perceptive history, <span class="italic">Covent Garden</span> (1948).<br>
<br>Long Crichel became a house of warmth and delight, dispensing hospitality, music, and enlivening conversation to a stream of visitors chiefly from the literary and musical worlds. It was also the base for <span class="italic">The Record Guide</span> (1951, with revisions and supplements), an anthology by Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor recommending preferred recordings, but valuable long after its immediate purpose for the comments on composers and their works. David Cairns, later his colleague on the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, was responding to something avian in Shawe-Taylor when he described the book's &#145;great bird's eye survey which combined the sweeping vision of an eagle with a kingfisher's brilliance and the darting sensibility of a humming-bird&#146;  (Cairns, address at memorial service).<br>
<br>The record collection begun by Shawe-Taylor as a boy was constantly expanded over the years into the CD era, and was a resource for his enduring devotion to the human voice. He became the most perceptive critic of singing among his colleagues, delighting in voices from an age preserved on his oldest records but quick to welcome new artists, and was also a friend to singers including Emma Eames, Lotte Lehmann, and, a Long Crichel guest, Elisabeth Schumann. His quarterly articles for <span class="italic">The Gramophone</span>, &#145;The gramophone and the voice&#146; (1951&#150;73), and seventeen occasional articles for <span class="italic">Opera</span>, &#145;A gallery of great singers&#146; (1955&#150;88), deeply pondered and carefully constructed, were among those journals' most distinguished contributions.<br>
<br>In 1958 Shawe-Taylor succeeded Ernest Newman as chief music critic of the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>. Though he had anxieties about taking over from so distinguished and long-established a predecessor, readers kindled to his enthusiasm, his lightly worn learning, his quick response to music of many kinds, and his truthfulness to his own reactions, all expressed in elegant, engaging prose. He took immense trouble with his articles, worrying away at niceties of style, sparing neither himself nor, by postcard, colleagues who he felt had sinned. Composers he championed included, at early stages of their careers, Britten and Tippett; in the 1950s he was also more responsible than any other critic for winning English recognition of Jan&aacute;&#269;ek as a great opera composer. He was appointed CBE in 1965.<br>
<br>Apart from a year's break writing for the <span class="italic">New Yorker</span> in 1973&#150;4, Shawe-Taylor remained at the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> until semi-retirement in 1983. He continued to write occasional articles, but spent more time at Long Crichel. The original quartet had by now long dispersed or died, but with the added presence of the ophthalmic surgeon Patrick Trevor-Roper the house maintained much of its original character. Domestically, Shawe-Taylor could be as exacting over details of life as he could over a misplaced comma, and sometimes as irritable, but his charm and the evident goodness of his nature set such matters near the surface where they belonged. He was rare in being as excellent a host as he was a guest, always quicker to take pleasure than umbrage. Frances Partridge, a frequent Crichel visitor and at one point nearly a member of the ensemble, wrote of his &#145;boundless high spirits, optimism, volatility, and interest in everything that comes his way&#146;  (<span class="italic">Everything to Lose: Diaries, 1945&#150;1960</span>, 1985, 99). Though an encroaching confusion of his short-term memory from about 1993 constrained his activities, he was still writing and preparing broadcasts at the time of his death, which took place peacefully at Long Crichel House on 1 November 1995 as a result of heart failure, after a country walk near Crichel. He was unmarried. A memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 26 March 1996, and he was buried at Long Crichel church.<br>
