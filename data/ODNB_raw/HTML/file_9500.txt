</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fisher,  John</span>  (1748&#150;1825), <span class="occ">bishop of Salisbury</span>, was born at Hampton, Middlesex, the eldest of the nine sons of the Revd John Fisher (1696&#150;1787) and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Laurens (<i>bap</i>. 1720), a Huguenot heiress. The elder Fisher was successively vicar of Hampton, Middlesex, of St John the Baptist, Peterborough (1748&#150;66), and of Preston, Dorset; he was also rector of Calbourne, Isle of Wight, from 1766 to his death, and prebendary of Preston in the cathedral of Salisbury from 1759 to 1779. He was made chaplain to Bishop John Thomas, the preceptor of George III, on his appointment to the see of Peterborough in 1747. The younger John was educated at the free school at Peterborough, and moved to St Paul's School, London, when aged fourteen. In 1766 he entered Peterhouse, Cambridge, on a Pauline exhibition, and was made scholar in 1767. The leading theologian (and one with Arian sympathies) Dr Edmund Law was at that time head of the college, and Fisher became the friend of his two distinguished sons, Edward, later Lord Chief Justice Ellenborough, and John, later bishop of Elphin.<br>
<br>In 1770 Fisher took his BA and was placed tenth wrangler; he was also respected for his skills as a classicist. In 1773 he proceeded MA and was appointed to a Northamptonshire fellowship at St John's College, Cambridge, where he acted as tutor and undertook his duties well enough to win approval from colleagues and students alike. He had meanwhile been ordained deacon on 26 May 1771 and priest, in the diocese of Winchester, on 1 May 1773. Fisher acted as curate of Hampton, his native parish, and was vicar of Preston with Sutton Poyntz, in Dorset, from 1773 to 1780, the year in which he was made BD.<br>
<br>On the recommendation of Bishop Richard Hurd, Fisher's patron, George III appointed him in 1780 preceptor to his son Prince Edward, later duke of Kent, and in 1781 he became a chaplain to the king and deputy clerk of the closet. He held this appointment until 1785, when his pupil went to continue his education in Germany, and he also gave Princess Elizabeth some instruction in drawing. Fisher thereupon travelled in Italy and Switzerland, sketching and sightseeing. In Italy he became known to Mrs Piozzi, who described him as &#145;a charming creature, generally known in society as &#147;the King's Fisher&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Literary Remains</span>, ed. A. Hayward, 1861, 2.367). In 1786 he was recalled from Naples upon his nomination by George III to a canonry at Windsor (installed 14 July), where he took up residence. During his seventeen years in the chapter he acted as treasurer and helped to oversee the restoration of the choir. His simplicity, courteous manners, and amenable temper made him a favourite with George III, whose esteem he also gained through his loyalty and unaffected piety; by 1804 he was acting as one of the deputy clerks of the closet.<br>
<br>Fisher married, on 6 September 1787, Dorothea (<i>bap</i>. 1761, <i>d</i>. 1831), only daughter of John Freeston Scrivener (<i>c</i>.1732&#150;1797) of Sibton Abbey, Suffolk, with whom he had one son and two daughters. The match increased Fisher's wealth by between &pound;1600 and &pound;1700 p.a., the estate eventually descending to his wife and then to their eldest son. In 1789 he took the degree of DD. Fisher gained further parochial preferment while a canon of Windsor. On 5 August 1790 he was instituted to the rectory of Langham, Essex (and instituted again on 20 April 1793 and on 10 August 1796, having received further parochial preferment and possibly having obtained a special dispensation from the archbishop of Canterbury so that the terms of the <span class="roman">Pluralities Act</span> were respected); this post was in the gift of the duchy of Lancaster. From 1793 to 1796 he held the vicarage of Nether Stowey, Somerset, and on 29 July 1796 he was instituted as rector of Hartley Wespall, Hampshire (a post he held until 1807); both livings were in the gift of the Windsor chapter. Fisher was chosen by the king as bishop of Exeter on the death of Bishop Henry Reginald Courtenay and was consecrated in Lambeth Chapel on 16 July 1803. He thereupon resigned his Windsor stall.<br>
<br>In March 1805 the king appointed Fisher to superintend the education of Princess Charlotte of Wales, rather against her father's preferences. It was a difficult undertaking, especially since the princess was not at first overfond of the bishop's company and there were problems with Lady de Clifford, the princess's governess, over female appointments in her household. Fisher tried to be patient, gentle, and firm, and gradually to train the princess to develop a sense of self-command. Quite early in his tutorship he was in contact with Hannah More, who had published anonymously <span class="italic">Hints towards Forming the Character of a Princess</span>. After an interview with the bishop, More wrote that he &#145;appeared to have a proper notion of managing his royal pupil, and of casting down all high imaginations&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life and Correspondence of Hannah More</span>, ed. W. Roberts, 2nd edn, 1834, 3.230). Fisher was less popular with others at court. Charlotte Knight wrote that his visits three or four times weekly were basically to arm the princess against Roman Catholicism and whiggery, &#145;two evils which he seemed to think equally great&#146;, insisting, against the general consensus, that the bishop's &#145;temper was hasty, and his vanity easily alarmed&#146;. She gave him credit only for his &#145;taste for drawing, and a love of the fine arts&#146;  (C. Knight, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1.232&#150;3). Fisher held the appointment to Princess Charlotte until 1817.<br>
<br>In 1804 Fisher accepted office as vice-president of the British and Foreign Bible Society; he also found time to hold a visitation of the Exeter diocese. Three years later, on the death of Bishop Douglas, he resigned all his other preferments on translation to Salisbury (enthroned 29 July 1807), where he won respect and affection for his administrative dedication and competence, and where he revived the office of rural dean in 1811. Fisher worked hard to ensure clergy either undertook residence personally or paid a curate above the bare legal minimum, telling George Augustus Herbert, eleventh earl of Pembroke, that &#145;In all cases of lay Patronage the joint efforts of the Patron &amp; the Bishop may do much&#146;  (19 Aug 1810, Wilts. &amp; Swindon HC, Pembroke MS 2057/F4/45). Fisher was dignified, unostentatious, and charitable, and lived on his private means; episcopal revenues were used for acts of benevolence and he left no more than &pound;20,000 on his death. In 1818 he visited the Channel Islands, under a commission from the ailing Brownlow North, bishop of Winchester. It was the first time since the Reformation, when the islands were placed under the jurisdiction of the Winchester diocese, that they had received an episcopal visitation. Fisher held confirmations and consecrated a church. He acted as chancellor of the Order of the Garter and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1819.<br>
<br>Fisher died at Seymour Street, London, on 8 May 1825, after a long illness patiently borne, and was buried in St George's Chapel, Windsor, on 16 May. He published nothing beyond his primary charges as bishop of Exeter, and some occasional sermons. In his charges of 1804 and 1805 he declared himself against intolerant treatment of Roman Catholics but he also refused to make them any legal concessions beyond bare toleration; such, in his view, was all that peaceable and conscientious dissenters from the Church of England had any claim to. He there also declared his opposition to repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span> and repudiated the alleged Calvinism of the Church of England, which, he argued, was flatly contradicted by the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>. Fisher was well liked for his &#145;gentlemanly, easy, and unassuming manners&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 10.3539, 13 Sept 1809) despite his high offices; these traits, coupled with a strong sense of duty and a facial likeness, made Mrs Fisher call the bishop &#145;her F&eacute;nelon&#146;. The couple were highly regarded, not least by Fanny Burney, who knew the bishop for nearly forty years and for whom he was &#145;my very aimiable &amp; constant friend&#146;  (to Esther Burney, 2&#150;7 Oct 1818, in <span class="italic">The Journals and Letters of Fanny Burney (Madame d'Arblay)</span>, vol. 11, 1984, 2); he ordained her son Alexander d'Arblay in 1818.<br>
<br>John Fisher was also a highly cultured prelate, a generous patron of both authors and artists, and a capable sketcher; he was chaplain to the Royal Academy in 1807 and helped to set up the British Institution the previous year. For the last twenty-five years of his life he was one of John Constable's leading patrons. The two men had first met at Langham about 1798; Constable became a regular visitor to the palace at Salisbury and familiar with the bishop's wider family, giving drawing lessons to Dorothea, his eldest daughter, and becoming the close friend of archdeacon John Fisher, the bishop's nephew and domestic chaplain. Fisher's widow died on 5 September 1831 and was survived by a son, Edward (who died unmarried in 1836), and two daughters.<br>
