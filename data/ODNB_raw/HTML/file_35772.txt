<span class="headword">Austen, Sir  William Chandler  Roberts-</span>  (1843&#150;1902), <span class="occ">metallurgist</span>, was born at Kennington, Surrey, on 3 March 1843, the eldest son of George Roberts, of Welsh descent, who worked for the Hudson's Bay Company, and his wife, Maria Louisa, daughter of William Chandler MD of Canterbury, of an old Kentish family which had intermarried with the Hulses and Austens. He assumed the name of Austen by royal licence in 1885 at the request of his uncle, Major Nathaniel Lawrence Austen of Haffenden and Camborne, in Kent.<br>
<br>After education at private schools, where he developed an interest in science, Roberts entered the Royal School of Mines in 1861, with the intention of becoming a mining engineer. He obtained the associateship in metallurgy in 1865, and then spent four years (1865&#150;9) as private assistant to Thomas Graham, master of the Royal Mint; his research interests and methods were strongly influenced by Graham. In 1870 he was appointed to the new post of chemist of the mint and became also the second resident assayer. In 1882 he was given responsibility for all the assay work at the mint, with the title of chemist and assayer. At the time of his death he was acting deputy master of the mint. As assayer he became a worldwide authority on all scientific and technical aspects of coinage; while Sir Charles Fremantle was deputy master (1868&#150;94), his influence extended beyond the assay department. From 1880 to 1902 he was also professor of metallurgy at the Royal School of Mines, having succeeded Dr John Percy. He was known as a kindly and stimulating teacher. In 1876 he married Florence Maude, youngest daughter of Richard William Alldridge, of Old Charlton, Kent; they had no children.<br>
<br>Roberts-Austen freely placed his special knowledge at the public disposal, taking part in numerous official scientific inquiries. In 1896 he was appointed to a Board of Trade committee which considered the wear of steel rails, and in the following year he served on the Treasury committee which created the National Physical Laboratory. In 1899 he became an original member of the War Office and Admiralty committee on explosives and ordnance.<br>
<br>Roberts-Austen's researches, conducted in his laboratory at the mint, dealt mainly with alloys. He delivered five series of Cantor lectures at the Society of Arts (1884&#150;90) on investigations in alloys, which were published in its <span class="italic">Journal</span>. In 1891 he exhibited at the Royal Society a new alloy of gold and aluminium which he had discovered; it was remarkable for its intense purple colour. As the outcome of research on the effects of admixture of impurities on the mechanical properties of pure metals, the alloys research committee of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers was established (1889), Roberts-Austen becoming &#145;reporter&#146; to the committee and supplying five reports (1891&#150;9); a sixth was under revision at his death. In the first he described his automatic recording pyrometer, which provided an exact record of temperature changes in furnaces or masses of metal, and proved useful in metallurgical works. The research on alloys that he initiated was continued at the National Physical Laboratory. The practical value of his work led the council of the institution to make him an honorary life member.<br>
<br>Roberts-Austen's principal publication was <span class="italic">An Introduction to Metallurgy</span> (1891; 6th edn, 1910), a work indispensable to researchers in metallurgy. He contributed the article &#145;Metallography&#146; to the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, tenth edition, and published nearly 100 articles and reports (1868&#150;1902), a few jointly with other authors. They deal mainly with the absorption of hydrogen by electrodeposited iron, the analysis of alloys by means of the spectroscope (with Sir Norman Lockyer), the action of projectiles and explosives on the tubes of steel guns, and the physical properties of metals and alloys.<br>
<br>Roberts-Austen, who was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 3 June 1875, served on the council (1890&#150;92), and was Bakerian lecturer for 1896, his subject being the diffusion of metals. A founder member of the Physical Society in 1874, he was its first secretary, and he acted also as honorary general secretary of the British Association in 1897&#150;1902. He was president of the Iron and Steel Institute (1899&#150;1901), was elected in 1901 an honorary member of the Institution of Civil Engineers (where he gave the Forrest lecture on 23 April 1902), was a vice-president of the Chemical Society (1895&#150;8) and of the Society of Arts (1900&#150;02), and member of various foreign societies. The University of Durham conferred the honorary degree of DCL in 1897, and Victoria University, Manchester, that of DSc in 1901. In 1889 he was created a chevalier of the French L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and he was made CB in 1890 and KCB in 1899.<br>
<br>At the Royal Institution, the British Association meetings, and at the Chemical and other societies, Roberts-Austen was highly regarded as a lecturer and demonstrator. His considerate and religious nature, keen sense of humour, and skills as a mimic, ventriloquist, and actor made him socially popular. He was a close friend of Ruskin, whose works influenced him greatly in early life. He died after several months of illness at the mint on 22 November 1902, and was buried at Canterbury five days later. He was survived by his wife.<br>
