<span class="headword">Denison <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Conyngham]</span>,  Albert</span>, first Baron Londesborough  (1805&#150;1860), <span class="occ">connoisseur of the arts and politician</span>, was born Albert Conyngham at 8 Stanhope Street, Piccadilly, London, on 21 October 1805, the third son of Henry Conyngham, first Marquess Conyngham (1766&#150;1832), and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45483/', "Elizabeth Conyngham (1769&#150;1861)")</script>, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49178/', "Joseph Denison")</script>, banker, of St Mary Axe, London; later rumours that he was a natural son of George IV appear to be unfounded. He was educated at Eton College and in 1820 was gazetted a half-pay cornet in the (disbanded) 22nd dragoons. He served in the Horse Guards in 1823&#150;4, but resigned and joined the diplomatic service as attach&eacute; at Berlin, May 1824, and at Vienna from May 1825, then was secretary of legation at Florence, February 1828, and secretary at Berlin, January 1829 to June 1831. He was created KCH (civil) in August 1829. He sat as the MP (Liberal) for Canterbury 1835&#150;1841 and 1847&#150;50, but on 4 March 1850 was created Baron Londesborough, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. On 4 September 1849 he had taken the sole name of Denison, in lieu of that of Conyngham, to comply with the will of his uncle the banker and MP <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7491/', "William Joseph Denison")</script>, whose enormous wealth he inherited. He acquired estates in Yorkshire at Selby (bought from the Hon. Mrs E. R. Petre), Londesborough near Market Weighton (bought from George Hudson MP), and Grimston Park, near Tadcaster (bought from Lord Howden), and he owned over 60,000 acres, producing an income of about &pound;100,000 per annum.<br>
<br>Londesborough was an enthusiastic antiquary, and was elected FSA on 26 March 1840 and FRS on 13 June 1850. He became first president of the British Archaeological Association in 1843 but resigned in 1849 and later became a vice-president of the Archaeological Institute and president of the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society in 1855. He served also as president of the Numismatic Society and was a vice-president of the British Association at its Hull meeting in 1853. He took an active role in tumular excavations, in Kent and the East Riding, for example those near Driffield, which he reported in the <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> in 1852; and he frequently displayed examples from his extensive collections to fellow enthusiasts at the antiquaries' meetings and at special receptions. His collections of armour, plate, and other objects (including John Dee's famous mirror, French furniture from the Petit Trianon, and also Landseer's <span class="italic">The Monarch of the Glen</span>) were of wide range and high quality. A quarto catalogue, <span class="italic">Miscellanea graphica</span>, compiled by F. W. Fairholt and introduced by Thomas Wright, was issued in 1857, and one (also by Fairholt) of his antique silver plate in 1860, after his death. His antiquities were dispersed mainly in four London sales in 1879, 1884, and 1888. In 1835, as Lord Albert Conyngham, he had published <span class="italic">The Natural Son</span>, a translation of Carl Spindler's <span class="italic">Der Bastard</span>, and in 1849 a journal of his travels in Greece and Italy, <span class="italic">Wanderings in Search of Health</span>.<br>
<br>Lord Londesborough, in the portrait by Sir Francis Grant, formerly at Blankney, is depicted as an imposing figure of 6 feet 4 or 5 inches, tall and thin and dark, and (in the words of his grandson Sir Osbert Sitwell) &#145;like a comb, all teeth and backbone&#146;  (Sitwell, 60). He is shown, in recognition of his antiquarian tastes, with his hand resting beside a great helm. He had the reputation of being highly strung, and did not wish to see his servants, who had to attend to his many houses invisibly. He married first, on 6 July 1833, Henrietta Maria (1809&#150;1841), fourth daughter of Cecil Weld-Forester, first Baron Forester, with whom he had two sons and four daughters; and second, on 21 December 1847, Ursula Lucy Grace (1823&#150;1883), eldest daughter of Vice-Admiral the Hon. Charles Orlando Bridgeman, with whom he had a further four sons and two daughters. Having latterly, for the benefit of his health, spent much time at his villa at Cannes, he wintered in 1859 at St Leonards, but returned to his London house, 4 Carlton House Terrace, where he died on 15 January 1860. He was buried on 24 January in Grimston, Yorkshire. He was succeeded by his eldest son, who became first earl of Londesborough in the jubilee creations of 1887.<br>
