<span class="headword">Knox,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1555&#150;1623), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was the son of William Knox; it is unclear whether this William was the merchant of Prestonpans in Haddingtonshire who was the brother of the reformer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15781/', "John Knox")</script>, or this William's eldest son, also William, minister of Cockpen, Edinburghshire, from 1567 to 1592. After graduating MA at the University of St Andrews in 1575, Knox was admitted to the ministry at Lauder, Berwickshire, in April 1576. When he refused to baptize the illegitimate child of one David Douglas, the latter assaulted and wounded him, prompting him to complain to the privy council, which in June 1590 declared Douglas an outlaw when he failed to appear.<br>
<br>Knox is first recorded as attending the general assembly of the Church of Scotland in October 1581; during his career he participated in at least twelve of these meetings. He left Lauder to become minister at Melrose, Roxburghshire, in 1584. Committed to presbyterian polity, he refused to subscribe the articles of religion issued by the king's secretary, John Maitland of Thirlstane, the following year. In October 1586 Knox was elected moderator of the synod of Merse and Teviotdale. On 6 March 1590 the privy council appointed him a commissioner for the preservation of protestantism and the examination of ministers in Roxburghshire, and two years later he was commissioned to send information about the activities of Roman Catholics and their supporters to the Edinburgh minister Walter Balcanquhall. In 1595 Knox persuaded the general assembly to permit William Knox the younger, who had succeeded his father at Cockpen three years earlier, to move to Selkirk, but William decided to stay where he was.<br>
<br>Knox was active in support of the Presbyterian church at a time when it was making far-reaching claims for its own authority, even at the expense of the crown. When the general assembly established a commission in 1596 to reside at Edinburgh and monitor the actions of the excommunicated Roman Catholic earls of Huntly and Erroll and their supporters, Knox was one of the representatives for southern Scotland. However, the privy council ruled the commission illegal on 24 November 1596, and ordered its members to leave Edinburgh. Knox was one of the commissioners appointed by the general assembly in March 1598 to prepare a report on ecclesiastical representation in parliament. Two years later the assembly named him to a commission to establish ministers in towns devoid of them, and also to deal with actions by ministers that offended James VI. As a member of the assembly in 1601, he voted against the king's proposed transfer of ministers. The following year the assembly made Knox a visitor for the examination of ministers in Annandale and Nithsdale. It appointed him to a commission to advise James about the church's enemies, and included his name on a list of men that the king could present to empty benefices. Although Knox was unwilling to serve as the assembly's moderator, he accepted an appointment as moderator of Melrose presbytery in January 1607. The following year he was one of twenty ministers (ten per side) selected by the assembly to seek a compromise between advocates of presbyterian and episcopal polities. He also served as a commissioner to accompany the archbishop of Glasgow on a visitation of churches in Dumfriesshire.<br>
<br>Knox participated in the Falkland Palace conference on 4 May 1609 that discussed differences of opinion on church government and discipline. He quarrelled with the archbishop of St Andrews over the king's five articles on worship at the general assembly in 1617. After the articles were approved by the general assembly at Perth the following year, despite the objections of Knox and others, he preached against them in a synod at Peebles, beseeching his listeners, &#145;with tears, to stand to the Libertie and Government of the Kirk Established before the erection of the late Bishops&#146;  (Calderwood, 717). Knox was married to Christian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Paterson. He died, probably at Melrose, in 1623, his wife surviving him.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_15783"></a><span class="headword">John Knox</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1654)<span class="occ"></span>, probably the son of the Melrose minister, graduated MA at St Andrews in 1613 or 1614. King James presented him to the living at Bowden, Roxburgh, on 22 November 1621. A member of the assembly in 1638, he served on the commission (the assembly's standing committee) in 1646 and 1648. He was married to Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Douglas, and was still minister at Bowden on 26 July 1654; it is not known when he died. Their sons, Henry, who attended Charles II in exile, and John, both became ministers, the latter at North Leith, until his ejection on 11 June 1662.<br>
