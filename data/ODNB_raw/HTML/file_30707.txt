<span class="headword">Bennett,  Edward Hallaran</span>  (1837&#150;1907), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, born on 9 April 1837 at Charlotte Quay, Cork, was the youngest of the five children, all sons, of Robert Bennett, recorder of Cork, and Jane Hallaran, the daughter of William Saunders Hallaran, a physician of Cork with an interest in mental disease who wrote on insanity. His grandfather James Bennett was a physician in Cork, and another kinsman, James Richard Bennett, was a distinguished teacher of anatomy in Paris in the 1820s. His brother Robert served all through the Crimean War and retired with the rank of major-general.<br>
<br>Bennett was educated at Hamblin's School in Cork, and then at the Academic Institute, Harcourt Street, Dublin, whose headmaster was the Revd Daniel Flynn. Bennett entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1854, and graduated in 1859 with the degrees of BA, MB, and the newly established MCh. He continued his surgical career in Dublin at the school of physic, Trinity College, and at Dr Steevens' Hospital, the Meath Hospital, the Richmond Hospital, and Sir Patrick Dunn's Hospital; in 1863 he became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. The following year he proceeded MD and was appointed university anatomist in Dublin University, a post that carried with it the office of surgeon to Sir Patrick Dunn's Hospital. On 20 December 1870 Bennett married Frances, the daughter of Conolly Norman of Fahan, co. Donegal, and a cousin of the alienist Conolly Norman; they had two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1873, on the death of Robert William Smith, Bennett was appointed professor of surgery in Trinity College and curator of the pathological museum. He held these posts, together with his appointment as surgeon to Sir Patrick Dunn's Hospital, until 1906. Bennett also held numerous appointments of distinction in Ireland; in 1880 he was president of the Dublin Pathological Society; from 1884 to 1885 he served as president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland; from 1897 to 1900 he was president of the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland; from 1897 to 1906 he represented the University of Dublin on the General Medical Council; and from 1902 to 1905 he was surgeon to the lord lieutenant, the earl of Dudley. In 1900 he was made an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in England (his photograph with signature is in the album of honorary fellows).<br>
<br>Bennett assembled a remarkable collection of fractures, dislocations, diseases, and surgery of bones in the Pathological Museum of Trinity College, Dublin. The collection was begun by his predecessor, R. W. Smith, and was developed by Bennett into one of the most important collections of its kind in Europe. He spent years in compiling a catalogue furnished with notes and clinical histories, but it remained unfinished. Bennett frequently published communications and reports dealing with the surgery and pathology of bones. In 1880 he described for the first time at the Cork meeting of the British Medical Association, and in 1881 at the Dublin Pathological Society, the fracture at the base of the metacarpal bone of the thumb which was previously unrecognized and which became universally known as &#145;Bennett's fracture&#146;. Its significance lies in the fact that, unless skilfully treated, it leads to arthritic changes at the base of the thumb with consequent pain and disability. As an operating surgeon, Bennett was one of the earliest in Ireland to adopt the antiseptic technique of Lister. As a teacher, he was forcible and practical, and able to enlighten the driest subject with touches of humour.<br>
<br>Bennett died on 21 June 1907 at his residence, 26 Lower Fitzwilliam Street, Dublin, and was buried at Mount Jerome cemetery in Dublin. He was survived by his wife and one daughter, Norah Mary.<br>
