<span class="headword">Howell,  Charles Augustus</span>  (1840?&#150;1890), <span class="occ">artists' agent and rogue</span>, was born on 10 March, probably in 1840, in Porto, Portugal, the youngest of the six children of Alfred William Howell, an English drawing master and wine merchant, and Dona Enriqueta Amelia de Souza De Rosa Coehlo. Through his mother's distinguished Portuguese family Howell claimed to have inherited the red ribbon of the order of Christ. Renowned during his lifetime principally as a prodigious liar and gifted raconteur, Howell's historical importance lies in his varied dealings with members of the Victorian art world, notably John Ruskin, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Charles Algernon Swinburne, and James McNeill Whistler. &#145;He had the gift of intimacy,&#146; Whistler said, observing that &#145;it was easier to get involved with Howell than to get rid of him&#146;  (Pennell and Pennell, <span class="italic">Whistler Journal</span>, 59).<br>
<br>Little is known about Howell's early years, though he seems to have assisted his father in the wine trade until, at the age of sixteen, he went to England to live with his uncle, who was vicar of Darlington. There he gained employment with the Stockton and Darlington Railway and made the acquaintance of the Italian revolutionary Felice Orsini (1819&#150;1858); because of some involvement&#151;probably innocent&#151;with the Orsini conspiracy, Howell was compelled to leave the country in 1858, returning only in 1865. The intervening years he spent, according to various reports, diving for treasure off the coast of Portugal, becoming a sheikh of an Arab tribe in Morocco, and serving as an attach&eacute; to the Portuguese embassy in Rome. Upon returning to England, Howell lived at 3 York Villas in Brixton with his aunt and his cousin Frances Kate (Kitty) Howell (<i>d</i>. 1888), whom he married on 21 August 1867; their daughter, Rosalind Blanche Catherine, was born on 20 March 1877.<br>
<br>By the end of 1865 Howell had become Ruskin's secretary, almoner, and confidant, producing skilful facsimiles of works of art, serving as intermediary in Ruskin's ill-fated liaison with Rose La Touche, and settling in Fulham to keep up the spirits of Edward Burne-Jones, Ruskin's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Howell's association with Ruskin ended in 1870, for reasons that remain obscure. Howell and Ruskin had met through Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who was for a time Howell's intimate friend. It was Howell who, in 1869, managed the exhumation of Rossetti's poems from the grave of his wife, Elizabeth Siddal: no one else, Rossetti said, &#145;could well have been entrusted with such a trying task&#146;  (Angeli, 139&#150;40). Also through Rossetti, Howell met Swinburne, who unwisely employed him to negotiate with his publisher John Camden Hotten, and met Whistler, who relied on him through a period of financial crisis to take on debts, manage his affairs, and help prepare his lawsuit against Ruskin, which went to court in 1878.<br>
<br>At Chaldon House, his exquisitely furnished residence at North End Road, Fulham, Howell established himself as an art expert and interior decorator. One of his clients, George Howard, later ninth earl of Carlisle, commended his &#145;wonderful skill in the discovery of pretty things&#146;  (Cline, 7). He also possessed keen business instincts, and as a dealer in fine arts helped foster the Victorian taste for Chinese porcelain and Japanese prints and elevated the value of contemporary art, especially works by Rossetti, Burne-Jones, Ford Madox Brown, Frederick Sandys, and G. F. Watts. According to William Michael Rossetti, Howell was &#145;rich in versatile resource and in attractive personal qualities&#146;  (Rossetti, 81). He appears in Theodore Watts-Dunton's <span class="italic">Aylwin</span> (1898) as De Castro, &#145;a professional anecdote-monger of extraordinary brilliancy, a raconteur of the very first order&#146;, with the bearing of a gentleman and a face revealing &#145;power and intelligence&#146;. Endowed with tremendous personal charm, Howell founded his dealings with artists in friendships that inevitably foundered through evidence of his dishonesty and double-dealing. Rossetti characterized him in a limerick as<blockquote>
<div>A Portuguese person called Howell,<br>
</div>
<div>Who lays on his lies with a trowel,<br>
</div>
</blockquote>and Graham Robertson observed that he attracted &#145;portable property&#146;&#151;pictures, furnishings, bric-a-brac&#151;as a magnet attracts steel  (Robertson, 187). Skilled in winning confidence and notoriously unprincipled, Howell is also suspected of having engaged in (or at least contemplated) blackmail, which may account for Georgiana Burne-Jones's chilling dismissal of her husband's former intimate as &#145;a stranger to all that our life meant&#146;  (Burne-Jones, 1.294).<br>
<br>In 1878 Howell was forced by the extension of the railway lines to leave Chaldon House and persuaded a court to award him substantial compensatory damages. He lived the rest of his life at 91 Southampton Row and at Old Danner, a house by the sea at Selsey Bill, Sussex, where he is said to have entertained the local children with stories and games and played the part of a distinguished personage. He had become involved in 1873 with the artist Rosa Corder (1853&#150;1893), with whom he is alleged to have supplied spurious Rossettis and other forgeries for the art market; their daughter, Beatrice Ellen Howell (whom Howell referred to in his will as his niece), was born about 1883. Howell's death was reported more than once&#151;&#145;It is believed by his own agency&#146;, according to G. C. Williamson, &#145;in order that he might hear what was to be said&#146;  (Williamson, 150), and also to afford an occasion for a sale, to which his former acquaintances flocked in fruitless hope of recovering their long-lost possessions. His actual demise was consequently met with disbelief: it took place on 24 April 1890, at Home Hospital, 16 Fitzroy Square, after a long illness, probably tuberculosis. A lurid story arose&#151;apparently without foundation, but befitting Howell's predilection for mendacity&#151;that he was discovered in a gutter outside a Chelsea pub with his throat cut and a ten-shilling piece clenched between his teeth. He was buried in the Brompton cemetery.<br>
