<span class="headword">Stanhope, Sir  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1546&#150;1608), <span class="occ">civil lawyer</span>, was the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26251/', "Sir Michael Stanhope (b. before 1508, d. 1552)")</script>, courtier and administrator, and Anne (<i>c</i>.1515&#150;1588), daughter of Nicholas Rawson of Aveley, Essex. He was born in Kingston upon Hull, Yorkshire, of which his father was lieutenant and governor, about 1546. Sir Michael Stanhope was executed as an accomplice of his brother-in-law, the duke of Somerset, in 1552. Edward Stanhope's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26249/', "Sir John Stanhope (c.1540&#150;1621)")</script> became first Baron Stanhope, while another brother, also named Edward (<i>c</i>.1543&#150;1603), was treasurer of Gray's Inn, member of the council of the north, and MP for Nottinghamshire in 1571 and 1572 and for Yorkshire in 1601. His other brothers, Sir Michael (<i>c</i>.1549&#150;<i>c</i>.1621) and Sir Thomas Stanhope (<i>c</i>.1540&#150;1596), were also notable. The former was a prominent courtier and landowner, and the latter was an important figure in midland politics, being JP for Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, sheriff for both counties on a number of occasions, and deputy lieutenant of Nottinghamshire. Both men were MPs. Edward Stanhope the younger entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1560, graduated BA in 1563, was a minor fellow in 1564, and graduated MA in 1566. In 1569 he was elected a major fellow. Robert Beaumont and John Whitgift were masters of the college during these years.<br>
<br>An appointment as prebendary of Botevant, Yorkshire, in 1572 secured through the influence of his kinsman William Cecil, first Baron Burghley, lord treasurer, yielded &pound;20 per annum and enabled Stanhope to study civil law. He received the degree of LLD in 1575 and was admitted as an advocate of the arches that same year. He became a member of Doctors' Commons on 15 January 1576, and in 1580 he leased a set of chambers at that society's house on Knightrider Street. He served as master in chancery from 1577 to 1608, chancellor of London diocese from 1578 to 1608, and vicar-general to Richard Bancroft, archbishop of Canterbury, from 1605 to 1608, a position he held jointly with Sir Thomas Crompton. In this latter capacity he was responsible for confirming the election of bishops, a task he often shared with his fellow civilians. Burghley obtained for him the additional post of commissioner in the fines office in 1589. He also served occasionally as a commissioner for admiralty criminal causes, commissioner for piracy, and member of the court of delegates. In 1589 he was presented to the rectory of Terrington in Norfolk and two years later he was appointed canon and chancellor of St Paul's Cathedral, at which time he resigned his prebend.<br>
<br>Stanhope's service as an ecclesiastical judge and as a member of the high commission from 1584 until 1608 gained him the reputation as an implacable opponent of puritans. The Marprelate tracts in 1588 and 1589 referred to him as Tarquinius Superbus and predicted that &#145;a praemunire will take you by the back, one day, for oppressing and tyrannizing over her Majesty's subjects as you do&#146;  (Pierce, 32, 51). He was also involved in the prosecution of Catholics, being named to a special commission &#145;touching Jesuits and other disguised persons&#146; in 1593  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1558&#150;1603</span>, 3.437). In 1604 he and three other civilians were appointed to a committee to examine the books printed in the realm without authority. Stanhope also became involved in questions regarding the procedure and competence of ecclesiastical courts. In November 1594 John Whitgift, archbishop of Canterbury, commissioned him to survey the ecclesiastical courts in London, and in 1604 Bancroft appointed him, together with Sir Thomas Ridley and John Cowell, to revise the canons concerning procedure in the ecclesiastical courts.<br>
<br>In the parliaments of 1584 and 1586 Stanhope was elected MP for Marlborough, Wiltshire, through the patronage of his cousin Edward Seymour, earl of Hertford. Hertford concentrated his leading legal clients, including Stanhope, in the House of Commons. Stanhope was included on the parliamentary committee regarding the fate of Mary, queen of Scots, in 1586. In 1593&#150;4 he was also appointed to the commission of oyer and terminer to try Roderigo Lopez, Elizabeth I's physician, and others for treason, and in 1603 he was included on a commission to try Sir Walter Ralegh for the same crime. Stanhope twice avoided charges of political disloyalty himself. His testimony regarding the legitimacy of Hertford's younger son Thomas Seymour in 1592, who was born in the Tower after his parents' marriage had been declared invalid, came to the attention of the queen in 1595, but Whitgift protected Stanhope from any serious consequences. Final recognition of his wealth and status came under James I, when he was created KB on 25 July 1603.<br>
<br>Known as &#145;rich doctor Stanhope&#146;, Sir Edward combined the profits of many offices to produce exceptional wealth, especially for a civilian  (&#145;Journal of Sir Roger Wilbraham&#146;, 100). He amassed an estate estimated at &pound;40,000, including five manors in Yorkshire, one in Lincolnshire, and another in Warwickshire. In 1600 the crown granted him and his brother Michael the manor of Hucknall Torkhard in Nottinghamshire. Edward Stanhope lent money to the earl of Arundel and Sir William Sandys and was known for being &#145;miserly in his expenditure&#146;  (ibid., 99). He died in London on 16 March 1608 and was buried in St Paul's. He bequeathed &pound;700 and his books on divinity, canon law, civil law, common law, and statute law to Trinity College, and made other generous bequests. As he never married, the remainder of Stanhope's substantial estate was divided up among his family.<br>
