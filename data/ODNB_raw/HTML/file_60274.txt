<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rogers,  Stephen Robert</span>  (1955&#150;1988), <span class="occ">magazine editor and arts promoter</span>, was born on 7 August 1955 at 28 Bayly Avenue, Portchester, Hampshire, the second son of Robert Leslie Rogers and his wife, Betty Kirk Rogers (formerly Houlton). His father came from Canada and, at the time of Rogers's birth, was a refrigeration engineer. He died soon after his son was born. Nothing more is known of Rogers's family or antecedents. From 1966 to 1972 he attended the Royal Hospital school, a boarding-school in the village of Holbrook, near Ipswich. He was expelled when he was in the sixth form, reportedly either for smoking cannabis or for an unsuitable relationship. He took good A-level grades elsewhere. Between 1973 and 1976 he studied at St Chad's College, Durham University, where he gained a BA degree in combined arts and also became involved in student politics. He obtained a postgraduate MA degree in arts administration at the City University, London, and visited New York on a university secondment.<br>
<br>Rogers's early jobs were in arts administration, including posts at the Redgrave Theatre, Farnham, and Bubble Theatre, London. In 1979 he became performance director at the Midland Group Arts Centre, Nottingham, and launched the important Performance Art Platform, an annual festival of performance art (later the National Review of Live Art). In 1983 he joined the British-American Arts Association in London and was programme director for &#145;Britain salutes New York&#146;, an exhibition of British art, highly regarded both by public and critics, which the association presented in New York.<br>
<br>Between 1985 and 1988 Rogers managed the two distinguished performance artists Marty St James and Anne Wilson. He worked on their <span class="italic">Civic Monument</span> project, a large-scale performance &#145;monument&#146;, which was erected on the back of an articulated lorry, but used performers instead of statues. Dedicated to the ordinary person, its themes included war, television, work, and love.<br>
<br>Rogers was a long-time contributor to <span class="italic">Performance Magazine</span>, and in 1987 was appointed its editor; in these capacities inheres his significance for the arts of his day. He made an influential contribution to the development of performance art (or &#145;live art&#146;) and visual theatre. While always committed to creative work that was &#145;new, vital and revolutionary&#146;, as he wrote in an unpublished notebook, he wanted it to be accessible to everybody and was suspicious of the hidden power of arts programmers (he was, of course, testifying from his own experience in the role). His explorations of the nature of performance were both rigorous and broad: in issue 28, for example, he wittily and perceptively reviewed the Cruft's dog show, and, later, was one of the first to feature the drag artist Lily Savage. He strongly believed in the importance of international cultural exchange.<br>
<br>Rogers maintained an interest in politics throughout his life. He was an active member of the Labour Party and ran unsuccessfully for office on his local council. During his years in London his income was usually low and variable. From time to time he supplemented it by working as a bicycle courier, and he was once a noise control officer in Hackney. There is some evidence in his papers that he was planning a novel, but no more than part of a draft chapter and a few other fragments survive.<br>
<br>Rogers was tall and well made, with a pale complexion, closely cut hair, and a relaxed, slightly sleepy manner. He was homosexual at a time when social change had made it easier for men to &#145;come out&#146; than in the past. He refused to separate his sexuality from the other dimensions of his life, and in his work and his politics presented himself as a gay man. His surviving letters and papers, which describe travel in Europe and his time in New York, reveal a young man delighted to make the most of sexual opportunity. It was almost certainly in the United States that he contracted HIV. As early as 1982 he was reporting illnesses that may have been a consequence of the infection; the pneumonia that killed him certainly was. He died at The Hospital, Scarborough, on 10 December 1988. During his last years he lived happily with his lover, Mark Stevens, an airline steward for Britannia Airlines, who died of an AIDS-related illness a few weeks before Rogers himself.<br>
