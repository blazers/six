<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  James  fitz Maurice</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1579), <span class="occ">soldier and landowner</span>, was the second son of Maurice fitz John Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1564), called Maurice an T&oacute;ite&aacute;n (Maurice of the Burnings), and Julia, second daughter of Dermot O'Mulryan of Sulloghade, co. Tipperary. He married Katherine, daughter of William Burke of Clanwilliam, with whom he had two sons, Maurice and Gerald, who both died in 1588, and a daughter. In 1573 he was also said to have abandoned his wife and married an O'Brien, the widow of O'Connor Kerry, although this appears unlikely. Fitzgerald's father was a loyal military retainer of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9560/', "James fitz John Fitzgerald, thirteenth earl of Desmond (d. 1558)")</script>, and James fitz Maurice was to fulfil a similar role for <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9556/', "Gerald fitz James Fitzgerald, fourteenth earl (c.1533&#150;1583)")</script>.<br>
<br>In late 1563, during Gerald's absence in England, James fitz Maurice was involved in attacks on the estates of Thomas Butler, tenth earl of Ormond (<i>d</i>. 1614), Gerald's arch-rival. James's career might have consisted of little more than such military encounters had it not been for Gerald's fateful defeat by Ormond at the battle of Affane, co. Waterford, in February 1565. Gerald, after a period of detention in England in 1565&#150;6, was recaptured by the lord deputy, Sir Henry Sidney, in March 1567, and in December was sent to the Tower of London. Gerald's imprisonment, together with that of his brother Sir John of Desmond, created a power vacuum within the earldom of Desmond which James was quick to fill. Appointed captain of the Desmonds by Gerald during the latter's absence, James was initially challenged for leadership of the Desmonds by Thomas Roe fitz James, older half-brother of Gerald, but had overcome Thomas by March 1568. In July of that year he invaded Clanmaurice, co. Kerry, the territory of Thomas Fitzmaurice, baron of Lixnaw, a collateral branch of the Desmonds, and captured a prey of cattle which James claimed in lieu of rents due to the earl. James then unsuccessfully besieged Lixnaw; although he suffered heavy casualties he survived that temporary setback.<br>
<br>The following year James fitz Maurice participated in two acts which were to transform the political situation in Munster. In February 1569 he, along with MacCarthy More and other lords of Munster, held an assembly at which they agreed that the Henrician Reformation, supported and furthered by Edward VI and Elizabeth, had broken the conditions of the bull <span class="italic">Laudabiliter</span> by which Pope Adrian IV had granted Ireland to Henry II for the maintenance and propagation of the Catholic faith in Ireland. As a consequence Adrian's grant was void, as were obligations of loyalty to Elizabeth, and the pope was thus free to nominate a new overlord for Ireland. The assembled lords therefore dispatched two papal bishops as envoys to Spain, namely Maurice MacGibbon, archbishop of Cashel, and Thomas O'Herlihy, bishop of Ross. They called on King Philip II to nominate a Habsburg of his choice to be monarch of Ireland, subject to Rome's agreement. Unfortunately for fitz Maurice this endeavour to change the constitutional relationship between Ireland and England came to nought as Philip had his own concerns and consequently gave MacGibbon no support. The second event occurred in June 1569 when fitz Maurice attacked the barony of Kerrycurrihy, co. Cork, starting the first Desmond rebellion. Kerrycurrihy, which had previously belonged to James's father, had been mortgaged by Gerald to Sir Warham St Leger, and James's attack on such a prominent English official increased the seriousness of the situation. However, even more important was the religious component of James's actions, the rebellion, at least in James's eyes, turning into a Catholic crusade against the English &#145;heretics&#146;. He captured Kilmallock, calling for the restoration of the Roman Catholic faith within the town, and on 12 July sought the same within Cork, demanding the expulsion from the city of all protestants. He was also joined in rebellion by Sir Edmund and Piers Butler, Ormond's brothers, who had their own dispute with Sir Peter Carew over lands in co. Carlow.<br>
<br>The English response to these rebellions was swift, Humphrey Gilbert defeating James's forces in September near Kilmallock. Gilbert's uncompromising campaigning soon weakened the resolve of James's allies for the conflict, with MacCarthy More submitting in December, while the Butlers did likewise in February 1570. James remained steadfast, however, attacked Kilmallock again in February 1570, and was engaged in negotiations with a French agent in December. In spite of the crown's best efforts James remained at large, once more assaulting Kilmallock in February 1571. Shortly afterwards Sir John Perrot, lord president of Munster, arrived at Waterford and pursued the rebels throughout the province, although he failed to capture Castlemaine Castle despite a five-week siege in June and July. Perrot's frustration at his inability to end the rebellion led him to challenge James to a duel in November, eventually agreeing to a combat between the two leaders along with twelve horsemen and twelve footmen each. Having made the match, however, James did not turn up, reasoning that if he was killed the rebellion would collapse, while if Perrot was killed Elizabeth would merely send someone else to take his place.<br>
<br>The lord president attacked Castlemaine again in June 1572 and captured it after a three-month siege. James was soon initiating contact with the crown to end the rebellion, meeting Captain Bourchier on 8 December, and on 23 February 1573 he submitted to Perrot at Kilmallock. Peace was not yet restored to Munster, however, as towards the end of the year James occupied Carrigafoyle Castle, a strategically located castle on the north Kerry coast, and began gathering men, while Gerald, having been sent back to Dublin in March 1573, escaped in November and made his way home, being met by James at Limerick. Gerald re-established his control over Munster, retook castles, including Castlemaine, and in the summer of 1574 James captured Bourchier, the English commander at Kilmallock, holding him captive for about a month. From this position of strength Gerald entered into unsuccessful negotiations with the crown, but after a short campaign in August by Lord Deputy Sir William Fitzwilliam, highlighted by his sacking of Derrinlaur Castle, Gerald submitted in September.<br>
<br>The first Desmond rebellion was over, but James had not yet given up hope of relaunching his religious crusade, and in March 1575 he sailed to France with his family and some supporters. On the continent he became deeply involved in the machinations of international affairs, first seeking aid at the French court. The month after his arrival in France he was presented to the young King Henri III, who in July wrote to Queen Elizabeth urging her to pardon James and restore him to his lands in Ireland. James had meanwhile settled at the port town of St Malo where he was to remain until 1577. He again met Henri in August 1576, but sensing that there was no French support coming he decided to go to Rome. There he was greatly encouraged by Pope Gregory XIII, who on 25 February 1577 issued a papal brief urging the people of Ireland to support James when he returned to Ireland, Pope Gregory stating that those who did so would gain a plenary indulgence and remission of their sins. With papal backing for his plans, James set out for the Iberian peninsula to recruit and equip his forces. Arriving in Madrid in May, he was refused an audience with the king, although he did meet Nicholas Sander who was part of a group of English Catholic exiles on the continent seeking support for their plans to return to England.<br>
<br>Disappointed by Philip's lack of interest, James was in Lisbon by July 1577, although here he was twice refused access to King Sebastian. Undaunted, he succeeded in hiring a ship, and on 19 November his crew sailed from Lisbon bound for Ireland with an assortment of weapons and munition. However, the ship was forced to shelter in Moruiero harbour, near Corunna, after it was damaged in a series of storms. There the crew mutinied, whereupon James had them arrested for breach of contract, but they escaped, and when James returned from mass on the feast of the Epiphany, 6 January 1578, the ship with his cargo was gone. James returned to St Malo, ending the year at Bilbao where he hired a new ship and recruited about fifty troops. Joined by Sander in March 1579, James and his small force set sail from Ferrol with four ships on 17 June. On the sea voyage they captured a French ship, which was released, and two English ships, which were not.<br>
<br>James landed at Dingle, co. Kerry, on 18 July 1579, his men fortifying D&uacute;n an &Oacute;ir at Smerwick harbour. He appealed to various Irish lords to join him, although initially few did. Then, on 1 August, Gerald's brothers Sir John and Sir James killed Sir Henry Davells, constable of Dungarvan, and nineteen others of his party while they slept in Tralee, Davells having been sent to secure Gerald's loyalty to the crown. This act, which committed the brothers to the rebellion, greatly increased the rebel strength. However, James fitz Maurice and Sir John soon fell out with each other, apparently over the death of a woman in the rebel camp, and James decided to journey to the north of Ireland. On the way his band became involved in a skirmish with the Burkes of Clanwilliam over stolen horses, and he was killed on 18 August 1579. His followers cut off his head and hid his body, it being subsequently found by the English forces. Lord Justice Drury then had the body quartered, with a quarter each being sent to Limerick, Kilmallock, Cork, and Waterford. James had possessed the cantred of Kerrycurrihy until it was mortgaged to St Leger, and on 23 April 1574 Gerald had granted James the castles of Glin, co. Limerick, and Tarbert and Carrigafoyle, co. Kerry, until the mortgage was repaid. However, James had lost <i>de facto</i> possession of these castles when he left Ireland the following year, and consequently died a landless man.<br>
<br>By the time of his death James fitz Maurice, a tough, proud man with a strong faith, had made a highly significant contribution to events in Ireland during the latter half of the sixteenth century. He participated in the formulation of a constitutional challenge to Ireland's position under the crown of England, and twice initiated conflicts with the intention of restoring the Roman Catholic faith in Ireland. Ultimately, however, his legacy was an unintentional one, his return in 1579 sparking off the crisis which developed into the second Desmond rebellion (1579&#150;83) which destroyed the earldom of Desmond and its society, and paved the way for the plantation of Munster.<br>
