<span class="headword">Welsh,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1681), <span class="occ">covenanter field preacher</span>, was the son of Josiah Welsh (<i>d</i>. 1634), minister at Temple-Kirkpatrick, co. Antrim, Ireland, and the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28979/', "John Welsh (1568/9&#150;1622)")</script>, Church of Scotland and French reformed minister, and the great-grandson of the illustrious Scottish reformer, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15781/', "John Knox (d. 1572)")</script>. Little is known about his early years. He graduated MA from the University of Glasgow in 1647, and was admitted and ordained minister of the parish of Kirkpatrick-Irongray, Kirkcudbrightshire, on 21 January 1653 at the instigation of David M'Brear of Newark and Almagill (MP for the stewarty of Kirkcudbright and patron of that charge). On 18 February the same year he married Elizabeth Somerville (<i>d</i>. before 1674), at Holyrood, Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Welsh vehemently opposed the reimposition of Erastian episcopacy at the Restoration and was ejected from his incumbency and deprived of his living in 1662. Notwithstanding repeated and sustained attempts by the state to have him apprehended and silenced, Welsh sustained a long and popular itinerant ministry throughout the south-west of Scotland, the Lothians, and into Fife and Perthshire, preaching in vacant pulpits and in the open air for some nineteen years. The civil authorities forfeited him in 1667 for having been present at the Pentland rising the previous November. By 1674 the government was offering a reward of 2000 merks for his apprehension. The intensity of the campaign to eradicate conventicling was such that by August he was forced to seek refuge over the border in Northumberland. His first wife having died, Welsh was able to remarry, and did so probably in that year; his second wife's name is unknown.<br>
<br>Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh, the king's advocate in Scotland, who earned the infamous sobriquet Bloody Mackenzie for his severe persecution of the covenanters, described Welsh as a &#145;person of much courage, but no parts&#146;  (Wodrow, 2.244n.). It was testimony to his indefatigable courage and commitment to presbyterian principles that Welsh was back preaching and serving those who shared his beliefs in the south-west early in 1675. On account of his appeal and influence right across the social spectrum throughout lowland Scotland, Charles II, in his determination to have Welsh detained and prosecuted, ordered that the sum on his head be raised to a staggering 9000 merks in February 1679. Welsh continued to serve the covenanters in the wake of Drumclog and Bothwell Bridge, but he championed moderation and cautioned Richard Cameron and those of like conviction against separation from those ministers who had accepted the indulgence.<br>
<br>Some time after Bothwell Bridge, in defiance of the price on his head Welsh went to London, where he died on 9 January 1681. He was buried in the churchyard of St Botolph without Bishopsgate. A number of his sermons were published posthumously. These include: <span class="italic">A Preface, Lecture, and a Sermon</span> (1686); <span class="italic">Fifty and Two Directions to his Parish of Irongray</span> (1703); <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached at Nemphlar Brae in Clidsdale</span> (1703); and <span class="italic">An Alarm to the Impenitent: the Great Gospel Sumonds to Close with Christ</span> and <span class="italic">The Church's Paradox</span> in 1710.<br>
