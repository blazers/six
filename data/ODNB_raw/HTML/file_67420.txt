<span class="headword">Breman <span class="st"> [Braman]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1627, <em>d.</em> 1703), <span class="occ">army officer, politician, and conspirator</span>, was baptized on 27 March 1627 at Alton, Hampshire, the eldest surviving son of Thomas Braman (<i>d</i>. 1661), mercer of Alton. He first appears in 1647 as one of the regimental agitators of the New Model Army horse regiment of Colonel Nathaniel Rich. The regiment was prominent in opposing parliament's demand to disband and he and his fellow agitator Nicholas Lockyer may have drawn up the regiment's petition of grievances in the spring of that year. <br>
<br>Breman remained with Rich's regiment until December 1654 when, now a lieutenant, he was implicated in the so-called Overton Plot, when papers criticizing the protectorate were circulated among troops in Scotland. Together with four fellow officers he was court-martialled in February 1655, cashiered, required to post bond for his good behaviour, and sent to England. Breman evidently remained on good terms with Rich, who had broken with Cromwell the previous year and had been deprived of his regiment, for when Rich was restored to his regiment in July 1659 by the Rump Parliament, Breman returned to it as well, now as a captain. Swiftly promoted major, he induced his troops to join a mutinous garrison at Portsmouth that had declared for parliament in December in the wake of an army coup, and which Rich's regiment had been sent to suppress. Rich, who had temporized with the coup, acquiesced in Breman's action, and when the regiment returned to London at the end of the month Breman was included in parliament's thanks. General Monck responded by removing Rich from his command on 26 February 1660. He and Breman tried to contest the order, but, on 1 March, Rich surrendered his commission, and Breman was dismissed as well. <br>
<br>Breman remained under close surveillance. In April he was arrested on suspicion of complicity in Colonel John Lambert's projected rising. A plot to free him from custody along with the former major-general James Berry was subsequently reported. In September 1661 the erstwhile parliamentary radical Praisegod Barebone visited him in prison. Breman and Berry were among those sent to the Tower for closer confinement on 18 May 1662, and Breman was later sent to Windsor Castle. In 1664 he admitted knowledge of weapons that had been brought into England from the Netherlands and New England. Upon his release the following year he returned to private life in Chichester, Sussex, worshipping as an Independent and apparently maintaining his links to radical activists such as Colonel Henry Danvers. His first wife, Sarah, died in 1657 and about 1665 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. in or before 1696), widow of William Marlow of Itchingfield, Sussex, and daughter of Edward Osborne of Hartlip, Kent. However, the ceremony may have been performed by a fellow nonconformist, casting doubt over the marriage's validity. <br>
<br>In 1678 Breman was offered a commission by an old comrade in arms, Colonel Richard Norton, to serve in Flanders under Colonel George Legge, but declined, citing ill health and his long absence from military service. Two months later, however, he was observed with the prominent republican John Wildman, and was soon actively involved in the politics of the exclusion crisis. Breman served for Chichester in the parliaments of 1679, 1680, and 1681, and at the dissolution of the latter he was reportedly in correspondence with the veteran radicals John Gladman and Richard Rumbold. A consistent supporter of exclusion, he was described in September 1681 as &#145;a great fanatic&#146;  (Zaller, 93) and dissenters were reported to be supporting him for a county seat in the next election. <br>
<br>Breman remained a visible figure. In October 1682 he was projected as one of the leaders of a cavalry regiment in a plot promoted by the earl of Essex to seize Whitehall on behalf of the duke of Monmouth, the exclusionist candidate for the throne. In February 1683 he and his brother-in-law Richard Farringdon helped mount a demonstration in Chester on behalf of Monmouth. That same month his name appeared on a list of radicals purportedly plotting to raise an insurrection in London, perhaps in connection with a plot to assassinate the duke of York, the heir to the throne. In late July he was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower in connection with the planned general insurrection known as the Rye House plot on the urging of the bishop of Chichester, who described him as a &#145;desperate&#146; enemy to the king and &#145;as bad as a plague&#146; locally  (Zaller, 94). In October he successfully petitioned for his release, promising &#145;that he would live a private retired life etc and not serve in Parliament&#146;  (DWL, Morrice entring book P, 383). However, in July 1685 he conspired in Monmouth's abortive rising and was again arrested. <br>
<br>Breman was among the nonconformists briefly courted by James II in 1687 and 1688. In December 1687 he was appointed to a commission of inquiry to investigate unreported fines against dissenters and recusants in the previous ten years. The following May he was included in the Sussex commission of the peace, and in September he received both court and dissenter backing as a candidate for parliament. None the less he joined William of Orange's invasion army in November. In July 1689 he appeared as the major of a volunteer regiment of horse composed of London citizens, whose colonel was William himself. More substantial reward came in 1692 when he was appointed deputy governor of the Isle of Wight. On about 22 September 1696 he married his third wife, Elizabeth, widow of Thomas Mathew of High Street, Lewes, Sussex, and daughter of Thomas Meeres of Glynleigh House, Westham, in the same county. After this marriage he moved to Lewes and died on 25 August 1703. He was buried at All Saints', Lewes, and was survived by his wife.<br>
