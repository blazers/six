<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cook,  Arthur James</span>  (1883&#150;1931), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 22 November 1883 in Wookey, Somerset, the oldest of ten children of Thomas Cook, a soldier, and his wife, Selina. Selina's religious convictions were a formative influence on Cook's early life. At the age of twelve he began work near Cheddar as a labourer on the farm of Caleb Durbin, whose radical politics also influenced his development. Cook became a boy preacher, and was offered a place at Baptist college to train for the ministry. Instead, in 1901, he joined the exodus of agricultural workers from the west country attracted by high wages in the south Wales coalfield.<br>
<br>Moving to Porth, in the Rhondda, Cook began work in the Trefor colliery in Trehafod. On his first day underground, a miner working nearby was killed in a roof fall, and Cook helped carry him home to his family, experiences which left a lasting impression. As a Baptist preacher he was active in the religious revival of 1904&#150;5, but shortly afterwards began to take an interest in trade union and political matters. Apparently around late 1905 or early 1906 he came into contact with the Independent Labour Party (ILP), which he joined. His politics were ill-received by his chapel, from which he had to resign, along with his wife Annie (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Edwards), whom he married in 1906. He became active in the union at the Coedcae colliery, where he now worked, and quickly became a lodge official. He claimed that he had held every official lodge position before 1914.<br>
<br>The south Wales coalfield was experiencing explosive growth, and the Rhondda, the heart of the coalfield, grew by over a third between 1901 and 1911. In this frontier society, signs of a new militancy appeared, especially around the Cambrian combine dispute of 1910&#150;11. In its aftermath some younger miners formed the Unofficial Reform Committee, with which Cook was associated, and produced the famous pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Miners' Next Step</span> (1912). Its central themes of a class struggle, an industrial union, and the need for rank-and-file control reflected Cook's own beliefs, and shaped his actions for the next decade.<br>
<br>Cook was awarded a two-year scholarship by the Pontypridd and Rhondda district of the South Wales Miners' Federation (SWMF) to the Central Labour College (CLC) in 1911, where he absorbed the college's Marxist teachings. He did not return for his second year, instead becoming actively involved once more in the labour movement. Elected as chairman of Coedcae lodge in 1913 and of the Lewis Merthyr joint committee of lodges in January 1914, he was also influential in establishing the Industrial Democracy League and agitated for independent working-class education.<br>
<br>Cook openly opposed the First World War in April 1916, after which time he was under persistent police surveillance. Arrested and charged with sedition in March 1918 under the <span class="roman">Defence of the Realm Act</span>, he was sentenced to three months' imprisonment, of which he served two. After his release from prison, he became increasingly seen as a leader of the left in the Rhondda.<br>
<br>Against a background of industrial turmoil, Cook, a committed revolutionary, was elected in November 1919 as miners' agent for the Rhondda no. 1 district, a full-time post through which he automatically became a member of the SWMF executive. In January 1921 his meteoric rise continued when he became a member of the executive of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB). A month later the decontrol of the mining industry was announced, with a consequent end to a national wages agreement and wage reductions. A three-month lock-out from April 1921 ended in defeat for the miners; at its end Cook was again gaoled for two months' hard labour for incitement and unlawful assembly.<br>
<br>Cook was a member of the South Wales Socialist Society, and a foundation member of the Communist Party, from which he resigned in 1921, although he remained close to it. In 1923 Cook and others launched the miners' minority movement in south Wales, which gave him important backing the following year when he won the south Wales nomination in his bid for general secretaryship of the MFGB. He won the national ballot and assumed office on 14 April 1924. Committed to ending private ownership in the coal industry, and the overthrow of capitalism, in office Cook also displayed a capacity for innovation. He worked to build the &#145;triple alliance&#146; with rail and transport unions, and, through regular campaigning visits to the coalfields, stayed close to his membership.<br>
<br>When further wage cuts were demanded in 1925, Cook mobilized the MFGB to resist and, with the support of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), won a nine-month subsidy from the Baldwin government. When the subsidy ended in 1926 conflict was inevitable, although Cook, sensing the weakness in the union's situation, sought to avoid it. The TUC called a general strike in support of the locked out miners, but after nine days it was called off. When negotiations failed, Cook threw himself into the dispute, touring coalfields. He was a magnetic orator with an emotional style. He was revered by the miners for his unstinting commitment to their cause and for his public defence of &#145;Not a Penny off the Pay, Not a Second on the Day.&#146; Such public obduracy masked a desire to negotiate a settlement which would stop the suffering in the coalfield and the undermining of the union through a drift back to work. The strain of his work as the only full-time national official and his tireless efforts during the lock-out led to his physical and mental exhaustion. After seven months the miners were completely defeated, membership fell markedly, and rival unions were set up in various coalfields.<br>
<br>Cook was vilified in the press and in sections of the labour movement for what was perceived as poor leadership (a criticism which has been effectively rebutted by his biographer Paul Davies). He became isolated within the MFGB and the TUC, where he opposed the trend towards &#145;Mondism&#146; and reaffirmed his belief in class struggle. In 1929 Cook broke with his erstwhile allies in the Communist Party as they adopted the policy of &#145;class against class&#146;, including the formation of a breakaway United Mineworkers of Scotland. In his last years Cook, realizing the weakness of the MFGB, followed a pragmatic line within the industry. Although he gave general support to the second Labour government, his concern at high unemployment in the coalfields led to his signing the &#145;Mosley manifesto&#146; in December 1930 which made radical recommendations for economic recovery, involving state intervention and a public works programme. He never publicly supported Sir Oswald Mosley's New Party when it was launched in March 1931, although he may have made supportive comments privately before its fascist nature became apparent.<br>
<br>Cook's health had been a concern since the 1926 lock-out. Ignoring all advice he refused to reduce his workload, and continuously drove himself to the point of breakdown. His failure to seek medical attention for an injury to his leg, aggravated by a kick from a demonstrator in 1926, resulted in its amputation in January 1931. He suffered further ill health, and was then found to have cancer. He died on 2 November 1931 at Manor House Hospital in Golders Green and was cremated at the Golders Green crematorium. He was survived by his wife, a son, and two daughters. Cook retained the loyalty and affection of the miners long after his death. A levy of a halfpenny per miner raised &pound;1032 for his dependants.<br>
