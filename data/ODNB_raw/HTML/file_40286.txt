<span class="headword">Barr,  James</span>  (1862&#150;1949), <span class="occ">minister of the United Free Church of Scotland and politician</span>, was born on 26 July 1862 at Beanscroft Farm in the parish of Fenwick, Ayrshire, the eldest of eight children born to Allan Barr, farmer, and his wife, Elizabeth Brown. James, or Jimmy, was educated at the local subscription school at Waterside in Fenwick, and then at Kilmarnock Academy, where he was dux in 1879. That same year he entered Glasgow University, where he enjoyed a glittering period as an undergraduate winning numerous prizes and medals, and graduating MA in 1884 with a joint first in moral philosophy and logic.<br>
<br>After a year touring North America recuperating from a breakdown, Barr took up a scholarship at Trinity College, Glasgow, the college of the United Free Church, to study for the ministry. His first charge was at Johnstone and Wamphray Free Church in his native Ayrshire, which he took up in 1889 and where, a year later, he married Martha Wilson Stephen (1863&#150;1959), a member of his old church in Kilmarnock and with whom he had five children. In 1896 he moved to Glasgow, first at Dennistoun Free Church and then, in 1907, he took charge of St Mary's in Govan, home of Clyde shipyards and other heavy industries, a position which he held until 1920, when he became secretary of the Home Mission Board of the United Free Church.<br>
<br>Barr brought an evangelical fervour and social commitment to his ministries. He introduced a more informal style to church services and was determined to reach those who did not attend regular worship; at St Mary's he established a &#145;Men's Own&#146; society which was successful in attracting working men. He was active in the Liberal cause as early as the 1892 general election, seeing in Liberalism the vehicle for realizing disestablishment, temperance, home rule for Scotland, and the taxation of land values. A member of local school boards in Ayrshire, he was first elected to the Glasgow school board in 1903 and was returned in subsequent elections, topping the poll in 1910. His work in education and his general outlook brought him closer to the labour movement and in 1913 he was honoured by the boilermakers on Clydeside for his efforts on their behalf in the lock-out of 1910. Official recognition was bestowed on him in 1914 when he was invited onto the royal commission on the housing of the industrial population of Scotland, the <span class="italic">Report</span> of which (1917) was significant in promoting state involvement in the provision of housing.<br>
<br>In 1919 Barr was appointed to lead a national campaign by all temperance groups in support of prohibition, though the local veto poll of 1920 was a major disappointment as a clear majority voted for &#145;no change&#146; rather than &#145;no licence&#146;. However the issue brought him closer to the Independent Labour Party, which he joined in 1920. In 1924 he was elected Labour MP for Motherwell. He was not unique among Presbyterian ministers in embracing socialism, but he was certainly in a small minority, as most were strongly antagonistic to Labour. Moreover, he also spoke out clearly against the anti-Irish prejudices so noticeable in the protestant churches at this time; his victory at Motherwell had been against a sitting &#145;Orange and protestant&#146; MP. A founder and past president of the Scottish Home Rule Association, he introduced in 1927 a <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span> for Scotland, the failure of which (and a similar bill in 1924) helped stimulate the formation of the nationalist movement in Scotland. As chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party he loyally supported MacDonald and Snowden throughout the crisis of 1931, though he had misgivings that the government had sold out to the bankers. The formation of the National Government, however, proved the breaking point for him. He was defeated in the general election of October 1931, though he was returned in November 1935 for Coatbridge, which he held until his retirement in June 1945.<br>
<br>Barr controversially led the minority of the United Free Church against union with the Church of Scotland in 1929. He was in favour of unity but not at the price of the continuing establishment of church and state, and he became the first moderator of the United Free Church (Continuing), a position he held again in 1943. His writings on church questions included <span class="italic">The Scottish Church Question</span> (1920), <span class="italic">The United Free Church of Scotland</span> (1934), and <span class="italic">The Scottish Covenanters</span> (1946). One of his sons became professor of <span class="roman">New Testament</span> literature and exegesis, and his daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48834/', "Elizabeth Brown Barr (1905&#150;1995)")</script> became the first woman to be ordained as a Presbyterian minister in Scotland.<br>
<br>Barr remained committed to his principles throughout his life, a trait which sat uneasily with the compromises demanded of a parliamentary politician. But in his life and work he embodied much of Scottish history and society. His own family was steeped in the traditions of the covenanters, he was a great enthusiast for Burns, he was a pacifist actively opposed to the South African War and the First World War, even though his three sons joined up and one died in the latter. He was an ardent supporter of home rule and prohibition, and just as ardently opposed to capital punishment. He believed in free education for all and, while a member of the Glasgow school board, supported the efforts which led in 1913 to the establishment of a chair in Scottish history and literature at Glasgow University. He opposed fascism and communism (see his book <span class="italic">Religious Liberty in Totalitarian States: the Challenge to the Church of Communism, Fascism, Nazism</span>, 1938). He supported Chamberlain over Munich and even in November 1939 was calling for a negotiated peace. He did not oppose the war but was not an enthusiastic supporter, and found his role in serving as convener of the committee on the position of conscientious objectors.<br>
<br>As befits the son of a &#145;bonnet laird&#146;, Barr has been described as looking like a farmer: a tall, brawny man and a powerful speaker. He died at 75 Clouston Street, Glasgow, on 24 February 1949 and was buried in his home parish of Fenwick.<br>
