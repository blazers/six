<span class="headword">Marshall,  Herbert Brough Falcon</span>  (1890&#150;1966), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 23 May 1890 at 36 Fitzroy Road, Primrose Hill, London, the son of Percy Falcon Marshall, comedian, and his wife, Ethel May Turner. He was educated privately and at St Mary's College, Harlow, Essex, after which he was engaged as an articled clerk with a firm of chartered accountants in the City. He became the business manager of impresario Robert Courtneidge before making his acting d&eacute;but at the Opera House, Buxton, as a servant in <span class="italic">The Adventure of Lady Ursula</span> by Anthony Hope (1911). His London d&eacute;but was at the Prince's Theatre as Tommy in <span class="italic">Brewster's Millions</span>, the comedy by G. B. McCutcheon, W. Smith, and B. Ongley (1913), after which he toured the United States and Canada with Cyril Maude's company. He served in the British expeditionary force during the First World War but lost a leg. Subsequently, although he had a slightly stiff walk, his career was unaffected. On 14 August 1915 he married Hilda Lloyd Bosley, known as Mollie Maitland; they were later divorced.<br>
<br>After the war Marshall initially joined the company of the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, but soon became a popular and busy West End star. Additionally he toured the United States and Canada with Marie Lohr (1921), and appeared in New York in <span class="italic">The Voice from the Minaret</span> by R. S. Hichens and <span class="italic">Fedora</span> by H. Merivale (both 1922), and <span class="italic">These Charming People</span> (1925). He played Prince Keri in No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">The Queen was in the Parlour</span> in London at the St Martin's (1926) and was in New York again, in <span class="italic">The High Road</span>, a comedy by Frederick Lonsdale (1928), with Edna Best (1900&#150;1974). She became his second wife in 1928. Marshall and Best became a popular team, both on stage (<span class="italic">Michael and Mary</span> and F. Molnar's <span class="italic">The Swan</span>, both 1930, and <span class="italic">There's always Juliet</span>, 1931&#150;2), and on screen. Marshall's film d&eacute;but was <span class="italic">Mumsie</span> (1927) but it was his performance as the lover in <span class="italic">The Letter</span> (1929), made in Hollywood from Somerset Maugham's novel, which attracted attention and led to a contract with Paramount Studios. The Marshalls had film commitments in Britain: he was excellent in Alfred Hitchcock's <span class="italic">Murder</span> (1930), and together they appeared in <span class="italic">Michael and Mary</span> and <span class="italic">The Calendar</span> (both 1931) and <span class="italic">The Faithful Heart</span> (1932). Back at Paramount he was suddenly starring in big films opposite major actresses&#151;in Josef von Sternberg's <span class="italic">Blonde Venus</span> with Marlene Dietrich and as the suave jewel thief in Ernst Lubitsch's wonderful <span class="italic">Trouble in Paradise</span> with Miriam Hopkins and Kay Francis (both 1932).<br>
<br>During the 1930s Marshall starred with many of Hollywood's leading actresses. &#145;He was urbane, soft-spoken and somewhat distant, but he let the ladies act rings round him&#151;except perhaps in comedy, where his skill added much to the sophistication of some of the screen's best pieces&#146;  (Shipman, 369&#150;70). Certainly his polish and assurance enabled him to appear well at ease in any setting of culture and gentility. Among the highlights were <span class="italic">Riptide</span> with Norma Shearer and <span class="italic">The Painted Veil</span> with Greta Garbo (both 1934), <span class="italic">If You Could Only Cook</span> with Jean Arthur, William Wyler's excellent <span class="italic">The Good Fairy</span> with Margaret Sullavan, and <span class="italic">The Dark Angel</span> with Merle Oberon (all 1935), <span class="italic">A Woman Rebels</span> with Katharine Hepburn (1936), <span class="italic">Breakfast for Two</span> with Barbara Stanwyck (1937), and <span class="italic">Mad about Music</span> with Deanna Durbin (1938). He also appeared back on the stage, in Santa Barbara, California, alongside Helen Hayes in <span class="italic">Ladies and Gentlemen</span> (1939). Marshall's second marriage, which had produced a daughter, later the actress Sarah Marshall, broke up in the mid-1930s, leading to divorce in 1940. In the same year he married Elizabeth Russell, known as Lee. They, too, had a daughter.<br>
<br>Marshall then enjoyed a brief purple patch, being in Hitchcock's splendid <span class="italic">Foreign Correspondent</span> and Wyler's remake of <span class="italic">The Letter</span>, although this time as the cuckolded husband (both 1940). He also appeared in William Wyler's film <span class="italic">The Little Foxes</span> from Lillian Hellman's play (1941), and played the narrator in the film adaptation of Somerset Maugham's <span class="italic">The Moon and Sixpence</span> (1942) but this was virtually his last leading role. Marshall's natural reserve, his mannered style, and his age were forcing him into character roles, although his charm and his cultured voice ensured that he remained busy. He was one of over eighty chiefly British stars of <span class="italic">Forever and a Day</span> (1943), appeared (for the first time on screen with a walking stick and a limp) in <span class="italic">The Enchanted Cottage</span> (1945), and also in the underrated <span class="italic">Crack-up</span> (1946). He was again cast as Somerset Maugham in a film version of that author's philosophical novel <span class="italic">The Razor's Edge</span>, and was in David O. Selznick's epic production, <span class="italic">Duel in the Sun</span> (both 1946). In an excellent film adaptation of <span class="italic">The Secret Garden</span> by Frances Hodgson Burnett he played the unfeeling guardian (1949). <span class="italic">The Underworld Story</span> was his first &#145;B&#146; film (1950). He also starred in the radio series <span class="italic">The Man called X</span> (1944&#150;52), hosted the television series <span class="italic">The Unexpected</span> (1952), and made a number of other television appearances through the 1950s. After a divorce from Lee Russell, in 1947 he married the actress Patricia Mallory (1913&#150;1958) (known professionally as Boots Mallory), with whom he had a third daughter. Better films in his final decade of film-making were <span class="italic">The Virgin Queen</span> as Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, opposite Bette Davis's Elizabeth (1955), <span class="italic">The Fly</span> and Sidney Lumet's <span class="italic">Stage Struck</span> (both 1958), <span class="italic">Midnight Lace</span> (1960), and John Huston's gimmicky <span class="italic">The List of Adrian Messenger</span> and <span class="italic">The Caretakers</span> (both 1963). His final film was <span class="italic">The Third Day</span> (1965). Marshall divorced Mallory (who died in 1958) and married again in 1960; his fifth wife was Dee Anne Kahmann. He died of a heart attack on 22 January 1966 in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California. His wife survived him.<br>
