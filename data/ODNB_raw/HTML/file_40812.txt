<span class="headword">Cazalet,  Edward</span>  (1827&#150;1883), <span class="occ">merchant and industrialist</span>, was born on 9 November 1827 at Brighton, the youngest of the seven children of Peter Clement Cazalet (1785&#150;1859), merchant and Russian consul, and his wife, Olympia (<i>d</i>. 1848). Of Huguenot extraction the Cazalets had established strong business connections in Russia in the late eighteenth century, and, after education in England, Edward Cazalet joined the family firm in St Petersburg in the mid-1840s. He became one of a closely knit group of English merchants who not only dominated the Baltic trade but increasingly invested in the domestic economy. The Cazalet firm, from its original base in silk weaving and rope manufacturing, grew under Edward's aegis to include a prosperous candle factory (with a monopoly contract for the imperial palaces), together with interests in the Neva Stearin Candle and Soap Factory, the Kalinkin brewery (one of Russia's largest), and a mineral water plant.<br>
<br>Following his father's death in 1859 and his own marriage on 15 March 1860 to Elizabeth Sutherland Marshall (<i>d</i>. 1888), daughter and heir of William Marshall, doctor and Danish consul at Edinburgh, Cazalet also joined William Miller &amp; Co., a shipping firm controlled by his wife's uncle, the Russian merchant and future Liberal MP William Miller (1809&#150;1887). Under Cazalet's guidance this firm exported herrings, coal, and Singer sewing machines from Scotland to Russia. Cazalet took a keen interest in working-class education in St Petersburg, and he also acted as treasurer of the Russia Company's &#145;English factory&#146; from 1864 to 1865. His profitable ventures enabled him to leave Russia in 1870, having transferred his business concerns to managers under whom they continued to provide the basis of the family's fortunes until confiscation in 1917.<br>
<br>Back in Britain, combining generosity and broad sympathies, Cazalet made his mark in a number of diverse ways. First, he acquired the 1500 acre Fairlawne estate in Kent of Joseph Ridgway, paying in 1872 some &pound;100,000 at the peak of nineteenth-century land prices. He not only transformed the house, gardens, and stables, but also the surrounding village of Shipbourne, raising much local discontent but leaving in its wake a new church, an inn, a modernized estate village, and improved schools. He also provided a building for the Plaxtol Working Men's Club and a ground for its cricket club at Fairlawne, and he was noted for his benevolence locally and nationally (contributing generously, for example, to Oxford's Indian Institute). Cazalet was soon accepted into county society; he acted as JP and deputy lieutenant for Kent, and in 1880 he contested (unsuccessfully) the mid-Kent seat for the Liberals. Untrammelled by local prejudices he supported the first channel tunnel scheme and provided &pound;10,000 to modernize part of Tonbridge (Judd's) School. Cazalet later acquired 4 Whitehall Gardens, London, the former home of Sir Robert Peel, and, reflecting his growing interest in agriculture, he became one of the proprietors of the <span class="italic">Mark Lane Express</span>.<br>
<br>Secondly, Cazalet's experience of international trade, and perhaps especially the problems of the volatile currency of the Russian empire, led him to become an early advocate in Britain of the bimetallic (gold and silver) standard. Bimetallism, he believed, would provide monetary stability in the world and also help to promote harmony among nations, such that monetary arrangements between the powers would achieve more than &#145;the most successful foreign war&#146;  (E. Cazalet, <span class="italic">Bimetallism and its Connection with Commerce</span>, 1879, 35). Following private discussions at Fairlawne, Cazalet chaired the first meeting of the International Monetary Standard Association at the India Office on 12 November 1881, and it was from this influential group that the Bimetallic League later emerged.<br>
<br>Thirdly, Cazalet became a leading advocate of the Euphrates Valley Railway, a long-running scheme to complete the shortest route from Turkey to India and one whose construction would benefit the trade and security of British India while providing a bulwark against Russian expansionism. It was also to make Britain independent of the Suez Canal. Cazalet also saw this proposal in two wider contexts, for against the backcloth of the re-emergence of the Eastern question he believed that Britain and a liberalizing Russia could become natural allies. The latter would be allowed to expand at the expense of the Ottoman empire, while Britain would take responsibility for Syria, a country &#145;which possesses peculiar attractions for the minds and sympathies of the English race&#146;  (E. Cazalet, <span class="italic">The Eastern Question: an Address to Working Men</span>, 1878, 39). Cazalet believed that such a redirection of interest would deflect Britain from further intervention in Egypt, which might safely be left to Italian trusteeship. But even more imaginatively Cazalet proposed that the oppressed Jews of Europe, especially from Russia and Romania, should be resettled on either side of the railway, providing them with a homeland but also promoting the regeneration of Syria&#151;a duty Britain had neglected since Palmerston's day. This scheme, like that of Laurence Oliphant, proved wholly visionary, but it acted as an important contribution to the projection of a Jewish homeland. Cazalet gained the interest of princes and working men, statesmen and diplomatists, notably that of Odo Russell, British ambassador at Berlin, where Cazalet canvassed his scheme in 1882. In partnership with Sir Thomas Selby Tancred (1840&#150;1910), the future contractor for the Forth Bridge and builder of the Delagoa Bay Railway, he continued enthusiastically to seek support, and it was on his way to further the scheme with the Ottoman Porte that he caught typhus and died at the H&ocirc;tel d'Angleterre, Constantinople, on 21 April 1883, survived by his wife. He was buried at St Giles's Church, Shipbourne, Kent, on 7 May 1883.<br>
<br>Cazalet left a substantial fortune in Britain as well as assets in Russia and Villa Liserb, near Nice, from which he had campaigned against the gaming houses of Monte Carlo. His only child, William Marshall (1865&#150;1932), was a talented real-tennis player (Cazalet had built a court at Fairlawne for the purpose). William was the father of Victor Cazalet (1896&#150;1943), Conservative MP and political liaison officer to General Sikorski, of Peter Cazalet (1907&#150;1973), the racehorse trainer, and of Thelma Cazalet-Keir (1899&#150;1989), feminist and Conservative MP.<br>
