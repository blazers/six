<span class="headword">Wilson,  John</span>  (1758&#150;1821), <span class="occ">printer and publisher</span>, was born at Kilmarnock on 26 March 1758, the second son of James Wilson and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bankhead. Little is known of his childhood or education, but he established a book- and stationery shop at Kilmarnock in one of the buildings where Portland Street opened into The Cross. About 1780 he acquired the wooden press, the first of its kind in the county, which had been imported by a Mr McArthur some thirty years previously, and set up a printing works in the attic of the tenement on the left of the Star Inn Close as entered from Waterloo Street. Most of the work done on this press was jobbing work, such as bills, tradesmen's cards, and letterheads; in 1785, Wilson brought out an edition of Milton's <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>.<br>
<br>Wilson is chiefly remembered, however, as the first publisher of the poems of Robert Burns, in an edition known as the <span class="roman">Kilmarnock Edition</span>. The subscription forms for the volume were printed by Wilson and were delivered to Burns on the evening of 14 September 1786. Burns had ninety-six copies of the notice printed, but only one example of this document has survived (Burns Museum, Alloway), and bears the signatures of sixteen subscribers. By advance subscription, Burns raised &pound;64 4<i>s</i>.&#151;more than enough to meet the costs of the paper, ink, and presswork, which totalled &pound;35 17<i>s</i>. Later, Burns claimed to have cleared &pound;20 from the sale of his poems, but as all 612 copies were soon sold out, his profit was substantially more.<br>
<br>By 13 July sufficient subscriptions had been promised for John Wilson to begin printing the book, although the typesetting must have been going on apace. The book, running to 240 pages, was printed, collated, and bound in blue paper wrappers ready for distribution by the end of that month. By the end of August, Wilson had only thirteen copies left. Of these, Burns kept three for his own use and the entire edition was sold out by September. On 6 October Burns settled the account with Wilson in full, and about two days later told Robert Aiken that he had offered Wilson a second edition, but that the printer had declined. Wilson estimated that the cost of 1000 copies would be &pound;27 for the paper and &pound;16 for the printing. He was prepared to go ahead if Burns put up the money for the paper, but the poet had already spent the profits from the first edition. It was Wilson's canniness which later compelled Burns to seek a national, rather than a local, publisher for his second edition, and without that, he might have been a mere nine-days wonder and Wilson himself would have long been forgotten.<br>
<br>John Wilson and his younger brother Peter moved to Ayr, where they founded the <span class="italic">Ayr Advertiser</span> in 1803. John Wilson prospered in the county town, and became a magistrate there. He died at Ayr on 6 May 1821, but his body was brought back to his native town and interred on 9 May in the burial-ground attached to the Old High Church, Kilmarnock. He was survived by his wife, who died at Kilmarnock in 1825.<br>
<br>Of the printery which first gave the works of Burns to the world nothing now remains, although a plaque in the Burns precinct of Kilmarnock town centre was erected in 1976 to mark the spot. The wooden press passed eventually into the hands of Thomas M. Gemmell, who carried on the printing business. About 1858, the press, which had long been pensioned off, was cannibalized to produce an elaborate chair in preparation for the Burns centenary celebrations in the following January. Richly carved with a bust of the poet and characters from his best-known works, it is now preserved in the Burns Museum at Alloway. A half-length seated portrait of Wilson in old age is preserved in the Dick Institute, Kilmarnock, while a life-sized bronze statue of Burns and Wilson by Alexander Stoddart was erected at The Cross in 1995.<br>
