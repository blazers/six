<span class="headword">Butler <span class="st"> [Boteler]</span>,  Nathaniel</span>  (<em>b. </em>1577, <em>d.</em> in or after 1643), <span class="occ">colonial governor and maritime author</span>, was the elder son of the second marriage of John Butler (<i>d</i>. 1614) of the Toft, in Sharnbrook, Bedfordshire, and Mary, daughter of James Gedge and widow of Christopher Harris. On John Butler's death the family's holdings in Sharnbrook passed to Butler's elder half-brother, Sir Oliver. Butler joined the Virginia Company, where he became a supporter of Robert Rich, second earl of Warwick. On 28 April 1619 he was elected, by 297 votes to three, governor of the Virginia Company's sister organization, the Bermuda Company. His elevation was the result of a bargain struck between Warwick and another leading Virginia Company member, Sir Edwin Sandys. Warwick helped Sandys to become the company's treasurer, and in return Sandys delivered the votes of his followers to Butler, who shortly afterwards was also appointed to the board of the Virginia Company (9 June 1619). Butler's governorship of Bermuda lasted three years, during which time he began work on his <span class="italic">Historye of the Bermudaes</span>. At his departure on 25 October 1622 he journeyed to Virginia, evidently on behalf of Warwick, who had now turned against Sandys. There Butler helped to lead an expedition of eighty men against local natives, but his main purpose in travelling to the colony was to gather evidence of its deteriorating condition and misgovernment. When he eventually returned to England, in 1623, Butler presented his findings to the privy council in a 900-word paper entitled &#145;The unmasked face of our colony as it was in the winter of the year 1622&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/526/98). His scathing criticisms, reinforced by additional findings gathered by Warwick, persuaded the king to establish a commission of inquiry into Virginia's government in May 1623.<br>
<br>Like Warwick, Butler was a Hispanophobe, and when in 1624 war with Spain was imminent he proposed that Bermuda should be used as a base from which to attack the Spanish West Indian fleets. His idea was not taken up but when hostilities began in 1625 he was appointed captain of an armed merchantman, in which capacity he participated in the ill-fated expedition to Cadiz. On 27 October the expedition's commander, Sir Edward Cecil, ordered him to organize the fleet's boats in preparation for the evacuation of the troops from Port Puntal. He returned to England by way of Ireland and on 27 June 1626 he was appointed captain of another armed merchantman in the fleet led by Robert Bertie, Lord Willoughby. The expedition sailed in October but was quickly abandoned after encountering severe storms in the Bay of Biscay. Shortly afterwards Butler wrote, but did not publish, a treatise entitled &#145;A discourse of the miscarriages of our two late expeditions, and the cares propounded for the future&#146;. Again he advocated using Bermuda as a springboard from which to intercept the Spanish West Indian fleets, and this time strongly hinted that he himself possessed the qualities needed to take charge of such a base. He also argued for the capture of Gibraltar, an idea which Cecil had considered and rejected in 1625. However, if Butler's views were brought to the notice of the government they were ignored. In the following year he commanded yet another merchantman, this time on the expedition to the &Icirc;le de R&eacute; when he lay off the western side of the island. His final naval service, between 10 June and 31 December 1628, was as captain of one of the king's own ships, during which time he participated in the earl of Lindsey's unsuccessful expedition to relieve the Huguenots of La Rochelle.<br>
<br>In 1634 Butler was invited by the head of the admiralty commission, Richard Weston, first earl of Portland, to apply for a captaincy in the forthcoming ship money fleet, but by the time he did so in March 1635 Portland had died and he had missed his opportunity. 1634 also saw Butler complete a series of six &#145;dialogues&#146;, of which two were based on his treatise of 1626/7. These took the form of an extended conversation between a fictional admiral and a captain on a wide range of maritime topics, including the naval expeditions of the 1620s. Butler did not regard this work as finished, however, and continued to revise it into the early 1640s. It is not known whether he continued to seek naval employment after 1635.<br>
<br>On 23 April 1638 Butler was appointed governor of Providence Island, a colony 110 miles off the east coast of Nicaragua. His former patron the earl of Warwick was a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95346', "Providence Island Company")</script>, of which Warwick's brother Henry Rich, earl of Holland, was governor. Providence Island was intended as a &#145;godly&#146; colony on a similar model to Massachusetts, but, to protect it against Spanish dominance in the Caribbean, required military and financial adventures that were often contrary to its religious aspirations. Butler's military experience was cited by the company at his appointment, as the company sought to defend those privateers who used the island as a base safe from the dominance of the Spanish fleet. Butler's appointment saw administrative powers over the militia and public works transferred from the council of the island to a new council of war, deviating from the usual custom in English colonies where both were controlled by civilians. He also brought new colonists with him to the island, probably with the intention that they would replace or dilute the influence of those colonists who were illegally appropriating company property. In May 1639 he began an expedition in the Caribbean, and on 6 June 1639 seized Trujillo, in Honduras, but the town was almost empty and offered few prizes. He sailed north to Cuba but his crews were largely ignorant of the Caribbean, and he was lucky to return to Providence by September. Meanwhile the island was riven by dissension over its administration and economic development; on 23 February 1640 Butler left the island to answer charges laid against him by his opponents among the colonists in the company's general court. After a hearing on 19&#150;20 June 1640 he was cleared of misconduct, but his claim to have ransomed Trujillo for 16,000 pieces of eight was dismissed. He disappears from the record thereafter, but evidence from one version of his <span class="italic">Dialogues</span> suggests that he was still living in 1643.<br>
<br>Butler may never have married. His place of settled residence in England has not been established, but his letter to Portland of March 1635 was written from Coventry. His <span class="italic">Dialogues</span> were not published until 1685, while his <span class="italic">Historye of the Bermudaes</span> did not appear in print until 1882. Boteler, the more archaic spelling of his surname, was adopted by his 1685 publisher, Moses Pitt; he himself spelt his name Butler.<br>
