<span class="headword">Rankley,  Alfred</span>  (1819&#150;1872), <span class="occ">genre painter</span>, was born on 30 December 1819 and baptized on 17 January 1820, with his twin brother William, at St Mary's Church, Marylebone, London. His parents were James Rankley and Jemima, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cooper, who later worked at Marylebone court house as a porter and housekeeper respectively. He attended the Royal Academy Schools and began to exhibit at the academy in 1841, when he sent a scene from Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>. Next year <span class="italic">Palamon and Lavinia</span> was exhibited at the Society of British Artists, and in 1844 a scene from <span class="italic">Othello</span> was shown at the academy. Rankley has been described as being &#145;caught up in the early Victorian craze for ambitious historical pieces&#146;  (Reynolds, 110). He was one of many artists who searched pre-Norman English history for episodes that could be used as vehicles for dramatic effect: his <span class="italic">Edith and the Monks Finding the Body of Harold</span> was exhibited at the Society of British Artists in 1846. In 1847 he sent <span class="italic">Cordelia</span> to the British Institution, and <span class="italic">The Village Church</span> to the Royal Academy, a painting that was well received and later engraved. From then until 1867 he exhibited regularly at the academy, generally sending a single work, and never more than two.<br>
<br>Rankley's contemporary subjects have proved more enduring than his historical ones. In <span class="italic">Contentment</span> (1850) he explored the effects of education on social class, through a painting of a young scholar &#145;ill at ease in his family's simple cottage&#146;, an early treatment of this subject  (Boase, 279). Among his best works were <span class="italic">Old Schoolfellows</span> (1854) and <span class="italic">The Doctor's Coming</span> (1864), the latter depicting a scene from a Gypsy encampment. <span class="italic">Old Schoolfellows</span> in particular shows to good effect the technical ability that Rankley acquired through his earlier works. The painting depicts a prosperous young man alleviating the penury of a schoolfriend, who lies on his sickbed; when shown at the Royal Academy the catalogue entry included a quotation from the book of <span class="roman">Proverbs</span>, chapter 17: &#145;A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity&#146;. Such sentimentalism was characteristic of Rankley's work and the painting displays &#145;that clarity of anecdote and simplicity of moral appeal which was the strength as well as the limitation of mid-Victorian subject painting&#146;  (Reynolds, 110).<br>
<br>Rankley's paintings&#151;&#145;conscientiously finished, and inculcating some healthful thought&#146;  (Redgrave)&#151;were popular, and among those engraved were <span class="italic">The Parish Beauty</span> and <span class="italic">The Pastor's Pet</span>, by Robert Mitchell; <span class="italic">Reading the Litany</span>, <span class="italic">Sunday Afternoon</span>, and <span class="italic">The Sunday School</span>, by James Scott; <span class="italic">Refreshment, Sir?</span> by W. H. Egleton; and <span class="italic">The Scoffers</span>, by H. T. Ryall. His last exhibited works were <span class="italic">Following the Trail</span> and <span class="italic">The Hearth of his Home</span> (1870), and <span class="italic">The Benediction</span> (1871). Rankley died, unmarried, at his home, Clifton Villa, Campden Hill, Kensington, London, on 7 December 1872, and was buried in the St Marylebone cemetery, East Finchley. His studio sale was held at Christies on 3 February 1873.<br>
