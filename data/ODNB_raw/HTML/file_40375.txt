<span class="headword">Tait,  Thomas Smith</span>  (1882&#150;1954), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in Paisley, Renfrewshire, on 18 June 1882, the son of John Tait, master stonemason, and his wife, Elizabeth Smith. Educated at John Neilson's Institution, Paisley, and apprenticed to a local architect, John Donald, in 1896, he acquired a reputation as a brilliant draughtsman at Paisley Technical School, which led to his engagement in 1903 by Sir John Burnet as his personal assistant. In the same year a scholarship took him to Glasgow School of Art, where he fell under the influence of the Beaux-Arts professor Eug&egrave;ne Bourdon. Tait won three king's prizes, and on Burnet's advice undertook a continental study tour before rejoining him at his newly formed London office in 1905. There Tait acquired a leading role, and had a considerable hand in the design of the Kodak Building, Kingsway, London (1901&#150;11), which developed ideas pioneered in American urban office buildings, particularly the Owen Building, Detroit, by Albert Kahn. Its austere pilastered elevations of metal-framed windows and spandrel panels set the pattern for much inter-war commercial building.<br>
<br>On 26 December 1910 Tait married Constance Winifred Blanche Hardy (<i>c</i>.1890&#150;1961), the daughter of Albert Hardy, a station inspector. The financial pressures of setting up house induced him to assist the rival practice of Trehearne and Norman outside office hours, designing for them the elevations of a number of large commercial blocks connected with the Kingsway&#150;Aldwych improvements of the London county council. These came to Burnet's notice, and caused serious differences with him late in 1913, compounding an earlier disagreement over a premiated but unauthorized entry (with James Mitchell Whitelaw) in an unofficial design competition for Regent Street. Tait sailed for New York early in 1914, leaving Constance and their son Gordon (1912&#150;1999) at home, and secured a place with the Beaux-Arts modernist Donn Barber designing banks. There, briefly, he met Frank Lloyd Wright, whose work made a lasting impression on him.<br>
<br>Burnet almost immediately regretted Tait's departure and offered him a partnership if he would return, but Tait declined and instead took up a salaried post as chief draughtsman to Trehearne and Norman. He designed for them Shell Corner (designed 1914&#150;15; completed 1919&#150;20) and Adastral House on Kingsway, London, but the remaining war years had to be spent as a draughtsman at Woolwich arsenal. After the armistice Burnet was appointed architect to the Imperial War Graves Commission for the Middle East. He invited Tait to rejoin him as a partner for the second time and on this occasion Tait accepted. Major London commissions flowed in, notably the completion of Selfridges in conjunction with the American firm of Graham, Anderson, Probst, and White (1919&#150;24), Vigo House, Regent Street, and the giant Adelaide House, London Bridge (both 1920&#150;25). Adelaide House was the largest office block then built in London and certainly the most American, with its mullioned fa&ccedil;ades and deep Egyptian cornice, a by-product of Tait's voyage to Egypt for the war memorial at Port Taufiq. The more conservative elevations with high-level Corinthian colonnades which Tait had also sketched for this project subsequently found expression at Lloyds Bank, Cornhill (1925&#150;7; with Campbell-Jones and Smithers), and the Thames-side landmark of Unilever House, Blackfriars (1929&#150;32; with J. Lomax-Simpson), the curved frontage of which forms a setting for heroic sculptures by William Reid Dick.<br>
<br>Burnet's role gradually diminished throughout the 1920s. Tait was first acknowledged as an independent designer in 1923 at the second church of Christ Scientist, Notting Hill Gate, London, brick Early Christian and still very Burnetian; the earliest really large building unmistakably from Tait's hand was the Egyptianized classical <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> building on Fleet Street, London, with stepped-back upper elevations to comply with the light regulations then required for tall buildings in City streets. More significant for the future was a fine and very early series of flat-roofed modernist houses for adventurous clients built from 1927 onwards; at Silver End village, Essex, for the window manufacturer W. F. Crittall, and at West Leaze, Aldbourne, Wiltshire, for Hugh Dalton. Associated with their design was Frederick MacManus (1903&#150;1985), a Dubliner who had joined the firm from New York in 1927.<br>
<br>Major changes in the firm took place in 1930, the year Burnet retired. Tait took into partnership Francis Lorne (1889&#150;1963), who had gained experience in the United States and Canada, in particular with the well-known New York architect Bertram Goodhue. He brought with him several other refugees from the Wall Street crash of 1929, most importantly his brother-in-law Gordon Farquhar, who had worked in New York for Raymond Hood. Lorne accelerated the changes Tait had already initiated, recruiting further staff with American (and in some cases Russian) experience, and reorganized the office on American lines. <span class="italic">The Information Book of Burnet Tait &amp; Lorne</span> (1933), the architect's bible for the rest of the decade, spread their influence far and wide.<br>
<br>Tait had introduced something approaching the international style of the 1930s at Bechstein Hall, Brook Street, London (1929&#150;30), but the transformation of the practice was nowhere more dramatically seen than at the Royal Masonic Hospital at Hammersmith (1930&#150;33), where a neo-Georgian competition-winning scheme was dramatically redesigned in the brick style of the Dutch modernist architect W. M. Dudok. Lorne gained an entr&eacute;e to the prince of Wales's circle and applied American job-getting techniques to the practice, securing the agreement of several adjoining properties to sell (sometimes without the others' knowledge), and then finding clients for the large site thus assembled. The major London works of those years were the big apartment blocks of Mount Royal, Oxford Street (1932), and Chelsea House, Lowndes Street (1934&#150;5), the Burlington School, Hammersmith (1932), the Curzon Cinema, Mayfair (1933), Steel House, Tothill Street (1936&#150;7), and the German Hospital, Dalston (1935&#150;8). In similar vein were St Dunstan's Convalescent Hospital, Brighton, Sussex, the Infectious Diseases Hospital, Paisley (also both 1935&#150;8), and Benenden Sanatorium, Kent (1937&#150;8).<br>
<br>These buildings broke new ground in Britain but, as in America, a more monumental style was reserved for great public projects. These began with Limpopo Bridge, South Africa, designed in 1927&#150;8. Further bridge commissions designed in consultation with civil engineers followed, notably at Bangkok, Kaar-el-Nil, Cairo, and Sydney Harbour (1932), the last being the finest of the series. At home Tait was selected to design the headquarters of the Scottish Office, St Andrew's House, Edinburgh (1934&#150;9), which was skilfully composed to answer the profile of Calton Hill rising behind it. Its &#145;sculpturesque&#146; style, with mullions rising into symbolic figures by William Reid Dick, had Dutch elements but was essentially American in composition. Equally monumental, but more austere, was the Anglo-American Corporation headquarters in Johannesburg (1935&#150;40), which was overseen by Lorne. A fine scheme for the Colonial Office, Westminster, remained on paper because of the Second World War.<br>
<br>Tait's most famous work was the Glasgow Empire Exhibition of 1938, for which he received the commission as late as October 1936. He developed a standardized system of construction, and recruited a team of like-minded architects, mostly from the Burnet&#150;Tait circle, to carry it out. Architecturally, if not financially, it was a success, making brilliant use of the hilltop site for water features, and with the whole being crowned by the gleaming landmark of Tait's Tower. Although the tower itself drew on ideas from Walter Gropius, the general concept developed themes invented by Raymond Hood for the &#145;Century of progress&#146; exhibition, Chicago (1929&#150;33), and, in certain respects, others from the Paris Exhibition of 1925, the Brussels Exhibition of 1934, and the Johannesburg Empire Exhibition of 1936.<br>
<br>Tait was offered a knighthood in 1938, but a breach of confidentiality that found its way from a bridge party to the gossip columns, and for which Tait was not responsible, resulted in its being withdrawn. Despite the importance of his wartime career as director of standardization at the Ministry of Works, 1940&#150;42, no further honour came his way. Such things did not matter to him very much. Although robust in his opinions at times, he was rather shy of publicity, and took little interest in the affairs of the Royal Institute of British Architects beyond its golf club. Essentially he was a workaholic, happiest at the drawing-board in a haze of cigarette smoke. Although he lived in considerable style at Gate House, Wyldes Close, Hampstead, for which he designed spectacular art deco interiors and furniture in 1928, only late in life did he own a car, and then it was for Constance rather than himself. Tait went into semi-retirement in 1952 and died at his country house, Scotrea, Strathtay, on 18 July 1954. He was cremated at Golders Green, Middlesex, on 23 July. Of his three sons, Gordon continued the practice and Kenneth became an architectural photographer and set designer.<br>
