<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Addison,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1735&#150;1736), <span class="occ">translator</span>, evidently received a good education, though nothing is known about his family or his life other than the fact that he published in London two books of translation from the classics. The first, <span class="italic">The works of Anacreon translated into English verse, with notes explanatory and poetical, to which are added the odes, fragments, and epigrams of Sappho, with the original Greek plac'd opposite to the translation</span> (1735), was advertised in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> without the translator's name, but with the comment that it included &#145;the Heads of Anacreon and Sapho curiously engrav'd&#146;. Addison lists the contents in both Greek and English; he also gives a &#145;Life of Anacreon&#146; and a &#145;Life of Sappho&#146;, both in English. The engraving of Sappho is described as &#145;taken from a Busto in the Possession of the Earl of Pembroke at Wilton House&#146;.<br>
<br>In his preface Addison reviews several earlier English versions of Anacreon's poems, but, while praising those of Cowley and Pilkington, he concludes: &#145;I know of none that can so properly be call'd a Translation as those which Mr. Stanley publish'd, whose Writings are an Honour to his Country&#146;. Addison himself translates into couplets and heavily annotates every page. Ode 11, titled &#145;On Himself&#146;, is a typical example of his verse:<blockquote>
<div>I'm often by the Women told,<br>
</div>
<div>Alas! Anacreon, thou growst old:<br>
</div>
<div>Here, in this glass thyself survey,<br>
</div>
<div>Fall'n is thy Hair, quite fall'n away!<br>
</div>
<div>No Ringlets wanton o'er thy Brow,<br>
</div>
<div>It's all a Field of Baldness now.<br>
</div>
<div> 
<br>
</div>
<div>But whether still soft-curls my Hair,<br>
</div>
<div>Or, flying hence, has left me bare,<br>
</div>
<div>I know not; this indeed I know,<br>
</div>
<div>If, as they tell me, old I grow,<br>
</div>
<div>It's time to snatch short Joys from Fate,<br>
</div>
<div>And haste to live ere it's too late.<br>
</div> (p. 49)</blockquote>Near the end of the following century A. H. Bullen comments in his introduction to an edition of <span class="italic">Anacreon</span>: &#145;In the eighteenth century, the translations of John Addison, Thomas Fawkes, etc. were highly esteemed, but it must be confessed that they are dull, uninspired, mechanical performances&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anacreon</span>, xiii&#150;xiv). From Sappho, Addison gives the odes &#145;An Hymn to Venus&#146; and &#145;On a young maid whom she lov'd&#146;, in addition to fragments and epigrams.<br>
<br>Addison next published <span class="italic">The works of Petronius Arbiter in prose and verse, translated from the original Latin, &hellip; to which are prefix'd the life of Petronius, done from the Latin, and a character of his writings by Monsieur St. Evremont</span> (1736). This work is heavily annotated in English, and it includes &#145;A key to the principal characters&#146;. Justifying his interest in Petronius, Addison states in a preface: &#145;There is no Part of Nature, no Profession, which Petronius does not admirably paint; He is a Poet, an Orator, and a Philosopher, at his Pleasure.&#146; A title-page illustration, from an engraving by Gerard Vandergucht (1698&#150;1777), depicts a writer about to record the story of Rome's fall, as a satyr points toward the flames engulfing the distant city. This is accompanied by the following epigraph:<blockquote>
<div>When gay Petronius, to correct the Age,<br>
</div>
<div>Gave way of old to his Satirick Rage,<br>
</div>
<div>With just Resentment fir'd, he meant to shew<br>
</div>
<div>How far Licentiousness at last might go:<br>
</div>
<div>Blushing we read the loose, the flagrant Tale,<br>
</div>
<div>And loath the Vice thus shewn without a Veil.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>
