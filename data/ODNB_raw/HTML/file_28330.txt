<span class="headword">Garrick <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Veigel]</span>,  Eva Maria</span> <span class="st"> [<em>performing name </em>Violette]</span>  (1724&#150;1822), <span class="occ">dancer</span>, is best-known as the wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10408/', "David Garrick (1717&#150;1779)")</script>, whom she married on 22 June 1749. She was born into a Roman Catholic family in Vienna, the daughter of Johann Veigel, a former valet, and his wife, Eva Maria Rosina, on 29 February 1724. She became the favoured pupil of the dancing-master Franz Hilverding. At the age of ten she danced the part of Psyche in Hilverding's ballet <span class="italic">Amour and Psyche</span>, and her talent and delicate manners brought her frequent invitations to entertain the Austrian aristocracy. It was rumoured that the empress Maria Theresa, jealous of the emperor's interest in the graceful young dancer, encouraged her to leave Vienna. In 1746, under her stage name, Violette, she contracted to dance with the Italian Opera Company at London's King's Theatre, and was at once the talk of the town.<br>
<br>Violette's passage into London society was eased by the patronage of the earl and countess of Burlington, at whose artistically buzzing house in Piccadilly she lodged until her marriage to Garrick. The couple met socially, probably in 1747 when London society was pressing invitations on the city's two most celebrated performers, and they were mutually attracted, but the match was initially opposed by the countess of Burlington, who may have heard rumours of Garrick's earlier liaisons and who had higher aspirations for her prot&eacute;g&eacute;e. In 1746&#150;7, while Violette was dancing at Drury Lane, Garrick was at Covent Garden, and in the following season, when Garrick began his long association with Drury Lane, she was at Covent Garden. The marriage settlement, when it was reached, was a virtual guarantee of prosperity for Violette. Not only did she receive &pound;10,000 from Garrick, together with &pound;70 per year, but also the annual interest on Lady Burlington's estates in Lincolnshire. There followed thirty years of contented marriage and forty-three of dignified widowhood. Eva Maria was Garrick's constant companion at home and abroad, his supporter and adviser in theatrical affairs, a gracious hostess on social occasions, and a welcome guest in the grand houses the couple visited. Garrick's social aggrandizement is inconceivable without her. Her taste and intelligence are discernible in the books and paintings they bought, in the way they furnished their houses, and between the lines of Garrick's voluminous correspondence. The Garricks were childless, but there was maternal generosity in Eva Maria's quiet care for Garrick's difficult prot&eacute;g&eacute;, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64326/', "Samuel Cautherley")</script>, and in her relationship with the children of Garrick's brother George. She was less at ease with her own siblings and with her widowed mother, all of whom were tempted to take advantage of her. Fluent in French and Italian, she spoke English with a trace of an Austrian accent, and wrote it stiltedly.<br>
<br>After Garrick's death in 1779, Eva Maria maintained their house in Adelphi Terrace and the large house and estate in Hampton that was her summer resort. Perhaps to save her from exploitation by her family, Garrick had stipulated in his will that she would forfeit the greater part of his legacy if she ceased to live in England, but there is no evidence that she wished to do so. Widowhood gave her time to develop her interest in mesmerism and alchemy. She continued to purchase books and to worship according to the forms of Roman Catholicism. After refusing two proposals from the extraordinary Lord Monboddo in 1782, she settled into a semi-reclusive way of life, happiest with friends and acquaintances when speaking of her dead husband or displaying mementoes of their time together. She died suddenly, on 16 October 1822 and in her ninety-ninth year, in the Adelphi Terrace house, and was buried beside her husband in Westminster Abbey nine days later. Of a multiplicity of detailed bequests in her will, many were to charities.<br>
