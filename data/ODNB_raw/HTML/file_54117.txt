<span class="headword">Ames,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1664?, <em>d.</em> 1692), <span class="occ">satirist</span>, was born of &#145;Plebean Extraction&#146;  (Ames, <span class="italic">Last Search</span>, sig. A2<i>v</i>); he can probably be identified with a &#145;Richardus Emms&#146;, son of Richard and Maria, baptized in St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, on 5 January 1664. He was apprenticed to a tailor in 1678. John Dunton the bookseller describes him as &#145;Mr <i>Ames</i>, originally a <i>Coat-seller; but had always some Yammerings upon him after Learning</i> and <i>the Muses</i>&#146;  (Dunton, 247). Both of his parents were dead before 1683, the date of a letter in which he expresses his dissatisfaction with his humble status as a &#145;Mechanick&#146; and his love of learning:<blockquote>I &hellip; had rather have the possession of a Library, than be master of both the Indies &hellip; The current of my Inclinations never were, nor ever will be to a Trade, Business and my self being Antipodes &hellip; my thoughts are engaged in other affairs, which hath so great an influence over my actions, that I often doe things diametrically opposite to the commands I receive. (Ames, &#145;Letter on education&#146;)</blockquote>Ames's elegy on Richard Baxter, praising Baxter's &#145;Heavenly Piety&#146; and efficacy as &#145;kind Physician of the sickly Soul&#146;  (Ames, <span class="italic">An Elegy on the Death of &hellip; Mr. Richard Baxter</span>, 1693), suggests that Ames was a dissenter; elsewhere he strongly attacks clergy who claim that &#145;none were to be Saved out of the Pale of the Church of England&#146;  (Ames, <span class="italic">Jacobite Conventicle</span>, sig. A2<i>r</i>). Several of his works are strongly anti-French and anti-Jacobite. His best-known poem, <span class="italic">Sylvia's Revenge, or, A Satyr Against Man</span> (1688), an answer to Robert Gould's violent misogynist satire <span class="italic">Love Given O're</span> (1683), went through twelve editions. Its sequel, <span class="italic">Sylvia's Complaint</span> (1692), similarly assumes a female persona defending &#145;her Injur'd Sex&#146; against unjust allegations and criticizing the &#145;unbounded <i>Arbitrary Power</i>&#146; husbands exercise over their wives  (R. Ames, <span class="italic">Sylvia's Complaint</span>, 1692, sig. A2<i>r</i>, 14). Ames also wrote several poems arguing a contrary position, including <span class="italic">The Female Fire-Ships: a Satyr Against Whoring</span> (1691) and <span class="italic">The Folly of Love: a New Satyr Against Women</span> (1691). Dunton's claim that &#145;you might engage him upon what Project you pleas'd, if you'd but conceal him&#146;  (Dunton, 247) is borne out by Ames's authorship of <span class="italic">The Pleasures of Love and Marriage</span> (1691), an answer to his own poem <span class="italic">The Folly of Love</span>.<br>
<br>As well as these satires in heroic couplets, Ames is the author of a number of comic poems in anapests on the general theme of drinking and conviviality, whose common theme is the declining quality of the claret served in London taverns: <span class="italic">The Search after Claret</span> (1691), <span class="italic">A Farther Search after Claret</span> (1691), <span class="italic">The Last Search after Claret</span> (1691), and the posthumously published <span class="italic">The Bacchanalian Sessions</span> (1693), the last of which contains a prefatory poem &#145;To the Memory of Mr Richard Ames&#146;. Two late poems, though largely conventional, can be seen to some extent as palinodes: <span class="italic">Fatal Friendship, or, The Drunkard's Misery</span> (1693), advertised as &#145;by a young Gentleman, a little before his Death; who lately fell an unhappy Sacrifice to the Bottle&#146;, and <span class="italic">The Rake, or, The Libertine's Religion</span> (1693), presenting its &#145;late <i>Author</i>&#146; as a penitent. Dunton writes:<blockquote>
<i>Wine and Women</i> were the great Bane of his Life and Happiness &hellip; a little before his Decease, he said to me, with a Deal of Concern: <i>Ah</i> Mr. <i>Dunton</i><i>! with what another Face does the World appear, now that I have Death in View</i>. (Dunton, 247)</blockquote>Ames died &#145;in a hospital&#146; in London, some time before 25 October 1692.<br>
<br>Though he is listed in the British Library catalogue as &#145;Richard Ames of Lincoln's Inn&#146;, there is no reliable evidence linking him to the inns of court; his name does not appear in the register of admissions to Lincoln's Inn, and the attribution on the title-page of <span class="italic">Lawyerus bootatus &amp; spurratus, or, The Long Vacation</span> (1691) to &#145;a Student of Lincolns-Inn&#146; simply reflects the persona used in the poem, suitable for a satire on attorneys whose only concern is the size of the fees they receive. There is a useful essay by Hugh Amory on the canon of Ames's writings, which draws on extensive lists of &#145;Books written by the Author&#146; in <span class="italic">The Bacchanalian Sessions</span> and <span class="italic">The Folly of Love</span>.<br>
