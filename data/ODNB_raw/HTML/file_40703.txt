<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hulme,  Thomas Ernest</span>  (1883&#150;1917), <span class="occ">philosopher and poet</span>, was born on 16 September 1883 at Gratton, Horton, Staffordshire, the eldest of two sons and one daughter of Thomas Hulme (1853&#150;1933), a gentleman farmer who later went into the ceramic transfer business, and his wife, Mary Young. He attended Newcastle High School for Boys (1894&#150;1902), where he won many of the school's mathematics and science prizes and was elected &#145;whip&#146; of the debating society. Admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, on an open mathematics exhibition in 1902, he became rebellious and was sent down two years later for idleness and a surfeit of pranks. The mock funeral organized by his friends in farewell was so large and rowdy that news of it reached <span class="italic">The Tatler</span> in London (1904). He enrolled at University College, London, but left in 1906 without a degree and set sail for a stay of several months in Canada, where he began jotting down his thoughts on the nature of truth, knowledge, the world, and language. Published after his death, these notes, known as &#145;Cinders&#146;, together present a nominalistic view of the world as a plurality which no single theory can comprehend. In the spring of 1907 he returned to England, but soon crossed to Brussels where he taught English for a year and worked on his &#145;Notes on language and style&#146;. A collection of jottings like &#145;Cinders&#146;, they present a similar view of the world: all theories are toys, language is not equivalent to reality, a writer's beliefs reflect his prejudices rather than universal truth&#151;though in &#145;Notes&#146; these themes are applied to language and style.<br>
<br>When Hulme returned home to London in 1908, he joined a group of enthusiasts known as the Poets' Club and soon was calling for a new beginning in English poetry; he wanted an &#145;impressionistic&#146; verse not bound by the old rules of metre. Early in 1909 he formed his own group of like-minded poets, which included F. S. Flint and the young American Ezra Pound, who acknowledged his debt to Hulme when he launched his imagist movement and published Hulme's &#145;Complete Poetical Works&#146; (five short, gem-like poems) as an appendix to his own book <span class="italic">Ripostes</span> (1912).<br>
<br>In mid-1909 the second period of Hulme's intellectual life began with a more serious study of philosophy. Convinced that Henri Bergson provided a way out of the nightmare of nineteenth-century materialism and mechanism, he began a three-year stint of writing and lecturing about Bergson. He also translated into English Bergson's <span class="italic">Introduction &agrave; la m&eacute;taphysique</span> (1912).<br>
<br>But even as Hulme was busy explaining and defending Bergson, he became interested (1911) in political theory. Hulme described himself as a tory, but he was not much interested in day-to-day politics. Instead, he began to write about the philosophical issues: the nature of man, the idea of progress, the difference between theory and practice, and the emotional and non-rational character of political belief. He pointed to Georges Sorel and to the group of contemporary French writers known as <span class="italic">L'Action fran&ccedil;aise</span>. What he liked was their opposition to &#145;romanticism&#146;; and in 1911, on his way to or from the Fourth International Philosophical Congress in Bologna, which he covered for the magazine <span class="italic">Nature</span> and the London weekly the <span class="italic">New Age</span>, he met Pierre Lasserre, a leading member of <span class="italic">L'Action fran&ccedil;aise</span>, who endeavoured to prove to him that Bergson was nothing but &#145;the last disguise of romanticism&#146;, and that, if applied to politics, Bergson's theory of real time would mean a continual progress for mankind&#151;an idea Hulme opposed.<br>
<br>Unable to reconcile his own political beliefs with Bergson's philosophy, Hulme ceased writing about Bergson in 1912 and began to work out his own philosophical position, which drew a sharp distinction between two ways of regarding the nature of man, namely the &#145;romantic&#146; and the &#145;classical&#146;. In <span class="italic">A Tory Philosophy</span> (1912) he described the classical as based on a belief that man is by nature limited and incapable of attaining any kind of perfection. Only through discipline could he achieve anything of value. The romantic view, Hulme said, was the opposite: it asserted man was naturally good and that whatever he accomplished was by the breaking of rules. One or other of these two attitudes lay, Hulme maintained, behind opinions on every subject, from politics to art. The romantic and classical temperaments as reflected in poetry is the subject of what is probably his best-known work, the 1912 lecture &#145;Romanticism and classicism&#146;  (first published posthumously in <span class="italic">Speculations</span>, 1924). Readmitted to Cambridge in the spring of 1912, owing largely to a letter from Bergson, Hulme fled to Germany that summer to avoid prosecution by an enraged don whose sixteen-year-old daughter had received letters from Hulme while she was at school at Roedean. During his German trip (1912&#150;13) he became interested in the visual arts through the work of the art theorist Wilhelm Worringer. Hulme came to think of the avant-garde art of pre-war England as heralding the breakup of the humanistic attitude which, taking man as the centre of all things, had dominated thinking since the Renaissance. Thus he began to publicize the work of such contemporary artists as Jacob Epstein (who sculpted Hulme) and David Bomberg, whose hard-edged style seemed to point to a classical renewal. He also translated into English Sorel's <span class="italic">R&eacute;flexions sur la violence</span> (1914).<br>
<br>When war broke out in August 1914 Hulme enlisted in the army as a private and in December was sent to the western front. In April 1915 he was sent home wounded and did not return to the fighting until March 1916 when, through the help of Sir Edward Marsh, he was granted a commission as temporary second lieutenant in the Royal Marine Artillery. While at home he published a long series of &#145;War notes&#146;, some of which revolved round his opposition to the pacifists of the day, including Bertrand Russell, with whom he debated in the <span class="italic">Cambridge Magazine</span>. He also wrote what would be his final and most important pages, called simply &#145;A notebook&#146; when published in the <span class="italic">New Age</span> in 1915&#150;16 (posthumously retitled &#145;Humanism and the religious attitude&#146; in 1924). Here he synthesized what he had thought his way through during the past decade: ideas on discontinuity and &#145;cinders&#146;; his theory that beliefs and convictions are based on unconscious assumptions about the world; the difference between the romantic and classical views of man; and most important, perhaps, his belief in the existence of original sin. Though closely related to views he had expressed earlier on romanticism and classicism, he now went further. The realization that there is nothing wonderful in man was, he said, a necessary preparation for the religious attitude, but, by itself, led only to a rejection of romanticism and the adoption of the classical attitude. The religious attitude required further that one recognize a separation between the material world and the world of ethics and religion. Perfection belonged only to the divine and could not be legitimately introduced on the human plane. All philosophies since the Renaissance shared a &#145;family resemblance&#146; in that they failed to see the chasm between the organic world and the worlds of ethics and religious values. Hulme claimed they all accepted an unconscious humanism, in which man was viewed as naturally good, a reservoir of possibility. He himself believed &#145;the religious conception of ultimate values to be right, the humanist wrong&#146;. And he predicted that the religious attitude, which had prevailed in the Egyptian and Byzantine empires and during the middle ages in western Europe, would come back in some form to replace the humanistic attitude of his own day.<br>
<br>Hulme was a large man, with an open, genial face. From 1911 until the war he presided over a weekly salon which nearly everyone in London who was connected with the arts seems at one time or another to have attended. He was remembered as a brilliant Johnsonian talker, with a ranging curiosity and dominating personality which drew out the opinions of others and stimulated debate. Though he was known for his energetic pursuit of young women and had long friendships with Ethel Kibblewhite and artist Kate Lechmere (1887&#150;1976), he never married. He was killed in action near Nieuport in Flanders on 26 September 1917 and was buried in Koksijde military cemetery in Belgium. He published no book of his own during his lifetime; nor did his writings become the basis for any philosophical school. Despite this, he held a small but definite place in twentieth-century intellectual life and letters, particularly as forerunner in the movement towards a &#145;new classicism&#146;. Such diverse thinkers as Ramiro de Maeztu, I. A. Richards, V. A. Demant, J. G. Crowther, and Iris Murdoch all commented on his importance. T. S. Eliot, in <span class="italic">Criterion</span>, went so far as to describe him as &#145;the forerunner of a new attitude of mind, which should be the twentieth-century mind, if the twentieth century is to have a mind of its own&#146;.<br>
