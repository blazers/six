<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Forwood, Sir  Arthur Bower</span>, first baronet  (1836&#150;1898), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 23 June 1836 at Edge Hill, Liverpool, the eldest of the four sons of Thomas Brittain Forwood (1810&#150;1884), shipbroker, and his wife, Charlotte (1814&#150;1861), daughter of William Bower, cotton broker. His paternal grandfather, George, the son of a royal naval lieutenant from Plymouth who was killed in action, was the first to establish the Forwoods in Liverpool, and in 1812 was a partner in the Otterspool oil works. Arthur's father joined Leech, Harrison &amp; Co. (founded in 1785), commission merchants, at the age of fourteen and became a partner in 1837. During Forwood's childhood, the family moved home several times, to Marsh Lane, Bootle, and to Crosby Road, Seaforth, both then sylvan suburbs commanding marine views, to escape the spreading city. Based on the port's prosperity, Liverpool grew in population from 210,000 in 1831 to 685,000 in 1901. This made it the second city in Britain after London in size, &#145;the second city of the Empire&#146;, Liverpudlians boasted. One of Arthur Forwood's political designs was to register that weight in national affairs.<br>
<br>Absorption in business precluded Forwood's forebears from much involvement in public life, though his grandfather published pamphlets on economic and social questions, and his father was active in the chamber of commerce and on the Mersey Docks Board. When he retired from business and bought Thornton Manor, Cheshire, Thomas Forwood became a county magistrate and chairman of the building restoration committee of Chester Cathedral. Arthur, locally schooled at Liverpool Collegiate, started work in his father's firm, as did his three brothers after him. One, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47004/', "William Forwood")</script> (1840&#150;1928; knighted 1883), wrote that their father refused to send them to Oxbridge, arguing that &#145;a university training would spoil&#146; them for business. In 1862 Arthur and William bought out their father and took over the management. Already, Arthur Forwood demonstrated in business that hard-headedness and perspicacity which later were hallmarks of his politics. Visiting America in 1861, he was sure that civil war was coming. He backed his judgement by buying cotton heavily, on which the firm made substantial profits. He also moved Leech, Harrison, and Forwood into steamship ownership, trading to the West Indies, so successfully that he forced their competitors to amalgamate with them in a new company, the West Indian and Pacific Company. Forwood managed this company for nine years, before turning to politics. He had not done with business, however: the premium the Forwoods received for surrendering their interest in the West Indian and Pacific Company enabled them to found the Atlas Company, running steamers between New York and the West Indies; and Arthur gave time to this even as his political interests expanded.<br>
<br>Forwood joined Liverpool's municipal council in 1871. He served as councillor or alderman for twenty-seven years, and was mayor in 1878&#150;9. He was secretary of the Constitutional Association from 1868 and chairman from 1880, in effect head of the Liverpool conservative caucus. The decisive year was 1875 when Irish nationalism first seriously disturbed municipal politics, leading to the election ten years later as MP for Liverpool Scotland of the only Irish nationalist ever to win a parliamentary seat on the British mainland, T. P. O'Connor. Forwood marshalled the non-Catholic Irish electors to resist the subordination of Liverpool interests to Irish separatism. Constitutionally, Forwood was orthodox, a resolute champion of the union and empire, monarchy and church, Lords and Commons; but he was alarmed that Conservative leaders nationally were too faint-hearted or stuck up to promote this creed in urban centres and to invest traditional institutions with a democratic seal. Forwood also encountered timidity in the Liverpool merchant plutocracy. He won support for the establishment of an episcopal see (1880) and University College (1881); but the merchants were unnerved by his advocacy of universal household suffrage and redistribution of seats, temperance reform and comprehensive employers' liability legislation, old age pensions and adventures in municipalization, including council housing as well as public utilities and transport. Forwood broadcast his ideas in a pamphlet in 1883 on housing the working classes, and in articles in the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> (1883&#150;4) on democratic toryism and single-member constituencies. He encouraged popular political organization in the Liverpool Working Men's Conservative Association, the largest such body in the country; moreover, he courted the Orange order and abetted campaigns to enforce church discipline against ritualism. His ambition of representing Liverpool in parliament was dashed in 1882 in a by-election defeat when his candidature was undermined from within the Conservative establishment. Undaunted, he spearheaded the assertion of urban Conservative leaders in the national union in 1884&#150;5 and, though disappointed by Lord Randolph Churchill's errancy, he won the mind of Lord Salisbury during the franchise crisis, whose settlement emerged on lines he advised.<br>
<br>At the general election held under the new arrangements in December 1885, Forwood was returned for Ormskirk: wisely, he did not divide his supremacy in Liverpool by representing one of its constituencies. Salisbury appointed him financial secretary to the Admiralty, a post he held from 1886 to 1892, during a period of agitation for fleet re-equipment. Forwood was the first shipowner to become an Admiralty minister and, in 1892, the first serving town councillor to become a privy councillor. His superior at the Admiralty, Lord George Hamilton, reckoned Forwood a &#145;hustler&#146;, with &#145;a rare driving power as an administrator and reformer, but not the knack of making himself popular&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parliamentary Reminiscences and Reflections, 1886&#150;1906</span>, 1922, 35). The sense of a man who had risen above his proper station was apparently confirmed when, in a slip during a parliamentary debate, Forwood called the speaker &#145;Mr Mayor&#146;. When the Conservatives resumed office in 1895, Forwood was denied preferment and scarcely mollified by a baronetcy (5 September 1895). He was rich&#151;at his death, his effects were probated at &pound;87,321 19<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>.&#151;and his heir, Dudley (1875&#150;1961), was educated at Harrow School. Though no man below cabinet rank did more to promote tory democracy in the country than Forwood, his unvarnished manner was as unappealing to the aristocratic &eacute;lite who dominated the Conservative Party as it was to his party opponents in Liverpool who likened his rule to the ruthlessness of an American city boss. The Liberal leader, the merchant shipowner, Sir Robert Holt, wrote that &#145;he is certainly short of the instincts of a Gentleman and carries his political bias too far so as to be unjust to others&#146;  (Waller, 153). Holt acknowledged Forwood's effectiveness, however: &#145;What he decided to do he worked at till he did it&#146;  (ibid., 166). The foundations he laid, of a popular Conservatism pursuing both progressive and protestant causes, were tended by his immediate successors, Sir Archibald Salvidge and Sir Thomas White, and sustained the Conservative ascendancy in Liverpool until 1955. Forwood's political creed and style created acrimony but did not break down the interconnection of the provincial &eacute;lite. He himself twice married into Liberal families, marrying first on 26 October 1858 Lucy, daughter of Simon Crosfield, who died aged thirty-six from jaundice on 5 November 1873, and second on 1 September 1874 Mary Anne Eliza (Lizzie), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1096/', "Thomas Baines")</script>, who survived him. Forwood died at his home, The Priory, Gateacre, on 27 September 1898, from colitis leading to heart failure.<br>
