<span class="headword">Finlay,  Kirkman</span>  (<em>supp. </em><em>c.</em>1802&#150;1828), <span class="occ">supposed philhellene</span>, was shot through the head while rallying his men against a sortie of Turks from the fortress of Chios in the Aegean Sea on 29 January 1828, according to his obituary  (<span class="italic">GM</span>); at the time of his death he was said to be &#145;about twenty-six&#146;. He was said to have been the son of Captain-Lieutenant John Finlay RE, who died at Glasgow in 1802, and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9464/', "George Finlay")</script>, and nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9467/', "Provost Kirkman Finlay")</script>. He was stated to have gone to Greece to fight in the war of independence, making the acquaintance of Lord Byron, at whose request he had been one of the leaders of an expedition in March 1824 to transport military stores from Missolonghi in support of the rebel chief Odysseus's campaign in the Negropont. Crossing the swollen Phidari River, Finlay was reported to have lost the most valuable part of his baggage and papers, and very nearly his life  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>There is strong negative evidence that this Kirkman Finlay never existed. He has been confused with other members of his family, possibly with his well-known &#145;uncle&#146;, who had agents operating in Greece in the 1820s, and certainly with his &#145;brother&#146;, whose birth, and career in Greece, are well documented, and who did lose his papers in the skirmish at the Phidari. There is doubt also over the attack in Chios in which he was said to have been killed. Z. D. Ferriman carefully examined all the evidence for Kirkman Finlay's career in Greece and found it wanting or confused with that of George Finlay. Kirkman Finlay, he concluded, &#145;had nothing to do with affairs at Missolonghi&#146;. Ferriman raised serious doubts over his reality, though he scrupulously refrained from dismissing Finlay altogether in case further evidence survived  (Ferriman, 65&#150;6). None has been found. The most conclusive evidence against his existence comes from the extensive family papers, accounts, and genealogies, which contain no record of a younger Kirkman. George Finlay, who recalled spending his youth with his cousins at the home of his uncle, Provost Kirkman Finlay, made no mention of a brother. Perhaps, unless new evidence is found, more reliable than the obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> of April 1828 which called him into being, &#145;the second quite imaginary Kirkman Finlay of the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> &#147;who was neither killed in Greece nor born anywhere&#148;&#146; can be safely buried  (Fay, 371).<br>
