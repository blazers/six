<span class="headword">Walsh,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1662, <em>d.</em> 1708), <span class="occ">poet</span>, baptized at Abberley, Worcestershire, on 6 October 1662, was the second of eight children (two boys, six girls) born to Joseph Walsh (1618/19&#150;1682) of Abberley, and Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1637, <i>d</i>. 1719), daughter of Sir Bryan Palmes of Lindley, Yorkshire. Both Joseph and his father-in-law were of old county families and fought in the civil war on the royalist side. William Walsh became a gentleman-commoner of Wadham College, Oxford, on 14 May 1678 and a student of the Middle Temple on 6 December 1679. He did not take a degree, but, after the death of his father in 1682, divided his time between the pursuits of a country gentleman at Abberley and those of a conspicuously well-dressed, amorous beau in London. It was said, perhaps with exaggeration, that his wig cost &pound;80 and required more than 3 pounds of powder.<br>
<br>Walsh joined the wits at Will's Coffee House in Covent Garden, presided over by Dryden, who corrected his verse and wrote a eulogistic preface to his prose <span class="italic">Dialogue Concerning Women, being a Defence of the Sex</span> (1691), which, despite its subtitle, is as much an attack as a defence. The <span class="italic">Dialogue</span> was addressed to &#145;Eugenia&#146;, believed to be the countess of Kingston, one of Walsh's mistresses. His next publication was <span class="italic">Letters and Poems, Amorous and Gallant</span> (1692, reprinted in <span class="italic">Dryden's Miscellany</span>, pt 4, 1716), a collection of light and pretty love poems, pastorals, epigrams, and prose love letters, with a shrewd and amusing preface. Even so, Dryden's often-quoted judgement in the postscript to his translation of Virgil (1697) that Walsh was &#145;without flattery, the best Critick of our Nation&#146; was probably based more upon conversation, letters, and unpublished writings than upon this brief preface.<br>
<br>A few more poems found their way into print during Walsh's lifetime: he mourned Queen Mary in an elegy (1695), he praised William III in an imitation of Horace, <span class="italic">Odes</span>, iii.3 (1706), and he celebrated the victory at Ramillies in a thanksgiving ode (1706). He probably wrote <span class="italic">The Confederates</span>, a lampoon on Peter Anthony Motteux, published in <span class="italic">Poems on Affairs of State</span> (vol. 2, 1703), and he contributed to <span class="italic">Commendatory Verses</span> (1700) a collective satire on Sir Richard Blackmore. In another collective work Walsh wrote the third act of <span class="italic">Squire Trelooby</span>, a comedy adapted from Moli&egrave;re's <span class="italic">Monsieur de Pourceaugnac</span>, the other two acts being written by his friends William Congreve and Sir John Vanbrugh. Their play was performed three times in 1704, and, with a new third act by Vanbrugh, another four times in 1706, but was never printed. It seems that Walsh had a gentlemanly negligence about publication: most of his verse appeared in miscellanies and journals after his death, or remains unpublished.<br>
<br>Walsh was a low-church whig, devoted to the revolution settlement, and war against France. In August 1698, with the support of the lord chancellor, John Somers, he became MP for Worcestershire. He was re-elected in January 1701 after a contest which prompted his unpublished ballad, <span class="italic">The Worcester Cabal</span> to the tune of &#145;Pakington's Pound&#146;: one of his opponents being the tory Sir John Pakington (1671&#150;1727). In November 1701 he lost the seat to another tory, but, with the active help of William Lloyd (1627&#150;1717), bishop of Worcester, he regained it in August 1702. He now obtained a court appointment as gentleman of the horse under the new master of the horse, Charles Seymour, duke of Somerset (1662&#150;1748). Responding to an anonymous tory Messianic poem on the accession of Queen Anne, Walsh wrote a polished, insolently urbane parody of Virgil's fourth eclogue, <span class="italic">The Golden Age Restor'd</span>, published in <span class="italic">Poems on Affairs of State</span> (1703). He escaped from the exciting politics of Worcester when he was returned to parliament unopposed at a by-election for Richmond, Yorkshire, in June 1705. He was a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/73609', "Kit-Cat Club")</script>.<br>
<br>Walsh never married. He wrote of love: &#145;there is not one folly of that kind (excepting marriage) which I have not already committed&#146;  (W. Walsh, <span class="italic">Letters Amorous and Gallant</span>, 1692, letter 20). Political and literary enemies called him a fop; in an anonymous squib he is also called &#145;Master Eat-Finger&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems on Affairs of State</span>, 5.10), but no other evidence has been found of this infantile trait. He died intestate (so perhaps suddenly?) at Marlborough, Wiltshire, on 15 March 1708 and was buried at Abberley on 18 March. He was survived by his mother, who was granted letters of administration, and several sisters: his younger siblings <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60782/', "Octavia Walsh")</script> and Walter had predeceased him. Abberley was inherited by his sister Ann, wife of Francis Bromley.<br>
<br>Walsh left unfinished at his death a mock epic fragment, &#145;Abigail's Lamentation for the Loss of Mr Harley&#146;, satirizing Robert Harley and Abigail Masham. This and other poems appeared posthumously in various miscellanies, as did Walsh's prose satire &#145;Aesculapius, or, The Hospital of Fools&#146; in <span class="italic">Poems and Translations by Several Hands</span> (1714). Nevertheless his still unpublished poems are at least as numerous as the printed ones.<br>
<br>Walsh's main literary importance is as Alexander Pope's mentor. He saw manuscripts of some of Pope's pastorals, forwarded by their common friend Wycherley, perhaps as early as 1705; certainly he wrote very encouragingly to Pope in the following year; and in August 1707, when Pope visited him at Abberley, he famously advised the young poet to make correctness his study and aim. Walsh commented upon and corrected Pope's pastorals, and Pope appropriated some of his critical ideas for his &#145;Discourse on pastoral poetry&#146;. Walsh may also have seen an early draft of the <span class="italic">Essay on Criticism</span>, a poem that seems to have been conceived under his influence and concludes with high praise of Walsh as &#145;the Muse's Judge and Friend&#146;.<br>
