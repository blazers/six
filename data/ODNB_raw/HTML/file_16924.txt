<span class="headword">Lodge,  William</span>  (1649&#150;1689), <span class="occ">etcher and landscape draughtsman</span>, born on 4 July 1649 at Leeds, the son of William Lodge and his wife, Elizabeth Sykes, came from families of merchants in the cloth trade; his mother's grandfather, Richard Sykes, was one of the first aldermen of Leeds when it was incorporated as a borough in 1629. He attended a school in Leeds before being admitted in 1666 to Jesus College, Cambridge, and in 1668 to Lincoln's Inn in London, but on inheriting an income of &pound;300 a year had no further need to earn a living. He had taken up painting, drawing, and etching as an amateur at Cambridge.<br>
<br>In 1669&#150;70 Lodge accompanied Thomas Belasyse, Lord Fauconberg, the new ambassador to Venice, and remained in Italy for two years, during which time he visited Rome and Provence. After his return he published in 1679 a translation of Giacomo Barri's <span class="italic">Viaggio pittoresco d'Italia</span> under the title <span class="italic">The Painter's Voyage of Italy</span>, which he illustrated with his own etchings of artists' portraits. In the mid-1670s he met members of the circle of &#145;virtuosi&#146; in York, and one of these acquaintances, Mr Bolter of York, later gave George Vertue an account of his life. Vertue was given another account by Ralph Thoresby of Leeds, whose wife was a relation of Lodge's (Thoresby always referred to Lodge as &#145;cousin&#146; in his diary, and Lodge's name frequently appears in his correspondence). These narratives remain the chief sources of information about Lodge's life.<br>
<br>Lodge was a close friend of the engraver Francis Place, with whom he made a sketching tour in Wales in 1678 at the height of the Popish Plot fever, when both men were arrested as Jesuit spies. He made copious drawings on many tours, some of which survive in Leeds Public Library, York City Art Gallery, and the British Museum. Most are made with a fine pen, and give the appearance of being studies for etchings. According to Vertue, Lodge also painted portraits in oils, but none is now traceable. Lodge's etchings have not been investigated since the list of fifteen that Thoresby gave Vertue. Among them are a pair of views of York, dated 1678; a <span class="italic">Book of Divers Prospects done after the Life</span>, containing small oblong Italian landscapes; and some miscellaneous views in London and near York. Some of these were published by his fellow Yorkshireman Pierce Tempest. Lodge also etched various plates of shells to illustrate papers by Martin Lister published in the Royal Society's <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>. Unlike Place and other members of the York circle, he seems never to have made a mezzotint. Lodge died, unmarried, on 27 August 1689, and Vertue records a curious anecdote that he was buried in Harewood church, against his expressed wishes, but as had been foretold in a dream he had had.<br>
