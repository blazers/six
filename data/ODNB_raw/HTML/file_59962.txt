<span class="headword">Hinden <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gesundheit]</span>,  Rita</span>  (1909&#150;1971), <span class="occ">journalist and campaigner on colonial issues</span>, was born on 16 December 1909 in Cape Town, Cape Colony, and given the name Rebecca, which she never used. She was the second of the four children of Jacob or Jacov Gesundheit (1880&#150;1955), an ostrich farmer originally from Warsaw, Poland, and his wife, Bella Harris (1881&#150;1950), who was born in &#321;&oacute;d&#378;. After the farm failed in 1912 the family moved into the city, where Jacob prospered sufficiently in the textile industry to emigrate with them to Palestine in 1927&#151;the first South African family to do so&#151;and to establish himself in the citrus industry in Tel Aviv. At home Rita received a traditional Jewish preparation for marriage and family life, and she became fluent in Hebrew. Wanting to pursue her studies further, after matriculating in December 1925 from the Seminary of Good Hope, she attended the University of Cape Town for a year. In Tel Aviv she could find no equivalent higher education and so practised journalism until she could prevail upon her father to allow her to continue her education in England. In 1928 she entered the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), where she joined some socialist and Jewish societies. On gaining a second-class degree in economics in 1931 she returned to journalism in Palestine. The previous year, on a Young Zionists walking holiday, she had met, and soon became engaged to, Elchon Hinden (1907&#150;1977), a graduate of Cambridge University and a medical student at St George's Hospital, London. His father, a Latvian, had started as a barrow-boy and became a moneylender in Liverpool. The couple married in Tel Aviv on 14 February 1933 and returned to London for Elchon to complete specialist training in paediatrics, though as ardent Zionists they intended to settle in Palestine. Meanwhile they joined the Willesden branch of the Independent Labour Party.<br>
<br>Their return to Palestine in 1935 was a disappointment. Possibly because her family were settled there, Rita easily found work as a freelance journalist. In addition, under the auspices of the Jewish Agency for Palestine Economic Research Institute, supervised by David Horowitz, she undertook research into the Palestinian economy. While there Rita developed osteosclerosis, a condition of the inner ear, aggravated by pregnancy, in which the bones fuse to the ear-drum, resulting in deafness. The only remedy at that time was a hearing aid; however, shortly before her death an operation restored her hearing, to her great delight. At the same time, Elchon encountered difficulty in obtaining a permanent hospital post because of local medical ethics and practices, and both Elchon and Rita were troubled by the aggressive nationalism and dogmatism developing in Palestine in reaction to Hitler's activities in Europe. They became agnostics, and in 1938, while on holiday in England, decided after great heart searching that they should bring up their children, Judith and Jonathan, in London.<br>
<br>Although a proud and devoted mother, Rita could not settle into the housewifely role envisaged by her parents. With the help of a nanny she was able to return to the LSE to complete her research and in 1939 was awarded a doctorate for her thesis &#145;Palestine: an experiment in colonialism&#146;. Spin-offs from that research were four papers written in collaboration with Horowitz and her husband on Palestinian industry, economy, demography, and food. Following advice from R. R. Kuczinski, a reader at the LSE, to specialize in colonial economic studies, she sought openings in that field. Early in 1939 she had joined both the Labour Party and the Fabian Society. A few days before the Hindens had departed for Tel Aviv, at an Independent Labour Party reception, Rita had greatly impressed Arthur Creech Jones by her interest in colonial issues. He kept in touch with her activities and in 1939 contrived her appointment as assistant to Leonard Woolf in drawing up a colonial version of the society's series <span class="roman">Facts and Figures</span>. When the Second World War broke out, G. D. H. Cole and Margaret Cole formed a Fabian war aims committee. Rita was made joint secretary with Margaret Cole, principally to liaise with the Labour Party and other political groups embarking on similar investigations to prevent duplication of work. The Fabians chose to study the League of Nations, the colonies, and post-war reconstruction. Advised by a working party of Margery Perham, Creech Jones, Leonard Barnes, and Julian Huxley, Rita produced <span class="italic">Plan for Africa</span> (1942), which defined most of the principles of Fabian colonial policy developed and expounded during the war years.<br>
<br>Rita Hinden always claimed that she knew nothing about the colonies as a whole before 1938. At the outset of this new work she had great difficulty in gathering reliable facts. Discussion of this problem with Woolf and Margaret Cole led to the creation of the Fabian Colonial Bureau, to act as a &#145;clearing-house&#146; for information of all kinds on the colonies, to provide the Labour Party with a sound basis for the formation of colonial policy, to supply MPs with reliable facts for parliamentary debates on colonial affairs, and to organize their questions in the house. Creech Jones, who had long pressed for such a body within the labour movement, was nominated chairman and Rita its unsalaried secretary. Thus began a powerful partnership and a deep friendship which lasted far longer than their running of the bureau. This exacting work filled the painful gap caused by the necessary evacuation of her children to the country and Elchon's departure for India in the Royal Army Medical Corps. To elicit information, Rita consulted Creech Jones's contacts in the Colonial Office, and thereby gained the trust and friendship of colonial officials and servants. She devised conferences of Fabians, academics, and colonial experts, and edited and wrote much of the journal <span class="italic">Empire</span> (later <span class="italic">Venture</span>) as well as a continuous stream of <span class="roman">Tracts</span>, <span class="roman">Research</span> series, and <span class="roman">Colonial Controversy</span> series pamphlets on specific colonial subjects. These helped shape opinion in Britain and throughout the empire on political, social, and economic colonial development; her edition of <span class="italic">Fabian Colonial Essays</span> (1945) co-ordinated and lent further authority to those statements. Rita and Creech Jones became recognized as experts on colonial affairs and respected advisers to and friends of many of the emerging political leaders in the colonies. Her office was an essential port of call for colonial officers on leave. To her delight, she was an official guest of the Ghanaian government at its independence celebration.<br>
<br>Before 1945 Rita and Creech Jones jointly led delegations on topical issues to the colonial and dominions offices. After 1945 her clear-thinking, creative criticism was recognized by appointment to the Colonial Office's Economic and Development Council and its labour advisory committee, the Labour Party's advisory committee on imperial affairs, and the TUC's colonial affairs committee. After serving very critically on the 1951 Waddington commission of inquiry into the constitution of British Guiana, she became a founding member of the Africa Bureau in protest against the federation of Central Africa.<br>
<br>By 1950 opinion on development as an essential prerequisite for independence was becoming less generous because of the perceived cost. Rita Hinden, hurt by the current trend, resigned from the bureau, which she thought had become less of a research body and too much of a pressure group. She moved to the Labour Party research department before taking on the editorship of the monthly publication <span class="italic">Socialist Commentary</span>. In editorials and articles in this journal, and in her choice of contributors, Hinden was again able to give voice to her ardent and essentially ethical form of socialism, which made her an influential revisionist and the ideal presenter of <span class="italic">The Radical Tradition</span> (1964), the memorial volume of R. H. Tawney's essays. <span class="italic">Socialist Commentary</span> presented the views of the Gaitskellite section of the Labour Party as opposed to those of Harold Wilson's adherents and <span class="italic">Tribune</span>; nevertheless, Rita herself staunchly opposed Hugh Gaitskell's anti-Common Market stance at the 1962 Labour Party conference. In <span class="italic">Socialist Commentary</span> and in many articles for other journals and newspapers she expounded the fundamental principles of socialism, whether writing about trade unionism, higher education, or political developments in the newly independent states.<br>
<br>In her youth Rita Hinden was good-looking, with dark eyes and hair, a thoughtful, listening expression, and a sensitive mouth. In her early sixties one was struck less by her appearance&#151;the grey hair escaping from a bun, lines on her face, bird-like posture of her head, and slight limp (the relic of a mild stroke suffered in her fifties)&#151;than by her benign, gentle authority, that of the Jewish matriarch, which coaxed others to accede to her wishes. She died of a second stroke on 18 November 1971, at Whipps Cross Hospital, London, and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium. Memorial lectures were given in her honour until 1974.<br>
