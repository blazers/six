<span class="headword">Rowley,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1668&#150;1728), <span class="occ">maker of scientific instruments and mechanic</span>, was born in Lichfield, Staffordshire, the youngest of three sons and a daughter of William Rowley (<i>d</i>. 1673), sword cutler of Lichfield, and his wife, Elizabeth. On 20 October 1682 he was bound apprentice to the London mathematical and optical instrument maker Joseph Hone in the Broderers' Company, and he took his freedom in that company on 26 February 1691. Soon afterwards he established his own business, opening a shop in 1704 at the sign of the Globe, in Fleet Street in the City of London; he took five apprentices between 1699 and 1710. On 18 April 1697 he married Catherine Harding (<i>d</i>. 1756) at Wooburn, Buckinghamshire. Their daughter Elizabeth was baptized at St Bartholomew-the-Less, West Smithfield, London, on 31 May 1698.<br>
<br>From 1704 to 1708 Rowley enjoyed the patronage of Prince George of Denmark. He also supplied Christ's Hospital mathematical school, the Office of Ordnance, and other corporate bodies with a wide range of mathematical, drawing, surveying, and gunnery instruments. His sextant, made in 1708 and figured in John Harris's <span class="italic">Lexicon technicum</span> of 1710, together with the other instruments which he provided for the observatory at Trinity College, Cambridge, commended him to the Royal Society, which in 1711&#150;13 asked him to report on the instruments of John Flamsteed, astronomer royal, at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. In 1710 he made four large sundials for Blenheim Palace and three for St Paul's Cathedral, which further enhanced his reputation.<br>
<br>Rowley worked in brass, silver, and ivory to produce some extremely fine pieces and he was recognized as the most skilled maker of mathematical instruments and models of his day. Other craftsmen emulated him, and he was praised by scientific writers. He became the principal supplier of instruments to Charles Boyle, fourth earl of Corke and Orrery, who assembled one of the finest collections of the age. About 1712 Orrery commissioned from Rowley a mechanical model of the earth&#150;sun&#150;moon system, of a type constructed by the clockmaker George Graham, but larger and more sophisticated. Perhaps as a pun on the word &#145;horary&#146;, Rowley named it an &#145;orrery&#146;, still the current term for a mechanical planetarium. Rowley also made magnificent orreries for the Habsburg emperor Charles VI in 1712&#150;13, for Peter the Great in 1714, and for the East India Company in 1714&#150;15. George I commissioned his most elaborate model, the &#145;great solar system&#146;, in 1722, at a price of &pound;1000; this may have been remodelled in 1733 by one of Rowley's former apprentices, Thomas Wright, who was also noted for his grand orreries.<br>
<br>On his appointment in 1715 as master of mechanics to George I, Rowley relinquished his shop to Thomas Wright and concentrated on business for the offices of Ordnance and Works, the latter being responsible for the royal palaces and other official buildings. He was charged with making and repairing water and fire engines at Kensington Palace, Hampton Court, the House of Commons, and Windsor Castle. The &#145;great water engine&#146; which he built at Windsor in 1718 functioned until 1758; Rowley was its keeper by royal warrant of 1721, backdated to 1718. He constructed engines for the Tower of London and numerous fire engines for the Office of Ordnance. Appointed inspector to the Chelsea Waterworks Company, he constructed in 1725&#150;6 a water engine which lasted until 1775. Between 1704 and 1723 he supplied the Board of Ordnance with many weighing and measuring devices, among which &#145;Rowley's Tower yard&#146; later played an important part in standardizing the English yard. His techniques for gauging cannonball weight and dimensions also led to the standardized calibration of land and sea cannon in 1715.<br>
<br>Rowley joined two of the earliest known art clubs, the Rose and Crown and the prestigious <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96316', "Society of the Virtuosi of St Luke")</script>. George Vertue has described an untraced portrait of him, painted by Jacob van Schuppen in Vienna about 1718. The &#145;learned and curious&#146; often met at Rowley's Johnson's Court house, off Fleet Street, and Samuel Johnson praised him for his perpetual-motion experiments. Rowley died intestate on 14 January 1728 in London and was buried on 19 January at St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street.<br>
