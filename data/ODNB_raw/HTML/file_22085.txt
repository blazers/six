<span class="headword">Phaer <span class="st"> [Phayer]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (1510?&#150;1560), <span class="occ">translator and physician</span>, was the son of Thomas Phaer of Norwich and his wife, Clara, daughter of either Sir Richard or Sir William Godier. He was educated at Oxford University and Lincoln's Inn. Early in his career he became attached to the household of William Paulet, first marquess of Winchester, whom he described as &#145;my first brynger up and patrone&#146;  (Phaer, sig. A2<i>r</i>). With his patron's backing, Phaer was appointed solicitor to the council in the marches of Wales in or about 1547. Winchester was also apparently instrumental in arranging Phaer's marriage to Anne Revel, the prosperous widow of a Pembrokeshire merchant, Thomas Revel. The marriage took place between 18 June 1548, when Agnes was granted the wardship of her late husband's heir, and 21 December 1551, when Richard, Lord Rich, ceased to be lord chancellor. In 1549 he was granted a lease in the Forest of Cilgerran in Pembrokeshire, and lived there for the remainder of his life. Thomas and Anne had two daughters, whom they named Mary and Elizabeth, after the two daughters of Henry VIII. Thomas Phaer had another daughter, Eleanor, who was married by 1560, and may have been the product of a previous marriage.<br>
<br>Phaer's first professional activities were in the field of law, and he published two legal handbooks in the English language, <span class="italic">Natura brevium</span> (1530?) and <span class="italic">A Newe Book of Presidentes</span> (1543). The latter proved enduringly popular, with twenty-seven editions up to 1656. From about 1540 Phaer embarked on a second career as a doctor and writer on medical matters. In 1544 he published in one volume <span class="italic">The Regiment of Lyfe</span>, a translation of the work by Jehan Goeurot, together with three medical works of his own, <span class="italic">A Goodly Bryefe Treatise of the Pestylence</span>, <span class="italic">A Declaration of the Veynes</span>, and <span class="italic">The Boke of Chyldren</span>. An enlarged edition appeared in 1553, and the volume would prove one of the most widely read and frequently reprinted medical texts of the Tudor era. While early readers may have been primarily interested in Goeurot, Phaer's own importance as a paediatrician is now widely recognized. He has been called the &#145;Father of English Pediatrics&#146;  (Ruhr&auml;h, 147). There is reason to suppose that he was responsible for the introduction of a bill &#145;for the nursing of Children in Wales&#146; in the 1547 parliament. Although he published no further medical works, Phaer continued to practise medicine. On 6 February 1559 he graduated MB from Oxford, with leave to practise, proceeding MD on 21 March of the same year. In his supplication for the first degree he stated that he had practised medicine for twenty years, and had conducted experiments involving poisons and antidotes.<br>
<br>Alongside his professional activities Phaer was an author and translator of verse. He contributed commendatory verses to Peter Baldwin's <span class="italic">Preceptes of Warre</span> (1544). In one edition of <span class="italic">A Mirror for Magistrates</span> (1578) he is identified as the author of a lament in the person of Owen Glendower (Owain Glyn D&#373;r), though earlier editions attribute the same lament to William Baldwin. Phaer does seem to have been acquainted with the editors of the <span class="italic">Mirror</span>, raising the possibility that the ballad on the famous Gad's Hill robbery attributed to him by Wharton was intended for inclusion in that work [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96546', "Contributors to A Mirror for Magistrates")</script>]. Another lost work, &#145;Certen Verses of Cupydo, by M. Fayre&#146;, received licence for publication by Thomas Purfoot in 1566, after Phaer's death.<br>
<br>Phaer is remembered above all as the first Englishman to attempt a full translation of Virgil's <span class="italic">Aeneid</span>. He began the work on 9 May 1555 and made it, as he explained in his dedication to Queen Mary, &#145;my pastyme in all my vacations&#146;  (Phaer, sig. A2<i>r</i>). <span class="italic">The Seven First Bookes of the Eneidos of Virgill</span> was published in 1558, with a note at the end of each book of the number of days (averaging around twenty) spent in translating it. Phaer went on to translate the eighth and ninth books, and to begin work on the tenth, before receiving an injury to his right hand in 1560 that stopped his work and led to his death. In 1562 Phaer's friend and literary executor William Wightman, &#145;receptour of Wales&#146;, arranged the publication of <span class="italic">The nyne fyrst bookes of the Eneidos of Virgil converted into Englishe vearse by Thomas Phaer doctour of phisike, with so muche of the tenthe booke, as since his death coulde be founde in unperfit papers at his house in Kilgarran forest in Penbroke shyre</span>. The volume was dedicated, as Phaer had apparently requested, to Sir Nicholas Bacon, lord keeper of the great seal. Phaer's translation was finally completed by his friend Thomas Twyne in 1573. In 1584 the work was reissued, with the addition of Twyne's translation of the &#145;thirteenth book&#146; added to Virgil's twelve by Maffeo Veggio.<br>
<br>Phaer's translation, in rhyming lines of fourteen syllables, is fairly readable and generally faithful to the original. The work was held in high esteem by the Elizabethans. George Puttenham, in numbering the best English poets, declared that &#145;In Queenes Maries time florished above any other Doctour Phaer&#146;  (Puttenham, <span class="italic">Arte of English Poesie</span>, ed. E. Arber, 1906, 75). Thomas Nashe too praised Phaer's &#145;heavenly verse&#146; while complaining that it was &#145;blemished by his hautie thoghts&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Works of Thomas Nashe</span>, ed. R. B. McKerrow, rev. F. P. Wilson, 1958, 3.319). The precise nature of the charge is unclear, but Nashe may have been referring to Phaer's ambitiousness as a would-be Renaissance polymath, devoting himself simultaneously to law, medicine, and poetry. The same point was later made by Wood, rather more gently, when he noted that Phaer was remembered as &#145;a person of mutable mind&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 315).<br>
<br>However disparate their subject matter, all of Phaer's published works are united by use of the English language, and the author's often aggressive pride in that tongue. In his legal and medical works Phaer associated the use of the vernacular with social reform and the popularization of vital knowledge. Describing medical lore as a treasure, he announced his intention &#145;to declare that to the use of many, which ought not to be secrete for lucre of a fewe&#146;  (Phaer, <span class="italic">The Regiment of Lyfe</span>, 1546, sig. Aii<i>v</i>). At the same time, in keeping with the mood of post-Reformation England, Phaer was concerned to uphold the worthiness of English on patriotic grounds. He claimed to have undertaken his translation of the <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> in part &#145;for defence of my countrey language (which I have heard discommended of many, and estemyd of some to be more than barbarous)&#146;  (Phaer, sig. X2<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>It is a paradox of Phaer's career that he devoted himself to the defence of the English language on populist and patriotic grounds while living in a region of west Wales where English was not widely spoken. Whether or not he ever learned Welsh, Phaer was clearly committed both politically and poetically to his adopted country. Given that the Welsh in this era claimed descent from Aeneas and the Trojans, Phaer's decision to translate Virgil's epic may have owed something to his local situation.<br>
<br>In addition to serving as solicitor to the council in the marches, Phaer represented Welsh constituencies in four parliaments under three monarchs, being returned first for Carmarthen Boroughs (1547) and subsequently for Cardigan Boroughs (1555, 1558, 1559). He also held a variety of local offices, serving as steward of Cilgerran and constable of Cilgerran Castle from 1548 until his death, as justice of the peace in Cardiganshire, and as customs officer in Milford Haven and other ports. His &#145;Report on his perambulation around the coast of Wales&#146;, prepared in the reign of Edward VI, remains a valuable source of information about Welsh ports and customs administration in the mid-sixteenth century. Phaer's career as a public servant was not marked by controversy, though there is an intriguing reference at the end of the fifth book of <span class="italic">Eneidos</span>, completed on 4 May 1557, to his having escaped some kind of personal danger in Carmarthen.<br>
<br>In 1560 Phaer suffered the injury, possibly involving a fall from a horse, which deprived him of the use of his right hand and led to his death. His will is dated 12 August 1560, and his death, at his home in the Forest of Cilgerran, followed within a few weeks; on 26 September 1560 John Vaughan succeeded him as steward of Cilgerran. He left his Cilgerran estate, which had been regranted to him in 1558 for a term of forty years, to his wife. He also instructed her to bestow the sum of &pound;5 &#145;where she doth knowe, by an appointemente betwene her and me&#146;  (Cunningham, 4). This bequest has been taken as indication that Phaer remained privately faithful to the Catholic church. The inference is supported by his dedication of the <span class="italic">Eneidos</span> to Queen Mary, and by an approving reference in the preface to Rome's abiding spiritual authority.<br>
<br>On the day before he died, according to William Wightman, Phaer translated and sent to Wightman two lines from the tenth book of the <span class="italic">Aeneid</span>:<blockquote>
<div>Ech mans day stands prefixt, time short &amp; swift with cureles bretche<br>
</div>
<div>Is lotted al mankind, but by their deedes their fame to stretche<br>
</div>
<div>That privilege vertue gives.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Nyne First Bookes</span>, sig. Gg3<i>r</i>)</blockquote>Phaer's death was mourned in verse by Thomas Chaloner and Barnabe Googe. George Ferrers selected the scriptural verses for Phaer's memorial in Cilgerran church, where he was buried. The memorial has long since disappeared, but a new commemorative tablet was erected at Cilgerran in 1986, following an appeal in the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span>.<br>
