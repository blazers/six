<span class="headword">Bowyer,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1569/70), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was one of the six sons of Robert Bowyer (<i>d</i>. 1552), of Chichester, Sussex, and his wife, Margaret. His father was four times mayor of Chichester, and MP for the borough in 1529 and 1547. His elder brother Robert (<i>d</i>. 1567/8) represented Chichester in the parliaments of 1555 and 1559, while Agnes, one of his five sisters, married William Neale, auditor of the exchequer. Bowyer's early life before his entry into the Middle Temple in 1553 is obscure. However, in his will of 15 April 1569 he paid tribute to Alexander Nowell, dean of St Paul's and former master of Westminster School, &#145;my singular good Master and no lesse approved good frende&#146; for &#145;my bringing up in the feare and knowledge of god&#146;  (fol. 142<i>v</i>). By 1560 Bowyer was bailiff of the borough of Westminster, where he came into contact with Sir William Cecil, the high steward. He resided in the parish of Wimbledon, Surrey, alongside Cecil, and at the time of his death was owed &pound;500 by the queen's secretary of state. Bowyer's other residence was in Hand Alley, off London's Fleet Street. He married, at an uncertain date, Agnes, daughter of Sir John Harcourt (<i>d</i>. 1566) of Stanton Harcourt, Oxfordshire, and Ellenhall, Staffordshire, and Margaret, daughter of Sir William Barentyne. Agnes was the widow of John Knyvet of Ashwellthorpe, Norfolk. They had two sons, William and Robert, and a daughter, Judith. Bowyer's closest friend was Edward Flowerdew of Norfolk, a lawyer who became a serjeant-at-law and a baron of the exchequer.<br>
<br>Bowyer sat in the parliament of 1563 for Westminster. A year later he was identified as a supporter of the protestant faith and appointed a JP for Surrey. In 1565 he assisted the city of London in the defence of its trading privileges at the Anglo-Netherlandish colloquy of Bruges. By January 1563 Bowyer was occupying the position of keeper of records in the Tower of London, although his patent for that office was not issued until 18 June 1567. His efforts in the latter year to secure custody of the records of parliament and chancery stored in the Rolls Chapel and Rolls House were thwarted by Sir William Cordell, the master of the rolls, but Bowyer still had in his keeping the largest collection of government records, and he was credited by John Strype in the early eighteenth century with being &#145;the first Digester of them into some Method&#146;  (McKisack, 82&#150;3). It was later stated that he devoted eight years and &pound;1000 to his labours, producing digests of the parliament, patent, charter, close, and foreign rolls, from the reigns of King John to Edward IV (now in the College of Arms), as well as a list of escheats, a medieval roll of arms and a heraldic commonplace book. As a collector of manuscripts, Bowyer acquired the Rievaulx Abbey copy of Roger of Howden's <span class="italic">Chronica</span>, the C manuscript of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, William of Malmesbury's <span class="italic">De antiquitate Glastoniensis ecclesiae</span>, Ranulf Higden's <span class="italic">Polychronicon</span>, and Laurence Nowell's transcription of the <span class="italic">Vita et mors Edwardi secundi</span> (part of Geoffrey le Baker's chronicle), among other notable documents of the English medieval past. His second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37211/', "Robert Bowyer (d. 1621)")</script>, who became keeper of the records in the Tower in 1604, inherited many of his father's heraldic and historical manuscripts, some of which are preserved in the library of the Inner Temple. The eldest son, William, acquired the &#145;bokes escriptes writinges and monuments &hellip; as be of my own hande writing &hellip; as matters of greater value then all that I leave&#146;  (fol. 142<i>r</i>). Bowyer died possessed of the leases of his residences, the prebend of Waltham in Chichester Cathedral and parsonage of Selsey, Sussex, and the farm of Little Thetford, Cambridgeshire. Probate of his will was granted on 23 June 1570, his widow being his executor.<br>
