<span class="headword">Wharton,  Goodwin</span>  (1653&#150;1704), <span class="occ">politician and autobiographer</span>, was born on 8 March 1653, the third and youngest son (there were also four daughters) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29170/', "Philip Wharton, fourth Baron Wharton (1613&#150;1696)")</script>, and his second wife, Jane, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10987/', "Arthur Goodwin (d. 1643)")</script> of Winchendon, Buckinghamshire. His mother died when he was five. After a private education in France, which included a year at the protestant academy in Caen (1663&#150;4), Wharton briefly sat as an MP in the parliament of 1680 as member for East Grinstead, before a hotheaded pro-exclusionist speech forced him to lie low. He became involved in business ventures, such as wreck-salvaging and deep-sea diving, though these proved unprofitable.<br>
<br>On his father's death in 1696 Wharton inherited estates in Buckinghamshire. He had meantime become a JP, serving in that role until his death; he was elected MP in 1690 for Malmesbury and in 1695 for Cockermouth, and subsequently knight of the shire for Buckinghamshire, sitting until his death. Belligerently anti-French and anti-Catholic, he was a vocal supporter of William III, an energetic champion of whig principles, and a ferret of Jacobite plotters. Appointed first a lieutenant-colonel of horse in Lord Macclesfield's regiment, and then a lord commissioner of the Admiralty, he saw active service in the channel during the Nine Years' War before a stroke in 1698 put a premature end to his military career and probably hastened his death. He never married, but had an illegitimate son, Hezekiah Knowles. Though eclipsed by his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29175/', "Thomas Wharton (later first marquess of Wharton)")</script>, and cutting less of a dash than his two other brothers&#151;William (by his father's third marriage), the wit and gallant, slain in a duel, and Henry, the soldier politician who died young while campaigning in Ireland&#151;Goodwin Wharton nevertheless played no small part in post-1688 whig politics.<br>
<br>If his public life was typical of the whig grandees of his day, Wharton lived a private life (at least in his head) that was bizarre in the extreme. An unpublished autobiographical memoir, kept from 1686 until near his death and running to some half a million words, reveals a florid fantasy life. He records his fury at being treated &#145;like a slave&#146; and swindled by his family, while enjoying ambiguous sexual relationships with his stepmother, Anne Carr Popham, Lady Wharton, and also with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29163/', "Anne Wharton")</script>, the wife of his brother Thomas. He describes persecution by government agents during the reign of James II. He relates a lasting erotic liaison with a certain Mary Parish, an astrologer, cunning woman, and medium, with whom he lived in Long Acre, and by whom he claimed to have had progeny numbering 106. His autobiography tells of expeditions to Hounslow Heath, on the advice of Major John Wildman, to dig up buried treasure, of programmes of alchemical experiments, and of meetings with dignitaries from the fairy kingdom of the Lowlanders (whose queen, Penelope, he believed he married). He recounts his illicit amours with Mary of Modena, Queen Mary, and Queen Anne. Absorbing his father's deep piety, he believed himself to be in direct communication with angels and with the Lord himself, who had predestined him to be &#145;King of Kings and Solar King of the World&#146;, sent to repopulate his nation. Wharton's autobiography ranks high in the annals of psychopathology. He died on 26 October 1704.<br>
