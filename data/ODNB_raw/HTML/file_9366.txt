<span class="headword">Ferrers,  Robert  de</span>, sixth earl of Derby  (<em>c.</em>1239&#150;1279), <span class="occ">magnate and rebel</span>, was the eldest son of William de Ferrers, earl of Derby (<i>c</i>.1200&#150;1254), from his second marriage, to Margaret, elder daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22966/', "Roger de Quincy, earl of Winchester (d. 1264)")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Childhoodandinheritance"></a>Childhood and inheritance</h2>Ferrers's first appearance as a public figure came in 1249, when he married the seven-year-old Mary, daughter of Hugues (XI) de Lusignan, count of La Marche, the eldest of Henry III's half-brothers, at Westminster&#151;a match that marked Henry's regard for Ferrers's father, who, though prominent at court in the 1230s, was later prevented by incapacitating gout from playing much part in affairs. The death of William de Ferrers in 1254 left his young son already a knight but also a minor. Unable to inherit, he saw the wardship of his estates handed over to Edward, the king's eldest son, and then sold on to the queen and Peter of Savoy for 6000 marks in 1257. Only in 1260 did he do homage and take possession of his lands.<br>
<br>His preceding wardship was merely one, and perhaps the least important, of the factors that weakened Ferrers's standing at his accession to the earldom. In the two decades preceding his father's death territorial acquisitions and efficient management had combined to enhance the family fortunes. The ancestral holdings of the Ferrers formed a compact block in north Staffordshire, south Derbyshire, and western Nottinghamshire, centred on the castle and borough of Tutbury. But the marriage of Robert's grandfather, William, to Agnes, sister and coheir of Ranulf (III), earl of Chester, had brought in extensive new lands after Ranulf's death in 1232. Chief among them were the castle and manor of Chartley, Staffordshire, all Lancashire between Ribble and Mersey, and other manors in Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire. By additionally developing boroughs and markets, exploiting the forests of Needwood and Duffield, keeping a tight hold on grants, and taking advantage of the rising prices and land values, which benefited all great landowners at this time, Ferrers's grandfather and father had been able to build up an estate worth some &pound;1500 p.a. in the 1250s&#151;an income that placed the earls of Derby among the half-dozen wealthiest of Henry III's nobles. Ferrers could not maintain this position. His resources were depleted, most damagingly by the dower of his mother, Margaret, who survived until 1281 and was in possession of the widow's traditional third, amounting to land worth some &pound;500 and including, at least for a time, the major asset of Chartley. But the estate also had to provide for Ferrers's younger brother William, for his wife Mary, who held two manors in her own right under the terms of their marriage agreement, and to a lesser extent for Edward, who retained some family land beyond Earl Robert's coming of age. Add to these burdens the debts of nearly &pound;800 which Ferrers took over from his father and for which the exchequer was pursuing him in 1262&#151;obligations that probably explain his borrowing from the Jews&#151;and it becomes clear that the new earl, if not poor, was certainly hard-pressed. During the period of his wardship his only income appears to have been the &pound;100 p.a. that Henry had settled on him and his wife by way of a <i>maritagium</i>.<h2>
<a name="Aggressionaggrandizementandimprisonment12601265"></a>Aggression, aggrandizement and imprisonment, 1260&#150;1265</h2>Ferrers's financial difficulties, together with a violent waywardness of character that was to mark his whole career, may help to account for his first actions as earl. According to the Burton annals, no sooner had he received his lands in 1260 than he &#145;destroyed&#146; the priory of Tutbury, of which he was patron. A series of subsequent and sizeable grants to the priory may confirm the story, pointing to a guilty conscience and possible reparations. He made comparably unlawful encroachments on the rights of some leading tenants, while also exploiting more licitly his forests and boroughs, following the lines laid down by his father and grandfather. Derby's involvement with his estates, along with his youth, inexperience, and possibly his disability (he had inherited his family's liability to gout), do much to explain his absence from national politics during these early years. He took no part in the great baronial reforms of royal government in 1258&#150;9, initiated before his majority, and until 1263 he spent much of his time on his lands, especially at Tutbury. Unlike the other earls he witnessed none of Henry III's charters in the early 1260s, though Henry must have reckoned him a royalist, for Derby was among those whom the king summoned in arms to London in October 1261, during his restoration to power. At some point in these early years he also kept company with the leading reformers, two of whom, Richard de Clare, earl of Gloucester, and Simon de Montfort, witnessed an undated charter in favour of his sister. But there is nothing here to indicate any firm commitment to one side or the other.<br>
<br>That remained true even after Montfort's return to England in April 1263, as the leader of an armed rising against the king's friends, had made an uncommitted stance more difficult to maintain. Ostensibly Derby moved towards Montfort. He first saw action during the disorders of May and June, when the Dunstable annals record his seizure of &#145;three castles&#146; belonging to Edward: probably the &#145;Three Castles&#146;, often so called, of Grosmont, Skenfrith, and Whitecastle, which lay towards the centre of the disturbances in the southern marches of Wales. He was with Montfort in London in December 1263 and took a leading part in the renewed war along the marches, which followed Louis IX's quashing of the provisions of Oxford in January 1264. His chief exploit came at Worcester, where in February he took the town, sacked the Jewish quarter, killed or imprisoned many Jews, and later carried off to Tutbury the bonds recording Jewish loans: retaliation perhaps by an enraged debtor. He then moved down the Severn to Gloucester, where Edward had taken the castle for the king. But a truce made by Henry de Montfort allowed Edward to slip away from Derby's clutches, much to his anger, and to retreat to his father Henry at Oxford, devastating Derby's valuable Berkshire manor of Stanford in the Vale <i>en route</i>.<br>
<br>These events clarify Derby's motives during the barons' war: not support for reform, but hatred of Edward. Of no one was Edward more afraid, says Robert of Gloucester, describing their near confrontation at Gloucester. The origins of this explosive feud are unfortunately obscure, but they probably lay in Edward's ancestral claim to the Peverel inheritance in north Derbyshire, including the castle of the Peak, which Derby's grandfather had been made to surrender to the crown in 1222 and which had become part of Edward's apanage in 1254. Edward's wardship of Earl Robert's lands between 1254 and 1257, and his later retention of some holdings, may have compounded these resentments. Whatever its roots, the feud contributed powerfully to the national disorders that marked the spring and summer of 1264. In March Edward's men attacked Derby's lands in Staffordshire, taking Chartley Castle, and after the royalist victory at Northampton in April Edward himself was able to turn against his enemy, destroying Tutbury and extorting money from Derby's tenants. Derby was still regarded as a Montfortian, for Montfort made a long but vain wait for his arrival before setting out from London for the campaign that gave him victory over the king at Lewes in May 1264. But in fact he was solely concerned with his own interests. Edward's capture at Lewes gave those interests free rein for the first time, and Derby was now able to regain and augment all that he had lost. He overran the royal and Edwardian castles of Bolsover, Derbyshire, Horston, Derbyshire, and Tickhill, Yorkshire, joined in Baldwin Wake's attack on the royal castle of Fotheringhay, Northamptonshire, and in late June or early July crowned these successes with the capture of Edward's chief castle of the Peak. In the autumn a westward campaign apparently brought Edward's other great base at Chester into his hands. Having obliterated Edward's power in the north-west midlands, he seemed set to replace it with his own.<br>
<br>But Derby's achievement had been possible only because of Edward's captivity and the preoccupation of the country's ruler, Simon de Montfort, with a threatened French invasion of southern England; and in the winter of 1264&#150;5 both these circumstances changed. By November 1264 the danger of invasion had receded, leaving Montfort's supremacy unchallenged, and in the following month plans were devised for Edward's release. They entailed the surrender to Montfort of a large part of Edward's apanage, including Chester and the Peak, in exchange for less valuable lands elsewhere. By this scheme Montfort thus replaced Edward as Derby's chief rival, with a new and personal interest in reversing his recent territorial gains. This was accomplished adeptly and with surprising ease. In December Derby was summoned to the parliament arranged for mid-January 1265, and shortly afterwards called on to surrender the Peak. The summons to a parliament that otherwise comprised only staunch Montfortians was an almost blatant device to remove Derby from the scene of his triumphs and to open his lands, new and old, to a Montfortian takeover. It is a mark of Earl Robert's characteristic lack of political cunning that he fell into the trap, with predictable results. In February, during his parliamentary sojourn in London, he was arrested and sent to the Tower of London. The chronicles give differing reasons for his arrest: it was a gesture to Henry, who would have preferred to see him condemned to death for his spoliations, or a punishment for his breaches of the peace after Lewes, or a result of his collusion with the rebellious marchers. But the variety of explanations only shows how well Montfort had covered his tracks. The truth was that Derby's removal was essential to Montfort's territorial ambitions, and that it could be accomplished without much risk because the earl's violent self-seeking had left him friendless.<h2>
<a name="Rebellionandruin12651269"></a>Rebellion and ruin, 1265&#150;1269</h2>Montfort, however, had neither the time nor the opportunity to enjoy his gains. The new territories had probably been intended as an endowment for his eldest son, Henry, but there was local resistance, both from Derby's men and from Edward's, to their appropriation, and Montfort's death at Evesham in August 1265 cut short any hopes of their absorption into a family principality. After the battle Derby was released, and in December 1265 he came to terms with the king, offering the substantial fine of 1500 marks and a gold cup in return for Henry's pardon, his mediation in the earl's quarrel with Edward, and his guarantee of Derby's being spared disinheritance. Given the harsh treatment of the Montfortians, whose disinheritance had already been decided on, Henry's willingness to do more for Derby may seem surprising; but the activities of the earl's associates in thwarting Montfort's territorial schemes had prepared the way for a reconciliation, and the king needed both his money and his support in the north midlands. It was therefore all the more foolish of Derby to turn his back on what he was fortunate to have obtained. In May 1266 he joined a rebellious gathering of disinherited Montfortians under Baldwin Wake and John Deyville at Chesterfield, where they were surprised and routed by a royalist force. Weakened by gout, Derby was taken prisoner while his blood was being let. His reasons for risking all in this way are entirely unclear. He had lost some land, including Chartley, as a result of his recent escapades, but in no sense had he been disinherited. Yet he had now placed himself so much in the wrong as to be as exposed as he had been in February 1265. This time his isolation was the prelude to his ruin.<br>
<br>The process was a gradual one. After his capture Derby was imprisoned at Windsor, where he remained until 1269. In the meantime, by a series of royal orders and grants made between June and August 1266, Henry's second son, Edmund, was given possession of his lands and goods. Although in July Edmund received a formal grant of the Derby lands in fee, the dictum of Kenilworth, proclaimed in October, continued to hold out the possibility of Earl Robert's restoration. He could have his lands back in return for a redemption payment of seven times their annual value: a multiplier so large that it placed the earl in an almost unique category among the disinherited, a category to match what the king regarded as the enormity of his offences. In this sequence of events there was muddle and confusion, and although Edmund had <i>de facto</i> possession of Derby's lands he could not yet reckon that his position was secure. This was not achieved until 1269, by arrangements that combined an extension of the principles of the dictum of Kenilworth with royal connivance at an illicit piece of private enterprise. On 1 May 1269 Earl Robert appeared before king and council at Windsor. There he received back all his lands, acknowledged a debt of &pound;50,000 to Edmund, and conceded that this sum should be raised from his lands if it had not been paid by 9 July. Disinheritance was not mentioned nor ostensibly intended. Later in the same day, however, he was taken to the manor of Cippenham, Buckinghamshire, the property of Richard, earl of Cornwall, and there, under duress (as he later pleaded) and in the presence of John Chishall, the chancellor, he made over all his lands to eleven manucaptors, all notable royalists, as a security for the payment of his &pound;50,000 debt. He was then taken to Richard of Cornwall's castle at Wallingford and released at the end of May. When the deadline of 9 July passed without payment, as had, of course, been intended, the manucaptors transferred the estate to Edmund, and Ferrers was left virtually landless and deprived of his title.<h2>
<a name="Attemptsatrecoveryanddeath"></a>Attempts at recovery, and death</h2>For the remaining ten years of his life Ferrers's central interest lay in regaining his inheritance. This was a vain hope, largely because it would have meant dispossessing Henry III's second son and Edward I's brother (and finding other lands for him elsewhere), because king and council had tacitly sanctioned what had been done, and because Edward too had been a party to the Cippenham skullduggery: the last act in the long feud with his midland adversary. After Ferrers's release he could bring no immediate action against Edmund because of his supplanter's departure on crusade, and the legal protection that went with it. In 1273, soon after Edmund's return, Ferrers took the law into his own hands by seizing his old castle at Chartley, but he was soon ejected by Edmund's forces. He prepared more effectively for action by seeking help from the powerful Gilbert de Clare, earl of Gloucester. In May 1273 he made a series of agreements with Clare, by which he promised him extensive lands, including the bulk of the Chester inheritance between Ribble and Mersey, in return for Clare's undertaking to maintain his affairs, to grant him 200 librates of land until his restoration, and to try to secure him a reasonable redemption settlement. The legal case to which this scheme was the preliminary began in October 1274, shortly after Edward I's return to England. It turned on Ferrers's plea that he was willing to stand on the terms of the dictum of Kenilworth&#151;seven years' redemption&#151;but that Edmund had refused to countenance this. Edmund responded by producing the Cippenham &#145;agreement&#146; and invoking Ferrers's failure to meet its terms. The counterplea advanced by Ferrers, that the &#145;agreement&#146; was made under duress, while he was in prison, availed nothing, for Edmund was able to retort that the chancellor's presence at the making of the &#145;agreement&#146; gave it the force of record, with full legal validity. Ferrers's case was then dismissed. He found some consolation in 1275, when he brought a successful action for the recovery of his manor of Chartley; though Edmund retained the castle. When he died in 1279 Chartley was all that remained of his inheritance. Foolish though he had been, he had a good case in law, and its failure showed how the interests of the royal family could still take precedence over justice.<br>
<br>In his later years Ferrers may have derived more satisfaction from his family life than from his standing as a magnate who had fallen on hard times. His first wife, Mary, died some time between 1266 and 1269, and on 26 June 1269, a month after his release from prison, he married Eleanor, daughter of Humphrey (V) de Bohun (who was killed fighting for Montfort at Evesham), and granddaughter of the earl of Hereford. His earlier marriage had been childless, but with Eleanor he had at least two sons: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9363/', "John de Ferrers")</script>, born at Cardiff on 20 June 1271, and Thomas, on whom he settled a small sum between 1274 and 1279. John was to be prominent in the baronial opposition to Edward I in 1297, a stance that must have been linked with his continuing attempts to regain his father's lost inheritance. Between 1269 and 1275 the landless Ferrers spent some time on his mother's dower lands in Northamptonshire, but after 1275 he appears to have resided at Chartley. Towards the end of his life he made a number of grants to the neighbouring Augustinian priory of St Thomas, Stafford, which seems to have replaced Tutbury as the family house. There he was probably buried, as he had certainly intended to be. His widow survived until 1314, engaging in her former husband's great cause by bringing a claim against Edmund for dower in his ancestral lands, but settling eventually for the manor of Godmanchester, Huntingdonshire.<br>
<br>In a short lifetime Robert de Ferrers had broken one of the greatest of baronial families by his ill-judged actions and contributed to the rise of another by the conferment of his lands on Edmund, earl of Lancaster. Like his enemies&#151;Edward, the future king, and Simon de Montfort&#151;he was quick to resort to violence, but unlike them he was unable to justify violence by any appeal to principle. Isolated by the pursuit of his own interests, he found himself without a party in a dangerously polarized political world, and, in combination with the ruthlessness of his opponents and his own lack of political intelligence, that was the cause of his downfall.<br>
