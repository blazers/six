<span class="headword">Plunkett,  Joseph Mary</span>  (1887&#150;1916), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist and poet</span>, was born in November 1887 at 42 Upper Mount Street, Dublin, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54747/', "George Noble Plunkett (1851&#150;1948)")</script>, academic, politician, and papal count, and his wife, Josephine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cranny (1858&#150;1944). He received a Jesuit education at the Catholic University School, and later at Belvedere College. At eighteen, he began the two-year philosophy course at Stonyhurst College, where he became particularly interested by the mystics, especially St John of the Cross, John Tauler, St Teresa, and St Catherine of Siena. At Stonyhurst Plunkett wrote his first poetry, influenced both by his readings in mysticism and a sense of deepening nationalist conviction. In 1910 he began to study Gaelic in preparation for the matriculation examinations at University College, Dublin. His tutor, the poet Thomas MacDonagh, taught at St Enda's School in Rathfarnham, which he had helped Padraic Pearse to found. The two became close friends, and when MacDonagh set up a literary journal, the <span class="italic">Irish Review</span>, with James Stephens and Padraic Colum in 1911, he published some of Plunkett's first poems.<br>
<br>Plunkett had contracted tuberculosis, and he spent winter 1910 and the early months of 1911 trying to improve his health in the Mediterranean and Algeria, where he studied Arabic and Sanskrit. MacDonagh corresponded with him, exchanging poems and keeping his friend in touch with political developments. Both poets resisted the pagan, occult tone Yeats and George Russell were giving to modern Irish literature, and instead strove to write a devoutly Catholic Irish poetry. Later that year MacDonagh edited and supervised the publication of Plunkett's first collection of poems, <span class="italic">The Circle and the Sword</span>. Profoundly critical of his own work, Plunkett would have rejected many poems in the collection, but the publisher, George Roberts, demanded bulk. However, the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> praised the poems for showing &#145;a certain mystical force and that type of imagination which belongs to the Irish school&#146;  (<span class="italic">TLS</span>, 21 Dec 1911, 536).<br>
<br>When Plunkett returned from Algiers in 1912 he helped MacDonagh and Edward Martyn to found the Irish Theatre in Hardwicke Street, producing plays by Martyn, Ibsen, and Chekhov in pointed contrast to the &#145;peasant plays&#146; at Yeats's Abbey  (Plunkett, quoted in Plunkett Dillon, foreword, vii). He became increasingly involved in cultural nationalist circles, in June 1913 paying the debts and taking over the editorship of the <span class="italic">Irish Review</span> from Padraic Colum. Under Plunkett's direction the literary magazine became increasingly politicized, supporting Arthur Griffith's Sinn F&eacute;in, and James Connolly over the 1913 lock-out strike. Later that year Plunkett attended the founding meeting of the Irish Volunteers at the Rotunda. Elected to the provisional committee, he explained that his ill health would make him a poor soldier, but offered to place the <span class="italic">Irish Review</span> at the volunteers' disposal.<br>
<br>In November 1914 Plunkett ran a particularly incendiary issue, opening with a &#145;manifesto of the Irish Volunteers&#146;, and &#145;Twenty plain facts for Irishmen&#146;. Copies were seized under the <span class="roman">Defence of the Realm Act</span>, effectively bankrupting the paper. Turning from propaganda to direct action, Plunkett travelled to Germany shortly before Easter 1915 as the volunteers' representative to help Roger Casement negotiate German assistance for the rising. His journal of his travels gleefully details his self-dramatizing counter-espionage strategies, including conveying news of the German promise to supply arms and ammunition to his sister Geraldine through a prearranged coded Latin inscription on a copy of Italian folk-tales. Back in Dublin for Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa's funeral in August 1915, he was appointed to the military council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. In September he left for New York to inform Clan na Gael of rebellion plans, there impressing Padraic Colum with his air of decision and command. On his return he was elected director of military operations.<br>
<br>During 1915 Plunkett fell in love with the artist and his fellow nationalist Grace Evelyn Mary Vandeleur Gifford (1888&#150;1955), sister-in-law to MacDonagh, and the couple became engaged in December that year, Gifford having converted to Catholicism. The marriage planned for Easter Sunday was forestalled by the rising, which began the following day. Plunkett was convalescent from a major throat operation earlier that month, yet spent the rising in the General Post Office (GPO) where by all accounts he acted with a bravery incommensurate with his poor health. He was a signatory to the proclamation of the provisional government of the Irish republic. A sheaf of his poems was lost, presumed destroyed as the GPO burned down.<br>
<br>Plunkett was taken to Kilmainham gaol, where he was court-martialled and sentenced to death, despite his advanced tuberculosis. In a final gesture which did much to ignite public sympathy for the rising, he married Grace Gifford on 3 May 1916 by candlelight in Kilmainham chapel, attended by two armed soldiers. At two o'clock the following morning Grace was allowed to see her husband for ten minutes in his cell &#145;packed with officers and a sergeant with a watch in his hand&#146;  (quoted in McCoole, 33). Plunkett was executed by firing squad later that day.<br>
<br>Plunkett's reputation as a poet was posthumous. Later in 1916 his sister Geraldine Dillon prefaced and edited <span class="italic">Poems of Joseph Mary Plunkett</span>, with a frontispiece drawing from memory by Grace Gifford, which ran to three editions within the year. The <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> confessed itself bemused by the poet's messianic nationalism, noting that &#145;our attention is half-distracted from the verses themselves by that blind rebellion in which he lost his life&#146;  (<span class="italic">TLS</span>, 7 Dec 1916, 583). The later poems in particular invited such distraction, one beginning &#145;There is no deed I would not dare&#146;. Another, dedicated to Kathleen ni Houlihan, &#145;The little black rose shall be red at last&#146;, imagined sexual union with the feminized spirit of Ireland, ending<blockquote>
<div>Praise God if this my blood fulfils the doom<br>
</div>
<div>When you, dark rose, shall redden into bloom.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Many were recognizably love poems to Grace Gifford. The well-known &#145;I see his blood upon the rose&#146;, uniting a quasi-mystical religious faith with patriotism, became much anthologized, and a standard text in Irish schools. His early death at twenty-eight prompted critics to class him as promising rather than accomplished.<br>
