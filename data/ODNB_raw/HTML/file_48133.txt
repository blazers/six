<span class="headword">Rae,  George</span>  (1817&#150;1902), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born in Aberdeen on 21 October 1817, the son of George Rae (1782&#150;1867), messenger at arms, and his wife, Jean Edmond Rae (1785&#150;1862). He was educated at the Classical and Commercial Academy, Aberdeen, then briefly apprenticed to a local lawyer. In 1836 Rae was recruited as branch accountant at the Peterhead office of the newly established North of Scotland Bank, Aberdeen, and was subsequently moved to that bank's new branches at Keith and Elgin. Rae then looked for opportunities in England and Wales, where provincial banking was expanding at a rapid rate. In April 1839 he successfully applied for the post of inspector at the North and South Wales Bank, Liverpool, at an annual salary of &pound;130. The &#145;Wales Bank&#146; was one of the more enterprising new banks, operating both in agricultural and industrial districts and claiming that it &#145;combined the best features of the Scotch system&#146;  (HSBC Group Archives, M139, March 1836). By 1839 the Wales Bank had opened thirteen branches, mostly in north Wales.<br>
<br>Rae's abilities and his experience of Scottish branch banking soon earned him promotion. On 13 March 1841 he married Elspet Kynoch of Keith, Banffshire. In 1842 he became manager at Oswestry, Shropshire, and in 1845 he was appointed general manager of the Wales Bank at the age of only twenty-eight. Within two years, however, he faced the largest single crisis in the bank's career. In the commercial crisis of October 1847 the London money market suspended the discount of bills drawn on country banks. In Liverpool this suspension led to the failures of the Royal Bank and the Liverpool Banking Company and, on 22 October, a London newspaper reported that the Wales Bank had also stopped payment. The report was false but the panic was renewed and two days later the Wales Bank was forced to stop payments.<br>
<br>In the aftermath of the crisis Rae quickly set about the reconstruction of the bank. New preference shares were issued, depositors were asked to accept postdated bills, and a number of Welsh branches were closed. These efforts allowed the bank to re-open in January 1848 and to begin a gradual recovery. In particular Rae sought new earnings from Liverpool business rather than from the branch network in Wales. &#145;Town branches&#146; were opened in the Liverpool region&#151;an early example of suburban branch banking outside London. Rae also pioneered a savings scheme for dockers in Birkenhead, giving the bank a local reputation as &#145;the tradesman's bank&#146;. These initiatives, along with strict financial controls, stabilized earnings and allowed the Wales Bank to ride the severe banking crises of 1857 and 1865. Between 1850 and 1865, when Rae was promoted managing director at an annual salary of &pound;2000, the bank's total deposits increased fivefold to &pound;1.5 million.<br>
<br>Rae's first wife died about 1851, leaving two sons, George Bertram and Edward (chairman of the Liverpool stock exchange, 1894&#150;1915), and a daughter, Alice. On 26 April 1855 he married his second wife, Julia (<i>b</i>. 1834/5), daughter of John Williams of Ferryside, Carmarthenshire.<br>
<br>Rae's career at the Wales Bank entered its most creative phase in the 1870s. In north Wales he negotiated the take-overs of the banking firms of Williams &amp; Son in 1873, Cassons &amp; Co. in 1875 and the Bala Banking Company in 1877. Then, as chairman and managing director from 1873, he upgraded the bank's financial systems and managerial structure. In the downturn after the City of Glasgow Bank collapse in 1878, he also reformed the Wales Bank's investment policies and took close control over advances and cash management. The bank's total deposits increased strongly from approximately &pound;2 million in 1870 to &pound;6.6 million by 1890, and shareholders received dividends of 17.5 per cent throughout that period. Meanwhile the bank's business continued to diversify away from its original agricultural base towards industrial, shipping, and commercial business in the Liverpool region.<br>
<br>In the 1890s Rae took a less active role in the management of the bank and he retired in March 1898. By then the bank had established a network of seventy-seven branches and held total deposits of &pound;7.8 million, placing it among the largest provincial banks in England and Wales. The bank was acquired by the Midland Bank (now HSBC Bank plc) in 1908.<br>
<br>Rae was an authoritative figure in the Victorian banking community. In 1874 he was a founder of the Association of Country Bankers, where he remained a dominant influence until his retirement. He was also a founder and trustee of the Institute of Bankers in 1879 and four years later, as a vice-president, he inaugurated an institute prize for the best essay on bank bookkeeping. In later life he remained committed to the development of the banking profession; in 1902 he established a prize in practical banking for entrants in the institute's examinations and also endowed a lectureship in banking and currency at the University College of North Wales, Bangor.<br>
<br>Rae was equally active as a spokesman for banking interests. He gave evidence to the 1875 parliamentary select committee on banks of issue and in 1879 he intervened to influence the &#145;reserved liability&#146; legislation which was introduced after the City of Glasgow Bank failure, providing a bridge between limited liability and shareholder risk. He urged the more widespread publication of bank balance sheets as part of this legislation, believing that &#145;a strong balance sheet, I feel persuaded, attracts business&#146;  (HSBC Group Archives, M222, July 1891).<br>
<br>Rae's most durable influence on banking was as an author. His anonymous contributions to the <span class="italic">Bankers' Magazine</span> in the late 1840s were published as <span class="italic">The Internal Management of a Country Bank</span> (1850) and then reappeared (in his own name) as part of his classic textbook <span class="italic">The Country Banker: his Clients, Cares and Work</span> (1885). This guide to practical banking, written in a direct and persuasive style, won an international reputation&#151;several pirate editions appeared in the USA&#151;and it was published in ten editions between 1885 and 1976.<br>
<br>Rae was popular with staff, shareholders, customers, and other bankers. &#145;His dignified courtesy and kindliness were universal&#146;, a junior colleague recalled; &#145;he had the rare gift of placing any young man entirely at his ease and to make him feel that he counted for something&#146;  (R. O. Williams to T. B. Handley, 26 March 1930, HSBC Group Archives, Rae personal file). His portrait by Frank Holl (1884) shows a bearded figure with a relaxed, almost expansive bearing.<br>
<br>Outside banking, Rae's activities and interests were more colourful than those of many contemporary bankers. In the 1860s he was prominent in two companies which attempted to exploit shale and cannel deposits in Flintshire to produce paraffin oil. These enterprises had failed by the 1870s, costing Rae heavily in time and resources. In private life&#151;despite poor health from the 1860s onwards&#151;he was an enthusiastic traveller and student of the arts. He and his family undertook tours of Europe, Russia, and the Middle East and Rae's diary of these travels was published privately in 1891. He was also a champion of the Pre-Raphaelite school of painting. He was a friend and patron of Ford Madox Brown and Edward Burne-Jones and he was especially proud of his link with Dante Gabriel Rossetti: &#145;I was one of the few who recognized his genius from the first&#146;  (Macleod, 18). Rae's large collection included nineteen paintings by Rossetti (notably <span class="italic">The Beloved</span>, 1863), six by Madox Brown, and twenty-six by William Davis. The Raes' home, Redcourt, Devonshire Place, Claughton, Cheshire, was designed by Edmund Kirby and built between 1876 and 1879. Rae died there on 4 August 1902 and was buried at Flaybrick Hill cemetery on 6 August.<br>
