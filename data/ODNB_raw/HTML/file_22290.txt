<span class="headword">Pinckard,  George</span>  (1768&#150;1835), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was the third son of Henry Pinckard of Handley Hall, Northamptonshire, and his second wife, Rachel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilkins. After tuition by a clergyman relative and a country medical practitioner, he studied medicine first at the then united hospitals of St Thomas's and Guy's, then at Edinburgh University, and finally at Leiden, where he graduated MD on 20 June 1792. He visited hospitals in Paris and Geneva and lived briefly with his brother and sister at Copet, near Geneva, and witnessed the capture of the city by the French under General Montesquieu. On 30 September 1794 he was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, in London.<br>
<br>In October 1795 Pinckard was appointed a physician to the army, and in that capacity he accompanied Sir Ralph Abercromby's expedition to the West Indies, reaching Carlisle Bay, Barbados, on 13 February 1796, after many delays. Having served in the West Indies and South America he then returned to England via the United States. In his <span class="italic">Notes on the West Indies</span> (3 vols., 1806), which were originally written as letters to a friend, he describes at great length what he saw in the West Indies and Guiana, often dwelling upon the horrifying incidents of slavery which he witnessed. He also makes some remarks on yellow fever. The book ran to two editions.<br>
<br>In 1798 Pinckard was in Ireland, and in the rebellion of that year he served on the staff of General Hulse. He was promoted to be deputy inspector-general of hospitals, and had part of the direction of the medical service in the duke of York's expedition to The Helder. After his return his residence was 99 Great Russell Street, London, and he then moved to Bloomsbury Square, where he lived until his death. He married, in Edinburgh on 27 June 1817, Lucy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Eastwood.<br>
<br>Pinckard was one of the principal founders of the Bloomsbury Dispensary for the relief of the sick poor at 62 Great Russell Street, which opened on 26 October 1801, and he was sole physician to it from 1801 to 1835. Dr Richard Pinckard was his successor, from 1835 to 1845. Another relative, George Henry Pinckard (1805&#150;1892), nephew of George, was a benefactor to the dispensary, which in its early years relied heavily on the family.<br>
<br>In 1824 Pinckard founded the Medical, Clerical and General Life Assurance Office to provide life assurance to those &#145;subject to such deviations from the common standard of health, as do not eventually shorten life&#146;. Renamed Clerical, Medical and General in 1825 (and later Clerical Medical), the society was initially based at 32 Great Russell Street before a move to 4 Southampton Street (1827), and 78 Great Russell Street. During this period Pinckard served as the society's first chairman; his brother Joseph (1766&#150;1866) was its first secretary and his nephew the first policyholder.<br>
<br>Pinckard published in 1819 accounts of four cases of &#145;hydrophobia&#146;, in which he recommended immediate excision or cauterization of the whole wound. In 1835 he published <span class="italic">Suggestions for Restoring the Moral Character and the Industrious Habits of the Poor</span> recommending the replacement of workhouses with farms, thereby allegedly reducing the poor rates. He had long had angina pectoris, when he died in an attack while at work in his consulting room on 15 May 1835; he was survived by his wife.<br>
