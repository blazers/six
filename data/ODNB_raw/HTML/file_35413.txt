<span class="headword">Paton, Sir  (Joseph) No&euml;l</span>  (1821&#150;1901), <span class="occ">history painter</span>, was born on 13 December 1821 at Wooer's Alley Cottage, Wooer's Alley, Dunfermline, the second of three children of Joseph Neil Paton (1797&#150;1874), damask designer and manufacturer, and his wife, Catherine MacDiarmid (<i>d</i>. 1853). All three children followed their father into the business before pursuing artistic careers. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21561/', "Waller Hugh Paton (1828&#150;1895)")</script> became a landscape painter, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47294/', "Amelia Robertson Hill (1820&#150;1904)")</script>, a sculptor. Paton was educated at Dunfermline School and Dunfermline Art Academy, where his father was master from 1830 to 1833. In 1838 he accepted the post of director of the design department at W. Sharp &amp; Co.'s sewed muslin factory at Paisley, where he remained for three years. In 1843 Paton left Dunfermline to become a student at the Royal Academy Schools in London. He stayed only a few months; indeed, throughout his life he seldom left Scotland, visiting Europe on only one occasion in 1863. However, though he spent only a little time at the Royal Academy Schools, throughout his career Paton remained faithful to the academic precept of heroic subject matter, particularly as expressed through the male nude.<br>
<br>During his stay in London, Paton made influential contacts. He met John Everett Millais, who was to become a lifelong friend, and entered the circle of Samuel Carter Hall, editor of the <span class="italic">Art-Union</span> and <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, who commissioned illustrations for his <span class="italic">Book of British Ballads</span> (1842&#150;4) and introduced him to the work of German illustrators such as Moritz Retzch, further confirming the linearity of Paton's style. Paton's first successes were in book illustration, with designs for Shelley's <span class="italic">Prometheus Unbound</span> (1844) and Shakespeare's <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> (1845), and he continued to produce illustrations throughout his career, most notably his designs for Coleridge's <span class="italic">Rime of the Ancient Mariner</span> (1863) and the collected volume of his illustrations to Shakespeare published in 1904.<br>
<br>In 1845 Paton submitted a cartoon for a large allegorical design, <span class="italic">The Spirit of Religion</span> (Dunfermline Corporation), to the Westminster Hall competition for designs to decorate the new houses of parliament, where it won a prize of 200 guineas. This design anticipated the religious and allegorical subject matter that dominated his work from the 1860s; however, his first successes as a painter came from literary and historical subjects. In 1847 <span class="italic">The Reconciliation of Oberon and Titania</span> won &pound;300 at the second Westminster Hall competition, and was immediately bought by the Royal Scottish Academy. Two years later its pendant, <span class="italic">The Quarrel of Oberon and Titania</span>, was purchased by the Royal Association for the Promotion of Fine Arts in Scotland, and both works were given to the National Gallery of Scotland. These, together with <span class="italic">The Fairy Raid</span> (1867; Glasgow Art Gallery), are now his best-known works, and have come to be seen as principal examples of the genre of Victorian fairy painting. Yet at the time Paton was urged by his friend David Octavius Hill, secretary of the Royal Scottish Academy, to desist from fairy painting, lest the &#145;asinine multitude&#146; think &#145;that you can do nothing else, and that you are raving mad&#146;  (Irwin and Irwin, 292).<br>
<br>During the 1850s Paton was influenced by the work of the Pre-Raphaelites, as can be seen in the minutely observed natural detail of <span class="italic">The Bluidie Tryste</span> (1855; Glasgow Museums and Art Gallery) and in the historical accuracy of <span class="italic">Dawn: Luther at Erfurt</span> (1861; NG Scot.). Perhaps their most striking influence was in stimulating Paton's short-lived interest in serious modern-life subjects: <span class="italic">Home from the Crimea: the Soldier's Return</span> (exh. RA, 1856; copy, 1859, Royal Collection) was an instantly popular, sentimental treatment of a topical theme. However, his second essay in a modern subject, <span class="italic">In Memoriam</span> (1858; priv. coll.) was widely criticized. This depicts a scene from the Indian mutiny, and shows frightened and cowering British women and children hiding in a cellar, with soldiers descending to their rescue. Originally the soldiers were sepoys, but were over-painted with a Highland regiment after intense public criticism. <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, for example, thought it &#145;cruel and in woful [<i>sic</i>] bad taste. It should never have been hung&#146;  (8 May 1858).<br>
<br>On 17 June 1858 Paton married Margaret Gourlay (<i>d</i>. 1900), daughter of Alexander Ferrier of Bloomhill, Dunbartonshire, and moved to Edinburgh, in 1859 settling at 33 George Square, where the couple lived for the rest of their lives. They had seven sons and four daughters, who often served as models for their father; the eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35409/', "Diarmid No&#235;l Paton (1859&#150;1928)")</script>, was a noted physiologist. The need to provide for his family increasingly preoccupied Paton, significantly influencing his choice of subject matter in the direction of religious paintings, from which he could earn money from the sale of prints. However, Paton's view of his own vocation as that of a religious painter is implied by his poem &#145;A Confession&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>Heart, mind, and soul, with reverent love confess<br>
</div>
<div>The Christian Painter, sent to purify and bless.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Poems by a Painter</span>, 1861, 56)</blockquote>Paton's religious works were also influenced by his father's beliefs: originally a Methodist, Joseph Neil became first a Quaker and then a Swedenborgian. For example, the Swedenborgian belief in the equal reality of supernatural and material worlds found expression in allegorical works such as <span class="italic">Mors janua vitae</span> (1866; priv. coll.).<br>
<br>The popular taste for engravings of Paton's religious works formed the basis for his later success, much of which was due to the astute marketing of his work by his dealers, Henry Doig and McKenzie of George Street and Hugh Paton &amp; Sons of Princes Street, Edinburgh, and Haydon Hare of Scarborough. These firms bought both paintings and their copyright, publicized them in the press, displayed them in touring exhibitions with special gas lighting, and finally sold engravings of the pictures. The popularity of such works as <span class="italic">The Man of Sorrows</span> (1875; Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne) testifies to a widespread taste for monumental and didactic religious art diffused through engraved reproductions. The publication of several sermons using Paton's pictures as a &#145;text&#146;, such as the Revd Fergus Ferguson's <span class="italic">&#145;The Choice&#146;: a Discourse Preached in Glasgow on Sir Noel Paton's Great Picture</span> (1888), shows how Paton's later work found an audience outside those who visited the annual exhibitions, and quite distinct in its preferences from the connoisseurs who formed the &#145;advanced&#146; taste for aestheticism and classical subject pictures.<br>
<br>In 1863 Paton spent several weeks at Windsor working on sketches of the queen and her children for a memorial to Prince Albert, but this remained unfinished, owing partly to Paton's ill health and partly to his inaptitude for portraiture. Nevertheless, in 1867 he was knighted and appointed queen's limner for Scotland. In 1881 he was awarded an honorary degree of LLD by Edinburgh University. Paton was strikingly handsome with bright red hair; his prodigious work rate was made possible by great physical strength, &#145;almost Herculean in breadth of shoulder and depth of chest&#146;  (Story, 127). He died at his home on 26 December 1901, and was buried in the Dean cemetery, Edinburgh.<br>
