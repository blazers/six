<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lye,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1694, <em>d.</em> 1767), <span class="occ">Anglo-Saxon and Gothic scholar</span>, was baptized at St Mary's, Totnes, Devon, on 6 September 1694, the ninth of twelve children of Thomas Lye (<i>bap</i>. 1655, <i>d</i>. 1710/11), vicar of Broadhempston (instituted 4 May 1705) and schoolmaster of Totnes grammar school, and his wife, Katherine Johnson (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1660, <i>d</i>. in or after 1736). He described his father to Thomas Percy as &#145;a good Classical Scholar &hellip; yet an indolent Schoolmaster&#146;  (Percy, fol. 258<i>r</i>) who left his family poorly off. He first attended his father's school, but received little tuition there; later he attended a grammar school at Crewkerne, in Somerset, where he had family and where the master was a man of good reputation named Leaves. Although he suffered ill health during these years and was forced to spend some time at home his studies proceeded more surely than they had at Totnes. He was admitted a servitor of Hart Hall, Oxford, and matriculated from the university on 28 March 1713. He graduated BA on 19 October 1716 and MA on 6 July 1722, and was incorporated at Cambridge University in 1724. While at Hart Hall he won the friendship and patronage of the principal, Dr Richard Newton, and the vice-principal, his tutor John Davys, who was also, from 1719 to 1740, rector of Castle Ashby, Northamptonshire, seat of the earl of Northampton and one of the closest parishes to Little Houghton and Yardley Hastings, where Lye held successive livings. <br>
<br>Lye was ordained deacon at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 17 March 1716 by Edmund Gibson, bishop of Lincoln and a noted Anglo-Saxonist, and priest on 20 September 1719 at Peterborough by White Kennett, another Saxonist. He spent a short time as a curate at Melchborne, in Bedfordshire, and was nearly a year in a second curacy at Orlingbury, Northamptonshire, before being presented to the vicarage of Little Houghton in the same county by a wealthy local patron, William Ward (instituted 13 October and inducted 3 December 1720). He resigned this position in 1749. On 6 October 1737 he was presented to the more lucrative rectory of Yardley Hastings by James, earl of Northampton, and inducted on 10 October. He never married and remained rector of Yardley Hastings for the rest of his life. Though based in rural Northamptonshire he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances, comprising fellow scholars in Britain and Europe (especially in Sweden), fellow clergymen, and members of the nobility who were patrons of learning. From 1756 until his death he was mentor and friend of Thomas Percy, vicar of the neighbouring parish of Easton Maudit, and helped him with several of his publications, including <span class="italic">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</span> (1765). <br>
<br>Between about 1730 and his first published work, an edition of Franciscus Junius's manuscript etymological dictionary of the English language, <span class="italic">Etymologicum Anglicanum</span> (1743), Lye set himself the task of learning Old English and Gothic, together with something of the other early Germanic languages, and, he confided to Thomas Hearne in a letter of 1732, &#145;I have a mind to turn Editor&#146;  (E. Lye to T. Hearne, 9 June 1732, Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. lett. 7, fol. 320<i>r</i>). This he did, adding material of his own and a short Old English grammar to Junius's Bodleian manuscript dictionary. This handsome publication was supported by James Compton, fifth earl of Northampton, and printed at the Sheldonian Theatre, Oxford. Lye also turned his attention to Gothic and by late 1732 he had &#145;read over the Gothick Gospels &hellip; and drawn up a Grammar of that Language&#146;, as he tells Hearne  (Lye to Hearne, n.d. [1732], Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. lett. 7, fol. 321<i>r</i>). Thus when in the late 1730s the Swedish Archbishop Eric Benzelius the younger (1675&#150;1743) was seeking someone to complete and publish his edition of the <span class="italic">Codex Argenteus</span> of the Gothic gospels in Uppsala University Library his English contacts, including Sir Hans Sloane and Lord Granville, informed him that Lye was the natural choice. Benzelius's edition, with preface, additions, and a Gothic grammar by Lye, was published by the University of Oxford in 1750. In January of the same year Lye was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. <br>
<br>Lye died at the rectory, Yardley Hastings, of gout, from which he had suffered for many years, on 19 August 1767, aged seventy-three. He was buried on 21 August 1767 in St Andrew's, the parish church, where there is a plain grave slab to his memory in the chancel floor, to the right of the altar, with a memorial inscription composed by his friend Thomas Hunt, professor of Hebrew at Oxford. It speaks of his character as a man of simplicity, openness, and probity, yet one of great erudition and outstanding knowledge in the fields of Northern languages and antiquities. <br>
<br>Lye's reputation as a scholar of Anglo-Saxon and Gothic was high in his own day, both in Britain and in Europe, but became obscured by early nineteenth-century philologists like J. M. Kemble and Joseph Bosworth, who were keen to make a distinction between their own, German-influenced scholarship and that of their predecessors. Yet after the high point in Anglo-Saxon scholarship established by George Hickes, Humfrey Wanley, and their colleagues in the early eighteenth century Lye was the only significant scholar in this field before the nineteenth-century philologists, and they used his work as the basis for their own. This is particularly true in the area of lexicography: Lye's posthumously published <span class="italic">Dictionarium Saxonico et Gothico-Latinum</span> (1772), which was completed by his friend Owen Manning, was the material basis upon which Bosworth constructed his Anglo-Saxon dictionary (1838), and this formed the foundation for T. Northcote Toller's enlarged <span class="italic">Anglo-Saxon Dictionary</span> of 1898. Lye and Manning added significantly to the vocabulary of Old English prose and poetry, and their work greatly assisted early nineteenth-century editors. One poetic project that Lye worked on with Oxford colleagues, but which was never published for lack of funding, was an edition, with illustrations and a Latin translation (Lye's contribution), of the Junius manuscript of Old English poetry  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Junius 11). Lye's translation was inherited after his death by Thomas Percy and burnt in a fire at Northumberland House in 1780.<br>
