<span class="headword">Maton,  Robert</span>  (<em>b. </em>1606/7, <em>d.</em> in or after 1646), <span class="occ">religious writer</span>, was the second son of William Maton of North Tidworth, Wiltshire, and his wife, Thomazin Hayter of Langford. He entered Wadham College, Oxford, as a commoner at Michaelmas 1623 and matriculated, aged nineteen, on 3 November 1626, graduating BA on 25 October 1627 and MA on 10 June 1630. Very little else is known of his life, although he is reported to have taken holy orders.<br>
<br>In 1642 Maton published a notable work, <span class="italic">Israel's Redemption</span>, which predicted the coming millennium. It was clearly much influenced by Joseph Mede, the Cambridge biblical scholar who had sought to systematize and render mutually consistent the apocalyptic prophecies of the books of <span class="roman">Daniel</span> and <span class="roman">Revelation</span>. Maton was supremely confident that the days of Satan's &#145;pompous clergy, of his princely and magistracy mastering pontiffs&#146; were numbered, and that those of the millennium approached: for<blockquote>it is not to be doubted but that God will have the victory in the end, and the longer, and more eagerly any truth of his hath been opposed and supprest, the more suddenly and more powerfully shall she break forth again, to the amazement and confusion of her adversaries.</blockquote>Christ would soon return to establish his reign on earth, and the Jews would share in its spiritual riches: &#145;both Jew and gentile are sick in the same disease &hellip; never will the happiness of either receive perfection &hellip; till both are folded together&#146;  (Maton, <span class="italic">Israel's Redemption</span>, preface).<br>
<br>Maton's book was published in London, but his ideas had their greatest initial impact among the independent congregations of the Netherlands: such was their influence that Alexander Petrie, minister of the Scottish church at Rotterdam, felt impelled to launch an attack, signed in August 1644 within a year of his arrival, upon Maton's literalist interpretation of the prophecies. Maton countered in December 1646 with a lengthy response, <span class="italic">Israel's Redemption Redeemed</span>, later republished as <span class="italic">Christ's Personall Reign on Earth One Thousand Years</span> (1652). Maton's ideas were influential during the English Commonwealth. His response to Petrie was republished again in 1655 as <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Fifth Monarchy</span>, though he is not known to have been associated with the Fifth Monarchists. It may be that he died shortly afterwards, for nothing more is heard of him.<br>
