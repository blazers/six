<span class="headword">Whitbourne, Sir  Richard</span>  (1561&#150;1635), <span class="occ">seaman and publicist for Newfoundland</span>, was born and baptized on 11 June 1561 at Bishopsteignton near Newton Abbot in Devon, the son of John Whitbourne, yeoman, and his wife, Agnes. Serving as an apprentice between 1575 and 1583, probably to John Crooke, merchant adventurer of Southampton, he had voyaged to much of western Europe before sailing to Newfoundland in 1579 in search of whales and trade with the natives. For the next forty years he was a frequent visitor, witnessing Sir Humphrey Gilbert's formal annexation of the island in St John's harbour in 1583, and Sir Bernard Drake's capture of Portuguese fishing ships there in 1585. He was commended by the lord high admiral Lord Howard of Effingham for his services in commanding his own ship and three others against the Armada in 1588. In 1612 he was captured by &#145;that famous Arch-Pirate&#146; Peter Easton, who was freely impressing fishermen and appropriating their supplies and catches  (Cell, <span class="italic">Newfoundland</span>, 113). Yet once home he supported Easton's elusive search for a pardon. In 1614 he observed the depredations of the privateer-turned-pirate Henry Mainwaring.<br>
<br>In response to these losses, and perhaps upon the representations of the London and Bristol Company (1610), which was promoting settled plantations in Newfoundland, Whitbourne was commissioned by the court of admiralty in 1615 to inquire into alleged abuses in the fishery. That summer, at his own expense, he equipped a ship and crew of eleven, and convened courts of vice-admiralty in the harbours between Trinity Bay and Ferryland. His judicial circuit was the first attempt to institute formal courts in Newfoundland. He adjudicated disputes and received presentments from 170 of the 250 English captains who were fishing there. This documentation and his report, which have not survived, are summarized in his <span class="italic">Discourse and Discovery of New-Found-Land</span>, which went into 3 editions in 1620&#150;23. The abuses he reported reflected the views of his witnesses: non-observance of the sabbath; the indiscriminate dumping of ballast in the harbours; theft of supplies left to overwinter: boats, salt, casks, fishing stages, drying flakes, bait, and even the catch, predominantly cod and cod oil; the appropriation of overly large fishing rooms (waterlots); the use, contrary to statute, of foreign bottoms in the trade; the destruction of timber; and lazy seamen. Like the complaints regulated by John Guy, as governor of the colony of Cupids in Conception Bay in 1611, Whitbourne's efforts were ignored by the visiting fishermen, their west country employers, and the government.<br>
<br>His experience in 1615 helped to turn Whitbourne, despite his continuing participation in the fishery, into an advocate of colonization. Anthony Parkhurst in the 1570s and Sir Humphrey Gilbert and Edward Hayes in the 1580s had tried to make the case for settlement, but none had Whitbourne's unique combination of experience and practicality. In 1618 he sailed to Renews, south of Ferryland, as governor of the colony established the previous year by William Vaughan, the first independent entrepreneur to purchase land from the London and Bristol Company. Finding the settlers living in temporary shelters and in hopeless disarray, he reorganized the colony. However, it did not long survive his departure the following spring. Three years later he was advising Henry Cary, Viscount Falkland, on his plans for a colony, visiting the subsequent settlement at Renews at least twice before 1626. He was knighted by Falkland (in his capacity as lord deputy of Ireland) in 1625. The next year he sought the patronage of the duke of Buckingham. In 1627 he was serving as lieutenant on the warship <i>Bonaventure</i>, but drowned at sea in 1635. His wife, Joanne, whom he married about 1585, had predeceased him in 1620 and was buried in Littleham, Devon. The couple had two daughters, Joan and Katherine.<br>
<br>Whitbourne's historical significance rests on his <span class="italic">Discourse</span>. To the second edition in 1622 he added &#145;A loving invitation &hellip; to all adventurers &hellip; for the advancement of his majesties most hopeful plantation in the new-found-land&#146;. Unlike most contemporaries, who saw a contradiction between the seasonal migratory fishery and settlement, he argued that they were complementary imperial resources. The fishery was a cheap source of protein, a staple which could be exchanged for expensive Mediterranean goods, a &#145;seminary for fishers&#146; and sailors for the Royal Navy, and a generator of industrial and agricultural supplies and employment at home. Settlement would extend the fishing season, permit the more efficient use of manpower, and lower costs. The island would yield up foodstuffs and minerals, especially iron. It offered an outlet for overpopulation at home and a strategic way station to Virginia. The result would be wealth and glory for the crown, entrepreneurs, and the nation.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Discourse</span> is a lively and practical guide to the climate, topography, vegetation, Native Americans, wildlife, and resources of the island. Detailed recommendations for extending and rationalizing the trade are supplemented by an analysis of costs and prospective profits, and an inventory for equipping a fishing vessel of 100 tons and forty planters. In a few cases Whitbourne was too optimistic. Newfoundland's climate was not benign, and it had a short growing season. Pervasive fog was not to be eliminated by burning off damp underbrush, and tobacco was unlikely to thrive. But these are minor miscalculations in a manual informed by experience, evidence, and enthusiasm; and by humour, as he notes the benefits of mosquitoes (black flies) in encouraging idle men to work, and his sighting of a mermaid in St John's harbour in 1610.<br>
<br>State officials who were increasingly interested in imperial expansion took note. Whitbourne was granted permanent copyright over the <span class="italic">Discourse</span>. In 1621 the privy council requested that each parish have a copy and take up a collection to recognize his services and help defray his expenses, estimated by him for his books alone at &pound;240. Parishioners might even be canvassed in their homes. Described by the nationalist historian Prowse in 1895 as &#145;this sturdy old sailor [for whom] every Newfoundlander should feel a deep affection&#146;  (Prowse, 118), he is commemorated by the town of Whitbourne, 50 miles west of St John's.<br>
