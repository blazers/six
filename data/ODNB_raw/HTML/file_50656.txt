<span class="headword">Nathan,  Alec</span>  (1872&#150;1954), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, was born on 24 September 1872 in Wellington, New Zealand, the seventh of eight sons (there were four daughters) of Joseph Edward Nathan (1835&#150;1912) and his wife, Dinah Marks (1838&#150;1893). The family was Jewish. Nathan was educated at Wellington College and Lincoln Agricultural College in New Zealand. His father had founded a merchant house based in Wellington and London called Joseph Nathan &amp; Co., in which the five eldest Nathan sons became partners. Alec Nathan and his brother Frederick (1871&#150;1938), were dairy farming at Palmerston North in New Zealand when in 1903 the family firm bought the rights to a new process for making dried milk powder. The two brothers were enlisted in its commercial development, with Alec taking responsibility for running the new plant at Bunnythorpe which processed the milk into dried powder. This factory began operations in 1904, although it was not until 1906 that the Nathans registered a new trade name of Glaxo for their product.<br>
<br>Nathan emigrated to England in 1907 and was thenceforth increasingly involved in the promotion of Glaxo milk powder. He was convinced that it should be marketed as a superior baby food; in 1908 he launched the annual <span class="italic">Glaxo Babybook</span> as a promotional device, and in 1908&#150;13 he superintended an energetic mail order campaign. He also controlled its press advertising, always writing copy himself: his slogan &#145;Glaxo builds bonnie babies&#146; became a household phrase. He gave meticulous attention to selling to the health departments of municipal authorities. This branch of the business developed considerably during the First World War. He was also keenly involved in expanding sales in Australasia, and in many other foreign markets. The Glaxo milk department was only a small part of the Nathans' mercantile business, and relations between the partners were sometimes volatile.<br>
<br>In 1919 Nathan recruited a young pharmacist, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31286/', "Harry Jephcott")</script>, to the Glaxo department to monitor product quality. He subsequently supported Jephcott in the commercial and scientific strategy of diversifying into vitamin foods in the 1920s. This culminated in the formation in 1935 of a pharmaceutical subsidiary of the Nathan business, Glaxo Laboratories Ltd, with a new factory at Greenford. Nathan was the first chairman of this concern, which during the Second World War became the earliest British pharmaceutical company to produce penicillin. He retired from business in June 1946. Six months later Glaxo Laboratories acquired the assets of its parent company, Joseph Nathan, and began a new phase of its development into the world's largest pharmaceutical multinational.<br>
<br>On 15 April 1909 Nathan married Muriel (1881/2&#150;1961), daughter of Wilfred Marks, formerly proprietor of the general store at Tumut in the Snowy Mountains. They had two sons and a daughter. Nathan died of cancer on 18 October 1954 at the London Clinic, and was cremated at Golders Green. He was an intelligent, benevolent man with a strong ethical sense and an aloof but unassuming manner. Many of his family were rough and quarrelsome, but he was gentle and almost innocent. He was a patriarchial employer given to many private kindnesses and charities. Methodical, determined, and a steady strategist, he believed that business life should be a form of public service, and recoiled from both sharp practice and ostentation. At British general elections he voted Liberal or Labour, but less often Conservative. He thought that nothing was too good for the British and Australasian working class but was indifferent to foreigners. In his domestic life he seemed overshadowed by his socially and culturally ambitious wife. He was awarded the Bledisloe gold medal for New Zealand agriculturalists in 1941, but declined a knighthood.<br>
