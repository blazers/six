<span class="headword">Balfour,  Harold Harington</span>, first Baron Balfour of Inchrye  (1897&#150;1988), <span class="occ">airman, businessman, and politician</span>, was born on 1 November 1897 in Farnham, Surrey, the younger son and second of the three children of Colonel Nigel Harington Balfour OBE, a serving officer, of Belton, Camberley, Surrey, and his wife, Grace Annette Marie, youngest daughter of Henry Robarts Madocks and granddaughter of Field Marshal Baron Napier of Magdala. His elder brother was killed in January 1941 when his ship, HMS <i>Southampton</i>, was sunk in the Mediterranean. Balfour was educated at Chilverton Elms, Dover, Kent, and the Royal Naval College, Osborne. Soon after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, he volunteered for service with the 60th rifles, but his urge to fly encouraged him to transfer to the Royal Flying Corps when a chance was offered the next year. There then began a distinguished, yet hazardous spell as a fighter pilot on the western front, which culminated in his promotion, in 1917, to command a flight in the famous 43 fighter squadron, in which he had served earlier under the command of Major William Sholto Douglas. Once wounded in action and, by temperament, by no means fitted for war, he was awarded the MC and bar for gallantry. He remained with the newly formed Royal Air Force until 1923. In 1921 he married Diana Blanche Harvey (<i>d</i>. 1982), daughter of Sir Robert Grenville Harvey, second baronet; they had one son. The marriage was dissolved in 1946.<br>
<br>Faced with a continuing need to earn a living, Balfour became, initially, a news reporter on the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> before joining Whitehall Securities in the Pearson group in 1925, when the organization was entering the field of commercial aviation. He was also attracted by politics; he stood unsuccessfully as the Conservative candidate for the Stratford division of West Ham, London, in 1924 and was elected in 1929 as member for the Isle of Thanet, Kent, which he represented until 1945, when he was created Baron Balfour of Inchrye, of Shefford in the county of Berkshire.<br>
<br>In 1938, as the Royal Air Force was rearming for war, Balfour accepted Neville Chamberlain's invitation to join the government as parliamentary under-secretary of state for air, first, under Sir H. Kingsley Wood, and later, in Winston Churchill's national government, under Sir Archibald Sinclair. It was an inspired appointment in which he served with signal ability until 1944, often flying himself about in a Spitfire and forming a first-hand judgement of Fighter Command's &#145;big wing&#146; controversy in the battle of Britain.<br>
<br>Balfour adorned the office which he was to hold for six and a half years. His achievements at the Air Ministry were many. Outstanding among them was the establishment, in the spring of 1940, of the great empire air training scheme of which he was a prime instigator and which, in the next five years, was responsible for training more than 130,000 aircrew in countries of the Commonwealth and empire. Its contribution to victory was undoubted. Moreover, his relationship with the Royal Air Force's senior officers, from the chief of the air staff, Sir Charles Portal, and the air staff, to the heads of operational commands, was both effective and forthright, not least because they respected his knowledge of aviation and his own service record in the First World War.<br>
<br>Eventually Churchill, having earlier failed to persuade Balfour to accept, first, the office of financial secretary to the Treasury, and later, a civil department of state (Balfour refused each to remain loyal to the Royal Air Force), in 1944 appointed him resident minister in west Africa; he resigned with the Conservatives in 1945. A senior privy councillor (sworn on 5 August 1941), he remained active in politics for much of his life, speaking frequently for tory friends in the country and often intervening in House of Lords debates. This he combined with his business interests, which included a directorship of British European Airways (BEA) from 1955 to 1966 and chairmanship of BEA Helicopters Ltd in 1964&#150;6. He also held the presidency of the Chambers of Commerce of the British Empire from 1946 to 1949 and of the Commonwealth and Empire Industries Association from 1956 to 1960. His autobiography, <span class="italic">Wings over Westminster</span> (1973), one of his three published works, was well received, reflecting his early training as a Fleet Street journalist and his feeling for words. He wrote touching little stanzas and verses on the back of old envelopes. In 1947 he married his second wife, Mary Ainslie, daughter of Albert Peter Anthony Profumo, barrister; they had one daughter.<br>
<br>An upstanding and attractive man, who was intensely loyal, Balfour was a persuasive speaker on a public platform, his sensitivity and humour enabling him quickly to catch the mood of an audience. His all-round judgement was acute. Although he lived happily in London at End House, St Mary Abbot's Place, Kensington, with his family often around him, his love of fishing and shooting took him regularly to Scotland. There, in his contented twilight years, he once confided in a member of his family: &#145;You know, I would sooner be stone deaf on a grouse moor than able to hear a pin drop in a bath chair.&#146; Balfour died on 21 September 1988 at the King Edward VII Hospital in London. He was succeeded in the barony by his son, Ian (<i>b</i>. 1924).<br>
