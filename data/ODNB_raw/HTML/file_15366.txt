<span class="headword">Kennedy,  Edmund Besley Court</span>  (1818&#150;1848), <span class="occ">surveyor and explorer</span>, was born on 5 September 1818 at St Peter Port, Guernsey, Channel Islands, the sixth of the eight children of Colonel Thomas Kennedy and Mary Ann, daughter of Thomas Smith, sometime lord mayor of London. After attending Elizabeth College, Guernsey, Kennedy trained as a surveyor and then sailed for Australia, arriving in 1840 and being appointed assistant surveyor in the surveyor-general's department in New South Wales. His first task of surveying, in Victoria, ended with his being recalled after a dispute with a local magistrate and an indiscreet liaison with an Irish immigrant, Margaret Murphy, with whom he had a child.<br>
<br>After spending two years with little surveying work in Sydney, Kennedy was suddenly in 1845 appointed second in command of the last exploring expedition conducted by Sir Thomas Livingstone Mitchell in 1846 in search of a route from Sydney to the Gulf of Carpentaria. After maintaining a base camp for some months, in March 1847 Kennedy volunteered to trace the &#145;Victoria&#146; River, which was the furthest point touched by Mitchell in 1846. Starting from Sydney with eight mounted men with led horses, and eight months' provisions, he reached Mitchell's furthest point during an exceptionally dry season, descended the Thomson River, and followed the &#145;Victoria&#146; south-west, showing that it did not flow north-west into the gulf as Mitchell had supposed. After tracing the Warego River and naming the Thomson, Kennedy turned back and reached Sydney in February 1848. Another stream having been named the Victoria, Kennedy renamed Mitchell's &#145;Victoria&#146; by its Aboriginal name, the Barcoo. The narrative of this journey was published in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Geographical Society</span> (1852).<br>
<br>In January 1848 Kennedy started on his last expedition for the exploration of Cape York peninsula. The party, consisting of nine men, with horses, and an Aborigine called Jackey Jackey, set out from Rockingham Bay, and found itself beset with misfortune. Mangrove swamps and mountains made progress slow, as did sickness and a growing shortage of supplies. Kennedy had to leave eight of his men sick at Weymouth Bay while the others tried under his leadership to reach the supply ship. On the subsequent journey one man shot himself accidentally, and the two others had to be left to tend him. Kennedy continued his journey with Jackey Jackey, hoping to reach the vessel at the tip of Cape York. Trapped by crocodile-infested mangrove swamp and hostile Aborigines, Kennedy was attacked and speared, dying on 13 December 1848 in the arms of the faithful Jackey Jackey, who thirteen days afterwards brought the tidings to the steamer <i>Ariel</i> in Albany Bay. Of the other members of the expedition, only two survived to return to Sydney.<br>
<br>An excellent leader, patient and persevering, Kennedy's important geographical discoveries have too often been overshadowed by the tragedy of his last expedition.<br>
