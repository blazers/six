<span class="headword">Playfair, Sir  Nigel Ross</span>  (1874&#150;1934), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born in London on 1 July 1874, the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35541/', "William Smoult Playfair (1835&#150;1903)")</script>, obstetric physician, and his wife, Emily Kitson; there were also three daughters. A paternal uncle was Lyon Playfair, first Baron Playfair of St Andrews; a maternal uncle was James Kitson, first Baron Airedale. He was educated at Winchester (briefly), at Harrow, and at University College, Oxford, where he took a third in modern history (1896) and gained early stage experience with the Oxford University Dramatic Society. He was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1900 but was soon performing with two famous amateur societies, the Old Stagers and the Windsor Strollers.<br>
<br>Playfair's first professional appearance was in July 1902 as Mr Melrose in <span class="italic">A Pair of Knickerbockers</span>. He acted in F. R. Benson's company for a while, touring in the West Indies, chiefly in comic Shakespearian parts. In 1904, at the Royalty, he played his favourite role, that of Ralph, in <span class="italic">The Knight of the Burning Pestle</span> (which he reprised in his own production at the Kingsway in 1920), and, at the Court, Hodson in Shaw's <span class="italic">John Bull's other Island</span> and Bohun in Shaw's <span class="italic">You Never can Tell</span>. He married in 1905 Annie Mabel Platts, the daughter of Francis Thomas Platts, a district superintendent of police in Dacca, India. She was an actress under the name May Martyn. They had three sons. In 1907 Playfair toured with Laurence Irving and, at the Savoy, appeared again in <span class="italic">You Never can Tell</span>, this time as Finch McComas. Through the next eleven years he played a large number of varied roles including Max in Granville Barker's production of the &#145;Anatol&#146; dialogues (1911); Sir Benjamin Backbite in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>, Cayley Drummle in <span class="italic">The Second Mrs Tanqueray</span>, and Cutler Walpole (one of his best roles) in <span class="italic">The Doctor's Dilemma</span> (all 1913); Bottom in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> and Mr Dick in <span class="italic">David Copperfield</span> (both 1914); and Dangle in an operatic version of <span class="italic">The Critic</span> (1916).<br>
<br>In 1918 Playfair formed a syndicate with Arnold Bennett and Alistair Tayler which purchased a long lease of the Lyric, Hammersmith. It was to soon to be transformed from a derelict building in a run-down area to a highly successful drama venue. It opened with A. A. Milne's first play, written for Playfair, <span class="italic">Make Believe</span>, a Christmas entertainment. For its first major production the theatre was cleverly let to Barry Jackson, who brought the Birmingham repertory theatre's <span class="italic">Abraham Lincoln</span>. After opening in February 1919, it ran for over a year, and Playfair's own first Lyric production, <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>, ran for 1463 performances. There followed many successes including <span class="italic">The Way of the World</span>, with Edith Evans, and <span class="italic">The Duenna</span> (both 1924); <span class="italic">Lionel and Clarissa</span>&#151;its first playing since 1768&#151;and <span class="italic">The Rivals</span> (both 1925); <span class="italic">Riverside Nights</span>, a revue co-written with A. P. Herbert (1926); <span class="italic">When Crummles Played</span> and <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span>, again with Evans (both 1927); <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span> and <span class="italic">The Critic</span> (both 1928); and <span class="italic">The Importance of being Earnest</span>, with John Gielgud (1930). Often abetted by Lovat Fraser's designs, Playfair &#145;established a distinctive style of simplified realism, stylized gesture and formalized composition in a brilliant series of elegant productions&#146;  (Banham, 655). After <span class="italic">Derby Day</span> (1932) he relinquished active management of the Lyric.<br>
<br>Playfair blended original comedy and contemporary satire in a manner perfectly adapted to the taste of the time. He appeared in many of his Lyric productions with a style &#145;broad and loose, personal rather than interpretative&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 20 Aug 1934) and gathered there a loyal and happy team of young players, musicians, and designers who, under his genial leadership, not only began to make their reputations and confirm his, but also helped to create a specific Lyric style, all with &#145;a sanity of judgment together with a freshness of interest&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 15 March 1935). Throughout this fruitful period he had also been busy producing and acting at other London theatres, including appearances in <span class="italic">Prisoners of War</span> at the Playhouse and <span class="italic">The Green Hat</span> at the Adelphi (both 1925); <span class="italic">The Duchess of Elba</span> at the Arts (1927); <span class="italic">The Lady of the Camellias</span> at the Garrick (1930); and <span class="italic">Vile Bodies</span> at the Arts (1931). His own personal contribution to the theatre was recognized by a knighthood in 1928.<br>
<br>Playfair also had a brief film career. He made several silent films, and four indifferent &#145;talkies&#146;. These were <span class="italic">Perfect Understanding</span> and <span class="italic">Crime on the Hill</span>&#151;perhaps his best, a country-house murder mystery in which he played the murderer (both 1933), and <span class="italic">Little Stranger</span> and <span class="italic">The Lady is Willing</span> (both 1934).<br>
<br>Playfair and his wife made their Chiswick waterfront home, Said House, a centre of welcome to artistic people, both young and old. Away from the theatre his interests were golf and tennis, but he was widely cultured with an interest in many subjects. He was the author or co-author of several plays, such as <span class="italic">Shock-Headed Pete</span> and <span class="italic">Amelia</span>, the adapter or co-adapter of a number of foreign plays, and a frequent contributor to leading London magazines. In 1925 he published <span class="italic">The Story of the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith</span>, and in 1930, <span class="italic">Hammersmith Hoy: a Book of Minor Revelations</span>, two volumes of reminiscence. He also did much work for London voluntary hospitals and was a member of the propaganda committee of King Edward's Hospital Fund.<br>
<br>After a short illness Playfair died at King's College Hospital, London, on 19 August 1934. According to his known wishes, Lady Playfair presented his fine collection of printed plays and books, relating to the art and history of the stage, to the British Drama League. Said House was sold shortly thereafter. The following March his close friend from university days, the foreign secretary Sir John Simon, opened a memorial exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum comprising designs for scenery and costumes, playbills, and other objects representing Playfair's theatrical work.<br>
