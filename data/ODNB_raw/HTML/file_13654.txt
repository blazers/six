<span class="headword">Hondius <span class="st"> [ de Hont,  de Hond]</span>,  Abraham Danielszoon</span>  (<em>c.</em>1631&#150;1691), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born probably in Rotterdam, the eldest of six children (four boys and two girls) of Daniel Abrahamszoon de Hond (<i>d</i>. 1664), master mason, and Crijntgen Alewijnsdochter Pancrasz (<i>d</i>. 1673). His brother Isaac de Hond (<i>c</i>.1646&#150;1716) also became a painter. Although Hondius was already a skilled master by the age of about twenty&#151;his earliest known painting, <span class="italic">Sportsman Outside an Italianate Inn</span>, signed and dated 1651, was described as a work of consummate skill&#151;nothing is known of his youth or of how or with whom he learned his trade. On 27 April 1653 he married Geertruyd Willemsdochter van den Eijck (<i>d</i>. 1681), of Rotterdam. The date of birth of their only child, a daughter named Geertruyd, is not known; a son, Abraham, also a painter, is mentioned in Hondius's will.<br>
<br>The signed and dated <i>&#339;uvre</i> of Hondius is large and varied. A break in his work, according to where the paintings were made, is evident: in his Netherlandish work, made before he settled in England, the subject matter is varied and includes hunting scenes with and without figures, domestic scenes, history paintings based on stories from the <span class="roman">Old</span> and <span class="roman">New</span> Testaments, historical and mythological works. He often painted on panel, and the dimensions of his paintings are on the whole modest. A key work is his monumental altar piece <span class="italic">Adoration of the Shepherds</span>, signed and dated 1664 (Museum Catharijneconvent, Utrecht). At that time he was living at the Oppert, in Rotterdam; since a clandestine Roman Catholic church was an integral part of the buildings it can be inferred that he himself was a Catholic.<br>
<br>In Hondius's signed and dated work after 1671&#150;2 the variety of subject matter has disappeared, as has the use of panel as support. He now almost exclusively paints savage hunting scenes without figures on canvas, generally of very large dimensions. A subject unusual for Hondius but very popular in England appears in his <i>&#339;uvre</i>, namely large town views that refer to a specific event; <span class="italic">The Frozen River</span> (1677; Museum of London) is a good example of this development. The quality of his canvasses depicting hunting scenes declined at this time.<br>
<br>These changes in his <i>&#339;uvre</i> indicate that Hondius left the Netherlands in 1671&#150;2, a time of great economic crisis. In his <span class="italic">Diary</span>, which covers the period 1672&#150;80, the scientist and architect Robert Hooke mentions that he is involved with Hondius on two projects, for the Guildhall (1674) and for the Royal College of Physicians (1674). Sequences in Hooke's <span class="italic">Diary</span> indicate that their partnership fell apart for financial reasons that were mainly due to Hondius's awkward temperament. His biographer Jacob Campo Weyerman (1729&#150;1769), also a painter, who might have known him in London, describes Hondius as &#145;a great man in his profession but quite unfortunate in his temperament which was not well served by his behaviour&#146;  (Weyerman, 3.157&#150;8). Weyerman further notes:<blockquote>he left for England with someone else's wife with whom he lived as his genuine spouse. After the death of this lady he married a frump who, with a basket on her head, earned her living in the vegetable market. (ibid.)</blockquote>Hondius died at the Blackamoor's Head, near Water Lane, Fleet Street, London, in September 1691 and was buried on 17 September. His wife, Sarah, inherited &#145;two peices of landskipp, halflenghts. And eight of his best small peices with his own picture&#146;  (Croft-Murray and Hulton, 370). To his son Abraham he left his prints, books, and drawings &#145;for his own proper use&#146;; the remaining paintings were intended to be sold to pay for his funeral. Weyerman recorded that he &#145;painted Portraits, Trojan devastations, candlelight scenes, statuary, deerhunts, hounds&#151;and bearfights, hawking parties, horses and dogs &hellip; an Amsterdam Dog Market by his hand, with more than thirty different types of dogs, [was] beautifully drawn and lovingly painted&#146;  (Weyerman, 157&#150;8).<br>
