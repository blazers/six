<span class="headword">Stanley,  Edward John</span>, second Baron Stanley of Alderley and first Baron Eddisbury  (1802&#150;1869), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 13 November 1802 at Alderley Park, Cheshire, the eldest son of John Thomas Stanley, first Baron Stanley of Alderley (1766&#150;1850), and Maria Josepha (1771&#150;1863), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13608/', "John Baker Holroyd, first earl of Sheffield")</script>. He had a younger twin brother, William Owen Stanley (1802&#150;1884). His father, a strong whig, was MP for Wootton Bassett from 1790 to 1796; his mother, whose intellectual talents were admired by Gibbon, was a domineering personality  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>). Stanley was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1822 and graduated BA with third-class honours in classics in 1825. He married Henrietta Maria Dillon-Lee (1807&#150;1895), eldest daughter of the thirteenth Viscount Dillon, on 7 October 1826 at Florence [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26271/', "Stanley, Henrietta Maria")</script>]; although the marriage was valid they underwent a second ceremony at Alderley on 26 June 1833. They had four sons and six daughters, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36246/', "Henry Edward John Stanley")</script>, who succeeded as third baron, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36244/', "Edward Lyulph Stanley")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34022/', "Rosalind Frances Howard, countess of Carlisle")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41338/', "Katharine Louisa Russell, Lady Amberley")</script>, mother of the philosopher Bertrand Russell, and the women's welfare activist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45676/', "Maude Alethea Stanley")</script>.<br>
<br>Stanley was first returned to parliament for Hindon, Wiltshire, in the last unreformed election of 1831, and when that borough was disfranchised represented North Cheshire from 1832 to 1841, and from 1847 to 1848. On 12 May 1848 he was created Baron Eddisbury, and he succeeded to the barony of Stanley of Alderley on 23 October 1850.<br>
<br>Stanley entered parliament as a whig. He came to prominence through Edward Ellice and Lord Durham. It was probably Ellice who persuaded Lord Melbourne to appoint him as secretary to the Treasury in 1835. Stanley had served as under-secretary for the colonies under Lord Grey in 1833&#150;4, and as under-secretary to the Home department under Lord Melbourne from July to November 1834. Ellice was Treasury secretary, but his keen interest in electoral matters prevented him from devoting the time required to manage the government's often disorganized and disunited supporters in the Commons. Lord Althorp, leader in the Commons, had hoped that reform would forge a united party in the house, but lack of attention to the whip generated a series of parliamentary crises. Stanley's connections to Durham, Joseph Parkes of Birmingham, and other members of the radical movement seemed to make him an ideal person to keep the coalition of whigs, radicals, and Irish members together following the so-called Lichfield House compact of 1835. Stanley was appointed paymaster-general for the government's last few months of office from June to September 1841, and was appointed a privy councillor on 11 August 1841.<br>
<br>As Treasury secretary, Stanley was only a moderate success. Parkes thought him a good &#145;whipper in&#146;, although he made no strong impression on Lord Holland, who continued to regard Ellice as the chief whip as late as January 1836. Many did not trust him. Nicknamed Benjamin Backbite at Oxford on account of his often malicious satire, he could be either genial or disagreeable. One clerk called him &#145;cross-grained and tyrannical&#146;  (Bourne, 412). <span class="italic">The Times</span>, in his obituary, concluded that although he had &#145;spice of ill-nature&#146;, he was a man of &#145;great kindliness of heart, and ever ready to do a friendly and obliging action&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 17 June 1869).<br>
<br>During his first term as Treasury secretary, Stanley had the advantage of a comfortable majority, but following losses in the elections of 1837, the lack of formal management procedures produced unnecessary crises. Ellice warned Melbourne by the end of 1838 that Stanley had been unable to do a good job and that the party, if it was to stay together in the Commons, was in need of a new secretary. His warning was prophetic, for it was clear that Stanley had not warned the members of the importance and suspected closeness of the Jamaica division that prompted the government's resignation in May 1839. In fact, his dalliance with Durham, Parkes, and other radicals lost him support among the whiggish leaders and members. Melbourne would not move him to the Colonial Office, as Ellice recommended, because of that connection. Stanley's radical propensities may have been shaped by his wife, who had strong Jacobin and radical sympathies. As Durham's private secretary when the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> was drafted, he quickly became known as his &#145;radical henchman&#146;. Although he was closely connected to the radicals Joseph Hume and Henry Warburton who founded the Reform Association in 1835, the whigs refused to join that populist organization devoted to organizing further reforms. The following year, Stanley joined with Parkes and Hume to organize a Liberal Union club to &#145;humanize the Radicals and liberalize the Whigs&#146;  (Parkes to Brougham, 12 Feb 1836, Brougham MSS). But this new Reform Club was quickly and deliberately swamped with whig grandees, who did not want to alienate the radicals by disowning their alternative to Brooks's Club, but who had no intentions of cavorting so openly with Stanley's connections. If his serving as Treasury secretary was a tactical device to hold a parliamentary alliance together, such a strategy was not without difficulty.<br>
<br>Where Ellice had served as Stanley's early mentor, Lord Palmerston did so in the later stages of his career. Why he should do so is not at all clear. Stanley and Palmerston were poles apart politically; they had represented the opposite ends of the spectrum in Melbourne's government. Stanley was among those in 1836 who wanted Palmerston elevated to the peerage, and hence removed from the Commons. He had, moreover, intervened with the press on behalf of Lord John Russell in the latter's vituperative and public opposition to Palmerston's bellicose quarrel with France over Eastern affairs. Yet in July 1846, when the whigs returned to office, Palmerston chose him as under-secretary for foreign affairs, a post he held until February 1852. Perhaps Palmerston continued to be influenced by thoughts of Lady Stanley, to whom he had attempted, unsuccessfully, to make love in his &#145;impudent, brusque way&#146; in 1826  (Bourne, 213). He had continued to hold her in some regard, terming Stanley at one point &#145;joint whip with Mrs Stanley&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Whatever the reason, Palmerston continued to look after the career of this unexceptional career politician. Vice-president of the Board of Trade in February 1852 and again from 1853, he was appointed president in March 1855 at a time when trade policy took a decided back seat to foreign wars, and remained in this office until February 1858. In August 1860 he was appointed by Palmerston as postmaster-general with a seat in the cabinet, remaining until July 1866, but he refused further office, on account of declining health, when offered a cabinet seat by Gladstone in 1868.<br>
<br>Stanley died at his London house, 40 Dover Street, on 16 June 1869. As he lay dying, he heard a noise in the street, and asked his daughter if the revolution had begun. He was buried at Alderley Park on 23 June 1869. His wife long outlived him.<br>
