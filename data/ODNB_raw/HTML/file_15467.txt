<span class="headword">Kerr,  Schomberg Henry</span>, ninth marquess of Lothian  (1833&#150;1900), <span class="occ">diplomatist and politician</span>, second son of John William Robert Kerr, seventh marquess of Lothian, and his wife, Lady Cecil Chetwynd Talbot, only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26924/', "Charles Chetwynd Talbot, second Earl Talbot")</script>, was born at Newbattle Abbey, near Dalkeith, on 2 December 1833. His elder brother, William Schomberg Robert Kerr, born on 12 August 1832, succeeded as eighth marquess of Lothian on his father's death on 14 November 1841, but himself died without issue on 4 July 1870. A noted bibliophile, he bequeathed to Oxford University money for the foundation of the marquess of Lothian's prize, awarded annually to a historian.<br>
<br>Schomberg Henry Kerr was educated at Trinity College, Glenalmond, and at Oxford, where he matriculated from New College on 20 October 1851. He left the university without a degree, entered the diplomatic service, and was appointed attach&eacute; at Lisbon. He was transferred in 1854 to Tehran, and thence in 1855 to Baghdad. During the Anglo-Persian War of 1856&#150;7 he served as a volunteer on the staff of Sir James Outram, by whom he was publicly thanked at the close of the campaign. He was afterwards attach&eacute; at Athens, and in 1862 was appointed second secretary at Frankfurt. He served in the same capacity briefly at Madrid in 1865, then was moved to Vienna.<br>
<br>On 23 February 1865 Kerr married Lady Victoria Alexandrina Montagu-Douglas-Scott, second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24929/', "Walter Francis Montagu-Douglas-Scott, the fifth duke of Buccleuch")</script>, and his wife, Lady Charlotte Anne; they had three sons and five daughters. Kerr succeeded his elder brother, William Schomberg Robert, as ninth marquess of Lothian and fourth Baron Ker of Kersheugh, Roxburghshire, on 4 July 1870, and in right of the latter peerage took his seat in the House of Lords on 30 March 1871. He moved, on 19 March 1874, the address in answer to the queen's speech, and on 5 August following took the oaths for the subordinate office of lord privy seal of Scotland, which he held until his death. He was sworn of the privy council on 6 February 1886, and in Lord Salisbury's second administration succeeded A. J. Balfour as secretary for Scotland, and, as such, <i>ex officio</i> keeper of the great seal of Scotland and vice-president of the committee of council for education in Scotland (11 March 1887). The sphere of his administrative duties was further enlarged by a statute of the same year (50 &amp; 51 Vict. c. 52). He held office until the fall of the administration in August 1892, during which period he had charge of the measures of 1889 for the reform and re-endowment of the Scottish universities and the reform of Scottish local government, and several other measures closely affecting Scottish interests.<br>
<br>Kerr was a member of the Historical Manuscripts Commission, was elected in 1877 president of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, and received in 1882 the degree of LLD from the University of Edinburgh, of which he was lord rector in 1887&#150;90. He was also vice-president of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society and a member of the governing body of the Imperial Institute. In 1878 he was elected KT and in 1899 a knight of grace of the order of St John of Jerusalem. He was colonel from 1878 to 1889, and afterwards honorary colonel, of the 3rd battalion of the Royal Scots regiment, and captain-general of the Royal Company of Archers from 1884 until his death on 17 January 1900. He died at 39 Grosvenor Square, London, and was buried at Newbattle Abbey. He was succeeded by his third son, Robert Schomberg Kerr. His widow married Bertram Talbot, and died on 19 June 1938.<br>
