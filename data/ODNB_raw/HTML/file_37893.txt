<span class="headword">Richardson,  Charles</span>  (1814&#150;1896), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born at Capenhurst Hall near Chester on 14 August 1814, the third son of Richard Richardson JP, a deputy lieutenant for Cheshire, who died when Charles was six years old, and his wife, Dorothea. He was educated privately in England and France, and then at Edinburgh University which he left in 1833. From his earliest years he showed exceptional ability in mechanics and a natural talent for engineering, which his mother in particular did much to foster.<br>
<br>At the age of nineteen Richardson was apprenticed to Isambard K. Brunel who employed him on the Box and Sapperton tunnels and on other sections of the Great Western Railway. In 1858 he was appointed resident engineer under Brunel of the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway, which was to involve a ferry crossing of the River Severn. After the death of Brunel in 1859 he was promoted engineer-in-chief, and it was while working on the ferry piers in 1862&#150;3 that the idea of the Severn railway tunnel came into his mind. Although the plan was at first rejected on the grounds of cost, eventually in 1872 the <span class="roman">Severn Tunnel Bill</span> was passed by parliament and construction began the following year. In October 1879 the headings from the English and Welsh sides were only 138 yards apart when a great inrush of water occurred, and the work was brought to a standstill. At this stage Richardson was replaced as engineer-in-chief by John Hawkshaw, and the former's role was much diminished. It was the end of 1881 before the most strenuous efforts of the engineers, contractors, and divers enabled the tunnel to be pumped dry and work to continue. At the end of 1886 the tunnel was opened to passenger and goods traffic; it was more than 4 miles long and its construction occupied almost fourteen years, at a cost of more than &pound;2 million. Much credit is due to Richardson for the conception of the scheme. He developed a system for successfully aligning the two headings with unparalleled accuracy, and on occasion his advice was ignored when it might better have been followed.<br>
<br>Richardson was the inventor of the cane-spliced cricket bat and a catapult for bowling which was successfully used for many years. He was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1875. In his later years he wrote three papers on the Severn tunnel, one on arches, and one on the disposal of sewage. He died at his home, 10 Berkeley Square, Bristol, on 10 February 1896, survived by his wife, Mary Frances, and two sons.<br>
