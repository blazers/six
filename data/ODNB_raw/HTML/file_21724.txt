<span class="headword">Pearson,  Thomas Hooke</span>  (1806&#150;1892), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, the son of John Pearson, advocate-general of India, was born in June 1806. He was educated at Eton College, and entered the army as a cornet in the 11th light dragoons on 14 March 1825. In November 1825 he served at the siege of Bharatpur under Lord Combermere, where he volunteered for the assault, but was not used. The cavalry served well in preventing the escape of the usurping raja and his followers.<br>
<br>When Lord Amherst, the governor-general, visited Ranjit Singh, Pearson accompanied him as aide-de-camp, and received a sword from the maharaja for riding a horse that was believed to be unmanageable. He obtained a troop in the 16th lancers on 16 August 1831, and served with them at the battle of Maharajpur, where Sir Hugh Gough defeated the Marathas on 29 December 1843, and also in the First Anglo-Sikh War. At Aliwal (28 January 1846) Pearson commanded one of the squadrons which broke through an infantry square. During the latter part of that day, and at Sobraon (10 February), he was in command of the regiment; he was twice mentioned in dispatches, and received a brevet majority on 19 June 1846. In a letter written at Aliwal on 29 January 1846, Pearson said: &#145;I, of course led the charge, and was the first man over the enemy's entrenchments, and at no point of the whole affair had I a man in front of me&#146;  (Graham, 110). He became major in the regiment on 23 April 1847, but saw no further active service, and was placed on half pay on 7 April 1848. He became lieutenant-general on 1 October 1877, and was then retired with the honorary rank of general. He had been made a CB on 2 June 1869, and on 4 February 1879 was given the colonelcy of the 12th lancers. In 1867 he won the One Thousand Guineas, the Great Yorkshire Stakes, the St Leger, and the Doncaster Cup with his horse Achievement (<i>d</i>. 1872). He died at his home, The Hasells, Sandy, Bedfordshire, on 29 April 1892, leaving four sons and three daughters: his wife, Frances E. A. Pearson, had died in 1890.<br>
