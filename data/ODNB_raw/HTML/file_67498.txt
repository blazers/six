<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Roberts, Sir  Frank Kenyon</span>  (1907&#150;1998), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 27 October 1907 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the son of Henry George Roberts of Preston, Lancashire, manager of Unilever in Argentina, and his wife, Gertrude, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kenyon, of Blackburn, Lancashire. His maternal grandfather was the film-maker <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94370/', "James Kenyon")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94369/', "Mitchell, Sagar Jones")</script>]. He was sent home to school in England, first to Bedales School (1917&#150;20) and then to Rugby School (1921&#150;6). At both schools, although diminutive in stature, he excelled in games as well as in academic work. At Rugby his headmaster, William Wyamar Vaughan, and his housemaster, John Bruce-Lockhart, regarded him as an outstanding all-rounder: he was head of the school and was in both the rugby and the cricket teams, and he finished his school career by winning a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge. Roberts graduated from Cambridge in 1930 with first-class honours in both parts of the history tripos. After spending the customary periods of study with academic families in France and Germany in order to improve his languages he took the Foreign Office examination in 1930 and passed in top.<br>
<br>From the first Roberts was recognized in the Foreign Office as exceptionally able, and he quickly made his mark. The Paris embassy was his first post abroad, from October 1932, when he was private secretary to Lord Tyrrell. Tyrrell was a diplomatist of great eminence, known especially for his long and loyal service as private secretary to Sir Edward Grey just before the First World War, and for the fact that he seldom committed himself on paper to a view on policy. From Paris, Roberts went to Cairo in March 1935, again as private secretary, this time to the head of mission, Sir Miles Lampson (later Lord Killearn), then high commissioner in Egypt and a very formidable person. Thus in both Paris and Cairo, Roberts was an observer of the differing styles of two great ambassadors, though it cannot be said that he was to emulate either of them. In Cairo he became engaged to Celeste Leila Beatrix (Cella) Shoucair (<i>d</i>. 1990), the daughter of Sir Said Shoucair Pasha, financial adviser to the Sudan government, who was of a distinguished Lebanese family. They married in the Anglican cathedral in Cairo on 1 June 1937. In November that year Roberts and his wife returned to London, where he was to serve in the Foreign Office until the last months of the Second World War. Still a very junior official Roberts was nevertheless in the thick of affairs as a member of the central department, dealing with European questions during the succession of crises just before the outbreak of war. Indeed, he acquired the reputation of always being on hand in the middle of the action and was described in a <span class="italic">Guardian</span> obituary as a &#145;sort of scrum half of diplomacy&#146;  (9 Jan 1998); for example, he was the official who took over to the House of Commons the telegram that enabled Mr Chamberlain to announce with high drama the invitation to meet Hitler at Munich in 1938. In March 1939 he was dealing with Polish affairs when Chamberlain made his abrupt change of policy and gave a guarantee to Poland after Hitler's annexation of Czechoslovakia. Later on in the year he accompanied Sir William Strang to Moscow for the negotiations that attempted unsuccessfully to enlist Russian help in stemming German plans for further aggressive acts. He was present in the secretary of state's room at the Foreign Office on 3 September 1939 when the ultimatum ran out and Britain therefore came to be at war with Germany. He was the British joint secretary of the Anglo-French war council in 1939&#150;40. In December 1941, after Hitler's invasion of Russia, he was one of the small party accompanying Anthony Eden to Moscow. Later in the war he was largely responsible for negotiating the Azores agreement with Portugal, providing for the allied use of this important naval base. He was then involved in much of the planning for a post-war settlement that went on in the Foreign Office in 1943 and 1944, and he was present at the famous Yalta conference in 1945.<br>
<br>Promoted acting counsellor, Roberts was transferred to Moscow with the rank of minister-plenipotentiary in January 1945. The next three years, 1945&#150;7, were to be perhaps the most important period of the middle years of his career, for it was from Moscow that&#151;as charg&eacute; d'affaires in close consultation with the United States ambassador, George Kennan&#151;he sent back to London the powerfully argued analysis of Soviet policy that was to form the basis for the allied policy of containment. The policy of containment was shortly adopted and successfully carried out once it became clear that the Soviet Union was not willing to remain in collaboration with its wartime allies in managing the post-war settlement. It was when in Moscow that Roberts (who had been appointed CMG in 1946) was spotted by Ernest Bevin and invited to become his private secretary at the end of 1947. In this capacity he entered once more into the centre of government affairs at home. He was used by Bevin as his right-hand man in discussions with the Russians and the Americans over the Berlin airlift in 1947 and 1948, and he proved a reliable and skilful negotiator. But the normal duties of a private secretary were not really suited to one of such an active turn of mind and, although at the time reluctant to leave Bevin's side, Roberts's next experience, as number two in the high commission in India from April 1949 to August 1951, was to be of great value in widening his knowledge of the developing world at a very interesting time. From India he returned to London to be the deputy under-secretary responsible for European affairs. By this time Eden had become foreign secretary and Roberts, as his principal adviser on Europe, dealt with the whole complex of problems involved in re-establishing a sovereign state in West Germany and in bringing Germany into the Atlantic Alliance as a major partner of the Western powers. Roberts was at Eden's elbow in 1954 during the whole time in which, after the failure of the French assembly to ratify the European defence treaty, Eden's initiative to provide a new structure for European defence led to agreement on the Western European Union, underpinned by the British commitment of forces to be stationed on the continent. Eden's policy was crowned with success at the Lancaster House conference in October. Eden and Roberts during this important period gave an admirable example of the right partnership between minister and official. Roberts's services were recognized by his appointment as KCMG in 1953. Thereafter Roberts's career took him as ambassador to Tito's Yugoslavia from November 1954 to February 1957, as ambassador to NATO from then until April 1960, and as ambassador to the Soviet Union from then until November 1962. With the key top people in each of these posts&#151;Tito, Spaak (then secretary-general of NATO), and Khrushchov&#151;he succeeded in developing an excellent working relationship and he proved an effective advocate and executant of British policies. Finally, at the end of his career Roberts had a five year tour as ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany, from February 1963 to May 1968. He regretted that, for all his efforts, German support for British entry to the EEC was deplorably weak in the face of French opposition, but in all other respects Anglo-German relations were excellent when Roberts left Bonn. He was advanced to GCMG in 1963, and was made GCVO in 1965.<br>
<br>Roberts was very small in stature, but he enjoyed excellent health, and he remained active in mind and body until his death at the age of ninety. During his diplomatic career he was a glutton for work at all stages, and if he had a fault it was no doubt excessive zeal and an unwillingness to delegate. But his virtues were numerous; he was almost the ideal civil servant&#151;loyal, well-informed, industrious, even-tempered, ingenious in finding a way through difficulties, and a very intelligent negotiator. He also had something of a genius for entering sympathetically into the minds of those whom he served, and it was this that earned him the confidence of a variety of British ministers&#151;Churchill, Bevin, Eden, Macmillan, Butler, Heath, Wilson, Stewart, and even George Brown. As for the foreign statesmen with whom he had to deal, they all respected and liked him&#151;Stalin, Tito, Adenauer, Brandt, and Schmidt. He made a special contribution to understanding between Britain and Germany both during his time as ambassador in Bonn and in his retirement.<br>
<br>Roberts and his wife had no children. After retirement they lived in an elegant flat in Kensington, London, and for the next twenty or twenty-five years had a busy social life. In the first period after returning to London, Roberts became involved in a good deal of quasi-official work arising from his government service. Thus he was a member of the Duncan committee on overseas representation in 1969, president of the British Atlantic Committee for many years and also of the European Atlantic Group, as well as a member of the council of Chatham House and a frequent participant in their debates and conferences on European affairs. He was president and then vice-president of the German chamber of commerce and industry in the UK; in fact his main political interest continued to be in German affairs and especially in Anglo-German relations. He was chairman of the steering committee of the K&ouml;nigswinter (Anglo-German) conference and later a founder member of the young K&ouml;nigswinter conference, which took place annually in Berlin. In this, in spite of the age gap, he was readily accepted as being on the same wavelength as the youthful participants. He managed to combine all this with a number of business activities, such as non-executive directorships of Hoechst, Mercedes Benz, the Amalgamated Metal Corporation, and Unilever. This last directorship gave him much satisfaction because of his father's long membership of the firm. Among his many honorary activities was the chairmanship of the governors of Bedales and membership of various bodies connected with Rugby School.<br>
<br>After his wife's death in 1990 Roberts took a little while to recover, but he acquired a second wind and in 1991, at the age of eighty-four, he published his diplomatic memoirs, <span class="italic">Dealing with Dictators</span>. He had written much of this when his wife was still alive and she had assisted him in the recollection of events, but he had laid it aside until he felt able to complete it. After that he made frequent appearances on television programmes dealing with the history of the 1940s and 1950s. His phenomenally accurate memory of the events of fifty years earlier and his articulate presentation of his recollections were alike impressive. He was still going strong when he died suddenly in the Cromwell Hospital, Kensington, on 7 January 1998. His remains were cremated.<br>
